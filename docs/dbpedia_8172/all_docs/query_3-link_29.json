        "text": "The beginnings of Italian hegemony\n\nApart from the Ottoman Empire itself, Britain and Italy were most involved in opening Tripolitania to the European economy. This was part of a wider imperialist and colonialist plan in which Europeans extended their reach in North Africa, usually in rivalry with each other. Britain, France and Germany were the leaders, with Italy and Spain forming the second rank.\n\nItalian involvement in Africa was initially centred on Somalia and Ethiopia. But the Ethiopian army defeated the Italians at Adawa in 1896, one of the worst defeats of a European power in colonial history. That meant that Italian nationalist politicians, with a lust for an imperial identity, came to identify Libya as a suitable colony. There was already a significant Italian presence through the Banco di Roma, other trading houses and Italian schools. Jewish middlemen and traders spoke Italian and some of them were Italian citizens.\n\nAt the same time, Tripolitania and Cyrenaica had strategic value when the rest of North Africa was being divided by Britain and France in a way that excluded Germany. In 1904, in exchange for a free hand to the British ‘veiled protectorate‘ in Egypt, France got freedom of action in Morocco alongside existing French control of Algeria and Tunisia, with a nod to Spanish ‘interests’ in northern and southern Morocco.\n\nIn 1902 other European states agreed to recognize an Italian hegemony in Libya. In return, the Italian government recognized an agreement made in 1899 by the French and British governments that defined the northern limit of French colonial expansion. This would become the southern boundary of the Italian colony in Libya.\n\nArmed Resistance\n\nAfter the Ottomans withdrew, local fighters continued the resistance to the Italians. There were several local attempts to organise resistance among the Ibadi Amazigh in the mountains of north-west Libya and around Misrata, as well as in the Fezzan. In April 1915 local Tripolitanian forces defeated the Italian army at the battle of Gardabia (or Qasr Bu Hadi). The Italians then withdrew all their forces to the coast.\n\nWhen the Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi addressed the Libyan people on television after the start of the revolution that would bring him down, he boasted that ‘My grandfather, Abdul Salam Buminyar, was the first martyr to fall in al-Khums during the first battle in 1911.’\n\nCyrenaica provided the most determined resistance, led by men from lower-status tribes, as the Sanusi leadership was increasingly collaborating with the Italians. As part of the secret diplomacy of the First World War in the Middle East and North Africa, Britain, France and Russia secretly agreed to divide the Ottoman Empire between them once the war ended. They divided Greater Syria between Britain and France (Sykes-Picot Agreement, 1916) and promised King Husayn of the Hejaz to help found an Arab state after the war. They used similar tactics in Libya.\n\nThe pattern was similar to what the allied powers had already agreed over Libya. In 1915 in the secret Treaty of London, Britain, France, and Russia promised Italy favourable treatment in gaining colonies if it joined them. In 1917 the British persuaded Muhammad Idris, who had become the new head of the Sanusi order, to negotiate a political settlement with the Italians, under which he would become Amir (prince) of Cyrenaica, with autonomous authority over the inland parts of Cyrenaica.\n\nAfter the war, the Italian government toyed with this principle of autonomy. They did recognise Muhammad Idris al-Sanusi as the Amir of Cyrenaica, but his autonomy was very limited. In Tripolitania, local nationalist leaders declared independence (the Tripolitanian Republic) and initially the Italian government seemed willing to negotiate with them. Quite soon the leaders of the Tripolitanian Republic fell out among themselves.\n\nThese arrangements soon broke down. In any event, autonomy would not survive the arrival in power of the new fascist regime that took over Italy in late 1922."
