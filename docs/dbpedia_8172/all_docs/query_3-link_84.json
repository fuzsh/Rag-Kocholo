        "text": "Two criteria need to be assessed in order to answer the question whether a situation of armed violence amounts to a non-international armed conflict.\n\nFirst, the level of armed violence must reach a certain degree of intensity that goes beyond internal disturbances and tensions.\n\nSecond, in every non-international armed conflict, at least one side to the conflict must be a non-state armed group which must exhibit a certain level of organization in order to qualify as a party to the non-international armed conflict. Government forces are presumed to satisfy the criteria of organization.\n\nIntensity of violence\n\nVarious indicative factors are used to assess whether a given situation has met the required intensity threshold, such as the number, duration, and intensity of individual confrontations; the types of weapons and military equipment used; the number of persons and types of forces participating in the fighting; the number of casualties; the extent of material destruction; the number of civilians fleeing; and the involvement of the United Nations Security Council.\n\nOverview\n\nThe situation that led to the onset of the conflict in 2014 originated in 2011, when political demonstrations broke out in Libya. The unrest followed the arrest of several lawyers representing prisoners and was inspired by the events that had led to the fall of the regimes of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in Tunisia and President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt shortly before. These popular uprisings started on 15 February 2011 in Benghazi and took place in the context of what we now call the Arab Spring. In Libya, the protests were initially peaceful, but when the Gadhafi regime responded with violence, the resistance also turned violent, took up arms, and demanded regime change. This led to an escalation of tensions and violence that turned into a NIAC. The fighting between Gadhafi's government forces and the opposition (thuwar or revolutionaries), which includeed various tribes, militias and defected government soldiers, reached the required degree of intensity and organisation to be classified as a NIAC by late February 2011.\n\nThe international community reacted strongly to the events unfolding in Libya at the time. On 25 February, the UN Human Rights Council condemned violence, while an independent international Commission of Inquiry was set up. On 26 February, the UNSC passed Resolution 1970 in order to impose an arms embargo and to refer the situation in Libya to the ICC. The next step was taken on 17 March 2011, when the UNSC adopted Resolution 1973 authorizing member states to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya and to take ‘all necessary measures,’ short of foreign occupation, and notwithstanding the arms embargo mandated in UNSCR 1970, to protect civilians from the abuses committed by Gadhafi forces. A coalition of states – which included Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, Norway, Qatar, Spain, United Arab Emirates, UK and USA – intervened in Libya. Since the intervention took place against Libyan state forces and without their consent, the intervention triggered an IAC between the intervening states and Libya.\n\nOn 27 August 2011, Tripoli was officially in the hands of the thuwar forces, which meant a significant loss for the Gadhafi regime. At that moment, the only stronghold left for Gadhafi was Sirte. Heavy fighting occurred in September and October, which ended on 20 October 2011, when Gadhafi was killed and his regime was definitively overthrown. This brought to an end the parallel NIAC and IACs that took place between Gaddafi's regime and thuwar forces, supported by several states and NATO.\n\nSince the end of the Gadhafi regime, Libya has been plagued by political unrest and armed violence with competing legislative bodies, divided State security forces and multiple armed rebel groups. In August 2012, the National Transitional Council handed political control to the elected General National Congress (GNC). Originally the GNC mandate was due to expire in February 2014; however, the GNC decided to extend it until the end of 2014, decision that triggered protests in Libya.\n\nOn 14 February 2014, General Khalifa Haftar announced the establishment of the Libyan National Army (LNA), hoping that this would attract other plethora of militias in Libya, and declared that the interim government was suspended. In mid-May 2014, tensions reached a zenith when heavy fighting broke out in eastern Libya, including Benghazi, against Ansar Al Sharia. This explosion of violence came when General Haftar launched an operation called Operation Dignity against an alliance of Islamist armed groups, including Ansar al-Sharia, using helicopters, fighter jets and ground forces. To counter this movement, different armed groups, led by the Misrata Brigades, joined hands in supporting the GNC and formed a coalition called Libya Dawn. The militias aligned with the General National Congress deployed in Tripoli. These events let to ‘the eruption of full-scale civil war.’\n\nAfter the contested elections of June 2014, a new legislative body, the House of Representatives (HoR), was supposed to replace the GNC in August 2014. However, part of the GNC, supported by armed militias, challenged the election results and reconstituted itself as a rival legislative body in Tripoli. Armed clashes between armed groups supporting respectively the GNC and the HoR escalated during June 2014 and led to the internationally recognised HoR convening in Tobruk instead of Tripoli, which remained under the control of the Libya Dawn coalition, a coalition of powerful militias supporting the GNC.\n\nDespite this situation of chaos and instability, UN-backed negotiations led to the Libyan Political Agreement (LPA), which created a new Government of National Accord (GNA) with the Presidency Council, an executive body that arrived in Tripoli in March 2016. However, since the HoR rejected the lists of ministers submitted by the Presidency Council, it was never integrated into the GNA, the internationally recognised government of Libya. It is worth highlighting that the HoR based in Tobruk lost its status as the internationally recognized government following the creation of the GNA.\n\nThe GNA, led by Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj, is recognized by the UN as ‘the sole legitimate government of Libya’ and the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has called upon the Member States ‘to cease support to and official contact with parallel institutions that claim to be the legitimate authority but are outside the Agreement’.\n\nAs a result, since then power has been split between two rival governments, the GNA based in Tripoli and the HoR in Tobruk, each allied with different armed groups, among others the LNA on the side of the HoR. Moreover, the GNC continued to reside in Tripoli. As pockets of fighting have been bubbling up across Libya from mid-2014 onwards, NIACs between the forces supporting the two rival governments have been taking place in Libya. In September 2017, the United Nations proposed a new action plan with amendments to the 2015 Political Agreement, but it was unsuccessful.\n\nOn 23 October 2020, after a prolonged period of violent confrontations between the GNA and LNA forces, allied to the HoR, a ‘permanent ceasefire’ agreement for the whole country was signed by both sides under the auspices of the UN. The aim of this ceasefire agreement was the formation of a unity government that would take office with a view to organising national elections and to implement the October 2020 ceasefire agreement. The formation of this Government of National Unity (GNU) in March 2021 was the culmination of the less tense relationship between the GNA and the HoR. However, for classification purposes, this could not yet lead to a declassification of the NIAC between them, as this was a transition to a lasting solution, which did not exist at that time. The GNU has failed to organise elections in December 2021, which led to the militias supporting the GNU and former GNA being at odds again with the LNA/HoR since the end of December 2021. The fact that the two parties have come to be diametrically opposed again is also reflected politically in the HoR's appointment of a new PM Fathi Bashagha for the GNU, while the previous PM Abdulhamid Dabaiba vowed to remain in post until national elections are held.\n\nIn parallel to the aforementioned conflict, both the government of Libya (first GNC, later GNA and finally GNU) and the LNA/HoR are also each engaged in a non-international armed conflict with the Islamic State (IS) and other armed groups notably the Benghazi Revolutionaries Shura Council (BRSC). In 2015 the Islamic State group took advantage of the security situation in Libya and gained control over several cities, including Benghazi and Sirte. Since its establishment, BRSC is engaged in fierce clashes with the LNA over territorial control in the Oil Crescent region, as well as southern Libya.\n\nThe different NIACs in Libya are mainly taking place within a struggle for power, following the implosion of the country after the toppling of Gadhafi. It is generally recognised that the main actors in these conflicts are, on the one hand, the GNA and, on the other hand, the HoR, militarily supported by the LNA. They fight each other with countless local militias, which can be assigned to one camp or the other. . Furthermore, the Islamic State is party to NIACs in Libya. These actors and the armed conflicts they are party to will be analyzed in turn.\n\nLibyan National Army (LNA)\n\nAs aforementioned, in February 2014 the LNA appeared on the scene. On 16 May 2014 General Haftar launched Operation Dignity, which was conducted by the LNA. While at first this operation was meant to target only Islamist groups, it led to the outbreak of a number of parallel NIACs between several armed groups. Indeed, it was not only the Islamists who felt threatened, but also other groups, who saw Operation Dignity as an attempt to shift the balance of power in Libya in favour of former Gadhafi officials. Accordingly, on 13 July 2014, these armed groups launched a counter offensive, known as Operation Fajr (Dawn), in Tripoli against the LNA.\n\nOperation Dignity immediately received strong support from a variety of Libyan army units and local militias, such as: ‘the Benghazi-based Saiqa; air force units operating from Gamal Abdul El Nasser Air Base near Tobruk; air force units at Benina, Benghazi’s dual-use airport; the Army of Barqa (Jaysh Barqa or Cyrenaica Defense Force); the Baraghitha tribal armed formations under the command of Ibrahim Waqwaq; ethnic Tabu fighters from the southern city of Kufra; and Tuareg in the southwest region of Ubari;’ and Zintani militias. Operation Dawn comprised of the Misrata-based Libya Central Shield Force (25.000 to 40.000 troops, 800 tanks and 2.000 machine-gun mounted vehicles), Islamist-aligned militias from Tripoli, the Knights of Janzour militia, various Berber militias, and a brigade from the town of Zawiya (west of Tripoli) that was commanded by hardline Salafist Sheikh Shaaban Hadiya.\n\nOperation Dignity started with two days of air strikes in and around Benghazi, using MiG fighter jets and Mi25 attack helicopters. This was followed by a ground offensive with 6.000 troops clashing with Islamist forces, which in turn triggered retaliatory action by Islamist forces in Benghazi, who fired Grad rockets at Benina airport, an LNA stronghold from which airstrikes were launched. It was also reported that anti-aircraft artillery had been set up to counter LNA air attacks. Fighting in Benghazi further intensified on 23 May 2014, when Islamist militias fired rockets at the headquarters of the special unit of the Saiqa forces. Twenty civilians were wounded by a missile that missed its target. On 26 May 2014, Islamist forces bombed Benina Air Base from positions in Sidi Faraj.\n\nOperation Dignity and LNA also faced strong resistance in their operations in Tripoli. On 13 July 2014, Operation Dawn was launched to drive out Zintani militias who were aligned with General Haftar’s LNA and to gain control over Tripoli. The fighting was so fierce, forcing hundreds of families to flee, that the newly elected HoR, who was not in favour of Operation Dawn, decided to move to Tobruk. In November 2014, the Tobruk-based HoR endorsed Operation Dignity as an operation under the General Chief of Staff of the Libyan Army, Abd-al-Raziq al-Nazuri, which formally created two opposing centers of power: the HoR in Tobruk and the GNC, aligned with Operation Dawn, in Tripoli. It is important to note that General Haftar was appointed as Chief of Staff of the Libyan Army on 2 March 2015.\n\nDespite the UN-brokered Libyan Political Agreement (LPA), which ultimately failed, violence between the LNA and many other militias continued. Drawing its strength from a web of tribal alliances, Haftar’s LNA expanded its presence across central and eastern Libya, with the result that it controls about 70% of Libya's territory. The LNA advanced into the capital Tripoli in April 2019, despite facing fierce resistance from armed groups loyal to the GNA. Between mid-April and mid-May 2019, the LNA repeatedly carried out air and drone strikes against armed groups inside Tripoli and nearby towns such as Zawiya and Tajoura and against pro-GNA fighters on the front lines. In turn, the GNA has used its own small air force to strike at LNA-held areas, such as Qasr Ben Gashir.\n\nActing Special Representative and Head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL), Stephanie Williams, reported in a briefing to the UNSC on 19 May 2020 that, since the launch of General Haftar’s attack on Tripoli in April 2019, fighting had escalated ‘with an unprecedented increase in indirect fire in urban areas and a growing tide of suffering for civilians.’ At that moment, she stated that a million people were in need of humanitarian assistance including 400.000 internally displaced persons and 654.000 migrants, refugees and asylum seekers. In addition, 201.000 Libyans had to flee from their homes as a result from the attack on Tripoli and experiencing almost constant bombardment and frequent water and electricity cuts. The fact that the fighting continues to be fierce is also shown by the fact that between 1 January 2020 and 30 June 2020, UNSMIL reported 489 civilian casualties (150 deaths and 319 injured). Furthermore, attacks on hospitals, such as the al Khadra Hospital, and on camps for internally displaced persons and migrants, such as the camp in the al-Furnaj district in Tripoli, are reported. Moreover, both sides continue to get foreign assistance both in terms of advanced weaponry and equipment as well as in terms of mercenaries.\n\nDespite some announcements of a ceasefire, the fighting continued throughout 2020, albeit less intense. This was the result of the peace process set up by the UN and that resulted in a ceasefire agreement in October 2020, which included an agreement on the withdrawal of foreign forces, and the appointment of a new Government of National Unity (GNU) on 5 February 2021. Political tensions rise between the GNU and the HoR, aligned with the LNA. This led to a mobilization of forces in and around Tripoli in December 2021, to the concern of UNSMIL which stated that mobilization ‘could spiral into conflict.’\n\nIn its quest for power and influence in Libya, the LNA faced not only the GNA, but also several armed Islamist groups with strong local roots, such as: the Benghazi Revolutionary Shura Council, the Ajdabiya Revolutionaries Shura Council, the Derna Mujahidin Shura Council and Islamic State (IS).\n\nBenghazi Revolutionary Shura Council became one of LNA’s main opponents during Operation Dignity. It was founded on 20 June 2014 by some hardline Islamist groups who took advantage of the political vacuum that had engulfed Libya since 2011 to slowly increase their military capacity. It was a response to the launch of Operation Dignity by the LNA which was directed against the Islamist militias in Benghazi. The Benghazi Revolutionary Shura Council managed to seize control of Benghazi in July 2014. Consequently, this became an Islamic caliphate that fiercely resisted the LNA. On 5 July 2017, the LNA liberated Benghazi and took over power after 3 years of heavy fighting. This is evidenced by the report of 13000 families being forced to flee from Benghazi and the 6666 destroyed properties in Benghazi as a result of the conflict.\n\nHostilities between the Derna Mujahidin Shura Council and LNA started in 2014, at the outbreak of Operation Dignity in Benghazi. Their home base, Derna, was therefore considered to be a center of resistance against the LNA. The city was repeatedly under siege from 2016 onwards. However, the main military campaign of LNA against Derna only started on 7 May 2018. In reaction, the Derna Mujahidin Shura Council dissolved, and a new armed group was formed: the Derna Protection Forces (DPF). Fighting between both sides was very intense. Tens of civilians have been killed as a result of the use of indiscriminate shelling and the use of landmines. UNSMIL reported that the hostilities have forced over 2000 families to flee the city. In February 2019, the LNA took control of the city.\n\nIn sum, on account of the frequency of armed attacks and armed confrontations, the number of casualties, the number of people forced to flee ongoing hostilities, and the types of weapons and military equipment utilized, the required degree of intensity has been reached since July 2014. The fighting has continued unabated and hence, LNA is involved in several non-international armed conflicts in Libya against at least GNA, Benghazi Revolutionary Shura Council, the Derna Mujahidin Shura Council, and Islamic State (IS).\n\nGovernment of National Accord (GNA)\n\nThe GNA was created by the Libyan Political Agreement (LPA) in December 2015. Although the HoR initially agreed to this new institution, of which it would be the legitimate legislative authority, it eventually sided with the LNA and opposed the GNA.\n\nWhile the GNA took the upper hand territorially from LNA in 2016, this changed completely over the course of 2017. The UN-backed government in Tripoli – the GNA –became unable to assert much real influence outside Tripoli and its immediate environs. The GNA had to rely on the support of local and tribal militia including militias from Misrata (such as the Misratan Third Force/13th Brigade), Tripoli-based Special Deterrence Force, Tripoli Revolutionaries Brigade, and Petroleum Facilities Guard (PFG). Since April 2017, there was an unprecedented escalation in violence in southern Libya, including air strikes from rival air forces, another indication of ongoing power struggles.\n\nThe report of the UN Panel of Experts reveals that Al-Ghweil, PM of the GNA, challenged the Presidency Council’s attempts to constitute a Presidential Guard by creating the National Guard, composed of ‘anti-Government of National Accord’ armed groups from Misrata and Tripoli. The creation of this unit led to a series of armed clashes in Tripoli. Armed groups supporting Al-Ghweil, such as the National Guard, the Al-Marsa al-Kubra Brigade and groups supported by the former Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, clashed with groups from Tripoli, such as the Special Deterrence Force, the Abu Salim Brigade and the Tripoli Revolutionaries Brigade. From 3 June 2017, the Zintan Military Council appeared to have switched allegiance to the Government of Libya; prior to this date, especially during 2014 and 2015, the Zintanis had been an important constituent part of the Forces of the HoR. The GNA declared a state of emergency in September 2018, after dozens of people were killed in clashes between rival militia groups in the city's southern suburbs. The conflict slumbered on and confrontations between GNA and other militias continued. For example, they continued to fight with LNA for control of Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) and other regional oil fields.\n\nAs elaborated in the previous section, fighting between GNA and LNA intensified in April 2019 when LNA launched a military campaign to take control of Tripoli. The offensive faced strong resistance from the GNA affiliated fighters. The hostilities lasted 14 months and costed hundreds of lives. Eventually, under the auspices of the UN, peace talks were initiated which culminated in the ceasefire agreement of October 2020. The GNA then handed over power to the GNU in 2021, but remained present in the background. After the failed elections in December 2021, tensions are rising again, possibly leading to the outbreak of direct confrontations between the GNA and the LNA.\n\nThe Islamic State in Libya\n\nThe Islamic State gained control of Sirte and Derna in 2014 and then took advantage of the existing vacuum situation in Libya at the time. In 2015, the presence of the self-proclaimed Islamic State in Sirte and Derna further complicated the situation as the group fights both the forces loyal to the GNA and the LNA. In 2016, for example, the Misrata militias, loyal to the GNA, suffered severe losses in confrontations against the IS in Sirte and Derna. The GNA led by Fayez al-Serraj was the recipient of warring support from the United States of America in its fight against the Islamic State in 2016 and 2017. This military action against ISIS was successful in driving them out of Derna and Sirte in 2016.\n\nSubsequently, ISIS group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi urged them to make a stronger presence in Libya and get involved in the ongoing power struggle. In early 2017, several reports indicated that factions of ISIS fighters had been sighted around Sebratha and Sirte, despite having lost a significant proportion of their manpower. Furthermore, in July 2017 the Islamic State group was ejected from Benghazi after three years of fighting and in July 2018 Khalifa Haftar’s forces recaptured Derna, the last Islamist stronghold in the East and the only city in the region which hitherto remained outside his control. In January 2019, Khalifa Haftar also launched a new counterterrorism mission in Southern Libya which gave Haftar the opportunity to obtain greater territorial control in the area. They continue to claim regular attacks in 2020, 2021 and 2022, taking advantage of the continuing unstable political climate.\n\nOn account of the frequency of armed attacks and armed confrontations, the number of casualties, the number of people forced to flee ongoing hostilities, and the types of weapons and military equipment utilized, the required degree of intensity has been reached since 2014. The fighting has continued unabated and hence, ISIS is involved in a non-international armed conflicts against the Libyan Government and its affiliated armed groups as well as in a NIAC with the HoR/LNA and their affiliated armed groups.\n\nOrganization\n\nA series of indicative factors are used to assess whether armed groups exhibit the required degree of organization, such as the existence of a command structure and disciplinary rules and mechanisms, the ability to procure, transport, and distribute arms, the ability to plan, coordinate and carry out military operations, the ability to negotiate and conclude agreements, e.g. cease-fire or peace agreements. If the criterion of a minimum organization of the armed group is not fulfilled, there is no armed conflict.\n\nAs presented above, myriad of factional armed groups are active in Libya since 2014. Their fluidity and their shifting allegiance to broader coalitions and umbrella groups hamper an assessment of the degree of organization of most individual groups and the broader collective alliance to which they belong. Moreover, the disintegration, internal rivalries, factionalism, and changing nature of the multitude of armed groups operating at the local level make it a delicate exercise. For instance, in its 2015 report, the Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights reported that ‘fighters have received little training and do not operate with the appropriate discipline, command and control systems. Those factors have contributed to the indiscriminate nature of the many attacks.’\n\nNevertheless, the groups, alliances and their affiliates were able to sustain hostilities over a period of time, had access to heavy weaponry used in fighting, and at different times controlled territory. Since 2014, there were at least three different fronts in the armed conflict: a conflict between the government of Libya and the self-declared LNA and affiliated groups loyal to General Haftar; a conflict between the government of Libya and Islamic State groups; and a conflict between the LNA and other armed groups - including Derna Protection Force (DPF) and The Benghazi Revolutionaries Shura Council (BRSC). As indicated in the following paragraphs, some armed groups seem to have a hierarchical command structure and zones of operations, are able to recruit and train members, have the ability to speak in one voice and sign agreements (including cease-fire agreements, and other bilateral negotiations) and hence meet the organizational requirement for the purpose of conflict classification.\n\nLibyan National Army (LNA)\n\nThe LNA is an armed group active in Libya and represents the most potent military force which incorporates certain officers from the previous regular Libyan army. The LNA is also comprised of various tribal and regional-based armed groups. Led by General Khalifa Haftar, a former official of Muammar Gadhafi’s regime, the LNA emerged in 2014 after the launch of Operation Dignity against Islamist factions in Benghazi. On 2 March 2015 Haftar was appointed by the HoR as chief of Staff of the Libyan Army. Armed groups and political actors across much of western Libya (and some parts of eastern Libya) do not recognise the LNA. The LNA includes the Saiqa Special Forces, led by Wanis Bukhamada; the Omar al-Mukhtar Operations Room, which is fighting in Derna; and affiliated military units in the western and southern part of the country. Madkhalist and Salafist armed groups like the Tariq Ibn Ziyad Brigade and the al-Tawhid Brigade are also operating under its control. . The LNA was closely allied to the Zintan Military Council, which commanded a collection of militias from the town Zintan. Most recent estimates indicate that the LNA is composed of about 12,000 fighters. The LNA and its affiliates remain aligned to the HoR and resist the new unity government (the GNA.) Since 2017 it extended its territorial control in southern and eastern Libya, notably by seizing Benghazi in July 2017. Reportedly in March 2019, the Kani Brigade, which previously backed the GNA, joined the LNA, becoming the 9th Infantry Brigade. As of July 2019, the LNA is on the outskirts of Tripoli, trying to assert control over the capital and to dislodge the internationally recognized GNA.\n\nDerna Protection Force (DPF)\n\nDPF was created in December 2014, following the merger of Abu Salim Martyrs Brigade (ASMB), Jaysh al-Islami al-Libi (Islamic Army of Libya), and the Derna-branch of Ansar al-Sharia in Libya (ASL). The Derna Mujahideen Shura Council (DMSC) includes several Islamist armed groups in the eastern city of Derna; the most prominent being the Abu Salim Brigade, an Islamist group founded by former members of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG). Following the rise of the Islamic State Group in Derna in 2015, the DMSC clashed with and ousted ISIS militants from the eastern city, imposing its rule on Derna. In 2016, the LNA launched ‘Operation Volcano’ to take control of Derna. After the launch of the LNA’s final offensive to take control of the city in May 2018, the leader of the DMSC Atey al-Shaari announced the dissolution of the group and the establishment of the Derna Protection Force (DPF); ‘essentially a rebranding exercise aimed at sanitizing the DMSC and severing ties with Islamist groups’. The group has different training camps in Derna and the surrounding areas. Some of these camps have been targeted by Egyptian airstrikes in May 2017, as retaliation for the terrorist attack in Minya. In May 2018, DPF leader Al-Shaari announced that the group was willing to submit itself to the command of “Libyan army officers”, an apparent attempt to attract support from the Government of Libya in Tripoli; there was no indication that the Tripoli government acknowledged or accepted this offer. Though in 2019 the LNA announced that Derna is under its full control, there are still some pockets of resistance in the city.\n\nThe Benghazi Revolutionaries Shura Council (BRSC)\n\nThe BRSC is an umbrella group established in 2014 to defend Benghazi against the ‘Operation Dignity’ launched by General Khalifa Haftar against Islamist factions in the city. It includes several groups, ranging from the revolutionary brigades – such as the February 17th Martyrs Brigade, the Rafallah al-Sahati Brigade and Libya Shield No.1, led by the prominent Islamist commander Wissam Ben-Hamid – to more extremist groups like Ansar al-Sharia Libya (ASL) or those with links to the Islamic State group. Recruitment by the BRSC from Misratah continued until at least January 2017. In December 2017, Haftar announced that the eastern city was under the total control of his forces. Since then, the group has been inactive, although sporadic terrorist attacks might indicate the continued presence of BRSC sleeper cells in Benghazi. Most of the BRSC militants ousted from the eastern city swelled the ranks of other Islamist-leaning groups, such as the Benghazi Defence Brigades (BDB) and the DPF.\n\nThe Islamic State and its affiliates in Libya\n\nSome armed groups have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group in Derna and Sirte. The first signs of ISIS’ presence emerged in 2014 when the organisation gained a foothold in the eastern city of Derna. Then, ISIS found more fertile ground in Sirte, which it had taken over by early 2015. Following clashes on the outskirts of Misrata in May 2016, the GNA launched an offensive to oust ISIS from Sirte. Misrata militias composed the backbone of ‘Operation Solid Structure (Bunyan Marsous)’, enabling to retake control, in December 2016, of the ISIS stronghold with the crucial support of the United States Africa Command (AFRICOM), which launched at least 495 airstrikes in Sirte. The end of the battle of Sirte meant the end of the territorial dimension of ISIS in Libya. However, many ISIS militants managed to flee the city, heading towards the valleys nearby and regrouping. ISIS maintains a presence in the areas south of Sirte, between Bani Walid, Waddan and Jufra. Despite conflicting reports about the number of ISIS militants in Libya, it is thought that the jihadist group maintains a considerable presence. According to a 2018 UN report on ISIS, al-Qaeda and associated individuals and entities, there are between 3,000 and 4,000 ISIS members across Libya.\n\nIn relation to the intervention of foreign forces into the conflict in Libya, the UN’s envoy to Libya Ghassan Salame has recently stated that Libya has become ‘a textbook example of foreign interference today in local conflicts. In 2019, a military adviser in General Khalifa Haftar’s forces revealed that Egyptian, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and French military forces, as well as security advisers, are currently present in eastern Libya, to support Haftar’s campaign against Tripoli and protect oil fields from attacked by government forces.\n\nUnited States\n\nUpon the invitation of the UN-backed Government of Libya (GNA), the United States launched a sustained air operation against the Islamic State group in Libya on 1 August 2016 to drive the group out of its stronghold Sirte. Previously, the United States had already conducted isolated airstrikes against Islamic State group targets in Libya. The intervention took place with the consent of Libya and thus does not change the classification of the conflict against the Islamic State group as non-international. The validity of the consent can be questioned as there are competing governments in Libya. However, the GNA is internationally recognized including by the UNSC as the sole legitimate government of Libya and thus considered to be capable of providing valid consent. There are reports suggesting that American, British, French and Italian Special Forces had taken part in operations against ISIS in Libya, although their numbers have been much reduced since Sirte was retaken from the Islamists.\n\nAlthough the United States announced an end to its air campaign after the eviction of the Islamic State group from Sirte in December 2016, further airstrikes were carried out in January 2017. Also in November 2017, the United States carried out a series of precision airstrikes against the Islamic State group. According to the United States, the strikes were carried out in coordination with the GNA. The US still continues to carry out air strikes against Islamic State-affiliated groups and other groups such as Al Qaeda in southern Libya in coordination with the GNA. Hence, the United States is a party to non-international armed conflict by virtue of these airstrikes.\n\nTurkey\n\nTurkey supports the GNA, supplying drones, weapons and trucks to boost its efforts in the ongoing conflict with General Haftar's forces, which control most of the east and south of Libya. It is also reported that groups fighting against Haftar recently received a high-profile delivery of Turkish-made BMC Kirpi armoured trucks and other weaponry from Turkey. It was claimed that the Turkish aircraft ‘provided air cover’ and bombed LNA positions in the fight for Gharyan, a strategic town south of the capital, which is now centred by the GNA. Following this incident, Major General Ahmed al-Mesmari, spokesperson of the LNA, told reports that ‘orders have been given to the air force to target Turkish ships and boats in Libyan territorial waters,’ and that ‘Turkish strategic sites, companies and projects belonging to the Turkish state (in Libya) are considered legitimate targets’. Moreover, it was indicated that drones made in Turkey have been playing a significant role in Tripoli front line; and there are also persistent rumours that Turkish personnel are operating the vehicles and training Libyans. It was also reported that Turkey sent over hundred officers and two thousand Syrian militants to Libya in support of the GNA. Based on these facts, it could be concluded that Turkey is a party to the non-international armed conflict between GNA and LNA in support of the former.\n\nEgypt\n\nEgypt launched airstrikes against the Islamic State group and other Islamist groups in Libya in 2014, 2015 and 2017 in response to the killings of Coptic Christians. Egypt supports the self-declared LNA of General Haftar and it does not appear that the GNA consented to these airstrikes. If undertaken without consent, which appears to be the case, these airstrikes amount to short-lived international armed conflicts between Libya and Egypt. In parallel, when conducting these strikes, Egypt was arguably involved in a NIAC against the Islamist groups it targeted in support of the LNA. Nevertheless, since 2017, there have been no public reports concerning continued military support from Egypt to the LNA, other than providing weapons and political support, and hence it would be doubtful whether Egypt’s involvement continues to meet the threshold required to qualify it as a party to a NIAC in Libya.\n\nFrance\n\nFrance officially recognises the GNA, and as recently as September 2018, France publicly supported the GNA ‘as the sole legitimate government of Libya, with Prime Minister Fayez Serraj as the leader of the Presidency Council’. At the same time, among European states it is the most openly supportive of Haftar, and has maintained close relations with him since 2015. France has reportedly been providing decisive military support to Haftar’s LNA since 2015. It has deployed advisers and Special Forces to the east of Libya, as publicly acknowledged in July 2016 after three French Special Forces soldiers were killed in a helicopter crash near Benghazi. It is reported that France has provided the LNA with military advisers, clandestine operatives, and special force units – elements not provided to the GNA. France has not denied its support for Field Marshal Haftar but instead has suggested that its support is not in favour of one Libyan faction over another.\n\nIn addition, France blocked EU efforts to condemn Field Marshal Haftar’s military assault on the GNA on Tripoli and instead called for a ceasefire but not the withdrawal of LNA forces. In turn, the GNA has recently notified that it will no longer engage in bilateral discussions with France. On the basis of these reports, and if the personnel deployed by France to support the LNA is undertaking actions related to the conduct of hostilities, France may be involved in one or several non-international armed conflicts in Libya in support of LNA. Provided that France’s military involvement in the territory of Libya takes place without the consent of the government of Libya (the UN-backed GNA), a parallel IAC would exist between Libya and France.\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\n\nSince 2014, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has been strengthening Haftar’s military capabilities, as well as his political support base and international standing. The UAE is providing Haftar with a variety of military equipment, including armoured personnel carriers and even aircraft. UAE has also built facilities at al-Khadim airbase, near the north-eastern Libyan city of Marj and Haftar’s headquarters at el-Rajma, which is being used to deploy Wing Loong drones that were vital to Haftar’s military successes in Benghazi and Derna, and to his further efforts to maintain control over eastern Libya.\n\nIt is also reported that the UAE has tasked a U.S. private military firm with operating a squadron of aircraft in Libya, to help Haftar maintain battlefield superiority and gain control of more territory. Since Haftar began his advance on Tripoli, there have been series of UAE-linked drone strikes on Tripoli. It is reported that the UAE deployed six IOMAX AT-802U Air Tractors and three Wing Loong II drones at Al-Khadim airfield in al-Marj in eastern Libya in 2016. Moreover, the UAE has been accused of backing the LNA on the front line, providing strategic advice and targeting assistance to facilitate precise airstrikes. Following a report by the UN experts investigating missile strikes (‘a Blue Arrow air-to-surface missile’) near Libya's capital which points to possible involvement by the UAE, the UAE’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a short statement to say that it ‘denied ownership of weapons found in the Republic of Libya’. As a result of these direct support which contributes to LNA’s collective conduct of hostilities and thus directly impacts on the GNA’s military operations, the UAE has been a party to the pre-existing non-international armed conflict between these forces and al-Shabaab under the ‘support-based approach’ proposed by the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\nRussia\n\nSince 2014, there have been widespread reports that Russia has provided military assistance to Haftar in the form of advisers, training, and the maintenance of Russian weaponry through the Wagner Group- a private military contractor. Recently, there have been rumours of a Russian military presence in Haftar controlled areas such as the oil crescent, which Moscow may have deployed to benefit from illicit sales and Haftar’s forward operating bases in western Libya. In August 2021, a BBC investigation revealed links between the Wagner Group and the Russian military. Ilya Barabanov and Nader Ibrahim, However, it seems to be premature to conclude that the Wagner Group acts by instruction of Russia. If this would be the case, this Russian involvement in Libya in support of the LNA and causing harm to the GNA would make it a party to the armed conflict under the support-based approach of the ICRC. Nevertheless, from the publicly available information, it is difficult to conclude that Russia’s involvement in Libya in support of LNA would make it a party to the armed conflict.\n\nIn addition to providing this material support, Russia blocked on 7 April 2019 a UNSC statement intended to voice opposition to Haftar’s offensive; which suggests that Russia is now coming down harder on his side. However, recently, Russia’s deputy foreign minister in charge of Middle Eastern affairs, Mikhail Bogdanov, argued that Russia is not taking sides on the Libyan conflict."
