Lindsey was a member of Fleetwood Mac from 1975 to 1987 when the pop-oriented act also featured Christine McVie and Stevie Nicks, his sometimes girlfriend. The band’s second album with Buckingham and Nicks, 1977’s Rumours, produced four U.S. Top 10 singles (including Nicks’ song “Dreams”) and is the fourth-highest-selling album of all time. In Fleetwood Mac’s heyday, Buckingham was known for his finger-picking guitar style and wide vocal range As a member of Fleetwood Mac, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998.

Her 1986 Academy Award nomination for Aliens is considered a landmark in the recognition of science fiction, action and horror genres, as well as a major step in challenging traditional gender roles in cinema. Weaver progressively received fame for her numerous contributions to the science fiction film history (including minor roles in Futurrama, WALL-E, Paul and The Cabin in the Woods), earning the nickname of “The Sci-Fi Queen.” She also played the lead role as Secretary of State Elaine Barrish on USA Network’s Political Animals miniseries.Weaver has been nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Actress for Aliens and Gorillas in the Mist: The Story of Dian Fossey, and Best Supporting Actress for Working Girl.

Born in Tel Aviv, Netanyahu is the first Israeli prime minister born in Israel after the state’s establishment. In 2012, he was listed 23rd on the Forbes magazine’s list of “The World’s Most Powerful People.” In 2010 and 2012, he was ranked first on the list the “Most Influential Jews in the World” by The Jerusalem Post. After joining the Israel Defense Forces during the Six-Day War in 1967, he took part in many missions and achieved the rank of captain. After he was discharged, Netanyahu served as the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations from 1984 to 1988 and became prime minister in June 1996, serving until to July 1999. After he was defeated by Ehud Barak, he joined the private sector.In 2002 Netanyahu returned to politics as foreign affairs minister (2002–2003) and finance minister (2003–2005) in Ariel Sharon’s governments but departed over disagreements regarding the Gaza disengagement plan. He retook the Likud leadership in December 2005, after Sharon left to form a new party. Following the 2009 parliamentary election, in which Likud placed second and right-wing parties won a majority, Netanyahu formed a coalition government.

In 1991, he married Kris Kardashian and can be seen as the stepfather of the Kardashian siblings on the cable television reality series, Keeping Up with the Kardashians since 2007. He has also been a businessman. His company, Bruce Jenner Aviation, sells aircraft supplies to executives and corporations.\n\nBe Prepared for Medicare AEP\n\nThe Boy Scouts motto is dead on: “Be Prepared!” However, for many of us, procrastination is much easier because it takes less time (in fact, it takes no time). With the Medicare Annual Enrollment Period (AEP) rapidly approaching (Oct 15 – Dec 7) it is going to be vitally important for you to be prepared. And since procrastinating is the path of least resistance, I am going to make this easy on you by giving you a single step that will go a long way in helping you be prepared for the upcoming AEP. I know that insurance is at the top of everyone’s “Most Interesting Topics” list, so do your best to stick with me.\n\nThe first step is Know What You Have. If you don’t know what type of Medicare Health Plan you have, you are an easy target for being taken advantage of. There are 2 major types of Medicare Health Plans:\n\nMedicare Supplement plans\n\nMedicare Advantage plans\n\nThese 2 types of plans are very different when it comes to how they work and the benefits they provide, but they are extremely misunderstood by policyholders. I often hear from policyholders, “I have a Medicare Supplement,” when in fact they have a Medicare Advantage plan. So what is the big difference between these plans?\n\nMedicare Supplement Plans:\n\nWork in unison with Traditional Medicare Parts A & B: A supplement policy will pay most, if not all, of what Medicare does not pay. It acts as a secondary insurance.\n\nDo not have networks: They are not HMO or PPO plans so you are free to use any doctor or hospital that you want as long as they accept Medicare.\n\nAre funded entirely by policyholder premiums: This is important as it allows companies to keep benefits the same from year to year.\n\nTravel with you in all 50 states: Your plan works the same out of state as it does in your home state.\n\nMedicare Advantage Plans:\n\nWork in replacement of Traditional Medicare Parts A & B: An advantage plan works in place of Medicare as your primary insurance and you do not have a secondary insurance. You are responsible for all deductibles, copays and coinsurance. And you don’t get out of paying your Medicare Part B premium.\n\nAre network plans: They are HMO and PPO plans so you may be restricted in the doctors and hospitals you are allowed to use.\n\nAre funded by Government subsidies and policyholder premiums: This is critical because as government subsidies are reduced, plan premiums will go up and benefits will go down, as has been the case for the past 7 years and I expect to be the case in the years ahead.\n\nMay not cover you in other states (except in emergency cases): Many advantage plans only cover you in the case of an emergency if you are outside of your home state.\n\nThe biggest advantage in advantage plans has been the lower premiums. But as government subsidies have been reduced in years past, this benefit has been greatly diminished. For example, in 2007 you could get a Medicare Advantage PPO plan for a $0/month premium and your maximum annual out of pocket expense was $2,000. For 2014 that same plan has a $50/month premium and maximum annual out of pocket of $5,100 (for Shelby county plans).\n\nAs you can see, there is a big difference between these two types of plans. Know What You Have…because you may not be able to get your old plan back.\n\nSeniormark will be sponsoring a workshop on September 11 at 5:30 pm at their office in Troy. “Solving the Medicare Puzzle” lays out the different parts of Medicare, and then will show you how the pieces fit together.

If so, you are in very good company!!\n\nAugust 22- Diana Nyad, first gained national attention in 1975 when she swam around Manhattan (28 miles). In 1979, she swam from the Bahamas to Juno Beach, Fla. (102 miles), setting a distance record for non-stop swimming without a wetsuit, which still stands today. In 2013, on her fifth attempt and at age 64, she became the first person confirmed to swim from Cuba to Florida without the aid of a shark cage, swimming from Havana to Key West (110 miles). Nyad began her swimming career in high school. Shortly after she was introduced to marathon swimming, she set a women’s world record in her first race, a 10-mile swim in Lake Ontario in July 1970.Nyad is also a writer and has authored three books, including Other Shores (1978) about her life and distance swimming. She has also written for The New York Times, NPR’s “All Things Considered,” Newsweek magazine and other publications. She hosted the public radio program “The Savvy Traveler,” was a commentator on the “business of sport” for American Public Media’s public radio program Marketplace business news and was a regular contributor to the CBS News television show Sunday Morning.

She also won two Golden Globe Awards for the role. Long reprised her role as Diane Chambers in four episodes of the spinoff Frasier, for which she received an additional guest star Emmy nomination. Long’s interest in acting was evident as a member of her high school speech team in Indiana, winning an award in 1967 for original oratory. After studying drama at Northwestern University, she joined The Second City comedy troupe in Chicago. In 1975, she began writing, producing and co-hosting the local NBC television program Sorting It Out, which won three Regional Emmys for Best Entertainment Show. Her first notable role came in the 1979 television movie The Cracker Factory, in which she played opposite Natalie Wood. In 1980 she appeared in her first feature film role in A Small Circle of Friends, followed by roles in both TV shows and movies, including Night Shift (1982) and Losin’ It (1983). While on Cheers, she starred in several movies, including Irreconcilable Differences (1984), for which she was nominated for a Best Leading Actress Golden Globe, The Money Pit and Hello Again. In 1990, Long returned to television for the ABC miniseries Voices Within: The Lives of Truddi Chase. This introduced her to more dramatic roles in TV films, after which she starred in several more throughout the ‘90s. In recent years, she has guest starred in several TV shows, including Boston Legal and Modern Family, and in several TV films such as Honeymoon with Mom, Falling in Love with the Girl Next Door and Holiday Engagement.\n\nAugust 25 – Gene Simmons, the blood-spouting member of the band Kiss, was born as Chaim Witz in Israel and later changed his name after his mother, a Hungarian immigrant and the only member of her family to survive the Holocaust, immigrated to the United States. As a young boy, he developed an interest in horror and science fiction, but the Beatles phenomenon inspired a stronger urge to become a musician, and he joined a series of bands. In 1973, with fellow musician Paul Stanley, he founded Kiss. By the end of 1975 Kiss had become one of the biggest acts in the country. Nicknamed “the demon,” Simmons took the stage clad in stylized armor and spiked platform boots, with his face elaborately painted in white and black. Bursts of flame and generous amounts of fake blood regularly featured in his performance. In the late 1970s and early 80s, Simmons branched out into other aspects of the entertainment business, including starting his own label (which was unsuccessful), producing and acting, including roles in movies (Runaway, 1984; Never Too Young To Die, 1986) and television (Miami Vice).For most of the ‘80s and ‘90s Kiss remained active, while Simmons kept himself busy in the ‘00s launching a magazine, publishing his autobiography, creating a clothing line and re-establishing his record label. In 2004, he released his second solo album. Simmons advocates for ChildFund International and has traveled to Zambia to visit several of his sponsored children, of whom he has more than 140.\n\nAugust 31 – Richard Gere, the son of Mayflower descendants, started his acting career in theater. His first big role in movies was in the thriller Looking for Mr. Goodbar (1977), followed by the leading role in the 1978 film, Days of Heaven.

In 1980 he became a major star with the film American Gigolo, followed in 1982 by the romantic drama An Officer and a Gentleman with Debra Winger. In the 1980s, Gere had several box office failures but success returned in 1990 with Internal Affairs and Pretty Woman.

Let me use a story here to make a point. Suppose you are shopping for a new refridgerator. Your first stop is at Sears where you find the perfect Frigidaire XL2014, and at a great price, $2100. But because your parents told you to shop before you buy, you decide to check a few more places. The last stop you make is at Lowes, where you find the same Frigidaire XL2014. Same make, same model, same features…they are IDENTICAL! Only the one at Lowes costs $1500. Do you go back to Sears and buy the one for $2100? Unless you own stock in Sears, or your son is the sales rep, I hope your response is…Absolutely not! Why would you spend $600 more on the same thing. But Retirees are doing that very thing with their Medicare Supplement insurance.\n\nBut you may ask, “How do I know I’m getting the same benefits?” The answer is simple, our government did something right. Prior to 1992, Medicare Supplement insurance plans were not standardized. What this meant was that each insurance company’s Medicare supplement plans offered different benefits. This made it almost impossible for the Retiree to shop their coverage from company to company. Compare it to shopping for a car today. You can’t really compare cost from one dealer to another because the options are completely different. This one has leather seats, but the other one has On-Star. This one has a DVD player, but the other one has alloy wheels. It is impossible to truly compare cost because you are never comparing “apples to apples.” The same was true with Medicare Supplement insurance prior to 1992. But in 1992 the federal government stepped in and “standardized” Medicare Supplement insurance.\n\nThey did this because prior to 1992, unethical salespeople were taking coverage away from Retirees in order to save them money, and they weren’t disclosing the fact that they reduced their coverage. So the government stepped in and standardized the plans so this couldn’t happen anymore. They did this by offering 11 plans and giving them the letter names of A through N. In other words, it means you can compare a Plan F with one company to a Plan F with another company and know that the benefits are IDENTICAL. So you no longer have to say, “I know my supplement is expensive, but I don’t want to change it because it pays so well.” As long as you stick with the same Plan letter name, the new company is legally obligated to pay the same benefits as your old one.\n\nSo what does this mean for you? It means it would be a good idea to know what premium you pay compared to what others your age and in your area are paying for the same plan. This is important because you may be paying hundreds if not thousands of dollars more per year in premium and not be getting any better benefits. For example, the premiums for a Plan F for a 70 year old female range from $130/month on the low end up to $276/month on the high end. That’s a difference of $1,752 per year. And worse yet, the person paying $276/month is not getting any better benefits than the person paying $130. And don’t forget, you can change your medicare supplement policy any time of the year…you don’t have to wait for the Annual Enrollment Period at the end of the year.\n\nIf you would like to see how your premium compares, you can go to our website at www.seniormark.com and click on the “Supplement Rates” tab. And don’t worry, you will get instant numbers and we won’t collect your personal information. If you are not tech savvy just call us at 877-492-8803 and we will provide you with a free comparison report.\n\nI bet your momma never thought shopping would be this easy!\n\nJune 10- Kevin “Moochie” Corcoran, is a director, producer and former child actor who appeared in numerous Disney projects between 1957 and 1963.
