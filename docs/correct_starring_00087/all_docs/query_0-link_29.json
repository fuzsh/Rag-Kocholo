        "text": "Who you gonna call? It seems like Sigourney Weaver isn’t on that call list.\n\nAs we gear for yet another Ghostbusters entry, a direct sequel to the 2021 film Ghostbusters: Afterlife, the cast begins to round out, and we see which legacy characters will reappear. Sadly, it seems like Weaver will not return, reprising her role of Dana Barrett.\n\nDuring a recent interview with Collider, Weaver revealed she won’t return for the upcoming sequel, saying she never got a call from the filmmakers. “I wasn’t asked to be in this Ghostbusters,” says the actress. “And I think, you know, a little of us goes a long way.”\n\nWeaver first appeared in 1984’s Ghostbusters, cementing her further into the lives of horror fans while still showing her comedy range. She would appear in the 1989 sequel, Ghostbusters II. Since then, she’s only made cameo appearances for the franchise in 2016’s Ghostbusters: Answer the Call and the aforementioned 2021 requel.\n\nLittle is known about the Afterlife sequel, which is still untitled, but there are plans to return to New York City and the iconic firehouse made famous in the original Ghostbusters."
