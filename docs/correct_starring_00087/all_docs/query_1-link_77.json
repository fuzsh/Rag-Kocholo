        "text": "In Hollywood, casting decisions can make or break a movie. Sometimes, the biggest roles almost end up in different hands, which changes the story. Take Ghostbusters, for example, the classic film with the guys chasing ghosts. Well, imagine if Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts were carrying those proton packs! Alongside them, crazy, right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe all know the Ghostbusters crew, isn’t that so? However, they might have looked totally different. Back in ’84, Ivan Reitman dropped this flick about a ghost-catching scientist in New York City, and it blew up. Fans and critics couldn’t get enough of it. Then, in 1989, a sequel was released, but it did not quite hit the same high notes.\n\nAttempts to make a third Ghostbusters film persevered for quite a while, yet hit a roadblock with Harold Ramis’ passing in 2014. Paul Feig’s 2016 reboot of the franchise featured an all-female team with nods to the originals. Sadly, cast members faced online backlash and harsh criticism for the female-led approach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurther, Ghostbusters: Afterlife was Sony’s new start instead of a planned sequel. This new flick follows Trevor and Phoebe, played by Finn Wolfhard and Mckenna Grace. Set in Summerville, Oklahoma, the film spans old and new, with appearances from the first cast. However, imagine a scenario where there’s another cast; it’s interesting to explore which famous people almost played the Ghostbuster’s main characters.\n\n1. Julia Roberts\n\nJulia Roberts auditioned for Dana Barrett but she didn’t get the part. The Ghostbusters team was won over by Sigourney Weaver’s comedic skills during the audition, despite their initial reservations about her suitability for the role. If we talk about the character Dana Barrett, a cellist, who turns to the Ghostbusters when strange things happen to her, especially in her fridge.\n\n2. Michael Keaton\n\nMichael Keaton got the opportunity to play Spengler but declined, driving the studio to consider different actors like Christopher Walken, John Lithgow, Christopher Lloyd, and Jeff Goldblum. Initially, Harold Ramis expected to co-compose the script with Dan Aykroyd but ended up portraying Spengler himself, feeling it fit him best.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Tom Hanks\n\nTom Hanks was approached for the role of Peter Venkman, a Columbia University Professor with skills in parapsychology and psychology. Venkman, known for his mockery and flirtatious nature, changes skepticism to belief in ghosts. Bill Murray ultimately portrayed Venkman, though, the role was initially planned for John Belushi. Hanks, along with Chevy Chase and Steve Guttenberg, passed on the opportunity.\n\n4. Eddie Murphy\n\nWhen the Ghostbusters were overwhelmed with work, they required extra help, and Winston Zeddemore was the person they got last. He wasn’t a brainiac like the rest of the group, however, he was down for the gig as long as the paychecks were rolling in.\n\nEddie Murphy was approached to play him, but he passed, which prompted a few changes in the script. However, in the end, Ernie Hudson had to hustle through a bunch of auditions, before securing the role.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. John Candy\n\nLouis Tully, a bookkeeper, and Dana’s neighbor got possessed by a devil named Vinz Clortho, causing all sorts of hardship. They wanted John Candy for the role but his thoughts didn’t quite fit. So, the script ended up going to Rick Moranis, who acknowledged it and said he totally got the person.\n\n6. Sandra Bernhard\n\nJanine Melnitz, the Ghostbusters‘ secretary and confidante, might have been played by another person. Sandra Bernhard was offered the role, but she turned it down. Thus, Annie Potts ended up with the part and accidentally made Janine’s quirky look by snagging a few glasses from the set.\n\n7. Paul Reubens\n\nPaul Reubens declined the role of Gozer in Ghostbusters, the main antagonist. Gozer was supposed to be serious, but Reubens’s style wasn’t up to the task. However, everything turned out well for Ghostbusters in the end. The last projecting decisions helped make the film a hit and abandoned an enduring heritage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite some hiccups along the way, Ghostbusters ended up fine and dandy. The actors they ended up with helped the film’s success and left a lasting mark on cinematic history."
