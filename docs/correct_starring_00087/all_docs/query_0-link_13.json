Very Fine Condition.\n\nOriginal Columbia Pictures Advance One Sheet Poster (27x41) for the Ivan Reitman adventure comedy, GHOSTBUSTERS II (1989) starring Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Harold Ramis, and Rick Moranis. Almost all of the members of cast from the original film as well as Director Reitman returned to make this sequel. Five years after the events of the first film, Dana (Weaver) begins to have ghost problems again. The film is a strong sequel and is almost as much fun as the original. This original one sheet poster is rolled and in very fine condition.\n\nIVAN REITMAN - Director\n\nBill Murray - Actor\n\nDan Aykroyd - Actor\n\nHAROLD RAMIS - Actor\n\nRICK MORANIS - Actor\n\nErnie Hudson - Actor"
