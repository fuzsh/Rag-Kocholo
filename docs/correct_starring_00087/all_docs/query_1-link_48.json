        "text": "Doc Martin is one of ITV1’s most successful comedy dramas to date, having first started in 2004 – but do you know all the brilliant guest stars in the TV series?\n\nFans will probably be able to tell you that Hollywood actress Sigourney Weaver has appeared in TWO episodes of Doc Martin.\n\nBut what about the others?\n\nHere are our top guest stars who have appeared in Doc Martin from 2004 to the final ever series in 2022.\n\nDoc Martin guest stars: Sigourney Weaver played Beth Traywick\n\nSigourney Weaver guest starred in Doc Martin season 7 and 8.\n\nYes, you DID read that right!\n\nThe Hollywood actress, famed for her roles in Alien, Ghostbusters and Gorillas in the Mist, first played Beth Traywick in the episode entitled Facta Non Verba.\n\nAlthough, at the time, her character was simply billed as “American Tourist”.\n\nIn 2015, Sigourney Weaver turns up in Portwenn as a stubborn American tourist.\n\nShe demands prescription-only medicine at the pharmacist – but Mrs Tishell refuses to comply.\n\nPushy Beth then takes her demands to Doc Martin and, well, you can imagine what happens next!\n\nAmerican tourist Beth returned a year later in 2017, in the episode All My Trials.\n\nShe arrives in the village and flatters Mrs Tishell into helping her trace her family tree.\n\nActress Sigourney, 72, was persuaded to take the role by her good Selina Cadell, who plays Mrs Tishell.\n\nThe two met as girls at drama school in London during 1972, and have stayed friends ever since.\n\nBy chance, Sigourney also appeared on The Jonathan Ross Show with Martin Clunes and told him she had always meant to visit her friend in Cornwall.\n\nMartin’s producer wife Philippa Braithwaite then asked Sigourney if she’d like a cameo.\n\nSigourney also admits that “Avatar reworked their schedules so I could be there”.\n\nSigourney has British heritage in real life, too.\n\nRead more: McDonald & Dodds series 3 episode 1 cast: Who guest stars in Belvedere on

Romance.\n\nIn the later episode, she clashes with Doc Martin who is planning a move to London, despite recently becoming a dad.\n\nHe’s not impressed with his replacement, the village doctor Diana Dibbs.\n\nMainly because she seems to have several medical ailments of her own to take care of!\n\nWhen he sees the types of prescriptions she’s handing out to everyone who visits her, he begins to
