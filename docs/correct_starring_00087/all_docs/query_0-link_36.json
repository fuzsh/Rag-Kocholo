        "text": "Hello Bombers! It’s time to celebrate the one year anniversary of the Not A Bomb podcast. This week, Brad and Troy discuss Ghostbusters 2, which was actually the catalyst for the podcast. Released five years after the original, Ghostbuster 2 brings back all of our beloved characters while introducing quirky, new ones (we’re looking at you, Dr. Janosz Poha). Our heroes battle rivers of slime, New York bureaucracy, diapers, and the villainous Vigo the Carpathian.\n\nFailing to out gross the original film, Ghostbuster 2 was panned by critics who felt the film too closely resembled the plot of the first movie and the characters lacked any charm or wit. Brad and Troy use the two hour podcast runtime to debunk the haters and prove, once and for all, that Ghostbusters 2 is one of the best sequels in the industry!\n\nSpecial shoutout to all of the listeners who have made the first year of this podcast so special. Additionally, Brad and Toy would like to thank all of our guests for taking time to appear on our show and share their love for movies that bombed at the box office!\n\nGhostbusters 2 is directed by Ivan Reitman and stars Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, and Peter MacNicol.\n\nIf you want to leave feedback or suggest a movie bomb, please drop us a line at NotABombPod@gmail.com.
