        "text": "“Ghostbusters: Afterlife” is a good film that is honors the prior 2 films it functions as a sequel too and to those involved in those films who have passed way (Harold Ramis and Ivan Reitman). It succeeds in this and the new cast does a good job. It is really only in some of the writing and pacing that keeps it from being great it is still a film worth checking out if you enjoyed the original film.\n\nThe film was directed by Jason Reitman who co-wrote the film with Gil Kenan.\n\nThe story follows the single mother Callie Spengler (Carrie Coon) and her two children who inherit her father, Dr. Egon Spenglar’s farm in Summerville and must uncover the mystery that surrounded his original leaving of New York to move there.\n\nSPOILERS ahead\n\nThe Pros:\n\nThe Setup – The film starts out with Egon fighting one of the minions of Gozer who kills him before he traps it. It is a good hook and establishes that he came to Summerville and made a farm for a reason. After this we meet his daughter and grandkids who either never knew him or who he abandoned. The relationship stakes are high and we learn from Janice all Egon had was debt before he died.\n\nThe World – The world builds upon the cult of Gozer and we see that the man Ivo Shandor who built the apartment that Gozer was originally summoned from in 1984 basically owned Summerville and built a Temple to Gozer in the abandoned mine. There are ghost stories around the mine and we see it is a hotspot for ghosts. The world is neat and captures the ghost meets the real of the original film and sets up there is more supernatural threats out there.\n\nThe Characters – The characters are the strongest part and I’ll get into the different teams and who shows up as it made the film.\n\nGary – Paul Rudd plays Gary the summer school teacher and man investigating the mysterious quakes in Summerville. Eventually one of Gozer’s hounds possess him as he becomes one of their Guardians to summon them in the world. He is a great partner to Callie Spengler and a good teacher to her kids Trevor and Phoebe. This is one of Paul Rudd’s more serious roles and his comedy doesn’t come up that much.\n\nThe New Team – Phoebe, who is a lot like Egon in personality, her friend Podcast, her brother Trevor and Trevor’s friend Lucky are the new Ghostbusters in this. McKenna Grace’s Phoebe is the standout role as she is the one who brings the team together through Egon’s ghost guiding her to all the gear. Se is all the one to call the original Ghostbuster’s number which brings them in for the final battle when they figure out Egon’s plan to defeat Gozer and put into action after Gozer has returned to the world again. None of the characters are annoying and the dynamic among the group worked.\n\nThe Old Team – The survivors of the old team show up with Winston who is a millionare, Venkman who went back into academia and Ray who kept the lights on for the old office after Egon left with all their gear. Murray, Aykroyd and Hudson are all great even if some of the jokes drag a bit near the end. They have chemistry with each other still and them getting to say good-bye to Egon and help beat Gozer again was fantastic payoff. We get after-credits scenes of a married Venkman and Dana and Winston bringing the Ghostbusters car back to New York and us seeing the flashing red light of future threats for the Ghostbusters to face.\n\nDr. Egon Spengler – This film is Egon’s story and you see all the lives he touched and how hard it was for him to connect to people. His master plan succeeds and he gets to say good-bye to the original team and see his grandchildren and make peace with his daughter. It is touching and well done.\n\nOkay:\n\nThe Gozer Story – The Gozer Cult did nothing to prepare for Gozer’s return beyond the Temple and Gozer’s full power is not on display. They depend way too much on electricity and their dogs rather than the powerful magic we saw in the original film. Still, the threat was felt so not a con though it doesn’t compare to how great Gozer’s original threat and appearance was.\n\nThe Cons:\n\nPacing – This movie could have been shorter as it does drag at the beginning and end. I get why it slowed down but some scenes were repeats or dragged and it kept the film from being great.\n\nCallie Spengler – Callie is a flat character. She hats her dad for abandoning her and loves her kids but we don’t get any defining personality traits or goals. She mostly exists to give Egon a redemption story.\n\nSome of the Jokes – When the classic Ghostbusters show up there is some riffing that goes on way too long and drags down the threat of Gozer and drama of the scene.\n\nThis was a good but flawed film that is well worth checking out if you enjoyed the original 2 films. This film is a send-up to those but especially the original film and it does a great job honoring Harold Ramis and Ivan Rietman. I would recommend checking it out and I’m curious what stories might come net.\n\nFinal Score: 8.5 / 10\n\n“Galaxy Quest” is one of the greatest honoring of sci. fi. and nerd culture to come out of cinema. It works because it’s characters are mostly fully fleshed out and the situations are comedic without doing away with tension, and the main cast is a lot of fun. As someone who is a huge Trekkie you can see the inspiration drawn from “Star Trek” in the characters and situations the characters are in, as well as the sci. fi. convention where a lot of the story takes place. These are just some of the elements I really enjoyed about the film, I’ll get into more depth later.\n\nThe film was directed by Dean Parisot and written by David Howard and Robert Gordon while being produced by Mark Johnson and Charles Newirth.\n\nThe story is about a cast of a once famous sci. fi. television show called “Galaxy Quest.” They soon find themselves in over their head when Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen) the Commander on the show makes a deal that they will help a group of aliens called the Thermians who are being hunted to an extinction by an evil alien warlord called Sarris.\n\nThe Pros: The Convention – The convention felt like many of the ones I’d been to as a child and do hope to visit again. There is an excitement and celebration of characters and story that make a great convention great. The ending entrance into the largest convention was awesome too.\n\nBrandon – Is the convention goer who cosplays being a captain in the “Galaxy Quest” universe. He and his friends know the ins and outs of all the missions and episodes which leads to him helping the Commander through the situations he is under.\n\nThe Missions – Take place after the crew have been taken in by the Thermians. From getting another Sphere, to repairing the ship and using the mines in the minefield against Sarris. Most of the crew get to use their skills to their greatest ability.\n\nThe Thermians – The Thermians are a naive octopus like people who can give themselves the illusion of human form. They have\n\nMathesar – Mathesar is the Thermian leader and is a kind and good officer. He rises to the challenge and defends himself (his species is a peaceful one) showing how they’ve grown beyond that and can defend themselves when they need to.\n\nThe Crew – The crew is largely fantastic and has arcs that are greater than themselves. Alan Rickman (R.I.P.) as Dr. Lazarus is my favorite of them.\n\nGuy Fleegman – Sam Rocwell is great as the character was a redshirt (side crew who dies on an away mission, there are many throughout “Star Trek” and other sci. fi. shows). Luckily he is able to subvert this trope and his awareness helps save them and he ends up becoming the security chief on the rebooted show. His story is awesome.\n\nTommy Webber / Lt. Laredo – Mitchell plays the Wesley Crusher wiz kid who didn’t get scarred by being on the show. He’s pretty down to Earth as a character and we see him get involved with helping where he can as well as learning how to actually fly the ship properly so that they can defeat Sarris.\n\nFred Kwan / Tech. St. Chen -Tony Shalhoub is awesome! He is the only character who is fine when meeting the Thermians and ends up hooking up with one of them. For him the strange is normal and it leads to some great interactions as he takes over as Engineer on the ship without a second thought while the rest of the crew is panicking and torn between their roles as actors versus those on the show.\n\nJason Nesmith / Commander Taggart – Nesmith is a Shatner type narcissist whose arc involves him getting pride in his work and not looking down on himself as well as appreciating his crew. He goes from only caring about being the star to knowing that they only survived because of the roles all his crewmembers played. Allen does alright.\n\nAlexander Dane / Dr. Lazarus – Rickman does amazing as the actor who was into drama before his role as Dr. Lazarus ruined his career. His arc is making peace with the fact that people see him this way (as Nimoy had to do with Spock) and when he sees his famous quote bring hope to people fights for them and helps the Thermians rise up against their enemies. He mellows out a lot by the end too as before he is really wound up and anxious at the conventions and when he’s with the cast.\n\nCelebrating Science Fiction – This film celebrates sci. fi. from beginning to end. From “Galaxy Quest” having a rich lore and people who celebrate it’s fandom…the the actual lore of the Thermians taking inspiration from the show.\n\nCelebrating the Fans – The film also celebrates the fans. Brandon saves the crew with his friends as it is their knowledge of past episodes that helps them rescue the Thermians and stop Sarris. At the end Nesmith thanks them all as well and in the end they what they wanted…a rebooted “Galaxy Quest.”\n\nOkay: Gwen DeMarco / Lt. Madison – She is sadly sidelined and her arc is her love story with Nesmith. On the show she just says what the computer says and is sexed up and it’s done even more-so in the reboot. This is an issue with television that could have been addressed but never is. Everything she does is in Nesmith’s shadow versus the other crewmembers who each get their own individual chance to shine.\n\nCons: Sarris – He’s a one-dimensional baddy who tortures for the sake of torture and doesn’t even seem to conquer since he only has one ship. This character had no motivations and even though he had a cool insect like design, that does not make a compelling villain.\n\nThis is a solidly good comedy outing that pays tribute to science fiction while celebrating some of the best aspects of it and the passion that has come to surround the shows. It also is one of Alan Rickman’s greatest performances and my friends and I watched this show to honor him. This is a show that manages to work both as a comedy, a sci. fi. show and even on some level a drama with the only cons being the villain and how Sigourney Weaver’s character. Suffice to say, I highly recommend this film.\n\nFinal Score: 8.4 / 10\n\nI think I like “Aliens” more than “Alien,” but “Alien” is a really good at establishing Ridley Scott’s world and has some of the best tension building in any horror movie, even if the alien itself really isn’t that scary. It’s now what it looks like, but what it does that makes it such a great threat that leaves our heroes always on the run. It is certainly one of Ridley Scott’s classics for a reason.\n\nThe film was directed by Ridley Scott and written by Dan O’Bannon and Ronald Shusett and produced by Gordon Carroll, David Giler and Walter Hill.\n\nThe story involves the crew of the Nostromo taking on an unknown life form and dealing with the consequences of it as reveals about the Corporation they are working for come to the forefront and the alien threat is revealed to be far greater than expected.\n\nThe Pros: Tone – The tone is wonderful and has some of the best tension building in any film! We get to see an unknown world and confining ship where no one fully trusts one another as they are a crew of mercenaries serving a corporation. Over the course of the film they have to depend on one another but are so outgunned by the Xenomorph that they never stood a chance, and terror begins.\n\nThe World – The world is really cool! I wanted to know more about the Corporation as we learned so much about how Xenomorphs grow and develop and how dangerous they are we see a large dead alien around where all the eggs are. There is a sense of terror and mystery from the very beginning and the human ships are designed to be advanced but still look very raw.\n\nThe Xenomorph – The Xenomorph is awesome! It grows quickly, has acid blood and is a full fledged predator, hunting from the shadows and using other humans as bate. It clearly is the perfect hunter and that is what makes it’s hunt of our crew so fun to watch.\n\nDallas – Dallas is the character who would be the hero in a standard sci. fi. action film as he is the bearded hero and the captain of the ship. In this he isn’t though, though we see that he is smart though he is a moment of idiocy when lets an infected crewmember on the ship which makes everything go sideways and to his eventual death by the Xenomorph. Tom Skerritt does a great job.\n\nAsh – Ash is the android who at the end of the day serves the Corporation. His mission is to bring back the Xenomorph so the corporation can turn it into a weapon they can use and therefore the crew is expendable. Ian Holm does great job as the character who isn’t fully human but human enough that we see him have a relationship with the crew even if in the end they are just means to an end for him.\n\nRipley – This is one of Sigourney Weaver’s best roles. Ripley is a character who is rough and has been doing her mercenary work for a long time but still has a connection to home via the cat and her daughter. These things humanize her and give her motivation and a reason to survive and get home when things start going south as the Xenomorph kills the crew and hunts her.\n\nThe Cons: The Other Characters – Lambert just screams and cries the entire time and the other crewmembers including John Hurt are forgettable. They all feel disposable because we don’t get to know them or their motivations.\n\nThe Corporation – The Corporation is just evil and I wish we got to know it more. The motivations don’t feel fleshed out and getting a Xenomorph is on par with Umbrella in “Resident Evil,” and all their bio-weapons where all the scientists end up dead.\n\nThis was an amazing horror and sci. fi. film and one of my favorites. This is a classic of cinema for a lot of reasons not the least of which are the wonderful, haunting designs of H.R. Giger and the beautiful directing by Ridley Scott. The film has wonderful build up and payoff and the only things that really bring it down are a lot of the minor characters are forgettable and the Corporation doesn’t make much sense in it’s motivation.\n\nFinal Score: 9.5 / 10\n\nI’ll start out by saying I like “Chappie” more than “Elysium” but it doesn’t come close to “District 9,” in regards to projects that Neill Blompkin has done. Having the South African rappers Die Antwood in this film also took me out of it besides the Blompkin villain problem where he seems to overly focus on evil capitalists who have no real depth or motivation to what they do…but I’ll get into that more further into the review. This film was fun and there was the potential to be good and great in it.\n\nSPOILERS ahead\n\n“Chappie” was directed by Neill Blompkin who also wrote the original story, co-wrote the screenplay and was one of the producers. The other screenwriter was Teri Tatchell and the other producer was Simon Kinberg.\n\nThe story takes place in 2016 as Tetravaal (a weapons company) has created Scouts that are Robotic Cops that enforce the laws in the city. When one of them is injured and the creator decides to use it to see if he can create consciousnesses things unfold for the worst as he is captured by gangsters and one of his competitors seeks to undo him so his Robotic A.I. called the Moose can be the main security force in the city as the injured Scout becomes a new being called Chappie.\n\nThe Pros: The World – The world is really cool. The A.I. looks great and you have a world where in reaction to complete police control, what gangs there are have a lot of power and money so there is competition between them.\n\nThe Cinematography – The cinematography is beautiful and Trent Opalach did a great job on it. He is able to show the gritty world of the slums as well as the industrial corporate feel of the factory and business really well.\n\nThe Different Robots – The robots were the best part, humans were the weakest part of the story and if we’d had more time developing the robots and Deon’s relationship to them. Any scene with robots was great…and was the few times the horrible human characters (outside of Deon) were actually interesting.\n\nThe Moose – The Moose looks like something out of “Robocop” and is a pretty awesome threat! It also has limitations too since it is completely controlled by a human on the other side (like a drone) so it can’t adapt to tactics or use it’s own body. Still, it has a great design and a ton of weapons. It took a lot to take it down.\n\nThe Scouts – The Scouts are really cool. They are all business and actually make good cops since they do no harm and have to obey the laws. It was a nice twist to how robocops are usually played in sci. fi. outside of Asimov.\n\nChappie – Chappie is wonderful. The A.I. is a child but in learning what he is as A.I. he is able to save his maker and his Mommy as he uses the tech around them them to put his Maker into a Scout body and to build a new body for him as he saves their mind onto a flash or transfers it using the neural helmet. Chappie is impossible to hate and is complex as it makes complicated choices for survival and protecting the people he cared about. Sharlto Copley did a great job voicing him.\n\nThe Maker/Deon – Deon didn’t expect Chappie to become alive so his arc is dealing with this reality and laying down his life Chappie, which Chappie prevents by giving him immortality and in turn keeping his family. He is a great character as he is the idealistic scientist trapped in a corporate job. He was the only human character I liked so it was good seeing him become A.I.\n\nMommy – Yolandi from Die Antwood is one of the few kind characters to Chappie and though she can be annoying, when she’s in Mommy mode to Chappie she’s great. She dies protecting him but Chappie makes her another body at the end.\n\nThe Cons: Die Antwood – Ninja was just annoying and Yolandi was most of the time…also they weren’t even acting they were just playing themselves…really Blompkin? That’s a super lack of creativity.\n\nThe Gangs – The gangs are violent and there is no depth to them. We don’t get there motivations beyond money and they are just as empty as the suits at the corporation.\n\nThe Corporate Villains – Bradley played by Sigourney Weaver is an empty suit stopping Deon and Jackman just plays a violent religious competitor. They were seriously uninteresting and really brought down the script showing just how much of a problem writing humans was in this film. Seriously…Deon is the only sympathetic human character.\n\nTo Easy of a Victory – Everyone gets to be immortal and the human cops are shown to be inept so the new world Chappie is creating won’t have any threat against it…”Elysium” was better with the bittersweet and “District 9” was super realistic…sadly this film tries to be a fairy tale which just causes a clash in tone from everything we went through in the film prior. There isn’t any cost.\n\nThis is a film I’d recommend renting but not buying, not unless you are a huge fan of Robot Films, in which case there is a great Robot Film in this film but it is brought down by the one-dimensionality of all the human characters. If you want a great film about Robots and A.I., check out “Ex Machina”: https://cameronmoviesandtv.wordpress.com/2015/07/10/ex-machina-2015-sentience-and-the-path-to-liberation/. It is a film that will probably be in my Top 5 films of the year. This one was an enjoyable ride but never reached the point of great for me.\n\nFinal Score: 7.3 / 10"
