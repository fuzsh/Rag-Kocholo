        "text": "Sigourney Weaver is the actress who played Dana Barrett in Ghostbusters, Ghostbusters II and Ghostbusters: Afterlife.\n\nFilm Roles[]\n\nIn addition to her role as Dana Barrett in the Ghostbusters films, Sigourney Weaver is well known for her roles as Ellen Ripley in the Alien films.\n\nGhostbusters II[]\n\nReportedly, Columbia tried avoid paying Sigourney Weaver for the profits the first movie. She threatened litigation. Initially, Dana Barrett was in the sequel. Then in later drafts, Dana was replaced with a new character named Lane Walker. Bill Murray took part in auditions for Lane.[1][2] Then Dana had a cameo appearance in a draft. Ultimately, Dana returned as the main romantic lead in the final drafts. Sigourney Weaver was offered a flat fee of $1 million to be in the movie.[3]\n\nGhostbusters: The Video Game[]\n\nAccording to Vivendi Executive Producer John Melchior, Weaver was never contacted to reprise her role for Ghostbusters: The Video Game despite Terminal Reality's Creative Director Drew Haworth writing she turned down an offer to reprise the role.[4][5] Allegedly, she tried to come aboard upon learning Bill Murray had agreed to the project, but development was too far along by that point. [citation needed]\n\nGhostbusters (2016 Movie)[]\n\nAn early idea for Weaver's cameo was a crazy lady. When no one believed the Ghostbusters and they drove around the city, Weaver approached them and told them she believed in them. But either walked away and laid down on the ground or went told someone else the same line.[6][7] In a draft, the woman Weaver portrays is part of a group of women who gather outside the Firehouse to give the Ghostbusters conspiratorial thumbs up for saving the city.[8] It was reported Weaver's cameo was removed from a previous edit and then put back in the final cut. She was initially cut due to the scene not being essential to the story.[9] Ultimately, Weaver portrayed Holtzmann's mentor Rebecca Gorin and appeared at the end of the movie.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nSigourney Weaver auditioned for the role of Dana by acting like a dog.[10]\n\nOn the first day of filming at the New York City Public Library, Sigourney Weaver visited the set to introduce herself to Bill Murray. He in turn picked her up and carried her down Fifth Avenue calling her by her real name, \"Susan.\"[11]\n\nDuring filming of the first movie, Sigourney Weaver would go to a corner to prepare herself for a scene but Bill Murray would sneak up behind her and goof around like tickle her or lift her up.[12][13]\n\nSigourney Weaver came up with the \"game show host\" line instead of the scripted \"used car salesman\" one.[14][15]\n\nSigourney Weaver was sealed inside the charred Terror Dog so there was an urgency to do the sequence quickly. Ivan Reitman made the sequence seem slower by repeating shots on angles.[16][17]\n\nThe scene in Armand's Restaurant with just Dana and Peter at their table was the last scene Sigourney Weaver filmed for the second movie.[18] It would end up being deleted from the final cut.[19]\n\nIn the \"Visitation\" back up story from Ghostbusters Volume 2 Issue #7 and Ghostbusters Volume 2 Issue #8, the teacher is visually based on Sigourney Weaver.\n\nOn the Regular Cover of Ghostbusters 101 #1, the map credit references Sigourney Weaver.\n\nOn page 11 of Ghostbusters Year One Issue #2, in panel 3, on Peter's locker door is an official 8x10 photograph of Sigourney Weaver in costume as Dana from the first movie.\n\nOn page 2 of Ghostbusters Year One Issue #3, Dana's outfit is based on an outfit worn by Sigourney Weaver's character Lauren Slaughter in the 1986 movie \"Half Moon Street\".\n\nReferences[]\n\nGallery[]\n\nPhotos[]\n\nBehind the Scenes[]"
