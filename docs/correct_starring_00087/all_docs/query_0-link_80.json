Weaver (d. 2002), an American of Scottish[citation needed] descent. Her uncle, Doodles Weaver, was a comedian and actor. She began using the name \"Sigourney Weaver\" in 1963, aged fourteen, after a minor character in F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby.[1][2]\n\nWeaver attended the Ethel Walker School, a prep school in Simsbury, Connecticut and graduated from Stanford University (BA, English, 1972).[3] She earned an MFA (1974) at Yale School of Drama,[4] where she appeared in the chorus of a production of Aristophanes' The Frogs and as one of a mob of Roman soldiers in another production [5] as well as, later, in original plays by friend and classmate Christopher Durang. She later appeared in the 1981 off-Broadway production of his comedy Beyond Therapy.\n\nFilm career:\n\nAlthough Weaver has played a number of critically acclaimed roles in movies like Gorillas in the Mist, The Ice Storm, Dave, and The Year of Living Dangerously, she is best known for her appearances as Warrant Officer/Lieutenant Ellen Ripley in the blockbuster \"Alien\" movie franchise. Her first appearance as Ripley was in Ridley Scott's 1979 film Alien. She reprised the role in three sequels, Aliens, Alien³, and Alien Resurrection. She was nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award for portraying Ripley in Aliens. Ripley was a breakthrough role: the first female action hero. Although Ripley is tender and nurturing with a cat or a child, she is tough and aggressive with adult humans and alien monsters, and ruthless enough to blow up her own ship or a planetary colony; in the third film, she destroys herself to prevent the xenomorph species from spreading. She also starred in two films in 1988, receiving Academy Award nominations for her roles as Katherine Parker in Working Girl and as naturalist Dian Fossey in Gorillas in the Mist. She lost to Geena Davis and Jodie Foster, respectively.\n\nWeaver with her father Pat Weaver in 1989Weaver also appeared in Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters II as Dana Barrett. She played the role of the agoraphobic criminal psychologist Helen Hudson in the 1995 movie Copycat, and went on to become the most highly paid actress of the 1990s. In addition to her trademark role as Ripley, Weaver has recently concentrated on smaller, more challenging roles such as 1999's A Map of the World. Despite being fifty at the time, Weaver created a stir for appearing nude in that film. Other recent work includes 2006's Snow Cake. Critics have also noted her consistent performances in comedic roles, such as in Jeffrey (1994), Galaxy Quest (1999), and Heartbreakers (2001), in which she starred with Jennifer Love Hewitt.\n\nIn 1997, Weaver won the BAFTA Award for her supporting role in Ang Lee's The Ice Storm. In 2003, she was voted 20th in british television's Channel 4's countdown of the 100 greatest movie stars of all time. She was one of only two women in the top 20 (the other was Audrey Hepburn). That year, she also played The Warden in the movie Holes. In 2006, Weaver returned to Rwanda for the BBC special Gorillas Revisited.\n\nWeaver was approached to star as the ADA in the The Accused but felt the nature of the story was too violent. Jane Campion wanted a \"Sigourney Weaver-type\" for her film The Piano, but Weaver's agent turned the film down without consulting Weaver. Holly Hunter went on to win the Oscar for the role, and Weaver fired her agent. Bryan Singer originally wanted Sigourney for the role of Emma Frost in X-Men: The Last Stand, but Singer (along with screenwriter Dan Harris, who had directed Weaver in Imaginary Heroes) left the project, and the idea to include Frost was dropped. In 2008, Weaver plays the mother in the TV film Prayers for Bobby, due to air February 2009. She will also guest star in the TV show Eli Stone in the fall of 2008.[6]\n\nWeaver also has done voice work in television and film. She had a guest role in the Futurama episode \"Love and Rocket\" in February 2002, playing the female Planet Express Ship. In 2006, she was the narrator for the American version of the Emmy Award-winning series Planet Earth. In 2008, Weaver was featured as a voice in the Pixar Animation Studios and Disney release, WALL•E. She also voiced a narrating role in another computer-animated film, 2008's The Tale of Despereaux, based on the novel by Kate DiCamillo.\n\nDual nominations:\n\nIn addition to her Academy Awards nomination for Aliens, Weaver has received two other nominations in her career. This makes Weaver one of only eleven actors and actresses to have received two nominations in the same year. Weaver received a Best Actress nomination for her role as gorilla conservationist Dian Fossey in Gorillas in the Mist and a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her role as Katharine Parker in Working Girl opposite Harrison Ford and Melanie Griffith. She did not win either award, (the first award was won by Jodie Foster in The Accused, and the latter was won by Geena Davis in The Accidental Tourist.) but was awarded a Golden Globe for each role, becoming the first person to win two acting Golden Globes in the same year. In fact, Weaver's Golden Globe for Best Leading Actress in a Motion Picture (Drama) was the only time there has ever been a three way tie in the history of a major awards ceremony as Weaver was named joint winner along with Jodie Foster (The Accused) and Shirley Maclaine (Madame Souzatska). By failing to win an Oscar in either category for 1988, she became the first person in history to lose twice in the same ceremony. Three people have been \"double losers\" since then - Emma Thompson in 1994, Julianne Moore in 2003 and Cate Blanchett in 2008.\n\nIn popular culture:\n\nIn 2007, Weaver reprised her role of Ellen Ripley in a commercial for DirecTV. In the commercial Weaver in the power loader vehicle from the movie Aliens is battling the queen xenomorph while explaining to watchers how DirecTV is a better deal than cable.\n\nThe restaurant from the teen scifi drama TV show Roswell features a sandwich named after Weaver.\n\nMusician Scott Zeif (aka Eleph Bet) has a song called \"Sigourney Weaver[12]\".\n\n1979 Alien Ellen Ripley Nominated - BAFTA Award for Best Newcomer\n\nNominated - Saturn Award for Best Actress\n\nAliens Ellen Ripley Won - Saturn Award for Best Actress\n\nNominated - Academy Award for Best Actress\n\nNominated - Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Drama\n\n1989 Ghostbusters II Dana Barrett\n\n1992 Alien³ Ellen Ripley Co-Producer\n\nNominated - Saturn Award for Best Actress\n\n1997Alien: Resurrection Ellen Ripley Clone Co-Producer\n\nNominated - Saturn Award for Best Actress (The BEST! ^^ cuz she totally tough roughneck material :3)\n\n1999 Galaxy Quest Gwen DeMarco/Lieutenant Tawny Madison Nominated - Saturn Award for Best Actress (Although I hate that her character had to be demoted to-Irriatatingly be the \"Female who is trashed out abit T_T\")\n\n2008 Baby Mama Chaffee Bicknell and WALL•E Computer voice only (these cuteset and funniest movies ever ^^)/The Tale of Despereaux The Narrator voice only (haven't seen it yet but like to)\n\n2009 Avatar Dr. Grace Augustine in post-production\n\nAnd lastly becuase she really looks like my dear G-ma'fee as I call her ^^ I you grammy :3 *huggles*"
