        "text": "Director: Dean Parisot\n\nStarring: Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, Tony Shaloub, Sam Rockwell, Daryl Mitchell\n\nBefore I became a fan of film in general, I was a “Star Trek” fan first. Though set in a thoroughly alien future of the 23rd (and later 24th) century, there was something undeniably relatable about “Star Trek.” Most of all, I loved the original six films, although I was also very wild about the original TV series, “The Next Generation,” “Deep Space Nine,” and even the earliest years of “Voyager.” Still, despite being indoctrinated at the age of four, I can’t say I’ve ever been as dedicated as some Trekkies are. I may have browsed the convention scene a time or two, read a few of the novels and collected many of the action figures, but I don’t eat, sleep, live and breathe “Star Trek.” Yet, I completely understand and relate to the mindset of those who do. We know it’s “just a TV show,” but that will never stop us from reliving our favorite moments for years to come. That sentiment is at the very heart of the clever, witty and highly entertaining parody known as “Galaxy Quest.”\n\nEighteen years after the cancellation of the still-very popular TV series, “Galaxy Quest,” its former stars still make the rounds at the conventions. Most of them seem less interested in reliving the past than in seeking an opportunity for a quick buck… because they’re not likely to find it elsewhere. Series star Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen), who played Commander Peter Quincy Taggart, eats up the attention. He lives for this stuff. Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver) is resentful of the stereotype that her character, communications officer Tawny Madison, projects as a “dumb blonde.” Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman), who played the alien first officer Dr. Lazarus, absolutely despises his character’s catchphrases and the special makeup appliances he must wear to get into the role. If it weren’t for the intervention of his cast mates, Alexander would likely find the nearest exit out of the building. Rounding out the cast are Fred Kwan (Tony Shaloub), a.k.a. Tech Sgt. Chen whose duties are akin to that of a “Star Trek” chief engineer and transporter chief), and Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell), a former child actor whose youth prodigy/pilot character Lt. Laredo is reminiscent of Wesley Crusher from “Star Trek: The Next Generation.”\n\nAt a particularly disappointing convention, during which Jason’s ego takes a big hit, he meets what will become the movie’s supporting characters. First, he is approached by a young and enthusiastic fan named Brandon (Justin Long), with whom just about any sci-fi fan who has ever attended a convention can easily relate. Later, another group in full “Galaxy Quest” costume claims to be in need of his help. They say they are Thermians from the Klaatu nebula. Jason just figures that these people want him for some photo op, but it turns out that they actually are aliens. The Thermians are the answer to what might happen if our TV signals ever reached another civilization. They have interpreted the “Galaxy Quest” TV series as historical documents of real-life events, and their entire society is based on it. They’ve even built a working replica of the NSEA Protector, the space vessel driven by our heroes on the show. The Thermians are in a bit of a quandry, as they are negotiating with a particularly nasty creature named Sarris (Robin Sachs). He wants a device known as the Omega 13… which existed on the show, but was never used. Trouble is that Jason doesn’t understand the seriousness of the situation, and orders Sarris’s ship fired upon, requesting to go back home. Reluctantly, the Thermians agree. It’s only then that Jason realizes that everything he’s just seen was real.\n\nExcited over the whole experience, Jason can’t wait to tell the rest of the cast, who’ve been around him long enough that they believe he’s either drunk or it’s a put-on… possibly both. But the Thermians show up once again, saying they still need help negotiating terms of surrender. Knowing the cast’s inability to pass up a job when one comes along, Jason convinces everyone to tag along, including Guy Fleegman (Sam Rockwell), host of the convention and a former guest on one episode of the TV show. Once onboard, everyone is hesitant to go along, but eventually relent out of a feeling of responsibility once they see how dedicated the Thermians are to the “Galaxy Quest” way of life. The negotiations do not go well, in part because the actors don’t know how to control the ship. They barely escape with their lives, but the ship sustains heavy damage after traversing through a mine field. On a nearby planet, they find a replacement for their damaged reactor core, but Sarris and his men have boarded the Protector, captured Mathesar (the Thermian leader) and are in the process of torturing him for information about the Omega 13 device. To spare Mathesar’s life, Jason reveals the truth about “Galaxy Quest” and its cast.\n\nThe situation looks grim, with Sarris setting the ship to auto-destruct and planning to release both the cast and the Thermians into space. This is the moment when our heroes must all step up and become more than the sum of their parts, when they must commit the most selfless and meaningful act of their entire lives, Brandon included. Jason and Alexander role play a scene from a “Galaxy Quest” episode where they fight with one another. This distracts their guards long enough for them to turn the tables and vent their captors out into space. Alexander, after rescuing the Thermians from certain asphyxiation, finally owns the role of Dr. Lazarus and all of the silly catchphrases that go along with it when he witnesses a Thermian gunned down right in front of him.\n\nRemembering that he had accidentally handed Brandon his communicator when they’d bumped into one another at the convention, Jason radios Brandon for help concerning how to locate and turn off the auto-destruct. While Brandon gives directions to Jason and Gwen, he also muses about his theory concerning the Omega 13: that it is a device capable of creating a 13-second time jump. After stopping the auto-destruct and destroying Sarris’s ship, Jason makes use of such a time jump after Sarris, disguised as Fred, kills everyone on board the command deck. With the crisis averted, the crew separates the ship, bids the Thermians farewell and returns to Earth, literally crashing that day’s convention. The crew emerges from the ship to the delight of the crowd, as does Sarris whom Jason eliminates with one quick blast from his laser pistol. The crowd roars even louder, with some of the girls in the audience even fainting as Jason and Gwen share a kiss. Having learned many lessons from the experience, including humility, Jason encourages the cast to share the spotlight with him, and everyone takes a bow. Later that year, “Galaxy Quest” returns to the airwaves with all-new episodes and two new cast members: Guy assumes the role of the ship’s security chief and Laliari (Missi Pyle), a Thermian who elected to stay with the cast due to her romantic bond with Fred Kwan, is cast as a character bearing the same name.\n\nJason Nesmith is easily Tim Allen’s best film role. I also get a kick out of Sigourney Weaver’s turn as an actress famous for a very anti-Ellen Ripley role. You get the sense that Gwen DeMarco might possess a toughness that is more in line with Weaver’s “Alien” heroine. She finds her role on the show completely redundant and is further humiliated when magazine articles, instead of interviewing her about her acting career, tend to focus on her other assets. Of course, the main draw, as he is in any other movie I’ve seen him in, is Alan Rickman. Whether as a hero or as a villain, you cannot help but love the guy. I only wish I’d reviewed this movie sooner so that the timing of it would not have been directly influenced by his recent passing.\n\nI’ve seen some “Star Trek” fans include “Galaxy Quest” on their lists of favorite “Trek” films. This is something which I refuse to do, and I rationalize that this way: As great a movie as it is, you don’t rank “Spaceballs” along with the “Star Wars” films, do you? Certainly not, and therefore the same logic must apply to “Galaxy Quest.” That being said, “Galaxy Quest” is such a wonderfully imagined film that you wish there actually was a TV series to binge-watch afterwards. I love the cheap look of the sets, props and aliens… all as they would look if part of a low-budget TV show. The humor of “Galaxy Quest” works best when you have intimate knowledge of the numerous in-joke references to “Star Trek.” One can’t help watching the situations that the cast finds themselves in and not think of how the original “Trek” cast might have behaved under similar circumstances. For example, surely there would come a point where William Shatner would have his shirt torn open, as demonstrated by a corresponding scene involving Jason Nesmith’s encounter with a rock monster (itself a reference to a deleted scene from the Shatner-directed “Star Trek V: The Final Frontier”). There would also be ample opportunity to simultaneously point out everything that is illogical about the story while simultaneously not having a care in the world. Because, after all, it’s just a movie.\n\nDirector: Ivan Reitman\n\nStarring: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts\n\nWhen I was a kid, the Ghostbusters were just about as cool as anything else in popular culture. You had the 1984 classic movie, the cartoon series, and you had the line of toys which were connected with said cartoon. (I had just about all the toys, which have since been passed on to the next generation.) The trouble with all of that is that it creates high demand for “More! More! More!” regardless of whether or not anyone involved actually wanted to return to the project. Now, I was at the age where I was still unaware of all the behind-the-scenes crap that goes on. Probably wouldn’t have cared one way or the other. All I knew was that, in the summer of 1989, I was getting another “Ghostbusters” movie. This news had me very excited.\n\nFive years have passed since the events of “Ghostbusters.” In that time, the team has gone out of business, having been sued by the city for the property damage caused in the act of saving the day, and have become something of a joke to fellow New Yorkers. What a bunch of ingrates! In any event, the foursome have gone their separate ways. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), ever the shameless shyster, has his own talk show specializing in pseudo-psychology. Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) runs an occult book store, while he and Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) use their former jobs as a gimmick for extra cash at children’s birthday parties. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) appears to be the only one enjoying life as an ex-Ghostbuster, using his time to run emotion-based experiments. It’s his work that the team will need to rely on when the slime hits the fan.\n\nVenkman’s ex-girlfriend Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) has an infant son named Oscar from a recent marriage that didn’t work out. Though things between Dana and Venkman went sour due mainly to his being an immature jerk (surprise, surprise), it is clear that Venkman regrets the fact that he did not wind up as Oscar’s father. Though still a cello player at heart, being a mother comes first for Dana, and so she has taken a job restoring artwork at the Manhattan Museum of Art. You know that feeling we sometimes get about portraits whose eyes seem to be tracking us? Well, Dana actually has that problem, coming from a painting of an ancient, malevolent sorcerer/dictator known as Vigo the Carpathian (Wilhelm von Homburg). Through investigation, the Ghostbusters are able to connect the dots between the painting, an incident on the busy New York streets which put Oscar in danger, and a horrifyingly massive river of slime flowing underneath the city.\n\nOscar is placed in further peril when Vigo places a spell upon Janosz Poha (Peter MacNicol), charging Janosz with the mission of finding a child to serve as a vessel for Vigo’s resurrection, an event which Vigo has scheduled to take place at the start of the new year. Meanwhile, the Ghostbusters make a breakthrough in their analysis of the sample they collected from the slime river. It seems this stuff reacts differently depending on the emotions it channels from the living. This “mood slime” has been building up underneath the city due to all the bad vibes put out by the citizens of New York. When you get doused in the slime, it causes you to react violently. The opposite is also true. The slime can also react to positive reinforcement and to certain forms of good music, and can therefore be used by the Ghostbusters as another weapon in their arsenal against Vigo. When the evil overlord enacts his final plan, he encases the museum in a seemingly impenetrable slime mold. To get through the roof, the Ghostbusters use positively-charged slime to bring the Statue of Liberty to life (which sounds ridiculous, but looks awesome) and open a hole with the good vibes that Lady Liberty inherently provides. You’d think the sight of this would create a city-wide panic… but I guess that, once you’ve seen a 100-foot tall Marshmallow Man, a mobile Statue of Liberty is nothing to be overly concerned about.\n\nConsidering the mortal danger that the guys put themselves in last time against Gozer, which included “crossing the streams,” their battle with Vigo is stunningly anti-climactic. That’s the main problem with “Ghostbusters 2”: It’s one of those been there, done that type of sequels. Because the main cast is unchanged, you know that the laughs will come when and where they should. Because there is a baby involved in the danger, there is a level of terror that the first film didn’t go for. The story that puts all these pieces together, however, is a little too familiar. The music this time is also a bit lacking. A lot of the apparent lack of creativity can be blamed on a studio pressuring director Ivan Reitman and actors Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis and Hudson into committing to a sequel they never actually wanted to do. Not even an amusing set of cameos from the likes of Cheech Marin, Ben Stein, and Bobby Brown (who also contributed the song “On Our Own”) can change that.\n\nAlthough “Ghostbusters 2” clearly has not held up the way that its predecessor has and always will, I find that I still enjoy it almost as much. Part of it is seeing the talented cast gathered together for a second time (and Peter MacNicol is a welcome, hilarious addition). But I think some of it is due to the memory of having seen it as a kid in the theater. If you weren’t that young in 1989 (or hadn’t even been born yet), I could understand your having much different feelings from my own. I won’t deny that “Ghostbusters 2” deserves much of the criticism it gets but that doesn’t make it a bad movie. I maintain that, as in the context of the story it tells, the good vibes FAR outweigh the bad.\n\nDirector: David Fincher\n\nStarring: Sigourney Weaver, Charles S. Dutton, Charles Dance, Lance Henriksen\n\nMine enemy, thy name is “Alien 3.” Or is it supposed to be “Alien Cubed”? The strangely stylized “3” displayed on all the posters and video boxes perfectly symbolizes how this once proud science-fiction/horror franchise tried to make a move into new territory and wound up taking a detour into utter stupidity. The series was just fine being left off at the end of “Aliens” with our heroes escaping LV-426 with their lives and a bright future ahead of them. But 20th Century Fox decided in their infinite wisdom that there was still money to be milked from this cash cow. For more than two decades, “Alien 3” has ranked as the most disappointing movie I’ve ever seen. But I’m serious when I say that I believe it was not made by amateurs. It takes real talent for a filmmaker to piss off their audience before the movie is five minutes old. That’s actually the most maddening thing about it: the tools for a great sequel were there, but they were left to rust in the proverbial rain.\n\nFor reasons that have never been satisfactorily explained, there was a stowaway Alien onboard our intrepid heroes’ spaceship from the previous movie (presumed to have been left there by the Alien Queen they encountered and defeated). It causes a fire onboard, and the ship crashlands on the prison planet Fiorina 161, populated by a bunch of rapists and murders, none of which are female, most of which speak with one form of an English accent or another, and all of which have not had sex in a very long time. Out of the three humans and one android who survived the events of “Aliens,” only Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) makes it out of the crash. Ripley is only able to mourn her friends for a short while, as it looks like there might be a new Alien on the loose, one which moves quite differently from those she has seen before. Worse still, there are no weapons on this planet, so to survive, they have to improvise. All the while, Ripley isn’t feeling so great, which she passes off as being groggy from cryosleep.\n\nIf the producers were looking to piss off the fans of “Aliens,” it’s a fair bet to say they succeeded. I don’t know how they can justify killing off fan favorites like Hicks and (especially) Newt. Particularly obscene and revolting is the subsequent autopsy on the little girl (which was reportedly more graphic before cuts were made, no pun intended). James Cameron, director of “Aliens,” and actor Michael Biehn were just as upset as fans were. Biehn went as far as to request and receive almost as much money for the use of his likeness in this movie as he got for starring in “Aliens.” Maybe it could have been possible to overlook the deaths of Hicks and Newt if it weren’t for the fact that these beloved characters are replaced with mostly forgettable and, in some cases, not terribly likeable characters. The few that are memorable don’t last as long as they should.\n\nOne person whom I cannot and will not blame for this mess of a movie is David Fincher. Not the least bit responsible for the contents of the screenplay, he is not to blame for the haphazard writing. Being a first-time director, he was also taken advantage of by the studio heads, who made several changes to the film behind his back. Rightly so, Fincher has disowned “Alien 3,” and thankfully his involvement didn’t sabotage his career, which has included “Se7en,” “Fight Club” and the 2011 American remake of “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo”… all fantastic movies.\n\nI hate movies with false advertisement, be it in the promotional material or in the movie’s title itself. In the case of “Alien 3,” the teaser trailer seemed to promise a sequel taking place on Earth. Given how “Aliens” had raised the stakes, this seemed like the next logical step. Alas, it was not to be, and the dreary, dark sets of Fiorina 161 were no substitute. Were one to listen to Elliot Goldenthal’s soundtrack without knowing about the film it is attached to, it might seem like the epic score of an equally epic feature. That it does not belong to a better film is a tragedy.\n\nI originaly saw “Alien 3” in the theater back in the summer of 1992. Until that time, in my naivety, I thought it was impossible not to have a good time at the movies. Even at their darkest, the previous two films are exciting from beginning to end. Apart from the most uproarious utterance of my favorite four-letter word, “Alien 3” had little to offer me other than doom and gloom. I waited almost 22 years before seeing it again, hoping that as an adult I might be able to look at it differently. Little has changed, apart from being slightly more familiar with some of the actors who, within the film, are still difficult to distinguish due to their shaven heads. It is certain that I have since seen dozens of movies that are far worse in every conceivable way, but there are still none which have disappointed me more than “Alien 3” …none which cause me greater annoyance through their very existence.\n\nDirector: James Cameron\n\nStarring: Sigourney Weaver, Carrie Henn, Michael Biehn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton, Jenette Goldstein, William Hope\n\nSequels are burdened with the seemingly impossible task of living up to their predecessor(s). Most fail because they don’t offer the audience anything new, choosing simply to redo everything the previous film(s) did. This has the effect of boring the audience, who can set their watches by each of the main plot points. The best kind of sequel also maintains a certain continuity, while at the same time establishing itself as a different beast entirely. These stories take what worked before, introduce interesting new characters, raise the stakes, and keep you guessing right up until the end. Most importantly, they make sure the audience is entertained throughout. Among the greatest of sequels stand “The Godfather Part II,” The Empire Strikes Back,” “Bride of Frankenstein” …and “Aliens.”\n\nFifty-seven years have passed since the events of “Alien,” where Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) was the only survivor of the commercial freighter Nostromo. That her six crew members died is of no concern to her employers, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation. They’re much more concerned about the money lost by Ripley’s decision to set the Nostromo to auto-destruct. They don’t even bat an eyelash when she brings up the planet where the Alien was originally found, LV-426, because there’s been a terraforming colony established there for sometime that houses seventy families. Yeah, that’s not gonna end well. Sure enough, contact with the colony is lost. Company official Burke (Paul Reiser) and a team of Marines are going to the planet and they need Ripley’s help, given her unique experience with the creatures responsible. The only survivor they find there is a seven year old girl named Newt (Carrie Henn), whose parents investigated the same derelict ship the Nostromo’s crew found, and the results were a hundred times more deadly. The Marines are in over their heads. Being loaded with firepower the Nostromo crew could only dream about doesn’t seem to make much difference. With their own numbers rapidly decreasing, the only recourse left is to get off the planet ASAP.\n\nSigourney Weaver’s work here surprisingly earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Actress. I don’t mean to suggest that she didn’t do a great job, or that Ellen Ripley (whose first name we didn’t know until this sequel) doesn’t grow as a character. It’s just rare for a film like “Aliens” to get any form of praise other than for technical achievements. Although this is clearly Ripley’s story, I find that the best characters in “Aliens” are found among the Marines. Lance Henriksen (who plays the android Bishop), as several of my friends are fond of saying, pretty much automatically makes any movie better all by himself. But, most specifically, I am thinking of Bill Paxton and Jenette Goldstein.\n\nAs Hudson, Bill Paxton is the movie’s comic relief character. He’s the one Marine who is quickest to lose his cool, the one who would be most likely to choose flight before fight in order to save his own hide (except when it matters most), and the one who provides most of the movie’s highly quotable dialogue. Jenette Goldstein made her film debut with “Aliens.” She disappears so completely into the role of tough girl Vasquez that, if you were unaware of the actor’s subsequent filmography (or her family background), you might not guess that she isn’t of Latin descent. Even if you are her superior officer, Vasquez is someone who you do not want to piss off.\n\n“Aliens” also features my favorite composer, James Horner. Still in the early years of his career, Horner’s score for “Aliens” is perhaps his most iconic. For the next ten to fifteen years, movie trailers were still using the track “Bishop’s Countdown.” The one I remember best is the trailer for “From Dusk Till Dawn.” Certain bits of the soundtrack can also be heard during the climax of “Die Hard.”\n\nThe legacy of “Aliens” reaches far beyond its status as one of the greatest sequels ever filmed. As a movie that includes elements of the horror, science fiction and action genres, it defies classification. Hudson could be said to be the template for Jayne Cobb, a character from writer/director Joss Whedon’s TV series “Firefly.” “Aliens” may also be responsible for the action shoot-’em-up videogame genre, games which feature an increasing amount of danger and difficulty as the player progresses from level to level. Director James Cameron, famous for shamelessly using the basics of an existing story to spin his own yarn, would do it to himself in five years time. “Aliens” is very much a trial run for “Terminator 2: Judgment Day” (itself a fantastic sequel which many find superior). The two share in common the themes of family (Ripley becoming a surrogate mother after finding out she’s missed her own daughter’s entire adult life), and of the female lead’s need for closure, to put the monster to bed at last. We share in both the terror and the catharsis, making “Aliens” both an exciting and satisfying experience. It also works as a great closing chapter, but it would not be the last time that the Aliens graced the cinema with their presence. The almighty dollar makes studio heads do crazy things…\n\nDirector: Ridley Scott\n\nStarring: Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm, Yaphet Kotto\n\nIn the grand tradition of the haunted house and creature features of the 1950’s, “Alien” is a movie about that which lurks in the shadows and prefers to sneak up on you from behind. The title creature itself owes much to the ‘Carrot Monster’ from “The Thing From Another World” (1951) and the mutated ants from “Them!” (1954). Like the Gi-Ants, the Alien leaves a terrifyingly unforgettable impression upon its first appearance. In the case of the Carrot Monster, “Alien” borrows the idea of an extra-terrestrial life form hunting down humans within a limited area. Instead of an Arctic research facility, the setting is the commercial space freighter Nostromo. Also serving as inspiration is the science-fiction classic “Forbidden Planet” (1956), where an Earth spaceship lands on an alien world, ignoring warnings not to do so, and its crew is killed off one by one.\n\nI first came across “Alien” in a kind of roundabout way, having the film’s most famous scene spoiled for me by a certain Mel Brooks comedy. About four years later, when I was ten years old, “Alien 3” was about to make its theatrical debut. Interested in seeing it, I first rented both “Alien” and “Aliens” so I would have some idea what was going on. I found, to my surprise, that “Alien” really cares about getting you acquainted with its small cast of seven characters. Although the Alien does pick them off in rapid succession, we spend almost half of the movie just getting to know these people before the monster comes out to play. Many horror movies made today will get so hyperactive about showing off scenes of gore that they forget to lure the audience in and get us emotionally involved. “Alien” makes you feel every death.\n\nThe crew members of the Nostromo act like real people. They bicker and argue, they panic, and some of them show particular interest in how much their employers plan to pay them for their work. Unlike many science-fiction or horror films, the cast actually looks like they have the experience they would need for deep space missions. This is partially due to their age, with Sigourney Weaver the only one who had not yet celebrated her 30th birthday at the time of filming, while the rest of the cast’s age ranged from 30 (Veronica Cartwright) to 53 (Harry Dean Stanton). Age isn’t everything, of course, and one of the things that really helps elevate “Alien” above the usual standard fare of the genre is the terrific individual performances, especially from Weaver. There’s a reason why all science-fiction female heroines since 1979 have been judged by whether or not they can be thought of as “the next Ellen Ripley.”\n\nAdd the beautiful soundtrack to the list of reasons why “Alien” makes my top ten list of all-time favorite films. I’ve often noted that great horror movies more often than not have amazing scores, but “Alien” is a unique case. The original score that Jerry Goldsmith composed for the film is almost completely unused here. Instead, other well-known pieces of orchestral music are used, my favorite being the excerpt from Howard Hanson’s Symphony No. 2, “Romantic.” For my favorite scene, I would have to go with the opening scene where we’re scanning around the empty corridors of the vessel while its passengers are still resting in their cryogenic chambers. This sets up the perfect foreboding atmosphere. The movie will never be this quiet or peaceful again.\n\nDirector: Ivan Reitman\n\nStarring: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis, Annie Potts, William Atherton, Ernie Hudson\n\nLet’s get this out of the way right now: I do not believe in ghosts. But what is a ghost, exactly? There seem to be many different variations out there. Some are malicious spooks that only wish to terrorize the living. Some seem to wander the Earth unaware/unable to admit that they’re dead. Others have a wrong that was done to them which they are trying to make public knowledge. About the only type of ghost I could say I have some small belief in is the metaphorical kind. I believe that, because of our memories, a small trace is left behind of the people who once graced a particular location with their presence. In this way, I can go to these familiar places and feel… odd… when I take a look around, especially in my old schools. Whatever the reason for a ghost’s presence among the living, I would be the character known as ‘the skeptic.’\n\nThere are several skeptics in “Ghostbusters.” One of them early on is Peter Venkman (Bill Murray). He’s a scientist at NYU, as are friends Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis). Ray and Egon want to prove the existence of and study the paranormal, whereas Peter just wants to use his position to pick up college girls. Although the Dean of the University (who finds their theories preposterous) kicks them off campus, an incident at a library involving a “full-torso apparition” changes everything for them. Now, the three men are ready to go into the business of catching ghosts. Along the way, a very annoying skeptic in the form of EPA representative Walter Peck (William Atherton) impedes their path. He thinks the Ghostbusters are dangerous, and wants their facility shut down. Seriously, has William Atherton ever played a character that didn’t make you instantly hate him?\n\nOne of the charming aspects of “Ghostbusters” is Peter Venkman’s hilarious repeated attempts to secure a date with his first client, Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver). I think probably my favorite scene of the movie, other than the apocalypse-averting climax, has to be the scene where Dana brings Peter over to her apartment to check things out. You know, to make sure the ghosts aren’t still hanging around. Try not to break up when you hear Peter’s response to Dana’s statement about how nothing ever happened in the bedroom. I’ll bet you can’t do it. For me, “Ghostbusters” represents Bill Murray at his best.\n\nI’ll never forget the first time I saw “Ghostbusters.” It was 1987, and I was five years old. That day, my family and I attended someone’s wedding (though if you asked me their names or what relation the bride/groom were to us, I couldn’t tell you), but all I could think about was catching “Ghostbusters” on ABC’s Sunday Night Movie. Remember when ABC regularly showed movies pretty much any night of the week? That Christmas, I got the full set of Ghostbusters action figures …which were a tie-in not with the movie but the cartoon, but I didn’t care. I still have them in a box somewhere to this day. The Stay Puft Marshmallow Man was always my favorite.\n\nThe cast for “Ghostbusters” almost ended up looking quite different, and yet I can see how the actors who were the original choices of writers Aykroyd and Ramis might have worked out well. John Belushi was to be Peter Venkman, however he died in 1982 before the project could get underway. The role of Winston Zeddemore was to have gone to Eddie Murphy, and Louis Tulley was to have been played by John Candy, but both turned the movie down. I can definitely see Murphy and Candy working out quite well, but I’m happy with what Ernie Hudson and Rick Moranis were able to do with those characters.\n\nThough I was too young to see this one theatrically, I did get the chance to see “Ghostbusters 2” with my mother in the summer of 1989. A third movie has been teased ever since, but creative differences, particularly on Murray’s part, combined with the falling out between Murray and Ramis, kept that idea on the shelf. At this point, a remake is more likely, and that’s not a prospect that appeals to me, either. Since Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis seem the only original cast members interested in continuing the franchise on the big screen, maybe they could do one where Ray and Egon hire youthful ghost hunters as their own replacements, so that it would be both a sequel and a reboot.\n\nIn the meantime, the original “Ghostbusters” is here to stay, ready to entertain a whole new generation who either want to believe in ghosts or just want to laugh at their expense."
