Feig’s film stars Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones and Chris Hemsworth. It hits theaters on July 22, 2016. Original castmember Ernie Hudson also shot a cameo.\n\nThe film recently wrapped production in Boston.\n\nWeaver, who will star in the next three Avatar films, most recently appeared in Chappie and Exodus: Gods and Kings. She is repped by UTA and Jackoway Tyerman."
