        "text": "“Clue” is my go-to comfort movie. The 1985 murder mystery starred Tim Curry as a one man Greek chorus of a butler, Madeline Kahn as the flustered Mrs. White, and Christopher Lloyd as lecherous Professor Plum. They were part of an energetic ensemble invited to a mansion by Mr. Boddy, who’s only seen briefly before being murdered. Whodunnit? That’s what they need to figure out.\n\nWhat results is a perfect balance between theatrical dialogue and cinematic slapstick. Its humor is rangy, often folding extended wordplay and physical comedy together in ways that are unexpected. Very few jokes can be guessed ahead of time. Its lithe ability to shift so deftly between different styles of comedy is what makes it so rewatchable. You don’t see just one style of comedy done well, you see some of the best comedic actors of their generation deliver on a screenplay and direction that features every little thing they can do.\n\n“Clue” stands as the best movie adaptation of a board game, in large part because it happened well before the scramble to adapt any and every board game with a recognizable brand name. It also stayed surprisingly true to the game, releasing into theaters with a variety of endings. People who’d seen it at different theaters would each insist a different person was guilty, mirroring the disagreements that can happen when playing the actual game. For home release and any version you’ll see now, these endings are presented one after the other in a way that maintains the film’s eccentric momentum.\n\nI like Ryan Reynolds, but I have some concern over his proposed “Clue” remake. First and foremost, the two announced cast – Reynolds and Jason Bateman – don’t fit what I’d want to see in a remake. Each plays variations on a single character in everything they’ve been in. They’re very good at doing that, but they both lack the breadth and ability for variation that “Clue” demands.\n\nThe various writers they’ve gone through boast experience ranging from “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” to “Deadpool”, but the most recent rewrite is by the man who brought us “Mortal Kombat” and “Escape Room: Tournament of Champions”. He also wrote “22 Jump Street” and “The Lost City”, which is reassuring and makes the chances of Channing Tatum jump exponentially. Actually, I’d be better with him than Reynolds or Bateman.\n\nThe saving grace so far is James Bobin’s attachment as director. The “Flight of the Concords” creator helmed the 2011 “The Muppets” and “Muppets Most Wanted”, and I heard surprisingly good things about his live-action “Dora and the Lost City of Gold”. He’s an ideal director for something that seeks to balance camp, theatricality, slapstick, and some good, old-fashioned fourth wall breakage.\n\nWho’s in my ideal cast? I’m so glad I’m pretending you asked. I’ve looked at a lot of clickbait, a lot of comment sections, and I’ll let you know who the popular choice seems to be before offering my suggestion. I’m not just going to focus on big names – that’s not realistic or affordable, and every character being a showboat would just make a mess. Let’s focus on a cast that complements each others’ strengths and weaknesses.\n\nWADSWORTH\n\noriginally: Tim Curry\n\nthe popular choice: Matt Berry\n\nmy choice: Daniel Radcliffe\n\nThe role you’ve got to get right is the butler who buttles (“I buttle, sir”). He keeps the plot moving forward. Tim Curry fused his preternatural ability to anchor you into a narrative with comedic chops that let him bounce from scene to scene like a chaotic pinball. The role needs to cut a line straight down the middle of the narrative hijinks and the showiness of other roles. It’s one of the more underrated comedy performances out there.\n\nThe temptation – as I’m sure it is for Reynolds – is to cast, you know, Ryan Reynolds. That could work…ish. I’m not sold on the idea. You need to cast someone who can capture the camera on the heels of someone else’s joke, and then return it just as easily. Reynolds can do the first part with ease; I’m not entirely sure he can hand the attention back reliably enough.\n\nThe popular choice I kept coming across is Matt Berry. That’d work, as the man’s been doing Curry-adjacent comedy from “The IT Crowd” to “What We Do in the Shadows”. For all his skill at parodying bravado, Berry is an expert at sharing the screen and readily turning the joke over to his fellow actors.\n\nYet as I researched this, there was one suggestion that felt so out of the box – and yet disturbingly accurate – that I couldn’t dismiss it. I hate to open with a suggestion that’s already out there, but Pajiba’s recommendation of Daniel Radcliffe is so inventive I just can’t shake it.\n\nIn his post Harry Potter career, Radcliffe has focused on bringing dynamic complexity to comedic roles that could’ve just been one-note jokes. Look at “Swiss Army Man” next to “Miracle Workers” for his ability to shift quickly between grounding a moment and flinging it into chaos.\n\nBelieve me, I wanted to feel all clever and make my own out-of-left-field suggestion, but this one’s so good I can’t get it out of my brain – and he’d give the film box office draw.\n\nMRS. WHITE\n\noriginally: Madeline Kahn\n\nthe popular choice: Aubrey Plaza\n\nmy choice: Claudia O’Doherty\n\nThe showiest role in “Clue” is that of Mrs. White, played by one of the great comedic actors of the last century in Madeline Kahn. I’m not sure you can find an equal. The popular choice in article after article is Aubrey Plaza. While she can go off on a fiery tangent, her foundational humor tends to be much drier.\n\nKahn could plant a line so acidic that you didn’t realize it until half a scene later when it had melted through your hull. Contrast this to Plaza, who jerks the audience by the collar into the joke. Plaza’s is an incredibly muscular comedy that works by interrupting and redirecting the pace. It’s unique to her and maybe that’s more valuable to Mrs. White than fitting a particular mold. Again though, it’s that breadth of comedy that I want. Plaza can nail a specific character range as well or better than Reynolds or Bateman, but like them, I’m not sure she has the adaptability I’m looking for.\n\nYou can’t go wrong choosing Plaza, but I do feel there’s a more apt choice – someone who can deliver a line that sits in wait before taking your brain by storm. Claudia O’Doherty is the best I know at shifting from a supporting ensemble voice one moment to stealing the scene out from under half a dozen people the next.\n\nThe Australian actor stars in “Killing It” and had a supporting role in last year’s “Our Flag Means Death” (as Stede Bonnet’s jilted wife Mary). She can adopt the sweet innocent “Who me?” vibes of Mrs. White while flashing daggers of contempt and murderous vengeance.\n\nMISS SCARLET\n\noriginally: Lesley Ann Warren\n\nthe popular choice: Aubrey Plaza (again!)\n\nmy choice: Josie Totah\n\nMiss Scarlet embodies a smoldering, charming, come-hither attitude, but guards it with a thick layer of the unattainable. You need someone who can disarm others from a pedestal she’s placed herself upon, yet occasionally lets the facade down and has to scramble back up to it before anyone else notices. That comedy has its spotlight moments, but a lot of it has to happen in the background – it has to be something the audience notices her doing before anyone else does.\n\nAgain Plaza’s is the name most often mentioned; people really want to see her in a “Clue” remake. Who am I to argue?\n\nI’m torn in a few directions otherwise. After “Do Vengeance”, I have to admit Maya Hawke would be an exceptional choice. Utilizing your blocking and knowing how the camera sees you is such an overlooked aspect of film comedy. Hawke has rare ability there. If you cast her, I’d have no good argument against it.\n\nIf you want to cast a straight up prototypical Miss Scarlet who was born for the role, you dye British impressionist Morgana Robinson’s hair red and call it a day. She captures the camera in a way Miss Scarlet must, and in British panel shows like “Taskmaster” has naturally projected the exact smolder a Miss Scarlet should have.\n\nA lesser known choice would be Josie Totah. I’ve only seen her in the underrated and overlooked gem that was the “Saved by the Bell” reboot, but she was the show’s standout. Her comic timing and command of physical comedy was undeniable and she possesses Warren’s capacity to play out a counter-scene in the background.\n\nIt’s a big shift from the type of series acting Totah’s done before to the kind of film acting this would ask, but I think she’s got the ability and presence.\n\nPROFESSOR PLUM\n\noriginally: Christopher Lloyd\n\nthe popular choice: Keegan-Michael Key\n\nmy choice: Bryan Cranston\n\nAs much goodwill as I have for Keegan-Michael Key, outside of sketches I’ve only ever seen him play variations on one role. That role is very reliable and he wouldn’t be a bad choice for the more straight-laced Mr. Green, but I’m not sure you choose him to be a punchy, lascivious old man for an hour-and-a-half. I just don’t see it.\n\nThe one who could capture an energy equal to Christopher Lloyd’s is Bryan Cranston. Let’s not forget his fierce and terrifying work on “Breaking Bad” was preceded by the goofy physical comedy of put-upon father Hal in “Malcolm in the Middle”. With Jane Kaczmarek, the pair formed what still stands to this day as the most entertaining sitcom marriage since “I Love Lucy”. Cranston has long been the natural successor to Lloyd’s eccentric yet easily distracted geniuses, he’s just done the other stuff, too. (So did Lloyd; let’s not forget the time he fistfought Captain Kirk as complex Klingon Commander Kruge).\n\nCranston’s breadth across the “Malcolm in the Middle” to “Breaking Bad” spectrum, his skill for the eccentric, and the fact he’s getting older means he’s the perfect choice for Professor Plum – a scoundrel who uses his title to hide his slavering salaciousness.\n\nMRS. PEACOCK\n\noriginally: Eileen Brennan\n\nthe popular choice: Catherine O’Hara\n\nmy choice: Niecy Nash\n\nEileen Brennan’s original Mrs. Peacock had a habit of saying something just off-kilter enough to give you pause, but not so much to stop you in your tracks as the joke kept going. As I mentioned earlier, fan-casting tends to want everyone to be a showboat who steals the camera, but if everyone’s doing that, no one’s keeping the film afloat.\n\nNiecy Nash has made her name in supporting work, delivering the kind of jokes that trip you up without making you fall behind. She has an exceptional talent for ensemble work. I could also see Ali Wong here and I harbor a deep curiosity after “Halo” of just how much scenery Natascha McElhone could chew. But Nash is the best choice as an actor who gets opportune jabs in without ever wavering in her support of the performers around her.\n\nCOLONEL MUSTARD\n\noriginally: Martin Mull\n\nthe popular choice: Nick Offerman\n\nmy choice: Diane Morgan\n\nColonel Mustard is the dopey and cowardly military man who’s always a step behind and volunteers others to walk into danger first. Nick Offerman could do that; I’ve got no problem with that choice. But I feel there’s one person born to take on that role and improve upon it. That is Philomena Cunk herself, Diane Morgan.\n\nYou’ve likely seen some of her work as the dreadfully miscast and inept documentary host in her British “Cunk” satires and Netflix’s recent “Cunk on Earth”. She actually has a huge range of appearances on British TV, perhaps most notably her touching portrayal of an absurd boss who’s revealed to be desperately lonely in “After Life”. The role is one of the most remarkable pieces of character development in the last several years.\n\nMull originally played the role as someone who had boundless confidence while being consistently out of his depth. This is Morgan’s wheelhouse, but she’s managed to find human depths in it that make it more reflective, uncomfortable, and all the funnier.\n\nMR. GREEN\n\noriginally: Michael McKean\n\nthe popular choice: Ryan Reynolds\n\nmy choice: Martin Freeman\n\nThis tends to be where most stick Ryan Reynolds because you’ve got to put him somewhere. Mr. Green is the character most able to fade into the background, a nondescript everyman who’s so easy to overlook that it serves his role as a C.I.A. spy perfectly. Nondescript and easy to overlook…doesn’t sound like Ryan Reynolds. At all.\n\nYou want a put-upon everyman, you get Martin Freeman. From Sherlock’s endearing Watson to Bilbo from “The Hobbit” fame, he’s achieved a level of frumpy discontent that perfectly conveys he’d rather be at home reading a good book. He’s played more adventurous roles in the MCU and the “Fargo” series, but even here he maintains an undercurrent of, “This adventure is making me miss time I could be spending under a blanket.”\n\nHe plays characters who are less exciting than their adventures, but are lovable because they lack airs, which mirrors McKean’s take on the comedic straight man.\n\nYVETTE\n\noriginally: Colleen Camp\n\nthe popular choice: Aubrey Plaza\n\nmy choice: Henry Cavill\n\nThe maid in a low cut uniform who’s ogled by the entire cast is often forgotten when thinking of the core ensemble of “Clue”, and that’s a shame. Camp does good work beyond just the initial sight gag. It’s one of the few movies where the repeating ogle joke is done well, chiefly because it’s an indictment of the men staring at her instead of dealing with a life-or-death situation.\n\nAnd while the internet does want to see Aubrey Plaza in every single role (actually wait, can we just do that version) and she can smolder on demand, I do feel like this is the place to really feature someone who’s captured the zeitgeist of cultural desire. Now Chris Hemsworth has done this sort of role before and he’s good at it, but he has a tendency to steal scenes. Henry Cavill has a quieter, more complementary presence, he has underrated comic delivery, and he’s more suited to ensemble work. Let’s just not dehydrate him for days on end this time; I’m sure Cavill looks just fine without risking his life.\n\nMR. BODDY\n\noriginally: Lee Ving\n\nthe popular choice: Ryan Reynolds\n\nmy choice: Taika Waititi\n\nIn the original, Mr. Boddy only appears briefly to chew out and threaten his dinner guests before being mysteriously murdered. This is the place where you can stunt cast – Bradley Cooper, Idris Elba, Taylor Swift, you name it.\n\nIt’s also where many stick Ryan Reynolds because – hey, that’s a stunt cast, he’s good at leveling off a quickfire round of insults, and it lets you cast the guy who’s getting the movie made without sacrificing a larger part.\n\nI’d personally love to see Taika Waititi bounce in, insult and extort everyone, and then get candlesticked. We probably each have our own preference. Ali Wong could also knock a part like this out beautifully.\n\nThere are various other roles that come and go, but there’s no reason to assume they’d be a must in a remake. The leading suggestion for the Singing Telegram is – you’ll never guess! – Aubrey Plaza. I feel kind of bad not finding a role for her because I love her work, but in casting this I find myself really wanting to stay away from actors who specialize in one personality type. That includes Reynolds and Bateman as well. All three of them are great at what they do and suited to any number of other projects, but I want to see a “Clue” that asks its actors to be light-footed. The original’s unpredictable timings and delivery, the way its cast hands jokes off to each other so smoothly…that’s what I want to see and that’s a different sort of comedy.\n\nThere’s no real need to stick to the character types so extraordinarily realized in the original. There are so many “Clue” variants you could easily find new characters to fit other actors. Sticking to the original roles just gives us a framework to suggest a cast.\n\nI find most dream casting write-ups tend to feature an expensive, ideal cast where everyone can show off and…that’s just not the way movies are budgeted and made. If everyone’s one-lining like Ryan Reynolds, then you might have an amusing movie but not one that feels like “Clue”.\n\nYou need complementary pieces, which is why I suggest a mix of name, character, and satirical actors. That often makes for more functional casts, especially when it comes to ensemble comedies.\n\nThat gives us a final cast:\n\nWadsworth – Daniel Radcliffe\n\nMrs. White – Claudia O’Doherty\n\nMiss Scarlet – Josie Totah\n\nProfessor Plum – Bryan Cranston\n\nMrs. Peacock – Niecy Nash\n\nColonel Mustard – Diane Morgan\n\nMr. Green – Martin Freeman\n\nYvette – Henry Cavill\n\nMr. Boddy – Taika Waititi\n\nThe original “Clue” is on Amazon, Roku, Philo, Sling, and can be rented on a number of other platforms.\n\nSubscribe to my Patreon!

It was one of my first obsessions as a kid and I’m still convinced it’s near-perfect. And how can something like that be improved on? That said, I am ecstatic about the news of a Ghostbusters reboot, and I think Paul Feig’s idea for an all-female cast is fantastic.\n\nThe funny thing about Ghostbusters is that it was a huge success that didn’t produce a stream of knockoffs. The only movie in the 30 years since that comes close to capturing the same blend of comedy, thrills, and characters is Men in Black. It’s hard for me to come up with any other movie (excluding parodies like Shaun of the Dead) that strikes the same tone. Ghostbusters pretty much stands alone, which is unique for such a cultural touchstone.\n\nThere has been much handwringing in Ghostbusters Fanboy Land about what a catastrophe this movie is going to be because the magic of That Cast at That Time can never be reproduced. And also, women (?!?) or something. But Paul Feig’s decision to do a hard reboot of the franchise negates those fears. He’s not aiming to reproduce that magic. He’s going to find new magic with These Comedians in These Times using what is sure to be a cast of the most powerhouse female comedians out there. You won’t be able to compare them to Bill Murray at his most charming because the franchise will be something different.\n\nGhostbusters is a fun idea that still feels original, but there are a few core things that I hope will remain in the reboot. The first is that it’s ultimately a character-based comedy. It’s not a parody, it’s not referential. It totally stands on its own. There is also something so deliciously New York about it. There’s a kind of grime and grittiness to it that adds so much to the texture of the movie. It’s that kind of specificity and attention to detail that makes the movie soar. It’s the cheap local commercial they make, the headlines they get in the New York Post and the old, beat up firehouse they use to set up their business. That, to me, is the flavor of Ghostbusters that can’t be lost. And Feig, as the creator of Freaks and Geeks and director of Bridesmaids, is the perfect person to create a detailed, character-based comedy. But with ghosts in it.\n\nThat said, the structure of this article actually goes against everything I’ve been saying in that the esteemed Mr. Valdez has asked me to choose actors based on equivalent parts in the original cast. [Yeah, sorry about that, everyone disobeyed anyway – Gabe] I don’t think Feig is going to do that. And it’s going to be a better movie for it. But I’ll do my best to distill what was great about the original cast.\n\nTHE PANEL\n\nGabriel: Joining me are actress and filmmaker S.L. Fevre, filmmaker Ben Kahn, actress Rachel Ann Taylor, filmmaker Kevan Tucker, and our creative director Vanessa Tottle. Everyone’s written here before, I believe, except for Ben, who joins us for the first time.\n\nTHE LEAD (The Bill Murray)\n\nGabriel: The biggest question of all is, Who’s our Bill Murray? He played Dr. Peter Venkman, and was the comedic core of the original Ghostbusters. There aren’t many actors capable of his legendary deadpan – who can replace that?\n\nKevan: Peter Venkman worked so well because he always had a healthy dose of skepticism about the whole ordeal and also served as the romantic lead. I think Emma Stone would be a perfect choice. She’s the only person I cn think of who is deft enough to come close to the blend of charm, cynicism, and anarchy of Bill Murray. She wouldn’t be Bill Murray at all. But she’s someone you can hang a movie on. And goddamn it’s just about impossible to dislike her.\n\nSL: I think it would be fun to have Mindy Kaling. I don’t care that she’s casting against type. I want the funniest comedienne around. She leads ensembles better than anyone else.\n\nVanessa: Tig Notaro. A 43 year-old lesbian with a double-mastectomy? Yeah, I get why Hollywood would never do it, and that’s why most comedies today suck. They choose for celebrity instead of ability. Notaro is the best choice to fill Murray’s shoes.\n\nRachel: I love Ellen Page. I imagine her leading this group while she doubts what’s happening and whether she should even be there.\n\nGabriel: I couldn’t find anyone I was happy with until my brain struck on Parker Posey. The deadpan, the cynicism. Everything about her was perfect. Could she hold the audience at arm’s length? Could she be a little too aloof for mass appeal? That’s always a danger, and at the last minute I realized a better solution: Aubrey Plaza. She can communicate that same easygoing disaffection, she has her own uniquely dry delivery, and she can do aloof, but she also offers that everyman accessibility – especially with her work in smaller films like Safety Not Guaranteed and Life After Beth, in which she marries that dry delivery to a great deal of underlying heart.\n\n[Ben was a bit inundated and couldn’t discuss at length, but he got off a list for us.]\n\nBen: Sandra Bullock.\n\nTHE ENSEMBLE\n\nGabriel: How about the rest of the team, played by Dan Ackroyd, Harold Ramis, and Ernie Hudson in the original? Ackroyd served as the straight man, charmingly translating the exposition to which Murray and Ramis reacted. Ramis was the most bookish of the crew, taking scientific readings even as he issued dire supernatural warnings. Hudson was Winston Zeddmore, brought on to help the team when they become inundated with calls about the supernatural.\n\nKevan: (joining Emma Stone) I would love to see Amy Poehler in the Dan Ackroyd role. He ended up being more of the straight man in the original. But character-wise, he was the entrepreneur. He was the one who pushed everyone to get the company off the ground. I would love to see Poehler being the driving force of the operation. The one who cares a little too much.\n\nThe other two comedians I’d love to see in the movie are Kristen Wiig and Jessica Williams. Kristen Wiig has such a fantastic deadpan that would really round out the group. And Jessica Williams, who I admittedly haven’t seen act outside of The Daily Show, has a brilliant pushy New York energy that the movie needs.\n\nYou could go either way with them. In the original Ghostbusters, Harold Ramis was the scientist who added the modicum of scientific legitimacy that was needed in the group. And Ernie Hudson was the outsider who had no business being a Ghostbuster, but was dragged along when the shit hit the fan. With this cast, either Wiig is the nerdy scientist and Williams is the young intern who joins the group. Or you could also switch it up and have Williams be the brilliant, fast-talking scientist and Wiig be the person you never expected to be a Ghostbuster who rises to the occasion.\n\nSL: (joining Mindy Kaling) I guess I’m not trying to fit the type. The quality I want is being able to make me laugh. Mindy Kaling has a bite, so Krysten Ritter is a perfect pairing. Sour and sweet. Ritter was amazing in Don’t Trust the B- in Apartment 23, but she showed a completely different side of herself on Breaking Bad. I think she’s the most dynamic comedienne around.\n\nCharlize Theron was so good in Arrested Development that I wish she did more comedy. I really like the idea of her being the group’s nerd and scientifically laying down why ridiculous things are happening in a way that seems simple but that no one else understands.\n\nFor the normcore woman, Nasim Pedrad. She has so much range. She deserves so much better than the crappy sitcom she’s in.\n\nVanessa: (joining Tig Notaro) The Ackroyd is so obvious I’ll be really pissed off if anyone chooses different: Amy Poehler. She is the beacon of frustrated idealism on television, why not do the same on film? I also like the idea of her having to cope with Tig Notaro.\n\nFor the scientist, Sarah Silverman. I want her to explain make-believe to everyone as if they’re dumbasses for not getting it, and then casually mention the end of the world so briefly it’s barely noticed.\n\nI really remember vividly that scene where Ernie Hudson talks about the Bible and the End of Days. When I was young, that scared me. There’s no one I want bringing down the group and giving it a reality check more than Sandra Bullock. I get why that’s not what she normally plays in a comedy, but does anyone doubt she can play whatever role she wants to? I also like that she enters partway through as the outsider and isn’t the focal point.\n\nRachel: (joining Ellen Page) I like Emily Blunt. She can deliver exposition and give drive and focus to the group. Jessica Williams could be a great scientist. She already tells me how the world’s ending four nights a week on The Daily Show. I like Krysten Ritter for the Hudson role. Very innocent, no idea what she’s getting herself into. I like it.\n\nGabriel: (joining Aubrey Plaza) I switched back and forth between two women for the Ackroyd role: Emily Blunt and Kristen Wiig. Ultimately, though, I think Wiig’s the woman for it. She’s worked with Feig before, but I don’t actually put a high priority on that. It’s more that she’s often slotted into the kookiest, showiest roles, and on the rare occasion where she’s gotten to play the more down-to-earth straight man, the cleverness of her humor shows through and lends her a touching humanity.\n\nComedy that reveals humanity…I guess that’s what I’m going for across the board, because I think that’s what the original Ghostbusters communicates beautifully. Jessica Williams is my choice for the scientist of the group. I really didn’t expect so many others to share that view, but I think she could be the force of the group, the deliverer of dire consequences who dives head-first into doing the riskiest thing anyway.\n\nFinally, Krysten Ritter. I’m really pleased so many people are listing her. She’s been my favorite screen (i.e. non-standup) comedian since her lead role in Don’t Trust the B- in Apartment 23, and for good reason – she’s hilarious. She can do very charming, human comedy, and she can pull off absurdism as well as any comedian I know. And what’s Ghostbusters, if not a set of comedians looking at the absurd and responding in the most deadpan way possible? Her and Wiig are, I think, the most complete comedians in my group.\n\nBen: Melissa McCarthy, Maya Rudolph, Mindy Kaling, Olivia Munn.\n\nTHE LOVE INTEREST (The Sigourney Weaver)\n\nGabriel: Sigourney Weaver’s Dana Barrett plays a major part as the love interest, later possessed by a demon named Zuul whose chief diabolical power seems to be showing off her legs. In keeping with the theme, let’s assume this is gender-switched. What hunk fills Sigourney’s shoes?\n\nKevan: Bradley Cooper (or Jon Hamm). You need someone who’s a bit of a heartthrob and can be a legit aspirational love interest for Emma Stone. But they also need to be game and have comedy chops.\n\nSL: I don’t know how well-known Michael Ealy is, but I love pairing him with Mindy Kaling. He’s so easygoing and sweet. He’s accepting, but his beauty makes him feel hard to get no matter how nice he is. And he can do comedy.\n\nVanessa: I’m pairing off Tig Notaro, so I want someone complex and intimidating in the same way. David Duchovny. That gives me some older actors, but I don’t care – he’s still hot and he can show off his legs all day long.\n\nRachel: Bradley Cooper. Not even a competition.\n\nGabriel: Joseph Gordon-Levitt, the king of cool in my book. He’s suave, he’s dapper, he’s nice, he’s old-fashioned, he can do comedy in his sleep, and it’s easy to be invested in him.\n\nBen: Love Interest(s) for Sandra, Melissa, and Maya – Keanu Reeves, Chris Pratt, and Jon Hamm.\n\nTHE. RICK. MORANIS.\n\nGabriel: Oh boy, Rick Moranis. The role of Lewis Tully was originally written for John Candy to provide Bill Murray with ineffectual competition for Dana’s (Sigourney Weaver) affections. When Moranis took the role instead, he converted Tully to a geekier stereotype, and he’s possessed halfway through Ghostbusters by a demon referred to as the Keymaster. Who takes over this role, full of facial and physical comedy?\n\nKevan: (competing with Emma Stone for Bradley Cooper’s affections) Paul Feig shouldn’t make anything and leave Melissa McCarthy out. And as much as I’d like to see her suit up in a Ghostbusters uniform, she might actually be better in the smaller, showier role that Rick Moranis killed in the original.\n\nSL: (competing with Mindy Kaling for Michael Ealy’s affections) There’s no way this movie should be made without Aubrey Plaza in it. She needs an opportunity to show off and go nuts in some movie. I think she’d kill it.\n\nVanessa: (competing with Tig Notaro for David Duchovny’s affections) Emma Stone. Maybe that creates a Lolita situation, but why not? That’s nothing new for Duchovny (as a character). The only thing not on Stone’s resume is a dark comedic role. I like her for that.\n\nRachel: (competing with Ellen Page for Bradley Cooper’s affections) OK. People won’t like this. I could be adding too much narrative, but take a deep breath, everyone: Alektra Blue. The porn star. I like Ellen Page encountering someone so perfected, and who completely outclasses her in every physical way. In 80s movies, the class nerd always got the girl when the mean jock proved too inhuman. Why not invert that, especially when inhuman is something you can literally become in Ghostbusters? Blue is also a great physical comedian in many of her movies and I can’t imagine anyone pulling off Rick Moranis as aggressively.\n\nGabriel: (competing with Aubrey Plaza for Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s affections) Man, and I thought I was being edgy with Natasha Leggero. I want someone in that cast who’s a dangerous comedian, who has a threat to her and can unbalance an entire cast with a look. Leggero wouldn’t seem it – she’s a petite brunette – but she’s my favorite acidic stage comedian, and I think that level of digging under someone’s skin could bring out Plaza that much more. Leggero has guested in nearly every counter-culture comedy there is, but most recently, she’s left a swathe of boozy, passive-aggressive destruction through Garfunkel & Oates. She can also shift from hyper-aware to oblivious at the drop of a hat, from judgmental to easygoing. She has a sociopathic charm that has just enough wink to it to make you realize it’s a put-on, but in her roles, that translates to never being sure what the hell she’s about to do.\n\nBen: Cameron Diaz.\n\nANYONE ELSE?\n\nGabriel: Any other recastings you’d like to see? Secretary Janine Melnitz (Annie Potts) delivered a ton of personality in a small role. There’s the demon Gozer (Slavitza Jovan), set on ending the world. EPA suit Walter Peck (William Atherton) shows up and shuts the Ghostbusters down partway through the original. Will we see the Paul Reubens Gozer originally planned?\n\nKevan: I’d love to see Louis CK as the frustrated guy behind the desk or the put-upon maintenance guy they hire to keep the place running. I can’t see anyone other than Parker Posey as the slimy government agent trying to shut them down…although I heard that Gillian Anderson is vying for a role in the movie and this would be a pretty awesome place for her.\n\nSL: I want to see Martin Short as the secretary so bad it’s not even funny. It’s a compact way for him to play off the cast without interrupting them. Mel Gibson as Gozer, because I can’t think of anyone who would be so evil and hilarious to see. Janeane Garofalo should be the EPA chief.\n\nVanessa: Kevin Spacey should answer phones. Tig Notaro can put him in his place if he acts out too much, and he’ll be happy for it. I want to see Amy Adams as Gozer. I can see her taking the role so many different places. Katey Segal for the EPA guy.\n\nRachel: I’ve always wanted Sam Rockwell to answer my phone. Make him the Ghostbusters’ secretary. Crispin Glover for Gozer. Who else? And Ellen Degeneres would be hilarious for the EPA suit.\n\nGabriel: These are all such amazing answers. Alan Arkin to answer the phones. He could get that same energy Annie Potts had, of not wanting to take any of your shit but also being super-supportive and happy for the Ghostbusters. Gozer = Crispin Glover, why are we even still talking about it? And since I bumped her from the lead for Aubrey Plaza, Parker Posey as the EPA threat, with agents Garfunkel and Oates choosing some very special moments to bumble around in the background.\n\nBen: Villain – Sigourney Weaver (surprise cameo). Assistant – Bill Eichner. Cameos by Meryl Streep, Will Smith, and Robert Downey Jr. as hauntees/ghosts.\n\nKevan: And I’m sure that Paul Feig will come up with something way more amazing than that. There are so many people who would be amazing. I mean, don’t we all kind of want to see Maria Bamford trying not to cross the streams? Or Tina Fey being slimed? The possibilities are endless on this one. I can’t wait.\n\nOUR FINAL CASTS\n\nKevan’s Ghostbusters\n\nThe Lead – Emma Stone\n\nThe Entrepreneur – Amy Poehler\n\nThe Scientist – Jessica Williams\n\nThe Normcore – Kristen Wiig\n\nThe Love Interest – Bradley Cooper\n\nThe Rick Moranis – Melissa McCarthy\n\nThe Secretary – Louis CK\n\nThe EPA agent – Parker Posey\n\nSL’s Ghostbusters\n\nThe Lead – Mindy Kaling\n\nThe Entrepreneur – Krysten Ritter\n\nThe Scientist – Charlize Theron\n\nThe Normcore – Nasim Pedrad\n\nThe Love Interest – Michael Ealy\n\nThe Rick Moranis – Aubrey Plaza\n\nThe Secretary – Martin Short\n\nThe Demon Lord – Mel Gibson\n\nThe EPA agent – Janeane Garofalo\n\nVanessa’s Ghostbusters\n\nThe Lead – Tig Notaro\n\nThe Entrepreneur – Amy Poehler\n\nThe Scientist – Sarah Silverman\n\nThe Normcore – Sandra Bullock\n\nThe Love Interest – David Duchovny\n\nThe Rick Moranis – Emma Stone\n\nThe Secretary – Kevin Spacey\n\nThe Demon Lord – Amy Adams\n\nThe EPA agent – Katey Segal\n\nRachel’s Ghostbusters\n\nThe Lead – Ellen Page\n\nThe Entrepreneur – Emily Blunt\n\nThe Scientist – Jessica Williams\n\nThe Normcore – Krysten Ritter\n\nThe Love Interest – Bradley Cooper\n\nThe Rick Moranis – Alektra Blue\n\nThe Secretary – Sam Rockwell\n\nThe Demon Lord – Crispin Glover\n\nThe EPA agent – Ellen Degeneres\n\nGabriel’s Ghostbusters\n\nThe Lead – Aubrey Plaza\n\nThe Entrepreneur – Kristen Wiig\n\nThe Scientist – Jessica Williams\n\nThe Normcore – Krysten Ritter\n\nThe Love Interest – Joseph Gordon-Levitt\n\nThe Rick Moranis – Natasha Leggero\n\nThe Secretary – Alan Arkin\n\nThe Demon Lord – Crispin Glover\n\nThe EPA agent – Parker Posey (with agents Garfunkel & Oates)\n\nBen’s Ghostbusters\n\nThe Lead – Sandra Bullock\n\nEnsemble – Melissa McCarthy\n\nEnsemble – Maya Rudolph\n\nEnsemble – Mindy Kaling\n\nEnsemble – Olivia Munn\n\nLove Interest – Keanu Reeves\n\nLove Interest – Chris Pratt\n\nLove Interest – Jon Hamm\n\nThe Rick Moranis – Cameron Diaz\n\nThe Secretary – Billy Eichner\n\nThe Demon Lord – Sigourney Weaver\n\nLast night, we got a few of our writers on e-mail to talk about news that Myst, a 1993 adventure game that pioneered such shocking new technologies as the CD-ROM and Quicktime, will become a TV show. We tossed around what we’d like to see in the show and cast it up.\n\nGabriel: Joining me are our creative director Vanessa Tottle, editor Eden O’Nuallain, and contributor Himura Sachiko. So, they’re making Myst into a TV series, or an interactive series, or some kind of toasty grilled sandwich. What do we each want to see in a Myst TV series?\n\nVanessa: I want silence. The genre Myst belongs to is different from every other form of gaming because it is about a player’s interior experience. There is no dialogue, there is nothing to shoot with a gun. Now and again, one flips a switch or climbs a staircase. It’s about discovery and making mental connections.\n\nEden: I’d rather see a Riven TV series.\n\nSachiko: Everyone plays Myst differently. I liked to go back and forth between the different Ages and treat Myst Island like a home base. Like I progressed a little in every Age, but went home every night to the creepy library on my lonely island.\n\nGabriel: My biggest fear is that they’ll allow a group dynamic. You know, instead of one person being lost on Myst and its adjoining worlds, it’ll be a bunch of 30 year-olds playing teenagers, wearing fashionable shit, wondering why their cell phones don’t work, and out-bantering each other in the wilds of British Columbia.\n\nTHE LEAD ACTOR\n\nGabriel: Let’s assume they preserve the solo journey. Who do we want to see play our protagonist? I mean, the obvious answer is Robert Redford, but pick someone they could actually get to do it.\n\nVanessa: Sachiko played Myst like I played Skyrim. Cower in the pubs at night. Someone I don’t like. Adam Driver from Girls. I want a good actor, but I don’t want to identify with him. Any accessible character will make me miss my interior experience. I want to see a jackass who has trouble with life figure out this place in a way I never would. That way I can yell at him. I want to be smarter than the main character.\n\nEden: This whole idea is really bad, but that doesn’t mean it can’t be entertaining: Bruce Campbell.\n\nSachiko: Noah Wyle or Jewel Staite, then make it for children. Viewers are more forgiving that way. Look at Doctor Who.\n\nVanessa: Wait no! Donald Glover. I officially change my vote to Donald Glover.\n\nGabriel: Childish Gambino himself…Stephanie Leonidas would be interesting. She already did it in Mirrormask, which was basically Neil Gaiman Jazzpunk Myst. She’s accessible, and could lend the proceedings a little awe and wonder. Ultimately, I’d go with Michelle Ryan, though, because nothing prepares you for Myst like EastEnders and Bionic Woman. Really it’s because I think she’s a good facial actor who could pull off a mostly silent series about discovery. Which we won’t get, but we’re pretending we will. For some reason, I also picture Tim Russ (from Star Trek: Voyager) wandering Myst Island. But, you know, with a tricorder.\n\nEden: If I have to be serious, Anthony Stewart Head.\n\nAVOID AT ALL COSTS\n\nGabriel: Who would we never want to see headline this?\n\nVanessa: Star Trek? You’re such a nerd. Chris Hemsworth. Eliza Dushku. James Deen.\n\nEden: Same answer: Bruce Campbell.\n\nSachiko: Matt Smith.\n\nGabriel: Yeah, I’m sooo sorry I nerded up our conversation about Myst with Star Trek there. Alexis Bledel for me. OK, let’s cast this thing up, shall we? Atrus the father, and his two sons, Sirrus and Achenar. Sirrus was the thin one with the dastardly facial hair, and Achenar was the jovial, unkempt one. Who plays them? Keep in mind this is probably a budget series. You can use real money on only one of them.\n\nEden: I like Matt Smith, but I see your point.\n\nTHE ENSEMBLE\n\nSachiko: Atrus is Derek Jacobi. Jeremy Davies is Sirrus. Jack Black is Achenar.\n\nVanessa: I remember Sirrus the best. Throw all your money at Guy Pearce. Achenar? Simon Lane from the Yogscast. I will steal Anthony Stewart Head for Atrus.\n\nEden: Atrus – David Bowie (real money); Sirrus – Jeffrey Donovan from Burn Notice; Achenar – Aidan Turner from The Hobbit.\n\nGabriel: I think Vanessa just won with her Guy Pearce-Simon Lane combination, but for me: Atrus is Keith Allen. Sirrus is Lucy Griffiths. It’s a BBC Robin Hood mini-reunion. Achenar is Mark Addy. Yeah, that’s right, I went all the way back to The Full Monty. Save your money so you can hire Tarsem Singh to produce it, just so I can see what he does with the Stoneship Age.\n\nTHE ENDING\n\nGabriel: Ideally, how would you have the show end?\n\nVanessa: Five seasons later, the biggest show ever made, filmed on seven continents, which is the same number of dialogue lines per season. Simon Lane wins an Emmy.\n\nEden: Canceled after two episodes. Jon Stewart makes a single allusion to it on Daily Show. No one gets it. David Bowie writes three soundtracks for it.\n\nSachiko: Noah Wyle comes home but he misses all the amazing things he has seen.\n\nGabriel: Michelle Ryan becomes the protector of a thousand Ages. Bryan Cranston portrays Gehn in a spinoff series that covers the novels.\n\nVanessa: You finally named someone outside obscure British TV! I’m so proud!\n\nGabriel: Thank you, Britain couldn’t survive without BBC Wales – am I the only one who cast women?\n\nSachiko: Jewel Staite!\n\nVanessa: This was fun.\n\nTHE FINAL CASTS\n\nVanessa’s Myst\n\nProtagonist – Donald Glover\n\nAtrus – Anthony Stewart Head\n\nSirrus – Guy Pearce\n\nAchenar – Simon Lane\n\nEden’s Myst\n\nProtagonist – Anthony Stewart Head\n\nAtrus – David Bowie\n\nSirrus – Jeffrey Donovan\n\nAchenar – Aidan Turner\n\nSachiko’s Myst\n\nProtagonist – Noah Wyle/Jewel Staite\n\nAtrus – Derek Jacobi\n\nSirrus – Jeremy Davies\n\nAchenar – Jack Black\n\nGabe’s Myst\n\nProtagonist – Michelle Ryan\n\nAtrus – Keith Allen\n\nSirrus – Lucy Griffiths\n\nAchenar – Mark Addy\n\nWell, that wasn’t a complete disaster. I don’t know what we were thinking, but we hope you enjoy it."
