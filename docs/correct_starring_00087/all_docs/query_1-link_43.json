        "text": "It’s here! It’s finally here! The much loved Brit dramedy, Doc Martin, is returning to WGBX 44 with its eighth season on Wednesday, February 13 at 9pm, and it’s suffice to say that our team is dead chuffed. So much so, in fact, that we immediately began tossing about our favorite memories of the show, from the Doc’s first, grumpy moments in Portwenn to the birth of baby James, and even Louisa and Martin’s eventual wedding.\n\nAs we reminisced about the show, it quickly became obvious that the show has no shortage of funny and touching moments. But as we looked back on the show, something else became startlingly clear – the dramedy has had a fantastic number of guest stars, sharing cast members with Game of Thrones, Alien, and even a Charlie Chaplin film.\n\nNo. 10: Gemma Jones\n\nSeason 7 of Doc Martin was rife with guest stars, especially in the two final episodes of the season, ‘Facta Non Verba’ and ‘The Doctor is Out’. The gun-toting Annie Winton touched us with her desperate desire to save her husband – and it seems like that caregiver aspect is a natural fit for actress Gemma Jones. Besides playing Annie Winton, Jones has also impressed us as Madam Pomfrey in the Harry Potter Franchise, and had a reoccurring role as Bridget Jones’ Mum.\n\nNo. 9: Miriam Margolyes\n\nBut Jones isn’t the only Hogwarts graduate who’s appeared in Doc Martin. In Season 5, Episode 3, 'Born with a Shotgun,' Aunt Ruth brought the Doc to meet her reclusive neighbor, Shirley Dunwich, who was played by Miriam Margolyes – who you may know better from her role as Madam Sprout in the Harry Potter series. And if that doesn’t ring any bells, she also has had a few roles closer to home – most notably as Mother Mildred in Call the Midwife!\n\nNo. 8: Peter Vaughan\n\nAlso appearing in ‘Born with a Shotgun’ is William Newcross, the grandfather of the newly arrived (in this episode at least!) receptionist Morwenna. And while the Doc frowns on Morwenna’s use of her grandfather’s pep pills, we couldn’t help but smile when we saw who had been cast as William: Peter Vaughan, a regular in early Terry Gilliam films (Mr. Helpmann in Brazil and Winston the Ogre in Time Bandits). But more recently Vaughn has been on your screens as the blind scholar Maester Aemon in Game of Thrones.\n\nNo. 7: Katherine Parkinson\n\nSeason 2 of Doc Martin introduced us to Pauline Lamb, the Doc’s divisive receptionist – and later phlebotomist – as played by Katherine Parkinson. If Parkinson’s face seemed familiar to you, it’s probably because she played another snarky ginger: Jen Barber in The IT Crowd. Parkinson has also had a turn as a flighty mum in BBC’s new mom drama In The Club, and as Chef Felicity in Pirate Radio.\n\nNo. 6: Christopher Fairbank\n\nFor number six on our list, we’re going so Season 6… and Episode 6! The episode 'Hazardous Exposure' introduces us to Malcom Raynar, a local builder, and bit of a hypochondriac. This role is played to a tee by Christopher Fairbank, who I’d say might look familiar… but he probably wouldn’t! Fairbank is best known for his roles that use funky costuming or heavy prosthetic work – from Mactilburgh, LeeLoo’s doctor in The Fifth Element, to the high-end artifact broker in Guardians of the Galaxy.\n\nNo. 5: Amanda Abbington\n\nMary Watson in Sherlock. Miss Mardle in Mr. Selfridge. And Isobel in Season 3’s wedding episode of Doc Martin: ‘Happily Ever After’. But it seems like it’s anything but happily ever after for Amanda Abbington, who’s history of weddings and a family never do seem to run smooth – at least on our station. Rejection, broken limbs, premature childbirth and even death seem to threaten her at every turn. And while we love Abbington’s work, we can’t help but wonder – what’s she done to deserve it?!\n\nNo. 4: Claire Bloom\n\nMartin’s mother is just as grumpy as he is – and her cold exterior explains the neuroses that is so often seen in the good doctor’s interactions with other people. Margaret Ellingham is played to the hilt by Claire Bloom, who probably got her practice in as Queen Mary in The King’s Speech. But these cold roles aren’t necessarily natural for Claire Bloom, whose breakout role was that of Thereza, a warm and vibrant ballerina in Limelight – one of Charlie Chaplin’s final films.\n\nNo. 3: Andrea Riseborough\n\nAndrea Riseborough is a late-comer to this list, having just boomed into the general conscious with her amazing turns as Laura in Birdman, Mia in Black Mirror: Crocodile, and Mandy Bloom in the Nicholas Cage-led Mandy. But long before her turns in these artsy, surreal films, Riseborough guest-starred in a Doc Martin episode. ‘The Family Way’ sees her taking a turn as a sullen teenager who tells the Doc that he “seriously needs to chill.” Truer words…\n\nNo. 2: Chris O’Dowd\n\nWhile we know Chris O’Dowd for his comedic turns in IT Crowd, Bridesmaids, and Mascots, he had an early rather dramatic turn on season two of Doc Martin as Jonathan, a friend of Louisa’s father, Terry. The episode ‘On the Edge’ shows how Terry’s visit to the town brings drama – but Jonathan’s time there brings even more: diagnosed as bi-polar, he stops taking his medication during his visit, and has a massive breakdown. Definitely an O’Dowd we’re not used to seeing.\n\nNo. 1: Sigourney Weaver\n\nThe last time we visited Portwenn, a very familiar face greeted us sci-fi and horror fans. Beth Traywick, an American tourist who (naturally) didn’t see eye to eye with Martin, appeared in town for ‘Facta Non Verba’. And hidden under a good deal of expedition gear was none other than the inimitable Sigourney Weaver, best known for her turns in Alien, Ghostbusters, and Avatar. The best news? IMDB hints that we might be seeing her again this season!\n\nWhile these are our top ten cameo performances from Doc Martin, there are plenty more – let us know if you have a favorite we didn’t mention here on Facebook or Twitter!"
