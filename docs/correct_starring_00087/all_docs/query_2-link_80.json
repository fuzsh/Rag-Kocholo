        "text": "Key Takeaways:\n\n– Director Gil Kenan reveals that Louis and Dana were not considered for returns in Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire.\n\n– Rick Moranis' character, Louis Tully, had no role written for him in the Frozen Empire installment.\n\n– If more Ghostbusters films are made, Kenan desires to include Dana Barrett, portrayed by Sigourney Weaver.\n\n– Despite its shortcomings, Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire has kept fans hopeful for more from the franchise.\n\nDirector Gil Kenan Speaks on Missing Characters\n\nIn an insightful discussion with The Hollywood Reporter, Gil Kenan, the director of Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, addressed the conspicuous absence of Louis Tully and Dana Barrett in the latest franchise installment. Answering inquiries about the whereabouts of beloved characters, Kenan confessed that they were never really considered for inclusion in this iteration of the iconic series.\n\nUnwritten Roles and Hiatuses\n\nIt was revealed that no role was penned for Louis Tully, the once possessed neighbor of Sigourney Weaver's Dana Barrett in Frozen Empire. This character was brilliantly brought to life by actor Rick Moranis who has, notably, been on a showbiz break. Revealing his admiration for Moranis, Kenan stated, “I love Tully by the way. I'm a huge Rick Moranis fan. Louis Tully was an indelible element of Ghostbusters.” Suffice to say, Moranis injury-free exit from the world of cinema since 1997's Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves, left fans missing his on-screen magic.\n\nLack of Story for Dana\n\nThe absence of Dana Barrett doesn't immunize Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire from curiosity, particularly because she had a cameo in 2021's Afterlife. Kenan justified her exclusion saying, “Dana Barrett is also one of my favorite characters in these films, but there was no story for Dana Barrett in Frozen Empire.” The director assured fans that if the franchise continued, he would love to make room for Dana's character in the storyline.\n\nFan Reactions and Hope for the Franchise\n\nThe latest installment, Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, may not have hit the mark for every fan. The absence of some characters was felt, but their inclusion might not have salvaged the film from being viewed as an inconsistent follow-up to Afterlife. However, the return of some original cast members does provide a glimmer of hope to fans for future series releases. The enthusiastic fanbase eagerly anticipates the return of more original cast if the Ghostbusters franchise continues.\n\nGil Kenan's wish to include more original cast members in future films has created a sense of excitement among fans, who are keen to see how the franchise unfolds. Whether or not the comeback of Louis and Dana would have improved the cinematic experience of Frozen Empire remains a topic of debate.\n\nWe invite you to share your thoughts on this. Do you believe that the franchise could have been improved with the return of more original cast members? Share your views in the comments section."
