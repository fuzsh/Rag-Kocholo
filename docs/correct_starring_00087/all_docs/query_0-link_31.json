        "text": "Sigourney Weaver has joined the cast of Paul Feig‘s “Ghostbusters” reboot, the director tweeted on Friday.\n\n“Gang, trying to keep surprises but this is about to leak, so I’ll tell you myself: the awesome Sigourney Weaver is going to be in our movie!” he wrote.\n\nSony announced in 2014 that it would reboot the long-dormant film franchise with director Paul Feig and a female cast.\n\nThe studio subsequently revealed that Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones would play the four leads. Chris Hemsworth is also set to star, and Dan Aykroyd said in July that he would appear in a cameo in the upcoming film, which is currently in production.\n\nWeaver starred in 1984’s original “Ghostbusters” and 1989’s “Ghostbusters” II as Dana Barrett alongside Bill Murray, who joined the cast of the reboot in April after starring in the two original films as well.\n\nMost recently, Weaver starred in “Exodus: Gods of Kings” and “Chappie,” and is currently in post-production with a film titled “A Monster Calls.” She is also set to appear in the three “Avatar” sequels that will be released in 2017, 2018 and 2019.\n\n“Ghostbusters” has a release date of July 15, 2016."
