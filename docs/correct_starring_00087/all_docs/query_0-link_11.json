        "text": "Sigourney Weaver is an American actress who began her career in the early 1970s by appearing in plays. Throughout her career, she has acted in nearly 40 stage productions. She made her film debut with a minor role in Woody Allen's comedy-drama Annie Hall (1977), but her breakthrough came when she portrayed Ellen Ripley in Ridley Scott's science fiction film Alien (1979). She reprised the role in Aliens (1986), this time helmed by director James Cameron. Her performance netted her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.[1][2] She returned to the role in two more sequels: Alien 3 (1992) and Alien Resurrection (1997), neither of which were as well received.[3][4] Although originally written as a male role, Ripley is now regarded as one of the most significant female protagonists in cinema history, and consequently, Weaver is considered to be a pioneer of action heroines in science fiction films.[5][6][7]\n\nAlthough best known for her role in the Alien franchise, Weaver has fostered a prolific filmography, appearing in more than 60 films. In 1981, she starred alongside William Hurt in the neo-noir Eyewitness. Her next role was opposite Mel Gibson in the Peter Weir–directed The Year of Living Dangerously (1982).[8] She played Dana Barrett in Ghostbusters (1984), later returning to the franchise in Ghostbusters II (1989), Ghostbusters (2016), and Ghostbusters: Afterlife (2021). In 1986, Weaver starred opposite Michael Caine in the erotic thriller Half Moon Street. Her next role was primatologist Dian Fossey in Gorillas in the Mist (1988), for which she won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama. That same year, she also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture for her performance alongside Harrison Ford in Working Girl. Weaver was the first actor to have two acting wins at the Golden Globes in the same year.[9] She also received an Academy Award nomination for both films.[10]\n\nIn 1992, Weaver collaborated with Ridley Scott again, portraying Queen Isabella in 1492: Conquest of Paradise. Two years later, she appeared in the Roman Polanski–directed Death and the Maiden, in a major role opposite Ben Kingsley. Her performance in the Ang Lee–directed The Ice Storm (1997) garnered her a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.[11] She next appeared in the science-fiction comedy Galaxy Quest (1999) alongside Tim Allen and Alan Rickman.[12] She then portrayed socialite Babe Paley alongside an ensemble cast in Infamous (2006). In 2009, Weaver reteamed with James Cameron on Avatar, which remained the highest-grossing film of all time for a decade, portraying Dr. Grace Augustine.[13] She will return for multiple Avatar sequels, which are scheduled to be released throughout the 2020s, portraying the Na'vi Kiri te Suli Kìreysì'ite, while reprising her original role as Augustine in a cameo in Avatar: The Way of Water (2022). She worked with Tim Allen again on the comedy Crazy on the Outside (2010). In 2014, she collaborated with Scott for a third time on Exodus: Gods and Kings, in which she played Tuya.[14]\n\nWeaver has done extensive voiceover work and has had multiple roles in animated films, including The Tale of Despereaux (2008) and Pixar films WALL-E (2008) and Finding Dory (2016). She has narrated or appeared in 14 documentaries, such as the BBC series Planet Earth (2006) and The Beatles: Eight Days a Week (2016). Weaver has also lent her voice to three audio-books, four film soundtracks, and two video games: James Cameron's Avatar: The Game (2009) and Alien: Isolation (2014). Weaver has also voice acted on the television shows Futurama, Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero, and SpongeBob SquarePants, among others.\n\nTable featuring films with Sigourney Weaver Year Title Role Notes Ref. 1977 Annie Hall Alvy's date outside theater [17] 1978 Madman Gale [1] 1979 Alien Ellen Ripley [18] 1981 Eyewitness Tony Sokolow [19] 1982 The Year of Living Dangerously Jill Bryant [20] 1983 Deal of the Century Catherine DeVoto [21] 1984 Ghostbusters Dana Barrett [22] 1985 One Woman or Two Jessica Fitzgerald French-language role [23] 1986 Half Moon Street Dr. Lauren Slaughter [24] 1986 Aliens Ellen Ripley [25] 1988 Gorillas in the Mist Dian Fossey [26] 1988 Working Girl Katharine Parker [27] 1989 Ghostbusters II Dana Barrett [28] 1992 Alien 3 Ellen Ripley Also co-producer [29] 1992 1492: Conquest of Paradise Queen Isabella [30] 1993 Dave Ellen Mitchell [31] 1994 The Wild Swans Narrator Voice; Short film [32] 1994 Death and the Maiden Paulina Escobar [33] 1995 Copycat Dr. Helen Hudson [34] 1995 Jeffrey Debra Moorhouse [35] 1997 The Ice Storm Janey Carver [36] 1997 Alien Resurrection Ripley Clone 7 / Ripley Clone 8 Also producer [36] 1999 A Map of the World Alice Goodwin [37] 1999 Galaxy Quest Gwen DeMarco / Lieutenant Tawny Madison[note 1] [12] 2000 Company Man Daisy Quimp [38] 2001 Heartbreakers Angela Nardino / Max Conners / Olga Ivanova[note 2] [39] 2002 Tadpole Eve Grubman [40] 2002 The Guys Joan [41] 2003 Holes Louise Walker [42] 2004 Imaginary Heroes Sandy Travis [43] 2004 The Village Alice Hunt [44] 2006 Snow Cake Linda Freeman [45] 2006 The TV Set Lenny [46] 2006 Infamous Babe Paley [47] 2007 Happily N'Ever After Frieda Voice [48] 2007 The Girl in the Park Julia Sandburg [49] 2008 Vantage Point Rex Brooks [50] 2008 Be Kind Rewind Ms. Lawson [51] 2008 Baby Mama Chaffee Bicknell [52] 2008 WALL•E Axiom Computer Voice [53] 2008 The Tale of Despereaux Narrator Voice [54] 2009 Avatar Dr. Grace Augustine [55] 2010 Crazy on the Outside Vicky Zelda [56] 2010 You Again Ramona Clark [57] 2011 Cedar Rapids Marcy Vanderhei [58] 2011 Paul 'The Big Guy' [59][60] 2011 Abduction Dr. Geraldine 'Geri' Bennett [61][62] 2011 Rampart Joan Confrey [63] 2012 The Cabin in the Woods The Director [64] 2012 Red Lights Margaret Matheson [65] 2012 The Cold Light of Day Jean Carrack [66] 2012 Vamps Cisserus [67] 2014 My Depression (The Up and Down and Up of It) Swados Voice; Short film [68][69] 2014 Exodus: Gods and Kings Tuya [70] 2015 Chappie Michelle Bradley [71] 2016 Finding Dory Herself Voice [72] 2016 Ghostbusters Dr. Rebecca Gorin Cameo [73] 2016 A Monster Calls Grandma [36] 2016 The Assignment Dr. Rachel Jane [74] 2017 The Meyerowitz Stories Herself Cameo [75] 2017 Rakka Jasper Short film [76] 2020 My Salinger Year Margaret [77] 2021 The Good House Hildy Good [78] 2021 Ghostbusters: Afterlife Dana Barrett Mid-credits cameo [79] 2022 Call Jane Virginia [80] 2022 Master Gardener Mrs. Haverhill [81] 2022 Avatar: The Way of Water Kiri / Dr. Grace Augustine [82][83] 2025 Avatar 3 † Kiri Post-production [82] 2029 Avatar 4 † Filming TBA The Gorge † Filming [84] TBA Dust Bunny † Filming [85]\n\nKey † Denotes films that have not yet been released\n\nTable featuring television shows with Sigourney Weaver Year Title Role Notes Ref.
