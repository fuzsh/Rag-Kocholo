Sigourney Weaver will appear in the Ghostbusters reboot, according to a tweet from director Paul Feig.

It is unclear if the actress, who appeared in the original two films, will be reprising her role as Dana Barrett.

Weaver joins Bill Murray and Dan Akyroyd, who also starred in Ghostbusters (1984) and Ghostbusters II (1989), as returnees to the franchise, which Sony is rebooting with a female bent. Feigâ€™s film stars Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones and Chris Hemsworth. It hits theaters on July 22, 2016. Original castmember Ernie Hudson also shot a cameo.

The film recently wrapped production in Boston.

Weaver, who will star in the next three Avatar films, most recently appeared in Chappie and Exodus: Gods and Kings. She is repped by UTA and Jackoway Tyerman.
