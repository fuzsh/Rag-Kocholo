During his 37th birthday party celebration last Thursday, Diether Ocampo was asked an intriguing question from some members of the press: “Are you envious of your former wife, Kristine Hermosa, who is now pregnant by husband, Oyo Boy Sotto?”

Ocampo said yes and admitted that he is indeed envious of Hermosa’s love life but in a positive way.

“…We aspire to get into that relationship na you can tell yourself na darating din ‘yong time at bubuo din ako ng sarili kong pamilya. Sa lahat ng nangyayari sa buhay ko ay hinuhulma ako. Hindi ako naiingit na in a bad way. I would say na hindi pa time, panahon ‘yan,” the Guns and Roses star said.

“For me at this point ay marami pa akong responsibilidad na kailangan kong pangalagaan kaya masaya din naman,” he added.

Ocampo pointed out that he is happy for Hermosa and he will never stop caring for people who became part of his life.
