        "text": "Kristine Hermosa feels like a first time bride as she shares her feelings towards her upcoming wedding to Oyo Sotto.\n\n“Basta abangan nyo na lang. Very simple intimate wedding. Yun. And very private. Kasi the first one ano e bigla. Hindi din naplano and para kaming innocent kung ano ba talaga yung… parang wala kaming alam at all. So eto yung first na talagang with all the, you know, happenings talaga, at saka yung preparations yung ganyan so parang first time pa din,” Hermosa gushed in an interview through TV5’s Juicy aired recently.\n\nWhen asked if Hermosa will quit showbiz after being married, she said in an interview via ABS-CBN’s SNN, “No naman. Siguro gagawa pa rin naman ako ng mga projects pero piling-pili. Priority talaga is family. Work pa rin ako, yun after ng wedding.”\n\nOyo’s parents, Vic Sotto and Dina Bonnevie, have been mum on the details of the wedding but have both been supportive about their son’s decision to marry Kristine.\n\nMeanwhile, Kristine’s ex-husband Diether Ocampo had already extended his well wishes to the couple earlier on. “I can wish only the best for people like them, right? Of course, as much as possible, I’d rather not say anything. (Kristine and I are okay) and there are reasons why things turn out the way they do,” said Diether in a previous interview.\n\nOn September 21, 2004, Kristine was secretly married to Diether in civil rights in Jaen, Nueva Ecija. After nine months, Kristine filed for annulment on grounds that a marriage certificate was not issued. The Court of Appeals granted the annulment petition.\n\nKristine and Oyo Boy met on the set of “Enteng Kabisote 2” in 2005, where Vic Sotto, Oyo’s father played the leading role and Kristine, the leading lady. Their friendship blossomed into a full-fledged romance as the two will tie the knot next year."
