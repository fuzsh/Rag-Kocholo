        "text": "What a difference a year makes. Sometime last year, Kristine Hermosa was all heart, refusing to leave then husband Diether Ocampo’s side.\n\nToday, times have changed. Kristine is savoring every minute of her single blessedness and the freedom it brings.\n\n“No one tells me what to do and what not to do,” she explains.\n\nShe can go out with Oyo Sotto, and no one will complain. But sorry, they’re not yet that way with each other, Kristine hastens to add.\n\nHow can that happen, when she’s not ready to fall in love again? In fact, she seems not have moved on after she and Diether have parted ways. Why, she’s even open to a reconciliation with Diether.\n\nThe former sweethearts have remained friends, telling each other where they are at any point in time.\n\n“He’s taping a show right now,” Kristine answers when asked about Diether’s whereabouts.\n\nShe has not even bothered asking the lawyer the status about their pending marriage annulment case.\n\nAnd she has yet to find someone to replace him in her heart. No suitor has yet duplicated that spark, that unmistakable tingle Kristine felt in Diether’s presence.\n\n“It’s hard,” she sighs. “I’m not ready to fall in love again.”\n\nKristine’s romance with Diether has taught her a thing or two about love and life.\n\n“I’m more careful now, more choosy,” she relates. “I can sense when a guy is just taking me for a ride.”\n\nThat been-there-done-that feeling has made Kristine, at 25, less willing to believe everything she sees, but still ready to take a chance at love again.\n\nBut that won’t happen anytime soon, though.\n\n“It’s hard to find somebody you can connect with, someone who brings out that certain spark,” she explains.\n\nAt the presscon announcing her as the first celebrity endorser of Aescultura cosmetic clinic, Kristine admitted she hasn’t checked the status of a petition to annul her marriage to Diether. She may not say it, but you can see how much Kristine is still hanging on to that love of many years back.\n\n“Now that you mention it,” she says on second thought, “I will ask the lawyer about the case tomorrow.”\n\nBut her actions speak louder than words. Her love for Diether has not faded away all these years. Not even if showbiz insiders see more than meets the eye in the way she and Oyo Sotto go out often these days.\n\n“No, he’s not my boyfriend,” she hastens to add. “I have many boy friends I hang out with aside from Oyo. Some of them are non-showbiz so people don’t know about them.”\n\nPerhaps reading Kristine’s mind, the brains behind Aescultura are not averse to getting Diether as her male counterpart, although Jericho Rosales is also on the list.\n\n“I think it’s about time I endorse again because it’s been some time since I’ve been tapped as endorser. I’m glad I was chosen. I trust Aescultura because the doctors there are experienced and they really take care of the patients,” says Kristine."
