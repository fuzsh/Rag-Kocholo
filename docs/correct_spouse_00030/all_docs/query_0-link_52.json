Sa lahat ng nangyayari sa buhay ko ay hinuhulma ako. Hindi ako naiingit na in a bad way. I would say na hindi pa time, panahon ‘yan,” the Guns and Roses star said.\n\n“For me at this point ay marami pa akong responsibilidad na kailangan kong pangalagaan kaya masaya din naman,” he added.\n\nOcampo pointed out that he is happy for Hermosa and he will never stop caring for people who became part of his life."
