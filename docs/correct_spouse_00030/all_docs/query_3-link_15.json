        "text": "Kristine Hermosa is busy nowadays. She is shooting a movie with Sam Milby and Toni Gonzaga titled Big Love. She is also back on television for a new afternoon drama on ABS-CBN called Prinsesa ng Banyera. Kristine shared some of her thoughts over dinner with PEP (Philippine Entertainment Portal) at the presscon of Prinsesa ng Banyera in a restaurant in Taguig last night, September 25. MARRIAGE TO DIETHERM Kristine clarified that what she filed in the Court is a nullification of her marriage to Diether Ocampo and not an annulment. The couple was married in a civil rite in Nieva Ecija on September 12, 2004, but the actress filed for nullification on June 21, 2005. \"Para sa akin, wala naman talagang nangyaring kasal,\" she stated. \"Para sa akin kung mali talaga 'yon from the start, e, hindi naman legal, e, di tapusin na 'yan. Tapusin na natin para maituwid na natin, para maayos na natin. Para next time na magpakasal kami ulit, e, yung sure na sure na.\" Should the courts allow the nullification, would she still marry Diether again? \"Why not?\" she said brightly. But when asked about reports that the nullification has been granted, she said, \"Wala pa pong nagsasabi sa akin. Hindi ko alam kung tapos na or kung hindi pa tapos, basta ang alam ko, hindi pa tapos.\" LOVELIFE Kristine is also reportedly dating a guy named Rajiv. People who saw her say they were very sweet to each other. Her family went to Hong Kong where her dad is now working. When asked about a photo that shows her being kissed by Rajiv, she vehemently denied this. \"Hindi po totoo 'yon,\" she quipped. She admitted though that her heart belongs to someone right now. Who's the guy? She was quick to say \"Diether.\" But people say Diether has grown tired of waiting for her. \"Huwag ka maniwala doon. Hindi siya nababaliw sa kakahintay. Gumagawa siya ng paraan. Ayus-ayusin niya lang yung panliligaw,\" she jested. In her assessment, her relationship with Diether is fine. \"Maayos naman po talaga, overall. Hindi natin puwedeng i-discount yung fact na naging maganda talaga yung relationship namin. Siguro kailangan lang namin ng time and space para ayusin yung bawat isa. Pero hindi ko rin naman sinasabi na âthe end' ngayon,\" she said. She also narrated that Diether planned a surprise birthday party for her last September 9. \"Nagulat ako kasi sinurprise ako ni Diet. Nag-prepare siya ng surprise party para sa akin. Tapos, nasa bahay yung Mom ko. Tapos, nagulat ako, alam ko kasi hindi sila nag-uusap. Wala akong kaalam-alam. May picture pa nga, nag-picture pa sila together. Sabi ko, âOy, iba 'to!' Parang natutuwa ako sobra. Tuwang-tuwa ako!\" - Philippine Entertainment Portal"
