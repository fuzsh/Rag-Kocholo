        "text": "Can old dogs in showbiz still learn new tricks?\n\nApparently yes, according to Diether Ocampo, who has been an actor and talent of ABS-CBN for 15 years now.\n\nHis new mentor is Philippine Cinema's \"Bad Boy,\" Robin Padilla, who stars with him in the ABS-CBN's primetime action-drama series, \"Guns and Roses.\"\n\nAlthough Robin is just three years older than Diether, 37, the latter has come to call the action star “the maestro” or master.\n\nThe ‘kuya’ Diet never had\n\nIt was Robin, he said, who guided him through their “explosive fight scenes” together.\n\nIt was Robin who inspired him to take on the physical training he did so he could survive his action scenes.\n\nIt was Robin who became, said Diether, “the older brother I never had” because Robin would mentor him in “some scenes” and was always approachable whenever he needed advice.\n\nDiet was also floored by Robin’s humility, even if the latter was the bigger star.\n\n“I learn on the job and I can never repay him for the experience,” Diet added.\n\nHe knows “the maestro” got his depth of acting not just from the many roles he has played but also from his life experiences, including his many struggles and achievements.\n\nJail time\n\n\"What is commendable is how he survived the hardest obstacles in his life,” Diether mused. In 1995, Robin was sentenced to 21 years in jail for illegal gun possession, but was released in 1998 after then Senator Ramon Revilla Sr. passed a bill commuting the sentence of those convicted of Robin’s crime. He also converted to Islam in jail.\n\nBecause Robin is known as much for his colorful love life—he was linked at one time or another with Sharon Cuneta and Kris Aquino and rushed into marriage with TV host Mariel Rodriguez—we asked Diether if he ever sought advice about women or romance from the Bad Boy.\n\n\"The 'maestro' is also a quiet person and is secretive. I also didn't want to pry on his personal life. Besides he is not the type who would give unsolicited advice,\" Diether replied.\n\nLove life\n\nDiether, whose marriage to actress Kristine Hermosa was annulled, is now single and denies that romance is brewing between him and Kris Aquino, who he calls his “best friend.”\n\n\"My love life is sluggish,” he said. “But it's balanced by a good career and big projects.”\n\nDiether Ocampo is looking forward to doing a family drama he plans to produce with Star Cinema."
