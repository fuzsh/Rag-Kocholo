        "text": "You got to watch Gavy V @ 23 this coming Sunday on Channel 2 after Pinoy Dream Academy. This is one of the best Gary V concert that I’ve seen. We watched the last show last Sept. 8 and all the Gary V fans out there would agree that after 23 years, Gary V. still has that magic. There will also be a re-run in October in Music Museum, maybe you might want to catch that instead.\n\nWhat I like about the show is that they used rectangular LCD panels to enhance the performances. I’ve seen this used also in musical broadway shows. In the particular photo above, the rectangular LCD screens transformed into large speakers as Gary and son, Gaby danced passionately to the song “Di Bale Na Lang.” This is only one of the attractions in the show and I’ll give you a sneak peek on this concert.\n\nBTW, Let me know what you think after watching the concert this Sunday in TV.\n\nI had a hard time capturing this photo, because of the bright lights from the video screens/ projector. But I’m glad I was able to capture this moment.\n\nThis was a cool treat from Gary singing “Huwag mo na Sana” with his daughter, Keana Valenciano as back-up vocals in the background video.\n\nGary serenading the crowd. This is one of the kilig moments and my wife wish that we bought the center tickets.\n\nGary and Gaby playing with techno music from their mac powerbook.\n\nThis was hilarious! Gary V imitating Martin and his facial expressions.\n\nBooganda jamming with Gary V with the medley of Hataw na, Sayaweh, and Shout for Joy! This was fun and these band group is coincidentally from the pep squad of Lasalle Greenhills — Animo Lasalle!\n\nEncore Song. Gary sings a dedicated to Kristine Hermosa who was celebrating her birthday, as requested by Diether Ocampo. They were seated in the middle so this is an incentive for buying those center aisle tickets."
