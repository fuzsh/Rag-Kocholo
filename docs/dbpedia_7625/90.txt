Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the second woman to serve on the Supreme Court, became the first woman to lie in state in the United States Capitol on Friday.

The rare distinction was announced on Monday by Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Justice Ginsburg, who died on Sept. 18 at 87, “fought for our values til the end,” Ms. Pelosi said on Twitter. Her death, the speaker said, was an “incredible devastating loss for America.”

Ahead of Friday’s ceremony at the Capitol, Justice Ginsburg lay in repose outside the Supreme Court on Wednesday and Thursday, her flag-draped coffin positioned under the portico atop the building’s front steps.

The practice of paying tribute to distinguished public servants by having them lie in state at the Capitol dates to 1852 and is among the rarest of posthumous tributes for government officials in the United States. As such, the language and customs of the ceremony might be unknown to many.

Here are some of the basics.

The terms are often used interchangeably, but there are subtle differences.

By strict definition, lying in state is reserved for those who served in the government, and it applies only to the time their coffins are displayed in the Capitol or a government building, either in Washington or at the state level. The ceremony is accompanied by a military guard.
