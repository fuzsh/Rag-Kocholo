        "text": "January 20, 2024\n\nThis was amazing. A rich gallery of characters that felt real and complex, and a killer plot rich with unanswered question that really had me guessing and suspecting everyone. I had right in my initial suspicion however, but was sidetracked and thought I must have been wrong. I love to be fooled however, especially when I’m being entertained as well. Very clever, and expertly told.\n\nAugust 11, 2024\n\n4.5⭐️\n\nEmilia Ward,bestselling detective novelist, lives a quiet life with her second husband and two children in a London suburb. Emilia is almost finished with her latest and possibly the final installment in her popular Miranda Moody series. Writing a best-selling series has been taxing and this last book has proved to be especially challenging. But truth becomes stranger than fiction for Emilia when an incident mirroring a scene from one of her books occurs in real life. This is not an isolated incident and it seems that someone is trying to send her a message using her own fiction against her. After a shocking incident that is eerily similar to a plot point from her unpublished manuscript, Emilia begins to suspect that the threat is closer to home since the draft was shared with a select few in her close circle and she begins to fear for her family’s safety.\n\nDoes someone know Emilia’s secret – a truth that has been hidden from most in her close circle? Is she being targeted for the same reason? Is her family in danger? Could someone close to her be responsible for all that is happening or is she being paranoid?\n\nExceptionally well-written and intricately plotted with an intriguing premise and several interesting twists and red herrings leading up to a satisfying ending – what else could you ask for in a psychological thriller? The Woman Who Lied by Claire Douglas checked all those boxes for me. I really liked Emilia and found her to be an interesting protagonist. I’ll admit that initially, I presumed that the story would be formulaic and predictable, but I was so wrong! There was a point in the novel where almost no one in Emilia’s close circle was above suspicion.The narrative is presented from Emilia’s perspective with segments from another unnamed narrator’s perspective interspersed throughout the narrative. Cleverly structured, these segments had me confused (Who was the narrator? Segments from her unpublished manuscript? Segments from her previous installments? A new character or someone we knew? ) but as the narrative progresses, the author dials up the tension and the threads converge in a riveting denouement. The final reveal really surprised me and being proved wrong always elevates my overall experience! I was glad that the author did not incorporate some of the annoying (personal opinion, no offense intended!), overused tropes that are common in this genre to manipulate the plot.\n\nThis was my first Claire Douglas novel and I can’t wait to explore more of her work.\n\nMany thanks to Harper Perennial and Paperbacks for the digital review copy via NetGalley. All opinions expressed in this review are my own. This novel was published in the US on July 30, 2024.\n\nConnect with me! ✏ Instagram ✏ My Blog ✏ The StoryGraph\n\nAugust 29, 2023\n\nMother of two and married to her second (almost perfect husband Elliot) successful mystery series writer Emilia Ward's life becomes unsettled when an unknown person or people start replicating events in her book series in Emilia's own life! It's when events start being replicated from her unreleased latest book that Emilia realises that the person doing this must be someone she knows on her personal ARC list!\n\nIn an almost perfectly weighted mystery seen from Emilia's perspective, I got to see how a mostly contented and settled life is undermined when an unforeseen threat emerges from within undermining everything about Emilia's life and more essentially her ability to really know the people around her. This UK bestselling mystery deserves its status, as after about reading the third of the book I was absolutely unable to put it down! A very well earned 8 out of 12, Four Star read.\n\n2023 read\n\nMarch 27, 2023\n\nEmilia Ward is happily married to her second husband, Elliot, and is mother to Jasmine and Wilfie. She’s not just a wife and mum though, as she is also the bestselling author of the Miranda Moody detective stories, the 10th of which she has just written. However, after a few unsettling and weird incidents, Emilia realises these occurrences are mirroring events in her book, real life imitating art. Emilia is clearly concerned and is hyper alert, but things totally plummet when a friend dies in exactly the same way as in her new book. What is going on? How is it even possible that someone knows the contents as it’s not yet been published? Are Emilia and her family going to be the next targets?\n\nThe premise of this novel is really good and the author makes you want to understand the truth behind the escalation of the threat levels. The characterisation especially of Emilia and her family is good with all of them being well fleshed out. There are plenty of plot twists and turns and the author keeps on coming right to the very end with the final one being especially good. I like the extract from the book that are also included in the narrative.\n\nHowever, it’s slow to get going which is due to it being over detailed and over explained which halts the flow and makes it feel choppy. In all honesty I don’t feel the tension I should have been able to feel either which I think may be due to the increasing over complications and convolutions of the plot.\n\nHowever, I really like what Claire Douglas has tried to do here, the premise is clever, but it’s not quite as well executed as her other books in my opinion.\n\nWith thanks to NetGalley and especially to Michael Joseph for the much appreciated arc in return for an honest review.\n\nFebruary 25, 2024\n\n3.0 / 5\n\nThis was one frustrating read, I couldn’t deal with in the end. If you take the first 250 pages I would give this book a solid 4.5 rating, but the last 125 pages was literal dog garbage that I wanted to throw this book out a window.\n\nThe book is about an author, Emilia ward who has written a series of books based on a fictional character known as Detective Miranda Moody. Due to the books continual success, she is very well off living with her second husband and two kids. She starts to finalise her tenth book of the series, the last one where she ends up killing Miranda. She’s only submitted/ shown first edit copies of the book to her editors, publicist, and close friends/family when all of a sudden she starts getting ‘stalked’, which all stem from her 10 books (taking aspects from each book and subjecting Emilia to them). What was initially brushed off a ‘crazy fan’ ends up turning up a notch when someone close to her is murdered in a similar fashion to how Detective Moody is killed off in her last book. But only a handful of people have read the final book. Someone is out there targeting her, who could it be?\n\nI hated the last 125 pages, it was frustrating as it ended up being a finger pointing game and backtracking back on it, going a full circle with more finger pointing. I also struggled to come to term with the change in the perspective in the second part. Essentially the book shows two perspectives one about Emilia herself and one essentially from her ‘book’. But this switches and the font doesn’t change to reflect the change and I took so long to understand what was happening. And when I did understand it, Claire was like how do I drag this book out more? Oh let me just do some finger pointing blaming sesh when the ending could have been finished sooner. I hated how convoluted it got, as means to make the ending more impacting but it had the opposite effect for me. The first half of the book is decent, a shame the ending couldn’t finish at that high bar set at the start. Disappointing read, only recommend if you want to be frustrated enough to chuck something out a window.\n\nAugust 12, 2024\n\nI knew before I dove into The Woman Who Lied that I was in for quite an epic rollercoaster ride of suspense. After all, it was written by Claire Douglas. Having forever been one of my favorites, this one was unsurprisingly no different. With vividly drawn characters, an intricate plot, and unguessable secrets, there wasn’t a moment I wasn’t pulled into the story. But it was the well-plotted storyline and clever manipulation that won me over hook, line, and sinker by the final well-timed reveal.\n\nThe characters were finely layered and shockingly realistic. With deep backstories that just barely peeked through to the surface, it felt wholly genuine just as it would if you met any of them in real life. As the plot ducked and weaved, however, Emilia’s immaculately portrayed rising suspicion and paranoia had me side-eyeing each and every one of them in turn. And despite my well-honed armchair sleuthing, there wasn’t a shot of me figuring out who could be behind any of the dastardly crimes.\n\nThe plot was a pure masterpiece, in my humble opinion. Told in two parts by three interwoven plot lines, the ever rising foreboding had my fingers flying from page one. Of the three, however, my favorite was definitely the present followed closed by the book within a book, metafiction piece to the puzzle. Thanks to clever, sharp writing and plenty of dazzling twists, this multilayered humdinger blinded me to the truth. It didn’t hurt that the deftly obscured clues left out just enough to keep me happily in suspense.\n\nDone and dusted, it’s clear that this was just another testament to Douglas’s storytelling prowess. Spinning tales within tales, the teasing plot twists and non-stop suspense meant that I was done for as soon as I opened the cover. So if you’re looking for your next guaranteed home run, grab this tale of domestic suspense. Addictive, unputdownable, and utterly binge-worthy, it was nothing if not perfect for any mystery/thriller fanatic. Rating of 4.5 stars.\n\nSYNOPSIS:\n\nEmilia Ward is just an ordinary mum living happily in suburban London with her husband and two children—a teenager from her first marriage, a little boy from her second. She also happens to be the bestselling author of the Miranda Moody detective novels.\n\nBut when Emilia embarks on her tenth novel, life takes a disturbing turn: an incident straight out of the plot of one of her novels occurs in real life. Just an unsettling coincidence, she thinks.\n\nUntil it happens again—and again.\n\nThen someone she knows dies in the same way as a victim in the book she's currently writing…\n\nWhy is someone doing this?\n\nHow do they know what she is writing?\n\nAnd what if Emilia and her family are next?\n\nThank you to Claire Douglas and Harper Paperbacks for my complimentary copy. All opinions are my own.\n\nPUB DATE: July 30, 2024\n\nTrigger warning: stalking, harassment\n\nJuly 13, 2024\n\n*A Matter of Trust*\n\nThis book is full of suspense and one that will see the protagonist question who she can trust, let alone her judgment. There are also quite a few characters to keep up with.\n\nEmilia is a crime writer. She has a lovely home with her second husband and two children. She has a few close friends and she was struggling with writer’s block until one of her friend’s gives her an idea for her latest novel. The pace is quite steady until random things start to happen. Some from her previous books and weirdly one or two things from her latest book.\n\nThe strangest thing is that only her editor and a few choice friends have been privy to the draft copy of her book. You start to feel her desperation as she starts to receive things that are in her upcoming and unpublished book. She is going out of her mind trying to make sense of things. She reports things to the bored sounding police officer on the phone and when things start to get serious she is at her wits end.\n\nHer behaviour comes across as paranoid as she starts to question everything. When someone very close to her is murdered in the same style as a character in her book, she does not know who to trust and the origins of part of her story sends her into a complete meltdown. We see her accusing all those close to her of being involved as the time comes for her to admit how she came about writing a book that is very close to a real crime. Is it a coincidence or is she trusting the wrong people?\n\nMeanwhile the murderer of her close friend is parading around in plain sight? Will Emilia put the pieces together?……\n\nJune 17, 2023\n\nThere’s just something about a Claire Douglas book that feels like home to me. I feel like every single book she releases is somehow better than the one before (even though they’re fantastic too!). I was hooked from the first chapter and couldn’t put it down as I sped through this on trying to figure out who it was, and what was going on. I really enjoyed Emilia’s character and the overall book within a book vibe that this one had. If you like wild rides filled with tension and wild goose chases then you’ll love this one.\n\nThis is an easy 5 star read for me. Definitely recommend picking this one up.\n\nThank you Michael Joseph for sending me a proof of this one.\n\nJanuary 14, 2024\n\na meta mess about\n\nold sins and a search\n\nfor a serial killer, this is\n\na rich plot, multilayered,\n\nsatisfyingly complex. ♡\n\nMay 22, 2024\n\nSentimientos encontrados con este libro (3,5 estrellas), la historia esta muy bien contada pero a veces se me ha hecho pesado y lento.\n\nUna escritora de éxito escribe su último libro, con la peculiaridad de que se reproducen eventos en la vida real. Muchos giros, dudas de todos en algún momento, pero la historia personal que hila el libro se me ha hecho anodina.\n\nUn final que no esperas pero que casa muy bien con toda la investigación.\n\nJuly 22, 2024\n\nThe Woman Who Lied is a very clever mystery in which a writer starts having things happen in her life that happened in books she's written. Emilia Ward is a successful author who is married for the second time with 2 children, a teenaged girl from her first marriage and a young son from her current marriage. Her popular book series is about a detective who solves mysteries. She's on her tenth book in the series and Emilia decides it's time to kill off her main character. She wants to write something new and fresh. She's already finished the first copy of her tenth book, has sent it to her publisher, a couple of friends, and a few family members.\n\nEmilia is torn about ending the series as she doesn't want to lose her fans. She just can't face continuing the series past 10 books though. As she's waiting to hear from people about the book, disturbing things begin happening. Events that happened in the book series start happening to Emilia. Someone is trying to send her a message, but who? When things escalate and things get more upsetting, Emilia is concerned. The things that are now happening are from her tenth book and only a select few people have a copy of it. Is this person that's tormenting Emilia someone close to her? Why would someone close to her try to scare her? Will Emilia and her family be okay? The threats are getting more serious and a family member goes missing. The suspense builds and builds and I couldn't guess who was doing this!\n\nStop what you're doing and get this book! I absolutely loved The Woman Who Lied by Claire Douglas and rate it 5 stars with my very highest recommendation. I was hooked from the start when you find out the things happening are from Emilia's book series. What a clever twist to a mystery! I'd like to thank NetGalley and HarperCollins Publishing for an advanced copy of The Woman Who Lied in exchange for a fair review. I can't wait for the next Claire Douglas book! #TheWomanWhoLied\n\nJanuary 6, 2024\n\nI love books within a book! Emilia Ward is the author of Miranda Moody book series about a DCI and a serial killer. She finished Book 10 and sent it to her friends and family to read. Coincidentally Emilia has experienced strange pranks that also happens in Book 10! The premise is great! Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for a copy.\n\nJanuary 18, 2024\n\nWowwwww this is why I love this author so much, the way she writes is really eye catching as they always say in the end the truth will out …\n\nJuly 16, 2023\n\nEmilia Ward is a happily married wife and mother. She’s also a bestselling author, having realised nine successful crime novels starring Detective Inspector Miranda Moody. But then something odd happens. A scene straight out of one of her books occurs in real life. And then another one. And Emilia starts to feel concerned that she - and her family - are in serious danger.\n\nWho is targeting her? And why?\n\nThis is a book that grabs you from the start. A brilliant premise, with interesting characters and an intriguing plot, which is original and unique.\n\nFilled with red herrings I was suspicious of everyone and anyone. It’s a story within a story, which ultimately turns into one story.\n\nClever, thrilling, complex. It definitely kept me on my toes!\n\nJuly 8, 2024\n\nPlease note that I received this via NetGalley. This did not affect my rating or review.\n\nSo this one had many \"The Woman Who Lied\" but I thought Douglas did a great job giving us a main story, with another story, and a story within that. I think some readers may get confused, but I followed the threads we got and changed my mind a few times about who the \"bad guy\" was here and thought the ending was really cool and definitely I can see this one being a potential thriller of the summer. The main reason why I gave this 4.5 stars and rounded to 5 stars though is that the book purposely leaves out information if you wanted to even figure out who could have done it and why. All of a sudden we get some reveals and you get, oh this is why so and so is the bad guy. I always think that's a bit of a cheat in mystery and thriller books.\n\n\"The Woman Who Lied\" follows a bestselling mystery novelist named Emilia Ward. Emilia has a detective series that has done quite well, but she's now thinking about killing off her main character and doing something else. But when someone starts stalking Emilia and her family, it appears that person has read her not released new novel and is incorporating aspects of it into her real life. Emilia starts to wonder who could be the person doing this, and most important why.\n\nThe book follows Emilia mostly and we learn she's in her second marriage, and quite happy, though still has ties to her first husband because of the daughter they share. You quickly find out they talk, but neither of the new spouses like it for various reasons.\n\nEmilia has a jet-setting best friend and a new friend in the police force. When the incidents starts, she leans on them, but quickly wonders if they, her family or her ex could be behind things.\n\nThe book provides excerpts from Emilia's novel, but we also follow around another Detective Inspector (DI) too.\n\nThe plot was interesting and I liked the flow. I honestly didn't put this one down until I finished it. But as I said above, I called BS on the final reveal because it was things that the readers were not privy to.\n\nStill as a I said, a solid thriller/mystery I thought. I would love to read Douglas again in the future.\n\nJuly 28, 2023\n\nWhat a disappointing read! Extremely convoluted and confusing. The different voices only served to make me more confused. The identity of characters whose names then changed added to the confusion. Also, the neat little ending annoyed me. Not a ‘good read’.\n\nOctober 9, 2023\n\n4.5 ⭐️. This was 3 stories in one, which is always a bargain. Emilia is a writer, writing the last in her series and trying to kill off the main character. Another story comes in to play which appears to be from Emilia’s book. Then a third story comes into play. The author tied them all together neatly, the big shock is when the reader discovers where the stories are coming from. Also in the last third of the book you are breadcrumbed to believe a certain person is the perpetrator so much so it becomes blindingly obvious until another twist is thrown in. Well worth reading, will certainly try more from this author.\n\nJune 11, 2024\n\nSe me hizo aburrido en algunos tramos en los que se detiene en los pensamientos de la protagonista, que por otra parte no son sino giros y giros sobre lo mismo. Por lo demás es entretenido.\n\nApril 5, 2024\n\nAmongst the many reviews on the front of this book was ‘I could not put this down’ …. I literally could not wait to put this down, to stop reading it and was relieved when I got to the last page. Too many characters, I didn’t like any of them and the story was complicated and not exciting, engaging or in any way gripping. I have read so many other books in this genre that definitely tick a heck of a lot more boxes. So unfortunately it’s a 1 1/2⭐️from me.\n\nJune 3, 2024\n\nDos días me ha durado el libro, (y porque leo varios a la vez y hago más cosas, jajaja), la historia mezcla la novela de Emilia Ward con la vida de la autora, separada por capítulos mezclados pero fácilmente distinguibles. Me ha enganchado mucho, de las historias en las que llega un momento en que no sabes qué pensar, no tienes teorías y, para tí, cualquiera puede ser culpable. Me ha tenido totalmente absorbida con capítulos cortos que van de menos a más. Muy recomendable.\n\nOctober 30, 2023\n\nUnsure if I’m going to give this a 3.5 or a 4.\n\nGood story that kept me turning the page however the twist confused the SH*T out of me!!\n\nAugust 13, 2024\n\n¿Qué tienen en común Richard Castle y Emilia Ward? Pues que tanto una de mis series favoritas, como esta historia, comienzan con dos autores de novela negra encontrando inquietantes similitudes entre la vida real y sucesos que han tenido lugar en sus libros.\n\nUna autora de novelas policiacas empieza a experimentar desagradables sucesos que se parecen a hechos que ha descrito en sus historias. Es un resumen muy sencillo que a mí ya me tenía ganada, porque precisamente así empieza la serie Castle, una de mis favoritas, en la que una serie de asesinatos parece emular las muertes que describe el autor en sus libros. Así que partiendo de una premisa que ya sabía que me iba a gustar, el resultado no podía ser otro que un grandísimo sí.\n\nEstamos ante un misterio que se cuece a fuego lento, si buscáis algo con un ritmo trepidante, no lo vais a encontrar aquí, pero la narración y el goteo de pistas cada vez más siniestras te van enganchando hasta atraparte por completo en la historia.\n\nOtro punto original ha sido el libro dentro del libro, ya que, a la vez que vamos leyendo lo que le pasa Emilia, tenemos acceso al manuscrito de su última novela. Tengo que reconocer que este punto, a pesar de que es algo que me ha encantado, me ha dejado algo confusa.\n\nY por último, otro punto fuerte han sido los sospechosos. Es de esos libros en los que hasta los perros te parecen potenciales culpables. Personajes construidos para confundir y liar al lector, haciéndote sospechar hasta del apuntador. Una dinámica que me ha tenido perdidísima todo el libro.\n\n👉 No os lo podéis perder si os llama:\n\n🔍 Misterio que se cuece a fuego lento\n\n🕵🏻‍♀️ Goteo de pistas cada vez más siniestras\n\n📖 Libro dentro del libro\n\n🤔 Sospechosos a tutiplén\n\n⚠️Todas las valoraciones vertidas en este espacio son personales.

En cuanto terminas el libro que cerrará la serie, con varias sorpresas para todos, empiezan a pasar cosas a tu alrededor que… ¿simples casualidades? se asemejan mucho a los casos de tus libros. Lo peor viene cuando llega un asesinato, llevado a cabo con el modus operandi de un asesino en serie que Emilia relata en su último manuscrito… ese que solo ha leído su editora y sus más allegados.\n\n¿Quién podría querer hacerle daño?\n\n🔍El pasado fin de semana estuve de lleno con este libro. Me apetecía algo de misterio y suspenso, de esos que no puedes acabar un capítulo sin querer empezar el siguiente ya mismo. El último crimen de Emilia Ward ha sido una buena opción y me ha tenido pegada a las páginas hasta conseguir averiguar que estaba pasando. Estamos en Londres, un libro dentro de otro libro, una autora asustada rodeada de posibles sospechosos… ¡de su círculo cercano! Pistas falsas, personajes poco fiables, absolutamente todos parecen ocultar algo (aunque esto me mosqueó un poco de más). Tiene alguna parte que se torna un poco confusa pero que si sigues leyendo todo queda bien atado y cerrado.\n\nLa historia está relatada desde tres puntos de vista, y los tres igual de importantes, entremezclándose para darte toda la información que necesitas hasta que tu cabeza haga 💥\n\nA veces una solo necesita pasar páginas, que lleguen dos giritos que no te esperas y seguir :)\n\nJanuary 17, 2024\n\nI’m afraid this book just didn’t do it for me.\n\nKudos where kudos are due, this is a clever plot. However, I think Claire Douglas was trying to do too much. As a reader I think we were expected to suspend reality a bit more than I think was necessary.\n\nA plot like this probably needed 600+ pages to be a bit more tangible and enjoyable. This felt rushed and almost shopping list like at times.\n\nThere was one twist in the middle that was pretty incredible. That was one moment I thoroughly enjoyed. Other than that moment, there wasn’t much on offer. Plot aside, the characters were inconsistent at the very least. We were told a few times how that protagonist would do anything to protect her kids, but that didn’t extend as far as telling the truth just because she was embarrassed?? And then apparently, she was wise to the darker side of humanity because she was an author, but yet she couldn’t make any connections at any point, not even some rather obvious correlations.\n\nThank you NetGalley and Michael Joseph, Penguin Random House,for a review copy\n\nSeptember 30, 2023\n\nEmilia is a best selling author and on the surface she has the perfect life a loving husband and two children.\n\nHer life hasn’t always run smoothly her first husband was a cheat and married one of her best friends .\n\nEmilia writes crime fiction and she has come to a decision to kill off her main character Detective Miranda Moody .\n\nA draft of the final novel is sent to her agent and also to close family and friends, and then strange things start to happen .\n\nSomeone starts to use parts of Emilia’s novels to turn her world upside down.\n\nShe begins to trust no one and this impacts on her home life and her life begins to unravel.\n\nMay 11, 2023\n\nI was very excited when I saw this book was available for review. Thank you to Penguin Random House South Africa and NetGalley for this review copy. This book is a combination of two stories wrapped into one. It grabs your attention quickly and keeps you hooked right to the last page. This is a wonderfully gripping thriller that is full of twists and turns guaranteed to keep you entertained.\n\nThe author beautifully combines the different storylines and delivers a fantastic gripping tale. While experiencing events from Emilia’s perspective, you also enjoy extracts from her book and a police investigation into a serial killer. These different elements make this an interesting read that keeps you curious. When everything is tied up you are left in awe as it all falls into place. This book is clever and creative.\n\nEmilia Ward is excited about the book she just finished writing. She has already published nine books in the series and she is happy that the new book is the last in the series. But when strange things start happening, she realises that she might have a stalker, someone is re-creating scenes from her books. However, when something is taken from her unpublished manuscript, she immediately knows that whoever is behind the pranks is someone close to her. Who would want to terrorise her, and who could be capable of murder?\n\nI loved the different sides to this story and the extracts from Emilia’s book left me feeling as if I was reading two stories at the same time. This book was clever and it kept me curious right to the end.\n\nThe women in this book were a good mix and there is sure to be someone everyone would like. Emilia has everything she has ever wanted until her world starts falling apart and she is left suspicious of everyone around her. The turmoil was fantastic – there was never any doubt about Emilia’s emotions which the author managed to bring to life. I found myself racing from page to page doubting everyone in Emilia’s life.\n\nThis book is another addition to my loved list for 2023. The book is gripping, creative and hugely entertaining from start to end. I cannot find anything I did not enjoy about this story. Why have I not read more of this author’s work?\n\nIf you are looking for a creative, gripping thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat then you want to add this title to your TBR. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It’s a fantastic read!\n\nhttps://featzreviews.com/the-woman-wh...\n\nJuly 4, 2023\n\nIf you're looking for a gripping domestic thriller, you can always rely on Claire Douglas and The Woman Who Lied is another absolute cracker!\n\nWith a fast pace, this one had me hooked early on, and the tension remained high throughout. I absolutely loved the concept of somebody copying the events of Emilia's crime books, adding a lot of mystery and making you question everybody around her.\n\nDouglas always writes such strong characters, and it is because of how well they are developed that you follow their stories with so much apprehension. There are lots of great twists and clever curveballs in this one, some that I definitely wasn't expecting to creep up on me, with the different points of view bringing the pieces of the jigsaw slowly back together.\n\nI always Douglas' books so addictively entertaining, and can always recommend her books for a satisfying thriller. The Woman Who Lied is definitely another winner, so make sure you add this one to your wishlist!\n\nDecember 27, 2023\n\nI always look forward to the next Claire Douglas book and preorder as soon as possible even without knowing what the plot is because I know that whatever it is, it will be done with her usual well written and compelling style. But I have to say that this is her best book so far in my humble opinion! It had absolutely everything I wanted in a psychological thriller-unlikeable and untrustworthy characters ✔️ a serial killer on the loose ✔️ a writer as the main protagonist ✔️ and a whole bunch of twists that kept me turning the pages like a madwoman ✔️ Honestly, this book is completely addictive and a one sitting read so be prepared to be unable to put it down! I loved loved LOVED this!"
