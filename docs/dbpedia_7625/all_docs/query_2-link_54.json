        "text": "When applying for a new job, the first thing a prospective employer sees is probably your resume.\n\nBut many people aren't entirely truthful. In fact, 55% of Americans have lied on their resume at least once, according to a recent survey from StandOutCV, which surveyed 1,785 Americans 18 or older who were employed between Oct. 12 and Oct. 26.\n\nThe number of Google searches about how to fake a resume is up 48% this year, according to StandOutCV, and those specifically related to faking a job reference are up 52%.\n\nSo, what are people lying about? Here are the eight most common resume lies told and the percentage of people telling them, according to StandOutCV:\n\nPrevious work experience: 55.4%\n\nSkills: 43.1%\n\nCollege degree (or equivalent): 41%\n\nPersonal details, such as age, location or name: 39.5%\n\nHigh school details: 39.2%\n\nSalary information: 33.6%\n\nJob specific software and/or equipment skills: 33.5%\n\nEmployer references: 21%\n\nThe industry with the most employees lying on their resumes is manufacturing, with 72% of employees straying from the truth, StandOutCV found. The survey also found that 64% of health-care workers have lied and 63% of those in the arts have.\n\nMen also seem more likely to fabricate information: 59.9% of men surveyed admitted to lying on their resumes, compared with just 50.6% of women.\n\nThere are a number of reasons people choose to lie on their resumes.\n\nOne reason people change personal details is to avoid racial discrimination, according to a 2017 study from researchers at Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University) and the University of Toronto cited by StandOutCV. Names with Indian, Pakistani or Chinese origin were 28% less likely to get an interview than an anglo-sounding name, even if every qualification matched up, the study found.\n\nAnother extremely common lie is making up a college degree. Some candidates do this because their education does not match the job requirements, according to a survey by CrimCheck.\n\nSimilarly, members of younger generations may fabricate their work experience because they simply do not have enough to be considered for many jobs, CrimCheck found.\n\nBut it's never a good idea to lie on your resume. \"Faking a resume is considered fraud. Thus, it is a criminal activity in most states,\" Mark Sadaka, principal attorney and founder of Sadaka Law, told StandOutCV.\n\nSign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletter\n\nDon't miss: 60% of Americans see crypto investing as highly risky—but millennials are still its biggest fans"
