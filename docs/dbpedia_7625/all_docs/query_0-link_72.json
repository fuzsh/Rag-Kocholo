        "text": "Topline\n\nThe House Ethics Committee has opened an investigation into Rep. George Santos (R-NY) that will focus on allegations of sexual misconduct and campaign finance violations—a probe that comes as the embattled freshman congressman is embroiled in a ballooning scandal surrounding these alleged lies and more (UPDATE: Santos has been indicted on fraud and money laundering charges).\n\nKey Facts\n\nCrucial Quote\n\nSantos conceded to CNN’s Piers Morgan on February 20 that he is a “terrible liar,” but blamed his extensive fabrications on the need for acceptance from the Republican party: “It wasn’t about tricking people,” he said.\n\nContra\n\nSantos, who has remained defiant amid calls for his resignation, said on Twitter he is “fully cooperating” with the House Ethics Committee’s investigation.\n\nChief Critic\n\n“He’s a complete and total fraud,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) said recently. \"[He]\n\nlied to the voters of the 3rd Congressional District in New York, deceived and connived his way into Congress. And it’s now the responsibility of House Republicans to do something about it.”\n\nKey Background\n\nSantos faces calls for him to resign from his Republican colleagues, including at least six New York GOP representatives and the Nassau County Republican Party. Three of those members—Reps. Anthony D’Esposito, Nick LaLota Marc Molinaro—also said they support a resolution sponsored by New York Democratic Reps. Dan Goldman and Ritchie Torres that would expel Santos from Congress. He has said he will not resign unless the “142,000” voters who elected him call on him to do so (more than 145,000 people voted for Santos in the midterm election). In addition to calls for his resignation, Santos faces a slew of ethics and criminal probes into his conduct. Democrats and activist groups have filed complaints against him with the Federal Election Commission, the Office of Congressional Ethics, and the Justice Department, New York Attorney General and Nassau County prosecutor’s offices have also said they are reviewing the allegations. The House Ethics Committee, which is the only bipartisan committee in the House made up of five Democrats and five Republicans, voted unanimously on February 28 to open an investigation into Santos.\n\nTangent\n\nA would-be congressional staffer to Santos filed a sexual harassment complaint with the House Ethics Committee and Capitol Police accusing Santos of touching his groin without permission in January, according to a letter the alleged victim, Derek Myers, posted to Twitter. Santos has not publicly commented on the allegations, but told Semafor he rescinded Myers’ offer upon learning the would-be staffer faces wiretapping charges in Ohio after a newspaper he ran published an audio recording of court testimony it obtained from a source.\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\nIf Santos resigned or was ejected from Congress (a process that requires a vote of two-thirds of its members), New York Gov. Kathy Hochul would call a special election to replace him. Santos’ removal could be a blow to Republicans, who regained control of the House with a slim four-seat majority after flipping multiple districts previously held by Democrats, including New York’s third congressional district Santos now represents. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), however, has said Santos will be removed from Congress if the Ethics process finds him guilty of wrongdoing.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nWill Santos Be Expelled From Congress?
