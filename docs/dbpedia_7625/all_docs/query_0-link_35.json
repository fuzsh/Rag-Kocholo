        "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Rep.-elect George Santos, R-N.Y., admitted Monday that he lied about his job experience and college education during his successful campaign for a seat in the U.S. House.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Post, Santos said: “My sins here are embellishing my resume. I’m sorry.”\n\nHe also told the newspaper: “I campaigned talking about the people’s concerns, not my resume” and added, “I intend to deliver on the promises I made during the campaign.”\n\nREAD MORE: Congress approves new election certification rules in response to Jan. 6\n\nThe New York Times raised questions last week about the life story that Santos, 34, had presented during his campaign.\n\nThe Queens resident had said he had obtained a degree from Baruch College in New York, but the school said that couldn’t be confirmed.\n\nOn Monday, Santos acknowledged: “I didn’t graduate from any institution of higher learning. I’m embarrassed and sorry for having embellished my resume.”\n\nHe added: “I own up to that. … We do stupid things in life.”\n\nSantos had also said he had worked for Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, but neither company could find any records verifying that.\n\nSantos told the Post he had “never worked directly” for either financial firm, saying he had used a “poor choice of words.”\n\nHe told the Post that Link Bridge, an investment company where he was a vice president, did business with both.\n\nAnother news outlet, the Jewish American site The Forward, had questioned a claim on Santos’ campaign website that his grandparents “fled Jewish persecution in Ukraine, settled in Belgium, and again fled persecution during WWII.”\n\n“I never claimed to be Jewish,” Santos told the Post. “I am Catholic. Because I learned my maternal family had a Jewish background I said I was ‘Jew-ish.'”\n\nSantos first ran for Congress in 2020 and lost. He ran again in 2022 and won in the district that includes some Long Island suburbs and a small part of Queens."
