        "text": "Joe Biden has repeatedly lied about his family’s business dealings. Joe Biden claims he never spoke to his family about their business dealings; his family never received $1 million in payments through a third party; his son never made money in China; his son’s dealings were ethical; and his son did nothing wrong. Below are 16 times that Joe Biden lied about his family’s dealings over the years.\n\nJoe Biden lied about not talking to his son about his business dealings.\n\nAugust 28, 2019\n\nThen-Presidential Candidate Joe Biden: “First of all, I have never discussed with my son, or my brother, or anyone else, anything having to do with their businesses, period. What I will do is the same thing we did in our administration. There will be an absolute wall between the personal and private, and the government. There wasn’t any hint of scandal at all when we were there. And I will impose the same kind of strict, strict rules. That is why I have never talked with my son or my brother, or anyone else in the distant family about their business interests, period.”\n\nSeptember 21, 2019\n\nReporter: “Have you ever spoken to your son about his overseas business dealings?”\n\nJoe Biden: “I’ve never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.”\n\nOctober 4, 2019\n\nReporter: “Excuse me. There was a photo of you golfing with your son Hunter and his business partner Devon Archer. Do you stand by your statement that you did not discuss any of your son’s overseas business dealings?”\n\nJoe Biden: “Yes, I stand by that statement.”\n\nOctober 9, 2019\n\nJoe Biden: “I don’t discuss business with my son. I didn’t know that was the case when in fact I found out after the fact. And I don’t discuss things with my son or my family because I don’t want to have any knowledge of any, I don’t want to be accused of well you talk with your son, you talk with your whomever.”\n\nOctober 15, 2019\n\nJoe Biden: “I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having do with Ukraine. No one has indicated I have. We’ve always kept everything separate.”\n\nOctober 16, 2019\n\nJoe Biden: “I never discussed with my son anything having to do with what was going on in Ukraine. That’s a fact.”\n\nOctober 27, 2019\n\nJoe Biden: “I’ve never discussed my business or their business, my sons and daughters. And I’ve never discussed them because they know where I have to do my job and that’s it.”\n\nOctober 29, 2019\n\nJoe Biden: “I’ve never discussed my son’s business with him.”\n\nApril 5, 2022\n\nReporter: “The President has said that he never spoke to his son about his overseas business dealings. Is that still the case?”\n\nJen Psaki: “Yes.”\n\nJune 26, 2023\n\nReporter: “Did you lie about never speaking to Hunter about his business dealings?”\n\nPresident Biden: “No.”\n\nAugust 9, 2023\n\nReporter: “There’s this testimony now where one of your son’s former business associates is claiming that you were on speakerphone a lot with them talking business. Is that what?”\n\nPresident Biden: “I never talked business with anybody, and I knew you’d have a lousy question.”\n\nFACT: Evidence reveals then-Vice President Biden spoke, dined, and had coffee with Hunter Biden’s foreign business associates. The FBI’s recorded interview with Rob Walker, a Biden family associate, also reveals Joe Biden attended a meeting about CEFC, a Chinese entity. Additionally, Hunter Biden alleged his father was in the room when he demanded payment from a CEFC associate.\n\nThen-Vice President Biden dined with corrupt oligarchs who funneled millions to Hunter Biden.\n\nThen-Vice President Biden spoke on speakerphone with Hunter Biden’s business associates over 20 times.\n\nDemocrats would have Americans believe that these phone calls then-Vice President Biden took with business associates were simply to discuss the weather.\n\nJoe Biden attended a CEFC meeting.\n\nHunter Biden claimed Joe Biden was in the room when he demanded payment from a CEFC associate.\n\nJoe Biden lied about his family receiving over $1 million in payments from China through an associate.\n\nMarch 20, 2023\n\nReporter: “Any reaction to House GOP’s memo about your family’s dealings […] revealing that Hunter Biden’s business associates sent over $1 million to three of your family members?”\n\nPresident Biden: “That’s not true.”\n\nFACT: The House Oversight Committee detailed in its first bank records memorandum, released on March 16, 2023, that three Biden family members – Hunter Biden, James Biden, Hallie Biden, and an unknown Biden – and their companies received over $1.3 million in payments from a Chinese company through a third party.\n\nJoe Biden lied about Hunter Biden making money from China.\n\nOctober 22, 2020\n\nJoe Biden: “My son has not made money, in terms of thing about, what are you talking about? China. The only guy who made money in China is [President Trump].”\n\nFACT: The House Oversight Committee detailed in its second bank records memorandum how Hunter Biden and other members of the Biden family received millions from Chinese nationals and companies with significant ties to Chinese intelligence and the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nJoe Biden lied about his son’s business dealings being ethical.\n\nOctober 22, 2020\n\nModerator: “There have been questions about the work your son has done in China and for a Ukrainian energy company when you were vice president. In retrospect, was anything about those relationships inappropriate or unethical?”\n\nJoe Biden: “Nothing was unethical.”\n\nFACT: During a transcribed interview with Devon Archer – Hunter Biden’s former business partner – Archer described how Joe Biden was “the brand” and was used to send “signals” of power, access, and influence to enrich the Biden family.\n\nDevon Archer confirmed Joe Biden was “the brand” and he brought the most value to “the brand.”\n\nDevon Archer admitted the value of adding Hunter Biden to the Burisma board was it “sent the right signals” and “a lot of it’s about opening doors, you know, globally in D.C.”\n\nArcher stated Burisma would have gone out of business if not for “the brand.”\n\nBurisma executives requested Hunter Biden to get “help from D.C.” to address “government pressure” and were aware Hunter had a “very powerful name.”\n\nDuring a media interview, Devon Archer responded to claims that there was no corruption, and that Joe Biden had no role whatsoever in Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings or knowledge of it. “That’s categorically false.”\n\nJoe Biden lied about his son doing nothing wrong.\n\nOctober 27, 2019\n\nJoe Biden: “And it turns out, [Hunter] didn’t do a single thing wrong as everybody has investigated.”\n\nDecember 8, 2019\n\nReporter: “So you think that everything that happened was kosher?”\n\nJoe Biden: “You know that there’s not one single bit of evidence. Not one little, tiny bit to suggest that anything done was wrong.”"
