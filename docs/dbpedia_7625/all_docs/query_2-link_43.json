        "text": "CALLING ON JOE BIDEN TO RELEASE THE FULL TRANSCRIPT OF HIS PHONE CALL WITH AFGHAN PRESIDENT\n\nAmericans across the country are horrified by the tragedy in Afghanistan. Instead of leading the country through this crisis, Joe Biden lied to the American people, lied to our Afghan allies, and cared more about optics than saving lives. On August 31, a partial transcript of Biden’s phone call with Afghan President Ghani was leaked to the press. In the phone call, Biden pressured the Afghan President to “project a different picture” “whether it is true or not” to “change perception.” Furthermore, Biden promised President Ghani that he would provide air support to the Afghan military. Biden broke his promise, and the Afghan military suffered defeat in only a matter of days.\n\nThis damning phone call shows that Joe Biden never had a plan; all he had was a coverup. He lied, Americans died, and Congress must hold him accountable. I joined 26 of my House colleagues in a letter demanding Joe Biden immediately release the complete and uncensored transcript of his phone call with President Ghani.\n\nCONGRESS NEEDS TO GET BACK IN SESSION TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT\n\nThe Biden administration’s withdrawal from Afghanistan has been a total failure. The Taliban is in possession of deadly military equipment, there are still hundreds of Americans stranded in Afghanistan, and 13 American service members died in a terrorist attack.\n\nMeanwhile, Nancy Pelosi continues to allow Congress to be in recess. Congress is providing no oversight, no one has been fired, there have been no investigations, and barely any members of Congress have been to the Capitol in over a month. I am standing with the House Freedom Caucus demanding that Congress come back into session to impeach Secretary Blinken and demand the resignation of Joe Biden, General Milley, and Secretary Austin.\n\nRemembering OUR FALLEN HEROES\n\nI am proud to join 231 of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in co-sponsoring a resolution to award the 13 service members who gave their lives in Afghanistan the Congressional Gold Medal so that our nation may never forget nor fail to honor their sacrifice.\n\nImage"
