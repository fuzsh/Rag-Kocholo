        "text": "News on July 12 that the Justice Department was re-examining the 1955 racially charged murder case of black teenager Emmett Till generated interest around the globe, both in the news and on social media. As a result, faulty assumptions have arisen that need correcting. Till’s death has traditionally been tied to a wolf-whistle he emitted at 21-year-old Carolyn Bryant outside the Bryant Grocery and Meat Market in Money, Mississippi. Her husband Roy and his half-brother J. W. Milam went on trial for murder just three weeks later.\n\nThe motive behind the re-examination stems from the 2017 book, \"The Blood of Emmett Till,\" containing a few quotes from an interview with Carolyn Bryant, allegedly given in July 2008. The author, Timothy B. Tyson, quoted an admission by Bryant regarding a portion of her courtroom testimony that Till grabbed her by the waist and propositioned her: “You tell these stories for so long that they seem true, but that part is not true.” Although Tyson made an audio recording of his two interviews with Bryant, we have learned recently that her “admission” never made it on tape. Jerry Mitchell’s recent article in the Clarion Ledger shows a photo of those notes, which amounts to three brief points scratched out in five lines on a yellow notepad, important enough that Tyson should have instinctually followed up on once he got his recorder going but which, for whatever reason, he did not do.\n\nLet’s assume for a moment that Tyson’s notes are authentic and are not taken out of context. In that case, it is more than refreshing to read Bryant’s admission after all these years. But what has happened is that a new crop of myths has sprung up as a result. For example, Duvalier Malone, a guest columnist for the Clarion Ledger, wrote in May that Carolyn Bryant “made headlines when she finally admitted that she lied. She made it all up, conjuring a horrid (and false) story that led to Till's murder. She lied, and Till was killed.” Danielle Young, on her \"Judge of Characters\" show on Root TV, similarly uttered four words that seemed to say it all: “She lied, he died.” Malone and Young here become part of the problem. Yes, Bryant lied, but not about everything. And no, her lie did not lead to Till’s death.\n\nTo say that Bryant “made it all up” implies that she lied about the wolf-whistle, also. It is important to point out, however, that Till’s cousins — Maurice Wright, Simeon Wright, and Wheeler Parker — who witnessed the incident, were the ones who told the press about the whistle just days after it occurred. Bryant herself said nothing about the whistle publicly until the murder trial. Thus all news reports about the whistle up to the trial came directly from Till’s cousins.\n\nBut it was at the trial where Bryant added some sensational details that seemed to come out of nowhere, and this is where she lied. We know this even without her alleged admission. Careful not to refer to Till by name, she said a “Negro man” came into the store, purchased some items, and when Bryant held out her hand for payment, the man grabbed it with a strong grip and said, “How about a date, baby?” Bryant said she jerked herself loose and started toward the back of the store. The customer followed her, caught her by the register, put his hands on her waist and said, “What’s the matter baby? Can’t you take it?” After she freed herself, the man assured her that “you needn’t be afraid of me.” Using “an unprintable word,” he said he’d been “with white women before.”\n\nBryant’s lie was already known prior to the publicity about the 2008 admission. Just five days after the murder, with her husband and brother-in-law sitting in jail, she told defense attorney Sidney Carlton a different story than the one she would tell in court three weeks later. Carlton’s hand-written notes make no mention of the more salacious parts. “Wednesday Aug. 24 about 7:30 or 8 P.M. (dark) boy came to candy counter & I waited on him & when I went to take money he grabbed my hand & said ‘how about a date’ and I walked away from him and he said ‘what’s the matter Baby can’t you take it?’ He went out door and said ‘goodbye’ and I went out to car & got pistol and when I came back he whistled at me—this whistle while I was going after pistol—didn’t do anything further after he saw pistol.’” In this earliest version, Till takes Bryant’s hand and asks her for a date, but there is no mention of his grabbing her by the waist and propositioning her. Till and Bryant were alone in the store for a minute or two, and what happened inside is known only to Bryant. But had Till grabbed her by the waist and propositioned her, as she later claimed in court, surely Bryant would have mentioned that fact to her attorneys as well as the police.\n\nThe jury did not hear Carolyn Bryant’s courtroom testimony directly from her, however, because the judge dismissed them from the room as Bryant took the stand. But Carlton, perhaps anticipating this, found a way around that. In some rarely examined newspaper coverage, he told the press a day before the trial began that Till “mauled and attempted a physical attack while making indecent proposals” while Till and Bryant were inside the store alone.\n\nTwo days later he told reporters during a recess at the trial that Till “propositioned” Bryant, tried to “assault her,” and that “it got so bad that one of the other boys had to go in and get him out.” Before Till left the store, however, he “mauled her and he tussled her and he made indecent proposals to her, and if that boy had any sense he’d have made the next train to Chicago.” Any potential juror could easily have heard these accounts directly from Carlton before being chosen and later sequestered in the jury room during Bryant’s testimony. But none of Carlton’s sordid details was true, which were even more sensational than those Bryant told from the witness stand. If the jurors heard anything, it came from Carlton.\n\nAccording to Till’s uncle, Mose Wright, when Roy Bryant and J. W. Milam came for Till, they mentioned only Till’s “talk” at the store, not an attempted rape, not even the whistle. Sheriff George Smith told the press that the men he arrested had accused Till only of making “ugly remarks” at Carolyn. Had the enraged men been looking for a would-be rapist, they would have made that known.\n\nBecause Bryant’s story developed after Till’s death, it is clear the lies she told on the stand did not lead to murder but came later for the benefit of the jury in order to guarantee an acquittal. Also, Carolyn Bryant is not the one who told her husband about the store incident in the first place. He was out of town at the time but heard it three days after the fact from one of the young teens who was present at the store the night of the incident. Not only did Carolyn confirm that to her defense attorney in 1955 and to the FBI in 2004, her story is backed up by a 1955 investigation by civil rights leader Dr. T.R.M. Howard, who learned this independently, as did journalist William Bradford Huie. Carolyn only confirmed the incident to Roy after he confronted her.\n\nTyson told another detail about Bryant’s false story in a paper leaked online in 2014, saying it was concocted for her to use by defense attorneys and Bryant family members. For whatever reason, Tyson did not include this detail in his book. It is not on the notepad and presumably, is not on tape either. This is crucial information Tyson needs to explain in order to preserve his own credibility.\n\nThe Till case is tragic on so many levels. Justice has remained elusive and probably always will. For nothing more than an innocent wolf whistle and perhaps a little “talk” inside the store, Emmett Till paid the ultimate price. The facts of the case are tragic enough that embellishments do nothing to further that. In fact, we run the risk of diminishing it. That would be an additional tragedy.\n\nMore: Questions about Emmett Till? Here are the answers.\n\nMore: Emmett Till mystery: Who is the white girl in his photo?
