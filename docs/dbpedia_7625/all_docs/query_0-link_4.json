        "text": "Sherri Papini dominated national headlines in 2016 after the California woman claimed to have been kidnapped, held captive and tortured for 22 days. Years later, it was unraveled as nothing more than a hoax.\n\nKeith Papini, her husband at the time, revealed in a new interview that she was known to exaggerate stories and lie, but he said he was often blinded by love or manipulated by her.\n\nNow he's warning the public not to heed her words.\n\n“Even if she were to come out someday and do a book or magazine, I can assure you that whatever is in there is going to be what she thinks she should say to get whatever goal she’s after, but it will not be the truth,” Keith told People magazine.\n\nSherri Papini's story has returned to the spotlight with the Hulu series \"Perfect Wife: The Mysterious Disappearance of Sherri Papini,\" released this month.\n\nShe disappeared on Nov. 2, 2016, on a jog near her Redding, California, home. She claimed she was abducted by two Hispanic women, beaten, branded and held captive for 22 days. She resurfaced on the side of highway, found wearing restraints and covered in bruises.\n\nOver five years later, in March 2022, she was arrested on federal charges as authorities revealed she had made up the whole story and had been staying with an ex-boyfriend in the time she was missing, all while defrauding the state out of more than $30,000 in victim assistance money in the following years.\n\nKeith Papini, who filed for divorce, is now a single dad raising their two children, Violet, 9, and Tyler, 11.\n\n“She definitely had a history of exaggerating. And I would say at this point, lying,” Keith told People.\n\n“There’s a lot of things I didn’t question,” he said. “I grew up with a lovely mother and father. I was never around a dishonest person to that extent growing up. And when we first got together and she told me things, I believed her. I wouldn’t know why I wouldn’t.”\n\n“She told me she went to college down in Orange County, she told me she was in ballet. She told me she used to sell cars at a dealership and all these different things, and I wasn’t going to go calling around to verify that those were real. But there were definitely some things where I’m like, ‘Hey, the timeline doesn’t match up. Like, you said you did this or you lived at this spot, but this doesn’t make sense to me because the timeline’s not right,’” he said.\n\nKeith said that \"she always had a way of just skirting around it\" and that he \"just kind of went along with it.\"\n\nHe said he recalled moments when Sherri would lie in front of him, and when he’d call her out, she’d manipulate him into apologizing.\n\n“It was almost like I was making excuses for her,\" and \"I think she was able to exploit that from me,\" Keith said.\n\n“If something wasn’t adding up, she would be quick to move it to where, ‘Well, it’s because of this and my childhood, and you didn’t experience that you had loving parents.’ And she would almost twist it in a way. Now looking back, that I can see. But in the moment, it’s more like, ‘Oh, I’m so sorry. Let me give you a hug,’ and you kind of move on.”\n\nKeith said he \"accepted her flaws\" because he was \"head over heels for her.\"\n\n“At the end of the day, you feel like if you can trust anyone, it’s your partner in life. But I was wrong,” he said.\n\nSherri Papini pleaded guilty in April 2022 and was sentenced to 18 months in prison. She was released from federal prison to community confinement last August and since been released from that."
