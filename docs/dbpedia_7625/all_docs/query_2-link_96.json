        "text": "Morgan Wallen dropped the studio recording of his new song ‘Lies Lies Lies‘, recorded at Abbey Roadâs Studio Two during a 2023 session just after his sold-out show at the O2 Arena.\n\nWallen debuted a live version of the song on March 3 as part of his Abbey Road Sessions series. The song was written by Jessie Jo Dillon, Josh Miller, Daniel Ross, and Chris Tompkins, with production from Joey Moi.\n\nâLies Lies Liesâ has become a highlight on Wallen’s One Night At A Time tour, which supports the artist’s third studio album One Thing At A Time, the 5x platinum album that has spent over a full year atop Billboardâs Country Albums chart.\n\nWallen’s recent hit track, âI Had Some Helpâ with Post Malone, spent eight weeks atop of the Billboard Hot 100, making the song the longest-standing No. 1 hit this year. âI Had Some Helpâ was also the fastest-climbing No. 1 hit on Billboardâs Country Airplay charts since Garth Brooksâ 2007 classic âMore Than A Memory.â\n\nListen to Morgan Wallenâs âLies Lies Liesâ – here.\n\nEditorial credit: Debby Wong / Shutterstock.com"
