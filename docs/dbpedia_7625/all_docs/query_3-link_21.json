Don’t run, argue, resist, or obstruct the officer, even if you believe your rights are being violated. Keep your hands where police can see them.\n\nDon’t lie about your status or provide false documents.\n\nYour rights\n\nYou have the right to remain silent and do not have to discuss your immigration or citizenship status with police, immigration agents, or other officials. Anything you tell an officer can later be used against you in immigration court.\n\nIf you are not a U.S. citizen and an immigration agent requests your immigration papers, you must show them if you have them with you.\n\nIf an immigration agent asks if they can search you, you have the right to say no. Agents do not have the right to search you or your belongings without your consent or probable cause.\n\nIf you’re over 18, carry your papers with you at all times. If you don’t have them, tell the officer that you want to remain silent, or that you want to consult a lawyer before answering any questions.\n\nWhat to do in such an encounter\n\nIn some states, you must provide your name to law enforcement if you are stopped and told to identify yourself. But even if you give your name, you don’t have to answer other questions.\n\nIf you are driving and are pulled over, the officer can require you to show your license, vehicle registration and proof of insurance, but you don’t have to answer questions about your immigration status.\n\nCustoms officers can ask about your immigration status when entering or leaving the country. If you are a lawful permanent resident (LPR) who has maintained your status, you only have to answer questions establishing your identity and permanent residency. Refusal to answer other questions will likely cause delay, but officials may not deny you entry into the United States for failure to answer other questions. If you are a non-citizen visa holder, you may be denied entry into the U.S. if you refuse to answer officers’ questions.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nIf you need more information, contact your local ACLU affiliate.\n\nNational Immigration Law Center: Know Your Rights\n\nA Toolkit for Organizations Responding to Mass Worksite Immigration Raids\n\nImmigrant Legal Resource Center\n\nAmerican Immigration Lawyers Association\n\nACLU VIDEO: What to do if stopped by police or ICE\n\nIn other languages\n\n(Arabic) العَرَبِيَّة‎\n\n中文(简) (Chinese)\n\nCreole\n\nفارسی (Farsi)\n\nFrançais (French)\n\nBahasa Indonesia (Indonesian)\n\n한국어 (Korean)\n\nPortuguês (Portuguese)\n\nSoomaali (Somali)\n\nEspañol (Spanish)\n\nTagalog\n\n(Urdu) اُردُو‎\n\nTiếng Việt (Vietnamese)\n\nहिंदी (Hindi)\n\n(Traditional Chinese) 繁體中文\n\n(Simplified Chinese) 简体中文\n\nShare this scenario:\n\nI’ve been stopped by police or ICE\n\nHow to reduce risk to yourself\n\nStay calm and do not resist or obstruct the agents or officers.\n\nDo not lie or give false documents.\n\nPrepare yourself and your family in case you are arrested. Memorize the phone numbers of your family and your lawyer. Make emergency plans if you have children or take medication.\n\nYour rights\n\nYou have the right to remain silent. If you wish to exercise that right, say so out loud. (In some states, you may be required to provide your name if asked to identify yourself.)\n\nYou do not have to consent to a search of yourself or your belongings, but police may pat down your clothing if they suspect a weapon.\n\nIf you are arrested by police, you have the right to a government-appointed lawyer.\n\nIf you are detained by ICE, you have the right to consult with a lawyer, but the government is not required to provide one for you. You can ask for a list of free or low-cost alternatives.\n\nYou do not have to answer questions about where you were born, whether you are a U.S. citizen, or how you entered the country. (Separate rules apply at international borders and airports, and for individuals on certain nonimmigrant visas, including tourists and business travelers.)\n\nWhat to do if you are arrested or detained\n\nSay you wish to remain silent and ask for a lawyer immediately. Don't give any explanations or excuses. Don't say anything, sign anything, or make any decisions without a lawyer.\n\nIf you have been arrested by police, you have the right to make a local phone call. The police cannot listen if you call a lawyer.\n\nIf you have been detained by ICE, you have the right to contact your consulate or have an officer inform the consulate of your detention.\n\nRemember your immigration number (\"A\" number) and give it to your family. It will help family members locate you.\n\nKeep a copy of your immigration documents with someone you trust.\n\nIf you are a non-citizen: Ask your lawyer about the effect of a criminal conviction or plea on your immigration status. Don't discuss your immigration status with anyone but your lawyer. While you are in jail, an immigration agent may visit you. Do not answer questions or sign anything before talking to a lawyer. Read all papers fully. If you do not understand or cannot read the papers, tell the officer you need an interpreter.\n\nIf you believe your rights were violated\n\nWrite down everything you remember, including officers’ badges and patrol car numbers, which agency the officers were from, and any other details. Get contact information for witnesses.\n\nIf you’re injured, seek medical attention immediately and take photographs of your injuries.\n\nFile a written complaint with the agency’s internal affairs division or civilian complaint board.

Opening the door does not give them permission to come inside, but it is safer to speak to ICE through the door.\n\nYour rights\n\nYou have the right to remain silent, even if officer has a warrant.\n\nYou do not have to let police or immigration agents into your home unless they have certain kinds of warrants.\n\nIf police have an arrest warrant, they are legally allowed to enter the home of the person on the warrant if they believe that person is inside. But a warrant of removal/deportation (Form I-205) does not allow officers to enter a home without consent.\n\nWhat to do when the police or ICE arrive\n\nAsk if they are immigration agents and what they are there for.\n\nAsk the agent or officer to show you a badge or identification through the window or peephole.\n\nAsk if they have a warrant signed by a judge. If they say they do, ask them to slide it under the door or hold it up to a window so you can inspect it.\n\nDon’t lie or produce any false documents. Don’t sign anything without speaking with a lawyer first.\n\nDo not open your door unless ICE shows you a judicial search or arrest warrant naming a person in your residence and/or areas to be searched at your address. If they don’t produce a warrant, keep the door closed. State: “I do not consent to your entry.”\n\nIf agents force their way in, do not resist. If you wish to exercise your rights, state: “I do not consent to your entry or to your search of these premises. I am exercising my right to remain silent. I wish to speak with a lawyer as soon as possible.”\n\nIf you are on probation with a search condition, law enforcement is allowed to enter your home.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nIf you need more information, contact your local ACLU affiliate.\n\nNational Immigration Law Center: Know Your Rights\n\nA Toolkit for Organizations Responding to Mass Worksite Immigration Raids\n\nImmigrant Legal Resource Center\n\nAmerican Immigration Lawyers Association\n\nShare this scenario:\n\nI need a lawyer\n\nYour rights\n\nIf you are arrested by the police, you have the right to a government-appointed lawyer, and should ask for one immediately.\n\nIf arrested, you have the right to a private phone call within a reasonable time of your arrest, and police may not listen to the call if it is made to a lawyer.\n\nIf you are detained by ICE or Border Patrol, you have the right to hire a lawyer, but the government does not have to provide one for you. Ask for a list of free or low-cost alternatives.\n\nIf you are detained, you have the right to call a lawyer or your family, and you have the right to be visited by a lawyer in detention. You have the right to have your attorney with you at any hearing before an immigration judge.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nIf you need more information, contact your local ACLU affiliate.\n\nHere is a list of contact information for legal organizations that assist immigrants.\n\nShare this scenario:\n\nI’ve been detained near the border by Border Patrol\n\nHow to reduce risk to yourself\n\nStay calm when interacting with immigration officials. Do not lie or provide false documents.\n\nNever flee from an immigration checkpoint.\n\nYour rights\n\nYou have the right to remain silent. You can also tell the agent that you’ll only answer questions in the presence of an attorney, no matter your citizenship or immigration status.\n\nYou do not have to answer questions about your immigration status. A limited exception exists for people who have permission to be in the U.S. for a specific reason and for a limited amount of time (a “nonimmigrant” on a visa, for example). These individuals are required to provide information about their immigration status if asked.\n\nGenerally, a Border Patrol agent cannot detain you unless they have “reasonable suspicion” that you are committing or committed a violation of immigration law or federal law.\n\nAn immigration officer cannot arrest you without “probable cause.” That means the agent must have facts about you that make it probable that you are committing, or committed, a violation of immigration law or federal law.\n\nAt immigration checkpoints, agents do not need any suspicion to stop you and ask you questions, but their questions should be brief and related to verifying immigration status. They can also visually inspect your vehicle.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nPeople who have entered the U.S. without inspection by an immigration official may be subject to expedited removal from the U.S. based on certain criteria. If you are told that you are subject to expedited removal, ask for the stated reason. Also, if you fear persecution if returned to your country of origin, you should immediately inform the agents of your fear.\n\nAt border crossings, federal authorities do not need a warrant or even suspicion of wrongdoing to justify conducting what courts have called a \"routine search,\" such as searching luggage or a vehicle.\n\nIf an agent asks you for documents, what you need to provide differs depending on your immigration status. U.S. citizens do not have to carry proof of citizenship if they are in the U.S. If you have valid immigration documents and are over the age of 18, the law requires that you to carry those documents with you. If you are asked by an immigration agent to produce them, show them to the agent. If you are an immigrant without documents, you can decline the officer’s request, although an agent may then ask you more questions.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nIf you need more information, contact your local ACLU affiliate.\n\nNational Immigration Law Center: Know Your Rights\n\nA Toolkit for Organizations Responding to Mass Worksite Immigration Raids\n\nImmigrant Legal Resource Center\n\nAmerican Immigration Lawyers Association\n\nShare this scenario:\n\nI was stopped by police, ICE, or Border Patrol while in transit\n\nHow to reduce risk to yourself\n\nStay calm. Don’t run, argue, or obstruct the officer or agent. Keep your hands raised where they can see them.\n\nIf you are in a car, pull over in a safe place as quickly as possible. Turn off the engine, turn on the internal light, open the window part way and place your hands on the wheel. Upon request, show police your driver's license, registration, and proof of insurance.\n\nIf you are not a U.S. citizen and an immigration agent requests your papers, you must show them if you have them with you. If you are over 18, carry your immigration documents with you at all times. If you do not have immigration papers, say you want to remain silent.\n\nYour rights\n\nIn a car:\n\nDrivers and passengers have the right to remain silent. If you are a passenger, you can ask if you are free to leave. If the officer says yes, calmly leave.\n\nIf an officer or immigration agent asks to look inside your car, you can refuse to consent to the search. But if police generally believe that your car contains evidence of a crime, your car can be searched without your consent.\n\nIn addition to police, Border Patrol conduct “roving patrols” around the interior of the U.S., pulling over motorists. Border Patrol must have reasonable suspicion that the driver or passengers in the car committed an immigration violation or a federal crime.\n\nAny arrest or prolonged stop by Border Patrol requires probable cause. You may ask the agents about the basis for probable cause, and they should tell you. In this situation, both the driver and any passengers have the right to remain silent and not answer questions about their immigration status.\n\nOn an airplane:\n\nA pilot may refuse to fly a passenger if he or she reasonably believes that the passenger is a threat to flight safety. A pilot may not, however, question you or refuse to allow you on a flight because of bias based on your religion, race, national origin, gender, ethnicity, or political beliefs.\n\nIf you believe you are mistakenly on a “no-fly” list, you should review our guidance on No-Fly lists here.\n\nOn buses and trains:\n\nBorder Patrol agents may board buses and trains in the 100-mile border region either at the station or while the bus is on its journey. More than one officer usually boards the bus, and they will ask passengers questions about their immigration status, ask passengers to show them immigration documents, or both.\n\nThese questions should be brief and related to verifying one’s lawful presence in the U.S. You are not required to answer and can simply say you do not wish to do so. As always, you have the right to remain silent.\n\nIf you believe your rights were violated\n\nWrite down everything you remember, including officers’ badges and patrol car numbers, which agency the officers were from, and any other details. Get contact information from witnesses.\n\nIf you’re injured, seek medical attention immediately and take photographs of your injuries.\n\nFile a written complaint with the agency’s internal affairs division or civilian complaint board. In most cases, you can file a complaint anonymously.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nIf you need more information, contact your local ACLU affiliate.\n\nNational Immigration Law Center: Know Your Rights\n\nA Toolkit for Organizations Responding to Mass Worksite Immigration Raids\n\nImmigrant Legal Resource Center\n\nAmerican Immigration Lawyers Association\n\nShare this scenario:\n\nI am detained while my immigration case is underway\n\nYour rights\n\nMost people who are detained while their case is underway are eligible to be released on bond or with other reporting conditions.\n\nYou have the right to call a lawyer or your family if you are detained, and you have the right to be visited by a lawyer in detention.\n\nYou have the right to have your attorney with you at any hearing before an immigration judge.\n\nWhat to do if you are detained\n\nIf you are denied release after being arrested for an immigration violation, ask for a bond hearing before an immigration judge. In many cases, an immigration judge can order that you be released or that your bond be lowered.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nIf you need more information, contact your local ACLU affiliate.\n\nNational Immigration Law Center: Know Your Rights\n\nA Toolkit for Organizations Responding to Mass Worksite Immigration Raids\n\nImmigrant Legal Resource Center\n\nAmerican Immigration Lawyers Association\n\nShare this scenario:"
