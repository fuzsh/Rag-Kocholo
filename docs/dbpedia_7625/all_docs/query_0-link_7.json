        "text": "BUFFALO, N.Y. - U.S. Attorney Trini E. Ross announced today that Deshema Clark, 46, of Buffalo, NY, who was convicted of making a materially false statement, was sentenced to serve 30 days in prison and two years’ supervised release by Chief U.S. District Judge Elizabeth A. Wolford.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Maeve E. Huggins and Joseph M. Tripi, who handled the case, stated that on October 9, 2019, during the course of a federal criminal investigation, the FBI executed a search warrant at Clark’s Buffalo residence. During the search, Clark spoke with an FBI Special Agent, then went to Buffalo Police Department Headquarters to provide a voluntary statement to law enforcement. Clark knowingly made several false statements regarding the whereabouts of DeAndre Wilson during the evening of September 15, 2019, through the morning of September 16, 2019. Clark falsely stated that she and DeAndre Wilson returned to her residence after attending a concert the evening of September 15, 2019, ate dinner and went to sleep. Clark further falsely stated that a few hours later, she woke up and DeAndre Wilson was still asleep. Clark told investigators that she did not remember DeAndre Wilson leaving her residence on the evening of September 15, 2019, through the morning of September 16, 2019. However, Clark knew that DeAndre Wilson did not remain at her residence, eat dinner, and go to bed.\n\nDeAndre Wilson was convicted by a federal jury and sentenced to serve three consecutive life sentences plus 30 years for the murders of Miguel Anthony Valentin-Colon, Nicole Marie Merced-Plaud, and Dhamyl Roman-Audiffred on or about September 15-16, 2019.\n\nThe sentencing is the result of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, under the direction of Special Agent-in-Charge Matthew Miraglia; the Buffalo Police Department, under the direction of Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia; the Erie County Sheriff’s Office, under the direction of Sheriff John Garcia; the Erie County Central Police Services Forensic Laboratory.\n\n# # # #"
