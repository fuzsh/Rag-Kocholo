        "text": "In their must-read book on negotiation, Women Don’t Ask, professors Linda Babcock and Sara Laschever analyze the social and cultural factors that make women afraid to negotiate and ask for the things they need.\n\nWhile institutional factors are the biggest contributor to gender inequality and the pay gap, women are often told that they make less because they are bad negotiators. Women are told to just play hardball like the boys, and then they will get everything they want.\n\nWrong.\n\nIn fact, women who are too aggressive can damage their professional reputations.\n\n“As a society, we teach little girls (and I have a little girl, so I see this all the time) that it’s not nice or feminine or appropriate for them to focus on what they want and pursue their self-interest – and we don’t like it when they do,” Babcock wrote in the New York Times.\n\nWhether it’s a salary negotiation or trying to get a deal on a new car, women are less likely to ask for what they really want, and this has led to the inaccurate conclusion that women are by nature bad negotiators.\n\nWomen being bad negotiators was the most recent Republican talking point in opposition of the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n\nBut women are not bad negotiators."
