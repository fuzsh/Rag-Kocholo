        "text": "Results\n\nManipulation Check: Familiarity Effects\n\nParticipants indicated how they and their partner perceived their relations to test possible mediating familiarity effects. They gave answers on a 7-point scale ranging from 1, not at all acquainted, to seven very closely acquainted. The mean score for their acquaintance question was 2.13 (SD = 1.75), and the mean score for the partner’s acquaintance question was 2.16 (SD = 1.77). Thus, the obtained scores are low, suggesting that familiarity between partners in the game does not affect the results in the present research.\n\nNumber of Lies and Disbeliefs\n\nDue to the truth-telling bias, participants in the sender’s role would lie less than expected by chance and believe the sender more than expected when performing as receivers. Therefore, the total number of lies and disbeliefs were computed and averaged for participants. The means appear in . We used a one-sample t-test to compare the total lying and disbelieving scores with a chance expectancy of 5.0. Results for lies show that t(155) = −4.32, p < 0.001, d = 0.35, indicating that the number of lies is significantly smaller than that expected by chance. On the other hand, we found no significant results for the number of disbeliefs, t(155) = −0.28.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nN Sender’s liesReceiver’s disbeliefsMale654.71 (2.11)5.17 (1.04)Female914.07 (1.74)4.92 (1.19)Across1564.33 (1.93)5.03 (1.13)\n\nGender Differences\n\nWe hypothesized that men would lie more than women and would believe the sender less than women when in the role of the receiver. Therefore, the mean number of lies and the mean number of disbeliefs were computed separately for men and women and appear in .\n\nWe conducted A 2 × 2 ANOVA with one between-subject factor, gender (men and women), and one within-subject factor, role (sender’s lies and receiver’s disbeliefs) on the mean frequencies in . A significant role effect, F(1,154) = 13.2, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.079, emerged, indicating that the number of disbeliefs was larger than the number of lies. A significant gender effect, F(1,154) = 6.2, p = 0.014, ηp2 = 0.039, shows that men tended to lie more than women when in the role of the sender, t(153) = 2.07, p = 0.04, d = 0.34. However, there was no significant belief difference, t(153) = 1.36. Finally, the interaction effect was not significant.\n\nThe following question is whether these gender differences result from sender-receiver gender dyads? Specifically, would the dyadic gender composition affect frequent lying and disbelieving? Muehlheusser et al. (2015) provided some indications. They grouped participants in pairs and showed more lying in men and mixed groups than in women groups. However, these participants cooperated while participants in the present dyads competed. Therefore, we gathered participants into three gender dyads: Two uniform dyads (two men or two women) and one mixed-gender dyad (one man and one woman). presents frequencies of lies and disbeliefs computed for each of the three dyads.\n\nTABLE 2\n\nN LiesDisbeliefsDyadsMale/Male324.94 (2.26)5.16 (1.14)Male/Female664.30 (2.10)5.02 (1.18)Female/Female584.03 (1.41)4.97 (1.08)\n\nA 2 × 3 ANOVA, two levels of role (senders lies and receivers disbeliefs), and three levels of dyads (men, women, and a mixed-gender dyad), was performed on the mean frequencies presented in . Results show a significant main effect for role, F(1,153) = 10.9, p = 0.001, ηp2 = 0.067, indicating that disbelieved responses were more frequent than lies. shows that this is true for the three dyads. Although the dyad effect was not significant, F(1,153) = 2.5, p = 0.082, ηp2 = 0.032, shows a gradual decrease in lies and disbeliefs from men dyads through mixed to women dyads. We found no significant interaction effect. A closer inspection of the dyads reveals a significant difference in lying between men and women dyads, t(88) = 2.35, p = 0.021, d = 0.52. Men dyads showed more lying than women dyads. A comparison between the number of lies told by men to fellow men (men dyad) and by men to women in the mixed dyad (M = 4.48, SD = 1.97) reveals no significant difference [t(63) = 0.88]. Similarly, lies told by women to female partners (women dyad) are no more or less frequent than lies told by women to men in the mixed dyad (M = 4.12, SD = 2.23), t(89) = 0.24. We found no significant gender effect for disbeliefs.\n\nGenerating a Performance Index for Production and Detection of Lies and Truths\n\nWe generated an individual performance index for every participant and each behavior (production and detection of lies and truths). To this end, we computed the difference between successful and unsuccessful activities. Finally, we averaged the performance indexes across participants and presented them in .\n\nTABLE 3\n\nN ProductionDetectionLiesTruthsAcrossLiesTruthsAcrossMale650.98 (2.03)0.34 (2.25)0.66 (1.58)−0.62 (2.59)0.58 (2.87)−0.02 (1.66)Female91−0.02 (2.30)0.02 (2.82)0.00 (1.31)−0.92 (2.33)0.94 (2.43)0.01 (1.63)Across1560.40 (2.24)0.15 (2.15)0.28 (1.46)−0.79 (2.44)0.79 (2.62)0.00 (3.28)\n\nWe separated the production and detection indexes in and analyzed them separately. A 2 × 2 ANOVA with one between-subject factor, gender (men and women), and one within-subject factor, production (lies and truths), was performed on the lying and truth-telling production indexes. A significant gender effect emerged, F(1,154) = 8.12, p = 0.005, ηp2 = 0.05. A closer inspection of the results reveals that men were more convincing than women at telling lies, t(154) = 2.83, p = 0.005, d = 0.46, but not at telling truths, t(154) = 0.91. We found no production difference between lie-telling and truth-telling and no significant interaction effect.\n\nWe performed a similar 2 × 2 ANOVA on the detection indexes, with gender as the between-subject factor and detection as the within-subject factor. A significant detection effect emerged, F(1,154) = 23.97, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.135, indicating that participants were more efficient in detecting truths than lies. We conducted separate matched sample t-tests for men and women and found that both complied with the truth detection dominance, men, t(64) = 2.23, p = 0.029, and women, t(90) = 5.13, p < 0.001. We did not observe gender or interaction effects for the detection indexes.\n\nSelf-Assessed Lie- and Truth Related Abilities\n\nThe LTAAS (Zvi and Elaad, 2018) was used to examine four self-assessed abilities: tell-lies, tell-truths, detect-lies, and detect-truths (each ability comprised four items in the questionnaire). We averaged the four items for each assessed ability and the results, together with the corresponding Cronbach’s alpha reliability scores, appear in .\n\nTABLE 4\n\nMeanSD95% CICronbach’s α LTAAS Tell lies5.45(2.08)[5.12, 5.77]0.91 (N = 4)Detect lies6.13(1.84)[5.83, 6.42]0.92 (N = 4)Tell truth6.57(1.58)[6.32, 6.82]0.81 (N = 4)Detect truth6.78(1.77)[6.50, 7.06]0.89 (N = 4)\n\nshows that all ability assessments are higher than the middle point 5. Since the middle point stands for the assessed ability of the average person, participants attributed higher than average lie and truth communication abilities to themselves. Specifically, all ability assessments are biased. further shows that the measurement of all four assessments was reliable. We examined potential differences between the ability assessments using repeated measures one-way ANOVA. While correcting for the linearity assumption (ε = 0.817), a significant ability effect emerged, F(2.45,465) = 29.5, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.16. Results point at differences in the assessment of the four abilities. To further examine these differences, a priori Helmert contrasts were applied. The first contrast compared the mean rating of lie-telling, which was predicted to generate the lowest ability assessment, with the mean rating of the other abilities. A significant difference emerged, F(1,155) = 169.8, p < 0.001. The second contrast compared the mean rating of the ability to detect lies with the mean rating of the two truth-related abilities. A significant difference emerged, F(1,155) = 46.9, p < 0.001. Results indicated that, as expected, the truth-related abilities were assessed higher than the lie-detecting ability. Finally, the third contrast compared the mean ratings of truth-telling and truth-detection abilities. The difference was not significant.\n\nGender differences in lie- and truth related ability assessments were also considered. It was found that men rated their lie-telling ability (Mean = 6.06, SD = 2.25), significantly higher than women (Mean = 5.01, SD = 1.84), t(154) = 3.21, p = 0.002, d = 0.52. Similarly, men rated their truth telling ability (Mean = 6.89, SD = 1.62), significantly higher than women (Mean = 6.34, SD = 1.51), t(154) = 2.18, p = 0.031, d = 0.35. No significant gender differences emerged for detection ability assessments.\n\nFinally, we examined self-assessed lie- and truth-related abilities for their informative value as predictors of the number of lies, truths, beliefs, and disbeliefs in the game. We performed four linear regressions where the production and detection behaviors were dependent variables, and the equivalent self-assessed abilities were predictors. Results indicated that self-assessed lie telling ability predicted frequent lie-telling in the game, B = 0.299, β = 0.323, t = 4.23, p < 0.001, which explains 10.4% of the variance. The three other ability assessments failed to predict the corresponding behaviors. Specifically, high self-assessed lie-detection ability failed to predict a higher disbelief rate in the game. High self-assessed truth detection ability did not predict frequent believing responses. Finally, the high self-assessed truth-telling ability could not predict the truth bias or frequent presentation of white balls.\n\nWe employed a similar procedure for each performance index. We found insignificant linear regression predictions for performance indexes from the related self-assessed ability scores. Namely, the self-assessed lie-detection ability did not predict lie-detection performance. Likewise, the self-assessed lie-telling ability could not predict the lie-telling performance index and the perceived truth-telling and truth detecting abilities failed to predict the respective truth indexes.\n\nNarcissism\n\nWe computed narcissistic statistics for men and women ( ). shows that the reliability of the 40 NPI items was very high. The reliability of the NPI subscales was also extensive. presents significant gender differences in global narcissistic scores and the three narcissistic subscales where men show higher narcissistic tendencies than women.\n\nTABLE 5\n\nMeanSDCronbach’sαGender differences t(154) Narcissism 3.16 0.86 0.97 Male3.480.99Female2.930.674.15** Leadership/Authority 3.22 0.95 0.87 Male3.511.03Female3.020.833.28** Grandiose Exhibitionism 3.01 0.96 0.90 Male3.291.10Female2.810.783.19* Entitlement/Exploitativeness 3.09 0.94 0.7 Male3.471.08Female2.820.714.52**\n\nWe performed a linear regression analysis to examine the prediction of frequent lying by narcissism. The number of deceptions in the ten-trial session was entered as the dependent variable and the global narcissism score as the independent variable. The analysis indicated that the predicted lying frequency is significant, B = 0.698, β = 0.311, t = 4.07, p < 0.001, and narcissism accounted for 9.7% of the frequent lying variance. We added a hierarchical regression model to predict lying frequency by each of the three subscales of narcissism. We obtained no significant results.\n\nWe conducted a similar analysis for the number of disbelieved responses by the receiver in the 10 periods of the game. Again, the global narcissism score and the three subscales failed to predict frequent disbelief.\n\nNext, we examined narcissism as a predictor of the performance indexes. The linear regression model for predicting the truth-telling performance index from the global narcissism score was significant, B = 0.62, β = 0.25, t = 3.16, p = 0.002, and accounted for 6.1% of the index variance. Specifically, receivers believed truthful senders with higher narcissistic records more than truthful senders with lower narcissistic scores. We obtained similar significant results with each of the subscales. Specifically, the truth-telling performance was predicted by Leadership/Authority scores, B = 0.55, β = 0.215, t = 2.73, p = 0.007; Grandiose Exhibitionism scores, B = 0.48, β = 0.22, t = 2.79, p = 0.006; and Entitlement/Exploitativeness scores, B = 1.76, β = 0.325, t = 4.26, p < 0.001. The accounted variances were: 4.6, 4.8, and 10.6% respectively. The narcissism score and the three subscales failed to predict the performance index of lie-telling, lie-detection, and truth detection.\n\nRational-Experiential Inventory Scales\n\ndisplays descriptive REI statistics computed for men and women. First, internal consistency for both the rational and experiential scales was adequate. Next, the correlation between the two rankings was non-significant, r(156) = −0.137, which confirms the independence of the scales.\n\nTABLE 6\n\nN Rational scaleExperiential scaleMale653.80 (0.57)4.13 (0.67)Female913.73 (0.49)3.96 (0.52)Across Gender1563.76 (0.59)4.03 (0.53)Cronbach’s α0.740.83\n\nshows men tendency to be more experiential than women. Using a one-tailed independent-sample t-test indicate, that the experiential difference is significant, t(154) = 1.82, p = 0.036, d = 0.29, and gender differences in the experiential scale scores exists. The rational scale did not show a significant gender difference.\n\nWe applied a hierarchical multiple regression analysis on the number of lies in the sender’s ten-trials game. The two REI scale scores were entered as independent variables. Results for the experiential scale, B = 0.821, β = 0.252, t = 3.22, p = 0.002, confirmed the hypothesis that higher experiential scores predicted more lying. Results for the rational scale failed to predict lying frequency. Both scales were unable to predict frequent disbelief in the role of the receiver. We performed a hierarchical regression model for predicting the truth-telling performance index from the two REI subscales. Results show a significant prediction for the experiential scale, B = 0.62, β = 0.17, t = 2.14, p = 0.034, which accounted for 5.3% of the variance. The prediction of the rational scale was insignificant. We conducted similar regressions on the lie-telling, lie detection, and truth detection indexes. In all these cases, we obtained insignificant results.\n\nGeneral Discussion\n\nThe first experiment examined gender differences under strict control over many situational incentives to lie. Specifically, we ensured that the payoff matrix does not drive participants to prefer lying and disbelieving. We also removed any monetary reward that could differentially motivate lying. To control reciprocity, we kept secret sender’s and receiver’s decisions. In addition, we ensured that familiarity among participants was minimal. Participants faced each other, but their verbal communication was limited to a sender’s statement about the ball’s color in their fists. Receivers kept silent and only wrote down their decision. In this way, we controlled the flow of talking, which could have influenced lying and disbelieving.\n\nFurther, senders were free to decide whether to pick a white or a black ball, given that they choose one ball of each color at least once, and receivers were free to decide whether to believe the sender or not. Next, in some earlier studies, the gender of the partner remained unknown (e.g., Dreber and Johannesson, 2008; Conrads et al., 2013). In these cases, men used selfish lies more often than women. Therefore, we removed the moderating effect by ensuring that the present participants kept eye contact and knew the partner’s gender. Further, most previous deception studies employed students as participants (Gerlach et al., 2019). Since students are typically younger than a more representative sample of the population and have a better cognitive ability to justify their dishonest behavior (Gino and Ariely, 2012; Gerlach et al., 2019), they act more dishonestly (Abeler et al., 2014; Fosgaard et al., 2018). Therefore, we sampled our participants from the local community. Our setting is unique to our knowledge because no other study has paid attention to all these potential moderators.\n\nAs expected, we observed frequent truth-telling and believing in the first experiment, and the number of lies was significantly smaller than that expected by chance. We may explain the results by expectations such as the predominant truth-telling bias. It seems that women are more sensitive to the truth-telling bias than men. Still, the number of lies was considerable (43.3%), and we attributed them to internal motivation, including personal tendencies, perceived abilities, and preferred cognitive style.\n\nIn the second experiment, the payoff matrix inspired participants to lie more in the sender’s position, believe less in the receiver’s role, and challenge the truth-telling bias. Indeed, results showed more lie-telling and a higher disbelieving rate than in the first experiment.\n\nStill, some differences exist between the samples of the two experiments. First, the participants in the second experiment are younger. Besides participants from the local community, the sample comprised more students and other young people than in the first experiment. Thus, we may attribute some of the increased lying rates to the young age of the participants.\n\nSecond, considering the different men and women in the two experiments, the truth-bias explanation may be compromised. Specifically, women comprised 58.3% of the sample in the first experiment, whereas they consisted of only 40% in the second experiment. As men tend to lie more than women, we can attribute the increased lying rate in the second experiment to the more significant men frequency. Still, the second experiment showed a similar increase of disbelieving by men and women, which we attribute to the payoff matrix. Thus, the gender composition in the two experiments has only a marginal effect in explaining the obtained gender differences ( , ).\n\nIn both experiments, we found significant gender differences in frequent lying. A comprehensive meta-analysis about gender differences in black lies (Capraro, 2018) supports our result. Capraro indicated that men are significantly more likely than women to tell black lies: “males are more selfish than females and more concerned about social efficiency than females; while females are more concerned than males about reaching an equitable distribution of payoffs” (p. 353). Thus, we may suggest that gender differences in lying exist. The first experiment indicated that men’s disposition to lie more than women in a face-to-face deception game derives from men’s enhanced assessment of their lying ability, stronger narcissistic tendencies, and to some extent, men’s experiential thinking style. In particular, the first experiment provides evidence for gender differences in the self-assessed ability to lie persuasively. Men tended to assess the ability higher than women. Self-assessments are related to self-efficacy (Bandura, 1977). Bandura suggested that the way people perceive their skills may provide further information on how such perceptions influence emotions, cognition, and behavior. Feeling that they are capable liars may have driven men choices in the game. They chose to lie more frequently than women who were less convinced about their lying ability and adhered to the truth bias.\n\nExperiment 1 showed that men scored higher on narcissistic features than women, which predicted frequent lying. Results agree with earlier studies that associated narcissism with actual deception (e.g., Elaad and Zvi, 2019; Elaad et al., 2020). Therefore, we suggest that narcissism may explain, in part, the tendency of men to lie more than women. Finally, in the first experiment, higher experiential scores predicted frequent lying, and men tended to show more experiential thinking than women, which explains men’s tendency to lie more.\n\nThe second experiment replicated the first experiment’s results for gender differences in frequent lying. Again, we found that men lied more frequently than women, while no significant gender difference exists in believing. Nevertheless, the literature on the association between gender and frequent lying presents some negative results (e.g., Childs, 2012), implying that research on gender and deception should continue to clarify these inconsistencies.\n\nNext, we dealt with successfully telling and detecting lies and truths. To this end, we generated performance indexes based on the difference between successful and unsuccessful production and detection activities. Experiment 1 revealed no significant production difference between lies and truths. As to gender effects, men were more persuasive liars than women. Analyzing the detection indexes reveal agreement with the truth bias. Specifically, participants were more efficient truth detectors than lie detectors, which is true for both men and women. Finally, no significant gender differences exist for the detection indexes.\n\nExperiment 2 failed to replicate these results. Irrespective of gender differences, participants were more persuasive truth-tellers than liars. As to the detection indexes, men performed better as lie detectors than truth detectors and were more efficient lie detectors than women. Motivation differences cannot explain the inconsistent results of the two experiments. We may join Burgoon et al. (2006) conclusion about overstating the extent of sex differences. Nevertheless, the present results recommend caution in interpreting them. Future research should take the responsibility to clarify the inconsistencies, possibly by using larger experimental samples to compensate for the relatively small effect.\n\nIn the first experiment, we paid attention to sender-receiver gender dyads. We examined two single-gender dyads (two men or two women) and one inter-gender dyad (one man and one woman) for their effects on lying and believing. Results presented a gradual decrease in lies and disbeliefs from men dyads through mixed dyads to women dyads ( ). However, the effect is not significant. Further, the number of lies told by men to fellow men in men dyads was not different from that in mixed dyads. When we examined women’s lies, the lies told to other women were not more frequent than those delivered to men.\n\nIn both experiments, we asked participants to complete the LTAAS questionnaire. Results of the LTAAS were in complete agreement in the two experiments, which contributes to the reliability of the questionnaire. In both experiments, men assessed their lie-telling ability higher than women, but unlike the first experiment, lie-telling assessment scores in the second experiment failed to predict frequent lying. The last result may be unusual considering earlier outcomes that showed a consistent association between high self-assessed lying ability, reports of frequent lying (Zvi and Elaad, 2018), and predictions of actual lying in experimental settings (Elaad and Zvi, 2019; Elaad et al., 2020). Thus, confidence in telling lies drives people to increase their use of lies.\n\nAs to the LTAAS, earlier studies showed that the ability to tell lies convincingly was rated no better than average (e.g., Elaad, 2003; Elaad, 2018a). The present results showed that participants assessed their lie-telling ability higher than average in both experiments. Despite the high lie-telling ability ratings, gender differences in evaluating the lie-telling ability persist.\n\nThe LTAAS provides in addition information about self-assessed lie-detection ability. Inconsistent with the poor actual lie-detection performance (see a meta-analysis by Bond and DePaulo, 2008), people award above-average ratings to their lie-detecting skills (e.g., Elaad, 2018a). We explained the lie-detection bias by people’s tendency to maintain a good impression. People like to believe that their success in detecting lies protects them from being easily deceived by others.\n\nWe obtained higher than average lie-detection ratings in the two present experiments. Previous accounts did not associate the lie-detection bias with frequent disbelieving in experimental settings. In this respect, the association between high self-assessed lie-detection ability and low disbelief rate under conditions that encourage disbelief is surprising. Results suggest that people with confidence about correctly detecting lies tend to restrain disbelieving in the experimental setting. We found no such restrain under conditions that stimulated truth-telling and believing. We observed this link for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, and therefore, the result deserves additional research.\n\nPrevious research indicated strong bonds between self-assessed lie-telling ability and narcissistic features (Zvi and Elaad, 2018; Elaad et al., 2020). The present results are not different, and the correlation between lie-telling ability assessments and global narcissism scores is very high, r(156) = 0.66. Giammarco et al. (2013) further noted that narcissistic individuals believe to be better liars than the average person. Additionally, as with lie-telling assessments, men showed significantly higher global narcissism scores than women. Men scored higher than women also in the three narcissistic subscales: Leadership/Authority, Grandiose Exhibitionism, and Entitlement/Exploitativeness.\n\nEarlier accounts described positive relations between narcissism and reported lying or unethical behavior in everyday life situations (Oliveira and Levine, 2008; Baughman et al., 2014; Azizli et al., 2016). Specifically, the described literature indicates that narcissistic individuals lie more and trust less than average. Thus, predictions about the association between narcissism and frequent lying received support in the present study.\n\nWe hypothesized that high REI experiential scores predict frequent lying in the deception game. Results confirmed the hypothesis. Pacini and Epstein (1999) found a positive association between high experiential scores and extraversion. Although we did not examine extraversion in the present study, some aspects of extraversion that were discussed may be appropriate to explain the results. For example, extrovert’s social experience and the opportunities to lie and improve their lying skills drive them to be confident in their lying abilities (Elaad and Reizer, 2015). We found similar associations between confidence in lie-telling and actual lying in the present deception game. In contrast, high REI experiential scorers did not believe senders more than lower experiential scorers. Finally, we found no significant associations between rational REI scores and lie telling frequency or believing frequency.\n\nWe examined for the first time the association between high REI experiential scores and frequent lying under the influence of the truth-telling bias. Future research should apply the REI scales under conditions that explicitly encourage lying.\n\nLimitations and Suggestions for Future Research\n\nWhen we looked for interaction effects, we lacked power. The overall gender effect is too small to support such interactions with our present sample. Future research interested in possible gender interactions should use a much larger sample.\n\nThe present design is limited to low stakes. Participants knew that they were participating in a game, and they would not experience any consequences from their deception in the game. Stakes are essential because lies often entail mental effort, unlike the present low-stakes design (Vrij, 2008). When telling high-stake lies, liars are committed to the lie, must maintain the fake story, remember what they said earlier to whom and under which circumstances, be careful not to contradict themselves, and convey a logical sequence of events. For these reasons, liars experience increased cognitive load, which we spared from the present participants. Future research should compare two stake levels to look for possible effects of cognitive load on preferences for lying or truth-telling in a face-to-face deception game."
