        "text": "Lisa Desjardins:\n\nWell, let me take you to Long Island. That's where he won this seat. It was an open and competitive seat.\n\nGeorge Santos is 34 years old, and he is someone who actually our viewers may be familiar with, because he made history as the first Republican who will enter Congress as an openly gay person. Now, as part of his campaign, he made several claims about his life history.\n\nAnd let's look at what he has claimed and what he is now admitting, in part, are not true. First of all, he claimed that he worked for Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. He says that is not true. He now says he had a — worked at a firm that worked with them. He also claimed that he graduated from Baruch College. He never graduated from college at all, he now says.\n\nHe also claims to be a businessman, a successful businessman, owning 17 properties, now says he does not own any property. And, for the time being, he is actually living with his sister.\n\nNow, how does he explain all of this? He has been doing interviews with local media. He says these were embellishments. He says this is a part of media culture. There's a bit of gymnastic logic here. But, in this interview, he pointed to The New York Times, for example, as calling a job that he had as a customer service rep an odd job.\n\nHere's what he said.\n\nGeorge Santos (R), New York Congressman-Elect: For The New York Times to diminish it and call it an odd job just shows you the type of preconceived notion that people give to people who work hard, right?\n\nSo that's where I probably felt, in a sense, the need to not share that and the need to embellish a little bit my resume, which I regret. Regrettably. And, in hindsight — in hindsight, vision is always 20/20.\n\nLisa Desjardins:\n\nThe Constitution dictates this, Article 1 of the Constitution. Only Congress itself can expel its members. And it takes a two-thirds vote of the House chamber to do that.\n\nThere is no expectation that that will happen. One reason, Kevin McCarthy has a very narrow, very slim Republican majority in the House. He cannot afford to lose any votes, certainly not now, as he's trying to become speaker a week from today.\n\nNow, what could happen, there are some, including other Republicans, now calling for an ethics investigation. The House Ethics Committee is evenly divided, Republicans and Democrats. They could recommend a censure. They could recommend a reprimand, those kinds of things.\n\nI think we're going to be watching more carefully for perhaps investigations outside of Congress into the finances and all of his kind of campaign disclosures overall.\n\nLisa Desjardins:\n\nI have a prominent, closely involved source who told me that the National Republican Campaign Committee that runs the campaigns for the House Republicans knew about George Santos' issues and problems, that there were, in fact, falsehoods as part of his resume, before the election, and chose not to disclose it.\n\nThat source told me Kevin McCarthy also knew. Now, the NRCC on the record told me today that's false. They completely reject that idea. They say they didn't know\n\nHow did any — how did nobody know? How are we just finding out? Well, Republicans have — will say privately, listen, we're not going to say anything bad about one of our guys. How about Democrats? Their job is to find out the problems on their opponents, right?\n\nWhen you talk to Democrats today, they say, we only look to the public information. A lot of this was private, things about where he went to school or if he went to school.\n\nI think the truth is that the Democrats really feel that this is probably a missed opportunity. It right now looks like there will be another race in that district not for two years."
