Here is how you can earn back some of your credibility. First, reflect on why you lied. Underneath our lies are unmet needs that we believe lying might satisfy. Identifying these needs is the first step to finding healthier ways to fulfill them. Next, evaluate the gap between the reputation you want and the reputation you have. Once you are clear on this, you can more accurately evaluate the degree of doubt you may have raised. Finally, now that you have identified the conclusions people have drawn about you, practice demonstrating honesty in ways that refute them.",
