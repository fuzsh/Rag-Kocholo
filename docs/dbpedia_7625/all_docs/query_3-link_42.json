        "text": "Updated with information about land border travel restrictions.\n\nExercise increased caution in Ecuador due to civil unrest, crime, and kidnapping. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.\n\nDo not travel to:\n\nGuayaquil, south of Portete de Tarqui Avenue, due to crime.\n\nThe cities of Huaquillas and Arenillas in the province of El Oro, due to crime.\n\nThe cities of Quevedo, Quinsaloma, and Pueblo Viejo in the province of Los Rios, due to crime.\n\nThe canton of Duran, in the province of Guayas, due to crime.\n\nEsmeraldas city and all areas north of Esmeraldas city in Esmeraldas province, due to crime.\n\nReconsider travel to:\n\nGuayaquil north of Portete de Tarqui Avenue due to crime.\n\nEl Oro province outside the cities of Huaquillas and Arenillas, due to crime.\n\nLos Rios province outside the cities of Quevedo, Quinsaloma, and Pueblo Viejo, due to crime.\n\nAll areas south of Esmeraldas city in Esmeraldas province, due to crime.\n\nThe provinces of Sucumbios, Manabi, Santa Elena, and Santo Domingo due to crime.\n\nCountry Summary: Crime is a widespread problem in Ecuador. Violent crime, such as murder, assault, kidnapping, and armed robbery, is prevalent and widespread. The rate of violent crime is significantly higher in areas where transnational criminal organizations are concentrated.\n\nDemonstrations occur frequently throughout the country, usually motivated by political and/or economic factors. Demonstrators routinely block local roads and major highways, often without prior notice which can lead to disruption in access to critical infrastructure.\n\nOutside of Ecuador’s major towns and cities, much of the country’s territory is sparsely populated and isolated. Government assistance may be very limited and can lead to significant delays for assistance to U.S. citizens in remote areas.\n\nLand Border Restrictions: All foreign citizens entering the country via land border crossings from Colombia or Peru are required to present an apostilled certificate showing a lack of criminal record. Further information is available on the Ministry of Tourism’s webpage and at Ecuador.Travel. All U.S. citizens planning to enter Ecuador via a land border should comply with this requirement. See Travel.State.Gov’s Office of Authentications webpage and Criminal Records Check webpage for information on how to obtain a criminal record check and apostille from the United States. The U.S. Embassy and Consulate General in Ecuador cannot assist citizens crossing a land border in obtaining the required documentation.\n\nRead the country information page for additional information on traveling to Ecuador.\n\nIf you decide to travel to Ecuador:\n\nEnroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.\n\nFollow the Department of State on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram\n\nReview the Country Security Report for Ecuador.\n\nPrepare a contingency plan for emergency situations. Review the Traveler’s Checklist.\n\nVisit the CDC page for the latest Travel Health Information related to your travel.\n\nLevel 4: Do Not Travel\n\nGuayaquil, south of Portete de Tarqui Avenue, due to crime.\n\nThe cities of Huaquillas and Arenillas in the Province of El Oro, due to crime.\n\nThe cities of Quevedo, Quinsaloma, and Pueblo Viejo in the province of Los Rios, due to crime.\n\nThe canton of Duran, in the province of Guayas, due to crime.\n\nEsmeraldas city and all areas north of Esmeraldas city in Esmeraldas province, due to crime.\n\nTransnational criminal groups and local gangs regularly engage in violent criminal acts in these areas, including indiscriminate attacks without warning in public spaces. Violent crimes have included murder, targeted assassinations, armed robberies, bombings, kidnappings, and assaults, among others. Violence in these areas has steadily increased in frequency and brutality in recent months, posing an increased security risk to U.S. citizens. U.S. government personnel are prohibited from traveling to these areas without prior authorization. As a result, the U.S. government is limited in its ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in these areas.\n\nLevel 3: Reconsider Travel\n\nGuayaquil north of Portete de Tarqui Avenue, due to crime.\n\nEl Oro province outside the cities of Huaquillas and Arenillas, due to crime.\n\nLos Rios province outside the cities of Quevedo, Quinsaloma, and Pueblo Viejo, due to crime.\n\nAll areas south of Esmeraldas city in Esmeraldas province, due to crime.\n\nThe provinces of Sucumbios, Manabi, Santa Elena, and Santo Domingo, due to crime.\n\nTransnational criminal groups and local gangs have sporadically engaged in violent criminal activity in these areas, with violence increasing in recent months. U.S. government personnel are directed to exercise extreme caution and maintain increased vigilance when traveling in and around these areas.\n\nVisit our website for Travel to High-Risk Areas.\n\nExercise increased caution when traveling in Ecuador, and do not travel to the province of Carchi, the province of Sucumbíos, and the northern part of Esmeraldas province, including Esmeraldas city due to crime. U.S. government personnel may travel to the northern bank of the Napo River in Sucumbíos, where tourist lodges are located, an area approximately four miles wide, and to the portion of Esmeraldas province that is south of Esmeraldas city.\n\nAll other U.S. government travel to the northern border area is prohibited without prior permission. This region has a high rate of violent crime. U.S. citizens are not targeted, but have been victims of crime there in the past.\n\nCrime: Crime is a widespread problem in Ecuador.\n\nPick-pocketing, robbery, and hotel room theft are the most common crimes. Tourists have been robbed at gunpoint on beaches and along hiking trails. Passengers arriving at the Quito and Guayaquil airports have also been targets of armed robberies.\n\nUse hotel safes if available, avoid wearing obviously expensive jewelry or clothing, and carry only the cash or credit cards that you need. Stay alert in crowds and on public transportation. Be aware that thieves might create distractions to target you.\n\nBe alert for robberies, in which criminals enter a taxi and force victims to withdraw money from ATMs. Some victims have been beaten or raped. Avoid hailing taxis on the street. Order taxis by phone or use a service affiliated with major hotels. Avoid withdrawing large amounts of cash at one time. Use ATMs in well-protected indoor areas.\n\nTo avoid carjacking or theft from your car while you are stopped at intersections, drive with your doors locked and windows rolled up. Do not leave valuables in plain view.\n\nSexual assaults and rapes can occur, even in tourist areas. Travel in groups, do not leave food or drinks unattended, and never allow a stranger to give you a drink.\n\nDo not let your credit card out of your sight in order to avoid credit card “skimming.”\n\nIncapacitating drugs, such as rohypnol and scopolamine, have been used to facilitate violent robberies and sexual assaults.\n\nCivil Unrest: Demonstrations may occur occasionally. They may take place in response to local or international events or on politically significant holidays. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Protesters may block roads and sometimes burn tires, throw rocks, and damage property.\n\nPolice may respond using water cannons and tear gas.\n\nAvoid demonstrations and prepare back-up transportation plans. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent with little or no warning.\n\nA disaster can disrupt food supply, so plan to have at least a 3-day supply of food and medicine on hand.\n\nCheck local media for updates and traffic advisories.\n\nInternational Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information.\n\nVictims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy in Quito or Consulate in Guayaquil for assistance. Report crimes to the local police by calling 911. In Quito, you can visit an Ecuadorian Tourist Security Service Attention Center. You can also contact the U.S. Embassy at +593-2-398-5000 or the U.S. Consulate General in Guayaquil at +593-4-371-7000.\n\nRemember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.\n\nSee our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas.\n\nInformation about victim’s assistance programs in Ecuador is available on the U.S. Mission in Ecuador website.\n\nWe can:\n\nhelp you find appropriate medical care\n\nassist you in reporting a crime to the police\n\ncontact relatives or friends with your written consent\n\nprovide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion\n\nprovide a list of local attorneys\n\nprovide our information on victim’s compensation programs in the United States.\n\nprovide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution\n\nhelp you find accommodation and arrange flights home\n\nreplace a stolen or lost passport\n\nDomestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy or Consulate General for assistance.\n\nTourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.\n\nCriminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.\n\nPenalties for possessing, using, or trafficking illegal drugs in Ecuador are severe. Offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.\n\nNever agree to carry a suitcase or package through customs for anyone.\n\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see the State Department’s website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website.\n\nArrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate General immediately. See our webpage for further information.\n\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods: Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the U.S. Department of Justice website for more information.\n\nSeismic Activity: There are numerous active volcanoes, and earthquakes are common. Earthquakes can trigger deadly tsunamis. Visit Ecuador’s National Risk Management Secretariat and the Ecuadorian Geophysical Institute for more information.\n\nMud or lava flows from Tungurahua volcano could pose a significant and immediate threat to travelers in Baños.\n\nThe town of Latacunga is directly in the path of potential mud or lava flow from the Cotopaxi volcano. Even small emissions from the volcano can trigger avalanches and landslides. Low lying areas in the greater Quito area could also be affected if Cotopaxi erupts.\n\nReventador volcano is located in Napo province and is one of the most active in the country.\n\nSangay volcano is located in Morona Santiago province is active and local authorities advise against approaching the volcano and nearby Upano river.\n\nIn the event of a natural disaster, pay attention to the news media for updates. A disaster can disrupt food supply, so plan to have at least a 3-day supply of food and medicine on hand.\n\nSee the Centers for Disease Control website for information on emergency preparedness and response.\n\nHallucinogens: Traditional hallucinogens, often referred to as ayahuasca or San Pedro, are often marketed to tourists as “spiritual cleansing” and typically contain dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a strong hallucinogen that is illegal in the United States, Ecuador, and many other countries. Health risks are not well understood, and, on occasion, people suffer serious illness or death after taking these drugs. Intoxicated travelers also have been assaulted and robbed. These incidents often occur a great distance from medical facilities, making the risks even greater.\n\nGalápagos Islands: Be aware of the following challenges:\n\nMany Ecuadorian tour vessels operating in the Galápagos do not meet international safety standards. Inquire about safety features when boarding vessels.\n\nThe two hospitals on Santa Cruz and San Cristobal Islands do not perform major medical procedures.\n\nSerious injury or illness in the Galapagos typically requires medical evacuation to the Ecuadorian mainland or the United States. This can cost $60,000 or more and take significant time to arrange. We strongly recommend you purchase travel insurance that includes health coverage and air evacuation.\n\nThere are limited decompression facilities for scuba divers.\n\nThe Ecuadorian government restricts the entry of certain items into the Galapagos. Visit the Agency for Biosecurity and Quarantine Regulation and Control for the Galapagos for more information.\n\nRetiring in Ecuador: In recent years, Ecuador has become a top overseas destination for retiring U.S. citizens.\n\nU.S. citizens have reported unethical practices by lawyers, real estate agents, and others, resulting in costly losses and little hope of remedy through the local judicial system.\n\nEcuadorian rules governing visas and customs are subject to change with little notice. The Ecuadorian government publishes little information in English. The U.S. Embassy and U.S. Consulate General cannot give detailed advice about Ecuadorian immigration law.\n\nFaith-Based Travelers: See our following webpages for details:\n\nFaith-Based Travel Information\n\nInternational Religious Freedom Report\n\nHuman Rights Report\n\nHajj Fact Sheet for Travelers\n\nBest Practices for Volunteering Abroad\n\nLGBTI Travelers: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGBTI events in Ecuador.\n\nSee our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details.\n\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: Travelers with disabilities might have difficulty accessing buildings. Sidewalks in some areas are narrow and poorly maintained.\n\nStudents: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips.\n\nWomen Travelers: See our travel tips for Women Travelers."
