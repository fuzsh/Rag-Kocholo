        "text": "Table of Contents\n\nWhile the occasional white lie is considered to be a normal part of social interactions, repeated and elaborate fabrications cross into a very different territory. But what do you do when you realise the person you love lies pathologically?\n\nPersistent dishonesty is a clear sign of something gone wrong in a friend or loved one. As trust is a fundamental component of relationships, repeated violations of it indicate serious problems are afoot. This can occur for a variety of reasons, and ascertaining the root cause of dishonesty in a compulsive liar is critical in addressing the problem and beginning to rebuild relationships.\n\nPathological lying is a unique type of mental health disorder that often co-occurs with other mental health conditions. Understanding the nuances of this complex issue can help you know if your loved one is struggling with this condition, and how to support a compulsive liar.\n\nWhat Is Pathological Lying?\n\nA pathological liar is broadly defined as a person who tells compulsive, elaborate lies frequently. The lies may vary in terms of function – while some may be told in order to portray the person in a positive or sympathetic light, others may have no clear purpose. Some common characteristics pathological liars tend to share are:\n\nLying without any benefit or reason – do you notice your friend lying seemingly only for the sake of lying? This is a common trait of pathological lying, and a clear sign that lying has become reflexive and habitual.\n\nTelling lies that are complicated, dramatic, and detailed – though the stories might seem far-fetched, the convincing way they are told in a pathological lie can make them seem believable.\n\nBelieving (or seeming to believe) their own lies – some experts believe that because people who pathologically lie do so with great ease and frequency, they may not always remember what is real, and what they’ve made up.\n\nThe lies may make the person telling them seem like a hero, or a victim – pathological liars sometimes tell lies to gain sympathy or admiration. If you notice someone frequently lying about their health, wealth, or career status, this could be a sign of pathological lying.\n\nWhat Makes a Pathological Lie Different from Other Lies?\n\nThere is a significant difference between pathological lies and white lies. A white lie, or a lie told to avoid hurting someone’s feelings, is a common by-product of many social interactions. You could truthfully tell your friend, for example, that you think his new haircut makes him look ten years older, but you don’t want to make him feel bad, so you instead say it looks great. White lies are told without any ill-intent, and are generally considered to be harmless.\n\nSimilarly, a lie from time to time, such as an occasional lie told to avoid conflict or blame, is problematic but not necessarily a sign that someone is mentally ill.\n\nPathological lies are continuous, compulsive, complex, and can occur for no apparent reason. This could include creating a completely false personal history, making up a fictional relationship with a celebrity, or claiming to be suffering from a dire illness. When further questioned, a compulsive liar might give quick and detailed responses that only vaguely answer the question. Despite scepticism or frustration from others with the lack of truthfulness, pathological often display little concern or guilt about getting found out.\n\nIn short, all people lie on occasion, but pathological liars lie compulsively with stories that are complex and intricate.\n\nIs There a Pathological Liar Test?\n\nCurrently, there is no standardised, medically accepted pathological liar test. In order to make this diagnosis, a mental health specialist will need to consider a variety of factors, including whether common characteristics of the condition are present, and how long symptoms of this disorder have been occurring.\n\nWhat Causes Pathological Lying?\n\nIn some cases, pathological lying is a singular disorder known as pseudologia fantastica or factitious disorder, in which the person’s main symptom is the compulsive need to lie about both big and small issues for no clear reason. However, psychiatrists have found that pathological or excessive lying behaviour is often connected to other mental health conditions, particularly personality disorders. Some common conditions linked to pathological lying include:\n\nNarcissistic Personality Disorder – the exaggerated sense of self-importance that is a key characteristic of NPD can be manifested in a compulsive liar’s boastful lies about their personal accomplishments, social connections, or career achievements.\n\nObsessive Compulsive Disorder – pathological lying has been found in some people struggling with OCD as a negative coping mechanism, employed to create affiliative relationships with others or to attempt to cover their OCD symptoms.\n\nAnxiety Disorders – a person struggling with anxiety and fear of rejection may also develop into a compulsive liar as a way to try and protect a sensitive psyche.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder – people living with this disorder often display pathological lying as a key symptom, and may use lies to gain status or manipulate others.\n\nOther factors may also influence the development of pathological lying. For example, childhood trauma might cause the sufferer to lie frequently in order to create a persona that can withstand the negative environment, a habit that can persist into adulthood. Some scientists also believe that different hormone levels, specifically higher levels of testosterone and lower levels of cortisol, may also play into whether a person becomes a pathological liar.\n\nHow to Help a Pathological Liar\n\nFor adults, pathological lying can be a difficult condition to treat, as lying has often become habitual and automatic. Telling lies can activate the “risk and reward” centre in the brain, meaning that the thrill of telling a lie and the sense of accomplishment a compulsive liar feels when they’ve gotten away with it can become addictive. This type of addiction, combined with the potential presence of other underlying mental health conditions, can complicate the desire for people who pathologically lie to seek treatment on their own.\n\nFriends and family members can be a critical source of support and encouragement for people struggling with pathological lying. If you are trying to have a conversation with a loved one about their lying, it is helpful to keep a few key points in mind:\n\nIt’s not personal – remember that pathological lying is not about deceiving you specifically, but is compulsive and often linked to a mental health condition.\n\nBe supportive, yet firm – it is easy to get frustrated and lose your temper when faced with persistent dishonesty from a compulsive liar, however this is likely to be counterproductive. Hold your ground, but be kind.\n\nDon’t engage with a lie – if your loved one begins to lie, you can ask questions that can dismantle the lie, or refuse to engage further until you can have a truthful discussion. Let them know that you support them, but you will not go along with pathological lying.\n\nEncourage professional help – expressing concern without judgement is a critical part of letting a compulsive liar know you genuinely care about their wellbeing. Helping to connect your loved one with information or resources about pathological lying and its related mental health conditions may be useful in supporting their decision to seek treatment.\n\nUnderstanding the Difference Between Pathological and Compulsive Liars\n\nPathological and compulsive lying both involve a pattern of persistent dishonesty, but they differ subtly in their characteristics and motivations.\n\nA person who lies pathologically does so habitually and excessively, often without a clear or logical motive. As we’ve discussed, the lies told by a pathological liar are typically self-serving, painting them in a more positive or interesting light. They may create elaborate narratives about their past, achievements, or experiences that are far from the truth.\n\nIn contrast, compulsive liars engage in lying compulsively. Essentially someone who lies even when it’s unnecessary or offers no apparent benefit. The lies told by compulsive liars can be about minor or major things, but the key factor is the compulsive nature of the lying, which can feel out of the liar’s control.\n\nCompulsive lying can be a symptom of certain mental disorders, such as Borderline Personality Disorder. Individuals often experience intense fear of abandonment and unstable relationships. In an attempt to manage these fears and control their environment, they may become compulsive liars.\n\nThe lies told by someone with this disorder may be an attempt to manipulate others’ perceptions of them or to gain sympathy. However, not everyone with Borderline Personality Disorder lies compulsively.\n\nFinding Your Truth at The Dawn Mental Retreat Thailand\n\nSeeking treatment for pathological lying and potentially other underlying mental health conditions can be a daunting process.
