        "text": "As you gather a bouquet of flowers for your mother and prepare to bring her scrambled eggs in bed this weekend, consider some new research from data and market research company, Savanta: Nearly half of American women think society lies to girls about what motherhood is really like.\n\nNot only that, 69% say workplaces do not support mothers enough, and 75% say that motherhood is harder now than it was in previous generations.\n\nLook, not to cast aspersions on mothers on this, their (our) holy day but: Harder than previous generations?! I’d say tell that to your great-grandma, who was feeding eight kids she didn’t especially want, plus their dad, three times a day without a refrigerator or a dishwasher or the right to vote, but you can’t. She’s finally getting some rest because she’s dead!\n\nSavanta got their results by polling more than 2,000 U.S. adults over 18 earlier this month. The results of the poll don’t go into the whys, but I am both a woman and a mother and I have some ideas.\n\nMaybe this: Our culture worships the idea of motherhood, in some places going so far as to force people into the role, but does very little to support moms once they have kids.\n\nThis isn’t news to anyone with kids and it’s almost too exhausting to repeat the list of ways having kids is going to cost you more money than you have, but here’s one item: I gave birth in a hospital once, medicated but no complications, and it took a year to pay off. And I have great insurance!\n\nOr this: In 2022, Fox 12 had this reassuring headline: “For Oregon parents, daycare costs more than college.”\n\n“Parents in Oregon pay an average of just over $13,600 per year in childcare costs for infants,” Simon Gutierrez wrote, “while the average annual tuition at a four-year public college is $10,363.”\n\nMy experience says, yeah, this is true and also, if I’d been paying on my student loans over the last four years what I have been paying to childcare providers, I probably wouldn’t have any student loans left.\n\nBut honestly, it’s more than just the money. It’s the culture.\n\n“Have a baby and be happy” is the text or subtext of a lot of our media. Having a baby is the next step into adulthood, sometimes described as the only real path towards womanhood.\n\n“You won’t know real love until you have a baby,” is the message. “You won’t know real sacrifice, know who you truly are, until you become a mom.”\n\nThat, of course, isn’t true. Some of the happiest, most loving, most selfless people I know don’t have kids.\n\nMoms often participate in pressuring non-moms, whether they mean to or not, just like drinkers trying to get you to buy another beer or smokers asking if you want one of your own. Or if you already have one, don’t you really want two? Maybe it’s because parenthood is bewildering and if other people do it, we feel like maybe we weren’t so insane to get into this in the first place.\n\nMisery loves company. And a lot of moms are miserable.\n\nThey are tired, they are doing all the emotional labor, they are trying to be successful in their careers, keep their kids alive and fed with healthy, organic meals, make sure they are getting the correct amount of academic, social and physical engagement and not too much screen time. They are suddenly realizing it’s Teacher Appreciation Week and cutting things out for Teacher Appreciation Week, while simultaneously trying to remember if they washed enough socks, what time their therapy appointment is and if they have taken a shower this week while also worrying about climate change and whether or not they have let every aspect of the person they were before kids wither and die from disuse.\n\nIt’s a lot.\n\nBut look: I don’t actually personally think motherhood is misery. I also don’t think it’s harder today than it was for my mom, or her mom, or her mom, or God forbid, her mom.\n\nOur culture lies to us about almost everything, mostly as a way to get us to buy more products. That’s capitalism, guys! And if we have this idealized version of motherhood, or marriage or adulthood in general, in our minds, the reality, when we face it, can be a huge disappointment.\n\nThe problem is the dishonesty, not the motherhood itself.\n\nIf you think about motherhood today versus what our grandmothers dealt with, we are living a dream.\n\nI chose to become a mother when I was deep into my 30s, something my grandmas couldn’t do. I had the number of kids I could handle (one), something my grandmas couldn’t do, once I was at a point in my career where I felt secure, also something my grandmas couldn’t do.\n\nAnd I have a husband who makes every school lunch, every day, something my grandpas would never dream of.\n\nOf course, that doesn’t mean it isn’t hard. It’s really, incredibly hard, even with the one kid! It’s life-changing in a way that is totally incomprehensible before it happens. Every aspect of your life re-orients towards this tiny, needy roommate who you didn’t interview beforehand, and almost every day you feel like a total failure at the job of taking care of the needy roommate’s needs.\n\nBut, as you bring your mom her runny eggs and flowers still dirty from her garden today, remember, even if she complains sometimes, she loves you more than anything on planet Earth, in a way that borders on problematic. Some of it might be a lie, but that part isn’t. It’s a chemical reaction, sure, but that doesn’t make it any less true.\n\nAlso, can you please just give her a few minutes? She really needs to take a shower.\n\n– Lizzy Acker covers life and culture and writes the advice column Why Tho? Reach her at 503-221-8052, lacker@oregonian.com or @lizzzyacker"
