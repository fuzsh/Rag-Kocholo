        "text": "Last updated on February 6, 2024 by Shannon\n\nVisiting the Middle East was a goal for my travels for a long while. I had always wanted to travel to the Middle East, but didn’t make it there on my round the world trip, or in several subsequent years of travels.\n\nWhy? Well, some of it came down to perception—I travel solo and I wasn’t sure if it would be safe to visit anywhere in the Middle East as a solo female traveler.\n\nBut the chance to visit Jordan with a dear friend cropped up unexpectedly while I was living in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and I thought: “Yes, now’s my chance to see if my safety concerns matched the reality on the ground.”\n\nIs Now the Time to Visit the Middle East?!\n\nThere have been tensions and conflicts in the Middle East since the beginning of time, so it’s easy to believe there is no good time to visit the area, and no countries safe from the conflict.\n\nThe reality could not be further from the truth. Although there are absolutely unsafe areas in the Middle East, the media is heavy-handed with political coverage on exactly those conflict zones, and the U.S. Department of State has warnings issued for a lot of countries in the region.\n\nBut there are lesser-known countries offering rich cultural heritage and an unexpected mantle of safety. Jordan is one of them.\n\nNon-confrontational foreign policies mean that Jordan is on great terms with the U.S., the UK, and several nearby countries, and belongs to the United Nations. And while Arabic is the country’s official language, English is widely spoken and taught at many public schools in the country. That means Jordan a great option for travelers looking for a safe way to visit the Middle East.\n\nWait, Where’s Jordan Located?\n\nJordan is located in the geographic region known as the Middle East and shares borders with Israel, Iraq, Syria, and Saudi Arabia.\n\nFrom a safety perspective, much of Jordan is safe but all travelers should give the borders with Syria and Iraq a wide berth (a minimum of 5 km)—this is essential for a safe trip to Jordan. There are countless beautiful areas of the country far from those conflict-ridden borders.\n\nIs Jordan Safe to Visit?\n\nJordan is safe for travelers overall, but there is a “Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution” travel advisory from the U.S. Department of State in effect since October 2022. Practically speaking, the travel advisory includes key information on areas that have spillover from the conflicts in Syria and Iraq.\n\nNote that the USDS errs very heavily on the side of caution when issuing travel advisories—the best bet is to compare the U.S. travel advisory with that from the United Kingdom and Canada for a clear official picture of the safety situation. Why check these sources? You should know the areas of the country where there have been recent demonstrations and where you should have deeper vigilance.\n\nWhere is the current safety risk in Jordan? Terrorist threats occur against Jordanian targets fairly regularly, but the government thwarts them and there have been no major attacks since 2016. The treat of these is why there is elevated risk levels and warnings from the US, UK, and Canada.\n\nIn short: Jordan is safe enough to plan travel and have a good time in the most popular regions of the country. On the ground, travelers report that Jordan feels quite safe and besides some of the usual issues—pickpocketing, etc.—that outright violence is not presence.\n\nThat said, females and solo travelers should take caution—and all travelers should take more precautions than they might in some areas of the world.\n\nIs Jordan Safe for Females and Solo Travelers?\n\nJordan is one of the only countries in the world where I have been sexually harassed (Turkey is the other). I was walking with a friend under the midday sun, dressed modestly with no skin showing, and my driver and tour guide were 25 paces ahead of me on the sidewalk when a group of rowdy young men walked by and aggressively squeezed my breast.\n\nThat was it—done in an instant and over in a flash. I was so startled that I barely reacted before they were far behind us. I was left spluttering while my best friend questioned me, verifying what she saw is what actually happened. It did. And it sucked. I felt defeated and off-kilter by that sudden and unprovoked assault.\n\nAnd yet, it’s not the strongest memory of my time in Jordan—I remember the smiles of women at the social enterprises we visited, the awe-inspiring sight of Petra, feeling sheepish as I tried to work out how to properly accept and drink tea with the Bedouin, and frolicking in the Dead Sea.\n\nDoes that moment mean that Jordan is unsafe for women, solo travelers, or female solo travelers? Not at all. Jordan is as safe as any country for women—this incident could have been anywhere in the world. Now, there was a slightly higher probability of it happening in Jordan, given the cultural norms in the region toward women.\n\nThat’s what travelers should keep in mind: Local Jordanian women are treated differently in Jordan (and all of the Middle East) than the independence and autonomy that women in the West are afforded. Those differing attitudes have spillover.\n\nExtreme violence in Jordan is not common, but the region’s attitudes mean that female travelers, particularly those traveling alone but not only those traveling solo, should take all of the normal cautions women take anywhere: don’t get inebriated past the point of functioning, ask your guesthouse for trusted drivers, don’t walk alone at night. These tips are not isolated to Jordan—they reflect what women have to contend with anywhere in the world.\n\nIn short? Is it safe for solo female travelers: Yes, but be aware of gender-based cultural attitudes and prevent situations where women are alone and vulnerable near men or groups of men. Always sit in the back seat of a taxi.\n\nRead: An Honest Conversation About Safety and Solo Female Travel\n\nWhat are the Main Risks and Issues\n\nSafety is a deep topic, it involves general travel safety—will I face a terrorist attack or be grievously harmed by someone else—but also things like risky activities and how you approach your travels. The world is not as dangerous as you assume, but then again, having the right knowledge about a place is essential when you’re visiting conflict-adjacent places. These are some of the key risks, issues, and scams you should be aware of to stay safe in Jordan:\n\nKeep your belongings close.\n\nPickpocketing or bag snatching is fairly common, particularly in markets, where people are tightly packed. Keep your belongings secured and close while walking around, and use travel hacks like a carabiner that attaches your purse or backpack to your chair while eating.\n\nAlways negotiate for fair prices.\n\nLying and price-gouging are pretty normal anywhere there are tourists, so be aware that the main travel scams in Jordan revolve around ripping off tourists. That antique you buy might be a fake, local textiles might be made in China, and taxi drivers might take a circuitous route to your destination. And you’ll nearly always be quoted a price that’s higher than you should pay, so you’ll need to negotiate respectfully.\n\nNone of these things are unsafe, but they are something you should be aware of across all of Jordan, but particularly in the most touristy areas.\n\nAssess the safety risks for yourself.\n\nSafety standards are not as well enforced in Jordan as they are in many countries, meaning activities like diving in Aqaba are poorly regulated. Always use trusted tour operators when booking adventure activities, check your gear, and maintain awareness of the activity in question and other possible risks.\n\nWatch the weather.\n\nFlooding is possible during the November-March rainy season. If you’re renting a car or visiting the Jordan Valley, pay attention to government flood alerts to stay safe.\n\nUse safe transportation.\n\nBook a taxi through your hotel or use a ride-hailing app like Uber—these cars are in better condition and the drivers are safer and more reliable for all travelers, solo female travelers included.\n\nInsure your belongings."
