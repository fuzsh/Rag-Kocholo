There are several ways to handle spending while abroad, and the method you choose will depend on where you’re going, how long you’ll be there, your expected incidental budget, and the policies of your bank and/or credit card company. These tips will give you a starting point for things to research to figure out what is best for you.\n\nIf you are going to use your credit card or bank card:\n\nInform your bank before you travel. Let them know where you’re going and how long you’ll be there. This way they know not to be suspicious of international activity on your account.\n\nKnow the limitations of using card abroad.\n\nVisa and MasterCard are the most widely accepted cards. You may run into more difficulty using American Express or Discover, as they are not as widely accepted.\n\nIn some countries, it’s uncommon to pay by card at all, unless you are making large purchases. If this is the case where you are going, it’s good to have a credit card for emergencies, but plan on using cash for your day-to-day purchases.\n\nCarry some cash anyway. Have a few bills to use in case of emergency.\n\nIf you are going to use cash:\n\nBe familiar with exchange rates so you can stick to your budget.\n\nAvoid carrying large amounts of cash if possible, but if you decide to do so:\n\nDiversify the locations of your cash - don’t keep it all in one place.\n\nConsider using a money pouch or belt, which allow you to carry money out of sight under your clothes.\n\nNever let anyone see how much cash you are carrying.\n\nIf you use ATMs abroad, remember that you may be charged ATM fees and conversion fees every time you take money out.\n\nConsider converting a chunk of money before you leave. This could allow you to:\n\nTake advantage of favorable exchange rates before you leave. Exchange rates change over time, so they could be less favorable when you’re actually abroad.\n\nSave money in ATM fees.\n\nKeep to your budget by restricting your spending to the cash you took out.\n\n>Avoid converting money at airports if possible. Much like everything else at an airport, money conversion is much more expensive than at a non-airport location.\n\nKeeping in Touch\n\nRemember that it’s required for all Ohio University study abroad students to have access to a cell phone while abroad. Getting cell service while abroad can sometimes be tricky, so make sure you do your research and have a plan in place before you leave. Ask your program coordinator on onsite staff about which phone options or service providers are best for your chosen destination.\n\nSome programs that run in locations with limited cell service will provide a satellite phone for the duration of the trip. You will be notified if this is the case. *RARE*\n\nThere are a couple of options for phones and service abroad.\n\n(1) Use your current US phone.\n\nCheck with your US service provider.\n\nCheck with them to see what their international offerings are. Some providers like T-Mobile include international service in their regular plans.\n\nOther providers offer international plans as add-ons or as a day-by-day service. These can be really expensive, so make sure you know costs ahead of time so you don’t break your budget.\n\nOr, use a service provider in your host country.\n\nThis is done by replacing the SIM card in your phone with a SIM card from the service provider. You can only switch out a SIM card if your phone is “unlocked.” You can check with your cell service provider to see if your phone is unlocked or not.\n\nOnce you have a new SIM card, you can buy month-to-month data plans or top-up minutes.\n\n(2) Buy a phone in-country.\n\nSometimes you won’t be able to use your own US phone or it’s just more practical to use a local phone.\n\nBurner phones are inexpensive and an easy way to make sure you always have the ability to make a call.\n\nSome students will use a burner phone so that they can make calls, but still keep their own US smartphone to use with WiFi.\n\nf you choose to buy a phone abroad for cell service and bring your own phone to use on WiFi, there are some things to keep in mind.\n\nPut your phone on airplane mode so you don’t accidentally use international data.\n\nSome apps like Google Maps and Google Translate will let you download content to use offline. This can be very helpful if you’re in a country where you don’t speak the language.\n\nWhatsApp is a great texting app that uses WiFi and is also super popular in a lot of places outside the US. Facebook and iPhone-to-iPhone iMessage are also good options for WiFi-based texting\n\nTransportation\n\nIf you’re going to go abroad, you have to know how to get from here to there. Transportation to and from your host country may be included in your program, but if it’s not, you’re responsible for securing your own. Start searching right away so you can plan for dates and prices, but remember not to purchase any flights or transportation until you've been confirmed as a participant on the program.\n\nWhen searching ticket prices online, use your browser in incognito mode. Airline websites will use cookies to track what flights you’re looking at and start showing increased prices for those flights.\n\nBefore you go:\n\nUseful apps for flight purchase include:\n\nHopper\n\nSkyscanner\n\nSearch engines for cheap fares:\n\nKayak\n\nCheaptickets.com\n\nEdreams.com\n\nStudentuniverse.com * geared towards students!\n\nWhile you're away:\n\nDepending on your program length, you may have the opportunity to do your own travel while abroad. With just a little research you can find cheap and easy travel options.\n\nInter-city busses are often very budget-friendly options. Train travel is also much more common in other countries than in the US. It can be much more enjoyable and environmentally friendly than air travel as well. Some websites for train travel:\n\ngoeuro.com\n\nrome2rio.com\n\nIf you do want to travel by air while you are away, you might find discount airlines helpful:\n\nEurope: RyanAir, EasyJet\n\nSouth America: Mexicana, LAN Airlines\n\nAsia: Asia.com\n\nAccommodations\n\nYour program accommodations and your lodging choices while traveling are integral to a good program experience. Though they differ from program to program and from student to student, there are a few good things for everyone to keep in mind.\n\nThe majority of programs will have you living with another person to some degree. Though most of us already have experience living with roommates or siblings, here are some refresher tips for cohabitation:\n\nBe considerate. Whether you’re sharing a hotel room for a week or living with a host family for a semester, think about how your use of shared space affects the people you live with.\n\nCommunicate!\n\nIf something is bothering you or you have a question, speak up. A problem will never get solved if it’s never talked about.\n\nIf you are particular about certain things (e.g., you like to go to bed early, you get cold easily and like to keep your room warm, you have a bad snooze-button habit), tell your roommate about them as soon as possible so that you can head off a conflict before it happens.\n\nNOTE: If you’re having a problem you feel you can’t resolve on your own, speak to your onsite support. It’s important that you have a living space where you feel safe and comfortable.\n\nIf you are doing your own travel while abroad:\n\nYou’ll have the opportunity to arrange your own housing. Think about location, convenience, and safety as you plan.\n\nHostels are your best lodging resource away - they’re often cheap and numerous.\n\nHostels will most often have large all-gender rooms with bunk beds. You can usually find smaller or single-gender rooms at an additional cost.\n\nDo your research! The best way to avoid a hostel horror story is to secure all housing before you travel. It’s easy to find highly-rated, budget-friendly hostels with just a few minutes of research. Make sure to read the reviews.\n\nwww.hostels.com\n\nwww.hostelworld.com\n\nwww.hostelbookers.com\n\nMake sure the location of your lodging is safe! It also helps to know where you want to go within the city you’re visiting so you find a place to stay that’s close."
