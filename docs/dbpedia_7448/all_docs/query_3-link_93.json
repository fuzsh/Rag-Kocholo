        "text": "The more money you save on travel, the more places you get to visit! Sure, there are times when spending $4000 on a one week trip to Disneyland might be worth it. But for most people it can be more rewarding (and a healthier lifestyle balance) to take 4 x $1000 trips to explore different places, at different times throughout the year. Same money spent, but 4x more trips!\n\nIn this post we‚Äôre going to cover a huge range of tips and tricks that will allow you to save money on your next excursion. We‚Äôll attempt to cover every aspect, giving you the knowledge and resources that you can keep coming back to in order to save every single time you book travel in the future. Plus, check out top picks for the best credit cards for travel hacking!\n\n1) Travel during the off-season\n\nThe first tip to lowering travel costs is to go when everyone else isn‚Äôt going. When demand is high, supply is low, which means airlines, hotels, and popular tourist destinations can charge higher prices ‚Äì and get away with it!\n\nThis is, of course, harder to do for folks with kids. Maximizing those non-Summer school breaks is essential to saving money on a trip. Sometimes just traveling a few days before or after school break (and missing a couple days of school) can save you meaningful bucks and help you avoid peak travel costs. You‚Äôll may also want to find the best credit card for hotels too.\n\nShoulder Season Rules\n\nEver heard of ‚Äúshoulder season?‚Äù It‚Äôs the travel period between peak and off-peak seasons‚Ä¶ right in the middle when things are still open and the weather isn‚Äôt completely horrible. ü§£ This is applicable here in the states if you‚Äôre exploring our beautiful country, but it‚Äôs also true when you‚Äôre considering going abroad as well.\n\nVisiting your favorite European destination in the Summer will mean higher airfare, lodging, & car rental costs. (Plus dealing with all the crowds and other tourists). But traveling in April & October are typically the best months for a Euro vacation from a cost perspective. The weather can be just as nice and it will feel less packed.\n\nSo remember that seasonality has a big impact on costs when it comes to that booking. It‚Äôll save you hundreds of dollars ‚Äì maybe more.\n\n2) Book in advance, at the right time\n\nWhen you book your travel matters, specifically with flights. Booking at the right time can save you meaningful dollars. And I don‚Äôt mean buying on a Tuesday vs Friday. Studies have shown that you‚Äôll get the best deals on flights in these windows:\n\nInternational flights: Booking at least 6 months out.\n\nDomestic flights: You‚Äôll likely see the best deals 2-3 months in advance of your trip. (If you try to book a domestic trip 8 or 9 months in advance, fares are likely to be higher than they would be if you waited a bit longer)\n\nHoliday travel (like christmas, Thanksgiving): Travel experts pretty much say there‚Äôs no good time to book ‚Äì it‚Äôs basically always expensive due to high demand. So the earlier, the better.\n\nIt typically pays to be a planner. Here‚Äôs also a really detailed best times to book flights post from our buddy, Brian Kelly aka The Points Guy. It‚Äôs very thorough! The best airline credit cards will also have perks that can offset some costs whether you can book ASAP or have to take what you can get.\n\nUsing Airfare Alerts\n\nMany travel apps allow you to be notified when the price of a particular flight you‚Äôre planning to take experiences a price drop. These tips are really helpful, because airfares fluctuate quite a bit and sometimes snagging a last minute flight gets you a HUGE discount.\n\nGoogle Flights is probably the best airfare search tool on the market right now. They do a great job helping you see whether the price is solid (prompting you to book asap) or whether they might go down in the coming weeks. Google‚Äôs price graph and date grid are immensely helpful. It makes it crystal clear that by changing one of your travel dates you might be able to save a big chunk of money. Travel date flexibility is crucial to saving money.\n\nHere are some screenshots of those tools within Google Flights:\n\nOne of our listeners named Shannon also made this detailed step by step guide to Google flights that you might like and it‚Äôs full of other tips to save money on travel!\n\nSkiplagged is another site worth checking out. The airlines aren‚Äôt too fond of this site though, because they expose cheap deals called hidden city fares.\n\nAn example of this is: Let‚Äôs say you want to fly to Ohio, but all the flights are quite expensive. Well, Skiplagged might help you find a fare to NYC instead, with a layover in Ohio, at a cheaper total price than just a single flight to Ohio. On flying day, you just get off in Ohio and purposefully miss the second flight to NYC.\n\nKind of sneaky, but regardless, they are definitely worth checking out in order to get great deals.\n\n3) Prioritize the deal over the destination\n\nMy wife and I had always wanted to visit Norway. But we never planned a trip there because it was always so expensive. Then one day we got an alert that ticket prices dropped to $500 round trip! That price was too good to ignore. So we pounced on the deal. This was all thanks to some new cheap flight operators who had just launched in Scandinavia.\n\nIf we had forced that Norway trip before those fare drops we would have ended up paying at least $1,000 per ticket, drastically increasing the cost of our trip. Being patient and waiting for deals pays off. It‚Äôs the best way to see the world on the cheap, and gets you traveling more sporadically and spontaneously!\n\nPatience is a virtue when it comes to saving money on travel.\n\nCheap flight alerts can work on your behalf\n\nHere are a few sites we like for checking out worldwide cheap flights:\n\nKayak.com/explore is a great tool for seeing the best prices for destinations worldwide at a glance. It can really open your eyes to see neat places you might not have otherwise considered visiting. So pull that site up and start dreaming based on the lowest-cost places to fly.\n\nScott‚Äôs Cheap Flights & AirfareWatchdog are other sites worth bookmarking. If you‚Äôre a travel nut, signing up for the newsletter from Scott‚Äôs Cheap Flights is a must. That $49 can save you hundreds, or potentially even thousands on your next trip. Those newsletters can be another great tool to push you towards a destination you might not have considered based on an incredibly low fare that pops up.\n\nPro tip: Wherever you end up, make sure you always stay the weekend. If you include a Saturday night stay in your trip you are almost always going to save more money. Especially when traveling to Europe, you‚Äôll save a heck of a lot more if you travel Monday through Sunday instead of Monday through Friday. That‚Äôs because if you don‚Äôt stay the weekend, the airlines assume that you are a business traveler. And business travelers pay more. (Plus, who wants to go for just a few days anyway!)\n\n4) Consider regional airports\n\nThere‚Äôs no rule that says you must fly from the major airport closest to your house. Or in the case of Skiplagged that you actually have to make it to your booked destination either!\n\nDepending on where you‚Äôd like to fly to, it might be cheaper to drive a little bit to a regional airport (or another major city airport) in order to get the best deal. For example, some of the best flight deals to Europe come out of Chicago & New York. If you live in the Midwest and have family in Chicago, combine that trip with a chance to see them. It could drastically reduce the overall expense of that trip. Stubbornly attempting to book that European vacay from Birmingham, AL or Memphis, TN could end up costing you a whole lot more.\n\nAnd let‚Äôs say you really want to visit a super cool spot like Croatia in eastern Europe. You might find that ticket prices never (or at least rarely) go on sale. Instead, consider booking round-trip tickets to another European destination that frequently has cheap tickets (maybe London or Paris). There‚Äôs a good chance it‚Äôll be a heck of a lot cheaper to book travel on one of the Euro discount airlines to your eastern European destination from a bigger western European city.\n\nRome2Rio can help you find cheaper ways to get around Europe too. Breaking up our trip into multiple bookings gives you better chances of finding multiple local deals.\n\n5) Consider the overall trip cost, not just cheap flights\n\nIt‚Äôs more expensive to get to Thailand than it is to get to San Francisco from most places. But San Francisco is an expensive city to hang out in. Even though the flight might be cheaper, there‚Äôs a good chance the overall trip cost will become more expensive after chilling in the Bay Area for a few weeks vs. doing the same in Thailand.\n\nThis is where a travel budget comes in handy. It forces you take into account all of the trip costs like flights, accommodation, food, activities, etc so you know which places actually end up cheaper on an all-in basis.\n\nAnd if you‚Äôre looking for great ideas for ways to stretch your dollar at a particular destination, TripAdvisor is an awesome website you really need to spend time on. What Yelp did for helping you find a good restaurant, TripAdvisor did for helping you find the diamond in the rough boutique hotel that isn‚Äôt all that expensive! There‚Äôs a treasure trove of information mostly coming from fellow travelers helping others replicate their top-notch experiences.\n\nAll in all, if you only focus on saving money on one aspect of the trip (like only prioritizing that cheap flight) you might end up spending much more in other areas. While flights are often the most expensive part of your trip, other factors matter too.\n\n6) Watch out for hidden fees\n\nSpeaking of the overall cost of your trip, be aware of fees. The lowest price ticket might not mean the lowest overall price. That‚Äôs because different airlines have different fee structures. Baggage, re-printing a boarding, taxes, etc can all hit you unexpectedly and screw up your original flight deal.\n\nSouthwest is an awesome airline, committing to tamping down fees. Google Flights doesn‚Äôt list Southwest fares so be sure to check them separately if they fly out of your home airport. They have no checked baggage fees on the first two bags you bring on board. That could be a huge savings in and of itself! (And it‚Äôs perfect if you want to bring some tasty beers back from your trip üòâ).\n\nSouthwest also doesn‚Äôt play the change fee game. If you need to change your dates after booking you‚Äôll only pay for the additional fare costs ‚Äì if there are any. Need to change dates with Delta? It‚Äôs typically $200!! OUCH.\n\nAirbnb recently made a cool addition to their search platform. In December 2022 they launched ‚Äútotal price display‚Äù, so their listings will now include ALL the fees (like cleaning and stuff). This makes it easier to compare rentals apples to apples, and not get surprised by silly little fees that show up when you‚Äôre ready to check out. This is also a good time to mention to make sure you have a travel credit card with no foreign transaction fees when traveling aboard so you aren‚Äôt charged for spending oversees.\n\nBottom line: Fully research the cheap airlines and hotels before you book. Hidden fees are annoying, but sadly a common reality!\n\n7) Shop rental car options\n\nRental car prices have been abnormally high in recent months. We can largely thank Covid for that.. As we talked about with Clark Howard recently, where you fly should partially be determined by rental car costs on the ground ‚Äì at least for the time being.\n\nAlways make a refundable car reservation immediately upon booking your flight with one of the major rental companies. After that, you should be shopping rates as you get closer to your trip.\n\nOne excellent way to have someone else do that shopping for you is AutoSlash. They have collectively saved car rental customers more than $100 million on travel costs! The average savings is around 30% as compared to other websites. Check them out for sure.\n\nYou‚Äôll want to consider Turo right now too. You could save more by renting a car from an individual, Airbnb style, instead of renting from one of the major car rental companies. These car share companies are blowing up right now and are very reliable. But again, check the fees before completing your booking!\n\n8) Choose flexible and refundable lodging\n\nWhere you book lodging matters a lot when it comes to saving money. Similar to booking a rental car, booking a refundable room can be the best first step.\n\nHotelTonight is one of the best sites for last-minute lodging deals. But Priceline & Hotwire are the two best overall sites for booking a hotel room, in our opinion. Priceline used to have a bidding tool which made deals easier to find, but they‚Äôve axed that feature on their platform.\n\nSometimes, it actually makes sense to book via a hotel directly. For the longest time this wasn‚Äôt the case ‚Äì third-party sites were far superior when it came to save money on travel hotels. But that isn‚Äôt as true now as it once was. These hotels are realizing that they need to price competitively.\n\nSo if you want a specific hotel, check the rate on their site too. For example, Marriott has a best rate guarantee. If you find a lower rate & submit a claim form they will give you an additional 25% off!\n\nAnd sometimes it helps to just pick up the phone with a hotel. You might get some helpful info about what sort of other discounts are available that might be difficult to find on the website. Hotel front desks and operators are also great for sourcing local cheap activities! Here‚Äôs a guide on asking for discounts if you feel nervous üòâ\n\nAgain, TripAdvisor is a site worth looking at before booking lodging too. Especially if you‚Äôre looking to book a smaller, boutique hotel you can get some really helpful reviews and ranking from that site.\n\n9) Sometimes, travel agents can save you money\n\nI know what you‚Äôre thinking‚Ä¶ Since travel agents get a commission for booking your travel, usually you pay a higher cost. But, in some circumstances it can be worth hiring someone to help you plan and book your trip, especially if you‚Äôre going in a large group or taking a lengthy trip that includes a plethora of planes, trains, and automobiles.\n\nThat being said, you‚Äôll want to know how that person gets paid specifically. If they say that you don‚Äôt have to pay them a dime, it means they are making commissions from the vendors they work with. You might still end up with the best deal. But knowing the payment structure up-front is important.\n\nTravelSense.org is a site worth checking if you feel like you need the help of a travel expert.\n\n10) Vacation packages can be cheaper\n\nBooking a complete vacation package can be a good way to get a bundled travel discount. Some operators offer the flight, car, hotel, and sometimes even all-inclusive food into bundles that are cheaper than if all the elements were paid for separately.\n\nCostcoTravel is one of the better places to turn for a vacation package if you‚Äôre interested in booking a trip without having to plan everything. If you‚Äôre a Costco member it might be worth checking to see what they offer before you start to piecemeal your own trip together. Also Executive Members may get additional discounts!!!\n\nNo planning + save money on travel = double win!!\n\n11) Don‚Äôt forget travel insurance\n\nDepending on what‚Äôs going on in your life, travel insurance is a purchase that could end up saving you a LOT of money in the unfortunate event you have to cancel your trip. Make sure to shop for travel insurance at a third-party site ‚Äì don‚Äôt get it on the airline‚Äôs website while you‚Äôre booking your tickets (it‚Äôs more expensive there).\n\nSites like SquareMouth and InsureMyTrip are great for getting your own policy. Look at the fine print and make sure that your policy will cover any possible reasons for cancellation. The worst place to be stuck in is when you can‚Äôt go on a trip yet your policy doesn‚Äôt cover your specific reason for canceling.\n\nBut you might not even have to pay out of pocket for trip insurance. Some of our favorite travel rewards credit cards offer it as a free perk.\n\n12) Use the right travel rewards credit card\n\nBooking a big trip can be the perfect time to add a new credit card into your life. You can take advantage of a sweet welcome rewards offer (because you‚Äôre about to drop a decent chunk on that card) PLUS earn a ton of rewards via specific airline or hotel programs.\n\n(Of course, you‚Äôll need to have the cash on hand to pay that balance off in full when the bill comes) But that new card can allow you to travel for free or much cheaper.\n\nTravel credit cards can also offer other benefits that you might not have considered, like rental car insurance, zero foreign transaction fees, free lounge access, TSA pre-check status for free, and much more. So definitely put your trip expenses on a credit card for those perks, but only if you have the cash to pay off the full balance.\n\nCredit cards also make for the best method of payment while you are overseas. Make sure that the card you take with you has a 0% foreign transaction fee so you‚Äôre not paying extra every time you use it!\n\nRelated posts and tools:\n\nHow to travel cheaply using credit card rewards\n\nTravel Credit Card Search Tool\n\nBest Airport Lounge Access Credit Cards\n\n13) Extending your trip could lower the cost per day\n\nAnother way to save money on travel is to go on a longer trip! This might seem counterintuitive but hear us out. (We also talked about this on the podcast with with Nomadic Matt)\n\nOnce you‚Äôve decided how much you should spend on travel, consider extending your trip to get more bang for your buck. Longer trips can definitely help you save money, by reducing your per-day rate and maximizing the value. Again, this doesn‚Äôt work for everyone‚Äôs schedule, and not everyone wants to travel like this. But when one round-trip plane ticket allows you to explore an entire country or region by spending 3 weeks or a month there, it‚Äôll lower the cost per day dramatically.\n\nAnd let‚Äôs say you want to book an Airbnb, that makes even more sense if you stay for a longer time period. Discounts are often substantial when you book for a month instead of a week.\n\n14) Deals for Cruises\n\nIf you‚Äôre a fan of cruises, CruiseCompete is probably the best site for comparing multiple cruise agencies and getting a good deal.\n\nCruiseCritic is another great site if you‚Äôre trying to get educated about taking a cruise. The best time to get a cruise is typically the period between Thanksgiving & Christmas. You might even want to consult a travel agent if it is your first time booking a cruise so that you make sure that you are able to get the experience that you‚Äôre looking for.\n\n15) Listen to the travel experts!\n\nWe‚Äôve been lucky enough to interview several travel experts on our show. Some of them are just thrifty world travelers with years of experience. Others have built companies and services to help others save money on travel.\n\nHere are the podcast episodes you might be interested in:\n\nNavigating the New Era of Cheap Travel with Scott Keyes (Scott is the founder of Scott‚Äôs Cheap Flights!)\n\nTravel LOTS, on LITTLE with Nomadic Matt (Matt‚Äôs the guy behind NYT best-selling book ‚ÄúHow to Travel the World on $50 a Day‚Äù\n\nUsing Credit Cards for $50k in Free Travel with Brad Barrett (Brad‚Äôs from the Choose FI team!)\n\nJet-Setting for Little to No Money with Brian Kelly (Brian is The Points Guy ‚Äì a huge cheap travel site about maximizing your travel rewards)\n\nMoney, Van Life, and Alternative Living (with Chris and Christy from Life Opted Out) We talk about free camp sites, cheap recreational parks and activities and a bunch of other road travel tips!\n\nHopefully this litany of travel tips will help you save money the next time you attempt to book your next getaway. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that being company loyal is going to cost you. If you only fly one specific airline or are only willing to stay at a particular hotel chain, it‚Äôs going to be a whole lot harder to save money on your trip.\n\nFlexibility is crucial in order to save money on travel, and that includes the companies you do business with.\n\nCheers, and happy traveling!"
