        "text": "Other Things to See and Do in Italy\n\n1. Party at the Venice Carnival\n\nCarnival is ten days of masquerade madness every February leading up to Mardi Gras. The tradition goes back centuries, starting in the 12th century and reaching the height of popularity in the 18th century. Today, it’s one of the biggest festivals in Italy, with millions of people attending every year. Though it’s too crowded for my taste, the iconic and diverse masks are a central part of the festivities and every year there is a contest for the most beautiful mask. If you want to splash out, you can even attend a traditional masquerade ball! Just be sure to book your accommodation early as the city fills up months in advance.\n\n2. Explore Milan\n\nMilan is the fashion capital of Italy. Spend some time taking in the glamor but don’t spend more than a day or two here unless you’re looking to splash out. While you’re here, don’t miss the beautiful Milan Cathedral, which boasts 3,500 statues, 135 spires, and five bronze doors. Sforzesco Castle, a 15th-century castle that houses Michelangelo’s last sculpture, is also worth a visit. There’s also Leonardo da Vinci’s The Last Supper, located inside Santa Maria delle Grazie church (which is itself a UNESCO World Heritage Site) as well as Leonardo’s Horse, one of the largest equine statues in the world. To get away from the crowds, spend some time relaxing in Parco Sempione, Milan’s most famous city park. It’s a vast oasis of green space and perfect for a picnic when the weather is nice.\n\n3. See the Leaning Tower in Pisa\n\nThe entire city of Pisa is focused on taking photos of this famed tower. Started in 1173 and finished in 1399, it’s the bell tower of Pisa’s cathedral, located next door. Although it was meant to be perfectly vertical, the tower started leaning during construction due to the weight of the building on an unstable foundation. Most people come for the tower, but I find the entire complex to be stunning! The white marble buildings of the Baptistry and the Duomo are equally impressive but don’t get the same attention as the tower. They’re worth a visit. Admission to the top is 20 EUR or 27 EUR for a ticket that includes all the monuments in the complex. DiscoveryPisa runs a guided tour of all three sites for 40 EUR if you want a more in-depth experience.\n\n4. Visit Siena\n\nEveryone who visits Siena walks away loving it. Located in Tuscany, it’s one of the best-preserved medieval cities in Italy and boasts a labyrinth of lanes gathered around the arena of Piazza del Campo. Spend a few days admiring this charming city and exploring one of Italy’s most popular and famous regions. The main draw to the city is the stunning Siena Cathedral, which was constructed with white and black marble and is one of the most beautiful cathedrals in the country (the interior is massive and ornately decorated and lined by huge columns). Be sure to also visit the Torre del Mangia, a narrow 14th-century tower that offers stunning views of the area, as well as the 14th-century Fonte Gaia fountain, which is decorated by centuries-old marble panels.\n\n5. Wander Naples\n\nNaples, made famous as the birthplace of pizza, is a gritty city home to a wealth of historical treasures. There’s the medieval Naples Cathedral, the 18th-century Villa Comunale Park, and nearby Naples, Pompeii, one of the most amazing and important sites to visit in the country. The Archaeological Museum of Naples is also worth a visit, and if you enjoy hiking you can climb up the iconic Mount Vesuvius. Naples is the gateway to the south so you’re very likely to come here if you’re crisscrossing the country. Its location near Pompeii, Capri, and Sorrento makes it the perfect starting point for exploring the region. Best of all, it’s a foodie city like no other; I ate my weight in pizza during my visit!\n\n6. Explore Florence\n\nThere’s no real need to explain why one should visit Florence — the city speaks for itself. Everything people say about it is true: great food, amazing museums, ancient buildings, small streets, awesome gelato. The city has it all. Be sure to visit The Uffizi, which holds the world’s most important collection of Renaissance art (including the The Birth of Venus and La Primavera by Botticelli, Bacchus by Caravaggio, and Doni Tondo by Michelangelo). The famous David statue is also in Florence, housed in the Galleria dell’Accademia. It’s one of the most impressive sculptures in the world and at 5.17 meters (17 feet) tall, it’s a lot bigger and more detailed than you think it would be! While here, make sure you take a few wine tours throughout the region to get a feel for the verdant countryside. Don’t miss the view from the highest point in the Piazzale Michelangelo. It was my favorite and well worth the hike to get there.\n\n7. Drive around “the Heel”\n\nFew travelers ever visit the southern heel of the Italian “boot.” But, if you have time, it’s worth the trip. This is where most of the fruits and vegetables in Italy come from so a trip down here will give you the best glimpse into rustic Italian life far from the maddening crowds of Rome and Italy’s other tourist hotspots. Don’t miss the picturesque Polignano a Mare, with its rugged cliffs and white-washed houses. Gallipoli, with its labyrinth of narrow lanes and historic port, is also worth visiting. There are tons of amazing beaches in this part of the country too, including Marina di Pescoluse (Salento), Cala Porto (Polignano a Mare), and Torre Guaceto (Brindisi).\n\n8. Eat your way around Sicily\n\nThere’s Italian culture and then there’s Sicily. Sicily has its own unique cooking style, traditions, and customs. It’s unlike the rest of Italy. Be sure to spend some time in Taormina and Palermo (the capital of Sicily). The UNESCO Valley of the Temples is also in Sicily, a national park home to incredible Greek ruins that are over 2,000 years old. Don’t miss the stunning Mount Etna, an active volcano that you can ski on it in the winter or take a tour of the top in the summer.\n\n9. Stroll through Sorrento\n\nSorrento is a small city in southwestern Italy surrounded by a dreamy landscape of rolling hills, deep valleys, and the Lattari Mountains. There’s not a lot to do in the town itself but Sorrento makes an ideal starting point for numerous excursions to nearby cities and islands around the famous Amalfi Coast, like Capri and Ischia. I especially love driving along the winding coastal roads overlooking the sea. Don’t miss a visit to the nearby Blue Grotto.\n\n10. Attend Settimana Santa (Holy Week)\n\nThis is the last week of Lent, known as Holy Week. During this time, there are several processions throughout Italy, drawing crowds of thousands. Throughout the week, there are various gatherings in Puglia, Abruzzo, and Sicily but the major event occurs on Easter Sunday and is led by the Pope himself. It’s an amazing time to visit, but expect huge crowds and for accommodation to sell out months in advance.\n\n11. Visit Alberobello\n\nA UNESCO World Heritage Site, this is an interesting and picturesque little town just south of Bari (a port city on the Adriatic Sea) known for its unusual white cone-shaped houses (they’re super peculiar). It’s well worth a visit between the months of November and April (to avoid the flocks of tourists) as there are a couple of museums to peruse, in addition to some great restaurants, bars, and markets.\n\n12. Tour the Vatican Museums\n\nFounded in the early 16th century, it is a complex of museums spanning over 12 acres. There are so many priceless highlights, including Michelangelo’s works in the Sistine Chapel. You could easily spend hours here so don’t rush your visit. Consider getting a guide to make the museum come to life and give you some context and history of what you are seeing. Admission is 20 EUR and skip-the-line guided tours with Get Your Guide start around 40 EUR.\n\n13. See Chiesa di Sant’Efisio\n\nWhen you find yourself in Cagliari on Sardinia, wander over to the Stampace quarter to see this church. Dedicated to the patron Saint Ephisius, this is the most important church in the city. The original building dates to the 13th century, though it was rebuilt and expanded in the 16th century and then again in the 18th century, this time in the Baroque style. Admission is free.\n\n14. Take a cooking class\n\nItaly is a dream destination for foodies and the best way to learn about this amazing cuisine is to take a cooking class. You’ll get to visit a local market, learn about the history of some of the country’s best dishes, and then learn how to make them yourself so you can impress friends and family back home. You can find cooking classes all over the country. They are very common. Prices vary depending on what city you take a class in, but most cost at least 40 EUR and last a few hours.\n\n15. Take a walking tour\n\nWalks of Italy offers incredible, detailed tours all around the country. They are my favorite tour company in the country. And they are relatively inexpensive and you definitely get your money’s worth. If you are big into history, culture, or architecture these tours are for you. You’ll walk away with a much richer understanding of the country. Don’t miss them.\n\nFor information on specific cities in Italy, check out these city guides:"
