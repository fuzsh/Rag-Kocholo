        "text": "WHY TO COMPARE\n\nWhat is the secret of a perfect trip? Each traveler has their own response to this question: some people want to see as many attractions as possible, others want to relax without any sightseeing, some people are looking for cheap travel options, others prefer luxury vacations. Each journey is like a little different life, and of course, we want this life to be bright, exciting, and unforgettable.\n\n​\n\n​Planning the trip is one of the most amazing but challenging parts of each journey. Even if you are not planning anything incredible, like having five tours a day or visiting 10 Italian cities for 5 days, you will still need to book the tickets, find hotels, or think of places you want to see.\n\n​\n\n​Some options allow travelers to make trip planning easier. For example, you could always contact a travel agency for help. This approach has a lot of advantages: professionals who know the region you are going to go to could book tickets and hotels for you, organize transfers, and recommend the best local guides and experiences. An organized vacation could be even cheaper than a self-planned one, especially in cost/quality ratio.\n\n​\n\nTravel agency’s offers don’t always fit your needs. You are the only one who knows what you want to see. And let’s not forget that trip planning is an excellent part of the trip itself: it requires research, imagination, and a strong willingness to build an incredible journey. A trip you plan is something that you might be proud of someday, sharing your own travel tips with your friends and family who were not lucky enough to join you on that trip. Here we come to the main point of this article - we want to take a close look at trip planners that are already used by travelers today.​\n\n​\n\nTriptile is an online trip planner that helps travelers choose hotels, connections, activities, add transfers, and book all of this in one place. All the traveler has to do is to choose destinations, indicate the number of travelers, and select the start date of his trip. After that Triptile will automatically generate an itinerary with the best hotels, most popular activities, and convenient transfer options. The user can moderate the offered itinerary - add or remove nights, change hotels, select other activities or set of activities (day programs). Hotels offered by Triptile are the best options in terms of cost/service. Activities are organized by the local guides which in most cases guarantees a unique experience.\n\nHere are top 10 advantages of Triptile:\n\n1. Customized Itineraries: You can create personalized itineraries based on your preferences and interests.\n\n2. Ease of Use: The website is user-friendly, and the interface is intuitive, making it easy for you to navigate through the site.\n\n3.

Single Terms & Conditions for Whole Trip Booking with Triptile means that if your plans change, you won't have to reach out to every single travel supplier (hotel, activities, transportation) to cancel each reservation, as there is only one Terms & Conditions/Cancelation Policy for your whole trip.​\n\nTriptile is a unique website that helps you book everything in one place, and tailor your trip to your taste, due to its selection of hand-picked service options. We recommend using Triptile if you want to save time, stop scouring the Internet and just book all services in one place.\n\nRome2rio is a great trip planning tool that allows you to build a travel route “from door to door”. The greatest feature of the website is that it will show detailed information on connection, including the transport type (busses, trains, planes, ferries, etc.), hours on the road and approximate prices. After you choose the best solution. the app will redirect to their partner, Omio.com, where you can book your tickets.\n\nRome2Rio also cooperates with Booking.com and Rental cars, so the user will be redirected to an appropriate website to book a hotel or a car.\n\n​\n\nRome2Rio is the best planner for routes, it is a reliable source of information and an irreplaceable assistant when you need to find the best connection. If you need to plan a route, we would definitely suggest using Rome2Rio.​\n\nTripAdvisor is the most popular travel planner app. All you need to use is to choose the city you plan your visit to, and it will show you the best restaurants, attractions, and hotels with real users' stories, photos, and videos.\n\n​TripAdvisor allows travelers to share their own experiences, encourages them to tell more about the places they've visited, allows them to ask questions in multiple forums. Besides that, it is a great place to book hotels, flight tickets, and shopping options.\n\nThe website allows you to read about and book the chosen service, for example, a hotel. It will redirect the user to the partner website (for instance, Booking.com), where the traveler can finish his booking. The same applies to flights or tours.\n\nTripadvisor is an excellent source of information, based on user experience, about services worldwide, and it is definitely helpful when you are planning a trip. We highly recommend using Tripadvisor if you want to learn more about what to do, where to stay, and how to get there. ​\n\nTripIt is a popular iOS and Android app that helps to keep the travel schedule in one place. The app also allows you to add business meetings, events and as a result, make sure your whole trip is under control with the help of your mobile phone.\n\nThe service is integrated with Google Calendar, which allows users to share plans with friends and partners. Integration with Google Maps helps to navigate during the trip, which is convenient in unfamiliar locations or the places when the locals don’t speak your language - all you need is to show them a location in the app. Besides the navigation, the app shows nearby places and provides information about neighbourhood safety.\n\nTripIt offers two versions of the app - TripIt and TripIt Pro, the upgraded version has even more great features, such as check-in reminders, real-time flight alerts, luggage claims alerts.\n\nTripIt is a perfect trip organizer that helps the user to keep track of each part of his journey. We recommend to use Triplt when you are planning a really intense trip.\n\nRoadtrippers is a road trip planner that helps to build a perfect road trip and find well-known attractions, beautiful sightseeings, useful travel tips - best accommodations, restaurants, gas stations. The website is mostly used in North America, Australia, and New Zealand. The app is synchronized with GPS -navigation and allows tracking the road situation.\n\nThe Roadtrippers app also allows sharing the route with friends or family.\n\nRoadtrippers is a great trip planner for building road trips. If you are planning a road trip in the USA or Canada, Roadtrippers will be of great assistance.\n\nVisit a City is a trip planner that helps to find the most popular tourist attractions, to check how far they are from each other, and to figure out how long you should spend visiting this specific attraction. The user can choose a destination, find a collection of activities or filter them by duration, rating and price, and the website will offer tours that meet the stated criteria. Another great feature is if you indicate the exact date of your trip, the app will show you what attractions will be closed at that time. If you set the duration of your trip to four days, for example, the website will offer a detailed day-by-day travel plan with the approximate time that is needed to get from one place of interest to another one.\n\nThe user can add their own hotel, desired start time and the website will build the most convenient itinerary with the most popular attractions. After the itinerary is ready, the user can download or print it.\n\nVisit a City is a great service helping to combine the most popular activities. We highly recommend Visit a City if you are limited time-wise, but want to cover as many attractions as possible."
