        "text": "* Challenge yourself with an ascent to the summit of the iconic Mont Pelee (1327m)\n\n* Discover Martinique's flora and fauna with a certified mountain leader\n\n* Enjoy the stunning views on the Atlantic and the Caribbean Sea\n\nJoin us on this one-day Mount Pelée (1397 meters) ascent in Martinique and reach the top of this iconic volcano!\n\nMartinique Island is located in the eastern Caribbean Sea and is one of the eighteen regions of France. Famous for its networks of hiking trials, Martinique is every hiker’s paradise!\n\nMount Pelée is the highest volcano on the island. It last erupted in 1902 and was one of the worst volcanic disasters of the century. At 1397 meters, this mountain offers breathtaking views on both the Atlantic and the Caribbean sides of the island and, on a very clear day, you may even get to see the neighbouring island of Dominique!\n\nMy proposal is to ascend this amazing volcano through its steep rock trail, starting from the rainforest all the way to the top. The whole trip to the summit takes 6-7 hours (round trip) and vertical gain is around 800m, so take into account that a very good physical condition is mandatory.\n\nKeep in mind that hiking in the tropics can get really hot, that’s why we strongly recommend you bring 3L of water to keep hydrated along the way. And don’t forget some comfortable hiking shoes and sun screen!\n\nIf you wish to do this one-day Mount Pelée guided ascent, request to book this trip! We’ll be happy to have you join us."
