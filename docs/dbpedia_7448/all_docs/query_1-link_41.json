        "text": "If the worst comes to the worst, you simply go to a ticket window at the railway station in Florence, with a clearly written list of the travel legs you need for two persons, and you can reserve Florence to Verona to Milan there. You will pay full price, but it looks you are late enough to look on Trenitalia web site for discounted tickets. Do not wait to do this at the last time, you can go any time, as long as the exact dates you need are clearly written. Even a travel agency in Florence could do.\n\nRemember that Aug. 15th is a big holiday in Italy so expect many services to be closed.\n\nAs for the missing link, the most natural choice would be a Swiss place like Geneva, being Switzerland sandwiched between Italy and France. But the two main railway lines to France (via Modane and via Brig) are partially or totally closed for renovation, Switzerland is expensive as hell, so I would look for a place where you can buy a cheap flight to Paris - also for this you are very late. Maybe Torino. Or choose any place in Europe with cheap flights, for example Munich. Or a cheap flight to a French destination like Bordeaux or Toulose when you can go to Paris by train. What you would really need is some mountain place to get a pause, as Firenze, Verona and Milan will be quite hot, but by reserving Milan you have somewhat locked yourself..\n\nThe train app you want for Italy is the Trenitalia app. It is very easy to use. Both of you will want it on your phone, and you can just purchase your train tickets on it. Florence is “Firenze”. Milan is “Milano”.\n\nFor your location between Milan & Paris, would you consider just taking an Easy Jet flight of 90 minutes between the two cities for less than $50/ea.? If so, you could place your extra days at one of the Italian lakes, such as staying at Stresa on Lake Maggiore or at Lake Como - both relaxing!. OR, for more of a French feel to your trip, once you arrive at Paris, take the train to Chartres, Rouen, or Tours/Amboise in the Loire Valley to enjoy the chateaus. Chartres & Rouen have amazing night free light shows projected onto the face of the main cathedral. Everything I am suggesting is a short distance to try to maximize your “fun time”. I always reserve my hotels through Booking.com. Just filter on what you want, such as “8+ rating, hotel, less than a mile from the center” for instance.\n\nThe trains in France are the SNCF, but just buy a ticket at the station to keep it simple once you arrive.\n\nAre you frazzled in the planning or are you frazzled over the hassle of changing destinations? Have you considered just training from Milan to Paris and spending from the 21st-27th in Paris? As planned now, you have just three nights in Paris. By extending that stay, you reduce the number of changes you have to make and you have solved the frazzle of deciding where to go and how to get there. Plus, it would be a good amount of time in Paris. I read that you have an airb&b locked in. Okay, no problem. Find yourself a hotel for the other nights. Anyway, I can tell you that the train from Milan to Paris is a long ride, but you have to consider it part of the experience.\n\nChecking the Trenitalia website, a route from Milan to Paris would be leaving Milano Centrale at 8:00 by bus to Lausanne, changing there to a TGV to Paris Gare de Lyon. Arriving at 5:45 in the afternoon. Checking the SBB (Swiss train) website, you could leave Milano Centrale at 9:10 on a Eurocity train, changing in Zurich, arriving in Paris on the TGV train at 6:45 pm. That might be the better choice as the first route involves a coach bus. Oh, wait, that Eurocity train out of Milan is sold out on August 21. Nevertheless, check the SBB website for other options Milan to Paris.\n\nAlternatively, going to Nice after Milan would break the journey to Paris. Each leg of that trip looks to be at least 5 hours on the train. Milan to Nice, and then Nice to Paris on another day. Remember that the beach is Nice is going to be rocky/pebbles. Any time on the Mediterranean is great.\n\nWelcome Paula!\n\nAt this late date and your frazzled state I would not attempt to change your itinerary as you have it. Can you just head to Paris from Milan- cheap flight as noted above- and add some days to Paris w/day trips? You can never have enough time in Paris!\n\nYou've only got 3 nights to fill - which is just 2 full days of \"being there\". To me- not worth all the time and trouble to stop somewhere en route. Train from Milan to Paris will take a full day.\n\nI do like Jean's suggsestion of visiting Stresa after Milan if you don't want more time in Paris. You can take the airport bus back to MXP to catch a cheap flight to Paris. (Unless flight is out of Linate- again didn't look)\n\nKeep it simple is my advice.\n\nYou asked for advice on trains so changing your itinerary at this point is probably not something you need to attempt.\n\nAssuming you have lodging booked in Florence as well as Verona and Milan?\n\nFor your Italian trains\n\nGo to Trenitalia site and set up you account, this is easier to do on a desktop computer than on the app/device.\n\nDownload their easy to use app- and both of you should have it (again as noted above).\n\nPurchase your tickets and print them out at home or make sure they are in your email. You can screenshot them as well so you know you will have access to them in case the internet is lousy at stations/on trains. (This is why I like to have hard copies- old school peace of mind)\n\nYour station names are:\n\nFirenze SM Novella\n\nVerona Porta Nuova\n\nMilano Centrale\n\nYou will be taking direct (no changes) fast trains-frecciarossa- those come with the mandatory seat selection and there is no need to validate as they are only for the train/time you picked.\n\nI didn't look as I don't know your exact dates- but there may not even be any discounted tickets left so just purchase Base Rate tickets- that would be the same if you waited til in Italy purchase at the station.\n\nTrenitalia Official site\n\nhttps://www.trenitalia.com/content/tcom/en.html\n\nrome2rio is a fun tool to check transit options but it is not completely accurate and you can't really purchase tix on that site.\n\nLet us know if you need more help with anything\n\nI would like to help you with Milan to Paris via Switzerland in a scenic and relaxing way. It looks like you have 3 nights to spend on the way. Here is what I would suggest:\n\nOption 1: train from Milano Centrale to Lugano, a short ride away. Overnight in Lugano and enjoy the lake.. Next day take the Gotthard Panorama Express train plus boat combination to Luzern. This involves a scenic train (in First Class) to Flüelen on the southern end of Vierwaldstättersee (aka Lake Lucerne). There you transfer to a boat for beautiful and relaxing 3-hour ride up the lake to Luzern. Stay 2 nights here (or, if you prefer, a lakeside town nearby.\n\nhttps://www.sbb.ch/en/leisure-holidays/trains-boats/panorama-trains/gotthard-panorama-express.html\n\nFrom Luzern there are trains to Paris in about 5 hours, with a single change at Basel. Buy the whole journey on SBB.ch to make it simple.\n\nOption 2: Similar, but his option has you going to Locarno, another lakeside Swiss city, from Milan. Overnight here (there are hotels on the lake right close to the train station). I checked as see that this hotel, where we are booked in September, has a double room with lakeview available on 21 August.\n\nhttps://www.hotelgeranio.ch/en/\n\nNext day you take the Treno Gottardo train over the same tracks as the Gotthard Panorama train above, but in a less expensive 2d class. The train goes directly to Luzern with no changes. But if you like the boat option, you can leave the train at Flűelen and walk to the nearby boat dock for the ride up the lake to Luzern.\n\nhttps://unterwegs.sob.ch/de/stories/ciao-ticino-en\n\nTwo nights in Luzern or nearby, then the train to Paris as above.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nAnd now some help with trains.\n\nBut first, Verona. If you have not booked lodging there, look at Pepita Lodge, a good budget-friendly option on the tree-lined Main Street between the train station and Piazza Brá. It is outside the city walls (which makes it less expensive) but a short walk away (5 minutes). It appears they have 1 room left for your dates.\n\nhttp://www.pepitalodge.it/en/\n\nWith Verona booked, you can go ahead and buy train tickets. From Florence to Verona and Verona to Milan, you take high-speed trains and do not need to worry about “validation” which has been mentioned above. I suggest using Italo, a private train company with only fast trains between major cities, as the website is more user-friendly than Trenitalia. Also they have budget-friendly prices, including “2 for 1” pricing on some trains.\n\nhttps://www.italotreno.com/en\n\nI like to buy these tickets at home in advance, so I can print out a paper copy of the tickets as well as have a digital copy on my phone. (I have already done this for some of our September trains in Italy, and will be buying the rest later today).\n\nIf you decide to take my suggestion above to head to Luzern as your Switzerland stop on your way to Paris, I suggest you use the Swiss rail site to buy Milano Centrale to Lugano or Locarno, then from there to Luzern, and from Luzern to Paris.\n\nhttps://www.sbb.ch/en\n\nThree separate transactions, all can be done as a “guest” if you don’t want to creat a SwissPass account. Again, I like to print out the ticket at home as well as keep a digital copy (or screenshot thereof) on my phone.\n\nGood luck and come back with any questions. It will not seem so difficult once you get started. I sounds like a great trip you have planned, and a good way to celebrate her completion of law school and the bar exam. I know all too well how stressful that is. I think I spent the first couple of days after the bar exam in bed with a migraine!!!\n\nI am so thankful for all the advice and input. You guys are amazing! I wish I had found this forum back in May when I booked my flights and started planning this trip! I can only imagine how many sleepless nights I would have saved myself!\n\nWe originally wanted to go to Lucerne and actually booked an airbnb, but I backed out when I could not figure out how to get from Lucerne to Paris on the 24th (again wish I would have known about this forum)\n\nI talked to my daughter and told her about all the suggestions and here is what we have decided to do so far (whoever said to stick with close to our original plan in order to reduce stress was right.. she started panicking when I suggested we make any major changes)\n\n14-18 Florence\n\n18-21 Verona\n\n20-21 Milan (this is one we can’t change)\n\n21-24 Nice\n\n24-27 Paris (this is one we can’t change)\n\nNice will give her some beach time and seems to break up the trip to Paris.\n\nWe started looking at trains and now I’m wondering if a Europass would work for us? If I’m reading it right we could use a 5 day pass and all these places would work for it. She’s 25 so she’s still considered a youth.\n\nDo you guys think a europass would help us or am I missing something? Will it go to the cities we need or do they only give you limited time choices etc with those kind of passes?\n\nWe are going to work on this all day until it’s completed tours and all. I didn’t want to stress her but when I mentioned there were options left .. I could tell she was on high alert. I want to just finalized the trains, and as many tours as we can today and be done.\n\nI’m thinking only one or two in Florence, one in Verona,(none in Milan) one in nice, and one or two in Paris. As we are going to several locations I don’t want to overbook .. Im not sure but it seems like we will have a great time just walking around and enjoying the little cafes, architecture and each other etc.\n\nTrying to take deep breaths and not let her feed off my stress.. I’m ready to get passed this craziness I’ve gotten myself into and start enjoying the fact that I’m about to go on a trip of a lifetime with my daughter to celebrate this wonderful new phase of her life she’s about to step into!\n\nThank you for all your help and for any suggestions you might still have for us!\n\nI have read all of your post several times and was in tears so many times I can’t count.. Not because of stress but because of how gracious you all have been with your knowledge of traveling and your time. You all have spent so much time giving me such detailed advice and I want you to know it has really really helped me! I watched your links and have decided to make Switzerland a new bucket list! If I could push the undo button I would go back and make a stop at one of the beautiful lakes in Switzerland a must! I have also listened to your advice and decided we are going with a carryon and personal bag to help keep the trip feeling light and not get stressed pulling large bags through train stations and airports. I read Jeans link to the beautiful account of her trip with her daughter and it made me resolve to get this planning mess done today and get on with enjoying my time with my daughter!\n\nIf I can get the trains down I will start focusing on the fun tours like bike tours, cooking classes, etc. etc.\n\nIf anyone has been on a tour that really Wow’d them in any of the cities we are going to I’d love to hear about them. Trains and tours here I come! :)"
