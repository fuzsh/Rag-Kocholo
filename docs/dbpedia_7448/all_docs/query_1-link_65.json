        "text": "Shkodra\n\nArriving overland from Montenegro, Shkodra is the first city that you come to and an authentic one at that. The city is quite male-dominated so you may prefer to dress a bit more conservatively here if you want to avoid the odd glance.\n\nIf you choose to stay in the city, Shkodra Castle has fantastic views of the lake and is worth seeing. Also known as Rozafa Castle, this historic fortress holds significant historical and cultural importance for the region and has been a strategic stronghold for various civilisations, including the Romans, Byzantines, Venetians, and Ottomans.\n\nThe nicest area here is Shkodra Lake where you can camp overnight. The Lake is slightly out of the city and out of the way for public transport so you will need to hire a car or get a taxi here instead.\n\nAside from the castle and the lake, you can also explore the Marubi National Museum of Photography for a visual journey through Albania's history. Wander Pjaca Square, known for its local market and restaurants selling Albanian food, and don't miss the Ebu Beker Mosque, showcasing Ottoman architecture.\n\nWhile the castle and Shkodra Lake are must-visit spots, there isn't that much to keep you here for longer than a couple of days so you may prefer to spend time somewhere else.\n\nTirana\n\nThe capital, Tirana, is a very different story and this colourful, modern city will actually surprise you. There’s a large manmade lake where you’ll find the locals relaxing during their lunch hour and plenty of avenues for shopping. Or you can take a shuttle from the big mosque to the city outskirts for the larger malls.\n\nTirana is a great destination for museum lovers. You'll find the National History Museum where you can learn about the nation's evolution, the Albanian National Museum with artefacts from ancient civilisations, and the Natural Sciences Museum that exhibits Albania's biodiversity.\n\nFor art and literature lovers, the National Art Gallery showcases Albanian art, paintings and sculptures from the 13th century. The Fan Noli Museum honours the famous Albanian poet and writer, Fan Noli, who was also a former Prime Minister.\n\nFor culture and to learn more about the communist era, Bunk'Art 1 and 2 are converted underground bunkers where you can delve into the secretive Communist past and explore the secret police activities during that time. The House of Leaves (called Shtëpia e Gjetheve) is another museum focused on the surveillance control during that era.\n\nThe Et'hem Bey Mosque is a significant religious and cultural site in Tirana and you can go inside and learn more about its history and architecture in the small museum.\n\nIt doesn't take long to walk around the capital or you can take a walking tourinstead. But make sure you include Skanderbeg Square on your itinerary. This central plaza has many colourful buildings to make your camera snap happy. And pay a visit to the Pyramid of Tirana, originally built as a museum which you can climb for panoramic views of the city.\n\nTheth\n\nFrom the city to the solitude of the mountains or the ‘Albanian Alps’ as the locals like to say. Athough more rocky than the ones in Switzerland they are great for escaping city life and are different from any other area in the country. The village of Theth is surrounded by limestone mountains with a rocky landscape, traditional stone houses and clean, mountain air.\n\nYou can stay in guest houses with local families who provide home-cooked food and take you trekking throughout the region. Getting there can be a bumpy ride from Shkoder as it takes five hours with over 20km of it on windy rocky roads but it’s rustic travelling at its best.\n\nFrom here you can take the eight hour trek to Valbona through the valley pass and combine both villages for an extended stay. (Horses take your luggage if you’re only travelling one-way) then return via Lake Koman and Fierza by ferry back to the city of Shkoder.\n\nDhermi\n\nGoing south the scenery is beautiful with mountain ranges on one side and the rugged coastline that reappears as quickly as it vanishes on the other. Dhermi is the first of the Albania coastal towns where you can wild camp if you’re travelling with a tent.\n\nThere are set-up campsites for those who aren’t and the area is popular with tourists who come for the nice beaches, clear water and warm sea. If you’re coming by bus it is a twenty minute walk down to the beach but this area is definitely worth staying in and has a great ‘holiday feel.’\n\nVuno\n\nFor integrating with the locals, Vuno is a little town in the mountainside overlooking olive trees, on the route between Dhermi and Himare with a really lovely vibe. There is only one shop which doubles up as a restaurant where you’ll find the locals and occasional donkey walking past.\n\nFollow the hill down to beautiful Jal beach for some sea and sunbathing. You’ll also find locals at the sandy beach of Ksamil (not many tourists come here) just 10km south of Saranda and on the way to Butrint.\n\nIf you’re wanting to meet others, Durres and Golem are the most popular destinations. Durres is brimming with hotels, restaurants and bars, all with a view of the ocean. Here is the largest amphitheatre in the Balkans, and you can visit the pink palace of King Zog or take a short ride to Lalzit Bay, a sandy beach and slightly quieter than Durres.\n\nSarande\n\nNot all off the coastline is worth visiting and many of the beaches have small stones instead of sand. Instead of Vlore, choose the seaside city of Saranda with a Mediterranean climate, great beaches, restaurants and nightlife.\n\nSaranda is one of my favourite places to stay Albania and you can even visit Greece for the day as ferries run from here to Corfu. Saranda is actually the Greek name for ‘forty saints’ named after the Monastery Church of Forty Saints and a hike to the ruins of the monastery gives a great view over the city and countryside.\n\nThere are hot springs here near the town of Permet and the Benja hot springs are known for their curative effects (just don’t forget your bikini). Other beautiful beaches are Palase and Gjipe.\n\nOne unique place in Albania is the Blue Eyed Spring known as ‘Syri I Kalter.’ Buses run here every hour then it’s a thirty minute walk to the geological phenomenon. Butrint is also nearby; this ancient city is a World Heritage Site and you can stop off for a dip at Ksamil on the way, a coastal town with its own islands.\n\nTake the bus from Saranda to Gjirokaster then it’s a 2km walk to the entrance where you pay 50 Lek. Buses go back to Saranda every hour until 6pm.\n\nFor more history, Gjirokaster, known as the ‘museum city’ is an interesting day trip with steep cobbled streets leading to a 13th-century castle at the top of a mountain. The historic city was influenced by the Ottomans and is a well-preserved town which is a great place to stop if you’re travelling overland to Macedonia.\n\nThe lesser known village in the north is Kelmend, a place with rugged mountain landscapes, canyons, waterfalls, glacial valleys, rivers and lakes – ideal for horse riding, trekking and mountain biking.\n\nVoskopoja is home to churches and monasteries and also has several museums, then there’s Berat – the ‘city of 1001 windows’ also on the UNESCO World Heritage list.\n\nOther places to see are: the Greek influenced villages of Himare and Qeparo, and Shengjin, a growing coastal town on the route from Shkodra to Tirana.\n\nAlbania still remains relatively undiscovered but it’s not going to stay like that for long and construction is already underway to improve areas. Solo female travel Albania to see the authentic Albania in its prime.\n\nTours in Albania\n\nG Adventures Albania\n\nIf you are feeling apprehensive about travelling solo, sometimes taking a tour for part or all of your trip can give you the confidence you need before going it alone. G Adventures are a responsible tour company which mainly caters towards budget travellers. Most tours have an average of 10 people and there is no upper age limit.\n\nOnce you book your trip you pay extra for any excursions you want to do when you’re there. If you are planning on seeing more than just Albania, they have a 9 day adventure from Dubrovnik to Athens seeing some of Croatia, Montenegro, and Greece as well as Albania.\n\nIf you have longer, join their 15 day Zagreb to Athens tour which starts from Zagreb instead of Dubrovnik. I have personally used G Adventures and recommend them as a solo female friendly company.

Choose from a full day trip to Berat and a historic walking tour of the city, a visit to Shkoder Rozafa Castle with a local guide, or trip to Tirana and Kruja. Some of the tours require a minimum of 2 people but there are plenty to book as a solo and it’s really simple to use. Just check the reviews, price and availability then book online. * Check rates and availability for all Albania day tours\n\nAccommodation in Albania\n\nYou'll find a variety of accommodation in Albania. You can camp, stay in hostels, with local families or choose an apartment or a hotel. In the Albanian Alps, you can choose homestays where you get to stay with a local family on a full-board basis.\n\nHostels in Albania are really good value and sociable, and even if you forget to book, the hostels won’t turn you away. Instead, they will try to accommodate you wherever they can. It does get busy in the summer as there is only a small number of hostels so it’s worth booking before you get there.\n\nFor those travelling on a budget, camping in Albania is incredibly easy. Wild camping means you can camp anywhere although you may get approached to pay €5 for pitching your tent (I did this in Dermi). If you don’t have your own tent and don’t want to camp alone then consider staying in a pre-pitched tent within camping grounds with entertainment and others for company.\n\nIf you’re unsure of the best area to stay in Albania, I’ve listed my recommended destinations for solos below. For the best places to stay in Albania, all of the accommodations below have been recommended by both myself and solo female travellers from our Girls about the Globe community and come with our Solo Female Friendly endorsement.

Private cars were illegal for Albanians during the communist era so driving is quite new to the country.\n\nThere are trains from Tirana to Durres, Vlore, Milot and Shkodra but don’t expect them to be very comfortable. The best way is by local buses or minibuses (called furgons).\n\nThere are no central bus stations so finding where your bus departs from can be tricky, then once you’ve found it you may find yourself waiting for them to fill up with passengers before they depart. They usually shout the destination to get people on the bus.\n\nBuses from the capital to the coast (Dhermi) take 6 hours, cost 1000 Lek and depart from stop ‘K’ near the river. Buses do stop en-route for refreshment breaks. Read here for the bus timetable.\n\nNote that the bus from Saranda to Korca leaves daily except on Fridays and Sundays. If you prefer to take the coastal route from Saranda to Tirana instead of via Gjirokaster, take the 05.30 or the 21.00 bus.\n\nTravelling around Albania outside of villages it can be difficult to reach tourist sites. Hitchhiking is really popular so if you find a travelling buddy, it’s just as easy to hitch a ride to get around. Trust your instinct if you decide to hitch alone.\n\nFrom The Airport\n\nTirana – Taxis run from outside and cost approx 3500 Lek for the 12km journey to the city centre.\n\nResorthoppa operates a cheap airport shuttle that will take you to the city centre or your hotel or the Rinas Express bus runs from 6am to 6pm to the National Museum in the centre and costs only 350 Lek.\n\nHow Long Do I Need For Albania Solo Travel?\n\nYou'll need at least one week to see the capital and the coast or the mountains. I recommend two weeks as there are so many areas to see and getting around by bus can take a lot of time.\n\nWhere can I go from here?\n\nItaly – 2 hrs\n\nGreece – 1.5 hrs\n\nTurkey – 1.5 hrs\n\nTravelling Onwards (check visas before you travel)\n\nTo Montenegro – This is the first joint border crossing in the Western Balkans. There are daily departures from Shkodra to Ulcinj leaving at 6am and 12.30pm. Buses also run from Durres and Tirana.\n\nTo Kosovo – The bus from Durres to Pristina takes approx 5 hours and costs £12. The bus departs from Rruga Pavaresia street (the north end by the beach).\n\nTo Macedonia – Either take the bus from Tirana or from Pogradec then a furgon to the border Tushemisht then a minibus to Lake Ohrid.\n\nTo Italy – From Vlore passenger ferries operate to Brindisi and some allow you take your vehicle across. Click here for Aferry’s website. You can also take a boat from Durres to various ports in Italy. Click here for Venezia Lines.\n\nTo Greece – Catch a ferry to Corfu from Saranda but it’s not cheap and will set you back £23 one way or by bus to Athens.\n\nFAQs\n\nCan you drink water in Albania?
