        "text": "Hi Lois. This happened to us on a recent RS Sicily tour. Husband tested positive on the second day. We did not have a Plan B in place, but managed to flex our plans fairly well in the end. My report is here.\n\nYour tour guide and hotel staff are good resources for extending your hotel stay (if possible) and making recommendations. RSE was also helpful in what would be required to file for a refund. Our travel insurance, TravelGuard, was also helpful in detailing what we would need to file a claim with them. The RSE \"On-Call International\" resource was useless.\n\nBut otherwise, you are on your own to figure things out.\n\nI am not sure you need to spent much time on a Plan B ahead of time. If you get COVID, you will, after all, have a few days of downtime to figure something out, depending on the situation. We had good weather in Palermo, and in Rome (where I got COVID), so we did walking tours on our own, ate outside, etc. Our symptoms were \"mild cold\" so we did not ever feel really sick. Hotel staff only asked that we mask while inside. So there were no hard quarantine requirements.\n\nMy advice is to bring cold meds (we usually don't, but for some reason we did this time and that was super useful both to start with, and to take the box to the pharmacy to get something similar). Make sure you have apps like Rome2Rio, RSE audio tours, international data plan, etc. And don't hesitate to completely change your itinerary, depending on your return flight (\"Well, we are already completely screwed, where's the good weather in Italy right now?\" was our guiding philosophy lol).\n\nThe hardest part is getting over the feeling that you are wasting time and money. It's tough getting dropped from a tour, especially early and facing many days of finding something else to do (and trying to be respectful of those around you when you are contagious, so not going on tours and inside museums, etc). You just make the best of it.\n\nHappy to answer any questions. And you will love Portugal! We did that tour last spring.\n\nWe are sitting here in San Sebastián right now wrestling with these very questions after testing COVID + on Day 5 of the Basque tour. We are fortunate to have already been in transit to a beautiful place, now staying in a spacious 4-star hotel room. What was supposed to be a 2-night stay on tour will now be a 5-night stay, as we recover and sleep a lot. Even with mild symptoms, we are grateful to be able to stay put, and importantly reduce the risk of infecting others. Our timing could have been much worse.\n\nWe had to wait til Monday AM to find a facility that could do a PCR test, which our trip ins (Allianz) requires. We are also fortunate that our next flight from Bilbao to Paris is not until 6 days after testing positive. If we feel well enough, we think it’s possible. Next we have to look into our imaginary crystal ball (which no one has) to divine whether we will feel up to continuing our travels to Northern France for one more week as orig planned vs ending the trip sooner. Plenty still unknown, but this I know: no way would I want to make an 11-hour transatlantic flight from Paris back home right away. Last year, RS tours provided a higher level of support than they do currently. Our tour guide went above and beyond to help us before the tour left today for the final destination, but other than that we are on our own. You have to ask yourself if you are up to that.\n\nSo far, 7 of 22 of us tested positive and had to leave the tour. We were 2 of only 3 people who were masking all the time. We’re convinced that the group meals are what did us in. People are not into masking anymore, neither tour participants nor the locals.\n\nConsider all of that very carefully! In hindsight, we regret going on a tour that changed the rules from masks required to masks optional on the bus. I feel this is reckless. I know others disagree. I don’t need to be right, but I do need to be comfortable. I know people feel done with COVID, but the virus is not done with us.\n\nI should mention that until now, we had avoided COVID, are fully vaxxed, and are experienced solo/DIY travelers. I speak Spanish and limited French. We are resourceful and feel like we had a lot going for us, and every day we are figuring out the next steps. I would never go on a trip without trip insurance (especially so since the pandemic) given the potential risk of needing to change our return flight home. Also, do not assume trip insurance will not help with this. If we need to change our flight, Allianz has informed us they could help us. But mostly, you should expect to be on your own.\n\nIt isn't always Covid that could require a change in travel plans. Covid at least has rules with regards to expectations to leave a tour if testing positive, but there is still the problem of other flu and viruses you could pass on, or fevers, gut or illnesses that mean you are unable to travel on with the rest, or injury.\n\nYou don't always need a plan B, but you do need to go with a mindset that you will be responsible for yourself. Hotels and guides will assist, as may insurance providers, but you will still need to manage it. Not to make it sound daunting, but some people feel quite abandoned and resentful when a tour doesn't take care of things for them.\n\nHotels, guides and tour or insurance companies deal with this stuff all the time. Plan to use them as your first line of help. I had gut issues in India as well as fever. Guide called ahead and there was a hospital doctor on call ready to take care of me on arrival. Hotel 'house calls' are not out of the question. My guide did a pharmacy run when we all came down with colds on another trip. Hotels can phone around for vacancies if they cannot accommodate you. You won't be totally alone, but you will need to expect to be in the decision making.\n\nThe risk of having to leave a tour or change your travel plans has always been there. It is just that covid has increased the possibility of this happening. I was on a tour once where someone had to leave because they broke their leg. Someone I know was on a tour where a tour member had a heart attack. I sat next to someone on a plane who couldn’t return home for 9 days due to the 2010 volcano in Iceland. I have had to make alternate trip plans myself due to strikes, 9/11, weather, airline software bugs, and family emergencies. I’ve traveled quite a bit for both business and pleasure and these items have helped me develop my ”plan B” when problems arose:\n\n1) A mobile phone with an international plan. When you need to change your plans on the fly, a phone and data service are invaluable. I’ve rebooked flights on my phone at the airport while others are waiting in ridiculously long lines to speak to an agent. I’ve found alternate routes when there have been train stoppages. I’ve booked hotels when I needed to extend a stay.\n\n2) Hotel staff. The hotel staff can likely help you with advice such has how to find a pharmacy or doctor or obtain meal delivery.\n\n3) Medical insurance (and medical evacuation) that covers me internationally. Western Europe has high quality medical care, so you don’t need to worry much about the quality of care; you do need to make sure you have resources to pay for it.\n\n4) OTC meds. I always bring a small supply with me in case I get sick. Last year, I asked my doctor what she would recommend I take if I got covid. She suggested Mucinex and Tylenol, so I put those things in my bag in case I needed them. I typically always bring things like immodium and advil. While you can get these meds or equivalents in Europe, who wants to run to a pharmacy if they get sick in the middle of the night?\n\n5) Additional prescription meds. I typically bring about 1 weeks extra in case I get delayed. Last year, I brought 2 weeks extra.\n\n6) Funds (Trip Interruption Insurance) - Most logistical problems can be solved with money. If you need to change your flight, it can easily be done but it will probably cost more. If you need to get from point A to point B and there isn’t a great option on public transit, you can hire a driver to take you there. In Portugal, all the RS locations are either served by train or bus. The websites Rome2Rio or googlemaps can be a good starting point to help you figure out what bus lines or trains can connect you. Hotel staff can also be helpful.\n\nOverall, I wouldn’t worry too much and develop a ”plan B” at this point. Instead, make sure that you have the resources you need with you in case something doesn’t go as planned.\n\nHave a great trip. I took the RS Portugal tour last Sept/Oct and really enjoyed Portugal. Here is hoping that you have a great trip with no interruptions.\n\nWe had to leave our long awaited for Greece tour after the third night. As I talked to our guide that morning the first thing she said was, ‘but you were masking!’. And indeed we had been masking whenever we were inside or on the bus. I guess I was able to say we had tried everything possible to stay healthy and just got very unlucky. My husband had cold symptoms and extreme tiredness. I was fine.\n\nThis happened on a one night only stop and we could only stay one additional night in that hotel before we had to vacate. So we stayed one extra night and took a bus back to Athens. One more night and then we were able to redo our flight and get home. I ended up positive after getting home.\n\nIt is a very difficult situation to find yourself in and how many days you can stay put would make a big difference. Happily no one else on our tour was affected.\n\nMy husband and I are booked for a BOE 21 day tour in August. This is my fear. I am hunting for appropriate travel insurance. Our medical insurance will cover us abroad, and the airfare is refundable but I am looking for trip interruption insurance. I am trying to read the fine print as recommended here but it seems that policies have changed since the COVID status changed earlier this year. For example, Alliance policy states \"TRIP CANCELLATION AND INTERRUPTION\n\nBenefit will be provided for loss(es) incurred by You for a covered Trip cancelled up to the date and time of departure or interrupted or delayed after the time and date of departure. A maximum benefit of up to the amount indicated in the Schedule of Benefits to cover certain expenses as listed below which result in the cancellation or interruption of Your Trip due to any of the following Unforeseen events:\n\nMedical / Health\n\na) Any serious Injury, death, or Sickness;\n\n(1) Occurring to You or a Traveling Companion, a Family Member traveling with You, that is so disabling as to cause a reasonable person to cancel or interrupt their Trip or which results in medically imposed restrictions as certified by a Physician at the time of Loss preventing your continued participation in the Trip;\"\n\nI'm not sure getting kicked off of the tour for testing positive is covered under the \"Any serious injury, death, or sickness.\n\nCan anyone speak to this from recent experience? Is there another company that might be better for COVID related trip interruption? Ugh! thank you all so much\n\nWe were on the RS Portugal tour in April. I came down with Covid 6 days into the tour. We were in Óbidos at the time. Another tour member came down with Covid at the same time. Coincidence? I sincerely doubt it but also don’t want to start another debate on masks versus no masks, so please don’t. After a positive test you are immediately booted from the tour and completely on your own, the tour guide left with just a goodby, good luck. My Covid was not “mild” and luckily the hotel let us stay for 4 more days. I can’t say enough about how helpful the hotel staff was with suggestions and helping us hire a car and driver to get us to Caiscai where we had been able to find a hotel room. We stayed there for the remainder of our time and left on schedule for our flight home from Lisbon. Let me just say that most don’t get sick and enjoy their tour but you do need to be aware of what happens if you do contract Covid and have the capability of making arrangements because there is every possibility that it could happen to you.\n\nI would like to add that the Rick Steves group has now provided us with a copy of our original invoice and a letter showing that we left the tour due to illness and showing how much would be returned to us from RS, in order to be reimbursed for the remainder due to trip interruption from Chase. At the moment, what one would think should be an easy process dealing with Chase has become anything but."
