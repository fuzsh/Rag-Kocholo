As Rome2Rio is not a transport operator or booking engine, always check with the transport provider* for more information regarding travelling with large or extra luggage, pets, bikes and other sports equipment etc.\n\nFortunately our key flight booking partner, Skyscanner, has created a search box that can help you find the contact details for airlines and travel agents listed on their site. This is a great resource to help you locate more information directly from airline operators. You can find the search box here.\n\nOur key booking partner for other forms of transport, Omio, also has a resource for operator policies. You can find the Travel Companies page here."
