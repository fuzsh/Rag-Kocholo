        "text": "How do I get to the start of the route?\n\nThese travel notes are regularly checked for accuracy, both by ATG and via much-valued client feedback.\n\nLike all travel and transport arrangements, however, they may be subject to change. For up-to-the-minute information please check online.\n\nNote about train travel in Italy: Most journeys can be booked online and we recommend doing so if you are will be travelling long-distance, e.g. Rome-Florence; Milan-Venice. These are Frecciarossa, Frecciargento, Frecciabianca & InterCity trains. Booking ahead for such journeys can save you a lot of money! There is no need to book ahead for shorter, regional journeys, e.g. Florence – Siena, and we wouldn’t recommend doing so as regional tickets are non-refundable, non-changeable.\n\nSee here for a useful guide to train travel in Italy:\n\nhttps://www.seat61.com/train-travel-in-italy\n\nTimetables and advance purchase of tickets:\n\nwww.italiarail.com\n\nwww.raileurope.com\n\nwww.thetrainline.com\n\nwww.trenitalia.com\n\nAll European train timetables: www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml\n\nInternational travel – how to get to/from anywhere: www.rome2rio.com\n\nTRAVEL TO ITALY\n\nThe recommended destination airports for this route are Pisa and Florence.\n\nTRAVEL TO THE FIRST HOTEL BY PUBLIC TRANSPORT\n\nThe journey from Pisa or Florence to San Gimignano is straightforward.\n\nFrom Pisa airport by train and taxi, via Certaldo:\n\nThis journey comprises a 1.5-2 hr train journey to Certaldo (tickets cost approximately €13), then a 15-20 min taxi ride on to San Gimignano (approx €35).\n\nTo get from the airport to Pisa Centrale station there is a high-speed ‘Pisa Mover’ train that operates every day from 0600 to 0000 at 5/8 minute intervals - cost €5. When you exit the baggage reclaim area into the arrivals hall, turn left and keep straight on, heading for the far end of the terminal building. The platform is located just outside the far end of the airport. Tickets can be purchased on the platform (English-speaking ticket machines); or at the ticket office located on the right just before exiting the airport terminal. You can buy a combined PisaMover and train ticket to avoid queuing for a ticket at Pisa Centrale.\n\nYou can also take a taxi from the airport to Pisa Centrale station which can take as little as 5 minutes. If there are two or more of you the taxi option may be cheaper! The taxi rank is just outside arrivals.\n\nFrom Pisa Centrale take the train (usually destined for Florence) that stops at Empoli. At Empoli change onto a train to Siena (often an almost immediate connection). Alight at Certaldo.\n\nThen take a taxi to San Gimignano (journey time 20 mins, approx €30).\n\nTaxis are not always waiting at the station and it is therefore recommended that you ask us to book a taxi for you in advance, once you have an idea of your arrival time at Certaldo.\n\nIf it is not possible for you to anticipate your arrival time in Certaldo in advance, your ATG Route Manager may still be able to help organise a taxi for you, even if given as little as an hour’s warning of your arrival, thereby saving you this inconvenience and speeding up the final leg of your journey!\n\nPlease check train times at www.trenitalia.com\n\nPlease remember to validate any train ticket you purchase in Italy before you board the train by stamping it in the green and white machine at the entrance to the platform; your ticket is not valid for travel unless you do this and you can be fined if you fail to do so.\n\nFrom Pisa airport by train and bus, via Poggibonsi:\n\nFollow the directions as above, but alight from the train at Poggibonsi instead, which is about 12 minutes beyond Certaldo.\n\nTip: Trains in Italy tend to be very punctual so if you know your arrival time, you will know where to alight even if you can’t see the station name-board on pulling in to a station.\n\nBuses to San Gimignano (journey time 25 mins) leave from just outside Poggibonsi station. Buy your ticket (€1.70) in the station bar, or if it is closed then at the tabacchi which is just outside the station on the right. Buses run every hour on weekdays and Saturdays, and approximately every 2 hrs on Sundays and bank holidays. The bus will drop you at Porta San Giovanni, one of the main entrances to San Gimignano (which is pedestrianised). From there it is only a few minutes’ walk to your hotel (although the route is uphill on a cobbled street).\n\nIf you are arriving on a Sunday or bank holiday it’s probably best to take the Certaldo + taxi option to save yourself a potentially long wait for a bus.\n\nFrom Florence airport by public transport:\n\nJust outside the terminal to the left you will find the T2 Vespucci tram with regular services to the Piazza dell'Unità Italiana station, which is adjacent to the Santa Maria Novella train station in the heart of Florence. The T2 service operates from approximately 5am to midnight every day, every 4-5 minutes. Journey time 20 minutes. Cost €1.50 for a single ticket.\n\nBuy your ticket from the automatic ticket machines on the platform (look for the ‘ATAF’ logo) that accept cash, cards (including contactless cards), Apple Pay and Google Pay. There is also a ticket machine inside the airport in the baggage claim area.\n\nStamping your ticket: Once on board, don’t forget to validate your ticket in the little yellow box!.\n\nNote: Unless you are travelling light you must buy a ticket (s) for your luggage! Small suitcases or bags of not more than 10 kg (22 lbs), 55x40x20 cm (22x16x8 inches) are allowed free of charge. You must buy and validate an extra ticket for each larger bag (max. 80X45X25 cm, 20 Kg or 31x18x10 inches/44 lbs); limit of two pieces per passenger. Outsize bags are not allowed.\n\nFrom Santa Maria Novella station you can either take a train on the Siena line to Certaldo (approx. €8; and then a taxi to San Gimignano, as per above) or on to Poggibonsi (and then a bus, as per above). Alternatively there is an hourly bus service from Florence to Poggibonsi (50-90 mins). About half of these meet up with the connecting bus to San Gimignano. Buses run hourly on weekdays and Saturdays; less frequently on Sundays and bank holidays. Timetables: www.tiemmespa.it . Buy bus tickets at the bus station – they are not available on the bus.\n\nCar Parking\n\nIt is not possible to leave a car in San Gimignano, as the town is pedestrianised and visitor parking is extremely limited. The Hotel Athena in Siena offers secure car parking spaces (you will need to request this). Hotels within Siena’s city walls will not have the space or facilities to offer car parking. There are several public car parks in Siena where you can leave your car for as long as you like. The closest is ‘Parcheggio Il Duomo’ (entrance through Porta Tufi) which has a special price for Siena hotel guests of a maximum €25 per day or €140 per week (the ticket must be stamped by your hotel before paying). There are regular bus services between Siena and San Gimignano.\n\nTravel by Taxi\n\nWe can book you a taxi to the first hotel. The taxi from Pisa airport holds 3-4 passengers (depending on luggage), takes 2 hrs and costs approximately €170. A taxi from Florence airport takes 1.5 hrs and costs approx €160. Prices may alter at weekends, Bank Holidays or late at night.\n\nPlease place your booking with the ATG office at least two weeks before departure. The cost of the taxi will be confirmed to you once the booking is secured. Payment of the taxi fare should be made locally, not to ATG. The driver will have your flight details and will be waiting in Arrivals with a sign showing your name or ATG.\n\n•If you change your flight please notify us on 01865 315678 so we can contact the taxi company to reschedule the taxi for you.\n\n•If, on the day of departure, your flight is cancelled or you miss or change it, please immediately contact the ATG emergency number 01865 315600 so we can contact the taxi company to reschedule or cancel the taxi for you.\n\n•If your flight is delayed and you have arranged for the taxi to meet you at the destination airport, your taxi driver will wait for you.\n\n•If you are delayed and you have arranged for a taxi to meet you at a non airport location (e.g. a train station) it is essential that you contact your Route Manager or call the ATG emergency line to notify us at the earliest possible moment, so we can contact the taxi company to re-schedule or cancel the taxi for you.\n\n•Please note that failure to advise ATG that you cannot meet the taxi booked for you may result in the taxi costs being passed back to you.\n\nImportant: Taxi prices quoted apply to the local firm used regularly by ATG – and are guaranteed only if you book through the office in advance. If you get a taxi off a taxi rank please ask the driver to confirm the price for you.\n\nAT THE END OF YOUR TRIP\n\nSiena is very well served by public transport, with frequent train and bus connections for onward travel.\n\nFlorence/Florence airport: Please check timetables at www.trenitalia.com. A shuttle bus runs from Florence station to the airport every 30 minutes, journey time 20 mins. There are also regular buses that leave from Piazza Gramsci in Siena. Check times with the Route Manager.\n\nTo Pisa/Pisa airport: Please check timetables at www.trenitalia.com. At Pisa Centrale change onto the airport People Mover.\n\nSiena to Rome: Buses provide the most direct route to Rome. Buses leave from Piazza Gramsci/Viale Tozzi in the centre of Siena (or 10 mins later from the train station) and arrive at Roma Tiburtina bus station. The journey takes approx 3 hrs and costs €15- €35 per person. Check times with Route Manager\n\nBY TAXI\n\nA taxi holding 3-4 passengers plus luggage will cost approx:\n\nSiena to Pisa airport: €220\n\nSiena to Florence airport: €150\n\nIf you need a taxi at the end of your trip, please ask your Route Manager to book it for you, and pay the taxi fare locally, not to ATG.\n\nIf you wish to travel by bus please check timetables with your Route Manager.\n\nNOTE\n\nWhilst ATG provides travel information that is accurate at the time of publication this may be subject to change, international flights may be delayed, national and regional transport systems may be subject to expedient alterations (whether timetables, or local engineering works). Information regarding such changes is available online.\n\nApart from flights or taxis booked through ATG, the Company has little or no knowledge of clients’ independent plans and arrangements prior to their arrival."
