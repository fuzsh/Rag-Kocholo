Doing laundry is painless compared to lugging around a giant suitcase. What to pack always depends on the destination (although I always pack the items at the bottom of this page). As a rule of thumb – if it’s a “just in case” item that you can definitely purchase at the destination if you need it, leave it at home.\n\nClothing: versatile and weather-appropriate pieces that go well together. Stay away from crazy prints and wild colors so you don’t have to pre-plan every outfit.\n\nShoes: Bring no more than three pairs. Include something that you can walk all day in, a comfortable pair that can easily be dressed up, and a third one depending on the destination (sandals, hiking boots, water shoes, etc).\n\nToiletries: mini versions only and don’t get crazy – the more multifunctional items, the better.\n\nElectronics: chargers, a converter, a phone, a camera, and a kindle are usually sufficient. Bring a laptop or tablet if you need it.\n\nPaperwork and important documents: bring copies of your passport, visa, all reservations, travel insurance, health insurance and information, and vaccination certificate (depending on the destination).\n\nI always recommend packing for a week if you’re traveling for 7 days or longer.
