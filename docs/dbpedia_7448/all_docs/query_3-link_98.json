        "text": "Day 1 | Arrive in Assisi\n\nWelcome to Assisi, a town in the Umbria region of Central Italy and the birthplace of St Francis, one of Italy’s patron saints. The beautiful town is dominated its castles and churches, with the Basilica of San Francesco d’Assisi being particularly memorable. Settle into your accommodation and spend some time exploring town, perhaps introducing yourself to some of Italy’s finest cuisine at one of the many trattorias or osterias.\n\nDay 2 | Assisi – Foligno | 20 km / 5 hours\n\nBegin your journey along St Francis’ Way at the Basilica of St Francis – a most fitting place to start. Set off towards Rome, enjoying a relatively flat walk along paths and quiet secondary roads. A stop in Spello, a few kilometres before Foligno, is a great idea. It’s a charming Umbrian town with plenty of little bars and cafes for a coffee or cold drink and the winding ancient streets are ripe for exploring and photo opportunities. Foligno, your destination for the evening, is an industrial and commercial centre that rose to prominence under the Papal State during the 13th century. There are plenty of interesting sights, including the cathedral, several other churches and the Piazza Della Repubblica.\n\nDay 3 | Foligno – Campello sul Clitunno | 20 km / 5 hours\n\nAfter breakfast, depart Foligno past the Porta Romana (Roman door) with the path taking you towards the Castello di Saint’Eraclio, along the ancient Via Flaminia. This Roman road led from Rome over the Apennine Mountains all the way to Ariminum, on the Adriatic Sea. Don’t worry, you won’t be walking all the way to the Adriatic today, but you will be following dirt roads on a testing uphill section, eventually arriving at Campello sul Clitunno. This small, fortified village is at the centre of olive oil production and has a UNESCO-listed temple, though it’s most known for its lovely lake and freshwater springs, which were even mentioned by Pliny the Edler, a revered Roman philosopher and author.\n\nDay 4 | Campello sul Clitunno – Spoleto | 12 km / 3 hours\n\nEnjoy a short but beautiful walk today, enjoying several of the small villages that typify St Francis’ Way. The stepped village of Poreta is a highlight, ensconced in olive trees and fortified walls, while the valleys and mountains along the way are certainly worth a photo or two. Your evening’s destination, Spoleto, dates back to the 12th century and is home to some truly unforgettable eateries offering traditional Umbrian dishes cooked by nonna as well as Michelin-starred options. The Spoleto Cathedral is well worth visiting and features beautiful mosaic work and frescoes.\n\nDay 5 | Spoleto – Ceselli | 17 km / 4 hours\n\nThe walk from Spoleto to Ceselli begins with a climb towards the Nerva River Valley, passing by Monteluco and the Hermitage of St Francis. This place is home to many legends about St Francis and is said to have been settled by Syrian refugees in the 5th century. Be sure to have a poke around before continuing through the hermitage’s sacred woods and taking in the stunning valley of Spoleto below. The tiny village of Ceselli is a charming place to spend an evening soaking up the atmosphere of the Italian countryside.\n\nDay 6 | Ceselli – Arrone | 15 km / 3 hours\n\nEnjoy an easy day along St Francis’ Way, walking over generally flat land with plenty of shade provided by the trees along the banks of the Nera River. There’s a possibility of taking a detour today, which will see you visiting San Pietro, a medieval abbey in the small township of Ferentillo. Alternatively, continue walking towards Arrone, a hillside town with an old guard tower and lovely church, not to mention a number of quaint bars and restaurants.\n\nDay 7 | Arrone – Piediluco | 13 km / 3 hours\n\nLeaving Arrone, a relaxed stroll will take you to the Marmore Falls, from where the trail begins a number of ascents and descents through the wooded landscape. Though this is a short day, it’s worth breaking up the stage and stopping in Piediluco, a medieval village overlooking the vast Lake Piediluco, which marks the border between Umbria and Lazio. Archaeologists have excavated evidence of settlements dating back to the Bronze Age here, though the later history of the area is just as interesting, featuring battles between the Sabines and Romans. These days, the food and wine on offer is a definite highlight, both of the town and St Francis’ Way.\n\nDay 8 | Piediluco – Poggio Bustone | 22 km / 5–6 hours\n\nCross the Umbrian border into Lazio, climbing to the commune of Labro. Sitting at just over 600 metres above sea level, this hilltop village is quietly impressive place with a magnificent castle watching over the residents and surrounding countryside. This stage of St Francis’ Way sees you cross the verge of the Reatini mountain range, which means a day packed with views before arriving at Santuario di Poggio Bustone, located at 820 metres above sea level. The evening views here are simply divine.\n\nDay 9 | Poggio Bustone – Rieti | 17 km / 4 hours\n\nToday, St Francis’ Way offers up a mix of ascents and descents along a very peaceful trail. There’ll be some walking on smaller mule tracks as well as the occasional paved road, eventually delivering you in the ancient city of Rieti. Set on a hilltop with lovely views of the Sabine Mountains, Rieti is the departure point for the final 100 kilometres of St Francis’ Way to Rome. There’s plenty to see in town, with a particular highlight being the Rieti Cathedral. With construction beginning in 1109, it was consecrated in 1225 and rebuilt in the 17th century, though the magnificent, 13th-century bell tower still remains. All your Italian staples can be found in town; gelati, pizza, pasta. And given this is a walking holiday, there’ll be no guilt when it comes to eating as much as possible.\n\nDay 10 | Rieti – Poggio San Lorenzo | 22 km / 5 hours\n\nBegin the day with eight kilometres of flat terrain before encountering some testing uphill sections. There’s some great walking through woods, over streams and across fields, with a challenging final ascent to Poggio San Lorenzo. Along the way you’ll see the 100-kilometre sign that marks the beginning of the last stretch of St Francis’ Way. Poggio San Lorenzo is a quiet little town, the perfect place to put your feet up and enjoy a glass of primo Italian vino.\n\nDay 11 | Poggio San Lorenzo – Ponticelli di Scandriglia | 20 km / 4 hours\n\nA challenging stretch of walking is rewarded with gorgeous views of the surrounding mountains. Along the way, we highly recommending stopping at the church of Santa Vittoria. There are plenty of charming villages in this section of St Francis’ Way and several towns in which one can find water fountains, steaming cups of espresso and plates of tasty pasta. Though relatively small, Ponticelli is a welcome sight at the end of a testing day, where you’ll enjoy a well-earned meal and a good night’s rest.\n\nDay 12 | Ponticelli di Scandriglia – Montelibretti | 13 km / 3 hours\n\nThere’ so much to see and so much to enjoy as the kilometres to Rome become fewer and fewer. Today is a short day but shouldn’t be rushed as the walking is simply lovely. You’ll begin on a downhill trail, alternating between dirt and paved roads and surrounded by olive groves and oak trees, eventually reaching Poggio Corese. From here, you should be able to see the commanding Castello Orsini in Nerola, while the perfect place for a refreshment is the small town of Acquaviva. The trail will then take you into the valley then back up to Montelibretti; your overnight destination and a charming town that’s home to the lovely Palazzo Barberini.\n\nDay 13 | Montelibretti – Monterotondo | 16 km / 4 hours\n\nWalk today from the hilltops to the valley floor and along the legendary Tiber River. St Francis’ Way isn’t the only historical thread you’ll follow today; these are the waters in which Romulus and Remus, the founders of Rome, were supposedly abandoned in before being rescued by the wolf Lupa. The walking today involves a few ascents and descents until you reach Monterotondo and Macchia di Gattaceca, a lush natural reserve with several karst sinkholes including the wonderful Well of Merro. Monterotondo, a town with a touch over 40,000 residents, is thought to be built on the site of the ancient town of Eretum, which was held by the Sabine people and saw many conflicts between the Romans and Sabines.\n\nDay 14 | Monterotondo – Monte Sacro | 18 km / 4 hours\n\nBegin your day at the Duomo of Monterotondo in the Piazza Papa Giovanni Paolo II. From here, the trail will take you through the charming rural landscape of the Roman countryside across undulating terrain. After some ups and downs, you’ll enter the urban landscape of Rome, known as the Eternal City. As this is the penultimate day of your pilgrimage along St Francis’ Way, you’ll finish in Monte Sacro, the 16th quartiere of Rome. With the pull of the city centre increasing, tonight is a final opportunity to reflect on your journey through Italy so far before tomorrow’s final push into the heart of Rome.\n\nDay 15 | Monte Sacro – Rome | 15 km / 4 hours\n\nWith 15 kilometres to cover, today’s walking is comfortable and relaxed as you penetrate Rome’s centre. It’s doesn’t take long to reach the heart of the city and you’ll finish your journey in The Vatican at St Peter’s Basilica, undoubtedly one of the most impressive buildings in the world regardless of one’s faith. This is a special place for pilgrims the world over and you’ll feel the full emotional impact of your walk to Rome, no matter where you started the journey. Tonight, celebrate your achievements on St Francis’ Way in this wonderful city and be sure to help yourself to a plate of carbonara – a Roman speciality.\n\nDay 16 | Finish in Rome\n\nYour journey along St Francis’ Way officially comes to an end after breakfast this morning.\n\nVisit www.wanderingthheworld.com.au for more information.\n\nTHE WALKING\n\nThis trip is a self-guided itinerary, ideal for groups and independent travellers who prefer to navigate their own way, in their own time.\n\nYou will be provided with an information pack with easy to read maps and instructions, complete with directions to guide you on the well-marked paths and tracks.
