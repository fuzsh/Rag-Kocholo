        "text": "Almost every German town which expects at least a few tourists has a Tourist Information, and they almost always have a website. Most times also in English.\n\nYou shouldn't be afraid to call them or send them an e-mail either. They are accustomed to foreign tourists and will generally understand English (and in South-Western Germany, French as well). They can also help you finding accomodation.\n\nHere's the Tourist Information website of Baden-Baden.\n\nBut in general, searching the web for ‹town name› tourist information will lead you directly to their websites.\n\nI live in the region around Baden-Baden. Let me first state that the previous answers are basically correct. Using bahn.de, you can find trains and busses that will take you everywhere you want, especially to the more well-known tourist locations. So there is no need to rent a car.\n\nOn the other hand, however, although Baden-Baden is not a small town, the region around Baden-Baden, especially the Black Forest, is a rural region. This means, depending on your chosen destinations, the net of public transport might be somewhat sparse, resutling in longer waiting times and cumbersome connections.\n\nThis is not meant to scare you off from public transport. As previuosly stated, it is definitely possible to use public transport only. I just want to point out that there are certainly some benefits regarding comfort and time if you rent a car. I guess it is a trade-off between comfort and cost.\n\nAlthough you not directly asked for it, allow me to suggest some destinations:\n\nThe Autoroute \"Schwarzwaldhochstraße\" and the lake \"Mummelsee\" are great scenery spots and good as a starting point for hiking if you enjoy that (the weather here is comparably mild for November)\n\nIn Baden-Baden itself, I suggest to visit the Casino (you dont need to wear a tie, a classic sportsjacket or a blazer are enough)\n\nIn Bühl, the neighbouring town to Baden-Baden, you can visit the ruins of a medieval Castle (I recommend climbing the tower and enjoying the view)\n\nKarlsruhe is the nearest major city. If you are interested in Bars or Clubs, this might be the place to go. It is also home to a well-regarded Universitiy. In the city center, you will find a palace with a historic museum inside. Also, the museum of natural history is quite good.\n\nA couple of places you might like to visit in the Black Forest are (1) Triberg-Schonach (home to the https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/worlds-largest-cuckoo-clock), and (2) Titisee-Neustadt, where the picturesque lake Titisee is located - a good base for walking and hiking.\n\nThese days Google seems to directly return information about almost every public transport connection in the civilized world. For example a search for \"baden baden to triberg train\" tells me that there are trains leaving at 10:30, 12:30, 13:30 etc. and that the journey takes 1 hour 12 minutes. A smartphone with mobile data is very useful for journey planning once you are in the country.\n\nI would not worry too much about the language issue. Almost everyone in Germany working in the tourist industries (hotel staff, waiters, etc.) will speak at least passable English.\n\nRome2rio (rome2rio.com) is a fantastic site for this. I use it to plan my routes whenever I take a vacation.\n\nYou can enter your origin and destination (anywhere in the world), then it will give you all possible transportation options for the entire route, including public transport and driving. Here is a search from Baden-Baden to Black Forest:\n\nhttps://www.rome2rio.com/map/Baden-Baden/Black-Forest-Baden-Württemberg-Germany\n\nAs you can see, it says you can take a train or drive a personal car, as other answers have suggested.\n\nI've used this site for travel in Europe, Asia, and South America, and it has always been useful and accurate."
