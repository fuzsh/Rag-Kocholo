        "text": "Point-to-point travel and pass travel are both valid options for exploring Europe, and both have their own benefits.\n\nPoint-to-point tickets are good for short distance travel, such as travel from city to city within a country. They are also a good value if you plan to restrict your travel and are only going to one or two places. This option may be more economical for you if you know the cities and destinations you want to travel to in advance.\n\nIn general, passes are a good value if you plan to travel extensively throughout one or several countries, or if you plan to cover long distances. They provide access for most rail routes and allow you to travel hassle-free by not having to wait in lines at the train station to get tickets. By selecting Pass Security when purchasing your pass, your tickets will be safe from theft or loss. In some cases you will still have to make seat reservations or pay supplements, but most routes allow for unlimited pass use without having to pay an extra fee.\n\nMany Eurail passes offer bonuses or discounts to be used while you travel throughout Europe. These extra benefits include discounts on ferry and bus services, hotel rooms, and bonus attractions to museums. Bring your pass or ticket to the place where it will be redeemed (ferry crossings, etc.) and show it to the right employee. In the case of hotels, passengers must call in advance to ask them their rules on using the discount and how to do it.\n\nReturn to FAQ page.\n\nA consecutive-day pass provides unlimited rail travel for the duration of the pass, once it has been validated. For example, if you buy a month long pass you can travel at any time during that month.\n\nFlexible travel days give the pass-holder a 2 month period from the validation date to utilize the number of days they have purchased for their pass. If you buy a 2-month flexipass with 10 days of travel, you can use the ten days at any point during the 60-day period.\n\nBoth passes have their benefits. The consecutive day pass is great if you are roaming and don't know exactly where you are going or how long it will take you. It tends to be more expensive. The flexipass only allows limited days of travel so more planning needs to go into your itinerary. It is great for travelers on a budget and costs less than a consecutive day pass.\n\nReturn to FAQ page.\n\nA \"mini fare\" is a sale fare, which can be between 10-60% off the normal fare. These sale fares also come with different fare rules, including the policies about changing or canceling your ticket.\n\nFor instance, with a mini fare you cannot change a ticket - with a normal or flexible fare, you can. Mini fares are also typically limited to a certain number of seats available for sale at a certain time, so you may not find the same sale fare available the next day or even later on the same day.\n\nIt is always important to read all fare rules before purchasing any ticket.\n\nReturn to FAQ page.\n\nTrenitalia's train schedules and fares are typically only released between 90-120 days in advance*, so it's not a good idea to solidify travel plans before that point—the timetable can change seasonally.\n\nYou can buy your train tickets roughly 2 months ahead of when you'll need them, and can even book them the day before your train trip. Once you're in Italy, you can buy tickets just before you get on a train.\n\nBuying tickets soon after they're released gives you a better chance of securing seats during busy travel days, and may give you access to sales or ticket discounts that are only available for advance purchases.\n\n* The 90-120 day figure refers to high-speed trains. Regional train tickets are usually only available about 60 days in advance.\n\nReturn to FAQ page.\n\nWhen you use ItaliaRail's search tool, enter the origin and the destination of your trip. Then select the date you want to travel and click on search to find the trains that suit your schedule.\n\nThe platform will show you all the trains available between your city pair, then choose the time and type of fare that accommodates with your schedule, budget and restrictions you want to take with the type of fare. Buying your tickets online is as easy as selecting the train trips you want and entering your payment information. Your seats are confirmed upon payment.\n\nTrains that originate in Italy are reserved with electronic tickets, or e-tickets, which means you'll receive your ticket information instantly by email.\n\nReturn to FAQ page.\n\nWhen to Make a Reservation\n\nPurchasing a train ticket means you have bought the right to travel from one city to another by train. Many tickets, however, do not specify the date of travel or even the exact train. That is what reservations are for, so for some train trips you'll need both a ticket and a reservation.\n\nAll reservation holders must be in possession of a valid rail pass or city-to-city ticket that covers the routing of the train they have reserved. Not all trains require reservations, but they are required on the following trains:\n\nHigh-Speed Trains (e.g. Eurostar, TGV, TAV, Thalys)\n\nLong Distance and Express Trains in Spain, Portugal, Scandinavia and Eastern Europe\n\nLong Distance and Express Trains during high season (Jul-Aug)\n\nSleeping accommodations on all overnight trains not on day trains\n\nIt's also possible to purchase reservations on some trains that do not require them. This may be advisable during high season travel, but it's entirely up to the passenger.\n\nReturn to FAQ page.\n\nPNR stands for \"passenger name record,\" and it's the Trenitalia booking code for your train ticket. You receive a PNR when you have purchased an e-ticket.\n\nOn some trains, the PNR is all you'll need to show to the conductor (either printed out or on your smartphone or tablet). On other trains, you'll be required to use the PNR in a self-service ticket machine at the station to print out a paper ticket before boarding the train.\n\nBe aware that if you print a ticket in a rail vending machine you will have to validate the ticket prior to boarding the train See: What does it mean to validate a rail ticket or a rail pass? — What you need to do will be indicated on your confirmation email.\n\nReturn to FAQ page.\n\nIt depends on the type of train ticket or fare you bought. While rail passes are issued in the name of specific passengers and must match that traveler's passport, regular e-tickets or train tickets as of now are not associated with specific passengers and conductors do not require ID on the train. For most tickets, names are not required to appear in the ticket as of now, therefore you do not need to change your e-ticket if you entered the wrong name in the reservation by mistake. Please note that we have received notification that this can change soon, and the tickets will be nominative. The passenger, though is required to be properly identified at all times when travelling.\n\nThere are exceptions to this rule, however.\n\nIf you purchase a ticket on an overnight train or a cross-border train, those tickets are for individual passengers and conductors do require ID, passport and or valid documentation to enter into a new country like VISA or the appropiate entry documentation. If you entered the wrong name you might need to change your reservation and rebook your trip. In case you purchased a restrictive fare, you might lose it as super-economy fares which are the most restriuctive, do not allow changes. We recomend you to always buy a fare that allows at least 1 change like the Economy fare.\n\nReturn to FAQ page.\n\nWith our exclusive e-tickets, you will receive a minimum of two emails, more depending on the number of trains trips reserved. The first email is the order invoice confirmation showing the amounts paid, and the second shows the e-ticket booking \"PNR\" confirmation. Both emails will be sent immediately upon completion of your booking. Download the e-ticket at the paragraph HOW DOES MY TICKET WORK? Type: E-Ticket Click here for your Ticket(s) - that you will see in the documentation you will receive by email.\n\nFor any orders that must be printed and shipped to you, most orders received before 3:00pm EST Monday-Friday will be shipped the same day. Orders received after 3:00pm EST are shipped the next business day.\n\nDelivery time for most standard US orders is 2-3 business days, unless otherwise requested. International orders can take between 3-7 days. A signature is required for delivery of the package. You can place a rush order if you need to. Please email us for assistance, and be sure to include your order number, name, address, and departure date.\n\nPlease be sure there is enough time for your order to reach you prior to departure. No orders are shipped on Saturdays, Sundays, or US holidays, so allow an additional 24-to-48 hours for weekend orders. ItaliaRail is not responsible for weather-related delays or situations beyond our control. For questions regarding delivery, include your Order ID number and name in an email to info@italiarail.com.\n\nReturn to FAQ page.\n\nAny e-ticket could be re-printed in plain paper to be shown to the train conductor, or shown in electronic format like in a smartphone, so it could not be lost unless the printed paper or phone and laptop is lost. We recommend the printing of e-tickets in plain paper in case phones are out of battery of have any electrical issue. You can contact customer service to request a copy of your ticket to be sent to a different email if needed.\n\nLost or stolen Rail Passes are not refundable, exchangeable, or replaceable.\n\nAny handling and/or issuing charges for passes are non-refundable.\n\nUnused Rail Passes are refundable within one (1) year from issue date or six (6) months from issue date where so stated, provided they have not been validated, have been canceled and so stamped at a retail station in Europe prior to the beginning of the validation period.\n\nAll refunds on Rail Passes are subject to a 15% cancellation charge.\n\nPartially used or validated passes are non-refundable.\n\nPlease mail us at info@italiarail.com or call us while in Italy at our local number to (+39) 06 9763 2451 or toll-free (US/CA) at (+1) 877-375-7245 to speak with a member of our customer service team 24/7. For more information, please include your Order Number in your email.\n\nReturn to FAQ page.\n\nValidating a Train Ticket\n\nAs of 5th August 2023, Trenitalia tickets for regional trains that are purchased online need to be validated. This validation must be done before your train departs and you'll incur a fine if your ticket isn't validated. Please click here for instructions on how to validate your regional tickets.\n\nNote that tickets for Trenitalia's high-speed trains do not need to be validated before boarding.\n\nValidating a Rail Pass\n\nOn the first day of travel, all people listed on the pass must go to the ticket office of the train station and have a ticketing official validate the pass. This is also called \"activating\" a pass. The station official should put a stamp on the pass.\n\nPlease note that the pass must be validated at the station before boarding your train - a conductor on a train cannot validate the pass. If you do not validate the pass, or if you tamper with the pass in any way, the conductor has the right to confiscate it, at which time, the unused part of the pass is non-refundable.\n\nHigh-speed trains in Italy require you to have a seat reservation booked in advance to boarding a train or you could be kicked out of the train. You can book your high-speed seats anywhere on our site.\n\nReturn to FAQ page.\n\nTickets or e-tickets and seat reservations are not the same thing in Italy, and you won't always need both. A ticket or e-ticket is what you need to travel from one city to another on any train in Italy, and it shows a seat reserved for the type of class and fare purchased. A seat reservation is what grants you a specific seat on that train and it must be issued for travellng in conjunction with a Rail Pass. All high speed trains in Italy require to have a seat reserved for a Rail Pass or a ticket/e-ticket with its seat assigned.\n\nIn Regional trains passengers travel without seat reservations, that means there's no assigned seating. You run the risk of standing if the train is full, however.\n\nWhen both a train ticket and a reservation are required, that means you're getting an assigned seat for the trip. Reservations are required on high-speed trains, overnight trains, and most long-haul routes.\n\nReturn to FAQ page.\n\nAn electronic or e-ticket is the newest reservation confirmation for booking reservations trains in Italy. This is exclusively available on trains that originate within Italy.\n\nUpon completing an e-ticket booking, you will receive an email confirmation of your train journey in place of the printed and shipped tickets. This email will include the booking confirmation code, referred to as a \"PNR,\" and the booking change code. This confirmation PNR will also include specific train information—date, time, number of passengers, fare code, and rules.\n\nAn e-ticket will either allow you to travel \"ticketless\"—boarding the train with only the PNR code—or will require you to check in before departure using the check-in link provided in the order confirmation email you will receive after purchase. Pay close attention to your email confirmations as the specific requirements of your train tickets are included\n\nReturn to FAQ page."
