        "text": "You could take a taxi or transfer service. If it’s that overwhelming, it would be worth it. If you’re traveling with others, you can split the cost.\n\nI hope you’re not flying in and departing the same day on a cruise. That could be a disaster if anything delays your flight.\n\nIf you decide to go by train, I would suggest giving yourself plenty of time between your arrival at Heathrow and when you need to leave on the bus/train. You will need to go through immigration, collect your luggage and go to the bus/train station. Both exist at the airport, but Heathrow is HUGE. You may need to take a train to get to a different terminal (or to the bus station) within the airport for the first leg of your bus/train journey to Portsmouth. It all depends on your flight time, train time, which terminal you arrive at, whether you take a bus or tube to the next train station, etc.\n\nFor simplicity, you might consider taking the bus. Explore this National Express coaches link to learn what your bus options are: https://www.nationalexpress.com/en\n\nYou need to know where you are going to arrive at Heathrow and where you need to arrive in Portsmouth. You may need to make a change along the way, but the driver can help you with that.\n\nYou can buy your ticket for the bus at Heathrow. There's no need to do that in advance. In fact, it's a better idea to not get it in advance in case the plane is late. Just ask where to go to do that when you arrive and get your luggage.\n\nI did this my last trip to England in 2016, only my destination was Bath. It was much easier than the often recommended bus/train options. And I loved riding on the bus through the countryside and towns along the way.\n\nNote that I did carry-on only, so I can't advise you on the particular details of getting from baggage claim to the bus station. It may be simpler or more complicated for you, depending on how how much luggage you have. I took the shuttle from my arrival location to the bus station. Again, just ask someone how to do that.\n\nThe bus station has a huuuge electronic board listing destinations, departure times and bus numbers. The busses are parked outside. It also has a very large and nice bathroom, a coffee shop with food and lots of seating.\n\nFinally, realize that you will be in an English-speaking country with lots of nice people to help you. You don't need to know every detail totally in advance. And no doubt some things will have changed in the 6 years since I was there.\n\nThe Central Bus Station images here might be useful.\n\nFirst of all, you can do this!\n\nThe easiest and most expensive option is a private transfer.\n\nThe slowest option is to take the bus the entire way.\n\nThe bus/train combination is the middle ground here. I am not confident the National Express bus to Woking is currently running and need one of our UK posters to weigh in here.\n\nYou tube is your friend here for being able to visualize how to find the bus station at Heathrow. Type in “how to catch the bus at Heathrow” or something similar in the you tube search box and several videos will pop up showing this. The airport website also has information. I will usually watch a few you tube videos to get a sense of the layout at airports.\n\nIf you are this nervous about getting to Portsmouth, and worried about making a mistake, my suggestion is to pre-arrange a car service from Heathrow to Portsmouth.\n\nThey will meet you as you exit the immigration/customs hall. They will escort you to the vehicle and then drop you in front of where you want to go in Portsmouth.\n\nThe next easiest of the bus. You take a National Express bus to London Victoria Coach Station and then transfer to another bus going to Portsmouth. Very easy to do. You find the bus stop just outside the entrance of your arriving terminal. There will be signs or you could just ask someone.\n\nhttp://www.nationalexpress.com\n\nThe train will include numerous changes and will be the most complicated.\n\nBus to Woking, one simple change onto the train at Woking, easy no-change train to Portsmouth.\n\nIf you help us understand where you want to go in Portsmouth we can get you there. At the moment we can't say which station to get off at or how to get the ferry to the Isle of Wight or Southampton for cruises or ...\n\nI agree that going into London's Victoria Coach Station saves no time and does not make for a more comfortable journey. Trains even have toilets and often tables.\n\nPlease tell us where you are trying to go to. It would also help a lot if you say what time of day your flight arrives (overnight for early morning arrival?) and what Terminal you are scheduled to arrive in or what airline.\n\nYou have been given some great advice. And for most, it is easy.\n\nBut......they are neglecting your concerns for not knowing what to do.\n\nSo I am going to repeat what i said, and what JC also noted.......get a private transfer. Yes, it will cost a bit more. But literally, you don't have to do anything after you book it. The driver will meet you as you exit the immigration and custom halls at Heathrow. He will know which terminal since you will tell them which airline and fight number you re on. He will also monitor your flight arrival information and will know if your flight is delayed, You then get dropped you wherever you want to go. Direct. No changes, no having to get from the Portsmouth train station to your final destination.\n\nNo worries about how and where to buy tickets. No worries about having to find the bus or the train. No having to lug your bags.\n\nHello all. Just to keep up updated. I was able to hire the private service that some of you recommended to drive me directly from London to Portsmouth. The driver, Scott, was there to greet me when I exited Immigration at the airport and was always communicating with me via WhatsApp.\n\nThey were excellent and I wish to pass on their contact info in case you all need it.\n\nI talked to Barbara via email and WhatsApp.\n\nSouth Coast Tours - [email protected]\n\n07538 280023\n\nShe assigned a wonderful driver : Scott. He was extremely nice, informative, and helpful. My experience with this company was outstanding.\n\nUpdate on my wonderful trip. The end result is that: I purchased a ticket to fly to London, UK, and returned to Miami From Barcelona. In London I hired an excellent service that took me directly to Portsmouth. I stayed at a B & B for two nights, and then boarded my cruise. Last port was Barcelona. I retrieved my rental car and spent 10 days exploring Spain, going also to Lourdes in France. The trip was absolutely wonderful, with great sights, adventures, and people. The last night before my flight I spent it in Barcelona. Took a bus to T1 at Barcelona airport to get tested for COVID, got my results in 15 minutes. Returned to my hotel. Got up very early, returned my rental car, and flew back home. I am blessed and thankful. Thank you all for all your responses."
