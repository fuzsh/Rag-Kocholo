A city bus stopped at a bus shelter in front of the train station then went on to close to the bus station in the centre of Burgos. You can see the Cathedral from there. I am not familiar with bus transport from Porto, but the rest of the trip is quite simple. The train and bus stations are now connected in Santiago.\n\nLast edited: Feb 11, 2022\n\nWanderingfriend\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2018\n\nFeb 11, 2022\n\n#8\n\nThank you.

I wonder why TAP airlines is showing flights from Canada if you can’t fly in. It also looks unclear whether Spain is allowing non EU people in as well.\n\nCanadians can fly to Portugal. There is just lack of clarity and a big confusion about whether Canadians (and others) can board a flight with just their vaccination passport or whether they need a vaccination passport and proof of a negative test. (Please: No links. I’ve seen them all).\n\nOfficial Spanish websites have much clearer language: Vaccinated travellers from around the world are allowed in.\n\nI agree with others: Fly to Madrid and then take a bus or train to Burgos. Easy and fast. Been there, done that.\n\nEdited following changes on official Portuguese websites since posting this comment.\n\nLast edited: Feb 12, 2022\n\nCorned Beef\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2024 Portuguese / VF (South) / VF GSB Pass (Done)\n\nFeb 11, 2022\n\n#11\n\nAnother one for Madrid. They make it easy but..\n\n.. just came back a couple of weeks ago from Madrid. Used the inter-terminal bus where we were almost nose-to-nose. Driver simply lets everyone on that wants to (and can fit).\n\nSo they will check you're vaccinated (as that is the law) and will make sure you are wearing a mask but the reality is that most people just want to get back to normal.\n\nAnd it will seem normal as the Madrid metro is exactly the same as the bus.\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nTo Santiago and back.

Driver simply lets everyone on that wants to (and can fit).\n\nOf course, if you arrive at terminal T4, you don't even have to use the inter-terminal bus. And on the Alsa bus from terminal T4 to Burgos (travel time: 2h30) you can block the seat next to you for a mere €5,82 which I think is something new.\n\nPierreB in\n\nNew Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFrances (2018)\n\nFeb 11, 2022\n\n#13\n\nI am flying from Vancouver Canada into Porto, Portugal and need to get to Burgos. Any ideas for the best way to do this currently.\n\nThe bus/train combination works OK. You can also get from Porto to Burgos by bus only, with a connection outside of Santiago (I cannot remember the name of the town). The benefits are: much cheaper fare and you disembark at the intermodal bus station in Burgos which is very near to the city center. Check online or enquire at the Porto bus terminal.\n\nWhen are you planning to arrive in Burgos?

The RE0Open Euro app, certainly makes it sound like travel is not open to non EU residents.

For some strange reason Canada is not on the list to fly in (even though our covid numbers are much lower per 100,000). Not sure what that is about.\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nTo Santiago and back.

I will look at the official Porteguese website.\n\nThe country information on Reopen-EU can only be as good as the information that each EU country provides to those who manage Reopen-EU. For Portugal it currently says:\n\nPortugal​\n\nWhat are the rules to enter this country from outside an EU Member State or Schengen Associated country?​\n\nEntry rules - arriving to mainland Portugal by air or by sea:​\n\nEssential and non-essential travel is allowed from Brazil, the United Kingdom and the United States.​\n\nAn updated list of countries with flights authorised for non-essential is available on visitportugal.com.​\n\n​\n\nSo this goes round in circles because you are sent to Visitportugal again. It's now already several days since the restrictions set by Portugal have been made easier. There ought to be feedback from actual travellers soon.\n\nLast edited: Feb 11, 2022\n\nWanderingfriend\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2018\n\nFeb 11, 2022\n\n#18\n\nI do not see mention of Canada here, nor on the visit portugal.
