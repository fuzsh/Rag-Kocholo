        "text": "I am a female solo traveler. Some of you may have thoughts of traveling alone but are hesitant to try. I am happy I did it before I turned 34.\n\nLike you, I was anxious. Believe me, I even questioned my decision a week before my flight. I had bad dreams, lol. If you’re planning to travel out of the country alone, I hope these few tips can help you get by (or encourage you a little if you think you are up for it!).\n\n1. Prioritise safety when choosing hotels\n\nI am on a budget so the rates really matter to me. I always have to find a middle ground in choosing a hotel that’s safe and affordable. It’s okay to camp a lot on the review section. Some comments that threw me off are how scary to walk at night since some hotels are located in the alley, how noisy the neighborhood is, a lot of self-service — some are unreasonable already, how old, dirty, and smelly the rooms are, and the like.\n\nI didn’t want to disclose my hotel since it’s not that good if you’re too particular about aesthetics and facilities. But it’s decent. Mine is located in Jung-nu but the buy-ins for me are the nearby bus stops, subway stops, and because it’s near the City Hall and Police Stations. It’s cheap too! It’s also near Seoul Station so the fare is cheap heading back and forth to the airport.\n\n3. Bring hike-ready shoes\n\nI was about to choose a hotel in Gangnam since most of my important tourist destinations are there (ARMYs, you can watch my Old Big Hit Entertainment building visit here). But the uphill roads in Gangnam, based on my research, made me choose other hotel options.\n\nStaying in Seoul for five days and visiting a lot of cities (you can watch the cities I visited here), I would think that most roads are uphill. It’s not just in Gangnam!! Make sure you wear comfortable shoes (or hike-ready) especially if you’ll do a lot of outdoor walks. When your map says it’s just a 5-minute walk, it may vary based on who you are. Hehe.\n\n4. Plan your route in advance\n\nAs a first-timer, my first move was to draw up my itinerary. Yup, I did DIY! I listed all the places that I wanted to visit with their address or cities, then I segmented all locations that are under the same cities. After that, I linked transpo direction going from one place to another. These apps are essential when planning your route: Naver Map, Rome2Rio, Kakao Map, and Kakao T. This is what my IT looks like:\n\nJust a note that some situations may affect your itinerary. I’ll tell you later why.\n\n5. Traveling from Incheon Airport to Seoul? Book AREX.\n\nAirport Railroad Express (AREX) is a convenient and quick option to Seoul. Once you land at Incheon, there are a lot of signs that will lead you to AREX so it’s easy and you won’t get lost. AREX has two options — All Stop [BLUE] and EXPRESS Stop [ORANGE]. Follow the orange signs and side to go to the express stop option. AREX EXPRESS Stop will take you straight to Seoul Station. You can book your one-way ticket from the Klook App. Read this article on how to book from Klook.\n\n6. Don’t put a lot on your T-money card\n\nPerhaps you’ve read a lot about the must-have T-money card in South Korea. Don’t put a lot of money in your T-money card if you think you’ll also use it for food stalls or restaurants other than transportation. I was excited so I put a lot of money in and even the cashier guy was surprised I deposited a lot of amount. Merp. I remember putting in 80,000 KWON (Php 3,400+) and I wasn’t able to consume it. I used it for 2–3 restaurants but my T-money card didn’t work. :(\n\nYou can definitely re-load it at any convenience store. I remember my T-Money card didn’t work in Sinsa Subway Station so a back-up T-money card will also do!\n\n7. Best place to shop? Hongdae.\n\nIn most of my department store visits in Seoul, I observed that shops are more leaning toward luxury items. So far in the places I visited, Insadong and Hongdae could be good tourist options, especially if you’re buying for your family. I like the lifestyle district in Hongdae. It’s very youthful and vibrant. I shopped mostly from M Playground where you’ll see the outfits that you see in KDRAMA. The style is very Jungkook-Gen-Z. There are other best places to shop in Myeongdong. Feel free to put your recommendations in the comment section so I can update this list and drop by on my next visit!\n\n8. Got lost? Do not panic. Download these apps:\n\nI got lost a lot of times! It’s normal! But my golden rule is: When in doubt, call a cab. Kakao T is key. Lol. Though some of us have a tight budget, we can use Kakao Maps or Google Maps to walk and find nearby bus stations. Some said that Google Maps doesn’t work in Seoul Korea. It does, but with limitations. It can’t provide you with a walking route. But if you’re already in Google Maps, it can detect where you are. The blue circle still follows your move. So if you see your destination if you look at it on the map, just move and you can see if you’re near the area. This is what I did when I was looking for the Old Big Hit Building in Gangnam.\n\nI got lost when I was in Hongdae and the bus stop was so far and the road that Naver Map was directing me was an uphill street. So no. Kakao T saved the day.\n\n9. Do not book from June to August\n\nWhat you read on the Internet about not going to Seoul in August is true. I thought my life in the Philippines prepared me for the heat wave. But it’s so humid. Next thing you know you’re drenched in sweat! There are places that I wasn’t able to go to because the heat made me exhausted early in the day. It’s also Monsoon season. My flight was canceled because of a Typhoon and it’s such a hassle rebooking your flight. I had to bump some arrangements at work and my budget was stirred. But why did I book it for August? Fan girl reasons.\n\nThere were also some holidays in August. When I visited it was the National Liberation Day of Korea. I was supposed to visit Gyeongbokgung Palace on that day but I moved it to the 16th. When I went to Gyeongbokgung Palace, the area was still closed since it was an extended holiday.\n\n10. Nice to know Hangul\n\nOf course, tourist spots have English translations. But not all. Some staff also couldn’t speak English that much. One of my comments as a tourist was their Naver Map is in Hangul. Kakao T doesn’t have a direct translation. I had to manually type the message (can’t copy-paste as well) of the driver before I understood his message. Good thing I know how to read and type Hangul since I studied Basic Korean. But if in case of a language barrier, you can use Naver Papago and just show your phone to the person you are asking to. There’s also a photo translator app that you can use. But wouldn’t it be nice for these apps to have an English setting?"
