        "text": "your other sources used to be right - it is a good value for travelling across the Continent. That is across. Lots of long or very long trips in a short period of time and you are singing. It used to be easier to make it pay. When I was much younger I had a 3 month Youth Eurailpass which didn't cost much and I used it to death, all over France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy - I was able to just jump on pretty much any train, no reservations in those days, and on trains at night I rode half way, woke up, walked across the platform and caught another going back and slept another few hours - free hotel. Alas those days are long gone, and in addition to the trains not playing ball I am a lot older. oh well\n\nWhat it is not good for is what you are doing - just a few medium sized trips, and travelling between Amsterdam and Paris, a killer on a Eurailpass.\n\nNo, there is no local transportation like buses, trams or metro/U-Bahn with a Eurailpass.\n\nThere are deals available on most of the trips you mention, you need to buy tickets ahead (just like the plane) and you can go for much less.\n\nMy old mentor at the Seat 61 site will guide you aright. Only use Rome2Rio to find out who the operator is (or operators are) of a particular route and the go to the official website of that company for tickets. As said above, resellers and Eurail only show a subset of available trains, and long established wisdom around here among people who know is that RailEurope is best stayed away from completely. They only sell tickets on some trains so only show those, and they mark up the tickets. If you have to deal with customer service for a refund they don't shine.\n\nIf you use any fast trains in France you can get discounts, sometimes steep discounts, from SNCF, the French national railways, who now operate under several brands (and who happen to part own RailEurope) but if you have a Eurailpass which covers the fast train in France you STILL have to pay a fee (called a reservation, but reservations are included with normal tickets, even dirt cheap ones) to use that train. That amount varies depending on which fast train, the day of the week, and the route, but often the fee approaches the price of the cheap tickets. It is even worse for \"reservations\" on Thalys trains who have all the trains between Amsterdam and Paris. In many cases you can get cheap tickets for less than the fee you have to pay to use your Eurailpass.\n\nBut as said above, if money is worth less to you than figuring out and buying the tickets then they can be very useful.\n\nI've been told repeatedly by multiple people Europass is the cheapest way to travel across the Continent,\n\nTypical, your friends don't know what they are talking about. Either they are telling you what they have heard from other people, or people who have traveled with the Eurail Pass and just assumed they were getting a good deal, rather than, as you have done, checked on line for what individual tickets actually cost. Even the Rick Steves organization pushes them because they make a commission on the sale.\n\nSounds like you are really try to stretch your money on this trip. It looks like you have already eliminated Switzerland from this trip as you had a lot of questions previously.\n\nOne comment, Krakow is a bit of an outlier on this itinerary. If you use the Deutsche Bahn website, https://www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml, it will show you all the train schedules, although they can only sell tickets that begin or end within Germany. I see there is a direct train from Vienna to Krakow, but it is 5 3/4 hours, and the direct train from Krakow to Prague is 7 3/4 hours. You asked about spending more than a day in Berlin, and you got answers that 3 was barely enough. So maybe budget more time there. It is not an expensive city, compared tp Amsterdam or Paris and there is tons to see and do.\n\nSo I think your issue is that you are looking at the 3 week continuous pass. The continuous passes pretty much never recoup their value unless you plan to travel every single day. For your trip a 7 day in 1 month pass would work perfect and right now that one is on sale for $371 (adult passes) which averages out to $53/ticket. The pass does cover intercity trains but not buses. Train tickets in Central Europe are fairly cheap, and your distances are short, so I don’t really see you getting the value back by using a pass. In 2019 I got a first class ticket (there were 3 classes) from Prague to Vienna and it set me back a whopping $23. Trains from Paris to Amsterdam can get pricey though if you don’t book well enough in advance. Passes are really only a cheap way to travel if you’re youth fare, you’re traveling long term (2-3 months) and you want to cover a lot of distance. Or if Eurail is having a decent sale. For example, I bought a pass when they were having a 20% sale in March. It is the 15 day in 2 month pass and I got it for roughly $433 which makes each travel day less than $30. Considering I can take as many trains as I want on a travel day, I will easily get that value back. So Eurail CAN be very cost effective but I would say 9 times out of 10, it is not.\n\nThat all depends on your traveling style and the length and breath of the trip.\n\nIf you are going for at least a month or more and your rail pass is at least 10 days /2 months, plus you're willing to take night trains without the additional luxury of a sleeper or couchette, (you pay extra for those, just do without this feature), ie, sleep sitting upright, as you see Europeans do on night trains, then the rail pass will be cheap. You get max use out of the pass.\n\nFrom what I see in the cities list, you have the night train option for Berlin-Budapest, Vienna to Berlin, Vienna to Prague, etc...all a matter of scheduling and timing the trip. With your itinerary, I could plan out a trip using a few night train rides with the rail pass.\n\nThe rail pass is valid on the S-Bahn in Berlin, say , you arrive on the night train in Berlin, take the S-Bahn to your hotel, it's covered. Then you decide to do a day trip to Lutherstadt Wiittenberg on the ICE or Leipzig on the same day (your arrival in Berlin), this day is covered but only for this day. There are ways to stretch the value of the Pass."
