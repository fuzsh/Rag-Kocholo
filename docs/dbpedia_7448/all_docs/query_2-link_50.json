Australia in Oceania is known for its travelling culture so wherever you choose to start travelling you’re guaranteed to meet others en route.\n\nBackpacking Australia solo is really popular, especially along the East Coast which is famous for its party atmosphere. Because of its ease, many gap-year and younger travellers choose to visit here to experience life down under before entering the job market.\n\nIf you are wondering “is Australia safe to travel to alone?” Then the answer is yes. Travelling solo in Australia as a woman is fine as most people are friendly but be prepared for some strange souls in the outback, especially in Katherine and Tenant Creek.\n\nAustralia has an outdoor lifestyle, barbecues on the beach, sporty lifestyle. There are so many rural areas and beaches and it gives you a chance to cut off from your previous world and have time for yourself, to think about a career change, think about changing your life, a different path or to start something new.\n\nAustralia has the power to bring so much harmony and power back into your life because it’s so natural with so much space. You can choose to share with people who you just meet or keep it to yourself. You have the freedom and the space for personal growth, to think about what you really want from life and learn all about yourself on the road.\n\nOz is great for first-time solos as there are endless supplies of hostels and hotels and everyone speaks English. It really is a traveller’s dream but if you prefer your Australia sightseeing with others, there are plenty of solo travel companies in Australia to go with.\n\n* Before you travel, check what paperwork or visas are required for Australia.\n\nVolunteering & Working in Australia\n\nIf you are thinking of volunteering in Australia, Global Work & Travel helps you to organise a working holiday in Australia and around the world. Choose from au pairing in Australia, an IT or marketing internship in Australia, volunteering with marine conservation and so many more.\n\nThey even offer an eco-tourism internship! Whether you want to au pair Sydney, au pair Melbourne or experience one of their business internships, their placements are ideal for solos and include all the support you need for a life-changing adventure. * Save £100/$100/€100 with the code ‘GatG.’ * Check availability for volunteering & working in Australia placements\n\nBest Places For Australia Solo Travel\n\nEast Coast Australia\n\nYou can’t get much further from home than Australia and a trip down under is ideal for solo travel. It has sun, sand and plenty of surfer dudes to keep you entertained but with so many territories to see, where do you start? Follow our list of places to visit in Australia to help you to plan your trip.\n\nWhen you solo travel Australia, if you like to party and meet other travellers then the East coast is one of the popular places in Australia to begin. As one of the best places to travel alone in Australia, you can fly into Cairns and travel down the Queensland coast.\n\nCairns is also the gateway to Northern Australia where the rainforest meets the sea and from here you can explore Cape Tribulation which is one of the locations in Australia that is home to thousands of mammals, reptiles and plants. Spend an evening in an eco-lodge to get back in touch with nature.\n\nThings To Do in Queensland\n\nTake the scenic railway through the Daintree National Park, see the waterfalls at Atherton Tablelands or take a stroll at the Mossman Gorge then relax at Cow Bay or the Four Mile Beach at Port Douglas. * Read: Exploring The Daintree Forest in Australia\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef runs along the Queensland coast and is one of the most famous places in Australia. The reef is a metropolis of coral and underwater life but due to many factors such as overfishing, coral mining, and tourism in Australia, the reef has suffered damage.\n\nThere are introductory dives available for those who want to experience the reef for the first time from Fitzroy or Green Island (but be careful not to touch the reef). Or you may prefer to take a scenic flight above it instead.\n\nOnce you’ve experienced this Wonder of the World, head South for the real Australia where you can sample some Bundaberg rum in the fruit-picking region of Bundaberg.\n\nMagnetic Island\n\nMagnetic Island, Australia, is a boat away from Townsville and they say that once you come here, you won’t want to leave. It’s a great place to hire a moke (a golf cart) and drive around the island. See the secluded beach of Radical Bay and the dairy-free ice-cream parlour, or explore the island on horseback.\n\nFraser Island & The Whitsundays\n\nFraser Island is a definite must-see. It's a huge sand island with stunning lakes where you can drive a 4WD along the beach. This is more of a camping experience but beware of the dingos and the tiger sharks. You do need to do a tour to see the best of the island. Find the best Fraser Island tours here.\n\nAnother of Australia's best places to visit is Whitehaven Beach, one of the most beautiful beaches in the world and you can see manta rays swimming along the shoreline. This beach in the Whitsundays is also an ideal spot to clean any dull-looking jewellery in crystal clear waters.\n\nExperience the great nightlife at Airlie Beach then take a sailing trip around the islands of the Whitsundays. It really is one of the most stunning places you will ever see.\n\nBrisbane & The Gold Coast\n\nCompared to the rest of the country, there aren't that many things to do in Brisbane but one of the must-do's is to visit the late Steve Irwin’s Brisbane Zoo and Riverside Park. Brisbane is also home to Moreton Island, one of the largest sand islands in the world. This island with pristine beaches and a shipwreck is the place for the adventurous solo as you can snorkel in its waters, go kayaking on a transparent kayak and sand board down huge dunes. You can take a tour from Brisbane to visit it.\n\nIf you need more nightlife and some surfing then Surfers Paradise is one of the best places to travel solo in Australia for surfing Girls about the Globe. This coastal city is the place to be with its ‘Miami feel’ and is the place to visit on the Gold Coast for plenty of fun and sun.\n\nOne of the things to do in Australia's Gold Coast is taking a ride in the many theme parks. Choose from Dreamworld, Movie World, or Wet ‘n’ Wild. Stay in a hostel to find others willing to come along for the ride.\n\nVisit Noosa, Byron Bay, and Nimbin\n\nJust north of Brisbane is a region called Noosa with secluded beaches and cute arty shops with plenty of restaurants around Hastings Street. The main beach is great for swimming and there are no stingers here.\n\nIf you prefer the hippy scene, visit Byron Bay for its incredibly laid-back vibe or take a trip to Nimbin the ‘alternative capital of Australia’ for its arty, colourful community and lost souls. This area is great if you are backpacking Australia alone as you will meet other travellers here too. Plus, you can see Bryon's Bay iconic lighthouse and spot dolphins and turtles if you take a sea kayaking adventure.\n\nVictoria\n\nVictoria is the next territory and is known for its variety of sporting events. Melbourne hosts the Australian Open, the Grand Prix, Melbourne Cup and Aussie Rules football at the MGM. It is also the fashion capital of Australia and is great for shopping and back-street cafe culture but you’ll need a local to find its exclusive, hidden nightlife.\n\nTake some time to walk along the riverbank and enter Queen Victoria Market, the city's iconic market and the largest open-air market in the Southern Hemisphere. Visit the Royal Botanic Gardens, the Melbourne Museum, and the National Gallery of Victoria, before shopping at Chapel Street then while away your evenings at one of the bars or restaurants in Brunswick or Fitzroy.\n\nYou may feel more at home in Melbourne with its four seasons in one day but if you’re looking for more of a holiday feel, take the tram to St Kilda where you can sit al fresco and watch people rollerblading along the promenade.\n\nYou don't have to go far outside the city to experience some nature. Just 35 km outside of Melbourne are the Dandenong Ranges, mountain ranges with tall forests and waterfalls and a 1000 Steps Walk for the active GatG. Other places to see in Victoria include the town of Olinda, a popular town with forest walks and cafes and restaurants but it can get busy on the weekends.\n\nIf you love wildlife, this region is the place to see the world's smallest penguins and koalas too. You can take a day trip to see the Philip Island Koala Reserve and penguin parade which also stops at Nobbies National Park to see volcanic formations and Seal Rocks. * Check rates & availability for the tour\n\n* Read: Things To Do in Melbourne Solo\n\nThe Great Ocean Road\n\nOne of the things to do in Melbourne, Australia, is taking a road trip along the Great Ocean Road, one of Australia’s epic drives. Bells Beach is en route and has great point breaks and was the setting of the film with the same name.\n\nStop off at Port Campbell National Park to see the Loch Ard Gorge and London Bridge. The Twelve Apostles are one of the well-known sites on the route and the best way to see this iconic drive if you don't hire a car is on a Great Ocean Road day tour.\n\nOff the coast of Melbourne is Tasmania, one of the lesser-known tourist attractions in Australia. In reality, there is so much to see in Tasmania that we've given it its own page. Read Solo Travel in Tasmania here.\n\nNew South Wales\n\nIf you're wondering where the best place to spend a week in Australia is then the answer is of course, Sydney. Sydney lies in New South Wales and although it is not the country’s capital it has everything you would expect to find in one.\n\nAustralia’s actual capital, Canberra, is 250km inland. If you do make it to Canberra, the Parliament Building is the main focal point of the city which overlooks the lake but don't make the long trip here expecting too much as the capital is very understated.\n\nPlaces To Visit in Sydney\n\nThere is much to see and do in Sydney, and the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Opera House are must sees for day tours in Sydney. Take a boat ride around the harbour or travel across to Taronga Zoo for spectacular pictures of giraffes against a Sydney backdrop.\n\nThere are so many other things to do in Sydney, Australia, such as a Rocks walking tour, kayak to Goat Island, visit the Chinese Garden or take a tour to the Blue Mountains, named after the blue haze from the eucalyptus trees.\n\nTIP – If you are planning to solo female travel in Sydney for a few nights, consider purchasing the Sydney Attraction Pass to save money. Choose from 4 of Sydney’s best sites and save up to 45% compared to buying the tickets separately. * Buy the Sydney Attraction Pass here\n\nSydney's Beaches\n\nDarling Harbour at dusk is the perfect place to people-watch and has some great bars. If you prefer somewhere more upmarket, Woolloomooloo has swanky restaurants and plenty of yachts to admire.\n\nIf you like markets, you’ll love Paddington market which is reminiscent of Covent Garden with arty stalls. One of the favourite things to do in Australia is surf and Bondi is the most popular of the beaches but the waves of Coogee, Manly and Bronte are just as good. Dee Why Beach is lesser known and is a great escape from the crowds.\n\nOnly a 2.5 hour drive from Sydney is Port Stephans, a place that feels a world away from the city. With giant sand dunes and the opportunity to spot dolphins and whales, it feels like a hidden gem in the country.\n\nSouth Australia\n\nAdelaide is the capital of South Australia and there is a lot to do both in and around this city which has a country-town feel. Things to do in Adelaide include getting out into the Adelaide Hills to see waterfalls, fairytale villages and the world’s largest rocking horse.\n\nSample wines at the Barossa Valley and see how chocolate is made in the chocolate factory, and camp overnight at Wilpena Pound, a natural amphitheatre within the Flinders Rangers. It’s a unique experience and you need an entry permit to enter the park.\n\nOther places to visit in South Australia include the beach-side suburb of Glenelg where you will find great restaurants after a day of sunbathing on the beach. If you don’t enjoy having tan lines as you sunbathe, Maslin Beach is a popular nudist beach.\n\nKangaroo Island\n\nKangaroo Island is a natural Australia attraction and is only 90 minutes from the mainland, reachable via Adelaide. Over a third of Kangaroo Island are nature reserve but the island was badly affected by the wildfires in 2020.\n\nThe East side of the island is still open for Australia tourism and you can get up close and personal with seals on Seal Bay or join a wildlife safari to learn about Australian wildlife.\n\nSee Admirals Arch, the Remarkable Rocks, and the lighthouse at Flinders Chase National Park on the west side of Kangaroo Island. There are tours that take you from Adelaide to Kangaroo Island. Discover the best Kangaroo Island tours here.\n\nThings To Do in Perth\n\nFrom Adelaide, you can travel by train on the Ghan across the outback to the Red Centre, home to many Aborigines, or to the modern city of Perth via the Indian Pacific railway. Perth doesn't have that many of Australia's tourist attractions but is popular with ex-pats and there are some great beaches such as Cottesloe and Scarborough.\n\nKings Park in Perth is a tranquil place to relax and see black swans, or you can take one of the popular day trips and drive three hours south of the city to Margaret River where you can visit vineyards and wineries, cycle along the river or even surf. Perth is worth seeing if you have the time as it’s a long way from the rest of the country.\n\nFremantle, Perth, is a vibrant little city with buzzing markets but the main attraction has got to be the old prison, which gives you an eye-opening tour of prison life. Don't forget to visit Rottnest Island either where you can cycle around the wildlife nature reserve and spot the quokkas that live there.\n\nNorthern Territory\n\nWhen you stray away from the cities into the more male-dominated outback, you may find you get more attention as a woman travelling solo and being whistled at is not uncommon. If you don’t mind the attention, it’s worth a trip to see the real Australia.\n\nYou shouldn’t miss Coober Pedy, the world’s only underground town where you can sleep in an abandoned mine shaft. Near Coober Pedy is the Kanku-Breakaways Conservation Park with colourful mounds and stunning landscapes.\n\nThe Red Centre is steeped in Aboriginal culture and resembles a scene out of the Flintstones. Learn how to throw a boomerang, ride in a hot air balloon or play the didgeridoo at Alice Springs.\n\nUluru (Ayres Rock)\n\nThings to do at Ayres Rock include visiting the Flying Doctors Museum or the reptile centre to learn more about Australia’s snakes and lizards. Then it’s onto the wonder that is Ayres Rock or Uluru, as known by the Aborigines at Kata Tjuta National Park.\n\nAustralia has thousands of national parks but this sacred rock is one of the largest Australia attractions and can be reached by a six-hour drive or a flight.\n\nThere has been much controversy about climbing the rock but a walk around the burial caves and ancient art paintings at the base is a good substitute. Don’t forget to include a trip to Kings Canyon (the setting for the movie, Priscilla Queen of the Desert), and the Olgas when you go.\n\nThings To Do in Darwin\n\nHead north to Darwin, the capital of the Northern Territory and the gateway to Lichfield or Kakadu National Park where you can see crocodiles and wetlands, and hire a bike at Katherine Gorge to cycle to the springs.\n\nYou don't have to go far to see a crocodile as Darwin is home to Crocosaurus Cove, one of Australia's tourist attractions, where you can experience one of the scariest things in Australia; diving with the crocodiles.\n\nIf you prefer to keep your feet on the ground and are wondering what to do in Darwin, there are plenty of art galleries showcasing indigenous art, and museums such as the Darwin Military Museum to keep you entertained. If you are going to the Northern Territory it’s worth investing in a fly net for this tropical climate.\n\nTennant Creek is an odd little place and half of its population are aborigines. If you can handle the strangeness it’s worth a stop to see the Devil's Marbles, an important site from the Dreamtime or visit Kalgoorlie for a real gold rush town.\n\nWestern Australia\n\nCruise past the rugged red cliffs of the Kimberley region then west to Broome, Australia, known for its pearling industry to drive a 4×4 along the northern stretch of Cable Beach. Many people skip this region but if you have the time it is worth travelling to. Nambung National Park is where you'll find the Pinnacles Desert, an area of pointy formations made out of limestone.\n\nFinally…\n\nTravel Australia alone and you'll have so many adventures. There are so many attractions in Australia and things to do from sleeping under the stars in a swag to experiencing a hot sunny Christmas.\n\nIf you decide to spend the Christmas holidays in Australia you may be lucky enough to catch a glimpse of Santa jet skiing along Sydney Harbour. Tour Australia and you'll soon discover that there really is no other place like it.\n\nTours in Australia\n\nBest Tours to Australia For Solos\n\nG Adventures Tours Australia – With Australia being such a sociable country, you’ll never be short of company travelling Australia alone.

No matter what time of day you go, you’ll be blessed with a great panorama but it's recommended to pre-book your tour as this is one of the Australian activities that you don't want to miss. * Book Sydney Harbour Bridge climb\n\n6. Go Whale Watching in Hervey Bay\n\nIf you’ve ever wanted to see whales up close, whale watching is a must do in Australia. This experience is led by marine naturalists who tell you everything about whale behaviour during your trip. You can listen to live whale songs underwater and there is also a whale researcher onboard to help with any questions. The best thing about this experience is that whale sightings are guaranteed or you will receive a free ticket for another day. * Book Hervey Bay whale watching experience\n\n7. Wine Tasting in Barossa Valley\n\nIf you love wine, a trip to Barossa Valley should definitely be on your solo Australia wish list. This day trip makes it easy for you to go wine tasting as it’s travelling by coach. You'll experience wine tastings at three wineries and enjoy lunch in this famous region before heading to the Adelaide Hills and learning more about the region’s German heritage. * Book Barossa Valley tour\n\n8. Cycle Rottnest Island\n\nThis little island off the coast of Perth is the perfect place for cycling. It takes 3.5 hours to peddle around this wildlife nature reserve spotting wildlife as you go. The island is only 4km wide and has secluded bays and unspoilt beaches. It’s a great day out and just a ferry ride from Perth or Fremantle. This tour includes your ferry ticket and bike hire. Just remember to pack some food and water. * Book Rottnest Island ferry & bike trip from Perth or Fremantle\n\n9. Snorkel The Great Barrier Reef\n\nYou can't take an Australia solo trip and not see one of the Seven Wonders of The World. Green Island is one of the islands in The Great Barrier Reef with transparent waters and a colourful reef. Snorkelling is the best way to see the marine life but if you prefer to stay dry then you can discover the reef from a glass bottom boat instead.\n\nThe trip also takes you to the island’s rainforest. Snorkelling the Great Barrier Reef is one of the best things in Australia to experience. The boat departs from Cairns. * Book Green Island reef catamaran cruise\n\n10. Climb Sand Dunes on Fraser Island\n\nThere’s a reason that this island is World Heritage listed. As the largest sand island in the world, it is begging to be explored. Cruise the Great Sandy Strait spotting dolphins, turtles and even a dingo or two. You may even spot humpback whales off the shores. If you are an active GatG you can snorkel, kayak, go tubing or just climb the sand dunes. Tours depart from Hervey Bay. * Book Fraser Island tour from Hervey Bay\n\nAustralia Solo Travel Itinerary\n\nIf you are hoping to see all of Australia’s sites in a single trip it can be difficult to achieve unless you have plenty of time. Most people when they solo travel in Australia start with Sydney and travel their way up the coast. You'll find more travellers along this route so pairing up with others is more likely than venturing to the Northern Territory alone.\n\nIf you are planning first-time travel to Australia, we recommend these routes for your Australia Itinerary. For a cultural experience, you have to visit the Red Centre (Alice Springs and Ayres Rock) to learn more about the Aboriginal culture and help support indigenous groups.\n\nWithin a two-week Australia vacation, you also can travel from Adelaide to Darwin or Sydney to Cairns. Below are two itinerary ideas for two weeks in Australia.\n\na) Sydney – 5 nights, Alice Springs – 4 nights, Cairns – 4 nights (to visit the Great Barrier Reef).\n\nb) Melbourne – 3 nights, Tasmania – 3 nights, Sydney – 5 nights, Uluru – 3 nights.\n\nBest Backpacks For Australia\n\nAustralia is such a wonderful country for backpacking. If you're wondering whether to take a suitcase or a backpack, I definitely recommend a backpack if you are planning on visiting a few destinations within the country.\n\nI have the Caribee Jet Pack 65 which opens like a suitcase. It makes it easier for me to find everything that I have packed rather than having a top loader. I store all my clothes in the big section and my shoes and toiletries in the smaller compartment. My first aid kit gets packed in the pouch. It’s easy to spot on the baggage carousel too. Find out why I recommend it below.\n\nClick here for all our recommended backpacks for solos\n\nCaribee Jet Pack 65\n\n“My backpack is a Caribee bag. I was looking for a bag that zipped completely open. There is a strap which fits around my waist when I’m walking and it comes with a small daypack that zips onto it which is perfect for checking in on my luggage on a plane and keeping a smaller bag with me for my hand luggage. It even has a rain cover which kept everything dry during the rainy seasons. I’ve had it for years and it’s been to numerous countries with me.” – Lisa Eldridge\n\n* Click here for Amazon.com / Click here for Amazon.co.uk\n\nTravel Accessories For Australia\n\nIf you’re unsure what to pack for your solo trip to Australia, we have created a guide of our favourite solo travel products to help you decide what to pack.

Australia is in the Northern Hemisphere, meaning the seasons are opposite to Europe so you can escape a European winter.\n\nThere are still plenty of things to see in Australia no matter what time of year you visit. Because the country is so vast, each region differs in a climate so there is always somewhere to see depending on your interests.\n\nIf it's hot that you're after, one of the best places to visit in Australia is the Northern Territory which is known for being hot and humid year-round.\n\nIf you love festivals, Adelaide is one of the best places in Australia to visit in March due to its various festivals such as the Adelaide Fringe, and Art Festival. If you visit during the wet season (December to February), beware of box jellyfish in the sea. Stinger suits are provided if you intend to snorkel.\n\nThis chart shows the average maximum day temperatures for Sydney (from January to December) to help you plan your Australia travels. Find out the weather for other areas here.\n\nTravel Insurance For Australia\n\nTravelling alone in Australia is safe but travel insurance is always recommended, especially if you will be doing any active sports or venturing into the Outback. I recommend True Traveller for UK and European residents, and World Nomads for U.S. and worldwide citizens.\n\nTrue Traveller and World Nomads are two insurance companies which can cover travel to Australia. True Traveller is available to UK and European residents, and World Nomads is available to over 100 countries worldwide, including the USA and UK. For digital nomads, Safety Wing is a nomad insurance that covers people from all over the world.\n\nAll companies allow you to buy insurance when you are already on the road and offer different plans depending on your needs including additional adventure cover.\n\n* Check insurance cover and prices for True Traveller\n\nN.b.

Climbing Ayres Rock used to be one of the top things to do in Australia. The Aboriginals have since won the right to keep this rock sacred. Instead, there’s a base walk that you can walk around. If there are signs asking you not to photograph Aboriginal sites refrain from taking pictures.\n\nBuy Aboriginal art from cultural centres and ask permission before you take any photos of their crafts or the people.\n\nAustralia is known for its unique wildlife but don't try and touch or feed the animals, and don’t use your flash so that you can protect the animal’s eyes.\n\nDon’t have your photo taken with a koala or snake around your neck and avoid any staged animal shows such as crocodile shows.\n\nOne of the must sees in Australia is visiting the Great Barrier Reef, one of the Seven Wonders of the World. If you do visit here, be careful not to touch the coral in the reef. Respect the ocean if you choose to dive, snorkel or swim in it.\n\nSocial Impact Programs\n\nLentil As Anything – This not-for-profit vegan restaurant is in four locations in Australia. With the slogan ‘food without borders,’ they aim to care for people and provide a wholesome and nutritious meal.\n\nGuests pay what they can for meals and also use food that otherwise would have gone to a landfill. The restaurant trains volunteers such as those who are long-term unemployed, migrants and refugees and help them to find paid work.\n\nStay Eco\n\nDaintree Crocodlyus Village – For the Eco Girl about the Globe, Daintree Crocodylus Village is located deep within the Daintree rainforest, less than 2 miles from Cow Bay Beach. This Daintree accommodation feels more like being on safari with tent rooms that come with either a private or shared veranda.\n\nThere is a cafe onsite and a games room so you can challenge one of the guests to a game of pool as an ice-breaker. Choose from a jungle double with a shared bathroom, a tropical cabin, a rainforest bungalow or a safari hut. There are also beds in a 4-bed mixed dormitory room for those on a budget.\n\n* To book, check prices or availability for Daintree Crocodlyus Village\n\nDaintree Ecolodge is also in the Daintree Rainforest.
