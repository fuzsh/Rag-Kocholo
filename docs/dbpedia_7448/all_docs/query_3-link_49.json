        "text": "What sort of walking can I expect?\n\nThe fitness level of this trip is Grade 3. The walking is reasonably demanding: there are no free days. If you intend to walk the full 225 Miles to Rome (to include Tuscan Hills and Ancient Volcanic Landscapes), you should consider the overall Grade to be 5 (the highest level), due to the sheer volume of walking. You need stamina to complete the route all the way to Rome.\n\nPlease note: The Romans rested ‘every four days’. If you plan to walk more than one section of the ‘225 Miles’ we strongly urge you to book some rest days in to your itinerary, at least between the sections. Please contact the office for advice.\n\nThe paths are varied: Etruscan roads, Roman roads, mule paths, wooded paths, cart tracks and dirt roads. There are no vertiginous walks. The final walk in to Rome is (unavoidably) along a main artery (but still the Via Cassia) in to the centre.\n\nThe last stretch as you enter the city over the Tiber and in to the centre is momentous. However, there are plenty of public transport options for those who would prefer to simply skip the last walk and be deposited at St Peter’s! Bus times and locations of bus stops near the route (also trains for the route in to Rome) can be provided by the Route Manager if you would like to walk only part of the way on any day.\n\nThis is an 8-day trip with walks offered on 6 days. Walk lengths vary from 2.5 hours (optional walk on Day 1) to a maximum of 8 hours of walking. Hours of walking, which may vary from individual to means hours of actual walking and does not include stops for lunch, sightseeing, rests or siestas. On certain days the walk takes you into the hills where the paths cross a more rugged terrain that may be muddy in wet weather – please make sure that your foot­wear provides sufficient ankle support.\n\nHow do I get to the start of the route?\n\nThese travel notes are regularly checked for accuracy, both by ATG and via much-valued client feedback.\n\nLike all travel and transport arrangements, however, they may be subject to change. For up-to-the-minute information please check online.\n\nNote about train travel in Italy: Most journeys can be booked online and we recommend doing so if you are will be travelling long-distance, e.g. Rome-Florence; Milan-Venice. These are Frecciarossa, Frecciargento, Frecciabianca & InterCity trains. Booking ahead for such journeys can be considerably cheaper! There is no need to book ahead for shorter, regional journeys, e.g. Florence – Siena, and we wouldn’t recommend doing so as regional tickets are non-refundable, non-changeable.\n\nSee here for a useful guide to train travel in Italy:\n\nwww.seat61.com/train-travel-in-italy\n\nTimetables and advance purchase of tickets:\n\nwww.italiarail.com\n\nwww.raileurope.com\n\nwww.thetrainline.com\n\nwww.trenitalia.com\n\nAll European train timetables: www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml\n\nInternational travel – how to get to/from anywhere: www.rome2rio.com\n\nTRAVEL TO ITALY\n\nThe recommended destination airports for this route are Rome Fiumicino and Rome Ciampino. From both airports there are frequent connections to central Rome (see below).\n\nTRAVEL TO THE FIRST HOTEL BY PUBLIC TRANSPORT\n\nFrom Fiumicino airport\n\nIf you are travelling directly to Viterbo from the airport, do not take the Leonardo Express shuttle train that runs from the airport to Roma Termini station in Rome’s city centre, but instead take the metropolitan train FL1/FM1 (left-hand rail track at the airport station) which offers regular departures (every 15 minutes, 30 minutes on public holidays) for the metropolitan stations of Rome, including Roma Ostiense (€14, journey time 32 minutes).\n\nThere are very frequent services Roma Ostiense to Viterbo - hourly Mon-Sat and every two hours on a Sunday. The journey takes 1.5-2 hours and costs €5-€8.\n\nPlease note: There are two stations in Viterbo: Porta Fiorentina (the principal station), from where it is a 10-minute walk to the first hotel; and Porta Romana (17-minute walk). See ‘First Hotel’ for directions.\n\nIn most instances, to reach Porta Fiorentina you will need to change trains at Porta Romana.\n\nThere may be other services from other stations in Rome that suit your circumstances better, according to your location/plans prior to the trip. There are also some direct trains from Roma Ostiense to Porta Fiorentina but the timetable is more limited. We recommend you check options at www.trenitalia.com.\n\nFrom Ciampino Airport:\n\nThere are no direct rail links between Ciampino and Roma Ostiense (if you wish to travel direct to Viterbo) so you will need to travel via Roma Termini (the central Rome train station)\n\nThere are shuttle buses to Roma Termini operated by Terravision (www.terravision.eu) and SIT (www.sitbusshuttle.com). If you buy your ticket online it will cost €5.50 return, slightly more if you buy on the bus or at the airport/ station. Buses leave regularly from outside the departures terminal, journey time 40 minutes.\n\nNote: There is not a ticket counter selling bus tickets at Ciampino airport. You should simply go outside the terminal and look for the buses/their agents selling tickets.\n\nA taxi journey from Ciampino to Roma Ostiense (or Roma Termini, or anywhere within Rome walls) is a very reasonable (approx) €30 for up to 4 passengers. The taxi rank is outside the terminal.\n\nThe closest train station to Ciampino airport is “Ciampino”, which you can reach by bus (every 30 mins; cost €1, journey 5 mins) or taxi. From Ciampino station there are very frequent train services to Roma Termini, journey time is approximately 15mins and costs €1.30. Services to the other central stations take between 45 minutes-1 hour as they are not direct.\n\nFrom Roma Termini there are regular services to Viterbo. The journey takes 1 hour 45mins-2.5 hours and costs €5.60-€8.40. Please note: There are two stations in Viterbo: Porta Fiorentina (the principal station), from where it is a 10-minute walk to the first hotel; and Porta Romana (17-minute walk). See ‘First Hotel’ for directions.\n\nPlease remember to validate any train ticket you purchase in Italy before you board the train by stamping it in the green and white or yellow machines at the entrance to the platform.\n\nFirst Hotel\n\nNotes to reach the first hotel from the train stations are provided in your route book.\n\nTaxis\n\nWe can book you a taxi to the first hotel. The taxi from Rome Fuimicino airport holds 3-4 passengers (depending on luggage),\n\ntakes 1 hr 40 mins and costs approx €180. A taxi from Rome Ciampino airport to Viterbo takes 1.5 hrs and costs approx\n\n€180. A taxi from either station Porta Romana or Porta Fiorentina costs €10.Prices may alter at weekends, Bank Holidays or late at night.\n\nTaxi bookings\n\nPlease place your booking with the ATG office at least two weeks before departure. The cost of the taxi will be confirmed to you once the booking is secured. Payment of the taxi fare should be made locally, not to ATG. The driver will have your flight details and will be waiting in Arrivals with a sign showing your name or ATG.\n\n• If you change your flight please notify us so we can contact the taxi company to reschedule the taxi for you.\n\n• If, on the day of departure, your flight is cancelled or you miss or change it, please immediately contact the ATG emergency number (number is provided in trip documentation) so we can contact the taxi company to reschedule or cancel the taxi for you.\n\n• If your flight is delayed and you have arranged for the taxi to meet you at the destination airport, your taxi driver will wait for you.\n\n• If you are delayed and you have arranged for a taxi to meet you at a non airport location (e.g. train station) it is essential that you contact your Route Manager or call the ATG emergency\n\nline to notify us at the earliest possible moment, so we can contact the taxi company to re-schedule or cancel the taxi for you.\n\n• Please note that failure to advise ATG that you cannot meet the taxi booked for you, may result in the taxi costs being passed back to you.\n\nImportant: Taxi prices quoted apply to the local firm used regularly by ATG – and are guaranteed only if you book through the office in advance. If you get a taxi off a taxi rank please ask the driver to confirm the price for the journey before departing.\n\nNote\n\nWhilst ATG provides travel information that is accurate at the time of publication this may be subject to change, international flights may be delayed, national and regional transport systems may be subject to expedient alterations (whether timetables, or local engineering works). Information regarding such changes is available online.\n\nApart from flights or taxis booked through ATG, the Company has little or no knowledge of clients’ independent plans and arrangements prior to their arrival.\n\nPlease check flight, train or bus timetables for the most up-to-date information prior to departure."
