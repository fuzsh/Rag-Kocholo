If you make a purchase using one of these links, I may receive compensation at no extra cost to you. Read my disclosure for more information.\n\nDiving into part 3 of the series, planning the itinerary is the next step and can feel like one massive puzzle. So you’ve picked your destination, maybe it’s two or three cities in Europe or you’re headed to Bali for two weeks. How do you allot your time? How many nights in each place? It’s these kinds of questions and a genuine sense of perhaps missing out on something that can strain this process.\n\nI find the itinerary planning stage to be like a puzzle. You work on the outer border and slowly fill in. My inner planner really enjoys this portion of the travel planning process as it forces me to be organized and make decisions. Last thing I want to do is spend weeks deciding if I want to spend 3 or 4 nights somewhere…\n\nHere’s how I set out to plan our itineraries when we travel.\n\n*p.s You can find the full travel planning series here:\n\nPart 1: How I find My Inspiration\n\nPart 2: How I Decide Where to Travel to\n\nPart 3: Planning the Itinerary\n\nPart 4: When to Book What\n\nPart 5: Tips for on Ground\n\nTravel Planning Part 3: Planning the Itinerary\n\nStep 1: What do you want to do?\n\nI think the best way to lay out an itinerary is starting by getting a rough idea of how much you want to do in each destination. I will initially get a sense of how much time I really need to do my top, must do or see things and if any of those will take half or full days. For instance, in Paris, I know visiting the Louvre and the Museé d’Orsay could easily take a half day or more. I like to account for this and “free time” to explore in a list for each place.\n\nStep 2: How many nights for the trip vs how many nights in each spot?\n\nI think this is a very personal question. Often people will ask things like how many nights in Paris? It’s so up to you! There’s some cities where I could spend 5-6 nights and the person next to me could only spend 2 nights. I would take your total amount of nights allotted for the trip and decide how many nights per destination by interest/things to do when your planning the itinerary. Step 1 will really help determine this.\n\nStep 3: Make a “Saved Locations” Google Map before deciding anything..\n\nMy top tip for answering the “where to stay” question and “what to do” is to create a Google Map with saved locations. You can save or star your top restaurants, places to see, and hotels. It will be really obvious when you see all of the stars and what location would be best suited. If you’re like me, you’ll love to color note each one like blue for coffee shops, red for restaurants, and green for sights.\n\nAfter I create a Google Map, I’ll cross reference it with my spreadsheet itinerary (step 4) and be sure that everything alines. I may find that I want one extra night somewhere after this step.\n\nStep 4: Create a spreadsheet.\n\nThis will save you a headache and it’s one of the best aids to when it comes time to booking time. In my excel sheets, I will order it by day from arrival to departure and have a column for:\n\nDates\n\nAccommodations\n\nTop things to do\n\nNotes for any constrictions — like if a museum is closed on Mondays.\n\nHow to get to said location, like train, plane, bus, or car.\n\nFrom here, I’ll start filling in my itinerary. Sometimes my destination order in an itinerary needs to be changed if there is some scheduling involved — like a must-see museum isn’t opened a certain day. It may make sense to go somewhere first and then return to the departure city after I do further research. Having a “must-see” list helps prioritize the itinerary.\n\nI like to prioritize my itinerary by what it is I am interested in and why we’ve gone on the trip. We take trips for all different kinds of reasons, whether it’s to unplug, be outdoors, or explore a new city. So I really like to plan out the order of the trip to reflect those priorities.\n\nStep 5: Check and double check the big factors.\n\nOnce you’ve laid out your itinerary, I couldn’t recommend this step most before anything gets booked. Double check prices and availability of:\n\nTransportation between destinations — can you actually get between the two places? I use Rome2Rio for this as it shows every possible way to get between two places.\n\nHotel/Airbnb availability — if there’s a must stay hotel, is there availability?\n\nOpening hours of activities — are my top things to do open?\n\nIf you can’t get between two certain cities, you’ll need to go back to your itinerary and rearrange from here.\n\nStep 6: Your itinerary should be pretty well set.\n\nAt this point, you know if you can get between places, how much time you want to spend in each destination, and a general sense of what you’ll want to do. The next post will talk about the booking stage and how I handle getting everything confirmed for each trip.\n\nOther Notes\n\nI always believe it’s better not to try to do it all. It’s unrealistic and creates a rhythm in travel where you’re just going through a list. I like to leave room for spontaneity as I truly believe some of the best experiences are the unexpected.\n\nIf you need itinerary inspiration, see the itineraries for these top locations:\n\nOne Week Itinerary by Train for Italy\n\nOne Week Itinerary for Northern California.\n\nFour Night Itinerary for Barcelona.\n\nFour Night Itinerary for Lisbon.\n\nTwo Week Itinerary for Sri Lanka.\n\nFirst-Timer’s Itinerary to Japan\n\n10 Day Slow Travel Itinerary for Cuba\n\nFirst-Timer’s Itinerary for Morocco\n\nTwo Week Itinerary for Bali\n\nUltimate Thailand Itinerary\n\nSave this post for later on Pinterest:"
