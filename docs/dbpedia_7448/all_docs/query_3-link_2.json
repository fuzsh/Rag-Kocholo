Here’s our full advertising policy: How we make money.\n\nRome2rio is a free resource that can save time and money when you want to travel to a new destination and keep costs down.\n\nEnter where you want to visit and the site will show you how to get there by plane, train, bus, ferry, or car. And it gives you prices for each transportation option. It even works for trips with multiple stops.\n\nSo whether you’re looking to fly around the world or just take a road trip within the US, Rome2rio is a useful research tool!\n\nI’ll show you how Rome2rio works!\n\nWhy You Should Check Rome2rio Before You Travel\n\nLink: Rome2rio\n\nLink: World Travel 101\n\nRome2rio is a one-stop travel planning tool. The site use lots of data to help you research costs and travel times to destinations all over the world.\n\nI’ll share a step-by-step guide to using the site in a moment. But as an example, let’s say you’re planning to travel from New York to Boston.\n\nYou can enter your departure location and travel destination. Rome2rio will show you transportation options, travel times, and estimated price for your journey.\n\nEven if you’re a seasoned traveler, Rome2rio might suggest ways to save money on a trip. Like flying to an alternative airport and taking a train or bus to your destination.\n\nBesides its planning features, Rome2rio can also redirect you to book your trip. The site partners with Skyscanner for flights, Booking.com for hotels, and Rentalcars.com.\n\nRome2rio won’t give you prices for award flights. But it’s still a good starting point for folks using miles & points to figure out which airlines fly on certain routes.\n\nYou can use the Rome2rio website, or you can also download the app for your Apple or Android device. Overall, the mobile apps get positive reviews, but some folks prefer the ease of use with the website.\n\nAnd you don’t need to create a account to access most features of Rome2rio, which is great! Here’s how to use Rome2rio!\n\nStep 1. Enter Your Departure Location and Travel Destinations\n\nFirst, enter your starting location and the destination.\n\nThe locations do NOT have to be specific airport codes or cities. You can enter exact addresses, or just the name of a country.\n\nIn this example, I searched from Chicago to the Park Hyatt Paris-Vendome.\n\nStep 2. Select a Travel Option\n\nNext, you’ll see potential travel options with estimated travel times and prices.\n\nIn this example, you have the choice to fly from Chicago to either of Paris’ airports. I selected the option that includes a flight to Paris (CDG).\n\nAfter choosing an option, you’ll get more details on the estimated travel time and costs for each part of your journey.\n\nIn this example, Rome2rio shows everything from the initial train ride to the airport in Chicago to the walking directions to the hotel in Paris.\n\nI find this part of Rome2rio to be very helpful. Because you’ll see the estimated time each part of your trip takes all on 1 screen.\n\nStep 3. View Specific Travel Options\n\nNow that you have an idea on estimated travel times, you can dive deeper to find specific flights and transportation options.\n\nI clicked on the flight portion of the trip.\n\nThen, a new screen appears, that lists airlines that fly the route along with dates and flight times.\n\nAt this step, you’ll have the option to search for specific flights to see prices and times. This information comes from Skyscanner.\n\nIf you decide to book on this screen, you might be redirected to a 3rd-party booking site. I recommend checking the price on the airline website to make sure you’re getting the best deal!\n\nBesides researching flights, you can also view estimated prices and travel times for other parts of your journey. Or compare alternate transportation options.\n\nFor example, I clicked on the first part of the journey, which first suggested a train ride to the airport.\n\nWhen you scroll down, there are options to take a taxi or shuttle to the airport instead of a train. So you can select one of these to update the estimated travel time and cost of the trip.\n\nStep 4. Add Multiple Travel Destinations\n\nIf you plan to travel beyond the Park Hyatt Paris-Vendome, you can add a new destination to the end of your trip.\n\nFor example, I entered Italy. Remember, it doesn’t have to be a specific address.\n\nThe results show lots of ways to travel from Paris to Italy. You can take a plane, train, bus, or drive.\n\nThis is a fantastic perk of Rome2rio. Because if you’re planning a trip to multiple countries, you’ll get an idea of the total estimated travel time and costs.\n\nAnd there’s no limit. You can continue adding destinations to your journey!\n\nStep 5. Print, Share, or Save Your Trip\n\nAfter you’re done researching your trip, you can print, share, or save your trip.\n\nI like the “Print View” because it shows a nice layout of each part of your trip.\n\nTo save your travel plans, you’ll need to sign-up for a free account.\n\nRome2rio Drawbacks and Alternatives\n\nRome2rio is a terrific way to begin researching and planning a vacation or adventure. But there are some parts of the site that could use improvements.\n\nFor example, I found the price estimates for flights to be inaccurate. The Chicago (ORD) to Paris example showed an estimated one-way flight price range from $260 to $700.\n\nBut when I searched on Google Flights, I couldn’t find a one-way flight for less than ~$500 on most dates.\n\nI think an upgrade to the site would be using your travel dates to pull in real time pricing information instead of estimates.\n\nThere are not many alternatives apps or sites that provide you with as much information as Rome2rio does by just entering your departure and destination locations.\n\nFor example, you can use Google Maps. But when you enter the same criteria in the earlier example, you only get flight options.\n\nGoogle Maps can work for multi-destination trips like Rome2rio. But you’ll have to enter specific addresses for your journey, which takes more time.\n\nBottom Line\n\nRome2rio is a free and helpful tool for folks looking to plan a travel adventure.\n\nThe site can save you time and money by suggesting multiple travel options. You just have to enter your departure location and travel destination to get started!\n\nYou’ll find the estimated travel time and costs for each part of your journey, which can include travel by plane, train, bus, ferry, or car.\n\nIf you like what you see on the Rome2rio trip itinerary, you can book through other websites like Booking.com or Rentalcars.com to purchase parts of the trip.\n\nFor folks who use miles & points to book travel, Rome2rio can be a great starting point to see which airlines offer specific routes.\n\nHave you used Rome2rio? I’d love to hear your experience!"
