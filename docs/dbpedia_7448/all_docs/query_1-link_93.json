If you can book tickets an exact price based on your dates and requirements will be shown.\n\nTrain/Bus/Tram/Ferry/Fly/Drive\n\nOur partnerships with key ticketing providers allow us to obtain accurate and reliable pricing information. If we don’t have historical data for a particular route, we use pricing from a similar service (usually in the same country) to help determine the price range for that journey.\n\nFor drive results, we display the estimated fuel cost for a standard sedan vehicle (excluding tolls and the cost to rent/own a vehicle).\n\nWe also collect data from our transport partners to create price estimates for shuttles and towncars. If we do not have data for a particular route, we use data from a similar service (usually in the same country).\n\nTaxi\n\nFor taxi results, we show estimated pricing which is determined by comparing our taxi data against one or more local taxi operators. If we do not have taxi data for a particular location, we use pricing from a similar city (usually in the same country)."
