Project Overview

Rome2Rio is one of the world’s top online travel resources, helping travellers to plan their journey on the road, anywhere in the world.

Their new Melbourne office is based in a converted heritage warehouse in Richmond, offering ample space for an inspiring, community-minded fitout for this growing company.

Project Vision and Design

The new fitout, designed by Janet of JMC Designs, brings to life a vintage travellers theme, with the large scale warehouse walls offering the perfect backdrop for feature travel artworks.

The Rome inspired breakout space in their café features a custom Seraphic fresco artwork printed on Zintra to provide an effective and beautiful acoustic solution for this busy space. And as recommended by our internal design team, the artworks were further enhanced with a custom black Zintra arch frame to mirror the arches seen elsewhere in the breakout room. Rome2Rio’s internal meeting rooms also feature a custom oriental Seraphic Digital print, which give a subtle nod to the travel theme without impacting too heavily on the minimalist aesthetic.

Collaboration is key to the company’s spirit, which meant including a variety of spaces for both large and small meetings, as well as impromptu gatherings, was a central part of the office design.

The fitout includes a tiered seating space, much like a Roman amphitheatre, and whimsical train carriage inspired collaboration booths which are much loved by staff. They feature our hard-wearing vinyl upholsteries, Yosemite in cypress and Cassidy in wheat, which are perfect for these high traffic, multi-use spaces. They also coordinate with the soft blonde wood and paint colours throughout the office.

Rome2Rio’s new office is a creative, playful and inspiring space. We're pleased to say that the client was very happy with the final look and attention to detail of our beautiful Baresque products and service.
