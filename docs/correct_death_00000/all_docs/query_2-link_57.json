Today, the unfinished portrait is featured in a new museum that showcases many exhibits, including FDR's 1938 Ford convertible with hand controls, his Fireside Chats playing over a 1930s radio, his stagecoach and a theater. Visitors can tour FDR's home, which has been carefully preserved very much as he left it. A two-hour guided tour will be offered to groups of 15 to 20 people.\n\nAmenities Facility Amenities\n\nFree Parking\n\nParking on Site\n\nGift Shop\n\nPublic Restrooms\n\nSelf-guided Tours\n\nSuitable for Ages\n\nAll Ages\n\nGroup Amenities\n\nGroup-Friendly\n\nGeneral Information\n\nFamily-Friendly"
