        "text": "FDR by the pool in Warm Springs, 1924. Photo courtesy of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library & Museum.\n\nIntroduction\n\nOn October 3, 1924, a train pulled into the small town of Warm Springs, Georgia. About one hundred of the five hundred people in the town showed up to greet this arrival, for on it was Franklin D. Roosevelt, fifth cousin of the late President Theodore Roosevelt, former Assistant Secretary of the Navy, and the 1920 Democratic vice-presidential candidate. Accompanying him was his wife, Eleanor, his secretary, Missy LeHand, and his valet, LeRoy Jones. He came to Warm Springs looking for a way to repair his paralyzed legs and regain his ability to walk on his own once again. In the three years since he was stricken with polio, FDR had tried numerous therapeutic exercises in attempt to regain muscle use in his legs but none had been successful. Those closest to FDR, including Eleanor, thought that Warm Springs would be just another one of those attempts and would do little to nothing to help him. This belief proved to be wrong; Warm Springs would change FDR’s life and forever change the town of Warm Springs. Although he was never able to walk without some assistance, Warm Springs always refreshed him, physically and spiritually, and his time there opened his eyes to life in the impoverished south. For the next twenty-one years, FDR would make forty more trips to Warm Springs, build two homes for himself, buy a farm, and establish a rehabilitation center for polio patients such as him. Warm Springs became his second home, the one place he could completely relax, and the people there were his neighbors.\n\nThe Beginning\n\nThe area along the Pine Mountains that would become Warm Springs was discovered by the Creek Indians, who claimed healing came from the warm spring waters. When the white settlers came to Georgia, they turned the area into a summer resort, and in 1896 it was incorporated into the city of Bullochville. Most people in Bullochville called the area “Warm Springs” because what attracted people to the area was the warm spring waters. By the mid-1920s, the town was no longer Bullochville but Warm Springs. FDR first heard about Warm Springs in the summer of 1924 through a political friend of his named George Foster Peabody. Peabody told him the story of a twenty-six year old engineer named Louis Joseph who was also a polio victim but had found relief from the warm spring waters near his parents’ vacation home in Columbus, Georgia. He said that the therapy he took in the waters helped restore his leg muscles to the point of him being able to walk with just the assistance of two canes. Thinking of his friend Franklin Roosevelt, Peabody told Joseph to write FDR a letter describing his experience in the waters to persuade him to come down to Georgia. His story convinced FDR to go down to Georgia and try the waters, and by the end of September, he was on his way south. The main resort in Warm Springs was the Meriwether Inn, built at the end of the nineteenth century and, at one time, a fashionable resort. The Meriwether Inn consisted of two enclosed pools, one larger outdoor pool, and a “colony” of cottages up the hill for guests to stay in. A newspaper editor named Tom Loyless ran the Meriwether Inn in 1924, but by that time the inn was deteriorating and facing great financial trouble. Loyless’ financial situation was hurt even more when he was forced to resign from his position as president and editor of the Enquirer-Sun after fighting the Ku Klux Klan. Loyless became a good friend of FDR’s, and his death from cancer in 1926 was one of the reasons FDR would come to purchase Warm Springs.\n\nThe Roosevelts found out soon after their arrival that life in the South was quite different from their life in New York. FDR quickly came to love the area with all of its greenery, reminding him of his home in Hyde Park, New York in that respect, but also appreciating the Southern hospitality extended to him. But most of his days were spent by the pools swimming and sunbathing, as doctors had suggested he do. While FDR enjoyed every minute in Warm Springs, Eleanor could not get herself to appreciate the place as her husband did. She found the poverty in the area heart-breaking and was deeply upset by the poor treatment of African-Americans, pointing out when she first arrived that the school for black children was inadequate compared to the school for white children. She remembered in her autobiography that the first house they had in Warm Springs had such big cracks in it that she could look outside and see daylight. She also recalled driving to a nearby town to buy chicken for dinner, only to discover that she would have to take the chicken back alive! Their cook had to wring their necks, “amid much squawking,” and put them in the pot. Needless to say, dinner that night was not all that pleasant for her. After seeing her husband was settled in Warm Springs, she went back to New York. FDR continued to thrive from his time spent at the pools. The springs were highly mineralized waters that flowed at a rate of 1,800 gallons per minute and the temperature remained at a constant eighty-eight degrees. Shortly after Eleanor left in mid-October, FDR wrote her, “This is a real discovery of a place and there is no doubt that I've got to do it some more.\" His legs felt lighter when he was swimming and he could tell that his muscles were more relaxed. To his mother, Sara Delano Roosevelt, he reiterated his belief that Warm Springs was really a unique place, \"I feel that a great \"cure\" for infantile paralysis and kindred diseases could well be established here.\" FDR genuinely felt that Warm Springs had so much to offer to polio victims like him, and he was preparing for what would be the biggest business venture in his life to open the doors of Warm Springs for other polio patients.\n\nThe Creation of the Georgia Warm Springs Foundation\n\nIn late October 1924, Tom Loyless had a political reporter named Cleburne E. Gregory from the Atlanta Journal come to Warm Springs to write a small article about FDR’s visit to Warm Springs. Gregory spent some time swimming with FDR and eating hotdogs from what Gregory called a “small, unsanitary stand” by the pools, though FDR always said the hotdogs were “delicious.” His article on FDR in Warm Springs first appeared in the Sunday Magazine of the Atlanta Journal and was titled, “Franklin Roosevelt Will Swim to Health.” Gregory wrote that FDR was “literally swimming his way back to health” in Warm Springs and he had the large outdoor swimming pool to himself where he could swim and exercise until he would crawl out on the concrete pier and sunbath for an hour. FDR told Gregory that everyone in Warm Springs had extended him a hearty welcome as a “prospective regular visitor” and that everything in Warm Springs was either “”Great,” “Fine,” or Wonderful.”” FDR also showed him that he could move his right leg for the first time in three years thanks to the waters of Warm Springs. The waters held something magical, but FDR could not explain the phenomenon, nor could anyone else. Gregory observed that FDR contained a spirit that would “restore him to his pristine health and vigor, for political and financial battles and successes in the years to come.” FDR ended the interview with a joke about the pristine Georgia weather, “I have been here for twenty-one days and it has been wonderful. Not one drop of rain. I think the citizens should change the name of the county from Meriwether to M-e-r-r-y W-e-a-t-h-e-r.” Surprisingly, this article by Gregory attracted the attention of paralysis victims across the country, and one-by-one they began to arrive in Warm Springs, seeking what FDR found.\n\nFDR and Tom Loyless were not expecting Gregory’s article to be printed across the country nor were they expecting polio patients to come to Warm Springs in response. The Meriwether Inn was not equipped to house polio patients as there were many steps and the resort was in poor condition. Fortunately, the people of Warm Springs were kind enough to take in the patients until the Meriwether Inn had ramps installed and the cottages were remodeled. One of the first patients to arrive was a young man named Fred Botts, who came in a very weak state. The passengers on the train refused to sit with a cripple like Botts, so he was placed in the back car in a crate. Although this attitude was shameful, it was common for cripples to be shunned by the public for fear that what they had would spread. Even summer visitors at the Meriwether Inn did not want to swim in the same pools as polio patients. For weeks FDR wondered if this severely malnourished young man would survive. But Fred Botts did survive, and he would come to play a major role in the story of Warm Springs and become a trusted friend of FDR’s. During the first two years, the funds for treatments in Warm Springs were low and there were no polio specialists, but the patients’ spirits were always high. FDR had learned much about polio from his own doctor, Robert Lovett, and had read-up on doctoral care and therapy for polio patients. As a result of his knowledge, the patients started calling him “Doctor Roosevelt” because, for a time, he was the only doctor they had. In the summer of 1925, there were a few more than twenty-five patients, by 1927, the number was around forty-eight. It became increasingly clear to FDR that something more official needed to be created in Warm Springs. In 1926, shortly after his friend Tom Loyless passed away, FDR purchased Warm Springs for $200,000.00. The next step was to create a rehabilitation center. To one of the pools he added a treatment table for patients to use while swimming; these are now used in all therapeutic sites across the country. Along with Fred Botts, another of those early patients was a young man named Paul Hasbrouck. Hasbrouck was from the Roosevelts’ neighboring city of Poughkeepsie and FDR suggested he come down to Warm Springs for therapy. He found life in Warm Springs charming and laid-back, and eventually began to see progress in his legs, but what most appealed to him was the spirit of Warm Springs. He wrote his mother about the wonders of the place in May, 1927, “The beauty of the warm pool here is, however, that we experience no reaction or depression afterwards.” This was what FDR had hoped to achieve, a place where patients would not be wrapped in the depression that engulfed them before they arrived.\n\nThe Georgia Warm Springs Foundation was established in 1927 as a nonprofit and permanent institution under New York laws, and of course, FDR named himself president. The foundation hired Dr. LeRoy Hubbard and Miss Helena Mahoney to come down to Warm Springs to serve as the head doctor and physical therapist. To raise money for the foundation, FDR and his partner at the foundation, Basil O'Connor, sent letters to friends and colleagues in the North and South asking for donations and even inviting them to come to Warm Springs and take a look at the place themselves. One of the biggest supporters during those first years was Edsel Ford, who gave FDR a check for $25,000.00 in 1928. This money was used to create a glass enclosed pool for the patients to use during the winter and spurred growth even more. Though the foundation did not raise as much as they had hoped it would, they had enough to create a comfortable and enjoyable environment for patients.\n\nLife at the Georgia Warm Springs Foundation\n\nHistorian Hugh Gallagher, who himself was a polio patient at Warm Springs, once said that what made Warm Springs different from other rehabilitation sites was that it was a place where patients could live normal lives. It was not a hospital or a sanitarium, where polio patients at the time were usually sent, but just a place where patients came to get better. For the young patients, life was like it was before they were taken ill. They attended parties, social events, and holiday celebrations; there was little time to dwell on their infirmity or be homesick. FDR loved to hear stories about young people falling-in-love, and some getting married. After noticing that many of the young couples returned to their hometowns to get married, he had a non-denominational church built across the street from the rehabilitation center. The foundation hired local high school boys to serve as “push boys,” whose job was to take the patients places around town such as the movies, ice cream shop, and post office. FDR wanted the patients to think of Warm Springs as their second home, just as he did, and when he was there, they really felt at home. All the patients and staff at the foundation were drawn to FDR’s charm. His secretary Grace Tully wrote, \"Even the staff, from the doctors down to the lowliest of the employees, white or colored, looked at this man with the most obvious admiration and respect. And to him, they were friends, close friends, all of them.\" It did not matter if it was Dr. Hubbard or the African-American man who served lunch at the Georgia Hall, FDR would strike up a conversation with all of them. Geoffrey Ward summed up the feelings of the patients, “Whether or not people got better at Warm Springs, they felt that they were better and they felt that with him present, anything was possible.” There were patients who did get better over time, others did not, but they all had extraordinary faith in the founder of the foundation. FDR’s cousin Margaret Suckley wrote in her diary that she saw the foundation as “a monument to him, his imagination and his faith and his love for his fellow sufferers” (Ward 211). Even if patients did not completely get better, they learned at Warm Springs how to make do with the abilities that they had and to enjoy life again.\n\nIn Warm Springs, everything was informal, even with the president of the United States. Here was where FDR would take his braces off, revealing his gangly legs because he was amongst people whose legs looked exactly as his did. One of FDR's favorite events was the annual Thanksgiving dinner at the Georgia Hall, the main building of the foundation that replaced the Meriwether Inn in 1933. Patients, staff, and reporters were all welcome to join the president, and sometimes Mrs. Roosevelt, at the annual dinner. During dinner, he would mingle with the patients and staff and relished in telling stories of the old days in Warm Springs. It was also during this dinner that he would address the nation by radio. His 1939 Thanksgiving speech, which took place just two months after World War II began, was especially touching, \"You know,” he said, “I am in favor of war. I am very much in favor of the kind of war that we are conducting here at Warm Springs, the kind of war that, aided and abetted by what we have been doing at Warm Springs now for fourteen or fifteen years, is spreading all over the country—the war against the crippling of men and women and, especially, of children.\" After the dinner ended he would sit at the door in his wheelchair and shake hands with every person there. Just as it was acceptable for him to show his legs in Warm Springs, it was also acceptable for him to be seen in his wheelchair; Warm Springs was the one place where he felt completely at ease and did not have to partake in what Hugh Gallagher called the “splendid deception.” The finale of the evening was a show put on by the patients. Eleanor Roosevelt was always impressed by what they could do, \"The patients, themselves, with the aid of the newspaper men, put on a very good show after dinner. Wheelchairs and crutches were completely ignored and patients and visitors were all \"kidded\" in friendly fashion. I know no place where you can end the day with more reasons for being thankful.\" The Thanksgiving festivities were a time for patients to come together with their founder, doctors and nurses, to remember what they were fighting for and give thanks for the place that had given them the ability to hope again. Besides Thanksgiving, Warm Springs also celebrated FDR’s birthday every year. In 1933, FDR and Basil O’Connor were brainstorming ideas on how to raise money for Warm Springs and they came-up with a nationwide celebration of FDR’s birthday. The first of what would be called the “Birthday Balls” took place on January 30, 1934 in cities across America, and on that night $1,016,443 was raised for Warm Springs. These celebrations would expand to cities across America in the coming years and continue to raise money for the Georgia Warm Springs Foundation and then for the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis after its creation in 1938. The last Birthday Ball in 1945 raised $18.9 million for National Foundation, better known as the March of Dimes. Sadly, but not surprisingly, after FDR died there were no more birthday parties for the president or Thanksgiving festivities with so much joy and spirit. Just as FDR’s death was the end of an era for many Americans, this was especially true for the Warm Springs patients.\n\nLife in Warm Springs\n\nFDR was not only involved in the foundation, but he was also involved in many activities around the town of Warm Springs. He was sure to follow every election, whether it be state or local, that affected Meriwether County, and was kept up-to-date on the latest gossip. However, the politician in him saw certain things that could be improved, one of them being education for local African-Americans. He remember how bothered Eleanor was by the condition of the school for black children, and this bothered him as well. Before FDR became president, he mentioned that a new school should be built for African-Americans, but then came the Depression and there was little funding to build the school. A few years later, at a meeting with state education officials, FDR cited that Eleanor had said many times that there was a big need for a school for black children and suggested having a school built under the Julius Rosenwald Fund, with him contributing some his own money as well. In 1936 the Eleanor Roosevelt School for African-Americans was completed, and on March 18, 1937, FDR officially dedicated it in a simple ceremony. Ever the optimist, FDR acknowledged there were still many improvements to be made in education in the state but that the “proper steps” were being taken. Eleanor was unable to be in Warm Springs when the school was dedicated, but she did eventually tour the school and meet the students and was honored that it bore her name. This simple red-bricked school house still stands today, a memory of a time not so long ago when Jim Crow laws dominated every aspect of life in the South. FDR may not have fought politically for civil rights, but he treated all people equal in Warm Springs. Besides building the school, he provided a check to build a church for African-Americans, lent money to a black farmhand, at no interest, and paid for the medical expenses of a young man who was injured while digging a well. Although Eleanor Roosevelt wrote that she saw life in that part of the South as “hard and poor and ugly,” the kindness of the neighbors in Warm Springs left a lasting impression on her. She remembered that there was a hardly a day when neighbors did not bring something like wood, chicken, or flowers in a silver bowl or china vase. These acts of kindness were always remembered years later by people who would come down to Warm Springs with FDR, rarely had they seen a more hospitable place as Warm Springs.\n\nFDR's favorite spot was a place he discovered on one of his first visits called Dowdell’s Knob. The Knob was located in nearby Pine Mountain, Georgia and was the highest overlook in the state. It was here, FDR said, that he would take patients who felt like giving-up on their treatments and conceding to infirmity. FDR would drive up to the Knob and show them the gorgeous landscape below, and they would leave with a new sense of determination. During her January, 1958 visit to Warm Springs, Eleanor Roosevelt wrote of her husband’s affection for the Knob, \"My husband had a favorite spot to which he liked to drive, when he was spending some time here. It was called the Knob, a promontory overlooking a vast plain. Many picnics were held here, and he liked to come and sit here quietly for half an hour and just look at the expanse of country opening up in every direction.\" During his last trip to Warm Springs in April, 1945 that FDR, being too weak to drive himself, asked his Secret Service to drive him up to the Knob. He requested that the Secret Service men leave him alone while he sat with only his thoughts for two hours before returning to the Little White House. One can imagine he was thinking about the Allied victory he saw as just around the corner, the beginning of his great creation, the United Nations, which he and Eleanor were planning to attend the opening of in San Francisco at the end of April, or perhaps he was dreaming of the future trips he would make to Warm Springs after his time in office was complete, when he would have more time to write and spend time with the patients. Sadly, he would see none of these things come to pass. What FDR loved most about Dowdell’s Knob was the stunning view of the countryside and trees. FDR considered himself a great tree farmer, he enjoyed spending time writing about and discussing agriculture. In 1925, his friend Tom Loyless asked him to take over his position as editor of The Macon Daily Telegraph since Tom was battling cancer at the time, FDR gladly accepted because, as he mentioned many times to Tom, he was the editor of the Harvard Crimson in college. The second column FDR wrote was titled, “The Matter of Woods and Trees and Lumber in General,” in which he discussed the burning of acres of forest and the growth of enterprises across the country. Since farming was one of his favorite pastimes and he had a farm in his hometown of Hyde Park, FDR purchased a total of 1,750 acres of farm land in Warm Springs. During the war when rationing was in effect, FDR supplied the patients with meat and vegetables from his farm. FDR loved driving around Warm Springs, inspecting his farm, and would always stop to give someone a lift if they needed one. As he was driving, he would wave and yell out, “Hiya neighbor!” Everyone loved him, even the few in the area who did not agree politically found themselves captivated by the attention he would give to the person he was talking to. His popularity in Meriwether County was reflected by his wide marginal wins in all four elections, whereas he never won in Dutchess County, New York, his home county. This “second home” where FDR had given so much to, also gave much to him, not just physically and spiritually, but also politically.\n\nFDR’s Death and His Legacy in Warm Springs\n\nAt the end of March, 1945, FDR went down to Warm Springs for what was intended to be another rejuvenating visit. After his fourth inauguration and the Yalta Conference, which proved to be a long, arduous journey, FDR was completely exhausted. His health had been rapidly declining in the last year, but he and those closest to him believed that this trip to Warm Springs would revive him, as it always seemed to. Compared to when he first started coming in the 1920s, his trips after the war began were much shorter. In the ‘20s, he would stay from anywhere between one to three months, but after he became president, he was lucky to stay three weeks, as was planned for this visit. He arrived in Warm Springs on March 30th and, as was ritual, drove by the Georgia Hall to greet the patients excitedly lined-up outside waiting for his arrival. On April 1st he attended his last Easter service at the little chapel across the street from the foundation. During the service, his friends noticed that he had a terrible tremor in his hands that caused him to fumble the program and was frighteningly thin, he was clearly a sick man. His plans for April 12th were to serve as the guest of honor at a barbecue given by the new mayor of Warm Springs, Frank Allcorn, who also owned the Hotel Warm Springs, and the hotel manager, Ruth Stevens. After the barbecue, he was invited to watch a skit rehearsal put on by some of the patients at the foundation.Until it was time to leave for Allcorn’s home, FDR worked on the Jefferson Day address that was going to be delivered nationwide on April 14th from the Georgia Hall. Sadly, there would be no picnic, skit rehearsal, or Jefferson Day speech. At 1:15 on the afternoon of the 12th, FDR suffered a cerebral hemorrhage in the living room of the Little White House while sitting for a portrait by Madame Elizabeth Shoumatoff. Just over two hours later at 3:35, the president was pronounced dead in his bedroom. That afternoon, FDR’s beloved cook, Daisy Bonner, wrote in pencil on the kitchen wall, “Daisy Bonner cooked the first meal and the last one in this cottage for the President Roosevelt.” On April 13th, the hearse carrying FDR’s casket drove by the Georgia Hall, where the patients were lined-up, as they always were when FDR would leave. Except this time, they knew that their founder, the man they admired more than anyone, would not be returning again. Uncertainty filled their minds and they wondered, “What will happen to us now that he is gone?” As the hearse pulled out, Graham Jackson, FDR’s favorite pianist and accordionist who was scheduled to play that evening at the patients’ rehearsal, played Antonin Dvorak’s, “Goin’ Home,” on his accordion. The tears streamed downed his face, as they did the faces of the patients and the hundreds of people at the Warm Springs train station to say goodbye to the man who had done more for Warm Springs and polio patients than anyone.\n\nThe patients and staff were right to wonder what would happen to them after FDR’s death. The Georgia Warm Springs Foundation was soon taken over by a professional medical administration, and some of the original staff, Fred Botts included, lost their jobs and were replaced with more “professional” people. The Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation succeeded the foundation and still operates today as a rehabilitation facility. Thirty years after FDR arrived in Warm Springs hoping to repair the damage done to his muscles, and twenty-eight years after the birth of the Georgia Warm Springs Foundation, Dr. Jonas Salk's polio vaccine was released on April 12, 1955. His research at the University of Pittsburgh that began in 1948 had been funded by the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. Without the Georgia Warm Springs Foundation, there would have been no National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, and Dr. Salk’s vaccine would not have been released as early as 1955. Three years after the Salk vaccine was released, Eleanor Roosevelt returned to Warm Springs for the dedication of the Polio Hall of Fame at the Institute and to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the March of Dimes. She captured the magic of Warm Springs in her \"My Day\" column, \"The spirit of the patients has remained remarkable, as it always was, and I think anyone who comes here will forever be inspired by the courage of those who are fighting their way back to a useful life.\" The remarkable spirit that lived in Warm Springs that inspired so many people was the type of atmosphere FDR hoped to create back in 1925. The president who gave Americans so much hope during the darkest hours of the Depression and World War II also gave that hope to the patients in Warm Springs. Warm Springs not only molded FDR as a man, but also as a politician. What he saw and experienced in Warm Springs shaped him into becoming the president he was. The suffering and poverty around town, the poor education system, and the low farm prices, all contributed to his ideas that would become the New Deal. Around Warm Springs, there is evidence of New Deal programs, such as Works Progress Administration buildings and state parks improved by the Civilian Conservation Corps. Eleanor Roosevelt always believed that what he was exposed to in Warm Springs really opened his eyes for the first time to what suffering really was. It was in Warm Springs “that Roosevelt evolved a new and deep concern for suffering and underprivileged humanity and sensed the possibilities of doing something about it.” The New Deal was FDR’s response to the problems he saw around Warm Springs. But the real spirit of Warm Springs would always remain at the foundation, where he invested so much of his time and efforts working towards a cure for what was the most feared disease for the first half of the twentieth century. The final words of the undelivered Jefferson Day speech reflects FDR’s feelings about the “war” that was being fought in Warm Springs against polio, “The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today. Let us move forward with strong and active faith.”\n\nBook References\n\nCarmichael, David Scott. F.D.R. Columnist. Chicago: Pellegrini & Cudahy, 1947. Print.\n\nGallagher, Hugh Gregory.
