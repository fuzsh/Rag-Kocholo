        "text": "Fighting insomnia, trying to fall asleep at 3 a.m., I started reading an account of the recent Grand National Roadster Show in Pomona, Calif.\n\nA few weeks ago, America’s Most Beautiful Roadster (AMBR) Award was presented to the owner of an amazing 1932 Ford Phaeton.\n\nPhaetons are forever cool. The old Fords have a unique connection to Atlanta and Georgia.\n\nWhile visiting Warm Springs, Ga., residing inside the Little White House, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt pined for a new muscle car.\n\nFDR loved Fords. He wanted and received a 1938 Ford Phaeton, Flathead V-8, refitted locally with hand controls to drive through Meriwether County and Warm Springs.\n\nThe 32nd president of the United States enjoyed meeting the locals while driving his new Ford.\n\nPresident Roosevelt would not be slowed by his disability. Instead, he would navigate around the effects of polio with his customized Ford Phaeton. It was fitted in Warm Springs with the ingenious hand controls so the president could operate the powerful vehicle. (Plus there was a device dispensing lit cigarettes.)\n\nAnd where did Roosevelt get his fabulous Ford? Atlanta.\n\n“In the 1930s, there were three Ford dealerships in downtown Atlanta,” noted 71-year-old Roy Strickland of Acworth, a retired former automobile dealership general manager.\n\n“My dad worked for all three of them at various times as new car manager: Cotton Frost, Beaudry and Wade.”\n\nJ.C. “Strick” Strickland was managing one of the Ford dealerships in the late 1930s.\n\nHe was assigned by his employer to drive a new 1938 Ford Phaeton to Warm Springs and swap it with FDR.\n\nPhaetons were arriving at Cotton Frost Ford via truck transport in downtown Atlanta. The president had a used vehicle for trade.\n\n“Dad told this story for years,\" recounted the younger Strickland. \"He would laugh about the trip and experience, describing it as 'unforgettable.' ”\n\nThe Fords ushered in stock car racing and formed the basis for a style of dirt track racing.\n\nIt was the perfect 1930s vehicle to drive from Atlanta to Warm Springs.\n\nThe trip, however, was rife with unexpected challenges. The Georgia weather was dismal with rain and cold. And when the elder Strickland arrived at the Little White House he was stunned by the condition of FDR’s trade-in.\n\nIt was trashed. In no way presidential at all.\n\n“It was missing glass. No windows. Dad spent hours motoring back to Atlanta through cold temperatures and rain with a car not ready for such a challenging trip in the late '30s.\"\n\nDecades later, one of the most popular attractions in Warm Springs is the 1938 V8 Ford Phaeton on display for generations of Americans.\n\nPresident Roosevelt led America out of the depths of the Depression and through a world war but he had a trashed used car for trade.\n\nWe all can relate.\n\nJ.C. \"Strick\" Strickland returned home to Atlanta with a bad car and a great story as tall as Clark Gable attending the Atlanta premier of \"Gone with the Wind.\" And lived a great Atlanta life.\n\nHe raised a successful family, had a terrific business for decades and became one of the most respected car professionals in the city.\n\n“My Dad began his career in 1930 employed in the office at W.E. Bradley Co. on Auburn Avenue. Shortly thereafter, he entered the car business managing the old Ford dealerships of the day.”\n\nIn 1948, Mr. Strickland opened his own lot along Spring Street and West Peachtree.\n\n“His specialty was used cars and his services were in demand. He could accurately assess the value of pre-owned cars. His expertise enabled him to survive in his business 56 years buying and selling cars.”\n\nIn the 1950s, Strickland was offered a Ford dealership selling Edsels. Ford respected the Atlanta car legend. He declined, opting instead to own and operate his own Atlanta lot.\n\n\"Strick\" Strickland passed away in 1999. He was 89."
