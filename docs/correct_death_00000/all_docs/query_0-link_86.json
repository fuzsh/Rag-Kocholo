Read my posts about our visit to these two awesome family-fun attractions. There was another adventure we desired to visit while in the vicinity of Pine Mountain. We made our way to the Little White House located at 401 Little White House Road in nearby Warm Springs, Georgia.\n\nLet me tell you we were glad we did! The Little White House and Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Museum should be added to your travel plans when you travel to Georgia.\n\nSo let’s jump into our discussion about this fabulous attraction in Warm Springs, Georgia that is named “The Little White House!”\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPresident Franklin Delano Roosevelt\n\nA Short Background of Little White House\n\nThe Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Museum\n\nExhibits\n\n1940 Willys Roadster\n\n1938 Ford Convertible Sedan\n\n1938 Ford Convertible Modified with Hand Controls for President FDR\n\nStage Coach\n\nMemorabilia\n\nFDR Walking Canes\n\nEleanor Roosevelt, First Lady and United Nations Ambassador\n\nRural Electrification Administration\n\nDining Table\n\nKitchen\n\nFDR Stove\n\nPlaster Bust of FDR\n\nFDR Leg Brace\n\nThe Unfinished Portrait\n\nThe Finished Portrait\n\nLittle White House\n\nLiving Room\n\nDining Room\n\nPresident Franklin D.

Roosevelt Markers\n\nHours of Operation\n\nOther Adventures Near Little White House\n\nDowntown Warm Springs\n\nPine Mountain\n\nThere You Have it!\n\nPresident Franklin Delano Roosevelt\n\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt served as governor of the state of New York, and as President of the United States during the Great Depression of the 1930s and World War II (1939-45), leading the United States through these two major crises. President Roosevelt’s firechat chats over the radio from March 1933 to June 1944 encouraged Americans as they struggled with the loss of employment, bank and money failures and World War II. He is the only president to ever be elected to four consecutive terms serving from March 4, 1933 until his death in 1945. President Roosevelt’s New Deal Programs included the Rural Electrification Administration to bring electric service to rural areas all over America. Roosevelt signed the REA bill into law at the Little White House.\n\nA Short Background of Little White House\n\nThe Little White House in Warm Springs, Georgia was the vacation retreat home of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 32nd president of the United States. President Roosevelt first arrived in Warm Springs, Georgia in 1921, after being diagnosed with polio. He found relief from his pain by entering the warm waters of the springs, and eventually constructed a house in 1934 on the property while governor of New York, and prior to being inaugurated as President in 1933.\n\nThe Little White House became a popular destination for President Roosevelt, and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. President Roosevelt entertained many guests at his “Little White House,” and he made many important decisions and policies there as President of the United States. President Roosevelt died at Little White House in April 1945.\n\nThe Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Museum\n\nThe Franklin Delano Roosevelt Museum is an incredible historical learning center with many profound exhibits. A theater in the museum provides a presentation of the life of President Roosevelt and the challenges of America during his Presidency.\n\nAs we entered the museum, we were greeted by a mannequin of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in his wheelchair. It was as if President Roosevelt was welcoming us in person! The likeness of President Roosevelt with a cigar protruding from his mouth, hat positioned across his lap and walking cane hooked over the arm of the wheelchair provided a awesome start of the events we were to experience that day.. A replica of his Scottish Terrier pet dog Fala sat on the floor next to him.\n\nExhibits\n\nThe museum showcased many exhibits, including President Roosevelt’s 1940 Willys Roadster, 1938 Ford convertible with hand controls, stagecoach and more.\n\n1940 Willys Roadster\n\nThis 1940 Willys Roadster was a gift to President Franklin D. Roosevelt on his 58th birthday from the Willys Overland Corporation in Toledo, Ohio. The car was custom built for the President.\n\n1938 Ford Convertible Sedan\n\n1938 Ford Convertible Modified with Hand Controls for President FDR\n\nStage Coach\n\nMemorabilia\n\nFDR Walking Canes\n\nEleanor Roosevelt, First Lady and United Nations Ambassador\n\nAnna Eleanor Roosevelt was the longest-serving First Lady of the United States. After President Roosevelt’s death, she was appointed by President Truman to be the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nRural Electrification Administration\n\nPresident Roosevelt in an speech at Barnesville, Georgia on August 11, 1938 remarked about Warm Springs being the birthplace of the Rural Electrification Administration because of his retreat home at Warm Springs.\n\n“There was only one discordant note in that first stay of mine at Warm Springs: when the first-of-the-month bill came in for electric light for my little cottage, I found that the charge was 18 cents a kilowatt-hour about four times as much as I paid in Hyde Park, New York. That started my long study of proper public utility charges for electric current and the whole subject of getting electricity into farm homes. So, it can be said that a little cottage at Warm Springs, Georgia, was the birthplace of the Rural Electrification Administration.”\n\nDining Table\n\nKitchen\n\nFDR Stove\n\nPlaster Bust of FDR\n\nFDR Leg Brace\n\nThe Unfinished Portrait\n\nWhile President Franklin D. Roosevelt was posing for a watercolor portrait on April 12, 1945, he became ill and suffered a massive cerebral hemorrhage. He died a short while later at the Little White House. The “Unfinished Portrait” painted by Elizabeth Shoumatoff is featured in the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Museum.\n\nThe Finished Portrait\n\nElizabeth Shoumatoff’s original portrait of President Franklin D. Roosevelt remained unfinished. She later drew additional likenesses of the President based on her recollection and memory. Visitors to the museum will be graced by the amazing artwork of Shoumatoff’s “Finished Portrait” of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. One difference is the color of the tie. In the “Unfinished Portrait,” FDR’s tie was red while in the “Finished Portrait” the tie is blue.\n\nLittle White House\n\nLiving Room\n\nDining Room\n\nPresident Franklin D.

Speaking of our own experience we were so we drove to downtown Warm Springs and had an awesome meal at Bulloch House Restaurant! Its building was originally a mercantile store and later housed a Victorian Tea Room. Try them out! They have good down home southern cooking. They are located at 70 Broad Street.\n\nPine Mountain\n\nCheck out Georgia’s largest State Park, F.D. Roosevelt State Park in nearby Pine Mountain. Also spend time at Callaway Gardens in Pine Mountain, Georgia and visit the Wild Animal Safari just minutes down the road.\n\nThere You Have it!\n\nLittle White House and the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Museum is a fascinating adventure filled with historical knowledge about the 32nd president of the United States, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and all the challenges that faced the United States of America at that time.\n\nMy family and I will never forget the things that we learned, and seeing all the museum exhibits, the Little White House and the Walk of Flags.\n\nSo pack a bag but most of all be safe in your travels!\n\nJim River\n\nRecent Posts"
