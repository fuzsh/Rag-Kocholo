        "text": "Darlene G. Wisterman, 88, died peacefully early Saturday, March 4, 2023 at ProMedica-Heartland Bucyrus where she had resided for several months.\n\nShe was born December 8, 1934 in Buckland, Ohio to the late Emerson G. and Eunice M. (Sprague) Smith. At age 14, Darlene was stricken with polio. She traveled to Warm Springs, Georgia to begin therapy and was able to walk with braces, crutches, and then a cane. She overcame so many odds and had a peaceful spirit through it all. Her biggest health scare came in 1995 and she had used a wheelchair since then.\n\nDarlene graduated from Buckland High School in 1953. At a church meeting in Lima in December 1959, she caught the eye of Bill Wisterman. Bill drove her home that night, they fell in love, and were married August 20, 1960. She and Bill shared 60 years of partnership in love, life, and business until his death in November 2020.\n\nDarlene and Bill lived at Indian Lake before moving to Bucyrus. The Wistermans helped hundreds of clients through their tax preparation businesses, Wisterman Tax Service and D&B Tax Service. Darlene enjoyed fishing, family picnics, and many card games with friends, especially when living at the lake. She also was a loving pet owner, avid reader, knitted, crocheted, and collected all sorts of bears. She will be remembered for her kind, talkative nature as she never met a stranger. Darlene loved everyone, cared for them deeply, and had a deep and abiding faith in God. She was a member of Bucyrus Nazarene Church.\n\nDarlene is survived by son, Doug (Nicole) Wisterman; daughter, Deanna (Shawn) Zeigler; grandchildren, Preston Zornes, Deidra Taylor, Cody Taylor, Shane (Amber) Wisterman, Ashley (Jake) Varner, Desteny (Todd) Mackesy, Heather (Joe) Scripter, Keeley (Jon) Griffin, and Meghan Zeigler; 12 great grandchildren with one expected; and her sister, Linda (Ted) Vorhees and their family.\n\nDarlene’s funeral will be held on Thursday, March 9 at 3:30 pm at Wise Funeral Service in Bucyrus. Friends may call from 2:00 pm until the service begins. She and Bill will be laid to rest in Oakwood Cemetery at a later date.\n\nMemorial donations can be made payable to the Humane Society Serving Crawford County and given at the funeral home. Memories and photos are encouraged on Darlene’s Tribute Wall."
