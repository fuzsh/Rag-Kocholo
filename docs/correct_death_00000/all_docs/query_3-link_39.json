Though small in size, Warm Springs is synonymous with one of the most influential figures in American history: President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nThe town's name is derived from the naturally heated springs that produce nearly a million gallons of warm water each day, creating an idyllic spot that has attracted visitors for centuries. Before European settlers arrived, Native Americans revered the springs for their healing properties.\n\nThe therapeutic value of the warm mineral waters became widely known in the 19th century, leading to the development of a resort in the 1830s. However, it was Roosevelt's association with Warm Springs that carved its place in the annals of American history.\n\nStricken with polio in 1921, Roosevelt sought treatment for his ailment and found solace in the buoyancy and warmth of the springs' waters. Experiencing some relief from his paralysis, Roosevelt purchased the resort in 1927 and transformed it into a rehabilitation center for other polio sufferers, which would become known as the Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation. The center was groundbreaking in its holistic approach to therapy, combining hydrotherapy with vocational training, and it continues to serve people with disabilities to this day.\n\nRoosevelt's personal victory over the despair of polio in Warm Springs helped craft his image as a triumphant overcomer of adversity, an attribute that would resonate with a nation battered by the Great Depression. He went on to become the 32nd President of the United States, leading the country through some of its most trying times, including the Great Depression and World War II.\n\nThe Little White House, Roosevelt’s personal retreat, is where he lived for extended periods during his presidency, finding both rest and inspiration. It was also at this humble sanctuary that he passed away in 1945, forever cementing Warm Springs’ place as a site of historical pilgrimage.\n\nCurrently, Warm Springs remains a testament to both Roosevelt’s legacy and the unyielding spirit of recovery. Tourists visit not just for the history, but to experience the quaint charm, the shops, the warm waters, and the nearby attractions such as F.D. Roosevelt State Park, the largest state park in Georgia, offering ample outdoor activities."
