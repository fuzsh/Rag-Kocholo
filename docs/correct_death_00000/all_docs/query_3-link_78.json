        "text": "Deconstructed Apple Pecan Pie\n\nIngredients 1 cup fresh pecan pieces 3 Medjool Dates, pits removed 6 Pink Lady Apples (can use half apples, half pears, if desired), peeled 1/4 cup Ghee or grass-fed butter 1 teaspoon cinnamon 1 teaspoon vanilla or seeds scraped from 1 vanilla bean 1/4 cup coconut butter, warmed Process: Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Lay the pecan halves in a single layer across a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 5 to 7 minutes, until lightly golden brown and fragrant. Watch closely as they can burn easily. Remove and let cool completely. Roughly chop the dates and add them to the food processor along with the cooled pecans. Pulse together until the mixture resembles very coarse crumbs. Set aside. Core the apples and slice them into even 1/2-inch thick slices. Heat the ghee in a saut√© pan or skillet over medium/high heat. When the ghee is melted and hot, add the apple slices to the pan. Cook, stirring occasionally, until apples have softened and caramelized, about 6 to 8 minutes. Add the cinnamon and if using, vanilla bean seeds, and saut√© for another 30 seconds, fully coating the apples with the spice. Remove from heat. If using vanilla extract, toss in at this point. Spoon the apples onto a serving platter and drizzle with warm coconut butter. Sprinkle the top of the apple dish with the pecan crumble. Serve warm.\n\nPecan Energy Bars\n\nIngredients 15 Medjool dates (9 ounces) 1 cup pecan pieces 1/2 cup gluten free oats 1 tablespoon chia seeds 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt Process: Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Place the dates in the food processor and process or pulse until they are chopped and a rough texture forms. Then, add the remaining ingredients and process for a minute or so until a crumbly dough forms. Line a baking sheet or jelly roll pan with parchment paper. Dump the dough into the center of the parchment paper and use a rolling pin to roll it into a rectangle that is 6‚Äù x 10.5‚Äù. Cut the dough into 14 bars that are 1.5‚Äù x 3‚Äù or into a desired shape. Bake the bars for 30 minutes (this step helps to make the texture more dry and less sticky). Cool the bars to room temperature, then store refrigerated in a sealed container between sheets of wax paper. To package them for on-the-go snacking: cut out 4‚Äù x 6‚Äù rectangles of wax paper, wrap them around the bars, and secure them with tape.\n\nPecan Parmesan Crusted Chicken\n\nIngredients 1/3 cup canola oil or pecan oil 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts 1 cup all-purpose flour Kosher salt and pepper 2 large eggs 1 1/2 cups pecan pieces 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon onion powder 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning Lemon Basil Butter (Optional) 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 clove garlic, minced 1 tablespoon minced shallot 3 tablespoons lemon juice 2 tablespoons chopped basil Kosher salt and pepper Process: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease a baking sheet with canola oil. Place the chicken breasts between two pieces of plastic wrap. Using a meat tenderizer, pound each breast until it is a 1/2-inch thick. Heat canola oil in a large cast-iron pan over medium heat. Prepare your dredging station by adding the all-purpose flour and a generous pinch of kosher salt and black pepper to a shallow bowl. To the second shallow bowl, add the eggs; slightly beat using a fork. In a third shallow bowl, combine chopped pecans, Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Dip each breast in the flour mixture until lightly coated on both sides, then in the egg mixture, allowing the excess to drip off. Finally, dip each breast in the pecan mixture, pressing the mixture onto each side of the breast. Make sure each breast is thoroughly coated. Gently place chicken in hot oil. Cook on each side for 3 to 4 minutes, or until golden brown. Season with a pinch of kosher salt immediately after flipping, and do the same on the other side after you remove the breasts from the hot oil and transfer them to the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the internal temperature reads 165 degrees F. on an instant-read thermometer. Allow the breasts to rest for 5 minutes. While the breasts are in the oven, make the lemon basil butter: Melting the butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the garlic and shallot and allow to cook, stirring often, for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the shallot is soft and the garlic is fragrant. Whisk in the lemon juice and allow the mixture to cook for an additional minute. Stir in the basil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Plate chicken breasts and serve alongside lemon basil butter.\n\nPecan-Crusted Meatball Lettuce Wraps\n\nIngredients For the Meatballs:1 1/2 pounds ground turkey1/3 cup chopped green onions (about 2 stalks)1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes1 teaspoon Kosher salt1/2 teaspoon black pepper2 cloves garlic, minced1/4 teaspoon powdered ginger1 cup pecan pieces, groundFor the Sauce:1/2 cup soy sauce (see recipe notes)1/2 teaspoon corn starch (see recipe notes)1/2 teaspoon fish sauce1 tablespoon toasted sesame oilFor Serving:1 head of butter lettuce leaves1/2 cup matchstick carrotsChopped scallions (optional)Cilantro leaves (optional) Process: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In a large bowl, combine the ground turkey, green onions, sesame oil, red pepper flakes, salt, pepper, garlic, powdered ginger. Use your hand to combine until mixed. In a food processor, pulse pecan pieces until coarsely ground. They should be about the same consistency as panko bread crumbs. Scoop 1 tablespoon of the meat mixture at a time and roll into meatballs. Place the pecan crumbs on a plate, then roll the meatballs in the ground pecans until evenly coated. Place the pecan crusted meatballs on a parchment lined baking sheet. Continue until all meatballs are formed and coated with pecans. Place meatballs in oven and bake at 375 degrees F. for approximately 20 minutes. Flip after 15 minutes. Make the sauce: While meatballs are cooking, combine the Soy Sauce, Cornstarch, fish sauce and sesame oil in a bowl. Heat a small sauce pan over medium heat and add the sauce. Continue to stir until sauce thickens, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool until ready to serve. To serve: sprinkle the lettuce cups with the shredded carrots. Then, place the meatballs on top and drizzle with sauce. Garnish (optional) with scallions and cilantro.\n\nMaple Mustard Chicken with Pecans and Sweet Potatoes\n\nIngredients 4 chicken thighs (bone in, skin on), trimmed of excess fat Kosher salt & fresh ground pepper, to taste 1 large sweet potato (about 1 pound), cut into wedges/thick slices 1 cup (4 ounces) raw pecan halves 3 tablespoons maple syrup 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 1 tablespoon olive oil or pecan oil 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg Fresh chopped herbs for serving (parsley, thyme, rosemary, etc.), to taste Process: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. convection roast if you have that setting. Otherwise, 425 degrees F. Place the trimmed chicken thighs skin side up on a clean surface and season liberally with salt and pepper then transfer to a large bowl. Add the sweet potatoes and pecans to the bowl with the chicken. In a separate small bowl, whisk together the maple syrup, mustard, olive oil, apple cider vinegar, cinnamon and nutmeg. Pour the mixture into the large bowl with the chicken. Gently toss everything together until the chicken, sweet potatoes and pecans are all evenly coated. Spread out onto a foil lined baking sheet in an even single layer. Roast for about 20 minutes or until chicken is fully cooked, flipping the sweet potatoes and pecans 1-2 times during cooking to ensure even browning and caramelization. If you want a deep golden brown skin on the chicken, finish under the broiler for about 1 minute watching carefully so it doesn‚Äôt burn! Remove from oven, garnish with fresh herbs and serve.\n\nChunky Chocolate Chip Pecan Cookies\n\nIngredients 1/2 cup raw pecan pieces 3/4 cups very ripe mashed banana about 2 medium 1 3/4 cups old-fashioned rolled oats 1/4 cup semi sweet or dark chocolate chips 3 tablespoons honey 1 teaspoon cinnamon 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Process: Combine all ingredients in a large bowl until thoroughly mixed.

For a cakier cookie: Add one egg to the mixture for a cookie that has a more cake-like texture.\n\nMaple Pecan Sticky Buns\n\nIngredients Dough: 1 cup warm whole milk 1 packet (2 1/4 teaspoons) instant dry yeast 2 large eggs, beaten 4 tablespoons salted butter, melted 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1 tablespoon packed brown sugar Maple Pecan Sticky Sauce 2 cups raw pecan pieces 1/2 cup whole milk or heavy cream 2/3 cup real maple syrup 1/4 cup + 1/2 cup packed light or dark brown sugar 12 tablespoons salted butter 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon 4 tablespoons salted butter, at room temperature Process: For the dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the milk, yeast, brown sugar, eggs, butter, 3 1/2 cups flour, and salt. Using the dough hook, mix until the flour is completely incorporated, about 4 to 5 minutes. If the dough seems sticky, add an additional 1/2 cup of flour. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 1 hour or until doubled in size. For the sticky sauce: Meanwhile, line a 9√ó13 inch baking dish with parchment, and spread the raw pecan pieces in the bottom of the baking dish. In a medium sauce pot, combine the milk, maple syrup, brown sugar and 12 tablespoons of butter. Cook over medium heat until the butter is melted and the sauce bubbling, about 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Pour the sauce over the pecans. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a small bowl, mix together the remaining 1/2 cup brown sugar and the cinnamon. To combine: Lightly dust a surface with flour. Roll the dough into a rectangle (about 9√ó24 inches). Spread 4 tablespoons softened butter evenly over the dough. Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar evenly over the butter and lightly push the mixture into the butter. Starting with the long edge closest to you, carefully roll the dough into a log, keeping it fairly tight as you go. When you reach the edge, pinch along the edge to seal. Using a sharp knife, cut into 12 rolls. Place rolls in the prepared baking dish, cut side down into the sticky pecan sauce. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise 20 to 30 minutes or transfer to the fridge to rise overnight. Transfer to the oven and bake 20 to 25 minutes, until golden brown on top. If the rolls are browning too quickly on top, cover with foil halfway through cooking. Let the rolls sit 5 minutes and then carefully invert the rolls onto a serving plate. Serve warm and enjoy!\n\nPecan Banana Bread\n\nIngredients 1 cup raw pecan pieces + more for topping Cooking spray for coating pan 1 3/4 cup gluten free or regular baking flour mix 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon sea salt 2 flax eggs or equivalent amount of egg replacer* or two eggs *Flax egg recipe: 2 tablespoons ground flaxseed meal mixed with 6 tablespoons water 1 cup coconut sugar or other sugar 1/2 cup coconut oil or pecan oil 1/2 vanilla bean or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 cup plain soy yogurt or regular yogurt 3/4 cup ripe mashed bananas *Look for very ripe bananas ‚Äì with dark or black skin Process: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare your 9 x 5 banana bread pan by coating the inside of pan with cooking spray and then sprinkling with a bit of the flour mix. Set aside. In a medium sized bowl, sift the 10 ounces (1 3/4 cup) of the flour mix, baking powder, baking soda and sea salt and whisk to combine. In a mixer attachment bowl, add the flax eggs/egg replacer/egg, sugar and coconut oil. Mix together for about 2 minutes on medium-low speed. Scrape the vanilla bean and add to the mixture. Add the soy yogurt and the mashed bananas and mix everything together for 2 more minutes on medium low speed, scraping down the sides and bottom to ensure everything is combined. Add in 1/2 of the dry ingredients mixture, combine for 30 seconds, and then add in the rest of the dry ingredients mixture. Mix again for another 30 seconds, ensuring everything is combined. Remove bowl from mixer and fold in the raw pecan pieces into the batter until evenly distributed. The batter should be thick. Add the batter to the banana bread pan and use your spatula to smooth down the top. Sprinkle some pecan pieces on top. Bake the banana bread on the top shelf of your oven for 60 minutes, until a toothpick comes out with a few crumbs. You don‚Äôt want it to come out clean, so watch your banana bread from about 50 minutes depending on your oven. Remove from oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes in pan. Transfer the bread to a wire rack by placing the wire rack on top of the bread, then holding the sides of the pan and flipping it over and removing the pan. Hold the sides of the bread to turn right side up. You can also turn the pan over into your hand, and then flip right side up and place on a wire rack. Allow the bread to cool completely. Slice as desired.

Enjoy!\n\nPecan Butter Millionaire Bars\n\nIngredients For the shortbread layer 1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 cup maple syrup 1/2 cup coconut oil For the caramelized pecan layer 2 cups raw pecan pieces 1/2 cup maple syrup For the chocolate layer 1 1/4 cup dark chocolate chips (vegan if desired) 1 tablespoon coconut oil Process: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line an 9√ó9 inch square pan with parchment paper. Make the shortbread: In a medium bowl, stir together the flour and kosher salt. Add the oil and maple syrup and stir it together with a spoon, then when it starts to come together use your hands to knead it into a dough. Use your fingers to squeeze out any lumps in the coconut oil and knead until it comes together into a playdough-like texture. Press the dough into the pan. Keep pressing the dough into an even layer that covers the entire pan; it might take a while; you can use a small glass to help roll it out (we used a shot glass). Bake about 15 minutes until lightly browned on the edges. Allow to cool for about 15 minutes until it reaches room temperature. Meanwhile, make the caramelized pecan butter: In a large skillet over medium heat, toast the pecans, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Add the maple syrup and continue to stir. It will bubble immediately and start to cook down. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes until the liquid is totally cooked out and the maple syrup starts to darken. Transfer the caramelized nuts to a food processor. Process for 7 to 10 minutes, stopping and scraping the bowl as necessary, until the pecans form into a thick and creamy caramelized pecan butter. It takes a while to come together, so just keep processing. Then, spread the pecan butter onto the cooled shortbread crust using a spatula. Spread it into an even layer; it doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect, but take care to make it as even as possible. Place the chocolate and coconut oil in a glass measuring cup. Microwave for 20 seconds at a time, stirring after each time, until melted (it took us about 3 20-second bursts). Be very careful not to overheat the chocolate! Pour the chocolate over the top of the bars and refrigerate until the chocolate layer is hardened, about 1 hour. When ready to serve, let the bars stand at room temperature for a few minutes so the chocolate comes to room temperature. Cut into 1 inch by 2.25-inch rectangles, to make 36 rectangles in all. Eat immediately or refrigerate until serving.\n\nBalsamic Grilled Chicken with Pecan Pesto\n\nIngredients For the pesto: 3 cups fresh basil leaves 2/3 cup parmesan cheese, freshly grated 1/2 cup pecan pieces 4 large cloves garlic, minced 1/2 teaspoon sea salt, plus more to taste 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper 2/3 cup pecan, olive or avocado oil For the chicken: 1/3 cup balsamic vinegar 1/4 cup coconut aminos 2 cloves garlic, minced 6 medium sized chicken breasts Process: Make the pesto: in a food processor or blender, pulse the ingredients for pesto: basil, parmesan cheese, pecans, garlic, salt and pepper.
