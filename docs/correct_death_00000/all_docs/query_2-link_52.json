        "text": "[As prepared for delivery]\n\nGood afternoon.\n\nA few weeks ago, I spoke at Gettysburg about the need to unite our nation.\n\nToday, here at Warm Springs, I want to talk about the need to heal our nation.\n\nOver these past few months there has been so much pain, so much suffering, so much loss in America.\n\nOver 225,000 people have lost their lives to a virus.\n\nMany of these lives lost in the cruelest way possible.\n\nAlone.\n\nAlone in a hospital room. Alone in a nursing home.\n\nNo family. No friends. No loved ones beside them in those final moments.\n\nIt haunts so many of the surviving families, families who were never given the chance to say goodbye.\n\nI know how it feels to lose someone you love. I know that deep black hole that opens up in your chest.\n\nThe tragic truth of our time is that COVID has left a deep and lasting wound in this country.\n\nMillions of Americans have lost their jobs. We see the empty store fronts and the shuttered businesses. The visible signs of lost hopes and broken dreams.\n\nBut what we don't see is all those parents staring at the ceiling late at night, wondering how they're going to pay the mortgage — how they're going to pay the rent — what are they going to do if one of their kids gets sick now that they've lost their health insurance?\n\nGrowing up I watched my father struggle to find work. He made what I call the longest walk any parent can make: up a short flight of stairs to tell their child you can't play on that Little League team anymore. You can't go back to your school.\n\nWe can't stay here in Scranton anymore. We have to move. There are good jobs in Delaware. And when I get one — I'll come back for you and your sister and your brother and your mom.\n\nMy father always said that a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity, your respect, your place in the community.\n\nRight now, on this autumn afternoon — millions of Americans all across this country feel they have lost all that.\n\nA season of protest has broken out all across the nation.\n\nSome of it is just senseless burning and looting and violence that can't be tolerated, and it won't.\n\nBut much of it is a cry for justice from communities that have long had the knee of injustice on their neck.\n\nThe names of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and Jacob Blake will not soon be forgotten.\n\nNot by me. Not by us. Not by this country.\n\nThey're going to inspire a new wave of justice in America.\n\nThese are all historic, painful crises. The insidious virus. Economic anguish. Systemic discrimination. Any one of them could have rocked a nation.\n\nYet. we've been hit by all three at once. But if we're honest with ourselves, the pain striking at the heart of our country goes back not months, but years.\n\nOur politics has for far too long been mean, bitter, and divisive.\n\nWe've stopped seeing the dignity in one another. We've stopped showing each other respect. Too many among us spend more time shouting than listening.\n\nMore time fighting than working together. More time demonizing and denigrating others than lifting them up.\n\nThe divisions in our nation are getting wider. Anger and suspicion are growing. Our wounds are getting deeper.\n\nAnd many wonder: has it gone too far? Have we passed the point of no return? Has the heart of this nation been turned to stone?\n\nI don't think so. I refuse to believe it. I know this country. I know our people. And I know we can unite and heal this nation.\n\nWarm Springs is a good place to talk about hope and healing. This is where Franklin Roosevelt came \"to use the therapeutic waters\" to rebuild himself.\n\nStricken by the polio virus in 1921, he suffered from paralysis. Like so many other Americans in those pre-vaccine decades, FDR longed to live an independent life, a life that wasn't defined by his illness.\n\nTo him, and to so many others facing physical challenges, Warm Springs offered therapy for the body and for the soul.\n\nBut it offered something else. FDR came looking for a cure, but it was the lessons he learned here that he used to lift a nation.\n\nHumility. Empathy. Courage. Optimism.\n\nThis place represented a way forward. A way of restoration. Of resilience. Of healing.\n\nIn the years that followed, FDR would come back to Warm Springs often to think about how to heal the nation and the world. And that's what he did. Lifting us out of the Great Depression. Defeating tyranny. Saving democracy.\n\nThen, it was here on April 12, 1945 that President Roosevelt died, a casualty of war as surely as any who fell in combat.\n\nThe Free World mourned. America's leaders wept. Maybe even more important was the reaction of the American people.\n\nNaval Chief Petty Officer Graham Jackson, a Black man, cried as he played his accordion in tribute to FDR not far from here.\n\nAnd the story is told that when FDR's funeral procession went by, a man collapsed in grief. A neighbor asked him, \"Did you know the president?\" \"No,\" the man said. \"But he knew me.\"\n\n\"But he knew me.\"\n\nFew words better describe the kind of president our nation needs right now.\n\nA president who's in it not for himself, but for others. A president who doesn't divide us — but unites us. A president who appeals not to the worst in us — but to the best. A president who cares less about his TV ratings — and more about the American people.A president who looks not to settle scores — but to find solutions. A president guided not by wishful thinking — but by science, reason, and fact.\n\nThat's the kind of president I will be.\n\nI'm running as a proud Democrat. But I will govern as an American president.\n\nI will work with Democrats and Republicans and I will work as hard for those who don't support me as for those who do.\n\nThat's the job of a president. It's a duty of care for everyone.\n\nThis place, Warm Springs, is a reminder that though broken, each of us can be healed. That as a people and a country, we can overcome a devastating virus. That we can heal a suffering world. That yes, we can restore our soul and save our country.\n\nIn his last hours, President Roosevelt was at work on a speech to be delivered the next day.\n\nIn it he was to say: \"Today ... we must cultivate the science of human relationships — the ability of all peoples, of all kinds, to live together and work together in the same world at peace.\"\n\nTo live together and work together.\n\nThat's how I see America. That's how I see the presidency, and that's how I see the future.\n\nI tell you this from my heart. I believe in an America of hope, not fear. Of unity, not division. Of love, not hate.\n\nThe presidency, though, is only one part of the American chorus. History isn't only a story of the great and the famous. No — our history is the story of We the People. Of all of us. Together.\n\nI have long said the story of America is the story of ordinary people doing extraordinary things. Change in our country comes when the voices of the powerless reach the ears of the powerful.\n\nPeople whose names we'll never know, but who risked their lives to, in the words of Dr. King, bend the \"arc of the moral universe...toward justice.\" Bending that arc is the work of our time.\n\nBut it will take all of us. Red States and Blue States, Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals. And I believe we can do it.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause we are the United States of America and there's nothing — nothing — that the American people can't do when we put our minds to it.\n\nWhen news of FDR's death went out on the wires, an editor in Chicago turned to his colleagues and said, \"Clear the decks for action.\"\n\nSo — I say to you today: If you give me the honor of serving as your President, clear the decks for action, for we will act.\n\nWe will act on the first day of my presidency to get COVID under control. We will act to pass my economic plan that will finally reward work — not wealth — in this country.\n\nWe will act to pass my health care plan to provide affordable, accessible health care to every American.\n\nWe will act to pass the Biden climate plan, meeting the challenge of the climate crisis while creating millions of new, high-paying union jobs.\n\nWe will act to address systemic racism in our country.\n\nWe will act to give working people a fair shot again in this country.\n\nAnd we will act to restore our faith in democracy and in each other.\n\nToday we are facing a public health crisis of historic proportions, and with winter at hand, it's getting worse. Just last Friday, 83,000 cases nationwide.\n\nSaturday — another 83,000 cases. Nearly 1,000 people a day are dying. Another 200,000 deaths are expected over the next few months.\n\nAnd the president keeps telling us not to worry. He keeps telling us \"we're turning the corner\".\n\nIt's as removed from reality and as offensive as when he told us the virus \"affects virtually nobody.\" Just the elderly as if they don't matter.\n\nOr when he said in response to the number of deaths in the nation, \"it is what it is\".\n\nWell, it is what it is because he is who he is.\n\nIn the spring the President declared that as commander in chief he was going to wage war on the virus.\n\nInstead, he's shrugged. He's swaggered. And he's surrendered.\n\nAnd then his Chief of Staff makes a stunning admission. Saying, quote, \"we're not going to control the pandemic.\"\n\n\"We're not going to control the pandemic\".\n\nIt's a capitulation — a waving of the white flag.\n\nAnd it's a window into a shocking truth about this White House. They never even tried.\n\nThink about all the front-line health professionals who have risked their lives for nine months in this pandemic. Think about all the first responders. Think about all the grocery store workers and delivery truck drivers and teachers and parents with their kids home from school. Think about all those who have lost their jobs. Think about all those who have been infected by this virus. Think about all those who have died.\n\nThey were giving their all while their president was giving up.\n\nWell, I'm here to tell you we can and will get control of this virus.\n\nAs president, I will never wave the white flag of surrender.\n\nJust imagine where we would be today with a president who had embraced wearing a mask instead of mocking it? Imagine where we would be with a president who practiced social distancing instead of holding super spreader events? Imagine where we would be with a comprehensive system for testing and tracing?\n\nI first put forward a detailed plan on how to deal with the virus in March. This administration ignored it.\n\nThen I released several more detailed plans in the months that followed. The most recent just last week. This administration has yet to offer a single plan.\n\nIt's just one reason that one of the most prestigious medical journals in the world, the New England Journal of Medicine, called this president \"dangerously incompetent\" — saying he had turned a crisis into a tragedy.\n\nI'm ready to act. We know what to do. And starting on Day One of my presidency, we will do it.\n\nI've talked about the battle for the soul of America since the very beginning of this campaign.\n\nAnd I want to be very clear in these closing days about what I mean. And about what I intend to do in the battle to assure that our better angels prevail over our worst instincts.\n\nI believe this election is about who we are as a nation, what we believe — and maybe most importantly — who we want to be.\n\nIt is about our essence. It's about what makes us Americans. It's that fundamental.\n\nTime and again throughout our history, we have seen the Charlatans, the Con-Men, the phony Populists — who have sought to play to our fears, appeal to our worst appetites, and pick at the oldest scabs we have for their own political gain.\n\nThey appear when the nation has been hit the hardest and we're at our most vulnerable.\n\nNever to solve anything. Always to benefit themselves.\n\nIn his recent encyclical Pope Francis warns us against this phony populism that appeals to the \"basest and most selfish\" instincts.\n\nThen he says this:\n\n\"Politics is something more noble than posturing, marketing and media spin. These sow nothing but division, conflict and a bleak cynicism...\"\n\nFor those who seek to lead, \"we do well to ask ourselves\": \"Why I am doing this?\" \"What is my real aim?\"\n\nPope Francis has asked questions that anyone who seeks to lead this great nation should answer.\n\nAnd my answer is this: To unite this nation. To heal this nation.\n\nThe Bible tells us that there is a time to break down, and a time to build up. And a time to heal. This is that time.\n\nGod and history have called us to this moment and to this mission:\n\nWith our voices and our votes, we must free ourselves from the forces of darkness, from the forces of division, and from the forces of yesterday — from the forces that pull us apart, hold us down, and hold us back.\n\nAnd if we do so, we will once more become one nation, under God, indivisible.\n\nA nation united.\n\nA nation strengthened. A nation healed.\n\nThat is my goal.\n\nThat is what we must do.\n\nThank you.\n\nMay God bless America.\n\nMay God protect our troops."
