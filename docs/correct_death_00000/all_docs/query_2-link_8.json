Across the country and around the world, people reacted with shock and sadness. The stress and strain of the job takes a toll on every president. FDR endured the pressure for over 12 years, longer than any other president.\n\nDespite running for and winning a record fourth term in 1944, FDR’s health was declining. An examination by his doctors revealed a variety of heart ailments, high blood pressure, and bronchitis. Challenged by his disability and advancing health problems, FDR still traveled great distances to Canada and Hawaii for wartime conferences, enduring more stress. Roosevelt also attended the Yalta Conference in February 1945, his last meeting with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin. Churchill and Stalin were shocked by FDR’s appearance.\n\nSeeking rest and relaxation, Roosevelt retreated to the Little White House in Warm Springs, Georgia, accompanied by a small entourage. Sitting for a portrait, he suffered a massive cerebral hemorrhage and died. As news spread, thousands of Americans flocked to the route to Washington to pay their respects, many weeping as his funeral train passed. His body was brought to Washington then to New York where he was buried in the rose garden of his Springwood estate on April 15, 1945. \n\nThe funeral procession after FDR’s death is depicted in artist Leonard Baskin’s bronze bas relief in the fourth room of the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial. It’s a powerful scene commemorating the moment when the nation lost one of its most iconic leaders.\n\nPhotos by National Park Service.\n#NationalMall #FDRMemorial #WashingtonDC\".",
