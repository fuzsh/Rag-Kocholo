        "text": "The Roosevelt family is one of the most storied names in American history. Their lineage includes two presidents, numerous other political figures, socialites, and a First Lady. The Roosevelts hail from New York, and one of the family’s most famous members, Franklin D. Roosevelt, was born in Hyde Park in 1882. Despite his Empire State heritage, he was also quite closely associated with Georgia thanks to how much time he spent here. In fact, his residence here was known as the Little White House. FDR is so closely tied to the history of Warm Springs, Georgia, that it’s rare to hear the little town’s name without a reference to the president. These are the most famous mineral springs in Georgia thanks to their association with one of the most well-known names in American history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more information about Roosevelt’s Little White House Historic Site, check out the National Parks Service website.\n\nWant more Georgia in your inbox?\n\nGet the latest on things to see, do, and eat around Georgia!\n\nspinner\n\nThank you!\n\nAn error occured.\n\nFeatured Addresses\n\nWarm Springs, GA 31830, USA"
