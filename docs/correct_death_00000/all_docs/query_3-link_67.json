Here on the banks of the San Juan River, our mineral-rich, geothermal water means even more. The Springs Resort is built around one of the Earth’s original wellness destinations. The physical, mental, and spiritual benefits of our hot springs run deep. Some say deeper than the Mother Spring that feeds them.\n\nThis is a place of vitality and profound renewal… a natural hot springs destination in one of Colorado’s most picturesque mountain towns, where wide-open spaces and room to breathe come naturally. An experience that brings us together and yet can be deeply personal, a place of healing and belonging; can a resort be transformative? We think so.\n\nRooms & Suites\n\nWant to relax a little longer? Our welcoming rooms and suites are steps from our hot spring soaking pools. And whether you’re close to the Mother Spring, the wellness studio, or overlooking the San Juan River, you’ll enjoy 24-hour access to the pools, including VIP access to the adult-only Relaxation Terrace. These special round-the-clock soaking privileges for our guests in our “dark sky community” take star gazing to a whole new level. When you’re ready to retire for a night of rest and renewal, enjoy our Deep Sleep Tray, which is included in every room, and features a curation of deep sleep essentials, like aromatherapy towelettes and sleep techniques recommended by our Medical Director Dr. Marcus Coplin.\n\nExplore Our Rooms"
