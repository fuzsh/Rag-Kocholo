        "text": "Snowy Friday, then a frigid weekend on tap before warmer temps return next week. A few more snow showers are possible through the evening and into Saturday.\n\nAdditional accumulations should be less than an inch. Blowing and drifting may still cause some slippery roads. Frigid wind chills will drop below zero on Saturday morning. But, a warm-up is on the way and, by the middle of next week, even the overnight lows are above freezing.\n\nUPDATES |\n\nWINTER WEATHER ADVISORY in effect until 1 a.m. Saturday for most of Central and Southern Ohio. Additional snow accumulations may create slippery roads.\n\nBlowing and drifting snow may cover roads that have already been treated or cleared. Use extra caution while traveling.\n\nHistorical note: January 19 is the anniversary of the coldest day ever recorded in Columbus. On this date in 1994, the early-morning low temperature was -22F with a daytime high of -1F. Today is the 30th anniversary!\n\nFRIDAY NIGHT: mainly cloudy, scattered snow showers, low 9, wind chills -5F or colder.\n\nSATURDAY: frigid morning, a few snow showers, windy, cold, high 18.\n\nSUNDAY: mostly sunny, cold, high 24.\n\nMONDAY: partly cloudy in the morning with clouds increasing during the day, milder, more melting, high 35.\n\nTUESDAY: mainly overcast, scattered wintry mix early becoming rain during the day, windy, warmer, high 41.\n\nWEDNESDAY: cloudy, scattered rain showers, milder, high 44.\n\nTHURSDAY: cloudy, scattered rain showers, very mild, high 48.\n\nFRIDAY: mainly cloudy, scattered rain showers, mild, high 50.\n\nAt midday Friday, snowfall reports around Central Ohio range from 1” in Northwestern Delaware County to 3” in Western Hocking County, so most of the region is reporting within the 1-3” expected range.\n\nThe snow and slippery roads were enough to close schools and create a hazardous morning commute.\n\nThis afternoon, most of Ohio is cloudy with sunshine breaking through now and then. The brief sun is helping with some melting on dark, heat-absorbing surfaces, even with air temperatures in the mid-20s.\n\nOccasional flurries and snow showers are possible through the afternoon and evening, with some additional light accumulations possible.\n\nOhio is wedged between low pressure off the East Coast and high pressure in the Great Plains. That squeeze is creating some gusty winds and a very cold flow from the north. With air temperatures in the single digits, wind chills will drop below zero Saturday morning.\n\nStrong winds from the northwest are expected to create some lake-effect snow showers that get carried from Lake Michigan all the way to Central Ohio. Saturday accumulations should be patchy and minimal, mainly less than 1”.\n\nMORE | | |\n\nHigh pressure returns to the area on Sunday with some welcome sunshine and [slightly] warmer temperatures. The sunshine should assist with some melting on dark surfaces, including pavement.\n\nThe high moves off the East Coast on Monday, boosting our temperatures with a southwesterly flow, and making way for our next series of weather makers.\n\nDueling systems in the Great Lakes and the Deep South create wet conditions across the eastern third of the US on Tuesday; rain from the Gulf Coast to Chicago and snow across the Upper Great Lakes.\n\nOhio stays on the warmer side of the system and gets plenty of rain. Mild temperatures and rain continue for the remainder of the work week."
