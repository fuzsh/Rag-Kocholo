        "text": "BUFFALO – A lake effect snow warning remains in effect for much of Western New York – including Chautauqua County – until 1 p.m. Saturday. However, the forecast is calling for the heaviest amounts of snow to fall north of the Jamestown area, primarily near the Lake Shore in northern Chautauqua County and Southern Erie County.\n\nIn Jamestown, the forecast is calling for only a few inches of snow to fall throughout the day and later tonight. The temperature is only expected to reach the teens today and combined with the wind chill, it will still make for colder than normal conditions for those venturing outdoors.\n\nAs a result of the storm, dozens of schools, government offices, service organizations and businesses were closed or operating on a delay Friday morning, including several in Chautauqua County.\n\nAs a result of the most recent blast of winter weather in the region, Governor Andrew Cuomo has activated the New York State Emergency Operations Center. The current storm is forecasted to bring heavy snow, dropping 2 to 3 feet of snow south and east of Buffalo, and at least 3 feet of snow north of Syracuse through Watertown.\n\nIn anticipation of the storm, Governor Cuomo on Thursday directed state agencies to prepare resources in response to the expected heavy snowfall and he also ordered that parts of the New York State Thruway in Western New York be closed – primarily in areas of Erie and Niagara Counties."
