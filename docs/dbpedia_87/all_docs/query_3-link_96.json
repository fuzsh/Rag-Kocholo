        "text": "This is the time of the year when we are surprised by the arrival of huge amounts of snow just inland from the shoreline of one of the Great Lakes. We shouldn’t be surprised because all the ingredients are there – cold air, a relatively warm lake and the unique weather that occurs near a shoreline.\n\nWe have the arrival of cold quite dry Arctic air. It flows over warm open water for a long distance and the lower part of the air gets warmer and picks up moisture. This warm lower layer, under a cold upper layer, creates what is called a convective instability and since the warm air is lighter than the surrounding air it starts to rise. This is just like heating a pot of water on the stove - warmer water, heated by the element at the bottom, starts to rise. As the air rises, it cools and clouds are produced. As the air approaches the shoreline, it starts to slow down because of the increased friction over the land. The air starts to pile up and rises even faster. The land itself rises as we move further inland. The air has nowhere to go except up which triggers the formation of snow squalls.\n\nHow strong these squalls are depends on (1) the temperature difference between the cold air and the warm water and (2) how much of the lake surface is ice free because moisture is like fuel feeding the production of snow.\n\nHow far the snow squall will travel inland depends on when the cold wind arrives. The maximum distance will occur in late fall and early winter.\n\nOften snow squalls will be light and cover a large area, but they can also be heavy and restricted to one area in the form of a streamer. Streamers over Owen Sound can make their way to Barrie. Another favourite location for a streamer is over Goderich flowing toward London.\n\nLake-effect snow squalls can persist for long periods of time – often 48 hours over a very narrow region. Up to 120 cm of snow has been observed from a single intense storm cell over a 24-hour period."
