        "text": "Hazardous Weather Outlooks, Watches, Warnings and Advisories\n\nImportant Note: The criteria listed below apply to the service area of the National Weather Service (NWS) Forecast Office in Upton, NY.\n\nClick to see NWS Eastern Region Winter Warning and Advisory Criteria\n\nGeneral Definitions\n\nOutlook\n\nIndicates the potential for significant weather events up to 7 days in advance with a forecaster confidence around 30%.\n\nWatch\n\nIndicates that conditions are favorable for the particular weather event in and near the Watch area, and which may pose a risk to life and property. Watches are issued up to 48 hours in advance with forecaster confidence around 50%.\n\nWarning/Advisory\n\nIndicates that a particular weather event is imminent or occurring. Advisories are issued if the weather event will lead to nuisance conditions, while Warnings are issued for significant weather events which will pose a risk to life and property. Warnings and Advisories are issued up to 48 hours in advance with forecaster confidence of at least 80%.\n\nNote: Watches and Warnings issued for Severe Thunderstorms, Tornadoes, and Flash Flooding have much shorter lead times, on the order of hours for Watches or even minutes for Warnings.\n\nFire Weather Watches and Warnings\n\nRed Flag Warning\n\nIssued to indicate that the combination of dry fuels and weather conditions will support extreme fire danger and/or fire behavior, including the potential for widespread new ignitions or control problems with existing fires. Warning criteria typical for the spring and fall are winds sustained or frequently gusting above 25 mph, relative humidity less than 30%, and widespread rainfall less than 1/4 inch during the previous three or more days. In the summer, the rainfall criteria is extended to five or more days, as well as a Keetch-Byram Drought Index above 300 which indicates at least the top three inches of the ground are sufficiently dry. A Red Flag Warning may or may not be preceded by a Fire Weather Watch.\n\nFlood Watches, Warnings, and Advisories\n\nFlash Flood Warning\n\nIssued when flash flooding is imminent, generally within the next 6 hours. This is usually issued based on observed heavy rainfall (measured or radar estimated) for dangerous small stream or urban flooding, but may also be issued for significant dam or levee failures that have occurred or are imminent.\n\nFlood Warning for River Forecast Point\n\nIssued when a river gauge is forecast to exceed a predetermined flood stage.\n\nAreal Flood Warning\n\nIssued when widespread general flooding is forecast to occur throughout an identifiable geographic area.\n\nFlood Advisory\n\nIssued when flooding is forecast to occur, generally within the next 6 hours, but is not expected to substantially threaten life and property.\n\nCoastal Flood Warning\n\nIssued when at least moderate tidal flooding is forecast to occur along coastal areas.\n\nCoastal Flood Advisory\n\nIssued when minor tidal flooding is forecast to occur along coastal areas.\n\nMarine Weather Watches, Warnings, and Advisories\n\nHurricane Force Wind Warning\n\nIssued when a non-tropical system is forecast to produce sustained winds or frequent gusts of 64 knots or greater.\n\nStorm Warning\n\nIssued for sustained winds or frequent gusts of 48 to 63 knots, not associated with a tropical system.\n\nGale Warning\n\nIssued for sustained winds or frequent gusts of 34 to 47 knots, not associated with a tropical system.\n\nSmall Craft Advisory\n\nIssued for sustained winds or frequent gusts of 25 to 33 knots and/or hazardous seas with waves of 5 feet or higher.\n\nSpecial Marine Warning\n\nIssued to convey information regarding hazardous convective activity or other short-term weather events occurring over the water or which may impact those on the water that are not covered by the current forecast.\n\nDense Fog Advisory\n\nIssued when widespread fog is expected to reduce visibilitiy to 1 nautical mile or less.\n\nFreezing Spray Advisory\n\nIssued when freezing spray is expected to pose a significant hazard to marine vessels.\n\nHigh Surf Advisory\n\nIssued when expected high/rough surf poses a threat to life and/or property during the beach season ( typically late May through September).\n\nLow Water Advisory\n\nIssued when tidal levels are expected to be low enough to cause problems for shipping and other marine interests.\n\nTsunami Warning\n\nIssued by the National Tsunami Warning Center under the ANCTSUAT1 and ANCTSUATE products. The TSUAT1 product is a tabular formatted product that contains technical details of the tsunami including location, magnitude and forecasted arrival time(s). The TSUATE product is a narrative styled product that will contain the same warning/watch information as the TSUAT1 product, but presented in a less technical style suitable for the general public\n\nNon-Precipitation Watches, Warnings, and Advisories\n\nHigh Wind Warning\n\nIssued when sustained winds of 40 mph or greater are forecast for 1 hour or longer, or wind gusts of 58 mph or greater for any duration.\n\nWind Advisory\n\nIssued when sustained winds of 30 to 39 mph are forecast for 1 hour or longer, or wind gusts of 46-57 mph for any duration.\n\nExcessive Heat Warning\n\nIssued when heat index values are forecast to reach or exceed 105°F for at least 2 consecutive hours.\n\nHeat Advisory\n\nIssued when the heat index is forecast to reach 95F or greater for at least 2 consecutive days or 100 to 104F for any length of time.\n\nFreeze Warning\n\nIssued when overnight minimum temperatures are forecast to reach 32F or lower during the growing season. They are usually issued to highlight the first few freezes of the fall, or unusually late freezes in the spring.\n\nFrost Advisory\n\nIssued when conditions are favorable for frost development during the growing season due to overnight minimum temperatures falling between 33°F to 36°F.\n\nAir Quality Alert\n\nIssued by the NYSDEC (Department of Environmental Conservation), NJDEP (Department of Environmental Protection), and/or CTDEP when ground ozone concentrations and/or particulate matter are forecast to become unhealthy for sensitve groups of people(Air Quality Index greater than or equal to 100).\n\nDense Fog Advisory\n\nIssued when widespread fog is expected to reduce visibilitiy to 1/4 mile or less.\n\nSevere Weather Watches, Warnings, and Statements\n\nSevere Thunderstorm Warning\n\nIssued when there is evidence based on radar or a reliable spotter report that a thunderstorm is producing, or forecast to produce, wind gusts of 58 mph or greater, structural wind damage, and/or hail 1 inch in diameter or greater.\n\nSevere Thunderstorm Watch\n\nIssued by the Storm Prediction Center when conditions are favorable for the development of severe thunderstorms over a larger-scale region for a duration of at least 3 hours. Tornadoes are not expected in such situations, but isolated tornado development can also occur.\n\nTornado Warning\n\nIssued when there is evidence based on radar or a reliable spotter report that a tornado is imminent or occurring.\n\nTornado Watch\n\nIssued by the Storm Prediction Center when conditions are favorable for the development of severe thunderstorms and multiple tornadoes over a larger-scale region for a duration of at least 3 hours.\n\nSpecial Weather Statement for Near Severe Thunderstorms\n\nIssued for strong thunderstorms that are below severe levels, but still may have some adverse impacts. Usually issued for the threat of wind gusts of 40-58 mph or small hail less than 1 inch in diameter.\n\nExtreme Wind Warning\n\nIssued when surface winds of 100 knots (115 MPH) or greater associated with non-convective winds, a derecho (NOT associated with a tornado), or sustained hurricane winds (eyewall of a category 3) are expected to occur within one hour.\n\nTropical Weather Watches and Warnings\n\nHurricane Warning\n\nIssued by the National Hurricane Center when sustained winds of 74 mph or higher are forecast within the specified area. Because hurricane preparedness activities become difficult once winds reach tropical storm force, the hurricane warning is issued 36 hours in advance of the anticipated onset of tropical-storm-force winds.\n\nHurricane Watch\n\nIssued by the National Hurricane Center when sustained winds of 74 mph or higher are possible within the specified coastal area. Because hurricane preparedness activities become difficult once winds reach tropical storm force, the hurricane watch is issued 48 hours in advance of the anticipated onset of tropical-storm-force winds.\n\nTropical Storm Warning\n\nIssued by the National Hurricane Center when sustained winds between 39 and 73 mph are forecast within the specified coastal area within 36 hours.\n\nTropical Storm Watch\n\nIssued by the National Hurricane Center when sustained winds between 39 and 73 mph are possible within the specified coastal area within 48 hours.\n\nStorm Surge Warning\n\nIssued when there is danger of life-threatening inundation (3 ft or greater AGL) from rising water moving inland from the shoreline somewhere within the specified area, generally within 36 hours, in association with a tropical, subtropical, or post-tropical cyclone.\n\nStorm Surge Watch\n\nIssued when there is potential of life-threatening inundation (3 ft or greater AGL) from rising water moving inland from the shoreline somewhere within the specified area, generally within 48 hours, in association with a tropical, subtropical, or post-tropical cyclone.\n\nExtreme Wind Warning\n\nIssued when surface winds of 100 knots (115 MPH) or greater associated with non-convective, derecho(NOT associated with a tornado), or sustained hurricane winds (eyewall of a category 3) are expected to occur within one hour.\n\nWinter Season Watches, Warnings, and Advisories\n\nWinter Storm Warning\n\nIssued for a winter weather event in which there is more than one of the following: snow, sleet, and ice (freezing rain), and one of the warning criteria is met. The warning criteria for snow is 6 inches expected in a 12 hour period, or 8 inches expected in a 24 hour period. The warning criteria for ice is accumulations meeting or exceeding 1/2 inch. A winter storm warning may also be issued for heavy snow combined with strong winds of 25-34 mph that will cause blowing and drifting of the snow. A warning may still be warranted if the event is expected to exceed advisory criteria, but fall just short of warning criteria and will significantly impact mass transit and/or utilities.\n\nBlizzard Warning\n\nIssued for sustained winds or frequent gusts greater than or equal to 35 mph accompanied by falling and/or blowing snow, frequently reducing visibility to less than 1/4 mile for three hours or more.\n\nIce Storm Warning\n\nIssued when freezing rain is expected to produce ice accumulations of 1/2 inch or greater, or cause significant disruptions to travel or utilities.\n\nWind Chill Warning\n\nIssued when wind chill values will reach -25°F or colder.\n\nWinter Weather Advisory\n\nIssued for a winter weather event in which there is more than one of the following: snow, sleet, and ice (freezing rain), and one of the advisory criteria is met but does not exceed warning criteria. In addition, a winter weather advisory will be issued for an all-snow event if the advisory criteria is met but does not exceed the warning criteria. The advisory criteria is 3 inches of snow and/or sleet expected in a 12 hour period, or a trace of ice accumulation. An advisory may still be warranted if lesser accumulations will significantly impact mass transit and/or utilities.\n\nWind Chill Advisory\n\nIssued when wind chill values will reach -15°F to -24°F."
