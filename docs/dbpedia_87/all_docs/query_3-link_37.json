        "text": "The next couple days are shaping up to be quite snowy as the National Weather Service has issued Lake Effect Snow Warnings and Winter Storm Watches for our northern counties starting Monday afternoon.\n\nA strong system is currently crossing the Great Lakes region that will bring a quick hit of rain to Syracuse overnight. The main effect this system will have is the strong westerly winds it'll produce after it passes by. That'll ramp up lake effect snow showers through Wednesday morning for the area.\n\nLet's knock out timing of the snow accumulation. By Monday night, relatively light accumulation across the lower elevations with a couple inches possible for the Tug Hill Plateau.\n\nTuesday morning, the persistent lake effect snow band will continue to drop heavy snow in the higher elevations with accumulation beginning to mount for central Oswego County.\n\nBy Tuesday afternoon, lake effect snow will push south towards Syracuse with light to moderate snow during overnight hours on Wednesday.\n\nBy Wednesday morning, 2-4\" of snow accumulation is possible in Syracuse with gradually higher snowfall totals the further north you are.\n\nBy Wednesday afternoon southwesterly winds should help escort the lake effect snow north of the area.\n\nTotal snowfall accumulation through Wednesday afternoon:\n\nOswego: 4-8\"\n\nSyracuse: 2-4\"\n\nTug Hill region: 12-20\"\n\nPulaski: 5-10\"\n\nRome: 3-6\"\n\nUtica: 2-5\"\n\nSkaneateles: 1-3\"\n\nThese accumulation numbers will likely change a bit with updated model runs tonight and tomorrow.\n\nFor the latest forecast and live local radar click ."
