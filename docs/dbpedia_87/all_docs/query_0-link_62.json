        "text": "A Winter Weather Advisory continues through the rest of the night across our area. Light snowfall totals are expected, with the exception of lake-effect snow bands in southwest Michigan.\n\nTonight we see both system snow (although very light in nature) and lake effect snow showers, especially near the state line and north. Lows drop to near 0.\n\nSunday will be brutally cold, and we still see lake effect snow in SW Michigan.\n\nMainly in Michigan, another 3-6\" of fresh snow accumulation is possible.\n\nHighs will only be near 5 but the wind chill will be -15 to -25 most of the day. This air continues into the week.\n\nHighs on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday will only be in the single-digits. Temperatures will dip below zero Sunday and Monday nights. Wind chills will likely stay below zero Sunday through Tuesday night. This is going to be an extended period of bitterly cold weather."
