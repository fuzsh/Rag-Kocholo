        "text": "Syracuse, N.Y. -- The season’s first big lake effect snowstorm is expected to slam Tug Hill and Western New York this week.\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued a lake effect snow warning for the Tug Hill plateau, including Jefferson, Lewis and Oswego counties; and for Western New York, including Wyoming, Chautauqua, Cattaraugus, and southern Erie counties.\n\n“Heavy lake effect snow expected, (with) total snow accumulations of 9 to 16 inches in the most persistent lake snows, with local amounts up to 20 inches across the Tug Hill plateau,” the weather service said\n\nStrong west winds, with gusts up to 35 mph, “will produce areas of blowing and drifting snow,” according to the weather service.\n\nSnow is expected to start late Monday morning in Western New York and Monday afternoon in the North Country. Heavy snow could blow through Wednesday morning, with snowfall rates reaching 1 to 2 inches per hour.\n\nThe snow is also expected to reach into the western Adirondacks, where the weather service has issued a less severe winter storm watch for Hamilton and northern Herkimer counties.\n\nBy Tuesday night, the winds will shift slightly and are expected to bring snow to Central New York.\n\n“Lake effect snow showers will drop southward on Tuesday, which will bring some impactful snow accumulations to the NY Thruway corridor,” the weather service said.\n\nSyracuse is expected to see about 3 inches, according to the weather service. Lake effect snow bands can be narrow and oscillating, however, so it’s hard to predict exact snowfall totals days in advance."
