        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio (WOIO) - A Winter Storm Watch has been issued for Cuyahoga, Lake, Geauga and Ashtabula counties for 1 AM Monday until 1 AM Wednesday.\n\nPockets of heavy lake effect snow could produce 1″-2″ of snow per hour along with blowing and drifting snow due to the high winds.\n\nAcross parts of our primary and secondary snowbelts, expect travel to be difficult.\n\nSnowfall totals in some spots could exceed 4″ where the strongest bands of snow set up.\n\nToday was our last quiet weather day before bigger changes arrive Sunday.\n\nThose traveling west early Sunday will likely run into rain and a changeover to snow west of here through the day.\n\nThis could lead to slick road conditions, so please budget extra time to get where you need to be safely.\n\nWe are tracking a strong system Sunday which will locally bring widespread rain to Northeast Ohio tomorrow afternoon.\n\nAs temperatures plunge overnight behind Sunday’s cold front, lake-effect snow will develop across our primary and secondary snowbelts.\n\nMonday and Tuesday are 19 First Alert Weather Days for our snowbelt communities as this will be the zone with the greatest snow impacts.\n\nAt this time, areas east of Cleveland look to see the highest chance of snow.\n\nWe are eyeing the far eastern portions of Cuyahoga, northern Geauga, southern Lake and central Ashtabula counties as the spots which could receive the most snow.\n\nWinds will be quite gusty on Monday and Tuesday as gusts could top 35 mph.\n\nTravel impacts will be anticipated under the most persistent bands with bursts of heavy snow and graupel possible.\n\nOutside of our lake effect zones, snow will be more limited early next week but temperatures will stay below average.\n\nThe coldest day looks to be Tuesday with highs struggling to make it out of the 20s in many spots but with the wind chill, it will feel more like the single digits to teens most of the day.\n\nLimit time outside and make sure you and the pets stay warm if you have to be out and about.\n\nAdditional chances for rain and snow look possible through much of next week with some gradual temperature improvements by the end of the work week.\n\nStay with the First Alert Weather Team as we continue to closely monitor this wintry stretch of weather next week."
