With our wind chill advisory in effect until tomorrow at noon, limit time outdoors as much as possible. Based on forecasted conditions, frostbite could develop in 15-20 minutes if skin is exposed for too long. Lake effect snow develops overnight for a small portion of our area, mainly impacting Berrien County and the northwest section of Cass. Accumulations hang around 1-2\" for the previously mentioned counties with heightened travel impacts going into Monday and Tuesday. The bitter cold lasts through Tuesday despite the sun peeking out at us approaching the middle of the week. We'll be back in the upper teens for our highs Wednesday afternoon as a chance for snow enters the area Wednesday night.\n\nTonight: Partly cloudy, frigidly cold. Low -6.\n\nMonday (Martin Luther King Jr. Day): Overcast, frigidly cold. High 4.\n\nTuesday: Partly cloudy, frigidly cold. High 3.\n\nWednesday: Partly cloudy. High 19."
