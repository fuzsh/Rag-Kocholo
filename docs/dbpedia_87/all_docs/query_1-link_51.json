        "text": "The WSBT 22 team of Meteorologists is tracking a major winter storm that will arrive Friday morning.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nThe precipitation starts out as snow, but then mixes with rain at times through the day. The farther south you live, the more rain and less snow you’ll see.\n\nHeavy snow is likely for our northern communities for the entire event. This is why the highest snow totals will be in our northern areas. The rain to snow line will wobble and this will affect the snow totals across the region. There may be a brief break in precipitation Friday evening before the snow picks up again Friday night. Friday night will feature just snow for most of the area.\n\nThis system will move out early Saturday but with colder air and winds blowing across Lake Michigan, lake effect snow bands will develop Saturday afternoon and continue through Sunday.\n\nA Winter Storm Warning will be in effect starting at 10 a.m. Friday until 7pm Saturday for all Southwest Michigan as well as LaPorte and St. Joseph counties in Indiana. 4-8” of snow is expected during this time. The rest of the area will be under a Winter Weather Advisory during the same time period. 3-5” of snow is expected during this time with rain wrapping in.\n\nThere will be a sharp cutoff in snow totals depending on where the rain/snow line falls. There is still some uncertainty of the exact location of where this line will be during the day on Friday. We will update the forecast amounts often be as specific as possible as this storm moves in over the next 24 hrs. We do expect this heavy, wet snow to impact driving during the day Friday with several inches and then adding up to more Friday night.\n\nSaturday will feature system snow in the morning transitioning to lake effect snow with windy conditions. Blowing and drifting snow will be a major concern at this time. It is still too far out to nail down specific lake effect snow totals, but with the arctic blast we are predicting to move in by Sunday, this could also become a significant lake effect snow event, especially in our Michigan counties. Visibility will be low and driving across southwest Michigan will be treacherous.\n\nSunday through early next week we focus our attention on arctic air and dangerous wind chills. Wind chills during this time will be anywhere from -15 to -25 on average. Please keep an eye on pets and elderly neighbors during this time! Other things that don’t work as well during cold streaks like this may occurs as well like cars not running as well, frozen pipes, heat running constantly, salt on roads works slower etc."
