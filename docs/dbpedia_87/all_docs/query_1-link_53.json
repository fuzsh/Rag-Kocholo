        "text": "Snow blanketed West Michigan Friday through Saturday, bringing several inches areawide.\n\nThrough daybreak Saturday morning, some areas had seen as much as 6 to 10 inches of new snowfall accumulation. Whipping winds combined with the heavy wet snow\n\nAs that system departs, attention shifts to bitter cold air and intense lake effect snow into Sunday. Lake effect snow had already picked up in intensity into the evening.\n\nRelated:\n\nWinter weather alerts, issued by the National Weather Service, were extended through noon Sunday in most cases due to additional lake effect snow expected to intensify Saturday night through early Sunday.\n\nLake effect quickly caused roads to deteriorate again Saturday evening, especially across portions of Van Buren, Kalamazoo, Allegan, Barry, Ottawa and Kent counties.\n\nAdditional accumulations up to 6 to 9 inches were expected through portions of Allegan, Barry, Eaton, Ottawa, Kent and Ionia counties especially. This is where a more dominant and intense lake effect band was forecast to develop late Saturday.\n\nArctic air spilling into the region was to blame for Saturday night's lake effect snow. Temperatures were already dropping, expected to plummet even more Sunday and Monday.\n\nHigh temperatures will struggle to make it into the low teens Sunday afternoon, with the coldest air curling around the southern tip of Lake Michigan.\n\nA wind chill advisory was issued for counties along the Michigan/Indiana state line. It was scheduled from 12 a.m. through 1 p.m. Sunday for wind chills as cold as -25 degrees.\n\nTemperatures by early Monday morning are likely to bottom our below, with wind chills potentially even colder for more of West Michigan. Monday afternoon's forecast high of 7 degrees would be the coldest daytime high since Jan. 31, 2019.\n\nBitter cold temperatures with additional snow chances look to continue throughout the coming work week.\n\nForecast:\n\nIt looks like temperatures are likely to remain below the freezing mark through at least early to mid next week.\n\nRead more:"
