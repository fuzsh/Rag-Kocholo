        "text": "Temperatures overnight Sunday in metro Detroit will drop to the coldest they've been this winter, according to National Weather Service meteorologists.\n\nNWS White Lake office meteorologists said a wind chill advisory will be in effect for the entire state beginning at 6 p.m. Sunday\n\n\"We're going to drop into the lower single digits for an overnight low, but with the winds it's going to feel more like the -20s,\" NWS White Lake meteorologist Alex Manion said.\n\nFor the Detroit area, Manion said, there's a forecasted low of about -5 degrees, but with the windchill it could feel like about -22.\n\nManion said it will feel the coldest in the early to mid-morning hours of Monday.\n\nSara Pampreen, also a meteorologist at NWS White Lake, said Sunday afternoon that freezing temperatures tonight and Monday will be the coldest the area has seen all winter.\n\nThe incoming chill is also expected to be the coldest the metro Detroit will get in the next week.\n\nPampreen said metro Detroit may see some cold air returning toward the end of the week, but it won't be quite as cold as what the area will see overnight Sunday.\n\nThe wind chill advisory will lift at noon tomorrow, but meteorologists say there won't be much of a warm up. Manion said it'll be sunny again, but the high for the Detroit area will be around 14 degrees.\n\nThe NWS also warned of lake effect snow expected in the state's thumb, in addition to \"dangerous wind chills.\"\n\nAccording to an urgent Winter Weather Message from the NWS, a winter weather advisory will be in effect for Huron and Sanilac counties, plus the cities of Bad Axe and Sandusky until 7 a.m. Monday. But, a wind chill advisory will be in effect from 6 p.m. Sunday until noon on Monday.\n\n\"Lake effect snow and very cold wind chills expected. Occasional snow showers today through tonight. Total snow accumulations from this morning through late tonight will range anywhere from an inch up to 7 inches, with the higher accumulations confined to locations along the Lake Huron shoreline from Port Austin down to Forestville,\" the advisory said.\n\nSunday's NWS advisory added that north winds gusting between 20 and 30 mph will lead to blowing snow, and wind chills as low as 20-below-zero are expected tonight and Monday morning.\n\n\"Plan on snow covered roads and poor visibilities,\" the advisory said. \"The cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.\"\n\nThe NWS added that a winter weather advisory for snow means that periods of snow will primarily cause travel difficulties and to take caution in light of snow covered roads, plus limited visibilities.\n\n\"A wind chill advisory means that cold air and the wind will combine to create low wind chills,\" the advisory said.\n\n\"Make sure you wear a hat and gloves.\"\n\nMore on freep.com:\n\nSnow piling up throughout southeast Michigan communities\n\nTwo feet of snow, -40 degrees possible as storm roars East\n\nSaturday's snow totals\n\nManion also shared Saturday's snow totals with the Free Press.\n\nHe said 5.8-inches total were recorded on Saturday at the Detroit Metro Airport, and a close range was recorded consistently across Wayne County, which got between 5 to 6 inches.\n\nThe Washtenaw County/Ann Arbor area received between 4 and 6.5 inches, and Manion added that Monroe County received from 5 to 7 inches.\n\nManion added that two Michigan cities that received some of the most snowfall, were Temperance with 7 inches recorded and Newport with 7.5 inches.\n\nMarine weather message\n\nAn urgent marine weather message was also issued by NWS Detroit/Pontiac early Sunday, warning of freezing spray, gusty winds and northerly gales over southern Lake Huron and western Lake Erie on Sunday morning.\n\nThe messages added that the gales will slowly increase today and tonight, while the winds are expected to diminish quickly on Monday.\n\n\"Frigid airmass will continue to cause heavy freezing spray over most of Lake Huron, with snow squalls over the southern Basin through tonight. Winds become southerly and strengthen on Tuesday as warmer air moves back into the region,\" the message said.\n\nNaming the areas of Harbor Beach to Port Sanilac, and Port Sanilac to Port Huron, the NWS said a gale warning is now in effect until 5 p.m., a heavy freezing spray warning will be in effect until 1 a.m. Monday and a small craft advisory will be in effect form 6 p.m. on Sunday to 7 a.m. Monday.\n\n\"During the gale warning, expect sustained winds up to 30 knots from the north with gusts up to 38 knots. The largest expected significant waves will be 10 feet with a potential maximum wave height of 14 feet,\" the message said.\n\n\"During the small craft advisory, expect sustained winds up to 26 knots from the northwest with gusts up to 31 knots. The largest expected significant waves will be 9 feet with a potential maximum wave height of 13 feet.\"\n\nWith a heavy freezing spray warning also issued, the NWS explained that heavy freezing spray is expected to rapidly accumulate on vessels. Thus, mariners not trained to operate in these conditions or with vessels not properly equipped for these conditions, are recommended to remain in port or avoid the warning area.\n\n\"These conditions can be extremely hazardous to navigation,\" the message said.\n\nContact Aleanna Siacon at ASiacon@freepress.com.
