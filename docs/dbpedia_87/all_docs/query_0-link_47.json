        "text": "RALEIGH, N.C. (WTVD) -- First Alert-Flood Watch: A Flood Watch continues for counties along I-95 and east through Friday evening.\n\nGood morning! Debby is over VA, but moisture from the system lingers over NC. Scattered rain will be possible through the morning, with gradual improvements for most later today. A few storms will be possible east of I-95. There is an isolated risk of tornadoes for counties well east of the Triangle.\n\nSoils are saturated in most places, so it won't take much to exacerbate any lingering flooding impacts. Highs will be in the mid-80s.\n\nA few showers as storms will be possible this weekend and into early next week as the front slowly moves through the region, but they will likely be hit-or-miss in nature. Highs Saturday will be in the low 90s, with feels-like temps near 100. Sunday highs will be in the upper 80s, and it'll be less humid.\n\nIn general, dry and cooler weather is mainly on the way.\n\nRDU recorded 4.02 inches of rain yesterday. That broke the former record of 2.63 inches. The year in 10th place for wettest Augusts on record is 1931 with 9.54\". Currently, RDU is at 6.07\" as of yesterday, so it would not be surprising if that record is challenged.\n\nClick here for a look at river levels and the latest forecasts: https://rb.gy/k1p73k\n\nTropics: Near the Lesser and Greater Antilles:A tropical wave located over the tropical Atlantic several hundred\n\nmiles west-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands is producing widespread disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Any development of the wave should be slow to occur during the next couple of days while it moves westward across the central tropical Atlantic. Afterward, conditions are expected to become more conducive for development, and a tropical depression could form while it\n\napproaches the Lesser Antilles by early next week. The system is then forecast to move generally west-northwestward and could approach the Greater Antilles by the middle part of next week.\n\n* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.\n\n* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...50 percent.\n\nHave a great day!\n\nKweilyn"
