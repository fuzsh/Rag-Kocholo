        "text": "A winter storm was pushing east over large parts of the Southeast on Monday, bringing more snow and freezing temperatures to the region before reaching the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast on Tuesday, where forecasters said it could end a nearly two-year drought without snow.\n\nThe Southeast was bracing for extremely cold temperatures on Monday, with several states under winter storm warnings and winter weather advisories.\n\nThe governors of Mississippi and Alabama declared states of emergency as officials across the region opened warming centers and advised residents to prepare for freezing conditions.\n\nThe storm system pushing over the South and Southern Appalachians was expected to strike the East Coast on Monday, with initial snowfall expected by night before reaching the New York metropolitan area late Tuesday into Wednesday, according to Brian Hurley, a meteorologist at the Weather Service."
