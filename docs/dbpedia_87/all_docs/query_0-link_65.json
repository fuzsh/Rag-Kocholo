        "text": "A full-fledged snowstorm is going to rage across the central and western Upper Peninsula tonight through Thursday. Some of that snow will try to accumulate across northern Lower Michigan and the eastern U.P.\n\nA winter storm warning is in effect from this evening to 2 a.m. Thursday for the pink shaded counties in the Upper Peninsula. The winter storm warning area is expecting widespread 6 inch to 12 inch snow totals by Thursday morning. The higher elevations southwest of Marquette could have up to 32 inches of snow.\n\nA closer look at northern Lower Michigan’s winter weather advisory below shows only six counties in the advisory. Cheboygan, Emmet, Charlevoix, Antrim, Otsego and Leelanau Counties have the winter weather advisory from 8 p.m. today to 8 a.m. Wednesday. The timing of the advisory shows you that only the coldest part of the night will have the ability to have accumulating snow. Most of the Traverse City area will only cool as low as 35 degrees and not have much if any accumulation.\n\nThe winter weather advisory area should have 2 to 4 inches of snow, but mostly in the higher elevations. Lower areas near Lake Michigan and Lake Huron will stay warm enough for just less than one inch of snow.\n\nAll of the snowstorm will struggle to have accumulating snow during the daylight hours. The Upper Peninsula snow will be heavy enough to still accumulate some during the day Wednesday.\n\nTravel will be very difficult across the Upper Peninsula from tonight through Thursday morning. If you are traveling across far northern Lower Michigan you are OK today. If you have to drive across northern Lower Wednesday, wait until mid-morning to late afternoon and you should have temperatures above freezing. Thursday morning will have the coldest air but the snow will become sporadic. Thursday’s travel will again be safest if you wait for temperatures to warm above freezing by mid-morning.\n\nYes, this should be the last snowstorm for Northern Michigan."
