        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio (WOIO) - Arguably, the number one question we get as meteorologists is, “Are we going to have a bad Winter?” Understandably so.\n\nIn Northeast Ohio, and all across the Great Lakes, no matter what Mother Nature brings, our lives must go on.\n\nWill we have a Winter full of snowy commutes and snow days for the kids? Will you need to invest in a new pair of snow boots?\n\nIf you’re wondering what the answers to these questions are, the 19 First Alert Weather Team is ready to give you the First Alert to what you can expect this Winter.\n\nWhen the 19 First Alert Weather Team is compiling their Winter weather forecast, they can’t make snowfall predictions and temperature forecasts without delving into the bigger picture.\n\nSeasonal forecasting in Northeast Ohio, and really, anywhere, is heavily influenced by global weather patterns. These are, specifically, climate patterns in the Pacific Ocean known as El Niño and La Niña, according to Meteorologist Kelly Dobeck.\n\nWhen conditions are “normal” in the Pacific Ocean, trade winds blow from east to west along the equator, moving warm water from South America toward Asia. Cold water then rises from the depths of the ocean to replace the warm water. This is called upwelling. When conditions are “abnormal,” they’re either El Niño or La Niña. These two climate patterns impact weather all across the globe. So, what’s the difference between the two?\n\nWhen El Niño conditions are present, warmer waters cause the Pacific jet stream to move south of its neutral position.\n\n“The overall track of storms is shifted south during an El Niño Winter,” said Dobeck. “As a result, wetter weather stays more toward the southern states, and warmer air lingers in the northern states. This puts Northeast Ohio in a drier pattern for the Winter. This only impacts large-scale storm systems though. It doesn’t mean we won’t see any snow for the Winter. Weather on a smaller scale, like lake effect, can still bring heavy snow to our area.”\n\nIn a La Niña pattern, opposite circumstances occur. Cold waters in the Pacific force the jet stream north. This may even cause drought in the southern U.S. while the Pacific Northwest and Canada experience heavy precipitation and flooding. Locally, a La Niña pattern implies cooler and wetter weather.\n\nOver the Summer, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, announced that El Niño had emerged. El Niño’s influence on the U.S. is minimal during the Summer and much more prevalent from late-Fall through Spring. According to NOAA, El Niño conditions will gradually strengthen through the Winter.\n\nThis will mean a warmer-than-normal Winter across Northeast Ohio, according to Meteorologist Samantha Roberts. But what constitutes “normal” in Cleveland, especially during the Winter?\n\nA “normal” December features an average temperature of 34 degrees. The average temperature for the month of January in Cleveland is 29 degrees. A “typical” February has an average temperature of 31 degrees.\n\n“With El Niño expected to continue through this Winter, the 19 First Alert Weather Team is forecasting generally-above-normal temperatures for December, January, and February,” said Roberts. “December’s average temperature is forecast to be around 36 degrees. January’s average temperature will be around 34 degrees, and February’s average temperature will be around 35 degrees.”\n\nThat’s not to say there won’t be some cold Winter days around here. After all, it’s Cleveland! We live in Northeast Ohio.\n\nThere will be polar plunges and teeth-chattering mornings at the bus stop. However, on average, temperatures will skew slightly above normal this Winter.\n\nThe prospect of a warmer-than-normal Winter might imply less lake effect snow, right? We can’t talk about lake effect snow without talking about Lake Erie. Lake Erie has a significant impact on our weather. Our shallowest Great Lake can provide refreshing Summer breezes and brutally cold Winter winds. The lake can turn a sunny forecast cloudy in an instant. Lake Erie even spawns midges twice a year, once in the Summer and once in the Fall. Perhaps Lake Erie’s most notable output is lake effect snow.\n\nAccording to Meteorologist and Lake Effect Expert Jeff Tanchak, “Lake effect snow accounts for over half of the annual snow we see in the Snow Belts. Unlike Winter storms caused by systems, or areas of low pressure, lake effect snow consists of localized snow bands, or squalls, that track off of the Great Lakes. There is a big difference in yearly snowfall for areas in our western counties and in the Primary Snow Belt east of Cleveland.”\n\nThe Great Lakes are not the only area that experiences lake effect snow.\n\n“Around a dozen places on Earth can see lake effect snow,” stated Tanchak.\n\nSo, what causes lake effect snow? According to Tanchak, “Cold air moving over the open water of the lakes is what causes lake effect snow. The deeper the cold air relative to the warmer lake waters can determine how intense the snow will be. Lake effect is [notoriously] difficult to predict since the heavier snow bands can only be a mile or two wide. You could have a whiteout in one town while the next town over may be seeing sun.”\n\nIn addition to cold air, wind and moisture are key components of lake effect. Wind direction determines where the lake effect snow bands will set up, and where the heavier snow totals will occur. The other Great Lakes help to provide additional rich moisture for efficient lake effect snow. If the winds are right, Lake Michigan and Lake Huron can help deliver big snow totals in certain areas.\n\nWhat does our Lake Effect Expert, Meteorologist Jeff Tanchak, expect in terms of lake effect snow for this season?\n\n“Our forecast this year is calling for a warmer-than-normal Winter. This means we may see fewer Arctic air masses. The result may be fewer-than-normal lake effect events,” said Tanchak. “We shall see. All it takes is one to cause issues.”\n\nWhile the 19 First Alert Weather Team is anticipating a warmer-than-average and drier-than-average Winter, it’s not going to be completely dry. There will be times where a lake effect band has a big impact on commuters. According to Meteorologist Erika Paige, it’s important to prepare for instances like this.\n\n“As we transition seasons, we want to make sure we are ready from the car we drive to our homes, and making sure we are taking precautions against the cold weather for ourselves and our pets,” stated Paige. “For your vehicles, make sure your batteries are good and you have plenty of tread on your tires. Having water, food and extra blankets as part of an emergency kit are good as well. When there is snow and ice on the roads, giving yourself plenty of time to get to your destination to drive safely with the weather conditions expected is also important. Oh, and don’t forget to clean off your car from built up snow and ice on the roof, windows or lights so that you can not only be seen better by other drivers but also so you are not impacting the visibility or safety of others on the roadways.”\n\nWe don’t spend all of our time in the car though! How should you prepare for Winter on the home front?\n\n“At home, make sure you have your furnace serviced each year and if applicable, clean out the chimneys before use. We want to be sure we are practicing fire safety while staying warm during the winter months,” said Paige. “Make sure smoke and carbon monoxide detectors are in good working order. Insulate any exposed pipes and be sure areas around doors and windows are sealed correctly to limit the outside chill from entering your home. Be sure to clear any snow or ice to prevent slip and falls.”\n\nWhile we may not need our snow boots every day this Winter, it is important to plan for the days that are colder. “Dress to stay warm! We want to avoid exposing skin to bitter Winter temperatures which could lead to frostbite or hypothermia by adding in layers: hats, gloves, scarves, warm boots that will keep your feet dry, and insulated coats,” said Paige. “Finally, don’t forget about the pets! They need a shelter if they’re going to be outside to escape the elements and a warm inside place to stay at night. Be sure to clear any salt out of their paws and make sure they have fresh (not frozen) water to drink.”\n\nReader, you’ve probably figured out by now that the 19 First Alert Weather Team is not expecting a repeat of the Winter of 1978. However, there will be at least some snow on occasion.\n\n“As far as our upcoming snowfall forecast goes, we need to look at a lot of variables. We haven’t seen much snow in Cleveland over the past several winters. In fact, we’ve seen below-normal snowfall for 8 straight years. We have to go all the way back to the winter of 2014-15 to find a time where we had about average snowfall nearing 70 inches,” said Chief Meteorologist Jason Nicholas.\n\nThis is, after all, going to be an El Niño Winter, with lower-than-average snowfall totals and warmer-than-normal temperatures, overall.\n\n“In fact, looking back at past strong El Nino winters, like 1997-98 and 2015-16, we had well below normal snowfall and above normal temperatures,” stated Nicholas. “December 2015 was the warmest December on record for Cleveland.”\n\nNot all El Niño patterns are created equally. What is the official snowfall forecast for the expected-El Niño Winter of 2023-2024?\n\n“Our snowfall forecast this year is calling for below average snowfall, but more snow than what we saw last winter. Our forecast is for 35-45 inches of snow. Keep in mind our normal snowfall over the past 30 years is around 60 inches of snow, so well below normal,” Nicholas said. “We will need to watch our storm track evolution through the winter, as well as how much cold air is available to combine with surges of moisture. Also, another variable is, if we stay warmer, Lake Erie is unlikely to freeze, keeping lake effect in play for the Snow Belt. Our snowfall forecast is for Cleveland-Hopkins.”"
