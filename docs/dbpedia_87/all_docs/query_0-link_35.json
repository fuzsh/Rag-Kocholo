We've seen a few lake effect snow showers already this afternoon, but look for the precipitation associated with the storm system to arrive after 8 p.m. this evening. Locations north of Milwaukee will see a mix of snow, sleet, and freezing rain through the night with 2-5\" of snow possible. Mainly rain, with snow mixing in at times, is likely in Milwaukee and locations south, with around an inch of slush possible. Scattered rain and snow showers continue Thursday with little additional accumulation expected.\n\nRelatively cooler conditions arrive for the rest of the week and into the weekend, but far from a January deep freeze.\n\nCheck The Interactive Radar\n\n7-Day Forecast\n\nActive Weather Alerts\n\nTONIGHT:\n\nWindy with Mix Moving In. Mainly Snow/Frz. Rain North with 2-5\" Possible. Mainly Rain MKE and South with 0-2\" Possible\n\nLow: 33\n\nWind: E 15-25 mph\n\nTHURSDAY:\n\nWindy with Scattered Rain/Snow Showers.
