        "text": "A \"couple inches\" are in the forecast for Central New York, prompting the National Weather Service to issue a winter weather advisory.\n\nLake effect snow will blow in around 3 p.m. this afternoon. Contrary to the relatively weak system that slid through in the morning, locals can expect persistent snowfall overnight, said meteorologist Bryan Greenblatt.\n\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) advisory for Oneida County, including Utica and Rome as well as Madison, Otsego, and Cortland Counties, is expected to lift during the predawn hours Wednesday morning.\n\nThe Mohawk Valley will likely see three to five inches of snow, according to the weather service.\n\n“Plan for slushy road conditions during tomorrow’s commute,” urged Greenblatt.\n\nHeavier snow is expected to fall north of the region. Florence and Camden could see up to a foot of snow, he said.\n\nWhat's in store later this week?\n\nOnce the lake effect snow tampers off the rest of the week should be relatively light, according to the NWS.\n\nExpect blustery and cold weather this weekend with temperatures dropping into the single digits."
