        "text": "For most of us, yesterday’s high winds and storm threat have settled down into a two-day quiet stretch with cooler-than-normal temperatures being the only weather headline.\n\nBut for part of the Upper Peninsula that’s been slapped with a Winter Storm Warning, winter is still on the calendar. A foot of snow is in the forecast between today and Thursday for the Houghton area, part of Michigan’s Keweenaw Peninsula. High winds and white-out conditions on area roadways are also part of the warning, issued by the National Weather Service (NWS) in Marquette.\n\n“Lake effect snow showers will sharply increase in intensity this afternoon into tonight across northwest Upper Michigan,” meteorologists from that office said early Wednesday. “A foot or more of lake effect snow accumulation is expected over portions of the northwest through early Thursday with the heaviest snow from Twin Lakes to Painesdale. Blustery west winds gusting to 35 to 40 mph will also cause occasional whiteout conditions in blowing snow.”\n\nThe area of Houghton and Hancock - home to Michigan Technological University - is the spot where the Winter Weather Advisory is being upgraded to a Winter Storm Warning. Here are the details from the NWS:\n\nThe winter storm warning goes into effect at 2 p.m. Wednesday and lasts until 8 a.m. Thursday\n\nTravel could be difficult at times, especially the Wednesday night and Thursday morning commutes\n\n“Heavy lake effect snow expected, especially late this afternoon and this evening. By sunrise on Thursday, expect snow accumulations of 6 to 10 inches, except 10 to 13 inches in the high terrain between Twin Lakes and Houghton, including South Range, Painesdale and Toivola. West winds gusting to as high as 40 mph today and to 35 mph tonight.”\n\nThe forecast calls for some pretty intense lake-effect snowbelt action. Areas to the south of the Keweenaw could get anywhere from 1 to 3 inches, but nothing like what’s expected in this part of the peninsula bounded by Lake Superior."
