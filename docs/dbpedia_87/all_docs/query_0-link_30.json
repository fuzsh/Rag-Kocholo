        "text": "Winter Weather Advisories are in effect for counties all along the Lake Michigan shoreline. This advisory is mainly for periods of low visibility and slick roadways. It expires at 1pm Monday except for Ocean and Mason counties...this one expires at 7pm.\n\nLake effect snow showers have been hanging on this morning primarily off NW winds targeting that particular snowbelt near Grand Traverse Bay up towards Petoskey. Snow showers will begin to taper off as winds back more towards the west this afternoon. We are not done with winter weather though!\n\nA Winter Storm Watch is in effect for Leelanau, Benzie, Grand Traverse, Manistee, and Wexford Counties until 7pm Tuesday. Heavy lake effect snow is likely due to the passing of an Alberta Clipper late tonight into Tuesday that may bring some significant snow totals. Up to a foot of snow is possible through Tuesday with snow rate of 2\" per hour.\n\nThe clipper at this point looks to impact the Lake Michigan shoreline around midnight. The heaviest snow will be hugging the shoreline before the clipper intensifies and moves off the the east. As this clipper moves east strong lake effect snow bands are expected further inland...mainly around the Grand Traverse Bay region.\n\nThe heaviest snow looks likely right around daybreak for the morning/school commute. Roads will be treacherous in spots with heavy snow and visibility will be poor at times. Conditions will improve by the afternoon. Winds will not be strong however there still may be areas of blowing snow.\n\nOther locations across the state may see a general 1-4 inches of Snow through Tuesday evening.\n\nTemperatures today and all this week will be cold in the teens for highs and single digits for lows. Wind chill values will make it feel like below zero at times...especially in the morning.\n\nLake effect snow showers will continue for much of the workweek.\n\n~Meteorologist Colleen Mehlberg"
