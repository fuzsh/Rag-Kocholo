        "text": "Winds are our main contender through today, tonight, and Saturday, sustained around 25 mph and gusting near 50 mph. This will continue to impact travel with widespread blowing snow, and keep wind chills low enough for frostbite to develop in a matter of minutes. The final impact from the winds will be lake effect snow for parts of the South Shore.\n\nAcross the Northland, a Wind Chill Advisory is in effect until 8 am Sunday. Through that time, we need to continue to limit time outside, limit exposed skin, and keep pets indoors. Much of northeast Minnesota and northwest Wisconsin are in either a Winter Weather Advisory or Winter Storm Warning until 12 am Sunday. A Blizzard Warning is in effect for Lake and Cook Co. until 8 am Sunday, and until 6 pm Saturday for Bayfield, Ashland, Iron, and Gogebic Co.\n\nThe weather system responsible for the snow and winds is moving across the Great Lakes toward James Bay through today and tomorrow. Wrap around moisture will send additional snow to parts of the Arrowhead and northwest Wisconsin. These areas are where falling snow and strong winds are expected to bring blizzard conditions.\n\nAdditional snow will be less than an inch for the Twin Ports and much of northern Minnesota. Amounts increase going northeast toward the tip of the Arrowhead with 1-3” northeast of the Iron Range and 3” or more for northern Cook Co. In Northwest Wisconsin, amounts increase moving eastward. Most of Douglas, Washburn and Sawyer Co. stay under 3”. Bayfield Co. will see 3-6” with higher amounts locally. Amounts will quickly increase moving east across Ashland, Iron, and Gogebic Co. where as much as an additional 18-24” is possible.\n\nToday: Widespread blowing snow. Mostly cloudy with periods of snow possible. High 0. NW wind 20-30 mph G 50. Chance of snow: 30%\n\nTonight: Mostly cloudy and windy with blowing snow. Low -6. NW wind 25-30 mph G 50.\n\nTomorrow: Windy with blowing snow. Becoming mostly sunny. High 3. NW wind 20-30 mph G 45.\n\nTomorrow night: Windy with blowing snow. Mostly clear. Low -9. NW wind 15-25 mph.\n\nSunday: Mostly sunny and breezy. High 8. WNW wind 10-15 mph.\n\nMonday: Mostly sunny. High 10. WNW wind 5-10 mph.\n\nTuesday: Mostly cloudy with a slight chance for snow. High 19. S wind 5-10 mph. Chance of snow: 20%\n\nWednesday: Mostly cloudy with a slight chance for snow. High 30. S wind 5-10 mph. Chance of snow: 20%\n\nThursday: Cloudy with a chance for rain and snow. High 35. SW wind 5-10 mph. Chance of precip: 30%"
