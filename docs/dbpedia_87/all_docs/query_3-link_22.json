        "text": "Our first measurable snowfall of the month is expected Monday in the form of lake effect snow.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nAhead of the snow, the National Weather Service issued a WINTER STORM WARNING for Berrien and Cass Counties in Michigan and Elkhart and eastern St. Joseph Counties in Indiana, along with a WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY effective for northern LaPorte, western St. Joseph (IN), northern Kosciusko, Marshall, LaGrange, and St. Joseph (MI) Counties.\n\nThese alerts are expected to take effect 5 AM EST Monday.\n\nWinds are expected to shift direction Sunday night, eventually coming out of the northwest by Monday. This will bring moisture across Lake Michigan and give us a dose of lake effect snow.\n\nThe snow is expected to start around 5 or 6 a.m. Monday, lasting through the rest of the day.\n\nThe Monday morning commute will likely be the easiest, but drivers should still plan ahead for possible slick spots or reduced visibility as the snow falls.\n\nAs we head further into the day, winds are expected to increase and blow the snow around. This will make driving conditions worse as the day goes on.\n\nThe snow is expected to start tapering off as we head into early Tuesday morning.\n\nBy the end of the day Monday, most places will have seen anywhere from 1\" to 4\" of snowfall. Areas closer to Lake Michigan will be more likely to see 3\" to 4\", and could even see some locally higher amounts depending on lake effect band intensity. The area that's most likely to see 4\" is highlighted in dark blue in the map below:\n\nOutside of the snow, Monday is going to be rather chilly. Highs in the mid-30s will be reached in the morning, and temperatures will fall through the day.\n\nStrong gusty winds up to 45 miles per hour will make things feel even colder. By the afternoon, our feels-like temperature will be in the teens!\n\nOur accumulated snow will not stick around for too long, and neither will the cold temperatures. By the middle of the week, we will be back in the low 40s."
