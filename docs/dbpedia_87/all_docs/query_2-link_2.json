        "text": "Governor Kathy Hochul today directed state agencies to begin emergency response preparations as lake effect snow and strong winds have the potential to create dangerous blizzard-like conditions off the shores of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario this weekend. The Governor also released a video message to New Yorkers updating them on the latest forecasts and urging caution as the storm moves into New York.\n\nVIDEO of the event is available on YouTube here and in TV quality (h.264, mp4) format here.\n\n\"New Yorkers must be vigilant: another winter storm is on its way, and has the potential to have a serious impact,\" Governor Hochul said. \"We are deploying personnel, pre-setting equipment and issuing early warnings to ensure our response is speedy and effective.\"\n\nFollowing another major storm system which is expected to impact much of the state with snow, rain and strong winds beginning Friday, temperatures are expected to rapidly drop below freezing throughout Saturday, creating ideal conditions for lake effect snow to develop. While forecasters are still working to determine snow totals and the exact placement of the lake effect bands, wind gusts of 35 mph to 70 mph are likely during this time creating a real potential for power outages.\n\nThe combination of lake effect snow, strong winds, and freezing temperatures could produce potentially life-threating conditions in the areas along Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. New Yorkers should take this system seriously and begin making preparations now in the event the worst-case scenario occurs.\n\nBeginning Friday evening, another multi-hazard storm system will move into the state with snow, wintery mix, rain, strong winds, cold temperature, frigid windchills, and lake effect snow, along with the potential for coastal and lakeshore flooding. In areas along the Great Lakes, precipitation will begin as heavy snow with the potential to fall at a rate of two inches an hour or more. While most of the state will see wind gusts of 30-45 mph, gusts up to 70 mph are possible in Western New York and gusts of 50-65 mph are in areas east of Lake Ontario, which create a real potential for power outages. The National Weather Service has already issued High Wind Warnings for these areas.\n\nTemperatures will begin to drop from west to east throughout the state on Saturday morning creating the potential for frigid wind chills throughout the Western New York, Finger Lakes, Central New York, Southern Tier, Mohawk Valley and North Country Regions. Lake effect snow is then expected to develop Saturday afternoon and continue through the weekend. Significant snowfall is possible in the heaviest bands of lake effect snow, however the exact location of those bands has yet to be identified. Temperatures are expected to be in the teens to low twenties for the duration of the lake effect event, while wind chill temperatures will likely be in the single digits, with some higher elevation locations dropping below zero.\n\nElsewhere in the state, the system is expected to produce one to two inches of rain total throughout the Hudson Valley, New York City and Long Island, with wind gusts up to 50 mph Friday night into Saturday. There is a slight risk of flash flooding in these areas while moderate coastal flooding expected along the south shores of New York City and the south and easternmost shores of Long Island. Additional beach erosion is possible, especially along the Orient Point shoreline.\n\nThe National Weather Service has already issued a multitude of watches and warnings for this storm.

Use rock salt to melt ice on walkways, and sand to generate traction.\n\nWinterize your home and have heating sources inspected annually.\n\nIf you use heating oil, maintain an adequate supply.\n\nHave safe, emergency heating equipment available and use according to manufacturer’s instructions.\n\nInstall and check smoke alarms.\n\nProtect water pipes from freezing.\n\nTraveling in Winter Weather\n\nSome of the most important tips for safe driving include:\n\nDo not drive unless necessary.\n\nIf you must travel, make sure your car is stocked with survival gear like blankets, a shovel, flashlight and extra batteries, extra warm clothing, set of tire chains, battery booster cables, quick energy foods and brightly colored cloth to use as a distress flag.\n\nIf you have a cell phone or other communications device such as a two-way radio available for your use, keep the battery charged and keep it with you whenever traveling. If you should become stranded, you will be able to call for help, advising rescuers of your location.\n\nThe leading cause of death and injuries during winter storms is transportation accidents. Before getting behind the wheel, make sure that your vehicle is clear of ice and snow; good vision is key to good driving. Plan your stops and keep more distance between cars. Be extra alert and remember that snowdrifts can hide smaller children. Always match your speed to the road and weather conditions.\n\nIt is important for motorists on all roads to note that snowplows travel at speeds up to 35 mph, which in many cases is lower than the posted speed limit, to ensure that salt being dispersed stays in the driving lanes and does not scatter off the roadways. Oftentimes on interstate highways, snowplows will operate side by side, as this is the most efficient and safe way to clear several lanes at one time.\n\nMotorists and pedestrians should also keep in mind that snowplow drivers have limited lines of sight, and the size and weight of snowplows can make it very difficult to maneuver and stop quickly. Snow blowing from behind the plow can severely reduce visibility or cause whiteout conditions. Motorists should not attempt to pass snowplows or follow too closely. The safest place for motorists to drive is well behind the snowplows where the roadway is clear and salted. Never attempt to pass a snowplow while its operating.\n\nPower Outages\n\nPlanning\n\nIf you use medication that requires refrigeration, most can be kept in a closed refrigerator for several hours without a problem - check with your physician or pharmacist.\n\nIf you have space in your refrigerator or freezer, consider filling plastic containers with water, leaving an inch of space inside each one –this will help keep food cold if the power goes out.\n\nPlan to have an alternative cooking source, such as a camp stove or outdoor grill. Follow appropriate safety rules for its use outside the residence.\n\nConsider buying a generator and follow the rules for using it outside the residence. Before installing a generator, be sure to properly disconnect from your utility electrical service. If possible, have your generator installed by a qualified electrician.\n\nHave extra blankets, coats, hats, and gloves on hand to keep warm.\n\nIf you have a computer, back up files and operating systems regularly. Turn off all computers, monitors, and other devices when they are not being used.\n\nIf you have an electric garage door opener, locate the manual release level, and learn how to operate.\n\nIf you have a telephone instrument or system that requires electricity to work, plan for alternate communication such as a standard tele-phone handset, cellular telephone, or radio.\n\nWhat to Do If the Power Goes Out\n\nTurn off or disconnect major appliances and other equipment, e.g., computers, in case of a momentary power surge that can damage these devices. Keep one light turned on so you know when power returns. Consider using surge protectors wherever you use electronic equipment.\n\nCall your utility provider to notify them of the outage and listen to local broadcasts for official information. Check with your utility to determine area repair schedules.\n\nCheck to see if neighbors and those with access or functional needs have power.\n\nUse only flashlights for emergency lighting - candles pose the risk of fire.\n\nKeep refrigerators and freezer doors closed - most food requiring refrigeration can be kept safely in a closed refrigerator for several hours. An unopened refrigerator will keep food cold for approximately four (4) hours. A full freezer will keep the temperature for about 48 hours.\n\nDo not use a charcoal grill indoors and do not use a gas stove for heat - they could give off harmful levels of carbon monoxide.\n\nStay warm by dressing in layers and minimizing time spent outdoors. Be aware of cold stress symptoms (i.e., hypothermia) and seek proper medical attention if symptoms appear.\n\nClose off rooms you do not need.\n\nTo Report an Electric Outage, Call:\n\nCentral Hudson: 800-527-2714\n\nCon Edison: 800-752-6633\n\nNational Grid: 800-867-5222\n\nNYSEG: 800-572-1131\n\nO&R: 877-434-4100\n\nPSEG-LI: 800-490-0075\n\nRG&E: 800-743-1701\n\nHeating Safety\n\nUse only safe sources of alternative heat such as a fireplace, small well-vented wood or coal stove or portable space heaters.\n\nWhen using alternative heat sources such as a fireplace, woodstove, etc. always make sure you have proper ventilation. Always follow manufacturer's instructions.\n\nKeep curtains, towels, and potholders away from hot surfaces.\n\nHave a fire extinguisher and smoke detectors and make sure they work.\n\nIf you use kerosene heaters to supplement your regular heating fuel, or as an emergency source of heat, follow these safety tips:\n\nFollow the manufacturers' instructions.\n\nUse only the correct fuel for your unit.\n\nRefuel outdoors only and only when the unit is cool.\n\nKeep the heater at least three feet away from furniture and other flammable objects.\n\nWhen using the heater, use fire safeguards and ventilate properly.\n\nFor more winter safety tips, visit https://dhses.ny.gov/safety. For all non-emergency service needs in New York State before, during or after a storm, call 211 or visit 211nys.org.\n\nFlooding\n\nPlanning\n\nLearn the safest route from your home or business to high, safe ground should you have to leave in a hurry.\n\nKeep your vehicle fueled or charged. If electric power is cut off, gasoline stations may not be able to pump fuel for several days. Have a small disaster supply kit in the trunk of your car.\n\nFind out how many feet your property is above and below possible flood levels. When predicted flood levels are broadcast, you can determine if you may be flooded.\n\nKeep materials like sandbags, plywood, plastic sheeting and lumber handy for emergency waterproofing.\n\nTravel Safety\n\nFlooding and damaging winds can make traveling dangerous.\n\nNever attempt to drive on a flooded road – go another way. Remember: “Turn Around, Don’t Drown.”\n\nSix inches of swiftly moving water can cause you to lose control of your vehicle or knock you off your feet if walking.\n\nDo not underestimate the power of fast-moving water. Two feet of fast-moving flood water will float your car and water moving at two miles per hour can sweep cars off a road or bridge.\n\nIf water begins to rise rapidly around you in your car, abandon the vehicle immediately.\n\nIf water is rising inside the vehicle, seek refuge on the roof. Do not drive around road barriers."
