        "text": "A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY continues until noon for Manitowoc and Sheboygan Counties. Bands of light to moderate lake-effect snow will make the roads slippery. Many areas will see a fluffy 1-4″ of snow, with those flakes wrapping up this afternoon as the wind blows more off-shore. Inland areas will be much drier with partly cloudy skies.\n\nMeanwhile, a WIND CHILL ADVISORY continues until 10am for areas northwest of the Fox Valley. As we’ve seen over the past several days, when those “feel-like” temperatures dive below -20°, frostbite can develop on exposed skin in less than half an hour. Thankfully, the wind chill factor will improve this afternoon, and certainly in the days to come.\n\nWe’re about to come out of the arctic air! Starting tomorrow, high temperatures will be at, or above 20 degrees. In fact, we’ll see milder highs in the 30s for most of next week. As temperatures slowly climb between now and the weekend, a few flakes are possible at times. However, we do NOT see any big storms heading our way. Perhaps February will come to an end on a quieter note...\n\nYou can always keep our forecast handy with our free weather app. Look for the WBAY First Alert Weather App in the Apple app store and Google Play.\n\nWIND FORECAST:\n\nTODAY: N/NW 5-15 MPH\n\nWEDNESDAY: SW 1-10 MPH\n\nTODAY: Lakeside snow this morning...Another inch or two possible. Some inland sunshine with subzero morning wind chills. HIGH: 17\n\nTONIGHT: Partly cloudy. Frigid, but calmer. LOW: -1\n\nWEDNESDAY: Clouds thicken. Not as cold. Flakes at night. HIGH: 20 LOW: 10\n\nTHURSDAY: Mostly cloudy. A few morning flakes. HIGH: 23 LOW: 9\n\nFRIDAY. Mostly cloudy. Flurries possible. HIGH: 22 LOW: 3\n\nSATURDAY: Sunshine, then increasing clouds. HIGH: 23 LOW: 8\n\nSUNDAY: Cloudy, but milder. A few flakes. HIGH: 30 LOW: 17\n\nMONDAY: Mostly cloudy and mild. Snow showers at NIGHT. HIGH: 34"
