Grey Bruce has its first weather advisory of the season.

Environment Canada issued the warning of lake effect snow – possibly heavy at times – Wednesday morning, for Sarnia-Lambton, London-Middlesex, Huron-Perth and Grey Bruce.

Environment Canada said the stretch of Highway 21 from Port Elgin to Kettle Point, and Highway 402 between Watford and north of Strathroy, will be affected. Lake effect snow should remain primarily west of the City of London.

The lake effect snow will taper in intensity later this morning.
