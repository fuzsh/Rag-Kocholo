The National Weather Service’s lake-effect snow advisory for the counties of Lake and Geauga has been extended to noon today. It originally was set to expire at 7 a.m. Also, the Weather Service has extended until noon today the lake-effect snow warning for all of Ashtabula County. This warning was set to expire at 7 a.m. as well. Within the advisory area, multiple snow bands are expected to continue this morning with winds whipping off the still-open Lake Erie. The snow showers are expected to decrease by mid-day, ending the lake-effect snow bands. While only up to 1 inch of snow is forecasted for most locations within the advisory area, additional amounts of up to 3 inches are possible and where snow bands persist. However, gusty winds of 15 to 25 mph will continue to cause blowing and drifting of snow, reducing visibility to less than one-quarter mile at times, the Weather Service says. In the lake-effect snow warning area another 2 to 4 inches of new snow is possible before this too tapers off by mid-day. A travel advisory for southeast Ohio exists as well. While little snow fall is expected in this region what does arrive will possibly develop into ice on untreated roadways and – especially – bridges and overpasses, the Weather Service says. The preliminary outlook for the up-coming New Year’s holiday weekend indicates the likely possibility of more snow showers and continued cold conditions. Highs for the week will fluctuate widely from the low 20s to the upper 30s with lows ranging from the mid-teens to the upper 20s.
