WATERTOWN, New York (WWNY) - Lake effect snow has been pounding the Tug Hill Plateau and the Watertown area all morning.

And it’s starting to pile up.

A lake effect snow warning is in effect until 7 p.m. on Thursday for Jefferson and Lewis counties.

There’s another lake effect snow warning for southeastern St. Lawrence County until 1 a.m. on Thursday.

There’s a winter weather advisory until 1 a.m. Thursday for northwestern St. Lawrence County and parts of Franklin County.

The lake effect could cause whiteouts, blowing and drifting snow, and poor driving conditions.

Places on the Tug Hill could see 3 feet or more by the time the warning wraps up. Watertown could see up to two feet. Snowfall rates could get up to about 3 inches per hour.

The lake effect will spend much of Wednesday in the Watertown area and the Tug Hill before leaving Watertown to focus back on the Tug Hill tonight.

Places outside the lake effect could see just a few inches to no snow at all.

Highs for Wednesday and Thursday will be in the upper teens to around 20, but any wind will make it feel much colder.

There’s a small chance of snow both Friday and Saturday. It will be around 15 on Friday and around 10 on Saturday.

It will be partly sunny on Sunday. Highs will be around 20.

Monday will be mostly cloudy and there’s a 50% chance of mixed precipitation on Tuesday. Highs will be in the low to mid-30s both days.
