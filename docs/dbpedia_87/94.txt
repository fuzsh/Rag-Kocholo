Lake-Effect Snow Warnings are in place east of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, where snow will be heavy at times through Thursday evening.

Fortunately, the wind gusts will not be as intense. While that means the likelihood of total whiteouts are lower, visibility will still be poor inside any lake-effect bands.

The lake-effect snow band will be deep into the Southtowns Thursday morning. It may wobble from time-to-time, but it looks to stay primarily to the south of the metro through at least early Thursday morning. Another 4 to 8 inches of accumulation is likely today in the Southtowns.

Additional light snow showers will creep into other parts of Western New York during the first half of Thursday, but thatâll only result in minor accumulations of a couple of inches.

The band will lift farther to the north as the day goes on, affecting the metro once again through the evening commute before moving south and weakening by nightfall.

Lake-effect snow off of Lake Ontario aligns itself due east of the lake this morning.

Snowfall rates of 2 to 4 inches per hour will be possible within the heart of that band, so that snow will quickly stack up to 12 to 18 inches of snow or locally higher amounts today.

The highest snowfall amounts will collect in the Tug Hill Plateu this morning through midday as it focuses on southern Jefferson and northern Lewis Counties.

Travel will be nearly impossible because of whiteout conditions within that band of snow during the first half of today before snow lightens a bit by drivetime this afternoon.
