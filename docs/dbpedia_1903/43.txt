American soprano Angel Blue stands at the zenith of the opera world, gracing stages such as the Metropolitan Opera in New York, the San Francisco Opera, and other prestigious venues across the USA. She is a two-time Grammy Award winner, with one award coming from the Metropolitan Opera's recording of Gershwin's Porgy and Bess.

Now, for the first time, Angel Blue will grace Tivoli Gardens with her presence, performing a selection of renowned opera arias. This operatic gala is poised to be a high-calibre event, offering a festive evening that traverses opera literature. The program will feature arias from Italy's most celebrated composers, Verdi and Puccini, venture into Wagner's repertoire, and conclude with lighter pieces, including selections from The Great American Songbook. An evening deeply immersed in the profound and overwhelming emotions that define the world of opera.

Indeed, her full name is Angel Joy Blue, a native of California where she pursued her education. Now residing in New Jersey on America's East Coast, she embarks on global tours to perform concerts. While her primary focus is the USA, Angel Blue enjoys an international career, which, like many others, experienced a hiatus during the COVID pandemic. In response, she created Faithful Friday, an online talk show where she interviewed a range of inspiring individuals, including opera singers, musicians, and artists. A key aim of the show was to encourage young singers to persevere with their vocal training and sustain their passion for opera and the arts. The talk show remains accessible online. Angel Blue's background in journalism is evident, yet it's heartening to see her renewed dedication to her opera singing career.

In addition to the magnificent opera arias, the concert will also showcase orchestral music from the opera realm. Frequently, an opera's overture condenses the entire narrative into a few, yet intense, musical minutes. These exquisite masterpieces will be passionately presented to us by Tivoli Copenhagen Phil's new chief conductor, Christoph Gedschold, during this evening's performance.

The concert is staged in association with the Copenhagen Opera Festival and is a part of both Thursday Classical and the Stellar Moments Festival in Tivoli.
