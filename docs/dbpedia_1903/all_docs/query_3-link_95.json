        "text": "Blue First Appearance: Season 2 Episode 1 Age (at first appearance): 15 flashes old Origin: Sulfur City Personal Color: black and purple Powers: hypnosis:\n\npanther claw (her nails get really long and can cut through anything)\n\ndark bite (bites her opponent and injects poison that can control them)\n\nRival Devil: Kubral, then Cassidy Love Interest(s): Sulfus (former crush)\n\nBlue (Italian: Blu) is one of the main villians in Season 2. She works for the Blackmailers that kidnapped Raf's mother, Angelie, and only follows their orders because they promised to help free \"her people\". Blue ends of falling in love with the devil Sulfus but its a short lived romance after Sulfus uses her feelings for him against her in an attempt to escape the prison he was kept in. Blue seems to be skilled in magic just like Reina, after going up against Sulfus several times and winning. Blue also seems to have personal ties to Reina as seen in Season 2 episode 17 when she's sitting in a chair somewhere in Reina's house (compare the furnace designs) Season 1 episode 50.\n\nAppearance:\n\nBlue is a fallen angel that first appears in Season 2 episode 1. She is a pale teenage girl with lightish blue hair that falls down her back and ends at her waist and chest, with a small piece of hair that falls over her right eye. She has bloodred eyes, blue-grey eyeshadow the color of her hair, and a small portion of both her eyebrows shaved off in the middle. She has a dark purple spiral marking under her left eye that matches the markings on her clothes. She has dark purple wings that glow a weak purple light, that bend down instead of up like most angels. Her black and purple hooded dress sports small spirals all around and a frilly trail at its base.\n\nPersonality[]"
