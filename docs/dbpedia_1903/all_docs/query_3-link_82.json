        "text": "About Angel Blue\n\nAngel Blue has emerged in recent seasons as one of the most important sopranos before the public today. On September 23, 2019 she opened the Metropolitan Opera's 2019/2020 season as Bess in a new production of George Gershwin's Porgy and Bess. These performances followed her internationally praised French Opera debut and role debut as Floria Tosca at the Aix-en-Provence Festival in July of 2019. She has also been praised for performances in many other theaters, such as the Vienna State Opera, Semperoper Dresden, San Francisco Opera, Seattle Opera, Theater an der Wien, Oper Frankfurt, and San Diego Opera. In the current season, Ms. Blue will make her debut at the Staatsoper Berlin in the title role of Tosca. She will also appear in recital at Carnegie Hall, in concert in Malta and at the Carmel Bach Festival, and in galas in St. Petersburg and Santa Fe.\n\nShe also became the first African-American to receive the Beverly Sills Award from the Metropolitan Opera in 2020."
