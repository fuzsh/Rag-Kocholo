        "text": "UPDATED at 11:15 a.m. Jan. 17 with information on showings of a Porgy and Bess film featuring Angel Blue.\n\nBack in 2012, Angel Blue was so frustrated that she considered giving up the operatic career she’d imagined since she was a young girl.\n\nFive years later, the soprano made her Metropolitan Opera debut as Mimì in La bohème. When she comes to Dallas for a solo recital, on Jan. 26, she’ll be taking a quick break from her current star turn as Bess in the Met’s Porgy and Bess. (A filmed version of that show will be in local theaters Feb. 1.)\n\nWith a voice Opera News calls “big, rich and resonant, an enveloping sound of plush velvet,” Blue is appearing at Moody Performance Hall in the Dallas Opera’s annual Titus Art Song Recital. Accompanied by pianist James Baillieu, she’ll sing art songs, arias and romanzas by Mozart, Rachmaninoff, Strauss, Ruperto Chapi and Jake Heggie, plus a couple of favorite spirituals.\n\nBlue grew up in California as the daughter of a music-loving preacher who was also an accomplished singer. She was captivated by his collection of recordings of famous opera singers, and especially by soprano Leontyne Price. When she was only 4, her parents took her to a concert performance of Puccini’s Turandot. She started voice lessons at 6.\n\n“I sort of always knew that singing was going to happen, one way or the other,” Blue says by phone from New York. “I had my moments wondering if this is my job — will I make money at it? Or I thought I might sing in church and be a lawyer. But somehow from my early childhood, I felt I was destined to do what I do today.”\n\nAfter studies at the University of Redlands and University of California at Los Angeles, and a year and a half in a professional training program in Spain led by Placido Domingo, her career didn’t take off as she expected. Her family was having to help her with rent payments.\n\nA 2013 London audition, though, led to gigs with the English National Opera and Scottish Opera, and work as a classical music broadcaster on the BBC. She has gone on to sing leading roles at, among others, La Scala (as the company’s first black Violetta), Covent Garden, the Dresden Semperoper and, of course, the Met.\n\nHer favorite role? Violetta, in La traviata. “I understand that she is a prostitute, but she is a courtesan, incredibly well-educated, well-spoken. At such a young age, she has lived a life that most people will never see, but she remains humble and selfless.”\n\nHer dream role? Salome, in the Richard Strauss opera. “But this is years and years away.”\n\nDon’t be so sure.\n\nDetails\n\n2 p.m. Jan. 26 at Moody Performance Hall, 2520 Flora St., Dallas. $15 to $25. 214-443-1000, dallasopera.org\n\nA Live in HD film version of Porgy and Bess with Angel Blue is in theaters on Feb. 1. To find showings, visit metopera.org/season/in-cinemas/theater-finder/.\n\nIncarnatus in two performances\n\nIncarnatus, a professional chamber choir that debuted last season, will give two performances, in Dallas and Fort Worth, based around music for the Feast of the Purification of the Virgin Mary.\n\nIn the first half, movements of American composer Vincent Persichetti’s Mass will be interspersed with setting of texts for the feast by William Byrd.\n\nIn the second half, the Messe solennelle of French composer Louis Vierne will be interspersed with organ movements for the feast from Charles Tournemire’s L’orgue mystique.\n\nBased at Dallas’ Church of the Incarnation, Incarnatus is led by Scott Dettra, with organist Graham Schultz.\n\nDetails\n\n7:30 p.m. Jan. 24 at Church of the Incarnation, 3966 McKinney Ave. , Dallas. $10 to $25. 214-521-5101, incarnation.org."
