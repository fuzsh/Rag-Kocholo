Let’s get started.\n\nRelated: To read about other famous African American singers click here.\n\n1. Marian Anderson\n\nConsidered one of the finest classical singers of her generation, Marian Anderson was a trailblazer who broke down racial barriers in the world of opera.\n\nBorn in Philadelphia in 1897, Anderson began singing in her local church choir as a child. However, her career began to take off in the mid-1920s, when she won a singing contest with the New York Philharmonic, which resulted in her performing with them.\n\nThroughout her career, Anderson continuously broke barriers for African American performers. She went on to great success, even in the light of racial prejudice, performing for presidents, and in 1955, she made history as the first African American singer to perform with the Metropolitan Opera.\n\nWith her graceful demeanor and powerful voice, Anderson left a lasting legacy as one of the greatest and her legacy continues to inspire new generations of opera singers to this day.\n\n2. Leontyne Price\n\nSoprano Leontyne Price was born in Laurel, Mississippi, in 1927. She attended Central State University and then Juilliard.\n\nIn 1961, Price made her first performance at the Metropolitan Opera, becoming the first African American to take on leading roles. Her fame began to grow when she sang the title role of Puccini’s Tosca in a televised opera.\n\nHer rise to stardom took her to La Scala, the Royal Opera House, and San Francisco Opera House, among many legendary venues.\n\nPrice was the first African American opera soprano to achieve international success.
