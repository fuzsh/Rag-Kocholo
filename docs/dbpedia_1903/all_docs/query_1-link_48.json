I've heard many (many, many, many, many... you get the picture) singers grapple with this, one of the most beautiful of contemporary standards, but Blue's rendition was among the most memorable. She sang with the clear, simple and sure tone that the piece...which is nothing more exotic than a lullaby...demands. It is meant to set the tone for the opera, with its reassuring words set in a mournful minor key that lets the listener know that the livin' on Catfish Row is likely to be anything but easy, and Blue's voice practically told the whole story of the opera in that one aria.\" - Confutata Magazine\n\n\"The young soprano was Angel Blue,she exhibited a very big talent. She began in a disarmingly breathy, jazzy tone, which she soon proved she could turn on and off at the drop of a hat...She has killer high notes and killer theatrical instincts.\" - Los Angeles Times\n\n\"Angel Blue outdid herself when singing Dvor'k's 'Song to the Moon from 'Rusalka' in a concert presented by the West Los Angeles Symphony.
