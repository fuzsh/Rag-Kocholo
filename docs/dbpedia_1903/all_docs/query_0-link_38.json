        "text": "Angel Blue has emerged in recent seasons as one of the most influential sopranos before the public today. The two-time Grammy Award winner, 2020 Beverly Sills Award recipient and 2022 Richard Tucker Award winner is celebrated worldwide for her honeyed soprano and affecting deliveries of many of the most beloved roles in the operatic repertory, such as Violetta in Verdi's La Traviata, Bess in Gershwin’s Porgy and Bess, Mimí in Puccini’s La Bohéme, and Destiny/Loneliness/Greta in Terrence Blanchard’s Fire Shut Up in My Bones.\n\nThe 2023 spring and summer seasons begin with Angel as Violetta in La Traviata at the Metropolitan Opera with Maestro Nicola Luisotti, and her debut in the titular role in Aida at the Royal Opera House with Sir Mark Elder. She can be seen in concert with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra and Maestro Oskana Lyniv, and in recital with distinguished Canadian pianist Dr. Bryan Wagorn at Arizona Opera. Ms. Blue's first summer appearance begins in Europe on tour with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, under the direction of world-renowned conductor Yannick Nézét-Seguin.\n\nThe 2023/24 season introduces audiences to Angel Blue as Leonora in Il Trovatore at the San Francisco Opera, followed by a highly anticipated return to the Vienna State Opera as Tosca. She continues her season with performances as Micaëla in Carmen and a role debut as Magda in La Rondine at the Metropolitan Opera.\n\nOn September 23, 2019 she opened the Metropolitan Opera’s 2019/20 season as Bess in a new production of Porgy and Bess. These performances followed her internationally praised French opera debut and role debut as Tosca at the Aix-en-Provence Festival in July of 2019. She has also been recognized for performances in countless other theaters, such as the Vienna State Opera, Semperoper Dresden, Seattle Opera, Theater an der Wien, Teatro alla Scala, Baden-Baden Festspielhaus, Paris Opera, English National Opera and San Diego Opera.\n\nPuccini’s La Bohéme has played an especially prominent role in the development of Angel Blue’s career. She made her United States operatic debut as Musetta at LA Opera in 2007 while a member of the company’s Young Artist Program and subsequently made her debut at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan in the same role in 2015. As Mimí, she has earned exceptional international acclaim. Angel first sang the role at the English National Opera in London in 2014 and has since performed Mimí for her house debuts at the Palau de Les Arts in Valencia, the Vienna State Opera, and the Canadian Opera Company, the Semperoper Dresden, Hamburg State Opera and of course, the Metropolitan Opera.\n\nEqually active on the concert platform, Angel has appeared in recital and in concert in over 40 countries including Hungary, Kazakhstan, India, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, South Korea, China, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Russia, Brazil and Mexico. In 2011, Angel opened the Royal Opera House, in Muscat, Oman. Orchestral engagements have included concert versions of Porgy and Bess at the Berliner Philharmoniker under Sir Simon Rattle and with the Philadelphia Orchestra under Marin Alsop, Mahler’s Symphony No. 2 with the Münchener Philharmoniker under the baton of Zubin Mehta, and Verdi’s Requiem in Sydney, Australia with Oleg Caetani. She has also sung Strauss’s Four Last Songs and Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, Peri in Schumann’s Das Paradis und die Peri with the Accademia Santa Cecilla in Rome, and Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 with the Cincinnati Symphony under Louis Langree.\n\nDuring the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020, Angel dedicated her time to encourage younger singers to stay motivated to finish their studies and continue in opera, through an online talk show called, Faithful Friday where she interviewed people who she found to be inspiring. The online talk show received much acclaim from its viewers, many called the show, \"Uplifting, and exactly what is needed right now.\" Angel has since shifted her focus back to her family life and her singing engagements. However, she still maintains that encouraging and uplifting younger singers in the opera world is at the forefront of her platform.\n\nAngel Blue was raised in California and completed her musical studies at UCLA. She lives in New Jersey with her husband and son.\n\nLearn more at AngelJoyBlue.com.\n\nCanadian pianist and vocal coach Bryan Wagorn serves as an assistant conductor at he Metropolitan Opera and regularly performs throughout North America, Europe, and Asia as soloist, chamber musician, and recital accompanist to the world's leading singers and instrumentalists.\n\nHe has appeared on major television and radio stations including Good Morning America, WQXR and CBC Radio, has performed in recital for the George London Foundation, the Marilyn Horne Foundation and Richard Tucker Foundation, and with artists such as Anthony Roth Costanzo, Nadine Sierra, Karita Mattila, Joyce DiDonato, Pinchas Zukerman, Carol Wincenc, and the New York Woodwind Quintet.
