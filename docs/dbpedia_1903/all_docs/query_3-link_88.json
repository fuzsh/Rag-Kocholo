        "text": "The voice of American soprano Angel Blue is praised for its expressiveness both in the heights of her range and the depths of her lower register. Most recently, she starred in the Metropolitan Operaâ€™s long-awaited new production of Porgy and Bess, for which she shared a Grammy for Best Opera Recording this year. Blue makes her Cal Performances solo recital debut with a program of songs and arias by Puccini, Strauss, and Kurt Weill, music by American composers George Gershwin and Lee Hoiby, and arrangements of Black American spirituals."
