He wants to makes his girlfriend feel good but instead feels like a detriment to the relationship. However, the girlfriend continues to stand by his side, and both still find each other fun and compatible, despite being polar opposites. Even though the author struggles to balance his personal life and relationship, he'll do his best to take care of her.\n\nLyrics[]\n\n[Verse 1]\n\nGotta build it up just to burn it down\n\nYou're the princess, I'm a fucking clown\n\nStop the presses, 'cause I'm killing time\n\nWon't you be my bloody valentine?\n\n[Chorus 1]\n\nYou're just a fucking kid, and no one ever gives you a break\n\nYou want a señorita, and now your heart is gonna break\n\nYou're Angel Blue, with teenage traces\n\nAngel Blue, with pretty faces\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nStab my heart like a stick in the mud\n\nCut my chest just to see the blood\n\nNow I'm singing out the alphabet\n\nAs my tears are putting out my cigarette\n\n[Chorus 2]\n\nWe'll hit the cemetery so we can see the holiday lights\n\nWaking up the dead and everything'll be alright\n\nYou're Angel Blue with teenage traces\n\nAngel Blue with pretty faces\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Bridge]\n\nAlright, stuck in the middle of heaven and hell\n\nAlright, trying to find my better angels\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nStab my heart like a stick in the mud\n\nCut my chest just to see the blood\n\nStop the presses cause I'm killing time\n\nWon't you be my bloody valentine?"
