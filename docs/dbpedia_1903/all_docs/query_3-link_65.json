In Summer 2022, she will sing the role of Marguerite in Faust at Opéra national de Paris. Highlights of Ms. Blue’s recital and concert engagements include Knoxville: Summer of 1915 with the Philadelphia Orchestra and Yannick Nézet-Séguin, including one night at Carnegie Hall, and performances of Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra conducted by Fabio Luisi. This season also includes recitals at Washington University in St. Louis, Cal Performances in Berkeley, Poznan in Poland, and appearances with the Philadelphia Orchestra in Saratoga, Edinburgh, and Hamburg.\n\nMs. Blue was born and raised in California and completed her musical studies at UCLA.
