Upon returning to the U.S. I found community, and together we are blazing a trail to healing.\n\nI’m Forrest, and I wrote Angel Blue to create an open conversation about CSA (child sex abuse). I am one voice of many in this strong community of survivors that connect, share and heal together.\n\nTo all of you that have been part of this ABASOR (Angel Blue A Song Of Redemption) journey, I appreciate you.\n\nFor additional support and resources please visit rainn.org\n\nThe journey\n\nWhen I started my journey to healing, I had a hard time finding other men that shared openly about their experiences. Feeling alone and hopeless, I knew that others probably did too. It hasn’t been easy, but I am tired of the silence and shame. I share my story to let you know you are not alone. Read more about how and why I wrote the book Angel Blue, a Song of Redemption and join the movement now."
