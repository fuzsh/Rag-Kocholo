Former Dr Who Paul McGann is dating actress Susannah Harker having left his wife of 15 years.

McGann, who starred in Withnail And I before taking the lead role in the 1996 Who revival, has left wife Annie and moved from Bristol to London.

He is now seing Pride And Prejudice star Harker, who he met in 2003 when appearing alongside her in a play. They have been spotted together at events in London, and most recently at a hotel in Rome.

"We get lots of famous people here, especially British," a member of staff told the Mail on Sunday. "They sat in the bar for lunch and looked like any other couple."

McGann's spokesman confirmed the news. "Paul and Susannah are an item," he said. "He has been separated from his wife for quite some time and now lives in London. Paul and Susannah got together after he split from his wife."
