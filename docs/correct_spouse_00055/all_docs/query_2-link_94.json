        "text": "\"Oh I haven't really retired. Not properly anyway,\" he confided at the opening of the Gate Theatre's The Vortex by Noel Coward. \"I stepped away from U2 but I still have lots to do and lots going on.\"\n\nWhile he was remaining tight-lipped about his future plans, Paulie (pictured right with wife Kathy Gilfallan) was more then happy to chat about U2's chances of picking up a shiny statuette at this year's Oscars. \"They got the Golden Globe – which is a pretty good sign. And they're performing on the night, so go figure.\"\n\nFrom the west coast of America to the Far East, gregarious director of the Gate Michael Colgan was in flying form, discussing his plans to take the theatre's previous production of Pride and Prejudice to Hong Kong.\n\n\"We're off to China next year. Apparently, we're kind of a big deal over there,\" he said, while careering around the foyer. All the original cast, including former Fair City star Aoibhin Garrihy, have been invited to take part in the 2015 Hong Kong Arts Festival.\n\n\"Then we go over to Australia. So we'll be packing up the bonnets and bustles on the regular,\" he said.\n\nThe theatre was buzzing when the cast of The Vortex took their final bow. \"Magnificent,\" Uncle Gaybo said. \"I was transfixed.\"\n\nCabaret singer Camille O'Sullivan and flame-haired actress Kelly Campbell chatted among themselves while playwright Tom Murphy kept the troupes entertained with his razor-sharp wit.\n\nFormer Dr Who star Paul McGann had flown in from Whovian LA to support his other half Susannah Harker – who played the lead female role in the original series of House of Cards.\n\n\"I feel like I've stepped out of a tardis,\" McGann said. \"There were thousands there. You forget how many people care about that deer stalker hat.\"\n\nSpeaking of fashion finery, designer Peter O'Brien was on hand to discuss his upcoming film The Price of Desire. It's all about Irish architect Eileen Grey and stars indie singer Alanis Morrissette.\n\n\"You always worry about dressing people you don't know,\" Peter said.\n\n\"But then you just say 10 Hail Marys and get on with it.\n\n\"Thankfully Alanis was a dream. I had her sitting in the mid-day sun swathed in black velvet and she didn't say a word. She was a saint.\" Now isn't that ironic.\n\n– KBK\n\nA regal air at premiere\n\nShowbiz, glamour, diplomats and strong women. . . we had it all at the Eliza Lynch: Queen of Paraguay premiere.\n\nMaria Doyle Kennedy, pictured below, who plays the lead, was the epitome of elegance as she stepped out in vintage on the red carpet on Thursday for the premiere of her latest movie. It chronicles the life of the imperious Cork native who became the most famous woman in South America in the mid-19th Century.\n\nSharing the back story to his family was Miguel Ángel Solano López, below, Eliza's great grandson and the Ambassador Designate of Paraguay to Ireland. Talk about closing the circle.\n\nBefore curtain-up at the Savoy cinema, we enjoyed a drinks reception in the Hugh Lane Gallery where amongst those invited were Harry and Rita Crosbie, Fiach Mac Conghail, from the Abbey Theatre, and Conor McEnroy, from Abbeyfield Finanical Holdings, who is Irish but lives in Paraguay.\n\nThe diplomatic corps were out in force. Among them was the charming Mexican ambassador, Carlos Garcia de Alba, and the Brazilian ambassador, Pedro Fernando Bretas Bastos.\n\nThe film's director Alan Gilsenan was spotted chatting with Michael Lillis and the historian Professor Ronan Fanning whose book, The Lives of Eliza Lynch, was the starting point for this fascinating docu film.\n\nAnd while Michael D Higgins attended the premiere in Dublin, the Paraguayan premiere was attended by their first citizen in 2013, President Federico Franco. At the gallery, fashionistas honed in on three of Eliza Lynch's original dresses.\n\nShe became the heroine of her adopted country and epitomised the struggle of the Paraguayan people in the War of the Triple Alliance of 1864 to 1870 against the combined forces of giant Brazil, huge Argentina and smaller Uruguay.\n\n– BP\n\n'Jaws' star a reel hit at festival\n\nThere have been a rake load of Hollywood actors knocking around Dublin town this week.\n\nStanley Tucci, John Hurt, Terry Gilliam and everyone's favourite '90s heart-throb Jason Priestley all attended events as part of the Jameson Dublin International Film Festival.\n\nPriestley, pictured, reminisced over his Beverley Hills 90210 fame: \"I wished I'd enjoyed it more, it went so fast. Women don't chase me down the street any more.\"\n\nJohn Hurt waxed lyrical about the liberating effect Dublin city has on him: \"I feel like I can say whatever I want, to whomever I want.\" And Tucci told us all about about his undying love for bruschetta and Meryl Streep.\n\nBut the highlight of the week was undoubtedly the screening of Jaws. Richard Dreyfuss, who played geeky marine biologist Hooper in the 1975 flick, was on hand to answer questions about 'Bruce', the mechanical shark used on set.\n\nThe screening attracted a fun bunch: rugby lock Mike McCarthy was looking good, having recovered from getting booted in the face by Ian Evans. Voice of Ireland host Eoghan McDermott, filmmaker Jim Sheridan, songstress Gail Kaneswaren and models Sam Homan and Emily McKeogh all piled into the Mansion House, too.\n\nRonaldo impersonator and panto king Karl Bowe mentioned his upcoming role in new RTÉ drama The Centre. \"I play Jennifer Maguire's Turkish husband Mustafa,\" he said. \"Comedian Katherine Lynch wrote it so it's going to be great.\" If you say so.\n\n– KBK\n\nBirthday girl Ingrid celebrates in style\n\nAmy Huberman was stateside this week, 'networking' about future film projects.\n\nAs a result, she couldn't make it to Arnotts' bright and bubbly spring/summer launch where her shoe range is being stocked – but that didn't stop the fashion pack from having a raucous night out.\n\n\"It's my birthday!\" stylist to the stars Ingrid Hoey cheered as she sipped a wild hibiscus champagne cocktail. \"I had cake for breakfast and am going to have another slice after dinner.\"\n\nIngrid, who dresses the likes of Kathryn Thomas, Sharon Corr and Gráinne Seoige, was in cahoots with fashion editor Sive O'Brien and Brendan Courtney discussing the thrills and spills of London Fashion Week.\n\nCourtney said the highlight was discovering he and rap star Tinie Tempah wear the same specs but he was less than happy when the cast of Made in Chelsea gatecrashed his fashion show.\n\n\"I told the producer to make sure none of the clothes were in shot.\" Meow!\n\nRoz Purcell looked like an Amazonian on the catwalk. And with good reason; she's in the middle of training with her boyfriend Niall Breslin for the Ironman Triathlon. You know what they say; the couple who train together stay together.\n\nPlus-size model Louise O'Reilly was also back in town, having returned from London. \"It just wasn't working, I guess I'm not a Chelsea girl,\" she mused.\n\nTV starlets Laura Woods, Diana Bunici, and Blathnaid Treacy all starred googly eyed at the swishing and sweeping clothes while tucking into handmade chocolate truffles.\n\n\"They're gorgeous,\" Diana said fawningly. \"What with all the rain, I've missed sun dresses.\"\n\n– KBK\n\nSuper Mario visits old Nigella haunt\n\nHigh heels or not, I chose to walk from the London Fashion Week shows to my Monday dinner date at Scott's restaurant on London's Mount Street.\n\nThis restaurant is almost in danger of becoming more famous for the goings-on on its outside terrace than its fine cuisine, but let's just say, there was no sign of Nigella Lawson, her ex Charles Saatchi or his new beau Trinny when I arrived there to dine with Shelly Corkery, the Brown Thomas fashion director who had come straight from the Tom Ford AW14 show.\n\nWhy anyone would prefer the outside terrace to the chic interiors is beyond me. It's rude to stare so it's probably best that I was sitting with my back to the neighbouring booth where the super-handsome and top Peruvian fashion photographer Mario Testino (who shot to fame when Princess Diana chose him to snap her for Vanity Fair in 1997) was dining with man-about-town Hamish Bowles.\n\nHowever, I got to chat with Hamish, the international editor-at-large of American Vogue the following morning when we were both at Simone Rocha's thoroughly exciting show at the Tate Modern.\n\nHamish remembered Simone as a child, running around her dad's studio in Dublin.\n\nThe dapper fashion scribe dropped by as we were filming for independent.ie, so catch his critique and bon mots about Simone on the Irish Independent website.\n\n– BP\n\nIrish artists sparkle on London scene\n\n\"Where are the red dots?\" It's the cry that every gallery owner likes to hear and Barbara Stanley had the biggest smile on her face as she watched the London Irish brigade hoover up canvases at her chic Connaught Street art space last Monday.\n\nLondon Fashion Week was on down the road but, behind the steamed-up windows of Barbara's Bayswater gallery, there was a fashion-themed party of a different kind going on.\n\nAmbassador of Ireland, Daniel Mulhall and his wife Greta attended RIAN – a journey through Irish jewellery and accessories which displayed the work of contemporary designers like Una Burke and Joanne Hynes.\n\nThe venture was a partnership between the Embassy of Ireland and the Barbara Stanley Gallery, where the walls were hung with covetable art by Irish artists Margaret Egan, Anthony Murphy, Comhghall Casey and Jimmy Lawlor.\n\nGordon Farrell, from Longford, attracted lots of attention for his canvases on which christening, communion and confirmation outfits from the past are immortalised.\n\nAmong the other guests I spotted were members of the International Irish Business Network, including Kerry native and businesswoman Liz Shanahan, Cecelia Gallagher, chair of the Women's Irish Network, Gerry Nicholas from the Irish Chartered Accountants and Rachel Riley of Christie's.\n\n– BP"
