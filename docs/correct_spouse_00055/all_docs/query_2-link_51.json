        "text": "“IT feels a lot harder now than when I started,” said writer John Fay.\n\n“There’s definitely more writers and actors out of work. There’s less getting done.\n\n“And I do think that comes down to money. If people aren’t investing in it, then it’s not getting made, is it?’”\n\nFortunately for those who love TV drama (and who doesn’t?), there are people like Colin McKeown around with the talent, know-how and sheer force of will to produce series like Moving On.\n\nMy feature on the second series of Moving On is in today’s (Tue Oct 26) MEN.\n\nYou can read it below, plus a few extras from those involved in the 45-minute BBC1 Daytime films.\n\nFollowed by a quick rundown of the 10 new episodes and some of the leading cast members in each one.\n\n*********************************************\n\nHARRY Potter actor Jason Isaacs wants to be in the next series. “I’ll write, direct and make the sandwiches. All for one price,” he promises.\n\nLinda Green and Doctor Who star Daniel Ryan points out that it’s not always about the money: “You’d get an actor crawling over broken glass to do a good script.”\n\nThey are both talking about Moving On (BBC1, Monday, 2:15pm), which returns for a second series of 10 stand alone films screened over consecutive weekdays during the next fortnight.\n\nCreated by award-winning writer Jimmy McGovern, the acclaimed series is essentially Play For Today transported into the afternoons, with a primetime repeat slot promised for a later date. If you can’t watch them live, set your TV recorder of choice now.\n\nThis year there are double the number of stories and a cast list including John Simm, Gerard Kearns, Jenny Agutter, Jack Deam, Naomi Radcliffe, Richard Fleeshman, Claire Skinner, Hugo Speer, Lorraine Ashbourne, Robert Glenister, Lisa Faulkner and Kieran O’Brien.\n\nThe Wire’s Dominic West makes his UK directing debut in Malaise, shown a week on Thursday, featuring Life On Mars star Simm as Moose, an armed robber released from jail after an eight-year sentence. Trainspotting’s Ewen Bremner plays the man now living with his ex, the mother of Moose’s daughter.\n\nProducer Colin McKeown was 19 when he joined Granada in Manchester and spent the next 10 years learning every aspect of television broadcasting. Now an industry veteran, he founded Liverpool-based LA Productions in 2000 and is not a man who takes no for an answer.\n\nHe recalls how he found himself next to Dominic in the toilets at BAFTA. “I’d watched five seasons of The Wire. I looked to my right and there he was. He was a captive audience, he couldn’t move, as you can imagine. So I hassled and hustled him and by the time we got out of that loo, I’d convinced him he should come to Liverpool and direct and episode of Moving On.”\n\nThe first film – Sauce For The Goose – features Susannah Harker as divorcee Anne, forced to put her life on hold for mother Bella (Anna Massey), who has Alzheimer’s. Then in walks computer repairman John, played by Daniel Ryan.\n\n“My wife died of dementia and I lived through every second of that film,” says Colin. “I knew how real it was. But also glad that the writer John Fay punctuated it with a bit of lightness.”\n\nPride and Prejudice actress Susannah points out: “My grandmother had Parkinson’s. So I witnessed her deterioration. It’s about the heart and the humanity in the scripts. That’s why actors are able to connect so easily with it. It’s a good script. That’s rare. You’ll get people to do it. There’s no money!”\n\nBudgets are tight. But Colin aims to ensure that the cash goes towards making the best production he can. “We would be honest to people and say, ‘We ain’t got the bread.’ If you want to do this, you do it for the right reasons.’\n\n“Every single actor is paid exactly the same, Anna Massey onwards. The first episode we ever did was with Sheila Hancock and she got paid exactly the same as everybody else. Nobody is doing this for the money. But there are benefits. We can take risks and give people chances.”\n\nThe second week of films includes The Test, starring Hannah Gordon and Corin Redgrave in his last role before he died in April at the age of 70. He plays “silver fox trumpet player” Gabe in a love story now dedicated to his memory.\n\nCorin, brother of Vanessa and father of Jemma, was already very ill when he filmed the production just over three months before his death. “It was so emotional. We all knew he wasn’t going to last long,” says Colin.\n\n“All the cast and crew said, ‘Let’s go for it and get him through this.’ Sometimes it was line by line. But he was such a trouper. He knew. He went, ‘I’m being a bore to you, aren’t I?’ And I went, ‘No, you’re not. You’re OK.’ Then he’d do the scene. It was a patchwork quilt, a lot of it.”\n\nLeading actors in expensive TV dramas have to be insured in case something happens which stops them from completing the job, leaving the production company with a choice of either scrapping their film or re-shooting all over again with a replacement.\n\nBut in Corin’s case, no company would take the risk on what Colin describes as “a dying man”. He reveals: “They didn’t insure him. I took the hit. I just said, ‘Well, if we don’t make it, we don’t make it and that’s the end of it. I’d write off the money if I had to.’ Nobody is going to insure somebody as ill as that. Sometimes you just have to say, ‘Well OK.’\n\n“It was six days’ filming overall. He said, ‘Colin, I want you to get a trumpeter. I want to be able to do the fingerwork, chords and all that.’ And he did. He was stunning. I can’t watch that without tears. I couldn’t tell you how proud we were of him.\n\n“I can’t wait for people to see his performance because it’s absolutely brilliant. He put his heart and soul into it.”\n\n***********************************************\n\nExtras:\n\nLiam Keelan, Controller of BBC Daytime:\n\nMoving On was one of his first commissions when he took the job over two years ago: “It’s one of the ones I feel most proud of because it felt like a real departure for Daytime. Something that handles tough subjects with real intelligence and verve.”\n\n“One of the best things to happen to BBC Daytime was losing Neighbours, even though it was the highest rating show, because it freed up so much airtime and so much money to do projects like this.”\n\nThe reduction in long-running TV drama, from Brookside to The Bill: “It’s hard out there. There are a lot of really talented people who want to work. From my point of view it feels like a no-brainer to do more of these (Daytime drama commissions) because we’re the only broadcaster producing originated drama in daytime. It’s a key point of differentiation. I’d like to do a lot more of that stuff. Obviously the financial restraints are there but I’ll certainly be looking to do more.”\n\nWriting for a pre-watershed daytime audience? “By and large, there aren’t any edicts that say, ‘You must write in a certain way for daytime. I wouldn’t want to go down that road at all. If you look at the slot that it plays in, in the mid-afternoon, there’s a greater proportion of an adult, older, audience than there is, say, watching EastEnders at eight ‘o clock where you’ve got more kids around.”\n\nColin McKeown, producer:\n\n“Like a lot of things in life, there are moments when the bull**** stops, the talking stops and, metaphorically, you stand centre stage, the curtain rises and you face the consequences of your actions. In our case, the consequences are the second series of Moving On. And our promise to Liam from all of the team was that we would move the bar up. There’s absolutely no point in staying the same or just trying to achieve the same. We set our aspirations a lot higher than series one. And I believe fundamentally that we’ve achieved it.”\n\n“It’s not just opportunities for the writers. If you were to take the first series, the first three episodes was a first time director. The second series we’ve got a number of firsts. We took risks right across the board.”\n\n“We had a phenomenal cast, drawn to it by the quality of the script – if good work is offered, they would do it. Not enough people ask. I will always ask. I will knock on people’s doors if need by and say, ‘Well, what’s the problem with you? Why don’t you want to do it? It’s a really good script.’ They want to do it for the right reasons.”\n\n“Jimmy’s (McGovern) technique that he’d used on The Street and Accused (coming to BBC1 next month) and so forth was one of story, story, story. It wasn’t to choose the writer in the first place. The brief in general was, ‘Write about a character or characters that have reached a crosspoint in their life and move on.’ You write about what you want to write. From our perspective, it was what moved us, touched us.”\n\n“Jimmy’s got a great nose and if we were making wine, he would sniff the grape and say, ‘That’s the one.’ We’d do all the hard work after that!”\n\nJimmy McGovern, creator of the series:\n\n“We use a lot of up and coming writers as well as established ones. It means work in Liverpool. After Brookside went, there were an awful lot of writers with no opportunities at all. So this provides that opportunity. I did very little.”\n\n“The standard of acting throughout the series is absolutely outstanding.”\n\n“I watched the first series as a viewer and taking my dinner when it was on. What was striking to me, because I’ve got young kids, is when you went to pick your kids up at school afterwards on that week, everyone in the school was talking about it. I think that’s fantastic. Parents were watching a bit of drama and then going to pick their kids up.”\n\nDaniel Ryan, who plays John:\n\n“My ex-father-in-law was in a home with Alzheimer’s and I watched my ex-wife having to balance the love for her dad with having to deal with a complete stranger. He wasn’t the person that she’d grown up with. He’d turned into somebody else. And watching her go through the pain of that was something that attracted me to the story. A love story in many different ways. And a human story. That’s always the thing that certainly I want to watch when I switch on the telly.”\n\nJohn Fay, writer of the first film:\n\n“Old age is something that’s coming for all of us and there’s no getting away from it. It’s a universal theme.”\n\n“It’s Play For Today. That’s the beauty of this whole thing. Ten writers given carte blanche to write what they want to write. Long may that continue.”\n\nThe 2010 Moving On films with some of the leading cast members:\n\nMon Nov 1: Sauce For The Goose – Anna Massey, Susannah Harker, Daniel Ryan and Pooky Quesnel.

The money’s too low.’\n\n“And I’ve said, ‘I don’t care how low it is. It’s an opportunity for us to say – this is our work.’\n\n“It is a loss leader, we don’t make any money but I’d rather put every single halfpenny that I’ve got on that screen than to say, ‘I’ve made something weak but I’ve made some money out of it.’ It’s a silly equation, really.”\n\nBelow is a flavour of what they all said at BAFTA.\n\n*********************************************************************\n\nLiam Keelan spoke before a screening of The Milkman and a showreel of highlights from the other four dramas:\n\n“It needs very little introduction this drama. It’s very much a platform for new and up and coming talent, whether that’s writers or directors and so on, mentored by Jimmy McGovern and Colin’s team. We’re very grateful for this drama because it now feels at the heart of BBC Daytime and at the heart of what we should be doing.\n\n“I joke – or not joke – with Colin sometimes about how I think as long as I’m doing this job I want to see Moving On in the schedules. That might not be too long given the BBC cuts going on but I’m very proud of the series.”\n\nLiam assured me later that he had, indeed, been joking about his job.\n\nColin McKeown added: “It’s been a fantastic opportunity to give people their first start in different things. John Fay is a very experienced writer but it’s his first opportunity to write and direct. I think he’s done a great job on it.”\n\nPost-screening Q&A:\n\nLiam: “I’ve often said that Neighbours going to Channel 5, as scary as it was at the time because it was the highest rating show on BBC Daytime, was probably the best thing that could have happened because it freed up a lot of money to do more interesting stuff. It was a stroke of luck in a way.”\n\nWhat about a fourth series for Moving On?\n\nLiam: “We’re sorting out finances and stuff at the moment. As I say, as long as I’m doing this job I think it will continue. No-one else really does it in this way, so I think it’s pretty certain that it will come back.”\n\nEvery other series has also had a later primetime BBC1 re-run slot. The same for series three?\n\nLiam: “I would certainly hope so, yes. I’m sure it will. It’s always been commissioned solely for daytime and it’s the strength of the stories that’s given it a primetime outing.”\n\nJohn Fay explained that The Milkman was his first experience of directing as well as writing:\n\n“I’ve never seen before ‘written and directed by John Fay’ and it just looked wrong! I’ll be eternally grateful for getting the opportunity to do it. I don’t think anyone else would have given me that chance. And it was a fascinating process to go through. The whole team knew their job.\n\n“It’s about giving a chance to new people. I think that’s really valuable – and I have been knocking around for a while on the right side of things. But its great to have that opportunity. It’s basically Play For Today, which is fantastic. It’s great as a writer to be given a slot. Budgets are very low and all that and there’s limited time that you have to film it but just as a writer to be told, ‘Go and write a story, whatever the hell you want,’ is just fabulous.”\n\nJohn Fay wrote the script with Shaun Mason in mind:\n\nShaun Mason: “It was fantastic. I felt so lucky and so fortunate to get the part. I was doing a pantomime, of all things, and I get this call and it was like, ‘Can you do this milkman thing?’ It was amazing. This is a brilliant character.”\n\nI asked Colin what lessons he had learned from making the first two series?\n\nColin: “I think things have got a lot easier because when we first started I’d speak to the agents and they’d go, ‘Who? What?’ So I’d have to try harder to try and convince people.\n\n“One of the things that’s happened organically is that people have liked the show and come together with the show. As a producer it’s the opportunity to have a screen, to get out there and to try your art. And if you don’t practise it you don’t get better.\n\n“I’ve learned an awful lot about every single aspect of it. But I’ve also learned that if you’re really faithful to the material and you put so much emphasis on good writing – and Jimmy is a hard taskmaster for all the right reasons, which is fantastic from our perspective – and don’t try and scrimp and save…\n\n“It’s my series so I can pull in my favours. Having been 40 years in the game, have I got a lot of favours to pull in. And I made them work, hence the cast. But I have to pull in less and less favours these days because people genuinely want to do it. So you do learn and you have to push the bar up and every time we push the bar up. And when we get series four it will be even better.”\n\nI spoke to Liam afterwards and asked if the proposed transfer of some BBC2 daytime content to BBC1 might put pressure on the 2:15pm drama slot?\n\nLiam: “The success of those dramas speak for themselves really and even though the schedule is changing, that part of the BBC1 schedule hasn’t changed at all. It’s still that 2:15 slot in the afternoon. I think it would be mad not to carry on doing drama in the afternoon because it’s so successful.”\n\nOnly five films in the series this time compared to the usual 10?\n\nLiam: “That was down to money, at that time. I think you’ll continue seeing about five of these.”\n\nAnd finally I sat down for a quick chat with Colin McKeown:\n\nColin: “I love it when people say, ‘Do you think you could deliver in an X amount of time?’ If you need a mountain moving by Thursday night, I’ll do it by Wednesday for you. And with the same quality. So I was grateful for the gig, even though it was a reduced gig. But I’m confident that the standards haven’t dropped. If you get less you have to try harder.\n\n“We’ve got an awful lot of people queuing up now saying, ‘Can I be in it?’ And that’s really refreshing. I can’t wait to tell you the list of people who are doing to do series four when we make it. It’s so exciting. Some of the names that have said they’ll do it are breathtaking.\n\n“But already we’ve had Anna Massey and Corin Redgrave, both of them now passed away unfortunately. We had the opportunity of working with both of them just before they died. And I was happy that their last testimony of their work was working with us. Dominic West had a fantastic experience. And the cast for this series is phenomenal.\n\n“I want to inspire other people. I think other people should give chances to writers coming through.\n\n“We get very good feedback. Jimmy sets a standard which is incredible. He’s one of the best writers of his generation. And if it stems from good scripts, it transmits itself to other people, other writers.”\n\nIs he worried by BBC budget cuts?\n\n“I worry about what I can do. As long as I’m given the opportunity then my job is not to let that standard fail in any way. The way I see it is, ‘Nobody can not commission quality like that.’ More fool them if they don’t, in my humble opinion. It’s worrying to see a closing in of the industry but from what I believe, drama is not going to be hit anywhere near other areas. I think they’re losing one series overall on BBC but they’re going to be made up in a couple of years.”\n\nSeries four?\n\n“We know we can’t get the green light until April 1st because that’s when the financial New Year starts. And where we place it in that year – we can shoot it sometime within that year. But because we’ve got an awful lot of people who have said they want to be in it, we’ve got the luxury of making sure it fits their availability. And that’s what we’ll do. We’ve still got to keep the bulk of the shoot together but if it means pushing it towards the back end of the year, we will.”\n\nMoving On BBC One\n\nMoving On: Plays For Our Today\n\nLA Productions\n\nFollow Ian Wylie on Twitter\n\nTWO sons. Two mothers.\n\n“I thought they were going for a pizza…”\n\nIf you have plans for Sunday night, cancel them now.\n\nCommon (BBC1, 9pm Sunday) is yet another classic drama by writer Jimmy McGovern.\n\nMatched by the talents of a cast including Nico Mirallegro, Susan Lynch, Daniel Mays and Jodhi May, plus director David Blair.\n\nThe 90-minute film tells the story of Johnjo O’Shea, played by Nico, who gives his cousin and two mates a lift to get a pizza.\n\nBut Johnjo is unaware his three passengers are going to “have a word” with a local loudmouth.\n\nAs he sits outside waiting in the car for his pizza, one of the trio takes offence to a young innocent bystander and stabs him.\n\nWhat happens next is an eye-opening look at the UK’s controversial Joint Enterprise Law.\n\nWhich means you can end up serving life in prison, even if you had nothing to do with a murder and weren’t even at the scene.\n\nIf you’re thinking “grim and worthy” think again.\n\nCommon is a brilliant drama of twists and turns with award-winning performances from the ensemble cast.\n\nSusan and Daniel play Margaret and Tommy, the divorced parents of murder victim Thomas Ward (Harry McMullen).\n\nWith Jodhi May and Andrew Tiernan as Coleen and Pete, the parents of 17-year-old Johnjo.\n\nThe LA Productions drama was screened at BAFTA in London yesterday (Wednesday).\n\nMy transcript of the post-screening Q&A is below, edited to remove content that would result in major spoilers.\n\nAlthough I have left in the discussion around a searing scene of grief involving Susan Lynch and Daniel Mays as Margaret sees her son’s body in a mortuary.\n\nOnce seen, never forgotten.\n\nCommon is on BBC1 at 9pm on Sunday (July 6).\n\nBAFTA Q&A with Jimmy McGovern (writer and executive producer), David Blair (director), Daniel Mays (Tommy), Andrew Tiernan (Pete), Robert Pugh (DI Hastings) and chaired by LA Productions boss Colin McKeown (producer and executive producer) who asked the questions before opening it up to the audience:\n\nQ: Jimmy – do these subject matters find you or do you find them? And if you could tell us how it all started in the first place?\n\nJimmy McGovern: “This one found me, actually. I’ve just received a message, ‘Jimmy, don’t know whether you want to mention this at the Q@A but we’ve just heard in Liverpool today, those five lads have been sentenced.’ This is one about a group of lads who chased a boy up to a launderette and there was a stabbing in the yard. It’s a typical case of Joint Enterprise. The eldest aged 19 – this is just today – jailed for life with an 18 years’ minimum term. Two 15-year-olds got life with a minimum of nine and 12 years and a 14-year-old got life with a minimum of nine years. Another, who was only 13 at the time of the incident, received a six years’ minimum sentence. And that’s only today on Merseyside.\n\n“This came about because I opened up a letter and it was a woman explaining that this person she loved was inside and he was totally innocent. I was just about to write back and say, ‘Sorry, I’m too busy, too tired, too lazy…’ And then I looked and it was written four months previously or something. She’d put the wrong post code on the envelope and it had taken months to get to me. And so I didn’t want her to think I had sat on her letter for months while this precious boy was inside. So I snatched up the phone and phoned her. And as soon as I got a human voice at the other end of the phone, that was it. I was sucked in. You can’t say no to a woman, pleading. So that was the reason. This one did find me, yes.”\n\nQ: David – I was shocked when I saw the rushes, particularly over the Susan Lynch scene. I wonder if you could just describe how that came about? Tell us how it happened?\n\nDavid Blair: “It was a strange one, actually, because the early part of it wasn’t in the script. What Jimmy had written originally was the main scene that follows. And I was a bit worried that we were going to come into something feeling that we’d missed something. At that point there wasn’t a scene with Susan seeing the body. She’d passed that responsibility on to Danny (playing Tommy) earlier in the scene. Really it was a belt and braces moment when we shot it, to be honest, because I just wanted to be sure that I wouldn’t be sitting in the cutting room thinking what I felt before. We rehearsed it but kept the body out of the room until we shot it. So that kind of raw reaction that she gives there is absolutely spontaneous and indeed is Danny’s also. We had spoken to the guy who ran the mortuary before we shot the scene and he said the really most difficult circumstances involved estranged couples. Because everything that you would spontaneously do in such a circumstance, you couldn’t. You couldn’t put your arm round somebody or share in that grief. It was a strange…two separate griefs. And that made it a challenge and I thought, ultimately, made it worthwhile having it in the film.”\n\nQ: Daniel, if you were one of these actors who did a page count and said, ‘I don’t think I’ll take this part because I’ve only got whatever the quantity is to say’…if you were weighing up the amount of your contribution in those ways, you might well have been put off and said, ‘There’s not a phenomenal amount on paper for me to do.’ But in reality there was an enormous amount to do. What drew you into it?\n\nDaniel Mays: “First and foremost, it’s a Jimmy McGovern drama. I did an episode of The Street in the past. I know the quality of the stuff. So that immediately sparks your interest. But in the audition was the reconciliation speech that you see. That in itself is just a phenomenal piece of writing. Just to be a small part of the cast and to contribute means the world to me, really. Watching it again, what strikes me is it truly is an ensemble piece. Every actor, no matter how small their part, contributes massively. You just want to be a part of it, really. I can recognise good quality writing and the message behind the drama I think was a really important thing to be part of.”\n\nQ: Andrew – what attracted you?\n\nAndrew Tiernan: “I’ve worked with Jimmy before and it was just straight away, ‘Yeah, I’ve got to do this.’ And obviously then researching into Joint Enterprise and what was going on there. And obviously gone out and spoken about it, it’s just surprising that the general public out there and family and friends don’t actually know about this thing. So it’s a very important film to be a part of.”\n\nQ: Bob – did you do any research or feel the need to do any research? All of the cast, when I spoke to them, they hadn’t heard about Joint Enterprise at all.\n\nRobert Pugh: “Same here. I don’t think I needed to do research. Initially again, like the lads said, it’s a Jimmy McGovern script and that is incredibly appealing in itself with the bonus of David there. The research came afterwards and during, actually, talking to the mothers particularly, who were victims of this…and it was quite eye-opening. I don’t still quite understand the minutiae of it. But the general message of it, as we’ve seen here, it is quite a bad thing. And the fact that it hasn’t gone through Parliament, it’s all set by precedent, is an iniquitous thing, actually. It just indicates the more and more police state that I think we are heading for. And the people who are the most vulnerable are the people who are the most ignorant of it. IE The kids on the streets.”\n\nQ: Jim – I know you feel a big responsibility to all your dramas but in particular dramas like this which affect so many people. What we all feel about a lot of your writing is, there’s not much of it. The words are very, very thin and there always seems to be a tremendous space there. Is that something really deliberate from your point of view?\n\nJimmy McGovern: “It’s a strange thing, that. There was once…I tried to shorten the scene. You’ve come across this David, haven’t you? I took words out. And what was left became even more pregnant. And the scene was longer. It was just strange. That’s what aim for as a writer. It’s not always there.\n\n“But on that point Bob made before, just think of the enormity of getting sentenced to life imprisonment on a ‘law’ that has never been passed by the British Parliament? That’s extraordinary. Your democratically elected representatives have had nothing to do with this law and yet it sends you to prison for the rest of your life. It’s extraordinary. It’s a doctrine, a concept.”\n\nColin then opened up questions to the audience:\n\nQ (From me, as it happens) Jimmy, we saw the information flash up on screen at the end about the Commons’ Select Committee looking into this. What are the prospects for some action being taken, as far as you can see?\n\nJimmy McGovern: “I don’t know. I just hope maybe there’s a question asked in Parliament or something like that. It’s a TV drama. It might just pass. You never know. I’m never optmistic about changes to British law.”\n\nColin McKeown: “What we can say, though, it has been seen by the Select Committee. It’s the first gig I’ve ever been to in my life where the Houses of Parliament have watched a movie before the public have.”\n\nQ: And did you get any reaction from them?\n\nColin McKeown: “They’re not there to give reaction, really. But I think they did genuinely appreciate that it was done.”\n\nQ: (Still from me) Can I ask Danny to talk about filming that searing scene with Susan in the mortuary?\n\nDaniel Mays: “It was exhausting. Full on. Susan Lynch in an absolutely phenomenal actor. It was quite spaced out, my days of filming. So to work with someone as good as Susan, she was so ‘in it.’ Even off camera. I’m not saying method acting or anything, but you could see that she was completely focused and concentrated. So when you work with someone as brilliant as that, it helps. I don’t know, you just have to embrace it and give it your all. But we were aided every step of the way with the brilliant direction of David. He dropped in fantastic notes along the way so you’ve got to be able to respond to the notes that you get and try and lay down a performance. But that’s true…when she ‘smashed’ the glass, that was never scripted. She kind of just did it in the wide shot. And I can remember I just wanted to put my arm around her. I actually found it so upsetting. And yet when you’re in character it completely makes sense that he is unable to do that. That’s the great thing about the writing again, is the fact that they are in this horrendously fractured relationship and somehow these two people have to connect again through the loss of their son. It’s a really interesting dynamic that relationship and to play it out was thrilling. You just want to do stuff like that as an actor.”\n\nQ: What was the biggest challenge for you while working on this film? That’s a question for Jimmy and for the actors as well.\n\nJimmy McGovern: “Me, personally, I wanted to be even-handed. The enormity of murder has to be addressed. There is no greater injustice than murder. Every other injustice pales into insignificance besides having your life snatched away from you. So that was the main one from me. Even-handedness was the main challenge.”\n\nAndrew Tiernan: “I think it was just having the responsibility of meeting the mums from JENGbA (Joint Enterprise: Not Guilty by Association) and hearing all their stories. So obviously representing that and trying to get the reality of that over.”\n\nDaniel Mays: “We did the read-through at Liverpool Town Hall and all the mothers were there and they heard the script for the first time. It was the most profound experience to go through because as it progressed they were getting more and more upset. You could just feel the emotion in the room that was pouring off of them. It just fuelled that responsibility that you had to bring it to life.”\n\nRobert Pugh: “Absolutely. When you saw that response from the reading in Liverpool Town Hall, you were a part of this, it was going to be a tremendous privilege to be a part of it and to fight for the truth of it. And great responsibility, definitely. And therefore a great challenge. It was very moving during it. And the whole thing of talking to the mothers was a bit of an immense experience.”\n\nQ: How do these prisoners serve time and be guilty for something they didn’t do?\n\nJimmy McGovern: “The awful thing as well, is part of the process of getting out of there is to acknowledge your guilt. If you don’t acknowledge your guilt, you don’t get out. So how can you acknowledge your guilt when you’re not guilty? There are people languishing in prison. That guy from Liverpool, an awful murder in Lodge Lane. Everybody knows he’s innocent. He’s been inside for 33 years and he’s totally innocent. (Having been given a 15-year tariff).\n\nQ: What effect do you think the film will have on bringing attention to Joint Enterprise, in the sense of making more scared of it or to go against it and stand up to it and not accepting it as a given?\n\nJimmy McGovern: “I don’t know how it will be received. I’ve never thought about it would frighten people more. I’ve never thought about it in those terms. It will be changed by people like Glo (JENGbA Campaign Co-ordinator Gloria Morrison). In my experience that’s how laws are changed. People campaign against them and get them changed. Look, I could give you chapter and verse on Jack Straw, a Labour Justice minister. And he was an absolute disgrace. He let people languish in prison knowing they were totally innocent. Never lifted a finger to help the Hillsborough families. In fact, went out of his way to hinder them. He and Tony Blair. That’s a Labour guy. They won’t do anything. It’s people like Gloria campaigning. That’s how you get laws changed.”\n\nBBC One Common\n\nJimmy McGovern\n\nLA Productions\n\nJENGbA\n\nIan Wylie on Twitter\n\n“WE always hear, ‘Golden age of British drama.’\n\n“It’s not. It’s a golden age of British acting talent.\n\n“We have never been so blessed in this country. It is incredible.”\n\nJimmy McGovern speaking at the London BAFTA launch of Moving On series six last month.\n\nFive new stand alone dramas by up and coming writers starting on BBC1 at 2:15pm tomorrow (Monday Nov 10).\n\nThere’s a lot to like about both this series and the company behind it, Liverpool-based LA Productions led by Colin McKeown.\n\nMonday’s first story – Madge – is written by Shaun Duggan, directed by actor Reece Dinsdale and stars Hayley Mills, Peter Egan and Kenneth Cranham.\n\nThe 45-minute tale of a woman in her late 60s living life to the full and hiding a big secret.\n\nTuesday is The Signature by Anthony Gannnie and stars Lisa Riley as Moira and Graeme Hawley as her husband Ken, struggling to pay their bills.\n\nFull details of all five dramas are at this link.\n\nHere’s the story I wrote immediately after the launch, followed by some Q&A material from those involved – including Hayley Mills:\n\nFORMER Strictly star Lisa Riley “loved” being de-glammed for her latest gritty TV drama role.\n\nThe ex-Emmerdale actress plays Moira, a hard-up school dinner lady who also works in a corner shop to keep her family afloat, in BBC1’s Moving On.\n\nLisa revealed: “I look like I haven’t had a wash for 10 years. No glamour whatsoever. But I love it. You’ve got to get it right and I’m proud of the performance.”\n\n2014 Strictly contestant Alison Hammond has revealed 2012 semi finalist Lisa inspired her to take to the dancefloor.\n\nBut there’s no sign of fake tan and sequins in the hard-hitting drama, which co-stars Graeme Hawley – Corrie killer John Stape – as Moira’s husband Ken, who suffers from MS.\n\nLisa explained: “When we were doing the school canteen scenes it was a freezing cold day but make-up were putting sweat on me because a big girl would be sweating.\n\n“She’s an earthy northern woman. I wanted to look how she would look. You want to get it right. It’s important.\n\n“There’s nothing that drives me more mental in British drama with certain actresses – I’m naming no names. But it drives me to distraction.\n\n“If you can’t cry and you can’t feel it, don’t do it. Otherwise it’s fake. I like to shock people in my career.”\n\nLisa has also resumed her role as a behind-the-scenes reporter on Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two hosted by Zoe Ball.\n\nShe stars in the second of five new Moving On dramas on BBC1 this Tuesday. (Nov 11)\n\nDamian Kavanagh, Controller of BBC Daytime, introduced the BAFTA screening by revealing he had already commissioned series seven:\n\n“We’re six series in. Over 30 episodes. Personally I think it gets stronger all the time. It’s really hard always trying to keep a long running series fresh. But Colin and Jimmy and the team, every time they just pull together incredible actors, performers, directors and crew. And just raise the bar all the time.\n\n“When I saw this series, I watched the five episodes back to back. And was so impressed by what I saw I straight away commissioned another five episodes. It’s an amazing piece of work. Something that we are absolutely proud to have on BBC1.”\n\nAfter a screening of the first two episodes, Colin McKeown said: “If you’ve seen two better female performances this year I will be very, very surprised.”\n\nJimmy McGovern: “What we have is a big team of writers and they all come with ideas and we simply pick eight ideas, do a wee bit of work on the story, try to improve the story, hopefully. and then pass on the eight ideas to Damian there, who then picks from maybe 12 ideas this time. So we put a fair bit of work into the initial story. And once you get a long short list, we then work harder on those stories. So it’s a team effort.\n\n“On this I only work on the story. I get the writer into the room and we bash the stories around. So I don’t touch the script. Only in extreme circumstances, which haven’t really occurred. I think daytime drama must give you the right to fail. And as long as we’ve got the right to fail, that’s the way we should work with up and coming writers. They need the right to fail as well as the right to succeed or the opportunity to succeed. Whereas on Accused and The Street there’s no right to fail. You’ve got to succeed.”\n\nJimmy later commented: “It’s the curse of the industry – inflated language. A play can’t be good any more. It’s got to be brilliant. Well it isn’t brilliant. I’ve never seen a brilliant play. I’ve seen a good play, once or twice. But the inflated language gets in the way of honesty.”\n\nQ: Hayley – what drew you to this?\n\nHayley Mills: “It was a bloody good script. And a wonderful part. Great pedigree. It was a gift. There was no question. It was a joy from start to finish. I don’t remember working so hard. It was really full on, non-stop. But it’s a great company. Committed, creative and passionate people. Just wonderful. I loved every minute of it.”\n\nColin McKeown: “And I’ll say this on Hayley’s behalf – she’s never worked as hard, or for as less.” (laughter)\n\nQ: The culture shock of shooting a script in six days and you’re in every single scene?\n\nHayley Mills: “Yes. A few sleepless nights, I have to say. Luckily I had a week away. I left the country. My brother had somewhere in Italy and my partner and I went to stay with him. And that’s all I did for a whole week, is learn my lines. And then when I arrived in Liverpool I met my director, Reece Dinsdale, who was so supportive and so encouraging. I felt he was like a forklift truck under me. He just swept me along. And the whole crew, the cast, everybody’s working together. It’s all a team effort and you just get swept along by it. It wasn’t until it’s all over that I got on the train back to London and collapsed.”\n\nBBC Moving On\n\nLA Productions\n\nMoving On Blogs\n\nIan Wylie on Twitter"
