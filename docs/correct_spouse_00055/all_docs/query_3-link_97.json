        "text": "THE interview notes are buried somewhere in my archives.\n\nI first met up with Nicola Walker back in the late 1990s when she starred in The Last Train and Touching Evil.\n\nShe is, of course, now best known as Ruth Evershed in Spooks.\n\nWhile still finding time for stage roles, including another at the National Theatre in London this Christmas.\n\nI spoke to Nicola again recently for the new series of Spooks.\n\nMy feature was used in the MEN on Monday but has yet to go online.\n\nSo let’s put that right below – followed by some edited extracts from the rest of our conversation.\n\nNext week Ruth goes undercover, as you can read in my previous Spooks blog here.\n\n**********************************************\n\nSPOOKS star Nicola Walker was thrilled to see action away from MI5 HQ in the new series of the spy drama.\n\nShe plays intelligence analyst Ruth Evershed, mostly based on The Grid, Section D’s high security offices at Thames House.\n\nBut viewers can look forward to Ruth fighting the good fight in action scenes to be screened towards the end of this ninth season.\n\n“I get to go out and have quite extensive fight sequences, which I’m excited about,” explains Nicola. “Not in a brave way – in a really messy way because that’s not what she does. And I love them for doing that, for sticking someone out, getting themselves into trouble and having to defend herself.\n\n“It involved a two day stunt sequence, the best one I’ve ever had on Spooks. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Just brilliant being thrown into bookcases and proper balsa wood being hit over your head. All the stuff that the proper spies, the gorgeous young spies, get to do. Finally the desk spook – I got out and got to do it.”\n\nWere there any mishaps during filming? “No, none at all. I was totally over-excited. People were saying to me, ‘Are you OK? Do you want to put knee pads on?’ And I said, ‘No, no I don’t. Let’s just do it again.’”\n\nSpooks (BBC1, tonight – Monday Oct 4 – 9pm) finds Ruth and Section D chief Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) at odds as the team battle to stop the release of a lethal nerve agent which would kill millions.\n\nNicola, 40, returned to Spooks last year, after leaving in series five to have son Harry, named after Firth’s character. “Uncle Peter often talks about how actually my son is his child,” she laughs.\n\n“Peter has got a great sense of humour. You can’t always show it on screen but I think you can tell. That’s why people like his character. He’s someone you’d really like to have dinner with and he’d tell you stuff he’s not meant to tell you, as well. Peter would make a dreadful spy.\n\n“We do laugh a lot and that is quite addictive, that atmosphere on The Grid. The adrenaline rush of acting with Peter, where you are flying by the seat of your pants and laughing your head off every day when you go to work. That is a draw to get you back.”\n\nNicola’s return kept viewers guessing about whether Ruth and Harry would ever get together. Within the first four minutes of this year’s series, he had proposed and she had turned him down, later explaining: “We couldn’t be more together than we are now.”\n\nThe former Touching Evil and The Last Train actress adds: “But with all their human frailties, it’s not as simple as that. They continue to have to address the fact that they adore each other.\n\n“But equally they’re individuals who are incapable of doing anything about that. So it doesn’t go away but it’s changing and it gets quite messy. Like love affairs do when they’re not quite going the way they should.”\n\nFans certainly aren’t shy about voicing their opinions. “I did a theatre play after the last series and quite a few of the real proper Spooks fans came to see it and had chats about the show.\n\n“They’re very honest. They don’t mince their words. If they like something, they say it. And equally if they don’t, they’re quite upfront about it. It can be quite brutal. But it’s always really intelligent and passionate and involved. So the show is doing something right.”\n\nThere has been speculation that this could be the last series of Spooks, mainly based on the fact that it’s been around for so long. But the Kudos production has upped its game yet again and the signs are that a tenth season is likely to be commissioned.\n\n“It’s Iike a shark, it’s kept moving. I think this series is much better than last year. If they never made another I would be really angry, because you think, ‘Well, a series like Spooks, if it was the last one, it would be a spectacular last one.’\n\n“I don’t know. I think Kudos are a lot cleverer than that. But then I’m just an actor. What do I know? I’d be very surprised if this was the last one. No-one told me. I’d like it to be Kudos that decides.”\n\nNicola has also filmed a guest role for an episode in the next series of BBC3 hit Being Human. She plays health visitor Wendy who stumbles into the house occupied by the comedy drama’s resident werewolf, vampire and ghost.\n\n“She thinks she’s having a bad day. But because she doesn’t know anything about the people in the house, she doesn’t realise just how bad a day she could be having.\n\n“The cast were telling me things about the show. And I was going, ‘No, no, no, you don’t understand. I know everything about it. I’m a fan.’ I had the best time.”\n\n***********************************************\n\nExtras:\n\n1. Former Home Secretary Nicholas Blake (Robert Glenister) series nine episode one description of Ruth as: “That dogged brilliant bitch.” Her intelligence work ultimately led to his death:\n\n“When that came out in the readthrough, there was an audible gasp from everyone in the room. I think it’s an accurate description for that character. For him, Ruth is exactly that. I think it’s very funny that Ruth would be considered a bitch. It’s quite a violent term for someone. But she’s definitely dogged, she doesn’t let go. She’s a terrier of information. So he is right on that level. And if she’s not on your side, you’re in trouble. That’s what happens to him.”\n\n2. Her scenes with Peter bookended the first episode. Line at end when Ruth says: “We couldn’t be more together than we are now.”\n\n“I think what they’ve done, which is one of the reasons that I really respect the writers on Spooks, is that they’re ahead. They know an audience is going to say, ‘Well, come on, what are they doing? Are they going to do anything or aren’t they?’ So they addressed it in the first four minutes of episode one and then the scene on the roof, which does seem to tie it up. But with all their human frailties, it’s not as simple as that…”\n\n3. The issue of Ruth and Harry has to be addressed?\n\n“I think it does with those two characters. They’ve worked together for a long time now and they’re grown ups. I think it’s quite interesting that they both realise that, actually, it isn’t possible. We talked a lot about that, what would happen? Would Ruth fall on her sword? Would she leave The Grid because it just wouldn’t work? And I think that speech is very accurate. What would they do if they did get married and settle down? I think what happens is there’s a mutual understanding that it’s something that they can’t keep picking at and they can’t keep talking about. It develops in that way, in quite a grown up way, which I really enjoyed playing, actually.”\n\n4. Her return to Spooks last year?\n\n“It’ll never be as easy to come back to a show as it was to come back to Spooks. In my head I had left. Especially with a show like that, you don’t presume you will ever be invited back, even if you’re not killed on screen. It’s not the kind of show that invites you back. It doesn’t do it. But it was very simple, actually. I went into the Kudos office one day to show everyone my son, like you do when you’re a proud first time parent. And as I was leaving, Jane Featherstone (Kudos Creative Director) said, ‘Why don’t you come back next year?‘ And I said, ‘Yeah, I’d love to.‘ And that was it. It wasn’t complicated. Jane asked and I said yes. It was as simple as that. I don’t think that happens very often. I take that as a great compliment, being asked to go back to a show like Spooks. I really did. I had a really lovely time, I must be honest.”\n\n5. Kudos is a company that makes quick decisions?\n\n“Kudos don’t mess about. Also, you don’t know how long you’re going to be there and that’s quite interesting as well.”\n\n6. Does little Harry (her son) meet his Uncle Harry much off screen?\n\n“No. We see each other for five months of the year, all of us. I’m sure that’s plenty, as much as we get on and love each other. Five months out of the year is enough.”\n\n7. You had been concerned last year at the reaction of viewers to Ruth coming back:\n\n“Yes, I was really worried because I know that they really love the characters. It’s quite interesting where you feel the relationship might not go the way they would have wished it to. So I was quite nervous about that. But you can’t worry about that, can you? I’m not in control of that. That’s actually not my job.”\n\n8. Problems with the last series?\n\n“It’s a long running series and maybe you can’t hope to up it every year. That is always the intention. I wasn’t in it the year before and I thought that was tremendous – season seven. I thought that was fabulous. I don’t really know. It is a collaborative work. I don’t think there’s any one thing you can point the finger at. All I know is that it feels different this year and maybe that’s something to do with feeling last year that we’d plateaud in some sense. Maybe that alone is enough to make you work harder. I’m not sure. I really don’t know. The scripts have always been last minute with Spooks. I quite enjoy that. I quite enjoy how terrifying that is. I quite like that side of it. And it gives you a strange freedom that you don’t get on other shows and a level of anarchy that I really enjoy.”\n\n9. Ruth flat sharing with Beth?\n\n“It doesn’t go well. I think it was very awkward for Ruth. She’s basically been set up to spy upon a new young recruit. That’s not going to suit Ruth. That won’t last. She won’t like that. It’s too dishonest for her. So that’s not ongoing. I’m just letting her stay but she has to wash the bath and do the loo. And also buy wine.”\n\n10. The cost of being a spy has been high for Ruth. Harry aside, she had her new life in Cyprus destroyed. Her stepson is still with an aunt there?\n\n“There’s a little return to some of that. They’ve all paid a high cost, haven’t they? For me this year, it’s been about how people keep going. That they hit these tragedies, they lose these people that they love or respect or work side by side with, and what is more frightening is that they keep going. I find that quite interesting. So they count the cost and keep going.\n\n“So I think they’ve done their cost counting. This year you see these moments of doubt in Harry and Ruth finds them incredibly distasteful. Which I think is really well written. I like the fact that it isn’t tea and sympathy. She’s really disappointed. Of course there’s cost, because that’s their job.”\n\n11. Shift in power between them. He’s in charge but she’s reminding him of what’s important and that he must go on?\n\n“Yes. She’s become a little bit like the conscience mumbling into his ear. And he bats that down a bit this year as well, which I think is really good. As he would. He’s quite right to because he is the boss and he does remind her of that on occasions this year, which is quite painful for Ruth. The line has got totally blurred and he pulls it back.”\n\n12. Spooks just as relevant as ever?\n\n“Yes. I think it’s a good one this year. I really hope it goes down well this year. It deserves to. But I suppose when something has been around for…yes, it has been a long time. We did spend a long time this year saying to each other, ‘It would be 10 years next year.‘ That’s amazing, really.”\n\n13. Playing comedy in Being Human – with former Touching Evil co-star Robson Green guesting in a separate episode?\n\n“Yes. It’s not a particularly straight role. I would have loved to have seen Robson. I haven’t seen him for ages. And I can’t wait to see him in it. I know a little bit about the part he is playing and it’s going to be brilliant. He’s not playing a comedy role at all. So I didn’t get to see him but I sent messages through the make-up department.”\n\n14. Playing Rachel in Season’s Greetings back at the National Theatre in London this December?\n\n“I am, with such an amazing cast. Have you seen the cast? I’m terrified. It’s a very good cast list. There’s some very fine actors and actresses in there. It’s just a little bit daunting. I’m really looking forward to it. It’s going to be great. I’m going to be there all Christmas and New Year.”\n\n15. Turning 40:\n\n“I’ve embraced it. I went and had a drink with some friends. Not a huge celebration. I was filming the next day so it wasn’t really an ideal night to go out. So, yeah, done that. 40. Check. Done. It’s a relief, to be honest. I’ve been waiting to get to 40 for years.”\n\n16. Now grown into the role of Ruth?\n\n“Yes, I’m the right age now. Definitely. It’s a very strange feeling. I can remember starting and thinking, ‘I’m far too young to play this part.’ And now it’s absolutely spot on.”\n\n17. Feedback from fans after last series?\n\n“It’s brilliant that they get so involved. I hadn’t imagined the show garnering that sort of a following. I really hadn’t. And it’s always really intelligent and passionate and involved. So the show is still doing something right.”\n\nSeason’s Greetings at the National Theatre\n\nSpooks BBC Site\n\nSpooks Blogs\n\nSpooks Fan Forum\n\nFollow Ian Wylie on Twitter\n\n“IT feels a lot harder now than when I started,” said writer John Fay.\n\n“There’s definitely more writers and actors out of work. There’s less getting done.\n\n“And I do think that comes down to money. If people aren’t investing in it, then it’s not getting made, is it?’”\n\nFortunately for those who love TV drama (and who doesn’t?), there are people like Colin McKeown around with the talent, know-how and sheer force of will to produce series like Moving On.\n\nMy feature on the second series of Moving On is in today’s (Tue Oct 26) MEN.\n\nYou can read it below, plus a few extras from those involved in the 45-minute BBC1 Daytime films.\n\nFollowed by a quick rundown of the 10 new episodes and some of the leading cast members in each one.\n\n*********************************************\n\nHARRY Potter actor Jason Isaacs wants to be in the next series. “I’ll write, direct and make the sandwiches. All for one price,” he promises.\n\nLinda Green and Doctor Who star Daniel Ryan points out that it’s not always about the money: “You’d get an actor crawling over broken glass to do a good script.”\n\nThey are both talking about Moving On (BBC1, Monday, 2:15pm), which returns for a second series of 10 stand alone films screened over consecutive weekdays during the next fortnight.\n\nCreated by award-winning writer Jimmy McGovern, the acclaimed series is essentially Play For Today transported into the afternoons, with a primetime repeat slot promised for a later date. If you can’t watch them live, set your TV recorder of choice now.\n\nThis year there are double the number of stories and a cast list including John Simm, Gerard Kearns, Jenny Agutter, Jack Deam, Naomi Radcliffe, Richard Fleeshman, Claire Skinner, Hugo Speer, Lorraine Ashbourne, Robert Glenister, Lisa Faulkner and Kieran O’Brien.\n\nThe Wire’s Dominic West makes his UK directing debut in Malaise, shown a week on Thursday, featuring Life On Mars star Simm as Moose, an armed robber released from jail after an eight-year sentence. Trainspotting’s Ewen Bremner plays the man now living with his ex, the mother of Moose’s daughter.\n\nProducer Colin McKeown was 19 when he joined Granada in Manchester and spent the next 10 years learning every aspect of television broadcasting. Now an industry veteran, he founded Liverpool-based LA Productions in 2000 and is not a man who takes no for an answer.\n\nHe recalls how he found himself next to Dominic in the toilets at BAFTA. “I’d watched five seasons of The Wire. I looked to my right and there he was. He was a captive audience, he couldn’t move, as you can imagine. So I hassled and hustled him and by the time we got out of that loo, I’d convinced him he should come to Liverpool and direct and episode of Moving On.”\n\nThe first film – Sauce For The Goose – features Susannah Harker as divorcee Anne, forced to put her life on hold for mother Bella (Anna Massey), who has Alzheimer’s. Then in walks computer repairman John, played by Daniel Ryan.\n\n“My wife died of dementia and I lived through every second of that film,” says Colin. “I knew how real it was. But also glad that the writer John Fay punctuated it with a bit of lightness.”\n\nPride and Prejudice actress Susannah points out: “My grandmother had Parkinson’s. So I witnessed her deterioration. It’s about the heart and the humanity in the scripts. That’s why actors are able to connect so easily with it. It’s a good script. That’s rare. You’ll get people to do it. There’s no money!”\n\nBudgets are tight. But Colin aims to ensure that the cash goes towards making the best production he can. “We would be honest to people and say, ‘We ain’t got the bread.’ If you want to do this, you do it for the right reasons.’\n\n“Every single actor is paid exactly the same, Anna Massey onwards. The first episode we ever did was with Sheila Hancock and she got paid exactly the same as everybody else. Nobody is doing this for the money. But there are benefits. We can take risks and give people chances.”\n\nThe second week of films includes The Test, starring Hannah Gordon and Corin Redgrave in his last role before he died in April at the age of 70. He plays “silver fox trumpet player” Gabe in a love story now dedicated to his memory.\n\nCorin, brother of Vanessa and father of Jemma, was already very ill when he filmed the production just over three months before his death. “It was so emotional. We all knew he wasn’t going to last long,” says Colin.\n\n“All the cast and crew said, ‘Let’s go for it and get him through this.’ Sometimes it was line by line. But he was such a trouper. He knew. He went, ‘I’m being a bore to you, aren’t I?’ And I went, ‘No, you’re not. You’re OK.’ Then he’d do the scene. It was a patchwork quilt, a lot of it.”\n\nLeading actors in expensive TV dramas have to be insured in case something happens which stops them from completing the job, leaving the production company with a choice of either scrapping their film or re-shooting all over again with a replacement.\n\nBut in Corin’s case, no company would take the risk on what Colin describes as “a dying man”. He reveals: “They didn’t insure him. I took the hit. I just said, ‘Well, if we don’t make it, we don’t make it and that’s the end of it. I’d write off the money if I had to.’ Nobody is going to insure somebody as ill as that. Sometimes you just have to say, ‘Well OK.’\n\n“It was six days’ filming overall. He said, ‘Colin, I want you to get a trumpeter. I want to be able to do the fingerwork, chords and all that.’ And he did. He was stunning. I can’t watch that without tears. I couldn’t tell you how proud we were of him.\n\n“I can’t wait for people to see his performance because it’s absolutely brilliant. He put his heart and soul into it.”\n\n***********************************************\n\nExtras:\n\nLiam Keelan, Controller of BBC Daytime:\n\nMoving On was one of his first commissions when he took the job over two years ago: “It’s one of the ones I feel most proud of because it felt like a real departure for Daytime. Something that handles tough subjects with real intelligence and verve.”\n\n“One of the best things to happen to BBC Daytime was losing Neighbours, even though it was the highest rating show, because it freed up so much airtime and so much money to do projects like this.”\n\nThe reduction in long-running TV drama, from Brookside to The Bill: “It’s hard out there. There are a lot of really talented people who want to work. From my point of view it feels like a no-brainer to do more of these (Daytime drama commissions) because we’re the only broadcaster producing originated drama in daytime. It’s a key point of differentiation. I’d like to do a lot more of that stuff. Obviously the financial restraints are there but I’ll certainly be looking to do more.”\n\nWriting for a pre-watershed daytime audience? “By and large, there aren’t any edicts that say, ‘You must write in a certain way for daytime. I wouldn’t want to go down that road at all. If you look at the slot that it plays in, in the mid-afternoon, there’s a greater proportion of an adult, older, audience than there is, say, watching EastEnders at eight ‘o clock where you’ve got more kids around.”\n\nColin McKeown, producer:\n\n“Like a lot of things in life, there are moments when the bull**** stops, the talking stops and, metaphorically, you stand centre stage, the curtain rises and you face the consequences of your actions. In our case, the consequences are the second series of Moving On. And our promise to Liam from all of the team was that we would move the bar up. There’s absolutely no point in staying the same or just trying to achieve the same. We set our aspirations a lot higher than series one. And I believe fundamentally that we’ve achieved it.”\n\n“It’s not just opportunities for the writers. If you were to take the first series, the first three episodes was a first time director. The second series we’ve got a number of firsts. We took risks right across the board.”\n\n“We had a phenomenal cast, drawn to it by the quality of the script – if good work is offered, they would do it. Not enough people ask. I will always ask. I will knock on people’s doors if need by and say, ‘Well, what’s the problem with you? Why don’t you want to do it? It’s a really good script.’ They want to do it for the right reasons.”\n\n“Jimmy’s (McGovern) technique that he’d used on The Street and Accused (coming to BBC1 next month) and so forth was one of story, story, story. It wasn’t to choose the writer in the first place. The brief in general was, ‘Write about a character or characters that have reached a crosspoint in their life and move on.’ You write about what you want to write. From our perspective, it was what moved us, touched us.”\n\n“Jimmy’s got a great nose and if we were making wine, he would sniff the grape and say, ‘That’s the one.’ We’d do all the hard work after that!”\n\nJimmy McGovern, creator of the series:\n\n“We use a lot of up and coming writers as well as established ones. It means work in Liverpool. After Brookside went, there were an awful lot of writers with no opportunities at all. So this provides that opportunity. I did very little.”\n\n“The standard of acting throughout the series is absolutely outstanding.”\n\n“I watched the first series as a viewer and taking my dinner when it was on. What was striking to me, because I’ve got young kids, is when you went to pick your kids up at school afterwards on that week, everyone in the school was talking about it. I think that’s fantastic. Parents were watching a bit of drama and then going to pick their kids up.”\n\nDaniel Ryan, who plays John:\n\n“My ex-father-in-law was in a home with Alzheimer’s and I watched my ex-wife having to balance the love for her dad with having to deal with a complete stranger. He wasn’t the person that she’d grown up with. He’d turned into somebody else. And watching her go through the pain of that was something that attracted me to the story. A love story in many different ways. And a human story. That’s always the thing that certainly I want to watch when I switch on the telly.”\n\nJohn Fay, writer of the first film:\n\n“Old age is something that’s coming for all of us and there’s no getting away from it. It’s a universal theme.”\n\n“It’s Play For Today. That’s the beauty of this whole thing. Ten writers given carte blanche to write what they want to write. Long may that continue.”\n\nThe 2010 Moving On films with some of the leading cast members:\n\nMon Nov 1: Sauce For The Goose – Anna Massey, Susannah Harker, Daniel Ryan and Pooky Quesnel.

What follows is based on extensive research, interviews and published accounts.\n\n“Some scenes have been created for the purpose of dramatisation.”\n\nSo begins Appropriate Adult, ITV1’s two-part Fred West drama.\n\nOr rather the story of how trainee social worker Janet Leach was plunged into the nightmare world of serial killers Fred and Rose West.\n\nI watched both 90 minute instalments of the two-part production in one sitting earlier this month and was hugely impressed by the way it had been handled.\n\nIncluding the clarity of writer Neil McKay’s storytelling.\n\nThe performances of Emily Watson as Janet, Dominic West as Fred, Monica Dolan as Rose and several other fine cast members.\n\nNot least Robert Glenister as Det Supt John Bennett, Sylvestra Le Touzel as Det Con Hazel Savage and Anthony Flanagan as Janet’s partner Mike.\n\nAnd the way this tale of a chilling charmer’s evil influence on a well-intentioned mother has been so sensitively approached by all concerned.\n\nThere are many striking moments in the drama, which begins at 9pm on Sunday Sept 4 and concludes at the same time the following Sunday.\n\nSuch as Rose West sat at home in 25 Cromwell Street watching Neighbours on the TV as police arrive to search the house and garden.\n\nWhen Janet listens for the first time as Fred describes in a matter-of-fact way how he killed and disposed of his daughter Heather.\n\nPlus depraved and manipulative psychopath Fred West later describing confidante Janet as “a true soulmate”.\n\nI had high expectations of the award-winning TV team behind Appropriate Adult and was not disappointed.\n\nForget the knee-jerk predictable hysterical reaction to this project before filming had even begun.\n\nAnd applaud all involved for having the bravery and determination to bring this story to the screen.\n\nMy feature spread is in today’s MEN – and below – followed by some extra quotes from Emily Watson.\n\n**********************************************************************\n\n“WE’RE going on a journey together, Janet. And neither of us knows where it’s going to end.”\n\nSerial killer Fred West’s chilling words in controversial new TV drama Appropriate Adult, filmed in locations across Manchester and Salford.\n\nThe title refers to the woman who sat in on police interviews as West’s independent representative to safeguard his interests.\n\nTrainee social worker Janet Leach had never carried out the role before. When called in by police she thought it would be to help a delinquent 14-year-old boy. Instead she was plunged without warning into the nightmare world of depraved killers Fred and Rose West.\n\nA derelict house in Cardiff Street, Higher Broughton, was transformed into an astonishingly realistic location for the West’s infamous home at 25 Cromwell Street. The original property in Gloucester was demolished in the wake of their horrific crimes.\n\nOther locations include The Focus Building in Rowlands Way, Wythenshawe, which doubled for the interiors of both Gloucester Central Police station and Winson Green prison in Birmingham, where Fred hung himself on New Year’s Day 1995.\n\nWhile land at Cotebrook, Tarporley provided the TV location for fields near the village of Kempley where the remains of some of the victims were unearthed.\n\nOver the course of 20 years, Fred and Rose raped, tortured and murdered at least 12 young girls. The two-part film tells the story from the day of Fred’s arrest until his suicide.\n\nAward-winning Derbyshire writer and executive producer Neil McKay says the idea for Appropriate Adult was born during a conversation in a Manchester pub. It completes a TV trilogy following the acclaimed See No Evil: The Moors Murders and This Is Personal: The Hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper.\n\nNeil maintains this latest production is in the sensitive and responsible tradition of the previous dramas: “It is about the effects of the crimes rather than the crimes themselves.\n\n“Throughout the process we have kept those who suffered in the forefront of our mind. One of Fred’s daughters has spoken out against the drama and said she will not watch it. We believe that no-one has more more right than her to make her feelings known, We reiterate, however, that the drama is a sober and unsensational account of a story in which there is legitimate public interest.”\n\nHe adds: “Janet makes no claims to be a heroine. She admits to making many mistakes and misjudgements as her relationship with Fred West developed. But he was a profoundly evil man who contaminated almost everyone he came into contact with.”\n\nThe story is told through Janet’s eyes and show what happens when someone is exposed to extreme evil. Twice Oscar nominated actress Emily Watson plays mother-of-five Janet, who went on that extraordinary journey with Fred West.\n\nShe recalls filming at Salford’s re-creation of Cromwell Street. “It was horrible. You forget it was a family home with loads of children living there and all sorts of young people. If you absconded from social services, it was probably the first place to go because you could get drink, drugs, sex. It was very liberal, warm and friendly…supposedly.\n\n“They go to Cromwell Street because that’s what they did with the police interviews, so Fred could say, ‘Search there and there.’ But you don’t see any reconstruction of crimes or body parts or anything lurid in that way. There is a whole chasm of knowledge of what their crimes were, what they did. But we don’t go anywhere near that. And you wouldn’t want to know.”\n\nThe police interview scenes themselves were filmed in Wythenshawe. “It was claustrophobic in a tiny little room. There were four or five of us in those rooms and the two camera crews. And a lot of the interview scenes are verbatim.”\n\nEmily recalls being “knocked for six” by some of the interviews. “There were occasionally times where I was being filmed and the reaction – Janet being taken back, repulsed or upset – was suddenly my own.”\n\nThe Hour and The Wire star Dominic West plays Fred West, who is no relation, with Monica Dolan as Rose. It’s a shock to discover that Fred was a jolly charmer, especially when it came to women. But then that’s how he lured young girls to their eventual death.\n\nDominic hesitated when first asked to play his namesake. “I had to clear in my own mind the moral question of whether these monsters should be brought back into the public eye.”\n\nHe was eventually convinced by an article written by the sister of one of West’s victims. “Saying that this case should never be forgotten and that the problem, far from going away, is getting worse and that these things should be discussed.”\n\nFilming took place over seven weeks earlier this year with Dominic and Emily staying in a Manchester hotel with the rest of the cast.\n\nDominic believes he would not have been able to portray the killer if he had returned home to his wife and three children every night. “It would have been impossible. The acting would have suffered.”\n\nEmily met Janet before filming began. Now working in another profession, Janet gave her full co-operation to the drama, wanting the true story of her involvement to be told.\n\n“She’s very damaged by it because, despite the fact that she did a great service to the investigation, she was a catalyst for many of the revelations and discoveries. She’s very similar in looks to Fred’s first girlfriend and he was a complicated storyteller, actor – and a psychopath.\n\n“Any of us would struggle to cope with walking into that moral universe. She was a very vulnerable woman who went into this room with Fred West. He was a great recruiter of human beings. He was incredibly charming, funny, personable and very quickly she became the person to whom he would confess.”\n\nJanet had to treat everything Fred told her privately in confidence and not pass it on to anyone. He ensured she continued in the distressing role by promising to reveal just how many victims he and Rose had murdered.\n\nWest’s death meant she could finally tell police he had confessed that his wife had been involved in the killings. They had made a pact that he would take all the blame. And Janet could also inform detectives that Fred had said there were 20 more victims than had been thought – something Janet still believes to this day.\n\nShe collapsed after giving evidence at Rose’s trial, having perjured herself when denying she had a deal with a national newspaper. But Fred’s wife was later found guilty and went on to occupy a cell adjacent to Myra Hindley in Durham Prison. She remains behind bars serving a full life sentence.\n\nWriter Neil insists the TV team were right to make Appropriate Adult and that we can all learn something from it. “Our belief is that, responsibly made, such dramas can illuminate events which have cast a dark shadow not only individual lives but also our society as a whole.”\n\n*Appropriate Adult begins on ITV1 at 9pm on Sunday September 4 and concludes on Sept 11.\n\n**********************************************************************\n\nExtras:\n\nI met up with Emily Watson in London in June. Here is an edited selection of some of her other quotes during the round table interview:\n\nWho was Janet Leach?\n\n“I’d never heard of her. I think it’s a very unique insight and a totally new perspective on this story. She was completely not a professional. She’d had a few hours’ training. She was at the very beginning of the training to be a social worker.\n\n“And she put herself on a volunteer list to be an Appropriate Adult. The kind of job description is – you sit in on a police interview for minors who have learning difficulties. Unbeknownst to her, with Fred West arrested – because there was so much history with social services, everybody in social services had a conflict of interest. Usually they would have drawn somebody in from social services to do this job. So they went to a more remote list.\n\n“She’d never done it before. She got a phone call saying, ‘Come in today.’ And expected a 14-year-old delinquent boy. And it was Fred West. She had no idea what any of it was going to be. She wasn’t aware of what he was accused of. The first she heard of it was in the interview: ‘You are here today to discuss the murder of your daughter Heather.‘ Gulp.”\n\nYour research?\n\n“I didn’t go off and read all those lurid books. I wanted to approach the situation in the way that Janet did, in innocence, really. One of the producers had spent a lot of time with her and there were the hours and hours of interviews, a lot of detail about her involvement and her life and everything pertained to the case. So I had all that as my research material and a lot of material from the (Daily) Mirror, as well, because later in the story…she sort of got thrown off the case for various complicated reasons and she talked to the Mirror. And then came back on to the case and then, having been promised that she would never be called as a witness, was called as a witness in Rose’s trial, perjured herself in court, collapsed in court. She said, ‘I’ve never spoken to the Press.’ And she had. She collapsed in court.\n\n“It’s a very desperate, dramatic story because she was a very vulnerable woman who went into this room with Fred West. He was a great recruiter of human beings. He was incredibly charming, funny, personable and very quickly she became the person to whom he would confess. They’d leave her alone with him and then there would be a revelation. She became absolutely germane and a part of the investigation process. And if she wasn’t around, he would shut up.”\n\nDid a rapport develop?\n\n“Completely. It was a perfect storm, in a way, because of all her vulnerabilities and mistakes. She was clearly manipulated by him and very vulnerable to his manipulation. But had she not been that, we might never have known.”\n\nWas Janet consulted?\n\n“Yes, every step of the way. I met her…it’s very complex. She’s not a straightforward, heroic character. She’s not a bad person, she’s a good person. But she’s complicated and she makes mistakes. She’s very vulnerable and naive. It was a fantastic thing to have to play. And to interact with somebody of whom we, hopefully, none of us, have any knowledge. Somebody who has gone to the edge of depravity and beyond but still can sit in a room and make you feel like a million dollars. It was like a workface that I’ve never been to before in terms of acting experience. The psychology of interaction was like nothing…I’ve been to some quite strange places.”\n\nWhat did you want to ask her?\n\n“She’d had her life very much dissected and researched very thoroughly by the producers over a long period of time. She’s very good friends and close with one of the producers and had revealed a lot of information to him. So when I met her I didn’t really want to question her, I just wanted to have lunch with her and see where her centre of gravity was and what she was like. And I found her, despite all the vulnerabilties and screw ups, quite steely and quite strong in the middle of it all. She’s now in another profession entirely…she’s re-married, so she has a different name.”\n\n“I met her more than once. She doesn’t put herself in the public eye at all. We did have a slightly unfortunate moment – some member of the royal family arriving on the train at the station where I met her. She was a bit, ‘What?!’”\n\nDid she discuss Fred West’s suicide and the impact it had on her?\n\n“Yes. That’s a very important part of the story. After the investigation had finished and he’d been charged, he was in Winson Green Prison, he contacted her and said, ‘Will you come and see me?’ And she started visiting him in prison. So she stepped over a line, a boundary. Looking back on it, it was probably not the right thing to do. But at the time she felt…she maintains to this day that there are many, many more victims that we don’t know about. And that she was doing that to try and get to the truth. But…\n\n“I think it’s very complicated. I think she had good motives but she had been right at the heart of a massive story, an incredibly dramatic story that everybody in the country was talking about. And she was right there in the heart of it. And I think that’s very intoxicating and flattering. So there’s no easy, simple way to define shy she did what she did.\n\n“Also I think she was very reactive. It all happened very quickly. So he basically said to her in that situation, ‘There’s so much more to tell and I will tell you everything.’ And intimated an awful lot. And then killed himself. So she was left with that knowledge for the rest of her life. And she actually attempted suicide herself not long after that.”\n\nHow did she feel about having this very difficult time in her life dragged up again?\n\n“I don’t think she thinks it’s a walk in the park. But I think she feels it’s a good way to serve the story. I think she’s hoping that it will all go away after this. I think she feels from a personal point of view, the public perception of her was this woman who had perjured herself in court, collapsed in court. She was giving evidence against Rose and in court it came out that she had talked to the Mirror. So that is the public perception of her. And her role in the investigation is not known. So I think she feels that she could hold her head a bit higher. But she also hopes it will all go away and everyone will leave her alone.”\n\nDid she have any questions for you?\n\n“I think she was so not in any way media savvy or knew anything about how these things work. So not really, no. We had a laugh, really.”\n\nDo you feel a sense of responsibility because she’s a real person?\n\n“Oh God, yeah. Physically I’m not very like her. But I tried to have something of her bearing and her quality of being, in me.”\n\nHow intense were the police interview scenes to film?\n\n“We were filming for seven, eight minutes, they’re 10 page scenes. A lot of talking for Dominic. But it’s fascinating stuff because it’s so real. She’s mostly just listening. He was not at all straightforward and a lot of the time you don’t know whether he’s making it up. Janet said to me, if he got bored and he wanted to be in a different room he’d say, ‘Oh, I’ve got something to confess.’ And they’d go up to an interview room, which had a window, and he’s make up a whole false story. It’s real smoke and mirrors. He’s changing his story all the time. I think to this day we don’t really know.”\n\nHe thought Janet was a reincarnation of one of his victims?\n\n“She’s very similar in looks to his first girlfriend. He did all this stuff about being psychically connected to people. That was where he knew where the bodies were because he could feel them talking to him. And you just never really know if he’s just play acting or there’s something to it. He was just an incredibly complicated storyteller, actor, charming – and then suddenly you get to the edge of it and whoomf – evil bastard. Psychopath.”\n\nHow was it hearing those stories in his words?\n\n“It’s like he talking, ‘And then we went down the shops and we did this and it was really funny, because blah, blah, blah…’ But actually what he’s talking about is the practical details of how to dispose of his daughter’s corpse. It’s so bizarre, his delivery. It’s like you’ve walked around a corner into an Alice In Wonderland world of a different sort of human being where the rules are different. You can’t relate to it, you can’t understand it. And the more we researched and the more we did it, it just became more mystifying. It’s utterly fascinating. I think Dominic had tapes, had transcripts and stuff. There’s a lot of material that is obviously very carefully protected.”\n\nWhat do we see of Rose in this? More demonised at the time than Fred?\n\n“You don’t see that much of her. Because the story is Janet’s point of view and she was the Appropriate Adult for Fred, you don’t see Rose’s interviews. You see her from a distance. You see Janet’s perception of her which is completely terrifying. She’s a very malevolent presence in the film. But it only tries to approach her guilt from the point of view of Fred who is the one person who can really implicate her. So they really try and push him to say she was involved.”\n\nFred tried to protect Rose?\n\n“He did. Basically they made a pact. Unbelievably, the police gave them some time alone together when they were first arrested and they made a pact. He said, ‘You keep the family together, keep Cromwell Street going, keep all the kids together, and I’ll take the rap.’ But at that stage they probably thought it was only going to be Heather that they discovered.”\n\nWas there a guilt for Janet in finding him charming?\n\n“Yes. I think any of us would struggle to cope with walking into that moral universe. All the professionals involved in it went way past the remit of their professional experience and beyond, into a place that they couldn’t deal with. She was utterly naive, untrained. She had one really strong instinct, which was not to betray his confidence. Which is what the training for an Appropriate Adult is – if your client tells you something in confidence, you don’t betray it. She didn’t. And that was the reason he trusted her and he told her things. Because he would leak stories. He would say to his lawyer, to other police officers, he would tell them things and then it would turn up in the Press or somewhere. So he could work out who he could trust. And nothing he told her ever went any further. She would make him tell the police. So her attitude of trying to do the right thing, obey the rules and be a good person – her naivety – was a catalyst for finding out what had gone on.”\n\nWhy are we still intrigued by this story?\n\n“I think to know that they were living amongst us. They could have been your neighbour for 20 years and you didn’t know. Two human beings doing it together is quite unusual. Going to the edge of depravity and beyond and doing it amongst us. Not in some distant, evil, part of the world. But right here. You get off the train at Gloucester station and Cromwell Street is literally just round the corner. It’s right there in the middle of Gloucester, in one of our cities. How does that happen? How do people become that, be that? How does it work? It’s fascinating because we can’t understand it. But we have a duty to try.”\n\nControversy about this project. Worried that people will judge this before they see it?\n\n“They completely will make a judgement and everybody’s entitled to an opinion. And then they’ll watch it and I feel quite strongly that they will change them when they’ve seen it. There, of course, will be people who are not happy. It is very strong, painful, territory. And there are people who are still alive who are affected by it. And I’m respectful of that. But it’s an important subject and it’s been intelligently approached. That’s what drama does.”\n\nCan see the charmer in Dominic. How was it playing opposite him?\n\n“One of the things that the Press have said, ‘Oh my God, you’ve cast Dominic West.’ But actually Dominic is a sort of victim of his own success in a way. He’s a brilliant character actor. And he was the first person I thought of, because he looks like him. It’s really bizarre. He does. He’s very handsome and good-looking and all that. But there is something about him. And it wasn’t that much of a stretch for the make-up department to turn him into Fred West. And I think it’s a fascinating place for a character actor to go because it is so confusingly…he doesn’t walk around with a sign on his head saying, ‘I am evil,’ does he? He was a great recruiter of people.”\n\nAny initial qualms about taking the role?\n\n“My agent rang me and said, ‘They’re making a drama about the Wests.’ And I was like, ‘No.’ And then she said, ‘Read it. It’s brilliant.’ And then I read it. You revisit that story and it is horrific but utterly fascinating. I sat there for about 20 minutes. I’m glad I didn’t turn it down.”\n\nHas the role of Appropriate Adult now changed?\n\n“It has since this case. I think you now have to have a new Appropriate Adult every three days. It’s a much more carefully controlled situation to what it was then. I think anybody in this situation these days would be a lot more media savvy than she was because of the way the media has changed. Everybody is aware of those kind of issues in a way that back then they really weren’t. I think policing has changed a lot since this case. It was a massive watershed moment for policing as well.”\n\nOne particularly chilling scene in this that you could pick out?\n\n“I think hearing him talking. Walking in and hearing him talking about the cutting up and disposing of a body in the most matter of fact way, as if he’s gone down the shops to buy some bananas way. I never can quite get my head around that. It’s very shocking.”\n\nDoes she remember when the case first broke?\n\n“I was in my twenties and I remember it being utterly compelling, rivetting. Day after day new revelations. Really shocking.”\n\nThose initial reservations?\n\n“Really because of the horror of it. I’m quite instinctive in my responses to things. I worry about what people think later. But I just thought it was really good. I thought it was really intelligent, smart, interesting and engaging. No doubt provocative but worth it.”\n\nITV Appropriate Adult\n\nFred and Rose West: The Police Summary\n\nFollow Ian Wylie on Twitter"
