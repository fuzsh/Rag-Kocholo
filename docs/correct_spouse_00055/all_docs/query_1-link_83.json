        "text": "It’ll probably be hard for Hermione Norris to find a role that will top Ros Myers in Spooks, but this will do just fine.\n\nEven so, it’s odd to hear her calling someone “Sweetheart” in a telephone call.\n\nEven when she was in Cold Feet, she didn’t really do warm and nurturing, did she?\n\nIn this gripping two-parter, she plays Rosie, a divorced mum of two who’s remarried a widower with two teenage children of his own.\n\nSo far, so Brady Bunch, but this cosy family set-up is about to be ripped apart.\n\nA teenage girl from the kids’ school is murdered at the start of the episode – a nightmare scenario that quickly leaves Rosie wondering if one of her own family is somehow involved.\n\nIn an ideal world, I wouldn’t give away any more plot spoilers than that, but the title provides a big clue as to which one of her family it might be.\n\nPaul McGann and Martin Clunes star as Rosie’s husbands past and present, with Alexander Arnold as her son Jamie.\n\nTonight’s episode hinges on a pair of trainers that Jamie insists have been stolen.\n\nBut Rosie finds them stashed under his bed – and they’re covered in what might be blood.\n\nRos Myers would have known exactly what to do, but Rosie is torn, confused and desperate to protect her family.\n\nThe concluding part is on tomorrow night at 9pm.\n\nA Mother's Son, ITV1, 9pm\n\nSome episodes of New Tricks are so lacking in action they could almost be radio plays – and this is ­definitely one of them.\n\nThe first episode without James Bolam as Jack finds his colleagues Sandra, Gerry and Brian visiting a succession of people for what amounts to one long extended ­question and answer session.\n\nBones have been dug up in the grounds of a posh boarding school and the dead man is thought to be the school’s former PE teacher.\n\nHe was last seen five years ago, and it’s amazing so many people are able to remember precisely what they were doing and the ­conversations they were having the last time they saw him.\n\nSome people can even remember the conversations other people were having which is even more impressive.\n\nSusannah Harker guest stars as the school’s hoity-toity headmistress and former Spook Nicola Walker is a slightly shifty pastoral care teacher.\n\nEverybody is suspicious, but Brian thinks he’s onto something when he starts digging up the school’s ­financial records.\n\nNew Tricks, BBC1, 9pm\n\nThe chat-show host is at Battersea Dogs Home to highlight the work it does for unwanted pooches.\n\nYes, I know, Battersea is also a home for cats, but you’d never know it from this seven-part series.\n\nPaul O’Grady is a dog man, no question about it. He’s already got three of his own and it seems impossible he’ll get to the end of his visit without adding to his family.\n\n“Don’t let me have anything, no matter how much I beg!” he orders one of the staff.\n\nPaul says you see the best and worst of people at Battersea Dogs & Cats Home.\n\nTonight he sees just how cruel some people can be when a Staffie is brought in, so emaciated, that she must have been deliberately starved before being dumped in a park.\n\nBut the show scores high on the “Aaah” factor, too, as one puppy is so cute he’ll have viewers reaching for their phones to adopt."
