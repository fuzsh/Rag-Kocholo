        "text": "This article is written from the real world point of view.\n\nPaul McGann (born 14 November 1959 in Liverpool, England) is an English actor who made his name on the BBC serial The Monocled Mutineer, in which he played the lead role. He is also known for his role in Withnail and I, and for portraying the Eighth Doctor in the 1996 Doctor Who television movie and subsequent tie-in media.\n\nBiography[]\n\nChildhood[]\n\nPaul McGann was born in Liverpool, England in 1959 into a Roman Catholic family[citation needed]. His parents encouraged him and his siblings to develop their talents from an early age. McGann's talents were further developed when he attended grammar school in Liverpool. One of McGann's teachers advised him to enter the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and to pursue a career as an actor. Acting on his teacher's advice, McGann enrolled at the Royal Academy and went on to enjoy a successful acting career spanning over two decades.\n\nPaul McGann is the third of six children in the McGann family. His mother, Clare McGann, had twin boys, Joseph and John, who were born in 1958, but John died shortly after birth. Paul McGann has three younger siblings: Mark (born in 1961), Stephen (born in 1963) and Clare McGann (born in 1965). All three of his brothers are also actors and the four of them starred together (as four brothers) in the 1995 television TV serial The Hanging Gale about the Irish Famine. The same year he played the role as Grigori Potemkin in TV film \"Catherine The Great\", with Mark and Stephen too. These brothers also formed the pop quartet The McGanns, releasing the single \"Shame About the Boy\". McGann's sister, Clare, is a programme finance manager for Five.\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nIn 1992, McGann married Annie Milner, with whom he has two sons, Joe McGann (born in 1988) and Jake McGann (born in 1990).\n\nHe had a relationship with the actress Susannah Harker[1] beginning in 2003. They parted company at the end of 2008."
