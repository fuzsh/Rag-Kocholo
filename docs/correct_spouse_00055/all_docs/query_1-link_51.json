        "text": "Joe Riley speaks to Liverpool actor Paul McGann about a very special movie reunion\n\nTWENTY years on from the ultimate British buddy movie of the 80s, two actors, still good friends, are back on screen – more by accident than design.\n\nLiverpool’s Paul McGann – one of the now famous quartet of thespian brothers from Kensington – is reunited with Richard E Grant, his co-star in Withnail and I, the everyday tale of two out of work theatricals who take refuge in the Lake District.\n\nBut this time their characters are sworn enemies involved in a power struggle.\n\nAlways Crashing In The Same Car is a 20-minute short in the final of the eighth Turner Classic Movies competition, the winner to be announced next Wednesday.\n\nThere are no big bucks involved: McGann and Grant spent just a week filming in London. They have only one scene together.\n\nThe other speaking part is for Paul McGann’s real-life partner Susannah Harker (House Of Cards) who ironically plays Grant’s missus.\n\nHow neat it would be to claim this as a designer anniversary present for Withnail and I.\n\n“It would have been poetic if it had fallen like that. But, in fact, it came about almost by accident,” reveals Paul.\n\n“I bumped into Duncan Wellaway (director of the short) at a film festival in France.\n\n“A week later he sent me the script which I thought was outstanding.”\n\nBut it was “weeks and weeks” later, after several optioned actors had fallen by the wayside, that Paul had the idea of giving his old mate Richard E Grant a ring.\n\n“Duncan said: ‘I’m glad YOU thought of that ... I was afraid to ask’.”\n\nAnd so, by chance, one of British cinema’s enduring duos were back in the frame – together.\n\nNo longer tousle-haired post-student types, but older, wiser, fiercer.\n\nIn some shorts Grant looks like a sibling of veteran actor Patrick McGoohan.\n\nPaul – required to grow a beard for the first time – looks, at his own suggestion, “not unlike Gerry Adams”.\n\nBut there is enduring affection for the Withnail phenomenon, even if history needs a bit of tidying up.\n\n“Video and DVDs made Withnail’s reputation.When it first came out it wasn’t a hit at the flicks,” says Paul.\n\n“It was only five, six and seven years later that it began to pick up its reputation.”\n\nPaul McGann and Richard E Grant saw it again only recently at a British Film Institute screening for die-hard fans who recall every scene, every word.\n\n“Given the distance, we were able to see it as a picture (rather than a piece of work).”\n\nBut what is the secret of Withnail’s now evergreen epic status?\n\n“It’s really good, and that helps,” says Paul (why be modest when the proof is all around you?).\n\n“Also, most people have probably had an episode in their life like that.\n\n“Those kids who went from Liverpool down to London, or anyone who leaves home for university around 18, 19 or 20, and has spent time sharing a house, living with mates.\n\n“It’s an experience so many can identify with.\n\n“I’ve got teenage sons now – Joe and Jake – and when their mates got into Withnail, around 15 or 16, suddenly I was cool dad.\n\n“Now it’s seen as a rights of passage movie.\n\n“But you don’t set out to make an iconic film.\n\n“What achieves that is the reception it gets.”\n\nWithnail – in which Paul McGann played the ‘I’ character, Marwood – was an undoubted springboard for the Liverpool actor.\n\nWhile big screen recognition may have been delayed, at the same time as the shoot, Paul McGann was making waves starring in Alan Bleasdale’s television series, The Monacled Mutineer.\n\nNow 47, his career has enjoyed consistent small screen exposure, the most recent being this summer’s Debbie Horsfield BBC drama True Dare Kiss, an entertaining tale of intrigue, passion, revenge and redemption, in which Paul played alongside Pooky Quesnel and Dervla Kirwan.\n\n“I bet like everyone else, you couldn't make head nor tail of it,” he laughs.\n\nMcGann is not a precious actor, more than ready to be honest when some things don’t work out.\n\nSuch, he admits, was his 1996 American feature-length pilot as Doctor Who.\n\n“They tried to get the thing going in the US. So we made it in Canada and they showed it on Fox.\n\n“It never got picked up for a series. So I was Doctor Who for just six weeks.\n\n“But, note, I never wore the scarf. I eschewed the scarf.”\n\nHe said his role as the time lord ended “because I was never invited, in order to be tempted back.\n\n“The phone stayed conspicuously silent.\n\n“When they did it again on British telly, why would they go back to what was considered a failure?\n\n“You can understand them wanting to move on.”\n\nPaul McGann certainly did.\n\nAnd although, these days, he calls Withnail “ancient history” there is still obvious affection for the old warhorse.\n\nTo view Paul and Richard’s new short movie go to www.tcmclassicshorts.com or tune into TCM (available on most formats) on November 3/4 from 11pm."
