        "text": "Susannah Harker is deep in conversation with her French director Marianne Badrichani when I arrive. As Badrichani gets up, Harker implores her not to go. 'I may not know what to say,' she says, semi-despairingly, before conceding defeat. 'But you'll be nice to me,' she says, turning to me. 'Won't you?'\n\nIt's rather unexpected that an actress with such on-screen poise as Susannah Harker should come across as a little insecure in person. It's only an initial thing: soon, she is warm, enthusiastic and just a little luvvy-ish, complimenting me on my necklace, overjoyed I've read the script for her new play, eager to talk.\n\nIt transpires that today is the first day of rehearsal for The Little Black Book, an unusual two-hander by the French playwright Jean-Claude Carriere, in which she stars with Paul McGann. They haven't even done a read-through yet - some actors hate talking about a project before they feel fully acquainted with it. Maybe it's a spot of first-day-at-school nerves.\n\nNever an actress to appear in public in a backless frock, as she puts it, Harker nonetheless seems to have been away from the spotlight for some time. She made her name in TV; first as the reporter Mattie Storin in House Of Cards and then as the pious Jane Bennett in Andrew Davies's adaptation of Pride And Prejudice. The two roles were sufficiently big and different to establish her profile as a household actress without pigeonholing her.\n\nRecently, though, she has returned to the theatre - 'my home' as she calls it. She was on tour with Corin Redgrave in another play, The Browning Version, due in the West End later this year, when her agent put her up for The Little Black Book.\n\nA hit in Europe, it has never been performed in the UK. Harker plays Suzanne, an enigmatic stranger who wanders into Jean-Jacques's flat and - intrigued by the book he keeps with the names of the women he has slept with - refuses to leave. Their relationship becomes a cat-and-mouse exploration into the meaning of love.\n\nIt's an ideal play for Harker who, for all her bubbly theatricality, has something inscrutable about her and admits to being fascinated by psychology. 'As I get older, I've become more interested in human behaviour and motivation,' she says. 'I'm convinced acting is 80 per cent psychology and 20 per cent technique, and perhaps a bit of talent.' 'As I get older' are words Harker uses a lot. As is 'inspiration'. 'I only do work that inspires me, work I connect with,' she says. 'Having a child [she has a son, Finlay, with the actor Iain Glen; the couple have since separated] certainly helps you focus on what you want to do. You have to be able to smell a part to want to do it.'\n\nIncreasingly, these 'inspirations' have been in the theatre rather than TV. 'TV has shifted radically in the last few years, thanks to the rise of reality TV and celebrity culture,' she says. 'More and more actors are moving into theatre in search of stimulation, whereas a decade ago it was the other way round. Although don't print that,' she laughs. 'I'll never work in TV again.'\n\nShe is quick to draw a line between her private life and her professional one, perhaps because her split from Glen was quite public: he had appeared with Nicole Kidman in The Blue Room and there were rumours that the friendship had had an impact on the marriage. 'I hide myself behind my job - that's partly why I do it,' she says. 'There should always be a line between oneself as an actor and as a person.'\n\nBut she agrees that acting is just as much about accessing the parts of herself other jobs can't reach as it is about inhabiting the life of a stranger. 'Basically, it's all a learning curve,' she says extravagantly, but genuinely. 'I've no idea what I'll learn from this play, but I certainly know I'll learn something.'\n\nIn 1998, the Petit-Hebertot theatre company in France put on Harold Pinter's Dumb Waiter: in French for the first half of the week, in English for the second. The English production was so popular with the French that the run was extended for three weeks.\n\nTom Stoppard made history when his play Arcadia became the first work by a non-French playwright to be staged at France's national theatre, the Comedie Fran√Éaise, in 1998 after the lifting of a ban on work by foreign playwrights. However, Stoppard admitted that he couldn't quite follow the French-language production."
