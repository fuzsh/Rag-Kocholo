        "text": "The 51-year-old actress has come a long way since her days as the period drama heroine, who ended up getting married to the dashing Mr Bingley, played by Crispin Bonham-Carter.\n\nThe Andrew Davies adaptation of the Jane Austen classic is thought by many fans to be one of the most definitive screen versions of the novel, and famously left a nation swooning thanks to Colin Firth’s Mr Darcy and his wet shirt.\n\nIn a recent interview with news.com.au, Susannah explained: “Even though we knew it was special, it was still a surprise that it had the impact it did, as broad as it did and for as long as it did.”\n\nShe went on to say: “I think that took us by surprise, as it would anyone. You can never truly guess that.”\n\nWhile Susannah is well-known for playing Jane Bennet in the epic costume drama, she is well-known for portraying naive journalist Mattie Storin in the original television series of House of Cards.\n\nThe role - played by Kate Mara in the US Netflix version - saw her character having an affair with scheming politician Francis Urquhart, who manipulated her for his own ends.\n\nSusannah ended up getting a BAFTA TV nod for her performance in the show in 1990, before she took on the part of Jane.\n\nFollowing her success in House of Cards and Pride and Prejudice, Susannah went on to star in police thriller Heat of the Sun opposite Trevor Eve.\n\nShe also featured another police procedural Ultraviolet, which saw her joining a cast that included Idris Elba and Jack Davenport.\n\nSince then she has had stream of roles over the years in various dramas, such as Waking the Dead, Midsomer Murders and New Tricks.\n\nIt looks like the actress has focused more on the stage recently, and earlier this year Susannah starred as Amanda in a production of Tennessee Williams’ The Glass Menagerie at the Nottingham Playhouse."
