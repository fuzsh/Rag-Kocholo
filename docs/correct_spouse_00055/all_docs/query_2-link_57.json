Highly Recommended\"\n\n- The List ( selected for the ‘Hit’ list)\n\n\"Among the frothy romcoms of prosperous Ireland one gritty film stands out.\"\n\n-Times Online\n\n\"Astoundingly assured and bleakly comic debut from former commercials director Lenny Abrahamson, Adam and Paul follows the two sweaty strung-out eponymous junkies (rigorously played by writer Mark O'Halloran and Tom Murphy) as they scour the grim-grey underbelly of Dublin city for a life-saving fix. Along the way they bicker, they vomit, they go hungry, they make some inept attempts at robbery, meet some friends, avoid some hostile pushers, and finally, at the 11th hour, score two hefty bags of seemingly heaven-sent heroin. And though the movie's dark comedic tone is initially disorienting (Loachian social realism with extra slapstick - watch out for the football Paul!) the narrative slowly reveals its own appropriately woozy rhythms, like a loosely assembled set of 'desperate junkie' gags that loudly reference everything from Laurel & Hardy to Midnight Cowboy to Beckett. While the subtle genius of the movie is that it humanizes two unsympathetic and marginalized protagonists through the use of sly humour rather than didactic social commentary.\n\n- UNCUT ★★★★\n\n\"bright acting, smart script...both funny and moving\"\n\n- Daily Star (7/10 stars)\n\n\"It's a bloody funny buddy movie\"\n\n- Metro ★★★★ (3rd best film of the week in the Critics Top 10)\n\n\"if the British authorities had any sense, A&P would be screened in schools...A grown up's film\"\n\n- Daily Mail\n\n\"...quite easily the best film to cross the Irish sea...It is a striking film, a magnificent achievement in imagery and performance; I didn't want it to end.

Though around them a criminal world seethes, Julie and Antonio are a young and loving couple with a new baby and a solid, white-collar sense of stability. But when a loose social connection suddenly ties them to a major political assassination, the two become innocents desperately trying to adapt to a world of murderous politicians and police that, moment to moment, threatens their lives.\n\nStarring Bruno Bichir, Lorraine Pilkington, Jesus Ochoa, Adam Kotz, Alvaro Guerrero, Rodrigo Murray, Emma Cunniffe and Reece Dinsdale.\n\nReviews\n\n\"A terrific political thriller\"\n\n- Film Review, ★★★★\n\n\"With a willingness to boldly tell it like it is, this edgy and riveting political thriller digs deeply into corruption while telling an intensely personal story. It’s powerful, harrowing and startlingly important. As Mexican and UK officials engage in illicit dealings, a Mexico City artist Antonio (Bichir) innocently buys land from a dodgy salesman called Chubby (Cobos). But Chubby’s involved in a political assassination, and the Mexican secret police, in search of a scapegoat, exploit the link to Antonio. A friend helps him flee to London, but his British wife Julie (Pilkington) and infant daughter are secretly imprisoned by the chief investigator (Ochoa). Meanwhile, Antonio is trying to find help in London, not realising that Julie’s ex (Kotz) is actually an MI5 agent. Writer-director Suarez kicks off the film at full speed with a bewildering array of politicians, thugs and innocent bystanders thrown into a stew of corruption, torture, murder and fear. It’s thoroughly terrifying to contemplate how we’d react in the same situations. This is a story of everyday people unwittingly caught up in a massive conspiracy from which there seems to be no escape. The people in power can do whatever they like, while those who elected them are defenceless. There’s an edgy, relentless urgency to the filmmaking style that refuses to play it safe. Even a few badly contrived plot points can’t undermine the film’s bold story and unflinching themes. It helps that the script is extremely realistic, with actors who deliver raw, gritty performances. It’s also especially well edited, cutting between the various story threads to keep us utterly gripped to each element of the plot. (The title refers to one of Antonio’s paintings.) Reminiscent of Traffic or Syriana, this film touches on all aspects of government corruption, dodgy arms deals, drug money, black market babies, secret prisons and the mistreatment of political prisoners. It also bravely challenges our belief that these things can’t possibly happen in a 'civilised society', even if it’s the UK’s legal system that ultimately comes to the rescue. Despite its flaws, this is an important, courageous movie.\" 4 stars BBC Radio 5 Live \"Gripping political drama of the first order\"\n\n- James Cameron-Wilson, TwentyFour7\n\n\"Set in a murky world of corruption in Mexico, this dark thriller sees naive, young Antonio accidentally implicate himself and his family in an assassination. Having fled to the UK, Antonio (Bruno Bichir) desperately tries to prove his innocence while his wife Julie and their child find themselves captured by the crooked chief of police. Although the UK scenes are the stuff of your bog-standard drama, the prison scenes with Julie (a superb performance from Lorraine Pilkington) are incredibly well executed, and so unbearably tense that they turn this into a completely absorbing story.

An intriguing study of unresolved grief, Frozen is serious, mannered, rich in theme, achingly beautiful, with nuanced performances and a strong sense of place. In other words, the film's director-co-writer Juliet McKoen may be a newcomer, but she arrives with a talent that is already fully formed.\"\n\n- Channel 4\n\n“For those of us in professional despair about the future of British cinema, there was precious little to gripe about. Juliet McKoen’s ghost story, Frozen, is a brave choice. It gives Shirley Henderson, so often the viola player in a string quartet, the chance to show how haunting she can be as a lead. In McKoen’s subtle hands Frozen becomes a poem about the limbo of not-knowing; of not being able to grieve for a loved one who keeps calling in dreams; and how this appalling ache reshapes the place where you live and the people you grow up with. It is also an exceedingly topical film about how horror is becalmed.\"\n\n- The Times\n\n\"Powerful...disturbing...heartrending” - The Metro\n\n\"...a cracking debut, with a shoal of red herrings that keep us guessing to the last.\"\n\n- Newcastle Sunday Sun\n\n\"Laden with promise and thick with atmosphere.\"\n\n- Sight and Sound\n\n\"In McKoen's subtle hands Frozen becomes a poem about the limbo of not-knowing; of not being able to grieve for a loved one who keeps calling in dreams; and how this appalling ache reshapes the place where you live and the people you grow up with.\"\n\n- The Times\n\n\"An eerie atmosphere and a stunning performance from Shirley Henderson as childishly seductive Kath - not to mention a killer ending.\" - Empire\n\n\"An almost unclassifiable mixture of mystery yarn, supernatural story and character study, Frozen has an ambition and originality that has become all too rare in British cinema.\"\n\n- Scotland on Sunday\n\n\"A surreal and evocative tale.

Meanwhile, McKoen captures it with a real eye for beauty each frame looks like a work of art, using the coastline as another character in the story. As the mystery deepens, McKoen draws us in, revealing the characters slowly enough that we never get ahead of Kath in her quest and adding an ethereal parallel layer in Kath's fantasies.\"\n\n- Rich Cline, Shadows on the Wall\n\n“This well crafted film sees the first true lead role for this excellent, versatile and omnipresent Scottish actress. McKoen makes much photographically of the grim mud flats and decaying industry of this north-western corner.”\n\n- Time Out London (DVD of the week.)\n\n“Henderson's performance is childlike and her seeming innocence increases our fears for her wellbeing. In contrast, Roshan Seth is the very essence of stillness and maturity in what is an excellent performance. McKoen shows a skill for finding the heart of a place, for pinpointing the mood and it is a beautifully stark film.

It’s because people are frightened to find out the full power of the mind.”\n\n- Jimi Hendrix\n\nDirector’s Statement\n\nReverb originally grew out of my fascination with the stories and myths in the music business. In particular the myth of a record with a hidden sound buried beneath a normal recording. Rock ‘n’ roll is this amazing fusion of characters who often create their best music out of intense, passionate conflicts. Music is primal; it taps directly into our emotions; it is used in the occult and to enhance altered states. I’d often heard artists talk about their music as if they weren’t in control of it, as if it came from a supernatural place outside of themselves. It started me thinking: what if the thing talking to them was evil? From these ideas Mark Griffin was born. He embodies for me the dark collision of rock ‘n’ roll and occultism that was spawned in the late Sixties. Hendrix sang Voodoo Child and the Rolling Stones became Their Satanic Majesties, the Beach Boys recorded Charles Manson songs, Jimmy Page wrote scores for avant-garde films like Lucifer Rising and Aleister Crowley appeared on the cover of the Sgt. Pepper album. What was fascinating about Mark Griffin is that, as I created his ‘lost recordings’ and avant-garde films, he grew organically into the film. As Alex taps into him (or as he taps into Alex), and as the past and present become fused, Griffin’s presence is drawn more and more into the visual language of the film. I knew that I wanted to create a thriller. I’ve always loved Coppola’s The Conversation and the film that inspired it: Antonioni’s Blow Up. In Reverb I want each of the sound fragments and videos to make up ambiguous pieces in a jigsaw puzzle, I trust the audience to build the story and paint images in their own minds. No one knows the ‘truth’ behind supernatural events, we each create our own explanation of what ghosts might be. For me, fear exists in that gap of understanding. Imagine you wake in the middle of the night to a strange sound in your house. The most terrifying moment is the silence of those first minutes when we don’t know what might be waiting for us. My desire was to make a film that uses tension and suspense to unsettle. I’ve always loved the Seventies films of Polanski and Argento. At times they develop such a powerful atmosphere of menace that they become waking nightmares. Most horror films scare you because they show the characters reaction to jeopardy. I wanted to go further, to let the audience experience the chaos and disorientation that I imagine having a terrifying supernatural experience is like. It’s not logical or comprehensible, on the contrary, it’s terrifying precisely because you’re in the grip of something overwhelming and unknowable. It should be as visceral and emotional as being at a music gig.

He is hated by his son and abused by local youths. The death of his wife leaves Jack lost and alone in his self loathing. Hope arrives in the unlikely form of eight year old, Florrie, when she moves in next door and delights in Jack's neglected racing pigeons, unwittingly rekindling his own love for the birds. When his glamorous French neighbour, Stephanie (Josiane Balasko) takes pity on him, Jack cannot help but fall for her charms. When gradually his innocent friendship with Florrie is thrown into question when the girl goes missing and Stephanie reveals a well kept secret, Jack's life is thrown into turmoil.\n\nStarring Bob Hoskins, Josiane Balasko, Jody Latham, Josef Altin and Jessica Stewart.\n\nReviews\n\n\"A fine example of micro-budget indigenous film-making, Ruby Blue sees director Jan Dunn build on the success of 2006's Gypo with another low-key story set on the Kent coast. Dispensing with that flick's Dogme 95 trappings, Ruby tells of a pigeon-racing widower (Hoskins) whose budding romance with his new French neighbour (Balasko) is imperilled when his relationship with a young girl (Jessica Stewart) is misconstrued. Modest, thoughtful and gently humorous, it's a home-grown gem that's worth seeking out. Dunn's blend of the scripted and the improvised inevitably invites comparisons with Mike Leigh, as does her focus on what she has called ‘the harsh reality of lower-class suburban isolation.’ In reality, though, Ruby is far more tightly scripted than Leigh's oeuvre, revolving as it does around one key revelation and a certain amount of rather unlikely contrivance. It also feels noticeably less caricatured, although that is as much down to Hoskins and Balasko's well-rounded and heartfelt performances as it is to the director's pensive and compassionate screenplay.”\n\n- POIGNANT CHARACTER STUDY\n\nOkay, so the slightly dour visuals won't make you put Thanet on your list of potential vacation spots, while the ending feels a little too neat and cosy given all the trials that Hoskins' character is forced to endure. On the whole, though, this poignant character study is a real find that deserves a much wider release than the small art house roll-out.. Kudos, too, to KT Tunstall for giving the project a pair of tracks for its opening and closing titles.\"\n\n- BBC Movies online, ★★★★\n\n\"Bittersweet to the core, Ruby Blue is director Jan Dunn's follow-up to Gypo. Hoskins is pigeon trainer Jack, a depressed widower who finds solace in the company of 8 year-old neighbour Florrie. Hunted by the narrow-minded community who fail to see the innocence in their bond, Jack builds a relationship with the mysterious Stephanie (Balasko), which is in turn threatened by a secret he finds hard to accept. The strong, understated cast, including the promising Jody Latham as wayward teen Ian, makes this slow building story into a personal and occasionally heart-rending piece of film. Far from seeming creepy or inappropriate, Jack's friendships with Florrie and Ian give hope against a backdrop of mob mentality and degrading social values. The naturalistic script gave a sense of realism, but the odd use of incidental music is distracting at times. Verdict: A hard hitting but hopeful British drama with a pared down performance from Bob Hoskins.\"\n\n- Empire Magazine\n\n\"A warmly human story about loneliness, love and life in the raw\"\n\n- Evening Standard\n\n2006 cert 15, running time 90 minutes\n\nDirector: Nial Heery\n\nSet around a small fraternity of blue collar forestry workers, Small Engine Repair is the story of a group of men going nowhere.

There, she promptly falls foul of some of the more dubious nuns, but the progressive Novice Sister (Brenda Blethyn) sees potential in the new postulant, especially when Joanna is faced with some trying personal matters. The fine cast also includes Susannah York and Rita Tushingham, plus Corin Redgrave making one of his last appearances as a bishop with a guilty secret. It may occasionally veer a touch too brusquely from gentle comedy to soap operatics, but this is still an entertaining and thoughtful insight into the effect that human frailty can have on even the strongest faith.\"\n\n- Radio Times\n\n\"We’re a nun-obsessed society, it seems from The Sound of Music and Sister Act on stage to Doubt infiltrating last year’s Oscar nominations, the wimples are everywhere.

Newcomer Emily Beecham plays a young woman determined to take the veil and holds her own well against such stalwarts as Brenda Blethyn and Susannah York. The reservations of her friends and family are sensitively tackled without taking sides, and the nuns are a (slightly predictably) quirky bunch. Their dry humour and lack of tact help to offset the more fraught moments. It never loses the feeling of being a gentle film, despite the rate at which it racks up deaths and dilemmas.

Number three in TIME OUT's critics top ten films.\n\nStarring William Beck, Elaine Cassidy, Stephen Lord, Elizabeth McGovern, Lea Mornar, Rachael Stirling, Zoe Telford and Karl Theobald.\n\nReviews\n\n“We've seen quite a few British comedies this year which confirm the dictum that you can never make a good film out of a bad script. The Truth didn't have that problem. Skilfully balancing black comedy with a murder-mystery (yes, you read right), George Milton's Highlands-set movie had some of the funniest scenes we saw all year. It also lacerated political correctness and group therapy with the precision of a surgeon. Did we mention that this film didn't get the audience it deserved either? Voted in Best 10 UK films 2006, BBC Film Network. Dark British comedy set in a rural self-help retreat. It gets strange in parts, but is almost consistently funny. A low-budget indie that deserves to be seen. London Lite '\"Irony has no place in this room,\" advises Donna Shuck (Elizabeth McGovern), as she welcomes a new group of variously needy individuals who've signed up for her seven-step programme, 'Adventures in Truth'. No place at Serenity Lodge in the remote Highlands, perhaps, but irony is plentiful in Milton's low-budget but highly satisfying, slyly intelligent UK indie. An inevitably motley crew gathers to confront the truth about themselves (and, of course, each other): feisty wheelchair-user Candy (Elaine Cassidy), bankrupt dotcom queen Martha, sensitive Spud, predatory letch Felix, nurse-turned-dominatrix Blossom, muso Scott, and Croatian Mia, whom Donna allows into therapy sessions in return for cooking and house-cleaning. Cue, just as inevitably given the way such movie gatherings go, an accelerating spiral of spiteful lies and recriminations, as the shared oath to tell the truth and nothing but takes its toll. 'Nothing else is inevitable, however, in this engagingly fresh take on a subgenre of potentially slim pickings. With consistently interesting plot twists and shifts in power between the uncertainly allied characters, the film's a real rollercoaster, alternating deliciously deadpan humour with serious insights, deft satire with dark suspense, and even managing to succeed, here and there, in several different tonal registers at once. Though it may seem clear where Milton's sympathy lies, he keeps pulling the rug from under our feet, so we're never quite sure whether we're watching a mystery thriller, a sophisticated parody or a wry comment on our capacity to turn ethics into whatever's expedient. Only at the end are we left with any certainty: the truth is dead. Long live the truth!”\n\n- Geoff Andrew, Time Out\n\n“Believe me.

Divided, like Donna's programme, into seven discrete sections (or 'steps'), it begins as a hilarious spoof of contemporary confessional culture, then stumbles upon the seemingly different generic territory of the murder mystery, before finally, like its characters, losing the plot altogether, or at least concealing it beneath a layer of self-deluding spiritualist bromides. Any or all of Candy's fellows could be the killer, but by the end, the truth behind Mia's death has become a casualty of their faddish relativism, and Candy must learn to go along with the group's self-serving psychosis if she is to keep her head above water. The result is a mix of black comedy, horror, mystery and suspense, where any notion of 'the truth' is rapidly replaced by the players' collective fictions and the film's overarching cynicism. 'These shifts in genre are skillfully modulated by Elaine Cassidy, as she navigates the heroine's journey from initial rebellion to Hitchcockian suspicion and terror, and finally to half-hearted surrender. Elizabeth McGovern's endless stream of psychobabble gives the film its most memorable lines, while the supporting cast, familiar for the most part from British television, all expertly manage the switch from absurd and apparently harmless narcissism to something altogether more sinister and dangerous. 'Mornar's Mia is the only teller of truths at Serenity Lodge, and as such she represents the group's troubled conscience. Bury that, this film suggests, and you can convince yourself of the truth of anything, no matter how preposterous. It is, in this age of postmodernity, a hard lesson for us all - but also, thankfully, a very funny one.' Verdict: 'Counterbalancing a small budget with big ideas, The Truth darkly satirises the moral blindness of relativism without ever forgetting to surprise or amuse.”\n\n- Film Four\n\n“Good and nasty British dark comedy about a group of self-absorbed idiots who go on a retreat and have an even worse time than you would imagine.”\n\n- New\n\n“Black humour and some witty observations of human foibles.”\n\n- Boys Toys\n\n“THE TRUTH is a perky British low budgeter ...Is it a parable about US cinema's dominance over British film culture.
