The motivations informing the production and consumption of adaptations may seem intent on replication but, as the chapters in this collection demonstrate, every ‘return’ is inevitably transformative of its object – whether that object be the original text or the memory of its first encounter. A film or television adaptation of a prior cultural text – no matter how ‘faithful’ in intention or aesthetic – is inevitably an interpretation of that text: to this extent, every adaptation is an instance of textual infidelity. Adaptation in Contemporary Culture considers adaptation not only as a significant film and television genre, but also as a cultural practice which exemplifies key trends in postmodern culture. The diversity of texts explored in this collection is indicative of an attempt to reconfigure the ways in which adaptation is conceptualized by considering it within an extended range of generic, critical and theoretical contexts: literary, film, television and other visual texts are examined both as ‘origins’ and ‘adaptations’, and new insights are offered into the construction of genres, canons and ‘classics’. Adaptation in Contemporary Culture aims to expand the range of texts considered under the rubric of ‘adaptation’: adaptations of both ‘classic’ and contemporary texts by British and American authors – from Jane Austen, Edgar Allen Poe and Charles Dickens to Bret Easton Ellis, P. D. James and Sarah Waters – are analysed alongside film remakes, video games, biopics, fan fiction and celebrity culture. Key critical paradigms for adaptation studies – fidelity, intertextuality, historicity and authorship – provide the conceptual focus for each section of the collection. Fidelity, as a contested concept, has proved a defining concern for adaptation studies. Part I: Remaking Fidelity revisits the critical and theoretical issues implicit in the assumption that a media adaptation should be judged by its faithfulness to a literary original. Fidelity is taken out of its more familiar context – the film and television adaptation of the classic literary text – and considered within an expanded field of adaptation, including the theatrical adaptation and the film remake. The subjective investments and productive\n\n2\n\nADAPTATION IN CONTEMPORARY CULTURE\n\npotential of fidelity as a mode of cultural engagement are examined, with the figure of the ‘fan’ emerging as a significant cultural agent. The traditional focus on adaptation as a ‘page to screen’ process tends to privilege the literary origin. Part II: After-images emphasizes the significance of visual contexts when considering adaptation. The diversity of transmedia intertextuality is explored with reference to the genre film remake, photography, animation and the video game. Adaptations of classic texts enable contemporary audiences to revisit the past; as such they can be situated within the broader context of postmodern appropriations of history. Part III: Reproducing the Past, adaptations are situated within historical and theoretical frameworks, including queer theory and critical whiteness studies, which enable a critical interrogation of the ‘reproductive’ work of adaptation. Issues of origin and authorship have been recurring concerns within adaptation studies. Part IV: Afterlives explores the incorporation of authors – as literary ‘properties’ or celebrities – into the culture of adaptation. Deference to the authorial signature is one way in which the ‘faithful’ adaptation has traditionally announced itself; here the figure of the author becomes the object of adaptation. In this final section, questions of fidelity are examined in relation to ‘reauthorship’, the biopic and celebrity culture.\n\nRemaking Fidelity In ‘Heavy bodies, fragile texts: stage adaptation and the problem of presence’, Frances Babbage explores Punchdrunk Theatre’s ‘promenade’ performance of Edgar Allen Poe’s short stories, entitled The Masque of the Red Death. This production is considered within the context of theatrical literary adaptation more broadly, with Bram Stoker’s Dracula providing an illustrative case study of the challenges of adaptation for the stage. Dispensing with the traditions of realism which prevail in so many film and television adaptations, The Masque of the Red Death enacts a ‘live encounter’ with the source text/s which is inevitably fragmented and uniquely subjective. Arguing against the repression of subjective response as ‘academically unbecoming’, Babbage examines this innovative instance of adaptation as providing a space for the participant’s memories of the original to be revisited and renewed. While The Masque of the Red Death departs radically from the (realist) representational strategies of fidelity, Gus van Sant’s 1998 film Psycho demonstrates a fidelity to Hitchcock’s 1960 original which some viewers and critics found perverse. In ‘Reflections on the surface: remaking the postmodern with van Sant’s Psycho’, Catherine Constable examines the contradictions inherent in the critical denunciation of van Sant’s film; her analysis of the film’s production and reception reveals the complexity of fidelity as a\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nmode of adaptation practice, and the paradoxes of fidelity as a critical criterion. Through close attention to the relationship between van Sant’s film and its multiple ‘originals’ – the film, the screenplay and the shooting script – Constable demonstrates how the self-reflexivity of the 1998 Psycho is productive of new meanings. Analogies between the remake and the adaptation are also the concern of ‘Affecting fidelity: adaptation, fidelity and affect in Todd Haynes’s Far From Heaven’, in which Rachel Carroll reflects on the critical recuperation of these once-compromised film and television genres. Haynes’s 2002 film Far From Heaven – a homage to Douglas Sirk’s 1955 melodrama All That Heaven Allows – offers another instance of ‘perverse fidelity’, albeit one which met with a more favourable reception. Consideration of the affective dimension of fidelity in relation to a gendered film genre – the ‘women’s picture’ – is here employed to question the ritual renunciation of fidelity as a ‘critically suspect sentiment’. Intertextual allusion is a cinematic practice entirely in keeping with van Sant and Haynes’s auteur status, and yet the degree of fidelity exhibited by their unconventional film remakes seems more akin to the sentiments associated with fandom. In ‘The folding text: Doctor Who, adaptation and fan fiction’, Christopher Marlow notes how the 2005 revival of the BBC’s long-running and highly popular science-fiction drama witnessed the passage of some significant ‘fans’ into positions of authorial power. Marlow demonstrates how issues of ‘canon’ and authorship, in relation to cult texts and their audiences, have been transformed by the proliferation of fan fiction as hosted by new media platforms. Aptly enough for a drama which routinely confounds concepts of linear time, Doctor Who similarly complicates the conventional temporal structures of adaptation. Employing a Derridean reading, Marlow suggests how the most recent iteration of Doctor Who folds into itself the sometimes transgressive fictional extrapolations of its fans; in this way, the ‘new’ Doctor Who – itself scripted and directed by fans who have ‘crossed over’ – has origins in sources which are themselves adaptations.\n\nAfter-images Marlow explores the ways in which a popular revival of a cult genre must address two audiences simultaneously: the expert and the unknowing. In ‘3:10 again: a remade Western and the problem of authenticity’, Pete Falconer examines the genre movie as adaptation, with reference to a 2007 remake of a classic Hollywood Western. Here questions of fidelity pertain not simply to the ‘source text’ but more broadly to the conventions of a genre with which the original audience would be familiar but into which the less knowing audience must be inducted. From the vantage point of a film remake, Falconer offers insights into\n\n4\n\nADAPTATION IN CONTEMPORARY CULTURE\n\n‘period’ adaptation, reflecting on the tensions between fidelity to a historical past and fidelity to the conventions of a classic genre. The authenticity of the Western remake would seem to reside less in its deference to a prior authorial signature than in its fidelity to a specific mode of representation, here dictated by genre. In ‘Child’s play: participation in urban space in Weegee’s, Dassin’s and Debord’s versions of Naked City’, Joe Kember explores the intertextual relationship between a series of texts produced in the 1940s and 1950s, which appeared in contexts ranging from the tabloid press to the avant garde manifesto. The continuity which Kember discerns is not attributed simply to a common source text – Weegee’s celebrated photographic portfolio – but rather to a shared repertoire of ‘playful, experimental or even transgressive’ representational strategies for the depiction of urban experience; drawing on Henri Lefebvre’s ‘rhythmanalysis’, Kember traces a signature tension between motifs of immersion and detachment as a defining feature of the Naked City text/s. Twenty-first-century children’s play provides the context for Cathlena Martin’s exploration of transmedia intertextuality in ‘Charlotte’s website: media transformation and the intertextual web of children’s culture’. As a classic of children’s literature, E. B. White’s 1952 novel Charlotte’s Web has been adapted for the screen as both animated and live-action feature films; Martin places its adaptation to video game in the context of current debates about remediation. For the child consumer immersed in convergence culture, Charlotte’s Web becomes an intertext with multiple manifestations whose brand identity is affirmed by familiar graphics and common marketing strategies, rather than authorial origin. The kinds of anthropomorphic strategies employed in media adaptations of Charlotte’s Web are investigated by Paul Wells in ‘“Stop writing or write like a rat”: becoming animal in animated literary adaptations’. Animated adaptations of Maurice Sendak’s Where the Wild Things Are, P. L. Travers’s Mary Poppins and George Orwell’s Animal Farm are situated within a critical paradigm of ‘bestial ambivalence’; employing Deleuze and Guattari’s concept of ‘becoming animal’, Wells investigates the complex ways in which such adaptations mediate the relationship between human and animal.\n\nReproducing the Past In ‘Historicizing the classic novel adaptation: Bleak House (2005) and British television contexts’, Iris Kleinecke-Bates explores the role of television in mediating popular understandings of the past and, more particularly, the impact of classic adaptations of Dickens on perceptions of the Victorian era. Focusing on the 2005 BBC television adaptation of\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nBleak House, she examines the historicity of television as a medium and the changing conventions of period drama. Iris Kleinecke-Bates suggests that the acclaimed ‘soap opera’ format of the 2005 adaptation can be seen as a signifier both of fidelity to the original publication conditions of the source text and of nostalgia for television’s own history in its return to earlier traditions of period drama serialization. Iris Kleinecke-Bates notes how the 2005 Bleak House marked a departure from the heritage aesthetic which prevailed in classic adaptations in the 1980s and early 1990s. The cultural politics of this genre is the focus of Karen Wells’s examination of a contemporary heritage film for children in ‘Embodying Englishness: representations of whiteness, class and Empire in The Secret Garden’. Wells places Agnieskza Holland’s 2003 film adaptation of Frances Hodgson Burnett’s 1911 novel in the multicultural context of its contemporary child audience; she argues that a ‘scopic regime of race’ is at work in the film which serves to heighten representations of whiteness while diminishing Burnett’s questioning of class and imperial hierarchies. In ‘Taming the velvet: lesbian identity in cultural adaptations of Tipping the Velvet’, Heather Emmens explores a doubly mediated adaptation of the past: the BBC 2002 television adaptation of Sarah Waters’s 1998 neo-Victorian fiction. Drawing on Judith Butler’s analysis of cultural repetitions as having both ‘disruptive’ and ‘domesticating’ effects, Emmens examines the cultural politics of lesbian representability with particular reference to what she terms the ‘femme-inization’ of lesbian visibility in mainstream popular culture. Emmens argues that the Andrew Davies’s-scripted adaptation not only supplanted Waters’s authorship but also rescripted her queer text for consumption by an implied male heterosexual audience. The tensions between disruption and domestication are further investigated with reference to popular appropriations of Davies’s adaptation, in the form of a tabloid newspaper’s pornographic ‘tribute’ to Tipping the Velvet, and a comic television pastiche. The gendered and racial politics of reproductive sexuality are explored by Terryl Bacon and Govinda Dickman in ‘“Who’s the Daddy?”: the aesthetics and politics of representation in Alfonso Cuarón’s adaptation of P. D. James’s Children of Men’. Speculative fictions rewrite the present as the putative past of a fictional future; analysing Cuarón’s film as ‘remediating’ the present, Bacon and Dickman interrogate the ostensible liberalism of its stance on race, postmodernity and globalization. Situating Children of Men within current cinematic trends, they examine the ‘spectacularization’ of James’s narrative as effected by immersive camera techniques and CGI simulation. More specifically, Bacon and Dickman interrogate the racial and gendered displacements at work in the adaptation whereby responsibility for a dystopian future – figuratively extrapolated from a contemporary present – is shifted from white men to women and racial ‘others’.\n\n6\n\nADAPTATION IN CONTEMPORARY CULTURE\n\nAfterlives In ‘Origin and ownership: stage, film and television adaptations of Daphne du Maurier’s Rebecca’, Rebecca D’Monté explores the afterlives of du Maurier’s 1938 fiction, itself a reworking of Charlotte Brontë’s 1847 novel Jane Eyre. D’Monté considers the 1940 stage and film adaptations within the contexts both of prevailing theatrical and cinematic conventions – the drawing-room drama and the female Gothic respectively – and contemporary historical conditions, specifically wartime anxieties about the preservation of national and gendered identities. By contrast, the 1920s setting of the 1997 television adaptation is examined as symptomatic of the heritage trend in classic adaptation, and as constructing an earlier post-war period as the location for a more explicit depiction of sexual transgression. As the author of both a ‘reauthored’ fiction – itself extensively reworked by subsequent writers – and of an ‘unfaithful’ stage adaptation of her own novel, du Maurier exemplifies the complexities of authorship as a category of cultural production. In ‘The post-feminist biopic: re-telling the past in Iris, The Hours and Sylvia’, Josephine Dolan, Suzy Gordon and Estella Tincknell explore the reproduction of the past as mediated not only by film genre – ranging from heritage pictorialism to Sirkian melodrama – but also by the biopic as a mode of public history. Issues of gender, authorship and agency are foregrounded in their analysis of biopics of women writers adapted from male authored biographical texts. The pre-feminist 1950s prove a key reference point for these films, whose ‘post-feminist’ location in relation to second-wave feminism is examined. Dolan, Gordon and Tincknell argue that the depiction of Iris Murdoch, Virginia Woolf and Sylvia Plath in these films serves not only to reiterate a problematic association between female creativity and ‘madness’, but also to posit a nominally reconstructed masculinity as the casualty of female agency. In ‘For the love of Jane: Austen, adaptation and celebrity’, Brenda R. Weber considers the extension of the proliferating Austen adaptation canon to the undocumented ‘text’ of her life. She explores the persistent fascination with Austen’s romantic life as expressed within the ‘second canon’ of Austen-inspired material; the fidelity of late-twentieth- and twenty-first-century ‘Janeites’ is situated in the context of contemporary cultures of fandom and celebrity. In response to the heteronormative imperatives at work in much fictional speculation on Austen’s ‘life-text’, Weber argues that Austen’s sorophilia – as depicted in the 2008 television biopic Miss Austen Regrets – can be understood as the model for her narrative evocations of affective attachment. The afterlives of adapted texts and authors are the focus of this final section; the collection concludes with a chapter dedicated to a novel which figures itself as the afterlife of imaginary films. In ‘Glamorama, cinematic narrative and contemporary fiction’, Ruth Helyer reads Bret Easton Ellis as ‘an author adapted by his own texts’. His 1991 novel\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nGlamorama – as yet unadapted for the screen, unlike his notorious American Psycho – is examined as a ‘cinematic narrative’ which selfconsciously evokes and emulates cinematic narrative techniques. Moreover, Helyer suggests that it depicts a postmodern ‘reality’ so thoroughly mediated by film and celebrity culture that its protagonists are reduced to ‘models’ with no original; perpetually performing their identities, they act out their roles as if for an adaptation of their own lives.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nHeavy Bodies, Fragile Texts: Stage Adaptation and the Problem of Presence FRANCES BABBAGE\n\nIt is dark. I stretch out an arm and hit a wall: cool, slippery. My fingers discover a door, turn a handle – but it is locked. Briefly, I am alarmed: there is no one else here and it’s quiet – muffled – my face is covered, my breathing amplified. And although I don’t really believe it, I allow myself to think: what if I am trapped in here? And I think: I should not be in here. I turn abruptly and give a little gasp as I bump into a body. It moves – thankfully – and clutches my arm, and together we stumble through a curtained alcove and I am somewhere new. The light is more generous now. It is a bedroom: a woman’s, I decide, although minus its occupant. Something about the clutter: the jumble of bottles – perfume? – and impression of lace. I look away from tumbled bed-sheets to walls almost obscured by scraps of paper, all pinned to the faded flock. I make out the diminutive writing on one card: a recipe to cure consumption (‘Take one peck of small garden snails and a quart of earthworms’, it begins). Those bottles – not perfume, but medicine: Piso’s Consumption Cure; Dr Kilmer’s Indian Cough Cure Consumption Oil. I turn to my companion from the other room, but there is no one there. I could be alone throughout this, I think: just me, my thoughts and a succession of rooms, unpeopled, yet not lifeless. Leaving by a different door I am almost knocked over by a man running past, pursued by another in a top hat shouting: ‘Sir – I demand the satisfaction of a gentleman.’ Masked figures hurry after these two down a corridor: I follow.1\n\nThis is Punchdrunk Theatre’s The Masque of the Red Death, staged at Battersea Arts Centre in 2007–08: or rather, my experience of it. It is a truism of theatre that no two spectators, present the same night, witness the same show. Here the claim is literally true: Punchdrunk, formed in 2000, specialize in productions where an entire building is transformed into a labyrinthine installation through which spectators move freely over the course of a few hours. Performance experience is fragmented on many levels: you may catch a narrative when the scene is finishing, or, as I did, find yourself in rooms which seem palpably only recently abandoned. You may decide to leave a scene halfway through, itself just a fragment of a larger narrative the actors do not choose to share. There may be sequences you hear about yet never find, whilst others you\n\n12\n\nADAPTATION IN CONTEMPORARY CULTURE\n\nstumble on repeatedly. One may be improvised uniquely for you alone. You can observe; you can interact, with characters and material things (there is an abundance of ‘things’). You can do almost anything, except remove the anonymous mask you receive on arrival – or, perhaps, depart before Punchdrunk want you to. In this chapter I examine two principal questions. First, how far can a performance form like this – a vast installation-cum-promenade that invites spectators to receive scenes in any order and demands they miss some altogether – be considered to ‘adapt’ literary texts? What becomes of narrative in such circumstances, and does this matter? Second, what relationships might exist between private prior acquaintance with a source text and the opportunities for reception which the live encounter provides? In addressing that second question I refer directly to my own, necessarily subjective, engagement with the ‘texts’ of Punchdrunk and Poe, and set this alongside other equally impressionistic responses from others who attended during the show’s seven-month sell-out run. Beyond these, I refer to the ‘authoritative’ assessments of media critics. A quantity of perspectives are considered, yet in their multiplicity the impression that forms becomes less coherent, not more so. How can one evaluate work where spectator engagement has been so fundamentally diverse – indeed, where no consensus exists on what took place? Given that difficulty, whilst I consider the wider implications of such an approach for the creation and reception of theatrical adaptation and risk initial conclusions, my analysis never quite parts company with experience and opinion that is intuitive, unverifiable, and possibly fanciful. The immersive experience offered by Punchdrunk’s Masque is not without precedent in the history of stage adaptation. The theatre company Grid Iron, formed in 1995, also specialize in site-specific promenade performance in unusual locations: productions have included an adaptation of Angela Carter’s story ‘The Bloody Chamber’ for Edinburgh’s underground vaults in 1997 and Jim Crace’s novel The Devil’s Larder for the Old City Morgue in Cork in 2005 (www.gridiron. org.uk). Another company, Wildworks, emerged from an artistic collaboration titled Three Islands Project, an ambitious adaptation of the Gabriel Garcia Marquez story ‘A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings’, realized on three separate occasions in large-scale outdoor production on Malta, Cyprus and at home in Cornwall between 2003 and 2005 (www.wildworks.biz). Such projects are not representative of theatrical adaptation as wider practice, yet since I deal here with fundamental issues concerning dramatic treatments of literature – with ‘problems’ that reinvention of prose for performance must always confront – I preface discussion of my central example, Punchdrunk, by situating this alongside more familiar adaptation practices. The tradition of adapting non-dramatic literature for the stage is longstanding. Today it is rare that listings for any major theatre in the country, in any season, do not include at least one adaptation; most\n\nSTAGE ADAPTATION AND THE PROBLEM OF PRESENCE 13 have more.2 The status of production as adaptation is not always foregrounded; understandably, marketing will highlight the perceived strongest draw. But where adaptation is announced as such, today’s theatre audiences have come to accept – to expect – ever more inventive dramaturgical strategies from its creators. No longer is a novel rejected for adaptation, for instance, on grounds of the quantity of settings in the original; nor is the typical solution to this problem the resituating of dramatic action within limited, practically realizable locations. I give one example to show how conceptions of stage adaptation have shifted over recent decades, with reference to a source – not Poe, but equally Gothic – presenting numerous difficulties for theatrical transposition. Bram Stoker’s Dracula, (in)famous novel of the Victorian fin-de-siècle, has been repeatedly adapted to the cinema screen – indeed, so significant a presence has the Count found here that, as Linda Hutcheon notes, ‘films about Dracula today are as often seen as adaptations of other earlier films as they are of Bram Stoker’s novel’ (2006: 21). This is not equally true of Dracula’s adaptations for the theatre, although there are many. The ephemerality of live performance, and the smaller numbers reached, mean that collective cultural memory of stage adaptation’s history – in general and in this instance – will always be less strongly marked. The problems Dracula poses for stage or screen are manifold. There is its epistolary structure, seemingly giving access to the viewpoints of multiple narrators; the plot – journeying from Transylvania to London, Whitby and back again – presents another difficulty; the sheer quantity of characters, still another. Beyond any of these is the challenge of finding form for that which defies representation, because it is otherworldly. The immediacy and intimacy of stage-spectator contact, which is theatre’s strength, may conversely make this medium less able than film to give effective shape to a figure as shadowy as the vampire. The first licensed staging of Dracula, by actor-manager Hamilton Deane and opening in London in 1924, compressed Stoker’s unwieldy narrative into three acts, two set in Jonathan Harker’s study and one in Mina Harker’s boudoir. Omitted as ‘unstageable’ were the entire first section of the novel recording Harker’s harrowing experiences in Transylvania, and the pursuit of Dracula to his native land. These decisions, although radical, were not detrimental to the production’s success: it ran for a record-breaking 391 performances at three London theatres, followed by a still more profitable Broadway transfer. The notoriety Deane’s adaptation achieved was partly due to a sensational epilogue which saw the Count ‘staked’ in his coffin, a magician’s disappearing box allowing him to ‘crumble bloodlessly into dust before the audience’s eyes’ (Skal 1993: 63). The moment was highly effective, if efficacy can be measured by the reported statistic that, on average, seven spectators fainted each night (Ludlam 1977: 180). The critics proved less susceptible. Punch’s reviewer mocked the ‘grave conscientious[ness]’ of the actors, incongruous within what should have been allowed to\n\n14\n\nADAPTATION IN CONTEMPORARY CULTURE\n\nbecome ‘full-blooded’ melodrama, concluding that such scenes must always be ‘more seriously alarming between the pages of a book than they are in the three-dimensional medium of the stage’ (Skal 1993: 10). More recent dramatizations have taken advantage of familiarity with anti-illusionist stage conventions to adopt alternative strategies in tackling the challenges posed. Liz Lochhead’s 1985 version, first staged at Edinburgh’s Royal Lyceum, made striking use of a composite set in which Dracula’s castle remained present and visible throughout, at times more, at times less clearly lit: the distinction between Transylvania and England, alien and familiar, was literally made hazy, reinforcing the play’s refusal to align the threatened crisis unproblematically with a foreign ‘other’. A decade later, Hull Truck Theatre Company staged a new Dracula adaptation by Jane Thornton and John Godber at their own theatre in Hull, and like Lochhead found a radical ‘solution’ to the structural challenges inherent in the source text. This version had a cast of just six and played on what was ‘essentially an empty stage. A few old chairs, upstage a raised area connected by ramps. Candles, cobwebs, a plethora of coffins’ (Thornton and Godber 1998: 1). Through imaginative manipulation of this sparse set, the ‘impossible’ became stageable: for example, Dracula could now descend head first down the ‘castle wall’ evoked by a lifted ramp – an unforgettable image in Stoker’s book and one that Deane had desired as a prologue for his 1924 adaptation but which was judged ‘too expensive and cumbersome for touring’ (Skal 1993: 3). Hull Truck’s production can be placed within a contemporary tradition of physical theatre – influenced by such practitioners as Jerzy Grotowski and Jacques Lecoq – whereby the actor is made emphatically the channel through which narrative interactions, events, even locations are conveyed. Direct representation of place or scenic shift is judged not just unnecessary but potentially an actual impediment to establishing a stage-spectator relationship in which liveness and creativity are paramount. It is not difficult to make the leap from this 1995 Dracula to another, staged by Northern Ballet Theatre at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in 2005. David Nixon’s production employed a simple miseen-scène of Gothic architectural images which served as evocative backdrop for a performance language composed of movement, light and shadow, and costume designed to extend the expressive capacities of the dancer’s body. Adaptation of novel to ballet necessarily allows much licence, especially since, as Patrick Flanery has argued, the latter has traditionally been considered ‘something like the antithesis of literature’; anticipating subtraction of the verbal dimension, audiences of dance theatre will expect a production that assumes a distinctively new shape (Flanery 2008). These overtly ‘physical theatres’ have not ousted more realistic representation, nor do they threaten to do so: nonetheless, their influence on the contemporary stage is profound. Today, the actor/performer, as\n\nSTAGE ADAPTATION AND THE PROBLEM OF PRESENCE 15 opposed to the character, will likely be the heart of an adaptation. Typically, polysemic designs or a bare space are substituted for illustrative stage sets. No list of key players should omit Théâtre de Complicité, Shared Experience or Kneehigh Theatre, all leaders in this field and part of a growing body of companies whose reinventions of prose texts for performance collectively celebrate the actor’s capability seemingly to embody any narrative, any image. Increasingly, the principles that underpin contemporary anti-illusionist theatre allow – indeed, actively encourage – freedoms in adaptation that, by implication, invite us to find more representative treatments unsatisfactory, their expressive potential literally encumbered by the weight of their properties. Given this trend in contemporary stage adaptation to cast off ever more decisively the ‘trappings’ of realistic representation, it is intriguing that Punchdrunk should adopt what is in one sense the reverse approach. In their work, the stage set is brought back with a vengeance, establishing as complete an illusion as the company can muster: director Felix Barrett’s designers apply a ‘cinematic level of detail’ to the host space, aiming ‘to immerse the audience in the world of the play’ (www. punchdrunk.org.uk). The place of performance becomes the central character of the drama. Of course, the performers themselves still matter, and they make strong impressions on us – the tantalizing fragments of dialogue and fiercely physical, erotic sequences of partner dance, choreographed by Maxine Doyle and now a Punchdrunk trademark – but such scenes can flash past spectators, somewhat; the invitation to linger in and dwell upon the event is fundamentally bound to one’s relationship with the extraordinary created space. In that relationship, the stated intent of ‘immersion’ is not fully achieved, I suggest, if this implies one is wholly submerged in the illusion to the point where the structures beyond and beneath this disappear from consciousness. Part of the pleasure in participation derives from recognition of the marriage of features already present in the building with the dressings imposed upon it, a union in which it becomes difficult to judge ‘real’ from ‘fake’. The layering of place that results and which characterizes site-specific performance as a genre has been described by Mike Pearson and Cliff McLucas, directors of Welsh performance company Brith Gof, as indicative of tensions between ‘the host and the ghost’. For McLucas, these terms seek to articulate ‘the relationship between place and event. The host site is haunted for a time by a ghost that the theatre-makers create. Like all ghosts it is transparent and the host can be seen through the ghost’ (Kaye 2000: 128). Pearson elaborates on this: Site-specific performances rely upon the complex superimposition and co-existence of a number of narratives and architectures, historical and contemporary. These fall into two groups: those that pre-exist the work – of the host – and those which are of the work – of the ghost. (Taylor 1997: 95–6)\n\n16\n\nADAPTATION IN CONTEMPORARY CULTURE\n\nUseful as this host/ghost dynamic proves as a way to articulate the operations and effects of performance that exploits unusual and challenging sites, or uses conventional theatre buildings in an unconventional way, in examining Punchdrunk’s Masque we must add another layer. There are narratives in play here that derive neither from host nor ghost, but are brought by the spectators themselves. I do not speak (although I could) of the ways in which spectator engagement might be shaped by personal acquaintance with company or building (and Battersea Arts Centre, the ‘host’, would be deeply familiar to many attending). I refer to the narratives of Poe, as these exist in the imagination and memories of audience members. Some may come ‘innocently’ – that is, with no such prior knowledge – and the extent to which the event acquaints them with Poe’s work is, regrettably, the subject of another essay. But what space can be found, in this production, for the Poe that many of us must bring in our heads? Despite its title, Punchdrunk’s production adapts not one but several of Poe’s ‘tales of terror’: ‘The Fall of the House of Usher’, ‘The Cask of Amontillado’, and ‘William Wilson’, among others. Poe’s brides were there – Berenice, Ligeia, Eleonora – those doomed, skeletal creatures I sometimes struggle to tell apart. ‘The Masque of the Red Death’ provides the framing story, appropriately so since it leads its reader through a succession of rooms, each more extraordinary than the last. In this tale, a plague has fallen on the country. The rooms are chambers in the palace of Prince Prospero and while the disease rages beyond its walls, the Prince and his friends enjoy a decadent party. They believe themselves safe from the plague until a mysterious guest arrives dressed in graveclothes and corpse-like mask ‘besprinkled with the scarlet horror’ (Poe 1986: 258). Death has stolen in amongst the revellers, Poe says, ‘like a thief in the night’ (Poe 1986: 260). I have always loved Poe’s stories, being guiltily fond of his deranged heroes and moribund, mutilated heroines.3 I have seen these filmed, incomparably in the ‘Poe cycle’ of American International Pictures, vehicles for an increasingly self-parodic Vincent Price. I have listened to them translated into opera, in works by Peter Hammill (1991) and Philip Glass (1987). I have watched them in the theatre, memorably Steven Berkoff’s 1974 version of ‘Usher’ (I saw it in the 1990s), as well as amateur adaptations of ‘Hop-Frog’, ‘The Tell-Tale Heart’ and ‘The Black Cat’. But in all cases, whatever liberties were taken with narrative, however great the impact of the formal transposition, the adaptations were conventional to the point that they sought to (re)tell a story, as well as rouse our senses and enshroud us in atmosphere. Punchdrunk’s production was different. ‘Adaptation’ is not the company’s term – ‘dramatic intervention and interpretation’ is the single phrase they use referring to the relationship of performance to prior text(s) – but I apply it here nevertheless, borrowing Hutcheon’s definition of adaptation as ‘an extended, deliberate, announced revisitation of a particular work of\n\nSTAGE ADAPTATION AND THE PROBLEM OF PRESENCE 17 art’, ‘a derivation that is not derivative’, coming ‘second without being secondary’ (Hutcheon 2006: 170, 9). By these terms, the definition fits. The show’s programme suggests two, equally valued subjects: the first, Poe; the second, Punchdrunk. As noted, there is almost nothing there about adaptation: it is for us to fill in the gaps, the implication being that the created event represents a dynamic fusion of two complementary artistic forces (albeit with only one party’s consent). As adaptation, Punchdrunk’s production is distinctive in that it does not attempt to tell the stories it references. Attending it was like fingering my own copy of Poe’s tales pulled from a fire, as if left with no more than remnants, pages charred and quantities missing, but the text in my hands still vividly evocative of that which, somehow, I consider Poe to be: the stories as I recall them; the unquantifiable ‘spirit’ of the material. The openly subjective character of this analogy prompts me to return to the binaries of ‘fidelity’ and ‘betrayal’, terms that have been largely discredited within adaptation studies – and rightly so, as the problems they raise are too numerous to recount. But we should not dismiss those terms out of hand, even given the difficulties they present, since when encountering adaptation as ‘knowing’ audience – in other words, experiencing it as adaptation – one’s response can be profoundly subjective: ‘that’s not how I saw it’ is a reaction so instinctive and understandable that it should not be repressed by being judged academically unbecoming. After all, is it not a risk that in refusing to invite such terms openly into discussion they haunt it all the more? In my own three hours with Punchdrunk, in all its fragmentation, missed moments and repetitions, I felt drawn decisively into the world of Poe’s fiction. The experience reflected the ‘Poe’ with whom I am familiar: extravagant, obsessive, ludicrous, poetic, morbid, perverse. The lavish provision of the visual and physical, with a relative sparsity of text, seemed an apt translation of Poe’s own preference for unusual ‘effect’ above reliance on action and incident (Poe 1986: 481). At the same time, this approach revealed cavalier disregard for another of Poe’s aesthetic principles: the vital importance of literary structure. An effective ‘plot’, for Poe, is one where ‘no one of its component parts shall be susceptible of removal without detriment to the whole’ (Poe 1986: 457); his works – if we believe him – were constructed with almost mathematical precision (Poe 1986: 480–92). But the company not only played fast and loose with Poe’s tales – extracting only small fragments and adding much invention – but largely relinquished control of the way spectators received these: we witnessed some moments but not all, and recognized that some would be differently improvised by performers each night, if repeated at all. By no means would I term Punchdrunk’s work unstructured. On the contrary, its organization was highly sophisticated. Rather, in place of controlled narrative composition, the company substitute event composition – and for that event to be possible, narrative ‘wholeness’ was sacrificed, perhaps gleefully abandoned.\n\n18\n\nADAPTATION IN CONTEMPORARY CULTURE\n\nA seasoned spectator of Punchdrunk, which I am not, might take a more cynical line on the production’s treatment of Poe. Many who saw Masque had attended the company’s Faust the year before, and so broadly knew what to expect.4 One, who found Faust ‘wonderful’, appeared already jaded: for him, Masque was a version of the same, still wonderful, he allowed, but ultimately ‘more of the wonderful same’ (Rebellato 2008). One might begin to suspect that the particularities of the source material could be less important for the company than the manner of production: could any source – literary or otherwise – be given a ‘Punchdrunk treatment’? I had not seen the company’s work before, however, and was powerfully affected by it. I admired the scale of the achievement, and still do: it was a stunning, generous installation, vast in scale yet obsessed with minutiae, its performances skilled, witty, frequently audacious. But more importantly, I appreciated what it did with Poe. Actually, to get to the heart of it, I appreciated most what it did not do with Poe. Punchdrunk did not present ‘Roderick Usher’ and leave me to judge his likeness to a preconceived idea. I cannot say if the woman I saw dressed by her maid was Berenice or Rowena, nor if it was she who sought the cure for consumption (she was certainly pale). The performers did not enact ‘The Tell-Tale Heart’ to the accompaniment of a ticking clock. They did not ‘enact’ much at all. They gave beginnings, but not an end. They did not drown out the fragile, hazy impressions of Poe’s tales that I have in my mind; they left space for my own (pre)-readings. This sounds like faint praise: am I merely saying that they did not spoil Poe for me? Actually, I want to argue that for Punchdrunk not to ruin ‘my’ Poe is no insignificant achievement. Literature, and the experience of reading, is one pleasure; dramatic performance brings rewards that are equally profound. This twin fascination draws us towards adaptation, but simultaneously instils terror of it. I have sympathy with Philip Hensher, writing here in reference to the BBC’s 2005 production of Bleak House: The main reason for not watching this dramatisation, or . . . any dramatisation of Bleak House ever again is knowing that one would sit there with gritted teeth waiting for some magnificently unnecessary moment [in Dickens’ narrative], groaning with pain at its omission or suffering an only temporary relief. (Hensher 2005)\n\nHensher’s is an extreme position, its implication being that the only conceivably acceptable ‘retelling’ would – as in the Borges story, ‘Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote’ – have to be one where no single word of the original was either added to, or removed. I would not go so far. The conviction that theatrical sensibility can meet literature in ways that are unique and valuable maintains my patience with adaptation as a practice, but keeps me largely more engaged by and enthusiastic for its marginal experiments than its dominant centre.\n\nSTAGE ADAPTATION AND THE PROBLEM OF PRESENCE 19 One study that could help us theorize dramatic adaptation does not directly address the subject at all. Elaine Scarry’s Dreaming by the Book (1999) considers the means by which poets and writers of prose facilitate the reader’s process of mental composition: much of the book is devoted to examining the kind of textual strategies that bring literature ‘to life’ in the minds of its recipients. Scarry argues that the challenge faced by such authors is to build impressions of vivacity and substance in the non-material realm of the imagination. Her point is not that, as readers, we construct entire mental stage sets for Madame Bovary, or Silas Marner, but rather that – to take the latter – we memorably ‘see’ the soft yellow ringlets of the child Eppie, as Marner does, and with him recognize these as replacement for the golden guineas that were stolen from him. Works of literature – repetitive black marks on a white page – thus strive to achieve texture, shade, movement, weight, in our reception of them. But if as Scarry suggests this is the challenge for poetry and prose, I would argue that dramatic adaptation of such texts meets that challenge in reverse: here, the problem becomes one of preventing an excess of noise, colour and corporeality – an overabundance of presence – from trampling too heavily upon the mental images that haunt spectators who (re-)receive such texts through performance. This in essence is the problem of which Hensher complains: ‘The main reason for not wanting to watch this Bleak House is simply that one doesn’t want it in one’s head.’ He claims further that the ‘better the dramatisation, the worse the danger that another imagination will interpose itself between the author’s and the reader’s: one nothing to do with either’ (Hensher 2005). Hensher writes of televised adaptation, and here maybe the clash of visions he dreads is especially jarring. Drama on film tends towards realism, crowding the screen with ‘information’ that this aesthetic demands but which was not required in the literary original. As Jonathan Miller has commented, ‘[i]n some mysterious way, the description of a scene [in a novel] appears to be fully occupied by what it describes and never appears to lack what it fails to mention’ (Giddings, Selby and Wensley 1990: 18). Unlike drama on film, drama on stage necessarily favours more selective representation of the ‘real’. My commentary on successive treatments of Dracula sketched a trajectory whereby adaptations seemed progressively more agile, confident in their ability to convey the ‘essence’ of a source and discard all that is deemed inessential. But that depends on how one chooses to remember a show. Thinking back now on all three Draculas, I retain more powerfully from the memory an excitement at what could have been, rather than what was. The boldest leaps come back to land, sometimes with a too-audible thump. In moments of Hensheresque frustration, we might feel that even the smartest, most spirited takes on a text are literally just that: they ‘take’ something that mattered, or at least intrude painfully upon it. One could adopt Hensher’s line: if it means that much to you, don’t watch it. But I want\n\n20\n\nADAPTATION IN CONTEMPORARY CULTURE\n\nto argue for adaptation that can excite and inspire, and yet serve a knowing audience with kindness. Pursuing my reversal of Scarry, such an adaptation would begin to undo its own completeness: it would contrive to destabilize and undermine the very structures – temporal, spatial, bodily, aural – that stage production must necessarily erect. This deconstruction could admit the possibility of more subtle negotiation between the physical here-and-now of the theatre, and the intangible ‘non-place’ of multifarious images and preconceptions rooted in the minds of a potential audience. I have argued that Punchdrunk’s Poe achieved a balance between what was given and what withheld. Nevertheless, a show like this one will always be a controversial model for adaptation. Some spectators who were not already familiar with Poe reported that they found it ‘hard to understand’ (Pilbeam 2008), ‘too fragmentary to grip’ (Worth 2008), with ‘many hints but not enough certainties’ (Francis 2008); one who did know the tales still ‘had trouble finding any Poe folks at all in the murky bowels’ of the Battersea Arts Centre (Isherwood 2008). Yet if this production’s treatment of its source did not leave an innocent audience much wiser, this need not constitute criticism; I would not argue that an adaptation’s merit lies in its ability to make us feel we ‘know’ literature we have not read. But despite these problems and dissatisfactions, I propose that participatory site-specific performance, here exemplified by Punchdrunk, is a form that might provocatively ‘adapt’ texts and textuality in ways that delicately circumvent the excess of presence that too often overburdens adaptations for the stage. In conclusion, I return briefly to our physical mode of engagement with Punchdrunk and the implications of this for the event as adaptation. Spectators are masked; it is dark, intentionally disorientating; you may arrive in a group, but find yourself alone. Reviewing the production favourably, Michael Billington introduced the caveat that ‘whereas the joy of most theatre is that one participates in a collective experience, here the stress is on individually determined journeys’ (Billington 2007). The point is fair, but perhaps the degree of isolation one encounters is simultaneously that which supports and makes space for cherished individual attachments to the source. And whilst one is essentially alone during the event, there is a kind of community that comes afterwards. So many people have spoken about this show, written about it, added to blogs about it, all eager to share what ‘their’ three hours meant to them. I conclude with the thoughts of other spectators, in other words, with more of the impressionistic, individualistic responses which I acknowledged at the outset as inseparable from this debate: It felt so complete . . . so detailed, full and empty . . . at times I felt physically dirty; I could feel desperation and life within rooms . . . as well as death. (Gasparetto 2008)\n\nSTAGE ADAPTATION AND THE PROBLEM OF PRESENCE 21 A woman washing bloody rags, medical detritus . . . A wardrobe with no back that led into space and out through a fireplace into a room with a large table. A Narnia moment – my favourite of the whole experience. It haunted me for several days as I remembered the atmosphere, the detail of the furnishings and costumes, but I have no memory of a story, of a tale. (Nowell 2008) [T]here are moments of unforgettable quiet; you go into a room – fire in the grate, oil lamp glinting on sepia photographs – to find a Victorian matron playing a piano, nothing seems to be happening, but her life rustles around her. (Clapp 2007) I felt I had stepped into the text and was able to be a character, viewed by other spectators but not the actors themselves. I felt my experience was totally my own and unshared.

General audiences and academics alike perceived the remake as an outrageous insult to a much-loved classic, Hitchcock’s Psycho, made in 1960.1 Indeed, the ‘Psycho: Saving a Classic’ website ‘urged audiences to express their dissatisfaction [with van Sant’s film] by boycotting the opening weekend’ (Verevis 2006: 58). Academic writing on Psycho 98 was equally derisory, Thomas Leitch noting only three exceptions to the general rule.2 William Rothman’s despairing comment, ‘the more I dwell on van Sant’s Psycho, the more it can seem that cinema . . . has run its course, that the art of film is declaring bankruptcy’ (1999: 29), is an extreme version of a general dismissal of the film itself as aesthetically bankrupt. The critical context gives a certain logical inexorability to James Naremore’s conclusion that Psycho 98 should never have been made: ‘A better solution would have been to simply remaster the original 35 mm print and exhibit it around the world’ (1999–2000: 12). Reviews and articles typically dismissed Psycho 98 as a bad copy of the Master’s original. Unfortunately, the terms for its dismissal were provided by Universal’s own publicity campaign, which positively flaunted the criterion of fidelity, thereby inviting invidious comparisons with the first film. Leitch summarizes the key conditions governing the film’s production (2003). Famously, van Sant was said to have followed Joseph Stefano’s dialogue line by line, and John Russell’s camera work shot by shot. The remake was made for $20,000,000, the inflationadjusted equivalent of Psycho 60’s $800,000 budget. Finally, van Sant was said to have insisted on adhering to Hitchcock’s very tight, 6-week shooting schedule. It seems feasible to suggest that the publicizing of van Sant’s embracing such a series of textual and technical constraints was meant to put Psycho 98 on a par with Hitchcock’s own experiments with technical limitations, most obviously the ten-minute take in Rope (1948).\n\n24\n\nADAPTATION IN CONTEMPORARY CULTURE\n\nThe language of fidelity used in the promotional material also generates a model for mapping changes to the original as laudable attempts to restore its full impact/glory. In this way, the remake’s restoration of deleted lines from the screenplay, such as Cassidy’s line to Marion that bed is ‘the only playground to beat Las Vegas’, and recreation of impossibly expensive shots from the shooting script, such as the opening helicopter shot across the city, are regarded as expressions of loyalty to ‘the original’. However, such loyalty is misguided since it is clear that the vaunted ‘original’ has proliferated into (at least) three different texts: the film, the screenplay and the shooting script. The publicity surrounding Psycho 98 thus made it much more than the simple updating of a classic: it set up a quest for a fetishized ‘authenticity’ that can be seen as a paradoxical attempt to be more Hitchcock than Hitchcock. The publicity campaign’s fetishization of an impossible authenticity plays into fans’ and academics’ conception of Psycho 60 as a unique, original text and social event. The valorization of the originality of the first film sustains a series of binary oppositions – original/copy, authentic/imitation – through which the second will always be judged to be lacking. Constantine Verevis argues that the evaluation of Psycho 98 as a ‘cheap imitation’ is entirely logical given that most of the critical literature on the remake conceptualizes ‘remaking as a one-way process: a movement from authenticity to imitation, from the superior self-identity of the original to the debased resemblance of the copy’ (2006: 58). It should also be added that Psycho 60 has an indisputable claim to ‘superior self-identity’ in its critical valorization as the epitome of the holistic aesthetics espoused by Cahiers du Cinema, which Sam Ishii-Gonzalès summarizes: ‘Rohmer and Chabrol once claimed, “In Hitchcock’s work form does not embellish content, it creates it.” Form is not added to meaning that is pre-existent. Meaning is discovered in the elaboration of form’ (2001–2: 153). The conjunction of form with meaning creates an indissoluble link, a model of each film as an indivisible totality. Ishii-Gonzalès concludes: ‘This, for Hitchcock, was the power of “pure cinema”’ (2001–2: 153). The strong sense of the absolute integrity of Hitchcock’s texts informs much of the critical literature on Psycho 98. The articles follow the ‘one-way process’ defined by Verevis, most setting out to demonstrate the ways in which the remake as bad copy is fundamentally flawed. Naremore’s article is a good example of the double bind in which Psycho 98 is caught: where it is the same as Psycho 60 it is merely ‘slavish imitation’, and ‘wherever van Sant diverges from the original he makes bad choices’ (1999–2000: 5–6). Interestingly, most of the academic articles that address the text of Psycho 98 in any detail simply provide lists of the ways in which it diverges from, and thereby loses the aesthetic integrity and/or authorial brilliance of, the original. Ishii-Gonzalès’ introduction to his article is a clear example. He aims\n\nREMAKING PSYCHO\n\n25\n\nto demonstrate ‘how alterations made to the original structure [of the parlour scene] in the “shot-by-shot” remake manage to divest this sequence not only of its emotional intensity and its thematic resonance but also of Hitchcock’ (2001–2: 149). It is worth noting that in this instance writing on the remake closely resembles writing on literature-to-film adaptations, deploying what Robert Stam describes as ‘an elegiac discourse of loss, lamenting what has been “lost” in the transition . . . while ignoring what has been gained’ (2005: 3). Importantly, the elegiac discourse constructed around Psycho 98 often takes a specific form: the lamentation of the loss of depth and the construction of the remake as utterly superficial. Thus, for Adrian Martin, van Sant’s film demonstrates that ‘you can mechanically copy all the surface moves of a screen classic and still drain it of any meaning, tension, artistry, and fun’ (2001–2: 133). Martin’s view of the central actors’ performances as ‘hopelessly wooden and superficial’ (2001–2001: 134) is shared by many other critics. Rothman argues that Vince Vaughn’s ‘obvious weirdness’ means that his Norman lacks the emotional depth of Anthony Perkins’ (1999: 30); while Leitch argues that Anne Heche’s ‘sunnier, flightier Marion’ lacks the ‘gravity of Leigh’s’ (2003). In these two readings the move to the pure surface is respectively characterized as the loss of the secret – Norman’s psychosis as hidden depths – and the loss of gravity/gravitas in the form of Leigh’s stolid sincerity and integrity. McDowell augments these analyses by suggesting that the superficiality of the performances prohibits the audience from investing emotionally in the characters (2008). Rothman’s analysis of textuality and meaning expands the imagery of depth and hidden secrets in order to argue that Psycho 98 lacks the philosophical significance of the original film: ‘Behind the surface of Hitchcock’s films, or, rather, on the surface but “hidden” by being in plain view, are . . . motifs or signs or symbols . . . whose presence participates crucially in the film’s philosophical meditations’ (1999: 33). Rothman identifies the presence of ‘Hitchcock’s “////” motif’ (1999: 32) at the end of Psycho 60, occurring in the dissolve from Mrs Bates’ mummified face to the external façade of the courtroom – its four white pillars forming the four bars ‘////’. Van Sant reprises the dissolve but changes Mrs Bates’ hairstyle from a tight bun recalling Madelaine and Carlotta in Vertigo to ‘wild, long hair’, thereby ensuring that ‘the spirits of those ghostly Hitchcock women’ are not recalled. As a result, the first shot of the ‘dissolve is . . . devoid of . . . mystery’ (1999: 32–3). Worse still, in the second shot the courthouse lacks columns and does not reprise the vital ‘////’ motif. Across Hitchcock’s work the motif is said to act as a metaphor for the imprisonment of the characters within the diegetic world as well as the audiences’ inability to access that world, providing a visual demarcation of the barrier of the screen itself (Rothman 1999: 32).\n\n26\n\nADAPTATION IN CONTEMPORARY CULTURE\n\nWhile the meta-critical/philosophical dimensions accruing to the ‘////’ motif are clearly absent from Psycho 98, Rothman goes further, arguing that the two shots comprising the dissolve can only be regarded as utterly devoid of meaning: The superimposition of one shot stripped of its original significance over another shot likewise devoid of significance turns Hitchcock’s complex and profound gesture not into a gesture of Van Sant’s own, however . . . diminished in meaning and expressiveness . . . Rather Van Sant’s dissolve is not meaningful or expressive. It does not have the force of a gesture at all. (1999: 33)\n\nLeitch rightly points out the flaw in the logic of this argument: ‘Granting that Van Sant’s camerawork does not mean the same as Hitchcock’s, why does it follow that it does not mean anything at all?’ (2003). The answer lies in Rothman’s utilization of a particular model of textual depth: in eradicating the mysterious and hidden dimensions of Psycho 60, van Sant’s copy offers a proliferation of pure surfaces that constitutes the annihilation of meaning. Ultimately, of course, the depths of the Hitchcock text are guaranteed by the presence of the Master, the ‘Genius’ who ‘resides between or beneath the shots’ (Ebert quoted in Cohan 2001–2: 130). The widespread prevalence of this vision of Hitchcock in the critical material leads Leitch to argue that one of the distinct achievements of Psycho 98 is its flushing out of ‘unreconstructed Auteurism’! (2003) For me, the most interesting feature of Rothman’s writing is the precise crystallization of a particular series of images of textual depth, which hold sway across much of the critical discourse on Psycho 98. For such critics, the film’s superficiality is understood as an involuntary voiding of depth, an accidental elimination of the power of the Master’s original. In contrast, I will argue that the film explicitly plays out and plays with the loss of the secret and the impossibility of hidden depths. At the same time the film is not simply an example of postmodern aesthetics, a Baudrillardian vision of superficiality and style: it is a reflection on becoming a surface that both draws on and remakes aspects of postmodern theory. The loss of the secret can be seen in the very different publicity campaigns surrounding the two films. Famously, Hitchcock urged audiences for Psycho 60 not to reveal the ‘tiny, little horrifying secrets’ of the story, particularly the ending of the film (Williams 2000: 364–5). The story is structured around two secrets: the death of the central female protagonist one-third of the way into the film, and the revelation that Norman as Mother is her killer. Leitch, Robin Wood and numerous other critics have addressed the shocking impact on viewers of Psycho in 1960 of the revelation of the first secret (1989: 143–6; 2003). In contrast, as is frequently noted, the publicity for Psycho 98 assumes audience\n\nREMAKING PSYCHO\n\n27\n\nknowledge of Marion’s death. Indeed, the location of her murder is shown on the poster of the bloodied hand clutching at a shower curtain with the accompanying tag line: ‘Check in. Relax. Take a shower.’ The remake plays to the knowledgeable audience in that the murder is anticipated – to the point of being the subject of a macabre joke – and the murderer known. It is this that gives Psycho 98 a particularly Baudrillardian problematic in that it remakes a film structured by secrets, indeed as a secret, while explicitly acknowledging that there are no secrets any more. For Baudrillard, it is the absence of the hidden that leads him to characterize the postmodern as obscene. Psycho 98 begins with two logos: the turning globe of ‘Universal’ and the ‘Imagine’ droplet. The second is remade in that the typically translucent water droplet is coloured red, sliding down the screen before dripping into a red/black pool, whose concentric ripples play across the word ‘Imagine’. The transformation of the logo draws attention to the importance of colour in the remake, the scarlet blood acting as a reminder of its distance from the black and white aesthetics of Psycho 60. The quantity of blood in the red/black pool is also suggestive of a higher level of violence, an acceleration that references the development of the slasher horror genre. For Carol Clover, Psycho 60 is the film that begins the very first cycle of slasher horror films, setting up a template for the genre in terms of characterization, setting and weaponry (1992: 24–34). Verevis draws on Clover’s work to argue that Psycho 98 should be seen in the context of all the other remakes of Psycho 60: from John Carpenter’s Halloween (1978) to Brian de Palma’s Dressed to Kill (1980) (2006: 63–5, 68–9). The remake of the ‘Imagine’ logo attests to the audience’s foreknowledge of events to come, while the quantity of scarlet gore also alludes to the multiplicity of remakes through which Psycho 60 has been more generally disseminated into popular culture. Famously, Psycho 60 opens with a dissolve from the vertical lines of the credit design to the high-rise buildings of an urban skyline identified as ‘Phoenix, Arizona’. Three further dissolves link the opening long shots of the city, culminating in a high-angle long shot of a hotel building as the camera zooms in towards a particular open window. There is a cut to a medium shot, virtually straight on to the window, and the camera tracks forward, sliding across the sill into the darkness of the hotel room. The contrast between the two types of camera movement – the zoom and the track – emphasizes the difference between the spaces: the public façades of the whitewashed buildings and the intimate darkness of private space. The next shot is a pan right that reveals the presence of the lovers, Marion and Sam, on the bed. They are discussing the necessity of meeting in secret. Hitchcock’s opening can therefore be seen to set up a series of oppositions: public/private, light/dark, open/ secret. In contrast, Psycho 98 begins with a helicopter shot that circles across the city and travels towards the selected hotel, apparently entering the\n\n28\n\nADAPTATION IN CONTEMPORARY CULTURE\n\nopen window and moving across the brightly lit hotel room to reveal the lovers on the bed. The use of the expensive helicopter shot combined with digital editing techniques to create the impression of a single, seamless shot means that the opening acts as a bravura statement celebrating the capacity of new technologies. In this regard, it conforms to Baudrillard’s conception of the remake as the technical perfecting of the cinematic image: ‘perfect remakes, or extraordinary montages that emerge from a more combinatory culture, of large photo-, kino-, historicosynthesis [sic.] machines’ (1994: 45). Importantly, for Baudrillard, combining different elements does not result in aesthetic creation. Instead, technological perfection renders the remake, indeed most contemporary cinema, machinic rather than imaginative: ‘Cinema has become hyper-realist, technically sophisticated, effective . . . All the films . . . fail to incorporate any element of make-believe (l’imaginaire). As if cinema were basically regressing towards infinity, towards . . . a formal empty perfection’ (Charbonnier 1993: 30). Van Sant’s creation of a bravura single shot and use of consistently bright lighting clearly abolishes the oppositions between public/private, light/dark that structure Hitchcock’s opening. The lighting in the first film indicates the sordid secrecy of the lovers’ meetings, which is compounded by their discussion. Marion’s unwelcome offer of a respectable dinner is made while she dresses on the other side of the room. The couple come back together when Marion suddenly propels herself into her lover’s arms, saying ‘Oh Sam, let’s get married’, her arms fastening tightly around his neck as she offers to lick the stamps on the envelopes containing his ex-wife’s alimony payments. Leigh’s performance conveys her great desire for marriage and respectability, suggesting that her affections are deep and sincere. In contrast, Anne Heche and Viggo Mortensen play the opening scene as light comedy, bantering about the possibility of a respectable dinner while remaining physically close to each other. Marion’s later offer to ‘lick the stamps’ while appreciatively viewing Sam standing naked in front of the window transforms the previously heartfelt admission into innuendo! For Baudrillard, remakes eliminate ‘the psychological, moral, and sentimental blotches’ of the original, thereby annihilating textual depth (1994: 45). The moral framework of Psycho 60 is provided by Marion’s desire for marriage and respectability, which perversely leads her to commit the immoral act of stealing the money. The film’s opening creates a multiform sense of depth offering privacy, darkness, intimacy and interiority – the argument between Sam and Marion revealing his antipathy towards marriage and her desire for it. In contrast, the opening shot of Psycho 98 exemplifies the logic of Baudrillard’s hyperreal, in that the perfecting of visual technique is synonymous with the obliteration of structural oppositions. The absence of arguments and revelations also proscribes any psychological model of hidden depths.\n\nREMAKING PSYCHO\n\n29\n\nThe key issue is whether the display/play of surfaces offered by Psycho 98 is more than Baudrillard’s vision of meaningless, empty perfection. Critics have argued that the colour palette of bright pastels used in Psycho 98 acts as a visual indicator of its overt artifice and superficiality (MacDowell 2008). These colours predominate in Marion’s wardrobe, which includes a candy pink suit and bright orange sun dress. However, the character is repeatedly associated with the colour orange, from her first appearance in peach/orange underwear to later appearances in her sun dress with key accessories: the orange-tinted sunglasses and vivid parasol. The scene in which Marion changes into her sun dress also serves to anticipate the character’s association with birds, a symbolism that is set up much later in Psycho 60. While Heche changes, birdsong can be heard over the musical reprise. Moreover, while she sits on the bed, head in a bird-like tilt as she contemplates the stolen money, a white dove can be seen fluttering into the tree outside the window in the background. The metonymic juxtaposition of Heche and the dove, coupled with her performance style, unfairly slated as ‘herky-jerky birdlike movements’ (Rothman 1999: 29), underscore the inevitability of her death at the hands of the taxidermist Norman Bates. Importantly, changes to the dialogue and the use of colour motifs in Psycho 98 have the effect of reconstructing Marion’s motivation from a bourgeois desire for marriage in the first film into a fantasy of escape. While she is sitting in her car at the pedestrian crossing, the voice-over plays out Marion’s construction of Sam’s reaction to her arrival. The first line is identical to that of Psycho 60: ‘Marion, what in the world, what are you doing up here?’ The question is followed by two new lines: ‘Where in the world did you get all that money? Yeah – it’s more than I need to get out of town.’ The new lines reconstruct her flight according to the logic of the road movie, in that it becomes a fantasy of escaping the mundane banality of the everyday. Having been spotted by her boss, Marion drives away quickly. Both films have a dissolve from a close-up of Marion driving, to a long shot of the car travelling the open road, followed by another dissolve to a close-up of Marion as she nearly falls asleep at the wheel. The long shot in Psycho 60 retains elements of the urban landscape in the pylons visible at the edge of the road. In contrast, van Sant offers a long shot of the car heading towards hills fringed by the warm orange hues of the setting sun, the tinted landscape picking up the key colour associated with Heche’s Marion. Schneider reads this moment as an example of van Sant’s own authorial signature emerging within Psycho 98: ‘In this respect, [Marion] is not unlike the protagonists of Van Sant’s other films who either live on, take to, or fantasize about the road in pursuit of . . . [a] more promising future (To Die For, Good Will Hunting)’ (2001–2: 145). Importantly, Marion’s fantasy of escape is constructed through the reprise of motifs from other films – foregrounding its status as a cultural construction.\n\n30\n\nADAPTATION IN CONTEMPORARY CULTURE\n\nWhile a few critics appreciated Heche’s achievement, namely the creation of an entirely different Marion (Leitch 2003), the assessment of Vince Vaughn’s performance as an impoverished copy was virtually unanimous. Rothman argues that ‘Vaughn lacks Tony Perkins’s trademark boy-next-door quality, so we are precluded from imagining . . . that behind the mask of the familiar, . . . there is a figure who is not what he seems’ (1999: 32). This analysis foregrounds the disjunction between seeming and being that organizes Perkins’ career-defining performance: the youthful, inexperienced, gauche adolescent, too embarrassed to name the bathroom and too bashful to dine with Marion in her bedroom, versus the Mother/killer within. It is clear that Vince Vaughn’s performance is not organized in the same way. Rothman comments that ‘Vaughn’s nervous giggles give away from the outset that he is missing a screw or two’ (1999: 32). Vaughn’s receding hairline and lined face means that Norman’s refusal to dine in the bedroom can no longer be read as youthful bashfulness, becoming instead a ploy that elicits a frowning, assessing stare from Marion. Vaughn displays Norman’s madness through inappropriate laughter and the relentless twisting and untwisting of his hands, constructing the character via a series of surface tics rather than the suggestion of interior depths. Moreover, as a ‘physically imposing, six-foot-five-inch leading-man’ (Schneider 2001–2: 146), Vaughn’s Norman can scarcely be said to hide his potential for being a physical threat. The changes to the presentation of Norman in Psycho 98 profoundly alter his motives for killing Marion, because he is systematically stripped of psychic depth. Žižek notes that the film’s depiction of Norman successfully masturbating while viewing Marion undressing undermines the most basic model of psychodynamic pressure because the killing no longer constitutes a displacement of sexual climax (2004: 268). Indeed, Marion’s murder cannot be viewed as the expression of repressed otherness: either the playing out of the fantasy of being Mother, or the return of repressed homosexuality, a homophobic reading facilitated by the casting of Anthony Perkins (MacDowell 2008). Lacking depth or oppositional otherness, the motive for murder is presented according to the logic of a continuum – as an exaggeration of heterosexual masculinity. This reading is reinforced by the casting of Vaughn, ‘whose resolutely macho heterosexual identity was well-established from previous films (e.g. Swingers, 1996)’ (Schneider 2001–2: 146). Moreover, the physical differences between the two leading actors are so extreme – Heche’s gamine slightness versus Vaughn’s pumped-up vastness – that the pair offer an almost parodic presentation of normative, heterosexual gender roles.3 Their physical disparity is duplicated in the picture that Norman removes from the wall in order to spy on Marion. Fragonard’s The Bolt features a central man whose rippling back muscles are visible beneath his shirt as he holds a slight, struggling woman in his left arm while reaching to bolt the door out of the bedroom with his right hand. In the\n\nREMAKING PSYCHO\n\n31\n\noriginal painting, which dates from the late eighteenth century, the female character is dressed in golds and creams. However, the film alters the painting’s colour composition, dressing her in oranges and reds and thereby doubly linking the female victim to Marion.4 An examination of the key changes to the shower scene show that it can no longer be read as the return of the repressed. Hitchcock famously presents Norman as a shadow on the other side of the translucent white shower curtain, using backlighting to construct him as a dark silhouette once the barrier is pulled away. The silhouette conjoins Norman with his disguise, the shape of the wig altering the contours of his face and head, thereby expressing his psychic fusion and confusion with Mother. Indeed, the use of the silhouette with its connotations of the darker double suggests the unconscious forces responsible for the crime. In Psycho 98 the refractive shower curtain distorts Norman’s outline into multiple lines of colour and light. Once the curtain is opened, Norman is not shot in silhouette. Instead, close-ups show his face through a multiplicity of veils provided by the water from the showerhead, a wispy, blonde wig and a layer of grey make-up. The assimilation of the wig into a series of layers reconstructs Norman’s cross-dressing as a disguise that is clearly assumed. The play of veils/masks foregrounds the ways in which Norman’s disguise is no longer a question of psychic depth, but rather one of the generic conventions of the presentation of the killer in the slasher movie. The shower scene in Psycho 98 contains a number of additional shots. The first medium shot of Marion in front of the shower curtain does not herald the entrance of the killer, acting instead as a teaser for the audience. More controversially, van Sant inserts two new long shots of stormy skies featuring fast time-lapse clouds while Marion is being stabbed. These clearly reference his own work, specifically the presentation of the open road in My Own Private Idaho (1991) (MacDowell 2008). Within the diegetic world of the film, the two shots link back to the long shot of Marion driving towards the hills, acting as subjective expressions of her fantasy of escape. Importantly, the shower scene uses a match of colour and movement to convey the loss of this transcendental fantasy of total freedom, however hackneyed, at the moment of death. Thus, the blue-greys of the scurrying time-lapse clouds match the rapidly receding strands of colour in the extreme close-up of Marion’s iris dilating at the point of unconsciousness. Her final collapse is followed by a reprise of Hitchcock’s famous graphic match, the dissolve from the extreme close-up of the blood swirling down the plug hole to the extreme close-up of Marion’s dead eye. In Psycho 60 the camera’s rotation on the second close-up emphasizes the visceral physicality of Marion’s obliteration, her identity swirling away down the drain. By contrast, van Sant doubles the camera’s rotation on the second extreme close-up, drawing attention to the two very different metaphors for extinguishing life offered in Psycho 98.\n\n32\n\nADAPTATION IN CONTEMPORARY CULTURE\n\nThe juxtaposition of the two different metaphors culled from different films is an example of the ‘combinatory culture’ of the remake that Baudrillard dismisses as incapable of creating new meanings (1994: 45). Ultimately, the technical and machinic perfection of the remake constructs it as pure surface – the signifier without the signified, form without content. For Rothman, van Sant’s reprise of Hitchcock’s gestures transforms them into non-gestures that are devoid of significance. Both theorists, somewhat surprisingly, share the conception of the move to surface as the voiding of depth and thus of all meaning. In contrast, I have followed a double line of argument: demonstrating the ways in which Psycho 98 offers a relentless superficiality through the advertising of the secret, the circumventing of opposition, and the voiding of psychoanalytic depths; while also setting up different symbolic motifs through its deployment of bright pastel colours, performance style and road-movie references. Psycho 98 displays the way in which playing with the surface creates the possibility of new meanings, changing the stolid, bourgeois Marion into a postmodern subject whose fragile fantasy of escape is constructed via movie references. Finally, the film, like its shower curtain, acts as a refractive lens, enabling us to look back to Psycho 60 and appreciate it anew as a collaborative achievement for Hitchcock, Leigh and Perkins.\n\nNotes 1.\n\nFrom this point onwards I will adopt Verevis’ technique of distinguishing between the film and its remake by referring to them as Psycho 60 and Psycho 98 (Verevis 2006). This enables me to avoid replicating the evaluative binary original/copy. 2. The three critics were Paula Cohen, Steven Schneider and Constantine Verevis, whose articles appeared in the Hitchcock Annual 2001–2 (Leitch 2003). 3. Schneider uses van Sant’s casting of Heche to offer a queer reading of the murder as the result of Norman’s rage at Marion’s lesbian indifference to him (2001–2: 145–7). 4.

Writing in Remakes, Constantine Verevis has noted how ‘the forging of a canon of films and film makers by auteur critics [has] enabled allusion to film history . . . to become a major expressive device’ (2006: 62) in contemporary film; indeed, the radical reinscription of hidden sexual and racial histories effected by Haynes in Far From Heaven would seem to confirm its status as a creative intervention, rather than commercial replication, of a past cultural text. However, as notable as the film’s departure from the narrative parameters of 1950s melodrama is Haynes’s extraordinary fidelity to the cinematic sensibility of the Sirkian original. To place this paradox in the critical discourse of adaptation studies, Far From Heaven is both ‘faithful’ and ‘free’. Questions of authorship, canon and cultural memory are integral to an understanding of the significance of Haynes’s return to a historical film genre, issues which are equally central to the consideration of literary adaptations. By considering Far From Heaven in the context of adaptation studies I wish to suggest some affinities between the critical recuperation of the remake and the emergence of adaptation studies as a significant field in contemporary film, media and literary studies. More specifically, by reflecting on fidelity as manifested in Far From Heaven I wish to revisit the contested status of fidelity within adaptation studies; I will explore the relationship between fidelity and affect, and suggest that the fate of fidelity is implicated in a gendered cultural politics. The fidelity demonstrated in Haynes’s Far From Heaven – which is at once affecting and affected without forfeiting its sincerity – is indicative of a mode of cultural production and consumption which is neither passive nor derivative, but active and productive. The remake and the adaptation can both be considered genres of film or television production which have suffered a compromised\n\nFIDELITY AND AFFECT IN FAR FROM HEAVEN\n\n35\n\ncritical status. The commercial motivations at work in recreating a work with an established audience or readership, and its apparently derivative relationship to a prior cultural production, have served to cast into doubt the artistic integrity of these genres; where originality and creative autonomy prevail as criteria of evaluation, the remake and the adaptation tend, by definition, to be found wanting. However, both genres have been subject to critical reappraisal. Where studies of adaptation are concerned, the extensive and expanding published work on adaptations, emerging both from film and media studies and from literary studies, has not merely achieved the critical recuperation of the study of (mostly literary) adaptations; it has also seemingly begun to inaugurate adaptation studies as a disciplinary field. The frequency with which studies of adaptation rehearse the history of its origins, revisit formative critical debates and reiterate a canon of founding works is suggestive of the evolution of a nascent disciplinary infrastructure. While work on the remake is, as yet, less extensive than that on adaptation (see Verevis 2006; Horton and McDougal 1998; Forrest and Koos 2002), instructive parallels can be drawn in terms of the strategies employed in the service of critical recuperation. On the one hand are efforts to define the object of study – whether the remake or the adaptation – as a genre in its own right and deserving of interpretative frameworks appropriate to its concerns; this strategy attends closely to specificities of production and consumption, and is inclined towards the production of critical and generic taxonomies. On the other hand are efforts to demonstrate the ways in which these cultural forms exemplify key issues in contemporary culture, especially those to do with intertextuality. One implicit, and rather paradoxical, effect of this strategy is to seem to argue for the abolition of adaptation or remake studies as such, but to do so by suggesting that in some fundamental way all cultural forms are themselves ‘remade’ or ‘adapted’. For example, in relation to the adaptation, James Naremore argues that The study of adaptation needs to be joined with the study of recycling, remaking, and every other form of retelling in the age of mechanical reproduction and electronic communication. By this means, adaptation will become part of a general theory of repetition, and adaptation study will move from the margins to the centre of contemporary media studies.
