The thing I did in November, he (head writer Steven Moffat) wrote it the night before.\n\n“I was with Steven Moffat and John Hurt the other night and it was lovely because he can field those questions!\"\n\nMore Liverpool news\n\nMan viciously attacked with 'machete' following car chase through city streets\n\nLive: Build-up to The Open championship at Hoylake\n\nWhere to spot the celebrities in Hoylake and West Kirby for The Open golf championship\n\nNew Mayoral 100 Club launched to fund Mersey River Festivals\n\nWATCH: Video shows bloodied man as police investigate Seel Street brawl\n\nMulti-million pound revamp for Clayton Square shopping centre in Liverpool\n\nPolice turned down request from FA for Liverpool FC fans to be given larger end of Hillsborough stadium\n\nLatest updates in our breaking news live blog throughout the day\n\nKeep up-to-date with the latest Liverpool news & sport by using the ECHO's mobile app: click here for iPhone and here for android phones"
