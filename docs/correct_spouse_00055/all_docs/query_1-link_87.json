        "text": "Before I start a deep dive into Sapphire and Steel, I am talk about their creator.\n\nPeter J. Hammond, credited mostly as PJ Hammond.\n\nUnlike the screenwriters and other authors of today, there is very little biographical information in the public domain, about Mr Hammond. I am guessing that people back when he first started just wanted the work he to speak for itself. So the only personal fact I can find, this that was born sometime in the 1930 which would make him 91 years old. (as of 2021)\n\nI do believe he is actively still writing as, the last professional credit I can find for him is a Amazon Kindle book called Downtimes published in 2018. But I am getting a head of myself.\n\nMr Hammond’s television writing begins in the late part of the 1960’s on three BBC programmes Thirty Minute Theatre, Ramshackle Road and Adventure Weekly, He would then move on to the police drama Z-cars a show that would try to bridge the gap between the cosy view the reality of police life. He would have writing credits for 33 of 801 shows. For the next two years he would write for Manhunt, Trial, Six Days Of Justice, Villains and The Hole in the Wall bouncing from ITV and the BBC.\n\nIt was with ITV’s children show Ace of Wands he would spend most of 1972 writing 13 episodes of the show, and for the rest of the 1970’s he would write mainly for ITV, contributing to the following shows Hunter’s Walk, Crime of Passion, Armchair Theatre, Oranges & Lemons, New Scotland Yard. Returning to the BBC for Spy Trap and Dixon of Dock Green.\n\nAs you tell for most the titles of those show he wrote for, they were for the most part crime and mystery stories, or stories which while on surface run of the mill there end would anything but. By 1975 he was once again crossing over to ITV and back over to the BBC, starting with five episodes of prison drama Within These Walls, one of Special Branch, one episode of Dial M for Murder for the BBC, one episode of Rooms, four episodes of the hospital drama Angles once again a BBC programme.\n\nHe returned to ITV for Couples, The Sweeney, The Professionals, Crown Court, Shadows. Then a quick single episode for the BBC show Target and then back to ITV for Hazell. It was now 1979 and Mr Hammond had built up enough of a good working relationship with Associatied Television network for them to provide the the money for a idea original conceived under the title of The Time Menders, after a stay in a haunted castle. It would later be called Sapphire and Steel run for 34 episodes between 10 July 1979 and 31 Angust 1982, he would write all but two episodes.\n\nHowever by 1982 he was writing of other people shows again six episodes of The Gentle Touch, but he did have other go at solo writing this time a situation comedy for BBC2 called Lake Ducks from 1984 – 1985. He then once again between 1986 – 1998 moved around taking on writing work from all the major television network focusing mainly on light drama or police procedurals, Unnatural Causes, Emmerdale Farm, EastEnders, Perfect Scoundrels, Dr Finlay, Dangerfield, Wycliffe. Where all show he had hand in, In 1998 he was then approach by Sky Television and German channel Vox to join other well-known writer to contribute to a science fiction television series called Space Island one, created by Andrew MacLear.\n\nMystery writing was still his driving and in 1999 he worked on the Ruth Rendell Mystery for ITV stay with the network for eight episodes of Midsomer Murders, his last being in 2011, however as he was worked on Midsomer, show runner Russell T Davies (having successfully brought back Doctor Who) got Mr Hammond to pen two episodes of Torchwood 2006’s Small Worlds and 2008’s From Out of The Rain. And thanks rothe nature of television work, one of his Midsomer Murders episodes was shown at the exact same time as his first Torchwood episode, on the competing networks.\n\nThis wasn’t the first time Mr Hammond had written for the world of Dr Who, in fact he had outlined a story for Colin Baker’s incarnation of the doctor in the late 1980’s called Paradise Five but it was rejected by John Nathan-Turner however in 2010 Big Finish audio production stepped and produce it, incorporating it into the Lost Stories collection.\n\nBig Finish would also acquire permission and rights from him and ITV, and between 2004 and 2005 produced 15 Sapphire and Steel audio dramas but unlike the show Mr Hammond would not write them, leaving that to Big Finish’s in house writing team. (all that will be coved in more detail and depth a up coming post)\n\nSo that’s the brief professional history of Peter J. Hammond, a writer who’s name you may not know but most certainly are familiar with his work, and with like all good crafts people very skilled in what he does. Like I said at the beginning I do believe that he’s still actively working, whether it’s on novels or television yet to be shown or reworking something different from he’s past. Mr Peter J. Hammond, thank you\n\nIn next post I will be taking a deeper look into the first assignment of Sapphire and Steel, and trying to work why after all this time it still seems so scary.\n\nShow and Physical Media Timeline\n\n10 July 1979 Episode One first Aired\n\n17 August 1982 Last Episode Aried\n\n(Assignments 1 2 3 4 and 6 written by P J Hammond however Assignment 5 was written by Don Houghton and Anthony Read)\n\nJuly 1979 Star Books published a novelisation of the first assignment written by P J Hammond.\n\n1980 One 63 page Annual\n\n1979 – 1981 Two page comics , serialised in The Look In comic 14 new stories (Augus Allen and Arthur Ranson)\n\n1992/1993 the series was released on VHS in double packs two videos covering each Adventure / Assignment in turn Six box sets in all.\n\n2005 – 2008 Big Finish audio production produce 15 new stories.\n\n2007 a DVD boxset was released in partnership with Granada Ventures Ltd and Network, it has all the comple episodes (edited and restored from the original print as opposed to the VHS), which contained the following several special features\n\nA new 2007 documentary Counting Out of Time featuring both main actors, P J Hammond and Director Shaun O’Riordan.\n\nCommentaries on the first and last episodes with P J Hammond and Shaun O’Riordan\n\nPR and Episode stills\n\nPDF Script\n\nAnd a 1980’s edition of television chat show Wogan hosted by Joanna Lumley interviewing David McCallum.\n\nOver the years there has been talk of a remake or movie, but each time the idea has fallen through, first because a remake of 1960s show The Prisoner face quite a backlash and second in 2017 it not considered viable proposition because of the limited fan base of the original series.\n\nIt unknown at this point in time who owns the right to Sapphire and Steel as Mr Hammond has not said anything about the show for some time. And when questioned about reviving the audio series managing director of Big Finish Jason Haigh Ellery said they no longer held the licence to produce them, adding it would be hard to get hold of it again. The person asking the question was former Doctor Who star Paul McGann, he also propose the scenario where him and Alex Kingston would take overthe previous, cast Susannah Harker and David Warner (Big Finish Day live streaming event 1 August 2020 which can be found on their YouTube channel)\n\nJust as I finish writing this, I found out that the British Forces broadcasting service under the Name Forces TV are showing Sapphire and Steel on their channel beginning on Mon 18 2021 at 11:00 pm it can be found at the following channel numbers Freesat 165 Freeview 96 Sky 181 Virgin Media 274, the Forces TV as well as here in the United Kingdom they broadcast in Brunei, Canada, Cyprus, Germany, Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands."
