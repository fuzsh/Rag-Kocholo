        "text": "Harry Pollitt (born Nov. 22, 1890, Droylsden, Lancashire, Eng.—died June 27, 1960, at sea en route from Australia to England) was a British Communist, general secretary (1929–39, 1941–56) and chairman (1956–60) of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB).\n\nPollitt’s father was a factory worker and trade unionist and his mother a weaver. At age 13 (1903) he left school to work in the local textile mill and eventually became a boilermaker and a leader in the boilermakers union. He helped found the CPGB in 1920 and went to Moscow in 1921 to attend a congress of the Third International, where he met Vladimir Lenin. In 1925 he was sentenced to a year’s imprisonment for seditious libel and incitement to mutiny. (In 1934 he was acquitted in another sedition trial.) In 1929 he became head of his party as general secretary.\n\nPollitt enthusiastically supported Britain’s declaration of war against Germany on Sept. 3, 1939; but when Russia invaded Poland two weeks later, the official Moscow line changed, and Pollitt was caught in an embarrassing contradiction. He was removed from the secretaryship. Following the outbreak of war between Germany and the Soviet Union in June 1941, however, Pollitt was returned to leadership of the party."
