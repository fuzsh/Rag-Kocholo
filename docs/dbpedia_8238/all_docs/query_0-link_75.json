Central to the volume is a comparative analysis of the communist parties of three British dominions, South Africa, Canada and Australia, demonstrating how each party attempted to follow Moscowâ€™s lead and how each party produced its own attempts to deal with these issues locally, while considering the limits of their own agency within the movement at large.\n\nIntroduction Part One: Part One: The Communist International and the National, Colonial, and Racial Questions 1. The Comintern and the National and Colonial Questions 2. The Communist International and Race Part Two: The National, Colonial, and Racial Questions in Individual Communist Parties 3. The Communist Party of South Africa 4. The Communist Party of Canada 5. The Communist Party of Australia Conclusion"
