        "text": "Whilst the Chinese Communist Party is one of the most powerful political institutions in the world, it is also one of the least understood, due to the party’s secrecy and tight control over the archives, the press and the Internet. Having governed the People’s Republic of China for nearly 70 years though, much interest remains into how this quintessentially Leninist party governs one-fifth of the world and runs the world’s second-largest economy.\n\nThe Routledge Handbook of the Chinese Communist Party gives a comprehensive and multi-faceted picture of the party’s traditions and values – as well as its efforts to stay relevant in the twenty-first century. It uses a wealth of contemporary data and qualitative analysis to explore the intriguing relationship between the party on the one hand, and the government, the legal and judicial establishment and the armed forces, on the other. Tracing the influence of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin, as well as Mao Zedong, on contemporary leaders ranging from Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin to Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping, the sections cover:\n\nthe party’s history and traditions;\n\nhow the party works and seeks to remain relevant;\n\nmajor policy arenas;\n\nthe CCP in the twenty-first century.\n\nThe Routledge Handbook of the Chinese Communist Party will be of interest to students and scholars of Chinese Politics, Asian Politics, Political Parties and International Relations.\n\nGo to https://www.bookshop4u.com/lw1 to see Willy Lam introduce the book.\n\nOverview and Introduction 1.

Willy Wo-Lap Lam has assembled an unrivalled group of China scholars and produced one of the most illuminating volumes on contemporary China.\"\n\nMinxin Pei, Claremont McKenna College\n\n\"In this edited collection, veteran China specialist Willy Lam has assembled a diverse group of authors who dissect the various elements and instruments in CCP rule. Taken together, they offer a fairly comprehensive examination of the Chinese Communist Party's evolution over time and approaches to different sectors of society. The section on 'how the party works' is particularly valuable. All China watchers will find value in this volume.\"\n\nDavid Shambaugh, George Washington University\n\n\"As usual, the deeply perceptive Willy Lam provides what is almost certainly the best guide to the current state of China, the problems with which her leaders must grapple most importantly.\"\n\nArthur Waldron, University of Pennsylvania"
