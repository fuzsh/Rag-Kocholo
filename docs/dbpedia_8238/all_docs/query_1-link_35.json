        "text": "According to the British Foreign Office, General Erkin Tuniyaz, deputy secretary of the party committee and chairman of the government of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of the Communist Party of China will visit the UK and other European countries in mid-to-late February to meet with UK and EU officials. The UK and EU are also planning to grant Tuniyaz a diplomatic passport to avoid the possibility of him being served with a notice of indictment in order to facilitate his visit. The Foreign Office in the UK also claims to have taken a leading role in holding the Chinese government accountable, including by sanctioning officials in Xinjiang The purpose of this meeting withTuniyaz was to \"promote concrete changes on the ground\". Beyond diplomatic rhetoric, the British authorities and elites are entangled with the CCP onmany fronts of their interests.\n\nThe chain of interests and the chain of slave labour between the Chinese and British elite\n\nAccording to official CCP data, Xinjiang's import and export growth in the first ten months of 2022 was the fastest growth rate of any provincial-level unit. Xinjiang's labour-intensive products, including Xinjiang cotton and related products, account for more than half of the total value of foreign trade exports. China's cotton production and exports are the world's largest, and the Uyghur Autonomous Region accounts for 80 percent of China's total cotton. A significant amount of cotton production and other products in Xinjiang are suspected of forced labour, and these products are exported to British companies by Chinese Communist-controlled companies. According to official British data in the past two years, trade and mutual investment between China and the UK have grown rapidly. This is an area of common interest that both the Communist Party and the British government have consistently emphasized, with profits relying heavily on the value created by slave labour and other \"cheap\" labour, and the extraction of resources from the relevant areas.\n\nWhen it comes to Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other ethnic groups being forced to produce products, the British government claims to leave it up to the companies to check whether there are forced labour problems in the industrial chain, shirking its responsibility to investigate and label the list of forced labour companies and the related industrial chain. Last year, the World Uyghur Congress sued the Home Office and the Department of Revenue and Customs in the UK High Court and the Crime Department violated the law on freedom from slavery and forced labour, but the British government's intervention in the case ended the involvement of the British authorities in forced labour of investigations. The British government and privileged groups continue to work closely with the CCP to profit from modern slavery.\n\nThe CCP's modern slavery industry chain constitutes the current world system\n\nA month before his trip to Britain and EU countries, Tuniyaz made a high-profile public agenda related to such a trip. One is that he talked about accelerating Xinjiang's agricultural modernization in Aksu Prefecture. On another occasion, he with his immediate superior Ma Xingrui, Party Secretary of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, met with the Delegation of Geneva-based Envoys of Developing Countries in Urumqi, and these CCP leaders emphasized \"stability and development‚Äù. The so-called \"modernization of agriculture\" is a slogan used by the CCP for its 70-year land enclosure campaign, in conjunction with \"industrialisation\" and \"urbanisation\" measures to seize land and resources, depriving Uyghurs and Khasak farmers and herders of their basic means of production and forcing them to engage in poorly paid, assigned labour.\n\nFor the CCP, \"stability\" in the Uyghur Autonomous Region means eliminating non-Han culture and religion, establishing concentration camps for Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other Turkic Muslims in the name of education and vocational training, and creating sinicized slave labour. \"Development\" is a characteristic modernization of the CCP's denial of human rights. The modernization of this model mainly relies on the industrial chain of modern slavery, which is spread all over the world, including European and American countries.\n\nA double act between the CCP and the British government\n\nIn response to public pressure to protest the CCP's crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, the British government has selected several low-ranking CCP officials for sanction, thereby exonerating the Party Secretary and Chairman of the CCP's Xinjiang Autonomous Region, as well as officials above the level of members of the CCP's Politburo; it has also refused to allow the British judicial system to investigate and identify alleged crimes committed by the CCP in accordance with the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The British government's calculations are designed to keep the British elite and privileged class from profiting from the modern slavery industrial chain established by the CCP.\n\nThe basic social hierarchy of Han and Uyghurs can be seen in the order of party politics in Xinjiang, which also reflects the Chinese Communist Party's leadership of everything. In persecuting the Uyghurs and Kazakhs, the CCP uses these ethnic puppets to hide the hegemony of Han chauvinism, which is the main reason for choosing Tuniyaz for his visit, to get rid of the obstacles to his expansion (\"qia bo zi\").\n\nEight years ago, following Chancellor of the Exchequer Oliver Osborne's visit to Xinjiang and Xi Jinping's visit to the UK, the British political and business elite established a deeper deal with the CCP. The CCP has heavily funded major British political parties and established closer ties with them, which explains why the British government has only sanctioned low-ranking Communist Party officials and why Parliament has not investigated the CCP and its major institutions as suspected criminal entities. The UK only investigates the Public Security Bureau of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps as a criminal entity, while the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps and other CCP organizations suspected of more serious crimes against humanity are left out of the investigation so as not to compromise the interests of the British elite. These transactions have rejected public scrutiny and lack transparency. Such deals have not only helped the CCP establish and consolidate modern slavery; they have also undermined the rights of British workers, with further restrictions on the right to demonstrate and union rights, declining labor protections, and increasing government corruption and cronyism without accountability. The Communist Party has effectively exploited the existence of more elite privilege and social hierarchy in the UK than in other representative democracies to move the British system towards authoritarianism.\n\nThe British Foreign Office claims to have \"used the Tuniyazi visit to push for concrete change on the ground\". However, the changes that the British government has chosen to promote in collusion with the CCP‚Äôs puppets will only lead to further enslavement and a further human rights disaster. Tuniyaz's rise to the chairman of the XUAR is closely linked to his 15 years as a party official in Xinjiang, where he has faithfully implemented the CCP's repressive policies.\n\nTuniyaz's visit to Britain is a double-crossing propaganda farce between the CCP and the British government, demonstrating the British government's continued collaboration with the CCP dictatorship to profit from the British elite in the modern slave-like world system created by the CCP.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotes: the article was written on 11 February 2023 in Chinese.
