        "text": "VERSAILLES, France, Jan. 12 (UPI) -- Jessica Davies, niece of British Defense Minister Quentin Davies, was sentenced to 15 years in a French prison Tuesday for killing a man she met in a bar.\n\nThe prosecutor told a court in Versailles outside Paris that Davies, 30, was under the influence of alcohol and several anti-depressants when she stabbed Olivier Mugnier, 24, The Daily Telegraph reported. The couple went to her apartment on Nov. 11, 2007, after meeting in a bar in St. Germaine-en-Laye, an old town and upscale suburb west of Paris.\n\n\"It was a chronicle of a death foretold,\" the prosecutor said, calling Davies a \"sulfurous seductress with the devil's beauty.\"\n\nDaniel Soulez-Lariviere, Davies' lawyer, called the killing a \"suicidal act.\" Aurelia Grignon, also representing Davies, blamed her father, Richard Davies, who left her mother, and said Davies had begged before the killing to be hospitalized.\n\nDavies could have received a 30-year prison term, but the prosecution only asked for 12, which the nine-person jury considered. She was also sentenced to 10 years probation with psychological monitoring and her family was ordered to pay damages to Mugnier's parents and twin brother."
