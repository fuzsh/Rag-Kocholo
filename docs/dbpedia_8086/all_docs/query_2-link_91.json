        "text": "âAs a teenager,â says Bishop DeanÂ M. Davies, âhaving the best-cut lawn in our neighborhood brought joy to me, and I learned an important lesson: that a little extra effort can make a real difference in almost everything we do.â Giving a little extra has become a standard that will continue to serve him well as the new First Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric.\n\nBishop Davies had been serving as Second Counselor to Bishop GaryÂ E. Stevenson, who was sustained as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on October 3, 2015.\n\nDean Myron Davies was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA, in 1951. He grew up as one of eight children. He expresses gratitude for parents who not only loved and nurtured their children but also helped them appreciate the blessings of work. He married Darla James in 1973, in the Salt Lake Temple. They have 5 children and 14 grandchildren.\n\nBishop Davies also learned an important lesson while living in San Francisco, California, USA, in 1989. During an earthquake, he witnessed the severe damage to apartments built without a sure foundation. âPondering the events of that day reaffirms in my mind and heart that in order to successfully withstand the tempests, earthquakes, and calamities of life, we must build upon a sure foundation â¦ the foundation of Jesus Christâ (âA Sure Foundation,â Ensign or Liahona, May 2013, 9).\n\nBishop Davies has been employed by the Church since July 1995. Most recently he was managing director of the Special Projects Department, with responsibility for special-purpose real estate, temple design, and temple construction.\n\nPrevious to Church employment, Bishop Davies worked for High Industries, Inc., of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and Bechtel Investments, Inc., of San Francisco, California. He earned a bachelorâs degree in agricultural economics at Brigham Young University and completed advanced executive programs at Stanford and Northwestern Universities.\n\nBishop Davies has served as president of the Puerto Rico San Juan Mission, mission presidentâs counselor, stake president, stake presidentâs counselor, stake executive secretary, high councilor, in several bishoprics, and as a full-time missionary in the Uruguay/Paraguay Mission."
