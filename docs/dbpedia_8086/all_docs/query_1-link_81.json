        "text": "Almost 100 years ago, 250 soldiers were buried\n\nbehind enemy lines in unmarked mass graves on the\n\noutskirts of the village of Fromelles, Northern\n\nFrance. They were among several thousand\n\nAustralian and British soldiers who were killed in the\n\nBattle of Fromelles on the 19th and 20th July 1916,\n\nmany of whom have no marked grave. This volume\n\ndescribes Oxford Archaeology’s contribution to a\n\njoint Australian and British government mission to\n\nrecover the soldiers and re-bury them with full\n\nmilitary honours in a new Commonwealth War\n\nGraves Cemetery in Fromelles. Bringing together an\n\ninternational team of forensic and investigative\n\nprofessionals, Oxford Archaeology, under the\n\nmanagement of the Commonwealth War Graves\n\nCommission, excavated and scientifically examined\n\nthe mortal remains of the soldiers and associated\n\nitems buried with them. With the full support and\n\ncooperation of the soldiers’ families, this evidence\n\nwas, and continues to be, employed alongside DNA\n\nand historical sources in an attempt to identify the\n\nsoldiers by name for their commemoration on\n\nheadstones. This volume is a technical synthesis of\n\nOxford Archaeology's work on this landmark project\n\ninvolving the largest recovery and identification\n\noperation of First World War soldiers ever carried out\n\nusing modern science. It also includes detail of the\n\nidentification process undertaken by appropriately\n\nexperienced government advisors.\n\nThe operation commenced in May 2009.\n\nReverend Ray Jones of St George’s Memorial\n\nChurch in Ypres led a service and Defence Minister\n\nQuentin Davies formally initiated the project. With\n\njust six months to complete the work, and under\n\nintense media scrutiny, innovative techniques were\n\ndevised to meet the unique requirements of the\n\nproject. A special site compound was designed to\n\nintegrate the different elements – excavation,\n\nrecovery and analysis – of the project, computer\n\nsoftware was developed to help interpret commingled\n\nremains, and a forensic ‘chain of custody’\n\napproach meant that human remains and associated\n\nartefacts had to be signed for whenever they were\n\nmoved. In these respects the project broke new\n\nground and has arguably become the ‘gold\n\nstandard’ for projects of this nature in the future.\n\nThe graves, eight in total, were excavated over a\n\nperiod of four months. The responsibility of recovering,\n\nanalysing and interpreting them was keenly\n\nfelt among the team, prompting periods of deep\n\nreflection on the battle and warfare in general, and\n\nfostering a strong determination to do justice to the\n\nevidence and ultimately to the individuals\n\nthemselves.\n\nPrecisely how many soldiers would be found was\n\nunknown; preliminary investigations suggested\n\n400, while over 1650 soldiers were listed as missing.\n\nSoil was meticulously removed, first by a small\n\nmechanical digger and then using specialist hand\n\ntools, to expose individuals (all practically skeletonised)\n\nand artefacts. Teeth and bones were\n\nsampled for DNA and all evidence was comprehensively\n\nrecorded before being lifted and transported\n\nto the temporary mortuary. All the graves were\n\nhighly complex deposits, prone to water infiltration\n\nand requiring the exposure of as many individuals\n\nas possible before they could be recorded and lifted\n\nin a timely and accurate manner, while maintaining\n\nthe dignity of the deceased at all times. This, in\n\naddition to robust water management systems,\n\nsampling strategies, and two- and three-dimensional\n\nrecording by photography, survey and\n\nwritten record, meant that it was possible to recover\n\ndiscrete individuals and make secure associations\n\nbetween the individuals and artefacts. This was of\n\nfundamental importance to the identification\n\nprocess and is presented through fully illustrated\n\ndescriptions in this volume.\n\nFive graves were found to contain between 44\n\nand 52 individuals each, buried in two layers with\n\nthe majority lying across the width of the graves.\n\nOne grave contained just three individuals lying\n\none on top of the other, and two graves contained\n\nno individuals at all. Other findings, while not\n\ndirectly relevant to identification of the individuals,\n\nprovided important contextual information on the\n\nprocess of burial in 1916. Chalk lumps and lime,\n\nfound in all the occupied graves, attest to attempts\n\nto sanitise them before they were backfilled, while\n\ngroundsheets and cable appear to have been used to\n\nassist with the interments. In addition, fly pupae\n\nsuggest that the bodies had been buried, or the\n\ngraves had been backfilled, between five and ten\n\ndays after the battle had taken place.\n\nAnthropological and artefactual analyses ran in\n\nparallel to the excavation inside a temporary\n\nmortuary adjacent to the site. Each individual was\n\nexamined one at a time at a workstation, which was\n\nequipped with overhead cameras used to take\n\nphotographs of each skeleton from the same fixed\n\npoint throughout the duration of the project. Images\n\nwere downloaded onto computers, which also\n\ncontained, for each individual, associated survey\n\nand finds data, the bespoke project database and\n\ndigital radiographs. This real-time archaeological\n\nrecording and analysis was invaluable, helping the\n\nteam manage the constant flow of information and\n\nensuring that the works were completed on time.\n\nDespite the wealth of documents, including\n\nletters, diaries and photographs that relate to the\n\nBattle of Fromelles, the artefacts and skeletons tell\n\nperhaps the most personal stories about what\n\nhappened on the 19th/20th July 1916. All the skeletons\n\nwere in good or excellent condition, allowing a\n\nhigh level of biological and personal identification\n\ninformation to be obtained. As expected, the skeletons\n\nexhibited extensive wounding from the battlefield\n\n(blast, projectile and sharp-force lesions),\n\ntestimony to the bravery of the men who fought at\n\nFromelles. Horrific in nature, this could be important\n\nidentification evidence when considered alongside\n\neye-witness accounts held by the British Red\n\nCross, and is enormously helpful to forensic pathologists\n\ntoday, who work to achieve justice for victims\n\nof armed conflict.\n\nMany soldiers were in their teens, the youngest\n\napproximately 14 years old, but there were also\n\nolder individuals aged up to at least 50 years. They\n\nhad an average height of 1.72 metres, which is\n\nabove the height restrictions in place for enlistment\n\nin 1916. The majority were Caucasoid, but at least\n\none was of mixed European and Aboriginal\n\nancestry. Despite considerable breakage of bones, it\n\nwas possible to make detailed records of the facial\n\nattributes of a good number of individuals. Antemortem\n\npathology and trauma were consistent with\n\na group of individuals who had died prematurely in\n\ntheir prime. There was a low rate of joint disease\n\nand other conditions that are normally associated\n\nwith old age. Congenital abnormalities were\n\nfrequent and the dental work was varied and extensive.\n\nHealed fractures, activity related bony\n\nchanges, dental fillings and chronic disease were\n\nalso recorded, and these could make an important\n\ncontribution to identification where they were\n\nsupported by enlistment documentation.\n\nWhen the burials took place in 1916, identity\n\ndiscs and personal effects were collected and sent\n\nback to the Red Cross and military intelligence. As\n\nsuch, it was expected that a limited range of\n\nartefacts would be found. However, approximately\n\n5900 artefacts were recovered and analysed for\n\nidentification information with the assistance of\n\nradiography. Consisting primarily of items the\n\nsoldiers happened to be carrying with them at their\n\ntime of death, they included both military and\n\npersonal effects. The majority were the remains of\n\nuniforms, such as insignia, buttons and belt buckles,\n\nthe last item playing an important part in identifying\n\nthe army for which individuals served. There\n\nwere seven items that bore a name and were associated\n\nwith individuals, although the association was\n\nnot always strong. Perhaps some of the most\n\npoignant artefacts to be found were an unused\n\nreturn train ticket from Freemantle to Perth, which\n\nhad been tucked inside a gas mask, and a lock of\n\nhair, contained within a leather heart.\n\nAll the recovered evidence was collated into\n\nconfidential case reports, one for each soldier, for\n\nthe identification commission, which convened\n\nannually over five years, beginning in 2010. A data\n\nanalysis team, which comprised subject matter\n\nexperts, including a representative from OA,\n\ncollated this information with historical records and\n\nDNA results from living families and the deceased.\n\nThis was a fundamental part of the identification\n\nprocess and employed a methodology devised\n\nspecifically for this project – the first attempt at\n\nhistoric identifications on a large scale.\n\nTo date, a total of 144 Australian soldiers have\n\nbeen identified by name. Of the remaining 106\n\nsoldiers, 75 are considered to have served for the\n\nAustralian Army, two for the British Army and 29\n\nremain ‘known unto God'. Work to identify these\n\nsoldiers by name will continue under the auspices\n\nof each country.\n\nAll the soldiers have now been re-buried with full\n\nmilitary honours in individual graves at Fromelles\n\n(Pheasant Wood) Military Cemetery, the first CWGC\n\ncemetery to be built in 50 years. The first and last\n\nburials to take place were marked by ceremonies\n\nheld in January 2010 and on 19th July 2010. At the\n\nlatter ceremony, held on the 94th anniversary of the\n\nBattle of Fromelles, a dedication service was held\n\nand the last soldier, presently unidentified, was\n\nreburied. The ceremony was attended by HRH the\n\nPrince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, the\n\nHonourable Dame Quentin Bryce, then Governor-\n\nGeneral of the Commonwealth of Australia, HRH\n\nthe Duke of Kent, President of the CWGC, families\n\nof the Missing and the buried soldiers, residents of\n\nFromelles, members of the French, Australian and\n\nBritish governments and armed forces, and\n\nmembers of the various organisations who have\n\nworked on the project.\n\nFor Oxford Archaeology, which has investigated\n\nthousands of archaeological burials, including mass\n\ngraves, it has been a great privilege to work on the\n\nFromelles project. At all times the soldiers’ mortal\n\nremains were treated with the utmost dignity and\n\nrespect, with high regard shown for the sensitivities\n\ninvolved in a project of this nature. The information\n\nin this volume has been provided in this spirit and in\n\nrecognition of the Fromelles Management Board's\n\nconditions for information release (as far as a reasonable\n\nperson would interpret them). An operation\n\nsuch as this clearly has a very important contribution\n\nto make to future, similar, projects and multiple disciplines\n\nin general. Every attempt has been made to\n\nrealise this as far as possible here, although some\n\ninformation (for example, images and specialist\n\ncatalogues) has, by necessity, been omitted or altered.\n\nEver since the recovery operation began, and\n\ngiven the sensitivities involved, limited information\n\nhas been revealed up till now about how this\n\nproject, aiming to recover and identify some of the\n\nMissing of Fromelles, was undertaken, what was\n\nfound and how the information was employed to\n\nidentify individuals. This volume is the comprehensive\n\naccount of that work. Ultimately, however, this\n\nis a story of the soldiers, their bravery and sacrifice.\n\nIndividuals remembered."
