        "text": "Miss Davies, the 30-year-old niece of Quentin Davies, the Defence Minister, looked pale and drawn as she arrived at a court in Versailles, west of Paris, on the first day of her trial.\n\nDressed in jeans and a grey cardigan, her hair pulled back in a ponytail, she showed no emotion as the charge sheet was read out before the three judges and nine-member jury.\n\nIn November 2007, police arrived at her apartment in the chic Paris suburb of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and found the body of Olivier Mugnier who had been stabbed and whose throat had been slit, according to the indictment.\n\nMiss Davies then told police: \"I did it. I can't tell you why, but I did it. I am a monster\", the court heard.\n\nShe had picked up Mugnier in a bar hours earlier and after taking him to her apartment, contacted police to say she had stabbed the 24-year-old man, justice officials said.\n\nMiss Davies arrived at the courthouse in a police van and rushed into the courtroom where her parents were present as were the victim's family.\n\nThe trial is expected to last just two days, with a verdict due on Tuesday.\n\nShe faces a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison if convicted of voluntary homicide without premeditation.\n\nMiss Davies, born in London to a British father and a French mother, was reportedly depressed after splitting up with her French boyfriend, with whom she had shared the one-bedroom flat for four years.\n\nShe was reported to have attempted suicide a few months before the murder of Mugnier.\n\nOn the Saturday night before Mugnier's death she was seen drinking pints of beer and shots of spirits in O'Sullivan's Irish pub in Saint-Germain-en-Laye."
