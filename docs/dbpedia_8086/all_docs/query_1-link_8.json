        "text": "John Quentin Davies (born 29 May 1944) is a British Labour politician, who has been the Member of Parliament for Grantham and Stamford since 1987. Originally elected as a Conservative, he defected to Labour on 26 June 2007. Davies is currently a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Ministry of Defence responsible for Defence Equipment and Support.\n\nQuentin Davies was born in Oxford, the son of a doctor who had been in the Royal Air Force (RAF) in World War II (being stationed for a time at Grantham). He went to the local preparatory Dragon School, before attending the Quaker Leighton Park School, Reading. He attended Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he was awarded a first class Bachelor of Arts degree in history in 1966 and was a Frank Knox Fellow at Harvard University.\n\nAfter his education, he joined the diplomatic service and was appointed Third Secretary at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 1967, and became a Second Secretary at HM Embassy Moscow in 1969, before returning to London as one of several First Secretaries at the Foreign Office in 1972."
