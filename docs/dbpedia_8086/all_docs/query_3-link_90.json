        "text": "Study objective: Work-related musculoskeletal symptoms (WMSs) are reported to be increasing in surgeons performing minimally invasive procedures. Therefore, we investigated the use of inertial measurement units (IMUs) and electromyography (EMG) sensor recorders to record real-time information on the muscle movement/activity required to perform training exercises in simulated in normal and high body mass index (BMI) models.\n\nDesign: Prospective study.\n\nSetting: University hospital.\n\nParticipants: Four consultant gynecologic oncology surgeons experienced in complex straight-stick (SS) laparoscopic and robotically assisted (RA) surgery.\n\nInterventions: Three exercises (hoops onto pegs and wire chase) using SS and RA surgery on 2 abdominal models: normal BMI and high BMI.\n\nMeasurements and main results: We measured time to complete exercise and surgeon muscle movement/activity. The time to complete all exercises was significantly lower for RA surgery as compared with SS laparoscopy (p <.05 or better). The movement of the surgeons' core was significantly greater in high BMI SS laparoscopy compared with normal BMI SS laparoscopy for exercises 1 and 2 (p <.001). Muscle usage, as determined by EMG peak, was significantly higher in normal BMI SS laparoscopy and even higher in high BMI SS laparoscopy but was generally flat for all normal and high BMI RA surgery exercises (p <.05 or better)."
