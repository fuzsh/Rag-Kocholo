        "text": "Burundi, a small but geographically diverse country, nestles in East Africa's Great Lakes region. With an area of approximately 10,745 square miles (27,830 square kilometers), it shares its borders with three countries: Rwanda to the north, Tanzania to the east and south, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west. Lake Tanganyika, Africa's deepest and the world's second deepest freshwater lake, marks the southwestern boundary of Burundi.\n\nThe geography of Burundi comprises four major regions: the Central Plateau, the Eastern Plateau, the Northern Plateau, and the Western Rift Valley. Each region exhibits distinctive geographical features and biodiversity.\n\nThe Central Plateau, covering the heart of the country, constitutes a rolling landscape with elevations averaging around 5,600 feet (1,700 meters). This region serves as a watershed, providing for several rivers, including the Ruvyironza, often considered the most distant source of the Nile.\n\nAdjacent to the Central Plateau, the Eastern Plateau, characterized by its lower elevations, gradually descends towards the Tanzanian border. This region bears less fertile soils and experiences a warmer, drier climate compared to the rest of the country.\n\nNorth of the Central Plateau, the Northern Plateau exhibits a more mountainous terrain. It features the Kibira National Park, a large tract of mountain rainforest that runs along the ridge of the Congo-Nile Divide. The park, home to diverse wildlife and plant species, including a significant number of primates, is a critical component of Burundi's natural heritage.\n\nThe Western Rift Valley, also known as the Albertine Rift, encompasses Lake Tanganyika and its steep, mountainous borders. It showcases breathtaking landscapes with its soaring mountains, some exceeding 8,000 feet (2,440 meters). The region is a part of the East African Rift System, and Lake Tanganyika itself is one of the major bodies of water in this system.\n\nSeveral significant rivers flow through Burundi, including the Ruvubu, Kagera, and the Malagarasi. The Ruvubu River, the longest river in the country, flows eastward into Tanzania, merging with the Kagera River. Interestingly, the Kagera River, part of the upper headwaters of the Nile, solidifies Burundi's connection to the longest river in the world. The Malagarasi River, on the other hand, is notable for being the longest river flowing into Lake Tanganyika."
