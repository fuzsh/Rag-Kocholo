        "text": "Understand\n\n[edit]\n\nCapital Gitega Currency Burundian franc (BIF) Population 11.5 million (2019) Electricity 220 volt / 50 hertz (Europlug, Type E) Country code +257 Time zone UTC+02:00, Africa/Bujumbura Emergencies 112 (police), 113 (fire department), 117 (emergency medical services) Driving side right\n\nBurundi is about 27,834 km2 (10,747 sq mi) large and has a population of almost 12 million people, making it one of the smallest countries in the world. Although the country is landlocked, much of the south-western border is adjacent to Lake Tanganyika, one of the deepest lakes in the world.\n\nThe region was colonised in the 19th century as part of German East Africa, then taken by Belgium after the First World War. It became independent in 1962.\n\nBurundi is one of the poorest and least developed nations in the world. The vast majority of Burundians live in poverty and work as subsistence farmers. There are many reasons behind Burundi's lack of development and poverty: civil wars, political instability, corruption, a lack of access to education, and the effects of HIV/AIDS.\n\nCobalt and copper are among the nation's natural resources. Other resources include coffee, sugar and tea.\n\nBurundi's population today is mostly comprised of the Hutu ethnic group (85%) followed by the Tutsi (14%) and Twa (1%).\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe earliest known people to live in Burundi were the Twa, a short \"pygmy\" people who remain as a minority group there. The Hutu and Tutsi people moved into the region several hundred years ago, and dominated it. Like much of Africa, Burundi then went through a period of European colonial rule. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Germany and Belgium occupied the region, and Burundi and Rwanda together became a European colony known as Ruanda-Urundi.\n\nThis ended with its independence from Belgium in 1962. In the decades since then, Burundi has known civil wars between the Hutu and Tutsi populations and genocides (much like the more notorious genocide in Rwanda to the north), and a series of political assassinations. Peace and the re-establishment of civil democracy took place in 2005 with a cease-fire and the election of former Hutu rebel Pierre Nkurunziza as president.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nBurundi in general has a tropical highland climate, with a considerable daily temperature range in many areas. Temperature also varies considerably from one region to another, chiefly as a result of differences in altitude. The central plateau enjoys pleasantly cool weather, with an average temperature of 20 °C (68 °F). The area around Lake Tanganyika is warmer, averaging 23 °C (73 °F); the highest mountain areas are cooler, averaging 16 °C (61 °F). Bujumbura’s average annual temperature is 23 °C (73 °F). Rain is irregular, falling most heavily in the north-west. Dry seasons vary in length, and there are sometimes long periods of drought. However, four seasons can be distinguished: the long dry season (June–August), the short wet season (September–November), the short dry season (December–January), and the long wet season (February–May). Most of Burundi receives between 1,300 and 1,600 mm (51 and 63 in) of rainfall a year. The Ruzizi Plain and the north-east receive between 750 and 1,000 mm (30 and 39 in).\n\nTourist information\n\n[edit]\n\nTourist information from the Burundi Embassy in the U.S.\n\nSee\n\n[edit]\n\nBujumbura is in the western part of the country. Moving towards the east, is Gitega; it’s a large market held in the middle of the town, and its Museum of Traditions (ancient utensils, pictures, commented visit). Travellers will have to make advance bookings to be able to watch an extraordinary and fascinating show unique in the world: “The Drummers of Giheta” playing in their traditional environment. Then you will be making head away towards Rutana to see the admirable panorama of the Karea Falls and the Nykazu Break, called the “Break of the Germans”, which is an exceptional lookout that oversees the Kumoso plain. You will be ending your tour by the visit of Gihofi, a booming town with its new sugar refinery in the heart of the sugar cane plantations country.\n\nTowards the South-eastern part of the country, don’t miss by any means the visit of the Nile Sources near Rutovu. Don’t forget to take your swimming gear with you; otherwise, you may miss the benefit of the hot springs in charming and subtle surroundings. You will also be able to see on your way the last traditional enclosed villas (round habitations surrounded by wooden fences strip in turn surrounded by grazing meadows and ploughed fields).\n\nFurther south, you will be able to cross a line of villages succeeding one after the other and wedged between the lake and abrupt mountains. Fortunately, you will be able to stop and have a rest, or go for nautical sports and have a meal in restaurants or simply stop for a drink, on nicely arranged fine sand beaches. Still further south lays the Nyanza Lake. Why not to take a boat and go to Tanzania on the other side of the lake and visit Gombe Natural Park?\n\nTowards the north just before reaching Bugarama, there is an important market for high quality fresh foodstuffs. You can walk across the primeval forest of Kibira the access of which is still very difficult but which is in a process of beaconing. Carry on towards Kayanza and Ngozi, two big agricultural production and trade villages. At Kirundo, near the border with Rwanda, you will discover the small lakes of the North, the peacefulness and serenity of their jagged borders. Take a boat and drift on the Rwihinda Lake to admire numerous birds’ species entirely free on the lake (crested cranes, wild ducks, fishing eagles, etc.).\n\nOn the road from Muyinga to Cankuzo, the visit of the Natural park of the Ruvuvu Rivers is a must now that is endowed with accommodation infrastructure; there you’ll be able to admire Burundi protected remnant buffaloes and dorcas (gazelles). The surrounding primeval forest will no doubt leave you with an unforgettable souvenir.\n\nLandmarks and monuments\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Bujumbura, climb to the “Belvedere” on the top of the hill, a dominating point of the town. You’ll be able to visit the mausoleum of Prince Louis Rwagasore, founder of the Uprona party and hero of the independence of Burundi.\n\nTen kilometres south of Bujumbura at Mugere is the Livingstone-Stanley Monument, a stone marking a spot where the two famous explorers David Livingstone and H. M. Stanley spent two nights on 25-27 Nov 1871 as guests of Chief Mukamba during their joint exploration of the northern end of Lake Tanganyika, following their first meeting at Ujiji, Tanzania 15 days previously.\n\n114 km from Bujumbura, on the Bujumbura-Ijenda-Matana road lays Rutovu, a town where a pyramid was erected at the southern most source of the Nile, at an altitude of 2,000 m.\n\nIt is impossible to make a list of all the places worth making a stop, as Burundi is a real Garden of Eden defying weather and exercising on people an irresistible attraction. When arriving in Bujumbura, for all your circuits, itineraries and tours go to the National Office of Tourism where a great choice are available. You will be able to see: the Nyakazu Break to the east, the Karera Falls, the Lake Tanganyika panoramas at Vyanda and Kabonambo, the tea plantations of Teza or Rwegura. The reservoir built at this place is surrounded by beautiful scenery.\n\nMuseums\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are two museums in Bujumbura and Gitega.\n\nThe second largest town in the country, Gitega, has the National Museum founded in 1955 where there is an exhibition of a magnificent ethnographic collection of objects owned by the Crown and that could be seen at the Court in the first part of the 20th century, together with an archaeological collection and historical photographs.\n\nYou will enjoy the old photographs of our kings, princes and queens of the 19th century, surrounded by lot of objects owned by men and women of those days; jewellery, baskets from all regions, earthenware for many uses, calabashes to keep water or for churning, war and hunting spears, ploughing instruments, iron-working and sculpting instruments.\n\nIn Bujumbura, the Musée Vivant near the lake presents a great part of the treasures in a wider place surrounded by magnificent gardens. Old and modern crafts are presented in beautiful small cabins. However, the masterpiece of this museum is the reconstruction in real dimensions of a royal habitation. The entire surrounding courtyard can be visited and the main hut topped by an interlaced dome covered by a think thatched roof.\n\nThe Musée Vivant also keeps up a bird house, where few local species can be seen and a Herpetological Centre, where there are displays of snakes and many species of reptiles. This living museum was regarded as one of the most renowned in Africa since its collection was opened to the public in 1988.\n\nNot all visitors will enjoy it, but it is possible to feed the crocodiles, leopard and some of the snakes in the Musée Vivant. For FBu2,000 you can buy a (live) guinea pig and select the lucky diner.\n\nWatch out for Tina the chimpanzee when visiting the Musée Vivant; she frequently escapes from her cage and can follow visitors around, this can be misconstrued as chasing. Her handlers assure she is not dangerous and just wants to play."
