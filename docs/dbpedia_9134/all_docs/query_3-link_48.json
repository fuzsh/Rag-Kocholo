This land area is approximately 111% of the area of Maryland. Burundi is thus one of the smallest countries in Africa by area and ranked 147th worldwide. With 476 inhabitants per km², it is also one of the most densely populated countries. An exceptionally high proportion of residents (86%) belong to the rural population."
