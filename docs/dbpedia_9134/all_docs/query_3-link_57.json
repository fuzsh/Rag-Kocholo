        "text": "By BBC\n\nThe Burundian parliament has voted to move the country’s capital from Bujumbura back to the ancient capital of Gitega.\n\nThe vote took place on Wednesday and the leader of parliament said the move would take place over three years.\n\nThe first to move will be the upper house of parliament, the Senate — starting on Friday.\n\nPresident Pierre Nkurunziza, who has to sign off the change, promised in 2007 to move the capital, saying Gitega was geographically more centrally placed in Burundi, AFP reports.\n\nOpposition accuse Nkurunziza of attempting a symbolic restoration as Bujumbura is today considered an opposition stronghold where the president spends less and less time."
