        "text": "COVID-19\n\nIf you are planning international travel at this time, please read our COVID-19 related travel advice here, alongside our destination specific travel advice below.\n\nDo not travel\n\nDo not travel to the border areas with the Democratic Republic of Congo and with Rwanda due to the risk of armed attacks. (level 4 of 4).\n\nAvoid non-essential travel\n\nAvoid non-essential travel elsewhere in Burundi due to the threats of terrorism, political violence and violent crime (level 3 of 4).\n\nView Larger Map Close/Open map\n\nBurundi\n\nPolitical Tension/Civil Unrest\n\nThe political and security situation in Burundi is volatile and unpredictable and could deteriorate with little warning.\n\nThere has been ongoing, sporadic violence and unrest since April 2015, in response to political developments. Violent incidents, armed clashes, protests and demonstrations occur frequently in the capital Bujumbura and other centres and have resulted in a significant number of deaths. Tensions remain very high and further violence is likely.\n\nNew Zealanders are advised to avoid all unnecessary travel and maintain a high degree of personal security awareness. You should monitor developments closely through the media and other local information sources. Avoid all protests, political events, rallies and large public gatherings as they have the potential to turn violent with little warning.\n\nTerrorism\n\nThere is an ongoing threat of terrorism in Burundi. The terrorist group Al-Shabaab has made public threats to conduct attacks in Burundi, specifically in Bujumbura.\n\nNew Zealanders in Burundi are advised to be vigilant in public places, avoid crowded areas and follow any instructions issued by the local authorities. We advise having robust personal security measures in place including letting family and friends know about your travel plans.\n\nViolent Crime\n\nViolent crime, including armed robbery, grenade attacks mugging and carjacking is common throughout Burundi and the risk increases significantly after dark.\n\nTravel outside Bujumbura and other major towns presents significant risks, especially after dark. Armed bandits are known to operate outside of Bujumbura, and travellers should be especially careful in remote areas such as national parks. There is also a risk of kidnapping in Bubanza and Cibitoke provinces, and foreigners have been attacked in the past.\n\nNew Zealanders in Burundi should seek local advice if travelling outside Bujumbura. Contact the UN office in Burundi for the latest security advice. No resistance should be given if you are the victim of an armed robbery, mugging or carjacking as this could lead to an escalation in violence. For security reasons you should not travel alone or at night, and if travelling by road, car doors should be locked and windows up. We strongly advise against using public transport, even in Bujumbura city centre.\n\nBorder Regions\n\nArmed groups operate in Burundi and sporadic conflict and low-level violence between rebel and government forces occurs, particularly in Bubanza and Cibitoke provinces.\n\nThere is a significant risk of kidnapping and armed banditry by rebel groups in areas close to the borders with the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. We strongly advise against all travel to these border areas.\n\nGeneral Travel Advice\n\nAs there is no New Zealand diplomatic presence in Burundi, the ability of the New Zealand Government to provide assistance to New Zealand citizens is severely limited.\n\nWe offer advice to New Zealanders about contingency planning that travellers to Burundi should consider.\n\nKeep your passport in a safe place and only carry a photocopy for identification purposes.\n\nThere are frequent checkpoints where police check identity papers. There have been reports of harassment, intimidation and violence at checkpoints. Comply with requests, stay inside your vehicle and display colour copies of your documents through the window.\n\nPenalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe and can include lengthy imprisonment or fines.\n\nPhotography of government offices, airports, military establishments or officials is prohibited, could result in detention. If in doubt, donâ€™t take a picture.\n\nMedical services in Burundi are very limited, and New Zealanders travelling or living in Burundi should have a comprehensive travel insurance policy in place that includes provision for medical evacuation by air. You should check your policy covers travel to Burundi, as exclusions are likely to apply.\n\nNew Zealanders who remain in Burundi against our advice are strongly encouraged to register their details with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.\n\nTravel tips\n\nFor current health alerts"
