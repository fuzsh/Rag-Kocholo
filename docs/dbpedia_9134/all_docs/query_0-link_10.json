        "text": "A landlocked country in East Africa, Burundi is a low-income economy, with 80% of the population employed in the agricultural sector. Located in the Great Lakes region, Burundi is surrounded by Rwanda to the north, Tanzania to the east, the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west, and bordered by Lake Tanganyika to the southwest. With a population of 13.2 million people (2023), 50.3% of whom are women and 41.5% young people under 15, Burundi is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, with a density ratio of 442 people per square kilometer (2020 population projection).\n\nBurundi has made significant progress in terms of the quality of and access to education. Since the introduction of free primary education in 2005, the Gross Enrollment Rate in primary education reached 118.5% during the 2021/2022 school year without significant variation between provinces, gender, or level of income.\n\nPolitical Context\n\nPresident Evariste Ndayishimiye was elected in 2020 for a seven-year term of office. The ruling party, CNDD-FDD, has dominated the political scene since 2005, with a large majority in the National Assembly (87 out of 123 seats) and the Senate (38 out of 39 seats).\n\nA National Development Plan (NDP) has just been updated to implement Burundi’s new vision, \"Emerging country in 2040 and developed country in 2060\". This vision serves as a long-term development planning instrument and will guide sustainable development policies and strategies. The implementation of this vision will promote population growth compatible with the viable and sustainable management of available resources, as well as human development likely to be valued on national and international labor markets.\n\nSocioeconomic Background\n\nIn 2023, the economic growth accelerated to 2.7%, compared with 1.8% in 2022, underpinned by favorable rainfall and sustained public and private investment. The economic growth is projected at 3.8% in 2024, underpinned by favorable rainfall, a gradual resumption of investment in the mining sector, strategic public investment, and the knock-on effects of fiscal, monetary, and foreign exchange policy reforms. Inflation averaged 27.1% in 2023, compared with 18.8% a year earlier. Inflation could fall in 2024 and beyond, thanks in part to lower food prices resulting from good agricultural production and the downward trend in commodity prices. Reductions in public spending have brought the budget deficit down to 7.7% of GDP in 2023, down from 10.7% the previous year. Public revenues fell slightly to 22.3% of GDP from 22.8% in 2022, while spending dropped to 30% of GDP. The government has undertaken fiscal consolidation, which should have a positive impact on public finances. The current account deficit remained high at 13.9% of GDP, under pressure from soaring oil prices and weak exports, notably due to delays in resuming negotiations on mining contracts suspended since 2021.\n\nLast Updated: Mar 29, 2024\n\nThe Burundi COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Project (2020-2025, $65 million) aims to prevent, detect, and respond to the threat posed by COVID-19 and to strengthen national public health systems for epidemic preparedness in the country. Project results include:\n\n· Equipping 62 laboratories with equipment and reagents for diagnosing COVID-19 and other endemic-epidemic diseases.\n\n· Acquisition of 50 ambulances to improve referral and counter-referral and reduce mortality, particularly maternal and child mortality.\n\n· Acquisition of 30 x-ray units for hospitals, six oxygen plants, and 47 respirators.\n\n· Training of 2,625 health personnel in infection prevention and control.\n\n· Contribution to immunization campaigns against measles, cholera, and poliomyelitis epidemics.\n\n· Contribution to the financing of the national free healthcare policy for pregnant women and children under 5 through a performance-based financing mechanism, enabling the continuity of essential maternal, neonatal and child health care services.\n\nBurundi Land Restoration and Resilience Project « BLRRP » (2021-2024, $30 million from IDA financing and an additional financing of $6 million from GEF funds) aims to restore land productivity in targeted degraded landscapes and provide an immediate and effective response, in the event of an eligible crisis or emergency.\n\nProject results include:\n\n· Delivery of land certificates to 103,525 beneficiaries, including 24,808 registered in the name of 2 spouses and 78,717 in the name of the wife, a rate of 76%.\n\n· Job creation for 91,453 people through the labor-intensive approach, including the Batwa community, of whom 5,082 are women.\n\n· Construction and rehabilitation of observation sites in 3 protected areas.\n\n· Sustainable landscape management in 2 protected areas covering 1,925 ha and 100,923 ha, respectively.\n\n· Maintenance of tourist trails and paths (906km of the 450km planned) by the Batwa in Kibira and Ruvubu national parks and Bururi National Forest Reserve.\n\nSolar Energy in Local Communities Project « Nyakiriza » (2020-2026, $63 million) aims to improve access to decentralized energy services (electricity and cooking) for households, businesses, schools, and health centers in rural Burundi. Results include:\n\n· Construction of cooking stoves in 120 schools, reducing fuel consumption by 40-60%, significantly improving the nutritional quality of the food prepared, and improving the working environment for cooks in an effort to increase multi-sectoral impact.\n\n· Consideration of gender issues, particularly with (i) identification of specific care needs and electrified biomedical equipment adapted to young women’s health, and (ii) identification of women entrepreneurship barriers and specific technical assistance needs for women-managed and -owned businesses in order to propose appropriate follow-up for FESEC applicants and beneficiaries.\n\n· Definition of a national electrification strategy by 2030 and organization of regular meetings of the Energy Sector Working Group comprising the Ministry of Hydraulics, Energy and Mines, REGIDESO, development partners, and the private sector to advance the reform agenda.\n\nLast Updated: Mar 29, 2024"
