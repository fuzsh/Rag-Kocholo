        "text": "Amissa Irakoze has always been aware of the vagaries of Lake Tanganyika. Its regular floods have sometimes touched her home in Gatumba, in northwestern Burundi, and the backflow has kept danger at bay. She had never believed that the waters could threaten her ten children.\n\nOne day in April 2020, however, on her way home from her daily work in the fields, she discovered her house had been submerged by the lake, whose level has been rising against the backdrop of climate change. \"I screamed, 'My children, my children, my children!'\" said the single mother, miming a gesture of despair. \"The children were washed away, but some people who could swim fished them out (...) and they brought them back to me,\" she said. All were saved.\n\nMs. Irakoze told her story from the Kinyinya II camp, located a few kilometers behind Gatumba, home to more than 2,300 people displaced by the floods. During the day, a blazing sun bears down on the white tents bearing the UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM) logo, and in the evening, a bitterly cold, wet climate prevails. In each alley, dozens of children are milling around.\n\nBefore, \"we used to farm, we did jobs that helped us survive, but since we've been here we've done nothing,\" said Lea Nyabenda a few hundred meters further on, who also arrived two years ago. \"Life is miserable. The accommodation and the lack of food make me anxious. We're sleeping in a place like this when we used to have a lovely big house,\" said this woman, also the mother of ten children.\n\nA neighborhood that has become a swamp\n\nMs. Nyabenda agreed to return to her former home in Gatumba, a town that had been growing in all directions in recent decades, boosted by trade with the nearby Democratic Republic of Congo. Even the areas beside the waterfront, which were not allowed to be built on, have seen neighborhoods spring up.\n\nMushasha, Ms. Nyabenda's neighborhood, is now a swamp with alternating channels from lakes overgrown with tall grass and houses â€“ some miraculously intact, others abandoned, some totally ruined.\n\n\"This is where my house used to be,\" she said, stopping in front of a mound of dirt and pieces of wood. \"There were two rooms there; that was one room, that was another room, and that part was the living room.\" \"I avoid coming here, for fear of feeling the stress rise in me.\"\n\nThe neighborhood is like a ghost town, with only a handful of inhabitants left. The damage goes far beyond the houses alone. \"Schools that have been destroyed, and shops (...). Fields and crops have also been flooded,\" said Geoffrey Kirenga, country director of the NGO Save the Children, which has been helping displaced families and those who have chosen to stay.\n\nClimate change and pollution\n\nSome 65% of the displaced people in Gatumba are children. Many no longer have access to school and some have started working to feed their families. \"Some children are taking up fishing, which is dangerous: it is unprotected and exposes them to physical injury,\" said Mr. Kirenga, glancing uneasily at the waters populated in this area by hippos and crocodiles. Save the Children expects the situation to worsen this year as the rainy season begins in Burundi.\n\nThe densely populated country, ranked by the World Bank as the poorest in the world in terms of GDP per capita, has experienced several waves of exodus owing to the conflicts that have rocked it. Today, the threat is changing.\n\nNearly 85% of the 113,000 internally displaced persons are displaced owing to natural disasters, according to the IOM, which has pointed out that Burundi is one of the 20 countries most vulnerable to climate change. Meteorological records in recent years have shown an intensification of rainfall, especially torrential rain, experts have noted.\n\nIn addition to the historically observed \"cyclical\" rise in water levels, this recent surge has been explained by the pollution of the many rivers that flow into Lake Tanganyika, said Albert Mbonerane, former Minister of the Environment and ardent defender of the lake's ecosystem.\n\nThis pollution threatens to block the only outlet on the Congolese side of Africa's second largest lake. In fact, the waters have not ebbed away or almost not since 2020. \"When I see all the solid waste, everything that is thrown into these rivers (...). It's like the lake is vomiting and asking: 'What do you want me to do now?',\" said Mr. Mbonerane.\n\nEast of Gatumba, the capital city Bujumbura has extended its neighborhoods, restaurants, port and airport around the lake. Plots of land are flooded and half of a four-lane highway that used to run along the shore is now closed. This serves as a reminder of the constant threat to Burundi's largest city. \"Sometimes, when we talk about the environment, it seems like it's just a story we're telling, but the reality is there,\" said Mr. Mbonerane.\n\nLe Monde with AFP\n\nTranslation of an original article published in French on lemonde.fr; the publisher may only be liable for the French version."
