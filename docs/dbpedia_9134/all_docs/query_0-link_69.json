        "text": "Get in\n\n[edit]\n\nVisa rules and prices change frequently. As of July 2023 two visas are available on arrival at the Airport: a one-month, multiple entry visa costs US$90, and a 3-day (2-night) transit visa is $40. Visas can be obtained from embassies prior to travel.\n\nIf you arrive by land you can only get a 3-day transit visa for 40usd. then you need to go to the immigration office in Bujumbura to get a visa extension 10 or 30 days for 20-50 usd.\n\nVisa on arrival is only payable in US dollars: euros are often not accepted, Burundian francs (FBu) are not accepted (even if there is ATM in airport). Credit cards are not accepted even if the “Visa” and “MasterCard” acceptance logos are clearly visibles on airport stickers. Customs accepts only recent banknotes.\n\nBy plane\n\n[edit]\n\nRecording around 5 flights per day, Bujumbura International Airport essentially connects to East African hub airports, via the following compagnies:\n\nEthiopian Airlines, from Addis Ababa (ADD IATA) — 1 flight per day — ET807\n\nKenya Airways, from Nairobi (NBO IATA) — 2 flights per day — KQ444 and KQ448\n\nRwandAir, from Kigali (KGL IATA) — 2 flights per day — WB482 and WB483\n\nBrussels Arilines, from Brussels (BRU IATA) — 1 flight per week, on Sunday — SN451\n\nthere are direct Air Tanzania flights to neighboring Tanzania Kigoma and Dar Es salaam but none to Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nTaxis are cruising all over the city; you need to negotiate the price with them. As of early 2010, rides in the city centre were about 1500-2500 FBu; rides to and from airport can be absurdly expensive (20,000 FBu) but there's little you can do about it. In the city, during the day, a cheaper option is a moto-taxi costing 500-1000 FBu a journey, but these have been banned from the city centre for safety reasons. Burundians typically rely on the many mini-buses, costing 300 FBu to anywhere in city centre in mid-2011, and 600 FBu to the suburbs. Minibuses serving the north of the city arrive and depart at the front of the central market (Marché Central), while those heading south use the parking lot in the back of the market near the Interbank head office. The last mini-buses leave around 22:00 as of 2011. It is not advised to walk at night after that; if you need to go anywhere, take a taxi.\n\nTo get a lift in any type of vehicle from the side of the road, hold out your hand with your palm facing upward. This works for taxis, buses, motorcycles, and all sorts of private and commercial vehicles. Mini-bus conductors will honk and use their fingers to show how many seats are available. If the bus is full, they will wave their hand with their palm facing downward. It is not uncommon for private vehicles to pick up foreigners requesting lifts during the daytime. They range from high-end SUVs driven by white-collar workers to flat bed pickup trucks where you must stand up. Payment is generally not expected for hitchhiking short distances, but working-class Burundians regularly give each other money for small favours, so there is no harm in offering.\n\nBuy\n\n[edit]\n\nDiamond Trust Bank, Ecobank, Kenya commercial Bank and some others have ATMs in Bujumbura that accept international Master cards and Visa cards, Interbank charge ~5000 FBu for each transaction. At Gar du Nord bus station there is only one ATM around which sometimes is out of service, so come prepared.\n\nGroceries\n\n[edit]\n\nMost of the things that one needs can be found in one of the stalls in the Central Market. Stiff bargaining is needed to get it for the right price.\n\nSmall supermarkets are found across the city. Google supermarket, Gift Supermarket. They normally stock luxury Imported items at a luxury price.\n\nThe Greek-owned 'Boucherie Nouvelle' on Avenue du Congo is worth a visit. Always busy, but then it offers a wide variety of meat, cheese and charcuterie. Opposite the butcher you find vendors with exclusive and rare vegetables and in the rainy season wild mushrooms of all types. Be prepared for hassle and 'persuasive' sales techniques.\n\nSouvenirs\n\n[edit]\n\nThe best place to buy souvenirs is the small curio market on Avenue de Stade.\n\nAnother small curio market is found on Chaussee Prince Louis Rwagazore, opposite Library St. Paul.\n\nEat\n\n[edit]\n\nThe people in Bujumbura love their food and enjoy eating out with friends or family. A beef or fish brochette, chips or fried plantain and a fresh salad is available in all restaurants. But take your time. All food is freshly prepared and the cooks take time. Waiting an hour before the food arrives is certainly not abnormal.\n\nRestaurants are scattered all over town, but the best are in Rohero and Kiriri.\n\nSome restaurants that are worth a visit are:\n\nCentre\n\n[edit]\n\nRohero\n\n[edit]\n\nFleur de Sel in city centre (Blvd 1er Novembre). (June 2016)\n\nKiriri\n\n[edit]\n\nLake Tanganyika\n\n[edit]\n\nKinindo\n\n[edit]"
