Look out for this lad. Singing sensation Alexander Barnett will be starring in the hit West End show Oliver!

Alexander, 14, has been cast as one of Fagin’s boys. He will star alongside Rowan Atkinson, who plays Fagin, and Jodie Prenger (Nancy), the winner of the BBC reality show I’d Do Anything. He makes his debut next month.

“I can’t wait,” Alexander, a pupil at the Sylvia Young Theatre School in Marylebone, London, tells People. “This is the biggest thing I have done. I am a fan of Rowan Atkinson and am really excited.”

Alexander endured five rounds of auditions before being selected from more than 500 hopefuls.

He also has the chance to be picked to play the next Artful Dodger. “That would be wicked. I am kind of living the dream at the moment. It’s all going really well.” A keen singer, Alexander also plays the guitar and performs in a band, which was shortlisted for Xfm’s Rock School competition.

There is one downer, however. Starring in Oliver! means he can no longer take part in his local synagogue’s Purim Spiel. He was due to play Haman.

He lives in Edgware, Middlesex, and is a member of Edgware Reform Synagogue.
