        "text": "Richard Gere\n\nAudi RS6 Avant $93K Richard Gere legendarily drove a brand-new Lotus Esprit SE while filming Pretty Woman. The exotic 1989 model turned so many heads that Lotus Esprit orders tripled the year the film was released. Ironically, the studio was hoping for the glamour of a Ferrari or Porsche, but both car companies declined to cooperate with a film about feminine disrepute. In real life, Gere opts for a more practical vehicle. The A-lister, with his stupendous career, has racked up enough blockbuster productions to deliver him a net worth of $100 million.\n\nThe sum is plenty to put him behind the wheel of the most extravagant ride, but, as a practicing Buddhist, he’s a down-to-earth type and prefers the stylish practicality of this sleek Audi RS6 Avant. He paid $93,000 to sport the high-end sedan. The award-winning actor appreciates a Fiat, apparently, having paired up with the Italian car company as a brand ambassador. Gere is very much involved with the Tibet House human rights group and the organization Survival International which supports the word’s deprived.\n\nEmma Roberts\n\nRange Rover $50K Emma Roberts got an early start on her acting career appearing in her first movie at age 9. The star has done quite well. By the time she was 21, she was able to purchase this raven black Range Rover for $50,000. It’s been her go-to vehicle, zipping her around Beverly Hills and the Hollywood area. For her 26th birthday, Roberts’ luxury SUV received a ding courtesy of a tree and an inattentive valet.\n\nEmma shared post-party details on Instagram. The fun “tacos and tequila” celebration, hosted at a friend’s house, was attended by 50 people. All was going well until she went out to find her Range Rover lodged into a tree. The valet failed to apply the parking brake, and it rolled down the driveway. The incident is all way behind her. Today fans are wild about her expanding role in American Horror Story.\n\nKate Upton\n\nMercedes-Benz SLS 6.3 $248K Supermodel Kate Upton knows how to pick a car. The Sports Illustrated bikini and Vogue cover model likes it so much she starred in a Super Bowl-premiere commercial for Mercedes in which she supervises NFL players washing her Benz. Now she owns a Mercedes-Benz SLS 6.3 AMG. The swanky two-door Gullwing German performance coupe is the only car to win the gold Design Award of the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nIt houses a 6.2-liter V8 engine, so consuming 18 mpg of fuel is no surprise. To ease the carbon footprint of her chic beast, Kate purchased a $110K Tesla Model S in white. It feels better driving something that doesn’t contribute to climate catastrophe. She doesn’t just advertise for SI, she’s a genuine Texas sports girl! The 27-year-old is married to Houston Astros pitcher Justin Verlander.\n\nTom Cruise\n\nBugatti Veyron 16.4 $1.4 Million We all know this old-time Risky Business superstar and Mission Impossible franchise emissary, but do you know his supercar? Consider yourself introduced to the Bugatti Veyron 16.4. Cruise was the first celeb to own the fastest car in the world. It’s not just gorgeous on the outside. The Bugatti Veyron, strapped with a stampeding 1,200 horsepower engine, roars out of a green-light with an acceleration rate of 0-60 mph in 2.4 seconds.\n\nIts carbon-fiber monocoque design makes it stunning and lightweight. Top speeds find the performance beast at 257 mph. Cruise presented his swank new ride at the world premiere of Mission Impossible III in 2006. The world’s most expensive car put him back $1.4 million, but it’s not the only sleek set of wheels Mr. Cruise commandeers. His 1979 Porsche 911 964 was his baby, but he also owns a sleek 1958 frost-blue Corvette, a Chevrolet Chevelle SS 2-door coupe, a 4-door BMW 7-Series, a Mercedes-Benz S Class, a Mercedes CLK W209, a Cadillac Escalade a Ford Mustang Saleen S281 in grey, and a Ford Mustang Saleen S281 in orange. Consider that a sample of his collection.\n\nTom Hanks\n\nScion xB (Scion eBox) $55,000 Yay Tom! Just one more reason to love everybody’s favorite movie star. Tom Hanks has gone green. There’s no better way to reduce emissions than by eliminating them completely. Hank’s Toyota Scion xB has been converted to an all-electric Scion eBox. He was the very first person to purchase a converted xB in 2007. He unveiled the work of Toyota’s AC Propulsion division after they converted his Scion xB into a battery on wheels.\n\nThe car charges in 2-5 hours and has a range of about 160 miles. Top speed? A safe and swift 95 mph. As one of the faster EVs, it can get out of the way of traffic in a jiffy. The eBox reaches 0-60 in seven seconds. It cost Hanks $55,000. With a net worth of $350 million, it’s not about the money. Hanks was proudly quoted saying, “There are three electric cars sitting on the moon, and now another one in my garage.”\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio\n\nFisker Karma $135K Leonardo DiCaprio took responsible-driving to a whole new level. Falling in love with the Fisker Karma, he moved to invest in Fisker Automotive, become its brand ambassador and, of course, purchase a shiny new silver Fisker Karma. He was one of 3,000 on the sold-out waiting list anticipating buying the $100,000 luxury plug-in hybrid. He’s long supported sustainable causes and was also on board with the Tesla Roadster, another high-end electric sports car. As for the Karma, he says it’s beautiful-looking and rides like a sports car. He likes it because of its extended-range capability, an upgrade to the hybrids he had purchased in the past.\n\nNow that he’s an equity investor, he’ll plug the Fisker liberally! Fisker Automotive also agreed to support the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation in the deal, as well as his eco-friendly manufacture goal requests such as cruelty-free upholstery. The Karma is solar-powered. Just like solar-paneled homes, solar panels on the roof of the Karma generate electricity that charges the car’s Lithium-Ion battery and runs the climate control system.\n\nClint Eastwood\n\nGMC Typhoon $30K Clint Eastwood is a Hollywood legend. His name is internationally recognized as the synonym for badass. Cars, guns and retribution. So, what does the man who played “Dirty Harry” drive? Unsurprisingly, muscle cars like the green 1972 Ford Gran Torino, the one Eastwood co-starred within Gran Torino, come to mind. Or, maybe, supercharged luxury Corvettes. The truth is, as he revealed to Jimmy Fallon one night, he drives a GMC Typhoon. A what? Exactly. The GMC Typhoon is a limited-production vehicle that came out in 1992.\n\nHe still has it. Don’t worry, it’s fast. With a turbocharged V6, the hulking SUV whips from 0-60 in 5.3 seconds! Alternatively, to balance things out, he buzzes around in an all-electric Fiat 500e. It can go 84 miles on a full charge. And, like the Typhoon, it’s affordable. The Fiat 500e costs about $32,000. If it seems a bit steep, just think about how you’ll save about a hundred dollars a month on gas!\n\nTom Selleck\n\nPorsche 928 S4 $30K Magnum, P.I. aired from 1980 to 1988. Eighties TV couldn't be called, “Eighties TV,” without this handsome private investigator patrolling tropical resort towns in a flashy candy-apple red Ferrari each week. And would Hawaiian shirts have become a thing without Mr. Magnum? As legend has it, he was supposed to drive a Porsche 928 in the series, but his substantial 6-foot-4 frame could not squeeze into the sports car, and neither would the Porsche execs custom-provide an altered 928.\n\nI’m sure the man whose mustache comes before him enjoyed the Italian-model upgrade. In 1988, however, Selleck got himself a custom Porsche 928 S4 5-speed—fully loaded with a beige leather interior and charcoal-black paint.\n\nJay Leno\n\nMercedes-Benz 300SL $1.8Million Prepare yourself for an avid collector. Comedian Jay Leno has amassed over 130 remarkable autos. (Where does one find a 130-car garage?!) He collects motorcycles as well. All told, his collection is worth $50 million. It’s a fun way to invest over 10 percent of his $350 million net worth! Nothing he’s acquired, from his McLaren F1 to his Ford GT supercar is as beloved as his 1955 race car-red Mercedes-Benz 300SL Gullwing. He found the 2-door coupe in a storage container out in the desert, stranded with neither an engine nor transmission since the 1970s. The original car was used for racing. The old Betty’s pretty powerful. It’s got a 3.0-liter V8 220 horsepower engine that reaches a speed of 130 mph. Leno had the car meticulously fixed up.\n\nAt $1.8 million, it’s worth much more than a new one. On his show, Jay Leno’s Garage, the legendary late-night host details the restoration process. Also in his collection, is a 1986 Lamborghini Countach with a Quattro V12, 5.2-liter engine. He’s the proud owner of two McLaren’s—a P1 and an F1. And, Leno has acquired a 1966 Oldsmobile Toronado, also restored on Jay Leno’s Garage. His actual garage? An aircraft hangar in Los Angeles serves as a warehouse.\n\nConan O’Brien\n\nFord Taurus Priceless Conan O’Brien’s original 1992 emerald green Ford Taurus has made many appearances on his late-night talk show. At one point, he brought the beloved manual-transmission car that he drove before making it as a comedian onto the stage of Conan. With a State Farm agent at hand, he described the classic details of its vintage value and celebrity status, having been owned and driven by himself. (And Brad Pitt, it turns out.) As the original owner, Conan described the vehicle’s pristine condition.\n\nEverything is in its original condition, he claimed. “They’re the original tires. A lot of people say, ‘change the tires,’ I say, ‘no, keep the original tires.’ So, it slides around the road a lot’.” A new Ford Taurus, pictured here, will run you about $40,000, Conan’s is incalculably valuable. The time Brad Pitt dropped the clutch and peeled out of an NYC parking spot in the almost 30-year-old Taurus crowned its immeasurable worth with celebrity added-value. Taking another layer off of the vintage bald tires probably helped too.\n\nJerry Seinfeld\n\nPorsche 959 $1.8 Million Another avid collector is comedian Jerry Seinfeld. He’s a huge Porsche fan, but he doesn’t discriminate, except with Lexus. He despises the brand. Each new lineup makes him “very upset and angry.” His collection features a wide variety of automobiles. On his explicitly-titled Netflix show, Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, he and a fellow comedian cruise East Hampton in one of his rare or vintage automobiles and then stop into a local New York cafe to grab a cup of joe while amusing us with their clever chats. Seinfeld once owned 46 Porsches out of his 150-car assemblage. He stores his treasures at a $1.4 million garage in Manhattan.\n\nIn 2016 he dumped $22 million worth of his collection, including 17 Porsches. But not his pearl white 1983 Porsche 959! The rare 1980s classic is revered and envied throughout the Porsche community. His is one of 337 models built. It’s similar in design to the popular 911 but boasts a sleek spoiler, an elongated but dainty body, pronounced wheel wells, and the distinctive “G” gear. The “G” gear shifts it into all-wheel-drive for mud or other terrain challenges. It hits a top speed of 197 mph, and bolts 0-60 in 3.6 seconds. It’s his crown jewel. Funny part? It’s not even street-legal.\n\nNick Jonas\n\nShelby Mustang $68K The days of performing with his brothers on the Disney Channel may be far behind this popstar, but movies and a solo career keep him busy. Plus, rumors of a Jonas Brothers reunion culminated with the band’s first new single, “Sucker.” Happily married to actress Priyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas is no longer the teen-bop star we remember. Jonas loves his new wife, and he loves American muscle. Featured here is his 1968 vintage Shelby Mustang. The ‘Stang’s original V8, introduced in 1968, muscles out a 290-horsepower engine.\n\nNo wonder Jonas fancied sporting this classic American beauty around town. The classic car was his first, a 16th birthday gift. It’s rumored to be worth $68,000. He’s also got some modern muscle with a Chevy Camaro SS convertible and a Dodge Challenger R/T. Another classic car he owns is a flaming-red, immaculately restored 1960 Ford Thunderbird convertible. Additionally, he sports a sleek BMW 5-Series sedan as a chauffeured ride. But he’s not a complete petrol head. In his collection of fine automobiles is an all-electric, hybrid convertible Fisker Karma. Marrying Priyanka has upgraded his garage with some pretty posh rides. She’s added a couple of serious German machines to his American family.\n\nBradley Cooper\n\nMercedes-Benz G55 $220K As the top-paid actor in Hollywood for three years running, Bradley Cooper can buy any vehicle he wants, even after slipping behind Vin Diesel this year. He’s got a few, as you may imagine, including a black 2007 Prius, a navy-blue Vespa, and a couple of Triumph Thurston motorcycles. He told Vogue he uses his Prius for chauffeuring his chow-retriever, Charlotte, around town. But when he’s serious about transport, he takes his 2004 Mercedes-Benz G55 AMG Wagon.\n\nIt’s worth about $220,000. Some of us might purchase a modest abode with such a sum, but when you need a veritable German tank to traverse mountain terrain, the G-class is the machine of choice. He’s in good company. The Pope also rides a G-class. The G-Wagon has a boxy frame based on an armored-patrol vehicle. It has a 5.4-liter V8 engine that produces 507 HP. It’s a serious machine.\n\nAmber Heard\n\nFord Mustang $150K Amber Heard is a car lover. She loves muscle, and she loves her 1968 Ford Mustang best. As her very first car, it’s chock full of memories and sentiment and she simply adores it. Her baby was lovingly restored in 2015 as a surprise by her then-husband Johnny Depp. He played a trick on her. The car had been stolen twice before, so he told her it had been swiped again. Meanwhile, he took it to the set of Overhaulin’.\n\nWhen it was finished, Amber was ecstatically surprised to see her silver Mustang transformed into a gorgeous glossy cherry-red automotive masterpiece. With added celebrity-effect, it’s worth $150,000. After the divorce, Heard kept her Mustang. She also got the 2015 Range Rover and a horse. She attributes her love of muscle cars to her Texan background which may come as a surprise. On the big screen, the versatile actress transitions seamlessly from Pineapple Express to Justice League. She played a punk rocker in Her Smell.\n\nKaty Perry\n\nAudi 5 $60K The Audi is the car of choice for many celebrities. This sizzling-hot popstar, likewise, opted for the classy German coupe from Audi AG, a member of the Volkswagen Group. Katy Perry also owns a pink Smart car, but the super-sleek, black Audi 5 looks a lot nicer on her. Plus, it’s got all-wheel drive which leaves the flimsy Smart car in the dust. According to the folks over at Bustle, Perry splurged on her staff by purchasing each of her five assistants an eco-friendly Fisker Karma. At $100,000 a pop, the generous gesture won’t be forgotten.\n\nShe picked one up for herself too. She also owns a Tesla Model S, because she really does prefer electric, but she balances it out with her most expensive ride, a $300,000 Maserati Grancabrio. And, not to mention, the petrol-swilling $200,000 Ferrari California. She’s also got a relatively modest Mercedes-Benz W180 in the garage. Together, her auto investment is $350 million.\n\nOprah Winfrey\n\nVW Beetle $30K Oprah’s known for giving cars away to her studio audience, but what kind of car does she keep for herself? This Volkswagen Beetle, for one. She gave 275 members of her audience a 2012 VW Beetle during her “Oprah’s Favorite Things” promotion, and she kept a bright red shiny one for herself besides. Volkswagen donated the cars that featured their new curvy design. By now, the model has been discontinued. Collector’s items, anyone? But let’s get real. What does Oprah really like to drive? Try her classic Mercedes-Benz 300SL Gullwing.\n\nThis rare 1950s gem is one of 1,400 models. The Cadillac Escalade is a practical transportation alternative, only outdone by her Lincoln Navigator. Oprah’s sending a message by owning a Tesla Model S, something to get her around Mendocino without smogging up the view. And finally, a luxury home garage isn’t a garage without a Mercedes. Oprah’s holds the E-Class Coupe.\n\nDavid Letterman\n\nJaguar XK140 $137K He’s not the first late-night host with a car collection, but he takes the crown for best in classiness. David Letterman’s garage hosts some of the most elegant road machines ever made. Let’s start with this 1955 Jaguar XK140, worth up to $137,000. This is the flagship Jaguar sports car built for motor racing. Its tremendous success on the racing circuit popularized the handsome roadster model. It became a symbol of wealth and class. Another model of refined style is found in Letterman’s 1961 Austin Healey 3000 MKI two-seater. A world-class motor racer, the British-built Austin Healey 3000 was not only fast but an elegant illustration of torque in its day.\n\nIt’s not the only Healey in the collection. Letterman also owns a 1956 Austin Healey 100-BN2, a rare acquisition. Only 4,604 of these legendary roadsters were produced. His third, and final Healey, is the adorable 1960 Austin Healey Bugeye Sprite, a collector’s favorite. Letterman collects vintage Porsches and Ferrari’s; too many to list, six of the former and eight of the latter. Lately, he’s been busy hosting guests who need no introduction on his Netflix show. He presented car collector-rival, Jerry Seinfeld. They discussed comedians, cars and coffee.\n\nJennifer Love Hewitt\n\nBentley Continental GTC $218K From Kids Incorporated to Disney TV star, to I Know What You Did Last Summer and I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, Jennifer Love Hewitt has grown up a star. Now 40 years old, Hewitt’s been singing and acting since she was a young child. Today, she’s got kids and this Bentley Continental GTC to shuttle them around in. This fine luxury automobile is equipped with a twin-turbocharged engine and lavish interior finished with the finest wood and leather upholstery. It cost her about $218,000, but it’s a favorite of hers. She also owns a Smart car.\n\nAnother alternative for cruising this car-lover to the shops is a Mercedes-Benz CLK63 AMG. This workhorse is equipped with a supercharged V8 with high-capacity torque. Not to be forgotten is a silver Mercedes-Benz CLS. The sleek and trendy ride is not just pretty from the inside, it’s fully loaded with the “crème de la crème” of tech. After taking a hiatus to care for her children, Hewitt was happy to return to TV on FOX’s medical drama 9-1-1.\n\nJason Momoa\n\nCadillac $16K This Game of Thrones sensation sealed the deal as a Hollywood legend with Aquaman. When Jason Momoa is not playing burly characters like Khal Drogo of GoT, you might find him cruising around in one of his preferred rides. And that would be his prized 1955 Cadillac, which he calls Bernadette. He’s had it for over fifteen years. Pink is one of his favorite colors. He told Herald-Mail it tones down testosterone levels. He’s so virile he needs coping strategies!\n\nOn light days, he might get a boost by hopping on his Harley-Davidson for a spin. Alternatively, when he needs to take it down a notch, he might ride his e-bike, the slick Valkree Drifter. Just for family transport, he’s got a White Range Rover, classy. Also near and dear to his heart is a black Land Rover Defender Series 3. He calls it his truck.\n\nJulia Roberts\n\nToyota Prius $25K Julia Roberts played an environmental activist in Erin Brockovich. The Oscar-winning role came a decade after her starring performance in Pretty Woman. But Roberts didn’t just play an environmental activist on the big screen; she cares about the environment in real life. The A-lister has often been seen driving the Toyota Prius, one of the best alternatives to gas engines.\n\nShe’s one among many celebs who choose the moderately-priced eco-vehicle for around-town commuting, while in the garage are the luxury performance beasts. Hers include a Cadillac Escalade and a Mercedes GL-class. But the Prius seems to be her favorite.\n\nSamuel Jackson\n\nMaybach 57S $500K Post-Marvel, it might be hard to remember Samuel Jackson was already a Hollywood legend. His iconic work with Quentin Tarantino is also something to appreciate. But now, it’s only Nick Fury we see when we look at his face. For ordinary-life class, Jackson steps into his ultra-luxury line Maybach by Mercedes-Benz. Jackson traveled to the vehicle’s native Germany to pick out his glossy-white 2007 Maybach 57S.\n\nThe car that has everything, including in-cabin refrigeration, champagne glasses and folding tables has a price tag of $500,000. The Maybach houses speed and performance, but it only gets 10-16 mpg. The rooftop solar panels are a luxury feature that power the vehicle’s indoor climate control and other off-engine features. His customized model has all the available tech plus bullet-proof windows. Perfect for action-movie filmmaking flashbacks! On conventional days he sports a Toyota Camry.\n\nDenzel Washington\n\nChrysler 300 $40K Denzel Washington is known for subverting our assumptions about American history with iconic films like Malcolm X and The Hurricane, but at heart, he’s a family guy who’s in love with his wife of 30-plus years. “She puts up with me,” he says. Sharply contrasting many of his rap and hip-hop brethren, Washington owns only a few sensibly luxurious rides and doesn’t like to flaunt his hefty $220 net worth. He lives like a role model, with intention. Though he’s known to be low-key, dressing in clothing given out on the sets of the films he makes, for his 50th birthday in 2004, he treated himself to a Rolls Royce Phantom.\n\nThe $300,000 ultra-luxury machine is a first-class inside and out. When Denzel got in one, he had to have it. “I took a Phantom on a test drive and I thought, ‘Why not? Stop cheating yourself. This is your life. Get what you want,’” he said. This according to the Irish Examiner. Prior to the Phantom, he picked up his black Chrysler 300 for about $40,000. This modest luxury vehicle had been his main ride for the bulk of his years in Hollywood.\n\nCam Newton\n\nOldsmobile 442 Cutlass $255K Now here’s a flashy guy. Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton is a Super Bowl MVP and a Heisman Trophy winner. Though he whiffed on clinching the title, he celebrated his great season by hiring the crew at Monster Customs in Atlanta to style up his 1970 Oldsmobile 442 Cutlass. They redid the entire car and finished it with gold stitching in diamond patterns. Forty-five-thousand dollars later, it was transformed into the strapping brute pictured here. The motor was fixed. Bigger wheels, new carpet, and a thumping new sound system were added.\n\nThe ridiculously large wheels are capped by gold-plated rims. Black bodywork with glossy-gold trim spruced up the vintage muscle car. Oldsmobile called it a 442 because of its 4-barrel carburetor, 4-speed manual transmission, and dual exhaust. Details like a 24-karat gold plated panther head crowning the grill next to his initials and jersey number, “C1N” could not be omitted. Next, he plans to have Monster snazz-up his Rolls. That should be interesting.\n\nAlessandra Ambrosio\n\nRange Rover SUV $100K Brazilian supermodel Alessandra Ambrosio is actually of Polish and Italian descent, but no matter, she’s amazingly beautiful. The Victoria Secrets Angel modeled for the lingerie company for years. She ranked six on Forbes list of highest-paid fashion models. Her best year raked in $6.6 million. With all that wealth, of course, we wonder about what car she drives.\n\nShe’s partial to the Range Rover, especially now that she has children to shuttle around. The SUV is considered safer. And look at the size! It approximates the dimension of a light military tank. At 38, the Amazonian model is as busy as ever with films, TV and, of course, posing in her bikini. She’s active on Instagram.\n\nGuy Fieri\n\nChevrolet Chevelle $70K Guy Fieri, the face of The Food Network, has a passion for gourmet culinary. The famous TV chef also has a passion for cars, and a show for that too. It’s no secret. Fieri’s a self-proclaimed Chevy guy, and he’s got quite a collection of American muscle cars. In Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, he road-trips to uncover hidden mom-and-pop gems. The co-star of his show is a fully restored, red with black trim, 1968 Chevy Camaro Super Sport convertible. He loves that car. The SS bowtie wasn’t the first. When he was just starting, newly signed with the network, he nearly mortgaged his house to acquire his 1971 Chevrolet Chevelle SS.\n\nThe stunning yellow with black racing stripes road beast grabbed his attention, even after having professed he hates yellow cars! Having secretly saved $12,000, Fieri used that to wrangle a deal. Great investment. The show is an amazing success. A fully restored 1971 Chevelle SS can go for $70,000. With his show and celebrity-added value, who knows how much that muscle car is worth!\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nBentley Continental GTC $250K Jennifer Lopez has long adored her classy pearly white Bentley Continental GTC. It’s been such a great ride, in fact, that she picked up another one in blue. At $250,000 a pop, it adds up. Well, not for J-Lo. But, check this out. Just in! J-Lo’s got a new ride. As a gift for turning 50, fiancé and baseball great Alex Rodriguez presented the pop icon with a candy-apple red Porsche 911 GTS convertible.\n\nA-Rod had the plates personalized with “JLO,” and arranged for the $140,000 performance sports car to be delivered to their driveway. According to E! News, it was gift-wrapped in an enormous gold bow. She took A-Rod for a spin after unwrapping it, obviously. On Instagram, A-Rod told her she’s the best. “We love you, your fans love you, your children love you and I love you.”\n\nSylvester Stallone\n\nMercedes-Benz G550 $166K Sylvester Stallone. One word: Rocky. Or, Rambo. Everything about this man exudes masculinity. The Testostero-meter registers in the red. Although, perhaps under that ruggedly virile physique he’s really a teddy bear. I doubt it. Check out his car collection. First is the robust Mercedes G-class. It makes sense he commandeers the Mercedes-Benz G550. If it’s good enough for the Pope, it’s good enough for Stallone. The G550 is one of the most expensive Mercedes on the market at $166,000, but that’s because its off-road capabilities and overall performance are unmatched in an SUV. Inside, it’s ultra-plush—rugged on the outside and pure refinement inside. To push the Testostero-meter to the limit, there’s the Bugatti Veyron.\n\nStallone owns the fastest, most expensive car in the world. The swanky muscle car with the distinctive front grill has a $1.7 million price tag. That’s one pricey supercar. If he can find an open road, this thing stampedes to 257 mph. Can you imagine? It takes 2.4 seconds to hit 60 mph. Are there any G-forces involved here? Another beast this A-lister houses is a Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano Mansory. It’s beautiful and powerful, an engineering masterpiece. The phenomenal sports car perfectly suits its owner. His garage is filled with power and performance. Point is, he likes fast cars.\n\nLady Gaga\n\nAudi R8 $165K Gaga’s a petrol head! She’s into muscle cars, drives an F-150 pick-up and has a supercar or two tucked inside of her garage. It’s surprising, considering that she’s only had her drivers license since she turned 30. The pop diva is worth $300 million. She bounced back to her former monster-fame glory with A Star is Born. On top of that is another chart-topping album. There’s no stopping this girl now that she’s street legal. She could choose to get around town in her swank Rolls Royce Phantom or her Mercedes Benz E350. Alternatively, she could get behind the wheel of her Tarantino Chevy Silverado, or another of her muscle cars, the Chevrolet El Camino.\n\nThe mint blue Chevy Nova Super Sport is also a choice option. But, in general, Gaga seems to prefer to sport this fine road-gripping Audi R8 coupe. It’s got muscle! Zipping 0-60 in 3.5 seconds, it is the perfect car to outrace the paparazzi. That alone makes it worth every penny of the $165,000 she threw down for her top prize.\n\nCeline Dion\n\nMaybach 62 $500K Celine Dion was an Eighties teen pop star in Canada before she learned English and became the worldwide pop diva sensation that she is. As the second best-selling female artist in the U.S., she has sold more No. 1 songs than any other female artist, all told, 220 million albums. In Canada, she is still the number one best-selling artist. Now she lives in Vegas. When it comes to cars, Dion gravitates toward the Maybach from the Mercedes-Benz luxury line.\n\nIt’s the paradigm of unstated elegance. Dion drives the Maybach 62. The ultra-luxurious vehicle came with a $500,000 price tag. It comes standard with voice recognized navigation and top of the line cabin features. Massage seats. It wouldn’t be a Maybach without them. It’s quick and strong with a 5.5-liter twin-turbo V12 engine designed exclusively for the Maybach.\n\nMiley Cyrus\n\nMaserati Quattroporte $140K Pop diva and former Hannah Montana teen-bop sensation Miley Cyrus has racked up a substantial net worth for a person her age. Even without her husband’s net calculated in, she’s worth about $160 million. One of her favorite purchases is this sleek, white Maserati Quattroporte which she spent $140,000 to own. The classic Italian four-door sports luxury sedan is powerful and elegant, but it’s not her most valuable car. She has a McLaren MP4 12C.\n\nShe knows her cars! She also cruises around in a Porsche Cayenne. That luxury SUV ran her about $100,000. Her Mercedes SL500 is another sleek addition to her traveling options. Miley loves to sing karaoke on the road. One time, she hopped in the car with comedian James Corden for “Carpool Karaoke,” a segment for his Late Late Show.\n\nKatherine Heigl\n\nRange Rover Sport $108K Grey’s Anatomy star Katherine Heigl is one hot mama. She’s known for Knocked Up and The Ugly Truth. The attractive love-interest sparked a social media firestorm after posting a picture on Instagram of her one-year-old baby son adorably kicking it in his car seat. Instantly, a mommy shaming maelstrom commenced. Super aggressive trolling surprised everyone, especially the proud mama. The critics excoriated her for improperly harnessing the child.\n\nShe has a perfectly safe vehicle for her kids. Her cherry red Range Rover Sport is not just roomy, but an all-terrain monster truck disguised as a luxury SUV. It’s got four-wheel drive and a V8 supercharged engine. To own one, it’s a bit steep. Heigl’s Rover cost about $108,000.\n\nParis Hilton\n\nBentley GT Continental $400K One look at this Bentley GT, and it’s safe to say Paris Hilton’s man won’t be appropriating this ride. With Pepto-Bismol pink exterior and black and hot pink leather interior riding on pink rims, I’m pretty sure many women would turn down the keys for this car too. For Paris, it’s one of eight European luxury vehicles, this one’s a $400,000 Barbie car. What? Gotta have it. The dashboard is diamond-encrusted, that’s some serious bling.\n\nIt’s no secret she’s a Barbie fan, for years she’s confessed. This Barbie-mobile is for real! She sports the Barbie-themed car all over the Hollywood area. After paparazzi captured her, the folks over at Bentley were embarrassed enough to combat Hilton’s “brand-deflating” effect with a marketing overture to safeguard the 92-year-old pretentious automobile brand. She owns a few McLarens and Ferraris, plus there’s a Mercedes and a Rolls. She’s still got class.\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nFerrari 458 Italia $325K Kim Kardashian traded her Range Rover for this bright white Italian stallion. Her first reaction when she saw her new Ferrari 458 Italia was, “Isn’t it sick?!” She’s come a long way from being Paris Hilton’s stylist. Hubby, rapper Kanye West, and Kim have been married since 2014 and have four kids. She’s the highest-paid reality TV personality. But back to that swank new ride. It’s one of many. Kanye got a Black Lamborghini Aventador for his 36th birthday, sweet gift! The 458 is fast.\n\nThe supercar has a 4.5-liter V8 engine, 562 HP, and it hits a top speed of 202 mph. If Kim steps on it at the light, she’ll reach 60 mph in three seconds. See ya, paparazzi. Oh, wait. It’s her job to have her everyday life filmed. The more drama, the better. The car is one of her favorites, but it was an extravagant wedding gift for her and her former husband from a disreputable Malaysian businessman. There’s the drama.\n\nJay Z\n\nMaybach Exelero $8.8 Million There’s a story behind this lavish Maybach. Jay-Z’s pricey collection includes fine hypercar performance machines like his Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport and a Pagani Zonda F, an extravagant $670,000 elite Italian-Argentinian brand. But the $8.8 million German Maybach Exelero pictured here may not be his. Though he featured it in his music video “Lost One.” It wasn’t the first Maybach featured in his music videos. A Maybach 57 became a hip-hop legend. It starred in a video by Jay Z and Kanye West. The video for their self-proclaimed “luxury rap” song called “Otis” is from Watch the Throne, a collaboration album by Jay Z and Kanye. Shot by distinguished filmmaker Spike Jonze, “Otis” starts off with a bluesy R&B riff and shots of the car in its pristine condition. Enter a blow torch and a metal saw.\n\nThe rap duo cut the Maybach down to its frame as the beats drop in. It’s no exaggeration when they rap, “last week I was in my other, other Benz.” The characteristic rap-swagger continues while Jay-Z and Kanye race the shell of the Exelero through a dry flood control channel. Kanye did his own stunts performing 360-burnouts with four supermodels in the backseat. The end of the video announces the Maybach is up for charity auction. The value was placed at $150,000. The actual bid for the Save the Children donation fetched a mere $60,000. Not much to brag about.\n\nPuff Diddy\n\nRolls Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe $440K As the richest hip-hop artist, Sean “Puff Diddy” Combs’ net worth brushes up near billionaire status at $825 million. The music industry magnate started his own label in 1993, Bad Boy Entertainment. The entrepreneur also offers product. The Sean John luxury line retails his personal perfume fragrance called “I Am King,” naturally. But, what he truly prizes is his stunning automobile collection. Highlighted here is the Rolls Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe. The 2004 four-door British luxury sedan is the most expensive Rolls on the market priced at $440,000. P. Diddy picked out a custom silver and white convertible.\n\nThe lavish contemporary interior featuring hardwood veneering styled like the interior of a yacht makes the Phantom Drophead one of the rapper’s favorite cars to drive downtown. Amongst his collection is a 1997 Maybach 57, a $360,000 upscale Mercedes-Benz, exactly like the one Jay-Z and Kanye tore down. Jay Z purchased it for his son’s 16th birthday years before the 2011 song came out. The car included a chauffeur since the boy hadn’t gotten his license yet.\n\nNicolas Cage\n\nFerrari 250 GT Pininfarina $3.6 Million Nicolas Cage’s exotic automobile collection was sizable until he ran into a personal financial crisis. He liked to spend. He literally owned a castle, two actually: A German medieval castle in Schloss Neidstein and the English Midford Castle in Somerset. Yachts, an island in the Bahamas, fine artwork and 15 personal residences made the shopping list. It all came to a screeching halt once a $6.2 million tax bill came in at the peak of his over-spending binge. Four divorces probably didn’t help.\n\nIn the mid-2000s he began selling things off and spending less. As one item he kept is this stunning antique. One of his favorites, the 1958 Ferrari 250 GT Pininfarina is a rare classic. Only 350 models were manufactured by Ferrari between 1958 and 1960. Each model was hand-built by the legendary Italian automotive giant. Today, a vintage Pininfarina is worth $3.6 million. In 1958, the race car sold for $15,000.\n\nSeal\n\nBentley Azure $380K Why Seal? It reminds us of those adorable sea creatures. Hmm, the only other option may have been the acronym HOAS for Henry Olusegun Adeola Samuel, and we all know how unpopular HOAs are! The British pop sensation hit the charts royally and chilled with pop superstars Madonna and George Michael raising money for AIDS charities. One of his favorite rides is this beautiful Bentley Azure produced by the distinguished British automobile maker, Bentley Motors. The company was first purchased by Rolls Royce in 1931.\n\nAt the top of its class, Bentley first produced the Azure in 1995. It’s based on the Continental model but features an open-top convertible. The classy vehicle houses some power as well with a 6.75-liter V8 featuring an intercooler Garrett turbocharger. Priced to its class, Seal’s Bentley ran him $380,000. No word if German model Heidi Klum kept the posh ride after their divorce went through.\n\nKanye West\n\nMercedes SLR $850K Of course, Kanye loves his Lambo from ex-wife Kim, but Kanye West and Kim Kardashian own a fleet of exotic supercars and other priceless vehicles. The Mercedes-Benz SLR, however, is very special, indeed. It’s his “other, other Mercedes,” but not exactly. It’s what you get when you cross a McLaren with a Mercedes, namely, an American-British masterpiece. It’s a rare find. Called a light sports racer, the very last one was produced in 2010. The speed demon is powered by a 5.4-liter supercharged V8. It’s a 5-speed, and it’s lightning-fast.\n\nThe high-class performance takes the SLR from 0-60 in 3.4 seconds. Luckily, it’s got a high-tech brake system to slow it down. It holds a special place in Kanye’s heart, even though he’s owned it pre-Kim when he was still dating Amber Rose. (Drama. Gotta have it). Kanye showed off the exclusive McLaren SLR Stirling Moss edition at an AIDS charity gala in Cannes back in 2011. The nearly one-million-dollar gorgeous machine-turned lots of heads. It’s so sleek it doesn’t even have a windshield! (Helmets for protection?)\n\nSimon Cowell\n\nBugatti Veyron $1.7 Million World-famous TV star Simon Cowell lords over the reality TV talent circuit. He’s been a judge at American Idol, Britain’s Got Talent, Pop Idol and America’s Got Talent. Now, the British celeb quick with an abrasive dig serves as the judge at his very own The X Factor. Long story short, he’s rich. He made The Sunday Times, Britain’s largest newspaper’s “Rich List,” clocking in with a net worth of £325 million. So, it makes sense he picked up a Veyron, the world’s most expensive car. By now, he’s trimmed the Bugatti from his massive exotic car stockpile.\n\nHe purchased the stunning custom black 2008 custom Bugatti Veyron for $1.7 million and got rid of it, in mint condition, for $1.375 million. He told Ellen DeGeneres he only drove the French engineering masterpiece twice. He must have let his friends take a spin because the high-end hypercar registered 1,300 miles on the odometer.\n\nDavid Beckham\n\nRolls Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe $400K David Beckham is another British pop icon. Venerated nationally as England’s best footballer, he’s also a super-successful fashion icon and model. He legendarily married Posh Spice at the height of Spice Girl-mania. As a Manchester United player, he was well-compensated for his athletic supremacy becoming the highest-paid footballer in 2013 and grossing $50 million for a single season.\n\nHe put the money to good use. Check out this Rolls Royce Phantom Drop Head. Naturally, he chose to drive a British, ahem, the British luxury brand. If it’s good enough for the Queen of England, it’s perfect for Beckham and Victoria. It is the most expensive model Rolls Royce offers. With the amount of rain in England, it’s a little surprising he chose the convertible, but “Beckingham Palace” is not their only digs, they own beautiful properties all around Europe.\n\nTom Hardy\n\nAudi R8 Spyder $160K As a self-described “Audi boy,” Tom Hardy dotes over his custom matte black Audi. He loves the maker so much he took the Audi RS 5 Cabriolet for a test-drive at The Auto Channel. What a treat for Audi. At least he didn’t drive it like the Marvel action superheroes he plays! Hardy has a nice assortment of these well-crafted German automobiles. Besides the Audi R8, he owns an Audi Q5. Naturally, he kept the vehicle he test-drove, the Audi RS 5 convertible, in red.\n\nHe says it’s the perfect car to get you from point A to point B in “comfort and class.” Hardy admits that he wears his North Face jacket while driving through London’s fog with the top down. His Audi R8 Spyder is also a convertible. The car rivals the Porsche 911 in speed and acceleration. Its safety features are top of the line. So is the Spyder. The price tag for the Spyder is $160,000. His R8 has a V8. It’s Audi’s version of the supercar.\n\nChris Brown\n\nLamborghini Aventador $450K Chris Brown is a Grammy-winning entertainer who has sold over 120 million records. That was enough for the celeb to step it up with a Lamborghini Aventador. He purchased his supercar in 2015. At $450,000, it’s one of the most expensive rides. The Lamborghini “fighting bull” is a fierce performance machine built for roaring speeds and immaculate handling, but it’s not the most expensive Lambo. That award goes to the Lamborghini Veneno, a $4.5 million supercar that’s even more powerful than an Aventador. It’s the rarest and most expensive Lambo ever - only 14 were built. But back to Brown’s beauty. Sadly, one of his friends totaled it in Beverly Hills.\n\nHe Instagram’d the news, saying, in 2017, “Breezy is ok.” The twisted metal carcass was totally redone. He had the boys down at RDB LA transform his matte black wrecked Lambo into a sparkling eye-popper. Breezy ordered it gold-wrapped. Instead of new paint, it looks like it’s entirely redone in gold chrome. It’s shiny! All the way down to its gold Forgiato wheels. None of his friends have keys to the car any longer.\n\nConor McGregor\n\nRolls Royce Dawn $350K This Irish MMA fighter is pressing our testostero-meter to its limit. Conor McGregor is formidable. The man’s virility is so overwhelming he wears pink and turquoise to tone down the heat. A look into his garage pumps it up. McGregor’s supercar collection is an assortment of power and speed, a reflection of this fighter in the ring. In 2017, he added a Rolls Royce Dawn to his fleet. The sophisticated add put him back $350,000.\n\nHe said driving the Rolls is like “driving a bouncy castle with wheels.” The somewhat scrappy UFC superstar emblazoned on the side of the Rolls with his The Notorious MMA logo. The black luxury sedan looks so prestigious from the front view. This must-have sent the Rolls Royce’s marketing crew into panic mode.\n\nCameron Diaz\n\nToyota Prius $28K Like many Hollywood A-listers, Cameron Diaz opted to drive the Toyota Prius, the hybrid standard. Getting around town without contributing to Climate Catastrophe is a huge reprieve on the conscience. Stars know that fans will emulate their choices, so it’s an eco-choice that reverberates around the world. And it’s affordable!\n\nThis little Prius cost just over $28,000. Diaz was one of the first Prius supporters, endorsing the car back in 2002. She was excited and bragging that her new car gets 52 mpg in the city. “Isn’t that exciting?” she asked. The only car that can outdo that mileage is an all-electric!\n\nMel Gibson\n\nToyota Cressida $7K Another celeb who likes to keep it modest is Mel Gibson. Please humor me as I quote a TMZ headline regarding Gibson’s midrange 3.0-liter Toyota 4-door sedan. It’s his preferred ride. They named it the “Passion of the Cressida.” Totally meme-worthy.\n\nYou have to admit, the image of the Braveheart star navigating a sky-blue commuter car instead of a Mad Max renegade vehicle is at first a little disconcerting. Maybe the Lethal Weapon stud is not a car guy.\n\nJohn Goodman\n\nFord F-150 $34K The Roseanne star who became a movie A-lister with a $65 million net worth would rather drive a modest vehicle than a flashy supercar. Comedian and actor John Goodman appeared as Conan O’Brien’s first guest on the late-night show and he’s a frequent and popular guest at SNL. The down-to-earth movie star is really laid back.\n\nHe drives a Ford 4.2-liter V6 F-150 pickup. He’s also rumored to drive a Mercedes-Benz with an “Abide” bumper sticker in deference to the Dude. Come to think about it, can you picture the burly average-guy Goodman behind the wheel of a tricked-out Lambo? Maybe for a comedy skit.\n\nJustin Timberlake\n\nVolkswagen Jetta $16K Justin Timberlake loves his Jetta, but he also loves his vintage Alfa Romeo Spider, his BMW 5-series and the rest of his fine assemblage. He owns quite a few Audis. Smitten with the brand, like so many Hollywood stars, the former boy band sensation partnered with Audi in 2010. He jumped in feet first with the car company as the spokesman for the Audi A1 line which led to him starring in a Super Bowl ad. His 2002 Jetta, a $16,000 purchase, is hardly worthy of mention, but he’s held onto it all these years, so there must be some personal sentimental value attached to it.\n\nHe also stores an Audi 1, Audi 4, Audi Q7, Audi TT, and an Audi 8. His wife, actress Jessica Biel, is a serious car lover. She brought a Lamborghini Aventador Roadster into the mix! Timberlake, for his part, brought in a respectable ride. The luxury and class standard, a Bentley Continental GT.\n\nBlac Chyna\n\nRolls Royce Wraith $400K Reality TV star Blac Chyna is a cosmetic industry queen. She runs her private makeup line, Lashed by Blac Chyna, and opened an L.A. beauty salon. The savvy entrepreneur has amassed a fortune and a fairly extensive exotic car collection. She has a weakness for a Rolls Royce. Her relationship with Rob Kardashian may not have fared well, to say the least, but she recently brought home a brand-new Rolls Royce Dawn. Victory.\n\nTop of the line, customized and finished to match the rest of her fleet: limousine white with platinum trim. Her last Rolls, pictured here, is a Wraith model purchased to bring her baby girl home from the hospital. The Wraith cost her a cool $400,000. Her new Dawn cost about $450,000. It came with the “spirit of ecstasy” hood ornament, and it gets a primitive 14 mpg.\n\nJennifer Lawrence\n\nVolkswagen Eos $25K Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawrence is a Hollywood phenom. She’s the youngest person to win an Oscar and the highest-paid actress in the world. All this while she’s still in her twenties! She’s just getting started. Despite her success, she doesn’t flaunt her wealth. Her vehicle of choice is a Volkswagen Eos. She drives a convertible - an attractive yet sensible model, with the solid dependability of German engineering.\n\nHer model is discontinued. It was produced from 2006 to 2015 and was the first convertible compact coupe VW released in two decades. Perhaps she was drawn to the name. The VW Eos was named after the Greek goddess of the dawn. Which actress doesn’t appreciate Greek theatre and mythology?\n\nLil Wayne\n\nBugatti Veyron $2.5 Million Some celebs live low-key. Not Lil Wayne. Rappers like Lil Wayne make a living flauntin’ it. He bought the magnificent Veyron because he wanted it, not because he wanted to be the first self-proclaimed African American rapper to own one. In his own words, “I got it because I said, ‘Man, I heard they got a fucking car that’s a million dollars, I want it.’” Simple as that. So, “I spent one-point-eight million of my hard-earned money to buy this motherfucking car I had heard about called the Bugatti,” he said.\n\nHe had to have it. Lil Wayne professed this to videographer “Derrick G” in a 2011 YouTube video published by Celebrity Cars. In 2017 Lil Wayne released a song called “Bugatti.” He’s proud of his French-made performance machine. Like most of his hip-hop brethren, he holds a decent collection of fine automobiles. He rides a Porsche Boxster, a Mercedes SLS AMG, a Rolls Royce Phantom and a Maybach 62.\n\nT-Pain\n\nBugatti Veyron $1.8 Million Rapper T-Pain, also known as Faheem Rashad Najm, is an American rapper. So, it should come as no surprise that he has a prestigious collection of exotic cars. Especially because, besides his lucrative hip-hop career, he owns a custom car shop. He is ranked as one of the highest-earning hip-hop artists. T-Pain owns 32 of his favorite automobiles, but the crème-de-la-crème of his fine assemblage was the revered Bugatti Byron pictured here.\n\nHe picked it up in 2008 for $1.8 million. He sold the car in 2014 for $1 million because wear and tear damaged the radiator. T-Pain enjoyed driving the performance machine. He didn’t lock it up like a museum relic. Costs to fix the Bugatti were excessive, so he dumped it and picked up a Lambo, a Ferrari, and a McLaren to replace it. Nice trade. One of the most unusual cars he has amassed is his 1991 orange and light blue Cadillac hearse. He named it Danielle Marino. All of his cars have names.\n\nDrake\n\nBugatti Veyron Sang Noir $2.5 Million Canadian rapper, Aubrey “Drake” Graham turned his teen acting profession into a smash-hit hip-hop career producing a net worth of $100 million. He invests a healthy portion of his proceeds into his collection. One of the most precious vehicles he has owned is the monster hypercar, the Bugatti Veyron Sang Noir. This supercar is super-rare. Bugatti, a 1909 French automotive company, founded by Ettore Bugatti (now under the Volkswagen umbrella), produced only 15 of the exclusive Sang Noir models. Like the standard Veyron, it features an 8.0-liter W16 engine.\n\nWith 4-turbochargers, it delivers a 987-horsepower machine capable of speeds up to 253 mph. Drake’s was black and shiny with an eye-popping orange interior, the only Sang Noir in Canada. He put it up for sale in 2014 due to mechanical issues. It was not his only hypercar. He owns a Lamborghini Aventador Roadster and a McLaren 675 LT.\n\nAmber Rose\n\nJeep Wrangler Unlimited $150K Amber Rose made a splash when she customized her Jeep Wrangler into a Bubblicious-pink off-road machine. The fashion model and former girlfriend of Kanye West ended up marrying rapper Wiz Khalifa instead, however, that didn’t work out either. She loves her Jeep, though, and she loves to dress it up in new styles. First, she chose the Barbie-look wrapped in hot pink. Then she added chrome and some serious off-road features like a bull bar. Finally, she’s taken her Jeep back to its original form. She always trusts Roadstarr Motorsports to polish her Wrangler.\n\nMost recently they’ve dolled it up in a respectable matte army green wrap with black trim. She got her foot in the door of the entertainment industry starring in hip-hop music videos. Before she was rich and famous, Rose had to work as a stripper to support her family. Now she’s a feminist making money legit.\n\nRonda Rousey\n\nCorvette C7 Stingray $60K Former UFC martial arts champion Ronda Rousey mixes it up on the WWE circuit these days. “Rowdy” the wrestler performs for the industry-standard Raw brand. Her nickname was acquired by Roddy “Rowdy” Piper. Rousey is one of the world’s best athletes and a savvy ambassador of her brand. Recently, she’s taking a break from the pro wrestling gig to conceive a child.\n\nShe and her hubby Travis Browne announced the happy news on Instagram. She may not return until 2021. The director of Entourage said she was cast because “she’s beautiful, and she can kick your butt.” It’s no surprise then, she prefers a little muscle behind her driving machines. In that movie, she sported a candy apple red Chevy Corvette Stingray. Apparently, she got to keep it. It’s a 455 HP 6.2-liter V8 that hits a top speed of 185 mph. Respectable.\n\nBirdman\n\nMaybach Exelero $8.8 Million Music maven Birdman was born Bryan Christopher Williams. The popular hip-hop artist is also a shrewd record executive. His record label Cash Money Records produces the Rich Gang project promoting new artists like Young Thug and Rich Homie Quan. It’s about the money. Birdman already owned two $1 million-plus rides before he got into this exclusive Maybach Exelero. He is yet another rapper who owns a Bugatti Veyron. (Lil’ Wayne truly started something!) He already owned a $1.35 million Maybach Landaulet, but he had to have the $8 million Maybach model too.\n\nHe reported as much on his Twitter page, announcing the acquisition and the kingly sum he paid for it: “They got this new Maybach that I want that costs $8 million, I gotta have it.” He was hoping to custom his luxury vehicle in red. No word if the purchase from European entrepreneur Arnaud Massartic went through, they hadn’t heard back from the rapper. But he posted a picture on Twitter, it must be true! Regardless, $8 million is a lot of cash. He could have picked up a decent mansion or a sleek New York penthouse for that.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo\n\nBugatti Veyron $2.5 Million Rumors footballer aficionado Cristiano Ronaldo purchased the current most expensive car on the market, a Bugatti La Voiture Noire (French for “the black car”) circled the internet. Priced at over $18 million, it blows away any competition. The Voiture was built to commemorate Bugatti’s 110th anniversary. It’s an 8.0-liter turbocharged W16 beast that cruises to 261 mph. For safety, the 1,500 horsepower hypercar is electronically limited to that speed. If the rumor is true, he is the lucky owner of Bugatti’s brand-new concept car that was unveiled at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show. However, it won’t be fully built and ready to drive for two more years. In the meantime, Ronaldo has two other Bugatti’s to cruise. Pictured here is his Veyron.\n\nIt’s a $1.7 million prize car. Ronaldo has an obvious affection for the brand. He scored his Bugatti Chiron after filming a commercial for Bugatti. The ad features the gorgeous lines of his new machine as he races around the test-driving track like the champion he is. The French automobile manufacturer is not his only sponsor, by far. He holds a rare lifetime contract with Nike. He showed off his new $3 million Chiron hypercar on Instagram. You’re probably wondering about the athlete’s net worth at this point. He may soon be a billionaire. He clocks in at about $93 million.\n\nJustin Bieber\n\nAudi R8 $250K Superstar Justin Bieber loves to drive fast and customize his rides. He dumped $150,000 styling out this Audi R8 to his perfection. Meow! The car really scoots, hitting 60 mph in approximately four seconds. Cruising the streets of L.A. or Miami, Bieber’s known to drag race. Hip-hop singer Everlast once detailed an encounter with the Bieb at a red light for The Joe Rogan Experience host. They raced off when it turned green. Sadly, Bieber no longer has the leopard-print Audi and went black. He does have a wide variety of luxury and exotic cars, however.\n\nIn the Italian wing, he owns a Lamborghini Gallardo, a Lamborghini Aventador, a Ferrari 458 Italia, and Ferrari 430. On the German side, he has a Mercedes-Benz Maybach S600, and a Porsche 997 Turbo. The Danish electric-hybrid eco-friendly supercar shows he cares about global warming. And, finally, his American wing includes a Cadillac CTS V Coupe, in matte black, also known as his “Bat Mobile.”\n\nColin Farrell\n\nFord Bronco $11K Colin Farrell does not seem to value cars for anything but their practical purposes. He’s picked up this useful 1996 Ford Bronco for about $11,000. Colin Farrell is an Irish actor known for his role in Miami Vice and Minority Report. The bad boy actor did admit to liking a little MGB Roadster that he also owns. It’s a vintage model, a little convertible, and he says he drives it around Dublin once in a while. More recently, Farrell has starred in Horrible Bosses and Total Recall.\n\nHe was Percival Graves in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. The actor supports charities like the Special Olympics. He was the spokesman for the 2007 games in China. He raises awareness for LGBT rights, anti-bullying, and Homelessness and supports organizations Stand Up! and BeLonG.\n\nDavid Spade\n\nBuick Grand National $33K Comedian David Spade, SNL cast member legend has made us laugh in movies too, yet skits like the Church Lady are indelibly entertaining. It seems completely reasonable that the funny man would choose to hang on to his 1987 Buick Grand National in beat-up condition. In fact, he and Jay Leno took a drive in Spade’s well-worn car, appreciating its finer qualities, though Spade did admit the car has a “troublemaker” vibe to it.\n\nHe restored it to its mint condition, spending $9,000 on the work. One happy car collector will be the proud owner of this comedic icon’s former ride. The Buick is personally signed by David Spade, all-inclusive of the $33,000 asking price. Spade began purchasing old cars after his role in Joe Dirt sparked an interest in the hobby. The Buick was his first buy.\n\nDevin Hester\n\nChevrolet Impala $250K The Chevy Impala is a classic American muscle car that became somewhat of a cultural icon. For example, television show CW’s Supernatural featured an old, black 2-door 1967 Chevy Impala. The car, called “Baby,” mirrored the popularity of the TV show’s star characters. Meanwhile, collecting American muscle caught on as people like David Spade were drawn to the hobby. Chicago Bears wide receiver Devin Hester caught the restoration bug too.\n\nHis 1972 Impala, fully restored, it cost him $250,000 to make it into a classic car masterpiece. Inside it has Porsche imported leather, handmade dash, doors and console, custom everything. On the outside, it’s custom red pearl candy paint with a custom convertible top and grill. The NFL great absolutely adores it.\n\nAntonio Brown\n\nRolls Royce Phantom $500K As a wide receiver for the Pittsburgh Steelers, Antonio Brown ran yards, lots of yards. At Oakland, the Raiders made the ostentatious player the highest-paid receiver in the league. His Stealer pride, demonstrated by this customized Rolls Royce Phantom Steelers-mobile, will have to be re-customized. Change out that gold race stripe for silver on that $500,000 ride. Instead, Brown showed up to Raiders camp in Napa on day-one in a hot-air balloon.\n\nHe could have arrived in his vintage 1931 Rolls Royce. Traditionally, he had ceremoniously pulled up to Stealer camp in his matching luxury vessel. When he landed in the hot-air balloon, he proclaimed, “Raider Nation, I’m here, Napa. It’s time to get to work baby. Float like a butterfly, sting like AB.”\n\nSteven Tyler\n\nHennessey Venom GT Spyder $1.1 Million Aerosmith classic rock icon Steven Tyler, composer of “Dude (Looks like A Lady)” and other rock ballads, could not have purchased a vehicle that better represents his personality. He was the first driver in the world to purchase a Hennessey Venom GT Spyder. The gorgeous machine, a glossy black curvy body packs a twin-turbocharged 7.0-liter V8 producing 1,200 horsepower and a ton of torque. Like a rocket, it hits 60 mph in 2.7 seconds. The beauty debuted at the 2011 Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance. Tyler test-drove the Spyder and waited two hours before placing his order. After eight years of a wonderful relationship, the two have parted.\n\nTyler auctioned the sleek hypercar off to charity to raise medical research funds for our veterans. It was purchased for $800,000! The Good Samaritan originally paid $1.1 million for the Hennessey Venom. The craft was built by the Texas-based Hennessey Performance Engineering company which specializes in modifying supercars.\n\nGwen Stefani\n\nPorsche Panamera $200K “Take this big ribbon off my eyes / I’m exposed, and it’s no big surprise.” Gwen Stefani is still just a girl performing her music two-plus decades after releasing No Doubt’s phenomenal album Tragic Kingdom. By now, Stefani has a nice fleet of fun cars to drive. The Southern California artist traded in her Italian Maserati to snag a $200K full-sized luxury Porsche Panamera model. Under the hood is a German-engineered 4.8-liter Twin Turbo 507 PS V8.\n\nIt’s like having the comfort of a Maserati in a Porsche. Now she has another Maserati, the amazing Quattroporte model. They call their luxury sedan a purveyor of “race-bred excitement.” It’s exciting because it’s fast and lavish. Rapturous. She also drives a Range Rover and a Mercedes-Benz G-Wagon. Those are two serious station wagons for shuttling the fam!\n\nNicki Minaj\n\nLamborghini Aventador $400K The performance machine designed for rocketing speed and steady handling is called the Lamborghini Aventador. In Italian, it means “fighting bull.” Nicki Minaj may be the only person in the world capable of making an aggressive bull blush. There are no words. The rap act Nicki Minaj, as she calls herself, flows into fashion modeling, acting, any genre of performing. She’s the most-followed rapper on Instagram, she’s been a judge on American Idol.\n\nShe’s a super-pop phenom who digs customizing the most virility-charged supercar into a Barbie convertible. Is it a statement of feminine strength and independence? Or a mortification of her gender? The entertainer has a few other options tucked away. A Range Rover, a Maybach, and a 1965 El Camino muscle car.\n\nTom Brady\n\nBugatti Veyron Super Sport $3 Million Tom Brady, the greatest pro football quarterback who ever lived, or at least the winningest quarterback in NFL history, hardly requires an introduction. Anti-Patriots fans defame his name and troll him on a daily basis, ostensibly, out of a lack of having a life. Brady has a great life. The health nut is married to German supermodel Gisele Bündchen who makes twice as much as he does and bought him a $3 million Bugatti Veyron Super Sport as a gift.\n\nIn 2017, Brady teamed up with the British Aston Martin luxury brand. He loves his Aston Martin, but the gear head doesn’t discriminate. He drives a Rolls Royce Ghost, Audi R8, and, of course, the Veyron.\n\nJohn Cena\n\nFord GT $400K American pro wrestler and Twitter self-help guru John Cena is an entertainment pop star personality too. He’s got it all, this $460,000 liquid blue Ford GT to boot. Or had. When he sold it, he made more than $1 million more than he paid for it! Winner! Until he was slapped with a $75,000 lawsuit by Ford for selling it. America’s oldest carmaker, in an apparent hissy fit, complained that Cena’s high-profile celebrity discount on the limited-edition, 647 horsepower GT had been sorely disrespected. Ford won.\n\nCena settled for an undisclosed amount. He failed to notice the fine print, anti-flip clause he signed up for when he first purchased the supercar from Ford. In the industry, cushy deals with the rich and famous to buy and promote their brand on social media is more common than you think.\n\nCandice Swanepoel\n\nMercedes-Benz SLS Convertible $135K The stunning Candice Swanepoel, a South African fashion supermodel and Victoria's Secret Angel, is one of the highest-paid models in the world. Forbes ranked her at 8th in 2016. She’s married to Brazilian model Hermann Nicoli who she met in Paris when she was 17. They have two children and live in Manhattan and Brazil. Swanepoel said that being a mom of two very young children is “intense!”\n\nShe’s a down-to-earth mama who promotes women’s rights to breastfeed in public by sharing photos on Instagram. She also posed with her infant in her Tesla Model X. The gorgeous mother owns a Mercedes-Benz SLS Convertible, too. Unlike the Tesla, the Mercedes get 19 mpg, tops.\n\nAkon\n\nSpyker C8 $350K Wealthy rappers like Akon certainly showcase the world’s most sophisticated cars. This Spyker C8 purchased by Akon for about $350,000 is a supercar worthy of the likes of the Lambo Aventador and Ferrari F12. The Spyker C8 houses a 4.2-liter V8 sourced from Audi and supercharged to 518 hp. It’s a luxury supercar that zips to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds. It comes from a boutique automaker in Holland. Classic rap artist Akon had his Spyker custom finished in white.\n\nHe’s finished his entire collection to match. His garage hosts a Porsche Panamera, a Ferrari 458 Italia, a Lamborghini Gallardo and a Lambo Murciélago, all customized in elegant white. It must look like a professional fleet of private luxury transport.\n\nMichael B. Jordan\n\nHonda Acura NSX $156K Creed star Michael B. Jordan, not to be confused with the legendary Bulls great, is making a name for himself. You may recognize him as shooting victim Oscar Grant in Fruitvale Station and the voice behind Black Panther’s supervillain Erik Killmonger. Jordan hooked up with Acura to voice an ad for the company’s precision performance craft, the Acura NSX. He loves the car so much that he picked one up for himself for $156,000.\n\nThe Japanese car company’s veritable supercar is heavy on performance with a rear 3.5-liter twin-turbo V6 engine. Producing 500 hp, the sleek machine zooms 0-60 in less than three seconds. But the NSX, built of aircraft-grade aluminum, is a step above. Featuring a set of three electric motors, the sports car is a hybrid that achieves 21 mpg. It doesn’t sound like much, but it doubles the Veyron’s fuel efficiency deficiencies. Currently, he’s working with filmmaker great Denzel Washington on the Journal for Jordan project.\n\nTiger Woods\n\nPorsche Carrera GT $440K Golf maestro Tiger Woods doesn’t own a fleet of exotic supercars like most of his colleagues. Instead, he boasts of a set of fine American-made Buicks. A standout to his collection is this Porsche Carrera GT. The rare supercar holds a 5.7-liter V10 engine that pushes out 435 pounds of torque, an engine originally built for Formula One racing. Yep, it’s fast. Advanced technology activates the rear spoiler wing at speeds over 70 mph to reduce lift. It jets to 60 mph in a snap, officially clocked at 2.06 seconds.\n\nTiger owns the “superclass” model, a limited Porsche, one of only 1,270 units produced. He paid $440,000 for the hypercar. Just imagine how much it will be worth in twenty years. To be fair, Woods owns a speedy, souped-up golf cart that blows out the competition and leaves them in the dust zipping away at 28 mph. Not to mention a Lamborghini Murciélago and a Mercedes-Benz S65.\n\nShaquille O’Neal\n\nFord F-650 Supercrew $124K Massive Lakers legend, Shaquille O’Neal is a truck man but he collects cars as well. One of his properties, the Orlando estate, boasts a 17-car garage. Instilling his love for cars, he bought his son not one, but two supercars for his 16th birthday, including a Lambo. Caveat. He won’t be able to drive it until he pulls himself out of a B-average. But back to his truck collection. Originally, the basketball legend owned a 2009 Ford F-350.\n\nThe F-350 is a heavy-duty Lariat model super modified to an upscale luxury chariot that only Shaq has. He sold it on Auto Trader in 2013. Now he owns a gigantic truck as big as the man himself. Staying with Ford, O’Neal picked up the SuperTruck of trucks, an F-650! Even before he customized it for $124,150, it came stocked with high-tech navigation and entertainment, heated seats, and a 6.7-liter Powerstroke V8 diesel engine with 330 horsepower and 750 pound-feet of torque. It also comes stocked with a cab that can handle the driver. At 7-foot-1, 325 pounds, he’s had to customize most of his other cars for size.\n\nMeghan Markle\n\nJaguar E-Type Priceless Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle, from Southern California, started as a movie star. Marrying into the British royal family by wedding Prince Harry, the grandson of the Queen finds her the proud owner of this rare and beautiful steel-blue Jaguar E-Type. The electric ultra-luxury vehicle was a one-of-a-kind, exclusive model reserved especially for the newlywed royal couple’s ceremonious transport from Windsor Castle to the reception.\n\nThe priceless prototype she and Prince Harry own has finally become available to the buying public, by private order only. The Jaguar E-Type is a vintage-styled convertible based on the 1968 model that Enzo Ferrari called “the most beautiful car in the world.” Their E-Type Concept Zero Jaguar produces zero emissions and travels a range of 170 miles on a full charge. It is zippy-fast, racing 0-60 in 5.5 seconds.\n\nJamie Foxx\n\nRezvani Tank $178K Popular American entertainer Jamie Foxx is known for his Oscar-winning role portraying Ray Charles. He’s a Grammy-winning musician with chart-topping singles. And he’s loved as a stand-up comedian. Is he trying to be funny with one of his new rides? It’s a tank. Literally. The Rezvani Tank he bought cost $178,000, reasonable compared with his custom Bugatti Veyron wrapped in gold, but how much protection does he need running Nobu to grab a bite? The military-grade monster truck is stylistically based on the Jeep Wrangler.\n\nIt’s a 500-horsepower V8 beast replete with night vision, a thermal camera, and bullet-resistant armor built of Kevlar. The fuel tanks are also made of Kevlar. It’s built to withstand Mad Max scenarios! The extreme machine, built by Rezvani Motors, home of the Rezvani Beast supercar, is based in Irvine, California. It was founded by Iranian-American Ferris Rezvani, a former Aston Martin executive. “Tank,” the company’s extreme SUV, premiered November 2017.\n\nDenise Richards\n\nCadillac Escalade $75K Drop-dead gorgeous fashion model and Hollywood star Denise Richards got her break in a music video she starred in as a 15-year-old. The sky’s the limit since then, and now she’s sitting pretty with a $12 million net worth. For getting around town, Richards purchased this slick black Cadillac Escalade for $75,000. It’s a powerfully smooth ride with a lavishly comfy interior. It’s the perfect mode of transportation for herself and her three kids, and husband Aaron Phypers.\n\nShe has two daughters from her first marriage with Charlie Sheen who she met in 1991 filming the comedy Loaded Weapon 1. Also, the Escalade can get her to the set of The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills. The actress was brought on board for its ninth season.\n\nManny Pacquiao\n\nFerrari 458 Italia $270K Manny Pacquiao is a world champion boxer from the Philippines who raked in over a billion dollars on pay-per-view earnings making him the second-highest-paid athlete in 2015. More recently, he’s appropriated his fame and influence to get elected as a Senator in the Philippine government representing the province of Sarangani. Though, he continues to fight as an eight-division world champion. He won the seat in a landslide victory and is insanely popular. His biggest problem? He was smacked with a $75 million tax evasion lawsuit. For his part, Pacquiao vows to eradicate poverty by his role in government.\n\nHis rags to riches story began as a 14-year-old living on the street becoming a boxer. Now he can live in any home he wants and drive the most expensive cars. Here he is pictured with his Ferrari 458 Italia, a high-end Italian engineering machine with a $270,000 price tag. He also enjoys cruising his Porsche Cayenne Turbo, his Mercedes-Benz SLK and his Lincoln Navigator.\n\nAustin Mahone\n\nBMW i8 $148K This young lad got his start as a teen posting YouTube videos. Austin Mahone grew up in San Antonio, Texas and became a pop music star. In 2012, he was the “Teen Ambassador” for Lil Wayne’s clothing line. Mahone features rapper Flo Rida in his song “Say You’re Just a Friend” and he toured with Taylor Swift. Elektra Records released his single “Why Don’t We” in 2019. Austin is just getting started. Hitting it big as a teen, he shelled out for this sleek BMW i8.\n\nThe hybrid plug-in supercar runs on a 7.1 lithium-ion battery with a fuel efficiency of 76 mpg! It’s quick too. The i8 bolts to 60 mph in 4.4 seconds. He paid $148,000 for the car. On top of that, Mahone had it customized by Miami-based Metro Wrapz. In a few years, he’ll have a collection as extensive as the rest of his rapper colleagues!\n\n50 Cent\n\nLamborghini Murciélago $2 Million Curtis James Jackson III has come a long way since growing up in NYC in a South Jamaican quarter of Queens dealing drugs as a 12-year-old during the ‘80s crack epidemic. 50 Cent was discovered by Eminem who took him in at Shady Records under the wing of Dr. Dre’s production company. Thirty million album sales later, 50 cent has a $30 million net worth. He also has this Lamborghini Murciélago that cost $2 million.\n\nThat’s along with his Chrome Lamborghini Gallardo, Ferrari F430 (some serious prize), a Range Rover, Bentley, Rolls Royce, and Pontiac G8. Most recently, he flaunted his custom Versace Lamborghini on Instagram wearing a matching gold and royal blue Versace outfit. It’s something to see. He’s not shy about showboating his outrageous style.\n\nThe Game\n\nBugatti Veyron $2.2 Million The Game’s rap act is as flamboyant and lucrative as the rest. He’s a West Coast rap scene performer born and raised in the downtown L.A. neighborhood of Compton. His third studio album titled LAX gives you an idea of his vicinity. Jayceon Tarrell Taylor was born to parents active in the infamous Crips gang living in a Crips area. The Game joined the Bloods with his brother. “Dysfunctional” is one way to describe his upbringing, at least that’s what Game told MTV News. In 2016, the rapper was targeted in a drive-by shooting.\n\nHis Mercedes G-Wagon took a few pockmarks, but no one was shot. He’s legit. His brother was shot and killed at age 17 and Game nearly died from shot wounds in 2001. The loss of his brother and his own survival influenced and inspired the rapper. Here’s his Bugatti Veyron custom painted and worth about $2.2 million. It’s just one in his extensive assemblage that he brags of and catalogs on his Instagram page. If you see a red candy apple Porsche Panamera Turbo ripping through the L.A. area, it’s probably The Game.\n\nFlo Rida\n\nBugatti Veyron $1.7 Million You probably won’t be surprised to learn Flo Rida, also known as Tramar Lacel Dillard, is from Florida. He’s an extremely successful hip-hop artist with a flashy grin. With his success, what’s not to smile about? Well, maybe that Miami Beach DUI acquired while cruising one of his Bugatti Veyrons, the $1.7 million chrome wrapped one.\n\nPictured here is his other $1.7 million Veyron, wrapped in gold chrome. It’s eye-popping, yet indulgent, like a giant gold-foil chocolate Easter Bunny. Hit songs like “Low” and his reboot “Right Round” of the Eighties Dead or Alive band “You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)” have fueled his tanks. More to come. He dropped the news on Instagram that an album’s due out this year.\n\nFloyd Mayweather\n\nKoenigsegg CCXR Trevita $4.8 Million Ah, the Koenigsegg. Known for out-performing the Bugatti Veyron to become the world’s fastest car. This magnificent feat occurred in November of 2017. Also noteworthy, it doubled the price of the latter. The Koenigsegg hypercar, a product of Sweden, came out of the 25-year-old performance machine automotive manufacturer. In 2002, their first street-legal car, the CC8S was introduced. What our undefeated world boxing champion Floyd Mayweather, Jr. owns here is the formidable CCXR Trevita, unveiled in 2006 and one of only two models built. “Trevita,” from Swedish, is “three whites,” referring to the Trevita’s body which is made of Koenigsegg’s proprietary diamond-coated carbon fiber.\n\nIt runs on gasoline and biofuel reaching top speeds of 245 mph. In 2017, it was the Koenigsegg Agera that beat the Bugatti at a blistering 278 mph. For Mayweather, owning the rare Koenigsegg is a statement. Similar to an art collector, it’s akin to owning an original masterwork, just as many of the rare and valuable cars on this list. World-class athletes like Mayweather who hold hundreds of millions of dollars in net worth get to make exciting investments!\n\nKyle Busch\n\nChevrolet Bel Air $99K NASCAR racer Kyle Busch has been dominating the track by out-winning drivers consistently. These guys get paid per victory. Busch does a victory lap practically every other race, replete with the requisite 360 burn-outs that are greatly anticipated and appreciated by NASCAR fans. Busch loves his fans, he loves racing for M&M, he loves fast cars and is lucky enough to race one each week. Zooming around the track at 180-200 mph for four hours at a time, what a fantastic job!\n\nForgetting where he was, in 2011 Busch was cited for reckless driving when he “got carried away” test driving a Lexus LFA. He was clocked at 128 mph. Apparently, ‘I’m-a-professional-I-know-what-I’m-doing’ didn’t pan out. Collecting vintage cars is a hobby of his. He has this classic 1956 Bel Air two-tone coupe. He purchased the beautiful old car for $99,000. To acquire it, he sold off his classic yellow Corvette Z06 and an ultra-classic 1969 Camaro. Driving the Bel Air helps him keep his speed down.\n\nDale Earnhardt, Jr.\n\nCamaro $3K Like his father, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. is a racing great. He’s a two-time Daytona 500 winner at Daytona International Speedway with a $400 million net worth. This makes him the wealthiest NASCAR racer ever. He’s semi-retired now, but he has fun racing the No. 8 Chevrolet Camaro for JR Motorsports and doing commentary as an NBC NASCAR analyst.\n\nNo surprise, he’s a classic car buff. He picked up a vintage 1967 Chevrolet Camaro for $3,539 after having spotted it at Charlotte Motor Speedway during Auto Fair. He purchased it because he loves the car’s feel of power and grip. It’s one of his favorites. Earnhardt had it fully restored and customized with NASCAR features, subtle enough so that anyone would love it. Classy.\n\nJoe Haden\n\nLamborghini Aventador $1.1 Million NFL star Joe Haden played cornerback for the Cleveland Browns. His team may not have fared too well, but Haden scored big with a $50 million contract. He put his salary to good use. He bought a Lamborghini Aventador and had it custom-painted in Cleveland Browns-orange. Team pride. He also owns Akon’s former Lamborghini Murciélago. He picked that one up on eBay.\n\nOther first-class “whips,” as he calls them, that he owns are the Range Rover, Mercedes-Benz S-Class, Bentley Continental, BMW X6 and a Rolls Royce. Rim Source Motorsports is his custom shop of choice in Baltimore. His Range Rover was refitted with 24” Maglia wheels and wrapped in white. He made over his Mercedes in matte white as a birthday gift for himself a few years back. He used Eternal Trendz custom for that job.\n\nJeff Gordon\n\nOldsmobile Super 88 Convertible $128K Old school race car driver Jeff Gordon dominated stock-car racing in his day. Driving the Chevy SS, he took 92 Sprint Cups. Now he’s a Fox announcer and a top exec at Hendrick Motorsports. Gordon loves to accumulate classic cars. His crown jewel is this 1952 Oldsmobile Super 88 Convertible.\n\nHe shows off the popular Oldsmobile SS at Car Shows all around the nation. With a $200 million net worth, one can assume he’s an avid collector of modern performance machines too.\n\nRyan Newman\n\nBuick Roadmaster Convertible Coupe $8K NASCAR racer Ryan “Rocket Man” Newman has been racing stock cars since 2000. The Daytona 500 winner drives the No. 6 Ford Mustang in the Monster Energy Cup Series against the likes of Kyle Busch and many other racers. And, like other race car drivers, he enjoys collecting. This 1949 Buick Roadmaster Convertible Coupe holds a special place in his heart.\n\nIt was gifted to him by his wife for his 30th. She picked it out because of its starring-role status in the movie Rain Man, Newman’s favorite flick. It was one of three Roadsters used. She paid just $7,800 for it. It’s a priceless gift. The NASCAR celebrity adores the Roadmaster. He drives it once every few months.\n\nJimmie Johnson\n\nStepside Chevy $39K This 1949 Chevy Stepside truck is exactly the vehicle any classic car collector would long to have. Jimmy Johnson is certainly pleased to own it. He told Men’s Journal, “It sounds good and hauls ass—it’s got a Corvette engine under the hood.”\n\nThe beautiful truck might be almost 70 years old now, but it still runs like a vehicle that was manufactured this year. Jimmie himself has stated that although it might look a bit old, it’s extremely comfortable to drive around in. It’s also got a really powerful engine that gives the vehicle a great sound along with all the engine-power you could ever ask for. No matter how much you weigh it down, it’ll run without the slightest complaints. Jimmie isn’t about to hit retirement any time soon, so we’ll just have to wait and see if he gets a new favorite vehicle. He seems like he won’t be leaving this truck in a hurry.\n\nJanet Jackson\n\nLamborghini Murciélago $380K Janet Jackson is known for her legendary music career, nearly overshadowing little brother Michael Jackson’s fame, and for the “wardrobe malfunction.” Isn’t it funny how important seemingly minor events become? This gorgeous golden yellow Lamborghini Murciélago is one of the superstar’s favorite supercars to drive. It’s no surprise the pop diva chose to purchase the $380,000 sleek machine. Lamborghini is a legendary company.\n\nIt was founded by Ferrucio Lamborghini. The history of the supercar starts in 1963 when Ferrucio Lamborghini challenged Ferrari and unveiled the 350 GTV. In 1966, Lamborghini took the competition by the horns with the Miura sports coupe, leading to the Aventador and the Murciélago. The hypercar was born. Jackson’s model was introduced in 2001.\n\nUsain Bolt\n\nFerrari 458 $291K The world’s greatest sprinter Usain Bolt lives up to his name. “Lightning Bolt” is a nine-time Olympic gold medalist who was born in Jamaica in 1986. In 2018 he retired from sports after his footballer career fizzled. Bolt’s many sponsorships include Puma, Gatorade, Virgin Media, and Apple. His social media income from sponsorships makes him the third-highest earner in the athletics area. He also co-founded an electric scooter company.\n\nHis entrepreneurial spirit and his sponsorships allow him a net worth of $90 million, hence the Ferrari 458. Bolt loves his Ferrari. It’s the only thing faster than he is. He reveled in the rare opportunity to test-drive the 48 Italia at Ferrari’s test track Maranello, Italy. Of course, he had to have it. After the test-drive, he said, “It’s a little bit like me; very reactive and determined!”\n\nCeelo Green\n\nAuburn Speedster $130K Here’s a guy with some class. Rapper CeeLo Green purchased this fabulous vintage Auburn Speedster for a cool $130,000. The Speedster exhibited affluence and class in the 1930s, which is readily apparent today. The Auburn Speedster is a rare vintage car. The manufacturer of the Auburn Speedster went out of business just a couple of years after the lovely car was built. No false advertising here, it was speedy! In 1935, this car could hit 100 mph. It was an amazing speed for the time.\n\nCeeLo is a Southern rapper born in Atlanta. He hooked up with Danger Mouse to get his start and has moved on to make television appearances. He’s probably due for another album release by now. Meanwhile, his showbiz career keeps him busy.\n\nRowan Atkinson\n\nMcLaren F1 £640K Rowan Atkinson made money on his McLaren. He spent £640K on an exceptionally rare, beautiful new 1997 McLaren F1. With a top speed of 240 mph, it was the world’s fastest car for ten years until the Koenigsegg CCR passed it up in 2005. The British comedian a.k.a. Mr. Bean was a very proud owner of one of the only 106 performance machines manufactured by McLaren. But he bade farewell to it in 2015.\n\nEven though Atkinson crashed his deep-hued burgundy baby, not once, but twice, costing about $1.35 million in insurance payments to repair it, he was able to sell it for a significant profit. The insurance claim resulted in the largest insurance payout in the U.K. (Imagining the cost of his next insurance policy is absolutely mind-boggling.) Atkinson calls his F1 the greatest supercar ever made. It zooms 0-60 in 3.4 seconds and contains a V12 627 HP engine. He’ll likely miss the car that holds 41,000 miles of road-trip memories. It sold at auction for £8 million, or $12 million. He won’t miss that insurance premium!\n\nWarren Buffet\n\nCadillac XTS $45K Financial markets wizard Warren Buffet has made a cushy career out of boosting profits as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. As an investment prodigy, Buffet started picking stocks at the tender age of 11. Adjusted for inflation, he made an equivalent of $53,000 by the time he turned 16. At 89, his accrued wealth designates him as one of America’s richest people. Not just that, but with an $87 billion net worth, he’s the third-richest person in the world.\n\nThe billionaire is known for his philanthropy and frugal lifestyle. He eats breakfast at McDonald’s and opts to use a flip-phone (the original one, not the new version). When it comes to cars, he splurged on this 2015 Cadillac XTS, paying $45,295 for it. To purchase the Caddy, Buffet traded in his eight-year-old Cadillac DTS which had only 19,000 miles on it. It seems the dealership scored a great deal too. He doesn’t drive more than 3,000 miles per year, so a car is a low priority. Besides, his private jet is probably faster.\n\nKevin Costner\n\nAudi S8 $119K Today, Kevin Costner is one of Hollywood’s top A-listers. Who can forget his monumental, 7-Oscar-winning American epic Dances with Wolves? And he was just getting started. Now he’s massively successful relishing in all the perks of affluence. But did you know he once had little more than a car? He revealed to Ellen in 2015 that, as a post-college kid trying to make it in Hollywood, he temporarily lived out of his car. This is what it took to land a film career.\n\nHis story ends happily ever after, of course, and now Costner drives this luxury 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 Audi S8 and parks it in the garage at his spacious home. As a celeb, Costner has acquired quite a few cars. His collection includes another Audi, the Q7 model he bought for his son, as well as a sleek Mercedes SLS AMG, a decked-out classic 1969 convertible Mustang and a Toyota Tundra.\n\nTracy Morgan\n\nFerrari Spyder $272K Stand-up comedian and SNL cast member Tracy Morgan is all smiles. Spotted in his brand-new cherry-red Ferrari with the top down and the tunes flowing, what’s not to love? Ferrari’s 2017 488 Spider hits the jackpot with a 777-horsepower engine. The two-seater supercar was his for $272K. The day Morgan upgraded to a $2 million Bugatti, however, his celebratory grin was swiped right off his face. Proudly navigating his new pearl 16.4 Grand Sport Bugatti Veyron hypercar, one of the fastest 2-door, topless machines on the market off of the Manhattan Motorcars lot, he hadn’t driven a mile before some lady in a Honda CR-V sideswiped him. She was on the phone. Furious, he had a few words with her. She described the encounter as “traumatizing.”\n\nIn two seconds, the fender bender wiped $200K off the value of the coveted Bugatti, the car with the distinctively classy front grill that boasts a top speed of 260 mph. But that wasn’t the most traumatizing car crash Morgan suffered. Five years prior to this epic example of bad luck, Morgan was nearly killed as a passenger while commuting with the SNL crew, losing his friend, comedian Jimmy Mack, in the process. Morgan broke every bone in his face and lost the ability to speak and walk. Miraculously, a full-recovery finds him back on TV. He’s starring in his own TBS series, The Last O.G. That is definitely something to celebrate.\n\nDanica Patrick\n\nLamborghini Gallardo $200K NASCAR racer Danica Patrick has been racing since she was 10. She’s the only woman to win in the IndyCar Series and, it’s safe to say, she’s the only NASCAR racer who has modeled bikinis for the Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition. After racing high-performance machines built for speed her entire life, it’s not easy to find a vehicle that measures up. Patrick started with a BMW 645 convertible, but by 2007, she was looking for something that could go a little faster. She picked up a Lambo Gallardo for $202K and drove it everywhere. With top speeds of 220 mph and going 0-60 less than three seconds, she wasted no time running errands.\n\nFor a few years, the two were inseparable. But then she found it impractical. Her shiny silver supercar had 520 horsepower, but it didn’t have a cup holder. Not only that, it was ridiculously absurd when she went to the airport to pick up her sister. The Gallardo has a trunk the size of a briefcase. Her sister’s luggage? Much larger. She traded the stallion in, and now she sports a Ford Expedition. “Cars are like purses for me, I just need one nice one, and when it wears out, I’ll get a new one,” Danica explained to Joe Rogan at his Experience show.\n\nChristian Pulisic\n\nMcLaren 600LT, $496K\n\nChristian Pulisic was born in Hershey, Pennsylvania, a town famous for Hershey Park, and Hershey Chocolate. Well, now it's also known as the hometown of the world-famous Premier Leaguer Christian Pulisic.\n\nDo you think he drives this McLaren around when he's out buying chocolate for his family? The McLaren 600LT is no ordinary sports car. It has a top speed of 203 miles per hour and can go from 0 to 60 in just under 3 seconds. Other specifications, such as a 3.8-liter Twin Turbo V8 engine and 7-speed+ Reverse Seamless Shift Gearbox Transmission, make this bad boy a force to be reckoned with.\n\nRafael Márquez\n\nMini Cooper Cabrio, $56.7K\n\nPictured here, on January 9th, 2020, at the Autosalon 2020 Motor Show in Brussels, Belgium, the Cabrio is showcased as the simple, fun, easy-to-love vehicle with all the charm, speed, and class that you would expect in a British Mini.\n\nThe Cooper Cabrio is the ride of choice with former Mexican professional Soccer player Rafael Márquez, who debuted his humble career with club Atlas on October 1996 at only 17 years old. By 2003 he would eventually find himself starring in the Spanish club Barcelona in 2003, where he remained until retiring from playing in 2012.\n\nLionel Messi\n\nFerrari 335 S Spider Scaglietti, $28.4 Million\n\nAccording to many alleging media sources, Lionel Messi took a liking to this classic Italian supercar during a 2016 auction with which he competed to outbid the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nThe at-the-time 28-year-old footballer made the highest bid in the auction. Messi later teased the idea with a picture on his Instagram showing him brandishing a small toy model of the Spider with the caption \"My New Car.\" The 1957 race model is known for reaching top speeds of between 180 and 186 miles per hour. So, just like Messi, it's fast!\n\nKylian Mbappe\n\nFerrari 488 Pista, $330K\n\nMbappe has a few Ferraris and considering he is one of the top 20 highest-paid soccer players in the world, that only makes sense. The 448 Pista shown in this photo can be fetched for as little as 330 thousand dollars.\n\nWay more than an arm and a leg for most, but for Kylian, barely even a fingernail. The 448 Pista is an incredible supercar that boasts a 3.9-liter turbo V8 engine that can chalk up to 711 horsepower and reach 60mph in 2.8 seconds. One can only wonder what car he will be showing off in the years and tournaments to come.\n\nBastian Schweinsteiger\n\n2007 Range Rover Sport, $57-80K\n\n\"Schweinsteiger!!!!\" is how we all remember his name being yelled as one of the biggest soccer players ever to walk the pitch. He's famous for trying to score goals from spots that sometimes stretched to almost midfield.\n\nSchweinsteiger made his international stage debut in June of 2004 during a friendly match between Germany and Hungary. He had since scored 121 goals until his 2016 retirement. He is a relatively simple man compared to his counterparts on this list. Schweinsteiger keeps it simple with his 07 Range Rover Sport.\n\nSteven Gerrard\n\nBentley Continental GTC V8, around $200K\n\nDon't be fooled by its simple looks. This is, after all, a Bentley. A full-fledged British-engineered masterpiece. When it comes to quality innovation, engineering, and horsepower, these vehicles pack a punch.\n\nJust like the Bentley Continental, Garrard too has simple looks that should not be easily dismissed. The former Liverpool midfielder had some of the most powerful kicks ever seen in British soccer and was feared by all. Never mess with an athlete who drives a Bentley. You may end up a few goals down if you do!\n\nGerard Pique\n\nPorsche Cayenne E-Hybrid, $88.6K\n\nOn June 6th, 2022, Shakira and Soccer legend Gerard Pique announced that they were splitting up. It makes you wonder where they drove next. We imagine Pique to have taken a stroll in his Porsche hybrid with no worries in sight.\n\nJust a nice drive out on the town in one of these should be enough to help anyone get over a breakup—even a breakup of the caliber of Shakira. Of course, you'd have to get some extremely bad news to ruin your day while you're driving one of these.\n\nSergio Ramos\n\nCustom Fiat 600, $38.9K\n\nSergio Ramos has about 11 known cars in his personal collection. Amongst them is a birthday gift of his, a classic Fiat 600 with an \"SR4\" decal on its side. Despite the fact that Ramos has sports cars such as Ashton Martin, Mercedes-AMG, Porsche 977 Turbo S, and an Audi RS 6 Quattro, he seems to be preferring his small Fiat on his day-to-day summer outings.\n\nNever mind the small price tag of his favorite car, the total price tag of his collection is more than 2 million dollars.\n\nLandon Donovan\n\nMercedes Benz AMG GTS, $143-193K\n\nAmerican soccer legend Landon Donovan is often seen sporting his Benz. Finished in diamond white paint and with a chrome Mercedes Grille and badge, this is a beast of a vehicle.\n\nThe Mercedes AMG GT was first introduced on September 9th, 2014, and was produced in coupe and roadster body styles by the German automobile manufacturer. Landon Donovan may not be German, but he certainly needed a car that could fit his speed, style, and agility. That's precisely what he found in the GT, which can reach 0-60 in just 3 seconds with a max speed of almost 200 mph!\n\nFranz Beckenbauer\n\nMercedes Benz C-Class Convertible Cabrio, $86K\n\nNot that bad of a price tag considering Franz used to make millions of dollars a year. The former German soccer star made his debut on June 6th, 1964, for the ultra-successful soccer club Bayern Munich.\n\nAfter being the manager of the West German National Team and Marseille, he ultimately circled back to Bayern in 1994 as the President of the Club. The German soccer star has been everywhere in the sport, won numerous championships, and is the only defender to win the Ballon d'Or twice in a row. No wonder he's shredding the road in one of these!\n\nMichael Owen\n\nRange Rover Evoque, 28-39K\n\n\"I don't want to pack everything into one year and then do nothing the rest of my life. I think it's important to do things bit by bit.\" You also don't want to pack everything into a small car when you could be packing everything into a big old Range Rover for your weekend getaway.\n\nBorn in Chester, England, in 1979, Owen today boasts a net worth of at least $68 million dollars as of 2022. A pretty humble choice of vehicle, considering he could have bought at least 1,700 brand-new rovers with that net worth.\n\nThierry Henry\n\nMercedes-Benz SLR McLaren 722, $3.1 Million\n\nToday, this car is worth $47 million. Yup, and he can handle it. The former Barcelona Striker and most feared player in the MLS, striking for the New York City Red Bulls, accumulated more than 220 goals by his 2014 retirement.\n\nIf anyone deserves one of the fastest, most expensive supercars in history, it's him. But why is the SLR McLaren so expensive? One of the main reasons is that only three of them were ever manufactured. So, at the time, Henry bought what is known as a gem of a vehicle. It's more than a car, it's an investment.\n\nNeymar Jr.\n\nMaserati MC12Salon Prive Concours, $1.1 Million\n\nThe least you could expect a soccer star the like of Neymar to show up in when driving up to a party is the Maserati MC12Salon Prive Concours. One of the most powerful supercars by far, one of the most potent strikers in the history of the sport.\n\nThe Maserati MC12 is the fastest road car ever made by Maserati and has a top speed of about 205 mph. Neymar, for comparison, was recorded with a top running speed of 21 mph, not far from Usain Bolt's speed of 23.\n\nChicharito\n\nC6 Corvette, $90K\n\nJavier Hernández Balcázar, commonly known by the nickname Chicharito, is a Mexican native soccer star who currently plays under the Yellow, Blue, and White of Club LA Galaxy.\n\nAt his peak in the soccer world, he had bought himself a custom-made ninety-thousand-dollar model of the C6 Corvette. The soccer star recently confirmed that he would be doing another season with LA. You can bet your dollar that he will show up to a few practices in one of these.\n\nMesut Ozil\n\nFerrari 458 Italia 50 JS, $295K\n\nMesut Ozil is one of the most accomplished soccer players in German soccer history. His choice of roadster amongst the many he owns is this magnificent-looking Ferrari 458 Italia 50 JS. It definitely matches his playing abilities.\n\nThe 458 is sleek, fast, and agile, and exhibits the unimaginable speeds that Ferrari well knows how to exhibit in their road cars. The Ferrari 4458 reaches from 0 to 60 in a measly 3 seconds. That's the speed at which you sip your tea! Ozil himself has a top speed of 21.7 mph.\n\nJoachim Low\n\nElectric Luxury Mercedes-Benz S600, $102K\n\nThe electric car is slowly taking over the world. As of 2022, there are over 1 million registered electric cars in the United States alone. So why not get yourself an electric supercar?\n\nThe S600 can do the 0 to 62 mph (0 to 100 km/h) sprint in 4.6 seconds, and its top speed is limited to 155 mph (250 km/h). Joachim Low, thanks for saving the planet with a luxury car! It sets an excellent example for the rest of the world that it does not matter how much money you make, it would help if you still looked out for the planet.\n\nClint Dempsey\n\nFord Ranger Raptor, $86K\n\nSome stars out there are driving old classics, sports, luxury, or supercars. Clint Dempsey, however, preferred to build his empire with a good old American four-by-four. He chose the Ford Ranger Raptor for the job.\n\nWhy? Well, let's assume he didn't get one as part of a promotion the year it came out. Maybe it's because the vehicle can handle many hard terrains without taking too much damage. Its top speed, however, is only 107 mph. He's not getting far with that! Not too long ago, he teamed up with Lexus. Maybe he got a good deal there too.\n\nPele\n\nMercedes W114 250 Automatic, $12K\n\nThis one is amongst many vehicles that were gifted to Pele during his long career. Others include a VW Beetle, Porsche Aero Willys 2600, and Mercedes 280 SE W108. Today, Pele is in his 80s and has actually given most of his collection to auction.\n\nIn recent years Pele is opting to use limousine services to get from one place to another. The soccer star was such a legend in his heyday that he was actually gifted his first car at the young age of 18. A short while earlier, he was just a young poor Brazilian who could only dream of such a life.\n\nGary Neville\n\nBentley Bentayga, Luxury SUV, $263K\n\nWhen you see someone drive up the road in a Bentley, you know they did something right, and Gary Neville has done a lot right in his career. Since first joining Manchester United in 1994, Neville has scored 400 goals in the career span of 20 years.\n\nHe was what you call a 'one club man,' spending his whole career playing for just Manchester United. If you think he is a one-car man, too, you could be right — we wouldn't be shocked if he just spent his days cruising around in his Bentley.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo\n\nMercedes AMG GLE 63S Coupé, $117K\n\nA pretty humble drive, considering Cristiano Ronaldo is by far the biggest household name in the history of sports. You would imagine that he at least would be using that clout to get himself a multimillion-dollar supercar.\n\nWell, he actually owns 11 more cars, amongst them two Bugattis, many Ferraris, a Bentley, and a Rolls Royce. It's not surprising, considering he's also one of the richest soccer players to ever kick the ball. However, sometimes he just wants to live a simple life and jum"
