        "text": "The wind is whipping and will continue to blow all evening long, instead of staying at home why don't you let the wind push you to the movie theatre for a special viewing of All Sorts, written and directed by Rick Casteneda and filmed in Yakima, WA!\n\nRick is originally from Granger, WA and this is his second feature film! All Sorts looks into the magical world of office work...what if there was something happening underneath the surface!? You know there always is!\n\nPerhaps an underground file folding competition? This quirky film tips its hat at all the wild characters that make up an office atmosphere, including a boss who is so colorful, and to the letter, that he's willing to fire and re-hire himself to make things work! Ever had a co-worker who was receiving mysterious phone calls from someone accusing them of things they didn't do, every day? Got that too and that's only the smidge of the fun!\n\nWhere Can You See This Film?\n\nWednesday: Richland, WA Fairchild Cinemas - Queensgate @ 7:30 pm - One Night Only!\n\nThursday: Moses Lake, WA Fairchild Cinemas - Moses Lake @ 7:30 pm - One Night Only!\n\nFriday: Spokane, WA Magic Lantern on Main @ 7 pm - Red Carpet Premiere!\n\nSunday: Chippewa Falls, WI Micon Cinemas @ 4 pm - One Night Only!\n\nYou can purchase your tickets here and make sure to follow All Sorts on social media for more dates to watch this fantastic film created by a local Washingtonian!\n\nAll Sorts\n\nLOOK: The most famous actress born the same year as you\n\nMany of the actresses in this story not only made a name for themselves through their collection of iconic performances, but also through the selfless, philanthropic nature with which many of them approached their stardom. In an age of flipping the script on societal norms, many of these actresses are using their voices and platforms to be advocates for those who are otherwise unheard.\n\nLOOK: The Most Famous Actor Born Every Year\n\nLOOK: 50 Black actors who made entertainment history"
