        "text": "After a sudden attack on MI5, Johnny English (Rowan Atkinson) becomes England’s top spy.\n\nI didn’t even know this film existed until recently so I set about watching it. For some reason, I’d seen the second film first.\n\nWhile Rowan Atkinson is always good in whatever role he plays, here I think the script is at fault. Not that it is bad – it’s a parody after all – it’s just that the script felt weak in places or even somewhat unsure as if they were unsure how the jokes would land. At times it felt like it was being played as a straight spy film rather than a parody. Perhaps they were banking on people being familiar with the persona of Atkinson through playing Mr Bean. I don’t know.\n\nThere were a few jokes that made me chuckle however it felt too self conscious to be enjoyable, although it poked fun at Britishness and what it means to be British. Always nice to see that. It’s silly, irreverent fun for fans of Atkinson that goes some way to show what could be achieved with the sequel."
