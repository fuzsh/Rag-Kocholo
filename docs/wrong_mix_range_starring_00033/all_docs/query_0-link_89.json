The first one is Troyal Garth Brooks, American country music artist, and the second one is Tracy Chapman, American pop singer and songwriter. United Kingdom Country Music determined that Garth Brooks has taken country music further than any other performer. He has reached the widest possible audience, gained phenomenal success, yet still retained the basic ingredients of country music. His eponymous first album was released in 1989. Tracy Chapman is a multi-platinum and four-time Grammy Award-winning artist. During college, Chapman began street-performing and playing guitar in coffeehouses in Cambridge.

BIOGRAPHY Rowan Sebastian Atkinson, whose nickname is Row, was born on the 6th January 1955. He is a British actor, comedian and screenwriter. His trademark(kaubamärk) character is Mr Bean which most people probably know him by. Rowan grew up with his two older brothers in Newcastle, UK, where his father owned a farm. He attended Newcastle University and Oxford University where he earned degrees in electrical engineering. During that time, he met screenwriter Richard Curtis, with whom he wrote and performed comedy revues. CAREER Rowan Atkinson has written sketch comedies like Blackadder and Not the Nine o'Clock News.

Since then, he has gained further recognition...\n\nHip-hop\n\nHip hop music, also referred to as rap music, is a music genre typically consisting of a rhythmic vocal style called rap which is accompanied with backing beats. Hip hop music is part of hip hop culture, which began in the Bronx, in New York City in the 1970s, predominantly among African Americans and Latino Americans.[1][2] The term rap is often used synonymously with hip hop music. Rapping, also referred to as MCing or emceeing, is a vocal style in which the performer speaks rhythmically and in rhyme, generally to a beat, recently, however, a difference has developed between \"rapping\" and \"MCing\". \"MCing\" has been used to describe those artists who possess and exercise superior lyrical ability and prowess. Beats are traditionally generated from portions of other songs by a DJ, or sampled from portions of other songs by a producer, though synthesizers, drum machines, and live bands are also used, especially in newer music.

Writes articles for CAR (a British car magazine), owns various fast cars (Aston Martin Vantages, etc.) Atkinson was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services to drama and charity. Personal Quotes: People think because I can make them laugh on the stage, I'll be able to make them laugh in person. That isn't the case at all. I am essentially a rather quiet, dull person who just happens to be a performer. Mr. Bean is essentially a child trapped in the body of a man. All cultures identify with children in a similar way, so he has this bizarre global outreach. And 10-year-old boys from different cultures have more in common than 30-year-olds. As we grow up, we acquire this sensibility that divides us. Mr. Bean Mr. Bean is a British situation comedy television programme series of fourteen 25-minute episodes written by and starring Rowan Atkinson as the title character.

He acted in, directed, scripted, produced, and eventually scored his own films. Chaplin was also one of the most creative and influential personalities in the silent-film era. His working life in entertainment spanned over 65 years, from the Victorian stage and music hall in the United Kingdom as a child performer, almost until his death at the age of eighty-eight. Chaplin's high- profile public and private life encompassed highs and lows with both adulation and controversy. His principal character was \"The Tramp\" (known as \"Charlot\" in France and the French- speaking world, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Turkey, and as \"Carlitos\" in Brazil). \"The Tramp\" is a vagrant with the refined manners and dignity of a gentleman.

She is one of the highest paid actresses in Hollywood and is the highest paid actor of Latin descent, making up to US$15 million per film role. Lopez has sold over 11.8 million albums in the United States and over 70 million records worldwide.[1][2] She became interested in pursuing a career in the entertainment industry following her small role in the 1986 film My Little Girl, to the dismay of her Puerto Rican parents, who believed that it was an unrealistic career route\n\nReferaat Elton John'ist\n\nmusicians of the day. John remembers being immediately hooked on rock and roll when his mother brought home records by Elvis Presley and Bill Haley & His Comets in 1956. The young Reginald Dwight was not merely interested in music -- he was extremely talented. He started playing the piano at the age of three, and within a year, his mother heard him picking out Winifred Atwell's \"The Skater's Waltz\" by ear. It wasn't long before the boy was being pressed into service as a performer at parties and family gatherings. He began taking piano lessons at the age of seven. He showed great musical attitude at school, including the ability to compose melodies, and gained some notoriety by playing like Jerry Lee Lewis at school functions. At the age of 11, he won a junior scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music. One of his instructors reports that, when he entered the Academy, she played a four-page piece by Handel, which he promptly played back like a \"gramophone record.\"\n\nElla Fitzgerald´i eluloo kokkuvõte\n\nInstead, she sang \"Judy,\" silenced the awestruck crowd, and won first prize. It was the beginning of one of the most celebrated careers in music history. Born in Newport News, Virginia in 1917, Ella Fitzgerald moved with her mother to New York after the death of her father. Living in Yonkers, Fitzgerald attended public school, where she sang in the glee club and received her musical education. After her early success at the Apollo, and as a popular performer at a number of other amateur venues, Fitzgerald was invited to join Chick Webb's band. Within a short while she was the star attraction, and had made a number hits including her trademark \"Atisket, Atasket\" (1938). After Webb's death in 1939, Fitzgerald led the band for three years. During her time with Webb's band, Fitzgerald recorded with a number of other musicians, including Benny Goodman. By the time she began her solo career in the mid1940s, she was a\n\nGymnastics\n\nRope climbing Generally, competitors climbed either a 6m (6.1m = 20 ft in USA) or an 8m (7.6m = 25 ft in USA), 38mm (1.5\") diameter natural fiber rope for speed, starting from a seated position on the floor and using only the hands and arms. Kicking the legs in a kind of \"stride\" was normally permitted. Many gymnasts can do this in the straddle or pike position, which eliminates the help generated from the legs. Flying rings Flying rings was an event similar to still rings, but with the performer executing a series of stunts while swinging. It was a gymnastic event sanctioned by both the NCAA and the AAU until the early 1960s.

THE FIRST CENTURY 1896-1996.\n\nSymphony, a B flat minor tonic with a diminished fifth, expresses discontent and grieving at hopelessness. In the symphonic music of Heimar Ilves there is no rhetoric, no brilliant wit, no humour. The composer is pondering over the principal challenges of life and considers them in a gripping way. His music has been much more widely performed abroad that in Estonia. His symphonies have been received well in Berlin, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Minsk, Baku, etc. The main performer of his works has been Prof. Roman Matsov, a well-known Estonian conductor. The composer did not deny modern techniques of composition but nevertheless found that, for example, dodecaphony in its essence was quite limited, depriving music of the calm and beauty of modulations. He appreciated polytonality as a means of expression and the finding of lovely hidden possibilities. The primary and principal value of music lies in the weight of thematic material, principal images, he believed\n\nCHANGE YOUR THINKING CHANGE YOUR LIFE\n\nuniversity, is that they conclude that everything they know at the moment is all that there is to know about a particular subject. ccc_tracy_8_136-153.qxd 6/23/03 2:48 PM Page 140 140 ➤ CHANGE YOUR THINKING, CHANGE YOUR LIFE Sometimes they think that what they know is all they need to know about a subject as well. This is called the “intelligence trap” of the poor performer, the unconscious incompetent. This is a person who does not know, and does not know that he does not know. This person cannot be helped, because he is closed to new information. This is why the be- ginning of all wisdom is often the awareness of how ignorant you re- ally are, of how little you really know. ■ DON’T BE IMPRESSED I have traveled in many countries and met countless highly intelli- gent and successful people\n\nJane Austen\n\nWe neither of us perform to strangers.\" Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again. Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy: \"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's. Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.\" Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry her, had she been his relation.
