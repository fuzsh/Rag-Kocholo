All the movies I checked out in 2020, just so you know what I’ve been up to. Some were already reviewed below. Some will be in forthcoming zines. And all are game for YOU to go checkout ya self. Happy 2021 watching!\n\nPosted on 1/1/2021\n\nHoliday Watchlist 2020\n\nHere’s my holiday watchlist for 2020. Didn’t check out too many holiday movies, so I chose these selections wisely. Hope you enjoyed your quarantine holiday! Here’s to next year.\n\nLethal Weapon (Warner Bros)\n\nLethal Weapon, a classic 80s/90s buddy cop movie where the good guys always win, starring Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. This is as much a holiday movie as Die Hard (and I’m not bothering to get into that debate). Movies that take place during any holiday, whether labeled a holiday movie or not, still allow the audience to feel part of that holiday spirit. You could watch this movie during the summer, and still feel Christmas vibes when you see Mel Gibson’s shootout in that tree lot. Anyway, that’s the reason I watched this (and that my wife consented) while we did some sort of Christmas stuff, like wrap a present or something. I always dug Lethal Weapon so much so that late the same week I had to watch the 90s paradoy National Lampoons Loaded Weapon 1 (which is as dumb as the Naked Gun and Scary Movie franchises combined). Lethal Weapon was worth a watch. Not sure about the sequels tho…\n\nTrapped in Paradise (Twentieth Century Fox)\n\nThis is one of my favorite holiday watches. Its also one of the only movies starring Dana Carvey (my fav Saturday Night Live alum). The story is of 2 released cons (Carvey and SNL alum John Lovitz) who con their brother (Nicolas Cage) into breaking into a small town bank over the holidays. Of course theres a lot of hijinks and some good holiday spirit too. They end up getting chased by local cops, the FBI, and another pair of escaped cons that also want to rob the bank. There’s a lame side love story building, which I could do without. Carvey as a con man is great, pulling out voices, faces and mannerisms only he can do (he’s a better con man in Opportunity Knocks, which you gotta watch). There’s a reindeer pulling a sled which my vegan ass ain’t for. Other than that, its innocuous, cheap humor that makes you forget about the cares of the holidays for a minute (be it family, presents, or this year COIVD quarantine) and enjoy them before they’re gone.\n\nAll is Bright (Green Street Films)\n\nStarring Paul Rudd and Paul Giamatti (2 Pauls, coulda been called Paul is Bright) as two French Canadian Christmas Tree salesmen that are in love with the same woman, one who has Giamatti’s child. Overlooking their terrible french accents, the two don’t come off as very likable. It makes you wonder why both watching it. There’s a Russian maid that acts as Giamatti’s angel, that goodwill spirit you need in a Christmas movie. Its a basic movie, and then a small violent twist humanizes the pair for once. From there it climaxes to a bearable ending. Should have been better but I stayed with it. You could watch this if you’re looking for a new, non-traditional holiday movie.\n\nBlack Christmas (Universal Pictures)\n\nThis was a pretty poor film. It’s a slasher movie, but more like the newer genre i.e. Scream. It’s a remake, but the idea is sound: a killer hunts sorority houses during the winter holiday break. There’s a lot of commentary about gender with scenes dealing with the way woman are treated in higher education, mansplanning, and a female’s place in society, to name a few. This movie makes great points about gender equality and empowerment which are ruined with a laughable ending. Without giving it away (because I usually don’t spoil movies in my reviews), the killer’s big reveal was extra lame and made me regret sitting through this. It’s a Holiday Jeers from yours truly.\n\nA Christmas Story (Metro-Goldwyn Mayer)\n\nThis is a classic. If you don’t know, you don’t know.\n\nPosted on 11/9/2020\n\nHALLOWEEN 2020 WATCHLIST\n\nThis past October, I didn’t commit to an all Halloween watchlist. Below is a list of the spooky-ish titles I watched. Definitely some classics, new titles, a few series. Watched a lot of Netflix, it is what it is.There was a good amount of John Carpenter here, not something I planned. The watchlist took a break due to the holiday planning, presidential debates, and the new season of Saturday Night Live. I mention holiday planning as for quarantine Halloween, my wife went all out. She prepped (i.e. ordering, creating/crafting, freeboxing, and installing) our backyard for my son and our nanny pod so the kids could get together and enjoy something in lieu of door-to-door trick or treating. Nothing says Halloween more than a 3 year old’s small arms trying to break a pinata (and me next to it trying not to get hit in the crotch and make it onto America’s Funniest Videos). Here’s a few Watchlist reviews. Stay safe.\n\nBeetlejuice\n\nUnder the skin\n\nHalloween (1978)\n\nJohn Carpenter’s Vampires\n\nThe Haunting of Bly House (Netflix series)\n\nUnsolved Mysteries (Netflix Season 2, 2020)\n\nThe Swerve\n\nHubie Halloween (Netflix)\n\nThe Thing\n\nThe Witches (2020)\n\nPoltergeist (2015)\n\nHis House\n\nMonster Squad\n\nHellraiser 4 Bloodline\n\nNobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight\n\nUnder the Skin (Steel Reel Creative, 2013)\n\nI’ve seen mixed reviews of this movie for a long time. I knew it starred Scarlett Johansson as a creepy, quiet killer that got naked a bunch. Someone on this facebook Strange Movies group I am part of commented that this was just a long tour of Scotland. That is basically true to an extent. Johansson’s character drives around towns in Scotland in a serial killer type van looking for victims. The driving really drags things on longer than needed. The are a few dark scenes, such as how sex and murder intermingle toward a watery, other dimensional grave. The end has some beautiful imagery associated with Johansson’s character (the makeup/effects looked pretty cool). I wouldn’t recommend this unless you watch a trailer and decide if its worth your time.\n\nThe Haunting of Bly House (Netflix series, 2020)\n\nThis is somehow a follow up to the 2019 Netflix series Haunting of Hill House, which was decent. We gave this a watch based on that. Its cast of lot of the same actors/actresses for a new story in a new house. The setting is an old English manor which is a great scene for a ghost story. My review isn’t so much about the story, but my complaints with the episodic format. This is a series with 9 one-hour-long episodes rather than a standalone 2 hour movie. This format drew out the story leaving me disinterested midway through. Some episodes could have been cut to a simple scene. Episode 8 is the entire backstory of the house’s past residents. I The introduction of yet more characters made my eyes roll. They were part of a contained story that I had little interest in, which could have been better placed as a 10 minute episode intro somewhere. The totality of the series wasn’t very engaging. There were some interesting parts, a few creepy/scary scenes, but nothing major to make this a standout. The longer we get to see the characters, we get to understand and know them. Most just weren’t that interesting enough to merit 10 hours of my screen time. There’ll probably be another extension of this Haunting of “Random” House series next year, so we’ll see how that all goes (actually Haunting of Random House, as in the book publisher, would be a cool Halloween anthology).\n\nHubie Halloween (Netflix, 2020)\n\nThis is an Adam Sandler vehicle made for Netflix. Dude must have signed a 20 picture contract with them, because he’s in dozens of made-for-Netflix movies, which I have given zero watchlist time to until now. Why this? Because it was Halloween. And there’s a lot of Saturday Night Live cast and alums in this (Tim Meadows, Kennan Thompson, Maya Rudolph, Rob Scheinder, Mikey Day) which I always like to see in action. The story was a pretty cheese-filled Halloween special. If you’re not at all put off by Sandler speaking out of the side of his mouth for a southern-lisp, THE ENTIRE MOVIE, reprising basically what he did in the Waterboy, then you’ll be fine. It had some moments, but then again so does every movie. Watch the trailer, as its Trick more than Treat.\n\nThe Thing (Universal Pictures, 1982)\n\nI’m gonna start out and say I was underwhelmed. This was my first time watching this classic from director John Carpenter. I didn’t know much about the movie other than it was about a monster in the arctic. There was an X-Files episode exactly like this (season 1, episode 8 called Ice), which I might have preferred to watch instead. That said, Curt Russel is the lead (a go to Carpenter lead as in Escape from New York AND Escape from LA). There’s a huge cast of notable supporting actors: Wilford Brimley (more than Quaker Oats commercials), Richard Masur (the dad from the Corey Haim/Feldman classic License to Drive uh yeah), Keith David (voice of the Navy commercials and boss from the Charlie Sheen/Emelio Estivez flick Men at Work), Charles Hallahan (one of the druids from Warlock II Armageddon!!!!), and Joel Polis (aka quippy coworker in the Seinfeld episode the Comeback that mixes it up w/ George, “The Jerk store called and they are running out of you”). The cast have good chemistry. The story was fine. It was too slow for me. It wasn’t suspenseful or creepy. I mention the X-files episode as this felt more like a TV show than a movie. I was eventually going to watch this sometime in my life just to check out another Carpenter flick. That is worth enough for me and that’s my recommendation to all y’all.\n\nThe Witches (Warner Brothers, 2020)\n\nI kept seeing ads for this remake coming to HBO and I was intrigued. Its a 30 year span since the 1990 original of the Roald Dahl kids book adaptation which stands alone as one of the weirder kids movies from the 90s. It had big shoes to fill and this remake fell short. Casting choices were great Anna Hathaway, Octavio Spencer, Chris Rock (narrator voiceover), and new face Jahzir Kadeen. The kids’ acting was good. Kadeen was actually the standout of the movie. The CGI was alright, nothing looked really great. The make up and live effects of the 90s version, looking dated and more of a gag, actually fit better for a kids movie (if you’ve seen it, I refer to the witches’ rubber head wigs, the green smoke coming out of the captured mouse in the jar, etc). I coulda done without Chris Rock as narrator (I’m currently watching the new season of Fargo so when he’d narrate this, I kept picturing him as a 1950s Kansas City gangster). The biggest disappointment was Anna Hathaway. Her acting wasn’t bad (her accent sure was). The CGI mouth she had was distracting (looked like a cleaner version of Heath Ledger’s Joker smile). The script didn’t really showcase her as overbearing unlike Angelic Houston in the original. She’s the head witch and supposed to be really scary. Some of the scenes she just comes off as dim and petty, not menacing and controlling. Octavia Spencer played a great grandmother (one that seemed never to age). And finally, no one can fill Rowan Atkinson’s shoes ever (sorry Tucci, yuh don’t ducci). If you’re nostalgic, give this a watch, but could easily pass and not miss much.\n\nPoltergeist (MGM, 2015)\n\nI saw this in the theater’s what feels like a decade ago, but apparently its only been 5 years. There’s a bit of updating to the classic 1982 original. Sam Rockwell plays the dad, the sarcastic way he played roles in Hitchhicker’s Guide or Choke. It didn’t add much a character that’s supposed to be scared out of his ass that his house is haunted. When you’re daughter ends up sucked into a TV, sarcasm doesn’t make me believe your terrified. He didn’t do the part justice when compared to Craig T. Nelson (from TV’s Coach) in the original. Worth a watch for that, but nothing too stand out that if you missed it. Rule of thumb is usually side with the original content.\n\nHis House (Netflix, 2020)\n\nA Sudanese refugee couple carries their ghosts with them while seeking asylum in England. Good casting, new twisted ghost story, and just enough creepy/suspenseful scenes that do not overshadow the narrative. Def worth a watch.\n\nMonster Squad\n\nCLASSIC. WATCH AS MAY TIMES AS YOU CAN (it has kept me going during quarantine. Got this DVD as a gift for my quarantine birthday, still stoked on this at 40).\n\nHellraiser 4 Bloodline (Dimension, 1996)\n\nMy Fav of the Hellraiser franchise. This one is Hellraiser in space (besides Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street, a weird amount of 90s horror franchises had an “in space” movie i.e. Jason X, Leprechaun in Space). When in space, its a bit like Event Horizon with Pinhead, but not as thrilling. I love they give a backstory of the Lament Configuration aka the puzzle box. I will always advocate a watch. Do whatcha want with that.\n\nNoboby Sleeps in the Woods Tonight (Akson studios, 2020)\n\nThis was a Polish film streamed on Netflix. Its a throwback slasher in camp horror movie (a la Friday the 13th or Sleepaway Camp). It tried to have a lot of different horror movie tropes (nudity/teen sex, nerdy kids at camp - which my wife said the main nerdy kid reminded her of Brendan Dassi from Making a Murder, creepy family seculded in the woods, clueless camp counselors, etc). I don’t know what other Polish genre horror films are like, so not sure if this was meant to be serious or spoofy. The story didn’t really cover any new ground and got a bit out there toward the end. It was also overdubbed in English (likely for Netflix) and we had on English subtitles which didn’t match the overdub. I wasn’t leaning toward watching this based on the trailer, but liked the idea of seeing a Polish horror movie. I’d give it a watch for that and if/when you’re checked out, you can always turn it off.\n\n__________________\n\nPosted on 8/24/20\n\n10 Worth A Watch Movies during Quarantine:\n\nThe Two Popes\n\nSilence of the Lambs\n\nRichard Jewel\n\nBlow the Man Down\n\nThe Abyss\n\nCabin in the Woods\n\nThe Last Emperor\n\nKung Fu Hustle\n\nSnowpiercer\n\nHereditary\n\n————————\n\nReviews posted on 8/22/2020\n\nIts been a while since posting. Watched ALOT of movies and TV. Here’s some of the one’s I put time into reviewing. As always, hit me up with your opinions, reviews, comments, movies I should watch, etc. Thanks and keep being safe out there.\n\nBad Education (HBO FIlms, 2019)\n\nThis was made by HBO so you might need access to see it (HBOGo just got discontinued, but you can purchase it to stream on Amazon). This is based on the true story of a school superintendent defrauding a NJ/NY school system out of millions of dollars. There’s a good cast led by Huge Jackman (playing the superintendent). Ray Romano is in this, and as much as I don’t like seeing him or hearing him or anything he’s in, he did a good job with his small part. I like movies based on real life, especially a story like this that’s so niche to a time and location. If you didn’t live in that area around that time, chances are you might not have even heard about it (I sure never did). I dug how deep in the criminals go, stealing money and covering it up, and how their crime is ultimately revealed and the reaction it elicits. The movie speaks to a few other underlying messages like our education system and who it serves (i.e. districts that build themselves up through property taxes, big donors, etc.). There’s a bit of commentary about personal vanity and status as Jackman’s character is all about his image. He charges his dry cleaning to the school as if it was a business expense for cryin’ out loud. In the end, any story of fraud is always surreal to me, how people concoct and then act on the idea, and of course, how they get caught. This is worth a watch.\n\nThe Hustle (MGM, 2019)\n\nIf you like your free time, say an hour and half of it, then go do something with it other than watch this movie. It’s really that bad. I love heist movies and comedies. This promised both, led by a cast of Anna Hathaway and Rebel Wilson. It appeared decent, like a modern Dirty Rotten Scoundrels with female con artists. Instead, it lacked real substance and humor. It pulled a lot of trite jokes and tired character types into the mix. Half way through it, my wife fell asleep and I was like, good for you. I considered turning it off, but I was committed and figured it might get better. Nope. My big criticism is the progression of Anna Hathaway’s character, the main con artist, who changes her criminal routine and ideology from smart and calculated to a vacuous run-of-the-mill petty thief. I feel it unlikely that a career con artist would just throw away their livelihood and risk being arrested. By the end, her character was unlikeable and made the movie unwatchable. Look at the trailer first and see what you think. Maybe it’s only me, but I doubt it.\n\nUnknown (Dark Castle Entertainment, 2011) +\n\nCold Pursuit (Summit Entertainment, 2019)\n\nThis is a double dose of Liam Neeson (if you’re a fan or not). He’s an actor with a “very particular set of skills,” which have typecast him as portraying the role of a vigilante that will hunt and kill people in order to find what he’s looking for. These movies are different thematically, but Neeson is still playing a variation of that role. Unknown was like a made-for-cable version of Bourne Identity. Cold Pursuit was like if Taken was set in the frozen midwest. I liked Cold Pursuit better. Its grittier and I like the idea more (a snow plow driver hunts down his son’s killers, using a fucking snow plow!). I feel that’s all I need to say about these movies. If you have time to waste and want to watch something mildly entertaining with just enough action, then I’d say these are worth a watch.\n\nThe Invisible Man (Universal Pictures, 2020)\n\nThis was a modern take on the classic story, what if humans could create a way to become invisible. This take involved modern technology to explain how one could become the Invisible Man (ohhh aaahhh). I’ve been seeing Kevin Bacon’s Hollow Man movie pop up recently, and the way they are doing the invisible man in this 2020 film reminds me of that (while writing this I totally watched Hallowman, review to come???!!!). This movie is really creepy and has some stressful scenes to watch. How would you react if you knew a person was in the same room as you, but you couldn’t see them or, worse, make others believe that you see them? There’s a lot of that for Elizabeth Moss as the lead. She does a great job teetering between terrified and badass survivor. Scary/tense scenes carry you through the first two thirds of the movie. Then it gets a bit formulaic in the wrap up. I began to predict midway through where the story was going and was disappointed in the watered down way my theories played out. I really, really dug how tense parts of this movie were (there’s an attic scene which reminded me of the attic sense from Hereditary. You are in a confined space, without light, only one exit behind you, and you feel someone is lurking near you. Goosebump city). Give this one a watch with the lights out!\n\nAliens (Twentieth Century Fox, 1986)\n\nCLASSIC. WATCH THIS. OVER AND OVER AGAIN.\n\nYou’ve never experienced Space Marines anielate an alien xenomorph species on a deserted planet? Ripely, Hicks, newt, Bishop, Hudson, Gordon, Vasquez.\n\nBetter than the original!\n\nFun note: Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton also star in the Terminator.\n\nAd Astra (New Regency Pictures, 2019)\n\nBrad Pitt stars in this psychologically taxing glimpse of a man’s struggle of finding his family and himself amidst space exploration and colonization. Pitt’s acting career has grown into the leading man role where his characters are finally believable. Nothing against his earlier and notable roles in say Fight Club and Oceans 11, but there’s not much of deep human connection in him. Ad Astra (Latin for “to the stars”) delivers a balanced mix of drama, action, and sci-fi. There’s a small cast, which I always dig. Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland have small roles. With a limited cast, having seasoned vet actors gave weight to the fulfilment of the story. Pitt carries an emotional workload, bouncing from planet to space ship with a stoic gameface intent on carrying out his mission, even if that means suppressing his true feelings. If you’ve seen the Martian (Matt Damen) or Castaway (Tom Hanks), you know how isolation and having nothing but one’s internal thoughts can eat away at one’s sanity. Pitt evokes that well at times. As for the story, I enjoyed the idea and follow through. The ending was a bit weak, but I wasn’t miffed even if it might have appeared too clean. Def worth a watch.\n\nCandyman (Polygram Entertainment, 1992)\n\nA horror classic shot right in my own backyard! I think I saw some of this movie when I was a teen, but never gave it a devoted watch. Now during quarantine I had the motivation (and I was aware that a remake is hopefully coming out soon. Scenes were shot mere miles, nay blocks from my front door!). Graduate students research their thesis on the local folklore of a mysterious killer, the Candyman, who resides in Chicago’s Cabrini-Green projects. Candyman comes out if you say his name 5 times into a mirror. Then, with a hook that has replaced his hand, he’ll gore you into a gruesome bloody mess (that’s done up really well on the screen). Tony Todd plays Candyman. When I watched the X-files every Friday, Fox would air commercials for other schlock shows like Mantis or Adventures of Brisco County Jr that I remember seeing Tony Todd in. It’s a shame he didn’t have a bigger career outside of cult type roles. He did a fabulous job in the 90s color remake of Night of the Living Dead. He played a small role in The Crow, of course notably the final movie of Brandon Lee. Back to review, Virginia Madsen plays the lead, embracing the Candyman myth and intertwining her life deeper into the madness of it all. There are some great horrific and terrifying scenes, many in bathrooms (adding to the creep factor for ya). I love that it is set in Chicago with real shots and scenes (not just saying its filmed here). The best horror movies aren’t only there to scare you, but provide social commentary. Candyman offers a lens on race and economics, not only in general but also in Chicago being the backdrop we see here. Candyman is a black horror character that’s not a stereotype but a strong scary-as-fuck villian. I could talk more about this film, and I might in a future zine. Go watch this one now. I recommend a watch during the day, because I was scawwed.\n\nPublic Enemies (Universal Pictures, 2009)\n\nHere’s another film, set in Chicago.\n\nI don’t ever recall seeing this one, but it seemed familiar. Johnny Depp plays legendary gangster John Dillinger in a Untouchables-style movie about his bank robbing, personal life and eventual death. Depp isn’t too stellar in this. No one really is which is unfortunate as it stars Christian Bale who really doesn’t do much here. There’s a decent cast, and the source material is interesting, just the movie wasn’t. It comes off as that lame I’m not interested in researching how accurate much of this movie is to Dillinger’s life. The only kudos I give is that this IS filmed in Chicago. The use of the Biograph theater for the scene of Dillinger’s death was cool (as that is one fact that is true, Dillinger was gunned down by the authorities there). I doubt many movies can claim filming locations are historically accurate. I wouldn’t recommend watching, if even only to see those scenes. If you’re into this piece of American history, you definitely could overlook my qualms here and give it a watch.\n\nThe Matrix (Warner Bros, 1999)\n\nHere’s ANOTHER film, with scenes set in Chicago (supposedly).\n\nUpon this rewatch, I found the film still enjoyable. Last year, I tried to rewatch part 2 or 3 and turned it off as it was a bit too hokey and full of itself. It’s gotta be hard being a top box office hit and asked to follow up on that. I also feel the Matrix parallels to organized religion, one’s faith and human culture are too heavy handed. In the first movie, those parallels can be overlooked somewhat as we’re getting an introduction to its characters and world building. The story doesn’t get into deeper references, instead focusing on an original story and some good action scenes. The Matrix was the first big scale stop-slow-motion camera thing that we cannot unsee in cinema. In this one, those techniques still look like a work in progress and not complete. Even Keanu Reeves’ acting or non-acting (you like him or you don’t) didn’t distract. He plays laid back so well, and as the main character Neo, he’s supposed to feel out-of-sorts learning he is part of the Matrix (a computer program that masks real life). As for the Chicago connection, whenever I first watched this movie, I liked that they were using my city as a backdrop (at least by location/street names). It’s not shot here, there’s no visible landmarks, WE DONT HAVE A SUBWAY LIKE THAT, etc. So this time around, I was turned off by that. As a born-and-bred Chicagoan, do it right or don’t. The Wachawski siblings should have seen Blue Brothers or the Fugitive for the best examples on how to incorporate Chicago fully. Heck, even in Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy, which was all filmed in Chicago, didn’t reference the city by name, but showed how cool the city and its landmarks can look on the big screen. In times of the Quarantine, give this old gem a watch (but maybe brush by the rest of the trilogy).\n\nGood Liar (BRON studios, 2019)\n\nGood Liar, Good cast, Good premise, Bad movie. Helen Miren, Ian McKellan are good in their roles. It’s a story about a con man, which I wholeheartedly endorse. Then it bogs down with some shitty idea about the con man being in Germany during WWII and it gets really lame. They had me up to there: English con man finds easy marks, takes money, and is a real piece of work. Then I’m supposed to believe we find a path to his lost history and a revenge plot some 50 whatever years in the making. It was really thin and I couldn’t buy it. Feel free to skip this one.\n\nFord vs Ferrari (Chernin Entertainment, 2019)\n\nI had no intent on seeing this. It looked like a long turd starring Matt Damon. Christian Bale was a lead too, which makes it a tad better. The story is about the Le Mans auto race in France and all that sounded like a snoozer to me. The trailer didn’t help much. Then it was free on HBO and I well… I’m glad I watched it. The story revolves around an auto race, but it’s more about the energy and passion of the Ford motor company team that built a faster car than Ferrari (hence the lame ass movie name. I’ll give it to them, the movie was exactly about that, no side bullshit). Obscure stories from history make good movies. I wouldn’t have known about this story, or researched it, or listened to an NPR serial about it. The movie did a good job of humanizing Bale’s character and giving him the spotlight for the achievements he put his mind to. That was what made this worth the watch. It showed an outcome driven by passion and commitment, even in the face of micromanagement and physical and mechanical limitations. Who won? Watch and see (or Wiki it).\n\nDoctor Sleep (Warner Bros, 2019)\n\nThis is a sequel to that classic piece of cinema called the Shining. Sadly Stephen King didn’t write it, which I find odd. Like how do you add onto someone else’s story w/o their input? That turned me off from watching this initially. Then I watched a trailer and wasn’t jazzed by it. I’ve been wanting to watch newer movies and gave the trailer a second watch. This time, maybe it was a different or extended trailer, but it looked decent. Ewan McGreggor plays the older Danny, the young boy gifted w/ the Shining (the ability to talk to others telepathically, etc). We see his dysfunctional adult life and how he’s managed living with the Shining. Then we meet another little girl who can Shine, so much in fact that she draws a lot of attention. That brings into play the bad guys for this movie, a guild of travelers that live off the life force of people. It sounds really hokey and that did pull me out a bit. But then this is the Shining and its fucking creepy. Don’t sleep on that. When stuff gets real, the movie is good. There’s some great new Shining powers at play. There are some gruesome horror scenes that stand on their own in comparison to the original. This sequel revisits aspects from the original like the Overlook Motel, character flashbacks and things that give you nightmares for life. I was pleasantly surprised by Doctor Sleep and would give it a recommendation for a watch. I didn’t watch a director’s cut which has extra stuff, and might be interested in checking that out now that I enjoyed this version (itself clocking in at 2h32m).\n\nThe Firm (Paramount Pictures, 1993)\n\nI was leery of this film b/c it was based on a John Grisham novel and I confused him in my mind w/ author James Patterson (who churns out schlock and uses the backs of other writers to help pen his books). This was the 1990s when this suspense novel stuff was being turned into movies a lot; this being Grisham’s first novel on the screen. The main issue with this movie is, not that Tom Cruise is the lead, but that it’s almost 2h30m long. There was no need for this story to take that much time to fully tell. That said, the story is unique, part heist movie, part thriller. Young lawyer (Cruise) joins a Tennessee law firm and finds out their dirty secrets with just enough time to save himself from it all. The supporting cast is decent. Quaker Oats spokesman Wilford Brimley (RIP) plays head of security, which felt weird. No one else stands out (including Gene Hackman). The story takes way too much time front loading the characters instead of getting into the action. By the time shit starts getting serious, I was a little checked out. The whole movie feels a bit dated for my tastes. I was glad to watch it as an adult, but probably won’t ever watch this one before I die.\n\nThe Rental (Black Bear pictures, 2020)\n\nIt’s funny that streaming services call movies ’rentals.’ You’re not really renting those, in terms of Blockbuster, Hollywood Video, or movie rental places that don’t exist these days. Redbox is the only equivalent. When you have to physically return something, that’s a rental. When you press play on a digital file that goes away in 24-48 hours, that’s purchased content. I really don’t care honestly. I guess I am using this review to split hairs because that takes up more energy and word count than a review of this movie would. The Rental is supposed to be a horror thriller and it lightly fits those descriptions. The premise, what if you get an AirBnB and you’re being watched! That is pretty creepy. You got me hooked to watch. Then add in some internal struggle among friends, possible racism, and a lost dog, and you get a very slow, very convoluted horror movie that tells more than it shows. I dig movies with a small, limited cast. There’s 5 people and they are all great with decent acting resumes (Dan Stevens who I just saw in Lucy in the Sky, Jeremy Allen White one of the teen’s from Showtime’s Shameless series, Allison Brie the lead from Netflix Horse Girl, Sheila Vand from the sick flick A Girl Walks Home at Night, and Toby Huss aka the cabby from MTV commercials in the 90s). Directed by Dave Franco (who starred in The Disaster Artist, and is married to Allison Brie huh, oh and James Franco’s bro, meh). I wanted to like way more than I did. So back to streaming movies, if you call them rentals or whatever ok. Then being this is a rental, don’t rent it.\n\n___________________\n\nReviews below posted on 4/27/2020\n\nUncut Gems (2019, Elara Pictures)\n\nThis is going to be a flash review. I don’t really want to get into this because I wasn’t super nonplussed by this movie. Adam Sandler isn’t spectacular. The story is decent. NBA’s Kevin Garnett playing himself wasn’t really utilized, so why even bother (no need for having the authenticity of an NBA player in cast if he’s just wallpaper). Nod to the Sadfie Brothers as directors (check out their flick GoodTime, a recommendation from fellow zinester Anna Jo Beck). The ending was tense and very well done. If you want to sit through 2+ hours to get there, go for it.\n\nMa (2019, Blumhouse Productions)\n\nThis movie is listed as a horror thriller, which, I guess. From the trailer, a bunch of high school kids end up partying with an older woman and then shit gets weird. So maybe like a National Lampoons Misery or something. The only notable name cast as the title character Ma/Sue Ann is Octavia Spencer (The Help, Hidden Figures, but what I forgot about was her character in Comedy Central sitcom Halfway Home, which I LOVED back before streaming when you waited a week for a new episode). After her, the cast is a bunch of teenage actors playing all the party going high school kids. Juliette Lewis is one of the teen’s mom, which is pretty sad because she doesn’t really add or detract from the story. It could be any actor there and it wouldn’t matter. I thought there was gonna be some really horroshow violence, but the movie never really goes there. It takes a very slow time to ramp up. We see the kids forming friendships by going out and drinking, stumbling upon Ma to buy them booze, which leads to them drinking in her basement. Parties ensue, crowds get bigger, and Ma is texting and calling them all like she’s one of the gang. She trolls their social media pages to spy on the teens and get intel on what they like, etc. It’s totally creepy in that thriller sense. Imagine some older person buying kids drinks and then throwing the party in their house. It’s immoral, not as societal commentary on ageism. It’s just creepy to go into someone’s house you don’t know and then lose your faculties to drinking. What could happen? Of course things get weird. It becomes a horrorish movie somewhere around 2/3rds through. Just, it’s not done very well. I didn’t expect some Rob Zombie gore fest. But I did expect something shocking. There’s no jump out of your seat scene, no cover your eyes moments. There are some moments that beg, why is that happening or how much longer is this movie? It’s a short movie and I liked the idea of this story. There’s just nothing strong about it, be it casting, acting, or follow through. I wouldn’t put this on a watchlist, but always urge a look at the trailer or movie blurb to be your own judge.\n\nUs (2019, Monkeypaw productions)\n\nThis was the hyped second film from Jordan Peele after he became a horror movie icon with his directorial debut of Get Out. Us if definitely a creepy thriller, not so much a horror slasher movie, but still has some of those elements. I’m still into Jordan Peele for his comedy work on Key and Peele. I will, however, dismiss his acting in Keanu (both he and Key star, and he co-wrote) as it wasn’t stellar. His writing and directing are inventive and fresh, in a horror genre that as of late is a bit stale, mainly being inundated with remakes and ghost/haunting/possession films. I know I contradict that statement as Peele’s next movie is the upcoming Candyman remake. I hope it’s not a typical remake, but with him being a fan of the original and able to modernize the story, it shouldn’t be a copy. It’s shot in Chicago, parts in the North Park neighborhood (close to my hood) so I’m interested to see the scene shots and local elements. Yes, I need to get back on point. Us is a really creepy story about a family on vacation who is confronted by a look-a-like set of themselves. That’s a freaky enough intro to reel you in. The casting is good, having a balance between experienced and fresh faces. Lupita Nyong’o (12 Years a Slave, and I was surprised that in writing this, found she’s Maz Kantana in the new Star Wars movies!) is the mother and Winston Drake (M’Baku from Black Panther, “Yibambe, Yibambe”) is the father. Their children aren’t notable names, but they do a really great job rounding out the family dynamic. Supporting cast includes Tim Heidecker (aka Tim and Eric’s Awesome show on Cartoon Network) and Elisabeth Moss (whom my wife said was in Mad Men) as heads of another family that are friends with the main family. That’s about it for casting (as each actor gets to act twice with their roles as doppelgangers).\n\nAs for the movie, it starts off really intense. It follows a family at a beachside amusement park. A little girl enters a funhouse, think wall of mirrors with the lights off. It’s a really creepy set up for the movie. Jump to modern times with a cheesy Americana slice of life family going on vacation. The parents’ joking and banter is pretty enjoyable (I dig dumb puns and dad jokes, and Drake plays a great all-American dad type). We’re introduced to their friends, another family that is not likeable in the least: self-absorbed, narcissistic, drunks. This poses an opposite to the main characters, and distinguishes the main protagonists. And then it turns dark. Peele does a great job quickly getting to this point in the film. There’s not a lot of filler which is usually key for a horror movie. The family is confronted by their exact clones. The imagery of that is hair raising and leads to some suspenseful interactions. From there, I feel the movie peaks. It gets a bit uninteresting. The family fights for their life, there are some slasher moments, and then wraps up with an M. Night Shyamalan twist. I wasn’t really taken by any of the twists or reveals by the end. The ending and climax wasn’t bad, I just wasn’t shocked or thrilled by it. The one thing that I was left thinking at the end, which I feel wasn’t supposed to be the main point the audience was supposed to question was, what’s going to happen with all the people in red jumpsuits? (that’s not a spoiler as that fact doesn’t give away the reveal at the ending). The first 30/45 minutes are worth the watch alone. It’s a 2 hour movie, and def is enjoyable for sure. I’d give it a watch (maybe not a rewatch).\n\n___________________\n\nReviews below posted on 4/16/2020\n\nContagion (Warner Bros, 2011)\n\nRead my review of this pandemic classic here (published in Quaranzine Issue #32 by Public Collectors)\n\n___________________\n\nReviews below posted on 4/12/2020\n\nBadlands (2019, Papa Octopus)\n\nThe movie cover for this on Netflix displayed only one man, a western clad Wes Studi. I’m a big fan. Love that dude and was hoping this would be a showcase for him. Watching the credits, it has little star power other than Studi: country singer Chase Atkins (who I only know of becuase he was on the only season of the Apprentice I’ve ever watched. Yes I watched it. I’ve also watched a dozen Trump daily press briefings and the current briefings have better acting), Tony Tod aka the Candyman, and I guess Mira Sorvino. I wouldn’t know because I shut it off after like 10 minutes. It felt like a made-for-TV movie. The story seemed like a flimsy Western with a typical shootout to kick things off. I kept thinking of cheap TV late 90s Fox show Adventure of Brisco County Jr. At least that had Bruce Campbell and it was supposed to look shitty. I mean even the movie title during the credits looked like some 80s arcade game logo. But this was made last year. Anyway, big pass on this one. Be your own judge.\n\nBlade Runner (1982, The Ladd Company)\n\nIt took 40 years for me to see this movie. Not sure if seeing it sooner would have made me feel anything different. I know its a classic, cult, cannon, whatever you might want to label it. But I wasn’t that impressed. My wife, having seen it before, thought we had recently watched it. After discussion, she was noting Total Recall which ends up making sense. The standouts for this movie were its look and feel. The set design and world building were good. Much like Total Recall or Fifth Element, Ridley Scott created a unique world that fit the story and its characters. Scott, also directed some of the Alien franchise, so imagine a dark, gritty, rainy, desolate futuristic world, just set in the 80s thinking it was 2019. Flying cars and huge talking billboards looked cool, but didn’t add much to the story. Harrison Ford is the main, and all I was thinking was how he sandwiched this role between the first Indiana Jones and last Star Wars movies. Both of which were of course massive successes in comparison to Blade Runner. I just wanted something more from this I guess. The story was slow, there were very little action sequences, and there was way too much left to be imagined. We roll along without much explanation as to why and when we finally get there, the payoff isn’t spectacular. Like I said, had I seen this earlier in life, I might not have been too hung up on some of the things I didn’t like. By that I’m agreeing there’s definitely a cult aspect that would have made this cool. And I might not have been turned off by how slow it seemed. Knowing there’s been a sequel some 35 years later and I’ve seen modern takes on this type of thematic futuristic cop/bad guys movie, I’m underwhelmed after watching this. I’d give this a shot if you’ve never seen it. I might check out the sequel. Maybe not. Worth a quarantine watch for sure, because we all got the time.\n\nRambo Last Blood (2019, Lionsgate)\n\nSylvester Stallone’s Rambo is a staple of American action movies. This newest, and hopefully final installment of the franchise, by name at least, was a mixed bag of old school Rambo with updated politics. Its gotta be the last film because Stone’s getting up there in years. He actually looked better in this than the last few Rocky or Expendables franchise releases. Rambo looked fucking aged and it showed, but of course was able to kill dozens of guys half his age. This take on Rambo was as if he pulled a Liam Neeson from Taken doling out John Wick type violence but also is a Trump supporter. The previews and reviews I heard about this were that Rambo’s now living on a farm and people come there to hunt him down. It was a take on First Blood where he fights for survival, killing a bunch of people and coming out the lone survivor. That’s not a wrong comparison to Last Blood, only that its more pro America, with that Make America Great attitude, and that he’s not being hunted, rather drawing the hunt to him. Its a short watch clocking in at about 1h20mins. It takes about two thirds of the movie to really get in Rambo mode. The premise is he’s settled on a farm caring for his niece and her grandmother. Not to give much away but his niece goes to Mexico, Rambo gets targeted by leaders of a cartel, and they hunt him down and tons of people get killed. The last twenty minutes are all action. They go a bit too bloody, cut off limbs and heads pile up in an unrealistic fashion. Don’t get me wrong, its cool looking, but no way each shot can be an exploding head shot you know. The rub for me is that its all about revenge, but that rage is directed at evil Mexican bad guys. Its a very American perspective, wanting revenge and taking it out on foreigners, people of color at that. It plays off that fear of getting kidnapped and/or ransomed by Mexican gangs. What if a real GI Joe type hero could save you? Not just save you, but kill ‘em all and let god sort them out. I felt that was a real cheap way to bake a modern patriotic style message into the film. Don’t get me wrong, that’s all fucking Rambo is. In Rambo 3, he goes back to Vietnam and wholesale murders tons of Asian ‘bad guys’. This one just felt blanketed by racism without using slurs or caricatures. A great example is that Rambo’s niece and her grandmother speak Spanish, which he clearly understands, but never speaks. Like Sylvester Stone couldn’t be bothered to learn conversational Spanish for the role. Or that the audience wouldn’t trust a Rambo that could speak Spanish. Anyway, its a really short, un-engaging watch. I wouldn’t have put this on but it popped up for free on Amazon. I would never pay for this but since it was free, why the fuck not.\n\n—————————————————–\n\nReviews below posted on 4/5/2020\n\nThe Host (2006, Chungeorahm Film)\n\nI saw this at the Landmark the year it was released, having heard that it was like Godzilla, or something. Then after Parasite hit big last year, everyone started talking about the director Bong Joon Ho. Paraite is a great movie too, but it made me remember this gem. My wife hadn’t seen it, so after we rented Parasite, I found The Host streaming on Tubi TV. No one could have anticipated the success of Parasite, so The Host was licensed to bullshit like Tubi, and thankfully I got to watch it for free. Enough of my bs, what about the flick. What I took away from this movie when I first saw it was how funny it was, and how well cast. They did a great job finding actors perfect for their roles. The stand out was Kang-ho Song who plays the father Gang-Doo (also the father in Parasite), who is great at being aloof and serious at the same time. The plot centers around an attack on Seoul by a mutated monster that grabs and stockpiles its prey, the most notable being a little girl whose family battles hard to find her. The family consists of a grandfather who runs a food/snack truck and his adult children: a big sister who is a nationally recognized athlete, an older brother who’s employed, the little girl’s father(who is a screw up by all accounts), and then of course the little girl/niece/granddaughter herself. There is a bunch of infighting when the father won’t give up looking for his daughter. The family recounts how he’s a screw up and blames him for letting the girl get taken by the monster. They all rally and begin breaking into the quarantine zone where the monster has been spotted so they can conduct an in-depth search of sewers and tunnels. The movie injects underlying anti-government messages with some decent public protest scenes. I remembered the monster looking really cheesy, as in the graphics, not its physiology. This rewatch though, the graphics look good, so chalk that up to me being stupid. The story plays out with a great mix of comedy and suspense. It’s not gory or scary at all. It’s not too heavy handed in teaching any lesson (which maybe Parasite could be slapped on the wrist for). Instead it’s a good movie about family and the lengths we go to support and care for each other. I think that’s a good message we could all get behind these days. Def worth a watch.\n\nHellraiser 2: Hellbound (1988, New World Pictures)\n\nI won’t go into too much detail here as this horror franchise is one of my favorites and I’d have to really devote some time to dig into a worthy review. That said, this one is the goriest of the 10 movies (yes there are that many Hellraisers). Its got skinless people, brain eating, unnecessary neurology surgery and chains, bloody chains. This one builds off the first movie, but offers quite a lot of flash back scenes from part one. If you haven’t see part 1, the premise is there’s a puzzle box that contains a gateway to hell. Whoever opens is then targeted by demons and left to anguish in eternal pain. Sounds really brutal. Also, Hellbound is set partially in a hospital. I work in one and never really got spooked by that fact until last week. I had to go look for a physician office and entered a sheltered off wing, closed to patients and left vacant. Imagine a horror movie walk through a hospital: no one around, empty beds, flickering lights, dusty equipment, phones that don’t work. This had all that. And all I could think of as I walked down the hall was, please don’t let Halloween’s Michael Myers or Hellraiser’s Pinhead be here to murder me.\n\nThe last time I had watched this was around 2 years go. That was the night our cat Julie was put down. She sat in my lap breathing shallowly as I watched this movie and tried to ignore the impending situation. A house call vet would come to euthanize her before the movie was over. I was always really afraid and repulsed by this movie, but having Julie there to comfort me felt right. I can now watch this one whenever because i got over my initial fright associated with the movie. Maybe its this memory with Julie that calms me.\n\nIf you like horror, if you like this franchise, if you’ve never seen any Hellraiser movies before, if you are at home quarantined and need a fictional scare versus the real scare we face, give this a watch. Its free to stream right now on Amazon, maybe Tubi TV too."
