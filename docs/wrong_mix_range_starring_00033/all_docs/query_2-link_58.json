        "text": "\"My name is Inigo Montoyo. You killed my Father. Prepare to die!\" - The Princess Bride\n\nThis famous line means so much to so many and honestly earlier this morning, it took on a WHOLE new layer for me and possibly anyone else who has lost a loved one. Maybe you know this already but if you don't, holy moly it's worth a read through.\n\nI came across the below TikTok video from Kathryn G who stated in the original video that she had recently lost her father to cancer and wanted to know if the rumor she had heard was true.\n\nThe Princess Bride\n\nKathryn mentioned that the film The Princess Bride was one of her Father's favorite movies, it has always been a favorite of hers as well. Inigo Montoyo's character was also her Father's favorite from the film.\n\nThe Rumor\n\nSo the rumor she had heard was that when the actor, Mandy Patinkin, playing Ignigo Montoyo, went to say that line he was actually thinking about his own Father, who had passed away. The line she is referring to is\n\n\"I want my father back, you son of a *****!\"\n\nAre You Ready for the Waterworks?\n\nNot only is the rumor true but Mandy Patinkin, the actor, who was tagged multiple times in the original video dueted her video (spliced his reply to her question) and posted it on his page.\n\nIn the recording, Mandy confirms that yes, the rumor is true and goes even farther into the explanation.\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nThe moment Mandy read the script he knew exactly how he would channel the anger and sadness of the six-fingered man fight scene. Sadly his own father had passed from cancer and he knew in his heart.\n\n\"If I can get the six-fingered man and kill him, I am killing the cancer that took my Dad away and I'll get to see my Dad again.\"\n\nHe mentioned how during filming he would walk around the grounds of the castle speaking to his Father. He knew when it came time to fight, he was going to speak those emotions into the famous line, \"I want my father back, you son of a *****!\" In essence, bringing his own Dad back him back to life.\n\nThe Emotion of It All\n\nAfter that scene, he went right back outside and spoke with his Father and told him, \"I got him, Dad\". He wanted Kathryn and anyone who has lost someone to know, you too can speak to your loved ones anytime to keep them close. He mentioned how he wanted to know Kathryn's Fathers name so he could add it to his nightly prayers and I just started sobbing. They were sobbing, she was sobbing and after you watch the below video, I bet you will be too!\n\nNow, excuse me while I go watch The Princess Bride. Fun fact, I walked down the aisle to a guitar version of the score from The Princess Bride for my wedding. Nine years going strong as of yesterday!\n\nThe Princess Bride\n\nLOOK: The Most Famous Actor Born Every Year\n\nLOOK: The most famous actress born the same year as you\n\nMany of the actresses in this story not only made a name for themselves through their collection of iconic performances, but also through the selfless, philanthropic nature with which many of them approached their stardom. In an age of flipping the script on societal norms, many of these actresses are using their voices and platforms to be advocates for those who are otherwise unheard."
