        "text": "\"Unbroken\"\n\nLouis Zamperini always wanted to visit Tokyo. He was supposed to compete there as an Olympic athlete. He arrived instead as a U.S. POW in World War II. \"Be careful what you wish for,\" a comrade advises in this bracing biopic. The early scenes in a bomber flying missions over the Pacific are riveting. The Oscar-nominated cinematography puts us right there as the crew dodges flak and fighter planes. The film's second half, set in a brutal prison camp, is wrenching, but we've seen it before. The best part of Angelina Jolie's second directing effort is Jack O'Connell's spirited portrayal of \"Zamp.\" The modest hero shows he has what it takes to survive with honor. Renowned filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen co-wrote the screenplay, based on Laura Hillenbrand's book. The 2014 film cost $65 million and grossed $161 million. PG-13, 138 minutes. DVD extra: a featurette. Blu-ray only: deleted scenes and four featurettes. From Universal. Released March 24 on DVD, Blu-ray and iTunes; and April 21 on Netflix mail and Redbox.\n\n\"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies\"\n\nJust when we were tiring of these big-budget movie adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth fantasy novels, director Peter Jackson surprises us. This third and final chapter turns out to be the best yet. Martin Freeman locks down the emotional center with meaningful reaction shots as Bilbo Baggins, a lone hobbit with a traveling party of rugged dwarves. Computerized shots of battling armies impress, though the swordplay becomes overwhelming. A subplot covers a forbidden love between a dwarf and an elf. The fine cast includes Ian McKellen, Richard Armitage, Orlando Bloom and Evangeline Lilly. The 2014 film cost $250 million and grossed $955 million. PG-13, 144 minutes. Blu-ray extras: featurettes and a music video. From Warner Home Video. Released March 24 on DVD, Blu-ray and iTunes; and April 21 on Netflix mail and Redbox.\n\nDVD review of \"The Hobbit: The Unexpected Journey\" from 2013\n\nDVD review of \"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug\" from 2014\n\n\"Into the Woods\"\n\nCharacters from four Grimms Brothers fairy tales cross paths in a deep, dark forest in this musical mash-up based on the Tony Award-winning Broadway play. Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel and Jack of beanstalk fame take turns interacting with a childless couple trying to break a witch's curse. For fairy-tale fusion, \"Shrek\" and \"Hoodwinked!\" are cleverer. \"Woods\" stars Meryl Streep, Anna Kendrick, Emily Blunt, Chris Pine and Johnny Depp performing polished songs by Stephen Sondheim. Directed by Rob Marshall (\"Chicago\"), the 2014 film cost $50 million and grossed $199 million. PG, 125 minutes. Extras: Streep sings \"She'll Never Be Back\"; featurettes, commentary and more. . Released March 24 on DVD, Blu-ray, iTunes and Redbox; and April 21 on Netflix.\n\n\"A MusiCares Tribute to Paul McCartney\"\n\nMan, those septuagenarians can rock. Especially Paul McCartney. At this gala 2012 charity event in Los Angeles, the ex-Beatle accepts an award, performs four classic songs and cheers others covering his tunes. Performers include Alicia Keys, James Taylor, Norah Jones and Duane Eddy. Neil Young sings \"I Saw Her Standing There,\" ad-libbing, \"She was no beauty queen.\" The camera catches Tom Hanks, Little Steven, David Crosby and Eric Idle in the adoring audience, clad in tuxes and gowns. If he'd lived, would John Lennon have approved of this black-tie event? Maybe he'd have mellowed, but no doubt years ago he'd have sneered. Unrated, 60 minutes. No extras. From Shout Factory. Released March 24 on DVD and Blu-ray.\n\n\"Song One\"\n\nA woman trying to bring her younger brother out of a coma meets his favorite singer-songwriter, who's trying to snap out of a creative slump. They hit it off, slowly and tentatively, in this mild 2014 romantic drama. As new lovers, Anne Hathaway and Johnny Flynn convey the nervous excitement of a blossoming relationship, but little chemistry develops. The indie rock songs sprinkled throughout help the film, but it lacks the intangible spark of the similar 2006 Oscar winner \"Once.\" PG-13, 86 minutes. Extras: four deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes footage in the music studio. From Cinedigm. Released March 24 on DVD, Blu-ray, iTunes, Netflix and Redbox.\n\n\"The Whole Bean\"\n\nWho wipes his feet on the welcome mat while exiting a building? Who locks the door of his subcompact car with a padlock and tosses the key onto the backseat? Who packs cans of baked beans in his vacation suitcase? Mr. Bean, that's who. Rowan Atkinson's peculiar, childlike, mostly mute character draws from everyday experiences to create the strangest situations. His hilarious original British TV series (1990-1995), previously released on DVD in 2003, is back in a digitally remastered set for a small fraction of the price. TV-G. Four DVDs, 14 episodes, 350 minutes. Extras: three missing scenes, two never-seen sketches, 72 minutes of best bits, and a 40-minute documentary, \"The Story of Mr. Bean.\" From Shout Factory. Released March 24.\n\n\"Gunned Down\"\n\nThe National Rifle Association in the 1960s was a sportsmen's group offering gun safety tips to hunters. This January episode of the PBS investigative series \"Frontline\" charts the NRA's startling transformation into the country's most powerful political lobbying group a few decades later. Clips of tragic school shootings contrast with the now-famous Charlton Heston line about prying his weapon \"from my cold, dead hands.\" Interviews with leaders on both sides of the gun control debate show how wide the gulf has become. Unrated, 60 minutes. No extras. From PBS. Released March 24 on DVD.\n\nOther recent home-video releases include:\n\n\"Tom Sawyer,\" a 1973 musical version of Mark Twain's classic novel, nominated for three Oscars, starring Johnny Whitaker as Tom, Jodie Foster as Becky Thatcher, Warren Oates and Celeste Holm. With a screenplay and songs penned by Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman of \"Mary Poppins\" fame. From Timeless Media Group. Released March 24.\n\n\"Sunken Ship Rescue,\" a January episode of the PBS series \"Nova,\" about efforts to raise and salvage the 45,000-ton cruise ship Costa Concordia, which capsized off Italy's coast three years ago, killing 32 people. From PBS Home Video. Released March 24.\n\n\"Clean Spirit,\" a 2014 documentary about the sport of cycling, following one team at the Tour de France that speaks out against doping.

From Olive Films. Blu-ray debut March 24.\n\n\"Marvel Knights: Wolverine vs. Sabertooth Reborn,\" an animated grand finale of the grudge match between two Marvel Comics superheroes. From Shout Factory. Released March 24.\n\n\"A Path Appears,\" a 2015 TV documentary series about gender inequality, poverty and how individuals can create meaningful and lasting change.
