        "text": "Christian Charles Philip Bale (born 30 January 1974) is an English actor.[1][2] He has starred in both blockbuster films and smaller projects from independent producers and art houses.\n\nBale was born in Wales, to English mother Jenny (née James), a circus performer, and South African–born father, David Charles Howard Bale, an entrepreneur, commercial pilot, and talent manager.[5][6][7] He spent his childhood in England, Portugal and the United States.[8] His first foray into acting was a commercial for the fabric softener Lenor in 1982. A year later, he appeared in a Pac-Man cereal commercial playing a child rock star. In 1984, he made his stage debut in The Nerd, opposite Rowan Atkinson.\n\nBale first caught the public eye at the age of 13, when he was cast in the starring role of Steven Spielberg's Empire of the Sun (1987). Based on the original story by J. G. Ballard, Bale played an English boy who is separated from his parents and subsequently finds himself lost in a Japanese internment camp during World War II.[3] In 2000, he garnered critical acclaim for his portrayal of serial killer Patrick Bateman in American Psycho. He earned a reputation as a method actor after he lost 63 pounds to play the role of Trevor Reznik in The Machinist (2004).[4]\n\nBale went on to receive greater commercial recognition and acclaim for his performance as Bruce Wayne / Batman in Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins (2005), The Dark Knight (2008) and The Dark Knight Rises (2012). He also portrayed Dicky Eklund in the biopic The Fighter (2010), for which he received critical acclaim and won several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role.\n\nFurther Reads[]\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Bale#Career\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Bale#Personal_life\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Bale_filmographyh\n\nttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Christian_Bale\n\nReferences[]\n\n^ \"Q&A with Christian Bale\".
