His career ended in 1301 when the Black Guelph and their French allies seized control of the city. They took Dante's possessions and sentenced him to be permanently banished from Florence, threatening the death penalty upon him if he returned. Dante spent most of his time in exile writing new pieces of literature. It is believed that around 1307 he interrupts his unfinished work, Convivio, a reflection of his love poetry philosophy of the Roman tradition, to begin The Comedy (later known as The Divine Comedy). He writes a book called De Vulgari Eloquentia explaining his idea to combine a number of Italian dialects to create a new national language. In 1310 he writes De Monarchia presenting Dante's case for a one-ruler world order. Among his works, his reputation rests on his last work, The Divine Comedy. He began writing it somewhere between 1307-1314 and finished it only a short while before his death in 1321, while in exile.\n\nThree famous canadians\n\nLive in the late 1980s and the early 1990s and starred as the title characters in the films Wayne's World, Austin Powers, and Shrek.

However, RKO executives used her to boost box office potential of the Fritz Lang production Clash by Night. After the film performed well, Fox employed a similar tactic, and she was cast as the ditzy receptionist with Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers in Howard Hawks's slapstick comedy Monkey Business. Critics no longer ignored her, and both films' success at the box office was partly attributed to Monroe's growing popularity. Fox finally gave her a starring role in 1952 with Don't Bother to Knock, in which she portrayed a deranged babysitter who attacks the little girl in her care. It was a cheaply made B-movie, and although the reviews were mixed, they claimed it demonstrated Monroe's ability and confirmed she was ready for more leading roles\n\nAbout a boy\n\nAbout a boy About a Boy is a 2002 British-American comedy-drama film co-written and directed by brothers Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz.

By his thirteenth film, Caught in the Rain (1914), Chaplin began to direct his own films. Chaplin now slowed the pace of his films, reduced the number of visual jokes but increased the time spent on each one. Chaplin placed the emphasis on the character rather than slapstick events. The themes of his films became more serious and reflected his childhood experiences of poverty, hunger and loneliness. Chaplin's work revolutionized film comedy and turned it into an art form. Chaplin's films were highly successful and became a household name throughout the world. Charles Chaplin died in Switzerland on 25th December, 1977.\n\nMartin Lawrence\n\nTwo sisters: Ursula Lawrence (born in 1966; runs Lawrence's fan club), Rae Proctor (Lawrence's personal assistant) Brother: Robert Lawrence Father: John Lawrence (served in the US military; worked as a police officer at the time) His parents divorced in 1973.

The humour ­ mostly gentle, sometimes cruel, described and criticised perfectly every aspect of the complicated society, the naïve King and the women who had secret love affairs. It is clear that the actors gave their best while filming the movie and got the result they may be proud of. As for more, the story itself is catching. The main character, the poor playwright Moliere has the honour of writing a comedy about his tragic life and lost yet true love, and his feelings, so similar to those of the viewers, reach everybody through the detailed story. It can be said that the new, 2007 \"Moliere\" was composed by a genuine author with the same principles of life as of the 17 th century Moliere. To sum up, it can be said without hesitation that the movie included great work from the actors, the main role played by Romain Duris, and wonderful work from the\n\nLõuna-Aafrika\n\nCULTURE With a dynamic fusion of African, European and Asian influences, South Africa is a hotbed of originality and creativity. This is particularly evident in the music, which ranges from indigenous township rave music, known as kwaito, to world-renowned African jazz by such legendary talents as Hugh Masekela and Miriam Makeba. Theatre, too, is alive and well, with sophisticated venues in each city presenting everything from the classics to homegrown drama, dance and comedy. A range of galleries, shops, studios and streetside stalls exhibit traditional African art as well as contemporary fine art. But its people are South Africa's greatest asset - and it is the interplay between its various cultures and the heritage of the individual and shared histories, which shapes the nation. Many religions exist in South Africa like Catholic, Anglican, other Christian, Islam and many others.\n\nAre you experienced- book review\n\nmakes her journey longer and it tears her apart from her friend Dave witch who they planned the journey together. Due to Liz departure Dave finds himself in the middle of India with nothing more than his backpack. It makes the storyline superior which is always better than following the easily predictable plot. “Are you experienced ” is not the best nor the worst read. It’s described as very funny but I think it’s more drama, than comedy. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in travel books and fiction.\n\nReview: Educating Rita\n\nReview: Educating Rita Educating Rita is one William Russell's best-known work. In 1980 it came out as a play, but in 1983 the play was adapted for film.

Anyhow, it was not until the midchapters of the book, when I realized that I was holding most probably one of the best books, I had ever read, in my hand. To understand it, you have to read it. After I read the book I changed my mind about the movie. Before reading the book I thought that the movie is more so called\" guy movie\" and me as a casual fan of comedy wont like it. To finish all I have to say is that I liked the movie but I loved the book.\n\nLapidaarne inglisekeelne materjal Shakespeare'i tragöödiatest\n\nIt was first printed in 1623 (First Folio) Tragedies were poignant revelations of humanity's struggle between good and evil and search for moral order A flaw ultimately results in death or destruction Some inspired by Shakespeare's study of Lives by Greek historian and essayist Plutarch and Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles All of Shakespeare's tragic protagonists are capable of both good and evil Titus Andronicus is about a Roman king whose daughter is raped, is full of violence and comedy.

Charlie put on old baggy trousers, a tight jacket, enormously large shoes and a small bowler hat. He also had a small mustache and a cane. His success was immediate and he remained true to his funny costume all through his career. In 1918 he formed his own company and started producing films. He produced 80 films and in 79 of them he played the central character. Many have said that he was the greatest comic genius of all time. What made his comedy so popular was the sympathy for human beings of the oddest sorts as well as for the ordinary people. The life of his characters was full of misfortunes, but the always overcame their despair with courage and determination. Although he denied any social meaning in his films he ridiculed the values of society mercilessly. In \"Modern Times\" he showed the terrible working conditions at the production line in a giant US factory.\n\nCamp Rock 2\n\nCamp Rock 2 Genres: Comedy, Musical, Romance Actors: Alyson Stoner, Demi Lovato, Joe Jonas, Nick Jonas, Kevin Jonas and the others .

Great Britain (especially England) is a non touching culture. When greeting someone a handshake accompanied by a \"Pleased to meet you\" is appropriate. When departing be sure to shake everyone's hand, a general group wave as is often done in the United States is not looked on favorably. Strong eye contact is not overly common among strangers and casual acquaintances, too much eye contact is considered and invasion of privacy. Eye contact is used when one really wants to make a point, when speaking with close friends, and when interest in a person or topic wants to be stressed.
