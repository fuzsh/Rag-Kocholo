Francis Ford Coppola’s cinematographic retelling of Bram Stoker’s novel became a box office hit in 1992, crowned by three Academy Awards. Its fresh and bold conceptual energy turned the movie into the most influential vampire film in decades. A film whose opulence and sense of spectacle triggered a whole new wave of contemporary horror films. One of the film’s strengths was coming back to Bram Stoker’s original novel instead of adapting the more popular theater play from the 1920s. Now, for ONE-NIGHT-ONLY, experience the North American Premiere of Bram Stoker's Dracula in Concert. 110 musicians from Chicago Philharmonic, accompanied by a full choir, bring Wojciech Kilar's haunting score to life in sync with the film. Saturday, November 9, 2024, at Auditorium Theatre. Polish composer Wojciech Kilar (1932-2013), one of the most respected European composers of the last decades, was chosen to write the original score. As Coppola did in 1 972 when he approached Italian composer Nino Rota to score THE GODFATHER, the surprising choice of Wojciech Kilar would break all musical of the genre. Belonging to the generation of Krzysztof Penderecki and Henryk Górecki, Kilar’s glorious score dwells between lush romanticism, mysticism and avantgarde. Although Kilar had written dozens of soundtracks for European films before, it is BRAM STOKER’S DRACULA that ensures his position in the pantheon of film music legends. This event is rated R. Contains some adult material. Under 17 years old requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.

In 2018, Marvel Studios’ “Black Panther” quickly became a global sensation and cultural phenomenon, showing a new dimension of what SuperHero films could be. Rolling Stone raved, “The film lights up the screen with a full-throttle blast of action and fun. That’s to be expected. But what sneaks up and floors you is the film’s racial conscience and profound, astonishing beauty.” Relive the excitement of T’Challa becoming king and battling Killmonger all while the “one of the country’s finest symphonic orchestras” (Chicago Tribune) performs Ludwig Göransson’s Oscar® and Grammy®-winning score live to picture. Joining the orchestra for the concert is Massamba Diop, the revered Senegalese tama drummer who recorded and co-created parts of the movie score with composer Göransson. Massamba Diop- the world-renowned Senegalese tama drummer who not only played on but also composed sections of the original score- will join the orchestra. Composer Ludwig Göransson (who is known for his work as producer to Childish Gambino in addition to composing for tv and film including Oppenheimer, Tenet, Creed, The Book of Boba Fett, and The Mandalorian) crafted the score to Black Panther in collaboration with Senegalese musicians Baba Maal and Massamba Diop. The Academy Award winning movie score combines traditional Senegalese music, Western symphonic scoring, and 21st Century digital production techniques to parallel the film’s Afro-futurist themes and create a sound that feels both futuristic and ancient. In a particularly inspired collaboration between Göransson and Diop, the film hero T’Challa is represented by three notes on the talking drum that sound rhythmically similar to the name “T’Challa.” This theme is repeated throughout the film, first by the talking drum and then the entire orchestra, and is transformed depending on the scene.\n\nCelebrate Complexions 30th anniversary season with their newest work, For Crying Out Loud, set to the music of the internationally renowned band U2!

On March 30, 1958, Alvin Ailey led a group of young African-American modern dancers in a now-fabled performance at the 92nd Street Y in New York City that forever changed the perception of American dance. Mr. Ailey was a pioneer in establishing a multi-racial repertory company that presented important works by both dance masters and emerging choreographers. Through the remarkable artistry of extraordinary dancers, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater continues to celebrate the African-American cultural experience and to preserve and enrich the American modern dance tradition. With a repertory of over 235 works by more than 90 choreographers and a permanent home at The Joan Weill Center for Dance in New York City—the largest building dedicated to dance in New York City, the dance capital of the world—the Ailey legacy flourishes, using the universal language of dance as a medium for honoring the past, celebrating the present and fearlessly reaching into the future."
