        "text": "============================================================================\n\nKinky Boots – Sunday, May 28 @7:30 pm\n\nEmmy and Tony-winning pop icon Cyndi Lauper, direction and choreography by Jerry Mitchell and book by Broadway legend Harvey Fierstein, this dazzling, fabulously sassy and uplifting award-winning musical celebrates a joyous story of Brit grit to high-heeled hit, as it takes you from the factory floor of Northampton to the glamorous catwalks of Milan!\n\nBig-hearted and high-spirited, the West End musical Kinky Boots — inspired by true events — tells the story of Charlie Price, the new owner of his late father’s Northampton shoe factory. Trying to live up to his father’s legacy and save the family business from bankruptcy, Charlie finds inspiration in the form of Lola, an entertainer in need of some sturdy stilettos.\n\nAs they work to turn the factory around, this unlikely pair finds that they have more in common than they ever dreamed possible — and discovers that when you change your mind, you can change the world.\n\nKinky Boots made its Broadway debut in April 2013, going on to win a season-high 13 Tony Award nominations, winning six (including Best Musical and Best Score).\n\nKinky Boots beloved status in the West End was consolidated in its Best New Musical victory at the 2016 Olivier Awards ceremony, proving that sometimes the best way to fit in is to stand out!\n\nDon’t miss the “freshest, most fabulous, feel-good musical of the decade” (The Hollywood News) as it arrives on cinema screens. It’s the ultimate fun night out, so come experience the energy, joy and laughter of this dazzling show.\n\nThe Sedona International Film Festival is proud to partner with Theatrikos Theatre Company to bring movies to Downtown Flagstaff! This special series kicks off on Sunday, May 28 with “Kinky Boots: The Musical” at 7:30 p.m. at Theatrikos Theatre Company to celebrate ArtX weekend.\n\n============================================================================\n\nMrs Henderson Presents – Monday, May 29 @2:00 pm\n\nMrs. Henderson Presents was nominated for two Academy Awards, including Best Actress for Judi Dench and Best Costume Design. The film — starring Dame Judi Dench and Bob Hoskins — was a major audience hit and critical sensation when it premiered in the Sedona International Film Festival’s cinema series in 2006.\n\nMrs. Henderson Presents is inspired by true events.\n\nLondon, 1937. Mrs. Laura Henderson (Judi Dench), a woman of wealth and connections, has just buried her beloved husband. And now she’s bored. At 69, she is far too energetic and vital to fade into gentle widowhood. What she needs, says her friend Lady Conway, is a hobby. Collecting diamonds, perhaps? Or doing charitable works? But, to the shock of her friends she instead buys a theatre — the Windmill Theatre in the heart of Soho.\n\nShe knows nothing about running it, so she hires a manager: enter Vivian Van Damm (Bob Hoskins). Their love-hate relationship sparks fireworks — and historic innovations in British theatre.\n\nVan Damm’s idea is “Revuedeville” or non-stop entertainment. It is a first, and the Windmill is packed – until other theatres copy it. Then it’s Laura’s turn to devise another first — put naked girls on stage!\n\nBut as the bombing of London begins, the government threatens to close the theatre. Mrs. Henderson’s fighting spirit is revealed — and so is the secret that drew her to the Windmill in the first place.\n\nThe Sedona International Film Festival is proud to partner with Theatrikos Theatre Company to bring movies to Downtown Flagstaff! This special series kicks off on Sunday, May 28 with “Kinky Boots: The Musical” at 7:30 p.m. at Theatrikos Theatre Company to celebrate ArtX weekend.\n\n============================================================================\n\nKeeping Mum – Monday, May 29 @7:30 pm\n\nKeeping Mum stars Dame Maggie Smith, Kristin Scott Thomas, Rowan Atkinson and the late Patrick Swayze.\n\nSome family secrets are best kept buried.\n\nKeeping Mum stars Atkinson as Walter Goodfellow, an absent-minded vicar of a rural parish who is so distracted by the pressures of his job that he fails to notice his wife’s (Thomas) dalliance with her brash golf instructor (Swayze), his daughter’s parade of new boyfriends, and his young son’s regular trouncing by the school’s bullies.\n\nEnter their charming new housekeeper, Grace (Smith), the answer to the family’s prayers: a sweet, grey-haired old lady with her own distinctive definition of cleaning house.\n\nOne by one, the family members find that Grace is able to solve their problems, but they don’t realize that her means are leading to a lot of ends and the population of their sleepy hamlet is rapidly diminishing.\n\n“British comedy at its very best!” — Daily Mirror\n\n“Witty, sly, devilishly-funny, with bravura performances!” — Jeffrey Lyons, NBC’s Reel Talk\n\nThe Sedona International Film Festival is proud to partner with Theatrikos Theatre Company to bring movies to Downtown Flagstaff!
