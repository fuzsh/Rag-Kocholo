        "text": "One of my most-anticipated events of the year is coming up this week, and I could not be more psyched about it. Before COVID hit, Missoula's Roxy Theater started talking a bit about their plans for the Camp Horror Film Festival - it was born out of Trash Talk, their monthly series where they show all kinds of weird horror and exploitation movies. The idea was to do that but spread out over a few days - play some obscurities, some classics, some shorts from upcoming filmmakers, throw some comedy in there too, and package it all as one big summer camp experience.\n\nAnd now, almost two years later, it's finally set to happen - the Camp Horror Film Festival is taking place at The Roxy starting this Thursday, August 26th, and going through Saturday, August 28th. They've got three headlining movies, one for each night of the festival - the first is 68 Kill, an independent horror movie from 2017. Then on Friday, they're showing Dr. Butcher M.D. (also known as Zombie Holocaust) in glorious 35mm. And finally, on Saturday, they're showing the cult classic Sleepaway Camp, an appropriate way to end this camp-themed weekend.\n\nThey'll also have their comedy showcase on Friday and a block of horror shorts screening on Sunday - and after the showing of Sleepaway Camp, you'll be able to head out back to the Roxy Garden for s'mores, beer, and to hang out with the Sack Lunch Slasher, who will be at the theater throughout the festival.\n\nFor horror fans, it sounds like something they absolutely should not miss - and hopefully, we'll be seeing more from the Camp Horror Festival in the years to come.\n\nIf you want to check it out, tickets for the movies and events are available at the Roxy's website, or you can check out camphorror.org.\n\nLOOK: The Most Famous Actor Born Every Year"
