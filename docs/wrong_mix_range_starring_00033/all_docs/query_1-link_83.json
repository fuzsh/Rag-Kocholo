        "text": "The favourite accusation against Richard Curtis movies is that he's a Little Englander: setting on celluloid a nation in which the upper middle-classes, after a series of comic misunderstandings, finally manage to blurt \"I love you\" on a snowy Christmas Eve while large numbers of Royal Shakespeare Company stalwarts drink mulled wine in the background.\n\nThe writer couldn't sue over that stereotype of his plots, but the insult is inaccurate. Little Englanders lock the doors and ignore abroad. Curtis's trick in his films has been to make the parochial global. He's a Big Englander: someone who, like Richard Branson, gambled that his personal values might be more widely shared.\n\nThe money and status Curtis has achieved in cinema - with Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill and now Love Actually - are unlikely for any Englishman in an American business, but even more so for an English writer. Cinema is a director's and actor's medium and, while Curtis has now gone behind the camera with Love Actually, his directing debut was made possible by the power he gained through his scripts.\n\nWhen his least-known movie, The Tall Guy, was re-released on DVD earlier this year, it was tagged with the ad-line: from the writer of Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill. The designers of DVD sleeves are normally asked to invent a specially tiny new type-size for the name of the writer.\n\nApart from his weakness for a Christmas-card England, the other main ammunition of Curtis detractors is a fondness for giving his characters astonishing reversals of fortune. But, in this, he could enter the defence of autobiography. What's astonishing about the Richard Curtis story is that, as recently as 1993, he was regarded as a minor English comedy writer. His most prestigious credit was the historical sitcom Blackadder but, even there, the first series, which he scripted alone, was widely considered inferior to the subsequent three, on which Ben Elton became co-dramatist.\n\nWith reviewers and producers tending to see Elton as the saviour of that series, Curtis's greatest cachet came as a sort of Geldof of comedy: creator of the BBC gags-for-famine telethon Comic Relief. At that stage, his most notable work as a solo writer had been Not the Nine O'Clock News, the BBC2 comedy series that began as a kind of Python for Thatcherism (like her, it started in 1979) and was certainly Pythonesque in its seeding of significant solo careers: Rowan Atkinson, Mel Smith, Griff Rhys Jones and Pamela Stephenson were the then unknowns who fronted it.\n\nNTNON used teams of writers but Curtis, who had come to the project as Atkinson's personal script man, contributed more sketches than anyone else, as well as the lyrics for the spoof songs that became such a feature of the series. He also became known for making unlikely material funny. A scrap of paper with the lines \"Rowan walks down the high street, sees himself in the video camera in a TV shop, makes a face at the window, then bumps into a lamppost\" turned out to be one of the show's most famous sketches.\n\nMany writers create a loose pool of talents from which they draw collaborators throughout their career, but Curtis's output is especially suitable to presentation as a diagram with overlapping circles and long, curly arrows. John Lloyd, the producer of NTNON, moved on to supervise Blackadder, initially written by Curtis for Rowan Atkinson, whom he had first known at Oxford. Lloyd had seen a version of Atkinson's Chaplinesque prat-faller Mr Bean in their earliest student theatrical revues. The character later featured in several television series, which were written by Curtis, who also scripted a late-90s Bean movie, directed by Mel Smith.\n\nCurtis also scripted Atkinson's later stage shows: a success in London but a notorious flop on Broadway. In two ways, though, that theatrical failure led to Curtis's movie career. A sketch in which Atkinson gave a speech as the father of the bride - lamenting his daughter's decision to take as her husband the more unpleasant of the two contenders - can clearly be seen as the sperm or egg of the Four Weddings script.\n\nBefore that, and after an aborted movie for Hollywood producers, there was The Tall Guy, Curtis's feature-film writing debut which, in 1989, added a new arrow to one of his existing talent diagrams - it was the movie-directing debut of Mel Smith from NTNON - and laid out the tramlines of another: it was produced for a company called Working Title by Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner, whose names would subsequently appear with Curtis's on the posters for three of the most profitable British movies ever made.\n\nThe Tall Guy, which had the misfortune to be patronised in one sense by critics while not patronised in the other by audiences, wasn't one of them. Yet, viewed again today, it shows the outlines of the future Curtis brand with surprising clarity. In a presumably cathartic brand of parody after what had happened to him on Broadway, Atkinson plays Ron Anderson, a mean and egomaniacal comedian with unusually flexible features whose stage show keeps being ruined by the sneezing fits of his American stooge, played by Jeff Goldblum.\n\nIn one of those romantic lightning strikes that Curtis seems to believe in as much as any figure in history apart from Cupid, Goldblum glances at the nurse giving him injections for allergies - Emma Thompson road-testing the ironic lilt that would become her own fortune - and knows in seconds that he wants to spend decades with her. What will become another Curtis trope - The Wacky But Wise Flat Mate - is here pioneered by Geraldine James as a nymphomaniac hippy.\n\nAlso present in this apprentice effort are the eccentric obscenities - \"What in the name of arse is going on?\" asks Anderson - and the willingness to sacrifice realism to a gag. When Goldblum and Thompson first have sex at her flat, it is an orgasmic marathon staged across bed, floor, piano walls and wardrobe. To show that he is in love, Goldblum turns cartwheels in front of a giant moon.\n\nOne aspect that, perhaps crucially, did not become a habit was a strand of savage contemporary satire. Sacked by Anderson, Goldblum's character wins the lead in a West End musical of The Elephant Man, a sparkily nasty send-up of Andrew Lloyd Webber in which the freak-show hero has a hit song called I'm Packing My Trunk.\n\nThe Tall Guy fell short at the box office and, by the next time Curtis had his name in cinematic credits, this streak of contemporary piss-taking had disappeared from his work. Perhaps this was coincidental but the writer and his producers may also have concluded that this remnant of the spirit of NTNON had harmed the film's commercial prospects. One reading of the subsequent romantic blockbusters is that Curtis, having come to mock Lloyd Webber, learned from him to sing along with public taste rather than in counterpoint to it.\n\nCertainly there seems at this time to have been a period of uncertainty about his direction. In a rare public appearance at the Hay-on-Wye literary festival - when it comes to interviews, Curtis, true to his surname, is curt - the writer revealed that he had spent several years trying to write a stage play about his parents' marriage: an odd project that suggests an author marking time.\n\nBut the long gap until the appearance, in 1994, of what initially looked like a minor Channel 4-funded Sloane romance may simply have been due to revision. It has often been said that the historical difference in the overall quality of British films and American movies is due to the fact that US scripts are rewritten while UK ones are merely written. Admittedly, in America, the later versions tend to be done by teams of news emergency writers. But Curtis has managed to combine the two systems: sitting alone, he spends days on a line, years on a draft.\n\nThere are various accounts of the genesis of Four Weddings. Apart from the germ of the old Atkinson wedding speech sketch, Curtis has said that he one day calculated that he had been to 72 weekend weddings of friends. He has also said that he wished to explain to his parents why he chose not to marry his girlfriend (now expecting their fourth child), Emma Freud.\n\nAnother unusual element in Curtis's working practices is that he likes to employ a close female friend as personal script doctor. Helen Fielding, later to open her own lucrative mine of English comedy with Bridget Jones, was credited as special script consultant on The Tall Guy. Freud is listed as script editor for the subsequent romantic comedies.\n\nCurtis has told questioners in Hay-on-Wye and elsewhere that Freud uses the codes NBG (No Bloody Good) and CDB (Could Do Better). Robert McKie hosts expensive weekend seminars on screenwriting: teaching his clients about A-plots and B-plots and on which page to introduce a secondary theme. The Curtis rules seem to be to set aside several years and allow your lover to tear your drafts apart.\n\nAn early reviewer described Four Weddings and a Funeral as a hard film to dislike, but one that isn't remotely true. If you wanted to raise a lynch-mob of serious movie critics, you would only have to point to the emetic sentimentality of giving the hero a brother who can only communicate in sign-language and the astonishing convenience of the plot twists that make the leading lady first unavailable to the hero and then available again moments later through one of the rapidest marriages and quickest divorces in the history of human relationships.\n\nFor a romantic comedy, the film also took serious risks with its leads. The chemistry of a rom-com is simple: at least half the audience should want to have sex with one of the above-the-title stars. But both Hugh Grant, as the spouse-avoiding Charles, and Andie McDowell, as the enigmatic American love interest who challenges his bachelorhood, are actors of the kind you either want to shag or strangle, a calculation decided by a mixture of your class background and tolerance of acting mannerisms.\n\nYet, no matter how cynically you go in, you are forced to admit that this was one of those mysterious moments when the gods of scriptwriting decide to smile on someone hunched over a typewriter. The cleverness of the title - the final word alerting the audience that the comedy will at one moment stop - plays off in the remarkable scenes that follow the fatal collapse of Simon Callow's Gareth.\n\nThe truth is that you could ask 100 screenwriters - Oscar winners, William Goldman, those twins who wrote Casablanca, Harold Pinter, the Coen Brothers - to write you Gareth's funeral and not one of them would have come up with the idea of his boyfriend reading out a speech from a forgotten play by WH Auden: lines, moreover, which were intended as a ridiculously over-the-top parody of a funeral eulogy, written for a dead politician.\n\nThe post-funeral scene that follows, in which the dippy toff Tom (James Fleet) discusses love and commitment with Grant's Charles, is just as skilfully scripted. Although Curtis clearly has wit, it can be argued that his greatest gift as a writer is agility. His plots can be regarded as a series of deep and potentially fatal holes that he digs for himself before somehow clambering out.\n\nMost English scriptwriters given a hit on the level of Four Weddings would disappear to Hollywood and crank out scripts of films that might join the long list of possible projects for Nicole or Russell or Jack. Curtis's reaction to his gold-find, though, was characteristically English. Four Weddings earned him a honeymoon of long holidays, sabbaticals to work on Comic Relief, and a television sitcom, The Vicar Of Dibley, for Dawn French, that again demonstrated this writer's unusual ability to combine the cutting edge - the issue of women priests in the C of E - with the cosy: Oxfordshire countryside, daffy Sloanes, ceremonies involving the blessing of farm animals.\n\nThere was also the slow progress towards another movie which, by 1999, was Notting Hill. Curtis's Big Englander complex - the belief that the concerns of a small island can concern the world - was shown by his decision to set this film in the streets outside his west London home and office. Grant, who Curtis had now made a big star, again played a single man - bad at commitment and finishing sentences - who falls in love with America's biggest film star when, true to the rules of the Curtis universe, she happens to drop in to his Notting Hill bookshop.\n\nIn a British film of the 70s or 80s, America's biggest film star would have been played by an English sitcom actress after two days with an American dialogue coach. But, demonstrating what Four Weddings had started for Working Title and Curtis, she was played, in a swaggering piece of typecasting, by Julia Roberts.\n\nAfter Notting Hill, Curtis did some polishing of a script - on which his old friend Helen Fielding and Andrew Davies had worked - for Bridget Jones's Diary, which (more arrows and overlapping circles on the diagram) also involved Grant, Bevan and Fellner. Then, after years of abandoning the sections that Ms Freud considered not bloody good enough or that could have been done better, came Love Actually.\n\nAs much of the population will already know from the months of multiplex trailers, free DVD tasters and chatshow actors, Love Actually is a portmanteau romance involving nine love stories. Passion surprises characters as diverse as Hugh Grant as a bachelor prime minister falling for his tea-lady, Martine McCutcheon, and a little boy whose mother has just died consulting his stepdad on how to deal with his crush for the cool girl at school.\n\nMost successful populist artists have discovered a formula and a fat dossier of coincidences can be accumulated after spending a weekend with the movies Curtis has written. Sudden, overwhelming love at first sight occurs in The Tall Guy, Four Weddings, Notting Hill, Love Actually and Bridget Jones's Diary. All five end with a desperate dash against time to make the declaration or save the relationship. In both Bridget Jones's Diary and Love Actually, the climactic declarations of desire take place on Christmas Eve. Barmy but warm-hearted housemates figure in The Tall Guy, Four Weddings and Notting Hill.\n\nIntriguingly, for the first time since The Tall Guy, there is some satire in the plot strand featuring Bill Nighy as a raddled rock star aiming for a Christmas No 1, although now the satire comes with a Lloyd Webber twist because Nighy's spin-off single is currently among the favourites to top the actual yuletide charts.\n\nIf the writer - now writer-director's - detractors are right that his movies cannily construct an England for Americans, then the strategy has failed this time. Love Actually received a very rude review in the New York Times and cold notices in other US publications. Curtis has left himself the excuse that this may be due to a speech in which PM Grant urges Britain to stand up for itself against the States, but it seems less likely that critics were irritated by this innovation of tone than by the familiarities of much of the plot and dialogue.\n\nIt is a measure of how powerful the Curtis brand of cinema is that, like the cars of Ford or the chocolate of Cadbury, it has an existence independent of its inventor. Working Title has a parallel business in films - Hugh Grant's About a Boy, Rowan Atkinson's Johnny English - which feel as though they should have been written by Curtis, but weren't. And the actors continue to play in those films characters that they perfected in the ones they made with him.\n\nBrands, though, can become too familiar. To borrow the Freudian code, Love Actually certainly isn't NBG. But it does frequently feel CDB. The weaknesses come from what has always been, though admittedly for movie critics rather than audiences, the Richard Curtis Problem: his curious attitude to reality.\n\nAs with many artistic characteristics, this may have its roots in childhood. The son of a Unilever executive, he grew up in New Zealand, Manila and Stockholm, among other places dictated by dad's postings. And the England of Curtis films - in which snow always falls on Christmas Eve on beautiful mews houses or glow-windowed mansions - is recognisably a fantasy of expats.\n\nMore dangerously, Curtis films also move between reality and convenience in the area of psychology. Notting Hill, for example, contains one of the bleakest and most realistic depictions of celebrity when Julia Roberts cowers behind the door of Grant's house, with the sounds of the media scrum outside drifting through. Yet the plot later requires her to behave at a press conference as no privacy-obsessed Hollywood diva ever would.\n\nThe world of Love Actually is similarly inconsistent. It begins with an explicit reference to 9/11 as Grant's prime minister makes a speech in which he criticises those who say that the world is a vicious and cynical place. He points out that the message that the people in those doomed towers and on those aimed planes called out on telephones with their dying breath was: I love you. From this, the politician concludes, neatly setting up the title, \"love actually does make the world go round\".\n\nEven on its own, this is a dangerous manoeuvre, inviting the accusation that Curtis is calling in Osama bin Laden's signature atrocity to justify the upbeat tone of his movies. But the tactic is further complicated by what follows. In what is, by inference, the same level of jeopardy suffered by Tony Blair since 9/11, Curtis's premier is able to dash around London with a single bobby as protection. And the film concludes at Heathrow - a location that al-Qaida has made problematic for gentle comedies but which Curtis uses for a sequence of young scamps ducking under barriers pursued by jobsworths shouting, \"Oi, you!\" The film-maker seems to be moving between pre- and post-9/11 moods purely as it suits him.\n\nLove Actually, however, provides evidence for the defence as well as the prosecution. Curtis is often accused of cosiness and sentimentality and, while even OJ Simpson's lawyer couldn't keep him out of jail on those, his softness takes a complicated shape. It is a surprise to note that, of the movies he has written, only Bean can legally be seen by children: the censors have generally given him a 15 certificate.\n\nThis is partly because British movie watchdogs are generally stricter on loose tongues than flying fists and Curtis shows a continued delight - very English public school, to his critics - in swearing. Apart from the \"fuck\" fusillade that begins most sections of Four Weddings, Grant also gets to yell seven \"buggers\" in succession in the vestry. The attraction of bad language continues in Love Actually, in which the inappropriate oaths go to a 10-year-old boy.\n\nBut, even if the higher certificates are imposed as a sort of swear box, they are correct because, under all the snow and romance, there is a darkness in Curtis's work that keeps trying to peep through. The dumping of \"Duck face\" at the altar in Four Weddings is a scene of such remarkable cruelty that only the tactical use of the cute mute brother as the captain of the action - another example of Curtis climbing out of a seemingly hopeless hole - can hold the film within its chosen genre of romantic comedy.\n\nThere is also something very grown-up in the structure of the films. Curtis has little obviously in common with Quentin Tarantino - Reservoir Dogs and Bridget Jones's Diary are unlikely ever to be packaged together as a video-store two-fer - but these two film-makers can be seen as the great structuralists of modern cinema. Four Weddings and Pulp Fiction both break movie narrative down into chapters and apparently unlinked sections: a literary parallel taken even further in Love Actually and Kill Bill, their most recent work.\n\nCurtis has hinted that he is through with floppy-haired Englishmen finding commitment at the eleventh hour: Love Actually alarmingly includes no less than three such hopeless blokes. His next film, he has said, may be about \"a social issue\", although he may reflect on the fact that his old friend and collaborator Helen Fielding has had bruising reviews after changing genre in her latest novel. And the fans of Annie Hall and Manhattan wouldn't follow Woody Allen to his Bergmanesque experiments such as Shadows and Fog.\n\nA Bergmanesque Curtis is hard to imagine, but it seems clear that one of the most unlikely and lucrative strains of work in cinema - a rare example of lightning striking the British film industry - is coming to an end. The latest instalment leaves you feeling that, in the end, love actually isn't all that cinema is about."
