        "text": "Wet Hot American Summer was originally a 2001 film starring a host of mostly unknown actors. It documents the final day at a fictional summer camp, spoofing sex comedies such as\n\nAmerican Pie and Porky's. The reviews were bad -\n\nRoger Ebert gave it one star (he even wrote a poem) - and the film barely registered. Over the years the film built up a cult following on DVD. Meanwhile its cast went on to become some of the most celebrated names in Hollywood. (The latter occurrence certainly helped the former, but not exclusively.)\n\nNow WHAS is back as an eight-episode Netflix series entitled: Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp. The series is a prequel to the final day of camp shown in the film.\n\nRemarkably, all the cast of the film has returned despite the fact one is a multiple Oscar nominee, another is currently headlining the latest Marvel film, and a third is the darling of American comedy and Saturday Night Live powerhouse. Moreover a whole new batch of famous faces have come onboard for the ride.\n\nKeeping track of such a rollcall of stardom can be tricky. This cut-out-and-keep guide should help.\n\nMain Cast\n\nPaul Rudd is Andy\n\nRudd ditches his \"nice-guy\" persona to play the bad-boy - and the shoe certainly fits. Like Henry Fonda in Once Upon a Time in the West, Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight, and Leonardo Di Caprio in Django Unchained, the formerly clean-cut star relishes his new look. Dim lifeguard Andy rides a motorbike and seduces the ladies with his special brand of charm. Just don't ask why so many campers disappear swimming in the lake.\n\nSample quote: \"You taste like a burger. I don't like you anymore.\"\n\nElizabeth Banks is Lindsey\n\nIn the original film, Lindsey is a hot camp counsellor and Andy's girlfriend. In the TV series we discover she's an undercover journalist from Rock & Roll World magazine.\n\nHer brief? To discover and live the true teenage experience for her latest article. This includes making out with Andy the lifeguard during swim time.\n\nSample quote: (on being told \"you French great\") \"You're not so bad yourself, Mr. Man.\"\n\nBradley Cooper is Ben\n\nBen's sexual awakening is one of the arcs of the TV show. In the first episode the clean-cut Ben is in a relationship with counsellor Susie. However his attraction to the secretly gay counsellor McKinley builds over the season, finally erupting in a steamy, pre-talent show clinch.\n\nSample quote: \"Hey, let's all promise that in ten years from today, we'll meet again, and we'll see what kind of people we've blossomed into.\"\n\nAmy Poehler is Susie\n\nCounsellor Susis was a breakout role for Poehler, who quickly joined Saturday Night Live. Susie is cheerful but iron-willed, determined to put on the best talent show of all time.\n\nFun is great, provided it's organised. Imagine a teenage Margaret Thatcher on uppers and you're halfway there."
