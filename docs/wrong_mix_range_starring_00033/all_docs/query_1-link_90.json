        "text": "Next March will mark 25 years since the iconic British rom-com Four Weddings and a Funeral was released, and to celebrate, the cast and creators are reuniting for a short film sequel in support of the annual Red Nose Day charity telethon.\n\nThe short, titled One Red Nose Day and a Wedding, will pick up 25 years after the original film. As hinted in the title, there will indeed be a wedding.\n\n“We’re all definitely older — I suspect no wiser,” the film’s writer and Red Nose Day co-founder, Richard Curtis, said in a statement. “It’s been really enjoyable working out what’s happened to all the characters — and now they get back together for the fifth wedding. Where, as usual, not everything will go as planned.”\n\nOriginal stars Hugh Grant, Andie MacDowell, Kristin Scott Thomas, and Rowan Atkinson are confirmed to appear, as are John Hannah, James Fleet, David Haig, Sophie Thompson, David Bower, Robin McCaffrey, Anna Chancellor, Rupert Vansittart, Simon Kunz, Sara Crowe, and Timothy Walker. More special guests are also said to be set to join the cast. Original director Mike Newell will helm the follow-up.\n\nThe annual Red Nose Day telethon is a comedy fundraiser run by the UK charity Comic Relief to support initiatives that work to end child poverty. In 2017, the show featured a Love Actually sequel that reunited Hugh Grant, Martine McCutcheon, Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley, Colin Firth, Andrew Lincoln, and more.\n\nThe Four Weddings and a Funeral sequel will premiere in the UK on BBC1 on March 15, 2019, and in the US on NBC in May.\n\nWhat do you hope to see in a Four Weddings sequel?
