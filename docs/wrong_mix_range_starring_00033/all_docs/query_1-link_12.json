        "text": "“Stay on target!” urges Sheila, my CycleFit instructor, sweat pouring down her face. “Stay on target! Just like in Star Wars,” she shouts over the music, as we pant up an imaginary hill on our stationary bikes. There is no confusion among the members of my YMCA. As we collectively sweat through our Monday lunchtime workout, everyone understands the reference. We are a set of determined Y-wing pilots, trying to maneuver toward the Death Star reactor-port in a 46-year-old science-fiction film. We will not swerve off course.\n\nFilm references are everywhere. They’re part of how we experience life, vibrant threads running through our social fabric, connecting us to a shared cultural history and weaving us more tightly together. Films have been making reference—whether explicitly or subtly—to other films since the beginning of the artform. From the silent era to the densely self-referential worlds of latter-day superheroes and the new crop of Canadian cinema in theaters this year, the ways films reference each other can be complex or clear-cut, deep or as dumb as Joe Dirt.\n\nBut what’s in a reference? When a film references another work, is it commenting on that other moment? And if so, is it doing so positively, negatively, or is it merely reproducing it? Is the reference in conversation with that moment, translating it, or twisting it into some new shape? Does the reference align the work with its predecessor, seeking some depth or levity by association? Or is it simply an echo? What’s the value in a reference—and why is it so often funny?\n\nAs a child in the ’80s and ’90s, I grew up watching an array of slapstick and spoof-laden films. Available on cable in seemingly endless marathons were the Police Academy movies, the Naked Guns, the Ernests, the Hot Shots. Also in constant rotation in my household were Airplane!, Wayne’s World, Young Frankenstein, Robin Hood: Men in Tights, Spaceballs, Blazing Saddles, and The Blues Brothers. Bugs Bunny could be heard crunching carrots and sassing everyone at all hours. My sister and I would imitate his screwball mannerisms, having no idea they were cribbed from Clark Gable’s character in It Happened One Night. We wore tight tights; we asked “What hump?”; we yelled “Telegram for Mongo!”. The Simpsons’ ‘Rosebud’ and ‘Cape Feare’ episodes were gospel to us, despite the film references flying over our heads like beautiful, soaring pigs—just a little airborne, but still good.\n\nSlowly, like so many invisible electromagnetic waves, a realization rolled over me. These characters and remarks which I recognized as jokes but which landed either with an unremarkable thud or with the baffling glee of non sequitur were actually references. Everything I watched was in conversation with something I had yet to encounter. The notion that every screen experience was born from some previous art was humbling. It was also inspiring, motivating me to learn more about TV and film history.\n\nNot much makes sense to Steve Rogers aka Captain America, newly resurrected from a state of suspended animation, but Fury’s reference to The Wizard of Oz? That, he gets. The fictional Steve Rogers would have been 21 when the Wicked Witch of the West and her blue-tinged minions flew on to American screens in 1939. The timeline works and so does the line, reinforcing Cap and Thor’s characters as fish out of water while injecting a bit of humor—as well as giving Cap a much-needed win among his new colleagues.\n\nThis is comedy for consumers, a reference for audiences who obsess over film and popular culture to nod along with. In order to get the flying monkey line, you have to know where the winged beasts come from. Unlike run-of-the-mill mockery or jokes obviously written to suit a specific turn of events, a reference only requires previous knowledge to function and to be enjoyed.\n\nWhen executed well, a film reference is cultural shorthand. It’s a way to cut through the noise and point to something that’s already been articulated. The reference is satisfying to understand in itself, scratching that innate itch to recognize the self in the other, but it moves into proper joke territory via the successive lines of dialogue. Something new is created. Thor is mystified; Cap is happy to finally understand something. It rings a bell in Cap and in viewers. We are Cap; Cap is us.\n\nIn the Nora and Delia Ephron-penned film You’ve Got Mail, Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) hits the nail on the head when he says, “The Godfather is the answer to any question.” If you know The Godfather well, there’s a bit of dialogue to suit any occasion. You know what it means if someone sleeps with the fishes, if an offer is made that can’t be refused, if it’s time to go to the mattresses. Films like The Godfather, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Citizen Kane or Gone with the Wind are so widely seen and referenced that they function as conversational shortcuts; not just in film, but in culture generally. These references have become so popular that they’re often understood even by people who haven’t seen the movies. Frankly, Rosebud, I don’t give a damn if you leave the gun and take the cannoli.\n\nOf course, You’ve Got Mail is itself one long reference; it’s a remake of the 1940 Ernst Lubitsch film The Shop Around the Corner (based on a play by Miklós László). When Joe Fox makes film references, it gives depth to his personality, shedding light on his character as someone who understands modern culture in a way that Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) does not, underlining the central themes of the film. She’s “shopgirl,” a nod to the Lubitsch film, mired in the past, re-reading Pride and Prejudice, while Fox is “NY152,” a man of New York City, a tall decaf cappuccino, bustling into the future.\n\n“Doug is thinking that the film reference is going to create common ground only to show just how different these two characters’ worlds are,” Johnson tells me. “Nothing says ‘Doug throwing a guy a bone’ like mentioning the most popular movie in the entire world. Doug knows every movie, but he’ll mention this stupid movie that everybody knows to connect with Jim and Jim is like, ‘I haven’t seen it.’ Doug is like, ‘This isn’t gonna work. I have no idea who this person is.’”\n\nHere, the film reference is used to highlight the cultural chasm between the characters. “All the film references are things that, to me, help describe the sense of justice and morality and good-versus-evil that Doug stands for,” Johnson explains. As far as Doug is concerned, he is John Nada (Roddy Piper) in They Live and he can see Jim Balsillie for who he is: the alien who’s come to destroy them.\n\nJohnson and Miller are walking in the footsteps of other great Canadian comedy filmmakers, including writer-actor Mike Myers and director Penelope Spheeris, responsible for arguably the best collection of pop culture meta moments ever to grace the silver screen. It’s on the shoulders of ’90s-defining consumer comedy Wayne’s World (co-written with Bonnie and Terry Turner) that BlackBerry stands. Both films follow an upstart duo approached by an industry-savvy player who convinces them to take their product to the next level.\n\nEach film features a scene in which the sidekick expresses grave doubts about the deep-pocketed third wheel. “Benjamin is no one’s friend,” says Garth (Dana Carvey) in Wayne’s World, talking about the TV producer (Rob Lowe) bringing investors to their small-time cable-access show. “If Benjamin were an ice cream flavor, he’d be pralines and dick.” Likewise in BlackBerry, Doug voices his concerns about the partnership at hand. “That guy is sketchy,” he says about Jim, the businessman sidling in to become co-CEO of their company. “The guy’s a shark.” Both films are laden with pop-culture winks which help flesh out the stories’ milieux.\n\nWriting the script for BlackBerry, Miller and Johnson wanted to depict an atmosphere where science-fiction movies, TV series, and video games inspired the team behind the smartphone. The office is a heightened space, a clubhouse in which a generation of computer engineers and tech innovators could bounce around and revel in their appreciation for Star Trek, Indiana Jones, John Carpenter films or even “something seemingly as benign and childish as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” says Johnson. “A movie about fraternity and camaraderie between turtles who learn jiu-jitsu to fight for justice—that is related to what I think Doug thinks they are doing.”\n\nCharacters wear t-shirts emblazoned with iconography relating to Star Trek, The Thing and They Live. Office walls are peppered with posters for The Wizard of Oz, Total Recall, Westworld, Shivers, The Mask, Point Break, Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!, Army of Darkness, Top Gun, Serpico, An American Werewolf in London, The Goonies, The Monster Squad, Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure, and Ernest Goes to Camp.\n\n“I wanted to pay tribute to the media-saturated engineering nerd culture of the ’80s and ’90s that led to all of the technological innovation that occurred in the late ’90s, early 2000,” says Johnson. On one level BlackBerry is about the characters’ journeys and the myth associated with pioneering smartphone technology. But on another, it’s about the importance of science fiction in inspiring a generation of computer engineers. “I don’t think that science fiction gets the credit that it deserves, for, in some ways, creating the future,” Johnson adds.\n\nAt one point, however, the film was becoming overburdened with references. Its runtime sits just below the two-hour mark but there were many more references the team wanted to include. “Ultimately it is not a movie about movies,” Johnson says. “It’s a movie about a smartphone.”\n\nFor director Chandler Levack, whose debut feature I Like Movies premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2022 and released theatrically in March (now on VOD in Canada and the global film festival circuit; a US release still pending), movie references represent the worldview of a character and act as the thrust of a film. In the beige suburbs of Burlington, Ontario, teen film snob Lawrence Kweller (Isaiah Lehtinen) dreams of attending NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts and becoming a director. “Movies are my entire life,” he says plainly. “I need to watch movies like I need to breathe air.”\n\nIt’s an obsession that Levack echoes when recounting her own teen years spent working in a video store in Burlington. “Walking around the suburbs when I was in high school, so obsessed with film, I had to romanticize where I was from. I would pretend I was in a movie,” she recalls. She would imagine herself in a Paul Thomas Anderson movie, drifting through the Burlington Mall listening to Jon Brion, or in a Wes Anderson film, dramatically alighting from a bus to Nico’s ‘These Days’. Levack wonders if most people who want to make films are yearning for a more elevated experience of life. “Maybe that’s why we imprinted on cinema so much. It was a way to feel our feelings safely or read ourselves into being the main character. Movies, in a certain way, legitimize narcissism.”\n\nThe references in I Like Movies are partly autobiographical, based on movies that left a strong impression on Levack during her high school years. There’s a scene in which Lawrence approaches a couple perusing DVDs in Sequels, his video rental store, and—despite not being an employee—recommends Todd Solondz’s black comedy Happiness. It’s a window into his soul. Happiness is a comedy about a pedophile, a challenging film Roger Ebert said was “not a film for most people.” So if you get the reference, you know: Lawrence can see only himself, only what he finds interesting.\n\nWhen Lawrence is leaving Sequels and trying to decide on the one rental DVD he’s allowed to take home, he sighs and finally throws one to the side. The camera lingers so we can catch the visual gag: it’s the 1982 drama Sophie’s Choice, about an Auschwitz survivor who was forced to make a heartbreaking decision.\n\nA recurring reference in I Like Movies is to Paul Thomas Anderson’s Punch Drunk Love, which Lawrence insists he has to see in the theater and then purchase on DVD. “I’d never seen a movie like that before and I was utterly obsessed with it,” says Levack. A couple of Stanley Kubrick films get referenced, too. After Lawrence finally finagles a job at Sequels, he watches the dark war drama Full Metal Jacket in the back room while eating a sandwich. In another scene, he’s nearly caught masturbating while gladiator epic Spartacus plays on the living room television. ”When you watch those first Kubrick movies as a high school student, they’re just revolutionary,” says Levack. “There’s something about the way that Kubrick composes shots that his movies feel so intense.”\n\nAlice Wu’s The Half of It, and Do Revenge, directed by Jennifer Kaytin Robinson and written by Robinson and Celeste Ballard, are a veritable parade of references. The Half of It puts a modern spin on the 1897 play Cyrano de Bergerac, with a queer twist and a feast of literary and film nods. Ellie Chu (Leah Lewis) is erudite and hard-working, doing her classmates’ homework for a fee, with aspirations beyond her small town. Soon, she’s penning love letters to the charming and charismatic Aster (Alexxis Lemire) on behalf of verbally challenged athlete Paul (Daniel Diemer), training him in Jean-Paul Sartre and Wim Wenders, and catching feelings along the way.\n\nEllie’s father Edwin (Collin Chou) is a dispirited widower and railroad engineer who spends his days watching classic movies—his late wife’s favorites: City Lights, His Girl Friday, The Philadelphia Story, and Casablanca, all of which echo the film’s three-pronged character structure. “They all have triangles in them,” says Wu, discussing her film on Netflix’s short-lived Watching With… podcast.\n\nAlso referenced are Wings of Desire and The Remains of the Day, speaking to the yearning Ellie feels and then slowly releases as she learns to express herself. Even Ellie’s father emerges from his despair, as sharing film experiences and cultural knowledge brings the pair closer and more fully into themselves. The references offer a bridge, both between on-screen characters and between film and audience.\n\nDo Revenge, meanwhile, weaves ’90s nostalgia into sharp neo-noir, blending the vengeance scheme of Alfred Hitchcock’s Strangers on a Train with the pop trappings of Amy Heckerling’s Clueless. In the film, toppled queen bee Drea (Camila Mendes), whose nudes have been leaked, pairs up with newcomer Eleanor (Maya Hawke), the victim of a malicious rumor, to wreak hell on their tormentors. “That was one of the most metatextual films I’ve ever seen,” says Levack. “Like somebody watched every teen comedy from the late ’90s and just put them all in.”\n\nWhen the aloof Gabbi (Talia Ryder) dryly asks Eleanor if she’d like a tour of the school, Eleanor says, “As a disciple of the ’90s teen movie, I’d be offended if I didn’t get one.” In this one line, Robinson and Ballard make their debt and their intentions explicit. From plot points, characters and the mighty, mighty soundtrack to the flamboyant fashions and the name of a building (Horowitz Hall!), Do Revenge’s strongest reference is unmistakably Clueless. The rest is a full-tilt joyride through ’90s teen film history—so get in loser, we’re going reference shopping.\n\nAdam Nayman, film critic and author of Paul Thomas Anderson: Masterworks, uses scenes from various animated TV series to illuminate reference styles. “When I teach satire at Toronto Metropolitan University, I use the example that The Simpsons will satirize a movie and Family Guy will copy it,” he says. “Both are funny, because in the case of Family Guy what’s funny is the absolute granular, bone-deep similarity of what they animate to the movie. Or in South Park, another example, when they reproduced the six-minute fist-fight from They Live, that’s really funny. And it’s an unmistakable reference. I don’t know what it says about the movie, other than that they’ve seen it and we’ve seen it, which is not nothing.”\n\nIndeed, it’s not nothing. The recognition of the reference is the heart of the matter; the connection established between viewer, art, and history is a line traced through time and space, from one consciousness to another.\n\nReferences within movies inspired a childhood fascination and curiosity in Nayman, too. “Pulp Fiction was one of those movies I experienced where I actually knew everything was a reference, but I did not know to what,” he says. The 1994 film, written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, references movies like the 1903 short The Great Train Robbery, It’s A Wonderful Life, Kiss Me Deadly, Shaft and about 150 others, give or take. Nayman calls Tarantino’s directorial style “the ultimate manifestation of Revenge of the Nerds,” the notion being that packing a film with references is what gives it—and its creators, by association—clout. It’s cool by curation. The more esoteric, the better. “Pulp Fiction is pointing at a bunch of references that you probably only had if you’re a super loser, but it’s cool. If you are not at the party, you are the party now.” But it still made him curious to understand the references. As with me, the bait worked. “He did it, as embarrassing as it is,” laughs Nayman. Hook, line and sinker.\n\nBut whose work is being referenced? By virtue of its function, a reference is an assertion of importance or ubiquity. It is built on the assumption, or at least the hope, of a viewership in possession of shared knowledge, of a cultural awareness or notions of historical notability. The shorthand only works if both ends of the circuit connect. So whose work is deemed remarkable and worthy of remembrance, of parody and aggrandizement? Whose work is deemed fit for the library of material from which seedlings of new films are planted, from which references are made?\n\nWe know by now that “the canon” in film is a problem. We know that any artform dominated by a cis male white heterosexual narrative is an unjust reflection of its society. Filmmaking and film criticism has been dominated by these narratives for so long that it should be unsurprising to note that when references appear in films, they are often nodding in the same directions. “If it’s male creators celebrating male creators, and they celebrate the most ‘visionary’ ones, their references to camera movements and compositions that are very striking become kind of samey,” says Nayman. “It is interesting to test the degree to which the hierarchies of these things and the obsessiveness of these things is gendered.”\n\nOne of the most referenced films of all time is Stanley Kubrick’s 1968 “ultimate trip” film 2001: A Space Odyssey. “Everything about the graphic and visual design and choreography of 2001 has become so embedded in science fiction that it goes beyond reference—it’s just DNA,” says Nayman. “If I were to count the number of times on TV shows and movies that one movie has been referenced—almost always with that mix of affection or awe or deference—it is probably 2001. Almost immediately, you could feel it entering into the visual language of so many directors.”\n\nThe send-up of 2001’s stargate sequence in Mel Brooks’s 1987 laugh-a-minute Spaceballs (“They’ve gone to plaid!”) contains both visual and spoken cues. At the time that might have seemed to indicate the film’s peak as pop culture fodder. Not so. The film’s IMDb “Connections” page lists more than 1200 references, more than 200 features, and more than 200 spoofs in other works, with those numbers rising every year.\n\nDigging further into Spaceballs, whose work did Brooks and writers Thomas Meehan and Ronny Graham consider significant enough in the late 1980s to lampoon? As with most films, and certainly most sci-fi, the works that are referenced—the original Star Wars trilogy, Star Trek, The Wizard of Oz, Alien, Planet of the Apes, and The Transformers: The Movie—were directed by men. It’s as solid a representative as any for reference-making throughout the wide, wide world o’ cinema.\n\nThese are shot-for-shot remakes of scenes in The Meetings of Anna, meticulously timed and choreographed, aligning the characters of composer Lydia Tár and filmmaker Anne Silver—their haunted affect, loneliness, and detachment brought into sharp relief. The symmetrical shot design rewards Akerman-versed viewers with an Easter egg, but it also affirms and acknowledges her as a notable, essential artist. An artist Field has deemed worthy of cribbing from and aligning with his own creation.\n\nAlong with these odes to Akerman, TÁR’s visual influences include films by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Apichatpong Weerasethakul and, naturally, Stanley Kubrick (who was a mentor to Field in the ’90s). The film also explicitly references “a Marlon Brando movie” (Apocalypse Now) and the consequences of megalomania, and Italian director Luchino Visconti, whose 1971 film Death in Venice treads similar territory and also features composer Gustav Mahler’s ‘Symphony No. 5’.\n\n“I just watched The Meetings of Anna,” says Levack, when I call her about this essay. She’s in Buenos Aires where she has been showing her film at a festival. “It’s literally about a single female filmmaker in her late thirties sitting alone in depressing hotel rooms on a film festival tour. It really shook me to my core.” While I Like Movies has taken her to various far-flung locations, Levack has been fielding many of the same questions over and over, making her examine her motivations, influences and references. “If I had found out about Elaine May in university, I think I would have been a completely different person,” she says. “Why am I not referencing The Heartbreak Kid or Ishtar in my work? I guess I’m trying to reconsider that now. I feel like I’m re-evaluating my whole education in film, which was very white, male canon-dominated.”\n\nIn 2022, Jeanne Dielman was named the greatest film of all time in the Sight and Sound critics’ poll. It’s the first time a film directed by a woman has made it into the top ten, let alone topped the list, since the poll was started in 1952. “Such a sudden shake-up,” writes feminist film theorist Laura Mulvey, reflecting on the poll. Thanks to the #MeToo movement and a larger awareness of misogynistic modes of production, the film industry has seen a great many cultural shifts in the last two decades. “It would be gratifying to think that the triumph of Jeanne Dielman in the poll gives an affirmation to these shifts in consciousness,” writes Mulvey. The directors’ poll, on the other hand, chosen by 480 of the world’s leading filmmakers, paints a different picture: Jeanne Dielman sits at number four while the top spot goes to the enduring 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\n“Works by women or people of color don’t usually find their way into the mainstream lexicon,” says Levack. “When we’re thinking about the female filmmakers being referenced, it’s often only by other women. I don’t see a lot of direct referential name-dropping of female filmmakers into texts.” She notes that Do Revenge pays homage to Clueless, which was directed by Amy Heckerling, but laments the fact that generally the pickings are quite slim. “Clueless is a masterpiece,” she says. “Everyone should be referencing it all the time.”\n\nIf we’ve all got our eye on the same few pictures in the rearview, how do we get somewhere new? It’s past time for a reimagining of what we consider to be “the canon”, but it’s also time to fold that into our practices—whether as viewers, critics or as creators of cinematic works. After all, it’s the 21st century. The sequel to 2001 has come and gone. Like Cheryl Dunye says in the epilogue of her 1996 film The Watermelon Woman, “Sometimes you have to create your own history.”\n\nIf we were to define a set of new classics—without using that notorious minimizer, “cult”—what would be among them? Perhaps it’s time for Clueless to enter the lexicon. Daisies, The Meetings of Anna, Wayne’s World, The Watermelon Woman. Urges to demonstrate one’s cultural prowess, to pay homage, or simply to flex are going nowhere. Likewise, the desire to recognize the self in the other, to dig into art with the intensity of a truffle pig in a ripe grove, will always be satisfying. The menu, however, could be updated.\n\nSeeing this, a bell rang somewhere deep in my memory. Didn’t Wayne’s World, a film I’d watched countless times in my youth, end in eerily similar fashion? In the “mega-happy ending”, TV producer Russell professes his appreciation for camera operator Terry, then breaks the fourth wall and says, “I’ve learned that platonic love can exist between two grown men.” Benjamin comes into frame next, saying, “And I’ve learned something, too. I’ve learned that a flawless profile, a perfect body, the right clothes, and a great car can get you far in America, almost to the top, but it can’t get you everything.” Could it be? Was the ending of Wayne’s World a reference to the end of Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? The question at the heart of both films is one of maintaining integrity in the face of selling out, and Wayne’s World could just as easily have been named Will Success Spoil Wayne Campbell.\n\nWhen I called her, Wayne’s World director Spheeris told me she isn’t sure if her film cribs from Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?—more likely it’s a reference to Broadway shows. It also no doubt nods to Saturday Night Live, where the Myers-created characters gained popularity, and the show’s traditional closers, in which the cast bids the audience farewell and celebrates en masse. Myers and Bonnie and Terry Turner, famously, rarely talk to anyone, so their points of view remain a mystery—but the films’ parallel themes, the cast standing in a row and the dialogue symmetry all seem too similar to deny. How marvellous that a cherished film, worn to bits in its VHS shell, can still, decades down the line, offer itself up to new insights. This is what art has to give. The sweetest plum.\n\nWhen I dutifully return to my CycleFit class the following Monday, primed to tilt at the windmills of my mind, there is an instructor I’ve never seen before. He has an entirely different teaching style and his own playlist which includes, bizarrely, songs from Disney films. Suddenly I am thrust back into the technicolor sands of the savanna, subject to the voices of American actor and singer Jason Weaver playing a young Simba, and Rowan Atkinson as Zazu the blustering bird. It is the 1994 animated film The Lion King, hyena-heckling us all from the vault. “Every time you hear ‘I just can’t wait to be king,’” yells the instructor, “You sprint!” I laugh, but I sprint. When that high-pitched child’s voice sings that refrain, I sprint, my chest heaving, my legs screaming through endless pedal loops.\n\nI think of the simultaneous tedium and joy of references, forever twirling in the ether, coming back in an undying ring of return. I think of Zarathustra. “All things are entangled, ensnared, enamored,” he says in the fourth part of the novel by Friedrich Nietzsche. “If you ever wanted one thing twice, if you ever said, ‘You please me, happiness! Abide, moment!’ then you wanted all back … For all joy wants—eternity.” The circle of life."
