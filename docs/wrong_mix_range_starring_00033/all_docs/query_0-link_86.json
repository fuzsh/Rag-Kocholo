        "text": "Starting with an avalanche of openings on December 1, we're in for an intriguing December\n\nMovie studios love December because we seem to have more time to actually go to the movies as the holiday season approaches. But this December 1 is something just a little crazy, with a handful of big movies opening on the same day.\n\nIn what amounts to a December 1 Battle Royale on the big screen, we've got Beyoncé up against Godzilla, an Oscar buzz-worthy Emma Stone performance, and an ensemble of stars (including Austin Butler, Tom Hardy, and Jodie Comer) riding motorcycles.\n\nAnd just as we catch our breath, we get a musical (Waitress), another great animated film from Hayao Miyazaki (The Boy and the Heron), and the very 2023 Wonka, a retelling of the classic with Timothée Chalamet in the lead role.\n\nMeanwhile on the streaming front, Bradley Cooper's latest (Maestro) arrives, along with a couple of intriguing animated releases (Diary of a Wimpy Kid Christmas: Cabin Fever Movie, Merry Little Batman), and Eva Longoria starring in the latest version of Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day.\n\nHere's a look at some of the more anticipated new releases, in cinemas and via streaming, along with a few tantalizing sports events to add to your holiday season mix.\n\nAnd as you queue up your watch list, don't forget our energy efficiency tips, from power smart settings for your TV to small appliance recipes that make for delicious movie snacks.\n\nIn theatres\n\nTeddy's Christmas (December 1)\n\nLet's get cute. Little girl spots an adorable teddy bear in a Christmas market, and watches it move its head and sneeze. Seasonal family fun from Norway.\n\nGodzilla Minus One (December 1)\n\nLet's get monstrous. The early reviews say this could be the best Godzilla since the 1954 original. Sounds like a blast, from Japan.\n\nSaltburn (December 1)\n\nLet's do black comedy. Oxford student gets an invitation to a friend's family estate. Then things get interesting. From Emerald Fennell, director of Promising Young Woman.\n\nThe Shift (December 1)\n\nLet's do the Book of Job. A modern-day, sci-fi retelling of the story.\n\nRenaissance: A Film by Beyoncé (December 1)\n\nLet's celebrate Queen Bey. One hundred fifty minutes from Beyoncé's world tour.\n\nThe Bikeriders (December 1)\n\nLet's do bike club. A flashback to 1960s motorcycle culture, with star turns from Jodie Comer, Austin Butler, and Tom Hardy.\n\nThe Sweet East (December 1)\n\nLet's get outrageous. Separated from a high school class trip, a teenage girl (Talia Ryder, from Never Rarely Sometimes Always) embarks on a nightmarish (and at times funny) odyssey through America.\n\nWaitress: The Musical (December 7)\n\nLet's bake pies. The hit Broadway musical, about a waitress in a loveless marriage who escapes via a pie baking contest in a neighbouring county, hits the big screen.\n\nThe Boy and the Heron (December 8)\n\nLet's get animated. At a time when octogenarian directors are showing us they've still got it (Martin Scorsese, Ridley Scott, Michael Mann), the masterful Hayao Miyazaki, now 82, treats us to another animated classic, this time a meditation on grief and growing up.\n\nEileen (December 8)\n\nLet's do a twist. Anne Hathaway and Thomasin Mackenzie (Leave No Trace, Power of the Dog) star in a potboiler about a friendship between a secretary and a psychologist at a prison that goes off the rails.\n\nPoor Things (December 8)\n\nLet's get weird. Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos (The Lobster, The Favourite, Dogtooth) brings a woman back to life, with Emma Stone earning major Oscar buzz in the lead role.\n\nWonka (December 15)\n\nLet's get chocolate. Timothée Chalamet takes on the role that Johnny Depp went creepily strange with in the 2005 version of the Roald Dahl classic. With Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa and Rowan Atkinson (of Mr. Bean fame) as a priest.\n\nThe Zone of Interest (December 15)\n\nLet's get dark. Director Michael Glazier's brave (and controversial) story of how a commandant at Auschwitz, Rudolf Höss, and his wife Hedwig, strive to build a dream life for their family in a house and garden next to the camp.\n\nAquaman and the Lost Kingdom (December 22)\n\nLet's go deep. Jason Momoa is back, this time teaming up with brother Orm in a battle to save the world.\n\nMigration (December 22)\n\nLet's do feathers. Writer Mike White (White Lotus, The School of Rock, Chuck & Buck), adds spice to an animated comedy about a family of birds on vacation.\n\nThe Iron Claw (December 22)\n\nLet's wrestle. Based on the true story of pro wrestling's Von Erich brothers, featuring a ripped Zack Efron and Jeremy Allen White (The Bear), with Lily James (Downton Abbey, Baby Driver).\n\nAnyone But You (December 22)\n\nLet's do a wedding in Australia. Sydney Sweeney (Euphoria, The White Lotus) and Glen Powell (Top Gun: Maverick, Hit Man) pretend to be a happy couple at the big event.\n\nFerrari (December 25)\n\nLet's do a legend. Adam Driver rocks an Italian accent as Enzo Ferrari, with Penelope Cruz as his wife and Shailene Woodley as his mistress. Oh, and director Michael Mann (Heat, The Insider, Ali) is driving.\n\nThe Boys in the Boat (December 25)\n\nLet's row. George Clooney directs a sports drama based on the true story of the University of Washington rowing team that competed at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin.\n\nThe Color Purple (December 25)\n\nLet's rethink a classic.

Based on the novel and the Broadway musical.\n\nStreaming movies\n\nMaestro (December 20, Netflix)\n\nClassical music is having a bit of a moment, even if it takes a backseat to pop music and the tremendous popularity of stars like Taylor Swift and Beyoncé.\n\nOn the heels of Tár, we get actor/director Bradley Cooper's take on the lifelong relationship between Leonard Bernstein and Felicia Montealegre Cohn Bernstein.\n\nThe Sacrifice Game (December 8, Shudder)\n\nJust in time for the holiday season, horror fans get a gift of a delightful little tale about a couple college girls at a boarding school who can't go home for Christmas. Enter a gang of cult killers.\n\nDiary of a Wimpy Kid Christmas: Cabin Fever Movie (December 8, Disney+)\n\nJimmy Kimmel's nephew Wesley voices the main character in this animated everything-gone-wrong runup to Christmas.\n\nMerry Little Batman (December 8, Prime Video)\n\nThings turn far more interesting than expected for Batman's son after daddy the superhero leaves him at home while zipping out to fight baddies on Christmas Eve.\n\nLeave the World Behind (December 8, Netflix)\n\nBilled as an apocalyptic thriller, this mystery features a couple (Julia Roberts, Ethan Hawke) and their kids renting a luxurious home, only to wind up as pretty to a cyberattack with unusual consequences.\n\nThe Family Plan (December 15, Apple TV+)\n\nMark Wahlberg and Michelle Monaghan star as a couple whose family, including teen son and daughter, face possibly deadly consequences from dad's past as a government assassin.\n\nChicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget (December 15, Netflix)\n\nThe latest Chicken Run centres on Ginger and Rocky escaping from the farm for a new adventure as they face a new threat to the whole of chicken-kind/\n\nRebel Moon: Part 1: A Child of Fire (Netflix)\n\nZack Snyder (300, Army of the Dead) directs this sci-fi fantasy about a peaceful colony on the edge of a galaxy finds itself threatened by an outside force."
