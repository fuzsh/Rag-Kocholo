It was the ultimate scary date movie as Jason terrorized campers at the iconic Camp Crystal Lake. It was truly a movie that may have led to a few sleepless nights. I can still remember the close scene as Jason thrusts from the waters at Camp Crystal Lake, everyone in the theatre jumped as Jason came out of the water!\n\nNow you can return to that time and visit the actual scene where the movie was filmed! It's the real Camp Crystal Lake and they're doing tours for the ultimate horror fans this spring!\n\nDo YOU dare visit the place Jason calls home? It's right here in New Jersey. These events are held at Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco in Hardwick, New Jersey, which was the primary filming location of Friday the 13th, Part 1. It's a bucket list experience for any Friday the 13th fan!\n\nGet details on this horrifically fun adventure right here in New Jersey, with tours happening this May and June!\n\nCLICK HERE (if you dare) for more details on the events happening in Warren County, New Jersey.\n\nLOOK: The Most Famous Actor Born Every Year\n\nSee the Must-Drive Roads in Every State"
