        "text": "During my downtime when I've got noting else to do, I love to sit down and find a good movie or television series to watch. And I'm not very picky when it comes to my choice of video.\n\nThere have been a few that I might just turn off in the first couple of minutes if it looks like there are no brain cells in my head that can deal with the stupidity or the movie or it's just not something I would ne interested in watching.\n\nAnd for those movies or shows I like, I sometimes do some research to find out more about the behind the scenes. Like was the location mentioned in the movie or series the actual place if was filmed. Or what other films or shows have the actors I have never seen before, been in?\n\nThere's a series on YouTube called First We Feast - Hot Ones. Maybe you've seen it? The series is hosted by Sean Evans, and each episode features a celebrity being interviewed by Sean while eating spicy foods that are hotter with each platter served.\n\nIn one episode, Sean interviews Paul Rudd, who stars in many movies and series, including 'Wet Hot American Summer' which came out in early 2001. Paul talks about the setting of the movie which I was surprised to find out, was an actual summer camp called Camp Towanda in Honesdale, Pennsylvania, which is in Wayne County, just a bit northeast of Scranton, Pa. Listen to Paul talk about it at about 7:28 in:\n\nThe movie also starred Bradley Cooper, Amy Poehler, Elizabeth Banks, Molly Shannon, Janeane Garofalo and Michael Showalter. A Netflix series was created in 2015 and 2017. Oh, by the way, keep watching the video to see how Paul fares as the food he consumes gets hotter and hotter.\n\nOne interesting little tidbit that Paul mentioned that you may not know: they had to rush through filming, to make way for a young boy's bar mitzvah! Yep. Apparently, the family of the boy had rented out the entire camp, and that butted up against filming for the movie.\n\nSo if you have the opinion that the movie feels rushed, you can blame that kid!\n\nKEEP GOING: The Were Lots Of Stars In 'Wet Hot American Summer.
