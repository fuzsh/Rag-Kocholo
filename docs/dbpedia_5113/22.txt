WLLD is a Rhythmic Contemporary Hits-formatted radio station licensed to Holmes Beach, Florida that serves the Tampa Bay area in Florida, and is owned by CBS Radio.

WLLD's transmitter is located in Seminole, Florida.

Station history

The kayfabe line is that the station was started by two boys, Josh and Brian, on their father's boat during the first half of 1998. It was also stated to be contraband and irregulated airwaves until they were bought and turned into what is now the station that is broadcast today. In reality, the station just had a very small budget to start with, often resulting in the same songs playing over and over again.

At first, WLLD's musical direction included a balanced mix of hit-driven R&B/Hip-Hop and Dance tracks, mostly to counter rival WFLZ, a move that would pay off up until WBTP (WFLZ's sister station) debuted. Today, the station's playlist is atypical of most rhythmics as it consists of mostly hip-hop and R&B hits, thus is considered to be a "rhythmic crossover" by "Billboard".

The Last Damn Show is an annual concert put on by "WiLD 98.7" WLLD in the Tampa Bay Area. It is put on in late October or early November every year since 1999.

The 'WILD' branding

WLLD uses the "WiLD" branding in Tampa. The crazy and irreverent presentation and interaction with the audience is in the truest since "WiLD". The brand has since been trademarked by Clear Channel Communications years later since the debut of WLLD, which is due to Clear Channel owning KYLD/San Francisco, who has used the "WiLD" branding since their launch in 1992.

When "WiLD 98.7" was started, the first song played was Tone-Loc's "Wild Thing", hence the station's branding basis.
