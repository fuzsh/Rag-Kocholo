        "text": "This paper seeks to highlight the link between US military training and aid provided to Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America, and the deteriorating security situation in Mexico itself. Violence in Mexico associated with drugs has increased in intensity, scope and brutality as the country has become the major transit point for narcotics entering the U.S. Kenny and Serrano have argued this represents a “security failure” for the Mexican state (Kenny & Serrano, 2011a, p.1-25). Agreeing with this conclusion, this paper shows that the paramilitirization of the drug war and use of extreme tactics, which is most associated with the ex-military led drug-trafficking organization (DTO) los Zetas, is an important factor in explaining Mexico’s current predicament. This has also had ramifications for U.S. interests in Mexico. By tracing Los Zetas history this paper also reveals potential ties between their inception and behavior, and past U.S. training provided to military forces in Mexico and Central America. Whilst by no means suggesting a simple causal relationship, this paper does argue that U.S. military training, often justified in terms of aiding Mexico’s drug fight, has played an important and unintended role in professionalizing and militarizing certain DTOs, and thereby worsening the complex and multi-faceted phenomenon of Mexican security failure. In addition it seeks to show that current training provided under the Mérida Initiative risks continuing this trend, and argues that this increasingly represents a paradox for U.S. security policy in Mexico.\n\nTransnational organized crime is a pressing global security issue. Mexico is currently embroiled in a protracted drug war. Mexican drug cartels and allied gangs (actually poly-crime organizations) are currently challenging states and sub-state polities (in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and beyond) to capitalize on lucrative illicit global economic markets. As a consequence of the exploitation of these global economic flows, the cartels are waging war on each other and state institutions to gain control of the illicit economy. Essentially, they are waging a ‘criminal insurgency’ against the current configuration of states. As such, they are becoming political, as well as economic actors. This presentation examines the dynamics of this controversial proposition. The control of territorial space—ranging from ‘failed communities’ to ‘failed regions’—will be examined. The presentation will examine the exploitation of weak governance and areas (known as ‘lawless zones,’ ‘ungoverned spaces,’ ‘other governed spaces,’ or ‘zones of impunity’) where state challengers have created parallel or dual sovereignty, or ‘criminal enclaves’ in a neo-feudal political arrangement. The use of instrumental violence, corruption, information operations (including attacks on journalists), street taxation, and provision of social goods in a utilitarian fashion will be discussed. Finally, the dynamics of the transition of cartels and gangs into ‘accidental guerrillas’ and ‘social bandits’ will be explored through the lens of ‘third generation gang’ theory and ‘power-counter power’ relationships. This presentation will serve as a starting point for assessing the threat to security from transnational organized crime through lessons from the Mexican cartels.\n\nIn recent years, some of the most lethal episodes of violence have taken place in countries vastly a ected by organized crime, such as Mexico and Honduras. Criminal groups2 are primarily economical actors: they do not aim at constituting a parallel power system. However, they bene t from a weak State, unable to rmly control its territory, in order to create areas of impunity where they can operate undisturbed. is chapter analyses the speci c challenges of dealing with criminal organizations from an international humanitarian law (IHL) and human rights perspective. First, I discuss how the criteria to determine the existence of a non-international armed con ict (NIAC) apply to organized crime. Broadly speaking, criminal groups are not considered party to a con ict, despite the fact that they might engage in acts of vio- lence against the government. Nonetheless, situations such as the one in Colombia, and arguably the violence in Mexico, would suggest that criminal groups operating in these countries could be considered party to a NIAC. ese organizations do not limit them- selves to take advantage of the instability and weakness of the government, but directly challenge its authority, seeking to create zones of impunity where they can pursue their criminal activities. Hence, they constitute an actual and serious threat to the State. Second, the chapter focuses on the speci c challenges of dealing with organized crime. Heinous crimes against civilians demonstrate that criminal groups are unlikely to respect domestic and international law. e responses adopted so far at national and international level have proved utterly un t to face the challenges posed by criminal organizations. However, given organized crime’s devastating impact on civilians, it is desirable to at least nd ways to engage with these groups. e greatest di culty lies in their economical nature and motivation: unlike opposition groups, they do not aim at overthrowing the government. erefore, they do not seek for international legiti- macy and have thus fewer incentives to respect international legal obligations. e nal part of the chapter thus suggests strategies to engage with criminal groups in order to improve the protection of civilians.\n\nAccording to the US Government, over 60 percent of the cocaine intended for the US market transit through Central American. Since the early 1990’s, Colombian and Mexican drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) established logistics bases both on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Central America, facilitating the movements of large shipments of cocaine. In establishing these routes, the DTOs took advantage of a number of local enabling factors. Among them, the preexistence of well-established smuggling networks, the weakness of law enforcement and judicial structures in most countries in the region, and the overall culture of lawless and impunity resulting from the civil conflicts that marked the paths to democracy of some of these nations. The tough campaigns launched against DTOs by the governments of Colombia and Mexico during the past eight years, coupled with the gradual evolution of both local and foreign criminal organizations (COs) involved in (but not exclusively) cocaine trafficking, seem to have further worsened the situation in Central America. Old styled DTOs and local “transportistas” are increasingly challenged by new criminal groups, usually emerging from the military and claiming specific territories. These new groups are exerting a capillary control over all types of criminal activity taking place in the territories under their control. The confrontation between two different criminal “cultures”-- the first, business oriented; the second one, territorial oriented-- constitutes a serious threat not only to the security of citizens, but also to the very consolidation of balanced democratic rule in the region. Mexican DTOs and COs poses a serious threat to Central American, if left unchecked. Responses by national institutions, assisted by their main international partners, will have to be carefully tailored according to the specific feature of the predominant foreign criminal organization operating in its territory. In the case of DTOs, interventions will have to privilege investments in the areas of financial investigations, specialized prosecution and international cooperation, as well as anti-corruption initiatives. In combating COs (Zetas type), intervention will have to privilege restructuring, professionalization and deployment of local police corps that would then be capable of controlling the territory and preventing the infiltration of external criminal actors. In both cases, governments need to strengthen the intelligence capacity of law enforcement agencies allowing the early identification of the likely threat, its analysis and its subsequent removal. National law enforcement and judicial efforts should also be geared toward the creation of a sincere and mutual beneficial international cooperation (both investigative and judicial) that is built not only on common objectives, but also on the use of common investigative instruments and harmonized procedures."
