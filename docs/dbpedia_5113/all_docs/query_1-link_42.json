        "text": "Nothing is safe from the Florida Man, not even ol’ Rover at the dog park. According to the arrest report, a Florida man has been arrested after starting a fight with someone after he was caught “humping” someone’s dog.\n\nJohn Miller was caught “humping” a dog and when the owner confronted him. It was then when Miller attacked him, punching him in the head and upper body, leaving red marks and cuts. Even worst, after the fight, Miller decided to go on a vandal streak, breaking items in the garage to include the garage door. The victim said that Miller managed to grab a knife and threaten to kill the victim and his mother. This is all according to the Santa Rosa County Sheriff’s Office.\n\nHe said Miller also grabbed a knife threatening to kill him, leaving him in fear of his and his mother’s life.\n\nMiller, 33, is charged with domestic violence-battery, domestic violence-aggravated assault, and criminal mischief. Miller is in the Santa Rosa County Jail with a $7,000 bond.\n\nRod Stewart Through The Decades\n\nRod Stewart: Classic Images\n\nGhostbusters: Afterlife – Still Images\n\nJeff Zito or just \"Zito\" as he is known to his friends, was born in Summit, NJ.
