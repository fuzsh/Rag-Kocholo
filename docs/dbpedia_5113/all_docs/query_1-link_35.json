        "text": "<strong>Wednesday</strong>, <strong>March</strong> <strong>24</strong>, <strong>2010</strong> >> FRANK SAXE Frank@insideradio.com >> PAUL HEINE Paul@insideradio.com (800) 290-6301 THE MOST TRUSTED NEWS IN RADIO BIA/Kelsey forecasts a 1.5% revenue increase this year and 2-4% annual growth over the next few years. The 2009 numbers are in: Radio closed a devastating year with $13.7 billion in revenue from broadcast and online sources, a decline of 18.4% from $16.8 billion in 2008. (The 2009 figure is lower than the $16 billion estimate the RAB reported last month.) While the new forecast calls for revenue to inch up to $13.9 billion this year, it‘s expected to be the start of a 2-4% annual growth rate over the next few years. That would return the industry to the $16 billion mark by 2014. “While the poor economy held it down momentarily, radio is coming back to demonstrate that it is an important advertising vehicle, particularly in local media markets,” BIA/Kelsey VP Mark Fratrik says. “The industry will continue to grow its online revenues in <strong>2010</strong> as increasingly more progressive radio groups recognize they are more than just over-the-air transmitters.” Digital will help drive radio forward over the next five years at a predicted 16.5% compound growth rate. “This can be a very transformative year for radio broadcasters if they leverage their properties with the technologies that their listeners embrace,” BIA/Kelsey chief strategy officer Rick Ducey says.

Investments in web sites, online streams, mobile apps, HD, integrated platforms and other emerging technologies will continue to pay off over the next five years, according to BIA/Kelsey. Online initiatives contributed $400 million to the bottom line last year with $500 million anticipated for <strong>2010</strong>. Digital is forecast to tack on an additional $100 million every year through 2014 except one. Katz 360 president Brian Benedik says first quarter digital business on the rep firm’s ledger has doubled over the same period last year. “It’s growing at a brisk pace, outpacing the general digital trend by a healthy margin,” he says. “As we begin Q2, those same trends are in place. More and more advertisers are activating an offline and online program.” Digital revenue is poised to accelerate further in the second half of the year as candidates and political action committees include digital activations alongside their TV and radio buys. Following a 63% increase last year, Regent is shooting for 47% in digital growth in <strong>2010</strong>, according to VP of technology and digital media Larry Downes. The high percentages are partially due to the fact that Regent is in “an earlier stage of our overall digital development than some of the bigger radio groups,” Downes says. While the trends are encouraging, radio is grabbing just a fraction of overall digital dollars. Global market intelligence firm IDC forecasts total online ad spending will jump 12.6% to $29.7 billion in the U.S. this year, following a 2.4% decline in 2009. Year over-year online ad spending increased 4.5% to $7.4 billion in the fourth quarter. Court’s stay of cross-ownership rules unlikely to trigger dealmaking. The Third Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Philadelphia lifted its stay of the FCC’s media ownership rules yesterday. The measure puts into effect the Commission’s 2008 order to allow cross-ownership of broadcast stations and newspapers in the top 20 markets and on a case by case MORE NEWS >> InsideRadio.com page"
