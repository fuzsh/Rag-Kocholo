In this video, shared by Responder Safety, you get the inside view of an incident that shook Smyrna, Delaware’s Citizen’s Hose Company. Watch the video here. It’s eleven and a half minutes and it’s worth your time.\n\nBrian has been working in pop culture and media for about three decades: he’s worked at MTV, VH1, SiriusXM, CBS and Loudwire. Besides working as a writer and an editor-in-chief, he’s also appeared on air as a pundit, guested on radio shows and hosted podcasts. Over the years, he’s interviewed the surviving members of Led Zeppelin, the members of U2, Beyonce, Pink, Usher, Stevie Nicks, Lorde… and is grateful to have had the chance to interview Joe Strummer of the Clash and Tom Petty.\n\nSign me up for the 92.5 Maxima email newsletter!\n\nObtendrá acceso a concursos en línea exclusivos, preventas de boletos, invitaciones a eventos VIP, ofertas increíbles y otras cosas divertidas – todo entregado directamente a su in-box!\n\nFirst Name *\n\nLast Name\n\nEmail *\n\nBy clicking \"Subscribe\" I agree to the website's terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
