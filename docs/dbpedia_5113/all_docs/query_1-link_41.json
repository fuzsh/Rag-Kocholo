Chronological Listings: Circuses, Festivals and Exhibitions 597 Appendix B. Bibliography — The Sources 607 IX Introduction The author as an undergraduate Physical Education student from 1933 to 1937 participated in all scheduled gymnastic shows at West Chester. After graduation like all alumni who entered the teaching profession it was an historical devotion to promote the presentation of gymnastic shows, circuses and dances. Contacts were made with fellow alumni both men and women to share presentation experiences and exchange ideas. At the beginning of World War II the Author was on duty with the United States Army Air Corps at the technical training command Miami Beach, Florida. Coincidentally, the New York theater impresario, Josh Logan, arrived in November 1942 to direct a war fund raising performance of Sigmund Romberg's operetta 'The Desert Song\". This production required the recruitment of a cast of performers experienced in acrobatic gymnastics. A review of civilian education and experiences of military personnel by director Logan and the Army personnel section at the Miami base resulted in the Author being given the temporary assignment to plan and direct this part of the operetta. The examination of records coupled with the interviewing of physical training specialists provided a cadre of one dozen \"acrobats\". Practices were scheduled and seamstresses assigned to make the appropriate \"period\" flowing wide striped trousers and waist bands. By show time the author with his troop of desert acrobats in black and white baggy pantaloons and dark makeup joined the cast to unveil director Josh Logan's \"Desert Song\", with an accompanying military orchestra. The Miami Civic auditorium had an over subscribed full house and a considerable sum of money was raised. A number of Hollywood movie stars of that time including Constance and Joan Bennett and Gilbert Roland made featured appearances. Though not within the context of this book it is Author rehearsing \"acrobats\" in costume for the \"Desert Song\" by Sigmund Romberg. ^*»3a Cast rehearsal with Josh Logan. Author \"Fort Zinderneuf\", Miami Bob Hope, Alex Smallwood Bob Munstedt— 1944 Sgt. Smallwood, Sgt. Munstedt, Pvt. Zelinsky Bob Hope Nadzab-Papua New Guinea 1944 l v>^nL JF -.1 19** n& 's Sergeant Bob Munstedt and Sergeant Alex Smallwood significicant to note that in all theaters of the war United States Armed Forces' Personnel who came into the service with developed or latent talent gave performances on many occasions in the most stressful situations. The Author's unit— The Roarin 20s— 312th Bomb Group, 5th Air Force found both flying and ground personnel with multiple talents keeping this action alive. One example will of necessity represent all. Sergeant Bob Munstedt from Massachusetts entered the service with his counterpart a small wooden figure named Sergeant Alex Smallwood. Bob's ventriloquist act was the delight of not only all 5th Air Force Personnel, but also of Australian troops as well as the natives of Papua, New Guinea; Dutch New Guinea; and the Philippines. One must also recognize the most famous \"Travelling\" American, Bob Hope, whose appearance in the 312th combat area brought to a zenith the philosophy of entertainment for troops all over the world. Bob Hope included Bob Munstedt and Alex Smallwood in his program for the troops. Returning from service on 4 January 1964 the Author within less than one week returned to visit West Chester to extend greetings to his Coach Glenn Killinger and President Charles S. Swope. These conferences resulted in the author being literally \"drafted\" to fill in as a Physical Education Teacher under the direction of Harry R. Allen who had been his teacher and supervisor nine years earlier. Dr. Swope within one week, upon the recommendation of Dr. Killinger, invited the Author to a conference, During this meeting the Author was assigned to be a teacher and assistant coach of football as well as immediately revive both the gymnastic and the track and field teams for competition. As an after thought President Swope suggested that this revival movement should include plans for the Physical Education Department Circus!!! The 1947 Circus chronologically appears in this volume in the Spring of that year. This show would sadly turn out to be director Harry R. Allen's final tribute climaxing his seventeen year career. His death on campus six months later would in turn be a major factor in the writing of this book. XI President Swope directed the Author to take over Mr. Allen's office in the 1890 \"old\" gymnasium and to continue the senior student teaching supervision. In the office and within the gym ground floor were a number of locked storage closets which were under Mr. Allen's control. As frequently occurs with the passing into history of educational leaders such as Harry R. Allen there is a mandatory assessment of equipment records, files, documents, books, photographs, etc. Thus the decedent's family will be given all personal items and books. Further a detail of the college housekeeping staff was subsequently ordered to come to the old gym with a truck, report to the Author, and remove the contents of all storage closets for disposal. At this moment motivated by some unknown force the Author determined to examine all items and inventory same before the housekeeping team arrived. It was as if one pressed a Jules Verne time machine and returned to the past. Harry R- Allen had literally saved and stored all department records dating back to the beginning of the Normal School. All of Dr. Clyde E. Ehinger's files including anthropometric examinations, lectures, books, gymnastic show programs, photographs, athletic trophies, banners, antique light hand apparatus, and physical measuring devices were stored in cardboard boxes. In addition, items in similar categories from the service periods of Dr. Charles B. Lewis and Dr. James Bliss were in storage along with those relating to the deceased director's era 1930-1747. Mr. Harry R. Allen had been a trusted guardian of his department's past records and achievements. Contacts were immediately made with the supervisor of the housekeeping team to delay the cleaning disposal process. Suitable and proper emoluments were made to the housekeeping team to secure the time needed to meet this challenge. Miss Geraldine Conbeer (see College Centennial History page xi), librarian archivist, provided storage boxes and space in the library basement in which to place them. These rare and unusual primary evidences of the department's past literally formed the bases of this book. Further, Mr. Everett Shaefer, Business Manager of the college, from his official records storage areas supported the research necessary regarding the Board of Trustees minutes as well as those of the faculty meetings. Additional support was gained through successively placing appeals for help from alumni in the newsletter mailed to all living graduates of the college: Calling All Alumni To mark the occasion of the 100th anniversary of gymnastic exhibitions at WCU, Dr. Russell Sturzebecker, retired professor emeritus, is preparing a rotogravure book. Anyone who has photos, clippings, programs or other memorabilia relating to the exhibitions is asked to contact him. Conferences with Earle C. Waters, retired faculty member who directed the shows from 1928-1941, were of significant help. Excerpts from his personal files appear in this volume. Faculty members Anne Schaub, Muriel Leach, Myra Wade, Glenn Killinger, and Charles Graham provided both support and first hand accounts of the time when they were involved with the many presentations. Last but equally helpful were the non-instructional staff including administrators, John Hollinger, Bertie Chambers, Tom Pitt, and Herbert Clavier, who behind the scenes directed their subordinate chiefs and staffs to be a vital part of the shows preparations. The technical and constructive support of the total college maintenance staff including housekeeping, kitchen personnel, carpenters, electricians, seamstresses, security, transportation and medical staff were a vital part of all programs (the Centennial History chapter eleven pp. 259- 265 furnishes names with photos). Special Note to the reader This chronological account of all the shows presented by the Physical Training Department are in documentable form with the actual programs, newspaper and periodical reports exactly as written at the time. The photographs are original or reproduced from those taken then. The reader must of necessity try to \"live\" in that period of time to both understand and appreciate the unique features of the language, interest, and the complexities of life for university students, faculty and towns people. It is important to recognize that these shows were not limited to performers and assistants in the Physical Training Department. Members of other departments both faculty and students were either in the shows or supportive of the programs. A review of programs, news reports and photos reveals the rather universal participation of the music department. Charlotte Hardee, the director, performed individually and also led choruses as adjuncts to dramatic and dance numbers. The Art Faculty gave direction to the decor for scenery and costumes for the special requirements within the performances. Their names appear within the news reports and programs. The President as well as the Board of Trustees considered these shows to be the primary means of excellent public relations with the community, the state of Pennsylvania and the nation. Alumni attendance and support provided both an avenue of new students as well as primary information on job opportunities in their home areas. It was not uncommon to have every available hotel or rooming house filled during show week, similarly the listing of all public transportation to or from West Chester was publicized well in advance. These programs provided the major (and only) significant means of socially acceptable contact between the males and females who enrolled at the University. The joint performances established in 1898-1899 must be designated as the beginning of freedom on the campus. Xll Finally it is noted that in the show on 11 March 1899 found Miss Mabel Mearns female gym captain for the girls leading them in their joint performance with the Men's Teams. In 1966, sixty-seven years later, Miss Mearns will return to open the show by presenting flowers to Cris Sanderson, Class of 1901, who repeated his Indian club routine which he had performed in his junior and senior year 1900 and 1901. In retrospect Dr. Ehinger initiated the competitive sports aspect as an integral part of the programs for students. By 1966 universities as well as schools motivated by the increasing desire for success with potential championships increased the number of coaching personnel. Then the coaching staffs in term demanded more exclusive training time along with increased game scheduling as well as off season practices. The student athlete literally became a single purpose \"gladiator\" specializing invariably in one sport. His life and living time belonged to his coach and sport. No longer could there be a complete student and faculty body dedicated to a circus Physical Education- dance-sports demonstrations with literally 100% involvement. One must also include the competitive growth of other student interests — music organizations, dramatics, debates, etc. which continue through the whole academic year. When a university grows geometrically in size the individual student and faculty member literally becomes one of many. In the university mass one can no longer be a part of whole intrinsic group where interrelationships with many students, all disciplines, and faculty are a vital part of the educational processes. It is the hope of the author that the reader \"literally\" turn the years back and vicariously assume a student or faculty member's role with those performers which were a vital part of West Chester University's history. xm Technical Credits The continuous research for the past forty-five years resulted in comprehensive original newspaper articles, programs, official reports, hunderds of photographs, periodical reviews, taped interviews with faculty leaders, participants, and alumni individuals who were in the audiences of the many performances. In chronological order these were placed in expandable folders to accommodate the varied data with accompanying visual material as well as the narrative titles and manuscript. At this point the services of Richard W. Taylor, President of KNA Press Inc., were brought in to direct the printing operation. His extensive experience along with that of his specialized staff proceeded to create the book. Of his staff he and three of his crew, Gerald Pierce, Richard Baccino, and Joseph Young, have printed three books and two reprints for the Author in the past twenty years. The two photographs of Richard W. Taylor and his eight staff members provide the reader with views of this uniquely qualified group whose technical individual specialized operations brought this volume to life. Left to right: Richard Taylor, Kathy Trautman, Gerald Pierce, Joseph Young, Debra Gallek, Richard Baccino, Edward Schork, Roni Camacho and Jerry Cornette. Once the printing of all signatures was completed, the KNA staff placed these in special large cartons. The next phase starts with the transporting of several thousand pounds of signatures to the bindery. Downey Hoster with over 40 years experience in the Graphic Arts Industry, who is founder and president of Hoster Bindery Inc. in Ivyland Pennsylvania, brought his staff into operation. This very complex operational area started with the folded signatures and sequentially each staff specialist brings his talents to be part of total binding procedures. The sewing, pasting, cutting, with attaching cover creations, and the multiple pressing along with continual inspections ends with the shrink plastic covers on each book followed by the packing in cartons. Downey and his staff since 1977 have processed the binding of three printings of \"The Roarin 20's\" as well as that of the first printing \"The Photo Atlas of Greco-Roman Cultural And Athletic Archaeological Sites\" for the Author.

His family moved to West Chester where he attended the public schools graduating in 1942 He entered the service in World War II serving in the U.S. Navy at an advance amphibious base in Fowey, Cornwall England as well as aboard PC. 617 operating from Le Havre, France, 1943-1946. As a post-war veteran he attended West Chester State Teachers College in the Health and Physical Education Program receiving his B.S. degree in 1950. By 1954 he XIV Bill Buffington U.S. Navy World War II Bill Buffington received his M.Ed degree in Elementary Educational Administration. His extensive professional career has covered all levels of education from elementary through university. He has been Administrative Elementary Principal in a number of school districts. At the same time he was active in the professional and veterans' organizations. He has been a key figure in the veterans' Patrol Craft Sailors Association serving as national newsletter editor as well as designing the logo for the group. He has studied in the field of cartooning and has been widely recognized as a leader on the topical cartooning field. The Author has continually used Bill's talents in his publications. The Centennial History of West Chester State College, 1871-1971, has an excellent \"library\" of Buffington cartoons (selected ones appear in this volume). The front and back end papers furnish the reader with a range of Bill's cartooning talents. These portray Bill's knowledge not only of his participation in these shows but also his translating the performers and their movements to the art page for the reader to be a vicarious patron of the event. A closing note: Bill was the Author's student in a number of courses as well as being a participant in his college career on the \"Raiders\" Football Team serving as captain in his senior year. The Author always has and always will be an aficionado collector of Buffington cartoons. Ayres Unger He was born 6 July 1913 in Rahway, New Jersey of parents who had extensive successful careers as teachers of physical education. After completing his high school courses at Ocean City, New Jersey, he enrolled in Drexel University, Philadelphia and completed his B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering. He had also been enrolled in both C.M.T.C. and R.O.T.C programs during his college career. Ayres secured employment in the Gulf Oil Refinery in 1936. He took leave of this position on 5 July 1942 to enter the United States Army Signal Corps. His overseas assignments included Bahamas, New Guinea; and the Philippine Island. Upon discharge from the service, he returned to his position with Gulf Oil and retired after over 40 years of service in 1976. His interest in photography began in 1932 and since his retirement he has developed a complete photographic resources center. Ayres has been actively associated in photographic work with several authors in this area. He also serves as special staff photographer for a number of local newspapers. / Ayres Unger in Uniform Ayres Unger Today Gerald R. Schoelkopf Gerald was born 6 July 1945 in Reading, Pennsylvania. After graduating from Bishop McDevitt High School, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania in 1963, he attended Villanova University and completed his Bachelor of Arts Degree in History/Literature 1967. Two years later he attained his Masters Degree in Library Science from McGill University in Montreal, Canada. Since 1969 he has been a faculty member of the library staff. In 1975 he studied at Case Western University, Cleveland, Ohio and received the Library Administrative Archival Certificate. For the past twenty four years the Author has worked closely with his office in archival research as well as being guest lecturer in graduate courses taught by the Author. This has created the Allen-Ehinger Special Collection of Rare Physical Education and Sport Books. These cover the past two centuries. His particular research efforts have been instrumental in developing the Author's recent Greco- XV Gerald R. Schoelkopf Roman Photo Atlas of Cultural-Athletic Archaeological Sites as well as this volume. He has clearly and concisely in five paragraphs defined \"Retrieving the Past\": A member of the university community hurrying past Anderson Hall on the way to a class might briefly wonder who this building was named after, but then they rush on not realizing that they have touched briefly on the rich traditions that lie behind the institution and reach out to influence our actions today. Many times we tend to think only in the present — the now — and forget what has gone before. These past triumphs — exciting gym shows, award winning art exhibits, famous lecturers, faculty research, and accomplishments of alumni — tend to fade rapidly into time and are forgotten. If we allow ourselves to forget these accomplishments we lose an important force — \"pride.\" We need to have an institutional pride in the deeds of the past to give us a firm foundation to carry us through the present and help us not to lose sight of our goals. On most campuses the organization that devotes itself to keeping these memories alive is the university archives. When asking students what is an archives they invariably describe it as a storehouse for old books and papers, where objects which have lost their usefulness are packed away and forgotten. Unlike this description, the archives of today are an active organization that function as the collective memory of the institution, where what has gone before us is consulted, studied and used to help us establish who we are, what we are trying to accomplish and how we may approach the future. Archives have existed from earliest history to the present, but in recent years more and more institutions have recognized their importance and on many campuses and in industry, etc. archives have been revived or established. Today's archives may contain a great variety of sources — from the traditional books, papers, and photographs to microfilm, microfiche, computer disks and tapes, and the machines to access them on. With today's technology, access to the materials in the archives is much easier and quicker — especially with the increased use of computers to access the contents of our collections to create guides to help our users. Today we don't have to wonder \"who was that individual\" but can decide \"I'm going to learn more about that individual and what their accomplishments were.\" I. The Beginning Every modern country in the world, since its earliest development, has significant evidences of public performances by talented individuals. These presentations covered a wide range of activities in dramatics, music, movement skills, artistic displays, performing animals, and combative activities. This also included a cadre of teachers or trainers who directed these programs. Historically the several periods of the year served as a venue for the natural appearances of talented performers. The planting as well as the harvesting of grain, grapes, and fruit from the fields produced celebrations or festivals. Dramatics, dialogues, music, and dances encouraged participation as well as enthusiastic audiences. The outdoor flat area which served as place to thresh grain became a place to celebrate — the antecedent of the theater and performing arena. Fairs, festivals, and wakes attracted public per- formers— singers, dancers, acrobats, actors, wrestlers, animal trainers, runners, musicians, and fortune tellers. Before the advent of schools and colleges there are many records of public development and spectator interest in these activities. In 1724 a circus troupe appeared in the open area outside the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Among the performers were clowns, rope walkers, and sword dancers. In 1785 a Mr. Pool opened a riding school in this city and offered shows which included clowns and \"educated\" horses. John B. Ricketts in 1792 built an arena in Philadelphia for his new riding school. On the 23rd and 24th of April George Washington attended the shows presented there by Ricketts. In 1809 the Walnut Street theater in Philadelphia, the oldest active playhouse in the United States, reopened as the New Circus featuring equestrienne and circus acts. Two years later on 28 September 1811 in nearby Chester County Courthouse an educational insti- tution— the West Chester Academy, was established. The first classes began in 1813 in this Academy making it the seventeenth oldest institution of higher learning in the WEST-CHESTER ACADEMY.

These early academies had similar varying financial problems in their period of existence creating partially inactive operations or closures. However in West Chester a group of prominent citizens met with the trustees of the academy to create a successor to the school. On 23 August 1869 the public meeting disclosed that the \"trustees and contributors of the West Chester Academy would furnish their valuable property, library and museum as the basis for the establishment of a Normal School.\" By 9 September 1869 a committee of fifteen citizens prepared a document for the transition of the West Chester Academy to the Normal School. In addition, the Chester County Cabinet established in 1826 which furnished a building and museum for the Academy, would become part of and related to the Normal School. The General Assembly of Pennsylvania on 10 March 1870 passed \"An Act to Authorize the trustees and contributors to the West Chester Academy to become a State Normal School.\" Incorporated w5 k , 1 ■■■■ ' w ' ■ - si m %m hool M <*- aaidarjB o'Jt yjMmsrjiyjmjLA? /.)

West Chester State Normal School On September 25, 1871 Principal Ezekiel H. Cook and the staff welcomed 102 boys and 54 girls into the new Normal School building. The first year of the schools existence provided a multitude of problems whose final solutions were beyond the principal and his eleven faculty members. The duties listed for the chief executive could in no manner be completely carried out. The major resource to study the first years operations are revealed in the minutes kept for the weekly faculty meetings. The major concern was that of student discipline. The minutes of 16 October 1871 outlines the attempt to reward or punish students in terms of their behavior. Pice 4-16 Oct. - \"Mel as usual. Called to order by Pres. reading of minutes by See. - after which the Standard of 5+ was adopted for marking. 5+ was extremely good, 5 very good, 4 good. 3 passable, 2 bad, 1 very bad. Misdemeanors - Gen. disorder from 1 to 10. Inattention in classes 1 ; Eating in classes 5; communication in classes 1, replying or talking back from 1 to 5; Lack of prompt obedience 1 ; Unnecessary noise in entering or leaving class rooms 1 + ; lighting gas without permission 1 + ; spitting on floor 3; spitting down stairs 5+; tardiness at any exercise 1 + ; wearing boots in school room 1; throwing dirt on floor 1: leaving chapel without permission 5; Going to sleeping rooms during study hours, without permission 5+; Noi.sc ;iller retiring bell 5+; noise in study room 3+; Buffoonery 5+.\" The successive minutes of the faculty meetings reveal the attempts to meet the continuing disciplinary problems. The most positive act was the establishment of a Literary Society named for its sponsor and first President of the Board of Trustees Reverend William E. Moore. This organization would function most effectively for over seventy years. As the year closed Professor Cook would accept a new position in Columbus, Ohio, at the same time the board of trustees faced the major problem of learning that only one faculty member would be returning for the next school year. The newly elected principal, Dr. William A. Chandler, was a Chester County native with teaching experience. He had also received an M.D. degree followed by medical practice during and after the Civil War. The faculty minutes of the fall term are replete with the continuation of the disciplinary problems of the first year. Apparently Dr. Chandler's enthusiasm for educational aalministration waned to such an extent that he tendered his resignation in February to return to medical practice. The Board of Trustees in less than a year faced the problem of securing a new Principal. They acted quickly and elected the former Superintendent of Chester County Schools George L. Maris. His dual background in education and law will be the basis for his meeting the challenges of this new appointment. The first evidence of required physical training is noted in the faculty minutes of November 1873... \"gymnastic exercises would have required attendance\". The Moore Literary Society marked its second anniversary with a program presented by students and faculty. This included music, dramatics, and recitations with the Normal orchestra featured prominently. The 1874-1875 academic year provided a required daily drill in the Dio Lewis system of Light Gymnastics. This continued until December 31st when it was suspended. The school catalog of 1875-1876 noted that not only would the daily physical culture drill of Dio Lewis be practiced but that in favorable weather all students would engage in outdoor exercises. NORMAL SCHOOL E. H. Cook was born at Madrid, Maine, December 18, 1845. After preparatory schooling al Maine Slate Seminary, Lewislon, he entered Bowdoin College. His college work was interrupted by a period of service in the Civil War (1864-65) as Quarter-master Sergeant in the First Maine Light Artillery. He returned to Bowdoin receiving his A.B. in- 1866 and his A.M. the following year. He successively served as Principal of Wilton Academy, Maine, Superintendent of Schools at Orange, New Jersey and Principal of Woodstock Academy, Connecti- cut. In 1869 he married Clara W. Coburn. In 1871 he was elected to the position as Principal of the West Chester Normal School. After one year's service, he accepted a position as principal of Columbus High School in Ohio, remaining there nine years. During his career he served in a number of positions as Principal including Potsdam State Normal School and Rutgers College Preparatory School. Dr. Cook also served as Professor of Economy and School Law in the School of Pedagogy of the University of the City of New York. He was the recipient of the honorary Doctor of Philosophy degrees from Colgate University and St. Lawrence University. He served as President of the State Teachers' Association of both New York and New Jersey as well as secretary of the National Association. Dr. Cook died November 8, 1907 at Madison, Wisconsin. EZEKIEL HANSON COOK 1845- 1907 A.B., A.M., Ph.D. Principal 1871 - 1872 WILLIAM A. CHANDLER Principal 1872- 1873 A.M., M.D. (Winter Term) 1834- 1895 William A. Chandler was born at Kennett Square, Chester County, Pennsylvania September 10, 1834. He enrolled at Michigan University, graduating with the degree of A.B. in 1862. In his senior year in college and after graduation, he assisted Dr. Franklin Taylor at the Eaton Academy in Kennett Square. While serving as a teacher, he felt that his major interest was in the field of medicine so he continued his work at Michigan receiving the M.D. degree in 1863. He married Miss Louise A. Stein in 1864. He volunteered in the United States Army in 1864 as an assistant surgeon and was given hrs first assignment upon the Gettysburg battlefield. His government issue Civil War surgeon's chest with all instruments is on display in the college museum. He remained in the service as a medical director of hospitals in the West. Upon receiving his honorable discharge, he practiced medicine in Detroit. Michigan for seven years. He accepted the position of Principal in 1872 -but by the end of the winter term he resigned and moved to Philadelphia to return to medical practice. He was one'bf the founders of the Medico-Chirurgical College and served as a professor of Chemistry. He was a member of the Philadelphia Medical Society. Dr. Chandler died December 19. 1895 NORMAL SCHOOL On January 15, 1876 the elementary children Model school made history by giving an entertainment in the chapel. This was a junior version of the Moore Literary Society program. In the following year on February 3, 1877 the Society unveiled the first publication on campus. Bearing the title of the Moore Literary Gazette, Volume I, this would serve as a means of advertising future shows as well providing news reports of each performance. The seventh school catalog 1877-1878 year for the first time notes that the physical culture requirement will be centered on the leadership of one faculty member. Apparently Principal Maris asked for a volunteer among the faculty with no success. As has frequently occurred in educational management when no volunteers appear the \"assignment\" focuses upon a newly employed junior member of the faculty. Thus Mary K. Schreiner gains the unique distinction of being the first \"physical education teacher\" in the history of the school. The school catalog in its faculty lists bears the inscription ... \"Mary K. Schreiner, M.A. Teacher of Reading and Gymnastics\". Apparently this arrangement lasted only one year since at the start of the 1878-1879 session in the first faculty meeting Principal Maris could find no volunteer. At that point the faculty unanimously recommended that Principal Maris should take the assignment. He declined and said he would study the matter. By the spring term advertisements for the school included the following notation in faculty listings: \"Mrs. Annie M. Maris — Calisthenics.\" Thus the Principal's wife, the former Miss Annie M. Pinkerton becomes the not necessarily willing second gymnasium teacher in the history of the school. In January 1879 the girls petitioned the Principal for play apparatus since the outdoor equipment was monopolized by the boys. The Normal year of 1879-1880 started with the formation of a second Literary Club. Named the Aryan Society, its first president was Professor C.B. Cochran. The student members selected blue and gold as their colors to rival the Moore Society's colors of garnet and gold. Concurrently their rivalry resulted in the formation of two music groups — the Union Glee Club and the Union Corps. These will make major major musical contributions to future school shows and exhibitions. The 1880-1881 school year culminated eight years under the leadership of George L. Maris. With doubled enrollment, the expanding physical plant, an increasing number of qualified faculty, and the growing reputation of the school and its graduates, he announced his desire to leave the position. He endorsed one of his own faculty members, George Morris Philips as his successor. Principal Maris would accept a Professorship at nearby Swarthmore College, one of the several educational leadership positions he would take in his career. George L. Maris was born April 16, 1842 in Chester County. He attended the public school in West Vincent Township and the West Chester Academy. He graduated in 1867 from the University of Michigan following which he served two years as a teacher in Upper Uwchlan Township and four years in the West Chester Academy. In 1869 he gained two distinctions - marrying Miss Annie M. Pinkerton of Chester County and being elected Superintendent of the Public Schools of Chester County. Professor Maris accepted the challenge of this position and was responsible for a number of innovations. He restructured the local teachers' institutes throughout the county, organized service meetings for school directors and established an office for his base of operations. In 1871 he was reelected to the Superintendent's position but refused it to complete his law studies. When Dr. Chandler resigned in the spring of 1873, Professor Maris was unanimously elected to the position on March 13 by the Board of Trustees. The day before he had just been admitted to the practice of law by the Chester County Bar Association. Thus he always stated that he had the shortest law career of record. For eight years he energetically met the challenge of the Principalship providing the much needed educational leader- ship. Professor Maris taught classes, supervised the teachers and building staff, planned building improvements, introduced educational innovations and made the Normal School I he natural center of educational activities in the district. His wife, Annie, aided his efforts during his regime by teaching \"wax GEORGE L. MARIS 1842- 1921 Principal 1873 • 1881 fruits, flowers, and calisthenics.\" By now the enrollment of the Normal School had doubled. In 1881 he accepted a professorship at Swarthmore College. Shortly after he was appointed Principal of the Boys' Department of Friends Central High School of Philadelphia. When. the George School was opened by the Society of Friends at Newtown, Pennsylvania, Professor Maris was chosen to be its first principal. In this position he served several years providing I he superioi leadership which made Ihe school widely known in educational circles. Dr. Maris died April 28, 1921. NORMAL SCHOOL The George Morris Philips Era 1881-1920 The former teacher, a Chester County native, and now Principal at age 31 brought extensive educational experience to the position. Principal Philips started the 1881-1882 school year with sixteen faculty members which included two new teachers. With the shortage of space his primary mission was to plan the construction of the addition of the South Wing to match the recently completed North Wing. The girl students had registered continual complaints concerning their using the outdoor exercise play area. They found themselves being \"ogled\" by the boys while they were exercising. As a result in the southeast basement of the new wing a ladies gymnasium was being planned. The newspapers referred to this new facility as a \"romping room\" or a \"recess Elysium\" in which the girls could exercise unmolested. By the 1883-1884 school year this much used facility provided the first truly volunteer gymnasium teacher for the school. Miss Mary A. Cummings arrived in the fall as a new teacher of Penmanship, Drawing, and Bookkeeping. A native of Enfield, New Hampshire she had taught twelve years in a girl's high school in Harrisburg. Two classes were scheduled each afternoon for Miss Cummings to direct. She must be credited for inspiring the girls to participate in planned public performances at that time in both Literary Societies. Her poetry as well as articles on the subjects of health and fitness appeared in both Literary Journals. As a unique accolade she is credited as chairing the committee charged with selecting the Normal School colors. This evolved by taking the combined colors of the two Literary Societies and creating the Purple and Gold for the Normal — College — University. On February 10, 1885 the faculty on record advocated the building of a gymnasium for the students. These same faculty became concerned with their own fitness and formed a lawn tennis club for exercise. The redoubtable Mary A. Cummings took inspiration from this development and wrote a twenty-eight line poem based upon the name of the faculty tennis club \"Hit or GEORGE M. PHILIPS 1851 - 1920 Principal 1881 • 1920 George Morns Philips was born October 28, 1851 at Atglen, Chester County, Pennsylvania. His early education included attendance at the high school conducted.by Professor William E. Buck. He entered Lewisburg University (Bucknell ) in 1867 and graduated in the classical course in 1871. Following graduation he taught Mathematics for two years in Monongahela College in western Pennsylvania. In 1873 he joined the faculty of the West Chester Normal School. In 1877 he married a faculty member, Miss Elizabeth M. Pyle, a teacher of instrumental music. A year later he resigned to accept a professorship of Mathematics and Astronomy at Lewisburg University. In 1881 , upon Professor Maris's resignation, he was appointed Principal of the West Chester Normal School. Dr. Philips had the longest tenure of service, 39 years, of any Principal or President at West Chester. His accomplish- ments within and outside the institution he served were prodigious. He appeared as a teacher in classes and inaugurated the Normal School lecture course which brought outstanding men and women to the campus between 1890 and 1920. Among these were three United States Presidents - Theodore K. Roosevelt, William H. Taft and Woodrow Wilson. He accompanied twenty Senior classes on their Washington tours where they had opportunities to meet the President and cabinet officers. In his community he served as Director of the National Bank of Chester County, founder and President of the Dime Savings Bank, Trustee of the Chester County Hospital, and President of the Chester County Historical Society twenty-six years. He was a trustee of Bucknell University and a member of the College and University Council of Pennsylvania 1895 to 1912. He was appointed by the Governor of Pennsylvania to the State Committee to codify and revise the School Laws from 1907 to 1911. He served as a member of the State Board of Education 1911 to 1914. He was much in demand as a lecturer on educational subjects and served as instructor in teachers institutes in the United States. He wrote a number of books including Astronomy, 1882; Natural Philosophy, 1883; Key to Philosophy (with C. C. Balderston), 1884; Civil Government of Pennsylvania, 1893; Geography of Pennsylvania, 1895; Nation and State, 1905; Pennsylvania Geography, 1907; and Silver-Burdett Arithmetic Series (with Dr. Robert F. Anderson), 1913. He was a constant contributor to educational journals. Prior to his death, he initiated a program, unique in his time, analagous to the contemporary Golden Age groups. He made lists of citizens over ninety years of age and invited them to a special dinner at the school. Death terminated his life work on March 11, 1920. On the New Chester County Court House, with the names of Washington, Lafayette, Darlington, and Taylor is inscribed- George Morris Philips-Scholar and Educator. NORMAL SCHOOL Miss.\" Her poem was titled \"HITYRMIS\". The Aryan Society is credited with presenting the first gymnastic-dance-music exhibition, undoubtedly under the encouragement and direction of Miss Cummings. Within the program was a featured tambourine drill performed by twelve young ladies. In preparation for their \"debut\" patterns and material was purchased to sew white costumes trimmed with blue ribbons. Tambourines were made and practices were scheduled in the girls gymnasium. On 20 December 1886 the costumed cast of girls presented their program of twenty-six different figures led by a girl captain and accompanied by the Aryan orchestra. Enthusiastically received as the best number in the show, by popular demand, they repeated their performance on 29 June 1887. Two faculty members, Mary Cummings and Carrie Bemus, attended the Chautauqua Summer School in New York state. This institute offered an extensive educational and cultural program which included sport and physical activities. Thus Miss Cummings would broaden her background for teaching in the gymnasium. The 1888-1889 school year featured the appearance of the lawyer-lecturer William Blaikie from New York City. Author of a book \"How To Get Strong\", his appearance and the several presentation would motivate the changes to occur within two years. As a personal motivation on the Saturday following the lecture two students, Annie Smith and Katie Dunn walked to Fortieth and Market Street Philadelphia in six and one-half hours, a distance of over sixteen miles. Perhaps Blaikie's presentation also inspired a group of students to create and present \"The Gipsy Festival\" in the spring. Costumes were designed and made along with castanets and tambourines. Nine young ladies and nine gentlemen in gipsy dress provided the dramatics, music and dances. The presentation was enthusiastically received resulting in several encores. 1111C GIPSY FESTIVAL. A very iJretty exerclse.entltled \"The Gipsy Festival,'1 was represented by a number of young ladles and gentlemen. The exercise consisted of music and dancing. Tbe curtain, on being drawn usMo revealed the gipsies asleep; they were soon awakened by their queen and rising sangamornlngsong. Other special features were the song and fortune telling feats of little Gipsy Jane, the appear- ance of two Yankee tin peddlers, and their story related In song, and the chorus with tambourine accompaniment, with which the t performance closed. The performers were loudly encored, and returning repeated the chorus. The Dames of those who represented \"The Gipsy Festival\" areas follows: Misses Liz- zie Steele (queen), Irene Snyden (Gipsy Jane), Alfle Snyder, Lena Mercer, Bes- sie Rath, Anna Sensenlg, iLuoretia Lam-, bora, Anna Low her, Nettle Cannon, Messrs. Ben. Gheen and Fred. Brady (peddlers), Geo. Paschal, Edwin McNalr, Lionel Darlington, J. II. Hall, Ralston Lubens, Win. Plum and Mr. Wagner. The accompaniments were played by Miss Hemperly. The dresses of the performers were fanciful and very pic- turesque, and all were delighted with the representations. At Its .close the meeting adjourned. Among the performers was Fred Brady who will not only manage the first Normal baseball team but who will direct and perform in the team Minstrel Show 11 March 1893. George Morris Philips and the Board of Trustees also gained inspiration from William Blaikie's presentations. Not only were gymnasium structures studied but a committee from the Board led by the Principal visited leading schools in New York and New England to see gymnasiums and study plans. In January 1889 the trustees purchased four acres MARY A. CUMMINGS \"HITYRMIS.\" A doughty knight and modest 'squire Enter the list- the tennis court.

Thomas Roney Williamson, a prominent Philadelphia architect with offices at 136-138 South Fourth Street was given charge to develop plans for the new gymnasium based upon the exterior and interior plan of the Hemenway gymnasium at Harvard University. Principal Philips now faced the most difficult staffing problem in his professional career. From his visitations and conferences with a number of school, college and university leaders he prepared a detailed position description for the qualified person to create the physical training curriculum as well as direct all facets of the plan. — Interlud* The Brooklyn School of Physical Culture and the Chautauqua Institute, New York William G. Anderson organized the first conference in 1885 for American teachers and leaders in physical training. He and his brother Henry directed the Brooklyn School of Physical Culture as well as the allied summer Physical Training Program at the Chautauqua Institute in New York. Dr. Clyde E.

Upon his completion of the courses he became a professional associate and served on Dr. Anderson's staff at the Chautauqua Institute in the summers. From these experiences Dr. Anderson and Dr. Ehinger developed a deep friendship and close professional relationship which would endure through both men's lifetime. Of particular historic significance are two photographs from Dr. Ehingers records 1889-1890. The first depicts Dr. William G. Anderson, his brother Henry, and Dr. Clyde E. Ehinger, along with a number of professional associates in the gymnasium at the Brooklyn School of Physical Culture. With the first photo is a handwritten letter titled Index to Class Picture which identifies each person accompanied by humorous character delineations. The second photograph uniquely gives an 1890 outdoor view of students and teachers at the Chautauqua Summer School in New York State. It is titled: Dr. Enebuske's Class in Swedish Gymnastics Dr. Ehinger is at the right end of the back row, #10 Dr. Claes Enebuske was a visiting teacher of Swedish gymnastics based upon the Nils Posse system. Dr. Enebuske is #1 fifth from the left in the back row. Ten names are identified in the photo. Dr. Enebuske's book on Swedish Gymnastics is in the Allen Ehinger book collection in the West Chester University library. On 7 September 1889 the site of the new gymnasium was staked out and two days later the general contractors, Plummer and Jefferies, had horses pulling scoops to excavate the plot. On 9 October Serpentine stone cut from nearby Brinton's quarry was being set in the walls. By the first week in December workmen began boarding up the unfinished gymnasium to protect it from the storms of winter. In the spring work would resume since the contract stipulated that the gym would be completed by 1 August 1890. An historic moment occurred on 22 November when the first \"Normal Band\" was organized with student members under the direction of Frederick Clough. The main purpose was to furnish march music for a military company composed of students. The first concert given on 22 February 1890 was a complete success. The group would be the sources of musical talent to play for future exhibitions and other performing groups. This in later years will evolve into the marching band who in turn will be a part of the quadrennial circuses in the twentieth century. One of the most significant programs — The Normal Lecture Course — was initiated by Principal Philips in the school year. Continuing into present times, this brought to the campus prominent men and women from all professional areas of life to give talks and presentations to the students. Included were three United States Presidents; Theodore Roosevelt, William Taft and Woodrow Wilson. Performers, artists, political figures, and all categories of prominent Americans participated in this vital Normal Lecture Course. Principal Philips had been diligently searching for a Director for the New Gymnasium. To finalize his efforts he and several of the trustees visited Dr. William G. Anderson at his Brooklyn School of Physical Culture. There interviews were held with Dr. Anderson and Dr. Ehinger concerning the latter's potential for the new position. On 28 April Dr. Philips noted the end of the search resulted in the employment of Dr. Clyde E. Ehinge- as Director. His wife Ella would also be employed as an associate. A number of news releases with photographs were made in reference to this by Principal Philips. In addition a series of cards with color printing concerning the appointment of Dr. and Mrs. Ehinger as well as information concerning the new facility were mailed or distributed to students, alumni and the general public.

He served two years as intern in Cook County Hospital after which he practiced medicine in Chicago for two years. He married Ella M. Long of Quincy, Iowa on October 16, 1883. After practicing medicine in Quincy for five years he and his wife decided to enter a new field — The practice of hygiene and physical training. Enrolling in the Anderson Normal School of Gymnastics at Brooklyn, New York they graduated in 1890. In addition they also studied at the Chautauqua Summer Program in Physical Training directed by William G. Anderson. In early spring of 1890 Dr. George M. Philips and a board member of the West Chester State Normal School accompanied by T. Roney Williamson, Philadelphia architect of the new gymnasium came to the Anderson School to select a Director of Physical Training. They chose Dr. Clyde E.

Anderson, physical director at Yale University. While there the position of physical director of Trinity School, New York City, was offered him and accepted. After remaining there two years he was called to the head of the physical training and athletic department at Hotchkiss School (preparatory school for Yale).

Of course the new gymnasium is the great attraction this year, tt was finished early iu September ami apparatus was at once put in. And it is even finer ami more complete than any of us anticipated. I'irst in importance is the gymnasium proper which occupies the whole second iloor of the main 'iiiilduig This room is one hundred feet long and sixty feet wide, the high- est part of its ceiling being more than fifty feet ahove the floor. Twelve feet above the 'floor circles the gallery containing the running track, with its Lurus properly inclined and the track itsulf covered with felt and painted canvass., Seventeen laps to the mile, the largest indoor track yet constructed ill America. The lighting of this room deserves special mention ; there is •lothing like it elsewhere. The great windows on all sides of the building, ind the four large sky-lights in the roof show that the Building Committee heeded Dr. Sargent's advice in that direction. While at night the electric iight lights up every part of the building almost as brightly. In front of the uiain building is an annex containing the main entrance and the staircases ■eading both up and down. On one side of the entrance are a neatly furn- ;shed reception room am! an office for the Director ; ou the other side is the examination room. In the basement of the annex is a handsomely ap- pointed toilet room with marble trimmings and the best of fixtures. Oppo- site to it is the shower room, with its half-dozen shower baths, hot or cold at pleasure and varying iu form and effect. This room is the especial delight of the boys. Communicating with the shower room by way of a hot room is •.he great swimming-pool, forty by twenty feet, and holding more than twenty thousands gallons of water. It is deep enough everywhere for swim- ming, yet not deep enough to drown one. The water is well wanned and frequently changed. Beyond the pool is the locker-room, with one hundred ind thirty lockers, each five feet high, fitted with keyless locks, open brass doors, and galvanized wire netting tops and bottoms. Coils of steam-pipes run underneath the lockers to dry oflf the clothing. Next comes the alley- room with its three bowling-alleys fitted up in the best manner and of course never idle. And just beyond is the ball cage, sixty feet long, thoroughly lighted and so surrounded by wire netting that nothing can be injured as the base ball players practice pitching, catching, and even batting. The appa- ratus was put in by the Narragansett Machine Company, of Providence, R. I., now the leading manufacturers of gymnasium apparatus in this country. Every useful variety of apparatus is found, all of the best quality, and in large quantity. There are forty-two pairs of chest-weights, one hundred pairs of dumb bells, one hundred pairs of Indian clubs, two sets of travelling rings with eight rings iu each set, four sets of parallel bars, two vaulting horses and buck, four rowing machines, together with breast-bars, traveling parallels, vaulting bars, capstan, wrist and finger machines, striking-bags, climbing ropes ami poles, etc. The total cost of the apparatus has been more than £3000, while the gymnasium itself and its equipment have cost over 530.000. All students are given a thorough physical examination by Dr. or Mrs. Hhinger. This includes the measurement of every part of the body, the testing of the lungs, heart, eyes, etc. More than sixty different examinations and records are made for each person. The rules of the American Associa- tion for Physical Culture are followed in these examinations and the record of their results. On Mondays, Wednesdays and alternate Fridays, from Sa. m. until 3. 15 p. ill., the young men go to the gymnasium in classes, each lasting three-quarters of an hour, and are systematically drilled by Dr, Ehiuger, all of the young man being expected to do this work. At 3.15 the ladies from West Chester, to the number of forty or more, have their class work under Mrs. Ehin^er, while from four until six the young ladies of the school and the town ladies all have the \"run\" of the gymnasium, swimming, bowling, or exercising at pleasure, but under Mrs. Ehinger's direction always. On Tuesdays, Thurs- days, and the other Fridays, the young ladies have their class-work from e'ght until a quarter past three, while from four until six the whole building is given up to the boys, Dr. Ehiuger being always there with the young men. On Saturdays it is also open for voluntary work, while in the evenings a large class of young men from town take the advantage of the unusual ad- vantages here offered them. This program is found to work admirably. The gymnasium is in constant use, day and night, and every student _has an opportunity to use it every day. It need scarcel v be said that the gymnasium is exceedingly popular with the students And the excellent effects are shown in the fact that there have been fewer sick than ever before, while Steward Johnson reports that the consumption of provision has increased alarmingly. Nothing connected with the gymnasium is a greater success than its di- rectors. Dr. and Mrs. Ehiuger. The Doctor, by his line physique, his medi- cal training and practice, and by his special training for this work, is exactly suited to it. He is an excellent gymnast and a natural leader. Mrs. Ehinger. like her husband, is thoroughtv fitted bv nature and experience for her work with the girls. Both are exceedingly popular. In fact we believe that we have here at West Chester State Normal School the very best gymnasium in this country, and that its directors and equipments are also the best to be [bund, audit might not be amiss to add that we speak from a pretty general knowledge of the subject too.

The basement, 12 feet high, contains a swimming pool, 40x20 feet, holding about 20,000 gallons of water, which is warmed be- fore running into it; three bowling alleys; a ball cage for practice at ball in cold weather; a large number of lockers for clothing, shower- baths, dressing rooms, etc. Above is the main gymnasiuui, lOOxGO feet, the ceiling rising to a height of 51 feet from the lloor; a running track, with canvas and felt track, encircles the room twelve feet from the tloor, with a length of seventeen laps to the mile. The gymnasium contains three thousand dollars worth of the best apparatus. A directors' office, reception room as well as examination room are in the annex and every student is care- fully measured yearly according to the rules of the American Association for the Advance- ment of Physical Culture. These comprise sixty different measurements, and test the heart, eyes, hearing, etc., carefully. The gymnasium affords complete and comprehen- sive exercise in all weathers, and has been of great value to the health and study of the students. It is in charge of a physician and his wife, who are specially trained for this work, and give their whole time to it. ^OTHE NEW GYMNASIUMS MRS. EHINGER.

Owing to the heavy expenses of building and furnishing the gymnasium, it is not at present possible to employ some one to furuish music for the exercise, hut Mrs. Khinger stated that if the Indies wished a musical accompaniment which added to the pleasure of the work- several from their number might take turns' in playing the piano. During the heavy exercise from four to fix the hrst fifteen minutes of the time mightbe given to dancing, whi-h is a health- ful form of exercise, but no more time could be spared lor this pleasure. A number of the la- lesri mained to watch the movements •>r the students after -1 o'clock, and they also explored the regions of the basement aud admired all parts of the fine building.

The successful completion of the gym- nasium building was regarded as reason for congratulation. The com- mittee reported that some work is yet to be done in the way of fitting the building np with the necessary appliances for a first class gymnasium. On motion a committee was appointed to cooperate with Prof. Philips and Dr. C. E. Ehinger in arranging for a formal opening of the building as soon as it shall be entirely fitted np. The com- mittee as appointed consists of H. B. Bock- waiter Major L. G. McCanley. Charles M. Crowell, Prof. George M. Philips and Dr. C. r.. l.hinger.

If thev had played 'Homo Sweet Home' like that about three weeks ago, we wouldn't have been cured of the homesickness yet.\" The Jlouros will present a good pro- gramme in the auditorium this eveuiu\" at 7:30. Mr. Ehinger has divived the boys who take exercise after four o'clock into a num. her of classes, each with an appointed lender to whom spocial training is given. Each class works for about fifteen minutes at one form of exercise, and then goes to something else. In this way much time is saved aud the Doctor is better enabled to give instruction.

On Tuesdays, Thurs- days, and the other Fridays, the young ladies have their class-work from y'ght until a quarter past three, while from four until six the whole building is given up to the boys, Dr. Ehinger being always there with the young men. On Saturdays it is also open for voluntary work, while in the evenings a large class of young men from town take the advantage of the unusual ad- vantages here offered them. This program is found to work admirably. The gymnasium is in constant use, day and night, and every student has an opportunity to use it every day. It need scarcel v be said that the gymnasium is exceedingly popular with the students And the excellent effects are shown in the fact that there have been fewer sick than ever before, while Steward Johnson reports that the consumption of provision has increased alarmingly. Nothing connected with the gymnasium is a greater success than its di- rectors, Dr. and Mrs. Ehinger. The Doctor, by his fine phvsique, his medi- cal training and practice, and by his special training for this work, is exactly suited to it. He is an excellent gymnast and a natural leader. Mrs. Ehinger. like her husband, is thoroughly fitted by nature and experience for her work with the girls. Both are exceedingly popular. In fact we believe that we have here at West Chester State Normal School the vcr.- best gymnasium in ■Jus country, and that its directors and equipments are also the best to be lOUiiil, and it might not be amiss to add that we speak from a pretty general knowledge of the subject too.
