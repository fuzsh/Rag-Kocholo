Although the target audience of \"WiLD 98.7\" is white, African American, and Hispanic females 18-34, its main competitor is currently Clear Channel-owned Mainstream Urban, WBTP, \"95.7 the Beat\". WLLD's transmitter is located in Seminole, Florida.\n\nStation history\n\nThe kayfabe line is that the station was started by two boys, Josh and Brian, on their father's boat during the first half of 1998. It was also stated to be contraband and irregulated airwaves until they were bought and turned into what is now the station that is broadcast today. In reality, the station just had a very small budget to start with, often resulting in the same songs playing over and over again.\n\nAt first, WLLD's musical direction included a balanced mix of hit-driven R&B/Hip-Hop and Dance tracks, mostly to counter rival WFLZ, a move that would pay off up until WBTP (WFLZ's sister station) debuted. Today, the station's playlist is atypical of most rhythmics as it consists of mostly hip-hop and R&B hits, thus is considered to be a \"rhythmic crossover\" by \"Billboard\".\n\nLine Up\n\n6am - 10am Orlando and the Freakshow ( with Orlando, Gordie, Paco, Navaho, and Special Ed )10am - 2pm Scantman 2pm - 6pm Alli that Girl6pm - 10pm The Nuthouse ( with Buckwheat )10pm - 2am Stiffy & the I Love Beer Show\n\nThe Last Damn Show and WiLDsplash\n\nThe Last Damn Show is an annual concert put on by \"WiLD 98.7\" WLLD in the Tampa Bay Area. It is put on in late October or early November every year since 1999. The show got its title from being the \"last damn show\" before the world ended in Y2K. Hence, in continuation with the world remaining unscathed. Past performers include Eminem, Destiny's Child, P. Diddy, Busta Rhymes, Bubba Sparxxx, Lil Jon and the Eastside Boyz, Trick Daddy, Luke] , Ludacris, Kanye West, and Twista among others. The concert was originally held at The St. Pete Times Forum, but is now held in the more spacious Tropicana Field. It has pulled in over 20,000 in attendance almost every year.\n\nWiLDsplash is the annual concert during spring break out on by WiLD 98.7 WLLD in Clearwater Beach. It has been a Bay Area staple since 2001 and pulls crowds in excess of 15,000 fans consistently. Past performers Busta Rhymes, Bubba Sparxxx, 50 Cent, Sean Paul, Buju Banton, JoJo, 112, Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, Ziggy Marley, Young Jeezy, Stephen & Damien Marley among others.\n\nThe 'WILD' branding\n\nWLLD uses the \"WiLD\" branding in Tampa. The crazy and irreverent presentation and interaction with the audience is in the truest since \"WiLD\". The brand has since been trademarked by Clear Channel Communications years later since the debut of WLLD, which is due to Clear Channel owning KYLD/San Francisco, who has used the \"WiLD\" branding since their launch in 1992.\n\nWhen \"WiLD 98.7\" was started, the first song played was Tone-Loc's \"Wild Thing\", hence the station's branding basis.\n\nStation management\n\n* Program Director Orlando Davis\n\n* Music Director Kristy Reif\n\nExternal links"
