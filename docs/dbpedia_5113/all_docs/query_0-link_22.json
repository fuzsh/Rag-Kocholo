VIDEO, AND HOME ENTERTAINMENT Brit Acts Hope To Reconquer The Hot 100 BY CORDON MASSON, MEUNDA NEWMAN, and PAUL SEXTON IX)MX)N — Ls U.K. pop masic l«sing ib fabled grip on America? The country's cultural relations with the U.S. have always been newsworthy, and nothing unites the U.K. media like a negative story. So the news that for the first time in almost 40 years there were not any U.K. artists on The Billboard Hot 100 for two consecutive issues dated April 27 and May 4 generated reams of prob- ing headlines, column inches, and the colleclive gnashing of teeth about the \"death \" of British music. \"Americans celebrate success; we tend to celebrate failure,\" says Colin Lester of Wildlife Entertainment, who manages Craig David, one of the handful of breakthrough British artists in recent years whose success flies in the face of such a reaction. The chart run began when U.K. duo the Caravelles debuted on the Hot 100 in the Nov. 2, 1963, issue with \"You Don't Have to Be a Baby enters the Hot 1 00 at No. 84 (see Sin- gles Minded, page 57). Optimistic commentators also point to an encouraging schedule of releases in the coming months by artists with to Cry\" and came to a pause in the April 27 is.sue. But ju.st two weeks later, the drought is over, as \"Days Co By\" from Capitol's U act Dirty Vegas substantial U.S. track records, in- cluding Coldplay; the Prodigy; Mas- sive Attack; seasoned campaigners David Bowie, Phil Collins, and Robert Plant; and, later in the year, David, Dido, and David Cray. Additionally, such acts as Oasis, BBMak, Beth Orton, Badly Drawn Boy, Morcheeba, and Doves are revis- iting the U.S. with new albunvs, while hopefuls Kd Har- court, the Music, Al, lx)StProphets, and the Electric Soft Parade are among those try- ing to establish (an bases in America. Several initiatives backed by the U.K. government aimed at b(H)Sting the British pre.sence in the U.S. are emerging, while charts worldwide have showcased writers Paul Barry and Mark Taylor — on hits by both Cher and Enrique Iglesias — and Cathy Dennis and Kob Davis, com- posers and producers of Kylie Minogue's \"Can't Get You out of My Head\" (Capitol), which peaked at No. 7 on the Hot 100. Minogue's continuing preserKe on the Hot 100 represents a hit very much made in Britain, and the Aus- tralian artist's resurgence in fortunes owes much to the hard work of Par- lophone in the U.K. Andy Slater, who became president of Capitol U..S. one (Continued on page 70) Dead Live On In Touring Legacy BY RAY WADDELL NASHVILLE — Over the course of the long, strange his- tory of rock touring, there has never been an act quite like the Grateful Dead — a band which, largely without the benefit of the Internet, hit albums, radio airplay, music videos, or even mainstream acceptance, grew steadily for 30 years to become one of the top touring acts ever. Spawned from San Francisco's 1960s counterculture scene, the Grate- ful Dead had built a touring industry unto itself by the mid-1990s. Stadium- level stalwarts reliant on neither current albums nor popular whim, the Dead grossed $285 million from 1990 to '95, well more than any other act during that period. Nearly 8 million peo- ple .saw the Dead's 530-plus concerts in the five years preceding frontrran Jerry Garcia's death in 1995 and the subsequent breakup of the band. Its devoted followers — the celebrated Deadheads who not only followed the band from concert to concert but also built a cottage parking-lot industry — still it. as evidenced by an active Internet pres- ence, plentiful album reissues, and a con- tinuing audience for surviving band member projects. But a multitudinous live mani- I testation geared toward one band. ' such as the Dead enjoyed, does not currently exist. Rather, the ongoing legacy of the Grateful Dead is a thriv- ing yet splintered \"jam band \" scene ed by such artists as Trey Anastasio, his band Phish (currently on open-ended hia- tus). String Cheese Incident, Widespread Panic, Dave Matthews Band, and others. Additionally, (Continued on page 69) ^//////t/iiiiiiif^ Geffen'sWeezaOn'Maladroit' BYWESORSHOSN NEW YORK— Weezer frontman Ri- vers CuoriKj is on the phone from Los Angeles, listing the positive results of both a recent spat with the band's la- bel, Geffen/lnterscope - concerning the forthcoming AfaiwArwy (May 14) — and the group's decision last year to cut loose its manager, when a call comes in on another phone. \"Wait, here's the record company now, \" says Cuomo, who has managed the hand himself for nnu^ily a year, stfjp- ping mid-sentence to put his phone's receiver to the speaker of his answer- ing machine, on which a top Interscope exec is leaving a private message.

Ken SdilagcT, tocSen Somiwr IMRdor id RoeardL Mkhad EKs Working In The House Wanamaker Built \"The merchant,\" wrote legendary department store magnate John Wanamaker in the 1920s, \"must be big enough, broad enough, far-seeing enough to survey the whole field and then stand as a bulwark amid the confusions, heresies, and fears of his times.\" These words come to mind amid this era of upheaval in the entertainment, retail, and media spheres because Billboard and the rest of the VNU Business Media family (whose properties include Back Stage, Amusement Business, Kirkus Reviews, The Hollywood Reporter, Editor & Publisher, Adweek. Brandweek, Watson-Guptill Publications, Display & Design Ideas, Architec- ture, and Retail Merchandiser) has been headquartered since June 2000 in the legendary Wanamaker building, which occupies the entire block of Eighth and Ninth streets between Broadway and Astor Place in Greenwich Village. The mammoth ivory-stone edifice was once America's largest department store, a New York .satellite of the retail empire developed by Wanamaker, the German- Scotch son of a Philadelphia bricklayer. As a budding mass merchant, Wanamaker transformed his lucra- tive trade in the Civil War-fueled innovation of stan- dardized army uniforms (he himself was exempt from the draft due to ill health) into the peacetime production of men's and boys' clothing. The Philadel- phia shopkeeper-turned-departmcnt-store-vision- ary — who al.so greatly improved the efficiency of the U.S. Postal Service while postmaster general from 1889 to 1893— extended his retail realm to New York in 1896, two years after the founding of Billboard. The elegant, high-ceilinged structure was Wana- maker's flagship emporium, and it featured a huge restaurant, a 1,300-seat auditorium, a soaring atri- um containing a 24-room mansion's worth of home-furnishing displays dubbed \"The House Pala- tial,\" and a pioneering charge-account service for the daily swarm of patrons. Atop the building was a transmitting station for the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Co. When British ocean liner RMS Titanic sank in the North Atlantic on the night of April 14-15, 1912, after hitting an iceberg, one of the three telegraph operators on duty at the Wanamaker build- ing's Marconi station the next day was young David Samoff (future president of Radio Corp. of America and the creator of the Nation- al Broadcasting Co.). Samoff and his co-workers \"captured scores of messages concerning the wreck,\" according to accounts of the horror in the New York American newspaper, which negotiated an arrangement with Wanamaker that secured exclusive rights to the raOT/fc-related intercepts of ship-to-ship telegraph relay reports. A distraught Vincent Astor, the son of author/inventor/Spanish- American War veteran Col. John Jacob Astor IV, ran into the Wanamaker lobby seeking information on the plight of his father, who had been a first-class passenger on the Titanic along with his second wife, Madeleine. She was saved in Lifeboat No. 4, which had been gallantly reserved for women and children. But the colonel went down with the 1,495 others who perished on the great liner, his body recovered by the cable-ship McKay-Bennett music TO MY EARS BY HMOIHY WHITE It seems odd that a joint box-office/record-business bonanza like Paramount Pictures/20th Century Fox's 1997 Titanic film and Sony's soundtrack album could earn hundreds of millions of dollars and rekindle a global cultural obsession and yet inspire scant lingering reflection only a few years later about the tragedy itself. We can reap cash from romanticized calamity and then coldly re-shelve it. Perhaps it's a reminder that, in the words of George Bernard Shaw, \"There are two tragedies in life. One is to lose your heart's desire. The other is to gain it.\" The Fates are eager and unsentimental in the modem world of media and entertainment, where supposed strategic corporate mar- vels like AOL Time Warner and Vivendi Universal post first-quarter losses of $54.2 billion and $15.4 billion, respectively, as each reduces the value of their recent rites of conglomeration. Vivendi must yet reduce $29 billion of debt, but the charge AOL Time Warner took _ is truly epic when one realizes it exceeds the com- bined profits generated by Time Inc., Warner, or AOL in their entire separate or amalgamated existences. Meanwhile all the half-baked Internet/broadband/ telecom .schemes that both conglomerates were grafted together to exploit still remain flighty, at best. In its own fashion, the Wanamaker building has seen such main-chance media hustling before, hav- ing been the location — during (he 19f>()s TV boom — of the scrappy, low-budget DuMont Network. The original \"'fourth network\" that aimed to take on CBS, NBC, and ABC, DuMont was compelled to utilize UllF affiliates at a time when UHF was a poor risk, and it finally folded in 1 956. But while at their Wana- maker address in the early '50s, the DuMont studios were the site of two of the most popular TV shows in the land; Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen's inspira- tional Life Is Worth Living (which consisted of little more than Roman Catholic sermonizing before a grammar-school-type blackboard), as well as Captain Video, a cut- rate children's \"space opera\" whose intergalactic props were usu- ally concocted from the tubular piping and spare car parts for sale in Wanamaker's hardware and automotive departments. As for the Wanamaker .stores them-selves, the chain continued to define exceptional urban retailing in America through the post-World War II period, with John Wanamaker 111 serving as president of the family firm. But the New York store was sold in 1955, and the land- mark Philadelphia building was taken over by Lord & Taylor in 1997. By then, of course, founder John Wanamaker was long gone. In December 1922, as construction had begun on an expansion of the Wanamaker complex between Broadway and Astor Place, Wanamaker penned a note to the commander of the Salvation Army in New York, saying, \"Conditions continue that seem to tan- gle up the world and business, but God lives and loves his peo- ple, and better days are coming. \" On December 12, Wanamaker died in Philadelphia at 84 due to complications from a bad cold. But he left behind a droll homily about the fortunes of being an entrepreneur in the quest for fickle, demanding consumers. \" I know half the money 1 spend on advertising is wasted,\" he once and reaching New York May 1, exactly 90 years ago this week. mused, \"but 1 can never figure out which half.\" LOOKING FOR YOUNG PLAYERS IN lAZZ \"Where are the young jazz instrumental- ists of today?,\" to quote Chris Morris' lead on \" Jazz Seeks Inslmmental Stars\" \\Billboard, April 20). You won't find them talking to executives like Matt Pierson, Jeff Jones, and Ron Goldstein. When you quote Jones as say- ing, \"1 would love to be able to find the next Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Thelonius Monk, Miles Davis,\" it suggests he looks to the past and that these corporate giants would support them in their genesis. There are great jazz instrumentalists out there. You'll find them by listening, not studying the talance sheet. Robert D. Rusdi Producer, Cadence Jazz/CIMP Records Redwood, N.Y LOOKING FOR NEW TALENT IN JERSEY While I've had a lot of success since start- ing my own journey in the world of music — my new CD is titled . . . and the pursuit of happiness (Loud Philosophy Records/ paulbrubaker.com) — it's ediftiing to read a column like Timothy White's \"Miles of Masic, Years of Ears\" j Music to My Ears, Billboard, April 13] and be reminded of what's most important. His final thought says it all: True happiness and great popular music come from \"an educated heart.\" PitA Brubaker Montdair, NJ. LOOKING FOR NEW PLAYERS IN TOURING After reading \"New Players Emerge in Unstable Touring Biz\" in Billboard!, April 27 issue, 1 have to strongly disagree with Steve Martin of the Agency Group, who stated, \"1 think the agencies probably spend more money as far as man hours develop- ing artists than labels or promoters.\" There're countless hours of investment by label personnel involved in finding talent, recording, mixing, packaging, advertising, marketing, radio promotion, securing P&P, building Web sites, shooting videos, book- ing TV, tour support, etc. Let's not forget all the empty scats a promoter has to eat when they're developing an artist in their respective markets.

The first Star Wars soundtrack remains the highest-charting set of the series. Later called /4 New Hope, that initial album spent three weeks at No. 2 in summer 1977. The second-highest chart- ing album of the five soundtracks is Star Wars Efrisode I: The Phan- tom Menace, which cruised at light speed to No. 3 in May 1999. In third place is The Empire Strikes Back. That soLindtrack to the second Star Wars film peaked at No. 4 in 1980. The only album to peak outside the top 10 is the soundtrack to the third of George Lucas' epics: Return of theJedi had to set- tle for a No. 20 posting in 1983. On the Top .Soundtracks chart Clones has enough of the force behind it to enter at No. 1, knocking 7?ieScofpKOT/fti9 off its throne after only one week. 77ic Scorpion King toppled O Brother, Where Art Thou.' — which dominated the chart for 33 non-consecutive weeks. It is thus only the third soundtrack to top the album chart in 2002 and the eighth since the chart was initiated in June 2001. WESHND BOYS: The 12th chart entry by the Pet Shop Boys is the duo's highest-charting album on The Billboard 200 in almost six years. Release (Sanctuary) opens at No. 73. That bests the No. 84 ranking of the U.K. outfit's last set. Nightlife, which stopped at No. 84 in November 1999. Their last album to lare better than Release was Bilingual, which went as high as No. 39 in September 1996. The Pet Shop Boys now have a chart span of 15 years and 1 1 months, dating back to the debut of Mease in June 1986. That first album remains the duo's highest-charting album to date, with a peak position of No. 7. RUl£ BRITANNIA: While there is only one U.K. act on The Billboard I lot 100 (see story, page 1), there's no shortage of artists from across the pond on The Billboard 200. Along with the Pe» Shop Boys, there are debuts this is.suc from EKis CosteDo (.see Over the Counter page 57) and Sarah Bii^tman. The former Mrs. Andrew Uovd Webber opens at No. 146 with A'rjcorE (Really Use(uH)ecca Broadway). Bright- man's best performance to date on the album chart is the No. I7peak of La Lurta in September 2000. Erxx)re, her sixth album to appear on The Billboard 200, enters the Top Classical Crossover chart at No. 2. Brightman usually peaks at No. 1 on this chart, but she had the bad luck to debut the same week as the soundtrack to S^or liiirs £iptsod^ //: Attack of the Clones, which has a Death Star grip on No. 1 . Brightman has three albums in the top 10 of the Crossover chart as Classics drops 2-5 and La Luna slips 7-9.

On their own, Viacom's first-quar- ter results don't impress. The New York-based company — which owns cable channels MTV, VHl, and BET along with Infinity Radio, the CBS TV In The News • DistributiorVretall veteran Court- ney Proffitt has been named execu- tive director of the Assn. for Inde- pendent Music (AFTM). She takes the reins at the indie trade group Monday (6). She succeeds Jeanne Oberstar, who joined AFIM last Nov- ember, following the July resigna- tion of former executive director Pat Bradley miboard, Dec. 15, 2001). Oberstar steps down for personal reasons. Proffitt comes to AFIM network. Paramount Pictures, and Simon & Schuster — reported $5.67 billion in revenue, down 1.4% from the same period last year. It had a net loss of $1.11 billion, or 63 cents per diluted share, on a $1.48-billion good- will-impairment charge at its Block- buster video unit By contrast, Vivendi Universal, which reported a 12.2% increase in first-quarter rev- enue in its media and communica- tions business {Billboard. May 4), has seen its New York-listed shares lose about 44% of their value this year. Yet Viacom \"stands out just for not having made the big mistakes\" some of its peers did. says Edmund Cowart, a portfolio manager with St. Peters- burg, Fla.-based Eagle Asset Manage- ment, which owTied about 300,000 Via- com shares at year's end. While investors may be confused by Vivendi and AOL Time Warner's ability to monetize their Internet assets, he says, \"people understand radio, they under- stand outdoor advertising, and they understand cable TV.\" VIACOM Investors and Wall Street observers laud Viacom's ability to cross-market its media outlets to advertisers. Of greater worth at the moment — when investors are wary of what companies say and the numbers they report — is its seasoned management, led by chair- man/CEO Sumner Redstone and pres- ident/COO Mel Karmazin. Redstone and Karmazin possess clashing work- ing styles and per- sonalities and have feuded. But they own many shares — Redstone con- trols 68.2% of Via- com's voting stCKk — which puts their interests in line with shareholders. And they are backed by strong division heads, such as MTV Networks chair- man/CEO Tom Freston. Predicting the ad market can be hard: Viacom saw it getting better last summer, until the Sept. 11 attacks led it to reduce financial fore- casts for the year and pushed its share price from near $60 to $30. If it improves, as the company predicts, the fortunes of Viacom sharehold- ers — including Redstone and Kar- mazin — may rise a little fiirther. from an 11-year association with BMG Distribution. She joined BMC as Los Angeles branch assistant in 1990 and later worked as a sales rep and national account exec in Las Vegas; Dallas; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; and Tempe, Ariz. With the appoint- ment, AFIM will move its head- quarters from LA to Tempe. • Sources say there is some nrove- ment between the Recording Artist Coalition (RAC) and major labels in discussions about changes in the damages section of the industry's caiveout in California's seven-year personal contract law. That .statute allows a label to sue an artist who leaves after seven years for all poten- tially optioned undelivered albums. RAC wanted the damages section renmved altogether, the labels want- ed no change. Now, negotiators have proposed that a label can sue if there is even one undelivered album; RAC has proposed that a label only be allowed to .sue if there are two. No agreement has been reached. If negotiations fail, California State Senator Kevin Murray (D-Culver City) will ask for a committee vote later this month on his pending bill to remove the industry carveout. • The U.S. TVade Representative has once again cited Ukraine as a high- est-level Priority Foreign Country for its massive involvement in the manufacturing of counterfeit CDs.

BY GAIL MITCHELL LOS ANGELES— The popular Now That's What I Call Music (Now!) series is spinning off an R&B/hip-hop ver- sion called Off the Hook. Nowl part- ners Sony, Universal, EMI, and Jive are behind this black music offshoot, which bows May 21 with a 20-track compilation under the Columbia/ Sony umbrella. \"Research has shown a strong demand for a series skewed to R&B and tiip-hop, \" Columbia senior VP of urban music and urban A&R Marc Jordan explains. \"With Off the Hook, we're hoping to create another brand parallel to the original Now! series that will be important to the core R&B and hip- hop audience.\" The series' debut installment, CW the Hook, includes such recent hits as Jen- nifer Lopez's \"I'm Real (Murder Remix featuring Ja Rule).\" Aaliyah's 'More Than a Woman,\" and Mr. Cheeks' \"Lights, Camera, Action!\" — as well as such current chart-climbers as Ruff Endz's \"Someone to Love You\" and Angie Stone's \"Wish I Didn't Miss You.\" The compilation lists for $18.98 (CD) and $12.98 (cassette). \"We try to identify tracks that are current hits or building,\" Jordan says. \"Consumers are very sophisti- cated. They know if you're putting on filler tracks. \" The kickoff marketing campaign for Off the Hook wil I encompass TV, print. and trade advertising; giveaways at crossover, rhythm, and R&B radio; consumer and trade magazine features; street-team promotions; and Web site tie-ins through offthehooknow.com. Because of its specialized focus and the extensive promotional campaign that's being mounted tiehind it, Ming Sing — buyer for Tower Records/Video in San Francisco — thinks Off the Hook should see sales success. \"\"I expect medium to heavy sales,\" she predicts. \"Because it includes tracks not released as singles and some that aren't even played on the radio, it will do well against all the other compilations on the market.\" According to Jordan, plans are still being worked out concerning the series' future release schedule and whether the compilations will share R&B/hip-hop tracks with future Noiv! collections. Launched in 1998. Now! — in its ninth incarnation in the U.S. — has sold nearly 25 million units combined, according to SoundScan. Now! 9 cur- rently stands at 1.5 million units, with Now! 10 coming in July from Sony. Competing compilation series Totally Hits, a partnership between Arista Records and Warner Music Group, debuted in 1999. Through four releas- es, including Totally Hits 2001. the pop series has sold slightly more than 5 mil- lion units. The Totally Hits series also includes the 2001 offshoot Totally Dance and 2002's Totally Country. BY UILA COBO MIAMI — ^As the Latin American music market endures what may be its worse crisis ever, Sony Music In- ternational's (SMI) Latin America division has announced a series of strategic changes designed to strengthen the company's position in the region. Spearheaded by Frank Welzer — who this week was appointed SMI Latin America chairman/CEO after serving nine years as presi- dent — changes include the cre- ation of Sony Music Sur, a new geographic sub-region compris- ing Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay. Sony Music Sur will be headed by managing director Jorge \"Pepo\" Ferradas, who is also managing director of Sony Music Argentina. \"We're going to have a blended, seamless organization in Sur,\" says Welzer, who modeled the new sub- region after Sony Musk CEV (Colom- bia, Ecuador, Venezuela), launched late last year and headed by Sony's managing director in Colombia, Carlos Gutierrez. \"We'll have one strategic marketing approach and simultaneous releases in that terri- tory.\" All of Sony's Latin American companies, as well as U.S.-based Sony Discos, continue to report to Welzer, who reports to SMI presi- dent Rick Dobbis. While Welzer's new title does not alter his duties, it recognizes his lead- ership of the company. Under Welz- er, Sony has developed such interna- tional acts as Shakira, Chayanne, Ricky Martin, Ricardo Arjona, and, more recently. Marc Anthony.

All Our Love, Antonio \"LA\" Reid & The Arista Family 'ial> mm NARM Backs Singles Letter Urges Labels To Keep Configuration Alive BY EO CHRISTMAN NEW YORK— With no noticeable increase in singles releases yet occur- ring since retailers maile impassioned pleas to the majors to save the dying configuration at the the National Assn. of Recording Merchandisers (NAR^l) annuiil conwntion in March. N.ARM hiis sent a letter to labtis reit- erating why a thriving singles mar- ketplace would be beneficial to the health of the industr)^ (BilltHxird liul- May 1). Moreover, NARM is taking its case to the public by issu- ing a press release on the subject. In it. NARM president Pam Horoxitz says that in a song-driwn market- place. the industry needs to offer songs for sale: other- wise, fans will get them from the In- ternet for free. The NARM letter lists numerous reasons why singles should still be available: They provide an entry-level price point for young miisic fans, they mark the start of a record collection, they get young consumers into the habit of paying for music, and they help consumers establish the habit of going to the record store. The letter also points out that sin- gles are an important promotional t(X)l. and the)' can bi' a profit center. Finally, the letter adds that without singles for .sale, today's music fan will get the .songs anyway by downloading them for free, and fewer configura- tions for .sale translates into less space in stores to sell music and more space allocated to other products. Horovit2 said in a statement. \"If you want young people to get into the habit of paying for music and not think of it as being for free, we must offer them as many opportunities as we can to buy music at entry-level price points they can al'ford.\" .Acknowledging label laments that singles are no longer profitable, she urged the majors to be creative in tn'ing to achieve ways to make the single prof- itable while satisfying consumer demand for the configuration. There are a variety of approaches that warrant consideration as mechanisms which could help make singles more profitable, including on-site destruc- tion of returns, multiple B-sides, or return penalties, or even one-way sales,\" Horovitz stated. Moreover, she pointed out that some labels are e\\'al- uating redefining the single, with some suggesting that some combina- tions of multiple songs could .sell at a lower price point that might satisfy consumer demand. Horovitz tells Billboard that she plans to follow up the letter with phone calls to labels to keep dialogue open on the issue. 1 r A V^^L. \" ^ ill •J V ^ Ik 1 REID 1 \\ RICHARDSON | RECORD C0NRW4IES: VUerie DeLong is promoted to senior VP of promo- tion for Universal Records in Los Angeles.

NARAS Enters A Post-Greene Era BY MEUNDA NEWMAN LOS ANGELES — National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS) chairman of the board of trustees Garth Fundis, along with CFO Susan Leary, COO Paul Tsuchiya, and other key senior management staff, will be running the day-to-day duties of NARAS following pres- ident/CEO Michael Greene's resignation April 27. NARAS director of communications Ron Roecker says a .search committee is being assembled to find a new acad- emy head. The issue will be discussed further at an already-slated trustees meeting set for the third week of May in Hawaii. Greene, who headed NARAS for 14 years, resigned during an eight-hour emergency board meeting in l^s Angeles, which was called to disclose the findings of a sexual harassment investigation ordered by the trustees after the nonprof- it group paid $6.S0,000 to a former NARAS staffer who had accused Greene of sexual abuse. Greene denied the allegations, as well as two other sexual abuse accusations by former employees. According to a statement by Nashville- based record producer Fundis, the investigation \"revealed no sexual harassment, no sex discrimination, and no hos- tile work environment at the Recording Academy.\" Roecker declined to comment on why Greene resigned if he had been found innocent by the probe. The sexual abuse settlement was one of several red flags raised concerning Greene during the past several years. In 1997, Greene signed a record deal with Mercury Records but never released the album he recorded after he came under fire for potential conflicts of interest. He has also been criticized for the high percentage of money raised by NARAS' charitable arm MusiCares that went to administrative costs. Additionally, Dick Clark sued Greene earlier this year, alleging that Greene interfered with the Clark-produced American Music Awards (AMAs) by telling artists they could not perform at both the AMAs and the Grammy Awards. On April 30, Clark said through a statement that following Greene's resignation, it would \"probably not be necessary\" to go forward with a suit now. Despite such turmoil, Greene is also credited with greatly increasing NARAS' profile and pocketbook. The nonprofit organization grew from 3,500 to 17,000 members and saw its assets increa.se from $4.9 million to $50 million during his reign, l^st year, Greene also renegotiated a deal with CBS (which broadcasts the Grammys) that reportedly pays NARAS more than $20 million annually. Greene, who is reported to be receiving a settlement of up to $8 million, will contin- ue to work out of NARAS' Santa Monica, Calif., offices as a consultant on a full-time basis through September and on a part- time basis until after next February's Gram- my ceremony, according to Roecker. Roecker would not comment on Greene's severance package. But NARAS members say they find such a payout if the amount is correct, to be out of line. \"I 'm troubled by anyone getting rich in the nonprofit sector where revenues are supposed to be diverted to worthy pursuits, \" one NARAS member and 2001 Grammy winner says. Another voting member agrees. '1 think Mike's done a really good job, but what I don't love as a member of the organization is the severance package. That seems outrageously rich.\" In an e-mail sent to many of his business colleagues April 28, Greene wrote, \"With the investigation behind me and soon looking squarely into the face of 14 years as Academy president and being the Grammy guy, [my resignation] was a decision that my boys and I came to last week and are very much at peace [with] . . . It's all good, honest!\" Neither Greene nor FUndis had returned calls by press time. TLCs Lopes Remembered As 'BriUianV BY RHONDA BARAKA and RASHAUN HALL ATLANTA— The world of R&B and hip- hop was dealt a crushing blow with the April 25 death of Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes. A member of the Grammy Award-win- ning trio TLC. Lopes died in a car acci- dent while vacationing in Honduras. Kevin \"She'kspere\" Briggs, who pro- duced \"No Scrubs \" and was tapped to work on the new TLC album, describes Lopes as \"nothing short of brilliant.\" Briggs tells Billboard. \"She wasn't just some flighty individual that didn't know what was going on or didn't have any sense or clue of what she was doing. Whatever she did, she planned it she focused on it and she made it work to her advantage.\" Former TLC manager Ian Burke says Lopes \"was a special individual\" who'd \"give you the shirt off her back. \" According to reports. Lopes, 30, was in Honduras on vacation with her fem- ily when the driver of her rental car lost control and crashed on a highway a few miles from her condo. Lopes rose to fame with TLC in the early '90s. The group scored its first hit in 1992 with \"Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg,\" which peaked at No. 6 on The Billboard Hot 100. The group's three albums, 1992 s Ooooooohhh ...On the TLC Tip. \\mi,'%CrazySexyCool.sni 1999's Fanmait. sold more than 14 million albums collectively, according to SoundScan. TLC had recently been in the studio working on a new record, due to have been released this summer It was rumored that Lopes had signed a solo deal on Suge Knight's Tha Row imprint Knight would not com- ment on the signing, but he did release a statement regarding Lopes' passing. \"Even though |Tha Row| cut songs with her, the last thing on my mind is to release any material right away ... I think that it is a sad thing to turn tragedy into treasure.\" Antonio \"\"LA. \" Reid, president/CEO of Arista Records — label home to TLC — also released a statement; \"Lisa was not only a gifted and talented musi- cal inspiration, but more importantly, she was like a daughter to me.\" Her fellow band members and life- long friends Tionne \"T-Boz\" Watkins and Rozanda \"Chilli \" Thomas released a statement via Bill Diggins, their cur- rent manager and president of Diggit Entertainment \"We had all grown up together and were as close as a family. Today we have truly lost our sister.\" Via her publicist Thomas added in a statement: \"People think of Lisa as the crazy one in TLC — well, she was crazy, but in a good way. She was a wonderful, loving, and creative person who was real smart ... I will never get over this. Every day, I jast have to try to figure out how to get over it \"As for the new CD, Lisa had already recorded three or four tracks, so she will definitely be on our next album, and it will be dedicated to her,\" Thomas continued. \"I know she would not have wanted us to stop recording. As for her being replaced — never. You can't replace a TLC giri. \" The funeral for Lopes was held May 2 at the New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Lithonia, Ga.

It's infused with black-bom musicalities, \" Me'Shell Ndegeocello says of her new Maverick album, Cookie: The Anthropological Mixtape. before reeling off such artistic influences as Richie Havens. Bob Marley, Jimi I lendrix, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Miles Davis, Joan Armatrading, TVacy Chapman, and \"the one 1 love. Prince. \" Due June 4, Cookie \"is all my experiences,\" the artist continues. \"I want- ed to show all the transitions, from Southern stride to gospel to blues to funk. Musi- cally, it comes from the Af- rican Diaspora. It's my im- provisational rhythm and blues, my exploration of self, my anthropological mix tape.\" Co-produced by the artist and her longtime guitarist Allen Cato, Cookie is, indeed, musically rich. \"I tried pro- ducing myself this lime around, but I just couldn't do it, \" acknowledges Ndegeocel- lo, whose three previous Grammy Award-nominated albums (1993's Plantation iMllabies. 1 996's Peace Beyond Pas- sion, and 1999's Bitter) were produced by David Gamson and Craig Street, among others. Recorded in the heart of San Francisco's funky Tcnderioin district (\"The studio was in the booty of the Tenderioin. That neighborhood is the vibe of this record\"). Cookie features numerous guests, including T^lib Kweli, Caron Wheeler, Lalah Hathaway, Michael Hampton, and writer/ activist Angela Davis. The set's first single, the Missy \"Misdemeanor\" Elliott and Rockwilder remix of \"Pocketbook,\" features Redman and 1\\veet. Its video was directed by Liz Friedlander Lyrically, Cookie is thoughtful, provocative, and sincere, with the singcr/songwriter/bassist tackling a range of topics from love, lust, and sex to politics, consumerism, and religion. 'These words are me, \" Ndegeocello says of such album tracks as \"Trust,\" \"God.Fear.Money,\" \"Earth,\" \"Hot Night,\" \"Berryfarms,\" and \"Pock- etbook.\" \"I only wrote what I felt about people and music I love. It's the world through my eyes; a chapter in my memoirs. Perhaps others will also feel what I'm feeling.\" Apparently, others are \"feeling \" Ndegeocello's music (published by Warner/Chappelll. \"I'm impressed with her work in general,\" says Joe Lambert, co-owner of Creative Music in San Francisco. \"But this new album is easily her strongest outing to date. It's a musically diverse recording that has the potential to reach a very wide audience without alien- ating her core fan base.\" \"Pocketbook\" was sent to urban radio the week of April 8; it will go to crossover radio the second week in June. Already, it's been embraced by such stations as WBLS New York and WUSL Philadelphia. \"The track is a healthy mar- riage of Me'Shell's funk and today's hip-hop,\" WBLS PD Vinny Brown notes. \"By hooking up with Tweet. Red- man, Missy Elliott and Rock- wilder for \"Pocketbook,' Me'Shell may very well find herself with new fans. Those who aren't hip to her fast will now be introduced to her.\" Maverick CM Fred Croshal says, \"I can only smile when I hear such things. This is the type of album — because of its many sounds — that we'll be able to market across all frontiers. \" On May 14, the artist (who is managed by Kofi Taha of Humility Profits in Los Angeles and booked by Jonathan Levine of Monterey Penin- sula Artists in Monterey, Calif.) kicks off a 15-city tour in San Francisco that lasts until June 4. which is when she's confirmed to appear on The Tonight Show With Jay l^eno. Immediately fol- lowing, Croshal notes, Ndegeocello will perform a \"late set\" at the Roxy in LA On June 5, she will appear on Last Call With Carson Daly. On June U, the label will issue Ben Watt's uptempo rembt of the track \"Earth.\" Promo singles of the mix were sent to club DJs last year, label marketing director Holly Adams explains. \"The response was so great\" she says, that we're now releasing the mix commercially. \" Little BigTown Hits Nashville Foursome's Harmony-Kdi Monument Debut Is Due In May BY PHYLUS STARK NASHVILLE — Picture a group with the physi- cal make-up of the Mamas & the Papas or ABBA and a sound reminiscent of the Eagles or Rest- less Heart, and >'ou've got Little Big Town.

It may not have been done much in this format, but we knew we could do it if we do what the song calk for and make sure we're protecting the lyric. So we just stuck to our guns on that one. even when people said. 'You're going to have to pick someone to sing lead.' We |said], 'No; just watch and listen to what we're going to do.' And luckily, it's been the very thing tfiat attracts people to us.\" After a felse start at Mercury Records that ended because of a difference in creative vision. Little Big TowTfi signed with Sony Music Nashville's Monu- ment Records in 2000 and will relea.se its epony- mous debut album May 2 1 . At Sony, the group has been given unusual latitude in following its cre- ative muse for a new act: It co-produced its album and co-wrote six of its 1 1 songs. Also guiding the album were producers Blake Chancey and Paul Worley, a.s.sociate producer David Lyndon Huff, and mix master George Massenburg. As for who sang what the group decided to let that evolve naturally. \"It's not like we start- ed out .saying we each would sing 2.5 songs,\" LiniE BIGTOWN Fairchild says. \"We just said, \"Let's take it song by song and . . . follow whose voice fit what song and what part of what song.\" \" That approach made for a lengthy recording process, as the group experimented with differ- ent voices in different parts. Another reason the record took a year-and-a-half to record is that the group realized that the typical Nashville record- ing process of \"musicians first, vocals later\" wasn't working for them. Fairchild says, \"We wanted the tracks to have drama, so we said. Let's try to do it backwards. Why not start with a layer of vocals with full arrangement and acoustic guitar?' Then |we could] bring in a drummer, bass player, whatever we wanted after that\" Little Big Town (which is booked by Creative Artists Agency and managed by Rendy I/Ovelady) says the al- bum benefited from that experimentation. Sweet says, \"It was a new experience for (Chanceyl to have four lead singers, so it was a very open, fi'ee kind of, \"Let's all experi- ment let's work till we get it right jenvinonmentl.' \" We.stbrook recalls. \"There was an open policy of, \"If we have an idea, let's try it and if it doesn't work, it doesn't work.' \" First single \"Don't Waste My Time\" jumps 40-37 on this issue's Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart The group, which collectively writes for Warner/ Chappell, wrote the song witii Irene Kelley and Clay Mills, and it has attracted radio's attention. \"I'm a believer,\" says WSM-FM (Live 95) Nashville PD Kevin O'Neal. \"I feel these guys and girls are gonna be huge.

They've kept busy by embark- ing on often sold-out European tours, issuing various live al- bums, and working on vocal col- laborations with such Dutch artists as Camden and Raymond Van het Croenewoud. Most importantly, in 2000, the band recorded its fourth stu- dio album Almost Happy — released the same year in Europe via Double T Music. Sony Music International and Red Ink have announ- ced a Stateside release of Almost Happy for May 14 — a date shortly preceding the band's May 28 arrival as an opening act for the Indigo Girls North American tour. Specific to the disc's stateside release. Almost Happy will contain a 15- track bonus live disc of material from the European K's Choice Live album (Double T Music). With the album's U.S. re- lease and confirmed sum- mer tour dates, K's Choice will have the opportunity to share its refocused brand of dusty, jangling folk-rock with American audiences — both old and new, CERING REACQUAINTED Singer/guitarist Sarah Bettens — who currently resides in Cali- fornia — realizes U.S. audiences may remember K's Choice prima- rily for it.s 1996 haunting anthem \"Not an Addict\" or from its per- formances on the Lilith Fair tour. However, Bettens views these upcoming dates as a welcome chal- lenge to reacquaint Americans with its sound. \"There's something nice about it [being the opening act]; if it was a struggle everywhere, it wouldn't be so nice,\" she says while in France during a recent tour. \"We can play for 2,000 people in Hol- land, and then go to another coun- try and play where we're not so big and completely start over again. Going back to the States |is| a nice transition because you're remind- ed that what you do is often a chal- lenge. I've always loved being the supporting act; it changes things up a bit. If we were playing stadi- ums every night we'd also be happy, but then what would be our goal after that?\" When K's Choice — managed by Wil Sharpe for Sharpe Enter- tainment Services — begins its U.S. dates, it will have more than 60 songs of material spanning four studio albums from which it could incorporate into a live performance. While past K's Choice efforts have balanced agitated, post- grunge rock with folk, jazz, and blues rhythms, Almost Happy eschews the distorted guitar and volume almost completely — opt- ing for a calmer, more gentle lis- tening experience. The album begins with a brief recording of a 5-year-old Bettens, 'Going back to the States [is] a nice transition because you 're reminded that what you do is often a challenge. If we were playing stadiums every night we 'd be happy, but then what would be our goal after that?' —SARAH BETTENS. K'S CHOICE singing a Belgian folk song a capella — this establishes the deli- cate, simple, and nostalgic tone the disc follows. While lyrically pensive, the following \"Another Year\" is filled with layers of sum- mery and jangling guitars, acous- tic brush strokes, and Betten's engaging smoky voice (often strongly reminiscent of Sarah McLaughlin), and the track shows the ability of K's Choice to create a wistful mood not overburdened with despair. The title track emerges from hushed acoustic strumming, and it momentarily taps into crunch- and-crashing drums before Bet- tens' sleepy delivery guides the wiry, smoldering guitars and the pitter-pattering drums down to a subdued crescendo. The album's most poignant and stunning moments, however, rest in the three, consecutive songs oc- cupying the disc's middle section: the stark yet rich and stirring bal- lad \"Live for Real,\" the breezy, Nashville-flavored \"Somewhere,\" and the glowing, basement-jazz club number \"Home.\" POIGNANT REFLEQIONS Bettens attributes the album's pen- sive qualities to the life reflec- tions she made at the time. \"I was definitely going through a phase that I felt like I'd missed out on a part of my youth,\" she says. \"I was 20 when I dropped out of college, and I realized that starting a real responsible career at that age was kind of soon. I had a time in my late 20s when I felt like. Did I miss out on that quality college time?' and I feel like I missed that time when everything was so open. 1 was definitely getting nos- talgic about the past.\" Almost Happy, which was recorded at Peter Gabriel's Real World Studios in Wilt- shire, England, has sold some 700,000 copies international- ly since its global release. John Porter, senior director of mar- keting for Red Ink, says first single \"Almost Happy\" will start at triple-A radio and will hopefully appeal to fans of softer alternative music. Porter explains, \"The problem is that we don't think they will have a home at alternative radio like they used to — because the format is harder since they first found a U.S. audience.\" Leslie Fram, director of pro- gramming for WNNX in Atlanta, echoes a similar belief. \"I have a feeling [\"Almost Happy\"! will get played because they are so talent- ed,\" she says. \"I think their fans are still there. It's really hard to say, though, because the format has gotten extreme.\" Fram adds, \"However, over the past six months singer/songwrit- ers like Phantom Planet and Pete Yorn have helped make the radio landscape a bit different.\" Bradley Andrews, a manager for a Virgin Megastore in Los Angeles, concurs, noting that \"the land- scape is getting increasingly wide, allowing a variety of bands to grab attention. If the label is crafty in their marketing of the band and this record, they could find a siz- able audience. It's a great record, and it deserves to be heard by as many people as possible.\" K's Choice is booked in the U.S. by Dan Weiner for Monterey Penin- sula Artists. Beat NAMEIISS: Santa Barbara, Calif.-based Motograter is the first band .signed to a new joint venture formed between Elektra Entertainment Group and No Name Music, the management com- pany founded by Steve RichanU. Richards, who formerly managed Slipknot and who now represents No One, Hatebreed, and American Head Charge, says he linked with Elektra because the label seemed the most committed. \"We had a lot of offers, but basically [Elektra chairman/CEO) Sylvia Rhone and [executive VP] Josh Deutsch were really intense and they wanted to win. Elektra doesn't have a ton of rock, but they have metal gods like Metallica and AC/DC. I feel like they're a major label, but they have a boutique feel.\" Most releases from No Name Re- no ml name I music cordings will be promoted, marketed, and sold by the Elektra staff and will be tunneled through WEA Distribu- tion; however, some projects will be treated as indie releases and will be worked by the No Name staff and go through WEA indie arm ADA. Richards says he expects his exist- ing staff to handle the label. \"We also have a really strong street team that has tons of kids. It's like they're our scouts. Hopefully, that's how we'll find some of the bands, but right now, we've got so many tapes we can't even listen to them.\" No Name's label deal with Epic for Mudvaiyne remains in place. GONE FISHING: Hootie & the Bk>w&h have wrapped up the recording of its first set of new material for Atlantic since 1998's.A/us('ca/ Chairs. Recorded at a small studio in Venice, Olif., and at the Record Plant in Los Angeles with producer Don Was, the songs are instantly recognizable as Hootie-fare, with the writing among the band's strongest in years. Top tracks include beautifiil ballad \"Tears Fall Down,\" the uptempo \"Space,\" the rollicking \"Little Broth- er,\" and \"The Rain Song,\" a cover of a tune by the Continental Drifters. \"We just wanted to go in and make something refreshing for us and the fans and not really worry about rely- ing on airyone else for success,\" drum- mer Jim \"Soni\" Sonefeld says. \"We just wanted to feel good about the music. Even in the unsure climate of radio and the industry, it's exciting to be diving back in headfirst\" That last sentence sums up the band's predicament. Here's a group that has sold more than 20 million albums, yet radio may not even give them a chance because they aren't new or hip enough, instead of judging the band solely on the basis of its music. The still-untitled album, which is slated to come out later this year, will be preceded by lead singer Darius Rucker's solo album. Back to Then, which arrives June 2.5 on Hidden Beach Recordings.

The set offers contemplative and cathar- tic music that is executed with Deftones-like aggression combined with the emotional outlay of Tool. Their rise-above perspective is the defining factor behind Martin's lyrics. Such songs as \"Headstrong,\" \"Get .Away,\" and the particularly ele- mental \"Not Afraid\" and \"Wake Up\" are born from desperation, dealt with, and resolved in impressive four-minute increments. \"The songs were written at a time in my life where things seemed dif- ficult to get past, and sometimes I just wanted to give up,\" Martin notes. \"All of our songs were writ- ten and intended to let the listener decide what they're about and how fibims Goveped JOEL WHITBURN'S Top Pop Albums 1955-2001 From Pop's early LPs to its latest CDs, if it charted it's here — in Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Mbums 1955-2001 Complete with vital Billboard chart stats (debut dates, peak positions, etc.).

Earshot opts to re-create the vision of timeless- ness often attributed to the likes of the Beatles or Led Zeppelin, writing individual songs that stand on their own merit once the CD stops spinning. \"We wanted songs that had their own personalities. Those are the records I've always liked to listen to, \" Martin observes. \"Some of these songs, the lyrics and mel- odies, I rewrote five or six times till I was satisfied.\" The label's traditionally-minded and grassroots approach to market- ing has yielded already impressive results. The band wrapped up the Sno-Core tour March 30 and is cur- rently finishing dates with Kid Rock, while its first single, \"Get Away,\" has been making an impressive ascent: \"We've got chart numbers at top 20 in active and mainstream already |No. 15 on this issue's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart], and we're doing very well on the modern rock chart,\" Warner Bros. VP of marketing Eric Fritschi says. \"Get Away\" was also the benefi- ciary of the soundtrack to Anne Rice's Queen of the Damned. Addi- tionally, the label's marketing campaign involves widespread street team setups and Internet streams on a variety of sites. Fans can visit the band's own Internet site (myearshot.com) for promo- tional downloads and tour updates. A soon-to-be-released live video from Earshot's Sno-Core appearance is on the way, with a traditional music video to follow. In the mean- time. Earshot is set to hit the road with labelmates Static-X, and added dates on Kid Rock's summer tour are being considered. Also in place is extensive TV vis- ibility. \"We've got new ad cam- paigns for \"Get Away' being cur- rently run by Nike's officially licensed NHL gear going until the end of June and another planned spot for MTV2 through mid-May,\" Fritschi says. As a band that is not exploiting any outrageous fashion statements or otherworldly musicianship, Earshot has had a notably easy time attracting the attention of the media, given the interest of such specialty rock publications as Cuitar Maga- zine, Hit Parader, and Revolver. Such interest is enough to further fuel the band's overriding optimism. \"The message in the end is posi- tive without being dark for dark's sake or following trends,\" Fritschi says. \"Letting Go is about hope and of moving on to better things. \" Earshot is managed by Bill Mc- Cathy and Corey Sheridan in Los Angeles. The band is booked by Darryl Eaton and Rick Roskin for the Creative Artists Agency, also in Los Angeles. 14 www.blllboard.con nUBQARD MAY 11.200»-iial ^Gilifomia' Gives Epic's Pliantom Planet Long-Desired Boost BY ANDREW KATCHEN BOSTON— Phantom Planet front- man Alex Greenwald is huddled over a cell phone, trying in vain to fend off all the noise going on in the green room of Washington. D.C. s Black Cat. Tonight the Los Angeles band will treat a cluster of admiring college kids to its brand of infec- tious indie-influenced rock. Excit- ed cheers coming from the band members — including bassist Sam Farrar. guitarist Darren Kobinson, drummer Jason Schwartzman. and guitarist Jacques Brautbar — continue to bounce about the back room in anticipation of a good show. (■\"or those unfamiliar with the band's sonorous single \"Califor- nia.\" Phantom Planet's sound draws from a disparate well of in- spiration — from the handclapping power-pop hooks a la Elvis Costel- lo & the Attractions or Joe Jack- son, to roots-tinged Americana, to the brooding anthems reminis- cent of The Bends-en Radiohead. This total aesthetic combined with a youthful, sunny, and unde- niably California demeanor de- scribes the band's musical ap- proach. Greenwald's penchant for cartwheeling, extended wails, along with his sometimes fragile and mumbled delivery, places him nicely as the U.S. heir of Thorn Yorke's dramatic croon. Phantom Planet's latest release The Guest — released Peb. 26 via Daylight/Epic and produced by Mitchell Froom and Tchad Blake — is an all-inclusive range of instru- mentation, from piano to mandolin to electronic beats, rounding out the earnest batch of tracks. For a band that's trudged through relative obscurity and label shuffling since its formation seven years ago. the guys in Phantom Planet have reason to be excited. When dis- cussing the band's past, Greenwald reminisces about the lengths he once employed to promote Phantom Planet's music. \"On our first tour, which was with American Hi-Fi. we had an EP out (titled Phantom Planet Ui<e via Day- light/Epic), and we really wanted to show the label we had .some selling power,\" he .says. \"At shows, I would announce — sometimes drunkenly, sometimes not — that if a girl bought 40 copies of the EP, I would make out with her. \" However, for Phantom Planet, this strategic measure is no longer necessary, given that The Guest sold 10,000 copies in the U.S. in its first week, according to Sound- Scan, and it shows no signs of slowing down. While a recent club tour opening for Remy Zero and Guided by Voices, along with spots on Late Show With David Letter- man and The Late Late Show With Craig Kilbom and a coveted open- ing slot on an upcoming Incubus tour, continue to increase Phan- tom Planet's visibility, its \"Califor- nia\" single has shown serious pop radio potential. Also helping is Schwartzman's film career — he starred in the 1998 film Rushmore. as well as the recent Slackers. \"I'd always liked the band, but then 1 went to see them in rehears- al,\" .says Daylight president fJavid Massey. \"and then 1 met them, and I realized every member is a com- plete star. Each of them has a unique identity that is very specif- ic to them. You are confronted with these kids that are a bunch of stars who have this amazing song- writing ability.\" Tim Richards. PD for QlOl in Chicago, says, \"It doesn't hurt hav- ing Ja.son as the drummer, and he has the cult following of Rushmore. But there's more than that — if that were it. the band wouldn't go very far. 'California' captures a strong pic- ture in people's minds. Good music captures emotion, and I think they do that very well. \" Phantom Planet is booked by Eric Podwell for Evolution Booking in Los Angeles. Its songs are published by Flying Saucer Fuel Music.

Best known as the singer for pro- gressive hard-rock mainstay Fates Warning. Alder initially recruited Agent Steel guitarist Bernie Ver- sailles, Armored Saint/Fates Warn- ing bassist Joey Vera, and Face to SOHOG RAN D HOTEL 310 WEST BROADWAY. NEW YORK. NY 10013 212.965.3000 800.965.3000 FAX 212.965.3200 VVWW.SOHOCRANn.COM Face drummer Pete Parada to record an album under the Engine moniker in 1999. But because of the individual members' prior commit- ments, a tour (aside from a Los Angeles showcase and performanc- es at two of Europe's biggest rock festivals) was impossible. Alder says that will change after Metal Blade releases Engine's soph- omore effort, Superholic, May 21. What hasn't changed is the act's powerful, modern sound — an ac- cessible fusion of edgy nu-metal riffs, aggressive rhythms, and infec- tious vocal melodies. \"We wanted it to be a lot heavier than the first record, but melody just kept creep- ing in.\" Alder says. \"Even if I'm screaming my brains out. I can't be completely monotone.\" The centerpiece of the set — and likely first single — is a standout cover of the Cure's \"Fascination Street.\" gamely modernized to reflect the current hard-rock cli- mate. \"The Cure's Disintegration was a landmark record for me, and I still love it as much as the first day I heard it,\" says ;\\lder, whose music is published by Horrendous Music IBMl). \"1 thought the song could be so much heavier with guitar riffs, so we added it in.\" Superholic s 10 other cuts — in- cluding \"Mine,\" a featured down- load in a recent cross-promotion between Miller Genuine Draft and LaunclVYahoo Music — demonstrate Alder's continued growth as a lyri- cist. He says he's both grateful for and proud of having an additional outlet to express himself. \"I'd see it through beginning to end, and I loved doing it,\" he says. \"It's like starting all over again.\" Metal Blade president Mike Faley says the label will do whatever it takes to make sure the .self-man- aged Engine will be both seen and heard this year. \"It's inspiring to see the talent coming into this record, going for- ward, and coming out with a new sound,\" he says. \"There's a pedigree between Joey and Ray as far as their history with Fates Warning, but that's where all the comparisons end. From that point on, the music stands on its own.\" Superholic is a \"must for any fan of the smarter side of metal,\" says Tim MacMillian, metal MD at KYYI Wichita Falls, Texas. \"Rarely do you find such a killer blend of today's groove-metal sound with the tech- nical supremacy of Fates Warning.\" Alder says the group hopes to start touring this summer, while Face to Face has its own new al- bum to support. \"Pete's very im- portant, but his band is obviously his bread and butter, and he's total- ly cool if we have to go out with another drummer for a while,\" he says. \"But we have to go on tour, and we're just trying to find any- body that will somewhat match up to what we do.\" LOVE STORY: From their movie- idol good looks to their backstage wedding at the Metropolitan Opera (officiated by then-mayor of New York Rudolph Giuliani), everything about Angela Gheo- rghiu and Roberto Alagna seems a bit larger than life. The intense Romanian soprano and the ami- able French tenor have captured the hearts of a public that tran- scends opera purists, even as their performances and recordings earn critical accolades. ALAGNA AND CHEORCHIU In the process, by pulling out of productions that did not meet their exacting standards, they have earned a reputation as being demanding, even difficult. It's a story with all the trappings of movie stardom, so it was perhaps only a matter of time until opera's \"love couple\" made the transition to the silver screen with a new film version of the Puccini pot- boiler Tosca. The recording was issued by GMI Classics last November; the film (which hit screens in Europe late last year) opens in the U.S. in July. Oddly enough, director Benoit Jacquot was not especially an operaphile when he set out to make the film, according to the couple, but they feel that this worked to everyone's advantage. \"He's a movie director,\" Cheo- rghiu says, \"and he has the courage to do something new in opera. When |others| produce an opera, they have very straight,' typical operatic ideas. Jacquot used the camera and new ideas in a very modern way.\" Jacquot's film presents a beau- tiful, highly stylized vision of the opera. The action takes place on disembodied sets surrounded by darkness that characters emerge from and disappear into. Black- and-white footage from the re- cording session is interspersed into the action, and in one in- stance, Cheorghiu and Alagna speak their lines over their own Steve Smith singing. Extreme close-ups of the performers alternate with lengthy overhead crane shots. However, even with such pecu- liarities, the acting of the princi- pal performers carries the film. Alagna is a tender, lyrical Cavara- dossi. but doesn't lack for ardor in the opera's more heated moments. Gheorghiu's portrayal of the titu- lar diva captures perfectly the character's vulnerability, uncer- tainty, and strength. Veteran bass Ruggiero Raimondi — who bears an odd resemblance to actor Den- nis Hopper in the film — plays the lecherous Scarpia with malicious glee. He and Cheorghiu are rivet- ing in their climactic confronta- tion in .Act 2. while scenes be- tween Alagna and Cheorghiu naturally gain an extra measure of passion from the couple's real-life connection. Of course, Tosca has already been well-served on recordings, hut the husband-and-wife team asserts that it remains important for new generations of singers to perform the standard repertoire. \"In this type of repertoire, sure, you have ghosts, \" Alagna says, \"\"but they are not bad ghosts. If we lis- ten to Callas or Pavarotti or Caru- so, |we| can learn something and follow tradition. It s very impor- tant to follow tradition but at the same time to put something of yourself into the role.\" The couple has a number of more traditional projects in the pipeline. Gheorghiu's Lii'e From Covent Garden, issued by EMI on CD Tuesday (71 and due on DVD May 21, features repertoire rang- ing from Handel and Mozart to Bellini and Frederick Loewe. Alagna will release a bel canto recital disc July 2, and a recording of Verdi's // Trovalore featuring the pair is scheduled for September release (both on EMII. Still, despite the challenges, they are eager to continue exploring the possibilities of cinema: They've already filmed a version of Gounod's Romeo and Juliet for British and Canadian TV and are enthusiastic about the potential for opera to reach a wider audience through film. \"I think it was very important to do a new opera movie,\" Alagna says, \"because otherwise, opera will remain old-fashioned. A lot of people start to sing because they saw Isuchl movies. When I saw The Great Caruso with Mario Lanza for the first time when 1 was 10 years old, that was the moment 1 said, OK, I want to do that.' \" Cheorghiu adds that Tosca is already realizing that potential. \"In Paris, \" she says, \"I saw a queue like the one for Titanic'.\" 16 www. billboard. com BILLBOARD MAY 11,2002 TV^acks.

Felicity Porter — fol- lowed the ups and downs of a love tri- angle between Felicity and her fellow college students, Ben Covington (played by Scott Speedman) and Noel Crane (Scott Foley). During its 1998-2002 njn (the series finale airs May 22), Felicity received a 3rA SIXPENCE NONE THE RICHER considerable amount of critical praise and high ratings for the WB during the show's first season, but the ratings and media hype had considerably cooled down since then. The series is bowing out in its fourth season, mirroring the final college year for the Felicity charac- ter. (Reruns of Felicity can be seen this fall on the cable network WE: Women's Entertainment.) As with other WB shows targeted to young people, music has been an im- portant component of the Felicity series. The first Felicity soundtrack, re- leased in 1999 on Hollywood Records, peaked at No. 97 on The Billboard 2(K). The 13 tracks on Felicity: Senior Year are Jude, \"King of Yesterday \": Six- pence None the Richer, \"Melody of You\"; Ryan Adams. \"La Cienega Just Smiled \": Chantai Kreviazuk, \"Par Away \"; Shawn Colvin, \"Anywhere You Go\"; Andy Stochansky, \"Here Nor There\"; Natalie MerchanL \"Tell Your- self; Barenaked Ladies, \"Call and Answer\": Shelby Lynne, \"Bend\"; Kendall Pv/tte. \"Scratch\"; Naren Ord, \"Perfect \"; 54'40, \"Casual Viewin\"'; and J J. Abrams & Andrew Jarecki, \"New Version of You. \" The tracks by pop-rock band Six- pence None the Richer and singer/ songwriter Payne were previously unreleased. However, SixpetKe vocal- ist Leigh Nash tells Billboard that \"Melody of You\" will be on the group's next album, due later this year on Squint Entertainment. Nash adds that TV shows have in- by Caria Hay creasingly become an exciting outlet for new and established artists to gel expasure for their music: \"I krew it's made a difference with our band.\" In 1999. the WB's Dawsons Creek prominently featured Sixpence's \"Kiss Me\" in the show, as well as clips of the music video at the end of the program. That exposure helped propel the sin- gle into a No. 2 hit on The Billboard Hot 100, more than a year after the single's release. \"We knew the TV shmv made an im- pact because we had a lot of people ask- ing us to autograph the Dawson 's Creek soundtrack,\" Nash says. ( \"Kiss Me \" was featured on the soundtrack.) \"Being featured on a TV soundtrack opened up new opportunities for us.\" Of \"Melody of You.\" Nash says that the song— featuring an acoustic guitar base and classical string instruments — is an indication of the direction of the band's music on the new album: \"People can expect a more mature sound, and it's very well-honed. We finished this album two-and-a-half years ago, but we're in the process of adding songs and doing remixes.\" The music on Felicity: Senior Year is primarily from the show's last season, says Nettwerk head of soundtracks Maria Akmte, who was also both sound- tracks' album producer. \"The Sixpence None the Richer song reminds me a lot of the Felicity charac\"ter, who's an aspir- ing painter. The song has references to painting in the lyrics.\" Nettwerk will concentrate a great deal of its marketing efforts for the album on the Internet. Alonte adds, \"\"We have banners up on the Felicity Web site, and we're also spreading awareness to all the fan sites {or Felic- ity. There's even a fan site, felicity- tunes,com, which is all about music from the show. A TV spot for the al- bum will also run during one of the series' last episodes. \" It's sad that the show's going away,\" concludes Alonte, \" but this soundtrack is like a scrapbook or a yearbook that people can turn to for memories.\" IN BRIEF: Music from the children's TV series Bob the Builder has been a hit in the U.K. and Australia, and now the U.S. will have a Bob the Builder sound- track, due May 21 on Koch Entertain- ment, Koch president Bob FVank tells Billboard that the album's first single, \"Can We Fix It, \" has an e-card that \"will allow streaming of the song on the /toft the Builder Web site and other Iparent-orientedj sites. There will also be cross-promotion with HIT Enter- tainment, which releases Bob home videos. \" In the U.S., the series is on CBS and on cable network Nick Jr. A Bob the Builder tour is in the works. Freelon Honors Wonder On Latest Concord Set BY DAVID NATHAN LOS ANGELES— The fact that song stylist Nnenna Freelon 's 10- year recording career is moving into high gear seems indisputable. With five Grammy Award nomi- nations to her credit (including two for her self-produced 2000 Concord release, Soulcalt), an appearance in the 2001 Mel Gibson film What Women Want, and an increasingly hectic touring sched- ule, the North Carolina-based singer is preparing for the release of her seventh album. Tales of Wonder (Concord, June 11). Consisting entirely of songs from the catalog of Stevie Wonder, the 12- track set has the makings of a main- stream breakthrough for Freelon, who signed with the Beverly Hills- based Concord label in 1996. Freelon explains, \"1 grew up with Stevie's music. 1 was lucky because my parents exposed me to Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald, Billy Eckstine, Charlie Parker, and other jazz greats. At the same time, the music of Motown — Earth, Wind & Fire; the Stylistics; Tower of Power — that's what I claimed, that's also what 1 listened to. Stevie truly had his pulse on our generation, and his music was like the soundtrack for the lives of so many of us.\" No stranger to Wonder's music, Freelon has recorded one of the legendary artist s songs on each of her previous albums for Concord, as well as her three early-'90s sets for Columbia. Freelon says choos- ing from more than 300 Wonder songs was no easy task. \"Once we decided to do this album, 1 started researching his work about a year ago. I picked songs from each era of his career, and I included some absolute personal favorites — along with a few surprises.\" A prime example, the little- known \" Black Orchid \" (from Won- der's 1979 ity Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants), is sandwiched between Freelon's thoughtful in- terpretation of \"Tears of a Clown\" — a Wonder-penned 1970 hit for Smokey Robinson & the Miracles — and Wonder's own smash \"My Cheric Amour.\" The latter song, Freelon says, \"was where I began to recognize Stevie's work. \" With Freelon's masterful reading of such classics as \"Superstition\" and \"All in Love Is Fair,\" along with a new musical slant on \"Until You Come Back to Me\" (a 1974 hit for Aretha Franklin), Tales of Wonder has the ingredients for taking Freelon to a new level of sales be- yond the jazz arena. Concord is mounting an aggres- sive online campaign, says label VP of sales K.C. Conroy, who notes, \"Nnenna is a priority artist for us, and we will be initiating a main- stream press campaign, as well as supporting her tour dates with regional television spots. We feel that this album has widespread appeal, since Nnenna is interpret- ing material familiar to pop and urban audiences.\" An ASCAP writer whose work is published by Chimusic Company, Freelon is managed by Ed Keane of Ed Keane Associates and booked by William Morris in association with Ed Keane.

BILLBOARD MAY 11,2002 www.blllboard.coni Israel's Independence Day Suffers No-Shows Important Music Industry Date Feels Effects Of Widespread Unease After Security Alerts And Terrorist Attacks BYSASHALEVY TEI. AW, Israel— Traditionally, Inde- pendence Day is an occasion for Israelis to gather and listen to free concerts by top local musical acts hired by municipalities to entertain their residents. The date — it was April 18/19 this year — is one of the most important on the calendar for the local music indastn'. This year, as a general .security alert was issued in expectation of fiirther ter- rorist attacks, the .'vtth Independence Day was anything but a cause for cele- bration for local artists and highlight- ed the difficulties liw acts have faced in the past 18 months. Citing security concerns, municipalities canceled long-planned events on short notice. Izhar Ashdot has spent 20 years in the Israeli music business, first as a BY RAY WADOELL NASHVILLE— Anyone doubting the vitality of today's jam-band scene need look no further than the Bonnaroo Festival, a first-time event set for June 21-23 in rural Manchester. Term., that sold out its 60,000 tickets without the benefit of traditional advertising. Produced by Superfly Productions and A.C. Entertainment. Bonnaroo has a still-evolving lineup featuring a ver- itable who's who of the contemporary jam-band scene, including TVey Anas- tasio. Widespread Panic. String Cheese Incident. Gov't Mule. Ben Harper, Les Claypool's Flying Frog Brigade, Moe, Karl Deason's Tiny llniwrse. Galactic, Jurassic 5, Norah Jones, and others. That a new festival in an out-of-the- way location with no established his- tory was able to move so many tickets in such a short period of time is im- pressive by any .standard. By compari- son, the long-established Coachella rock fest in Indio, Calif. — with names far more recognizable to maiastream music fans (including Oasis. Bjork, and Foo Fighters this year) — draws 20,000-25,000 each day at best. New Orleans-based Superfly presi- dent Jonathan Mayers says even or- ganizers were caught off-guard by the immediate response. \"We knew it would do well, but I don't think any- one in their wildest dreams thought it would sell out this quickly, especially without traditional promotion and without announcing all of the bands,\" Mayers says. \"\"We had an advertising budget and a second round of adver- tising planned with print, radio, etc.. but we never had to implement it.\" Instead, Bonnaroo ased its own Web site and other Internet destinations like jambands.com and the various band's sites to get the word out and sell tickets. \"We're fortunate that this fan base is so connected through the In- member of 1980s rock group Tislam, then as a .solo artist and prcxlucer for .such arti.sts as the late Ofra Haza. \"Independence Day is an Israeli show-business institution. Munici- palities, kibbutzim, and other insti- tutions would buy shows at higher- than-usual rates. \" Ashdot says. \" It used to be very important financial- ly, because you could earn more in one night than you could in several weeks. But the last couple of years have been terrible.\" This year, only three cities allowed outdoor events to go ahead as plan- ned: Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and Rishon LeZion. Other towns moved con- certs to more easily guarded venues that hold fewer people. But the majority — an estimated 70% — of towns throughout the country, from temeC Mayers says. The whole thing was very cost-effective.\" The quick sellout led to Bonnaroo's tickets being some of the relatively few in the U.S. that won't say \"Ticketmas- ter\"\" on them. \"We had negotiations with Ticketmaster and intended to sell tickets through them — or at least make them available through Ticket- master, \"/VC. Entertainment president Ashley Capps says. \"But quite frankly, we came out of the gate so strong, we never had to do that.\" Initial tickets — including camping and all three days' worth of music — were sold at $100, folloived by a group for $12.5 and finally $140. Even those not directly linked to the festival's pro- duction have been impressed by how quickly it went clean. String Cheese Incident agent/manager Mike Lupa says, \"Bonnaroo could have sold 200,000 tickets.\" John Paluska. manager of Phish and /\\nastasio. adds, \"Bonnaroo is a great case study. Here is a festival in a time of mixed results that goes up with no previous track record, offers some of the better-known bands of this genre, and sells out at 60,000 tick- ets in a very short time.\" Capps says. \"The foundation of this festival conceptually is this special group of artists and their fan base. They certainly sell records, but I think most would agree their music is about the live concert experience, and they've established a very strong rapport through touring. Now, with the Inter- net, they're even more connected to their audience, and their audience is connected to one another.\" Haifa in the North to Be er Sheva in the Negev, canceled their events with three or four days' notice, leav- ing artists uncompensated, (Ashdot himself was booked for two gigs: both were canceled.) And for those lucky enough to be able to continue with their perform- ances, fees have fallen. Top female performer Sarit Hadad might have commanded $10,000 for her appear- ance in Kfar Saba had her show not been dropped. But the average artist can expect to make only $1,000- 2,000 per show. Ashdot says, \" The live performance situation is the worst it's ever been because of the security and economic situations and the mood of the country.\" The most prestigious venue in Israel is the Caesarea Ampitheater, COME TO TENNESSEE Located about an hour south of Nashville, this is not the first time that the Manchester-area site of Bonnaroo has hosted a music festival. But the 1999 Itchykoo Festival held on the same property was deemed less than successful. Still. Bonnaroo's producers feel they made the right choice, and the fact that just half of sales have come from the Southeastern U.S. bears that out. Mayers says, \"We felt this scene had a void in it for a major festival, and we wanted something that would take it to a different level, par- ticularly in the Southeast.\" The overall budget for Bonnaroo is more than $5 million, including tal- ent \"We're looking at creating a small city that will take care of people for three days the right way, and that takes a lot of money,\" Mayers says. \"Music is the biggest element of Bonnaroo. but it's also about the camping. DJs, festi- val village, and lots of surprises. \" According to Mayers — who says there are plans to make this an annual event — the term \"bonnaroo\" was pulled from a Dr. John record. \"It's a slang Cre- ole term meaning \"really, really good stuff.' We wanted a word that reflects fiin and having a good time, and we felt this was a word we could really brand.\" At press time. Bonnaroo producers were looking into securing more land for the event, perhaps opening up as many as 10,000 more tickets. The pro- duction manager is Haddon Hipsley (Phish); security is by irxlustry veteraris Bart Butler and Rick Rentz. \"We have surrounded oursel\\>es with the A team.\" Mayers says. \"With an event of this mag- nitude, we wanted no learning curve.\" Mayers says taping will be allowed at the festival, and plans also call for a documentary to be filmed of the debut Bonnaroo: \"\"This is an important event and we need to document it.\" which holds 4.000. Ashdot reckons that only Rita, Yehuda Poliker, and Shiomo Artzi can fill it, and that aft"
