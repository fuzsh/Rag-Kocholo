        "text": "Date Event 1 Two rimshot Phoenix adult top 40s, KEXX (at 103.9) and KMVA (at 97.5), merged into one simulcast covering the metropolitan area as \"Hot 97.5/103.9 Trending Radio\". The move brings KMVA's owner Trumper Radio into KEXX's owner Riviera Broadcast Group's Phoenix properties as part of the arrangement.[1] ESPN Radio gains a new affiliate in Columbia, South Carolina, after a long absence, as talk WOIC joins the sports network, whose first day featured the live broadcast of the South Carolina Gamecocks taking on the Wisconsin Badgers in the Capital One Bowl.[2] Waco, Texas, sister stations KWBT and KBCT make frequency, signal and format adjustments, with KWBT moving its R&B/hip-hop format from 104.9 to 94.5 and KBCT dropping its talk format and switching from 94.5 to 104.9, where it relaunched as rhythmic top 40 KBHT \"Hot 104.9\"[3] ESPN Radio also returns to New Orleans after being dropped in September 2013 by WWWL, as Cajun/swamp music outlet KLRZ becomes the new affiliate.[4] CFJL-FM/Winnipeg shifts from adult standards to AC and rebrands as \"Jewel 101,\" putting it in line with Evanov Communications' AC formatted \"Jewel\" branding.[5] In the Greensboro/Winston-Salem/High Point area, active rock WVBZ (100.3 The Buzz) and top 40/CHR WMKS (105.7 Now) swapped signals, with WMKS relaunching as \"100.3 KISS-FM\" and WVBZ moving to 105.7 and shifting to alternative, bringing that format back to the area after 13 years.[6] WLFM-LP/Cleveland drops adult album alternative for Spanish top 40 under new a leasing deal with TSJ Media; Murray Hill Broadcasting will remain WLFM's primary owners.[7] WQQR/Paducah, Kentucky, brings the AC format back to the market after a two-year absence as \"94.7 The Mix.\"[8] WGHQ/Kingston, New York, drops news/talk and becomes a non-commercial affiliate of NPR under new owners Robin Hood Radio.[9] Clear Channel's liberal talk outlets KTLK/Los Angeles and KNEW/San Francisco both shift to conservative talk and adopts \"The Patriot\" branding. KTLK also changes call letters to KEIB and transfers the former calls to sister station KTCN/Minneapolis-St. Paul[10] In a surprise move, WABC/New York City poaches Curtis Sliwa from WNYM/Hackensack and reunites him with his former WABC morning show co-host Ron Kuby. The revived Curtis and Kuby will air in the time slot formerly held by The Rush Limbaugh Show, which had left WABC for WOR the week prior.[11] 3 Cumulus Media expands its Chicago properties, taking over operations of Merlin Media's WIQI (rhythmic AC) and WLUP-FM (classic rock) through a local marketing agreement as well as inheriting Merlin's LMA for WKQX-LP (alternative rock); the deal essentially ends Merlin's 3-year run as a broadcasting entity (WIQI and WLUP, along with New York's WRXP, were the company's first station purchases in 2011).[12] After three years with modern rock, WRKN/New Orleans began stunting with a wheel of formats. On January 6, it became the latest outlet to adopt the \"Nash FM\" country format.[13] 6 WXDJ/Miami shifts from simulcasting Tropical/Salsa sister WRMA to Spanish hot AC as \"I95.\"[14] Clear Channel Media and Entertainment and SFX Entertainment announced plans to expand SFX's Electronic Dance Music-owned properties, including its recently acquired Beatport online music portal, to Clear Channel's radio outlets and iHeartRadio platforms.[15] Another Phoenix outlet makes a major change as adult hits KPKX flipped to a simulcast of sports talk sister KTAR. The move brings the outlets full circle as KPKX was the original KTAR-FM, whose calls reside at its news/talk sister at 92.3. KPKX changed its call letters to KMVP-FM on January 9.[16] Mapleton Communications expands its broadcasting portfolio to Louisiana with the acquisition of Opus Media Partners' properties in Alexandria and Monroe, thus ending Opus' foray as a broadcaster.[17] Panama City Beach, Florida, picks up a dance outlet, as WPCF & W227CE drops Caribbean music to become \"Play 93.9.\"[18] 7 Tyler Media Group adds a pair of Spanish-language outlets in Tulsa, regional Mexican KRVT and Spanish religious KZLI, to its broadcasting portfolio. KRVT will be rebranded as \"La Z 1270\" and change call letters to KLUZ and KZLI will switch to an English-language hybrid religious/community talk format[19] 8 Curtis Media Group announced that it has purchased oldies WKIX-FM/Raleigh from McClatchey Broadcasting, which plans to move WKIX-FM to 102.3 and flip it to country under a TMA with a new company that will be run by Donna Curtis McClatchey, the daughter of Curtis Media owner Don Curtis. Curtis in turn will move top 40/CHR WWPL to 102.9, giving that signal better coverage in Raleigh area. 102.3 would later become country-formatted WKJO, while WKIX-FM kept its classic-hits format on 102.9 and WWPL instead moved to 96.9, replacing that station's simulcast of WYMY \"La Ley 101.1.\"[20] 10 Clear Channel makes a pair of format changes in two markets:\n\nIn Phoenix, KYOT-FM drops rhythmic AC for variety hits as \"95.5 The Mountain,\" filling the void left open by KMVP-FM after they flipped to sports four days earlier. They become the fourth Phoenix station in ten days to make a format flip or change.[21]\n\nIn Sacramento, KHLX breaks from the simulcast of KFBK & KFBK-FM to become \"B92.5 Country\" (and adopts the new call letters KBEB), putting it in competition with CBS Radio's KNCI and Entravision's KNTY.[22]\n\nOne week after taking over the Merlin-owned stations in a LMA, Cumulus Media moves the alternative rock format of WKQX-LP/Chicago (87.7 FM) to WIQI (101.1 FM), with both stations operating under a short-term simulcast. The move restores alt-rock to 101.1, which had a nearly two-decade run with the format before its 2011 purchase by Merlin Media.[12] 13 Clear Channel Media and Entertainment announces the retirement of the company's Co-chairman/CEO, John Hogan, who steps down from that position after 15 years, while fellow Co-chairman/CEO Bob Pittman has signed a 5-year deal to remain with the company. Pittman will absorb Hogan's duties full-time and report to CFO Rich Bressler.[23] A major acquisition takes place among a pair of locally owned broadcasters in Salt Lake City, as Broadway Media purchases the assets of Simmons Media Group for $11 million. Broadway had been operating Simmons' Salt Lake properties under a LMA since October 2013.[24] 14 A pair of Greenup, Kentucky-based outlets switched formats, as WLGC drops oldies for news while its FM sister goes from country to classic hits, putting the latter in direct competition with Clear Channel's Huntington, West Virginia-based WBVB.[25] 16 After raising concerns that it hasn't adequately complied with supplying the agency with ownership information so it can determine if it is at least 75% owned by U.S. citizens (as foreign ownership must be capped at 25%), as well as only supplying mailing addresses instead of a physical one, The Federal Communications Commission has informed Pandora Radio that they have denied their application to purchase KXMZ/Rapid City, South Dakota. Pandora filed papers in June 2013 to take over the adult top 40 outlet as a way to take advantage of the lower rates that Internet streaming services owned by terrestrial radio stations enjoy. Despite the setback, Pandora says it will pursue plans to make the application more compliant to FCC rules and regulations.[26] Pandora immediately filed a petition for a declaratory ruling on June 30, claiming that Pandora is 80% owned by Americans and that the FCC's rules on foreign ownership are flawed.[27] 17 Adult top 40 WFLC/Miami becomes the second station in the market this month to switch formats, becoming top 40/CHR \"Hits 97.3.\" The flip will now put the Cox Radio outlet up against a pair of heritage top 40s, Clear Channel's Mainstream rival WHYI-FM and Beasley Broadcasting's rhythmic WPOW.[28] 19 KXOS/Los Angeles becomes the second station in the market to switch formats, as it drops their Spanish/English top 40/CHR presentation for regional Mexican, branded as \"Radio Centro 93.9.\" The move puts the station in direct competition with KLAX-FM, Univision's KSCA, Entravision's simulcast of KDLD/KDLE, and Liberman Broadcasting's trimulcast of KBUA/KBUE/KEBN.[29] The move came after KXOS hired former KLAX morning host Ricardo ‘El Mandril’ Sanchez for the same duties. Sanchez had been the subject of controversy during his tenure at KLAX, involving claims of ratings fraud and tampering, resulting in his program being taken off the air by KLAX's parent company Spanish Broadcasting System in November 2013.[30] 20 JVC Media spins off WBXY/Gainesville, Florida, to RMA Media, who will flip WBXY to a simulcast of WGMA, a new station that will sign on at 99.7 and serve the Ocala area. JVC had already moved WBXY's dance format over to WXJZ in December 2013.[31] WGMA and WBXY launched with an adult standards format on March 19.[32] 21 WTAR/Norfolk announces that it will drop Comedy and return to its previous news/talk/sports hybrid format, picking up some of the programming from sister station WNIS.[33] 22 KSOC/Dallas-Ft. Worth returns to urban adult contemporary after three years of urban oldies.[34] 23 Phoenix sees its fifth station make a format change, as KVIB shifts from Spanish top 40 to Spanish AC.[35] 30 CKUE-FM in Windsor, Ontario, abruptly dumps mainstream rock for a soft AC format as Lite FM. Date Event 1 A pair of Louisville stations makes changes: WLUE ends its three-year run with adult contemporary and its leasing deal with WAY-FM after it decided not to buy the station for financial reasons. WAY-FM in turn takes back the station and restores the Christian contemporary format it had before it was leased out in 2010. Also on the same day, ESPN Radio affiliate WHBE adds an FM signal as it drops the simulcast of regional Mexican WTUV to simulcast WHBE's programming (that station would change from WTUV-FM to WHBE-FM in May).[36] 3 Cumulus Media increases the number of \"Nash FM\" stations to 11 with the addition of WKDF/Nashville, KRMD/Shreveport, WIWF/Charleston, South Carolina, WKOR/Columbus, Mississippi, WXTA/Erie, WFBE/Flint, WYZB/Fort Walton Beach, Florida, WTNR/Grand Rapids, WXBM-FM/Pensacola and WZCY-FM/Harrisburg making the conversion to the country formatted brand today. Another outlet, WPSK-FM/Blacksburg, Virginia, will follow on February 5.[37] Sirius XM Radio eliminates the air staff lineup positions at '50s on 5 and '90s on 9 in a cost-cutting move, resulting in the decades-focused music channels to go jockless. Among the air staffers pink-slipped from the outlets were Norm N. Nite and Jim Kerr and Ken Merson (from '50s on 5), and Jojo Morales and KT Harris (from '90s on 9).[38] Columbia, South Carolina, picks up its third sports outlet, as Cumulus-owned WISW drops conservative talk to affiliate with co-owned NBC Sports Radio, joining FM sister station WNKT in the sports format.[39] 5 After 3 years with Triple-A, KCKC/Kansas City returns to AC as \"KC102.1.\"[40] 7 Adult top 40 WPLJ/New York morning host Scott Shannon announced his \"retirement\" from radio after nearly four decades, jeopardizing the future of the nationally syndicated True Oldies Channel that Shannon founded and hosted.[41] But on February 24, Shannon revealed that he had signed a deal to become the morning host at oldies rival WCBS-FM, where he will start March 3. Another Cumulus Country outlet, WNNF/Cincinnati, makes the conversion to the \"Nash FM\" brand.[42] 10 JVC Media makes more changes in its Gainesville, Florida, cluster, this time by flipping WYGC from a simulcast of country sister WTRS to classic hits as \"WOW 104.9,\" bringing that format back to the market after three years, when it was dropped by its now adult top 40 sister station WMFQ[43] 11 WJHM/Orlando officially shifts from rhythmic to top 40/CHR and relaunches its branding from \"102 Jamz\" to \"101.9 AMP Radio.\"[44] Emmis Communications expands its New York City cluster with the purchase of urban adult contemporary WBLS and Gospel WLIB from YMF Media for $131 million (USD). Both properties have operated under a LMA since 2012, when it arranged a leasing deal with ESPN Radio to take over WBLS' former rival WRKS (now WEPN-FM) and allowing YMF to pick up WRKS' programming and content.[45] 17 WKJY/Long Island places morning hosts Steve Harper (who is also WKJY's PD) and Leeana Karlson on suspension after fabricating a letter they read on their show on February 12 from a parent who would not allow their child to attend a birthday party of a child of a same-sex couple. Station management later learned afterwards that they used this made-up story so they can create a \"healthy discourse on a highly passionate topic\" but failed to notify the management prior to going on the air with this false letter.[46] The Tribune Company takes over the programming operations of WKQX-LP/Chicago and places a sports format on the LPTV signal as \"87.7 The Game\" with the new calls WGWG-LP. The station will broadcast the format until 2015, when all LPTVs in the United States will cease operating on analog signals.[47] KDAL-FM/Duluth-Superior pulls the plug on active rock to fill the market's vacant AC void and brands itself as \"FM 95.7.\"[48] 18 KCRW/Los Angeles announces the acquisition of classical KDB-FM/Santa Barbara, and will partner with Antioch University to create a local studio on campus with some student involvement. As a result of this deal, KCRW's programming will move to the University of Southern California's KQSC, while USC's programming will move to the 93.7 frequency and retain the KDB calls as part of a trade swap.[49] Sydney, Australia-based APN News & Media announces that they will acquire the 50% stake that Clear Channel owns in Australian Radio Network for $246.5 million (AUS) (US$225 million).[50] 20 KXJM/Portland relaunched their rhythmic format and changed their moniker to \"JAMN' 107.5.\" This time around, the music continues to focus on current rhythmic hits, but now incorporates more hip hop and a gold component to its library featuring older rhythmic product (old school R&B, hip-hop, and club classics), while decreasing on dance-pop tracks, using the slogan \"Jams from Today & Back in the Day\". The station's moniker is based on sister station WJMN/Boston.[51] Family Life Radio sells Christian talk KRGN/Amarillo, Texas, to Midessa Broadcasting, who will convert the station to commercial status after the sale.[52] 24 The Fort Wayne radio market sees a pair of clusters acquired by one company, as the newly revived Adams Communications purchases Summit City Media (the owners of rhythmic top 40 WNHT, classic rock WXKE and oldies simulcast WGL & WGL-FM) and Russ Oasis Media (the owners of top 40/CHR WJFX, 1990s' hits WHPP and country WBTU). Since the deal has the number of stations over the limit (six FMs), Adams will swap WGL-FM to Calvary Radio Network in exchange for its translator at 103.3 and swap WHPP to Ft. Wayne Catholic Radio in exchange for its AM outlet WLYV to comply with FCC rules.[53] 25 After four days of stunting with Frank Sinatra's \"New York City\", KKRG/Albuquerque flipped from Hispanic rhythmic to rhythmic adult contemporary with a heavy emphasis on old school R&B/hip-hop hits from the '90s and 2000s as \"Yo! 101.3.\"[54] 26 Vision Communications announces its intent to acquire the remnants of Pembrook Pines Media Group.[55] 28 The FM simulcast of conservative talk WCOA/Pensacola flips to classic hits as \"Jet 100.7\" and changes calls to WJTQ (a \"homage\" to its previous life as WJLQ and to its current moniker).[56] Another Cumulus Media outlet flips to the \"Nash FM\" country brand, as classic hits WOMG/Columbia becomes the latest convert, and joins an already crowded field that includes WCOS-FM and WWNQ.[57] The Jack FM branding comes to Halifax, as Lite 92.9 CFLT-FM makes the flip to the variety hits format.[58] Two Corus radio stations in Ontario made their format change More 103.9 CKDK-FM in Woodstock, Ontario, abruptly abandons the Greatest Hits format for Country becoming Country 104 while CKWS-FM in Kingston, Ontario, becomes Hits 104.3 FM with an AC format Date Event 3 After nearly 30 years of soft AC, KLTI/Des Moines relaunches with an upbeat current AC presentation as \"More 104\" and changes call letters to KMYR to reflect the new handle and musical direction. They become the third outlet in the Iowa capital to make format changes this year.[59] The Jack FM format exits Jackson, Mississippi, as WJXN-FM flips to classic country.[60] 5 Buckley Broadcasting announces that it will sell its Connecticut radio stations — WDRC AM-FM in Hartford, WSNG in Torrington, WWCO in Waterbury, and WMMW in Meriden — to Connoisseur Media. Following the sale, all of Buckley's remaining stations will be in California.[61][62] 6 After four struggling years of active rock, WCMG/Florence, South Carolina, returns to its previous urban AC format and revives the \"Magic 94.3\" moniker.[63] Another Clear Channel outlet will take the KISS-FM brand moniker, as KWNW/Memphis becomes the latest convert. This will be the first time since 2001 that the brand has been used in this market, which was last used at KWNW's current top 40/CHR rival WHBQ-FM.[64] Corus Radio dismisses the on-air staff of active rock CKQB-FM in Ottawa, leaving the station jockless until March 31, when they flip the station to top 40/CHR as \"Jump 106.9\". The flip gives the Canadian capital city two top 40 outlets, as it faces rival station CIHT-FM.[65] 7 Triple-A KDBZ/Anchorage flips to oldies, putting it in competition with KEAG.[66] Talk Radio Network drops its two-year-old lawsuit against Westwood One after coming to amicable terms with the network's new owner, Cumulus Media Networks.[67] 9 Community radio station WOOL/Bellows Falls, Vermont, signs on a 550-watt facility at 91.5, supplanting its former 6-watt low-power FM license at 100.1, which began broadcasting in 2005 and left the air a month earlier.[68] 10 After spending four years with a top 40/CHR direction, KHHM/Sacramento returns to its previous rhythmic top 40 format.[69] Buckley Broadcasting announces that it will sell KSEQ/Fresno to Lotus Communications.[70] 14 Univision pulls the plug on yet another Latin rhythmic outlet, as the Bay Area simulcast of KVVF (Santa Clara) & KVVZ (San Rafael) begins stunting with Nelly's \"Hot In Herre\" non-stop from 3 p.m. onwards, triggering a viral sensation and even a Twitter account based around the stunt.[71] KVVF/KVVZ flipped to English-language rhythmic top 40 as \"Hot 105.7\" after the stunt ended on March 17, giving the San Jose area its first rhythmic outlet since KHQT exited the format in 1995, as well as new competition for San Francisco-based rhythmic rival KYLD, Mainstream rivals KMVQ and KREV, and R&B/hip-hop KMEL.[72] 18 After stunting with St. Patrick's Day music, AC WRWN/Savannah relaunches with classic hits[73] 20 After nearly 29 years of billing themselves as \"Majic 95.1,\" WAJI/Fort Wayne is the latest AC outlet to make a musical adjustment in its format, as it rebrands as \"Best 95.1\"[74] 23 As WHWT/Huntsville exits the rhythmic top 40 format after six years to become a K-LOVE outlet under new owners Educational Media Foundation on this day, the now-displaced management and staff took to Twitter to blame the businesses for not supporting the station since its 2008 launch.[75] WARQ/Columbia, South Carolina, is the latest station in the market to flip formats, as it drops active rock for adult top 40.[76] 24 Citing that \"Jack FM just wasn't doing it for us,\" KDHT/Denver flips to classic alternative as \"107X.\"[77] 27 U.S. Representative Mike Rogers announces he will not seek re-election and will join Cumulus Media Networks as a talk show host.[78] After 18 months on the air, Christian AC WTCF/Winchester, Virginia, drops the format due to a lack of funding; the \"Cross FM\" programming will continue online. WTCF then picked up the Southern Gospel format previously heard on former sister station WTRM before that station's 2013 sale to the American Family Association.[79] 29 A tower in North Adams, Massachusetts, carrying the antennas for WUPE-FM and a translator for WFCR/Amherst, along with an adjacent cell tower, collapse as a result of high winds, forcing WUPE and the WFCR translator off the air. WUPE stated that it would resume broadcasting with a temporary antenna by April 1. WUPE's AM simulcast in Pittsfield and its web stream were not affected by the tower collapse.[80] 30 WSYR/Syracuse, New York, dismisses gardening host Terry Ettinger and progressive talk host George Kilpatrick, both of whom had been at the station for over 20 years each, from their weekend positions on the station. Kilpatrick's program on sister station WHEN continues.[81] 31 Adult top 40 CKZZ-FM/Vancouver revived its former moniker \"Z95.3\" after seven years under new owner Newcap Radio. The station had used the Virgin Radio branding until its sale from former owner Astral Media (which licensed the branding) closed this month. To meet ownership limits, Bell Media, who bought out Astral earlier in 2013, already owned CFBT-FM and CHQM-FM, and had to sell CKZZ, CHHR-FM and CISL (AM), all of which were sold to Newcap. The Virgin Radio brand is expected to move over to CFBT-FM's sister station CHQM-FM, which has transferred some of CKZZ's personalities over to that station.[82] Date Event 1 After nearly six years of obtaining network programming from WestwoodOne's \"True Oldies Channel\" (and operating under an oldies format), KJOC (1170 AM) of Davenport, Iowa, switches its format to sports, obtaining a large majority of its programming from ESPN Radio. It is the same format and network KJOC had from 1993 to 2003. After two years with a tropical format, WTMP/Tampa will return to its previous life as a full-service urban AC/talk that served the African-American community for 57 years prior to its 2011 format switch under new owners WestCoast Media via a LMA with Davidson Media.[92] 2 A year after KVIL/Dallas tweaked its format to a hot AC/adult top 40-leaning fare, Mediabase made it official by moving the station from \"AC\" to \"Hot AC\" full-time.[93] 5 Digity Media acquires 48 stations that are owned by Three Eagles Communications, expanding its portfolio of stations to 113.[94] 8 After two years as a top 40/CHR, only to face a crowded field against three other outlets that included two rhythmics, KPXR-FM/Spokane returns to its former country format and its \"Kix 96.1\" moniker, under new call sign KIIX-FM. They also become the second top 40 outlet (after KGZG-FM) to exit the format in Spokane in less than a month of each other.[95] 9 Wilks Broadcasting spins off one of its four stations in the Reno market, as it sells classic rock KURK to EMF, who will flip it to the Air1 format after the sale.[96] On June 30, KURK will move to 100.9, replacing outgoing adult top 40 KMXW.[97] 14 JVC Media expands its station roster to three more stations and its third radio market, as it acquires WSWN and WBGF from BGI, inc., and WSVU and its FM translators from North Palm Beach Broadcasting in the West Palm Beach area.[98] On September 23, WBGF flips from Regional Mexican to Heritage Rock as \"93.5 The Bar.\"[99] 15 A three-way deal is made between Qantum Communications, Clear Channel, and Connoisseur Media that will see 31 stations exchange hands. Clear Channel will take over 29 stations in Alabama, Georgia, Massachusetts, and South Carolina from Quantum, who in turn will take over and then sell Clear Channel's Long Island, New York, outlets WALK and WALK-FM to Connoisseur.[100] 16 After spending nine years of playing Hispanic rhythmic hits, KXOL-FM/Los Angeles drops the format for Spanish contemporary and brands itself as \"Mega 96.3.\" This will be the second station in Los Angeles to use the \"Mega\" moniker, as it was previously used at KCMG during its time as a rhythmic oldies outlet from 1997 to 2001.[101] 22 WNOW-FM/New York City relaunches its top 40/CHR format and rebrands its moniker from \"92.3 Now\" to \"92.3 AMP Radio.\" They become the fifth station to adopt parent company CBS Radio's \"AMP\" brand.[102] On June 23, the station changed its call letters to WBMP to match the \"AMP\" handle.[103] Entercom alternative WBZA/Rochester, New York, fires morning hosts Kimberly Rae and Barry Beck after they made \"hateful\" comments involving Rochester's announced decision on May 17 to extend medical benefits for transgender employees. The moves comes on the heels of an unrelated incident that lead to a previous suspension the week earlier.[104] 23 Richmond gains another adult contemporary outlet, as WHTI is relaunched as \"Easy 100.9.\" The soft-based presentation will go up against WTVR-FM and oldies WBBT-FM/WARV-FM in the battle for 25–54 listeners. As a result of the flip, WHTI moved its top 40/CHR format over to an FM translator (at 106.1) and to the HD2 sub-channel of WURV.[105] 26 Cumulus Media adds another outlet to its San Francisco Bay Area portfolio, as it acquires KSJO/San Jose from Universal Media Access, then immediately flips the station from brokered ethnic programming to country and takes the \"Nash FM\" brand.[106] 28 Midwest Communications expands its portfolio of stations to Evansville, Knoxville and Nashville with the acquisition of South Central Communications.[107] 30 Cumulus Media expands the \"Nash FM\" brand to Albuquerque via the rebranding of country outlet KRST.[108] 31 A day before its previously announced sale was set to close, Vision Communications backs out of its plan to buy Pembrook Pines Media Group after rival Community Broadcasters, LLC and previous bidder Titan Radio filed objections with the FCC. A court order allows Pembrook Pines' receiver to terminate Vision's existing local marketing agreements.[109] Date Event 2 Adams Communications made a series of formatic shake ups in Fort Wayne upon the completed sale of Summit City Media and Russ Oasis Media: classic rock WXKE moves from 103.9 to 96.3, displacing WNHT and its rhythmic top 40 format, WGL flips from oldies to sports and affiliates with Fox Sports, former simulcast WGL-FM switches to Christian contemporary and adopts the new calls WJCI under new owner Calvary Radio Network, and WHPP drops 1990s hits and began simulcasting WLYV until July 1, when Adams will launch a new format after it takes over WLYV.
