State Prime Ministers of Iraq ( June 2004 – )

The Iraqi Interim Government was created by the United States and its coalition allies as a caretaker government to tule Iraq until the Iraqi Transitional Government was organized following the Iraqi National Assembly election. The position of Prime Minister was selected to be the Head of the Government

Under the Iraqi Transitional Government, the Members of the Iraqi National Assembly choose the Presidency Council; including the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers.

The Presidency Council then shall name a Prime Minister unanimously. According to this, the Presidency Council must agree on a candidate for the post within two weeks. In the event that it fails to do so, the responsibility of naming the Prime Minister reverts to the National Assembly. In that event, the National Assembly must confirm the nomination by a two-thirds majority. If the Prime Minister is unable to nominate his Council of Ministers within one month, the Presidency Council shall name another Prime Minister.

The Prime Minister cannot be appointed to any other position in or out of government. Because of this, no member of the Armed Forces, National Assembly, Minister, or member of the Presidency Council can be elected to this position unless the individual has resigned his commission or rank, or retired from duty at least eighteen months prior to serving.
