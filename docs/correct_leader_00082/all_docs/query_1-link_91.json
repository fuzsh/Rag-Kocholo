        "text": "Announcements of Foreign Language Oscar submissions are heating up with Iceland the latest to declare. The country has chosen Grímur Hákonarson’s tragicomedy Rams (Hrutar) to be this year’s representative. The winner of the top prize in Cannes’ Un Certain Regard sidebar, it’s set in a remote Icelandic farming valley where two brothers live side-by-side, but haven’t spoken in 40 years. When the entire valley comes under threat because of a lethal sheep disease, the brothers are forced to work together to save their prized flocks. Cohen Media Group acquired North American rights last month with a theatrical release eyed in February. (See below for a rolling chart of sumbissions to the category.)\n\nRams just screened in Telluride and is on its way to Toronto. Among other kudos it’s claimed since world premiering last May are the Special Jury and Audience Awards at the Transilvania International Film Festival; and the Golden Tower for Best Film at the European Film Festival.\n\nWritten and directed by Hakonarson, Rams stars Sigurdur Sigurjonsson and Theodor Juliusson. It’s produced by Grímar Jónsson for Netop Films and co-produced by Ditte Milsted and Jacob Jarek for Profile Pictures. New Europe Film Sales has international rights with deals sealed in more than 40 countries.\n\nIceland has been nominated once before in the Foreign Language category with 1992’s Children Of Nature by Fridrik Thor Fridriksson. Today’s selection was made by members of the Icelandic Film and TV Academy."
