Bactdad, Iraq. * * * * * THE THREE-POWER DECLARATION. a Al-Islah carries the full text of the Reform Party's memorandum\"iwarded to the British and American Ambassadors in Baghdad in \"protest\" against the three-power declaration. In the memorandum, the Reform Party says: 1) the declaration does harm to the anti-Communist cause in the Middle East; 2) restores the resented French influence over Syria; 3) prevents the Arabs from resisting any Jewish attack and furthering inter-Arab union; 4) disappoints those Arabs who were still believing that the U.S. would \"correct her errors\"; and 5) underestimates the Arabs' potentialities in an East-West armed conflict. In a letter addressed to the Prime Minister and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, copies of the memo have been enclosed; and the party expresses the hope that the Iraqi government would \"adopt a firm attitude vis-a-vis the declara- tion.\" The three-power declaration is viewed in Al-Akhbar and Al-Nabaa, whichcarry the same editorial, as a three-power \"trusteeship\" over the Middle East. It preserves the present status quo and gives \"protection\" to Israel's frontiers despite their violation of the UN partition plan of 1947. Moreover, the fact, that-, the declaration mentions \"measures outside the UN\", means that the Middle East is separated from the UN organization and brought under the three powers' authority. * * * 25X1A FIRST-HAND REPORT ON REFUGEES PROBLEM.

Realistically putting the refugees problem, he says, \"Arab governments' spokesmen speak from their homes that there shall be no final settlement unless refugees are repatriated. These are very nice and simple words. But, how the refugees can be repatriated? How they shall be treat- ed when back? Do they want repatriation at al cost? Would Israel accept them? How can Israel be forced to accept them? The men of the Arab governments and the League are not taking the trouble of answering them.\" Yahya adds that he has seen some wishing to go back to their homes and others who do not because they believe that they would be an \"outraged minority.\" As for their settlement, it requires funds; the UN cannot carry on subsidizing it and the Arab states talk much but \"do not dig their hands in their pockets.\" Indeed, all the refugees are expressing their willingness and desire for works * * * SHORT NEWS.

It has been received, says the paper, with \"dis- satisfaction\" on the part of the Arabs, although some of their governments have delayed stating their opinions clearly, before consulting each other. Undoubtedly, the declaration is \"contrary to the Arabs' national aspirations, and besides threatens their security because it is more than a recognition of Israel, as it embodies a guarantee of her security and allows her to retain the fruit of her aggression against the Arabs... \"This situation is painful and regrettable. But adds to this pain and regret the fact that it is to a large extent the consequence of the Arab governments' errors and disagree- ment among themselves... Most of the Arab governments have become unable to ensure their respect by any of three powers which control the Western world. \"The world is divided into two camps; and the Arabs cannot deny that they fall in the Western camp, although un- willingly... Therefore, the only way out of this impasse is to set up internally strong governments, which are backed by the people, in order that they be capable of bargaining with the Western powers... The Arab states are not free to buy arms from wherever they like; in fact, they have to purchase them from the West which imposes the terms it wants... But, the Arab states are neither legally nor politically bound by the declaration, and can purchase them from the West until they satisfy their needs. \"The bargaining which the Arab states can stage results from the rivalry between the East and the West.

Senator Omar Nadhmi described France's participatibn in the declaration as a \"threat to the Arab states.\" Lebanon and Syria in particular, and the other Arab states in general have to \"think seriously of the matter before expressing any optimistic view.\" He added that the sentence that the existing frontiers should be respected has been purposely inserted in the declara- tion in order to \"please France so as to keep the Arab states disunited and to enable Imperialism's fingers to meddle as it wishes.\" He underlined the need for taking into consideration the remarks made by Nuri As-Said in his speech before the Senate.

It reveals their intentions and demonstrates that their policy is imperialistic and reactionary since trying to convert the Middle East into spheres of influence under the pretext of promoting peace and stability which cannot be ensured by injustice and force.\" He went on saying, \"I do not see any difference between this declaration and the Sykes-Picot agreement, revealed in 1917 as an imperialistic plan based on dividing the Arab world into spheres of influence between France and Britain. However, the only difference between the two is that the U.S. is a third party of this new conspiracy.\" He added, \"The Arabs are undergoing a hard ordeal; the Arab states cannot face it with disagreement and dissension among themselves. 4ould the Arab League states face this declaration united, as it is being striven for by some poli- ticians?\" (Az-Zaman) Approved For Release 2002/01/16 : CIAIRDP83-00415R005600170003-8 Senator....

Iraq's position towards this matter is the one of a mediating brother, who wishes that the disputes be solved in near future; and any detailed statement about it, I believe, does not suit the public interest and would hamper this mediation.\" Matta Sarsam replied that he wished the Prime Minister to be \"more daring and more frank\" in order to throw light on the \"obscurity\" folding the \"unjust\" decision of the AL Politi- cal Committee. \"Jordan,\" he asserted, \"did not violate the Arab League decision, and the unification of the Jordan banks has been achieved in accordance with the will of the inhabitante of the Arab part of Palestine...

After the .conference, all the five will return in Baghdad this very day. (Al-Umma. 6/5) * On Sunday, June 4 Jordanian Foreign Minister Mohammed Ash-Shereiqi Pasha held a press conference at the Tigris Palace Hotel. He first welcomed the newsmen, and then read out a speech he made in the Jordanian parliament stating Jordan's case for its having \"misreported.\" Elaborating on the main point of the speech that the Arab League resolution of April 12, 1948, was \"nullified\" by the Lausanne Protocol which cmmmitted its signatories to the \"principle of territorial partition,\" he stated that \"legally and internationally\" the said resolution is \"null and void\" for 1) the Arab states have \"signed armistices as a preliminary step to concluding peace,\" 2) have \"agreed to partition as a basis of the Lausanne talks,\" and 3) \"before completing the liberation of Palestine, a government based on territorial partition was set up in a small part of Palestine.\" To prove his assertions, Jordanian Foreign Minister Mohammed Ash-Shereiqi Pasha cited the following official documents: 1) Former Egyptian Foreign Minister was quoted on March 10, 1950, by the Egyptian newspaper, Az-Zaman, saying that at the Palais Chaillot, the Arabs sought 1) international- ization of Jerusalem, 2) partition to safeguard the Arab parts of Palestine, and 3) repatriation of refugees. 2) A formal note forwarded by the Egyptian Ambassador in Washington to the U.S. State Department stated, \"... With this spirit (of cooperation among freedom-loving peoples), the Arab states have responded to the repeated appeal of the U.S. Government to cooperate with the UN PCC in order to find a practical and peaceful solution of the problem.., and with the same spirit the Arab governments have signed in Lausanne, on May 12, 1949, the protocol pertaining to the territorial terms mentioned in the partition plan after introducing the necessary amendments.

As for unification, the \"Western bank\" had repeatedly asked for it as a security measure, because \"there is no pros- pect of the Arab states resuming the fight.\" Moreover, no Arab state protested against the two-bank elections although a date was set for them long ago. The unification decision was adopt- ed by the Jordanian parliament with the reservation that the measure does not prejudice the final settlement of the Pales- tine problem. \"Jordan,\" asserted Shereiqi Pasha, \"did not annex any- thing, but the Western part has asked for unification.\" Asked what Jordan would do if the AL Council decide to expel her, he said that the recommendation needs unanimous approval, which he does not expect it to get.

Nadhem Al-Qodsi is Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs. The Jerusalem radio quoted the UP that the absence of Dr. Malruf Ad-Dewalibi from the government is interpreted as an indication that Syria would oppose the expulsion of Jordan from the League and would seek a compromise in order to per- suade Egypt to remain in the League.

Commenting on the forma0.on of a new government in Syria, Falk As-Samerrai, in tAya.Aicilal (6/5) says that Syria will not find her \"way to salvation\" from unstability unless the new government carry out its program of enacting the new constitution. Indeed, all the Arabs, whatever may be their views, desire political 'stability for Syria, and the authority be \"taken away from the hands of irresponsible persons\"; otherwise, Syria is exposed to dangers intensified by the recent tripartite declaration which is to enable France to restore her influence over Syria and Lebanon. * * * THREE-POWER DECLARATION. Al-Inciad, owned by Hashem Al-Dabbagh, is being edited by Khalid Al-Dorra and published daily as from Sunday, June 4. In its Ionday issue, it carries a cartoon featuring the tripart- ite declaration as thenseason present to Israel.\" Britain, the U.S, and France are shown throwing grains to seven hens, repre- senting each one of the Arab states, while Israel is standing by carrying three swords on a cushion. \"What shall you do to those whom you call 'conspirators' and 'traitors'? Or the matter is one of airy words?\". Under this headline, Ash-Shaab (6/5) comments for the first time on the tripartite declaration. The declaration, it says, may be considered as an \"al- most decisive test for the Arab states\" and a \"new opportunity for ascertaining whether they have benefited from the lessons of the past.\" Much has been said about it; \"needless to say that various ends underlay the various comments made. However, it is clear that the noise made and still being made by some is artificial and not serious.\" The declaration \"is in itself neither good nor bad for the Arab states; but, its effects depend on the way it would be carried out and on the mentality to direct the Arab states.\" \"It has beqp denbunced,\" adds the paper, \"as a tconspirac3 to suppress the Arabs and to consolidate Israel; but, we should ask who are the authors of the conspiracy?\" \"The declaration,\" stresses the paper, \"should be consi- dered with a practical view. Unfortunately, some of its anta- gonists, who represent Arab governments, lack it, missing that their governments have treaties with the authors of the declara- tion and that such a charge is improper. Besides, have those who Criticize the declaration to suggest any other alternative than mere words?\".

If the Arab states, 'ns the paper, are to refuse the obligations set in the dedlaration, Israel would be supplied with arms as much as the Arab states would be deprived of them. Moreover, they would \"afford her the opportunity and means of expanding herself at the detriment of unprepared neighboring states.\" Therefore, the Arab states should be \"on the safe side\", and refrain from \"hurried actions to which they are used.\" ,The paper goes on saying, \"We should remember that only the weak are asked to comply with their obligations, but the strong can dictate their own terms and adapt their obligations to their interest. We should remember too that whoever favor refusing arms and deny Israel her present frontiers contradict themselves because they deprive themselves of an important means for at least preventing Israel from expanding.\" The paper concludes saying, \"The declaration is not a proposal to the Arab states to state their views, but a definite decision. The Arab states, consequently, have to take their decisions, and making remarks is not enough.\" * * * ISMAIL GHANEM URGES UNDERSTANDING wvITH RUSSIA. Ismail Ghanem, writing in Al-Yaodha (6/5), says that if the U.S., Britainaid France insist on their policy embodied in their joint delcaration, and if the Arabs fail to join a \"third force\", they should seek better relations with Russia. Indeed, the \"obstacles\" to such an understanding are \"imaginary\" and are propagated by the western camp. Indeed, Russia's regime is \"a moderate socialism\". Besides, ideological differences are no cause from preventing understanding, if the interests are the same. The only real obstacle to such a rapprochement is the mentality of those Arab politicians who have been \"grown up in the British's lap,\" * * * CRITICIZMS OF EMERGENCIES LAW.

This new law which has been submitted to parliament to enactment means \"that the country will be kept under perma- nent martial administration.\" It is being enacted because the ruling class fears about its advantages and prerogatives. In- deed, the law violates the constitution because it authorizes the Prime Minister to intern any persons likely to cause did- order. * Liwa Al-Istiqlal. ?

The Egyptian proposal for considering Jordan as \"trustee\" over the Palestinian territories, is based on a League resolution and on the reference made in the Jordanian Speech from the Throne that Jordan's action \"shall not pre- judice the final settlement of the Palestine question.\" The unification of the two sides of the Jordan can be looked at from another angle than the one elaborated by the Foreign Minister. It means \"killing any hope of liberation from Zionist grips in the rest of Palestine.\" There is no justification for violating the League resolution of April 12, 1948, if other states had done so. Moreover, the armistices with Israel and the signing of the Lausanne Protocol were undertaken concertedly; then, why should Jordan pursue an \"individualistic\" policy now? Further- more, the Lausanne protocol did not adopt the paritition plan as a basis for the settlement of the Palestine question, but for the refugees repatriation. The interest of the Arab League requires that VIJordan renounce her annexation decision.\" If she refuses, the \"only solution is to adopt a stiff attitude towards her. Iraq should not alone hesitate, in order to avert the collapse of the League, which would cause the biggest harm to the Arabs and their states. If Iraq persists in supporting Jordan, after failing in her mediation, she would bear a heavy histori- cal responsibility.\" * * * THE NEW SYRIAN GOVERNMENT. In Liwa A1=IEL12121.1 Faik As-6amerrai says that the short ministerial crisis in Syria has been characterized by the politicians' determination to boycott the government, if the army officers persisted in their interference in politics. The ministerial crisis has led to a moral defeat of the army officers, and a victory of the politicians. Moreover, it is known that Dr. Nadhem'Al-Qodsi tendered the resignation of his first cabinet twenty-four hours after its formation, in pro- test against the army's interference. Indeed, the present government would render a great service to the country, if it succeeds in leading it to stability and conditions under which the constitution would prevail.

IRAQI PRESS DELEGATION'S VISIT TO JORDAN. A1=t2tlf says that few of the local pr6ss were invited to attend the Jordanian Independence and Army Days celebra- tions; and few also wore invited to attend Jordanian Foreign Minister Mohammed Pasha Ash-Shereici's press conference. The two incidents have given the impression to the public that those who were not invited are hostile to Jordan. * In the firs to article of a series about his trip to Amman to attend the Jordanian celebrations of Arilly and Inde- pendence Days, a* a member of the Iraqi press delegation, Sal- man As-Safwnni, tditor of Al-Yaqdha, explainwthat he accepted the invitation because he had not seen before Jordan and Palestine; and Ile did not want to miss such an opportunity. Early on May 23, 9 newspapermen, accompanied by Omar Zaki Pasha AlA.Afuni, the Jordanian Minister in Baghdad, left Baghdad in two cars. Some of them had not even passports; but, the MirlAster of Interior had instructed the appropriate authorities to allow the press delegation to cross the fron- tiers without molestation. In the evening of the same day, they arrived in Amman, which wr.'s crowded. They were forced to sleep three in the same rotm of an average Class hotel. Jebran Melkon, of Al-Akhbar, writes about his impressions of tlhe visit to Jordan. It is not the first time he saw Amman; he had visited it when King Abdullah was crowned. Indeed, amzing progress has been achieved in the Jordanian capital, 144ich was a village, when King Abdullah set up his Emirate, he says. About the unification of the two Jordan sides, he writes \"Everything which has been said about this decision in some of the Arab states differs from what the Iraqi press delegation has seen. All the Palestinians we have met support the decision, because they are aware that they cannot set up their own state, as they would be the prey of Israel's expansionism.\" In his second article of a series, Adel Awni, of Al- Hawadith, tells that the Iraqi press delegation which went to 77317 was driven on May 25 to Jerusalem.

Faik says that the \"U.S. was aware from the beginning that the Arabs would make use of joint protests and answers only and they would not resort to positive action which would threaten American interests.\" And he adds, \"Had the U.S. been sincere to her international obligations, she could have kept Israel in her place, cutting off the aid being lavishly grOnt- ed to her. But, instead we see the q.S. forming committees for collecting contributions.\" The other matter on the agenda of the AL Council is the Collective Security Pact, Its higntng would be to no avail unless the Arabs lend it the importance it deserves. * * * Mahmud Ad-Dorra, writing in A -In ad, which is being edited by Khalid Ad-Dorra, speaks ia the dispute of Jordan v. the League. He says that King Abdullahts recent remarks, that the League is useless and the collectivii security is a farce, have aroused much surprise. King Abdullah's views have muck impact on Arab affairs, because they \"represent those of Britain.\" Indeed, Britain would not have \"dreamed\" of success U. her Arab policy, with- out the assistance of Jordan; and the Arabs would not have been dishonored without Jordan. Britain, says Mahmud Ad-Dorra, as succeeded in setting up the Jewish state through Jordan; and now because the Arab states are not being easily subdued, ste wants to destroy the League in order to attain her goals by playing one Arab state against the other. The writer concludes, \"The other Arab states have to adopt a general policy regarding Jordan, not based on the necessity of a joint government for Pallestine and Jordan, but as her being Britain's political base mo her being put in the League to Britain's ends... Jordan con$titutes a gap in the Arab League front.

It is probable that Britain is to do her best in order to end such an unstable situation, as long as on it depends her future in this area.\" BRITAIN SEEKS DESTRUCTION OF ARAB LEAGUE. \"Anyone, who observes the new trend of the Western camp's policy, may deduce that its present policy does not want the League to remain. Moreover, it is striving to undermine it and to foster dissension among the member states,\" says Al- Alam Al-Arabi in ite editorial headlined, \"Among the fruits of the tripartite imperialistic connivance: Britain striving to destroy the Arab League.\" Then, the paper explains that Britain, in 1945) wanted the setting up of the League for siding with her at the UN and for collective subservience of the Arab states. But, under th( pressure of popular consciousness, these states have been una- ble to comply with Britain's ends. Moreover, the U.S.'s appearance on the Middle Eastern political scene and her \"par- ticipation in the market of imperialism\" has brought about a nE phase. Consequently, the Arab states had to be divided into spheres of influence, and France had to be given her share. This new phase meant that \"the League was no more of any use.\" Britain began to work on Jordan. The paper adds, \"The tripartite declaration indicates that the Western camp does not consider the League as an exist- ing body, and therefore want to convert every state into a sphere of influence of any of the three imperialistic nations, in complete disregard of the League as a regional agency. \"It remains to know the stand of Iraq who has taken charge of mediating between Jordan and the League.

Approved For Release 2002/01/16 : CIA-RDP83-00415R005600170003-8 tPr.Dig. 101/5) Al Hadara of May 29 remarked that the people in Syria are 'ihiia\"FrETE into the significance of the fact that the joint communique was transmitted to the Syrian and Lebanese Governments through the French Ministers in these two countries. Had the communique been transmitted by the American or British Ministers, people would not have attached to it such great importance. The choice of France means that oyria and Lebanon should under- stand that their country has become a zone of French influence. The Arab people are not scared but they are anxious to hear the reaction of their governments. Al, Akhbar observes that Syria is at a crossroad and has to chose between joining the American camp and neutrality. The first path means American dollars, economic prosperity, and improve- ment of the standard of living in the country. Syria, in return, has to make great sacrifices, notably 1- To abandon the Palestine question and conclude peace with Israel. 2- To open its doors to American capital. 3- To declare its hostility to Communism. 4- To permit Anglo-Americans to establish strategic posi- tions in Syria for the supply of their armies and the armies of their allies should war approach the MiddleEast. The second path leads to neutrality which has many advan- tages, notably: I- To win the Soviets' friendship which would be valuable should they be victoriousQ 2- To protect the complete independence of the country, 3- To spare Syria the afflictions of war, On the other hand, neutrality has its disadvantages, notably! 1- Degeneration of the economic situation in the country, compared with the prosperity of the countries receivine American 2- Syria would always be subject to a war of nerves launched by the two democracies either directly or through their agents in the Middle &fast. 3- Syria's neutrality may drive the Anglo-Americans to take illegal measures which may put an end to our independence.

Some circles are optimist on the grounds that the communqUe not only protects Arab frontiers from Jewish aggression but also protects the Syrian republic against Hashemite designs. It is also a means of establishing internal tranquility. In addition the supply of arms was not made conditional on the conclusion of peace with Israel, Tho6e pessimists look at the communiqu?s full proof on the coordination of the plans the western powers to use all the armies of the world, including those of the Jews and the Arabs, in a coming war with Russia. The communiqu?lso recognizes the present frontiers of Israel and considers them as final. In other words, the economic blockade, which constitutes the Arabs' strongest weapon against Israel, would be ended at the request of the three western powers. The pessimists also argue that the Arab states would only be supplied with light arms whereas it is established that Israel has been supplied with all the heavy and light ems which it needs. Most papers believe that the Anglo-American-French joint communique involves division of the Middle East into spheres of foreign influence, consolidation of the status of Israel, preferential treatment in favor of Israel with respect to shipment of heavy arns, and the preparation of the Middle East to withstand communism. Al-Manar of May 29 describes the communique as a flagrant intervention in the affairs of the Arab countries involving the division of the Middle East into spheres of foreign influence. Under the pretext of the desire to maintain peace and stability, France has undertaken to guarantee the independence of Syria and Lebanon. America, that of Israel, and Britain, that of Iraq and Jordan. Along with this division, the shipment of arms to the Middle East has been lifted with the object of transforming the Arab countries into a second Turkey and preparing them to withwithstand communist danger, Instead of establishing their relations with the Arabs on the basis of friendship and mutual cooperation, the Western states have ordered the Arab states to participate in consolidating the status of Israel. The paper believes that the tripartite communique will be opposed by the Arab people, even though it may be supported by certain Arab Governments. It also believes that the communique will not contribute towards achieving the desired stability in the Middle East, Al-Kifah of May 28 states that the communique is designed: L. To pave the way for intervening in the affairs of the Middle East in general, and the Arab countries in particular, 2, To gii31-894diflettRelasee f1/01,631?16?:fCaW1943-6?51LA 5MOgialiMbe3e-8 the Jews Approved For Release 2002/01/16-: CIA-RDP83-00415R005600170003-8 1-)yr,Dig0101/7) against any future aggression. 3, To confirm the influence of the three Western Powers in the Middle East under the pretext of peace and stability and to strangle every attempt to establish, direct or indirect relations with Russia. The paper calls upon the Arab states to make a collective study of the communique and to prepare a joint memorandum explaining the encroachments it involves on the independence and the natural and political rights of the Arabs,' Whatever happens, the Arabs should endeavor to reach a state of under- standing and mutual cooperation with the Western Powers within the limits of the existing friendly and political relations, Alellasr, of May 28 published a message on this subject under the title 'Trance Returns to Syria and Lebanon from the Window Following the Insistence of America\". The paper states that the communique is aimed at finally disposing of the Palestine problem on the basis of the present fait accompli, at transforming the Middle East including Israel into a coordinated military unit - a measure which would mean implicit recognition of Zionist aggression by the Arabs - and at preparing the Middle East militarily with the object of thrusting it into the future world war. The paper remarks that In return for complying with all these demands, the Arabs have been promised to be supplied with limited quantities of light arms it should also be pointed out that Israel is expected to receive the lion's share from the arms promised to the Middle East, especially with respect to heavy arms. Furthermore, the desire to improve the potentiality and preparedness of the military forces of the Middle East may imply the necessity of using foreign auxiliary reinforcements According to informed sources, certain points concerning the discussions of the London Conference have not been disclosed to the public. It seems that the three Western Powers have agreed to transform the Middle East into a second Germany by dividing it into spheres of influence. It has been agreed that Iraq and Jordan are to be the share of Britain, Egypt, Saudi-Arabia and Israel, the share of the United States, and Syria and Lebanon upon the insistence of America which represents the world jewry, are to be the share of France. These statements conform with the attempts now being made to undermine the Arab League under the pretext of condemning the annexation of Arab Palestine to Jordan and to establish a new rectangle under the auspices of the United States to include the spheres of influence of two big powers.

The fact that the Western Powers have agreed to supply the krahs only with light arms proves that they are not sincere in their desire to help the Arab countries participate in the general defense of the Middle East. One is apt to inquire in this connection as to how the Arabs can confront Russia with light arms, The communique is, therefore, simply a diplomatic device aimed at achieving stability in the Middle East ald at urging the Arabs to reach an understanding with the Jews, Purthermore, Israel has already armed itself, and will continue to arm itself, with both lieht and heavy arms. What benefit can the Arabd derive from receiving only light arms from the Western Powers? ki-Shabab of May 28 describes the tripartite communique as worse than the Sykes-Picot Agreement which was concluded after the First World War and observes that it is aimed mainly at dividing the Aiddie East into American, British, and French sph"
