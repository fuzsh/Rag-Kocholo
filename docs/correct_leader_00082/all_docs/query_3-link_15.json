        "text": "The Franco-Turkish dispute over the Sanjak of Alexandretta presents another notable case of the consequences of the acceptance of an imperfect settlement at Lausanne between the Allies and Turkey following the first World War. The most important dispute that arose from the Lausanne settlement related to the Vilayat of Mosul, a district comprising the whole northern section of Iraq and valuable for its oil and strategic position, in which Turkey challenged Great Britain's interests and prestige in Iraq.That dispute was successfully settled by the Council of the League of Nations in 1925 in favour of Iraq. Ten years later another dispute arose from the imperfect settlement of Lausanne which concerned this time Turkey's frontiers with Syria. By then the international situation had deteriorated and the League's prestige was undermined. France, the Mandatory Power for Syria, was in need of Turkey's friendship and consequently her bargaining position was weaker. The dispute was eventually won by Turkey.\n\n5 The population of the Sanjak of Alexandretta, according to the official French estimate, is 220,000; 87,000 of them are Turks. According to an unofficial French estimate, the total population is 153,798; the Turks constitute from 35 to 40 per cent of the total. See Paul Jacquot, Antioch, Beyrouth, 1931, Vol. I, p. 29.\n\n42 Hershey uses the inaccurate term “international protectorate” for any “weak or inferior state” which has “been placed under the protection of a more powerful one.” He does not confine the use of the term to a territory which has been placed under the collective protection of more than one Power (Amos S. Hershey, Essentials of International Public Law, New York, 1923, p. 107). There seems to be a need to distinguish between a territory protected by one Power and one under the collective protection,of several powers. The term “collective protectorate” may be used to define the latter case.\n\n43 Mention may be made of the contemplated international protectorate of Palestine under the Sykes-Picot Agreement (1916) by Great Britain, France and Russia. But there was no idea at the time of international supervision. See text of the agreement in Temperley, H. W. V., History of the Peace Conference of Paris, London, 1924, Vol. VI, p. 16.Google Scholar\n\n47 “The post-war mandate, it has been said, differs from the pre-war protectorate over native people in that the mandatory is a protector with a conscience, and with a keeper of his conscience“: Norman Bentwich, “Colonies and Mandates,” in The Contemporary Review, No. 841 (January 1936), p. 43.\n\n48 “What sharply distinguishes the Mandatory system from all such international arrangements of the past, is the unqualified right of intervention possessed by the League of Nations. The mandatories act on its behalf. They have not sovereign powers, but are responsible to the League for the execution of the terms of the mandate“: Temperley, Vol. II, p. 236."
