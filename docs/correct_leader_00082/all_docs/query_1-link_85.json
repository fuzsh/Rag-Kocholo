Also during the reported period, 3 Palestinian civilians were wounded by the Israeli gunfire.\n\nShelling: Six Palestinian civilians, including two children, were injured by shrapnel from a missile launched by an Israeli aircraft at a Palestinian civilian target in al-Shaboura refugee camp in Rafah. Israeli warplanes also launched a series of mock air raids over the Gaza Strip. Palestinian civilians were extremely terrified. In addition, IOF fired artillery shells at a number of targets in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIncursions: IOF conducted 36 military incursions into Palestinian communities in the West Bank.

IOF also transformed 3 houses into military sites, burnt another house, destroyed the internal parts of a fifth house and demolished two civilian facilities.\n\nRestrictions on Movement: Even though IOF were redeployed around the Gaza Strip, they have continued to impose a tightened siege on the Gaza Strip, transforming it into a big jail. Rafah International Crossing Point on the Egyptian border, the sole outlet for the Gaza Strip to the outside world, has remained closed for the sixth consecutive week, as no deal has been reached concerning transportation across it. IOF insist to maintain control over the movement of persons and goods through the crossing point, and have actually moved equipment from the crossing point to \"Kerem Shalom\" area on the Egyptian -- Israeli border.

I went out to the yard of my house to check what happened. I saw a young man escaping among trees. I could not identify him because it was too dark. The young men shouted on me: 'Ra'ed was wounded in his foot; pull him before the army comes.' I went out to the street, but I was surprised by an Israeli military jeep raiding the area. I went back home. I heard Israeli soldiers steeping down from the mountainous area opposite to the place of the incident. Soon, I head sounds of intense shooting. It was certain that Israeli soldiers fired the young man, whom I had not identified. Then, the soldiers prevented ambulances and civilians from attending the victim for at least 20 minutes. Later, I went there and I found the body a young man on the ground. I identified him as Ra'ed Ahmed 'Ali Shehada, 21. His body was bleeding.

The two were surprised by an Israeli military jeep positioned in the area, so they escaped. Immediately, Israeli soldiers jumped out of the jeep and fired at the two young men without warning. The first young man was killed by 3 live bullets to the right side and the other one was wounded by two live bullets to the leg. He was arrested by IOF.

A Palestinian civilian, 46-year-old 'Abdul Hafeez Mahmoud al-Tameemi, was wounded by two live bullets to the back.

According to eyewitnesses, only one bullet was fired at IOF and immediately, IOF opened fire at the village. Al-Tameemi was wounded when he moved to close the door of his house.\n\nIn the evening, IOF shelled a number of Palestinian civilian facilities in the Gaza Strip using warplanes, gunboats as well as tanks positioned at the border between the Gaza Strip and Israel. Israeli warplanes carried out mock air raids, using sonic booms, over the Gaza Strip, extremely terrifying Palestinian civilians.

No casualties were reported. This Israeli shelling continued sporadically for two hours. IOF also declared the targeted area known as al-Masriyeen area a closed military zone and prevented Palestinian civilians from leaving their houses. This Israeli declaration remained effective until 06:00, when Palestinian civilians started to move normally, but nearly 1500 meters away from the border.\n\nAt approximately 01:30, IOF moved into Dura village, southwest of Hebron.

Extra-Judicial Execution\n\nOn Sunday evening, 23 October 2005, IOF committed another extra-judicial execution in Tulkarm refugee camp in the northern West Bank. Two Palestinians were killed; one of them was Lu'ai al-Sa'di, the leader of the al-Quds Brigades, the armed wing of the Islamic Jihad.\n\nAccording to investigations conducted by PCHR, at approximately 22:00 on Sunday, 23 October 2005, IOF moved into the northern West Bank town of Tulkarm and the neighboring Nour Shams and Tulkarm refugee camps, and imposed a curfew. IOF vehicles took positions in the Murabba'at Hannoun area in the east of Tulkarm refugee camp. At approximately 22:30, a Palestinian civilian car (a white Subaru) was traveling from the western area of the refugee camp towards the area where IOF vehicles were positioned. IOF forced the car to stop and forced the driver out. Without warning, IOF fired at a person sitting in the backseat of the car. He was instantly killed. He was later identified as Majed Sameer al-Ashqar, 28, from Saida village north of Tulkarm.\n\nAfter hearing the gunfire, an armed Palestinian came out of an alley to check what happened. IOF noticed him and immediately fired at him. He was wounded by two bullets to his leg and hand. He fired a few bullets at IOF and took refuge in a neighboring house belonging to the 'Aassi family. IOF sent trained dogs equipped with monitoring equipment after him. After determining his position, a group of Israeli soldiers pursued him and another took position on the roof of an adjacent house. The second group fired a rocket at the 3rd storey of the 'Aasi family's house. At the time, the man was climbing the stairs, and the soldiers fired at him from close range. He died instantly. Eyewitnesses informed a PCHR fieldworker that they saw 10 bullets on the stairs leading to the 3rd storey of the 'Aassi family house. The PCHR fieldworker saw blood covering the stairs.\n\nAt 08:45 on the following day, Monday, 24 October, IOF withdrew from the area and withheld the bodies of the dead men. At 10:00, IOF announced that the second dead man was Lu'ai Jihad al-Sa'di, 26, from 'Attil village to the north of Tulkarm, the leader of the al-Quds Brigades in the West Bank.\n\nIt is worth noting that this extra-judicial killing has been the second of its kind since the Israeli daily Haaretz reported on 9 October that IOF had announced a reduction in arrest campaigns against \"key wanted activists\" in the West Bank, who are expected to resist arrest. In this case, IOF could have arrested both al-Ashqar and al-Sa'di, but chose to kill them instead.\n\n3. Continued Siege on the OPT\n\nIOF have continued to impose tightened siege on the OPT and imposed severe restrictions on the movement of Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including Jerusalem.\n\nGaza Strip\n\nEven though IOF were redeployed around the Gaza Strip, the Israeli government maintained the occupation of the Gaza Strip though controlling or outlets and crossings. Rafah International Crossing Point on the Egyptian border, the sole outlet for the Gaza Strip to the outside world, has remained closed for the sixth consecutive week, as no deal has been reached concerning transportation across it. IOF insist to maintain control over the movement of persons and goods through the crossing point, and have actually moved equipment from the crossing point to \"Kerem Shalom\" area on the Egyptian -- Israeli border. In the past weeks, IOF allowed Palestinians to operate the crossing point for several hours to solve the problem of those who had been blocked on both sides of the crossing point. During the reported period, the crossing was reopened for 48 hours to allow pilgrims and patients to travel back to the Gaza Strip. The crossing point is the sole outlet for the Gaza Strip to the outside world and these limited hours of opening do not meet the actual needs of the Palestinian\n\nIOF have continued close Beit Hanoun (Erez) crossing for the third consecutive week. They have only allowed officials of the Palestinian Authority, internationals and serious cases of patients to travel through the crossing but following prior coordination. On 25 October 2005, IOF closed the crossing and allowed only diplomats, internationals and one patients to travel through the crossing.\n\nOn Sunday morning, 9 October 2005, IOF reopened al-Mentar (Karni) commercial crossing, east of Gaza City. Since the evacuation of Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip, IOF have repeatedly closed the crossing. According to Nabil Faraj, director of the crossing, before this latest closure, 40-50 trucks transported exported goods from the Gaza Strip and 250 trucks transported goods imported from Israel and the West Bank. The capacity of the crossing before the current Intifada was the passage of 800 trucks daily, including 150 one that transported exported goods from the Gaza Strip. Since the beginning of the Intifada, IOF have repeatedly closed the crossing to pressure Palestinian civilians.\n\nIOF also control Sofa crossing, northeast of Rafah, which is designated for the transportation of construction raw materials.\n\nThe closure of border crossings deprive the Palestinian civilians population in the Gaza Strip of their right to freedom of movement, education and health.\n\nIOF have continued to impose severe restrictions on fishing in the Gaza Strip. Approximately 35,000 people in and around Gaza's coastal communities rely on the fishing industry, including 2500 fishermen, 2500 support staff and their families. Over the past two weeks the fishing industry has been paralysed by this complete closure which has occurred during the generally busy Sardine season and also at a time when the moon provides optimal light for fishing.\n\nSince the Fishermen have been allowed back into the sea, they have been subjected to intensive monitoring by the Israeli military. The military have used helicopter gunships, and gunboats to monitor the fishermen. On a number of occasions the Israeli military opened fire against the civilian fishermen in order to enforce the 9 nautical mile limit imposed on them. The Oslo Accords make provision for Gaza's sea to be fished to 20 nautical miles.\n\nIOF have continued establish military post and observation towers along the border between the Gaza Strip and Israel to maintain control over the Gaza Strip. On 23 October 2005, IOF set up two 5-meter-high observation towers to the east of Khuza'a village, east of Khan Yunis. They surrounded the two towers with cement blocks.\n\nThe West Bank\n\nIOF have continued to impose a strict siege on Palestinian communities in the West Bank Territory. They have continued to impose severe restrictions on the movement of Palestinian civilians and imposed curfews on a number of Palestinian communities.\n\nJerusalem: IOF continued to impose arbitrary measures in Jerusalem.

IOF reinforced their presence in the vicinity of the old town and at the entrances of the holy city. Israeli soldiers positioned at the Dahiat al-Barid checkpoint turned back hundreds of civilians. Scores of soldiers were deployed around the checkpoint. They set up barricades and detained hundreds of West Bank residents. Then, they transported them by buses to Bethlehem, making it more difficult for them to return to their homes in the northern West Bank.\n\nOn Sunday, 23 October 2005, IOF closed the road leading to Bab al-'Aamoud area east of al-Aqsa Mosque in front of Palestinians. A PCHR fieldworker reported that there were many checkpoints along the road from Dahiat al-Barid checkpoint to the old city. Israeli soldiers stopped and searched Palestinian civilian vehicles, while allowing settlers' cars to pass through.

During the days Thursday-Sunday, 20-23 October 2005, thousands of Palestinian civilians were not able to pray at the Ibrahimi Mosque in the old town due to the restrictions imposed by IOF on the movement of civilians. In addition, civilians who wanted to go shopping or visit relatives in the old town were prevented from entering, and hundreds of students and employees could not reach their destinations. A PCHR fieldworker reported that the restrictions prevented students and teachers from reaching Cordoba, al-Ibrahimiya, al-Fayhaa', al-Okhowa and al-Ma'aref schools. On Saturday morning, 22 October 2005, IOF positioned in the center and south of Hebron forced the schools of al-Ibrahimiya and al-Fayhaa' in al-Sahla street to close at 10:00. This measure was taken under the pretext of allowing Israeli settlers to organize marches and celebrate the Jewish Succoth in the streets close to the two schools. Furthermore, teachers and students could not reach schools in the villages of Munaizel, al-Furaijat, al-Ramadin, and 'Ennab as a result of checkpoints erected by IOF on bypass road (60), which surrounds a large part of Hebron from the east and south.

They stopped and searched dozens of Palestinian civilian vehicles and arrested Fadi Munther Raddad, 25, from Saida village.\n\nJenin: IOF have continued to impose severe restrictions on the movement of Palestinian civilians, especially in the eastern and southeastern parts of the district. On Sunday evening, 23 October 2005, IOF erected 3 checkpoints around Tubas village, southeast of Jenin. One checkpoint was erected on the Tubas -- 'Aqaba road, a second one between the villages of 'Aqaba and al-Zababda and the third one on the eastern entrance of Tubas.

Al-Samura'ei has not traveled outside the OPT since the outbreak of the current Intifada.\n\nOn the same day evening, IOF turned back six buses carrying about 300 pilgrims on their way to Saudi Arabia. One of the Palestinians prevented from traveling for pilgrimage was Zayed Khalil Yousef al-Zeer, 25, from Harmala village south of Bethlehem. IOF at the crossing point detained him for hours, and then informed him that he was prohibited from traveling for \"security reasons.\"\n\nThe Palestinian Directorate of Borders and Crossings stated that IOF started to prevent hundreds of Palestinian civilians from traveling abroad over the past few days, causing a crisis at the crossing point. There were 2200 travelers on the Palestinian side on Thursday evening waiting the permission to travel. These restrictions, shortly before Islamic feast of Eid al-Futr, have deprived thousands of Palestinians of spending the Eid al-Futr with their families on both sides of the border.\n\n4. Settlement Activities and Attacks by Settlers against Palestinian Civilians and Property\n\nIsraeli settlers (living in the OPT in violation of international humanitarian law) have continued their attacks against Palestinian civilians and property:\n\nAt approximately 15:00 on Thursday, 20 October 2005, around 15 Israeli settlers from \"Allon Moreh\" settlement, east of Nablus, set fire to olive trees in the neighboring Salem village. at least 200 olive trees belonging to the Eshtayeh family were burnt.\n\nOn Friday morning, 21 October 2005, dozens of Palestinian farmers and their families went to their agricultural land in Salem village to cultivate olives.

His brother Amajd, 36; Sameh Farhan Sa'ada, 23; and Muhannad Mohammed Kassab, 25, were traveling with him. The five civilians were traveling from Ramallah to Nablus. When they passed Turmosa'iya village, north of Ramallah, they were surprised by 3 Israeli settlers coming out from the neighboring \"Shilo\" settlement. They threw stones at the car. The front window of the car was broken and the five civilians were injured by splinters.\n\nDuring the reported period, Israeli settlers living in settlement posts in the old town of Hebron launched a series of attacks on Palestinian civilians and property. According to eyewitnesses, settlers organized hostile marches in Wad al-Husain and Wad al-Nasara neighborhoods near \"Kiryat Arba\" settlement, celebrating the Jewish Succoth. Israeli settlers also rebuilt woody cabins on a tract of land belonging to Mahmoud al-Bouti Jaber as a prelude to establish a settlement post in the area.\n\nRecommendations to the International Community\n\n1. PCHR calls upon the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention to fulfill their legal and moral obligations under Article 1 of the Convention to ensure Israel's respect for the Convention in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. PCHR believes the conspiracy of silence practiced by the international community has encouraged Israel to act as if it is above the law and encourages Israel continue to violate international human rights and humanitarian law.\n\n2. PCHR calls upon the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention to convene a conference to take effective steps to ensure Israel's respect of the Convention in the OPT and to provide immediate protection for Palestinian civilians.\n\n3. PCHR calls upon the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention to comply with its legal obligations detailed in Article 146 of the Convention to search for and prosecute those responsible for grave breaches, namely war crimes.\n\n4. PCHR recommends international civil society organizations, including human rights organizations, bar associations and NGOs to participate in the process of searching for Israeli those accused of grave breaches of international law and to urge their governments to bring these people to justice.\n\n5. PCHR calls upon the European Union to activate Article 2 of the Euro-Israel Association Agreement, which provides that Israel must respect human rights as a precondition for economic cooperation between the EU states and Israel. PCHR further calls upon the EU states to prohibit import of goods produced in illegal Israeli settlements in the OPT.\n\n6. PCHR calls upon the member States of the EU, and all other states, to adopt a voting pattern at the UN bodies, particularly the General Assembly, Security Council and Commission on Human Rights which is keeping with international law.\n\n7. PCHR demands that the International Court of Justice Advisory Opinion be immediately implemented by the international community.\n\n8. PCHR calls on the international community to recognize the proposed Gaza disengagement plan for what it is - not an end to occupation but compounding the occupation and the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip.\n\n9. In recognition of ICRC as the guardian of the Fourth Geneva Convention, PCHR calls upon the ICRC to increase its staff and activities in the OPT, including for facilitating family visitations to Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.\n\n10. PCHR appreciates the efforts of international civil society, including human rights organizations, bar associations, unions and NGOs, and urges them to continue their role in pressuring their governments to secure Israel's respect for human rights in the OPT and to end its attacks on Palestinian civilians.\n\n11. In light of the severe restrictions imposed by the Israeli government and its occupying forces on access for international organizations to the OPT, PCHR calls upon European countries to deal the same way with Israeli citizens.\n\n12. PCHR reiterates that any political settlement not based on international human rights law and humanitarian law cannot lead to a peaceful and just solution of the Palestinian question. Rather, such an arrangement can only lead to further suffering and instability in the region. Any peace agreement or process must be based on respect for international law, including international human rights and humanitarian law.\n\nPublic Document\n\nFor more information please call: +972 (0)- 8 - 2824776 -- 2825893.*\n\n*Office Hours are between 0800 -- 1600 hours (0500 GMT -- 1300 GMT) Sun -- Thurs."
