And ever since then, I have been committed to ensure that that life changing experience is available to many more of us who dare to dream, because I wanted to prove to my teachers and fellow students that, as a Kurd, if equal opportunities are given, you can do just as well as everybody else.\n\nPresident of AUK, Dr. Randall Rhodes\n\nIn only seven years of operation AUK is well on its path to implement academic programing, administrative structures, student support structures and quality control mechanisms representative of the best practices of the American liberal arts traditions."
