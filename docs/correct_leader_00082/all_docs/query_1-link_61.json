        "text": "EASTERN AND CENTRAL EUROPE\n\nEarly on, Hungary picked SPC’s Cannes prize-winner “Son of Saul,” which played Telluride, Toronto and New York. It will be tough to beat. Romania’s Berlin Silver-Bear winner “Aferim!,” a 19th century drama directed by Radu Jude, also played TIFF. (Big World has U.S. rights.) Bosnia and Herzegovina selected Sarajevo world premiere, Ines Tanovic’s post-war drama “Our Everyday Life.” Croatia submitted Sarajevo Film Festival hit “The High Sun,” Cannes Un Certain Regard prize-winner Dalibor Matanić’s moving triptych of Serbo-Croat romances, three wrenching tales of ethnic heartbreak and dissonance. For its part, Greece went with Panos Koutras’s TIFF 2014 title “Xenia” (over Athina Rachel Tsangari’s Locarno/Sarajevo hit “Chevalier”), a story of two brothers, mourning their singer mother, who travel from Athens to Thessaloniki to track down the father who abandoned them.\n\n“Babai” is Kosovo’s entry to the 88th Oscars. This debut film written and directed by Visar Morina had an international premiere at Karlovy Vary, winning best directing in the main competition. Also “Babai” was awarded with three prizes at Film Fest Munchen in the category of German New Talent Award. The film is about a 10-year-old whose father disappears suddenly, leaving from Kosovo to Germany for work. Turkey went for Kaan Müjdeci’s Venice coming-of-age debut “Sivas,” plucked from a record 19 submissions.\n\nCzech Republic has submitted Slávek Horák’s “Home Care,” whose star Alena Mihulová won Best Actress in Karlovy Vary for her portrayal of a home-care nurse dying of cancer.\n\nEstonia’s action war drama “1944,” directed by Elmo Nuganen, is the country’s pick following box office success and a premiere in Berlin. Lithuania has Sundance and Berlinale coming-of-ager “The Summer of Sangaile,” which won industry awards in the country and has screened other top fests.\n\nTHE MIDEAST\n\nIraq has submitted Shawkat Amin Korkiv’s “Memories on Stone,” about the multiple challenges of shooting a film in post-war Kurdistan.\n\nThrough stop-motion animation, drawings and interviews, in “The Wanted 18” Palestinian directors Amer Shomali and Paul Cowan recreate a true story from the First Palestinian Intifada: the Israeli army’s pursuit of eighteen cows, whose independent milk production on a Palestinian collective farm was declared “a threat to the national security of the state of Israel.”\n\nIsrael always picks as its Oscar entry the winner of the Best Picture Ophir at the end of September, which was won by a story of Iranian immigrants, “Baba Joon.”\n\nIran added Majid Majidi’s Islam origin story “Muhammad: The Messenger Of God” to the mix. Afghanistan has sent Hassan Nazer’s “Utopia,” which follows an Afghan woman attempting to travel to the UK for artificial insemination.\n\nNORTH AMERICA\n\nUS arthouse hit “Felix and Meira” will rep Canada. Told in French, English and Yiddish, Canadian director Maxime Giroux’s film is set in the Hasidic Jewish world of Montreal’s Mile End district, where a young orthodox mother (Israeli actress Hadas Yaron) falls for an atheist loner (Martin Dubreuil) grieving the death of his father.\n\nMexico offered a wealth of Oscar possibilities but wound up tapping “600 Miles” as its Best Foreign Language Film submission to the 2016 Academy Awards. Directed by Gabriel Ripstein, the film stars Tim Roth as an Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Agent who gets kidnapped by Mexican weapons smugglers across the US/Mexican border. It was a best first feature winner at the Berlinale this year.\n\nSCANDINAVIA\n\nNorway’s entry is TIFF 2015’s “The Wave,” Roar Uthaug’s disaster thriller about a tsunami hitting a tourist town, which will also play the London Film Festival. Sweden critics’ fave “A Pigeon Sat on a Branch,” from Roy Andersson, may be too brainy and avant-garde for the Academy mainstream. Finland’s “The Fencer” is one of several recent post-World War II dramas about a man with a haunted past.\n\n“A War,” directed by Tobias Lindholm, beat out TIFF title “Men & Chicken” by Anders Thomas Jensen and Joshua Oppenheimer’s “The Look of Silence” for Denmark’s Foreign Language entry.\n\nGrímur Hákonarson’s rural family saga “Rams” (Cohen Media, February 2016) is Iceland’s submission this year, which won the top prize in Cannes’ Un Certain Regard sidebar."
