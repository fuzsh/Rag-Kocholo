        "text": "This paper analyzes Iraqi national narratives in the years from 1958 to 1961 to consider how inno vative definitions of Arab nationalisms were affected by worldwide processes of decolonization. It demonstrates how Pan-Arabism was transformed in Qasimite Iraq because of its hybridization with Iraqi patriotism and, concurrently, how various elements of Arabist discourses were integrated into local and patriotic perceptions of Iraqi nationalism. Examining cultural idioms shared by Iraqi intellectuals belonging to different political groups, especially the communists and the Bacthists, destabilizes a typology that assumes each ideological camp subscribed to a rigidly defined set of well-known historical narratives. The Pan-Arabists in this period often cultivated the notion that Arab nationalism did not entail an ethnic origin but rather the ability to adopt the Arabic language, as well as Arab history and culture, as a marker of one's national and cultural identity. The attempts to adapt Pan-Arab discourses to the specificities of the Iraqi milieu and to build coalitions with as many of the nation's groups as possible meant that the sectarian, anti-Shi ci, and anti-Kurdish notions that colored Bacthist discourses in later years were not as prominent in this period.\n\nAbstract This study examines the Shī‘itisation of the futuwwa tradition from the eleventh century to the early sixteenth century, with a special reference to fifteenth-century events. Available scholarship has a rather generalised view on the sectarian orientation of the futuwwa, locating it within the Sunni fold, though having a slightly Shī‘ite tinge. This view has a tendency to underestimate changes in the religious stand of the futuwwa through the ages. Likewise, it devalues the evident Shī‘ite content of the fifteenth- and sixteenth-century futuwwat-nāmas, regarding them as a temporary divergence due to Safavid propaganda. This article challenges two premises of this established view, arguing that the religious history of futuwwa was by no means static and linear but shows a rupture, i.e. Shī‘itisation, in the fifteenth century; and, in contrast to the consensus of the available scholarship, this Shī‘itisation was not a result of Safavid propaganda, but of a greater ‘universal’ transition taking place in fifteenth-century Islamdom.\n\nThe conference “The Age of the Komitadji: Entangled Histories and Political Sociology of Insurgencies in the Ottoman World (1870s-1920s)” is organized by Middle Eastern Studies of the University of Basel and the Turkish Studies Project at the University of Utah. The conference will take place on January 22-24, 2015, at the University of Basel. The conference will examine the komitadji phenomenon within the late Ottoman world and beyond (1870s-1920s). Komitadji is a common expression in various languages of the Balkans. The term is originally an Ottoman-Turkish expression, which literally means “a committee man.” Thus, komitadji designates membership to a secret society that strives to bring about radical reform, social revolution, or territorial secession, often with resort to paramilitary violence and clandestine political violence. Though this label is of Ottoman-Turkish origin, the phenomenon itself was shaped by nationalist insurgents in the Balkans. The komitadji phenomenon spread beyond the Balkans towards Anatolia, Caucasus, and the Arab Middle East. Even beyond the Ottoman realms, in the Habsburg, Romanov, and Qajar empires, there were similar or related komitadji insurgencies. In each setting, the komitadji phenomenon left behind a distinct culture of revolutionary patriotism and a legacy of militant political engineering. However, the history of the komitadjis is mostly limited to studies of nationalism and narratives of “national awakenings.” The consequence is that methodological nationalism predetermines the bias and limits of the history of insurgencies and counterinsurgencies at the expense of relational and situational contingencies, ideological complexities, and multiple categorical similarities and varieties. The growing scholarship in the social sciences on contentious politics and social movements, insurgency and counterinsurgency, and civil wars and collective violence, has only found limited but promising applications to the late Ottoman history. The conference will bring together a number of prominent and promising scholars of the Balkans, Ottoman Turkey, Russia, Caucasus, Iran, and Arab Middle East. In addition to micro case studies from these different regions, there will also be a number of comparative and entangled histories as well as theoretical studies. The papers will deal with the komitadji phenomenon as a distinct political culture and genre of contentious politics within the socio-political framework of the late Ottoman world and beyond. Prof. Dr. Jack A. Goldstone, Virginia E. and John T. Hazel, Jr. Professor in the School of Public Policy at George Mason University, a renowned specialist on revolutions, social movements, and world history, will open the conference with a keynote lecture. The conference is sponsored by Turkish Studies Project at the University of Utah, Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Basel, Swiss National Science Fond, Yunus Emre Institute Turkey, Swiss Academy of Humanities and Social Sciences, Voluntary Academic Society of Basel, MUBIT Inter-University Doctoral Cooperation in Islamic and Middle Eastern Studies Basel-Zurich, and Graduate School of Social Sciences (G3S) of University of Basel.\n\nThis article deals with the ethnographic and philological works of the nineteenth-century Kurdish scholar Mullah Mahmûdê Bayazîdî, which mark a crucial stage in the history of vernacular Kurdish-language learning. It turns out that Bayazîdî, although working in the service of the then Russian consul, Auguste Jaba, cannot be called either a “native informant” nor an “orientalist scholar”. After providing some historical background, I discuss Bayazîdî’s main writings and their significance. I then discuss his conceptions of language, literature, local tradition or culture, and history, concluding that none of these bears any traces of modern Western philology or romantic nationalism. Hence, his work cannot be qualified as “internalized orientalism”, but, as it is written in a vernacular language, neither can it be wholly assimilated to classical Islamic learning."
