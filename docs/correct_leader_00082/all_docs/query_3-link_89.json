        "text": "Another shameless moment for Blinken, even as he reveals a long list of Israeli human rights abuses; over 300 Gazan bodies discovered in mass graves; Israel prepping for invasion of Rafah; having a baby in Gaza; final report on UNRWA says Israel never offered evidence of wrongdoing; West Bank death; follow the Freedom Flotilla; flurry of actions in solidarity with Palestine on US college campuses, more\n\nBy IAK staff, from reports\n\nBlinken denies US double standard over alleged Israeli rights abuses\n\nReuters reports: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday rejected suggestions that Washington might have a “double standard” when applying U.S. law to allegations of abuses by the Israeli military in Gaza and said that examinations of such charges are ongoing.\n\n“Do we have a double standard? The answer is no,” Blinken told a news conference announcing the Department’s annual human rights country reports.\n\n“In general, as we’re looking at human rights and the condition of human rights around the world, we apply the same standard to everyone. That doesn’t change whether the country is an adversary, a competitor, a friend or an ally,” he said.\n\nIsrael’s military conduct has come under increasing scrutiny as its forces have killed 34,000 Palestinians in besieged Gaza, according to the enclave’s health authorities, many of them civilians and children. The Gaza Strip has been reduced to a wasteland, and extreme food shortages have prompted fears of famine.\n\nRECOMMENDED READING: Blinken Is Sitting on Staff Recommendations to Sanction Israeli Military Units Linked to Killings, Rapes\n\nExcerpt from US’s annual country reports on human rights practices\n\nOn Israel, the report states: “Significant human rights issues included credible reports of:\n\narbitrary or unlawful killings, including extrajudicial killings; enforced disappearance;\n\ntorture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by government officials;\n\nharsh and life-threatening prison conditions;\n\narbitrary arrest or detention;\n\npolitical prisoners or detainees;\n\narbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy;\n\npunishment of family members for alleged offenses by a relative;\n\nserious abuses in a conflict by Hamas and Israel, including unlawful or widespread civilian deaths and harm, enforced disappearances or abductions, torture, physical abuses, and conflict-related sexual violence or punishment;\n\nserious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom, including violence or threats against journalists, unjustified arrests or prosecution of journalists, and censorship;\n\nsubstantial interference with the freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association;\n\nrestrictions on freedom of movement and residence;\n\nserious government restrictions on or harassment of domestic and international human rights organizations;\n\nand crimes involving violence or threats of violence targeting members of national, racial, or ethnic minority groups.”\n\nAccording to the report, “The government [of Israel] took some credible steps to identify and punish officials who may have committed human rights abuses.”\n\n(Read the executive summary on the West Bank and Gaza here.)\n\nNOTE: Israel has proven itself unwilling and unable to self-investigate in any meaningful way, and its court system is highly discriminatory.\n\nNOTE: Despite the many human rights abuses, the Biden administration said it has not found Israel in breach of international law so far.\n\n4th day of digging up mass graves at Nasser Hospital, body count at 310\n\nWAFA reports: On Tuesday, Palestinian civil defense and ambulance crews uncovered three mass graves, with 35 bodies found at the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis city in the southern Gaza Strip, bringing the total number of civilians whose bodies have been found so far to 310 persons.\n\nMiddle East Monitor adds, “For the fourth day, government crews continue to extract the bodies of victims from mass graves in the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis,” said Government Media Office head, Salama Maarouf.\n\nSome 42 of the latest victims had been identified while the rest remain unidentified, noting that the Israeli army deliberately hid them by burying them deep in sand and dumping waste on them.\n\n“The fate of about 2,000 Palestinians who were inside the Nasser Medical Complex when the Israeli occupation army stormed it is still unknown, and it is not known whether they were arrested or killed and their bodies were hidden,” Maarouf said.\n\nHe added, “The bodies of women, children, elderly people and wounded people were also found in the mass grave, while some of them were handcuffed and stripped of their clothes, indicating that they had been executed in cold blood.”\n\nIsrael expanding so-called ‘safe zone’ in Gaza as it prepares to invade Rafah\n\nThe New Arab reports: Israel will significantly expand a so-called “humanitarian zone” in the Gaza Strip that will hold around one million displaced people, as it prepares to invade Rafah, Israel’s Reshet Bet radio station said.\n\nThe area will be much larger than the one in Al-Mawasi area in the south of the enclave and will run along the coast, reaching the outskirts of Nuseirat in central Gaza and accommodating a million Palestinians, the radio station said.\n\nAccording to the report, five field hospitals have been established in the area.\n\nOn April 18, American network ABC News quoted an Israeli source that said Israel had made “significant progress” in preparing to evacuate about a million civilians from Rafah before a ground attack on the city.\n\nWorld leaders – including some of Israel’s closest allies – and rights organizations have told Israel to call off the invasion of Rafah, where over a million Palestinians who fled other parts of Gaza are sheltering.\n\nThe UN in February warned Israel that a Rafah invasion “could lead to slaughter.”\n\nNOTE: Israel has bombed designated “safe zones” since the beginning of the war.\n\nIsrael’s attack takes a terrible toll on expectant mothers\n\nOCHA reports: Following a ten-day mission to Gaza, Dominic Allen, spokesperson for the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) stated that an estimated 180 women are giving birth every day in Gaza in “inhumane, unimaginable conditions.”\n\nOnly three of the 11 hospitals that are still partially functioning across Gaza provide maternal care.\n\nThe spokesperson described seeing cables of ultrasound machines cut and screens of complex medical equipment smashed at Nasser Hospital.\n\nHe also reported seeing – amid the many challenges in bringing health care items into Gaza – flashlights removed from midwifery kits, and an oxygen machine removed from a prefabricated maternity unit.\n\nIndependent review panel releases final report on UNRWA"
