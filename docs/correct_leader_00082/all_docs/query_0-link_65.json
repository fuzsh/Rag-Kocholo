        "text": "REVIEW OS i^NTS IN 1933,\n\nI - * I R A\n\nSECTION I - PO LITICAL AND SOCIAL,\n\nHOME POLITICS .\n\ni. Two outstanding events, the Assyrian affair\n\nin August followed ty the League of Nations 1 enquiry,\n\nand the most unexpected death of King Eaisal which took\n\nplace in September between the Assyrian affair and the\n\nenquiry, overshadowed all other happenings in 1 1RAQ\n\nduring 1933i\n\n2* The General election, held in February in\n\naccordance with His Majesty’s wishes, resulted, as had\n\nbeen expected, in an easy victory for the existing\n\ncabinet of Naji Shawkat. The Elections were carefully\n\ncontrolled and only the King* s nominees were elected\n\nto the Chamber of Deputies. King Faisal was virtually\n\ndictator in a country which was only nominally constit\n\nutional. The King had many interests; he kept alive\n\nthe pan-Arab movement, intrigues for the throne of\n\nSYRIA, and was active in fostering amongst the Arab\n\nleaders enmity to Ibn Sa f ud the present holder of the\n\nformer Hashimite throne of HEJAZ. In ’IRAQ too, the\n\nKing had a number of schemes which included the con\n\nstruction of new palaces and bridges, new irrigation\n\nworks, and the BAGHDAD-HAIFA Railway. To cope with\n\nthese many interests, the Palace contained a busy Diwan\n\nor Secretariat, capable of handling a heavy correspond\n\nence. The Palace was a hive of political activity and\n\nno contractor or seeker of concessions from EUROPE or\n\nSYRIA could afford to neglect the Royal Diwan. By\n\nadroit manoeuvres the King had almost complete control\n\n•ver the Cabinet which comprised, for the most part,\n\n^ivil officials who were quite amenable but entirely\n\nlacking in initiative.\n\nThis Cabinet was not, however, entirely to\n\nthe King’s liking since their negative attitude made it\n\nobvious to everyone that the policy of the Government\n\nwas being dictated from the Palace. Consequently, in\n\nMarch, he appointed as Premier Rashid Ali Gailani,\n\nwhose Cabinet included two most influential politicians\n\nin ’IRAQ - Nuri Pasha An Ottoman title used after the names of certain provincial governors, high-ranking officials and military commanders. as Sa’id as Minister of Foreign\n\nAffairs, and Yasin Pasha An Ottoman title used after the names of certain provincial governors, high-ranking officials and military commanders. al Hashimi, the leader of the\n\nOpposition Party, as Minister of Finance. The in\n\nclusion of the latter in the Gailani Cabinet was an\n\nastute move as Yasin’s previous position as leader of\n\nthe Ultra-Nationalist Party, in favour of drastic\n\nrevision of the Treaty and anti-British in sentiment,\n\nnow proved invaluable to the King whenever his own\n\ninterests ran counter to the British. As a convenient\n\nmedium for the introduction of modified Nationalist\n\nmeasures in which the King had a personal interest, the\n\nMinister of Finance soon became the most important\n\nperson in the Cabinet."
