Aerodromes in Syria are being used\n\nas stopl)ping places for German planes, numbers of which are reported to\n\nhave landed at other places in Iraq.\n\nMarshal Pctain, in a broadcast yesterday, stated that Darlan's nleeting with\n\nHitler hadl enabled Vichy to \"illuminate the path of the future.\" He added that\n\nif negotiations still in progress could be successfully conclulded, France would\n\nsurmount defeat and maintain her rank as a European and Colonial Power.\n\nIn Portugal it is reported that Hitler is demanding that France should\n\nabandon the Cameroons. To occupy this African territory the Germans\n\nwould have to march across Morocco, and it is stated that there are signs that\n\nGen. Franco's resistance to Hitler is stiffening.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the Franco-German agreemnent, the U.S.\n\nTreasury has ordered that arnled guards be placed upon 10 French ships in\n\nAmerican ports. These include hie Normlandie.\n\nPresident Roosevelt has declared that it is inconceivable that the French people will\n\naccept collaboration with a \"Power seeking the utter destruction of freedom and popular\n\ninstitutions everywhere.\"\n\nI AQpe~l FTO~B Rashid ~i\n\nLoNDon, Rass, Is. onlowing trne\n\nannouncement by the Foreign Sec\n\nretary (Mr. Eden) that authorities in\n\nSyria had allowed the Germans to u-e\n\nSyrian aerodromes as staging posts for\n\nflights to Iraq, it was officially an\n\nnounced in Cairo that a number of\n\nGerman planes had landed in Iraq.\n\nThis is said to have followed an\n\nurgent appeal from Rashid All. The\n\nplanes contained two Axis military\n\nmissions, as well as propagandists\n\nand agitators.\n\nThe Italian mission consists of two air\n\ngenerals with their staffs. The Ger\n\nman mission, which arrived in two\n\nplanes. comprises 15 members.\n\nThe planes arrived in Bagdad afte'\n\nhaving flown across Syria.\n\nAuthoritative circles in Cairo esti\n\nmate that at least 30 German planes\n\nhave crossed the Syrian frontier.\n\nReports, alleged to have originated\n\nin Jerusalem. have been circulated mn\n\nTurkey that 120 German bombers have\n\narrived in Mosul (Iraq), but no con\n\nrirmation of this has come from other\n\nsources\n\nAnother unconfirmed report states\n\nthat German supply ships have reached\n\nSyria with arms. It is pointed out,\n\nhowever, that Germany has only seven\n\nsupply ships in the Aegean Sea.\n\nOn Monday. the District High Com\n\nmissioner in Syria (Gen. Dentz) asked\n\nVichy what attitude he should take in\n\nthe event of German planes landing at\n\nSyrian air bases, but it is not known\n\nwhether he received a reoly. Cer\n\ntainly he has taken no action to pre\n\nvent the landings.\n\nBritish sources state that most\n\nof the planes landed at Aleppo,\n\nnear the Turkish border, and from\n\nthere went to other airfields\n\nthroughout the country. They are\n\nmostly bombers, not troop carriers,\n\nand bore French markings. Some\n\nare reported to have landed at\n\nRajak, 30 miles east of Beirut.\n\nA Bagdad broadcast declares that\n\nRussia is allowing pilots to volunteer\n\nfor flying in Iraq as a \"reprisal for\n\nBritish help to Finland.\"\n\nHigh Nazi Official in Syria\n\nAFTER Mr. Eden had told the House\n\nof Commons today that German\n\naircraft were using Syrian dromes, and\n\norders had been issued for action to\n\nbe taken against them, it was sug\n\ngested that as the Vichy Government\n\nhad left the League of Nations, the\n\nFrench mandate no longer existed.\n\nMr Eden said that there certainly\n\nwas force in the suggestion, and he\n\nwould look into it.\n\nHe told another questioner that\n\nU.S.A. was being kept informed of\n\nwhat was taking place.\n\nA neutral source in Vichy told a cor\n\nrespondent of the Associated Pre.s of\n\nAmerica that the British had attacked\n\na Syrian aerodrome, but the French\n\nForeign Office denied knowlcdge of\n\nthis\n\nA message received from Cairo\n\nstates that a high German per\n\nsonage is in Beirut, the capital of\n\nSyria, conferring with the Italian\n\nArmistice Commission and the\n\nFrench authorities.\n\nAccording to Ankara Radio there are\n\n40.000 French troops garrisoning Syria.\n\nMost of them are natives. The majo\n\nrity of the French troops are reported\n\nto be pro-British.\n\nThe latest .British communique on\n\nIraq states that .the situation both at\n\nBasra and Habbaniyah remains quiet.\n\nR.A.F. Headquarters announces\n\ncontinued attacks against Iraq\n\nposts and objectives of military\n\nvalue, such as aerodromes, rail\n\nways. and motor transport. as well\n\nas raids against M1ara Rashid.\n\nMoisul. and the railway at Bardad.\n\nIn addition attacks were made a\n\nnight or tt'o ago against enemy Axis\n\naerodromes at Maritza and Calato in\n\nRhodes.
