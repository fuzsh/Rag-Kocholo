        "text": "There’s a new Godzilla movie stomping/roaring/crashing into theaters this Friday. I’m sure it’s great. The critics seem to think so.\n\nBut if you ask me, I’d rather watch 1998’s version, directed by Roland Emmerich and starring Matthew Broderick as a bumbling scientist turned dragon slayer. A classic archetype.\n\nI am not committing heresy for the sake of heresy. This is not standard, contrarian Web blasphemy. I legitimately hold that maligned, big-budget monster movie in affectionate regard.\n\nI’m a bit of an expert on nuclear-powered dino-apes. I spent many Saturday mornings watching the King of Monsters fight giant lobsters, three-headed dragons, and robots. I wanted to be Godzilla when I grew up. Obviously, that didn’t work out.\n\nSo, when an American movie studio decided to give Godzilla the Jurassic Park treatment, I was on board. Maybe you never forget your first. This was my generation’s Godzilla.\n\nThe first teaser trailer featuring an old geezer hooking the famous colossus with the spiked spine advertised two things: jokes, destruction, and a humongous nightmare critter with big teeth.\n\nI know defending Emmerich’s Godzilla is a lonely battle. But it’s one I must fight. A younger version of me is shouting across space-time: “It’s not that bad. There’s a pretty cool, if spatially confusing, attack helicopter chase scene through Manhattan.”\n\nHere’s the truth: when Godzilla, who looked like a cross between a Tyrannosaurus Rex and Mickey Rourke, climbed the Empire State Building and unleashed a triumphant roar I applauded.\n\nNostalgia is memory with a facelift.\n\nI am not ashamed to admit I saw 1998’s Godzilla in 1998. Alone. I wore ocean-blue relaxed-fit jeans with a wallet chain, and lumberjack flannel. I looked like a chubby roadie for Stone Temple Pilots. In a year, I would discover hair gel and grow a goatee. The economy was booming, but I was broke. That didn’t stop me from purchasing a ticket to a movie that promised a giant lizard destroying Manhattan, a magical island I could see from my apartment in Queens.\n\nThis movie did exactly what a summer blockbuster is supposed to do—make me laugh, boo, ooh, and ahh.\n\nIt’s all the pleasure of a lobotomy without the ice pick up the nose or the permanent loss of mental faculties.\n\nAfterwards, I even bought Godzilla: The Album, which I listened to on my portable CD player. It was a rad soundtrack featuring sensitive bro-rockers like the Wallflowers, as well as a cynical team-up between Puff Daddy and Led Zeppelin’s guitar legend Jimmy Page. The song those two collaborated on required sampling the classic guitar riff from “Kashmir.” It was all that and a bag of chips.\n\nI also sucked Mountain Dew from a giant Godzilla-themed Taco Bell cup, which was promoted in commercials by a chihuahua with a cartoonish “Mexican” accent.\n\nIf you love the 90s, you pretty much have to love 90s Godzilla.\n\nWhy wouldn’t you? That Godzilla movie personifies that deeply silly decade—loud, tacky, blissfully unaware that the next 10 years would bring war, fear, and never-ending seasons of The Bachelor.\n\nAnd the Internet loves the 90s. The proof is in the page views. Especially those who can’t possibly remember the 90s, because they were unable to form or articulate a critical thought.\n\nBack in 1998, America was the apex predator of nations. It was our Golden Age. You could keep your shoes on while zooming through airport metal detectors. Our biggest national security threat was a White House intern. If you had access to a T1 line, you could watch flickering stamp-size videos on your P.C., which was running Windows 98.\n\nEvery Thursday night, I watched a fashionable gaggle of pals gather at Central Perk and live a charmed life in New York City. If I could have sued NBC and Friends for false-representation of reality, I would have.\n\nI liked imagining David Schwimmer’s character, Ross, the stuttering paleontologist, staring up at 90s Godzilla rampaging through 90s New York and whispering, “My God, it’s beautiful,” before being crushed.\n\nIn 1998, the movie Saving Private Ryan taught the baby-boomers how much of a badass Dad was, and Armageddon taught America that oilmen and nuclear missiles can save the earth from total destruction. Shakespeare in Love kneeled on our chests and forced us to love Gwyneth Paltrow.\n\nWhat a magical time.\n\n1998’s Godzilla has everything that made the 90s a decade worth memorializing. Fun hair. Goofy Frenchmen. Corny sight gags. A casually sexist subplot about a conniving girlfriend who chose career over love.\n\nThere were mom jeans and giant cell phones, and the U.S. military was a well-armed gang of knuckleheads who kept accidentally destroying New York City landmarks. Back then, you could destroy Big Apple skyscrapers without triggering P.T.S.D.\n\nThe original 1954 Godzilla was a metaphor for all sorts of atomic age anxieties. Metaphors are a popular thing to have in scary movie.\n\nSometimes, as Freud said, a Godzilla is just a Godzilla. I think he said the same thing about zombies.\n\nBut 90s Godzilla was just a metaphor for 90s Godzilla. It was not a movie that took itself seriously. Modern fans all want “serious” film adaptations of their favorite childhood heroes. Really, what’s a “serious” Batman movie? Batman fights prostate cancer.\n\nI miss the dimwitted playfulness of a decade that gave us Batman with nipples and Will Smith punching aliens in the face. Nineties Godzilla gave us exactly what Godzilla truly, simply, is—a giant monster crushing cars. That is never not entertaining."
