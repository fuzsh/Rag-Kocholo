        "text": "Scene from \"Godzilla\"\n\nBig lizard show\n\n'Godzilla' is coming\n\nBy Sean Mitchell\n\nEditor's note: Mitchell took the opportunity to visit with \"Godzilla\"'s human cast, including star Matthew Broderick, during a visit to the production set of \"Godzilla\" last August.\n\nLOS ANGELES -- Stage 27 at Sony Pictures is a building big enough to keep most of a 747 dry, although not on this August night, because rain is falling inside, drenching a yawning, dimly lit canyon of jagged granite ripped open by a giant lizard. The full-scale set is a picture of subterranean destruction left by a reptile 200 feet high that has tried to crawl through the subway tunnels of New York.\n\nThe canyon, seven stories deep, is made of painted Styrofoam, but the red-paneled subway cars dangling from the severed rails above are real. At the very top of the set, at one end, is the familiar sight of a white-tiled Manhattan subway station wall and the words, \"23rd St.\" The platform is deserted. No one's around because you-know-who has just been here.\n\nVisible only on a black-and-white television monitor behind the set, two dark figures in Army fatigues and combat boots creep cautiously through the tunnel, flashing searchlights and exchanging words that are difficult to hear.\n\nFinally, one of them emerges from the ghostly make-believe into the dank, semi-dark surroundings where a crew of film technicians crowd around the monitor and director Roland Emmerich, who is wearing knee-high rain boots. It's Matthew Broderick. What, some might ask, is he doing in a remake of \"Godzilla\"?\n\n\"Basically, I just said, 'He went thataway,'\" Broderick says. \"There are a lot of scenes like that.\"\n\nSony Pictures is concealing the monster until the film's release\n\nBroderick liked Godzilla script\n\nHere on a soundstage where Esther Williams once made her swimming-pool musicals in the 1940s, a sci-fi-addicted German director is making a $100-million-plus movie based on a character leased from Japan. How times have changed for the Axis powers.\n\nBroderick makes no apology for being in this TriStar monster spectacle, which is being made by the people who brought you the boffo alien invasion \"Independence Day\" -- Emmerich and screenwriter-producer Dean Devlin.\n\n\"I can't say that their having just done 'Independence Day' and it being such a huge hit had no influence,\" says Broderick, who plays a scientist knowledgeable about lizards. \"If I had read it and thought it was a boring or trashy version of 'Godzilla,' I wouldn't be here. But it seems to me they want to make a good movie.\n\n\"I'm surprised at how embedded Godzilla is on everybody's psyche. The odd person asks me if the monkey dies in the end, but it seems to me people really know about Godzilla. The guy who cuts my hair in New York -- he's Japanese -- was incredibly excited. He said, 'I like Godzilla because he's a good man, and he's a bad man.'\n\n\"I kind of know what he means. King Kong, you feel bad for, he's sort of a saintly figure. But Godzilla is both: You feel bad when he gets hurt, but he's a vicious monster, too.\"\n\nNew York new target of Godzilla's wrath\n\nIn the original Japanese film, adapted for American audiences in 1956 as \"Godzilla, King of the Monsters,\" Godzilla was a giant mutation -- caused by radioactive fallout -- who rose from the ocean depths and stomped Tokyo until being subdued. Memories of Hiroshima and all that.\n\nIn this '90s remake, he (or is it a she?) visits various parts of the globe before terrorizing New York. The main battle is set in Manhattan and includes (attention, Knicks fans) the lizard-induced collapse of Madison Square Garden. Other battles are waged in New England, Polynesia, Panama and Jamaica.\n\nIn 1956, Godzilla was played by a man in a rubber lizard suit. Today the creature will have the benefit of the sort of computer and special-effects technology that brought dinosaurs so vividly to life in \"Jurassic Park\" and \"The Lost World.\"\n\nBut as a result, the title character has remained mostly a phantom presence during the three months of shooting in New York and Los Angeles -- even to the actors. They must look at a set like this one, the magnificently imploded 23rd Street station, and let their imaginations take over.\n\n\"It's weird,\" Broderick says. \"We see a big foot every now and then. They'll bring a foot around on the back of a truck. I think there's a head that will get used at some point. I've not seen him at all except sketches. They put an 'X' on a board and say, 'This is where he is.'\n\n\"You have to play along, relax and give in to it. Yeah, I can't have actual chemistry with Godzilla, but I can think about the story and what my relationship to Godzilla is.\"\n\nHank Azaria, who plays an intrepid TV cameraman partnered with an intrepid TV reporter played by Maria Pitillo, squishes his way through a patch of wet sawdust soaking up all the fake rain and reflects on the challenge of \"reading to the X,\" as he puts it. \"I have to ask myself, 'Am I afraid here?' 'How much am I winking at the camera?' It's driving me crazy actually. It's a tone thing. I think it's supposed to be somewhere between 'Ghostbusters' and 'Poltergeist.'\"\n\nDevlin: Goal was avoiding spoof\n\nDean Devlin, the American half of the primary creative team (he's the producer, as well as co-writer, with Emmerich), says the movie is no joking matter.\n\n\"Could we do it without doing a spoof?\" Devlin ponders. \"Could we do it without being cheesy?\"\n\nThese were the questions he says he and Emmerich asked themselves three years ago, when the studio first approached them with the Godzilla Redux idea.\n\n\"There will be some humor definitely, but we're not making fun of the original.\"\n\nIt should be noted that satirist Harry Shearer, the voice of a dozen characters on \"The Simpsons,\" has a role in the film as a pompous television anchorman. Says Shearer: \"Dean and Roland both encouraged me to add what they thought was my sense of humor to the thing, but they're definitely not making a campy movie where everybody's kidding around.\"\n\nComparing the tone to their last movie, Devlin says, \"It's like the difference between (the farcical) 'Mars Attacks' and 'Independence Day,' even though both were based loosely on the 1950s sci-fi classic 'War of the Worlds.'\"\n\nIndeed, the filmmakers needed the approval of Toho Co. Ltd., Godzilla's owner, to go forward. Over the years, Toho has made more than 20 Godzilla films, all with the man in the lizard suit and known mostly to cultists in this country. Devlin and Emmerich knew they would have to improve on that and flew to Japan with TriStar executives to unveil their model of a redesigned Godzilla for the '90s. When the Japanese saw the model, reportedly there followed a long pause, after which their spokesman said, in effect, \"Let the international ticket sales begin.\" The Hollywood team flew home to get started.\n\nPlot closely guarded\n\nMeanwhile, despite being a remake, the film plot details remain closely guarded. \"They're all up and down on us not to talk about the plot,\" Azaria says.\n\n\"There are a few shock moments that it would be a shame if everybody knew,\" Broderick says.\n\nGodzilla's gender? \"It's a big secret, really it is.\"\n\n-- Writer/director Roland Emmerich.\n\n\"So much of it is obvious,\" Devlin says. \"Lizard comes, lizard kicks, we fight back.\" But he adds, \"Physically, it's totally different. When you look at our Godzilla, you won't feel any nostalgia.\"\n\nThen he lets go of a small revelation. \"We discovered that certain kinds of lizards can burrow, so we decided to give him that capability.\"\n\nThe classic Godzilla moved above ground with all the grace of, well, a man in an ill-fitting rubber suit; the new model apparently is more agile and can travel at speeds up to 400 mph.\n\n\"The hardest part of this picture is that we have a living, breathing animal, so if the creature doesn't work, the movie doesn't work,\" says Volker Engel, the special-effects supervisor who won an Oscar for his work on \"Independence Day.\"\n\n\"On 'Independence Day,'\" Engel says, \"a lot of the computerized shots were separate from the live action, but on this one about two-thirds of the movie is live action,\" in which he has to integrate the special-effects presence of Godzilla. Tougher, he says.\n\n'Popcorn children'\n\n\"What Roland and I have in common,\" Devlin says, \"is that we both love genre movies.\"\n\nA former actor, Devlin grew up locally and thinks of himself as \"a popcorn child of Hollywood\" now allied with someone \"with a strong European sensibility.\" The two met nine years ago when Emmerich was visiting from Stuttgart, looking for American actors for a science-fiction film, \"Moon 44.\"\n\nTheir first major collaboration was in service to action star Jean-Claude Van Damme, writing and directing his exploding 1992 rival-cyborg feature \"Universal Soldier.\"\n\nBut Emmerich, by his own account was very much a popcorn kid, too, while growing up in Germany. He points out that the original \"Godzilla\" was a remake of a 1953 American movie, \"The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms,\" itself suggested by a Ray Bradbury short story. To fully background himself in the character, he watched 14 or 15 of the Toho Godzilla movies on laserdisc. \"Then I gave up. It's just the same movie over and over again. They always had another monster in it, and I never get anything out of two monsters fighting.\"\n\nHe says: \"For reasons I can't explain myself, kids all over the world kept watching these movies, in cassettes and at matinees. A lot of older people mix it up with 'King Kong,' but what you're trying to do with any monster movie is that when you understand the monster, you sympathize with him. Frankenstein is like that, King Kong, Dracula. Dracula is like a tragic figure. And same thing with Godzilla.\"\n\nAnd by the way, what gender is Godzilla these days? Emmerich is briefly taken aback by the question. Then he smiles and says, \"It's a big secret. Really it is. It's part of the story.\"\n\nMonster movies follow rules\n\nIs it such a stretch to imagine Godzilla '98 as another version of \"Independence Day,\" only with a monster instead of space aliens attacking Earth? Nein, says the director. \"Monster movies have certain rules. You try to follow them and reinvent them as you go. 'Independence Day' was more like a disaster movie.\n\n\"It ticked us off, you know, when people said it's only about the explosions. We truly believe if the people don't like the characters, they won't watch any explosions at all. They don't even come. They can smell it. It all comes down to good or bad storytelling -- independent, studio film, whatever.\"\n\nDevlin gazes up at the seven-story scaffolding bracketing the subway canyon set that took three months to construct and will possibly be on screen for 90 seconds, and proudly says, \"We're making high-budget movies with a low-budget attitude.\"\n\nRecalling his scenes in \"Godzilla,\" Shearer says the whole experience was nothing but fun, which itself sounds funny coming from him. \"I'm amazed by Roland,\" Shearer says. \"There was incipient chaos on the set at every single moment, and he's walking through it all having a good time. I've never seen a director have such a good time. He combines two words I never thought I would use in the same sentence: `German' and 'pixie.'\"\n\n\"We killed like 5 billion people in 'Independence Day,'\" Emmerich says. \"I said to Dean while we were shooting the movie, 'How do we get away with this?' And he said, 'Ah, they will get it that it doesn't take itself too seriously.' And he was right. People knew every minute of the movie that they're watching a movie.\n\n\"But I can't think too much about the audience. I'm trying to create something that I like. Even in New York, I tried to create angles you haven't seen before. I'm not a big fan of seeing again and again the same car chase. On the other hand, I like car chases, so I hope I do one that is so different you get something out of it.\""
