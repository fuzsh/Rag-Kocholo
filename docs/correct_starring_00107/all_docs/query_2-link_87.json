        "text": "I was going to title this post \"Godzilla 1998: A Good Remake\" but God hates click-bait titles.\n\nGodzilla [1998] by Tristar Pictures is a bad \"Godzilla movie\". It has a monster that is virtually unrecognizable as an incarnation of Godzilla and shares no traits with the enigmatic king of kaiju beyond the fact she’s an amphibious reptile with spikes on her back. Zilla by Toho, or GINO as fans have called her since 1998, was the product of two men who had almost no respect for the original source material. In fact Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin had pretty negative views of the original Godzilla film, frequently insulting the old plot lines and special effects; such as erroneously claiming Toho FX director Eiji Tsuburaya was completely ignorant of Stop-Motion animation mechanics and stupidly having to use a rubber lizard suit (Mr. Tsuburaya was actually well aware of and knew how to do Stop-Motion, it was just the fact a short production cycle because Gojira [1954] had, there was no time to do it).\n\nIt makes it all the more saddening considering the original 1994-1995 script Tristar [Readable Here] was going to use at first not only included a far more On-The-Ball incarnation of Godzilla, but a unique enemy and new ideas to the franchise we’d see later in kaiju films. Elements of the 1994 Jan De Bont Godzilla script later found themselves worked into later movies, though they were completely thrown out in the script revisioning by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich to the point there is virtually no similarities between the 1994 and 1998 scripts respectively.\n\nPoint is, Godzilla [1998] was a bad Godzilla film; but I don’t hate it. It was actually my first kaiju movie I ever saw and I got plenty of fond memories for it. I still got the “Kid Friendly” version my father made for four year old me on VHS, which has a lot of the talking cut out and ends with Zilla getting torpedoed and swimming off into the ocean. It’s a bad Godzilla film, but after almost twenty years to look at it in light of seeing both every other Godzilla film and a huge number of other monster movies both homegrown and foreign; I do still like it as a monster movie and popcorn entertainment.\n\nIt’s since become common thought to compare this film to “The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms”, a 1953 monster movie from the USA. A prehistoric monster (animated by the now legendary Stop-Motion wizard Ray Harryhausen) called a Rhedosaurus gets freed from the ice in the arctic from a nuclear explosion, traveling south and coming ashore to wreck havoc in New York City. The film was a hit when it was released and more than one of Godzilla’s creators’ have cited it as a chief inspiration both for their movie and their titular character’s reptilian look. In fact when Tomoyuki Tanaka first got the idea to make a monster movie, the working title on the outline he jotted down was “The Giant Monster From 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea”.\n\nJust as Godzilla could be considered the archetypical Japanese giant monster movie, 20k Fathoms could be considered the codifier for the American giant monster film. There were earlier examples for sure, like 1933’s King Kong, but 20k Fathoms laid a lot of the ground work for almost every 50s monster film to follow. And when people said the 1998 film was more like 1953 film instead of Godzilla, it actually does line up well.\n\n-The creature is big, but not gargantuan levels so it dwarfs most buildings.\n\n-Rather than a force of nature or angry god, the monster acts more like an aggressive animal.\n\n-The film’s technology, barring some relatively minor elements; is not fantastical.\n\n-The monster can be killed, or at the very least seriously hurt, with conventional weapons, not some fantastical super weapon, it just takes awhile to land any good hits.\n\nTarantula, The Colossal Man, Beginning of the End, THEM!, It Came from Beneath the Sea; and The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms all follow this scheme with very little deviation. This is in stark contrast to how many Japanese kaiju films play out. It’s not a good or a bad thing, but it can make differences jarring. Godzilla [1998] is basically a Japanese monster put into an American styled monster movie. For an inversion, Pacific Rim (2012) is an American monster movie that plays out like a Japanese monster movie.\n\nSo why what’s the big deal you may ask? Seems like an open and shut case as to why the 1998 film ended up the way it did due to cultural and film making differences, resulting in a film (G1998) with some accidental similarities to an unrelated film (20 Fathoms) rather than its foreign source material (G1954). Actually, there seems to be much more to it than that.\n\nRecall the 1994 script. It did have many American monster movie elements such as the military actually being effective even if Godzilla was ultimately needed to defeat the villain monster, and the monsters themselves were scaled down to a degree compared to the original Toho dimensions (around 40-50 meters). However, there is a big difference. Godzilla 1994 still felt like a Japanese monster film at its core. The Japanese born elements still played at the center-\n\n-Only one of the kaiju could stand a good chance at destroying the other\n\n-A fantastical weapon or device is created to affect a kaiju\n\n-The military can somewhat harm the monsters but not in a meaningful way\n\n-etc.\n\nWhich would have resulted in a far more faithful adaption of the source despite the unique parts of the script. And with the 2014 Godzilla film showing this faithfulness is possible even with a new spin, nationality wasn’t the core factor of the change.\n\nI actually think the reason Godzilla [1998] ended up more like a Beast from 20,000 Fathoms remake because it literally was supposed to be a Beast from 20,000 Fathoms remake. Just look at the plot-\n\n-We start with a nuclear explosion in a remote region\n\n-First person to see the monster is considered crazy\n\n-The first traces we see of it are damage to a seaside location\n\n-It sinks a few ships before making landfall\n\n-First attack is at the exact same Manhattan dock\n\n-Monster rams itself through a building during the first rampage and leaves a hole in it\n\n-There’s a confrontation with the military down a dark main street at night\n\n-A blood test is done on the creature’s samples after the battle and discovers a plot point\n\n-Monster finally killed once it becomes tangled up in a New York landmark and fired upon\n\nAnd just lengthen Rhedosaurus’ hind legs to make it a biped, reverse the angle of and scale up the back spines; and you get something very close to the 1998 creation. This is especially noticeable when you consider the 1994 script's design, while slimmed down and more dinosaur-like than the Toho Godzilla, still was very recognizable as Godzilla with all the classic traits intact. Another huge difference both Zilla and Rhedosaurus have versus Godzilla is the nuclear ties. Depending on origin Godzilla is either a natural creature like Rhedosaurus or a mutation like Zilla, but regardless his ties to the atomic bomb and it's power is very much at a forefront with some incarnations irradiating an area just by walking through it. With Zilla and the Rhedosaurus however, the nuclear devices are treated more as a means to an end to get the monsters loose. Rhedosaurus wasn't radioactive and was merely freed via a bomb and Zilla, while a mutation, didn't have any radioactive ties beyond her origin. Godzilla is the incarnation of an atomic bomb whereas both Zilla and Rhedosaurus thematically are closer to just a confused, large animal mostly causing destruction by merit of size alone.\n\nTake out the word “Godzilla”, give the film a new title, and change the seaside attack from a village to a lighthouse and it would function very closely as a Beast from 20,000 Fathoms remake.\n\nWhy do I think this may have been intentional? Because the makers of the 1998 film never shut up about The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms. In fact in many of their quotes it is virtually the only movie brought up by them multiple times.\n\n“Godzilla was one of the last concepts of the ’50s that had never been done in modern form — that idea of the giant monster as in THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS. Why not do them again? Big Lizard eats Big Apple. I like it.”\n\n“-we don’t have the same kind of limitations the Japanese had when they made their GODZILLA. There is an American movie called THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS, shot in the early 1950s.-”\n\n• Roland Emmerich, director\n\nAnd previously Emmerich and Devlin had done movies that they admitted to being spiritual successors to old 1950s movies. “Independence Day” was basically them remaking “Earth Vs. The Flying Saucers” by their own admission. And in the 1998 Tristar movie, you can see multiple Ray Harryhausen Sci-Fi movies playing on TVs in the background; most notably “It Came from Beneath the Sea!” when two looters are robbing an empty store. They were clearly aware of The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms and were fans of it and the genre.\n\n1990s Hollywood was very keen on remakes, many of which never got made. There was a planned King Kong remake, a planned Creature of the Black Lagoon remake, the infamous Mummy remake; and many more. With so many remakes and spiritual successor films floating around, would it be out of the realm of possibility that there actually was an idea by someone to redo 20,000 Fathoms? Maybe not.\n\nIt might have been as simple as Devlin and Emmerich already thinking of doing a remake 20,000 Fathoms by the time they were brought in by Tristar to redo the 1994 script. So they saw their chance, tossed out Godzilla’s elements almost entirely and pasted 20,000 Fathoms elements into the slot. It would explain why the 1998 Script and 1994 Script had almost nothing in common despite one apparently being a rewrite of the other.\n\nSo, yah. As more and more stuff comes out about how the 1994 films morphed into the final product, the joke of GINO being more like Rhedo could be hilarity in hindsight seeing as Godzilla 1998 might literally be a Beast from 20,000 Fathoms remake by intention. And I think when you look at it like that, the 1998 film gets a bit better looking back upon it. Being maybe less a remake deviating from the source material as much as it is a remake of something else entirely that got the wrong name and title.\n\nAs for the 1994 script, I’ll cover that next time. But as sad as it is we didn’t get that movie, I don’t think we need mourn it too much. In some ways, we’ve actually seen that movie twice now. More on that later...\n\nOh, some neat trivia on The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms. The movie was an expansion on a short story by writing legend, Ray Bradbury, originally called \"The Fog Horn\". The story was about how the foghorn on a remote light house draws in a dinosaur-like sea monster. The story was picked up by Bradbury's friends at Warner Brothers, Jack Dietz and Ray Harryhausen; who expanded it into the film's plot, while making note to include the story's lighthouse scene.\n\nThe Fog Horn would be subject homage and parody many times over in fiction, but one notable example was in the first season of the Pokemon anime titled \"Mystery at the Lighthouse\". In the episode a pokemon researcher named Bill lures in a giant pokemon of a seemingly unknown species (viewers might later recognize it as a giant Dragonite) to his lighthouse by playing it's call out a fog horn.\n\nNow take into account that Godzilla was inspired by the Rhedosaurus, who's movie popularized \"The Fog Horn\" and suddenly Godzilla and this-\n\nare effectively cousins in fiction..."
