With the help of a low-profile scientist named Dr. Niko Tatopoulos and an unlikely television crew, they are given the responsibility of saving as many lives as they can from this massive radioactive beast.\n\nTrivia\n\nAlong with working together in this film, actors Hank Azaria, Harry Shearer and Nancy Cartwright also worked as voice actors on the show The Simpsons. The lead role of this film was written for Matthew Broderick prior to him even finishing the screenplay. The movie grossed over $379,014,294 in box office sales."
