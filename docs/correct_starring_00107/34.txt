Maria Pitillo was born in Elmira, NY, and grew up in Mahwah, NJ. She is of Italian and Irish descent.

Known primarily for her role as Audrey Timmonds in the monster flick Godzilla (1998), Maria got into show business after being invited by a girlfriend to audition for a part in a TV commercial. After a few tryouts, Maria was soon being featured in television commercials for everything from Pepto-Bismol and Chic Jeans, to working bit parts in film and on TV.

Maria was officially introduced to the world as Angel, daughter of a Brooklyn mobster, in the production of Spike of Bensonhurst (1988). After a recurring role on the ABC Soap Opera, Ryan's Hope (1975), Maria then packed her bags and set her sights on Sunny California. With small roles in a number of films and on TV, she got her first shot at a steady gig, and was cast as Gina in the ill-fated South of Sunset (1993), in which only one episode aired.

Two years later, having experienced Hollywood's cycle of boom-and-bust, the undeterred Maria successfully tackled the lead role in the TV movie, Crimes of Passion: Escape from Terror - The Teresa Stamper Story (1995) as well as the role of a mobsters daughter in another TV movie, Between Love and Honor (1995). Topping off a successful year, Maria landed the part of Alicia, on the Fox Network comedy, Partners (1995) co-starring Tate Donovan and Jon Cryer.

Maria made her name with a number of guest starring appearances on TV, and with leading roles in the films Dear God (1996), and Lew Grade's tear-jerker, Something to Believe In (1998). After Godzilla, Maria's career culminated in a recurring role on TV's Providence (1999) (2001-2002).
