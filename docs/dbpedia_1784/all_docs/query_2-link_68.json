        "text": "If you ask Bates graduates what they value most about their time here, as often as not they’ll say something like, “Bates taught me how to think.” Supported by a dedicated faculty, Bates students learn to explore broadly and deeply, to cross disciplines, and to question rigorously.\n\nAt Bates, students and faculty form a community of scholars who share a thirst for learning, drawing on the methods of the sciences, the patterns of logic and language, the study of societies, and expression in the arts.\n\nA Bates education fosters intellectual inquiry and reflection, personal growth, and a commitment to the world beyond oneself. Bates offers students a rigorous academic experience in a collaborative and supportive environment.\n\nMajors & Minors\n\nMajors and minors both promote deep, immersive study in a particular discipline or field. A major is required and comprises between 10 and 14 courses. A minor is optional and requires far fewer courses.\n\nAll Bates majors culminate in a senior thesis or capstone seminar, a pivotal experience that challenges students to synthesize their prior academic work in original research or creative production.\n\nM major | m minor\n\n*Engineering students participate in the 3-2 Dual Degree program, completing three years at Bates and two years at one of our partner institutions, including Case Western, Columbia, Dartmouth, RPI, or Washington University.\n\nFacts\n\nAcademics\n\nMajors are offered by academic departments and interdisciplinary programs. Several offer a minor as well. Major study is designed to throw you headlong into the methods, practices, certainties, and mysteries of a field; they’re also designed to lead to great things, including but not limited to graduate or professional school, enlightened leadership, and making your own way in the world.\n\nThe Bates curriculum offers many options. You may design your own major. You may enroll in the Dual Degree Engineering Program: three years at Bates, plus two years at a top engineering school (Case Western, Columbia, Dartmouth, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Washington University in St. Louis). You may also minor in the following:\n\nAsian Studies\n\nDigital and Computational Studies\n\nGerman and Russian Studies\n\nGreek\n\nLatin\n\nRussian\n\nTeacher Education\n\nTo further ensure breadth in a course of study, most students take two General Education Concentrations (GECs — rhymes with “treks”), a group of four courses that add up to a sustained exploration of one theme.\n\nSome recent GECs:\n\nArchaeology and Material Culture\n\nBridging El Atlantico\n\nChinese Society and Culture\n\nConsidering Africa\n\nDiasporas\n\nFilm and Media Studies\n\nPublic Health\n\nA GEC like Public Health includes such courses as:\n\nBiomedical Ethics\n\nEnvironmental Justice\n\nEpidemics Past, Present, and Future\n\nHealth and Healing in Africa\n\nHealth Economics\n\nPathophysiology\n\nShort Term\n\nOur academic calendar is divided into two traditional semesters and one Short Term in late April and May. In Short Term, students take only one course, on a compressed schedule; they can also undertake internships or conduct fieldwork; a number of Short Term courses are conducted off campus. The result is a focused investigation of a single topic. A few recent Short Term courses:\n\nBuilding a Studio Practice\n\nIntro to Archaeological Fieldwork\n\nLife Course and Aging\n\nShakespeare in London\n\nUnderstanding Cancer\n\nThe First-year Seminar\n\nOne of the first courses you’ll take, and a model for the work you’ll do in the next four years: You, a professor and a handful of your peers get together and dig into a specialized topic. Recent examples:\n\nCoastal Hazards\n\nHistory of the Brain\n\nInternational Cinema\n\nJudicial Power in the U.S.\n\nReligion and Civil Rights\n\nRevolutionary Writing in Latin America\n\nThe Faculty\n\nOur student to faculty ratio is 10-to-1; there are 20 students in the average class; and every student works individually with a faculty mentor on their senior thesis — so not only will your professors know your name, they’ll also know where you’re coming from, where you want to go and how you might get there. Meals or coffee might be involved. Richly detailed letters of recommendation will almost certainly be involved. These are bright, accomplished, high-profile people whose priority is you.\n\nOff-campus Study\n\nAbout 60 percent of our students study abroad. We offer access to programs in more than 80 countries. Our faculty also develop and lead rigorous, cross-disciplinary Fall Semester Abroad trips.\n\nThe Senior Thesis\n\nOur academic program starts with an intensive, often interdisciplinary first-year seminar and ends with an intensive, often interdisciplinary senior thesis. The thesis is meant to make a meaningful contribution to the storehouse of human knowledge; it is also often the first step toward a job or graduate study. A few recent theses:\n\nDisputing Development: The Politics of Progress on Kilimanjaro\n\nEmbodying Music: What Feeling Can Tell Us About Musical Expression\n\nGalactic Dark Matter and the Cosmic Microwave Background\n\nQuack to Hero: The Character of the Doctor in the 19th Century\n\nResearch and Opportunity\n\nWe do not live in a bubble. Research, fieldwork, internships, civic engagement — we do them all, they’re academically demanding, and they bring us in to the world. A few examples: Our Purposeful Work Internship Program matches Bates students with selected employers and provides a stipend — i.e., money — to support them. More than 100 students receive research or creative fellowships each summer, to work with Bates faculty of elsewhere. At the Mount David Summit, our annual campus-wide student research festival, 250-300 students present poster sessions, research talks, panel discussions, and arts performances.\n\nThe Harward Center for Community Partnerships develops or supports an astounding number of initiatives that combine rigorous intellectual work and hands-on civic engagement (an internship program at major museums for Art and Visual Culture students; a politics seminar on immigration that includes firsthand research at the California/Mexico border; a community-based senior thesis about converting wood waste into fuel). It also oversees the college’s Bonner Leader Program (scholarships for students who serve and lead), and gives grants to faculty, staff and students who think of innovative ways to work with communities across the street and around the world."
