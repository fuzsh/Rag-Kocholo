Scholarships range in award and are determined by application.\n\nDoes Creighton offer need based aid to international students?\n\nNo, Creighton does not offer need based financial aid to international students. While we offer as much as we can in merit aid, full tuition and cost of attendance scholarships are not available. Students should not apply unless they can realistically pay the costs associated with attending Creighton. More information can be found here\n\nCan I fill out the FAFSA?\n\nIt depends on your status. If you are a US Citizen, a permanent resident/green-card holder, have been granted asylum or refugee status, or fit into one of these categories\n\nWhat activities and services are available to international students at Creighton?\n\nThere are numerous services ISSS is able to offer international students, including International student orientation, international student focused community activities, social activities, and Visa/I-20 advising.\n\nCan international students become employed while at Creighton?\n\nThere are limited work opportunities on campus for students, including international students. Students may work on campus if work is available and only typically after the first semester of classes. Students must apply, interview, and work the hours hired for, if they work on campus. Work is not guaranteed to any student and students should not come to Creighton expecting to be hired for a part-time job. Off campus work is typically not authorized for international students, due to US immigration policies."
