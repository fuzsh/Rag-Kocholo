The language advisor would be able to interview you briefly and recommend a best placement based on your written, spoken, listening, literary, and cultural competence.\n\nCourse Placement for Latin\n\nIf this is a new language for you (i.e., no prior experience in this language), students should enroll in Latin 101 and do not need to take a placement exam or advisement evaluation.\n\nIf you have had previous experience or education in this language, you will need to take the Latin Placement Test first to see which level you should enroll in. Go to Miami's Foreign Language Placement and select Latin for your language. Then select the number of years you have previously had learning Latin. If you have had 1/2 years, round up to the next whole year of previous experience. When you are finished with the test, your exam will be emailed to a designated language advisor in Classics to read and score it. The language advisor will then email you back at the address you gave on the exam and inform you of your score and which course you should register for.\n\nIf you believe that the language placement is incorrect or have doubts about the placement, please talk to the department's language advisor, who would be able to interview you briefly and recommend a best placement based on your written, spoken, listening, literary, and cultural competence."
