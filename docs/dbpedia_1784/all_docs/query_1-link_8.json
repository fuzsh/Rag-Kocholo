        "text": "Overview\n\nThis innovative new program is a celebration of both opera and chamber music. With the common goal to capture the emotional essence of chamber work, whether that be in the form of instrumental pieces or new operas, this residency will foster the potential of unique voices and creative visions that culminate in live performances that create excitement and growth. Created by some of the most thrilling leaders of opera and chamber music, this is a unique opportunity to work side-by-side with living composers on the creation of new work, leading to world premieres. Participants are given the chance to discover, to take risks, and learn from each other and leading practitioners.\n\nThe four-week program offers early career and established musicians, singers and creatives the opportunity to explore two new operas (new arrangements by Daniel Schlosberg of Poul Ruders / Paul Bentley’s The Handmaid’s Tale, based on Margaret Atwood, and Ian Cusson / Royce Vavrek’s Indians on Vacation, based on Thomas King) created by the program’s faculty composers and new music by participant composers.\n\nMusicians, singers and creatives will also have the opportunity to explore the rich history and contemporary evolution of chamber music, ranging from classical compositions by Haydn to new music by participant composers.\n\nWorking with soon-to-be-announced internationally celebrated faculty in a unique educational environment, artists will have the opportunity to hone their craft, engage in diverse approaches to chamber music and opera interpretation, explore the composer – performer process, and elevate critical writing skills.\n\nYou will have 24-hour access to studios. Larger studios will be available for group work and small individual spaces for private practice.\n\nWhen possible, participant instrumentalists and singers will be partnered with a participant composer and be involved in the development, preparation, and premiere of a new chamber work. This residency includes public performance opportunities; repertoire from the traditional canon will be studied and performed alongside contemporary works.\n\nJoin the future of opera and chamber music, looking at traditional and new works in bold new ways to shape your own artistic vision and advance your career.\n\nWhat does the program offer?\n\nThis innovative new program offers all participants:\n\nMentorship by internationally renowned faculty (soon to be announced).\n\nMasterclasses.\n\nPublic chamber music concerts.\n\nMusical read-through and public showcase of The Handmaid’s Tale and Indians on Vacation.\n\nSessions on producing opera, website/resumés/social media.\n\nNew music showcase of own work performed by program participants.\n\nOnline meetings with faculty in May 2024 before on-site program to go over work and program goals.\n\nOpera Singers & Répétiteurs\n\nThis program combines elements of both opera and chamber music. It features reduced orchestration and intimate venues, allowing for a more intimate and immersive theatrical experience. Chamber operas often explore contemporary or unconventional subject matters and emphasize the emotional depth of the characters and the intricacies of the musical score. Both chamber music and opera display the artistry and virtuosity of the performers, providing an intimate and nuanced musical experience that captivates audiences with its intricate textures and expressive power.\n\nYou will be cast in either/or both of The Handmaid’s Tale and Indians on Vacation. These works will be presented in a concert/workshop setting. Répétiteurs will be assigned to the operas and work with singers in coachings, lessons and masterclass situations.\n\nInstrumentalists\n\nInstrumentalists of string, woodwind, brass, percussion and piano will have transformative experiences in both chamber music and opera. For two weeks, delve into chamber music that emphasizes collaboration and intricate interplay among instruments and voice, fostering a rich, nuanced musical conversation that culminates in public concerts. Chamber groups may be paired with a composer to explore the dynamic evolution of creation and performance. For the other two weeks, participate in a chamber ensemble dedicated to one opera, either 'The Handmaid’s Tale’ or ‘Indians on Vacation,' merging narrative power with instrumental virtuosity. This program goes beyond mastering your instrument by fostering connections, exploring new musical territories, and embracing collaborative artistry.\n\nYou will receive ensemble coaching and one-on-one mentorship with renowned chamber and orchestral musicians to hone skills to build an impactful, inspiring, and engaging chamber music practice.\n\nGroup presentations and faculty-led discussions will focus on collaboration, communication, sound production, interpretation, performance practice, audience engagement, and strategies for career development.\n\nComposers, lyricists and librettists\n\nThe composers, lyricists and librettists will have access to the invaluable resource of singers and collaborative pianists in a rehearsal and educational setting that will allow the pair to explore their own new and existing works. The selected pair will also audit the rehearsal process in the musical exploration of the new arrangement of The Handmaid’s Tale and the new opera, Indians on Vacation. Participating composers will work with faculty composers in a process that supports the creation, performance preparation, and premiere of a new chamber work approximately ten minutes in length for strings, or woodwinds, or brass, with percussion and/or voice, with/without piano.\n\nPrior to the program’s start date, composer group and individual meetings will take place online in May 2024 with composer faculty. These sessions will allow composers to meet one another, introduce their work and ideas, and discuss the full scope of their projects. Having established their individual creative departure points, composers will engage in an intensive and impactful process that allows them to learn from, and deeply invest in one another’s creative development.\n\nArts Writers\n\nParticipating arts writers will create content for Opera Canada magazine as they are embedded in the program. A unique opportunity to write and document new opera creations, and work with the editor of Opera Canada; gaining experience and a published portfolio.\n\nStage Directors\n\nThe chosen stage directors will have access to the invaluable process of opera creation and adaptation. They will work alongside the artistic director/dramaturg assigned to both The Handmaid's Tale and the new opera, Indians on Vacation.\n\nWho should apply?\n\nThis program is for classically trained opera singers, instrumentalists, pianists, composers, lyricist, librettists, arts writers and stage directors.
