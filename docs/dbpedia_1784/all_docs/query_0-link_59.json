Do legislators ‘hedge their bets’ ideologically when faced with constituency uncertainty? This article presents an uncertainty-based theory of ideological hedging. Legislators faced with uncertainty about their constituent preferences have an incentive to present ideologically inconsistent roll-call records. Legislators experiment with a variety of roll-call positions in order to learn the preferences of their constituents. An examination of US senators during 1961–2004 shows that uncertainty due to black enfranchisement and mobilization led to higher ideological inconsistency in legislative voting records. Ideologically inconsistent behaviour by elected officials can be characterized as best responses to a changing and uncertain environment. These results have implications for representation and the stability of democracy.\n\nType\n\nResearch Article\n\nInformation\n\nBritish Journal of Political Science , Volume 41 , Issue 4 , October 2011 , pp. 765 - 794\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S000712341100010X [Opens in a new window]\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright © Cambridge University Press 2011\n\nAccess options\n\nGet access to the full version of this content by using one of the access options below.

For example, see: Aistrup, Joseph, Southern Strategy Revisited (Lexington: University of Kentucky Press, 1996)Google Scholar; Bullock, Charles S., ‘Racial Crossover Voting and the Election of Black Officials’, Journal of Politics, 46 (1984), 238–251CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Keech, William R., The Impact of Negro Voting (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1981)Google Scholar; Lublin, David I., The Republican South (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2004)Google Scholar; Stanley, Harold W., Voter Mobilization and the Politics of Race (New York: Praeger, 1987)Google Scholar. We also know quite a bit about ideological shifts among southern House members in response to increases in black voting power.

For example, see: Murphy, Chad and Yoshinaka, Antoine, ‘Are Mapmakers Able to Target and Protect Congressional Incumbents?

Calvert finds that under uncertainty, candidates would still be likely to converge, though not under some conditions (i.e., uncertainty combined with extreme personal policy preferences for the candidates and motivations based on both winning and policy).\n\n17\n\n17 Calvert, , ‘Robustness of the Multidimensional Voting Model’, p. 86Google Scholar.\n\n18\n\n18 For example, Fenno, Richard F. Jr, Congressmen in Committees (Boston, Mass.: Little, Brown, 1973)Google Scholar; and Burden, The Personal Roots of Representation.\n\n19\n\n19 Non-median positions are also likely when legislators appeal to various subconstituencies. For example, see: Bishin, Benjamin G., ‘Constituency Influence in Congress: Do Subconstituencies Matter?’ Legislative Studies Quarterly, 25 (2000), 389–415CrossRefGoogle Scholar; and Bishin, Benjamin G., Tyranny of the Minority: The Subconstituency Politics Theory of Representation (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2009)Google Scholar. Even under this framework, however, legislators who are uncertain about the location of those subconstituencies should appear more inconsistent than legislators who have more certainty about the preferences of various groups.\n\n20\n\n20 Van Houweling, Robert P., ‘Legislators’ Personal Policy Preferences and Partisan Legislative Organization’ (doctoral dissertation, Harvard University, 2003)Google Scholar.\n\n21\n\n21 For example, Lawrence Evans, C., ‘How Senators Decide’, in Bruce I.

Our study differs, as we focus on the uncertainty legislators have about constituent preferences and on the resulting ideological inconsistency.\n\n24\n\n24 Fox, Justin, ‘Government Transparency and Policymaking’, Public Choice, 131 (2007), 23–44CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n25\n\n25 In some ways, a large increase in a new voter group is similar to a ‘surprise’ that occurs through experiential learning.

For example, Tomz, Michael and Van Houweling, Robert P., ‘The Electoral Implications of Candidate Ambiguity’, American Political Science Review, 103 (2009), 83–98CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n33\n\n33 Kollman, , Miller, and Page, , ‘Political Parties and Electoral Landscapes’, p. 143Google Scholar.\n\n34\n\n34 For example, Fenno, Home Style.\n\n35\n\n35 For example, Shepsle suggests that incumbents cannot be ambiguous as they have a pre-existing record; we argue that incumbent ambiguity can be achieved to some extent via inconsistency. See Shepsle, ‘The Strategy of Ambiguity’.\n\n36\n\n36 Theoretically, the new voter could be located anywhere along the dimension. In the case we examine later, senators may have surmised that newly enfranchised African-American voters were not on the far right. Of course, if a legislator surmised that black voters are located somewhere on the left side of the spectrum, then (in Figure 2) there will still be uncertainty over the location of the median compared to the scenario with no new voters, but this uncertainty space would be smaller than the more general scenario presented in the figure. Further, while the partisan preferences of black voters are generally known to legislators, there is little evidence that elected officials have in-depth knowledge of the ideological or issue preferences of these new voters.\n\n37\n\n37 Key, V.

This alleviates concerns that the presence of additional dimensions may be driving our results (e.g., what if some legislators are voting consistently on an unobserved third dimension?). We ruled out that possibility by estimating models with misclassified votes using Optimal Classification (OC) scores in three and four dimensions as the dependent variable, and our inferences remain unchanged (see online appendix, which may be viewed at http://www.journals.cambridge.org/jps).\n\n41\n\n41 For more details, see: Poole and Rosenthal, Congress; and Brady and Rohde, ‘When Good Predictions Go Bad’.\n\n42\n\n42 Longley, Kyle, Senator Albert Gore, Sr.: Tennessee Maverick (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2004), p. 148Google Scholar.\n\n43\n\n43 Could Long's inconsistency in Congress during the mid-1960s have also been fuelled by idiosyncratic factors such as his heavy drinking, which provoked ‘erratic and boisterous behaviour’ on his part? See Mann, Robert, Legacy to Power: Senator Russell Long of Louisiana (New York: Paragon, 2003 [1992]), p. 288Google Scholar. We leave this question for others to answer as alcohol consumption is not part of our theory of legislator inconsistency.\n\n44\n\n44 Mervin, David, ‘United States Senate Norms and the Majority Whip Election of 1969’, Journal of American Studies, 9 (1975), 321–333CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n45\n\n45 Data on changes in black electoral strength are not available nationally for this entire time period, but are available for the southern states from 1960 onwards. Southern states are identified as Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.\n\n46\n\n46 The average southern senator cast 596 non-unanimous roll-call votes per congress during that period.\n\n47\n\n47 We use census figures during census years and census population estimates for intervening years.\n\n48\n\n48 This measure is from Hood, Kidd and Morris, ‘Of Byrd[s] and Bumpers’.\n\n49\n\n49 This measure is ideal as it assesses both the change in the state's black voter population over a two-year time period and the relative size of the enfranchised and mobilized black population.\n\n50\n\n50 See David, Paul T., Party Strength in the United States, 1872–1970 (Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 1972)Google Scholar; Hood, Kidd and Morris, ‘Of Byrd[s] and Bumpers’; and Lamis, Alexander P., The Two-party South (New York: Oxford University Press, 1988)Google Scholar. We are grateful to Trey Hood for sharing these political competition data and the black electoral strength data.\n\n51\n\n51 See Shafer, Byron E. and Johnston, Richard, The End of Southern Exceptionalism: Class, Race, and Partisan Change in the Postwar South (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2006)CrossRefGoogle Scholar. To construct this measure, we read the biographies of all senators in the Congressional Biographical Directory, which detail their places of birth and residencies through college (we also referred to other biographical sources when needed). We also employed alternative measures of the cosmopolitan variable (e.g., coding senators as non-natives or natives of the state they represent), and the results were substantively the same as those we present here. We also estimated a model without this variable, and the remaining results were consistent (see online appendix, which may be viewed at http://www.journals.cambridge.org/jps).\n\n52\n\n52 Poole and Rosenthal, Congress, pp. 31–3.\n\n53\n\n53 Alternatively, we also estimated a regression with fixed effects for each congress (reported in Table 3).\n\n54\n\n54 Lee, Frances E. and Oppenheimer, Bruce I., Sizing Up the Senate (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999)Google Scholar.\n\n55\n\n55 Richman, Jesse, ‘Why the Issue Dimensionality of Political Systems Varies’ (doctoral dissertation, Carnegie Mellon University, 2005)Google Scholar.\n\n56\n\n56 While this variable is theoretically relevant, in the South during the time period examined it amounts to a dummy variable for Harry Flood Byrd Jr. (I-Virginia), who switched from Democrat to Independent in 1970. For more on party switchers, see: Grose, Christian R. and Yoshinaka, Antoine, ‘The Electoral Consequences of Party Switching by Incumbent Members of Congress, 1947–2000’, Legislative Studies Quarterly, 28 (2003), 55–75CrossRefGoogle Scholar; McElroy, Gail and Benoit, Kenneth, ‘Party Policy and Group Affiliation in the European Parliament’, British Journal of Political Science, 40 (2010), 377–398CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Yoshinaka, Antoine, ‘House Party Switchers and Committee Assignments: Who Gets ‘What, When, How?’, Legislative Studies Quarterly, 30 (2005), 391–406CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Yoshinaka, Antoine, ‘Party Building Through Conversion’, in Charles S.

Since Byrd caucused with the Democrats even after affiliating as an independent, we estimated the results with Byrd coded as a Democrat and therefore no third-party dummy, and the results were nearly identical to those presented later (see online appendix, which may be viewed at http://www.journals.cambridge.org/jps).\n\n57\n\n57 See Arellano, Manuel and Bond, Stephen, ‘Some Tests of Specification for Panel Data: Monte Carlo Evidence and an Application to Employment Equations’, Review of Economic Studies, 58 (1991), 277–297CrossRefGoogle Scholar; and Judson, Ruth A. and Owen, Ann L., ‘Estimating Dynamic Panel Data Models: A Guide for Macroeconomics’, Economic Letters, 65 (1999), 9–15CrossRefGoogle Scholar. The Arellano–Bond estimator assumes strict exogeneity; that is, current values of X should not be correlated with past values of the error term. Most of the independent variables we include can easily be assumed to be strictly exogenous. However, if past values of the error term affect a senator's career, it is possible that variables related to re-election may not be strictly exogenous. In the online appendix, which may be viewed at http://www.journals.cambridge.org/jps, we show that our results hold if we exclude variables related to re-election.\n\n58\n\n58 Given the presence of interactive terms, the computation of the marginal effects of changes in black electoral strength (X 3) for a Democratic senator is based on varying all values of the relevant constitutive and interaction terms.\n\n59\n\n59 We also estimated a model that included a three-way interaction between black electoral strength, Democrat and competitiveness (and all constitutive terms and two-way interactions). The results show that the combined effect of changes in black electoral strength and competitiveness is larger for Democratic than for Republican senators. Democratic senators from competitive states cast inconsistent votes when faced with changes in black electoral strength (see online appendix at http://www.journals.cambridge.org/jps).\n\n60\n\n60 Wright, Gerald C.
