I began the bass soon after and played them both through high school, playing in the Boise State University Community Symphony, the Boise Philharmonic, while also participating Math Club, and winning All-Conference honors in football as a center on the offensive line.\n\nIn Boise I won scholarships on bass to the AFM Congress of Strings at University of Washington, Boise State University, and Grand Prize in the Idaho Federated Music Clubs Solo Competition. Following that were scholarships to the Stetson Summer Institute, Aspen, and the University of Texas at Austin where I earned a degree in music performance as a student of Stuart Sankey, formerly of the Julliard faculty.\n\nDuring college I played in various regional orchestras in Texas, joined the Austin Symphony, and developed an appreciation for traditional folk music. After college I pursued diverse freelance musical activities and learned old time fiddle. I spent several years traveling throughout North America and western Europe playing in streets and public markets. My busking (busking: the art of public performing with a receptacle for donations — not to be confused with begging or panhandling) activities eventually resulted in the development of my one-man-band, The Not Quite Fulharmonic Orchestra, an acoustic back pack percussion instrument played with fiddle or guitar.\n\nI spent the 1990's based in Seattle where I played regularly at Pike Place Market, regional fairs and festivals, nightclubs (mostly blues) and once again, in regional orchestras.

I volunteer for Spokane Public Radio and a member of the Peace and Justice Action League of Spokane (PJALS) and serve on it's Palestine-Israel Human Rights Committee (PIHRC). I'm a founding member of the P-Jammers Community Marching Band, (or PJAMRS - the Peace and Justice Activist Musical Rascals of Spokane) and have been involved with both the Spokane and Yakima Orchestra Committees, and the boards of AFM local 105, and the Regional Orchestra Players' Association (ROPA).\n\nI grew up listening to my dad's truck radio and my sister's rock albums - Ray Charles, Roger Miller, the British invasion, etc. I have an affinity for late sixties - early seventies rock including Beatles, Frank Zappa, and the Grateful Dead. Classically, I'm a Bach-Beethoven- Mahler kind of guy. Currently my favorite band is Red Elvises - surf rock based with Russian idioms and insightful, funny lyrics, as well as their predecessor band, Limpopo - Russian folk music with a groove.\n\nBetween my orchestra circuit and the Not Quite Fulharmonic, I continue to make appearances throughout the great northwest, and in between gigs I enjoy snow skiing and jumping into lakes, often at a family cabin at my favorite place, McCall, Idaho.\n\nPRINCIPAL FLUTE\n\nFrances L.

He attended Ferris High School (graduated in 2009), Whitworth University (Undergraduate degree, 2013) and Eastern Washington University (Masters degree, 2016).

His performing accomplishments include 1st place in Washington State for the Multiple Percussion category (WMEA 2009), 1st place Spokane “Scholar of Fine Arts” (2009), “Outstanding Soloist” of the Elmhurst College Jazz Festival (Drum Set, 2013) Whitworth University concerto competition winner (Marimba, 2013) and Eastern Washington University concerto competition winner (Marimba, 2016). His teaching accomplishments include a student winning the Gonzaga concerto competition (2022) and multiple high school students winning Washington State competitions on Marimba and Timpani (WMEA 2022, 2024).\n\nBeing a member of the Spokane Symphony is uniquely special for him because as a child he attended SSO concerts with his parents. He imagined how fun it would be if he got to play with them when he grew up. During his high school and college years he took lessons and music classes from all three of the previous SSO percussionists (Paul Raymond, Rick Westrick and Bryan Bogue) and spent roughly a decade playing with them in the SSO as a sub before winning an official position with the Symphony in 2024. He also studied with former SSO Timpanist Adam Wallstein and with Dr. Michael Waldrop, the professor of percussion at EWU. Being an official member of the Spokane Symphony is a childhood dream come true for him! He thanks God every day for the huge blessing of his wife, Katie, and their four sons: Nelson, Edmund, Boaz and Moses.
