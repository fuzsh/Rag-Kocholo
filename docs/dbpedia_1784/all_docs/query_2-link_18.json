        "text": "The Department of Classics:\n\nDepartment website: https://classics.columbia.edu/\n\nOffice location: 617 Hamilton Hall\n\nOffice contact: 212-854-3902, classics@columbia.edu\n\nDirector of Undergraduate Studies: Professor Nikolas Kakkoufa, Nk2776@columbia.edu\n\nUndergraduate Administrator: Colleen Swift, cks2142@columbia.edu\n\nAncient Studies\n\nThe Interdisciplinary Program in Ancient Studies is administered by Classics\n\nClassics is the study of the civilizations of ancient Greece and Rome (c. 900 BCE to 500 CE): their languages, literature, history, philosophy, art, and ways of life. The purpose of this program is to enable the student to explore the cultural context of the ancient Mediterranean as a whole while concentrating on one specific Mediterranean or Mesopotamian culture. Central to the concept of the program is its interdisciplinary approach, in which the student brings the perspectives and methodologies of at least three different disciplines to bear on his or her area of specialization.\n\nFaculty participating in the program are scholars specializing in all aspects of ancient culture and civilization from the Departments of Anthropology; Art History and Archaeology; Classics; History; Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies; Philosophy; and Religion, ensuring that a wide variety of approaches are available.\n\nStudent Advising\n\nDirector of Undergraduate Studies: Professor Nikolas Kakkoufa, Nk2776@columbia.edu\n\nStudents should consult with the DUS who will direct them to the appropriate faculty advisor for their research interest area.\n\nEnrolling in Classes\n\nStudents starting in the Major should start with the language placement exam to determine the appropriate language level for their prior knowledge. Exams are administered in late August by the Department of Classics. Students who cannot take the exam should contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies to make arrangements.\n\nFor those students who are starting the major without prior knowledge of the ancient languages please start at the beginning of the sequence (1000 level) in one of the ancient languages and speak to the Director of Undergraduate Studies to determine your best course of study.\n\nPreparing for Graduate Study\n\nhttps://classics.columbia.edu/preparation-for-graduate-study\n\nStudents who are considering graduate work in Classics should be aware that because our Classics major is not a pre-professional degree, simply fulfilling the normal major requirements will not guarantee admission to a graduate program. By far the most important element in preparation for graduate school admission is a good command of both the Latin and the Greek languages, so students who wish to go to graduate school should attempt to reach the advanced level in both languages. The two courses at the intermediate level required in the secondary language for the Classics major are not enough for admission to most graduate programs, and the language requirements of both Classical Studies and Ancient Studies are well below the level normally necessary for graduate school admission. The importance of languages holds not only for students wishing to study ancient literature, but also for those interested primarily in other aspects of the ancient world (history, art, philosophy, religion, etc.), because it is not possible to pursue advanced research successfully unless one can make use of the primary sources. Students who have not done the requisite amount of language work and wish to go to graduate school can enroll in a post-baccalaureate program (either at Columbia or at another institution) to do one or two years of intensive language work before starting graduate school.\n\nWhile knowledge of Latin and Greek is the most important factor in graduate school admission, it is by no means the only one. Students considering graduate work are also advised to write a senior thesis (and not to substitute the thesis for any of the other advanced courses). If possible, it is a good idea to use some of your summers (especially the one between junior and senior year) on a relevant activity such as archaeological fieldwork experience, travel and/or study in Greece or Italy, learning French or German, improving your Latin or Greek, or working as a research assistant for a Classicist. It is also useful to get high scores on the GRE test, and these are best achieved by obtaining and studying information on the types of questions asked on the test and taking practice tests.\n\nThe department does offer a combined BA/MA program in Classics allowing them to complete the MA in Classics within one year of receiving their BA.\n\nThe array of graduate degrees on offer in the US and abroad can be bewildering—including master’s and doctoral programs in Classics and a variety of related subjects—and the character and quality of graduate programs differs widely. It is therefore important to gather information and seek advice.\n\nIf you are considering graduate work, you should discuss your plans with the Director of Undergraduate Studies and other faculty members no later than the beginning of the fall semester before you hope to apply (i.e., typically the fall of your senior year).\n\nCoursework Taken Outside of Columbia\n\nAdvanced Placement\n\nThe department grants 3 credits for a score of 5 on the Latin AP exam, which also satisfies the foreign language requirement, upon successful completion (with a grade of B or higher) of a Latin class at the 3000-level or higher.\n\nBarnard College Courses\n\nThe Department of Classics at Columbia and the Department of Classics and Ancient Studies at Barnard College work closely together. Students may take courses at Barnard to count towards the Major or Minor. Students at Barnard should speak to their advisor at Barnard regarding Columbia courses as the departments are distinct and the requirements for their respective majors are different.\n\nTransfer Courses\n\nStudents transferring to Columbia should contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies to discuss equivalencies and what level of courses they wish to take.\n\nStudy Abroad Courses\n\nSeeing the ancient sites and monuments is an important part of the study of antiquity, and there are a number of ways to acquire some familiarity with the physical remains of Greek and Roman civilization. The Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome offers in each term an excellent one-semester program, usually taken in the junior year, and the College Year in Athens offers a wide variety of courses ranging from language and literature to history, art, and archaeology. During the summer there are more options, including the outstanding Summer Sessions of the American School for Classical Studies in Athens. A listing of fieldwork opportunities is published annually by the Archaeological Institute of America.\n\nSummer Courses\n\nCourses are offered over the summer by the department providing opportunities to study the ancient languages over the summer.\n\nCourses are also offered in Classical Civilization including Worlds of Alexander and Classical Mythology.\n\nCore Curriculum Connections\n\nFaulty and Graduate Instructors from the Department of Classics Teach in the Core, usually Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization.\n\nSome Classics courses can be used to count toward the Global Core requirement as noted in the course information.\n\nUndergraduate Research and Senior Thesis\n\nUndergraduate Research in Courses\n\nStudents should consult with the Director of Undergraduate Studies, Professor Nikolas Kakkoufa at nk2776@columbia.edu. Students can register for Directed readings with a faculty member\n\nSenior Thesis Coursework and Requirements\n\nStudents are required to take the Major Seminar UN3996 as part of the program. The course focuses on the preparation for the Senior Thesis and methods in the field of Classics. Currently students have the option to participate in a trip abroad to sites in the ancient world.\n\nUndergraduate Research Outside of Courses\n\nStudents are encouraged to participate in the Ancient Play put on yearly by the Barnard Columbia Ancient Drama Group.\n\nColumbia runs its own archeological summer program at Hadrian's Villa in Tivoli. Contact Professor Francesco de Angelis.\n\nStudents wanting Columbia or Barnard credit for work done abroad should discuss their plans with the director of undergraduate studies at an early date to enable them to incorporate experience abroad most practically into their programs here.\n\nThe Department is able to support a limited number of students to study ancient languages over the summer through the Comager Fund and the Undergraduate Latin fund. Interested students should contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies.\n\nUndergraduate students can apply to the SNFPHI Summer Research Internship in Public Humanities and Hellenic Studies. This six week internship invites undergraduate students to explore public humanities, gain hands-on experience with its objectives, methods, and outcomes, and pursue a group project that connects research on Greece with a broad public audience. The internship is structured around: (1) a seminar in Hellenic Studies in which students explore aspects of modern Greek history and culture relevant to their internship research, (2) a workshop in which students are trained in the methods and tools of public-facing research, and (3) a group project in which students work closely with Columbia faculty and public humanities partners in Greece\n\nDepartment Honors and Prizes\n\nDepartment Honors\n\nDepartmental Honors are awarded for overall outstanding performance in the Classics.\n\nAcademic Prizes\n\nThe department offers two prize competitions yearly (Earle and Romaine) in sight translation of Greek and Latin. These prizes are awarded on the basis of examinations given each spring.\n\nTwo prizes are given to graduating Columbia College seniors:\n\nThe Caverly Prize is awarded annually for outstanding performance by a graduating Columbia College major.\n\nThe Stadler Prize is awarded annually to a graduating senior of Columbia College who is judged by the faculty to have demonstrated academic excellence through course work and the writing of a senior essay on some aspect of the history or culture of the classical world.\n\nOther Important Information\n\nStudents interested in majoring in Ancient Studies should reach out to the Department early in their academic career. Students should contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies with any questions."
