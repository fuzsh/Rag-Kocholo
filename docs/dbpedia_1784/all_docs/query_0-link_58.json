        "text": "To investigate the role of H/ACA snoRNAs during the earliest cellular response to oncogene activation, we interrogated the expression of ~90 H/ACA snoRNAs in primary human skin fibroblasts using a snoRNA quantitative PCR (qPCR) array, in the context of oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) by expression of RASG12V (Pylayeva-Gupta et al., 2011). While the levels of the vast majority of H/ACA snoRNAs appeared unchanged following RASG12V expression in primary fibroblasts, we observed a dynamic change in the expression of 28 H/ACA snoRNAs compared to control cells (Figure 1A and Figure 1—source data 1) (for example SNORA23, SNORA24, SNORA26, SNORA48, and SNORA67). The majority of these H/ACA snoRNAs were predominately upregulated (FDR < 0.1), with the exception of 3 snoRNAs that were downregulated (SNORA36C, SNORA53, and SNORA70B) downstream of oncogenic RAS. The increase in H/ACA snoRNA levels upon RASG12V expression is not associated with elevated global protein production. On the contrary, we observe a pronounced decrease in overall protein synthesis as a consequence of RAS-induced senescence detected by monitoring O-propargyl-puromycin (OPP) incorporation into newly synthesized proteins (Figure 1B and Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, top panel). This change in global protein synthesis is consistent with the cell cycle arrest that occurs upon induction of senescence. We next investigated whether changes in the expression of specific H/ACA snoRNAs is selective to RAS activation or whether it is similarly induced upon other oncogenic signals. Interestingly, downregulation of the tumor suppressor PTEN (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, bottom panel), a known oncogenic event that also promotes OIS in primary cells, had no obvious effect on the expression of selective RAS-induced H/ACA snoRNAs in primary fibroblasts (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and highlighted in Figure 1A). These findings suggest that distinct oncogenic lesions alter a unique snoRNA expression pattern during OIS.\n\nFigure 1—source data 1\n\nH/ACA snoRNA levels upon oncogenic HRAS expression.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.48847.010\n\nTo extend the broader implications of our findings to human cancer etiology, we analyzed H/ACA snoRNA expression in ~300 human cancers using previously published microarray gene expression datasets (Hao et al., 2011; Jima et al., 2010; Kabbout et al., 2013; Skrzypczak et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2012) designed to capture small RNA species, such as snoRNAs, that are often excluded during RNA sequencing library preparation. By assessing the average expression level of individual H/ACA snoRNAs in cancer specimens and matched control samples from five major tumor types (lymphoma [Jima et al., 2010], pancreatic [Zhang et al., 2012], colon [Skrzypczak et al., 2010], lung [Kabbout et al., 2013], and liver [Hao et al., 2011]), we identified H/ACA snoRNAs displaying changes in expression greater than ± 20% (p<10−5) in tumor samples compared to control samples (Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Figure 1—figure supplement 2—source data 1). In the case of liver cancer, we observed an upregulation of 4 snoRNAs (SNORA14B, SNORA17, SNORA72, and SNORA81) and decreased expression of 2 H/ACA snoRNAs (SNORA24 and SNORA67) (p<10−5) in 91 primary HCC specimens compared to matched adjacent non-tumor hepatic tissue (Figure 1C, left panel, Figure 1—figure supplement 3, and Figure 1—figure supplement 2—source data 1). Interestingly, two H/ACA snoRNAs, SNORA24 and SNORA67, identified in our expression analysis upon RASG12V-induced senescence (Figure 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 1B), were significantly decreased in HCC specimens compared to matched adjacent non-tumor tissue (p<1.35×10−9 and p<4.6×10−7, respectively). These findings suggest that SNORA24 and SNORA67 may act as tumor suppressors downstream of the early steps of oncogenic activation and may therefore be lost or downregulated during tumor progression. We next probed the clinical significance of altered H/ACA snoRNA expression in the same liver cancer microarray gene expression dataset, where survival data was available from 91 patients (Hao et al., 2011; Kan et al., 2013). After separating HCC patients into high or low snoRNA expression using mean ±1 standard deviation (SD) of snoRNA levels as a cutoff point, Kaplan-Meier curve analysis indicated that low levels of SNORA24 were associated with worse overall survival compared to patients with high SNORA24 expression (p=0.03, log-rank test) (Figure 1C, right panel). Interestingly, other snoRNAs assessed (including SNORA17, SNORA67, and SNORA72) did not demonstrate evidence for an association between expression levels and patient survival (Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–C, right panels). Importantly, we confirmed that SNORA24 was decreased in an independent patient cohort consisting of primary matched tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissue from 13 HCC patients (Supplementary file 1, samples 1–13) using qPCR (Figure 1—figure supplement 4A). Similar to our observations from microarray gene expression analysis, SNORA24 was dramatically decreased in all HCC tumor specimens compared to non-tumor adjacent tissue by qPCR (p<0.0001) (Figure 1—figure supplement 4A). In the same matched tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissue, we detected no change in the expression of the SNORA24 host gene, SNHG8 (Small Nucleolar RNA Host Gene 8) (Figure 1—figure supplement 4B). Together, these findings suggest that SNORA24 may exert a tumor suppressor role in HCC.\n\nAs SNORA24 was significantly decreased in HCC and low SNORA24 levels were associated with poor patient survival, we next sought to assess the tumor suppressor activity of Snora24 in liver cancer development in vivo. To this end, we employed a previously described mouse model of oncogenic RAS-induced senescence (Carlson et al., 2005; Kang et al., 2011) whereby hydrodynamic tail vein injection allows stable delivery of oncogenic RAS to hepatocytes using the sleeping beauty (SB) transposase system (Figure 1—figure supplement 5A). This model permits mosaic expression of RASG12V in the mouse liver (SB(+)NRASG12V mice) which activates an anti-tumor program (OIS) to halt tumor development (Kang et al., 2011). We confirmed that RASG12V promoted senescence in vivo after 6 days in SB(+)NRASG12V mice livers by measuring two well-characterized markers of senescence, senescence-associated (SA) β-galactosidase (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2005) and a cell cycle inhibitor p21 (Brown et al., 1997), both of which are activated downstream of mitogenic signals to halt pre-malignant cells (Collado et al., 2005; Kuilman et al., 2010) (Figure 1D, top row). To test whether Snora24 was implicated in OIS in SB(+)NRASG12V mice, we used tail vein injection of locked nucleic acid (LNA) to target Snora24 (LNA-24) for degradation. In so doing, we observed a specific reduction in Snora24 levels in the mouse liver employing LNA-24 compared to a non-targeting scrambled sequence LNA (LNA-ctrl) (Figure 1—figure supplement 5B), with no observed impact on the levels of the corresponding snoRNA host gene, Snhg8 (Figure 1—figure supplement 5C). Treatment with LNA-ctrl or LNA-24 had no obvious effects on hepatic tissue architecture or function (data not shown). Strikingly, we observed a bypass of OIS upon Snora24 reduction in this model, as evident by reduced p21 expression and a lack of β-galactosidase staining in liver tissue from LNA-24 treated SB(+)NRASG12V mice compared to LNA-ctrl treated SB(+)NRASG12V mice (Figure 1D, right panel, p<0.005, n = 3 mice per condition). Importantly, LNA-24 decreased pseudouridine modifications on 18S rRNA at positions U609 and U863 (Figure 1—figure supplement 5D), without impacting modifications at other sites on 18S rRNA (U105) or 28S rRNA (U1731) that not guided by SNORA24 (Figure 1—figure supplement 5E).\n\nHaving identified that cancer-associated changes in Snora24 lead to bypass of OIS in the context of oncogenic RAS expression in vivo, we next sought to determine whether reduction of this single H/ACA snoRNA was sufficient to promote tumor development in this model. To do this, we analyzed the liver phenotype of SB(+)NRASG12V mice treated with either LNA-ctrl or LNA-24 for four months. In contrast to LNA-ctrl treated SB(+)NRASG12V mice, which have normal livers and do not show any signs of HCC (Figure 2A, bottom left panel, representative image from n = 8 mice), we found that a reduction in Snora24 cooperates with RASG12V to promote the development of liver cancer in all LNA-24 treated SB(+)NRASG12V mice examined (Figure 2A, bottom right panel, representative image from n = 8 mice). Pathological analysis of liver specimens revealed the presence of HCC in LNA-24 treated SB(+)NRASG12V mice, with evidence of dramatic lipid accumulation and swollen hepatocytes suggestive of hepatocyte balloons, the pathology of which resembles human steatohepatitic HCC (SH-HCC) (Figure 2B). Interestingly, SH-HCC is a subtype of liver cancer characterized by increased fat accumulation, the etiology and genetic makeup of which is poorly understood (Salomao et al., 2010). The presence of lipids in liver tumors derived from LNA-24 treated SB(+)NRASG12V mice was confirmed by Oil Red O (ORO) staining (Figure 2C and Figure 2—figure supplement 1, n = 3 mice, p=0.0107). Taken together, these findings indicate that loss of Snora24 cooperates with oncogenic RAS to promote the development of HCC in vivo. These data also indicate that cancer-associated changes in SNORA24, identified in HCC patient expression data (Figure 1C), may play a direct role in HCC pathogenesis.\n\nTo investigate the importance of Snora24 in established HCC, we turned to a genetically engineered mouse model of liver cancer driven by the expression of oncogenic KrasG12D in the mouse liver using albumin-cre (Alb-cre;KrasG12D). In this genetically engineered mouse model, oncogenic RAS is ubiquitously expressed in the fetal liver and therefore these animals develop HCC within 8 months of age (O'Dell et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2019). In line with human HCC patient expression data (Figure 1C and Figure 1—figure supplement 4A), we found that in established liver tumors derived from Alb-cre;KrasG12D mice, Snora24 was significantly decreased in tumor tissue compared to liver tissue from wild-type mice (Figure 2D, n = 3 mice per condition). To test the tumor suppressive activity of Snora24 in a more aggressive liver cancer, we orthotopically injected primary tumor cells derived from Alb-cre;KrasG12D liver tumor (Xu et al., 2019), following CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing of the Snora24 loci using two distinct single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting Snora24 (sgRNA-24) (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A), into the livers of wild-type mice. sgRNA-24 KrasG12D HCC cells exhibit reduced Snora24 expression (Figure 2E, right panel) with no obvious impact on the levels of the corresponding host gene (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B). Following orthotopic injection of control (Ctrl) KrasG12D HCC cells or sgRNA-24 KrasG12D HCC cells into the subcapsular region of the median liver lobe of wild-type mice, we monitored survival over a period of 4 weeks and found that Snora24 reduction, decreased the overall survival of mice compared to controls (p=0.017) (Figure 2E, left panel n = 4 mice per arm). Snora24 reduction in this mouse model of liver cancer significantly decreased Snora24-guided pseudouridine modifications on 18S rRNA (Figure 2—figure supplement 2C) as shown using SCARLET (Site-specific Cleavage And Radioactive-labeling followed by Ligation-assisted Extraction and Thin-layer chromatography) (Li et al., 2015; Liu and Pan, 2015). These findings reveal a previously uncharacterized role for Snora24 in the maintenance of RAS-driven HCC in vivo.\n\nThe impact of SNORA24 and SNORA24-directed rRNA modifications on ribosome activity and global protein production remains unknown. SNORA24 guides two pseudouridine modifications on the 18S rRNA component of the small (40S) ribosomal subunit (Boccaletto et al., 2018), one at position uridine (U) 609 (U609) within helix 18 (h18) and one at U863 at the base of expansion segment 6 (ES6) (Figure 3A, highlighted in red). While the ES6 modification is distal to known functional centers of the ribosome, the h18 modification is located within the functionally important, so-called ‘530 loop’ region of the shoulder domain (Figure 3A, highlighted in pale green). The shoulder domain closes towards the body of the small ribosomal subunit during the process of aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) selection, bringing residue G530 (G626 in human rRNA) into direct contact with the messenger RNA (mRNA) codon-tRNA anticodon pair such that it directly contributes to mRNA decoding (Demeshkina et al., 2012; Fislage et al., 2018; Loveland et al., 2016; Ogle et al., 2001; Ogle et al., 2002). We therefore next sought to investigate the role of these SNORA24-guided modifications in modulating ribosome function in HCC. To address this question, we employed a human HCC cell line, HuH-7, with a stable reduction in SNORA24 (HuH-7 sgRNA-24) (Figure 2—figure supplement 3A) and quantified SNORA24-mediated pseudouridylation in h18 and ES6 using SCARLET (Li et al., 2015; Liu and Pan, 2015). As expected, SCARLET revealed the amount of uridine (U) and pseudouridine (Ψ) present at both residue 609 and 863 on 18S rRNA and confirmed diminished pseudouridine levels at both sites in HuH-7 sgRNA-24 cells compared to isogenic HuH-7 sgRNA-ctrl cells (>90% reduction) (Figure 3B and Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Interestingly, we did not detect any significant change in global protein production in cells lacking SNORA24-guided modifications as measured by OPP incorporation into newly synthesized protein (Figure 3C). Furthermore, we saw no detectable difference in the abundance of ribosome subunits or the abundance and distribution of polysome in HuH-7 sgRNA-24 cells compared to isogenic HuH-7 sgRNA-ctrl cells by sucrose gradient fractionation trace (Figure 3D). These results indicate that SNORA24 and SNORA24-guided rRNA modifications are likely dispensable for ribosome biogenesis and global protein production in HCC and instead may harbor specific functions during translation.\n\nTo gain mechanistic insights into how Ψ609 and Ψ863 influence ribosome activity, we harnessed the power of smFRET imaging to capture the functional dynamics of ribosomes on mRNA (Ferguson et al., 2015; Juette et al., 2016). Ribosome transit along mRNA is a highly coordinated, multistep process involving the selection of the correct aa-tRNA in the ribosomal aminoacyl (A) site for each codon, peptide bond formation, and the translocation of the ribosome, codon-by-codon along the mRNA. We first imaged aa-tRNA selection or the process by which aa-tRNAs are decoded at the ribosomal A site to extend the nascent polypeptide by one amino acid using an established in vitro smFRET assay (Blanchard et al., 2004; Ferguson et al., 2015; Geggier et al., 2010). Briefly, translation initiation complexes (80S ICs) carrying Cy3-labeled Met-tRNAfMet in the peptidyl (P) site and displaying a UUC codon (encoding Phenylalanine (Phe)) in the ribosomal A site were formed from isolated ribosomal subunits purified from HuH-7 sgRNA-ctrl or sgRNA-24 cells (Figure 4A). The 80S ICs were immobilized in a passivated microfluidic flow cell and imaged as described previously (Juette et al., 2016). Ternary complex, consisting of LD655-labeled Phe-tRNAPhe, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A), and GTP, was then injected into the flow cell and the process of aa-tRNA selection was followed via the time-evolution of the FRET signal between the P-site tRNA and the aa-tRNA decoded at the A site, at a time resolution of 15 milliseconds (ms).\n\nRibosomes purified from both HuH-7 sgRNA-ctrl and sgRNA-24 cells, proceeded through the aa-tRNA selection mechanism, as expected (Ferguson et al., 2015; Geggier et al., 2010), via a stepwise progression through states of increasing FRET efficiency (Figure 4B). These FRET states correspond to initial Phe-tRNAPhe binding or codon recognition events (FRET ~0.2), from which aa-tRNAs can either rapidly dissociate or proceed to the GTPase-activated state (FRET ~0.4). GTP hydrolysis within the GTPase-activated state enables eEF1A to dissociate and allows aa-tRNAs to transition into a fully accommodated state, where Phe-tRNAPhe in the A site undergoes peptide bond formation (FRET ~0.7) (Figure 4B). We estimated the rate of peptide bond formation in this system and calculated the catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of tRNA selection (Figure 4C and D). In doing so, we found that ribosomes purified from HuH-7 sgRNA-24 cells were ~50% more efficient in aa-tRNA selection of tRNAPhe compared to ribosomes isolated from sgRNA-ctrl cells (p<10−6, Welch’s t-test) (kcat/KM of 50 ± 7 µM−1 s−1 vs. 71 ± 4 µM−1 s−1, respectively) (Figure 4D). We further assessed ribosomes displaying a different codon, AAA (encoding Lysine (Lys)), in the A site reacting with ternary complex containing a cognate LD650 labeled Lys-tRNALys using the same assay. In this context, we found that ribosomes lacking Ψ609 and Ψ863 were also more efficient in selection of tRNALys, however, the magnitude of the change was smaller than that observed for tRNAPhe. Specifically, ribosomes from HuH-7 sgRNA-24 cells were ~30% more efficient in selection of tRNALys compared to their wild-type counterparts (p<10−6, Welch’s t-test) (kcat/KM of 27 ± 5 µM−1 s−1 vs. 36 ± 5 µM−1 s−1) (Figure 4D) as opposed to the ~50% differences observed in the case of tRNAPhe. These findings indicate that SNORA24-directed rRNA pseudouridylation acts to regulate decoding on actively translating ribosomes.\n\nRibosomes undergo large-scale conformational rearrangements during the elongation phase of translation (Voorhees and Ramakrishnan, 2013). For example, in pre-translocation ribosome complexes, deacylated tRNA within the P site and peptidyl-tRNA within the A site rapidly and dynamically exchange between so-called ‘classical’ and ‘hybrid’ states of tRNA binding (Ferguson et al., 2015). Classical (C: A/A, P/P) and hybrid states (H1: A/P, P/E; H2: A/A, P/E) can be distinguished by smFRET imaging based on their distinct FRET efficiency values (Ferguson et al., 2015) (Figure 4E and F). To assess the potential impacts of SNORA24-guided modifications on ribosome dynamics, we imaged pre-translocation complexes generated in the tRNA selection experiments described above bearing Met-Phe-tRNAPhe in the A site. These analyses revealed that ribosomes lacking SNORA24-guided modifications exhibit a modest preference for classical tRNA configurations compared to control ribosomes (15 ± 1% vs. 20 ± 1% Classical, p<10−6, Welch’s t-test) (Figure 4G). In the case of ribosomes bearing Met-Lys-tRNALys in the A site, we instead observed little to no change in tRNA configurations between the two types of ribosomes (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). These findings indicate that pseudouridine modifications at rRNA residues 609 and 863 have the capacity to alter the dynamic properties of pre-translocation ribosome complexes in a way that likely depends on the tRNA species in the P and A sites. Taken together, these smFRET data provide compelling evidence that ribosomes lacking these two specific pseudouridine modifications exhibit functionally relevant physical distinctions in regard to dynamic structural features within the pre-translocation complex, that appear to depend on the mRNA coding sequence.\n\nThe observed impacts on aa-tRNA selection and pre-translocation complex dynamics lead us to investigate the sensitivity of HuH-7 sgRNA-ctrl or sgRNA-24 cells to ribosome-targeting drugs (Figure 4H and Figure 4—figure supplement 2). In doing so, we found that HCC cells lacking SNORA24 displayed a specific and increased tolerance to Anisomycin (ANS), a drug that binds to the ribosomal A site (Hansen et al., 2003) and inhibits peptidyl transfer (Figure 4H). This result is in perfect agreement with our smFRET observations that loss of SNORA24-guided modifications increase the efficiency of aa-tRNA selection, which would be expected to reduce the time window during each elongation cycle that the ribosome is sensitive to ANS. Collectively, these investigations provide compelling evidence that snoRNA-mediated changes in the chemical composition of mammalian ribosomes, have the potential to affect tRNA selection, ribosome dynamics, and sensitivity of cancer cells to specific translation inhibitors.\n\nOCT embedded frozen tissue was prepared using standard protocols and following equilibrated at room temperature for 10 min, sections were fixed in formalin for 5 min. Following wash in tap water, slides were stained in ORO working solution for 10 min at room temperature. ORO stock and working solution were prepared as previously described (Mehlem et al., 2013). Slides were washed in tap water for 10 min and counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin by submerging the slides in hematoxylin for 3 min. Slides were rinsed under running tap water for ~10 min and mounted with AquaSlip from AMTS Inc (Lodi, CA, USA). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H and E) stained frozen sections were imaged on an Aperio Versa slide scanner (Leica Biosystems), equipped with a HC PL Fluotar 10X/.32 objective. ORO stained frozen sections were imaged on an Axio Scan.Z1 slide scanner (Carl Zeiss Microscopy), equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 10x/0.45 objective. ORO quantification was performed by selecting four regions of interest (ROIs) from each H and E. scn image file and extracted as a TIFF at 1000 × 1000 pxl (551 × 551 microns; scale = 551 nm/pxl) in Aperio ImageScope v.12.3.2 software. The analogous region from the ORO stained serial adjacent section. czi image file (scale = 442 nm/pxl) was extracted in Zen, converted to TIFF and downsampled to yield the same spatial scaling for analysis. The two resulting TIFF files were spatially registered using ImageJ TrackEM2. An ORO RGB image was used as input to tune the threshold parameters in the Zen Pro Image Analysis software module for quantifying lipid droplets. Three classes were created; ORO (Oil Red O positive), All (all tissue), and White (empty) with the following colormetric parameters: ORO: R 94–158, G 2–98, B – 109; All: R 90, G 10–177, B 19–182; White: R 191–220, G 177–210, B 181–224. The percentage (%) ORO positive stained area per total area examined from four different ROIs of each tissue section was calculated and summed. For each condition tested, the mean ± SD ORO positive area (%) was plotted, with the Y-axis label representing ‘ORO positive area (%)”. For mouse tissue sections (n = 3 mice), ROIs were identified within the H and E images that could be classified as abnormal or normal tissue under the guidance of a pathologist. Abnormal or normal tissue ROIs (fixed area of 7400 pixels) were applied to the analogous region within the registered ORO image (as shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1). For human HCC specimens, patient samples were dichotomized into high or low SNORA24 expression by identifying samples with SNORA24 expression more extreme than ±1 SD from the mean (n = 17 HCC specimens) and ORO staining and quantification was performed as described above.\n\nAll smFRET experiments were conducted at 37° C in human polymix buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM NH4Cl, 2 mM spermidine, 5 mM putrescine) containing a mixture of triplet-state quenchers (1 mM Trolox, 1 mM 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol (NBA), 1 mM cyclooctatetraene (COT)) and an enzymatic oxygen scavenging system (2 µM 3,4-Dihydroxybenzoic acid (PCA), 0.02 Units/ml protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (PCD)). Ribosomes from HuH-7 sgRNA-ctrl or sgRNA-24 cells were prepared using the protocol described in Flis et al. (2018). Elongation factor eEF1A and fluorescence labeled tRNAs were prepared as in Flis et al. (2018). Pre-formed 80S initiation complexes made with ribosomes from either HuH-7 sgRNA-ctrl or sgRNA-24 cells, containing Cy3-labeled Met-tRNAfMet in the P site and displaying either a UUC or AAA codon in the A site, were surface-immobilized on passivated quartz coverslips (Blanchard et al., 2004) in a home-built total internal reflection-based fluorescence microscope (Juette et al., 2016). To initiate tRNA selection, 10 nM ternary complex, consisting of eEF1A, GTP and either Phe-tRNAPhe labeled with LD655 or Lys-tRNALys labeled with LD650 was stop flow delivered to the immobilized ribosomes. Imaging of the pre-translocation complexes was carried out by washing ternary complex from the flow cell with polymix buffer 30 s after injection. smFRET data were recorded at a time resolution of 15 ms at ~0.25 kW/cm2 laser (532 nm) illumination. Donor and acceptor fluorescence intensities were extracted from the recorded movies and FRET efficiency traces were calculated. FRET traces were selected for further analysis according to the following criteria: a single catastrophic photobleaching event, at least 8:1 signal/background-noise ratio and 6:1 signal/signal-noise ratio, less than four donor-fluorophore blinking events and a correlation coefficient between donor and acceptor <0.5.\n\nsmFRET traces were analyzed using hidden Markov model idealization methods as implemented in the SPARTAN software package (Juette et al., 2016). The idealization model for tRNA selection traces included four separate FRET values accounting for unbound, initial binding, GTPase activation, and accommodated states during tRNA selection (Ferguson et al., 2015; Geggier et al., 2010) with FRET values of 0.0 ± 0.05, 0.2 ± 0.075, 0.46 ± 0.075 and 0.72 ± 0.075. The idealization model for the pre-translocation state included three FRET states with FRET values of 0.22 ± 0.075, 0.42 ± 0.075 and 0.72 ± 0.075 (0.61 ± 0.05 in case of LD650 labeled tRNALys containing ribosomes) accounting for the hybrid 1, hybrid two and classical tRNA binding states (Pellegrino et al., 2019). To generate cumulative distributions for estimation of apparent reaction rates during tRNA selection the number of traces that had achieved the 0.72 FRET state prior to each movie frame were summed. An exponential function containing two exponential terms and a term accounting for the initial delay due to the stop flow delivery dead time was then fit to the data. All distributions contained two phases, a fast phase accounting for >85% of events and a slower phase accounting for the remainder. In all cases the reaction rate of the dominant, fast, phase was used for further analysis. To take the effect of donor photobleaching into account for estimation of accurate tRNA selection kcat/KM values, donor photobleaching rates estimated from the total dataset were subtracted from the apparent reaction rates. To estimate the fraction of time the ribosomal pre-translocation complexes spend in each tRNA binding state, state dwell times were extracted directly from the hidden Markov-model idealizations. All experimental uncertainties were estimated from bootstrap analysis of two to five smFRET datasets. Significance testing of the difference in tRNA selection efficiency and tRNA state occupancy between ribosomes isolated from HuH-7 sgRNA-ctrl and sgRNA-24 cells was carried out by a bootstrap implementation of Welch’s t-test. Briefly, the t statistic was calculated from the bootstrap distributions of the estimated reaction rate constants or fractional state occupancies. This was then compared to 106 t statistics calculated from bootstrap samples picked from null distributions generated by shifting the mean of both original distributions to their pooled mean. This generated the upper bound for the P value of p<10−6 reported in the text."
