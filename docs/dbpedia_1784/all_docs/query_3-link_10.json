        "text": "List of famous scholars, with photos, bios, and other information when available. Who are the top scholars in the world? This includes the most prominent scholars, living and dead, both in America and abroad. Several of these scholars also appear on our lists of celebrities with high IQs and the hottest female geniuses. This list of notable scholars is ordered by their level of prominence, and can be sorted for various bits of information, such as where these historic scholars were born and what their nationality is. The people on this list are from different countries, but what they all have in common is that they're all renowned scholars.\n\nThis list of the greatest scholars includes Angela Davis, Sigmund Freud, Cornel West, Nicolaus Copernicus, and more.\n\nFrom reputable, prominent, and well known scholars to the lesser known scholars of today, these are some of the best professionals in the scholar field. If you want to answer the questions, \"Who are the most famous scholars ever?\" and \"What are the names of famous scholars?\" then you're in the right place.\n\nRanked by\n\nBirthplace : Birmingham, Alabama, USA\n\nAngela Davis, a name synonymous with political activism and academia, was born on January 26, 1944, in Birmingham, Alabama. Known primarily as a radical African American educator and activist for civil rights, Davis's early life was marked by racial segregation and societal turmoil. Her involvement in the Civil Rights Movement started at an early age, with the influences of her mother, Sallye Davis - an active member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Davis pursued her desire for knowledge and equality beyond the confines of her hometown, earning her Bachelor's degree from Brandeis University in Massachusetts. She further augmented her expertise by studying philosophy at the University of Frankfurt in Germany. Davis's intellectual journey didn't end there - she continued her quest for knowledge at the University of California, San Diego, where she earned her Ph.D. in philosophy under the guidance of renowned philosopher Herbert Marcuse. Her career as an academic is marked by her tenure as a professor at UCLA, which was marred by controversy due to her association with the Communist Party USA. Davis's political career took a sharp turn when she was charged in connection with the armed takeover of a California courtroom in 1970. Her arrest and subsequent trial became a flashpoint for debate about racial prejudice and justice. Acquitted on all charges in 1972, Davis went on to become a prolific author and lecturer, addressing issues of race, women's rights, and the criminal justice system.\n\nDec. at 85 (1912-1998)\n\nBirthplace : Birmingham, England\n\nJohn Enoch Powell (16 June 1912 – 8 February 1998) was a British politician, classical scholar, author, linguist, soldier, philologist and poet. He served as a Conservative Member of Parliament (1950–1974), then Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) MP (1974–1987), and was Minister of Health (1960–1963). Before entering politics, Powell was a classical scholar, becoming a full professor of Ancient Greek at the age of 25 in Australia. During World War II, he served in both staff and intelligence positions, reaching the rank of brigadier in his early thirties. He also wrote poetry (published as early as 1937), as well as many books on classical and political subjects. Powell attracted widespread attention following his 20 April 1968 address to the General Meeting of the West Midlands Area Conservative Political Centre, which became known as the \"Rivers of Blood\" speech. It criticised current rates of immigration into the UK, especially from the New Commonwealth, and opposed the then-proposed anti-discrimination legislation Race Relations Bill being mooted at the time. In response, Conservative Party leader Edward Heath sacked Powell from his position as Shadow Defence Secretary (1965–1968) in the Conservative opposition. The speech was immediately considered by many as a blatant demonstration of racism, drawing sharp criticism from his own party and from the press. While Powell did not consider himself a racist, The Economist claimed in an editorial on the 50th anniversary of the speech that his rhetoric had a \"lasting and malign effect ... on the way in which race and migration are discussed, or not discussed\".In the aftermath of the Rivers of Blood speech, several polls suggested that between 67 and 82 per cent of the UK population agreed with Powell's opinions. His supporters claimed that the large public following which Powell attracted helped the Conservatives to win the 1970 general election, and perhaps cost them the February 1974 general election, when Powell turned his back on the Conservatives by endorsing a vote for Labour, who returned as a minority government in early March following a hung parliament. Powell was returned to the House of Commons in October 1974 as the Ulster Unionist Party MP for the Northern Irish constituency of South Down. He represented the constituency until he was defeated at the 1987 general election.\n\nDec. at 75 (973-1048)\n\nBirthplace : Khwarezm\n\nAbū Rayḥān Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad Al-Bīrūnī (Persian: ابوریحان محمد بن احمد البیرونی‎ Abū Rayḥān Bērōnī; New Persian: Abū Rayḥān Bīrūnī) (973–after 1050), known as Biruni (Persian: بیرونی‎) or Al-Biruni (Arabic: البيروني‎) in English language, was an Iranian scholar and polymath. He was from Khwarazm – a region which encompasses modern-day western Uzbekistan, and northern Turkmenistan. Biruni is regarded as one of the greatest scholars of the medieval Islamic era and was well versed in physics, mathematics, astronomy, and natural sciences, and also distinguished himself as a historian, chronologist and linguist. He studied almost all fields of science and was compensated for his research and strenuous work. Royalty and powerful members of society sought out Al-Biruni to conduct research and study to uncover certain findings. He lived during the Islamic Golden Age, in which scholarly thought went hand in hand with the thinking and methodology of the Islamic religion. In addition to this type of influence, Al-Biruni was also influenced by other nations, such as the Greeks, who he took inspiration from when he turned to studies of philosophy. He was conversant in Khwarezmian, Persian, Arabic, Sanskrit, and also knew Greek, Hebrew and Syriac. He spent much of his life in Ghazni, then capital of the Ghaznavid dynasty, in modern-day central-eastern Afghanistan. In 1017 he travelled to South Asia and authored a study of Indian culture (Tahqiq ma li-l-hind...) after exploring the Hinduism practised in India. He was given the title \"founder of Indology\". He was an impartial writer on customs and creeds of various nations, and was given the title al-Ustadh (\"The Master\") for his remarkable description of early 11th-century India.\n\nDec. at 83 (1904-1987)\n\nBirthplace : White Plains, New York, USA\n\nJoseph John Campbell (March 26, 1904 – October 30, 1987) was an American Professor of Literature at Sarah Lawrence College who worked in comparative mythology and comparative religion. His work covers many aspects of the human experience. Campbell's most well-known work is his book The Hero with a Thousand Faces (1949), in which he discusses his theory of the journey of the archetypal hero shared by world mythologies, termed the monomyth. Since the publication of The Hero with a Thousand Faces, Campbell's theory has been applied by a wide variety of modern writers and artists. His philosophy has been summarized by his own often repeated phrase: \"Follow your bliss.\" He gained recognition in Hollywood when George Lucas credited Campbell's work as influencing his Star Wars saga.\n\nDec. at 83 (1856-1939)\n\nBirthplace : Příbor, Czech Republic\n\nSigmund Freud, born on May 6, 1856, in Freiberg, now known as the Czech Republic, was an Austrian neurologist who revolutionized psychology with his comprehensive theory of human nature, personality development, and therapeutic techniques. The son of Jacob Freud, a wool merchant, and Amalia Nathanson, Freud spent most of his life in Vienna, where he pursued his education and career. Despite studying medicine at the University of Vienna, Freud's primary fascination lay in neurology, leading him to develop psychoanalysis, a clinical method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst. Freud's theories, often controversial, have profoundly influenced Western thought and psychology. He proposed that the mind is divided into three components: the id, ego, and superego, which interact to shape behavior. His work on the Oedipus complex remains one of his most debated works. Freud also proposed theories on dream interpretation and developed techniques such as free association and transference in psychoanalytic therapy. Apart from his work in psychoanalysis, Freud was also an author, penning several significant texts including The Interpretation of Dreams, Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality, and Beyond the Pleasure Principle. Despite facing ostracism from the medical community due to his unconventional ideas, Freud continued his practice and research in psychoanalysis until his death on September 23, 1939. His impact on psychology and related disciplines continues to be felt today, with many modern psychological theories and therapeutic techniques rooted in Freud's original concepts.\n\nBirthplace : Seattle, Washington\n\nWill Roscoe (February 8, 1955) is an American activist, scholar, and author based in San Francisco, California."
