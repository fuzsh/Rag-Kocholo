        "text": "Required Course\n\nCLST 341A-1 / 341A-2\n\nThe Ancient City\n\n(ALP, CCI, CZ) 2.0 course credits, required\n\nThis required comprehensive and integrated course is a major part of the academic work for the program. It is a two-credit course which requires as much class and study time as two semester courses. It covers Roman archaeology and topography, aspects of social and urban history of Rome, and Roman civilization. Frequent site visits and explorations, intensive museum tours and lectures, and wider-ranging trips based on the Professor-in-Charge's area's of expertise outside Rome are included as part of the course. In the recent past, Campania and Sicily have been the focus of extended and focused study. Because The Ancient City course depends on prior knowledge of Roman history, students are expected to prepare themselves by taking a Roman history course or by careful reading on the subject.\n\nView syllabus\n\nElective Courses\n\nStudents choose remaining courses from the following:\n\nSYLLABI SUBJECT TO CHANGE\n\nIntermediate Latin\n\nLATIN 203A-1\n\n(FL) 1 course credit\n\nAdvanced Latin\n\nLATIN 301A-1\n\n(ALP, CCI, FL) 1 course credit\n\nIntermediate Greek\n\nGREEK 252A-1\n\n(FL) 1 course credit\n\nAdvanced Greek\n\nGREEK 301A\n\n(ALP, CCI, FL) 1 course credit\n\nRenaissance and Baroque Art History\n\nARTHIST 255A\n\n(ALP, CCI, CZ) 1 course credit\n\nIntroductory Italian\n\nITALIAN 101A (No other level of Italian is available.)\n\n(FL) 1 course credit\n\nConservation and Management of the Material Heritage of Ancient Rome\n\nCLST 343SA, ARTHIST 343SA\n\n(CCI, CZ) 1 course credit\n\nPlease note: The textbook for the Italian course is available at the Centro and is a different edition than the one used in the U.S. Therefore, it is recommended that you not purchase the book before arriving in Rome and that you use one of the books available there. Also, for this course, please have a small, portable English-Italian dictionary.)\n\nThe Latin and Greek courses avoid excessive concentration on commonly read works. Students who wish to take an independent study or directed reading may do so, providing it is supervised by a member of the faculty at the student's own college or university. This work will not appear on an ICCS transcript, and no responsibility for it will be taken by the ICCS faculty.\n\nThe Library\n\nFunds provided by the Old Dominion Foundation purchased the initial library in the 1960s. The holdings have increased since then through several generous gifts. Fundamental was the personal collection of the late Professor Brooks Otis, founder of ICCS, which was presented to the library through the generosity of the Packard Foundation.\n\nOver the years, the library has grown with the addition of the personal collections of the late John Rowe Workman and the late John Stambaugh, former Chairman of the Managing Committee and the initiator of the Ancient City course; the late Brian Aitken, who studied at the Centro in 1972, and the late Miranda Marvin, who sent many Wellesley students to the Centro.\n\nIn addition to these gifts, ICCS continuously makes new acquisitions and has benefitted from generous gifts from Hollis Hurd (Spring '70) and the Corning Incorporated Foundation. There also is a small collection on Italian culture and a modest art history collection. Other libraries in Rome, including limited access to the American Academy library, can be made available for student use.\n\nConnect to the ICCS Library online catalog.\n\nProfessor-in-Charge\n\nSonia Sabnis is Professor of Greek, Latin, and Ancient Mediterranean Studies and Humanities at Reed College, where she has taught since 2006. She studied at the Centro during the Fall 1996 semester and received her BA from Columbia University before completing an MA and Ph.D. at University of California, Berkeley. She is broadly interested in imperial literature, Greek and Latin, but her primary research specialty is the African Roman author Apuleius. Her published research includes studies of slavery and literature, figurative katabasis, and reception in different contexts in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, such as contemporary Algerian novels, horror, and poetry in English. Prof. Sabnis was Associate Professor at the Centro in 2017–2018 and has held research fellowships at Vassar College, Wellesley College, and the W. E. B. Du Bois Center at the University of Massachusetts. Her love for mentoring students and undergraduate research extends to her current role as a mentor through the Asian and Asian American Classical Caucus (AAACC).\n\nAssociate Professor\n\nRachel Meyers is Associate Professor of Classical Studies at Iowa State University, where she has taught since 2006. She studied at the Centro in the Spring 1998 semester, received her BA from Yale University, and then earned her PhD in Classical Studies from Duke University. She has diverse interests in the material culture and social history of the ancient Roman world. Her research is focused on the roles and representations of women and gender in the Roman world as well as on portrayals of the imperial family and tools of propaganda. Using an array of evidence encompassing marble portraits and statues, coinage, architectural monuments, written documents, and inscriptions, she explores the practice of philanthropic activity in Roman Hispania and across the Empire. Meyers regularly teaches courses on Latin, Mythology, Roman Archaeology, and Sex and Gender in the Ancient Mediterranean. She is a co-director of a summer study abroad program, bringing Iowa State students to Italy. She loves to travel and has explored ancient sites all around Italy, Greece, Turkey, and Spain.\n\nAssistant Professor\n\nJohn Izzo studies Latin literature, ancient slavery, and classical reception. After earning a bachelor’s degree from Bowdoin College and a master’s degree from the University of Notre Dame, John is currently completing his Ph.D. in Classics at Columbia University. Over the years, John has been the instructor of various Latin and Greek courses, but most recently, he has been appointed as a Core Curriculum Preceptor for Literature Humanities, a two-semester course for first-year students on ancient, medieval, and modern literature. Having spent a year in Italy as the recipient of the 2022 Millicent Mercer Johnsen Rome Prize at the American Academy in Rome, John is eager to return to the Gianicolo, resume his strolls around the city, and enjoy the delicious food of Italy.\n\nResident Instructor\n\nHaley Bertram is a Ph.D. candidate in Classical Archaeology at the University of Cincinnati. She studied abroad at the Centro in Spring 2012 on her way to a BA in Classics from Wellesley College, and then completed her MA in Classical Archaeology at the University of British Columbia. Haley’s research centers on the Archaic Mediterranean world, with a particular interest in the role of consumers in the development of craft production and style. She spent several years living in Greece and France as part of her dissertation research, which investigates the role of western Mediterranean markets in the development of Corinthian pottery from 750-500 BCE. Haley particularly enjoys teaching students how to “read” the material record, whether interpreting objects in their cultural context or discerning stratigraphic levels in the field. She is the Head Trench Supervisor at the Eastern Boeotia Archaeological Project (EBAP) in Boeotia, Greece, and has also participated in fieldwork in the Peloponnese (Corinth and Sikyon), Crete, and at the Iron Age site of Malvieu in southern France. In her free time next year, Haley is looking forward to wandering the various street markets of Rome, with pasticceria stops along the way.\n\nArt History Instructor\n\nPaul Tegmeyer began studying art history as an undergraduate at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, New Mexico, where he was raised. After moving to Italy, actually l'Aquila, outside Rome, in 1983, he began graduate school at Temple University in Rome, and then Philadelphia. He later entered the Ph.D. program at the University of Pennsylvania. His area of specialization is the Italian Renaissance.\n\nHe began teaching the Renaissance. to Baroque Rome course at ICCS from 1990-92 and again from 1997 on. He also been teaching at John Cabot University in Rome since 1991. At ICCS he has had the opportunity to expand his repertoire beyond the Italian Renaissance, teaching courses on Ancient and Medieval Rome, Baroque art, as well as monographic courses on Renaissance Rome; Raphael; Michelangelo; Bernini; et al. Since 1997 he has also conducted the Rome Seminar for the Smithsonian Institute.\n\nHis research focuses primarily on various aspects of Roman Renaissance art (Raphael, Pollaiuolo, Michelangelo, et al.). He is also now in the early stages of preparing with other colleagues, a “Guide to Renaissance Rome”.\n\nScholarships\n\nThe ICCS Scholarship Fund provides for students in need of financial support to study at ICCS. Scholarships have ranged from $500 to $10,000. In recent years no student has had to forego a semester at the Centro because of the cost.\n\nIn order to be considered for a scholarship, students must submit the FAFSA/ISIR so that ICCS can ascertain the student’s Estimated Family Contribution. Students applying for this scholarship must file a current FAFSA application at their home institution. If the student receives financial aid from their institution which is applicable to the ICCS program tuition and fees, they should also submit that award letter. All materials must be submitted with the program application, by the application deadline.\n\nThe Managing Committee will make admissions decisions and then review scholarship applications. Students are informed of scholarship awards within four weeks of the application deadline.\n\nAll information received for consideration of a scholarship award is kept strictly confidential and seen only by the Managing Committee and a limited number of staff in Duke University's Global Education Office."
