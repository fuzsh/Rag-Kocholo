        "text": "The Division of Speech and Hearing Sciences in the School of Medicine's Department of Health Sciences provides academic and professional education for speech-language pathologists and audiologists. Programs of study are available at the master's level in speech-language pathology. Programs of study at the doctoral level are available in clinical audiology (Au.D.) and in research (Ph.D.). The study of speech and hearing requires knowledge in both normal and atypical speech, language, and hearing. The speech and hearing sciences curriculum provides a multifaceted learning environment, including classroom, laboratory, research, and clinical experiences. Three major tracks of study are possible within the curriculum: audiology, speech-language pathology, and speech and hearing sciences. There are three academic degree programs:\n\nA master's degree (M.S.) for entry-level clinical practice of speech-language pathology\n\nA professional doctorate in clinical audiology (Au.D.)\n\nA Ph.D. in speech and hearing sciences for students with a background in speech-language pathology or audiology and related areas who desire a research degree\n\nAll of these programs are interdisciplinary in nature, involving clinical and research activities with other University departments and centers in addition to the Division of Speech and Hearing Sciences.\n\nThe entrance, academic, and residency requirements for the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees correspond to those of The Graduate School. Applicants to the Au.D. program follow the guidelines established by the School of Medicine for that degree program. Students enrolled in clinical degree programs (M.S. and Au.D.) are prepared to meet licensure and certification requirements necessary for the practice of speech-language pathology or audiology. Additional information describing the graduate programs in speech and hearing can be obtained on the division's website.\n\nFollowing the faculty member's name is a section number that students should use when registering for independent studies, reading, research, and thesis and dissertation courses with that particular professor.\n\nProfessors\n\nElizabeth R.
