        "text": "Post-Baccalaureate Certificate in Classical Studies\n\nThe Post-Baccalaureate Certificate in Classical Studies offers students who have completed a Bachelor's degree the opportunity to achieve the fluency in reading ancient Greek and Latin required to pursue graduate study in Classics or related fields such as ancient history, archaeology, art history, philosophy, theology, or medieval studies. Coursework at the post-baccalaureate level also introduces some of the scholarship of Classical texts in which graduate study engages. Post-baccalaureate students become able to clarify their professional goals while they sharpen their technical skills and become better qualified to advance on the path they choose.\n\nLinguistic preparation is a critical factor in students' success in the early years of their graduate programs. Committed and otherwise well-qualified students who have been able to begin serious language study only toward the end of their undergraduate careers face a competitive disadvantage. The Post-Baccalaureate Certificate is a credential with which to surmount it.\n\nProgram overview\n\nLoyola's program is shaped in terms of competence attained, rather than a fixed period of study. Candidates for the Post-Baccalaureate Certificate may pick among three tracks, depending on the goals with which you are pursuing the Certificate:\n\nTrack 1. Classical Studies (Greek and Latin): The certificate will be awarded to students who successfully complete two semesters totaling 18 \"target\" credit-hours at the 300-level in both Classical languages with a GPA of 3.0 in the program: \"target\" study in these two semesters should include at least 6 credit-hours in 300-level ancient Greek author-courses and at least 6 credit-hours in 300-level Latin author-courses. We recognize some students will have attained intermediate or advanced competence in both languages before their post-baccalaureate study and will need only two semesters of target-level work; some may have had the opportunity to become proficient in one Classical language but have weaker preparation in the other; and some may need to begin their study of both languages and will need additional coursework to complete the Certificate. Our program will meet you where you are in your own career of study, and work with you to bring your skills and knowledge up to the next stage. The course of study for students entering at the \"target\" level and wishing to finish in one year would look like this:\n\nSemester One Semester Two 300-level Latin 300-level Latin 300-level Greek 300-level Greek Classical Studies course of your choice Classical Studies course of your choice\n\nTrack 2. Ancient Greek: The certificate will be awarded to students who successfully complete two semesters totaling 18 \"target\" credit-hours at the 300-level in Greek with a GPA of 3.0 in the program: \"target\" study in these two semesters should include at least 6 credit-hours at the 300-level in ancient Greek author-courses and 6 credit-hours in composition or directed studies. We recognize some students will have attained intermediate or advanced competence in Greek before their post-baccalaureate study and will need only two semesters of target-level work, others may need more time; Our program will meet you where you are in your own career of study, and work with you to bring your skills and knowledge up to the next stage.\n\nSemester One Semester Two 300-level Greek 300-level Greek 300-level Greek (typically Greek Composition or a Directed Study) 300-level Greek (typically Greek Composition or a Directed Study) Classical Studies course of your choice Classical Studies course of your choice\n\nTrack 3.

The scholarship allows for 25% scholarship on tuition with no limitations on continuous enrollment (students can stop and start within their 10 year window).

For program costs, see Tuition & Fees.\n\nStudents can begin in either the fall or spring semester. Application is on a \"rolling\" basis, which means that applications are reviewed as they are completed. There is no official deadline, but get your materials in several weeks before the semester begins to ensure that there is time for processing.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more information about the Post-Baccalaureate Certificate in Classical Studies, please e-mail Dr. Leanna Boychenko, the Post-Baccalaureate Program Director.\n\nFAQ: Post Baccalaureate in Classics\n\nOur course of study is designed to serve as a flexible bridge between the completion of undergraduate study and graduate school (e.g., in Classics, Ancient History, Archaeology, Philosophy, Medieval Studies, the Classical Tradition, etc.). The point is to use the program to prepare intellectually, to address weaknesses, and to develop strengths. The focus is on the acquisition of the ability to read and research in Latin and Ancient Greek. If your goals do not require facility in these ancient languages, then you may be looking for something else. Please contact us to see if our program is right for you.\n\nAdmission is on a \"rolling\" basis, so there is no firm deadline: we view applications as they arrive. Process time varies; for fall admission, getting your complete application in at least by mid-July should be sufficient.\n\nYes! Students can begin at any level in either or both languages. It will take longer than a year to earn a certificate because you will need to get through beginning and intermediate levels before hitting the \"target\" level.\n\nTo finish the certificate in a single year, you will need to take at least three courses each semester (and the language courses must be at the 300-level). However, many of our students take one or two classes at a time; most students hold jobs while in the program and like the flexibility. Graduate School fees vary depending on the number of credit hours (see Tuition & Fees).\n\nFor the certificate, 12 of the 18 credit hours must come from 300-level language courses. 6 hours (= 2 courses) can and should come from other courses in classical studies. You can tailor these courses to your interests. Many students take the upper-level undergraduate capstone course that provides a deep overview of Greek and Latin literature. Other students have taken seminars in archaeology, ancient history, or philosophy. The Department of Modern Languages and Literatures offers summer courses in German and French for Reading Knowledge. We will work with you to find the best courses to align with your future goals.\n\nFor the 2022-2023 academic year, we are pleased to announce a $5,000 tuition scholarship to promote diversity and inclusion in Classical Studies. To apply for this scholarship students must identify as members of an underrepresented or marginalized group (including but not limited to racial and ethnic groups, LGBTQIA+, first generation college students, low income students, and students with disabilities). Application due date is April 29th 2022; apply online here.\n\nWe also have department funds to support student conference travel and research. For more information, see Fellowships and Other Opportunities.\n\nBeginning with fall 2022 enrollment, Loyola University Chicago has launched a new alumni scholarship called “Returning Ramblers.” The program is available to all graduates of the last decade who have completed a bachelor’s degree and will be seeking their first Loyola masters or post-baccalaureate certificates. The scholarship allows for 25% scholarship on tuition with no limitations on continuous enrollment (students can stop and start within their 10 year window). There is no special application form or any application requirement changes for this program. For more information, see https://www.luc.edu/gpem/returningrambler/.\n\nWe do not offer accelerated language courses at this time. We often recommend that students with no language experience look into an accelerated summer program in their region to get a headstart (the University of Chicago offers such courses in this city, but there are many other programs throughout the country and abroad).\n\nAt this time, we do not offer any courses in Latin or ancient Greek online, during the summer, or in the evening. We do offer some undergraduate-level classical civilization courses in the evenings and during the summer. Typical course schedules can be found under the Academics tab on our homepage.\n\nStudents have gone on to graduate programs in Classics, Humanities, Classical Archaeology, and the Classical Tradition at a variety of universities including UCLA, the University of Chicago, The University of Virginia, the University of Iowa, the University of Colorado, Kings College London, and the University of Indiana. Other students pursued careers in Latin teaching at the pre-collegiate levels."
