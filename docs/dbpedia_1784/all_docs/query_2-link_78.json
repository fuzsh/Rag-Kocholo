        "text": "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nColumbus, Mississippi – The School of Education at The W (Mississippi University for Women) celebrated excellence and achievement at its Awards Day event.\n\n“Awards Day is an opportunity to honor the exceptional accomplishments of our School of Education community, showcasing our commitment to fostering excellence, leadership, and lifelong learning in education,” said Dr. Marty Hatton, Dean of the School of Education.\n\nThe ceremony, held on April 17th, celebrated the outstanding contributions of students throughout their undergraduate education experiences. Significantly, The W’s education programs distinguish themselves through their Residency courses, providing students with unparalleled classroom experience compared to other programs in the state. These courses are integrated alongside academic classes, facilitating a cohesive block schedule that empowers students to apply newly acquired pedagogical skills in practical, hands-on learning environments in area classrooms.\n\n“Congratulations to all of our students for their outstanding achievements. The W is known for turning out top-notch educators in our region who are ready to serve our communities. We are proud of each of you for your dedication to being the best teacher possible,” said Dr. Bob Fuller, Chair of the School of Education.\n\nAwards were given to the most outstanding students in early childhood, the four elementary education blocks, and the elementary and secondary internships. Nominations are based on an exceptional all-around student model. Faculty members and residency mentor teachers submitted nominations and narratives for candidates within their respective semester academic blocks. Student nominations were based on: personal characteristics (energy level, enthusiasm, cooperation, scholarship, character, initiative, overall general attitude), professional characteristics (professional attitude & poise, enthusiasm for teaching, self-confidence, evidence of growth & improvement), skills in methodology (classroom management, methods & techniques, lesson planning, knowledge of subject matter, skills in student evaluation, discipline toward students).

Duals and Duels: Mathematical Abstraction and Programming\n\nMathematics and Computer Science are about abstraction, and understanding abstractions can be complex. We will explore several abstractions in this course, but each time from the point of view of constructing algorithms in a programming language. Implementing algorithms that depend on abstract concepts can help us understand those concepts and recognize the limits of our understanding. In this course, we will use a mathematically based approach to programming to reinforce our knowledge of interrelated mathematical topics such as Logic, Set Theory, and Abstract Algebra. We will start with simple principles and increase our understanding based on intuition and experiment. What is required? you should be curious, love mathematics, think logically, be willing to be wrong and correct your misunderstanding, be eager to explore new and challenging ideas, and help your fellow scholars succeed.\n\n2. Agents of Change: Exploring Legal and Ethical Principles in Healthcare Practice\n\nThis introductory course is designed to give scholars a deeper understanding of the legal and ethical principles governing healthcare practice. Participants will explore the intricate intersection of law and ethics within healthcare, gaining valuable insights to navigate complex situations and make informed decisions.\n\nIn the first week, scholars will learn the critical ethical terms in healthcare: autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, veracity, fidelity, confidentiality, informed consent, and cultural competence. Scholars will participate in assigned debate topics to explore perspectives and foster a thoughtful and respectful discussion. In the second week, scholars will research standards of care in healthcare practice and the implications of failing to follow best practices. A mock trial will be conducted whereby students will actively participate in the roles of defendant, defense and prosecution attorney, bailiff, judge, and jury members. The case will involve an accusation of criminally negligent homicide by a registered nurse. The “jury” scholars will have to decide if the defendant is guilty based on the cases presented by the “defense” and “prosecution” scholars.\n\n3. Shaping Communities: An Exploration of Urban Planning in Mississippi\n\nEvery town and city in Mississippi has been shaped by someone, whether through deliberate action or unintentional inaction. This trend continues, but there’s still time for change. Much like the adage about planting a tree whose shade you may never enjoy, our communities require planning. Moreover, planning extends beyond just roads and trees. Modern urban planning covers various topics, including housing, parks, and grant programs. Planners can specialize in designing multi-modal transportation or addressing homelessness. The field is remarkably diverse, with many professionals possibly not fully realizing the extent of its breadth.\n\nThis class aims to delve into urban planning within our community. The course will commence with the foundational topics of “why” and “how” planning originated in the United States. Subsequently, we will explore common theories and themes before delving into how these concepts have been implemented in our state. Finally, we will explore practical planning methods, even for those not in the profession. The course will culminate in a mock public hearing, simulating various common planning requests.\n\n4. Unraveling the Mysteries of the Mind\n\nWhat is memory? How is your memory? Is there a limit to our memory capacity? How does forgetting affect your everyday life? How would your life be different if you could not create new memories? What if you could remember nearly every day of your life? How can brain injury sufferers remember how to tie their shoes but not recall\n\nanything mentioned during a conversation with a friend? Are there different types of memory? How reliable and accurate do you think your memory is? What is the biological basis for memory? Who would you be without your memories? What is more critical: your experiences or your memories of them? These questions are but a few that we will explore on this journey down memory lane. Don’t forget to bring an open mind!\n\n5. Changes in the Fairy Tale Genre across Time and Space\n\nDid you grow up reading the Brothers Grimm? Have you learned about popular fairy tales from movies satirizing them rather than from the classic versions themselves? Whatever your current familiarity with the genre, you’ll still find something new to learn in this course. In just two weeks, we will read fairy tales from “Little Red Riding Hood” to the lesser-known variants of “Cinderella.” We will also read a few poems and watch advertisements that use fairy-tale allusions for effect. The class will discuss the following elements that make a fairy tale a fairy tale: What goes “too far” and makes a work not a fairy tale? Can a story from the first century B.C.E. be the same as one from 2002? Who are the typical protagonists of a fairy tale? How do fairy tales differ by country of origin and for different audiences? What do these stories illustrate about other cultures? By the end of the course, you will produce a modern-day fairy-tale revision in the genre of your choice, along with a brief explanation of why you made the creative choices you did.\n\n6. Exploring the World of Tabletop Gaming\n\nYou may be familiar with mainstream family game night games, such as Monopoly, Scrabble, and Sorry. Hobby games provide endless hours of entertainment as family and friends gather to explore new lands in Catan, spend some time at Summer Camp, plan out a train route in Ticket to Ride, or grow a collection of houseplants in Planted. To many, playing tabletop games is a niche pastime, but there is something for everyone. Scholars of all backgrounds are invited to learn more about tabletop gaming, even without gaming experience. In the course, scholars will learn about the various game mechanics used in tabletop games and spend time playing games to see these mechanics in action. They’ll also learn about some game designers and artists behind the games. By the end of the course, you’ll leave itching to start building your tabletop game collection!\n\n7. Crafting Change Through Music-Making\n\nCrafting Change Through Music Making is a course designed to channel the creative power of music as a catalyst for positive change. Participants will explore music composition, recording, and mixing through advanced Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs), and students will also learn how to practice and perform various piano pieces. Students will engage in hands-on practice, bridging theory with the practical aspects of music creation. The class will\n\nalso examine how music-making can be a vehicle of change. We will look at historical music examples at the forefront of various societal changes (including but not limited to political, social, and religious).\n\n8. Radical Courage: Black Legislators in Mississippi’s Reconstruction Government\n\nThey were farmers, teachers, ministers, blacksmiths, and lawyers. Some were born free in the North, while others were born enslaved in the counties they represented. Some were highly educated, and others had been forbidden by law to be taught to read. Many came to Mississippi to help their Southern brothers and sisters build a more just government, and many were driven out by violence only a few years later. You will learn about the courage, vision, and legacies of the first African American men to serve in Mississippi’s state legislature during Reconstruction.\n\n9. Changing the World Through Video Games\n\nVideo games have been around for decades, growing more popular and varied yearly. In addition to game consoles, they can also be found on PCs, phones, tablets, and even TV streaming devices. Although they are often dismissed as nothing more than mindless entertainment, good video games make you think in ways you might not have a chance to in real life.\n\nThis course examines video games and how they affect people who play them. We’ll start with a brief overview of video gaming history and culture. Then, we’ll look at both potentially damaging and positive effects. One of the specific areas we’ll examine is how gamers change and cause change through interacting with video games and other gamers.\n\n10. Sourdough: It’s Alive!\n\nSourdough Bread starter is made of living organisms that need to be cared for daily, like a pet. And yet, these living jars of flour, water, and yeast also create some of the yummiest foods to eat: Bread! Imagine having your starter and learning how to make bread rise in several ways. It is a science and an art that anyone can learn to do. Food (especially bread) brings all kinds of people together. Breaking bread together is a sign of peace. Through the scientific method, students will explore the Microbiology and science of making bread and, later, the creative aspect of making bread through recipe experimentation. You will first learn about how breads are made in various cultures, past and present, and later use what you know about bread to create your recipes through prediction and experimentation. You will use science to create a home-cooked masterpiece."
