In this course we will investigate the transition of the Roman Empire from the heights of geopolitical and economic dynamism to a period of extraordinary turmoil through the lens of the later Antonine (AD 160-193) and Severan (AD 193-235) dynasties. How did the Empire devolve from a seemingly strong, economically stable state, to one pushed to the brink of collapse? Were the forces that drove destabilization largely internal or external? How much did the actions of the emperors and their cohorts contribute to the decline? Did environmental factors (climatic or epidemiological) play a role? These are some of the themes we will explore in our quest to understand what led to the Crisis of the Third Century – a period that included war on all fronts, financial turmoil, socio-political unrest, religious persecutions, and ecological change. Good attention is given to the Imperial phases before and after the period in question for a proper longue durée approach to our analyses. Every Tuesday and Thursday I will ask you to engage your interdisciplinary brains – that is, be ready and willing to draw on literary, documentary, archaeological, numismatic, and epigraphic evidence, as well as paleoenvironmental and archaeogenetic data – so that we as group gain a better understanding of how Rome nearly lost its Empire.\n\nCLS 0087 Special Topics In Old World Archaeology.

This course is an introduction to the major disease events of the ancient Mediterranean region. We will approach this topic with an interdisciplinary mindset, combining historical and scientific evidence to investigate historical epidemics of the Greek and Roman worlds. A review of the primary source written evidence is crucial to our understanding of ancient symptomatology and diagnosis, and archaeological evidence, paleogenomic research and epidemiological studies will help us evaluate the impact of disease outbreaks – whether related to human health, demography, economy or culture – on Mediterranean communities. Scrutinizing the scholarly literature and debates on ancient pestilences will be essential to our understanding of the present historiographical trends, ones which we will indeed weigh in on. Reconstructing climates and environments of the ancient Mediterranean will play a big role in our analyses, given environmental change is often closely linked with outbreaks of disease. The fundamental aim of this course is to explore how ancient epidemics and pandemics may have emerged, to evaluate their influence on Graeco Roman societies, and to discern and gain and understanding of societal resilience in the face of such epidemiological events.\n\nCLS 0187 Problems In Classical Archaeology.
