        "text": "The New York Times on the Web: Books\n\nBy PAUL LEWIS\n\nho killed Homer?\n\nThe question is at the heart of a bitter debate among scholars over who is to blame for the crisis in classics education. With a declining interest in ancient studies at universities across the country and a fear that the disciplines are becoming irrelevant, classicists worry that the founding ideas of Western literature, art and philosophy are losing ground.\n\nIn fact, \"Who Killed Homer: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom\" is the title of a new book due out next month that argues that American classicists are \"peewee gladiators\" who have \"lost sight of any real intellectual or educational goal\" through their obsession with \"tenure, promotions, leave, salary, visiting lectureships, positions on editorial boards, prestige.\"\n\n\"The dumbing down of the classics is under way,\" says John Heath, a professor of classics at Santa Clara University, who wrote the book with Victor Davis Hanson. \"There will be nothing left in a generation.\"\n\nFor more than a decade, classicists have been slugging it out in articles, books and conferences over who's murdering Homer.\n\nThe quarrel erupted in print in 1987 when America's premier classical publication, the American Journal of Philology (a love of words and literature; it comes from the Greek words philein and logos) warned it would not publish articles lacking \"rigorous scholarly methods\" or based on \"mere speculation.\"\n\nThe editorial was widely seen as a declaration of war by traditionalist scholars on the modernists or \"theorists,\" who apply contemporary analytical techniques drawn from the worlds of feminist studies, poststructural criticism and multiculturalism to the ancient world.\n\n\"I thought the traditional approach just fine,\" says Georg Luck of Johns Hopkins University, who wrote the controversial editorial, \"but I had no idea saying so would produce such an uproar.\"\n\nThe traditionalist approach is based on a close study of ancient languages and literature. At its base is the belief that the values of ancient Greece and Rome provide the \"essential core of Western learning in language, reasoning, ethics, esthetics and philosophy,\" as Heath and Hanson put it.\n\nFeminists and theorists, on the other hand, stress the ancient world's elitism, indifference to women, tolerance of slavery and glorification of bellicose white male heroes instead of democracy, free inquiry and human rights. They argue that they are making the classics more relevant by asking the same questions about the ancient world that we ask about our own, questions about the social, political and economic forces shaping literature and thought.\n\n\"To keep Latin and Greek vital we must keep asking new questions,\" says Barbara K. Gold, a classicist at Hamilton College. \"Purist approaches are no longer attractive to students. We can't ignore the multicultural campus.\"\n\nAmy Richlin, a feminist scholar at the University of Southern California, says: \"I want to inject the excitement we find in feminist and other modern studies into the classics. I want to invigorate it.\"\n\nFor many theorists, the great texts of antiquity have no immutable significance and can mean different things to different readers. While some find in antiquity the origins of the glories of Western civilization, others see what Nancy Sorkin Rabinowitz of Hamilton College called \"a formative moment of misogyny\" in her introduction to \"Feminist Theory and the Classics\" (Routledge, 1993).\n\nTina Passman of the University of Maine, who describes herself in the same book as \"a lesbian, radical feminist and classicist,\" berated traditionalists for failing to see that the male-dominated ancient Greek world was built on the ruins of an earlier \"harmonious matriarchal/matrilineal culture.\" Other essays in the volume include \"The Primal Mind: Using Native American Models for the Study of Women in Ancient Greece\" and \"The Case for Not Ignoring Marx in the Study of Women in Antiquity.\"\n\nSuch approaches infuriate traditionalists, who accuse theorists of imposing a preconceived political agenda on the ancient world that denigrates Greek and Roman civilization.\n\n\"How will students learn to love the classics when their professors write incomprehensibly about a world they hold responsible for all the neuroses of present-day society?\" asks Hanson, who teaches Greek at the California State University at Fresno.\n\nThis struggle between traditional and multicultural approaches to scholarship exists in practically every discipline on campus, from literature to mathematics. What creates special bitterness among the classicists, however, is each school's belief that its rivals are to blame for falling student enrollments, declining linguistic standards and the \"watering down\" of the core discipline through the use of translations and the inclusion of ancillary subjects like mythology and ancient art.\n\n\"These are perilous times for classics in America,\" Bruce Thornton of California State University at Fresno wrote in a survey of the dispute last year. He said the classics were caught between \"a utilitarian right,\" which doubts its relevance, and the \"multiculturalist left,\" which accuses the ancients of \"patriarchy, oppression, sexism, colonialism and God knows what other crimes.\"\n\nAmy Richlin laments weak linguistic skills, saying many students starting the classics without high school Greek \"just don't have time to really master it.\"\n\nTo some extent, the quarrel between traditionalists and theorists may be distracting both schools from the real common enemy they face. This is what is known as \"presentism\" or the tendency to focus on very recent events.\n\nAs an example, Richlin cites next year's planned Berkshire Conference of Women Historians, saying that 80 percent of the discussion will be on events after 1789 and half on those after 1900.\n\n\"The growth of presentism is the greatest danger we face,\" she warns. \"Historical studies which ignore 3,000 years of history will not bring good results.\"\n\nWhile no one denies that the classics have declined in prestige and importance on university campuses, other scholars question whether the future is as dark as the Cassandras warn.\n\nMatthew S. Santirocco of New York University says the classics can infiltrate mainstream university studies through multidisciplinary courses, where texts are read in translation and students study nontraditional aspects of the ancient world like the role of women, theater and art. NYU's Ancient Studies Center offers interdisciplinary courses on such themes as death and the ancient world and Alexander the Great and the lands he conquered.\n\nMeanwhile, a recent study by Richard A. LaFleur of the University of Georgia suggests the classics are holding up reasonably well and may even be in for a revival. While the number of enrolled college Latin students had fallen from 39,600 in 1965 to 24,398 by 1972, it has remained fairly stable since then and reached 25,897 in 1995, the last year surveyed.\n\nGreek fared less well with the number of enrolled undergraduates dropping from 19,500 in 1965 to 16,272 in 1995. But again it has held fairly stable at around that level since 1986.\n\nLaFleur's study, suitably entitled \"Latina Resurgens,\" also shows public secondary school Latin enrollments rising 15 percent between 1990 and 1994 to the highest level since 1970, with a similar increase at private schools, suggesting more classics majors are in the pipeline. New York City private schools often tout their Latin classes as a lure for prospective parents. \"Gaudeamus, igitur\" is his conclusion. (That's \"Therefore, let us rejoice,\" in case you were wondering)."
