        "text": "2023-2024\n\nAnnual Grose Lecture: Central Italian Urbanism in the Age of the Roman Expansion\n\nNicola Terrenato, University of Michigan\n\nDate: Thursday, April 25\n\nTime: 5:30 p.m.\n\nLocation: Campus Center 163c (1st Floor), UMass Amherst\n\nThe urbanization of the Italian peninsula happened in two major waves in the course of the first millennium BCE. In the ninth through sixth centuries, cities developed apace, dotting the Tyrrhenian and Ionic coasts, while also pushing inland in Latium and especially in Etruria. Another massive wave happened in the fourth through second centuries, the same period in which the Roman expansion in Italy was unfolding. While the scholarly focus has long been on the colonies created by Rome in this period, archaeological work has been showing that those foundations are only a facet of a much broader trend toward urbanization, which produced an integrated urban system spanning the entire length of Italy and reaching across the entire central Mediterranean. The relationship with the political unification of the peninsula, long believed to be the prime mover, is particularly entangled and open to different interpretations. The new urbanism had distinctive features and even shortcomings, especially when compared with contemporary Greek cities. When recent archaeological results are pieced together, a fascinating embryology of Italian urbanism comes into view.\n\nNicola Terrenato is the Esther B. Van Deman Collegiate Professor of Roman Studies at the University of Michigan, and director of the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology.\n\nReception to follow.\n\nBuilding Community at Ancient Eleon: Monumental Constructions of the Mycenaean and Archaic Ages\n\nProfessor Bryan Burns, Wellesley College\n\nDate: Tuesday, March 26\n\nTime: 5:15 p.m.\n\nLocation: Herter 301, UMass Amherst\n\nGreek-Canadian excavations have documented several phases of activity at Eleon, a small settlement in eastern Boeotia. This talk will present the architectural projects that redefined the site at two critical moments. During the Early Mycenaean era, a group of tombs were consolidated within a perimeter wall and then mounded over by a massive mud brick tumulus. In the Late Archaic period, a complex polygonal wall framed the location of religious activity on the elevated acropolis, part of a larger network encircling the dispersed constructions of a lower town.\n\nElectra\n\nImage\n\nDate: Thursday, February 29; Friday, March 1; Saturday, March 2\n\nTime: 8:00 p.m.\n\nLocation: Holden Theater, Amherst College\n\nFinally, a family more dysfunctional than yours! After a decade of reliving the night her mother killed her father, Electra confronts her moment of truth when her long-lost brother returns to avenge their father’s murder.\n\nDirected by Classics/Theater and Dance major Caspian Rabaia ‘24 for their senior project, Nick Payne’s 2011 adaptation of Sophocles’s tragedy stars a cast of seven students, featuring Petra Brusiloff ‘24 in the title role for her senior project. Set designed by Jeff Bird, costumes designed by Kyle Artone, lights and sound designed by Julian Brown.\n\nFree and open to the public. Reserve tickets here.\n\nSeneca's First Intervention: The Consolation to Marcia\n\nJames Ker, University of Pennsylvania\n\nDate: Thursday, March 7\n\nTime: 5:00 p.m.\n\nLocation: Herter 301, UMass Amherst\n\nIn his earliest surviving work, The Consolation to Marcia, Seneca publicly intervenes in the time of a Roman woman's grief and also in Rome's literary, social, and political space. This paper re-examines the consolation, particularly its opening pages, and sets it in the context of Seneca's early public life.\n\nSongs of Praise for Mortals: What They Can and Cannot Do\n\nMary Lefkowitz, Professor Emerita of Classical Studies, Wellesley College\n\nDate: Thursday, November 30\n\nTime: 4:30 p.m.\n\nLocation: Babbott Room (Octagon 200), Amherst College\n\nMary Lefkowitz, retired after forty-six years of teaching at Wellesley College, has remained an active scholar of Ancient Greek literature and culture. Recent publications include The Greek Plays, co-edited with James Romm (Penguin Random House, 2016) and Euripides and the Gods (Oxford University Press, 2015), which was shortlisted for the Phi Beta Kappa Gauss award in 2016. Earlier works released in new editions over the past fifteen years include Women's Life in Greece and Rome, co-edited with Maureen B. Fant (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2016), The Lives of the Greek Poets (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2012) and Women in Greek Myth (2007). She is a Trustee of the American School of Classical Studies in Athens.\n\nThis lecture is sponsored by the Georges Lurcy Lecture Series Fund at Amherst College and the Amherst College Department of Classics.\n\nThe Anax Altar: Cult, Myth, and Worship on the Peak of Mount Lykaion\n\nKyle Mahoney, Swarthmore College\n\nDate: Thursday, November 16\n\nTime: 4:30 p.m.\n\nLocation: UMass Amherst, Herter 301\n\nThis lecture focuses upon the earliest use of the great Ash Altar dedicated to Zeus Lykaios atop the southern peak of Mt. Lykaion, the mountain believed to be the birthplace of Zeus by some ancient sources, located in the region of Arcadia in the Peloponnese of Greece. In addition to providing a review of the recent archaeological discoveries made by the Mt. Lykaion Excavation and Survey Project, we will explore the possible beliefs underlaying the material culture and residue of sacrifices found within the altar across the late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age periods (ca. 1550-700 BCE).\n\nProf. Mahoney has taught at Swarthmore since 2018 and is also Assistant Director of the Mt. Lykaion Excavation and Survey Project, having worked at the site since 2010.\n\nOld Houses, New Viewers: Domestic Renovation in Roman Sicily\n\nNicole Berlin, Assistant Curator at the Davis Museum, Wellesley College\n\nImage\n\nDate: Monday, November 6\n\nTime: 5:30 p.m.\n\nLocation: Dwight 101, Mount Holyoke College\n\nThis talk explores three case studies (i.e., three houses) that were originally built in the Late Hellenistic period then renovated in the Roman Imperial period. Berlin considers wall painting, architecture, and mosaics to understand how Sicilian homeowners negotiated between the island's rich tradition of native Hellenism and the island's incorporation into the Roman Empire.\n\nRemembering Octavia, People’s Princess of Neronian Rome\n\nLauren Ginsberg, Duke University\n\nImage\n\nDate: Thursday, October 26\n\nTime: 5:00 p.m.\n\nLocation: Seelye 201, Smith College\n\nOctavia grew up as the daughter of one emperor, died the wife of another, and remained exceedingly popular with the people throughout her short life. When Nero tired to divorce her, the people of Rome rioted in the streets, leading to her brutal execution. So why is Octavia rarely included in studies of women in the early Roman empire?\n\nThrough a series of case studies, both textual and material, this talk will uncover the evidence for Octavia's popularity during her life, and the evidence for her enduring cultural memory at Rome after her death, including on theatrical stages of Rome.\n\nLauren Donovan Ginsberg is an associate professor of classical studies and theater studies at Duke University. Her work focuses on the intersection of Roman Literature (especially drama) and Roman cultural memory. She is the author of Staging Memory, Staging Strife: Empire and Civil War in the Octavia (Oxford University Press, 2016) and is currently writing a biography of Octavia for OUP's Women in Antiquity Series. Her work has been supported by the American Academy in Rome, the Loeb Classical Library Foundation, and the Memoria Roman project.\n\nThis lecture is supported by the Smith College Endowed Lecture Committee and the Department of Classical Languages and Literatures.338 BCE and the Transformation of Ancient Afro-Eurasia\n\nDan-el Padilla Peralta, associate professor of classics and associated faculty in African American studies\n\nand affiliated faculty in Latino studies, Princeton University\n\nImage\n\nDate: Tuesday, October 17\n\nTime: 4:30 p.m.\n\nLocation: Amherst College, Pruyne Lecture Hall (Fayerweather 115)\n\nThe second half of the 4th c. BCE witnessed a series of dramatic transformations throughout Afro-Eurasia, foremost among them a rapid escalation in state formation processes and the emergence of new (or newly aggressive) territorial empires. Concentrating on the 330s BCE, this lecture will pair a thick description of these transformations—focusing on changes to practices of citizenship, slavery, and religious observance—with an attempt at their analysis.\n\nDan-el Padilla Peralta researches and teaches the religious history of the Roman Republic and Empire, global histories of slavery and citizenship, and critical race theory’s bearing on the historical and contemporary study of classics and classicism. He is the author of Undocumented: A Dominican Boy’s Odyssey from a Homeless Shelter to the Ivy League (Penguin 2015) and Divine Institutions: Religions and Community in the Middle Roman Republic (Princeton 2020). He has co-edited Rome, Empire of Plunder: The Dynamics of Cultural Appropriation (Cambridge 2017) and Making the Middle Republic: New Approaches to Rome and Italy, c. 400 – 200 BCE (Cambridge 2023). He is currently working on \"Classicism and Other Phobias,\" the subject of his 2022 W. E. B. Du Bois Lectures at Harvard. He is a volume co-editor for The Cambridge History of the African Diaspora and sits on the board of\n\nthe RaceB4Race collective.\n\nThe annual Hugh Hawkins Lecture is hosted by the Amherst College Department of History and, this year, supported by the Amherst College Department of Classics.\n\nManaging and Curating Yale University's Numismatic Collection\n\nDr. Benjamin Hellings, Head of the Department of Numismatics, Yale University Art Gallery\n\nDate: Thursday, October 5\n\nTime: 5:30 p.m.\n\nLocation: UMass Amherst, Herter Hall 601\n\nFor Zoom attendance, register here: https://tinyurl.com/y8dbuncy\n\nLarge and active numismatic collections are few and far between: in the United States, there are only a handful of actively managed ones, with most being housed in a university. Yale University’s Numismatic Collection is preeminent and is unquestionably the largest university collection in the country. Although there are many numismatists and specialists of the ancient world who study coins, numismatic curators who work in the United States are much fewer in number. This presentation will explore the history of the Yale Numismatic Collection, including coins from the Dura-Europos excavations, as well as the historic and present curation of the collection, including the management of physical storage, coin identification, publications, acquisitions and donations, exhibitions, and teaching. A behind-the-scenes overview of the first and only permanent numismatics gallery at an American university, which opened in May 2022, will also be presented.\n\nThe AIA National Lecture / William E. Metcalf Lecture in Numismatics is sponsored by the Western Massachusetts Society of the AIA and hosted by the UMass Amherst Department of Classics.\n\n2022-2023\n\nThe Sentient Sponge: Between Natural History, Art History, and Philosophy\n\nArchaeology, Museums, and War\n\nBrian Rose, James B. Pritchard Professor of Archaeology at the University of Pennsylvania\n\nImage\n\nDate: Saturday, April 1, 2023\n\nTime: 11:00 a.m.\n\nLocation: Graham Hall, Smith College (Brown Fine Arts Center)\n\nThe wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria during the last two decades have profoundly influenced scholars and how they deal with the art and material culture of antiquity. In this lecture, archaeologist C. Brian Rose draws on his own experiences with museums, foreign wars, and archaeology to discuss the ways in which the past now dominates the present. He gives an overview of cultural heritage destruction and preservation programs in conflict zones and considers the subject of museums and repatriation requests in an age of increasing nationalism.\n\nThe 30th Annual Phyllis Williams Lehmann Lecture is sponsored by the Western Massachusetts Society of the Archaeological Institute of America.\n\nDecolonizing Museums and the Case of the \"Elgin Marbles\": Exceptionalism vs. Solidarity?\n\nProfessor Elizabeth Marlowe, Colgate University\n\nImage\n\nDate: Thursday, March 23, 2023\n\nTime: 5:30-7:00 p.m.\n\nLocation: Kendade Hall, Room 305, Mount Holyoke\n\nHow have the arguments supporting the return of the Parthenon Marbles from the British Museum to Greece changed over time? Does the alleged Western \"exceptionalism\" of the sculptures help or harm the larger cause of the decolonization of museums?\n\nElizabeth Marlowe is associate professor of ancient and medieval art, chair of the Department of Art and Art History, and director of the Museum Studies Program at Colgate University. Her path-breaking book, Shaky Ground: Context, Connoisseurship and the History of Roman Art (2013), has generated a subfield of “groundedness” as a way of thinking about ancient art. Professor Marlowe has become a leading voice on the modern uses of the classical past, the art market, cultural property, and antiquities looting and repatriation.\n\nThis lecture is presented by the McCulloch Center for Global Initiatives and co-sponsored by the Mount Holyoke College Art Museum and the Departments of Art History and International Relations.\n\nModel Minorities and Perpetual Foreigners in Euripides’s Heraclidae\n\nDr. Katherine Lu Hsu, College of the Holy Cross\n\nImage\n\nDate: Tuesday, March 7, 2023\n\nTime: 5:30 p.m.\n\nLocation: 601 Herter Hall, UMass Amherst\n\nSponsored by the UMass Department of Classics.\n\nEcology and Citizenship in Antiquity\n\nKevin Corrigan, Emory University\n\nDate: Wednesday, March 8, 2023\n\nTime: 5:30 p.m.\n\nLocation: Herter Hall 601, UMass Amherst\n\n“The desire for more destroys what one has,” according to the ancient atomist Democritus (fr. 224) some 2,400 years ago. Democritus’s words seem particularly appropriate for our contemporary world, a world of unlimited material desire, dwindling material resources, and an ever-growing gap between the rich and the poor. In fact, strange as it might seem, just about all the major principles of ecology (a modern science that seeks to balance desire and resources) can be found in some form or other in the earliest recorded forms of human thinking. Does this mean that the ancients were wiser than we are or just that we are reading back our own preoccupations into earlier times? The aim of this talk is not to treat of the whole of ancient thought or to tell scientists or philosophers how to do science and philosophy, but to trace certain connections that have been virtually lost between the ancient and modern worlds and to build a bridge between two forms of practice and thought that have seemed light years apart: contemporary science (specifically, ecology and environmental philosophy) and Neoplatonism. Prof. Corrigan argues that we need to rediscover some of its fundamental thinking if our species is to survive into the next century, even into the second fifty years of the present century.\n\nKevin Corrigan is Samuel Candler Dobbs Professor of Interdisciplinary Humanities in the Department of Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies (associated in Classics, Philosophy, and Religion) at Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia. A student of A. H. Armstrong, former Dean, and Professor of Philosophy, of St. Thomas More College, University of Saskatchewan, he works in the fields of Classics, Philosophy, History, Religion, Theology and Literature. He has written many articles ranging over the history of philosophical and religious thought from the Presocratics, Plato, and Aristotle, through Patristics, late Antiquity and Medieval thought, to Whitehead, Bergson, Levinas, and Derrida in contemporary thought. Among his recent books are Plotinus. Ennead VI.8: On the Free Will of the One, text, translation and commentary, for Las Vegas/New York/Zurich: Parmenides Press, 2017 (with John D. Turner); Love, Friendship, Beauty and the Good: Plato, Aristotle, and the Later Tradition, Wipf and Stock, Cascade Books, USA/UK, 2018; and Plotin. Oeuvres complètes, Traités 30- 33, Tome 2, Collection des Universités de France, Série grecque, 482. Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 2020 (with Jean-Marc Narbonne, Lorenzo Ferroni, John D. Turner, Zeke Mazur, Simon Fortier).\n\nThe Five College Faculty Seminar in Late Antiquity’s annual lecture is made possible by generous support from the Amherst College Religion Department, the UMass History Department, and Five Colleges, Inc.\n\nArtifacts and Archaeological Processes: The Lives and Afterlives of Objects at Pompeii\n\nMyth as Method: An American Poet in Greece, through Modern Crises\n\nA. E. Stallings\n\nDate: Wednesday, November 16\n\nTime: 5:30-7:00\n\nLocation: Integrative Learning Center 240, UMass Amherst\n\nA. E. Stallings is an American poet and translator who lives in Athens, Greece. She has published four volumes of poetry (most recently Like, which was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize) and has a selected poems (This Afterlife) forthcoming in December from FSG. She has also published three volumes of verse translation, including Lucretius's The Nature of Things, Hesiod's Works and Days, and the Pseudo-Homeric Battle Between the Frogs and the Mice. She is currently working on a Georgics for Liveright. She has received fellowships from the Guggenheim and MacArthur foundations and a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. She is also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Since 2015, she has run a poetry workshop for refugee women at the Melissa Network for Migrant Women in Athens.\n\nThe lecture, free and open to the public, is sponsored by the UMass Department of Classics with support from the Classics Departments of Amherst, Mount Holyoke and Smith Colleges.\n\nHolding the Bag: A Contested Symbol in the Funerary Art of Late Roman Gaul\n\nJane Sancinito, UMass Lowell\n\nDate: Tuesday, November 15\n\nTime: 5:30-7:00 p.m.\n\nLocation: Herter Hall 601, UMass Amherst\n\nThis paper discusses a piece of common iconography in late Roman Gaul and Germania: purses or moneyboxes. Numerous figures, including known merchants and artisans, chose to be depicted holding these objects in a break from contemporary Italian practice, where even moneychangers avoided using images of money. Prof. Sancinito will discuss several historical theories about the meaning of these objects, and then propose a new way of reading the images that fits into a larger argument about the changing definition of greed in the second through fourth centuries CE.\n\nImperial Psychopathologies: Thucydides, Pushkin, Daneliya\n\nSeeing the Roman Empire through Ancient Souvenirs\n\nKimberly Cassibry, Wellesley College Department of Art\n\nImage\n\nDate: Friday, October 21\n\nTime: 4:00 p.m.\n\nLocation: Herter Hall, Room 227, UMass Amherst\n\nThe UMass Amherst Classics Department invites Five College faculty and students to attend a lecture by Professor Kimberly Cassibry, the author of the recent monograph, Destinations in Mind: Portraying Places on the Roman Empire's Souvenirs (OUP, 2021).\n\nMaterial Encounters in a Hellenistic Egyptian Fortification\n\nJennifer Gates-Foster, Associate Professor, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\n\nImage\n\nDate: Thursday, October 6\n\nTime: 5:00 p.m.\n\nLocation: Campus Center 205, Smith College\n\nDuring the third century BCE, the Ptolemaic state created a network of forts and waystations that linked the Red Sea coast with the Nile Valley by providing support to caravans crossing the mountainous Eastern Desert. These remote outposts varied in size and infrastructure but shared a common purpose—to facilitate travel and protect state interests in the resources of the region and lands beyond, especially the horn of Africa and lands to the south. The population of these desert fortresses is revealed both through the rich textual record provided by ostraca recovered in the trash dumps and rooms, but also the material traces of the fort’s residents whose activities and connections are revealed through the contents of the abandoned quarters. Through this material, we discover a diverse community of transients that includes Egyptians, nomadic desert-dwellers and emigres from the Mediterranean and beyond.\n\nPlease note: audience masking is required.\n\nOtherness and the Edges of Race: Orientalisms from the Emperor Nero to Modern America\n\nProf. Timothy Clark '12, Boston University\n\nImage\n\nDate: Thursday, September 29\n\nTime: 4:30 p.m.\n\nLocation: Paino Lecture Hall (Beneski 107), Amherst College\n\nIn recent years, events at home and abroad have demonstrated the urgent need to highlight and uproot structures of racism and inequality that dominate American life. Academic complicity in these structures has also come under increased scrutiny. How might fields like classics and history support renewed efforts to combat racism, Orientalism, and other forms of “othering,” and contribute to the creation of a more just and equitable society?\n\nIn this lecture, Professor Timothy Clark ’12 will show how comparing the ancient and modern worlds sheds new light on the conceptual frameworks that underpin racism and othering. Professor Clark will show how Roman officials under the emperor Nero and the American legal system in the 21st century situated Eastern “others” in conceptual and legal positions where their exact status was left ambiguous. He will explain why this form of Orientalism persists and how it personally impacted ancient Eastern nobles and modern Iranian-Americans alike. This lecture will show the dangerous consequences that result when the categories we create for different ethnic and racial groups are taken for granted.\n\nThis lecture is sponsored by the Departments of Classics, History, and Asian Languages and Civilizations, and the Georges Lurcy Lecture Series Fund at Amherst College.\n\nOperation Demeter: What Italy’s Largest Antiquities Bust Reveals About Archaeological Looting Today\n\nDr. Fiona Greenland, University of Virginia\n\nArchaeological Institute of America 2022-2023 National Lecture Program\n\nImage\n\nDate: Tuesday, September 27\n\nTime: 5:30 p.m.\n\nLocation: 601 Herter Hall, UMass Amherst\n\nZoom link: https://umass-amherst.zoom.us/j/93635373215\n\nIn 2018, the Italian Art Squad announced the conclusion of a four-year investigation into a vast looting network that traversed five European countries. \"Operation Demeter\" was the largest investigation in the unit's history. It recovered 20,000 artifacts valued at some 40 million Euros and resulted in the arrest of 23 people. What did Operation Demeter teach us about the looting and selling of archaeological materials? Today, nearly five years onward, what has changed—if anything—in the looting landscape?\n\nDr. Fiona Rose Greenland is Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of Virginia, and founder and director of the CURIA Lab (Cultural Resilience Informatics and Analysis). She received a DPhil in Classical Archaeology from the University of Oxford and a PhD in Sociology from the University of Michigan. She works at the intersection of cultural sociology, comparative and historical sociology, and archaeology to investigate how archaeological materials feature in modern social life.

Fortification walls, natural features, the edges of orthogonal grids, and religious borders like the pomerium all worked together to distinguish the urban from the non-urban, to define the city versus everything beyond it. The dead made up one of the primary groups regulated by such boundaries. From the codification of Rome’s earliest law code, the Twelve Tables, in the fifth century BCE, the dead were banned from the city proper and their tombs restricted to the zone outside it. Nevertheless, from the first century BCE Roman cities across the Italian peninsula began to develop suburbs, densely urbanized neighborhoods located beyond their traditional urban boundaries. Here, houses and shops, workshops and sanctuaries, rubbish dumps and major public buildings jostled cheek-to-jowl with the tombs of the dead, which grew increasingly monumental in the same period. This lecture examines the suburbs of Roman Italy as a historical phenomenon, calling on recent archaeological evidence to reconstruct these neighborhoods, which effectively urbanized the dead and tied them into patterns of daily life. Considering the factors that led to the development of suburbs, I argue that tombs were key; these were not simply passive memorials, but active spaces that both facilitated and furthered the social and economic life of the city.\n\nProfessor Emmerson received her PhD from the University of Cincinnati, specializing in Roman archaeology. She studies cities, and is especially interested in \"marginal\" areas and activities, like waste management and the treatment of the dead. Her first book, Life and Death in the Roman Suburb (Oxford 2020) won the James R. Wiseman Book Award in 2022, the Archaeological Institute of America's top honor for new books.

This lecture explores some of the ways in which preliminary results of this work can be used to explore how the city's inhabitants created their collective and individual identities through their daily practice, for example through their culinary practices and in selecting consumer goods. Professor Nevett suggest that extending this method of analysis to other ancient communities offers a means of evaluating cultural similarities and differences between them.\n\nLisa Nevett (PhD Cambridge) is a classical archaeologist whose particular interest is in using the material culture of the Greek and Roman worlds as a source for social history. To date, her research has focused on domestic architecture, and she has used the construction, decoration and articulation of space within houses to shed light on broader social questions. She is co-director of the Olynthos Project, a multi-disciplinary archaeological field project focused on the Classical city of Olynthos in northern Greece, and she has been involved in other survey and excavation projects in Greece, Turkey, Libya and Britain.\n\nThis lecture is sponsored by the UMass Amherst Department of Classics.

Carter of the University of Texas for more than half a century. Metaponto’s chora may thus rightly boast to be perhaps the most thoroughly investigated of any city-state in the ancient Greek world. This path-breaking research on the dynamic landscape of the countryside forms the backdrop to Dr. Rebecca Miller Ammerman’s study of the statuettes and relief plaques made of baked clay that generations of worshippers dedicated as votive offerings at the rural sanctuary of Pantanello. Dr. Ammerman will illustrate the different angles from which she has analyzed this large assemblage of figured terracottas in order to shed light on the nature of the cult practiced at Pantanello and the concerns that worshippers hoped would be addressed by the patron deity of the sanctuary to whom they made their votive gift.\n\nRebecca Miller Ammerman is the Roy D. and Margaret B. Wooster Professor of the Classics at Colgate University. She is currently the director of excavations at the Temple of Athena as part of the North Urban Paestum Project. Her archaeological research concentrates on the material evidence for the practice of cult in Magna Graecia with a special focus on the dedication of terracotta figurines and reliefs. She is the author of The Sanctuary of Santa Venera at Paestum II. The Votive Terracottas (Ann Arbor, University of Michigan Press, 2002) and has published several studies on excavated assemblages of terracottas from Metaponto, such as those in The Chora of Metaponto 7. The Greek Sanctuary at Pantanello, J.C. Carter and K. Swift, eds.

In “Superstitions and Folk-lore of the South” and “Post-Bellum—Pre-Harlem,” Charles W. Chesnutt acknowledges the debt The Conjure Woman owes to Afro-folkloric traditions and practices, but neither of these essays acknowledges the debt The Conjure Woman owes to classical mythology. Although these two works of literary criticism are silent on Chesnutt’s engagement with the classics, his fiction, journals, essays, speeches, and marginalia are not. They demonstrate that he deploys the classical myths and histories of the ancient world to critique the injustices of racial slavery, Reconstruction, and the Nadir. I argue that \"The Goophered Grapevine\" is a revision and fusion of “Transformation of the Maenads” and “The Rape of Persephone,” two Greco-Roman myths. Furthermore, I argue that \"Po' Sandy\" is a revision of “Of Isis and Osiris,” an ancient Egyptian myth. The antebellum Southern settings, gothic plots, and enslaved protagonists of \"The Goophered Grapevine\" and \"Po' Sandy\" mask the classical myths which these stories subversively revise. Chesnutt uses this narrative strategy to associate the capitalist destruction of the natural world with the dismemberment of slave marriages, families, psyches, and bodies, his purpose being to promote African American intellectual, moral, and civic aptitude in the Nadir by debunking the postbellum myths of benign slavery, contented slaves, and African American conjugal and familial apathy. This examination of Chesnutt’s subversive classicism amends the prevailing theories of the mythological provenances of \"The Goophered Grapevine\" and \"Po' Sandy\" and thereby constitutes a unique and corrective intervention in the interpretive history of The Conjure Woman.\n\n​Trent Masiki earned his PhD in Afro-American Studies from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst in 2017. He has an MFA in Creative Writing from Emerson College and an MA in English from Texas A&M University. His research interests focus on African American and Latino American literature and culture from 1865 to the present.\n\nPolychromy, New (and Old) Technologies, and the Parthenon Metopes\n\nImage\n\nDate: Tuesday, April 5, 2022\n\nTime: 5:00 p.m.\n\nLocation: Pruyne Lecture Hall (Fayerweather 115)\n\nDr. Katherine Schwab will speak on a selection of Parthenon metopes to analyze technologies, past and present, to better understand the original compositions and their polychromatic appearance. The original ninety-two carved marble panels displayed four major mythological battles prominently positioned above the columns on all four sides of the temple. Today we have a greatly altered impression due to their current state of damage and location. From graphite drawings to Virtual Reality, we are in a position to better understand these nearly life-sized compositions that formed the public face of Athena’s temple on the Athenian Acropolis.\n\nDr. Schwab is Professor of Art History & Visual Culture in the Department of Visual and Performing Arts, Director of the Classical Studies Program, and Curator of the Plaster Cast Collection for the Fairfield University Art Museum, at Fairfield University in Connecticut.\n\nA specialist in ancient Greek art and archaeology, her research focuses on the Parthenon sculptural program, especially the metopes. Scans of her metope drawings are on permanent display in the Acropolis Museum. The original graphite drawings formed a traveling exhibition in the US, An Archaeologist’s Eye: The Parthenon Drawings of Katherine A. Schwab, from 2014 to 2018 organized by the Fairfield University Art Museum in collaboration with Creighton University and the Timken Museum in San Diego. Her drawings and photographs have formed three separate exhibitions at the Greek Consulate General in New York City. Most recently she has served as a scholarly consultant concerning the Parthenon metopes for the Virtual Reality project, Athens Reborn: Acropolis, made by www.flyoverzone.com, with an anticipated launch in April 2022. Dr. Schwab’s other primary scholarly interest concerns the meaning and function of ancient hairstyles beginning with the Caryatids on the Athenian Acropolis.\n\nHer lecture will supplement the content of Professor Rebecca Sinos's spring course, Archaeology of Greece.

Grose Memorial Lecture with Dr. Dimitri Nakassis, professor and chair of classics at the University of Colorado Boulder.\n\nForty years ago, in his book Europe and the People Without History (1982), the anthropologist Eric Wolf impatiently asked, “If there are connections everywhere, why do we persist in turning dynamic, interconnected phenomena into static, disconnected things?” We could ask the same question today. Our scholarly tools and institutions typically replicate disconnected Greeks, Romans, and Phoenicians instead of an interconnected Mediterranean. While much progress has been made, this paper argues that the study of the ancient world needs to rigorously identify and destroy the categories that prevent us from understanding what Dan-el Padilla Peralta has recently (2021) described as “the most richly imagined fabrics of the past.”\n\nDr. Nakassis specializes in the textual production of early Greek communities and is the co-director of the Western Argolid Regional Project (WARP). His book, Individuals and Society in Mycenaean Pylos (2013) illustrates through the application of a new prosopographic methodology that palatial organization and social status within the Pylian kingdom were more fluid than accounted for in previous models. He has also published on Homer and Hesiod, Greek religion and history, archaeological survey, and Linear A. In 2015 he was named a MacArthur fellow.\n\nA reception will follow in Herter Hall 301.\n\nPhilomela’s Tongue: Speech, Silence, and the Voice of Gender\n\nImage\n\nDate: Friday, October 22\n\nTime: 4:00 p.m.\n\nLocation: UMass Amherst, Herter 601\n\nThe UMass Classics Department is pleased to announce a lecture by Professor Daniel Libatique (College of the Holy Cross) entitled “Philomela’s Tongue: Speech, Silence, and the Voice of Gender.” There will be a reception to follow the lecture, also in Herter Hall.

Investigating Images Of Athletic Women In Ancient Etruscan Art\n\nFebruary 25, 2021\n\n5:00 p.m. (EST)\n\nBridget Sandhoff of the University of Nebraska offers a virtual lecture organized through the University of Massachusetts and sponsored by the Archaeological Institute of America.\n\nAny mention of the human body in the art of classical antiquity often conjures up images of well-muscled Greek athletes such as Polykleitos’s Doryphoros, Myron’s Diskobolos and the Riace bronzes. The primacy of the idealized nude male body is ubiquitous in Hellenic culture. Though Etruria emulated multiple facets of Greek civilization, the Etruscans modified Greek models to fit their own, distinctive needs. The same is true for Etruscan representations of the human body.\n\nThe artistic record provides a wealth of information from which we can determine how the Etruscans viewed the body and recorded it. A general survey of their art shows a clear debt to Greek examples, yet a closer examination reveals a distinctive somatic aesthetic for women that flouts conventional paradigms. Female representations are diverse, ranging from elaborately clothed women to nude females rife with muscle. On several occasions, nude men accompany the muscular women. This lecture examines the nude, athletic female somatotype that becomes popular in fourth century BCE Etruria, its frequent pairing with a nude, male partner, and the reason for such imagery.\n\nJohn Kachuba speaks on Shapeshifters: A Brief History from Antiquity to Modern Times (Virtual Lecture)\n\n2019 - 2020\n\nCanceled.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 26 7:00 PM\n\nTHE FRANK AND LOIS GREEN SCHWOERER '49, ANNUAL HISTORY LECTURE\n\nGuilt and Enslavement Habits of Thought from the Ancient World to Modern America\n\nNoel Lenski, Yale University\n\nThis lecture will examine the mental connection between notions of guild and justifications for slavery. From Noah's \"curse of Ham,\" to the mals usos of medieval Spain, to vani marriages in South Asia, to convict leasing in 20th-century America, the attribution of guilt has been used to lock people into bondage across time and space globally. We will explore the consequences of this mental slide continuing right up to contemporary America's carceral state.\n\nProfessor Noel Lenski, a historian of the Roman Empire in late antiquity, has produced important studies - such as Failure of Empire: Valens and the Roman State in the Fourth Century A.D. and Constantine and the Cities - that highlight the roles of emperors and responses to their autocratic power. He has also focused on slavery in, e.g., \"Violence and the Roman Slave\" (2016) and \"Peasant and Slave in Late Antique North Africa, c. 100-600 CE\" (2017).\n\nSMITH COLLEGE, FORD HALL- RM. 240\n\nCancelled.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 2 5:30 PM\n\nReading Plautus with Frederick Douglass\n\nMatthew Leigh, St. Anne's College, Oxford\n\nDWIGHT 101, MOUNT HOLYOKE COLLEGE\n\nCancelled.\n\nSATURDAY, APRIL 4\n\nThe 30th Annual Phyllis Williams Lehmann Lecture\n\nBrian Rose, University of Pennsylvania\n\nSMITH COLLEGE\n\nCancelled.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 9 5:00 PM\n\nRebecca Ammerman, Colgate University\n\nAMHERST COLLEGE, BENESKI BUILDING- RM. 107 (Paino Lecture Hall)\n\nCancelled.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 16 5:00 PM\n\nThe Sixteenth Annual David F.

Since the “women in antiquity” movement took off in the 1980s, feminist scholars have sought to understand the role of such gendered violence in Roman culture and its implications for the reception of ancient Rome in the Western classical tradition, given how many societies continued to draw inspiration from Roman practices and ideas throughout modernity. This talk will focus on the episode traditionally known as “the rape of the Sabine women,” in which the first Romans staved off the extinction of their new community and established Rome’s version of marriage, but did so by obtaining their wives through a mass bride abduction. Unlike most of the women who fall victim to violence in Rome’s founding myths, the Sabine women not only survive their assault; by the end of their story, as told by the Roman historian Livy, they’ve won universal respect and recognition for saving both new and old communities, which they risk their own lives to defend. We’ll explore how such a triumph could result from a story that begins with assault and consider why these women’s remarkable rise in status is not how people tend to remember this story today.\n\nSponsored by the Georges Lurcy Lecture Series Fund at Amherst College and the Department of Classics.\n\nAMHERST COLLEGE, BENESKI HALL, PAINO LECTURE HALL\n\n2018-2019\n\nMONDAY, APRIL 29 5:00PM\n\nRevenge of the Trojans~ Polemon of Ilion, Demetrios of Skepsis, and Pergamon's Quest for Authenticity\n\nNoah Kaye, Michigan State University\n\nThe Library of Pergamon competed with its Alexandrian rival for books and personnel, seems to have\n\nleft behind its own textual traditions of Homer and Aristotle, and is even reputed to have given us the\n\nword “parchment.” What good did it ultimately do for its funders, the Attalid kings? It has often been\n\nassumed that the Library served chiefly to burnish the Hellenic credentials of an ethnically Anatolian\n\ndynasty. The most pressing ideological need, however, was reinforcement of a shaky claim to rule\n\nwestern Anatolia. To understand how the Attalids sought to achieve this, we must revisit what Rudolph\n\nPfeiffer called Pergamon’s “antiquarianism” and reinterpret the well-publicized affinity of Pergamon’s\n\nkings with the Trojan past as a play for Priam’s former subjects.\n\nUMASS AMHERST, HERTER HALL 301\n\nFriday, April 26th\n\nTransforming History: Generic Interaction in Greek and Roman Historiography in Honor of Professor Elizabeth Keitel\n\nSpeakers:\n\nJane Chaplin- When Historians Make History\n\nTimothy Joseph- Ubique lamenta: The place of lament in Latin epic and historiography\n\nChristina Kraus- Multiplying disasters: the many-fronted, multiplex bellum in Livy 5\n\nJohn Marincola- Asinius Pollio and the Roman Revolution\n\nUMass Amherst, Campus Center\n\nAdditional details to follow.\n\nTUESDAY, APRIL 23rd 5:00 PM - 6:30 PM\n\nThe Radicalism of Roman Decline and Renewal: The History of a Dangerous Concept\n\nEdward Watts, Department of History, University of California San Diego\n\nNotions of Roman decline and calls for Roman renewal appears continually in Roman literature stretching from the time of Plautus and Cato the Elder to the end of Byzantium. This talk examines three distinctive instances in which ideas about Roman decline emerged to justify a particular sort of radical Roman renewal. The first instance spans the last years of the Republic and early principate of Augustus and sees Rome's first emperor respond to the declinism of the late Republic with aggressive statements about the Roman renewal he brought. The second concerns the so-called Altar of Victory controversy of 384 AD in which pagans root calls for the restoration of traditional religion in a series of claims about famine and declining crop yields. And the third centers around the sixth century Constantinopolitan and ninth-century Carolingian attempts to use Roman decline to justify aggressive actions against people who saw themselves living in a Roman Empire. These are, then, three cases of Roman decline that confuse the standard narrative of the decline and fall of the Roman Empire that we have all become familiar with. And they also show how deeply connected claims of decline and calls for radical renewal usually are.\n\nAMHERST COLLEGE, FROST LIBRARY, CENTER for HUMANISTIC INQUIRY (2nd floor)\n\nFRIDAY, APRIL 12TH 2:30 - 4:30 PM\n\nHaute Couture in Ancient Greece: The Spectacular Costumes of Ariadne and Helen of Troy\n\nBernice R.

The depictions of the life after death reveal the variety of conflicting ideas in the Greek tradition, from the continuative existences after death that preserve cultural memories to the compensatory afterlives that rectify the incompleteness of justice in the mortal world to the grand cosmic visions that bring together life and death, mortal and immortal, chthonic and celestial, into a single system. All these imaginings of afterlife make use of familiar tropes, names, and images from the Greek mythic tradition, and each of the authors of an afterlife vision thinks with and through an imagined underworld in different ways for different ends.\n\nAMHERST COLLEGE, BENESKI BUILDING, PAINO LECTURE HALL (RM.#107)\n\nTUESDAY, APRIL 9TH 12:00 PM\n\nConsent and Consensuality in Ancient Greek and Roman Marriage\n\nJudith Hallett, Professor Emerita of Classics, University of Maryland\n\nSMITH COLLEGE, SEELYE HALL 304\n\nLunch will be provided.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 4TH 6:00 - 7:30 PM\n\nText, Intertext, Paratext: Reading the Emperor Julian\n\nAlan Ross, University of Southampton\n\nAMHERST COLLEGE, VALENTINE HALL, LEWIS-SEBRING LOUNGE\n\nSATURDAY, APRIL 6TH 11:00 AM\n\nThe 29th Annual Phyllis Williams Lehmann Lecture\n\nThe Archaeological Institute of America, Western Mass.

In antiquity, of course, the engaging and often arresting appearance of these sculpted images was defined in no small part by their nuanced lifelike painting and rich polychrome detailing. Although now most of the painting and other forms of polychromy that defined these images in antiquity is lost to us, detailed examination increasingly allows us to glimpse vestiges of ancient polychromy and thereby how the visual language of portraits was defined not by form alone but in combination styles of coloration varying from lifelike naturalism to sumptuous radiance. This talk presents case studies of marble portraits – royal, imperial, and private – with extant polychromy that, upon close examination, elucidates the definition and meanings of these subjects in antiquity.\n\nAmherst College, Beneski Earth Sciences Building, Paino Lecture Hall\n\nTUESDAY, MARCH 20th 5:30 - 7:00 PM\n\nJohn Matthews, Yale University\n\nThe Foundation of Constantinople: Four Problems and Three Answers\n\nJohn Matthews is John M.

Known as the ‘birthplace of Zeus’ by ancient authors, the mountain top sanctuary served as a primitive ash altar for burnt animal sacrifices to Zeus, and the lower mountain meadow hosted famous athletic festivals.

Seelye Hall, Room 106\n\nTUESDAY, OCTOBER 24th 4:30 PM\n\nIsabella Tardin-Cardoso, University of Campinas, Brazil\n\nThe Saint and the Sow: Poetics of Illusion in a Brazilian Imitation of Plautus\n\nWritten in 1957, the popular Brazilian comedy O Santo e a Porca (The Saint and the Sow) has its classical source of inspiration already stated in its subtitle: a “Northeastern Imitation of Plautus”. Its author, Ariano Suassuna (1927-2014), alludes in particular to the play Aulularia (The Pot of Gold) by Titus Maccius Plautus (3rd- 2nd century BC). As we shall see, the allusiveness of the play goes beyond its subtitle: it is apparent in Suassuna’s plot, in his imitation of Plautine speaking names, word-games, and other comic techniques. Professor Tardin-Cardoso will first illustrate the way the Brazilian play calls attention both to its proximity to and distance from its Roman model. By means of such a dialogue, Suassuna underlines (just as Plautus had) his inspirations in popular culture. She will also argue that in Suassuna’s reception of the way Plautus represents deception in his theater, the modern playwright provides a fresh kind of illusion that reflects the image of life and Brazilian culture represented in his drama.\n\nAmherst College, Fayerweather Hall #115 (Pruyne Lecture Room)\n\nTHURSDAY, OCTOBER 19th 5:00 PM\n\nElizabeth Marlowe, Colgate University\n\n(author of Shaky Ground: Context, Connoisseurship and the History of Roman Art.

The presence of large datasets promotes the possibility of a new line of inquiry perhaps called digital archaeology. In this talk, Professor Chang will be discussing the ongoing research taking place on Mochlos, an island settlement off the coast of Crete which experienced unbroken and continuous occupation from 3000-1500 BCE. In particular, we will examine the ways in which mathematics and statistics might be useful to support or refute hypotheses about architecture, cultural practices, and economy. Conversely, we will deliberate the limitations of mathematics in archaeological studies in such cases as network theory.\n\nAmherst College, Seelye Mudd- rm.#206.\n\nTHURSDAY, OCTOBER 12th 5:00 PM\n\nFive College Faculty Seminar in Classics (5CFSC)\n\nThe theme will follow that of the November 3rd UMass Colloquium\n\n\"The Tenth Muse: Resonances of Sappho in Greek and Latin Poetry\"\n\nUMass, Herter 301\n\n2016 - 2017\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 20th 5:00 PM\n\nBulgaria's Cultural Heritage: Thrace, Greece, Rome\n\nVyara Kalfina, Sofia University, Bulgaria\n\nUMass Amherst, Integrated Learning Center- S240\n\nJANUARY 24 ~ MAY 28\n\nExhibit: The Legend of the Lares\n\nMount Holyoke College Art Museum\n\nAPRIL 1 through DECEMBER, 2017\n\nPlants of Pompeii: Ancient and Modern Medicinal Plants\n\nThis exhibit features plant portraits created by Victoria I and Lillian Nicholson Meyer for Jashemski's book A Pompeian Herbal.

Yet visitors to sites along the Bay of Naples walk through a landscape that appears untouched by slavery. Scholars and tourists alike have been trained to recognize owners and the free in the archaeological record of ancient Italy and to overlook and \"un-see\" slaves living and laboring in the same place. In her book, The Material Life of Roman Slaves (co-authored with Sandra Joshel), Dr. Lauren Hackworth Petersen seeks to make slaves appear or, more accurately, searches for ways to see them – to make slaves visible where evidence tells us they were in fact present. In her lecture, Dr. Petersen will discuss slavery in ancient Rome and explore the presence of the enslaved at Villa A at Oplontis.\n\nSmith College, Hillyer Hall, Graham Auditorium\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 13th 4:30 PM\n\nFlowers for the Dead: An Attic Funerary Stele in the Mead Art Museum\n\nSeth Estrin, Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts at the National Gallery of Art\n\nEmotion does not usually play an important role in our interpretations of ancient sculpture today.

STAR, Middlebury College\n\nVisions of the end of the world, familiar today from several sources ranging from the Bible to Hollywood films, are largely absent from Greek and Roman literature. There is one striking exception: the philosophy and tragedies of Seneca the Younger (c. 4 BCE-65 CE). After a survey of some of the ways in which the fate of humanity and the cosmos was conceived in the ancient world, we will focus on the visions of the end in Seneca’s writings. Our investigation will consider the various motives—poetic, rhetorical, philosophical, and political—that may lie behind Seneca’s fascination with universal destruction.\n\nAmherst College, Beneski Museum, Paino Lecture Hall (rm. #107)\n\nTHURSDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 4:00 PM\n\nFifth Annual Classical Legacy Lecture and residency\n\nPerforming the Past: Shakespeare and Classical Literature from Humanist Schoolroom to Early Modern Stage\n\nLEAH WHITTINGTON, Harvard University\n\nMassachusetts Center for Interdisciplinary Renaissance Studies\n\nCANCELLED.

Nine years later, the Greeks learn from an oracle that in order to win the war they must rescue him from island. When they finally come for him, the wounded warrior must overcome nine long years of festering resentment and shame in order to accept help from the very men who betrayed him.\n\nThe reading will be followed by discussion with panelists from the local civilian and military communities, and a facilitated town-hall style audience discussion.\n\nAbout Outside the Wire\n\nOutside the Wire is a social impact company that uses theater and a variety of other media to address pressing public health and social issues, such as combat-related psychological injury, end of life care, prison reform, political violence and torture, and the de-stigmatization of the treatment of substance abuse and addiction.\n\nTo date, there have been more than 250 performances of Theater of War for military and civilian communities throughout the United States, Europe and Japan. Over 50,000 service members, veterans, and their families have attended and participated in Theater of War performances and discussions.\n\nVisit Outside the Wire’s website: www.outsidethewirellc.com to find more information about the project, watch a short video of a performance, and find out about recent and upcoming performances.
