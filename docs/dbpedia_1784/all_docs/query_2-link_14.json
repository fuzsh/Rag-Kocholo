        "text": "This seminar takes a participatory approach to ancient Greek theater, exploring the dual nature of drama as performance and script. It provides a historical overview of the extraordinary Athenian fifth century (BCE), emphasizing ways theater interacts with art, law, myth, and politics. Theatrical exercises and performances complement several writing assignments.

Honors version available.\n\nThis seminar will study the great tragic heroines of ancient Greek drama, focusing on Clytemnestra, Medea, Alcestis, Phaedra, the Trojan Women, Antigone. Students will also read a contemporary novel, by Fay Weldon, that engages many of these mythic women.

Students will survey the entire period, but will look in particular at four specific periods in the city's life from the early second century CE until the present day.\n\nThe myth of Helen of Troy has inspired countless creative responses, from Homer's Iliad to Hollywood's Troy; all of them raise questions about the value of beauty and love within society. The course requires no prior knowledge of the classics, although you should be familiar with Homer's Iliad and Odyssey.\n\nIntroduction to the history and culture of ancient Greece, from the Bronze Age to the end of the Roman period, through field study of historical and archaeological sites in Greece.\n\nAn investigation of the history, aesthetics, politics, and influence of theater in the ancient Greek and Roman world, with attention to themes of power, passion, rhetoric, resistance, gender, and identity. The course also includes a substantial practical component, with students taking on a number of the dramaturgical roles involved in the production of ancient drama.\n\nCourse examines the life of women in ancient Rome, from the first beginnings of the organized community in Rome through the early Empire, a period of about 900 years.

Students gain a background in the history and culture of the classical world that grounds critical analysis of the primary source evidence, both textual and material. By engaging with modern scholarship on ancient ideas about race and ethnic identity, students also learn to evaluate and critique secondary source material in their original contexts.\n\nAn introduction to classical civilization through study of the period in which it spreads beyond mainland Greece to influence and partially merge with the cultures of the Near East, Egypt, and Rome. Attention to history, literature, philosophy, and art. Lectures and discussion.\n\nAn introduction to classical civilization through study of the literature, history, and art of one of the most crucial periods in Roman history. Lectures and discussion.

The course will include some comparison of modern conceptions of ethnicity and depictions of group identities (in film, literature, and other media).\n\nCicero and Caesar provide a window into the end of the Roman Republic, and the end of the Republic provides a privileged ground for applying different methodologies of research (e.g. history, literature, political science, philosophy, etc.). This interdisciplinary course includes student presentations.\n\nThe topic of this course varies according to instructor, but in all cases is designed to bring together all departmental majors in their examination of a particular topic in the study of the ancient Mediterranean from an interdisciplinary perspective. Seminar format and research focus. Majors only, junior or senior standing required.\n\nThis course allows a student to design and execute an independent research project under the supervision of a faculty member. Although the specifics will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the student and the faculty supervisor, the project will normally involve the careful study of key primary sources and engagement with relevant scholarship, and culminate in a major research paper (around 25 pages) or a suitable equivalent in another format (e.g., website, video). Permission of the Instructor.\n\nThe study in English translation of selections from Herodotus, Thucydides, Livy, Tacitus, and others, with consideration of their literary qualities and their readability as historians.

Graduate students only."
