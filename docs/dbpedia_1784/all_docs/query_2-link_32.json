        "text": "General Education at UIC: An Overview\n\nGeneral Education is an important part of every undergraduate degree program. The General Education Program provides students with a breadth of exposure to the academic disciplines and serves as the foundation for the knowledge, skills, and competencies essential to becoming well-educated college graduates and citizens.\n\nThe program ensures a certain level of intellectual breadth, while at the same time allowing students the opportunity to select courses or clusters of courses around areas of their own interests. Specifically, the program:\n\nprovides intellectual guidance by identifying six broad areas of knowledge that correspond to the kinds of experiences that a liberally educated person should have.\n\nmakes clear to students what they are taking and why.\n\nis an open system that does not bind departments into one category. This model thus allows for the development of interdepartmental courses over time. It also allows students to gain interdisciplinary perspectives, which was one of the hoped for outcomes of revising General Education.\n\ngives individual colleges some freedom to adjust the General Education requirements to suit their own needs. Although there is a campus wide minimum of one course from each General Education category, colleges may add additional course requirements.\n\nThe General Education Program at UIC\n\nThe General Education Program at UIC is designed to serve as a foundation for lifelong learning. It also helps prepare students for the world beyond the college experience, a world in which one needs to be able to:\n\nthink independently.\n\nunderstand and critically evaluate information.\n\nanalyze and evaluate arguments.\n\ndevelop and present cogent written and oral arguments.\n\nexplore one’s own culture and history as well as those of others.\n\nunderstand, interpret, and evaluate the arts.\n\nthink critically about how individuals influence and are influenced by political, economic, cultural, and family institutions.\n\nThe General Education Program at UIC (sometimes referred to as Gen Ed or GE) has two main components: a grouping of core courses that are clustered around six themes and sets of required proficiencies. The specific requirements vary from college to college. All colleges, however, require a minimum of 24 semester hours of credit with at least one course in each of the six categories of General Education and proficiency in writing (as demonstrated by successful completion of ENGL 160 and ENGL 161 or by certain scores on placement or other tests). Note: Students may count up to two courses in their major toward their General Education requirements. If students have a double major, then two courses from each of the majors may be applied toward General Education.\n\nGeneral Education Proficiencies\n\nThe University Writing requirement is common across all colleges. Individual colleges may have additional General Education requirements and proficiencies. Students should consult their college and department sections of the catalog for information about fulfilling the General Education requirements as a required part of their degree program.\n\nUniversity Writing Requirement\n\nStudents must demonstrate proficiency in written English by earning passing grades in ENGL 160 and ENGL 161, or by achieving proficiency (see section on Demonstrating Writing Proficiency for a Waiver of ENGL 160 or ENGL 161) in one or both of these courses certified in writing by the Department of English. The Department of English reserves the right to require a student to take a preparatory course as a prerequisite for ENGL 160 if the student’s score on the Writing Placement Test reveals the need for such a course. Whenever questions arise with regard to the fulfillment of the University Writing requirement through transfer courses, a writing portfolio, or standard examinations, the Department of English will determine whether to grant the student an exemption from the requirement.\n\nStudents should consult their college section of the catalog for more information on fulfilling the University Writing requirement as part of their degree program.\n\nGeneral Education Core\n\nThe General Education Core includes the following six categories. This section of the catalog provides a description and list of courses for each category.\n\nAnalyzing the Natural World\n\nA central principle of a knowledge-based society is that, where possible, experimental tests should be designed to critically evaluate the accuracy of an idea or physical law. It is crucial that students understand both how accurate experimental results are obtained and how uncertainties in these results affect scientific conclusions. Courses in this category provide an understanding of scientific method and the factual knowledge necessary to develop hypotheses, to test them, and to distinguish those conclusions resting on unsupported assertion from those verified by sound scientific reasoning. Theories also play an important role in the way we see the world around us. In the natural sciences, theories are developed to explain experimental observation, form the basis for the design of further experiments, and provide the foundation for advances in technology. Mathematics provides appropriate tools (such as calculus) necessary to formulate the scientific theories.\n\nCourses in this category should introduce students to scientific and mathematical concepts and methods. They should be designed to facilitate the students’ ability to do one or more of the following:\n\nUnderstand and critically evaluate information and concepts in the natural and mathematical sciences.\n\nUse and understand scientific method to analyze ideas and obtain knowledge.\n\nAppreciate the value of and difference between scientific laws, theories, hypotheses, and speculation.\n\nUse scientific and mathematical reasoning to make relevant distinctions among ideas.\n\nThink critically about contemporary issues in science and technology.\n\nLogically and clearly communicate experimental results and observations to others.\n\nAnalyze quantitative information and draw conclusions from these analyses.\n\nCourse List Code Title Hours ANTH 102Introduction to Archaeology c,g4 ANTH 105Human Evolution c,g4 ANTH 238Biology of Women (Same as GWS 238) b,g,h3 BIOS 104Biology for Non-majors g4 BIOS 110Biology of Cells and Organisms4 BIOS 120Biology of Populations and Communities4 CHE 150Climate Engineering for Global Warming h3 CHEM 100Chemistry and Life g5 CHEM 105Chemistry and the Molecular Human: An Inquiry Perspective g4 CHEM 115Comprehensive General and Organic Chemistry5 CHEM 116Honors and Majors General and Analytical Chemistry I5 CHEM 118Honors and Majors General and Analytical Chemistry II5 CHEM 122Matter and Energy h,i3 CHEM 123Foundations of Chemical Inquiry I i2 CHEM 124Chemical Dynamics h,i3 CHEM 125Foundations of Chemical Inquiry II i2 CHEM 130Survey of Organic and Biochemistry5 CS 100Discovering Computer Science h3 DHD 206Disability, Inclusive Cities, and Environmental Accessibility f,h3 EAES 101Global Environmental Change4 EAES 105Climate, Contamination, and Chicago h2 EAES 111Earth, Energy, and the Environment4 EAES 200Field Work in Missouri2 EAES 203The Science and Rhetorics of Climate Change (same as ENGL 203) h3 ECON 106Tobacconomics b,h3 ECE 115Introduction to Electrical and Computer Engineering4 HON 130Honors Core in Analyzing the Natural World and Understanding the Individual and Society b,h3 HON 131Honors Core in Analyzing the Natural World and Understanding the Past c,h3 HON 132Honors Core in Analyzing the Natural World and Understanding the Creative Arts d,h3 HON 133Honors Core in Analyzing the Natural World and Exploring World Cultures e,h3 HON 134Honors Core in Analyzing the Natural World and Understanding U.S. Society f,h3 HON 145Honors Core in Analyzing the Natural World h3 HN 196Nutrition h3 KN 152Introduction to Exercise Physiology and Health3 MCS 260Introduction to Computer Science h4 MATH 125Elementary Linear Algebra h5 MATH 160Finite Mathematics for Business h5 MATH 165Calculus for Business h5 MATH 170Calculus for the Life Sciences h4 MATH 180Calculus I h4 MATH 181Calculus II h4 MATH 210Calculus III h3 MUS 116The Science and History of Sound in the Arts (Same as ART 116) h3 NATS 105Physical Systems in Earth and Space Science g4 NATS 106Chemical and Biological Systems g4 PHIL 102Introductory Logic h3 PHIL 105Science and Philosophy h3 PHYS 112Astronomy and the Universe g4 PHYS 116Energy for Future Decision-Makers (same as EAES 116) h3 PHYS 118Physics in Modern Medicine h3 PHYS 131Introductory Physics for Life Sciences I4 PHYS 132Introductory Physics for Life Sciences II4 PHYS 141General Physics I (Mechanics)4 PHYS 142General Physics II (Electricity and Magnetism)4 PUBH 120Public Health and the Study of Disease and Epidemics h3\n\nUnderstanding the Individual and Society\n\nThe primary goal of the Individual and Society requirement is to enhance understanding of the complex activities of individuals and their relations with each other and with groups, institutions, governments, media, and society. Courses within this category seek to:\n\nenhance knowledge and appreciation of the diversity of individuals, societies, and cultures\n\nadvance the understanding of human relationships within different contexts and\n\nexplore the gathering and assessing of knowledge within any social setting or activity.\n\nCourses present theories about the human activities and ideas and demonstrate how scholars use qualitative, quantitative, and humanistic methods to evaluate those theories. They may also explore the ways that knowledge is formed about the self and the world in historical, literary, philosophical, and scientific realms.\n\nCourses in this category should introduce students either to the complexities of the individual or the relationship of the individual to social structures. They should be designed to facilitate the students’ ability to do one or more of the following:\n\nRecognize, describe, and explain social institutions, structures, and processes and the complexities of a global culture and diverse society.\n\nThink critically about how individuals influence and are influenced by political, geographic, economic, cultural, and family institutions in their own and other cultures and explain how one’s knowledge and beliefs may differ from others.\n\nExplain the relationship between the individual and society as it influences\n\nindividuals’ cognition, ethics, social interactions, communication practices and affect; and\n\nthe quality of life of the individual, the family, and the community.\n\nExamine how literature, history, ethical systems, scientific inquiry, or communicative practice shape our knowledge and perception of individuals and social structures.\n\nUsing the most appropriate principles, methods, and technologies, gather and analyze previous inquiry regarding the relationships between individuals and society, draw logical conclusions about such inquiry, and creatively or scientifically apply those conclusions to one’s life and society.\n\nCourse List Code Title Hours ANTH 101World Cultures: Introduction to Social Anthropology e3 ANTH 215Anthropology of Religion (Same as RELS 215) e3 ANTH 216Medicine, Culture, and Society e3

Courses fulfilling this requirement acquaint students with issues involved in making, interpreting, analyzing, and evaluating written texts, musical works, visual and material culture, performing arts, and other media presentations in the context of the histories and cultures that have shaped and been shaped by their production. The aim is to develop the ability to read, experience, and view carefully, to think critically, to argue cogently and to communicate ideas effectively in written and oral form.\n\nAll cultures create stories, images, objects, built environments, dramas, music, etc. The study of such cultural products is an area with its own questions, techniques, and traditions. A student taking courses in this area can expect to study, in close detail, a number of significant works of literature, art, or other media. Courses in this category should facilitate a student’s ability to address one or more of the following questions:\n\nBasic issues of interpretation. How does a work mean anything? How does one determine meaning? How can a work have numerous meanings, often at the same time?\n\nQuestions of poetics. How do the traditions of genres and forms, materials and means of production, and philosophies and theories influence individual literary and artistic works and their interpretation?\n\nQuestions of value. How can such creative works be evaluated? How are critical vocabularies developed? How does a work come to be called a “classic”? How do new works and genres become accepted as art?\n\nQuestions of cultural and historical context. How do creative works relate to the societies in which they are produced and received? How do cultural roles of creative products, definitions of art, institutions, markets, and patronage affect the creation of works of architecture, art, music, literature, and other media?\n\nCourse

U.S. Society\n\nThe United States is a country that is often characterized by its diversity, including diversity of cultures, religions, classes, racial and ethnic backgrounds, and gender practices. The aim of this category is to study these diversities, explore the principles and experiences that unite us in the face of them, and perhaps most importantly, to examine critically the social, cultural, and political tensions that arise between that which unites and that which divides us. The goal is thus to understand our society and our political and economic systems, whether to gain knowledge of the past events that have shaped current ones, to gain the means to evaluate critically current policy and to shape future ones, or to develop a deeper understanding of the complexities of our current communities.\n\nCourses in this category should address some significant aspect of U.S. society as their central focus. They should be designed to facilitate the students’ ability to do one or more of the following:\n\nAnalyze aspects of U.S. society.\n\nAnalyze the communicative, political, social, economic, or cultural systems in the U.S.\n\nExplore the diverse communities—racial, ethnic, class, gender, religious, and sexual—that define cultural and political life in the United States.\n\nCritically examine the tensions among various groups within U.S. society.\n\nExplore contemporary governmental policies.\n\nAnalyze the role and influence of the U.S. in the world.\n\nStudy events, ideas, or movements that have influenced U.S. society."
