        "text": "SOSC 11400-11500-11600. Power, Identity, Resistance I-II-III.\n\n“PIR” is a social sciences general education sequence that introduces students to a variety of approaches in the interpretive social sciences. Appreciating this rich history requires openness to the methodological approaches advanced by thinkers of sometimes vastly different political orientations. We explore the philosophical foundations of modern social and political thought through critical, chronological study of original texts. As we begin, students encounter questions about the nature and limits of sovereign power and some of the ways identity and resistance take shape in relation to the state. As we extend our study of social science thematically and historically, the analytics of “power”, “identity”, and “resistance” continue to provide powerful lenses for understanding social institutions.\n\nSOSC 11400. Power, Identity, Resistance I. 100 Units.\n\nThe first quarter of this sequence opens with the theoretical basis of the modern, liberal state - social contract theory. We consider how state power was legitimized by common consent and how principles of freedom and equality were anchored in accounts of \"the state of nature.\" We also think about who was party to this original contract and ask whether the prosperity and protection of some was implicitly premised on the exclusion or exploitation of others. As we examine the protections offered by the liberal state against excessive, arbitrary power, we interrogate the limits of state power and ask at what point can we resist it? We trace these dialogues from the seventeenth century through the beginning of the nineteenth century. Texts vary by year and have included: Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Burke, Constant, Paine, Wollstonecraft, D. Walker, C.L.R. James\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nPrerequisite(s): These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped.\n\nSOSC 11500. Power, Identity, Resistance II. 100 Units.\n\nThe emergence of the liberal state that we examine in the Fall quarter accompanied the rise of commercial society and industrial capitalism, so in the Winter quarter we turn to theories of political economy. Generally, we are concerned with the relationship between labor and human nature, the organization of economic life, and the relationship between the state and the economy. We pay particular attention to the depiction of society itself as a market and how the capitalist mode of economic organization was linked both to new possibilities for human emancipation and new forms of exploitation and subjection. But we also ask how distinct is the modern form of capitalism? And what do the organization of labor and trade, and the distribution of resources outside of capitalism tell us about the ways power can operate in relation to economy? Texts vary by year and have included: Smith, Marx, Durkheim, Mauss, Hayek, Kropotkin, Arendt, Friedman, S. Mintz, E. Williams\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Winter\n\nPrerequisite(s): SOSC 11400. These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped.\n\nSOSC 11600. Power, Identity, Resistance III. 100 Units.\n\nIn the Spring, we bring the legacies of liberal theory, political economy, and their critique to bear on questions and problems that emerged from the late 19th century to the present. We take up a new dimension of society by thinking about its relationship to the self. How does morality rely on the inner discipline of individuals? How does individual identity rely on recognition by others? This question especially arises in the resistance movements we encounter in the histories of imperialism and totalitarianism. These widen the horizon on historical claims to liberty and equality along lines of race and gender. Finally, from forms of social domination we move to the human domination of nature in which students consider social-scientific approaches to the unstable boundaries between human and non-human worlds. Texts vary by year and have included: Hegel, Tocqueville, Nietzsche, Freud, Fanon, DuBois, Arendt, M.L. King, Foucault, Beauvoir, and C. Korsgaard\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Spring\n\nPrerequisite(s): SOSC 11500. These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped.\n\nSOSC 12400-12500-12600. Self, Culture, and Society I-II-III.\n\n“Self, Culture, and Society” introduces students to a broad range of social scientific theories and methodologies that deepen their understanding of basic problems of cultural, social, and historical existence. The sequence starts with the conceptual foundations of political economy and theories of capitalism and meaning in modern society. Students then consider the cultural and social constitution of the self, foregrounding the exploration of sexuality, gender, and race. Finally, students critically examine dominant discourses of science, individuality, and alterity, keeping an eye towards the application of social theory to contemporary concerns.\n\nSOSC 12400. Self, Culture, and Society I. 100 Units.\n\nThe social theories of Ibn Khaldun, Smith, Marx, and Weber, supplemented by historical and ethnographic works, serve as points of departure for considering the characterizing features of the modern world. Particular emphasis is given to socioeconomic structure, theories of historical change, possibilities for individual freedom, the meaning of work, and globalization.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nPrerequisite(s): These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped.\n\nSOSC 12500. Self, Culture, and Society II. 100 Units.\n\nIn Winter Quarter, students tackle questions about the construction of self and society. The works of Durkheim, Freud, de Beauvoir, Fanon, and others inform investigation of symbolic representation, the strength of social forces, the unconscious, culture, ethics and violence, sexuality, gender, and race.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Winter\n\nPrerequisite(s): SOSC 12400. These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped.\n\nSOSC 12600. Self, Culture, and Society III. 100 Units.\n\nIn Spring Quarter, students consider contemporary issues and social science approaches to them. Beginning with post-modern, post-colonial, and other critiques of sciences of self, culture, and society (as articulated by Kuhn, Foucault, and Said), the course investigates how new theories arise and new problems are addressed, how new perspectives (more global, more inclusive) test and challenge, and how social scientists change, renew, and improve their insights. The quarter focuses on topics of contemporary concern, including the human impact on the environment, feminism outside the West, and the rise of global cities.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Spring\n\nPrerequisite(s): SOSC 12500. These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped.\n\nSOSC 13100-13200-13300. Social Science Inquiry I-II-III.\n\nQuantitative data and mathematical information are abundant features of the social world, found in stock markets, unemployment reports, and inflation measures, in pre-election polls and forecasts of election outcomes, in strategic decisions about corporate takeovers, in the spread of disease, and in assessments of job-market discrimination or police violence. Social Science Inquiry aims to help students understand how quantitative social scientists examine such phenomena, highlighting core questions of design, analysis, and presentation. In the general SSI (SSI-General) sequence, we focus on widely used quantitative social science methods with special emphasis on causal inference, or the logic and methods by which one can ascertain the effect of one social phenomenon on another. In the Fall, we consider questions of research design, including the design of experimental and observational research. In the Winter, we introduce students to quantitative analysis of social data, with a special emphasis on hypothesis testing and regression analysis. In the Spring, students explore research questions of their own choosing in greater depth, culminating in a research paper.\n\nSOSC 13100. Social Science Inquiry I. 100 Units.\n\nThe Autumn Quarter starts by introducing students to the various ways that social scientists think about the world. Examples include theoretical models from Milton Friedman, Thomas Schelling, and John Nash; path-breaking experiments from Stanley Milgram and Daniel Kahneman; and quantitative research on topics ranging from voting to gun violence to baby names. Through these works, students will learn how researchers theorize about social phenomena.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nPrerequisite(s): These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped.\n\nSOSC 13200. Social Science Inquiry II. 100 Units.\n\nIn the Winter Quarter, students will be introduced to social science research tools. They will learn how to collect data, conduct experiments, and make causal inferences from statistics. Using the General Social Survey, the National Election Studies, and other surveys, students will gain hands-on experience working with large data sets.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Winter\n\nPrerequisite(s): SOSC 13100. These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped.\n\nSOSC 13300. Social Science Inquiry III. 100 Units.\n\nIn the Spring Quarter, students will conduct their own substantial research project. Students will learn how to translate their ideas into research questions, their theories into testable hypotheses, and their findings into meaningful conclusions. By year's end, students will develop a critical perspective on many perennial social questions and, ultimately, acquire \"quantitative literacy,\" essential skills in an increasingly data-driven world.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Spring\n\nPrerequisite(s): SOSC 13200. These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped.\n\nSOSC 13110-13210-13310. Social Science Inquiry: Formal Theory.\n\nSocial Science Inquiry: Formal Theory builds on the rich traditions of rational choice scholarship set in place by James Coleman and Gary Becker. Mastering game theoretic and public choice models is an invaluable tool for understanding how interest groups influence politics, how voting takes place in Congress, how matches are made in the dating world, or how neighborhood arrangements are coordinated. More broadly, applications of formal theory to social science include explaining how peace negotiations occur between governments and rebels in the aftermath of civil war, how trade unionists bargain over wages with employers, and even the decisions of autocrats to step down from power and allow for free elections. SSI-Formal Theory will introduce students to the systematic study of social, political, and economic interactions, where the optimal course of one person's action depends on the options and preferences of other people involved in the interaction. Students will learn how to model strategic situations in the language of mathematics and how to make equilibrium predictions.\n\nSOSC 13110. Social Science Inquiry: Formal Theory I. 100 Units.\n\nSocial Science Inquiry: Formal Theory I introduces students to deductive reasoning and teaches them primitives of rational choice---players, strategies and preferences.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nPrerequisite(s): These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped.\n\nSOSC 13210. Social Science Inquiry: Formal Theory II. 100 Units.\n\nSocial Science Inquiry: Formal Theory II covers two basic equilibrium concepts: Nash, and Subgame Perfect Nash.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Winter\n\nPrerequisite(s): SOSC 13110. These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped.\n\nSOSC 13310. Social Science Inquiry: Formal Theory III. 100 Units.\n\nSocial Science Inquiry: Formal Theory III covers games of incomplete information, including Bayesian Nash and Perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Spring\n\nPrerequisite(s): SOSC 13210. These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped.\n\nSOSC 13120-13220-13320. Social Science Inquiry: Spatial Analysis.\n\nSocial Science Inquiry: Spatial Analysis deals with the fundamental role of space, place, location, distance, and interaction—crucial to tackling many research questions in the social sciences. This sequence of three courses explores the fundamentals of spatial analysis, a collection of quantitative methods in which space is explicitly accounted for. The three courses explore different concepts of space; how it is measured, represented, and accounted for in social science methodology; and how spatial problems are solved (spatial reasoning).\n\nSOSC 13120. Social Science Inquiry: Spatial Analysis I. 100 Units.\n\nThis course explores the concept of spatial thinking and how it has been incorporated in research in the social sciences. Fundamental notions related to space, such as location, distance, spatial interaction, among others are explored in classic readings in quantitative geography, as well as in several recent examples of research papers in urban studies, sociology, political science, criminology, public health, and economics.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nPrerequisite(s): These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped.\n\nSOSC 13220. Social Science Inquiry: Spatial Analysis II. 100 Units.\n\nThis second course in the sequence covers basic principles of spatial analysis, geographic information science and spatial statistics. A range of methods for spatial data exploration and analysis are covered. A heavy emphasis is on carrying out the analysis by means of the open source statistical software R and its many spatial packages.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Winter\n\nPrerequisite(s): SOSC 13120. These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped.\n\nSOSC 13320. Social Science Inquiry: Spatial Analysis III. 100 Units.\n\nIn this third course of the spatial analysis sequence, the concepts and methods covered so far are applied to an actual research problem that deals with an issue where the role of space is important. The focus is on formulating a research question, collecting and analyzing data and communicating the results.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Spring\n\nPrerequisite(s): SOSC 13220. These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped.\n\nSOSC 14100-14200-14300. Mind I-II-III.\n\n\"Mind\" explores subjective experience and behavior through the lens of underlying mental processes, biological mechanisms, and social context. Drawing from research in the social sciences and beyond, the course broadly considers how empirical approaches can shape our understanding of long-standing questions about human experience. Each quarter of Mind is taught by a different group of faculty, and the material in each quarter is arranged into a broad theme that makes connections across quarters. These themes vary from year to year.\n\nSOSC 14100. Mind I. 100 Units.\n\nThe first quarter of Mind challenges the naïve impression that our subjective experience of reality is a veridical reflection of the external world. By introducing a wide-range of phenomena that illustrate the constructive nature of experience-- perceptual, conceptual, affective, social, and cultural-- the lectures and readings engage students in analyzing the mind's role in the construction of our realities. In particular, we consider our subjective awareness of and introspective access to the mental processes that shape reality for us and the bottom-up and top-down control of information processing in generating that reality. During the second half of the quarter we examine the dynamic nature of mind-- how our constructed realities emerge and change over time and role of nature and nurture in their development across a variety of time scales, exploring processes that unfold over the course of milliseconds as well as those that unfold over millennia.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nPrerequisite(s): These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped.\n\nSOSC 14200. Mind II. 100 Units.\n\nThis quarter focuses on how we can explain the causes of mental phenomena that are at once manifest in biological materials and determined by social and cultural forces. We examine theoretical explanations for a wide range of mental and behavioral phenomena based on mechanisms that operate at different levels of scientific analysis, including genetic, hormonal, neural, psychological, social, and cultural. The goal is to illustrate how explaining phenomena at different levels of analysis not only provides a richer, more detailed understanding of mental states and processes but can constrain causal models and lead to theoretical advances. Lectures cross-cut topics such as function and mechanism, reductionism and emergence, dynamic processes, genetics and epigenetics, distributed vs. localized neural representation, neuroendocrine systems, cognitive process models, modularity of processing, and socio-cultural interactions.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Winter\n\nPrerequisite(s): SOSC 14100. These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped.\n\nSOSC 14300. Mind III. 100 Units.\n\nSpring quarter of Mind examines the highly context-dependent nature of psychological processes and how their operation changes depending on the particular goals, decisions, and applications for which they are used. Context can be viewed broadly to include the physical environment, other people, and the invisible forces of culture and society, i.e., external sources of context. However, it is equally important to consider the internal psychological and biological context of mental activity, e.g., the interactive effects of motivation, affect, attention and knowledge on a particular process or phenomenon. Lectures address a variety of topics, including distraction and attentional control, environmental effects on attention and mood, political attitudes, decision-making, mathematical knowledge, emotion, and language use.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Spring\n\nPrerequisite(s): SOSC 14200. These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped.\n\nSOSC 15100-15200-15300. Classics of Social and Political Thought I-II-III.\n\n\"Classics of Social and Political Thought\" reads classic texts from Plato and Aristotle to Nietzsche and DuBois in order to investigate criteria for understanding and judging political, social, and economic institutions. What is justice? What makes a good society? This sequence examines such problems as the conflicts between individual interest and common good; between morality, religion, and politics; and between liberty and equality. We examine alternative conceptions of society, law, authority, consent, and dissent that underlie continuing controversies in contemporary political life.\n\nSOSC 15100. Classics of Social and Political Thought I. 100 Units.\n\n'Classics of Social and Political Thought' reads classic texts from Plato and Aristotle to Nietzsche and DuBois in order to investigate criteria for understanding and judging political, social, and economic institutions. What is justice? What makes a good society? This sequence examines such problems as the conflicts between individual interest and common good; between morality, religion, and politics; and between liberty and equality. We examine alternative conceptions of society, law, authority, consent, and dissent that underlie continuing controversies in contemporary political life. In recent years, thinkers read in the Autumn Quarter have included Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, and Machiavelli.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nPrerequisite(s): These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped.\n\nSOSC 15200. Classics of Social and Political Thought II. 100 Units.\n\n'Classics of Social and Political Thought' reads classic texts from Plato and Aristotle to Nietzsche and DuBois in order to investigate criteria for understanding and judging political, social, and economic institutions. What is justice? What makes a good society? This sequence examines such problems as the conflicts between individual interest and common good; between morality, religion, and politics; and between liberty and equality. We examine alternative conceptions of society, law, authority, consent, and dissent that underlie continuing controversies in contemporary political life. In recent years, thinkers read in the Winter Quarter have included Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Winter\n\nPrerequisite(s): SOSC 15100. These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped.\n\nSOSC 15300. Classics of Social and Political Thought III. 100 Units.\n\n'Classics of Social and Political Thought' reads classic texts from Plato and Aristotle to Nietzsche and DuBois in order to investigate criteria for understanding and judging political, social, and economic institutions. What is justice? What makes a good society? This sequence examines such problems as the conflicts between individual interest and common good; between morality, religion, and politics; and between liberty and equality. We examine alternative conceptions of society, law, authority, consent, and dissent that underlie continuing controversies in contemporary political life. In recent years, thinkers read in the Spring Quarter have included J.S. Mill, Tocqueville, Marx, Nietzsche, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Simone de Beauvoir.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Spring\n\nPrerequisite(s): SOSC 15200. These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped.\n\nSOSC 16100-16200-16300. Global Society I-II-III.\n\nGlobal Society is organized around three essential areas for making sense of a globalized world: social thought, population, and social change. The sequence is designed to cultivate an understanding of social science research that extends beyond experiences and processes that are particular to Western civilizations. The curriculum will expose students to a long-standing, globally expansive canon within the social sciences and teach students to distinguish cultural particulars from universal concerns.\n\nSOSC 16100. Global Society I. 100 Units.\n\nThe first quarter of Global Society addresses social thought from a global perspective by first considering some classic works from the Western tradition and then reading major statements about society from the classical traditions of others cultures including: Latin America, Islam, East Asia, and Africa. In Global Society, students read these statements simultaneously as theoretical treatises, as empirical approaches, and as normative prescriptions for the social world. This three-pronged approach enables us to disentangle differences in empirical perception from differences in values and to assess how, in combination, these color our own inevitably particular judgments of world events. The course opens a set of themes that will run through the entire sequence: individual-and-society, tradition-and-change, sources of social values, difference and particularity. The pedagogical emphasis is on close reading, discussion, and analytic writing. Possible readings include: Thomas More, J. J. Rousseau, D. F. Sarmiento, Ali Shariati, Raden Ayu Kartini, and Léopold Sédar Senghor\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nPrerequisite(s): These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped.\n\nSOSC 16200. Global Society II. 100 Units.\n\nThe second quarter of Global Society is built around the theme of population and is designed as a hybrid course that brings together a) an intellectual history of population thought and census-taking and b) a practical introduction to basic demographic tools and contemporary debates about population. Students will engage Malthus, his detractors, and new incarnations of Malthusian thought in detail. Questions considered will include: What is a population? What is at stake when we count? How many people can this earth support? What are the implications of population shifts for individual life chances? For social values and patterns of difference? Students will learn how to construct basic period lifetables, how to compare populations and sub-populations using basic standardization techniques, and how to analyze generations and cohorts in context. At the same time, since population issues like reproduction, migration, and mortality are simultaneously philosophical, political, and empirical matters, students will connect these practical and empirical analyses to political and value debates about the causes and consequences of population change. Possible texts include: Graunt, Petty, Malthus, Nehru, Wu Ta-k'un, and contemporary instantiations.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Winter\n\nPrerequisite(s): SOSC 16100. These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped.\n\nSOSC 16300. Global Society III. 100 Units.\n\nThis third part of the sequence marries themes that emerge from Global Social Thought and Population, with an emphasis on social change and development during twentieth and twenty-first centuries. From the perspective of Global Society, \"change\" and \"development\" encompass everything from micro-level changes in gender relations to macro-level shifts in the global economy. With new theoretical and empirical tools from parts 1 & 2 of the sequence, students will engage the empirical, the theoretical, and the normative aspects of defining and evaluating long-run and short-run social change. Using global and comparative lenses, we examine forms of state repression, civil resistance, religious transformations, technological and economic changes, and the effects of these large social patterns on individual persons. Students will write about the relationship of individuals to broad forces of social change, connecting themes from the first and second quarters. The sequence concludes with a set of writing workshops designed to guide students through the steps of producing a capstone sequence paper. Using the skills and tools they've acquired throughout the sequence, students will analyze the relationship of a particular cohort (anchored in a time, place) to social change, with a focus on the empirical, normative, and theoretical stakes, their causes and consequences. Possible texts include: Geertz, DuBois, Srinivas, and contemporary instantiations.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Spring\n\nPrerequisite(s): SOSC 16200. These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped.\n\nSOSC 17100-17200-17300. Religion: Cosmos, Conscience, and Community I-II-III.\n\n“Religion: Cosmos, Conscience, and Community” investigates the contributions made by various religious traditions and literatures to the multiple, often competing ways in which human beings have explained the world, thought about existence, and theorized the human. This sequence asks students not simply to synthesize materials in a single intellectual tradition, but rather to think across traditions, identifying points of convergence and divergence. Students will wrestle with how religious ideas, discourses, and practices inform the construction of knowledge and the formation of modern social scientific inquiry. Finally, this shared exploration affords students the opportunity to ask what the social sciences can and do contribute to issues of pressing or even ultimate concern: How do societies conceptualize good and evil? What is to be done, individually and/or collectively, about suffering and injustice? What constitutes the “good” life? What can we hope for?\n\nSOSC 17100. Religion: Cosmos, Conscience, and Community I. 100 Units.\n\nThe first quarter of this sequence prioritizes questions concerning epistemology and cosmology. Taking its cue from Durkheim, who argues that religion \"has not merely enriched the human intellect already formed, but in fact has helped to form it,\" this course explores how religious traditions around the globe have articulated the nature of knowledge, organized social realities, and imagined individual and collective identities. Students begin by examining how religious traditions narrate the origin of the world. They then query how individuals and societies situate themselves through cosmological speculation. On this foundation, the class will examine how social forms of power influence, and are influenced by, beliefs about divinities, the supernatural, and/or the nature of existence. Course materials encompass modern criticism of religion as well as evidence of the enduring power of religious thought in the modern world. Readings include Durkheim, Plato, Genesis, the Daodejing, Al-Ghazali, Avicenna, Descartes, Spinoza, Hume, and the Gettysburg Address.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nNote(s): These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped.\n\nSOSC 17200. Religion: Cosmos, Conscience, and Community II. 100 Units.\n\nDuring Autumn Quarter, we examined the ways in which religions inform categories of knowledge and accounts of natural and social order. In the Winter Quarter, we turn our attention elsewhere: How do societies conceptualize the nature of evil, suffering, and human frailty? How do they grapple with the gap between religious and/or moral ideals, on the one hand, and the realities of human finitude and weakness, on the other? What can be done about suffering and evil on individual and collective levels? How do group and individual practices identify and address these concerns? Throughout history and across cultures, people have often grappled with these questions through religious beliefs, practices, and writing. This course features authors who approach these issues by theorizing the role of the individual vis-à-vis society. Readings include Freud, Plato, the Bhagavad Gita, The Book of Job, Paul's Letter to the Romans, Augustine, Kafka, Nietzsche, the \"Word of the Buddha,\" Simone Weil, and Georges Bataille.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Winter\n\nPrerequisite(s): SOSC 17100\n\nNote(s): These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped.\n\nSOSC 17300. Religion: Cosmos, Conscience, and Community III. 100 Units.\n\nBuilding upon the Autumn and Winter Quarter courses, the third course within this sequence foregrounds ideology, politics, ethics, and critique. Students will explore themes central to religious traditions and ideologies: justice, community, the future, hope, and despair. We will tackle these issues through pursuing a constellation of questions: What ideas and practices do religions propose to remedy and cope with the challenges of life? How do religious traditions articulate social criticism? To what extent, and in what ways, do religions address matters of justice, love, and compassion? Students will explore how authors from various religious and ideological viewpoints have envisioned moral obligations to neighbor, enemy, the community, and the environment. How do religions express and/or disrupt types of social, economic, and political power? Finally, students will reflect on how we might responsibly study and evaluate religious proposals to these questions. Readings include Marx, Ali Shariati, Maimonides, Leo Strauss, Al-Farabi, Locke, Weber, Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., and Foucault.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Spring\n\nPrerequisite(s): SOSC 17100, SOSC 17200\n\nNote(s): These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped.\n\nSOSC 18400-18500-18600. Democracy: Equality, Liberty, and the Dilemmas of Self-Government I-II-III.\n\nThe Democracy sequence examines democracy as it has been practiced around the world since its emergence over two and a half millennia ago. It considers democracy to be not only a particular kind of regime and politics organized around the principle of self-government, but also a kind of social order ostensibly defined by the operation of power among independent equals (sometimes conceptualized as the balance between liberty and equality). Rather than presume self-government and equal liberty to be universal ideals or accomplished realities, this sequence explores how their categorical assertion amid often drastic imbalances of social and political power has produced unequal outcomes and other unintended consequences. To grapple with the analytical challenge posed by democracy requires blending multiple modes of analysis—historical, comparative, institutional, social, political, cultural, conceptual, textual—to bring empirical evidence and theoretical frameworks into mutually reinforcing focus. In addition to the critical reading and analysis of texts traditional to general education at the University of Chicago, the Democracy sequence guides students in the fundaments of independent inquiry through assignments requiring library research and supporting intellectual habits that are essential to social-scientific inquiry and democratic citizenship.\n\nSOSC 18400. Democracy: Equality, Liberty, and the Dilemmas of Self-Government I. 100 Units.\n\nThe first quarter of the Democracy sequence examines the establishment, maintenance, and demise of pre-modern popular governments, specifically Athenian democracy, the Roman Republic, and the medieval/Renaissance Florentine commune. Through close textual reading, conceptual and institutional analysis, and historical inquiry, students explore the stability, security, and constitutional forms of such regimes, and the place of liberty, equality, and justice within them (relative to other regime types such as monarchies and oligarchies). When engaging the question of how democracies decline and die, students consider factors such as civic corruption, oligarchic encroachment, and imperial overreach. Students read and discuss both primary texts from these regimes and social scientific analyses of them.\n\nInstructor(s): John McCormick Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nNote(s): These courses must be taken in sequence. Students registered in this sequence must attend the first and second class sessions or their registration will be dropped.\n\nSOSC 18500. Democracy: Equality, Liberty, and the Dilemmas of Self-Government II. 100 Units.\n\nThe second quarter of the Democracy sequence is devoted to the historical understanding of the emergence and fragility of democracy, probing sources of change and continuity-revolutionary rupture, constitutional stabilization, and counter-revolutionary reaction. The course has a number of overarching goals. First, students discover the diverse advantages offered by varied modes of inquiry in the social sciences as practiced by historians, sociologists, political scientists and economists, and theorists of all stripes. Second, students engage with texts to uncover multiple layers of analysis. In addition to reading works of philosophy and theory that augment texts assigned in the first term, students also examine political manifestos, constitutions, correspondence, speeches, essays, broadsides, and the like. Third, students develop intellectual habits and skills that are essential to independent inquiry, moving beyond the debates of the seminar room to pursue a guided encounter with library research.\n\nInstructor(s): Stephen Pincus, James T.

Democracy: Equality, Liberty, and the Dilemmas of Self-Government III. 100 Units.\n\nThe final quarter of the Democracy sequence grapples with the possibilities of, and challenges to, democratic government in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Faced with the bleak panorama of contemporary democratic erosion and breakdown, what can we learn from twentieth-century debates about democracy? When democracy has come under threat before, what ideas have emerged, from its detractors and from its defenders? This course offers a window into those debates. Students learn how political theorists, some of them also political participants, have responded to fascism, authoritarianism, and racial oppression, from the inter-war years through the middle decades of the last century. At the end of the course, students explore ideas about our current crises. Readings and written assignments sustain the concern for close textual analysis and historical inquiry established earlier in the sequence, but also highlight systematic attention to the uses of comparison, both over time and across nations.\n\nInstructor(s): Elisabeth Clemens Terms Offered: Spring\n\nPrerequisite(s): SOSC 18500\n\nNote(s): These courses must be taken in sequence.

Jewish Civilization in Vienna-I-II-III.\n\nSequence description not available\n\nSOSC 19073. Jewish Civilization in Vienna I. 100 Units.\n\nDesigned in relation to the following two segments of a three-part sequence, this course has two main goals: 1) to provide an introduction to Central European Jewish History from the mid-19th century to the present; and, 2) to give you a sense of Jewish Vienna in the same time period. The course is chronological in organization, but each class also focuses on a different theme - the place of politics, migration, culture, and commerce in the transformation of Jewish life in Vienna and Central Europe more generally. Since the latter two segments focus on literature and thought, we will focus here on social, political, and cultural history, with a particular emphasis on: migration and settlement patterns; the built environment; Jews at-home and not-at-home (in all senses) in Vienna; and, commemorative practices. Taking advantage of being in Vienna, this course makes full use of the city. Three class sessions will be held outside the classroom and there will be two day-long field trips. You will also have an assignment that can, if you so choose, take you into the city.\n\nSOSC 19074. Jewish Civilization in Vienna II. 100 Units.\n\nIn this section of the class we will focus on the role of Jewish thought in a city that represented both the hope and possibility of modernity as a site of liberation for Jews and as a place of profound disappointment and despair over the failure of that project. We will begin by considering the religious, often Hasidic roots, of the community of Galician Jews who would make up Vienna's Jewish population. We will turn then to philosophy, political theory and psychoanalysis as three discourses in which modern Jewish thinkers made their mark, reading Mendelsson, Freud, Herzl and Kelsen, and then in the final section of the class will treat the reconstruction of Jewish memory in light of the destruction of European Jewry in the Holocaust, pairing an examination of memory studies with the representation of Judaism and the Shoah in Viennese museums and at its historical sites.\n\nSOSC 19075. Jewish Civilization in Vienna III. 100 Units.\n\nBuilding on the two previous units, this section focuses on the arts - especially literature - created by Jews in East and Central Europe from the turn of the century, through the interwar period, and into the postwar period. We will ask how Jewish poets, novelists, theater practitioners and visual artists responded to the social, political, and intellectual developments you learned about in the previous two sections. We will think about the relation between the urban centers (Vienna, Berlin, Warsaw, Odessa) and their peripheries, and about the journey to the city as a modernist trope. We will pay close attention to the dynamics between the different languages in which Jews wrote - German, Yiddish, Hebrew, Polish, Russian - asking how Jewish authors made language choices and what these choices meant. In addition to rounding out your understanding of Jewish cultural history, the purpose of this unit is to think about how art and literature slows us down, creating spaces for thinking and reflection. We will be circling back to some of the figures you've already encountered and re-visit some of the sites you've already been to, trying see them in a new light, through the prism of artistic practice. In accordance with that, you will have the option of submitting creative writing or other artistic work for some of your assignments.\n\nSOSC 19076-19077-19078. Migration, Decolonization and Diaspora Civilization.\n\nThis sequence is designed to give students the historical context for understanding contemporary debates on postcolonial immigration and multiculturalism as well conceptual frameworks for analyzing issues of race, otherness, and the legacies of the colonial encounter—in France and elsewhere. We will explore the histories, definitions, and connotations of “Frenchness,” as well as consider how colonized peoples have helped to create those meanings. However, this course will not simply treat the inhabitants of former French colonies as a window onto France. We will also investigate how various colonized peoples directed, shaped and contributed to the worlds in which they lived, and how they actively made and maintained relations with other peoples, such as the French. Those processes and interchanges, as we will learn, often produced unintended consequences, with which both the inhabitants of France and the inhabitants of the former French empire continue to grapple today. Our goal is for students to emerge from the class with a better understanding of the legacies of French imperialism, and of the history and theories that animate contemporary debates on multicultural France. Students will have an opportunity to learn about Paris beyond its standard hallmarks—the museums and sites that are the mainstay of typical tourist guides—to explore the ways in which France’s former empire and its peoples has made and remade the city.\n\nSOSC 19076. Migration, Decolonization, and Diaspora Civilization-I. 100 Units.\n\nThis sequence is designed to give students the historical context for understanding contemporary debates on postcolonial immigration and multiculturalism as well conceptual frameworks for analyzing issues of race, otherness, and the legacies of the colonial encounter-in France and elsewhere.

The Politics and Economics of Capitalism. 100 Units.\n\nIt is impossible to graduate from college without repeatedly encountering the term \"capitalism.\" But what is it, actually? Is it primarily a political or an economic system? What is the difference and why does it matter? Why are economics and politics taught in different departments at modern universities and why is a major in economics so popular? This course will equip students with the basic conceptual tools to think about these questions. We will try to understand the history and theory of capitalism by reading selections from six of the most important theorists of modern economic life: Adam Smith, Karl Marx, Friedrich List, William Stanley Jevons, John Maynard Keynes, and Friedrich Hayek.\n\nTerms Offered: Summer\n\nSOSC 18100. Topics in Behavioral and Social Sciences Relevant to Medicine. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will survey key topics in behavioral and social sciences relevant to training in and practice of medicine. Among the topics addressed will be sensation and perception, cognition, social psychology, and the biological bases of behavior, as well as communications theory, institutional organization, sociology of health choices and outcomes, statistical reasoning, and research design. Grades will be based on a combination of exams and quizzes. There are no prerequisites for this course. It will not count toward major or minor credit in any College program with the exception of the Health and Society minor.\n\nInstructor(s): K.

Ancient Near Eastern History and Society III. 100 Units.\n\nThis course introduces students to the history of ancient Anatolia and its neighbors from the first historical texts around 2000 BCE, with a short detour through prehistory and the appearance of Proto-Indo-European culture, to the arrival of Alexander the Great. Some of the famous ancient Near Eastern civilizations that we encounter include the Assyrians, Hittites, Phrygians, Lydians, Persians, and Israelites. We will focus on the information provided by inscriptions - especially political and socioeconomic history - as well as the relevant archaeological and art historical records. No prior knowledge of Anatolian or Near Eastern history is required.\n\nInstructor(s): Petra Goedegebuure Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): NEHC 30003, NEHC 20003\n\nSOSC 20004. Ancient Near Eastern Thought and Literature I: Mesopotamian Literature. 100 Units.\n\nThis course gives an overview of the richness of Mesopotamian Literature (modern Iraq) written in the 3rd-1st millennium BC. We will read myths and epics written on clay tablets in the Sumerian and Akkadian language in English translation and discuss content and style, but also the religious, cultural and historic implications. Particular focus will be on the development of stories over time, the historical context of the literature and mythological figures. The texts treated cover not only the famous Epic of Gilgamesh, but also various legends of Sumerian and Akkadian kings, stories about Creation and World Order, and destruction. The topics covered range from the quest for immortality, epic heroes and monsters, sexuality and love.\n\nInstructor(s): Susanne Paulus Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nNote(s): Taking these courses in sequence is not required.

Ancient Near Eastern Thought & Literature II: Anatolian Lit. 100 Units.\n\nThe goal of this class is to get an overview of Hittite literature, as \"defined\" by the Hittites themselves, in the wider historical-cultural context of the Ancient Near East. Some of the most important questions we can ask ourselves in reading ancient texts are: why were they written down, why were they kept, for whom were they intended, and what do the answers to these questions (apart from the primary content of the texts themselves) tell us about - in our case - Hittite society?\n\nInstructor(s): Petra Goedegebuure Terms Offered: Spring\n\nNote(s): Taking these courses in sequence is not required.

Ancient Empires II: The Ottoman Empire. 100 Units.\n\nThe Ottomans ruled in Anatolia, the Middle East, South East Europe and North Africa for over six hundred years. The objective of this course is to understand the society and culture of this bygone Empire whose legacy continues, in one way or another, in some twenty-five contemporary successor states from the Balkans to the Arabian Peninsula. The course is designed as an introduction to the Ottoman World with a focus on the cultural history of the Ottoman society. It explores identities and mentalities, customs and rituals, status of minorities, mystical orders and religious establishments, literacy and the use of the public sphere.\n\nInstructor(s): Hakan Karateke Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nNote(s): Taking these courses in sequence is not required.

Introduction to African Civilization I. 100 Units.\n\nPart one considers literary, oral, linguistic, and material sources to investigate African societies and states from the early Iron Age through the emergence of the Atlantic World. Case studies include: the empires of Ghana and Mali, the Swahili Coast, Great Zimbabwe, Nok of Nigeria, and medieval Ethiopia. We also consider religious and spiritual transformation, including Islam in Africa, as well as the origins and effects of European contact, and the emergence of the transatlantic trade in enslaved human beings. Students examine these times and places through primary sources (such as cultural artifacts, visual representations, myths, and memoirs) which illuminate African perspectives on these different places and times. Assignments: oral presentations, document analyses, essays, and team projects.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): HIST 10101, ANTH 20701, CRES 20701, MDVL 10101\n\nSOSC 20202. Introduction to African Civilization II. 100 Units.\n\nThis course examines the transformations of African societies in the long nineteenth century. At the beginning of the era, European economic and political presence was mainly coastal, but by the end, nearly the entire continent was colonized. This course examines how and why this process occurred, highlighting the struggles of African societies to manage internal reforms and external political, military, and economic pressures. Students examine these processes through various primary sources (such as visual and material sources, cultural artifacts, and personal accounts) that highlight African perspectives on these processes.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ANTH 20702, CRES 20802, HIST 10102\n\nSOSC 20203.

Qualitative Research: Impact & Insights for Industry. 100 Units.\n\nWhat distinguishes impactful applied research from academic study? How can qualitative insights not just inform but transform decision making in private, public, and nonprofit organizations? This course is designed for students who are curious about the fields of market research, consulting, and related fields, offering a deep dive into the practical application of qualitative methods in solving real organizational challenges. Through real-world case studies, students will explore a spectrum of contemporary qualitative research techniques. These methods are not just academic tools but catalysts for strategic decision-making in marketing, business, and beyond. The course culminates in a final project where students apply their learnings to a genuine client challenge, transitioning from theory to practice. By centering the course on dynamic, results-oriented research in industry, this course sheds light on the ways that qualitative research is invaluable to organizational strategy and decision making. Students will gain exposure to how qualitative insights can be game-changing in areas ranging from brand equity to new product innovation.\n\nInstructor(s): Kelly Kutas Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): MAPS 30206\n\nSOSC 20210. UX Research Foundations. 100 Units.\n\nUser Experience (\"UX\") is a professional field and practice that aims to understand the core needs of users to positively impact the experience and successful adoption of a product. How we define \"product\" in UX has great variation and can be physical, digital, or omnichannel-this makes the field of study highly nuanced, complex, and engaging. UX practitioners are present in a variety of industries including Tech, Automotive, Healthcare, Travel, and CPG (consumer packaged goods). UX Researchers specifically contribute to this field by deeply understanding and measuring user outcomes. We report both findings and actionable insights for product, design, insights, engineering, marketing, and business stakeholders. To do so successfully, many user research methodologies are leveraged (both qualitative and quantitative) and findings are socialized in a way that makes product (rather than pedagogical) impact. This course aims to lay a theoretical and methodological foundation for user experience research and reporting. The goal of this course is to equip students who are curious about UXR with the basic foundation needed to enter the job market. Students will gain a deep theoretical and historical understanding of the field of User Experience and its methods, learn basic design principles to help them communicate with colleagues in an applied context, and produce a final project (and supplementary research materials) that can serve as a professional portfolio piece/case study.\n\nInstructor(s): Megan McLean Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): MAPS 30210\n\nSOSC 20416. Semitic Languages, Cultures, and Civilizations I. 100 Units.\n\nThis course looks at the attestations of Semitic, the development of the language family and its individual languages, the connection of language spread and political expansions with the development of empires and nation states (which can lead to the development of different language strata), the interplay of linguistic innovation and archaism in connection with innovative centers and peripheries, and the connection and development of language and writing.\n\nTerms Offered: TBD\n\nEquivalent Course(s): NEHC 20416, NEHC 30416, HIST 15702\n\nSOSC 20417. Semitic Languages, Cultures, and Civilizations II. 100 Units.\n\nThis course explores various peoples of the ancient Near East from the third through the first millennium BC. The shared characteristic of those peoples is their use of Semitic languages. The focus is on major cultural traditions that later become of interest for the modern Middle East and for the Western world. This course provides a background to understand contemporary problems in a historical context. This includes a close examination and discussion of representative ancient sources, as well as readings in modern scholarship to help us think of interpretative frameworks and questions. Ancient sources include literary, historical, and legal documents. Texts in English.\n\nTerms Offered: TBD\n\nNote(s): Not open to first-year students\n\nEquivalent Course(s): NEHC 30417, HIST 15703, NEHC 20417\n\nSOSC 20418. Semitic Languages, Cultures, and Civilizations III. 100 Units.\n\nThe course studies how various groups in the Middle East imagined the ancient Semitic heritage of the region. We examine how Semitic languages (in particular, Arabic and Hebrew) came to be regarded as the national markers of the peoples of the Middle East. We likewise explore the ways in which archeologists, historians, novelists, and artists emphasized the connectivity between past and present, and the channels through which their new ideas were transmitted. The class thus highlights phenomena like nationalism, reform, and literary and print capitalism (in both Hebrew and Arabic) as experienced in the Middle East.\n\nTerms Offered: TBD\n\nNote(s): Not open to first-year students\n\nEquivalent Course(s): HIST 15704, NEHC 20418, JWSC 21100, NEHC 30418\n\nSOSC 20501.

Islamic History and Society III:The Modern Middle East. 100 Units.\n\nThis course covers the period from ca. 1750 to the present, focusing on Western military, economic, and ideological encroachment; the impact of such ideas as nationalism and liberalism; efforts at reform in the Islamic states; the emergence of the \"modern\" Middle East after World War I; the struggle for liberation from Western colonial and imperial control; the Middle Eastern states in the cold war era; and local and regional conflicts.\n\nInstructor(s): Holly Shissler Terms Offered: Spring\n\nPrerequisite(s): Not open to first-year students\n\nNote(s): This course does not apply to the medieval studies major or minor.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): NEHC 20503, HIST 25904, HIST 35904, NEHC 30503\n\nSOSC 21001. Human Rights: Contemporary Issues. 100 Units.\n\nThis course examines basic human rights norms and concepts and selected contemporary human rights problems from across the globe, including human rights implications of the COVID pandemic. Beginning with an overview of the present crises and significant actors on the world stage, we will then examine the political setting for the United Nations' approval of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights in 1948. The post-World War 2 period was a period of optimism and fertile ground for the establishment of a universal rights regime, given the defeat of fascism in Europe. International jurists wanted to establish a framework of rights that went beyond the nation-state, taking into consideration the partitions of India-Pakistan and Israel-Palestine - and the rising expectations of African-Americans in the U.S. and colonized peoples across Africa and Asia. But from the beginning, there were basic contradictions in a system of rights promulgated by representatives of nation-states that ruled colonial regimes, maintained de facto and de jure systems of racial discrimination, and imprisoned political dissidents and journalists. Cross-cutting themes of the course include the universalism of human rights, problems of impunity and accountability, notions of \"exceptionalism,\" and the emerging issue of the \"shamelessness\" of authoritarian regimes. Students will research a human rights topic of their choosing, to be presented as either a final research paper or a group presentation.\n\nInstructor(s): Susan Gzesh, Senior Lecturer, (The College) Terms Offered: Autumn Spring Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): HIST 29304, LLSO 21001, HMRT 21001, DEMS 21001, CHST 21001, CRES 21001, LACS 21001\n\nSOSC 21100-21200. Music in Western Civilization I-II.\n\nThis two-quarter sequence explores musical works of broad cultural significance in Western civilization. We study pieces not only from the standpoint of musical style but also through the lenses of politics, intellectual history, economics, gender, cultural studies, and so on. Readings are taken both from our music textbook and from the writings of a number of figures such as St. Benedict of Nursia and Martin Luther. In addition to lectures, students discuss important issues in the readings and participate in music listening exercises in smaller sections.\n\nSOSC 21100. Music In Western Civilization I: To 1750. 100 Units.\n\nThis course, part of the Social Sciences Civ core, looks at musics in different moments of Euro-American history and the social contexts in which they originated, with some comparative views on other world traditions. It aims to give students a better understanding of the social contexts of European music over this period; aids for the basic sound structures of pieces from these different moments; and convincing writing in response to prompts based on source readings or music pieces. Our first quarter (MUS 12100 etc.) spans roughly the period between Charlemagne's coronation as Holy Roman Emperor (800 CE) and the dissolution of the Empire (1806) with the triumph of Napoleon across Western Europe.\n\nInstructor(s): R.

The first quarter covers the ninth century to the 1870s; the second quarter continues on through the post-Soviet period. Working closely with a variety of primary sources—from oral legends to film and music, from political treatises to literary masterpieces—we will track the evolution of Russian civilization over the centuries and through radically different political regimes. Topics to be discussed include the influence of Byzantine, Mongol-Tataric, and Western culture in Russian civilization; forces of change and continuity in political, intellectual and cultural life; the relationship between center and periphery; systems of social and political legitimization; and symbols and practices of collective identity.\n\nSOSC 24000. Russia and Eurasia: Empires, Societies, Cultures I. 100 Units.\n\nThe first quarter spans the centuries between early medieval Rus', which furnished modern Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus with a story of origins, to the intellectual, social, and national mobilization in the mid-19th century. Major themes include: the influence of Byzantine, Mongol-Tataric, and Western cultures; medieval principalities, city-states, and the rise of the centralized state, its oversized role in Russian and regional social and economic development, its hyper-modernizing schemes and its periodic collapse; cross-cultural interactions in the steppe and the Baltic and Black Seas littorals; Russia's wars and the emergence of the Russian empire; varieties of resistance, from peasant uprisings and flight to religious dissent to aristocratic opposition, and the emergence of the repressive machinery of the state; forces of change and continuity in political, intellectual, and cultural life.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nNote(s): Taking these courses in sequence is recommended but not required.

The Rights of Immigrants and Refugees in Practice. 100 Units.\n\nThis course employs an interdisciplinary approach to examine the work of social justice advocacy for and by non-citizens in the U.S. including asylum seekers, immigrant workers, women as migrants, migrant children, and the undocumented. Our readings will place selected case studies in their local, national, and international context. We will draw on sources from law, history, sociology, political science, and the arts. Texts, films, and guest speakers will address the history of immigrants' rights advocacy in the Chicago and the U.S., with selected global examples. Topics will include the rights of asylum seekers, the problems of migrant workers (guest-workers and the undocumented), women and children as migrants, and the impact of the global pandemic on migration in general. The case studies will illuminate the role of immigrants as leaders and the relationship between impacted communities and the state. We will meet with journalists, elected officials, organizers, academics, artists, lawyers, and immigrant community leaders to discuss distinct approaches to migrants' rights advocacy.\n\nInstructor(s): Susan Gzesh Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): INRE 34506, CHST 24506, GLST 24506, LLSO 24506, HMRT 26813\n\nSOSC 24701. Human Rights: Migrant, Refugee, Citizen. 100 Units.\n\nThe fundamental principle underlying human rights is that they are inherent in the identity of all human beings, regardless of place and without regard to citizenship, nationality, or immigration status. Human rights are universal and must be respected everywhere and always. Human rights treaties and doctrines mandate that a person does not lose their human rights simply by crossing a border. While citizens enjoy certain political rights withheld from foreigners within any given nation-state, what ARE the rights of non-citizens in the contemporary world? Students will research a human rights topic of their choosing, to be presented as either a final research paper or a group presentation.\n\nInstructor(s): Susan Gzesh, Senior Lecturer, (The College) Terms Offered: Autumn Winter\n\nPrerequisite(s): A prior course in Human Rights or a migration-related topic would be desirable but not necessary\n\nEquivalent Course(s): HMRT 24701, SSAD 44701, CRES 24701, HMRT 34701, LLSO 24701, LACS 25303\n\nSOSC 25131. Evolution in Thought, Art, and Culture. 100 Units.\n\nEvolution, as it is understood by biologists and other scientists, refers to the process of generational change in the inherited characteristics of life forms. But it is also a powerful idea with ongoing significance for debates about human nature and the human relationship to nonhuman life and technology. Since its development in the nineteenth century, the idea of evolution has motivated countless writers, scientists, philosophers, and artists to imagine and advocate for diverse visions of the future of human life on earth and beyond. Through materials as diverse as Darwin's own account of his formulation of the theory of evolution to science fiction films like Gattaca, we will consider a variety of engagements with evolutionary thought ranging from the construction of political utopias to programs in genetic manipulation and biohacking to efforts at preserving the past and future of endangered species. In so doing, we will analyze the history of evolutionary speculation, consider the ethical values associated with the various scientific, social, and cultural projects it has inspired, and develop the critical skills needed to tackle questions raised by developments in science and technology.\n\nTerms Offered: Summer\n\nSOSC 25313. Beyond Human: Geniuses, Superheroes and A.I. 100 Units.\n\nThis interdisciplinary course will explore what it means to be human by spotlighting cases that push the limits of human cognition. We will study sociological and psychological works that deal with topics ranging from gifted individuals, superhuman abilities, and technological wonders. As we do so, we will bring into conversation the real and the imagined-moving from social experiments to works of fiction and media productions. Questions we will tackle throughout the course include: Why do we look at geniuses with both awe and anxiety? What can superhero movies tell us about morality? Can we trust the machines that we built? Together, we will discuss how different cultural understandings and social contexts shape the answers we give to these questions.\n\nTerms Offered: Summer\n\nSOSC 25314. The Rise and Persistence of \"The Top 1%\": The Sociology of Economic Advantage. 100 Units.\n\nIn many parts of the world, socioeconomic inequality has been on the rise for several decades. Within these countries, the wealth, resources, and power of \"the Top 1%\" seems to be reaching unparalleled levels. Who comprises this \"elite\"? How does an individual attain this status? How do they perform and reproduce their status in society? What role can (and should) the members of such an elite play in society? How might all of this be changing in the 21st century? This course explores these questions by turning our sociological lenses on those who are advantaged in structures of equality, and how they acquire, claim, and amass power and resources. Throughout the course, students will learn how to critically read social theory, draw on sociological concepts to debate real world dilemmas, and form their own nuanced and informed opinions.\n\nTerms Offered: Summer\n\nSOSC 25315. The Possibility of Freedom. 100 Units.\n\nSince the eighteenth century, freedom has served as one of the primary ends toward which political life is directed, and perhaps as a result freedom has come to be understood largely in political terms. In this course we will question this association of freedom and politics, both with an eye toward expanding the possible avenues through which freedom can be understood and enjoyed while also identifying the conditions under which freedom can be meaningfully lived in the political realm. We will begin the course by engaging with classic thinkers like Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Alexis de Tocqueville. We will then move to a consideration of twentieth- and twenty-first century thinkers who have grappled with the question of freedom, including Hannah Arendt, Albert Camus, Simone Weil, Jacques Ellul, E.F. Schumacher, Wendell Berry, Alan Moore, and James C. Scott.\n\nTerms Offered: Summer\n\nSOSC 25411. East Asian Civilization I, Ancient Period-1600. 100 Units.\n\nThis course examines the politics, society, and culture of East Asia from ancient times until c. 1600. Our focus will be on examining key historical moments and intellectual, social, and cultural trends with an emphasis on viewing the region as a whole. Students will read and discuss culturally significant texts and be introduced to various approaches to analyzing them. This will include discussions of differences in how we approach textual and non-textual evidence (such as archaeological artifacts and reconstructed climate data), and especially the challenges of recovering other meanings from texts that were written and/or later used to legitimate particular regimes, or to project current practices back into the distant past so that they seem to be manifestations of a society's defining traditions.\n\nInstructor(s): K.

East Asian Civilization II, 1600-1895. 100 Units.\n\nSecond quarter of East Asian civilization sequence covering what are now China, Japan, and Korea from roughly 1600-1895. Major themes include demographic and economic change, plus the social and cultural effects of widespread but uneven commercialization; state formation, rebellion, and political change; migration, urbanization, and territorial expansion; changes in family and gender roles; changes in the \"natural\" environment, particularly as related to agricultural expansion; changes in religion, ideology, and relationships between \"elite\" and \"popular\" culture; and increasingly consequential encounters with Western Europeans, Russians, and Americans, especially in the 19th century. The course aims to treat East Asia as a single, interacting region, rather than as three (or more) sharply separated proto-nations; however, it will also call attention to the enormous diversity both among and within China, Japan, and Korea, treating those differences as constantly evolving, and as something to be explained rather than assumed.\n\nInstructor(s): S.

East Asian Civilization III, 1895-Present. 100 Units.\n\nThe third quarter of the East Asian civilization sequence covers the emerging nation-states of China, Korea, and Japan in the context of Western and Japanese imperialism and the rise of an interconnected global economy. Our themes include industrialization and urbanization, state strengthening and nation-building, the rise of social movements and mass politics, the impact of Japanese colonialism on the homeland and the colonies, East Asia in the context of US-Soviet rivalry, and the return of the region to the center of the global economy in the postwar years. Similar to the first and second quarters, we will look at East Asia as an integrated region, connected by trade and cultural exchange even when divided into opposing blocs during the Cold War. As much as possible, we will look beyond nation-states and their policies to explore the underlying trends shared by the three East Asian nations, such as mass culture, imperialism, and the impact of the cold war.\n\nInstructor(s): Y.

Urban Design Studio: Reconstructing Chicago's Lost Neighborhoods Using Machine Learning. 100 Units.\n\nThis course offers a hands-on learning experience in which students will digitally recreate the \"lost neighborhoods\" of Chicago using machine learning techniques. Students will be guided through the process of turning historical Sanborn maps into 3D models of historic urban neighborhoods. The creation of these historic urban models will be contextualized through archival research at the Chicago History Museum, as well as readings and lectures designed to advance student understanding of urban development within the historical context of U.S. cities in the 20th century, and Chicago specifically. Programming experience is helpful, but not required.\n\nInstructor(s): Talen, E Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ENST 26002, PPHA 36002, CHST 26002, PBPL 26002, GEOG 24200\n\nSOSC 26004. History of City Planning. 100 Units.\n\nThis lecture-based course provides a broad survey of the history of city planning. It focuses on the normative: the endeavor to control and design the physical fabric of cities. What are the different ways cities have been envisioned and planned and to what effect? What are the competing theories of good city design that underlie city plans, and how do these plans interrelate to the social, political, cultural, and economic forces shaping cities? The course explores city planning's successes and failures, its tangible effect on urban pattern and form, and the extent to which city planning ideals have changed over time. Though the emphasis is on city planning's history, current debates about city planning within the context of the history of the profession will also be engaged. Emphasis will be on U.S. and European city planning experience, although global practices will also be surveyed.\n\nInstructor(s): E.
