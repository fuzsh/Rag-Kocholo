Merrill Lounge\n\nAndrew March will be speaking about his on-going book project, which is an analytic history of modern Islamic thought on political sovereignty and the foundations of government. Its main focus is on a tradition of thinking on sovereignty that has developed since the late 19th and early 20th century, associated originally with Islamic Modernism and more recently with the thought of Tunisian Islamist Rashid al-Ghannushi and many other thinkers within the broad orbit of the Islamist movement. A central idea advanced in this discourse is that all mankind (following certain verses of the Qur’an) have inherited the vicegerency (caliphate) of God. This doctrine, along with very popular views on the meaning of God’s law which stress the centrality of public welfare and God’s purposes (maqasid) in creating the law, pave the way for a more popular, but still constrained, conception of sovereignty. God remains the ultimate legislator, and the author of man’s rights, but mankind at large (primarily, although not always exclusively, Muslims) is authorized collectively to establish government, constitute itself as a political entity and define in its broad and narrow particulars what it means to apply God’s law. His study is aimed at mapping out these various genealogies of sovereignty, exploring the various paradoxes and ambiguities in trying to reconcile ideals of divine and popular sovereignty in Islamic political theology, and elaborating their most recent doctrinal manifestations and developments since 2011.\n\nAndrew F. March is Associate Professor of Political Science, Yale University. His research interests are in the areas of Islamic law and political thought, contemporary political theory, the history of political thought and religion and politics.\n\n(top)\n\nMonday, May 18 / CENTER FOR JEWISH STUDIES / Maurice Samuels / “French Universalism and the Jews: Anti-Antisemitism and the Right to Difference” / 4:00-6:00pm / Humanities 1, Room 210\n\nIn conflicts over the veil or the return of antisemitism in France today, minority difference is often seen as a threat not only to public order but to the Republic itself. Long on the defensive, universalism has now staged a comeback in current discourse that seeks to guard against excessive communitarianism or the fantasized demon of American-style multi-culturalism. However, the universal and the particular were not always as opposed as today seems to be the case. In this paper, I look back at the history of the way the universal was theorized in relation to France’s paradigmatic minority—the Jews—from the Revolution through the nineteenth century. My goal is to show that prior to the hardening of positions during the Dreyfus Affair, French universalism was far more welcoming to minority difference than is ordinarily assumed today. Recovering this history, I suggest, might offer ways around France’s current ethnic and religious dilemmas.\n\nMaurice Samuels is Betty Jane Anlyan Professor of French at Yale, where he also directs the Yale Program for the Study of Antisemitism. He’s is the author of “The Spectacular Past: Popular History and the Novel in Nineteenth-Century France,” published by Cornell University Press in 2004, and of “Inventing the Israelite: Jewish Fiction in Nineteenth-Century France,” published by Stanford University Press in 2010, which won the Scaglione Prize given by the MLA for the best book in French Studies. He also co-edited “Nineteenth-Century Jewish Literature: A Reader,” published by Stanford in 2013.\n\n(top)\n\nMonday, May 18 / FILM + DIGITAL MEDIA ARTIST SPEAKERS SERIES / Kevin Jerome Everson / Screening of “Erie” and Artist Q&A / 7:00pm / Communications 150 (Studio C)\n\nErie consists of entrancing single-take, 16mm black-and-white sequences filmed in and around the communities surrounding Lake Erie. Scenes explore African American migration from the South to the North, contemporary conditions, everyday tasks and labors, theater, and famous art objects. Erie has been described as “a revelation… full of images of pure poetry” on Turner Classic Movies’ blog and has been seen and honored at film festival awards around the world.\n\nOhio native Kevin Jerome Everson, who has made six feature films and over ninety shorts, is one of the most prolific and remarkable independent filmmakers working today. His work has been exhibited internationally at festivals, museums, cinemas and galleries, including the 2008 and 2012 Whitney Biennials. A solo exhibition of his short films, More Than That: The films of Kevin Jerome Everson was held at the Whitney in 2011. He has been the subject of career retrospectives at the Centre Pompidou, Paris and Visions du Reel, Nyon. He is the recepient of the 2012 Alpert Award in the Arts for Film/Video.\n\nWith a sense of place and historical research, Kevin Jerome Everson’s films combine scripted and documentary moments with rich elements of formalism. The subject matter is the gestures or tasks caused by certain conditions in the lives of working class African Americans and other people of African descent. The conditions are usually physical, social-economic circumstances or weather. Instead of standard realism he favors a strategy that abstracts everyday actions and statements into theatrical gestures, in which archival footage is re-edited or re-staged, real people perform fictional scenarios based on their own lives and historical observations intermesh with contemporary narratives. The films suggest the relentlessness of everyday life—along with its beauty—but also present oblique metaphors for art-making.\n\n(top)\n\nTuesday, May 19 / HISTORY DEPARTMENT / David Brundage / “Remembering 1916 in America: The Easter Rising’s Many Faces, 1919-1962″ / 2:00-3:00pm / Humanities 1, Room 520\n\nDavid Brundage is Professor of history and the History Graduate Program Director.\n\nThe talk will draw on an essay-in-progress for a collection entitled Remembering 1916: The Easter Rising, the Somme and the Politics of Memory, ed. Richard S. Grayson and Fearghal McGarry. Brundage focuses his attention on a period that has been relatively neglected in the history of the Irish in America, the 1920s through the early 1960s. How (and by whom) was the 1916 Rising remembered in this period? Providing some answers to this question can tell us a great deal about the striking diversity of memory practices, while also shedding light on important aspects of Irish American (and American) life in these decades.\n\nA once powerful Irish American nationalist movement shrank dramatically in this period. Nonetheless, the Rising continued to be remembered (differently) by Catholic churchmen, Irish American labor leaders, African American nationalists, and Hollywood. The telling of the Easter Rising story, Brundage argues, had a kind of modular character. That is, narratives of 1916, frequently marked by stirring examples of idealism, courage, and sacrifice, could be lifted out of their specifically Irish context and used to legitimize or inspire other sorts of movements and agendas—or simply to entertain. Remembering 1916 in America involved a diverse array of people, practices, and motives, and its analysis has the potential to shed light on important mid-twentieth century topics ranging from African American nationalism to representations of Ireland and the Irish in American popular culture.\n\n(top)\n\nTuesday, May 19 / CRISIS IN THE CULTURES OF CAPITALISM RESEARCH CLUSTER / Neferti Tadiar / “Next to Nothing” / 4:00-6:00pm / Humanities 1, Room 210\n\nThis talk is a meditation on remaindered life, the unsubsumable, indivisible yet every-diminishing leftover of life-making practice for those who live in proximity to a social state of utter valuelessness. Drawing on diverse yet connected social contexts of redundant or superfluous populations, including undocumented immigrants, refugees, guest workers, and criminalized black and brown men and women, in a global, post-Fordist economy where all life bears the potential to serve as a direct means and source for the extraction of capitalist value, the talk explores the significance of lives lived on the perpetual verge of being nothing not only to offer an alternative account of the current globopolitical order. Tracing the constitutive elements of slavery and colonialism in this global present, the talk also reflects on the petty social currencies of small-time living as a speculative exercise on what is to be done next.\n\n(top)\n\nTuesday, May 19 / INSTITUTE FOR THE ARTS AND SCIENCES / Last LASER (Leonardo Art/Science Evening Rendezvous) of the Year / 6:30-8:00pm / Digital Arts Research Center (DARC) Dark Lab, Room 108\n\nJoin us for refreshments at 6:30 p.m. followed at 7 p.m. with presentations by:\n\nDaniel Press is the Olga T.

Fundamental to student resistance was the lack of meaningful activity and authentic materials that connected curriculum to students’ linguistic strengths, target-culture knowledge, and the communities from which they came.\n\nThe native Spanish-speaking teacher taught the course as if the Mexican-origin students were foreign language learners without certain native-like language proficiencies and insider cultural knowledge gained from actual experience.\n\nIn turn, the instructor did not fully access his own linguistic and cultural repertoire, but instead relied on published foreign language materials that failed to engage students and constructed them as linguistic and cultural outsiders. A pueblo-based pedagogical framework is proposed to make curriculum more culturally relevant, authentic, and engaging.\n\n(top)\n\nThursday, May 21 / CRITICAL RACE & ETHNIC STUDIES / Lisa Lowe, Jack Halberstam & Chandan Reddy / “Perverse Modernities: Conversations in Critical Race and Ethnic Studies” / 3:00-7:00pm / Humanities 2, Room 259\n\nPerverse Modernities transgresses modern divisions of knowledge that have historically separated the consideration of sexuality, and its concern with desire, gender, bodies, and performance, on the one hand, from the consideration of race, colonialism, and political economy, on the other, in order to explore how the mutual implication of race, colonialism, and sexuality has been rendered perverse and unintelligible within the logics of modernity.\n\nBooks in the series have elaborated such perversities in the challenge to modern assumptions about historical narrative and the nation-state, the epistemology of the human sciences, the continuities of the citizen-subject and civil society, the distinction between health and morbidity, and the rational organization of that society into separate spheres. Perverse modernities, in this sense, have included queer of color and queer anticolonial subcultures, racialized sexualized laborers migrating from the global south to the metropolis, nonwestern desires and bodies and their incommensurability with the gendered, national or communal meanings attributed to them, and analyses of the refusals of normative domestic “healthy” life narratives by subjects who inhabit and perform sexual risk, different embodiments, and alternative conceptions of life and death. The project also highlights intellectual “perversities” from disciplinary infidelities and epistemological promiscuity, to theoretical irreverence and heterotopic imaginings.\n\n(top)\n\nThursday, May 21 / LIVING WRITER SERIES / Eleni Sikelianos & Josef Sikelianos / 6:00-7:45pm / Humanities Lecture Hall, Room 206\n\nEleni Sikelianos believes in redistributing wealth (top to bottom) and in the overturning of Citizens United.

It is also about the ways in which the logic of drone warfare: prediction and pre-emption, come to characterize a wide realm of social practices: marketing, job screening, health care, romance, and more. The presentation considers the ways in which some contemporary strands of critical theory replicate and rehearse the logics of data-driven droning: the advent of drone theory.\n\nMark Andrejevic is an Associate Professor of Media Studies at Pomona College. He researches the relationship between popular culture, interactive media, and surveillance. His books include, Reality TV: The Work of Being Watched (2004), iSpy: Surveillance and Power in the Interactive Era (2007), and Infoglut: How Too Much Information is Changing The Way We Think and Know (2013). He examines the social and cultural implications of data mining, predictive analytics, and other forms of surveillance that have become integral to how subjects interact with digital media and popular culture.\n\n(top)\n\nMonday, May 11 / SIKH & PUNJABI STUDIES / Dr. Jasjit Singh / “Diasporic Religious Identity in Emerging Adulthood: The Case of British Sikhs” / 12:00-2:00pm / Humanities 1, Room 210\n\nMonday, May 11 / DIRECTIONS IN DIGITAL HUMANITIES / Fabiola Hanna / “Digital Humanities Working Group / Work-in-Progress Conversation Aesthetics: Imagining Histories of Modern Lebanon, Fabiola Hanna” / 12:15-1:30pm / Humanities 1, Room 202\n\nMonday, May 11 / FILM + DIGITAL MEDIA / Public Screening of “One Summer” / 7:00pm / Communications 150, Studio C\n\nWednesday, May 13 / ANTHROPOLOGY COLLOQUIA / Dr. Alexander S.

Using ethnographic methods including the first ever large scale online survey of British Sikhs, this paper explores the shift which has occurred for many young South Asians in Diaspora who now identify more closely with a religious as opposed to an ethnic identity. Focusing on a number of different arenas of religious transmission including families, religious institutions and the internet, this paper examines how processes of religious socialisation and familial nurture impact on identity, in particular among young people entering the phase of ‘Emerging Adulthood’ (Arnett 2004).\n\nDr Jasjit Singh is a research fellow at the University of Leeds based in the School of Philosophy, Religion and the History of Science. His research examines the religious lives of South Asians with a particular focus on understanding processes of religious and cultural transmission among Sikhs in diaspora and the different arenas in which this transmission occurs. To date he has examined the relationship between traditional arenas of religious learning (including the family environment and religious institutions) and newer arenas of transmission including camps, University faith societies and the Internet. He has recently undertaken a project examining the cultural value of South Asian arts and has a growing interest in the role of religious media.\n\n(top)\n\nMonday, May 11 / DIRECTIONS IN DIGITAL HUMANITIES / Fabiola Hanna / “Digital Humanities Working Group / Work-in-Progress Conversation Aesthetics: Imagining Histories of Modern Lebanon, Fabiola Hanna” / 12:15-1:30pm / Humanities 1, Room 202\n\nHanna will present her recent work, We are History: A People’s History of Lebanon, a digital interface that collects varied oral histories of a people and presents them in a disruptive but dialogical manner. Using contemporary oral histories about the 1981 siege of Zahle, Lebanon, the software is given the goal of generating a narrative from the transcripts of said oral histories.\n\nFabiola Hanna is a new media artist, software designer and activist currently using her skills to address historical amnesia in Lebanon. She is a PhD candidate at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where she also gained her MFA in Digital Arts and New Media. Her research lies in software studies, new media art activism, and archives and memory.

In tracing a woman’s efforts to find her husband and to understand why the police took him away without explanation, the film portrays the sentiment of perpetual anxiety, uncertainty and vulnerability that prevails contemporary China.\n\nThe film was selected for the 19th Busan International Film Festival (Korea, October 2014 ) and the 21th Vesoul International Film Festival (France, February 2015), and was awarded the Jury’s Prize.\n\n“One Summer” follows Director Yang’s two documentaries, “Who is Haoran?” (2006), and “On the Road” (2010). “Who is Haoran?” was selected for the 59th Locarno International Film Festival, and the 31th Hong Kong International Film Festival. It has been collected by Songzhuang Art Center (a major base of Chinese independent cinema) and released by Lixianting Film fund.\n\n“On the Road” was selected for the 7th China Documentary Film festival, the 7th China Independent Film Festival, and 2011 Seoul Independent Documentary Film & Video Festival.\n\nDirector Yang Yishu represents an important voice in contemporary independent Chinese cinema. In addition to making films, she also teaches as Associate Professor and serves as Associate Director of Film and Video Production Center in the Department of Drama, Film & TV, in the School of Liberal Arts at Nanjing University, China.\n\n(top)\n\nWednesday, May 13 / ANTHROPOLOGY COLLOQUIA / Dr. Alexander S. Dent / 3:15-5:00pm / Social Sciences 1, Room 261\n\nAlexander Dent’s work uses notions of performativity to analyze mediation, language, policy, piracy, Intellectual Property (IP), and music. This essay uses confidence as a metric for contemporary capitalism, which relies upon aggressively propertizing, individuating, and consumption-oriented epistemologies. His argument is that market based logics often involve: a) unitary and materialistic theories of economic actors, goods, and services on the one hand; and b) the notion that these actors, goods, and services are not only highly symbolic, but also deeply multivalent on the other.\n\nHis first book, River of Tears: Country Music, Memory, and Modernity (Duke, 2009) explored the dialogic relationship between traditional and commercial forms of Brazilian `country` as a way of getting at late capitalist rurality. More current work investigates the ways in which IP policing seeks to control the unruly materializations at work in digital reproduction, as well as the ways in which the United States Trade Representative’s practices delimit the “publics” in “public interest.” Dent received his PhD from the University of Chicago (2003). He lives in Washington DC, where he is a practicing musician.\n\n(top)\n\nThursday, May 14 / LIVING WRITER SERIES / Dawn Lundy Martin / 6:00-7:45pm / Humanities Lecture Hall, Room 206\n\nDawn Lundy Martin is co-founder of the Third Wave Foundation in New York, a national grant making organization led by young women and transgender youth, which focuses on social justice activism.

Schneider / “Indigenous Hinterlands in Colonial San Francisco Bay Area, California” / 3:15-5:00pm / Social Sciences, Room 261\n\nFrom 1776 to the 1830s, Native people throughout California entered or resisted Spanish missions. For the San Francisco Bay area, resistance often involved running away, approved furloughs administered by some padres, and other thoughtful departures that reactivated threatened places and practices. Following the mission period, Native people continued to meaningfully construct places while also contributing to new economic opportunities emerging across a shifting colonial landscape. This talk presents ongoing archaeological, historical, and collections-based research directed at identifying and investigating such places and practices, including sites of refuge and the opportunities that emerged along coastal Marin County during the 1840s and afterward.\n\n(top)\n\nWednesday, May 6 / SCIENCE & JUSTICE / Ruha Benjamin & Charis Thompson / “Good Science/People’s Science: An Exploration of Science and Justice” / 1:00-4:00pm / University Center, Alumni Room\n\nAs part of the Science and Justice Research Center’s efforts to develop analytics for understanding and enacting ‘science and justice,’ we will be hosting a half-day long symposium that features the work of Charis Thompson (Chancellor’s Professor and Chair of Gender & Women’s Studies, UC Berkeley) and Ruha Benjamin (Assistant Professor in the Center for African American Studies, Princeton University).

Data in humanities research is not new; it is the capacity of new technology to do more with data that creates a sense of difference, possibility, and even anxiety. This talk will begin by looking at centuries-old treatment of data in the humanities, and explore how humanists are rediscovering the data in their corporations.\n\nDr. Patrick Murray-John is a Research Assistant Professor and Omeka Developer Manager at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. He has a B.S. in Mathematics from Iowa State University, and an M.A. in English Literature and Ph.D. in Anglo-Saxon Literature from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Besides helping to develop Omeka, he uses it and other tools to experiment with making data part of public humanities projects. A recent project of his, the US Museums Explorer, an Omeka site built on data released by the Institute for Museum and Library Services, was recently cited as an example of using open data in the Center For the Future of Museums’ “Trends Watch 2015″.\n\nThis event is targeted to tool developers, researchers, librarians, archivists, instructors, and graduate students from across the UC system. The event is open to all interested and will be especially of interest to those already working in Omeka to develop digital asset libraries, curate research material, teach visual arts, or cultivate digital literacies.\n\n(top)\n\nThursday, May 7 / LIVING WRITER SERIES / Jared Harvey, Gabriela Ramirez-Chavez, Whitney De Vos, Nicholas James Whittington, Eric Sneathen / 6:00-7:45pm / Humanities Lecture Hall, Room 206\n\nJared Harvey is a an author of several chapbooks, including Commuting: Have Gone to Ithaca. – Frank Quitely, Hosni Mubarak, Mammal, and his most recent chapbook Here You Are (co-authored with Sara Peck.\n\nGabriela Ramirez-Chavez is a Guatemalan-American poet originally from Los Angeles, California.

Novarro, the subject of Professor Chávez’s current book project, was perhaps best known for playing the title role in the 1925 version of Ben-Hur, which propelled him to stardom. The bulk of his career occurred at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and after his stardom waned, he continued to act in movies and television until his violent murder at the hands of a hustler in 1968. The manner of his death ensured that he was outed posthumously. Yet, if one reads interviews with him and letters that he wrote to friends, queer codes that deflected his homosexuality emerge. Such is the case with the 102 letters that he wrote to Bay Area arts philanthropist Noël Sullivan. The letters, which are housed at UC Berkeley’s Bancroft Library, are the basis of this talk. In these missives, Novarro expressed his devout Catholicism to Sullivan, who was both gay and Catholic. The letters provide insight into a platonic relationship between two gay men in the early to mid-twentieth century and allow us to glimpse an intimacy that was mitigated by religiosity, but that nonetheless had at its core a common homosexuality.\n\nErnesto Chávez, Associate Professor of History at the University of Texas, El Paso, is currently a Visiting Researcher at the UCLA Chicano Studies Research Center and Institute of American Cultures. His work intersects Chicano/a, Latino/a, and Borderlands History and examines the history of the American Southwest, focusing on the matrix of race, class, and sexuality throughout the ethnic Mexican and Latino American past. In 2014, he received the American Historical Association’s Equity Award.\n\n(top)\n\nWednesday, April 22 / SCIENCE AND JUSTICE / “Fixing the Pathological Body” / 4:00-6:00pm / Engineering 2, Room 399\n\nThe medical industry leans heavily upon a distinction between the “normal” and the “pathological.” Panelists Janette Dinishak (Assistant Professor of Philosophy, UCSC) Kelly Ormond (Professor of Genetics, Stanford School of Medicine) and Matthew Wolf-Meyer (Associate Professor of Anthropology, UCSC) will discuss how we continue to define pathology, and what work this sort of categorization produces. We will discuss alternative ways to organize and understand the lived experiences of human bodies and/or minds.\n\n(top)\n\nThursday, April 23 / SOCIOLOGY COLLOQUIA / Bron Taylor / “Spirituality After Darwin: ‘Dark Green’ Nature Religion and the Future of Religion and Nature” / 12:00-1:45pm / College 8, Room 201\n\nNew Religions come and go but some persist and become major global forces. In this presentation Professor Taylor presents evidence that, especially since Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species in 1859, a new, global, earth religion has been rapidly spreading around the world. Whether it involves conventional religious beliefs in non- material divine beings, or is entirely naturalistic and involves no such beliefs, it considers nature to be sacred, imbued with intrinsic value, and worthy of reverent care. Those having affinity with such spirituality generally have strong feelings of belonging to nature, express kinship with non-human organisms, and understand the world to be deeply interconnected. In a recent book Taylor labeled such phenomena ‘dark green religion’, noting that its central ethical priority is to defend the earth’s biocultural diversity. Taylor provides a wide variety of examples of new forms of religious (and religion-resembling) cultural innovation among those promoting such nature spirituality, from individuals (including artists, scientists, filmmakers, photographers, surfers, and environmental activists), to institutions (including museums, schools, and the United Nations). By tracking these, Taylor provides an opportunity to consider what such spirituality may portend for the religious and planetary future.\n\nBron Taylor is Professor of Religion, Nature, and Environmental Ethics at the University of Florida, and a Carson Fellow of the Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society in Munich Germany.\n\n(top)\n\nThursday, April 23 / LIVING WRITER SERIES / Terri Witek & Jai Arun Ravine / 6:00-7:45pm / Humanities Lecture Hall, Room 206\n\nTerri Witek is the author of Exit Island, The Shipwreck Dress (both Florida Book Award medalists), Carnal World, Fools and Crows, Courting Couples (Winner of the 2000 Center for Book Arts Contest), First Shot at Fort Sumter/ Possum (a poetry/comics chapzine) and Robert Lowell and LIFE STUDIES: Revising the Self.

How was it created? An Uncommon Place traces decisive moments in the site’s early development. Here an innovative educational project engaged with a beautiful and challenging environment. The university took shape among steep ravines and dramatic trees in a way that respected as it transformed the landscape. Using architectural plans, photographs, and oral histories, the exhibition illustrates paths taken and not taken-decisions, constraints, and hopes. It celebrates the achievement of UCSC’s founding planners while analyzing the tensions and contradictions that were built into their project. Through its many subsequent transformations, the UC Santa Cruz campus remains an extraordinary work of environmental art.\n\nRemembering these formative years can perhaps help us renew a powerful utopian experiment. At UC Santa Cruz, architecture and environment still conspire to create an uncommon place, a setting for teaching, research and imagination outside the bounds of the ordinary.\n\nSponsored by UCSC Alumni Association; Divisions of the Arts, Humanities, Physical and Biological Sciences, Social Sciences; Colleges: Cowell, Eight, Kresge, Oakes, Porter, and Stevenson; McHenry Library Special Collections & Archives; and University Relations.\n\nIn conjunction with An Uncommon Place exhibition, the Sesnon Gallery also presents, Rhythms of Place: Photographic Explorations of the UCSC Campus.\n\n(top)\n\nSaturday, April 25 / LITERATURE DEPARTMENT – ALUMNI WEEKEND / “Celebrating 50 Years of Literature” / 11:00am-1:00pm / Kresge College, Room 327\n\nIn order to celebrate our tradition of working and teaching across national, linguistic, and disciplinary divides, the UCSC Literature Department is pleased host “50 Years of Literature at UCSC”, an event commemorating the achievement of Literature alumni and faculty.

By the end of the 1970s, Dalit literature was recognized as a distinctive category of Marathi literature; newspapers and magazines devoted special supplements to discuss it and the Marathi literature Department of Bombay University hired faculty teaching Dalit literature. Three recurring themes of Marathi Dalit literature suggest the spatial entanglements that produced it: a) the revolutionary transformation of the self and society, a theme that borrowed from and resonated with the desire for revolutionary change across the world in the 1960s and 70s b) the depiction of housing as a symbol of Dalit marginality which this paper puts in the context of the urban transformation of Bombay city in which slums were an eyesore, but a political-economic necessity c) the representation of villages and Dalits in villages as the subject of backwardness that needed to be transformed with the raising of political consciousness. The themes of revolution, urban built environment, and rural/agrarian transformation also reflect the entanglements of spatial scales – global, regional/national, and urban/rural that shaped Dalit lives in Bombay city. In other words, the paper argues that the social space of Dalit literature in this period was shaped by events and processes that had different temporalities that were articulated in the city at the time of significant projects of urban transformation and regional and global political-economic change. I elucidate this point through the study of literature, housing reports, newspapers, and pamphlets.\n\n(top)\n\nWednesday, April 15 / VISUAL AND MEDIA CULTURES COLLOQUIA / Thomas Poell / “Social Media Mechanisms” / 4:00-6:00pm / Porter College, Room D245\n\nThomas Poell is Assistant Professor of New Media and Digital Culture at the University of Amsterdam.

Still, while it is a cliche to say that Muslim women are not a monolith, there is a tendency for many outside of Muslim contexts to seek a single solution to address this inequality.\n\nThis presentation will give a critical reading of Muslim women’s reform movements with emphasis on the historical evolution and epistemological distinctions of three major perspectives: secular Muslim women, Islamist women and the rise of Islamic feminists. While this could be seen as a dynamic history it is relatively short history and still unfolding. Islamic feminism is a pro-faith/pro-feminist movement to construct knowledge about Islamic thought and to use that construction to challenge patriarchal authority. This knowledge construction challenges policies that oppress women in the name of Islam and hopes to transform Muslim cultures from inequality to justice and reciprocity. In particular, this presentation will discuss Dr. Wadud’s experiences as a resource scholar with Musawah, a global movement for reform in Muslim family law.\n\nDr. Amina Wadud is an African American scholar of gender and Islam with a focus on Qur’an exegesis. She has taught at the Islamic University of Malaysia, the Virginia Commonwealth University, and the Gadjah Mada University of Indonesia. Her first book, Qur’an and Woman: Rereading the Sacred Text from a Woman’s Perspective (1999), contributes a gender-inclusive reading to one of the most fundamental disciplines in Islamic thought, Qu’ranic exegesis. Her latest book, Inside the Gender Jihad: Women’s Reform in Islam (2006) continues her Qur’anic analysis but also provides extensive details about her experiences as a Muslim, wife, mother, sister, scholar, and activist.\n\n(top)\n\nFriday, April 17 / FRIDAY FORUM FOR GRADUATE RESEARCH / Evan Grupsmith / “Revolutionary Movement: Class Based Inclusion and Exclusion in the Cultural Revolution Chuanlian Movement” / 12:00-1:30pm / Humanities 1, Room 202\n\nIn late 1966, young people started to traverse the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to exchange revolutionary experiences. To encourage and direct Red Guard travel, the Cultural Revolution Small Group (the highest governmental authority during this time period) decreed that all “revolutionary students and teachers and Red Guards” would be able to travel for free in the PRC. Millions of people jumped at this opportunity and traveled all over the country. This movement was dubbed chuanlian (串连). Chuanlian was one of the dominant political activities for urban youth in the PRC. Grupsmith’s research shows, through looking at both state and first-person accounts, that the chuanlian movement was driven by interactions of autonomous Red Guards and the state (exemplified by state media and the Cultural Revolution Small Group). Chuanlian activities were initiated by autonomously acting Red Guards. The state reacted by encouraging the movement and channeling it through propaganda and provision of free travel and lodging, while simultaneously attempting to exclude those that had “bad” class backgrounds. State encouragement caused a drastic increase in Red Guard chuanlian activity. Red Guards largely rejected these class based exclusionary policies, and the movement was characterized by widespread cross-class participation.\n\nThe Friday Forum is a graduate-run colloquium dedicated to the presentation and discussion of graduate student research.

Unlike automated or algorithmic technologies that record extant sites and artifacts, building a three-dimensional computer model of an ephemeral or long-demolished environment combines traditional historical methods with new technologies and results in an entirely new form of scholarly publication. Rather than a printed monograph, the hours spent in search of obscure details buried in primary source materials or pouring over archival manuscripts and photographs are transformed into an interactive learning environment for interrogation by students and secondary scholars. Using her computer reconstruction of the World’s Columbian Exposition of 1893 as a case study, Snyder will address the process of researching and reconstructing historic urban environments, the challenges of translating multi-media research materials into a cohesive computer model, and the opportunities for teaching and learning afforded by this new form of scholarship. (And, yes, obsession will be discussed.)\n\nLisa M.

Every great hero, from Heracles to Achilles, tangled with warrior queens, and Theseus captured and married the Amazon Antiope. Were Amazons mere figments of the Greek imagination? Combining classical myth and art, nomad traditions, and scientific archaeology, this lecture reveals intimate, surprising details and original insights about the fighting women known as Amazons, with a special focus on Antiope.\n\nAdrienne Mayor’s most recent book is The Amazons: Lives and Legends of Warrior Women Across the Ancient World (Princeton 2014).

To examine the long-term effect of the insurgency on education, we use a large scale cross-sectional dataset – the 2005 India Human Development Survey. To explore the channels through which the conflict affected education, we use a unique historical dataset on the annual expenditure decisions by farmers (farm account surveys) for Punjab during 1978-1989. We combine both datasets with the annual district level data on major terrorist incidents from the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP). We find a substantial and statistically significant effect of terrorism on educational attainment by girls who were of school age during the conflict. We also identify the impact of terrorism at the household level. Households that had high ratios of girls to boys and who resided in the districts that experienced terrorist events, had reduced the amount of educational expenditures. This finding suggests that this reduction was one of the channels through which conflict affected education.\n\nPrakarsh Singh is Assistant Professor of Economics at Amherst College, Massachusetts.

In what ways can the law be said to decorate a body, and what does it mean to recognize legal personhood as being indebted to a sartorial imagination? This talk juxtaposes a significant but little known nineteenth-century immigration case and a much more celebrated nineteenth-century photo archive as two “primal” moments in the collusion between law, visuality, race, and gender and argues that the juridical making of the raced body is also the moment in which that body disappears. This is, in short, a story about the critical shift in law and in visual culture from racialized visibility to racialized visuality, a turn that takes place as early as the nineteenth century and continues to impact how we think about race and visuality today.\n\nAnne Anlin Cheng is Professor of English and the Center for African American Studies and Director for the Program in American Studies at Princeton University.

How was it created? An Uncommon Place traces decisive moments in the site’s early development. Here an innovative educational project engaged with a beautiful and challenging environment. The university took shape among steep ravines and dramatic trees in a way that respected as it transformed the landscape. Using architectural plans, photographs, and oral histories, the exhibition illustrates paths taken and not taken-decisions, constraints, and hopes. It celebrates the achievement of UCSC’s founding planners while analyzing the tensions and contradictions that were built into their project. Through its many subsequent transformations, the UC Santa Cruz campus remains an extraordinary work of environmental art.\n\nRemembering these formative years can perhaps help us renew a powerful utopian experiment. At UC Santa Cruz, architecture and environment still conspire to create an uncommon place, a setting for teaching, research and imagination outside the bounds of the ordinary.\n\nExhibition Dates: Wednesday, April 8, 2015 – Saturday, May 9, 2015\n\nAlumni Weekend: Sesnon Reception at Porter koi pond and Curators’ walkthrough, April 24, 4-6PM\n\nAlumni Weekend campus walk with curators: April 25, 2:15 PM, meet at Cowell College\n\nSponsored by UCSC Alumni Association; Divisions of the Arts, Humanities, Physical and Biological Sciences, Social Sciences; Colleges: Cowell, Eight, Kresge, Oakes, Porter, and Stevenson; McHenry Library Special Collections & Archives; and University Relations.\n\nIn conjunction with An Uncommon Place exhibition, The Sesnon Gallery also presents, Rhythms of Place: Photographic Explorations of the UCSC Campus.\n\n(top)\n\nThursday, April 9 / ANCIENT STUDIES / Yannis Galanakis / “The Diplomat, the Dealer and the Digger: Writing the History of the Antiquities Trade in 19th century Greece” / 4:30-7:00pm / Humanities 1, Room 210\n\nDuring the 19th century in Europe, new states were founded and nationalism and colonialism were strengthened; while some Empires disintegrated, others managed to maintain or even increase their power. At the same time, archaeology was transformed into a structured discipline and large-scale excavation projects commenced across the Mediterranean. The stories of the people behind the antiquities trade in Greece during the 19th century—the diplomats stationed in Athens, the local art dealers and the private diggers—help us write an important chapter in the social, economic, and cultural history of Europe and of Mediterranean archaeology as a whole. This lecture explores how the commodification of the past became interwoven with power politics and gave rise both to different attitudes toward collecting and to debates on cultural property, ownership and the value of things in our modern world.\n\nYannis Galanakis is Lecturer in Classics (Greek Prehistory), Faculty of Classics, University of Cambridge Fellow and Director of Studies in Classics, Sidney Sussex College.\n\nFor more information, please contact hedrick@ucsc.edu\n\n(top)\n\nFriday, April 10 / DEPARTMENT OF LANGUAGES AND APPLIED LINGUISTICS / “An Evening of Futuristic Musical Poetry with Luciano Chessa” / 5:00-6:00pm / Humanities 2, Room 259\n\nAn evening with Italian composer, performer, and musicologist Luciano Chessa.

Her worldview as intellectual, lesbian of color, poet, teacher privileges the knowledge that comes from experiencing life in-between spaces—the border dweller, the queer, the colored, and the mestiza. Embracing ambiguity, liminality and border thinking, Anzaldúa affirms life from within these spaces. Her call for women of color, particularly lesbians of color, to write, engage and interrogate the world, challenges the hegemony of knowledge production and categorical logic. The movement of U.S. third world feminists that Anzaldúa initiates centers coalitional politics and intersectional analysis of the lived experiences of women of color, yet there continues to be a problem of legibility, a misrecognition and appropriation of the theoretical contributions of these writers (Perez, 2010). The issue of legibility deflects scholars’ attention from engaging Anzaldúan thought in the critical ways that it deserves.\n\n(top)\n\nMonday, March 9 / FILM + DIGITAL MEDIA VISITING ARTIST SERIES / Caroline Martel / “Wavemakers” / 7:00pm / Communications 150 (Studio C)\n\nWednesday, March 11 / EDUCATION DEPARTMENT / Funie Hsu / “The Coloniality of the English-Only Movement: Race, Language, and Power” / 12:00-1:45pm / McHenry 0266 (Ground Floor)\n\nThursday, March 12 / SIKH AND PUNJABI STUDIES / Baagi & Hoodini / Sikh Rappers & Social Justice / 6:00-7:30pm / Humanities 1, Room 210\n\nFriday, March 13 / FRIDAY FORUM FOR GRADUATE RESEARCH / Jessica Calvanico / “Collections of Subjections” / 12:00-1:30pm / Humanities 1, Room 202\n\nSaturday, March 14 / SHAKESPEARE WORKSHOP / “Shakespeare and Music” / 1:00-4:30pm / Digital Arts Research Center (DARC) Dark Lab, Room 108\n\n* To advertise your unit or department’s event in the “Of Interest” section of this weekly bulletin, please e-mail complete event information in text format (no PDFs) to cult@ucsc.edu no later than noon on Friday of the prior week.\n\n* Additional information and regular updates on many “Of Interest” events can be found on the IHR website.\n\nOF-INTEREST EVENT DESCRIPTIONS:\n\nMonday, March 9 / FILM + DIGITAL MEDIA VISITING ARTIST SERIES / Caroline Martel / “Wavemakers” / 7:00pm / Communications 150 (Studio C)\n\nCaroline Martel has been synthesizing documentary theory and practice for over a decade, with a special interest in archives, invisible histories, and audio/visual technologies and heritage.

Drawing from a combination of memos from colonial administrators, reports of the War Department, educational reports, political cartoons and other primary sources, this talk pays special attention to the historical cases of settler and overseas colonialism as enacted through English instruction policies directed for Native American, Filipino, and Puerto Rican populations. It concludes with a discussion of the implications of coloniality and the English-Only movement and highlights the need for anti-colonial and liberatory English instruction practices.\n\nFunie Hsu, Ph.D. is a University of California President’s Postdoctoral Fellow at the UC Davis School of Education.

Baagi is one of the few artists to rap exclusively in Panjabi. Born and raised in Bombay until moving to Los Angeles in his early teens, Baagi brings a unique perspective both to Hip-Hop and to the evolution of Punjabi culture. A childhood passion for composing Punjabi poetry coupled with his love for Hip-Hop eventually turned an after-school hobby into a career of expression. This artist uses Farsi, Hindi and Panjabi vocabulary to add a new voice to the musical conglomerate. Baagi uses his platform to paint pictures of social issues, easygoing personal anecdotes, and day-to-day experiences, as seen through the lens of a young man influenced by the intersections of many worlds. His debut album, titled Baagi Di Vaari, is available for free download at http://beabaagi.bandcamp.com. You can follow him on Twitter @BaagiMedia.\n\nHoodini—Hoodini, also known as Hoodeez the Hindoo, has been hailed as “one of the most lyrical and charismatic emcees of South Asian descent” by critics. The poet and Hip-Hop artist combines witty wordplay, lyrical agility, and keen storytelling to present a novel narrative to his audience with natural ease. In listening to a Hoodini record, you may easily find yourself migrating from a commentary on issues of race relations to a jaunty reminiscence of a past love interest, often within the same verse. Hoodeez has released four studio albums to date and has shared the stage with notable Hip-Hop artists including Blu, Pacific Division, Skeme, and RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan.

Ghadarites called for and attempted the overthrow of British colonial rule in India during WWI, seeking a caste-free, secular and independent Indian nation. Ghadar was overwhelmingly initiated by and composed of Sikh laborers from the North American West and became a worldwide movement drawn from people of all castes and religions. San Francisco was home to the movement’s public office and its weekly newspaper, Ghadar, and has often been logged as the movement’s birthplace, especially by historians of the North American West. But remote Astoria, Oregon holds this distinction. Drawing on Indian historical accounts, oral histories and Oregon archival materials, Ms. Ogden both repopulates the East Indian community in Oregon and traces reasons for and key moments in Ghadar’s seemingly unlikely genesis there. Her larger interest, however, is exploring the dis-remembering of East Indians in Oregon and the window it provides into the targeting of Arabs, Muslims and South Asians in post-9/11 America.\n\nJohanna Ogden is an independent historian and activist from Oregon. In 2013 she initiated and was the consulting historian for Astoria’s two-day Ghadar Party Centenary Commemoration and in 2014 participated in an international conference on Ghadar in Chandigarh, Punjab. Her most recent publications include the award-winning “Ghadar, Historical Silences & Notions of Belonging” Oregon Historical Quarterly, Summer 2012; “Ghadar’s Oregon Roots,” The Ghadar Movement: Background, Ideology, Action and Legacies (Punjabi Uni: 2013). She is presently writing a book about Ghadar’s roots in Oregon for the University of Washington Press.\n\n(top)\n\nWednesday, March 4 / FILM + DIGITAL MEDIA WEDNESDAY NIGHT CINEMA / “The Creators of Shopping Worlds” / 7:00pm / Studio C (Communications 150)\n\nTHE CREATORS OF SHOPPING WORLDS (2001, 72 min.)\n\nBrave new shopping worlds are being created. What have mall owners, architects, surveillance technicians, and supermarket workers done to turn human subjects into pure streams of consumers, into the perfect inhabitants of shopping mall paradise?\n\n“…Going to the supermarket is an exercise in predestination: research has proven, as we learn in The Creators of Shopping Worlds, that, “Customers orient themselves horizontally… and vertically they look for a specific item.” The mall planners and bread-display architects seen at work in Harun Farocki’s doc take on the sinister air of a worldwide conspiracy.” –Jessica Winter, Village Voice, October 31st, 2001\n\n(top)\n\nWednesday, March 4 / DIRECTIONS IN DIGITAL HUMANITIES / Antonella Guidazzoli / “Open Virtual Heritage Applications: From Research Tools to Emotional and Participatory Virtual Spaces” / 5:00-7:00pm / Humanities 1, Room 210\n\nAntonella Guidazzoli, CINECA Supercomputer Center, Bologna Italy, leads research services for the 3D Virtual Information Research Lab at Italy’s supercomputer center in Bologna, CINECA, a non-profit consortium comprising 69 Italian universities, two national research centers, and the Ministry of Universities and Research.

Euphorbiaceae). From 2004 to 2006 he was a masters student in the Program in Philosophy of Science also at UNAM. There he wrote his master thesis focusing on the philosophical problems of phylogenetic reconstruction. His masters thesis won two prizes: the Norman Sverdlin prize for best philosophy thesis in 2006, and the UNAM prize medal “Alfonso Caso.”He started his doctorate in the same program in 2006. In his dissertation, he analyzed homosexuality in the context of philosophical accounts of mechanistic explanation and biopower. He successfully defended (with honors) his dissertation in November 2010: La homosexualidad a la luz de la filosofía de la ciencia: Mecanismos biologicos, subjetividad y poder (Homosexuality in Light of the Philosophy of Science: Biological Mechanisms, Subjectivity, and Power).\n\nFabrizzio is currently an assistant professor in the Department of Interdisciplinary Studies at UNAM.\n\n(top)\n\nThursday, March 5 / LIVING WRITERS SERIES / Maceo Montoya / 6:00-7:45pm / Humanities Lecture Hall, Room 206\n\nMaceo Montoya grew up in Elmira, California.
