        "text": "The master's program in classics at Tufts is designed for students who wish to go beyond the bachelor's level to attain a broader and deeper knowledge of the classics for one or more of the following purposes: teaching, further graduate study, digital technology, or publishing. With its strong language component and faculty strength in literature, history, archaeology, and digital humanities, this program particularly suits those who want either to consolidate and improve their language, research, and teaching skills in preparation for a PhD degree at another institution or to teach classics at the secondary level.\n\nBelow are requirements and policies for three possible tracks to the MA in Classics degree:\n\nMA in Classics: Students in this program usually have an undergraduate degree in Classical Studies or a related discipline. Typically a two or three year program.\n\nMA in Classics One-Year Program: Designed for students with an undergraduate degree in Classics and a high level of experience in Greek and Latin.\n\nMA in Classics with Integrated Post-bacc: A three-year program designed for students wishing to pursue a graduate degree in classics, but who started classics late in their undergraduate career or did not have the opportunity to master Greek and Latin and other areas of classics.\n\nMA in Classics\n\nProgram Requirements and Policies\n\nCandidates must successfully complete ten graduate courses in Classical Studies. Candidates will usually have completed the equivalent of an undergraduate Latin or Greek major. If not, additional courses will be required for completion of the master's degree.\n\nReading knowledge of Latin or Greek and one modern foreign language (usually German or French) is tested by examination.\n\nTo demonstrate research and presentation, the candidate may submit for evaluation by a faculty committee either two qualifying papers (written for courses at Tufts and revised as necessary after completion of the course) or a thesis. The thesis normally counts as two of the required ten courses. Students usually find that writing a thesis takes a full term of uninterrupted work. An oral examination based on the qualifying papers or thesis is required.\n\nCourse Requirements\n\nTwo courses in upper-level Latin\n\nTwo courses in upper-level Greek\n\nOne course in History\n\nOne course Classical Archaeology\n\nFour additional courses in the Department of Classical Studies\n\nExams\n\nLatin translation\n\nGreek translation\n\nForeign language (usually German or French)\n\nA comprehensive written examination integrating course work with knowledge of the reading lists in Greek and Latin literature is required.\n\nProgram Objectives\n\nStudents will have developed the ability to conduct research and write a graduate level research paper and/or thesis.\n\nStudents will have developed broad knowledge of the Classical world including literature, history and/or archaeology as well as a deeper focus in a particular area relevant to student interest.\n\nStudents will have developed a strong competency in both Latin and Greek and have been exposed to new methods of learning and using the languages. (eg. Treebanking)\n\nStudents will have gained reading knowledge of a modern foreign language relevant to research in the field.\n\nStudents will have been exposed to new developments in the field of Classical studies.\n\nStudents will be prepared to go on to advanced graduate work and/or secondary school teaching.\n\nMA in Classics - One Year Program\n\nMany students who are well prepared for graduate study at the PhD level need a small amount of extra work in Latin, Greek, or graduate research to make their dossier as attractive as possible to a PhD program. As we offer many advanced language classes and directed research opportunities, the Tufts Department of Classical Studies is in an excellent position to serve such students. To demonstrate research and presentation, the candidate may submit for evaluation by a faculty committee either two qualifying papers (written for courses at Tufts and revised as necessary after completion of the course) or a thesis. The thesis normally counts as two of the required ten courses. Students usually find that writing a thesis takes a full term of uninterrupted work. An oral examination based on the qualifying papers or thesis is required. This program is demanding and intensive, but offers the advantage of a compressed timeline and the flexibility of summer work. Prospective students are encouraged to consult with their advisors and the Tufts Director of Graduate Studies before applying.\n\nCourse Requirements\n\nA total of 30 credits are required\n\nLAT 132: Survey of Latin Literature, GK 131: Survey of Greek Literature\n\nAt least one LAT and one GK at the 100-level besides LAT 132, GK 132, GK 131\n\nCourse in ARCH/HIST at the 100â€™s level\n\nTimeline\n\nA total of two summers and one academic year of study are typically required to complete the program.\n\nFirst summer: CLS 196-197 (Study abroad, if appropriate), or other appropriate class offered in the summer. Online classes are available.\n\nAcademic year: coursework and exams\n\nSecond summer: thesis or classes\n\nExams\n\nLatin translation exam\n\nGreek translation exam\n\nForeign language (French or German)\n\nA comprehensive written examination integrating course work with knowledge of the reading lists in Greek and Latin literature is required.\n\nMA in Classics with Integrated Post-bacc\n\nA program intended to help student remedy gaps in languages, history, archaeology, and research experience while pursuing a graduate degree in classics.\n\nCoursework and Program Requirements\n\n3 classes per semester for three years for a total of 18 classes or equivalent credits\n\nLanguages: 1 Latin and 1 Greek class per semester of which two courses in upper-level Latin and two courses in upper-level Greek\n\nSix additional courses in the Department of Classical Studies\n\nTo demonstrate research and presentation, the candidate may submit for evaluation by a faculty committee either two qualifying papers (written for courses at Tufts and revised as necessary after completion of the course) or a thesis. The thesis normally counts as two of the required ten courses. Students usually find that writing a thesis takes a full term of uninterrupted work.
