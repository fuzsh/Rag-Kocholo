SoE students need to take four classes (12 credits) in the humanities/social sciences to graduate.\n\n** Chem 2 is required for all SoE majors except electrical and computer engineering.\n\n*** Chemistry lab (Introduction to Experimentation 01:160:171) may be taken in first or second semester. Chemistry recitation cannot substitute for a chemistry lab.\n\n**** It is RECOMMENDED that students take one lower level H/SS elective (see Electives tab above for course list) each semester. Electives may be completed at any time before graduation.\n\nThe Engineering General Education courses include the common first-year courses and some additional courses taken throughout sophomore, junior, and senior years.\n\nNote: Students are expected to complete first-year courses in the first year and sophomore-level courses in the second year. If students leave a first or second year course until later, it causes scheduling conflicts and other issues that may delay graduation, which the deans and advisors will not be able to fix.\n\n01:355:101: College Writing\n\n01:640:151: Calculus 1\n\n01:640:152: Calculus 2\n\n01:640:251: Multivariable Calculus\n\n01:640:244: Differential Equations\n\n01:750:123/124: Analytical Physics 1A/1B\n\n01:750:227/229: Analytical Physics 2A/Lab\n\n01:750:229: Analytical Physics 2B lab\n\n01:160:159: General Chemistry for Engineers 1\n\n01:160:160: General Chemistry for Engineers 2 (except for ECE major)\n\n01:160:171: Intro to Experimentation\n\n14:440:101: ID3EA I Introduction to Data-Driven Design for Engineering Applications\n\n14:440:102: ID3EA II Integrated Data-Driven Design for Engineering Applications\n\n14:440:221: Engineering Mechanics: Statics\n\n14:540:343: Engineering Economics\n\n4 Humanities/Social Science Electives (chosen from the H/SS list)\n\nAll first year students declare a major during the spring semester. Students will register for fall sophomore courses in association with the department of their chosen engineering major. When choosing your courses, you must declare a major. Major declaration is for first year students only. Students who transferred to Rutgers Engineering from a different school (internal or external) DO NOT need to declare a major.\n\nThe School of Engineering holds a number of events during the spring semester to help students decide on a major.\n\n14:440:100 Introduction to Engineering (1 credit) Brief overview of each of the specific fields of engineering offered as degree programs at the school. Describes the major fields of study, as well as the engineering profession in general. Graded Pass/No Credit.\n\n14:440:107 Methods of Inquiry for Engineers (E3) Study skills. A system of thinking strategies and critical and analytical thinking skills applicable across the engineering curriculum.\n\n14:440:125 Engineering Exploration (3 credits) Discipline based, engineering design, project course for first-year engineering students.\n\n14:440:127 Introduction to Computers for Engineers (3 credits) Introduction to MATLAB, a powerful programming package for engineers and scientists. Students will learn the fundamentals of MATLAB, how to write programs in MATLAB, and how to solve engineering problems using MATLAB. Emphasis on problem-solving skills and mathematical tools of importance in engineering. Prerequisite: Some prior programming experience is preferred.\n\n14:440:191 Honors Introduction to Engineering I (3 credits) Covers the same material as 14:440:100 but in a more thorough and demanding fashion. Open only to honors program participants.\n\n14:440:221 Engineering Mechanics: Statics (3 credits) Classification of systems of forces and their resultants; geometrical and analytical conditions for the equilibrium of force systems; frames and trusses; friction; parabolic and catenary cables; centers of gravity. Prerequisites: 01:640:151 or 153 or 191; and 01:750:115 or 123 or 203.\n\n14:440:222 Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics (3 credits) Kinematics of particles and rigid bodies; rectangular, path, and polar descriptions. Relative motion. Kinetics of particles, particle systems, and rigid bodies; equations of motion, principles of work and energy, linear and angular impulse and momentum. Impact. Prerequisites: 01:640:152 or 154 or 192 or 50:640:122 or 21:640:136; and 14:440:221 or 291; and 01:750:124 (or equivalent).\n\n14:440:291 Honors Engineering Mechanics: Statics (3 credits) Covers the same material as 14:440:221 but in a more thorough and demanding fashion. Open only to honors program participants.\n\n14:440:292 Honors Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics (3 credits) Covers the same material as 14:440:222 but in a more thorough and demanding fashion. Open only to honors program participants.\n\n• Honors Calculus l, ll, lll\n\n• Honors Physics and Physics Lab\n\n• Introduction to Data-driven Design for Engineering Applications I, II\n\n• Honors Engineering Design & Development l, ll\n\n• Honors Statics/Dynamics\n\n• Exposition and Argument\n\nHonors students have several different course requirements in the first two years, particularly in math and science.\n\nDuring the first year of the undergraduate program, students register for the Honors Calculus sequence, Honors Physics and Laboratory, Exposition and Argument, and Honors Introduction to Engineering. Students are expected to achieve a \"B\" or better in each of the Honors courses to continue their registration in the program.\n\nDuring the second year, students will register for the second year courses in Honors Calculus, Honors Physics, and Honors Mechanics.\n\nHumanities/Social Science (H/SS) courses are generally non-technical in nature. Properly chosen, H/SS electives can complement your technical courses by helping you develop an understanding of the problems facing our society, a historical consciousness, a sense of values, knowledge of other cultures, an appreciation of the fine arts, and an ability to think logically and communicate effectively. Think seriously about your choices, and use them to enhance your educational experience. Engineering students are encouraged to complete a minor or even a second major in these disciplines.\n\nEconomics (3 credits) 14:540:343 Engineering Economics\n\nWriting (3 credits) 01:355:101 College Writing\n\nFour H/SS electives (12 credits) including at least 6 credits at the 200/300/400 level, chosen from the H/SS Electives list below\n\nIf you are interested in taking a non-technical course that is not on the H/SS Electives List, please submit a H/SS request. Please do not submit any courses in STEM subjects including, for example, accounting, biology, chemistry, engineering, environmental science, finance, geology, mathematics, physics, statistics, or courses with technical topics like data, analytics, technology, drafting. Please always check Degree Navigator or consult with your advising dean if you have any doubt about whether you have completed the H/SS & Economics requirement for engineering."
