COULSON & TONI M. CROSS AEGEAN EXCHANGE PROGRAM\n\nDEADLINE: March 15, 2024\n\nW.D.E. Coulson and Toni M. Cross Aegean Exchange Program is offered for Greek Ph.D. students and scholars in any field of the humanities and social sciences, from prehistoric to modern times, to conduct research in Turkey, under the auspices of the American Research Institute in Turkey (ARIT) in Ankara and/or Istanbul during the academic year. The purpose of these fellowships is to provide an opportunity for Greek scholars to meet with Turkish colleagues and to pursue research in museums, archives, and library collections and at the sites and monuments of Turkey. Fellowships are funded by the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs through the Council of American Overseas Research Centers, which also provides funding for Turkish graduate students and senior scholars to study in Greece, under the auspices of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens (Turkish applicants applying to study at the ASCSA should visit the ARIT website).\n\nThe ARIT library in Istanbul focuses on Ottoman and Byzantine Studies and the American Board of Missions. In Ankara, the library collections focus on Mediterranean and Near Eastern Archaeology. ARIT helps visiting researchers access the many Turkish (and other) libraries, archives, museums, sites accessible to visiting researchers. ARIT also supports research in fields outside of Turkish studies when significant materials are held in institutions within the country (e.g. Ottoman Egypt, Islamic studies, World War I history, various archaeological fields).\n\nEligibility: Greek nationals, including staff of the Ministry of Culture and Sport, doctoral candidates, and faculty members of Greek institutions of higher education.\n\nDuration: From two weeks to two months.\n\nTerms: Stipend of $250 per week plus up to $500 for travel expenses. Four to eight awards are available. ARIT, located in Istanbul and Ankara, will provide logistical support and other assistance as required, but projects are not limited to those two cities. For further information about ARIT: https://aritweb.org/. A final report to ASCSA and ARIT is due at the end of the award period, and ASCSA and ARIT expect that copies of all publications that result from research conducted as a Fellow of ASCSA/ARIT be contributed to the relevant library of ASCSA/ARIT.\n\nApplication: Submit an online application. The application includes a curriculum vitae, statement of the project to be pursued during the period of grant (up to three pages, single-spaced in length), a proposed timeline (including proposed dates of research) and budget, and two letters of reference from scholars in the field commenting on the value and feasibility of the project.\n\nApply Now\n\nWIENER LABORATORY POST-DOCTORAL RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP 2024-2027\n\nDEADLINE: January 15, 2024\n\nEligibility: The Post-Doctoral Fellowship is limited to individuals who have received their Ph.D. within the last seven (7) years. Preference will be given to studies related to ASCSA directed or affiliated project. Individuals who have received prior support as Pre-Doctoral Fellows must wait four (4) years before applying for a Post-Doctoral Fellowship. Former Research Associates must wait two (2) years before applying for a Post-Doctoral Fellowship.\n\nPurpose: To conduct research at the Malcolm H. Wiener Laboratory for Archaeological Science at the American School of Classical Studies at Athens that addresses substantive problems pertaining to the ancient Greek world and adjacent areas through the application of interdisciplinary methods in the archaeological sciences. Laboratory facilities are especially well-equipped to support the study of human skeletal biology, archaeobiological remains (faunal and botanical), environmental studies, geoarchaeology (particularly studies in human-landscape interactions and the study of site formation processes), and ancient materials studies.\n\nTerm: Three (3) years. Applicant is expected to be present at the Wiener Laboratory during the tenure of the appointment during each academic year (Sept.-June 1). This is a full-time research appointment; any concurrent employment during the academic year requires the permission of the Director of the School. Contributions to the Athens-based ASCSA community during the tenure of the appointment, in the form of seminars, colloquia, and workshops, participation in School field trips, or some combination of these and other activities, are encouraged.\n\nAt the conclusion of the fellowship the successful applicant is expected to have published or have made significant progress on the publication of two to three (2-3) peer-reviewed publications on research conducted during the tenure of the fellowship. All publications resulting from research supported by this fellowship (whether written during the tenure of the fellowship or afterward) must acknowledge the support received from the Malcolm H. Wiener Laboratory for Archaeological Sciences and list the laboratory as one of the affiliations of the researchers. The laboratory must also receive PDFs of all publications resulting from this support. Failure to comply with these requirements will negatively impact appeals for future support.\n\nThe recipients will be expected to submit progress reports on their work. Continued funding for the second and third year of the fellowship will be contingent upon the approval of the Wiener Laboratory.\n\nCompensation: Stipend of $35,000 plus waiver of School fees, each academic year.

Scarborough’s scholarship included philological works on Greek and Roman authors, as well as studies of African languages and African American folklore. His First Lessons in Greek (1881) was the first foreign language textbook by an African American author. He taught at Ohio’s Wilberforce University and Payne Theological Seminary, serving as Wilberforce’s president from 1908–1920. At least twice in his life (1886 and 1896), Scarborough hoped to attend the American School, with the encouragement of the School’s Managing Committee. Lack of funding, coupled with his many professional responsibilities, kept Scarborough from realizing his dream of going to Greece.\n\nEligibility: Open to graduate students, faculty members (K-12 and all levels of post-secondary education), and independent scholars residing in the United States or Canada (regardless of citizenship) whose geographic origin, diverse experiences, and socio-economic background are underrepresented at the School (including persons from the Black, Indigenous, and Persons of Color communities). The fellowship is designed for such applicants whose studies, research, or teaching would benefit from residency at the School. Fellowship recipients need not be specialists in the field of Classical Studies. The School welcomes applicants from faculty of K-12 schools and from students or faculty from public and private universities, colleges, and community colleges; and encourages applications from Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\n\nTerms and Duration: The fellowship supports up to three months in residence at the School to carry out proposed research projects, to join the School’s academic programs (field trips and seminars during the academic year, excavations at the Agora or Corinth, ASCSA summer travel programs, scientific field schools, etc.), and/or to develop knowledge, resources, and collegial networks to enhance their teaching.\n\nApplicants are encouraged to contact the Programs Administrator well in advance of submitting their proposal for advice on matching the resources and opportunities of the School to their needs and interests. Fellowship winners will be paired with ASCSA mentors who can assist them in planning and preparing for their time in Greece.\n\nApplicants intending to use the fellowship to participate in an ASCSA summer program must submit the Scarborough application AND a separate application to the relevant program(s) of interest. Applicants wishing to use the Scarborough fellowship to offset costs of participation in the Regular Member academic program of the School must also apply directly for Regular Membership (deadline Jan. 15, 2024); admission to the Regular Program requires that applicants write an examination in mid-February. The fellowship may not be held concurrently with Regular Member Fellowships. The fellowship may not be held remotely; residency in Athens is required.\n\nAwards granted in the January 2024 competition must be used between June 1, 2024 and May 30, 2025.\n\nEach award provides for $1500 per month (rounded upwards to the nearest whole month to a maximum of 3 month) as a stipend. The fellowship provides room and board at Loring Hall, a waiver of any applicable School fees (including summer program course fees), and one roundtrip economy-class airfare to Athens. Meals, Monday through Friday, are provided at Loring Hall for the fellow. The cost of participation on trips during the academic year is not covered (costs are billed in Athens after each trip). Meals or incidental expenses outside Loring Hall are not covered by the fellowship.\n\nThe School intends to make up to four awards each year.\n\nApplication: Submit an online application. A complete application will include:\n\nA 2-page, single-spaced, statement indicating your eligibility, describing the proposed use of the fellowship including any formal program at the School you plan to apply for, the proposed timeframe for your work at the School (this includes proposed dates of attendance), and your project or research goals (as applicable). Please note that you may only change the proposed dates of attendance indicated on your application, after acceptance, with approval from the School’s administration. Due to limited housing space, we may not be able to accommodate requested changes to the proposed dates.\n\nA curriculum vitae.\n\nA copy of current transcripts for student applicants (scans of official transcripts are acceptable).\n\nArrange for two letters of recommendation. Recommenders will be asked to upload their letters via the online application system, Submittable. Upon submission of the online application, recommenders will be sent an automated email with instructions about how to submit their letters of recommendation. Or, applicants may choose to send the request at any time by clicking the \"Send Request Now\" button on the online application form.\n\nAward decisions will be announced in March 2024.\n\nApply Now"
