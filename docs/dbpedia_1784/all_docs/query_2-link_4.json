        "text": "The concentration in Classical Languages and Literatures combines contemporary methods in literary study with a broad range of ancient texts studied both in translation and in the original languages. Students may choose to gain competence in Latin, in Greek, or in both languages. In addition to such influential works as the Iliad and Vergil's Aeneid, courses are offered which explore less familiar but exciting options, from the political comedies of Aristophanes to the satire of Petronius and the medieval dramas of the abbess Hrosvitha. Students gain hands-on experience with the material remains of ancient literature, including medieval manuscripts in the Special Collections Library. The major may also be modified with Philosophy, Linguistics, Comparative Literature, or other subjects.\n\nStudents electing this major are required to complete a specified set of courses, including:\n\n1. six courses in ancient Greek and/or in Latin at the intermediate (second year) or advanced level, to develop knowledge of the corpus of ancient Greek and Latin texts, to build familiarity with advanced methodologies of literary analysis, and to build research skills.\n\n2. one course on Greek or Roman literature or systems of thought, introducing the methodologies used in studying that subject matter.\n\n3. one course on ancient Greek or Roman history or material culture, to build familiarity with contexts for literary study and to introduce historical and archaeological methodologies.\n\n4. two additional courses that can develop knowledge, skills and methodologies that are useful in the study of ancient texts."
