        "text": "One of the most beautiful moments in Cincinnati men's final match was Carlos taking a moment during his speech to show love & appreciation to his big brother. A few key takeaways from that match I can relate to my day to day job. 1: Your job is not done until its done (Carlos own the 1st set and was leading 4-2 in the 2nd set, yet he didn't win the match) 2: Its okay to show emotions(or cry). In the end, we all are humans and emotions are part and parcel of our day to day work life (and of course personal life too) 3: Don't shout at your team just because you didn't get the result you wanted 4: Don't forget the team who helped you through out your journey (Carlos hasn't forgotten who helped him get there & he's making sure the world knows it as well) 5: Always smile (win or no-win). Its cost you $0\n\nAfter the Ourspace chapter closed, it took me a while to find what I was looking for next. Shutting down my startup was the most introspective I've ever been about my career. I thought a lot about what I wanted to opt into, and more importantly what I wanted to opt out of. Circuit is the outlier I was looking for - bootstrapped, profitable, intentionally small, and exciting yet sustainable growth. Equally as important, I was looking for a place that's as intentional about *how* they work as *what* they work on. And when I say intentional, I mean it: We don't use Slack, OKRs, or scrum. And there are very, very few meetings. All of this is by careful design. And takes immense courage to not simply mirror \"normal\" ways of working just because everyone else is doing it. It's this kind of nonconformity that got me especially excited about working with Jack Underwood and the team at Circuit. Onward!\n\nDuring the meeting, Stephen Bottomley highlighted a significant case where a contract that was set up on WhatsApp was deemed valid because the parties involved used a 👍 emoji as a form of acceptance. This case serves as a reminder that even seemingly informal methods of communication can carry legal consequences. It emphasizes the importance of using proper and formal channels when dealing with important agreements to avoid any ambiguity or misunderstandings. Networking isn't just for getting new business.
