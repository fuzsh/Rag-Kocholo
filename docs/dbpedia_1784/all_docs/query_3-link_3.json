He has more \"firsts\" to his credit than possibly any other American classical scholar, but is probably one of the least known. He was the first American to write a Latin textbook in English that combined the \"Accidence\" with \"Rules of Grammar\" along with illustrative examples and sentences. He was the first to write two Latin textbooks to be studied in sequence; to translate all of Virgil into English prose; to write and publish a Greek grammar in English; to edit and publish the New Testament in Greek as well as a large English dictionary. In addition, he wrote and published five grammatical works in English, a system of arithmetic, and numerous opera minora consisting of sermons, Biblical essays, and one scientific paper.During the period between 1802 and 1812 he took a leading role in developing an academy in Clinton, NY, that became Hamilton College. In recognition of his services and of his educational qualifications, the trustees unanimously elected him president of the college. In a letter of 22 July 1812, his 57th birthday, he regretted that personal considerations forced him to decline the honor."
