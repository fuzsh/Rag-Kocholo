        "text": "About the course\n\nThe Classics and English degree at Oxford gives students the opportunity to study the literature and culture of the ancient and modern world, both separately and in comparison; to trace ideas, forms, and genres across cultures and time; and to think about continuities and change in how people think, write, and imagine their world.\n\nAll students study either Latin or Greek or both, so that they can encounter ancient literature in the original language(s).\n\nCandidates with an A-level or equivalent in either Latin or Greek take a three-year course.\n\nCandidates who have not had the opportunity to study either classical language to A-level or equivalent take Classics and English with Beginners’ Latin or Greek. This is a four-year course which includes a preliminary year, in which students learn Latin or Greek alongside some study of classical literature.\n\n\">Video of Classics and English at Oxford University\n\nYou can choose to specialise in what you find most interesting from each side of the course, taking a range of options in English literature, and in ancient literature, history, philosophy, and linguistics. But the degree also integrates the two sides of its course, offering several papers designed specifically for the kind of comparative work that the course encourages.\n\nIn the first year (second, for Classics ad English with Beginners' Latin or Greek), students take a paper in English literature of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries – the period during which writers were most consistently and intensely engaged with the languages and literatures of ancient Greece and Rome.\n\nAmong the highlights of the latter two years are the four ‘link papers.’ All students take Epic, and read and compare authors such as Homer, Virgil, Milton, Alice Oswald, and Derek Walcott. Students then choose to take either Comedy, Tragedy, or Reception (in which you study the reception of ancient literature in 20th-century poetry). Students who choose to take up a second classical language in their penultimate year only take one of the link papers.\n\nThe final-year dissertation allows students to pursue an independently devised topic with an expert supervisor, which may combine the subjects or focus on an aspect of one of them. All of the courses allow students to pursue the twists and turns of literary genres across time.\n\nOxford has a long and distinguished tradition of research and teaching in both Classics and English, and possesses remarkable library provision in both subjects.\n\nOxford has the largest Classics department in the world, with over sixty full-time academic staff-members. It has outstanding teaching, library and museum resources. Resources include the Bodleian and Bodleian Art, Archaeology and Ancient World Libraries, the Ashmolean Museum and a designated Classics Centre.\n\nThe English Faculty is the largest English department in Britain. Students are taught in tutorials by an active a scholar in their field, many of whom also give lectures to all students in the English Faculty. You will therefore have the opportunity to learn from a wide range of specialist teachers.\n\nLibrary provision for English at Oxford is exceptionally good. All students have access to:\n\nthe Bodleian Library (with its extensive manuscript collection),\n\nthe English Faculty Library,\n\ntheir own college libraries,\n\nand a wide range of electronic resources.\n\nAstrophoria Foundation Year\n\nIf you’re interested in studying Classics and English but your personal or educational circumstances have meant you are unlikely to achieve the grades typically required for Oxford courses, then choosing to apply for Classics and English with a Foundation Year might be right for you.\n\nPlease visit our Foundation Year course pages for more details.\n\nUnistats information\n\nDiscover Uni course data provides applicants with Unistats statistics about undergraduate life at Oxford for a particular undergraduate course.\n\nPlease select 'see course data' to view the full Unistats data for Classics and for English.\n\nPlease note that there may be no data available if the number of course participants is very small.\n\nVisit the Studying at Oxford section of this page for a more general insight into what studying here is likely to be like.\n\nClassics\n\nEnglish\n\nA typical week\n\nA typical week is structured around two tutorials in different subjects, with the rest of your time divided between lectures, classes (including languages classes) and private study. Most of your work will be preparation of essays for tutorials (you will be expected to produce between eight and twelve pieces of written work during a term), however, language-learning and reading will also require considerable time. Much of your teaching will take place in your college, but you will attend three to four lectures a week in either faculty.\n\nTutorials are usually up to three students and a tutor. Class sizes may vary depending on the options you choose. There would usually be no more than around 15 students. Most tutorials, classes, and lectures are delivered by academics who are specialists in their subject. Many are world-leading experts with years of experience in teaching and research. Some teaching may also be delivered by qualified postgraduate students studying at doctoral level.\n\nThis table is a summary of the three-year course. Candidates who have not had the opportunity to study either classical language to A-level or equivalent have a preliminary year studying Latin or Greek, and then follow the structure outlined below.\n\nTo find out more about how our teaching year is structured, visit our Academic Year page.\n\nYear 1\n\nCourses\n\nAssessment\n\nStudents taking Classics and English with Beginners’ Latin or Greek spend a preliminary year learning Latin or Greek, alongside some study of classical literature. They then progress to Year 1 and follow the same programme as other Classics and English students.\n\nFive papers are taken:\n\nIntroduction to English language and literature\n\nLiterature in English 1550–1660\n\nUnseen translation for Classics\n\nGreek and/or Latin literature (two papers)\n\nFour written papers form the first University examination, together with a submitted portfolio of two essays for Introduction to English language and literature.

We will provide more information on these arrangements at the earliest opportunity.\n\nWritten work\n\nRead our further guidance on the submission of written work for general guidance.\n\nWhat are tutors looking for?\n\nTutors are looking for curious, independent students with a real commitment to the wide-ranging study and comparison of literatures. Written work helps us to gauge your analytical skills, and your writing.\n\nSuccessful candidates will be expected to display general language aptitude, including competence in Latin or Greek if they are studying the classical language(s) to A-level or equivalent.\n\nInterviews allow us to explore your enthusiasm for literature and the comparative aspects of the course, your response to new ideas and information, and your independent thinking and reading.\n\nWe expect you to have read widely in English and classical literature (in translation or in the original), and to have an appetite for talking and writing about literature and approaches to it. However we are not looking for any reading in particular: we are interested in your own ideas, interests, and in seeing how you think.\n\nVisit the Classics website and English website for more detail on the selection criteria for this course."
