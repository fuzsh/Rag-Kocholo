        "text": "About the course\n\nClassics (Literae Humaniores) is a wide-ranging degree devoted to the study of the civilisations of ancient Greece and Rome and their reception into modern times. It is one of the most varied and interdisciplinary of all subjects. Classics students at Oxford have the opportunity to study the languages, literature, history, and archaeology of the Greek and Roman Mediterranean, as well as philosophy (both ancient and modern) and linguistics.\n\nOxford has the largest Classics Faculty in the world, with over sixty full-time academic staff-members. It has outstanding teaching, library and museum resources. Resources include the Bodleian Art, Archaeology and Ancient World Library and Bodleian Libraries, the Ashmolean Museum and a designated Classics Centre.\n\nThe breadth of expertise in the Faculty allows us to offer an extremely wide range of courses from Homeric archaeology to Byzantine literature. The length of the course allows students to explore the various disciplines within this vast subject and to engage with their particular interests within the classical world in real depth.\n\nThe course involves extensive study of at least one ancient language, but candidates do not need to have any prior knowledge of either Greek or Latin.\n\nIn previous years Oxford offered two separate Classics degree programmes: Classics Course I (Q800) - for those who had studied Latin and/or Greek to A-level or equivalent, and Classics Course II (Q810) – for those who had not studied Latin or Greek to A-level or equivalent. Following a redesign of the degree structure, there is now just one degree programme (Classics – Q800) which is for all candidates, whether or not they have any prior experience of Latin or Greek. Those with an A-level or equivalent in at least one classical language will follow a dual-language stream (Latin and Greek); those without can choose to follow either a Latin or Greek stream.\n\nFieldwork/international opportunities\n\nFieldwork is not a requirement in any part of the course, but some undergraduates may participate in archaeological excavations.\n\nAstrophoria Foundation Year\n\nIf you’re interested in studying Classics but your personal or educational circumstances have meant you are unlikely to achieve the grades typically required for Oxford courses, then choosing to apply for Classics with a Foundation Year might be right for you.\n\nVisit our Foundation Year course pages for more details.\n\nUnistats information\n\nDiscover Uni course data provides applicants with Unistats statistics about undergraduate life at Oxford for a particular undergraduate course.\n\nPlease select 'see course data' to view the full Unistats data for Classics.\n\nPlease note that there may be no data available if the number of course participants is very small.\n\nVisit the Studying at Oxford section of this page for a more general insight into what studying here is likely to be like.\n\nClassics\n\nA typical week\n\nYour time is divided between lectures, tutorials and private study. The working week is typically structured around two tutorials in different subjects.\n\nMost of your independent work will be in preparation of essays for your tutorials, although systematic language-learning and reading of texts will also require considerable time and effort.\n\nMuch of the teaching will take place in your college, but lectures are given in the Classics Faculty and the Examination Schools, and for particular subjects you may also work with tutors from other colleges.\n\nVisit the Classics website for more information.\n\nTutorials in colleges usually involve up to three students and a tutor. Class sizes will vary depending on the options you choose, and there are usually 5-10 students in a class. Some classes are jointly taught by two tutors at the same time. For centrally organised language classes in Classics, there are usually 8-10 students in a group.\n\nMost tutorials, classes, and lectures are delivered by senior staff who are active researchers in their subject. Many are world-leading experts with years of experience in teaching and research. Some teaching may be delivered by postgraduate students at doctorate level.\n\nTo find out more about how our teaching year is structured, visit our Academic Year page.\n\nCourse structure\n\nLanguage stream\n\nTerms 1-5\n\nCourses\n\nTerms 1-5\n\nAssessments\n\nDual Language Stream\n\n(Latin and Greek, for those who have studied Latin and/or Greek to A-level or equivalent)\n\nGreek Literature selection\n\nLatin Literature selection\n\nA special subject in Philosophy (ancient or modern)\n\nA classical special subject: historical, archaeological or philological\n\nGreek and Latin language work at the appropriate level\n\nFirst University examinations:\n\nnine papers, including four language papers.

He says: ‘Following four years of excellent teaching in an astoundingly varied field, the intellectual rigour developed at Oxford has taken me from negotiating for the UK at the United Nations to learning Mandarin and representing the UK in China. Classics provided me with the perfect platform, and more importantly gave me four wonderful years steeped in the fascinating classical world.’\n\nMenai is a project manager for Kent County Council. She says: ‘I joined Kingfisher Retail and subsequently WHSmith. I then worked for a charity and finally moved to local government. The training in logical thinking and a questioning approach I developed while studying for my degree have been invaluable.’"
