Franz Joseph Haydn’s opera Philemon und Baucis, oder Jupiters Reise auf die Erde was originally written for a marionette theater at the Royal Castle of Esterhazy in the 18th century. In the story, the gods look down upon the Earth and observe mankind’s cruelty towards one another and the world in which they live. At first, they throw storms upon the Earth as punishment for the humans’ bad behavior. But before destroying everything, the gods decide to search for any good people remaining. Jupiter and Mercury descend upon the Earth and discover a husband and wife whose kindness proves humanity is worth saving.\n\nJupiter’s Journey to the Earth was created in part during a Baryshnikov Arts 2024 spring residency.\n\nCAST\n\nJupiter\n\nGregory Sheppard* | Paul Whelan+\n\nMercury\n\nRebecca Marchan-Espino* | Heather Jones+\n\nPhilemon\n\nBrian Downen* | Rufus Müller+\n\nBaucis\n\nJennifer Roderer* | Heather Johnson+\n\nAret\n\nDavid Morgans* | Gabriel Hernandez\n\nNarcissa\n\nSara LeMesh* | Abigail Raiford+\n\nThe Olympians (Puppeteers)\n\nElise Wunderlich\n\nFergie L.

The production paired Highway 1, U.S.A. by William Grant Still, libretto by Verna Arvey, with Down in the Valley by Kurt Weill, libretto by Arnold Sundgaard. The NY Classical Review credited little OPERA for “brightly reviving a pair of American rarities” and calling the performances “outstanding.”\n\nSince its founding in 2004, the little OPERA theatre of ny has presented four NY Stage Premieres: Britten/Piper’s Owen Wingrave; Hasse/Coltellini’s Piramo e Tisbe; Floyd’s Prince of Players; Mozart/Cigna-Santi’s Mitridate, re di Ponto; two US stage premieres: Saint-Georges/Desfontaines/De Genlis’ L’ Amant Anonyme; Cui/Pushkin’s A Feast in the Time of the Plague; one world premiere: Zaretsky/Kharms’ Man in a Black Coat; and commissioned a new translation of Mozart/Metastasio’s Il re pastore as The Shepherd King from Mark Herman & Ronnie Apter.\n\nLOTNY’s production of Owen Wingrave was noted in Opera News as “(a) shadowy, haunting, attractive production…superbly prepared.” Piramo e Tisbe again heralded by Opera News as “superlative [and] an excellent and irrefutable case for programming this rare work, [with] indelible performances that should count among the finest and most complete interpretations heard in New York this season.” The NY premiere of Prince of Players was praised by The New York Times as “well made and stylish” and for being “delightful, impressive, [and] affecting” in the NY Classical Review. LOTNY’s concerts have included Past & Present on Governors Island; This Little Light of Mine at Merkin Concert Hall; The Bohemians at Socrates Sculpture Park and Floydiana at the DiMenna Center for Classical Music. lotny.org\n\nPlease Save the Date\n\nFriday, September 27th 2024\n\nMerkin Concert Hall\n\n20th Anniversary Concert\n\nThis program is supported, in part, by public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, in partnership with the City Council.\n\nJoseph Haydn PHILEMON AND BAUCIS, Hob.
