        "text": "The German education system stands out for its unique combination of academic rigor, hands-on learning, and commitment to individual development. Let’s explore how this system is regulated, its key stages, and other helpful details for anyone considering studying in Germany.\n\nIn this guide: A German school system chart to make it all easier to understand!\n\nHow the German School System Works\n\nThe German education system operates under the framework of the Basic Law (Grundgesetz). At the federal level, the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF) plays a coordinating and supporting role in education matters.\n\nHowever, education in Germany is primarily the responsibility of the individual federal states (Bundesländer). Each federal state has its own Ministry of Education or equivalent authority responsible for education policy and legislation within its jurisdiction.\n\nThese state-level authorities determine many aspects of education, including curriculum, teacher qualifications, and school organization.\n\nAs a result of this federal structure, education legislation and regulations can vary from one federal state to another, leading to some differences in educational policies and practices across the country.\n\nWhat is Compulsory Education in Germany?\n\nCompulsory education in Germany is a fundamental commitment to ensure that every child receives an education. All children in the Federal Republic of Germany must start school once they reach the age of six until they complete nine years of full-time schooling at the Gymnasium or 10 years of full-time schooling for other general education schools.\n\nAfter compulsory education, those who don’t continue to full-time general or vocational schools at the upper secondary level must still attend part-time schooling (compulsory Berufsschule attendance – Berufsschulpflicht), which typically lasts three years.\n\nCompulsory education applies to children and youth with disabilities as well. Depending on their special educational needs (sonderpädagogischer Förderbedarf), they can either join regular schools with non-disabled peers or attend special education institutions (sonderpädagogische Bildungseinrichtungen).\n\nHere’s a German school system chart you will definitely find useful:\n\nHow Is the School System Structured in Germany?\n\nThe German school system is structured into five main stages:\n\nEarly Childhood Education. This stage is optional but widely attended. Children typically start kindergarten at age three or four, focusing on socialization and early learning.\n\nPrimary Education. Beginning at age six and spanning grades 1 to 4 (or 1 to 6 in Berlin and Brandenburg), this stage marks the start of compulsory schooling and aids the transition from pre-school to formal education.\n\nSecondary Education. Secondary education in Germany is divided into lower secondary (Sekundarstufe I) and upper secondary level (Sekundarstufe II), aiming to prepare students for vocational qualifications or higher education.\n\nTertiary Education. Tertiary education in Germany includes universities, colleges, and vocational academies offering degrees and vocational qualifications. It’s highly respected for its academic quality and research opportunities.\n\nContinuing Education. Continuing education in Germany offers non-degree courses and workshops for skill development and lifelong learning. It caters to diverse individuals and aims to enhance personal and professional growth.\n\n1. Early Childhood Education\n\nWhat Is Considered Preschool Education in Germany?\n\nEarly childhood education is optional education and care that children between 0-6 of age receive in the Federal Territory of Germany. This type of education includes both private and public child and youth welfare services for children who have not reached the age to start compulsory education (primary school).\n\nWhich Are the Institutions of Preschool Education in Germany?\n\nIn Germany, preschool education is predominantly provided by private daycare centers, including crèches, child-minding centers, and kindergartens.\n\nNon-public organizations like Churches and Welfare or Parent’s Associations have priority in offering these services, with local authorities stepping in only when private initiatives are lacking.\n\nHere are the preschool education institutions in Germany:\n\nDay-care centers (Kindertageseinrichtungen). Typically, a combined setting for children under the age of three and those from age three up to starting primary school.\n\nCrèches (Kinderkrippen). Children under the age of three.\n\nKindergartens (Kindergärten). Children from age three up to starting primary school.\n\nSchool kindergartens, Preliminary classes, or Primary school support classes (Schulkindergärten, Vorklassen, Grundschulförderklassen). Children of compulsory school age who aren’t developmentally ready for regular studies, including those with disabilities or special educational needs.\n\nThe hours of preschool education are typically arranged through collaboration between parents and management, generally spanning a 7-hour day that includes lunch and sometimes a midday break.\n\nWhat Are the Teaching Methodology and Materials in Preschool Education in Germany?\n\nEarly childhood education in Germany aims to nurture children’s independence and development, offering age-appropriate instruction, values, and rules. It adapts to individual needs, including those of expat children, who benefit from language acquisition and socialization during this phase.\n\nFor Children Under the Age of 3\n\nThe core educational mission of the German preschool education (age under 3) is enhancing communication skills among kids. Secondly, it is the development of their language skills through social interaction with other toddlers and adults.\n\nCommunication and language skills are taught by language role models (educators), finger plays, singing, picture books, and additional teaching practices/instruments.\n\nFurthermore, an important part of pre-educating children is given to motor development. This includes increasing body awareness, self-acceptance, self-confidence, and concentration among toddlers.\n\nMotor development is reached through physical activities, visiting public environments, rhythmic early education programs, singing, and movement playing.\n\nFor Children Over the Age of 2\n\nCore values that preschool education seeks to develop amongst children are the enhancement of their teamwork skills, along with their level of integration in daily life activities.\n\nKey areas of German preschool education for children older than 2 are:\n\nLanguage, writing, communication,\n\nPersonal and social development,\n\nDevelopment of values and religious education,\n\nMathematics, natural sciences, (information) technology\n\nFine arts/working with different media\n\nBody, movement, health, and\n\nNature and cultural environments.\n\nSuch values are taught through self-organized learning, creative learning, teamwork-building activities, investigation, and experimental activities.\n\nAssessment of the Educational Achievements in Preschool Education in Germany\n\nChildren are not assessed regarding their educational achievement reached by participating in German preschool institutions. Instead, they’re constantly supervised by their educators or trainers regarding their attainment from learning activities.\n\nThe opinion of educators is discussed with the parents of children, who together agree on further measures for the development of kids’ learning skills.\n\nWho Supervises Preschool Education in Germany?\n\nPreschool education in Germany is supervised by the State Youth Welfare Offices (Landesjugendämter) in each state (Lander). Providers must meet specific requirements, such as appropriate staff ratios, qualified educators, adequate facilities, hygiene standards, and age-appropriate educational programs.\n\nKindergarten (early childhood education) in Germany is not entirely free, but the costs are heavily subsidized. Parents typically pay a monthly fee, which can vary depending on the state (Land) and the specific kindergarten.\n\nThe fees are income-dependent, with lower-income families paying less and sometimes receiving exemptions. Some states have also moved towards making kindergarten education entirely free.\n\nWhat If a Child Isn’t Yet Ready to Begin Compulsory School Studies?\n\nThere is a middle option for children who have reached the compulsory school attendance age but have not yet reached the needed development. This is relevant for children with disabilities and those needing special education. So, they attend a special school offered by some Landers, known as School Kindergarten or a Preliminary Class beforehand.\n\n2. Primary Education\n\nWhat Is Considered Primary Education in Germany?\n\nPrimary school, or Grundschule, offers mandatory education through mixed-ability classes for children aged six until they complete grade 4 (or 6 in Berlin and Brandenburg).\n\nAs kids finish grade 4/6, primary school marks an important transition phase, as together with parents and teachers, they are placed into different types of secondary schools depending on academic performance and goals.\n\nPrimary School Grades Child’s Age Grade 1 6 Grade 2 7 Grade 3 8 Grade 4 9 Grade 5 (Berlin and Brandenburg) 10 Grade 6 (Berlin and Brandenburg) 11\n\nWhich Are the Teaching Practices in Primary Schools in Germany?\n\nPrimary education in Germany follows standards set by the Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder (Kultusministerkonferenz).\n\nIt includes subjects such as:\n\nGerman,\n\nMathematics,\n\nGeneral studies,\n\nForeign language,\n\nArt,\n\nHandicrafts,\n\nMusic,\n\nSport,\n\nReligion, or ethics.\n\nThe curriculum includes topics like intercultural education, sustainability, values education, and more. Parents are encouraged to stay involved in their children’s education.\n\nLearning objectives in primary schools are attained through the engagement of pupils in planning, running, and analyzing study subjects (lessons) in an adapted way, which goes along with their knowledge, interest, curiosity, and concerns. Students are also encouraged to participate in organizing initiatives and interdisciplinary projects of the school.\n\nGermany has two primary school education systems: a 5-day school week with 188 teaching days per year and a 6-day school week with 208 teaching days per year, which includes classes on two Saturdays every month.\n\nPrimary school classes typically start between 7:30 AM and 8:00 AM and end at 11 AM or 12 PM. Each lesson lasts for 45 minutes, with breaks for eating and socializing. Most public primary schools don’t have uniforms, and children can wear whatever they want.\n\nWhat is the Grading System Used in German Primary Schools?\n\nIn German primary schools, students are initially promoted to the next grade without formal grading after completing grade 1.\n\nFrom grade 2 onward, they receive grades based on their knowledge level, ranging from 1 (very good) to 6 (very poor). These grades in Germany are reflected in a school report (Zeugnis), and promotion to the next grade depends on their performance. If a student fails, they may need to repeat the grade.\n\nDoes a Pupil Receive a Primary School Leaving Certificate in Germany?\n\nIn most of Germany (Baden-Württemberg and Rheinland-Pfalz are the exceptions), there are no formal exams or leaving certificates for primary school. Students are assessed based on meeting specific educational outcomes and receive annual reports.\n\n💡 Did you know? Germany has unique primary education programs for children of professional travelers, including circus families. Schools like the School for Children of Professional Travelers (Schule für die Kinder Beruflich Reisender) ensure education during non-traveling periods.\n\nThere’s even a School for Circus Children (Schule für Circuskinder) in North Rhine-Westphalia, providing primary education for children from traveling circus families.\n\nWho Supervises Primary Education in Germany?\n\nThe Grundschule, the first mandatory school for all children in Germany, operates under legal provisions outlined in the Basic Law and state constitutions regarding schools. These provisions cover inspection, parental rights, compulsory education, religious instruction, and privately-maintained schools.\n\nThe federal government funds public primary schools in Germany, which means they do not charge tuition fees. However, parents may be asked to contribute toward some expenses, like school supplies or extracurricular activities.\n\n3. Secondary Education\n\nWhat Is Considered Secondary Education in Germany?\n\nIn the German school system, secondary education follows the primary school stage and is marked by a division into different educational paths, each leading to specific leaving certificates and qualifications. Secondary education is divided into lower secondary (Sekundarstufe I) and upper secondary (Sekundarstufe II).\n\nThe lower secondary level is offered for pupils aged 10–12 until they are 15–16 in grades 5–7 to 9–10 and focuses on general education.\n\nOn the other hand, the upper secondary level is offered to pupils who have completed the prior level (from the age of 15–16 until 18–19) and prepares students for university or vocational qualifications, with various schools available based on abilities and prior education.\n\nWho is Responsible for Managing German Secondary Education?\n\nIn Germany, secondary education is governed by legal frameworks, including the Education Acts and Compulsory Schooling Acts of the German Länder. These laws define curriculum content and qualifications granted upon completing lower and upper secondary education in both general and vocational schools.\n\nVocational training is regulated by the Vocational Training Act and the Handicrafts Act, addressing matters like contracts, certificates, and trainee rights. Special legislation, like the Protection of Young Persons at Work Act, ensures the protection of young trainees.\n\nPublic education in Germany is funded through taxation, and students are not required to pay tuition fees at these levels of education. Private secondary schools may charge tuition fees, but the majority of students in Germany attend public secondary schools, which are free of charge.\n\nWhat Are the Types of Secondary Schools in Germany?\n\nThe Federal Country of Germany offers secondary education in public and private schools. Various secondary schools in Germany cater to students with varying abilities and prior primary education qualifications.\n\nThe German educational system is traditionally divided into three main tracks (the Gymnasium, Realschule, and Hauptschule), with some states introducing the Comprehensive School (Gesamtschule) as an alternative or addition to the existing system:\n\nGymnasium\n\nGymnasium is a prestigious secondary school in Germany that begins around age 10 or 11 and typically lasts until age 18. It covers grades 5 to 12 or 13, offering a rigorous academic education. Students graduate with the “Abitur,” a qualification that grants access to universities and diverse career opportunities.\n\nRealschule\n\nRealschule starts at around age 10 or 11 and generally concludes at age 16, encompassing grades 5 to 10. This school type provides a balanced mix of academic and practical education. Upon completion, students earn the “Realschulabschluss” diploma, enabling them to pursue vocational training or higher education.\n\nHauptschule\n\nHauptschule commences at approximately age 10 and typically ends at age 15, spanning grades 5 to 9. It emphasizes practical and vocational education. Students receive the “Hauptschulabschluss” certificate, which can lead to vocational training or part-time education.\n\nGesamtschule\n\nGesamtschule starts around age 10 or 11 and may last until age 16 or 18, depending on the school’s structure. It covers grades 5 to 10 or 12, offering a comprehensive education that combines academic and practical aspects. Qualifications vary but can include certificates equivalent to Realschulabschluss or Abitur, depending on students’ chosen educational paths within the Gesamtschule.\n\nGerman Schools With More Than One Study Course (Schularten mit mehreren Bildungsgängen)\n\nThese schools in Germany offer multiple educational tracks or study courses within a single institution. These can include comprehensive schools, secondary schools (in Bremen), community schools, integrated secondary schools, and others.\n\nGerman Vocational Schools\n\nGerman secondary vocational schools are institutions that provide specialized vocational education and training to students who have completed their general secondary education (usually Realschule or Hauptschule). They offer lessons and practical placement, known as a dual system.\n\nThese are the types of vocational schools available in Germany:\n\nFachoberschule. Offers a 2-year program for “Mittlerer Schulabschluss” holders, leading to “Fachhochschulreife” for entry to universities of applied sciences. A 13th grade option can result in “Fachgebundene Hochschulreife” or “Abitur.”\n\nBerufsoberschule. Provides 2-year general and in-depth education, enhancing previous vocational knowledge, leading to vocational qualifications or, with proficiency in a second foreign language, “Abitur.” Also offers 3/4-year courses for dual vocational and higher education qualifications.\n\nBerufsfachschule. Offers education for specific professions requiring formal recognition or vocational training qualifications.\n\nBerufsschule. Delivers practical, interdisciplinary lessons preparing students for further vocational education or professions based on the dual education and training system.\n\nBerufliches Gymnasium. A 3-year secondary education program leading to the “Abitur” qualification.\n\nGerman Private Secondary Schools\n\nPrivate secondary schools in Germany fall into two categories: “Ersatzschulen,” which offer the same curriculum as public schools but with private funding, and “Ergänzungsschulen,” which provide additional courses beyond public school offerings.\n\nWhat Are the Curriculum and Teaching Practices in Secondary Education?\n\nGerman secondary education focuses on fundamental education, individual specialization, and identifying students’ unique abilities, especially in lower secondary education.\n\nAchieving these objectives involves:\n\nEngaging students intellectually, emotionally, and physically.\n\nTeaching them independence, decision-making, personal, social, and political responsibility.\n\nAssisting them in attaining their educational goals.\n\nSupporting them in advancing their specialist knowledge.\n\nGeneral upper secondary schools, such as Gymnasium, are vital in preparing students for the Abitur or other university entrance qualifications.\n\nThese institutions provide comprehensive knowledge in German and foreign languages, mathematics, self-development, social responsibility, and participation in democratic society. Additionally, they offer guidance on academic institutions, admission requirements, vocational options, and career prospects.\n\nUpper secondary education is also offered by German vocational high schools known as “Berufliches Gymnasium.” Over two full-time years, these schools prepare students for vocational qualifications as skilled staff with “Fachgebundene Hochschulreife.”\n\nThis qualification opens doors to professions requiring formal qualifications and can serve as a pathway to university entrance if the holder demonstrates proficiency in a second foreign language. Moreover, it enables enrollment in technical universities after two years of study, leading to a “Mittlerer Schulabschluss” maturity certificate.\n\nWhat Is the Grading System in German Secondary Schools?\n\nThe progress of pupils in German secondary schools is evaluated upon a 6-mark grading system as follows:\n\n1 (very good)\n\n2 (good)\n\n3 (satisfactory)\n\n4 (adequate)\n\n5 (poor)\n\n6 (very poor)\n\n4. Tertiary Education\n\nWhat Is Tertiary Education in Germany Like?\n\nTertiary education in Germany encompasses post-secondary education at various institutions, including universities, universities of applied sciences, and specialized institutions, offering a wide range of academic and vocational programs.\n\nIt emphasizes academic excellence, research-oriented education, and practical skills development, leading to Bachelor’s, Master’s, and Doctorate degrees.\n\nWho Supervises German Tertiary Education?\n\nUnder the Basic law, higher education institutions enjoy the autonomy to independently manage the scholarship awarding, research, and teaching activity. For administrative issues, such as academic and governmental matters, these institutions have to be in accord with the Lander’s ministry.\n\nTertiary education at public universities in Germany is generally tuition-free, with nominal semester fees ranging from €100 to €300. Private universities, however, charge varying tuition fees ranging from a few thousand to more, so students should inquire about costs and available financial aid.\n\nWhich Are the Institutions of German Tertiary Education?\n\nWith more than 400 state-recognized institutions of higher education in Germany, you’ll find an abundance of choices when it comes to tertiary education.\n\nHere are some of the higher education institutions you can choose from and what each specializes in:\n\nUniversities (Universitäten)\n\nUniversities offer a wide range of academic programs and research opportunities leading to bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees, with a strong emphasis on research and theoretical knowledge.

The country has strict regulations that require children to attend public or state-approved private schools. There are very limited exceptions, such as for children with specific medical conditions that prevent them from attending regular schools.\n\nIn most cases, homeschooling is not permitted, and parents can face legal consequences if they choose to homeschool their children.\n\nWhen Do Schools Start in Germany?\n\nThe school year in Germany usually starts in late August to early September, varying across the 16 German states, and typically ends in June or July, with slight variations depending on the state and school.\n\nAre There Any Breaks or Holidays During the German School Year?\n\nSchoolchildren in Germany receive a total of 75 days of holiday per year, which includes 12 Saturdays. These holidays are divided into six school holiday periods that coincide with the separate school terms:\n\nAutumn Holiday (Herbstferien). Usually two weeks in October or November.\n\nChristmas Holiday (Weihnachtsferien). Typically around two weeks in late December and early January.\n\nWinter Holiday (Winterferien). Varies in duration and may range from a few days to two weeks, depending on the region.\n\nEaster Holiday (Osterferien). Lasting two to three weeks in March or April.\n\nWhitsun Holiday (Pfingstferien). Varies from a few days to two weeks and falls around May or June.\n\nSummer Holiday (Sommerferien). The longest break lasts around six to seven weeks, usually starting in late June or early July and ending in late August or early September.\n\nThese breaks can vary by federal state, and the exact dates may change each year. Some schools may also have additional holidays known as “bridge days” (Brückentage) around public holidays or special occasions.
