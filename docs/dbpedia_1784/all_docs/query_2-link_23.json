        "text": "\"Welcome to Westmont—I’m delighted that you are exploring the possibility of joining our community of scholars. The Augustinian Scholars Program (ASP) offers a four-year honors curriculum committed to academic excellence. It aims to challenge, support, and connect academically gifted students, helping them faithfully cultivate the gifts that God has given them and working to prepare them to then invest these gifts faithfully in the world. Several features distinguish the Augustinians from other honors programs. First, in addition to academic rigor, the program is explicitly oriented towards Christian formation—believing that the life of the mind in pursuit of truth is inescapably tied to the life of faith and the pursuit of the One who is Truth. Second, rather than creating a separate honors college, the ASP operates integrally within the wider college, enhancing scholars’ engagement with the rich intellectual and relational opportunities within the remarkable community that is Westmont College. And third, while many of our scholars will go on to lead and make prominent contributions to their communities and to the world, the focus of our efforts is on faithfulness: answering God’s call to steward our giftings well--wherever that may take us. We believe that to whom much is entrusted, much is expected. We look forward to exploring with you whether this might be the context in which you seek to faithfully steward your gifts.\"\n\nWarmly,\n\nJesse Covington\n\nDirector, Augustinian Scholars Program\n\nMore About The Director\n\nIn a world that often values new and upcoming ideas, Westmont’s Augustinian Scholar Program has given me the opportunity to engage with ideas and truth that have stood the test of time. From St. Augustine, to Kierkegaard, Aquinas, and C.S. Lewis, these voices have moved me and formed me into who I am today; A woman who strives for rightly ordered loves, holds the conviction that faith and reason can be held together, and has truly come to know that “our hearts are restless until they rest in You (God)” (St. Augustine, 400 AD). Wrestling with deep questions of epistemology, being chosen by God, and how this world’s brokenness and God’s sovereignty can coincide was emphasized in my first year seminars and yet these questions and conversations became prominent in DC meals, late night couch conversations, and beach walks. Seeking truth has been fulfilling and meaningful and the discussions paired with the mentorship and wisdom of program professors has been invaluable. What a privilege and what a joy the Augustinian Scholar Program has been, and might I dare to say, its impact on me has just begun.\n\nEntering Westmont, I was beyond excited for the Augustinian Program, although I was not quite sure what to expect. In that first week of class, I was blown away, not just by the caliber of students in my cohort, but by the quality of character exhibited by those around me. I loved getting to know my classmates and professors while we engaged stimulating questions. As discussions in class turned into conversations with friends over dinner or in the dorms, I quickly learned how much I don’t know, but I loved pursuing truth alongside an incredible community––it’s a truly humbling experience. Over the course of the program, I’ve forged meaningful relationships, wrestled with more unanswered questions than I’d like, discovered the richness of various Christian traditions, and my faith has been shaped in ways I could not have imagined four years ago. …I’ve found joy and freedom in reorienting my desires to better understand my gifts and calling, so that I can become a better friend and citizen of the Kingdom of God.\n\nEntering into the Augustinian program has been an unmistakable and utter gift. It has afforded me quality food for thought and led to some of the richest relationships I have ever cultivated. I am genuinely grateful for the proximity to my professors which these classes have offered. While engaging in conversation with these faculty members, I am reminded that they are approachable and deeply kind, in addition to being seasoned and knowledgeable. The intimacy of Augustinian seminars …feels like a breath of fresh air, and I owe much gratitude to the individuals who are responsible for the flourishing of the program!\n\nThis program was and is still a testimony to God’s goodness in my own life. I came into college aware of desiring growth in my interpersonal connections and my professional aspirations; however, God also had something else in mind and brought me here to integrate and deepen my intellectual and spiritual desires. …More than anything else, the program set a foundational tone for how I wanted to make sense of myself and the pursuit of a meaningful life with God. I cannot stress enough how helpful this foundation was. I am now in medical school and to this day, I still revisit some of the topics and regularly stay in touch with my friends and professors from the program. As I look back, those four years together were an eye-opening, fruitful, and humbling experience of intellectual inquiry and spiritual formation. Every bit of it was worth it and I feel very lucky for how generously the program has invested in me and my future."
