        "text": "Scholar Distinctions\n\nUSC Renaissance Scholars, Discovery Scholars, and Global Scholars are academic honors awarded upon graduation that recognize graduating seniors who meet the criteria. Interested USC undergraduates may apply and receive the distinction(s) upon commencement. Scholars receive a medallion to wear at graduation, have their distinction noted on their final transcript from the University, and may be in consideration for the Prize Competition (see below). Seniors can earn more than one distinction but must meet the criteria for each application.\n\nApplication Timeline for Graduating Seniors\n\nWhen to Apply\n\nMay and August graduates apply during their final spring semester (aside from the Renaissance Scholar Certification deadline in December).\n\nDecember graduates apply the spring following their graduation (defined by undergraduate degree completion, not walking).\n\nFollow all specific deadlines and updates listed for each Scholar Distinction application.\n\nApplicant Scholar Distinction Timeline 2023-24\n\nUpcoming Deadlines for Submissions\n\nView More…\n\nAbout Scholar Distinctions\n\nSeniors apply separately for consideration to be Renaissance Scholars, Discovery Scholars, and/or Global Scholars. Interested undergraduates should thoroughly review the eligibility and requirements for each distinction and prize competition.\n\nSteven & Kathryn Sample Renaissance Scholar Distinction\n\nIn honor of former University President Steven Sample and his wife Kathryn, the Renaissance Scholar distinction recognizes undergraduate students who have excelled in their studies while completing a major and a minor (or two majors) in widely disparate fields of study. The objective is to achieve breadth and depth in two widely separate fields of thought. Learn More\n\nGlobal Scholar Distinction\n\nThe Global Scholar distinction honors students who excel in their studies both at home and abroad. Students must spend at least 10 weeks abroad during their undergraduate studies and complete a capstone project related to their international experiences. Global Scholars participate in activities that expose them to new perspectives, and challenge the status quo. Learn More\n\nDiscovery Scholar Distinction\n\nThe Discovery Scholar distinction honors undergraduate students who excel in the classroom while demonstrating the ability to create exceptional new scholarship or artistic works in any major concentration offered at the University. Learn More\n\nScholar Distinction Prize Competition\n\nEach distinction hosts a Prize Competition and selects ten graduating seniors to receive a $10,000 prize. Students may apply for or be considered for more than one Prize Competition, but can only be awarded one prize.\n\nFor Renaissance Scholars, all certified graduating seniors are invited to apply for the Prize Competition. Applying for the Prize is not required to earn the distinction.\n\nFor Global and Discovery Scholars, applicants who meet the deadline are reviewed by their School to earn the distinction and/or prize nomination. All prize nominees are forwarded to a university-wide review panel and, if not selected, will still earn the distinction.\n\nPrize Winners may request funds for up to 5 years (6 for Architecture graduates) after bachelor’s degree completion to fund graduate school anywhere in the U.S. or abroad; and may be able to propose creative projects relevant to career goals. A request may be submitted through Academic Programs after the recipient has enrolled and passed the third week of a graduate program through the fall semester 5 years (6 years for Architecture) post-graduation. Prize award requests cannot go towards funding for pre-graduate school preparatory courses or exam fees, or towards a completed graduate degree.\n\nWe encourage all student applicants to consult a tax professional to understand their tax obligations and responsibilities. For international students, please go to this link for additional resources on tax implications provided by the USC Office of International Services.\n\nEmail ahfstaff@usc.edu for assistance with prize disbursement.\n\nPrevious Prize Winners\n\nEach year, an exemplary group of ten graduating seniors from each of the Scholar Distinctions is selected to receive $10,000 prizes towards graduate study. Below is a list of Prize Winners for previous years.\n\nRenaissance Prize Winners\n\nUSC Steven and Kathryn Sample Renaissance Scholars are students who graduate in two or more widely separated fields of study with both a major and minor, or two baccalaureate degrees. Renaissance Scholars must meet requirements for superior academic performance, including no less than a 3.5 overall grade point average, and no less than a 3.5 grade point average in their respective programs of study.\n\nGlobal Prize Winners\n\nThe University recognizes seniors as USC Global Scholars. The Global Scholars program recognizes undergraduates who have excelled in their studies both at home and abroad, spending at least ten weeks outside of the U.S. as part of their undergraduate experience, and achieving no less than a 3.5 overall grade point average.\n\nDiscovery Prize Winners\n\nUSC Discovery Scholars are students who have produced exceptional original scholarship or creative work at USC while compiling a distinguished overall academic record, including no less than a 3.5 overall grade point average."
