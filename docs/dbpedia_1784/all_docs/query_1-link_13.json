Schneider / “Indigenous Hinterlands in Colonial San Francisco Bay Area, California” / 3:15-5:00pm / Social Sciences, Room 261\n\nFrom 1776 to the 1830s, Native people throughout California entered or resisted Spanish missions. For the San Francisco Bay area, resistance often involved running away, approved furloughs administered by some padres, and other thoughtful departures that reactivated threatened places and practices. Following the mission period, Native people continued to meaningfully construct places while also contributing to new economic opportunities emerging across a shifting colonial landscape. This talk presents ongoing archaeological, historical, and collections-based research directed at identifying and investigating such places and practices, including sites of refuge and the opportunities that emerged along coastal Marin County during the 1840s and afterward.\n\n(top)\n\nWednesday, May 6 / SCIENCE & JUSTICE / Ruha Benjamin & Charis Thompson / “Good Science/People’s Science: An Exploration of Science and Justice” / 1:00-4:00pm / University Center, Alumni Room\n\nAs part of the Science and Justice Research Center’s efforts to develop analytics for understanding and enacting ‘science and justice,’ we will be hosting a half-day long symposium that features the work of Charis Thompson (Chancellor’s Professor and Chair of Gender & Women’s Studies, UC Berkeley) and Ruha Benjamin (Assistant Professor in the Center for African American Studies, Princeton University).

Data in humanities research is not new; it is the capacity of new technology to do more with data that creates a sense of difference, possibility, and even anxiety. This talk will begin by looking at centuries-old treatment of data in the humanities, and explore how humanists are rediscovering the data in their corporations.\n\nDr. Patrick Murray-John is a Research Assistant Professor and Omeka Developer Manager at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. He has a B.S. in Mathematics from Iowa State University, and an M.A. in English Literature and Ph.D. in Anglo-Saxon Literature from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Besides helping to develop Omeka, he uses it and other tools to experiment with making data part of public humanities projects. A recent project of his, the US Museums Explorer, an Omeka site built on data released by the Institute for Museum and Library Services, was recently cited as an example of using open data in the Center For the Future of Museums’ “Trends Watch 2015″.\n\nThis event is targeted to tool developers, researchers, librarians, archivists, instructors, and graduate students from across the UC system. The event is open to all interested and will be especially of interest to those already working in Omeka to develop digital asset libraries, curate research material, teach visual arts, or cultivate digital literacies.\n\n(top)\n\nThursday, May 7 / LIVING WRITER SERIES / Jared Harvey, Gabriela Ramirez-Chavez, Whitney De Vos, Nicholas James Whittington, Eric Sneathen / 6:00-7:45pm / Humanities Lecture Hall, Room 206\n\nJared Harvey is a an author of several chapbooks, including Commuting: Have Gone to Ithaca. – Frank Quitely, Hosni Mubarak, Mammal, and his most recent chapbook Here You Are (co-authored with Sara Peck.\n\nGabriela Ramirez-Chavez is a Guatemalan-American poet originally from Los Angeles, California.

Some have voiced the concern that prevailing liberal egalitarian principles are constructed under idealized assumptions and thus are ill-suited to real-world circumstances where such assumptions do not apply. Specifically, critics have raised three related objections to so-called ideal theory: (1) ideal theory cannot help us understand current injustices in the actual, nonideal world; (2) ideal principles are not sufficiently action-guiding; and (3) ideal theory is counterproductive or even dangerous because it tends to reflect and perpetuate illicit group privilege.\n\nThis paper explores recent work on the ethics of immigration in light of these methodological criticisms, focusing on the open borders debate. The central question in this debate is whether liberal states have a moral right to restrict immigration. I argue that prominent arguments on both sides of this issue are subject to the standard criticisms of ideal theory, and thus that a nonideal normative approach to immigration in urgently needed. I then develop several methodological desiderata for such an approach and draw upon these criteria to outline the broad contours of an adequate nonideal theory of justice in immigration.\n\nShelley Wilcox is Professor of Philosophy at San Francisco State University. She works in the areas of social and political philosophy, feminist philosophy, and applied ethics, with a special interest in immigration, global justice, and urban environmental issues. She has published articles on the ethics of immigration and globalization in Philosophical Studies, Social Theory and Practice, Journal of Social Philosophy, Philosophy Compass, and The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, as well as in numerous anthologies. She is currently working on a book manuscript on urban environmental ethics and serving as Book Review Editor of Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy.\n\n(top)\n\nThursday, April 30 / LIVING WRITER SERIES / Marilyn Chin / 6:00-7:45pm / Humanities Lecture Hall, Room 206\n\nMarilyn Chin is an award-winning poet and the author of Revenge of the Mooncake Vixen, Rhapsody in Plain Yellow, The Phoenix Gone, the Terrace Empty and Dwarf Bamboo.

Novarro, the subject of Professor Chávez’s current book project, was perhaps best known for playing the title role in the 1925 version of Ben-Hur, which propelled him to stardom. The bulk of his career occurred at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and after his stardom waned, he continued to act in movies and television until his violent murder at the hands of a hustler in 1968. The manner of his death ensured that he was outed posthumously. Yet, if one reads interviews with him and letters that he wrote to friends, queer codes that deflected his homosexuality emerge. Such is the case with the 102 letters that he wrote to Bay Area arts philanthropist Noël Sullivan. The letters, which are housed at UC Berkeley’s Bancroft Library, are the basis of this talk. In these missives, Novarro expressed his devout Catholicism to Sullivan, who was both gay and Catholic. The letters provide insight into a platonic relationship between two gay men in the early to mid-twentieth century and allow us to glimpse an intimacy that was mitigated by religiosity, but that nonetheless had at its core a common homosexuality.\n\nErnesto Chávez, Associate Professor of History at the University of Texas, El Paso, is currently a Visiting Researcher at the UCLA Chicano Studies Research Center and Institute of American Cultures. His work intersects Chicano/a, Latino/a, and Borderlands History and examines the history of the American Southwest, focusing on the matrix of race, class, and sexuality throughout the ethnic Mexican and Latino American past. In 2014, he received the American Historical Association’s Equity Award.\n\n(top)\n\nWednesday, April 22 / SCIENCE AND JUSTICE / “Fixing the Pathological Body” / 4:00-6:00pm / Engineering 2, Room 399\n\nThe medical industry leans heavily upon a distinction between the “normal” and the “pathological.” Panelists Janette Dinishak (Assistant Professor of Philosophy, UCSC) Kelly Ormond (Professor of Genetics, Stanford School of Medicine) and Matthew Wolf-Meyer (Associate Professor of Anthropology, UCSC) will discuss how we continue to define pathology, and what work this sort of categorization produces. We will discuss alternative ways to organize and understand the lived experiences of human bodies and/or minds.\n\n(top)\n\nThursday, April 23 / SOCIOLOGY COLLOQUIA / Bron Taylor / “Spirituality After Darwin: ‘Dark Green’ Nature Religion and the Future of Religion and Nature” / 12:00-1:45pm / College 8, Room 201\n\nNew Religions come and go but some persist and become major global forces. In this presentation Professor Taylor presents evidence that, especially since Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species in 1859, a new, global, earth religion has been rapidly spreading around the world. Whether it involves conventional religious beliefs in non- material divine beings, or is entirely naturalistic and involves no such beliefs, it considers nature to be sacred, imbued with intrinsic value, and worthy of reverent care. Those having affinity with such spirituality generally have strong feelings of belonging to nature, express kinship with non-human organisms, and understand the world to be deeply interconnected. In a recent book Taylor labeled such phenomena ‘dark green religion’, noting that its central ethical priority is to defend the earth’s biocultural diversity. Taylor provides a wide variety of examples of new forms of religious (and religion-resembling) cultural innovation among those promoting such nature spirituality, from individuals (including artists, scientists, filmmakers, photographers, surfers, and environmental activists), to institutions (including museums, schools, and the United Nations). By tracking these, Taylor provides an opportunity to consider what such spirituality may portend for the religious and planetary future.\n\nBron Taylor is Professor of Religion, Nature, and Environmental Ethics at the University of Florida, and a Carson Fellow of the Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society in Munich Germany.\n\n(top)\n\nThursday, April 23 / LIVING WRITER SERIES / Terri Witek & Jai Arun Ravine / 6:00-7:45pm / Humanities Lecture Hall, Room 206\n\nTerri Witek is the author of Exit Island, The Shipwreck Dress (both Florida Book Award medalists), Carnal World, Fools and Crows, Courting Couples (Winner of the 2000 Center for Book Arts Contest), First Shot at Fort Sumter/ Possum (a poetry/comics chapzine) and Robert Lowell and LIFE STUDIES: Revising the Self.

How was it created? An Uncommon Place traces decisive moments in the site’s early development. Here an innovative educational project engaged with a beautiful and challenging environment. The university took shape among steep ravines and dramatic trees in a way that respected as it transformed the landscape.

By the end of the 1970s, Dalit literature was recognized as a distinctive category of Marathi literature; newspapers and magazines devoted special supplements to discuss it and the Marathi literature Department of Bombay University hired faculty teaching Dalit literature. Three recurring themes of Marathi Dalit literature suggest the spatial entanglements that produced it: a) the revolutionary transformation of the self and society, a theme that borrowed from and resonated with the desire for revolutionary change across the world in the 1960s and 70s b) the depiction of housing as a symbol of Dalit marginality which this paper puts in the context of the urban transformation of Bombay city in which slums were an eyesore, but a political-economic necessity c) the representation of villages and Dalits in villages as the subject of backwardness that needed to be transformed with the raising of political consciousness. The themes of revolution, urban built environment, and rural/agrarian transformation also reflect the entanglements of spatial scales – global, regional/national, and urban/rural that shaped Dalit lives in Bombay city. In other words, the paper argues that the social space of Dalit literature in this period was shaped by events and processes that had different temporalities that were articulated in the city at the time of significant projects of urban transformation and regional and global political-economic change. I elucidate this point through the study of literature, housing reports, newspapers, and pamphlets.\n\n(top)\n\nWednesday, April 15 / VISUAL AND MEDIA CULTURES COLLOQUIA / Thomas Poell / “Social Media Mechanisms” / 4:00-6:00pm / Porter College, Room D245\n\nThomas Poell is Assistant Professor of New Media and Digital Culture at the University of Amsterdam.

Still, while it is a cliche to say that Muslim women are not a monolith, there is a tendency for many outside of Muslim contexts to seek a single solution to address this inequality.\n\nThis presentation will give a critical reading of Muslim women’s reform movements with emphasis on the historical evolution and epistemological distinctions of three major perspectives: secular Muslim women, Islamist women and the rise of Islamic feminists. While this could be seen as a dynamic history it is relatively short history and still unfolding. Islamic feminism is a pro-faith/pro-feminist movement to construct knowledge about Islamic thought and to use that construction to challenge patriarchal authority. This knowledge construction challenges policies that oppress women in the name of Islam and hopes to transform Muslim cultures from inequality to justice and reciprocity. In particular, this presentation will discuss Dr. Wadud’s experiences as a resource scholar with Musawah, a global movement for reform in Muslim family law.\n\nDr. Amina Wadud is an African American scholar of gender and Islam with a focus on Qur’an exegesis. She has taught at the Islamic University of Malaysia, the Virginia Commonwealth University, and the Gadjah Mada University of Indonesia. Her first book, Qur’an and Woman: Rereading the Sacred Text from a Woman’s Perspective (1999), contributes a gender-inclusive reading to one of the most fundamental disciplines in Islamic thought, Qu’ranic exegesis. Her latest book, Inside the Gender Jihad: Women’s Reform in Islam (2006) continues her Qur’anic analysis but also provides extensive details about her experiences as a Muslim, wife, mother, sister, scholar, and activist.\n\n(top)\n\nFriday, April 17 / FRIDAY FORUM FOR GRADUATE RESEARCH / Evan Grupsmith / “Revolutionary Movement: Class Based Inclusion and Exclusion in the Cultural Revolution Chuanlian Movement” / 12:00-1:30pm / Humanities 1, Room 202\n\nIn late 1966, young people started to traverse the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to exchange revolutionary experiences. To encourage and direct Red Guard travel, the Cultural Revolution Small Group (the highest governmental authority during this time period) decreed that all “revolutionary students and teachers and Red Guards” would be able to travel for free in the PRC. Millions of people jumped at this opportunity and traveled all over the country. This movement was dubbed chuanlian (串连). Chuanlian was one of the dominant political activities for urban youth in the PRC. Grupsmith’s research shows, through looking at both state and first-person accounts, that the chuanlian movement was driven by interactions of autonomous Red Guards and the state (exemplified by state media and the Cultural Revolution Small Group). Chuanlian activities were initiated by autonomously acting Red Guards. The state reacted by encouraging the movement and channeling it through propaganda and provision of free travel and lodging, while simultaneously attempting to exclude those that had “bad” class backgrounds. State encouragement caused a drastic increase in Red Guard chuanlian activity. Red Guards largely rejected these class based exclusionary policies, and the movement was characterized by widespread cross-class participation.\n\nThe Friday Forum is a graduate-run colloquium dedicated to the presentation and discussion of graduate student research. The series will be held weekly from 12:00 to 1:30PM and will serve as a venue for graduate students in the Humanities, Social Sciences, and Arts divisions to share and develop their research.

Unlike automated or algorithmic technologies that record extant sites and artifacts, building a three-dimensional computer model of an ephemeral or long-demolished environment combines traditional historical methods with new technologies and results in an entirely new form of scholarly publication. Rather than a printed monograph, the hours spent in search of obscure details buried in primary source materials or pouring over archival manuscripts and photographs are transformed into an interactive learning environment for interrogation by students and secondary scholars. Using her computer reconstruction of the World’s Columbian Exposition of 1893 as a case study, Snyder will address the process of researching and reconstructing historic urban environments, the challenges of translating multi-media research materials into a cohesive computer model, and the opportunities for teaching and learning afforded by this new form of scholarship. (And, yes, obsession will be discussed.)\n\nLisa M.

Every great hero, from Heracles to Achilles, tangled with warrior queens, and Theseus captured and married the Amazon Antiope. Were Amazons mere figments of the Greek imagination? Combining classical myth and art, nomad traditions, and scientific archaeology, this lecture reveals intimate, surprising details and original insights about the fighting women known as Amazons, with a special focus on Antiope.\n\nAdrienne Mayor’s most recent book is The Amazons: Lives and Legends of Warrior Women Across the Ancient World (Princeton 2014).

To examine the long-term effect of the insurgency on education, we use a large scale cross-sectional dataset – the 2005 India Human Development Survey. To explore the channels through which the conflict affected education, we use a unique historical dataset on the annual expenditure decisions by farmers (farm account surveys) for Punjab during 1978-1989. We combine both datasets with the annual district level data on major terrorist incidents from the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP). We find a substantial and statistically significant effect of terrorism on educational attainment by girls who were of school age during the conflict. We also identify the impact of terrorism at the household level. Households that had high ratios of girls to boys and who resided in the districts that experienced terrorist events, had reduced the amount of educational expenditures. This finding suggests that this reduction was one of the channels through which conflict affected education.\n\nPrakarsh Singh is Assistant Professor of Economics at Amherst College, Massachusetts.

In what ways can the law be said to decorate a body, and what does it mean to recognize legal personhood as being indebted to a sartorial imagination? This talk juxtaposes a significant but little known nineteenth-century immigration case and a much more celebrated nineteenth-century photo archive as two “primal” moments in the collusion between law, visuality, race, and gender and argues that the juridical making of the raced body is also the moment in which that body disappears. This is, in short, a story about the critical shift in law and in visual culture from racialized visibility to racialized visuality, a turn that takes place as early as the nineteenth century and continues to impact how we think about race and visuality today.\n\nAnne Anlin Cheng is Professor of English and the Center for African American Studies and Director for the Program in American Studies at Princeton University.

How was it created? An Uncommon Place traces decisive moments in the site’s early development. Here an innovative educational project engaged with a beautiful and challenging environment. The university took shape among steep ravines and dramatic trees in a way that respected as it transformed the landscape. Using architectural plans, photographs, and oral histories, the exhibition illustrates paths taken and not taken-decisions, constraints, and hopes. It celebrates the achievement of UCSC’s founding planners while analyzing the tensions and contradictions that were built into their project. Through its many subsequent transformations, the UC Santa Cruz campus remains an extraordinary work of environmental art.\n\nRemembering these formative years can perhaps help us renew a powerful utopian experiment.

At the same time, archaeology was transformed into a structured discipline and large-scale excavation projects commenced across the Mediterranean. The stories of the people behind the antiquities trade in Greece during the 19th century—the diplomats stationed in Athens, the local art dealers and the private diggers—help us write an important chapter in the social, economic, and cultural history of Europe and of Mediterranean archaeology as a whole. This lecture explores how the commodification of the past became interwoven with power politics and gave rise both to different attitudes toward collecting and to debates on cultural property, ownership and the value of things in our modern world.\n\nYannis Galanakis is Lecturer in Classics (Greek Prehistory), Faculty of Classics, University of Cambridge Fellow and Director of Studies in Classics, Sidney Sussex College.\n\nFor more information, please contact hedrick@ucsc.edu\n\n(top)\n\nFriday, April 10 / DEPARTMENT OF LANGUAGES AND APPLIED LINGUISTICS / “An Evening of Futuristic Musical Poetry with Luciano Chessa” / 5:00-6:00pm / Humanities 2, Room 259\n\nAn evening with Italian composer, performer, and musicologist Luciano Chessa.

Her worldview as intellectual, lesbian of color, poet, teacher privileges the knowledge that comes from experiencing life in-between spaces—the border dweller, the queer, the colored, and the mestiza. Embracing ambiguity, liminality and border thinking, Anzaldúa affirms life from within these spaces. Her call for women of color, particularly lesbians of color, to write, engage and interrogate the world, challenges the hegemony of knowledge production and categorical logic. The movement of U.S. third world feminists that Anzaldúa initiates centers coalitional politics and intersectional analysis of the lived experiences of women of color, yet there continues to be a problem of legibility, a misrecognition and appropriation of the theoretical contributions of these writers (Perez, 2010). The issue of legibility deflects scholars’ attention from engaging Anzaldúan thought in the critical ways that it deserves.\n\n(top)\n\nMonday, March 9 / FILM + DIGITAL MEDIA VISITING ARTIST SERIES / Caroline Martel / “Wavemakers” / 7:00pm / Communications 150 (Studio C)\n\nWednesday, March 11 / EDUCATION DEPARTMENT / Funie Hsu / “The Coloniality of the English-Only Movement: Race, Language, and Power” / 12:00-1:45pm / McHenry 0266 (Ground Floor)\n\nThursday, March 12 / SIKH AND PUNJABI STUDIES / Baagi & Hoodini / Sikh Rappers & Social Justice / 6:00-7:30pm / Humanities 1, Room 210\n\nFriday, March 13 / FRIDAY FORUM FOR GRADUATE RESEARCH / Jessica Calvanico / “Collections of Subjections” / 12:00-1:30pm / Humanities 1, Room 202\n\nSaturday, March 14 / SHAKESPEARE WORKSHOP / “Shakespeare and Music” / 1:00-4:30pm / Digital Arts Research Center (DARC) Dark Lab, Room 108\n\n* To advertise your unit or department’s event in the “Of Interest” section of this weekly bulletin, please e-mail complete event information in text format (no PDFs) to cult@ucsc.edu no later than noon on Friday of the prior week.\n\n* Additional information and regular updates on many “Of Interest” events can be found on the IHR website.\n\nOF-INTEREST EVENT DESCRIPTIONS:\n\nMonday, March 9 / FILM + DIGITAL MEDIA VISITING ARTIST SERIES / Caroline Martel / “Wavemakers” / 7:00pm / Communications 150 (Studio C)\n\nCaroline Martel has been synthesizing documentary theory and practice for over a decade, with a special interest in archives, invisible histories, and audio/visual technologies and heritage.

Drawing from a combination of memos from colonial administrators, reports of the War Department, educational reports, political cartoons and other primary sources, this talk pays special attention to the historical cases of settler and overseas colonialism as enacted through English instruction policies directed for Native American, Filipino, and Puerto Rican populations. It concludes with a discussion of the implications of coloniality and the English-Only movement and highlights the need for anti-colonial and liberatory English instruction practices.\n\nFunie Hsu, Ph.D. is a University of California President’s Postdoctoral Fellow at the UC Davis School of Education. She received her Ph.D. from the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Education in Policy Organization Measurement and Evaluation with a Designated Emphasis in Women, Gender and Sexuality.\n\n(top)\n\nThursday, March 12 / SIKH AND PUNJABI STUDIES / Baagi & Hoodini / Sikh Rappers & Social Justice / 6:00-7:30pm / Humanities 1, Room 210\n\nSikh hip-hop artists Baagi and Hoodini will explore facets of the immigrant and minority experience in multicultural America, in an evening of music, poetry and collective discussion.\n\nBaagi—“Babbey nu Kanna, Gaggay nu Bihari.” In spelling the word “Baagi,” the celebration of a rebellious Punjabi heritage is reborn. Baagi is one of the few artists to rap exclusively in Panjabi. Born and raised in Bombay until moving to Los Angeles in his early teens, Baagi brings a unique perspective both to Hip-Hop and to the evolution of Punjabi culture. A childhood passion for composing Punjabi poetry coupled with his love for Hip-Hop eventually turned an after-school hobby into a career of expression. This artist uses Farsi, Hindi and Panjabi vocabulary to add a new voice to the musical conglomerate. Baagi uses his platform to paint pictures of social issues, easygoing personal anecdotes, and day-to-day experiences, as seen through the lens of a young man influenced by the intersections of many worlds. His debut album, titled Baagi Di Vaari, is available for free download at http://beabaagi.bandcamp.com. You can follow him on Twitter @BaagiMedia.\n\nHoodini—Hoodini, also known as Hoodeez the Hindoo, has been hailed as “one of the most lyrical and charismatic emcees of South Asian descent” by critics. The poet and Hip-Hop artist combines witty wordplay, lyrical agility, and keen storytelling to present a novel narrative to his audience with natural ease. In listening to a Hoodini record, you may easily find yourself migrating from a commentary on issues of race relations to a jaunty reminiscence of a past love interest, often within the same verse. Hoodeez has released four studio albums to date and has shared the stage with notable Hip-Hop artists including Blu, Pacific Division, Skeme, and RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan. You can keep up with his latest works at http://HoodiniDidIt.com and on Twitter @HoodiniDidIt.\n\n(top)\n\nFriday, March 13 / FRIDAY FORUM FOR GRADUATE RESEARCH / Jessica Calvanico / “Collections of Subjections” / 12:00-1:30pm / Humanities 1, Room 202\n\nJessica Calvanico is a first year doctoral student in Feminist Studies.

Ghadarites called for and attempted the overthrow of British colonial rule in India during WWI, seeking a caste-free, secular and independent Indian nation. Ghadar was overwhelmingly initiated by and composed of Sikh laborers from the North American West and became a worldwide movement drawn from people of all castes and religions. San Francisco was home to the movement’s public office and its weekly newspaper, Ghadar, and has often been logged as the movement’s birthplace, especially by historians of the North American West. But remote Astoria, Oregon holds this distinction. Drawing on Indian historical accounts, oral histories and Oregon archival materials, Ms. Ogden both repopulates the East Indian community in Oregon and traces reasons for and key moments in Ghadar’s seemingly unlikely genesis there. Her larger interest, however, is exploring the dis-remembering of East Indians in Oregon and the window it provides into the targeting of Arabs, Muslims and South Asians in post-9/11 America.\n\nJohanna Ogden is an independent historian and activist from Oregon. In 2013 she initiated and was the consulting historian for Astoria’s two-day Ghadar Party Centenary Commemoration and in 2014 participated in an international conference on Ghadar in Chandigarh, Punjab. Her most recent publications include the award-winning “Ghadar, Historical Silences & Notions of Belonging” Oregon Historical Quarterly, Summer 2012; “Ghadar’s Oregon Roots,” The Ghadar Movement: Background, Ideology, Action and Legacies (Punjabi Uni: 2013).

We seek an analysis of the historical relationship between anti-black and anti-brown violence in the U.S. in the hopes of strengthening cross-racial solidarities. We seek to raise awareness about the intersections between racialization and economic violence, between police brutality and mass incarceration, and between intimate and state-based gender violence. We are interested in building connections between those who are grieving the loss of their loved ones, those who fight to stay alive despite the injustices of the U.S. justice system, and those who mobilize poetic imaginaries to build the world anew.\n\nFor more details see the IHR website.\n\n(top)\n\nMonday & Tuesday, Feb 23-24 / UC PRESIDENTIAL CHAIR IN FEMINIST CRITICAL RACE & ETHNIC STUDIES / Film Screenings: “Anita: Speaking Truth to Power” / Various Times & Locations (See below)\n\nWednesday, Feb 25 / FILM + DIGITAL MEDIA WEDNESDAY NIGHT CINEMA / “The Interview” & “A New Product” / 7:00pm / Studio C (Communications 150)\n\nThursday, Feb 26 / FILM + DIGITAL MEDIA DEPARTMENT / Thomas Poell / “How are Facebook and Twitter Entangled in Activist Communication?” / 10:00-11:45am / Oakes, Room 105\n\nThursday, Feb 26 / ITALIAN STUDIES PROGRAM / Dacia Maraini / A Dramatic Reading of Dacia Maraini’s Play “Norma ’44” / 4:00-5:30pm / Cowell Provost House\n\nThursday, Feb 26 / UC PRESIDENTIAL CHAIR IN FEMINIST CRITICAL RACE & ETHNIC STUDIES / Anita Hill / “Speaking Truth to Power: Gender & Racial Equality 1991-2015” / 5:30-7:30pm / College 9/10 Multipurpose Room\n\nFriday, Feb 27 / FRIDAY FORUM FOR GRADUATE RESEARCH / Tracy Perkins / “From Protest to Policy: The Political Evolution of California Environmental Justice Activism, 1980s-2010s” / 12:00-1:30pm / Humanities 1, Room 202\n\nFriday, Feb 27 / ITALIAN STUDIES PROGRAM / Dacia Maraini / “An Evening with Italian Writer: Dacia Maraini” / 5:15-7:00pm / Cowell, Room 131\n\n* To advertise your unit or department’s event in the “Of Interest” section of this weekly bulletin, please e-mail complete event information in text format (no PDFs) to cult@ucsc.edu no later than noon on Friday of the prior week.\n\n* Additional information and regular updates on many “Of Interest” events can be found on the IHR website.\n\nMonday & Tuesday, Feb 23-24 / UC PRESIDENTIAL CHAIR IN FEMINIST CRITICAL RACE & ETHNIC STUDIES / Film Screenings: “Anita: Speaking Truth to Power”\n\nTwo separate film screenings.

School drop outs, university graduates, people who have to be retrained, the long-term unemployed, recovered drug addicts and mid-term managers – all of them are supposed to learn how to how to market and sell themselves, a skill to which the term “self-management” is applied. It was Kafka who likened being accepted for a job to entering the Kingdom of Heaven; the paths leading to both of them are completely uncertain.

These social media-enabled connections are, however, by no means smooth and unproblematic. In this lecture, Thomas Poell, Assistant Professor of Media Studies at the University of Amsterdam, will discuss some of the key complicating issues. First, the discussion will focus on language, or rather the multiplicity of languages used in global activist communication. Subsequently, the focus will shift to the social media platforms themselves. Far from constituting neutral communication platforms, these media very much shape the character of activist mobilization and communication. Finally, the lecture will highlight the role played by national states. A number of authoritarian states, most prominently China and Iran, have made far-reaching efforts to control online communication flows by filtering ‘harmful’ content, and by promoting national social platforms.\n\n(top)\n\nThursday, Feb 26 / ITALIAN STUDIES PROGRAM / Dacia Maraini / A Dramatic Reading of Dacia Maraini’s Play “Norma ’44” / 4:00-5:30pm / Cowell Provost House\n\nAdapted for the stage from the translation by Monica Streifer and Lucia Re\n\nDirected by Kimberly Jannarone (UCSC Theater Arts)\n\nSet in an unnamed concentration camp in 1944 Germany, Norma ’44 tells the story of the perverse bond that grows between two female prisoners and the SS officer who coerces them into a performance of Bellini and Romani’s bel canto opera, Norma.

Anita Hill testified about Thomas’ inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace when he served as Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights in the Department of Education and Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Her testimony before a television audience of 22 million put the issues of sexual harassment on the national agenda.

Among the most prominent of these was the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency (UNRRA), the mission of which was to aid countries negatively impacted by the military campaigns. The British Government of India strongly signaled its support even as the subcontinent weathered the effects of one the worst famines ever encountered in the region. UNRRA was based in the United States and led by several men who considered themselves friends of India, most notably famed New Yorkers Herbert Lehman and Fiorello LaGuardia. Over the next several years, UNRRA pushed to create an Indian office and to incorporate Indians into administration based in the US, in a good faith effort to circumvent charges of imperial complicity. So the agency leadership was especially surprised when they ran into resistance from India’s anti-colonial icons. UNRRA was too blind to the pernicious stranglehold of imperialism the Indians believed, and so had to be challenged, even as it was admired. The encounter thus exemplifies colonial India’s efforts to challenge and undo Great Power/Global North/Western control of UN bureaucracies from the outset, and to reset both the tone and the substance of international relations by insisting on shared responsibilities and mutual respect.\n\nManu Bhagavan is the Chair of the Human Rights Program at the Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute and a Professor of History at Hunter College and the Graduate Center at the City University of New York.

Farocki’s and Andrei Ujica’s Videograms shows the Romanian revolution of December 1989 in Bucharest in a new media-based form of historiography. Demonstrators occupied the television station in Bucharest and broadcast continuously for 120 hours, thereby establishing the television studio as a new historical site. Between December 21, 1989 (the day of Ceaucescu’s last speech) and December 26, 1989 (the first televised summary of his trial), the cameras recorded events at the most important locations in Bucharest, almost without exception. The determining medium of an era has always marked history, quite unambiguously so in that of modern Europe. As we know, the 20th century is filmic. But only the videocamera, with its heightened possibilities in terms of recording time and mobility, can bring the process of filming history to completion. Provided, of course, that there is history.\n\n(top)\n\nThursday, Feb 19 / LIVING WRITERS SERIES / John Jota Leaños / 6:00-7:45pm / Humanities Lecture Hall, Room 206\n\nJohn Jota Leaños is an award-winning Chicano new media artist using animation, documentary and performance focusing on the convergence of memory, social space and decolonization.

On the one hand, we associate it with great art – Botticelli, Michelangelo, Petrarch – and on the other hand, we associate it with anthropocentrism and narcissism. But popular notions of narcissism threaten to obscure what Renaissance humanists found so appealing in Narcissus’s story and its accompanying aesthetic, an aesthetic that finds beauty in sameness. For this talk, I turn to the poetry of Pierre de Ronsard and examine his development of the formal features of this aesthetic in his elegy for Narcissus. Narcissus, of course, is only half of the story, however, and while Ronsard’s Narcissus elegy lays bare a particular cultural construction of beauty, his engagement with Echo’s story in a later poem, “Contre les bûcherons” (“Against the woodcutters”), bespeaks his anxieties about what that construction entails. His uneasiness, which bears a proleptic relationship to our own uneasiness about humanism, manifests itself as a nascent form of ecocriticism that is tethered to a narcissistic speaker; I call it Echo-criticism.\n\nMelissa Yinger is a doctoral candidate in the department of literature. Her work focuses on lyric poetry of the Italian, French, and English Renaissance, and the works of William Shakespeare. She recently co-wrote an essay with Michael Ursell called “Shakespeare’s Books,” for The Ashgate Research Companion to Shakespeare and Classical Literature (forthcoming in 2016). For Friday Forum, Melissa will be presenting on the importance of Ovid’s Narcissus and Echo myth to the development of Renaissance humanism and poetics, as focalized through two poems by Pierre de Ronsard.\n\nThe Friday Forum is a graduate-run colloquium dedicated to the presentation and discussion of graduate student research. The series will be held weekly from 12:00 to 1:30PM and will serve as a venue for graduate students in the Humanities, Social Sciences, and Arts divisions to share and develop their research. Light refreshments will be available.\n\nFor more info, or to inquire about joining the roster of presenters for Spring quarter contact: fridayforum.ucsc@gmail.com\n\n(top)\n\nFriday, Feb 20 / CRITICAL RACE AND ETHNIC STUDIES / Steven Salaita / Public Talk, “Silencing Dissent: Palestine, Academic Freedom, and the New McCarthyism” / 2:00-4:00pm / Humanities I, Room 210\n\nDr. Steven Salaita is the author of six books, including Israel’s Dead Soul, Modern Arab American Fiction: A Reader’s Guide, The Holy Land in Transit: Colonialism and the Quest for Canaan, and Anti-Arab Racism in the USA: Where it Comes From and What it Means for Politics.\n\nCo-sponsored by the Center for the Study of Labor, the IHR Cultures in the Crisis of Capitalism Research Cluster, Students for Justice in Palestine, UAW 2865, the Santa Cruz Resource Center for Non-Violence, and the Palestine-Israel Action Committee.\n\n(top)\n\nMonday, Feb 9 / CRISIS IN THE CULTURES OF CAPITALISM / Ching Kwan Lee / “Buying Stability in China: Markets, Protests and Authoritarianism” / 4:00-6:00pm / Humanities 1, Room 210\n\nMonday, Feb 9 / ITALIAN STUDIES / Robert Davis / “The Socio-Economy of Head Hunting in Late Renaissance Italy” / 5:00-6:30pm / Stevenson Fireside Lounge\n\nTuesday, Feb 10 / CENTER FOR EMERGING WORLDS / Noah Salomon / “Understanding Conflict in South Sudan” / 6:30-7:30pm / Social Sciences 2, Room 75\n\nTuesday, Feb 10 / Institute of the Arts and Sciences / LASER: Leonardo Art/Science Evening Rendezvous / 6:45pm / DARC Room 108\n\nWednesday, Feb 11 / CENTER FOR EMERGING WORLDS / Noah Salomon / “When the State is Everywhere: Rethinking the Islamic Public Sphere” / 3:15-4:45pm / Humanities 1, Room 202\n\nWednesday, Feb 11 / FILM + DIGITAL MEDIA WEDNESDAY NIGHT CINEMA / “Indoctrination” & “A Day in the Life of Consumers” / 7:00pm / Studio C (Communications 150)\n\nThursday, Feb 12 / CENTER FOR EMERGING WORLDS / Noah Salomon / Manuscript Reading Seminar: “The People of Sudan Love You, Oh Messenger of God”/ 10:00am-12:00pm / Social Sciences 1, Room 261\n\nThursday, Feb 12 / LIVING WRITERS SERIES / Luis Alfaro / 6:00-7:45pm / Humanities Lecture Hall, Room 206\n\nFriday, Feb 13 / CHICANO LATINO RESEARCH CENTER / Carmen Boullosa / “Texas: The Great Theft” / 10:00am-12:00pm / Humanities 1, Room 210\n\nFriday, Feb 13 / FRIDAY FORUM FOR GRADUATE RESEARCH / Delio Vásquez / “Criminalized Politics and Politicized Crime: Illegal Black Resistance in the 60s and 70s” / 12:00-1:30pm / Humanities 1, Room 202\n\nFriday, Feb 13 / HISTORY DEPARTMENT / Martin Devecka / “Polly Want a Caesar?
