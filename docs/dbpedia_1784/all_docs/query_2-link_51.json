        "text": "What is Deep Springs?\n\nFounded in 1917, Deep Springs College is a unique institution of higher learning. The educational program is built upon three pillars: academics, student self-government, and manual labor. The school is located forty miles from Bishop, California on an isolated cattle ranch in Deep Springs Valley. Between twelve and fifteen students are admitted each year. Each receives a full scholarship; the college covers the costs of tuition, room, and board for every student offered admission. In exchange, Deep Springs students are expected to dedicate themselves to lives of service to humanity. Alumni have gone on to exemplify this ideal in a variety of fields, including politics, science, journalism, academics, agriculture, medicine, law, business, and design.\n\nThe three pillars, which comprise students’ formal responsibilities in their two years at the college, prompt each student to take real responsibility for and ownership of the community. Students are expected to bring a high level of preparation and engagement to their classes, which are generally constructed around seminar-style discussion and often have fewer than eight participants. The Student Body is responsible for many aspects of running the College, admitting students, hiring faculty, and reviewing student and faculty performance. Each student also labors roughly twenty hours each week. Labor positions include working on the farm and ranch, as well as daily tasks of cooking, cleaning, and maintaining facilities and vehicles.\n\nSince the founding of Deep Springs in 1917, four other Nunnian institutions have come into existence. Each is built around the three pillars of Labor, Academics, and Self-Governance. While their approaches vary, each is oriented towards the development of their students’ moral characters in addition to their minds. These include Gull Island Institute, in Massachusetts; Tidelines Institute and Outer Coast in Alaska; and Thoreau College, in Wisconsin.\n\nTogether with the Telluride Association, founded in 1911, these compose The League of Nunnian Schools. The League aims to support existing and developing Nunnian projects in America and around the world. If you have questions, requests, or would like to otherwise contact the League, please write to comcom@deepsprings.edu.\n\nTo make a gift to the most innovative and transformative college in the world and join our mailing list, please visit our giving page here.\n\nLike the rest of life at Deep Springs, academics is a study in responsibility and cooperation, as well as the course material. Classes are small—the average is eight students. With such small classes, thorough preparation and class participation are essential and expected.\n\nThere are no majors. Most students take two to three classes per semester, choosing from offerings in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences and the arts. Many classes are discussion-based. A sample of recent course offerings include Conservation Science, Aristotle’s Ethics, Painting, Mathematics in Political Life, The Modern Essay, Race and Education, Magical Realism, War and Peace in the Congo, and The Poetry of Emily Dickinson.\n\nThe distinctive quality of the Deep Springs academic program is that it treats students not as consumers but as creators of their education and as stewards of a joint intellectual project. The Curriculum Committee (staffed and chaired by students) selects the college’s professors, and the Student Body determines each semester’s curriculum by choosing courses from a variety of proposals submitted by each professor. As mentioned above, classes rely heavily on student participation; thorough preparation and robust engagement is seen as a student’s responsibility to the entire class. Students not only drive most class conversations but are also responsible for thinking critically on how each course can improve, attempting to improve their own participation, giving feedback to other students and the professor, and often helping decide questions of class structure.\n\nAfter completing Deep Springs’ two-year program, most students transfer to four-year institutions to finish their BA or BS. Students receive support and guidance throughout the transfer process. Many students go on to world-class universities including Yale, Stanford, Brown, and Chicago.\n\nIn addition to their academic and self-governance responsibilities, each student at Deep Springs works approximately twenty hours a week. Students do everything from milking our two dairy cows, to irrigating our 155-acre alfalfa farm, to cooking meals and cleaning the community’s dishes three times a day. Most students switch labor positions every two months, though some positions require a four month commitment.\n\nWhile students learn how to be useful on a farm, most do not go on to work in agriculture. Deep Springs is a fully operational cattle ranch and alfalfa farm – we sell our hay and our beef – but the labor pillar is valued most for its pedagogical function. Work is not conducted in exchange for the scholarship. Rather, the labor program allows students to contemplate their role in a community, to practice working hard, and to foster a sense of ownership and responsibility."
