Topics include the basic analytic geometry of graphs of functions, and the properties of functions, including limits, continuity, derivatives and basic integration. Applications to the biological and social sciences will be discussed, and the course is designed to meet the needs of students in these disciplines.\n\nAdditional Details: This course is part of a two course sequence and precedes AS.110.107 Calculus II (Biology and the Social Sciences). Students planning to take this course must demonstrate a proficiency in pre-calculus, either through the successful completion of a prior course in pre-calculus (such as AS.110.105) or by achieving an adequate score in the Placement Exam I offered by the Mathematics Department.
