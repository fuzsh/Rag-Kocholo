This exhibition uses images, manuscripts, artefacts and extracts from publications and correspondence to situate Walpole within the burgeoning philanthropic culture of his age. It will reveal Walpole’s secret giving to prisoners and other good causes and examine the principles which underlay his philanthropy. A main aim of the exhibition will be to stimulate discussion about philanthropy today. Walpole wrote that ‘if it ever is justifiable to good sense to act romantically, it is by being the knights errant of the distressed’. The exhibition will unravel contradictions in Walpole’s approach to philanthropy, illuminate the importance of charitable giving in the eighteenth century, and open up for the first time this most intimate, often hidden, aspect of Walpole’s life.\n\nThis exhibition is also available online.

She was a woman of independent means with a commitment to do good to causes dear to her, albeit quietly. She is best known for her support of her husband Wilmarth Sheldon Lewis (1895-1979), Yale class of 1918, co-founder of the Lewis Walpole Library, executive editor of the Yale Edition of Horace Walpole’s Correspondence, and a prominent member of the Yale Corporation. As described by Louis Auchincloss, “Lefty’s whole life was dedicated to Walpole and would have been impossible without the money that Annie Burr lovingly and happily poured into his project. They worked together in everything and brought the eighteenth century to life for innumerable students and readers in their beautiful house in Farmington, now part of the university.”\n\nFar less has been written about her independent philanthropic activities, and indeed far fewer written records survive. A granddaughter of O.B. Jennings, whose fortune was founded on Standard Oil, Annie Burr grew up in a world where strong women in her circle set examples of civic engagement, including charitable fundraising and other philanthropic contributions. Throughout her life, Annie Burr kept the close friendships she had formed during her days as a debutante in New York and a student at Miss Porter’s School in Farmington, Connecticut, ties that were further strengthened when some of these friends married Yale men, as she had done in 1928 when she wed Lewis. Shaped by her family’s history of philanthropic endeavors, her personal interests and interpersonal connections influenced her choice of causes to support.\n\nThis exhibition explores the impact Annie Burr Lewis had during her lifetime and the legacy of her service and contributions to organizations involved in education, historic preservation, and nursing. These interests often overlapped in her involvement at Yale University, in Farmington, Connecticut, elsewhere in New England, and nationally. Annie Burr Lewis’s undeniably privileged upbringing positioned her to take a leading role in philanthropic endeavors. That she followed the path laid out for her by family and societal tradition may not be remarkable. But the direction that path took, the financial autonomy she enjoyed, and the lasting contribution to her world and the communities of today make her otherwise typical journey uniquely hers.\n\nAll items in the exhibition are in the archives of the Lewis Walpole Library in Farmington. Most can be found in the Annie Burr Lewis Papers.\n\nVideorecording of Annie Burr Lewis’s Legacy of Philanthropy and Service in Farmington and Beyond talk by exhibition curator Susan Odell Walker for joint Lewis Walpole Library-Farmington Libraries series of exhibition-related lectures.

In this exhibition, we examine this paradox of “artful nature” through the changing conception of theatricality during these decades, as mirrored and expressed in fashionable dress. Theater and performance practices in the late eighteenth-century, including the vogue for private theatricals, reinforced the blurred lines between the theater and everyday life. Classical sculpture became a reference point for women, as its artistic excellence was acclaimed precisely because it seemed so “natural.” But when actresses, dancers, painters, or just regular fashionistas posed themselves as classical statues come to life, they acted as both Pygmalion and Galatea, both the genius artist and the living artwork. “Artful Nature” refers simultaneously to the theatricality and deception typically attributed to fashionable women in the late eighteenth century, and at the same time to the potential survival strategies employed by women artists, authors, and actresses to craft their own parts.

Lewis\n\nSeptember 20, 2019 to January 24, 2020\n\nWilmarth S. “Lefty” Lewis (Yale Class of 1918) devoted the better part of his life to building the world’s greatest collection relating to Horace Walpole (1717–97), the British writer, collector and historian. He also championed Walpole’s importance as a figure in English eighteenth-century life, doing so most effectively as general editor and guiding spirit of the Yale Edition of Horace Walpole’s Correspondence (Yale University Press, 1937-83), whose 48 volumes are widely acknowledged to this day as a model of scholarship in historical editing.\n\nThis fall’s exhibition, Rescuing Horace Walpole: The Achievement of W.S. Lewis, pays tribute to Lewis’s life and legacy as a scholar-collector, on the fortieth anniversary of his bequest of the Lewis Walpole Library to his alma mater, Yale University. Drawing heavily on the recently cataloged Lewis archives, the exhibition shows how the total dedication of the collector resulted in a collection of extraordinary range and depth, and expressed itself in some surprising ways. It also evolved into a monumental achievement of scholarship in the Yale-Walpole edition and, in the process, transformed perceptions of Walpole and his age. View the online exhibit\n\nA related symposium, Scholarly Editing of Literary Texts from the Long Eighteenth Century , on September 21st, in New Haven, will explore the past, present, and future of scholarly editions of the collected works and correspondences of early modern British writers, ranging from the Yale Horace Walpole (1717-1797) and Samuel Johnson (1709-1784) editions, via the Burney and Boswell papers to new editions now being planned for Alexander Pope (1688-1744) and Aphra Behn (1640?-1689).

The trial is famous among cultural historians as a media event; in law it is remembered for Lord Brougham’s argument that a lawyer’s only duty is “to save that client by all means and expedients.”\n\nThere will be an online component following the physical exhibition. For the online exhibition, Cynthia Roman and Mike Widener have invited several scholars from diverse disciplines, at Yale and beyond, including many former research fellows, to contribute a short note focused on an object or group of objects of their choice from the Queen Caroline-related collections. View the online exhibit\n\nTrial by Media: The Queen Caroline Affair will enable visitors to explore the rich resources at Yale on the topic of Queen Caroline and many scholarly perspectives from cultural and legal historians on this fascinating story.\n\nGlobal Encounters and the Archives: Britain’s Empire in the Age of Horace Walpole\n\nOctober 20, 2017 - March 2, 2018\n\nCurated by:\n\nJustin Brooks, Doctoral Candidate in History, Yale University\n\nHeather V. Vermeulen, , Ph.D., Lecturer in African American Studies, Yale University\n\nSteve Pincus, Bradford Durfee Professor of History, Yale University\n\nCynthia Roman, Curator of Prints, Drawings, and Paintings, The Lewis Walpole Library\n\nAs part of the year-long celebrations of the 300th anniversary of Horace Walpole’s birth, Global Encounters and the Archives: Britain’s Empire in the Age of Horace Walpole draws on the Lewis Walpole Library’s rich collections to bring Walpole’s global interests to light. As befitting the son of a prime minister (Sir Robert Walpole), the nephew of the auditor-general of the Revenue of America (Horatio Walpole), and the close friend of a secretary of state (Henry Seymour Conway) who oversaw important imperial affairs, Horace Walpole well understood the partisan conflicts that helped shape the British Empires. A lively collaboration between the Lewis Walpole Library and Yale faculty and graduate students, this exhibition takes full advantage of the diverse range of archival resources and special collections held by the library, including manuscripts, printed texts and graphic images in presenting conflicting visions of empire through the domains of political economy, diplomacy, slavery and indigenous peoples.\n\nIn addition to the physical exhibition, the library has also created an online version. This online exhibit includes images of the manuscripts, rare books, pamphlets, and prints featured in the exhibit together with label texts and essays written by the curators of the physical exhibition. View the online exhibit\n\nIn association with this exhibition, the library will sponsor a two-day conference in New Haven on February 9-10, 2018. The conference papers will present new archival-based research on Britain’s global empire in the long eighteenth century.\n\nView exhibition brochure\n\nThe Land without Music: Satirizing Song in Eighteenth-Century England\n\nMarch 1 through September 29, 2017\n\nCurated by\n\nAmy Dunagin\n\nPostdoctoral Associate, European Studies Council, Yale University, and Managing Editor, Eighteenth-Century Studies\n\nMusic pervaded public and private spaces in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century England; yet, in 1904, German critic Oscar Adolf Hermann Schmitz, heightening long-standing aspersions, dismissed England as a “land without music.” This unflattering epithet pointed to England’s meager contributions to the western musical canon during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries—no English Gluck, Mozart, or Verdi; no English operatic or symphonic tradition that could rival those that flourished on the continent. The English, critics like Schmitz suggested, were importers rather than producers—tasteless consumers and dilettantes rather than discerning, proficient practitioners. This view did not originate with continental nationalists; in the eighteenth century the English often presented themselves as uniquely unmusical in print and in visual satire. At once self-effacing and boastful, this representation asserted a national character too sensible, too chaste, too sober to permit the excesses of musical genius. Bringing together satirical prints and documents pertaining to English music makers and listeners, this exhibition explores English attitudes toward music as lascivious, feminine, foreign, frivolous, and distinctly un-English.\n\nView exhibition brochure\n\nCharacter Mongers, or, Trading in People on Paper in the Long 18th Century\n\nOctober 10, 2016 through January 27, 2017\n\nCo-curated by\n\nProfessor Rachel Brownstein, Professor Emerita, Brooklyn College and The Graduate Center, CUNY\n\nand\n\nDr. Leigh-Michil George, Instructor, Pasadena City College\n\nIn the course of the long eighteenth century—the Age of Caricature, and of The Rise of the Novel—the British reading public perfected the pastime of savoring characters. In a flourishing print culture, buying and selling likenesses of people and types became a business—and arguably an art. Real and imaginary characters—actual and fictional people—were put on paper by writers and graphic artists, and performed onstage and off. The exigencies of narrative, performance, and indeed of community conspired to inform views of other people—friend and foe, fat and thin—as tellingly, characters. “For what do we live,” Jane Austen’s Mr. Bennet would ask rhetorically in 1813, “but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn?”\n\nThis exhibit will feature images by William Hogarth, James Gillray, Thomas Rowlandson, Thomas Patch, Edward Francis Burney, Francis Grose, and G.M. Woodward, excerpts from novels by Jane Austen, Henry Fielding, and Laurence Sterne, and examples of graphic collections published by Matthew and Mary Darly and Thomas Tegg that marketed caricature as entertainment.\n\nView exhibition brochure\n\nJames Gillray’s Hogarthian Progresses\n\nApril 6 through September 16, 2016\n\nCurated by\n\nCynthia Roman\n\nCurator of Prints, Drawings, and Paintings, the Lewis Walpole Library\n\nSequential narration in satiric prints is most famously associated with the “modern moral subjects” of William Hogarth (1697–1764): Harlot’s Progress (1732), A Rake’s Progress (1735), Marriage A-la-Mode (1745), andIndustry and Idleness (1747) among others. Less well-known is the broad spectrum of legacy “progresses” produced by subsequent generations drawing both on Hogarth’s narrative strategies and his iconic motifs. James Gillray (1756–1815), celebrated for his innovative single-plate satires, was also among the most accomplished printmakers to adopt Hogarthian sequential narration even as he transformed it according to his unique vision. This exhibition presents a number of Gillray’s Hogarthian progresses alongside some selected prints by Hogarth himself.\n\nView exhibition brochure\n\nBawdy Bodies: Satires of Unruly Women\n\nSeptember 24, 2015 through February 26, 2016\n\nCo-curated by\n\nHope Saska, Curator of Collections and Exhibitions, University of Colorado Art Museum\n\nand\n\nCynthia Roman, Curator of Prints, Drawings, and Paintings, the Lewis Walpole Library with contributions by Jill Campbell (Department of English, Yale University)\n\nCharacterized by comically grotesque figures performing lewd and vulgar actions, bawdy humor provided a poignant vehicle to target a variety of political and social issues in eighteenth-century Britain. Bawdy Bodies: Satires of Unruly Women explores the deployment of this humorous but derisive strategy toward the regulation of female behavior. The exhibition presents satirical images of women from a range of subject categories including the royal family, aging members of fashionable society, disparaged mothers, political activists, gamblers, medical wonders, artists, performers, and intellectuals.\n\nView exhibition brochure\n\nView online exhibition\n\nProspects of Empire: Slavery and Ecology in Eighteenth-Century Atlantic Britain\n\nNovember 17, 2014 - May 1, 2015\n\nCurated by\n\nHeather V. Vermeulen, Doctoral Candidate in African American Studies and American Studies, Yale University\n\nand\n\nHazel V. Carby, Charles C. & Dorathea S. Dilley Professor of African American Studies and Professor of American Studies, Yale University\n\n“Prospects of Empire: Slavery and Ecology in Eighteenth-Century Atlantic Britain” explores the notion of empire’s “prospects”—its gaze upon bodies and landscapes, its speculations and desires, its endeavors to capitalize upon seized land and labor, as well as its failures to manage enslaved persons and unruly colonial ecologies. It reads latent anxieties in the policing of bodies and borders, both in the colonies and in the metropole, and examines the forces that empire mustered to curtail perceived threats to its regimes of power and knowledge. In addition to the focus on material from the long eighteenth century, the exhibition features a selection of four lithographs from Joscelyn Gardner’s series Creole Portraits III: “bringing down the flowers” (2009-11), a recent joint acquisition by the Yale Center for British Art and the Yale University Art Gallery. Gardner’s work mines the eighteenth-century Jamaica archive of white English immigrant, overseer, slaveowner, and pen-keeper Thomas Thistlewood, one of whose diaries is on loan from the Beinecke.\n\nView online exhibition\n\nView exhibition brochure\n\nA Collection’s Progress: The Lewis Walpole Library, 2000-2014\n\nApril 14 - October 3, 2014\n\nCurated by\n\nMargaret K. Powell, W.S. Lewis Librarian and Executive Director, the Lewis Walpole Library\n\nWhen Wilmarth Sheldon Lewis left his library to Yale in 1979 Lewis thought of his gift not as a finished monument but as a living thing that required growth and change lest it become, in his words, “static and moldy.” The exhibition presents materials selected from the LWL’s collecting successes of the last fourteen years. Together the objects on display argue forcefully for the Library’s conquest of stasis and mold, and each speaks eloquently of another time, its politics and conflicts, its arts, fashions, and pastimes.\n\nView exhibition brochure.\n\nEmma Hamilton Dancing\n\nOctober 16, 2013 - April 4, 2014\n\nCurated by\n\nJohn Cooper , Clare-Mellon Fellow in the History of Art, Yale University\n\nIn 1794 the dancing and Attitudes, or expressive postures, performed by Emma Hamilton (1761?-1815) were rendered in twelve neoclassical images engraved by Thomas Piroli after drawings by Frederick Rehberg. After the death of her husband Sir William Hamilton in 1803 and that of her lover Admiral Lord Nelson in 1805, Emma Hamilton and her Attitudes were the subject of a second, ‘enlarged’ edition of parodies by James Gillray in 1807 in which her person was dramatically inflated. Emma Hamilton Dancing displays these two editions beside each other for the first time.\n\nEmma Hamilton Dancing presents these Attitudes among images of the tarantella, the waltz, minuet, cotillion, and quadrille as well as prints of ballet dancing in the age of the ballet d’action and works on the theory and practice of dancing. In this context, the Attitudes are seen moving within the world of dancing in ballrooms and onstage in Europe during the era of revolution in America, France and the Kingdom of Naples.\n\nView the exhibition brochure\n\nEmma Hamilton Dancing: The Attitudes Performed\n\n“In the Midst of the Jovial Crowd”: Young James Boswell in London, 1762–1763\n\nApril - October 4, 2013\n\nCurated by\n\nJames Caudle, The Associate Editor, Yale Edition of the Private Papers of James Boswell\n\nIn autumn 1762, the ambitious, clever, jovial, and bumptious twenty-two-year-old Scotsman James Boswell traveled south from Edinburgh to London to seek his fortune in the capital. In his lively journal, he recorded his extraordinarily action-packed eight months there, and his efforts to become a permanent Londoner.\n\nLondon in the Sixties (the 1760s) was a thrilling place, full of pleasures and dangers, wisdom and folly, high life and low life. This exhibition aspires to place visitors ‘in the midst of the jovial crowd’ in which young James Boswell felt so alive and happy. Prints by Hogarth and Rowlandson and others, and rare books and ballads, will bring to life the current events, everyday social life, and personalities celebrated in Boswell’s London Journal, unpublished until 1950, but now one of the best-loved works of eighteenth-century life-writing.\n\nView the exhibition brochure\n\nDancing on a Sunny Plain: the Life of Annie Burr Auchincloss Lewis\n\nOctober 29, 2012 – March 22, 2013\n\nCurated by\n\nSusan Odell Walker, Head of Public Services\n\nCelebrating their twentieth anniversary, Annie Burr Auchincloss Lewis (1902 – 1959) used Horace Walpole’s words to describe her partnership with Wilmarth Sheldon Lewis: “Life seems to me as if we were dancing on a sunny plain.” Annie Burr certainly shared her husband’s informed enthusiasm for Walpole, but her legacy extends beyond her well-known role as W.S. Lewis’s wife and partner. A gifted photographer and cataloger, she dedicated herself to family and friends, philanthropy and service. This exhibition, on view in Farmington through early 2013, explores her remarkable life through material selected from the Library’s rich archives.\n\nView the exhibition brochure\n\nThe exhibition brochure was awarded The Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) Rare Books and Manuscripts Section (RBMS) 2014 Katharine Kyes Leab and Daniel J. Leab “American Book Prices Current” Exhibition Award in the Division Three category.\n\n“The God of Our Idolatry”: Garrick and Shakespeare\n\nMarch 12 – August 8, 2012\n\nCurated by\n\nMargaret K. Powell, W. S. Lewis Librarian and Executive Director\n\nand\n\nJoseph R. Roach, Sterling Professor of Theater and English\n\n“The God of Our Idolatry”: Garrick and Shakespeare, showed off the extraordinary contribution the actor David Garrick, arguably the eighteenth century’s greatest man of the theatre, made to the age’s understanding of Shakespeare. Displaying printed texts, manuscript letters, drawings, prints, and portraits, the exhibition illustrated how, on stage and off, Garrick influenced the public’s view of Shakespeare, inspiring what Bernard Shaw later called “bardolatry.”\n\nThis exhibition was presented in connection with Shakespeare at Yale, a semester of events celebrating the Bard.\n\nView the exhibition brochure\n\nSacred Satire: Lampooning Religious Belief in Eighteenth-Century Britain\n\nSeptember 22, 2011 - March 2, 2012\n\nCurated by\n\nMisty Anderson, Associate Professor of English, University of Tennessee\n\nand\n\nCynthia Roman, Curator of Prints, Drawings, and Paintings, the Lewis Walpole Library\n\nReligious beliefs and practices provided ample subject matter for the irreverent printmakers producing graphic satire in eighteenth-century Britain. While clerical satire is an ancient mode, eighteenth-century British artists seized on it with fresh vigor. Satirists appropriated centuries-old themes like corruption, hypocrisy, and greed, but updated them with contemporary concerns about the role of religion in the age of enlightenments. The visual rhetoric of these prints illustrates some of the ways in which eighteenth-century Britons were renegotiating their relationship to religious practice and belief.\n\nThe prints in this exhibition reflect a tension between a vision of religion as part of traditional life and the emergence of modern Christianity as a collection of new movements, practices, and ideas about belief. The eighteenth-century images on display preserve for us a moment in an ongoing conversation about the relationship of religion, representation, and modernity.\n\nView the exhibition brochure\n\nCollection Highlights: Prints, Drawings, and Illustrated Books\n\nMay 3, 2010 - October 29, 2010\n\ncurated by\n\nCynthia Roman\n\nView exhibition brochure\n\nHorace Walpole’s Strawberry Hill\n\nOctober 15, 2009, - January 3, 2010\n\nYale Center for British Art, New Haven\n\nMarch 6 - July 4, 2010 Victoria and Albert Museum, London\n\nOrganized by The Lewis Walpole Library, the Yale Center for British Art, and the V&A\n\nThe exhibition catalogue was awarded the 2012 Philip Johnson Exhibition Catalogue Award by the Society of Architectural Historians\n\nWorks of Genius: Amateur Artists in Walpole’s Circle\n\nSeptember 28, 2009 - March 19, 2010\n\ncurated by\n\nCynthia Roman\n\nAn influential writer, collector and historian of art, Horace Walpole (1717-1797) was also a great champion of art produced by persons who were ‘not artists’—perhaps best translated today as non-professional or amateur artists.\n\nWorks by amateur artists were a vital part of Walpole’s collection and were hung prominently and in great number at his famous house Strawberry Hill. This exhibition presented work on paper by Walpole and members of his closest circle, including Henry William Bunbury, John Chute, Richard Bentley, Lady Diana Beauclerk, Lady Hamilton, and Mary Berry.\n\nView exhibition brochure\n\nFrench Liberty.
