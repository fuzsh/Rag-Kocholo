        "text": "The new German humanism\n\nThe “new humanism” that transformed German intellectual life in the late 18th century was a complex phenomenon, acting through scholarship, education, philosophy, and literature. Educationally the University of Göttingen played a leading part: there J.M. Gesner (1691–1761) and C.G. Heyne (1729–1812) introduced a new approach—an attempt to enter into the spirit of the past as displayed in its artistic monuments as well as in its literature. J.J. Winckelmann (1717–68) was the first to mark out the successive periods into which the history of Greek art falls. He was also the first to isolate and describe the essentially Hellenic element in Greek art and to relate the development of art in antiquity to other aspects of culture. He demonstrated that a large number of vases then known as Etruscan because they had been found in Etruscan cemeteries were in fact Greek, although the original error was to be perpetuated by Josiah Wedgwood, who named his pottery works “Etruria” in 1769. Winckelmann’s influence ranged over the literary as well as the academic world, powerfully affecting such figures as Lessing, Herder, and Goethe, who named the memorial essay that he published in 1805 Winckelmann und sein Jahrhundert (“Winckelmann and His Century”). Goethe (1749–1832) made a systematic effort to know and understand Greek art and literature, particularly Greek sculpture and the poetry of Homer, and to utilize them for his own purposes; it may be doubted whether anyone since ancient times had understood the Greeks so well. He was a friend of Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767–1835), the great statesman and pioneer of the study of language who founded Frederick William University (later the University of Berlin), which rapidly became the leading university of Europe.\n\nGoethe was also in touch with F.A. Wolf (1759–1824), a Göttingen pupil of Heyne. Wolf defined the “science of antiquity” (Altertumswissenschaft) and mapped out its constituent provinces and principles. Influenced by Herder, with his special interest in the early literatures of various peoples and their special characteristics, Wolf in his Prolegomena ad Homerum (1795) raised such questions about Homer as to give rise to a debate that has continued ever since. Goethe was at first carried away by Wolf’s theory that the Iliad and Odyssey were composed orally by a number of authors and that the artistic unity of the poems was a later imposition, but he eventually returned to his belief in an individual Homer, as scholars have done increasingly in the 20th century.\n\nAnother great classical scholar in close touch with Goethe was Gottfried Hermann (1772–1848), who continued the tradition of 18th-century rationalism, applying to the study of ancient poetry a critical method based on a strict Kantian logic. Hermann did much to advance the study of Homer, Pindar, late epic poetry, and Greek metre. By his editions of Sophocles, Aeschylus, and part of Euripides he effected a great and permanent improvement in the texts of these poets.\n\nHermann had many distinguished pupils, including C.A. Lobeck (1781–1860), a grammarian of great learning and acuteness, who in his famous book Aglaophamus (1829) refuted the seductive but dubious theory of the Heidelberg professor G.F. Creuzer that the mythology of Homer and Hesiod contained symbolic elements of an ancient Oriental revelation from which it was ultimately derived. August Meineke (1790–1870) did important work on Hellenistic poetry and produced an excellent edition of the fragments of Greek comedy. August Immanuel Bekker (1785–1871), a pupil of Wolf, took advantage of the accumulation in Paris of many previously inaccessible manuscripts from various countries following the Napoleonic conquests to make a valuable contribution to the texts of many prose authors. Wilhelm Dindorf (1802–83) edited many texts, including the scholia on Rome and on Demosthenes. With his brother Ludwig and K.B. Hase, he revised the great Greek Thesaurus of Henri Estienne. Hermann’s son-in-law Moritz Haupt (1808–74) did important work on Latin poetry. H.L. Ahrens (1809–81) wrote on the Greek dialects and on the bucolic poets. August Nauck (1822–92), who taught in St. Petersburg, made a notable contribution to the establishment of the texts of Greek tragedy.\n\nThe school of Hermann with its strong emphasis on linguistic study came occasionally into conflict with the representatives of a newer trend in the approach to antiquity. In Berlin August Boeckh (1785–1867) did important work on Greek poetry, particularly Pindar, but also established on a firm footing the study of Greek private and public economy and the systematic collection of Greek inscriptions. K.O. Müller (1797–1840), the author of an important history of Greek literature, which first appeared in English, was a pioneer of the study of Greek, Roman, and Etruscan origins and of the mythology of the different parts of Greece, which he believed could shed much light on early history. He was a strong upholder of the importance of art and archaeology in the study of antiquity, as was F.G. Welcker (1784–1868), who applied deep knowledge of Greek art and religion to the interpretation of literature and did much to shape the wider conception of the study of antiquity that was now coming to maturity."
