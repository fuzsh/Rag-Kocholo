        "text": "Arboretum Scientists\n\nWith state-of-the-art research and growth facilities nestled alongside over 16,000 living specimens (2,100 species), the Arnold Arboretum is uniquely positioned to ask broad and important questions in plant biology. Our scientists’ research is as diverse as our living collection, ranging from organismic and evolutionary biology, molecular and developmental biology, plant physiology, and ecological, environmental and biodiversity studies.

Leaf out time correlates with wood anatomy across large geographic scales and within local communities. New Phytologist 235: 953-64. Abstract\n\nSumashini Pagaldevatti\n\n2023 Ashton Award\n\nPhD Student, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n\nSumashini Pagaldevatti will examine the interaction between fungal pathogens and seeds and the impact of this interaction on the recruitment and diversification of plant species in tropical forests using common garden experiments. The Ashton Award will support her research in Western Ghats, India.\n\nWyatt Oswald\n\n2023 Sargent Award\n\nProfessor, Emerson College\n\nWyatt Oswald will combine historical information available in the archives of the Arnold Arboretum with the identification of pollen in a lake-sediment core from a pond on the estate of the first director of the Arnold Arboretum, Charles S. Sargent. This study will provide a detailed record of how the vegetation on the estate and woodlands has changed over time.\n\n2022 Awardees\n\nAparna Krishnan\n\n2022 Ashton Award\n\nPhD Student, Nature Conservation Foundation, India\n\nRestoring forests diminished or erased by human development is a strategy gaining traction globally to counter environmental degradation and climate change, but are these efforts effective? In the tropics, up to 90 percent of woody plants depend on animals for seed dispersal, a crucial factor in the long-term recovery of these ecosystems and their natural functioning. Aparna Krishan studies the negative impacts of human interference with these plant-animal interactions, and evaluates how restoration can help remedy the impacts. With support from the Ashton Award for Student Research, she is conducting field work to evaluate the recovery of animal seed dispersal following ecological restoration in degraded forest fragments of the Western Ghats Global Biodiversity Hotspot, India.\n\nAudrey Spencer\n\n2022 Deland Award\n\nPhD Student, University of Colorado, Denver, Denver Botanic Gardens\n\nAudrey Spencer is interested in a simple question: Which plants are where, and why? This seemingly simple question is surprisingly complex. With the Deland Award for Student Research, Audrey is delving into the question with a focus on Physocarpus which occupies a disjunction (or geographic separation) between eastern Asia and North America. These disjuncts typically have many more species in eastern Asia than in North America, the former being a hotspot of temperate biodiversity. Physocarpus offers an exception to this trend, with only one species in eastern Asia and six in North America. Additionally, Physocarpus has an identity problem. The seven Physocarpus species currently recognized by botanists have approximately 30 synonyms from four different genera, named over a 250-year period. By collecting over 250 samples representing some 70 populations of all seven recognized species of Physocarpus—including 14 samples from the Arboretum—Audrey will use sequence, morphological, and geographic data to clarify the taxonomy, systematics, and biogeography of Physocarpus.\n\nChau Pham\n\n2022 Ashton Award\n\nPhD Student, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities\n\nWith support from the Ashton Award for Student Research, Chau Pham is conducting field research to examine seedling regeneration in different dry-deciduous forests across Central and Southern Vietnam. Her research aims to understand potential factors that drive the distribution of dry-deciduous forests in Vietnam and their seedling regeneration patterns. These processes include topography, soil type, anthropogenic disturbance, and fire. Future field work will focus on one of these factors—fire—and its role in suppressing evergreen species and promoting grasses and deciduous species, as well as how the fire history of the region has shifted the distribution of deciduous forests and its implications for future fire management practices.\n\nChristina DeJoseph\n\n2022 Sinnott Award\n\nMasters Student, Tufts University\n\nNine chiropteran (bat) species native to the Northeast pollinate plants, disperse seeds, and manage insect populations, yet are threatened by white-nose syndrome, habitat destruction, and anthropogenic noise. As the planet becomes more urbanized, it is imperative to use cost-effective monitoring technology, such as acoustic recording devices, to investigate the biodiversity level in microhabitats throughout urban green spaces. Christina DeJoseph received a Sinnott Award to utilize ultrasonic and acoustic range monitors in eight microhabitats throughout the 281-acre Arboretum landscape to assess the presence and biodiversity of bat species based on animal vocalization density and diversity. Christina’s research identified seven species of bats, in addition to frogs, birds, and mammals, for a clearer picture of ecosystem health at the Arboretum that could inform future conservation initiatives.\n\nDustin Ray\n\n2022 Sinnott Award\n\nPostdoctoral Fellow, University of Minnesota, Duluth\n\nThe leaf stalk (petiole) connects the leaf blade (where photosynthesis occurs) to the rest of the plant body (where water is drawn up from the roots). Although this diminutive structure is incredibly important for plant survival—the sugars from photosynthesis must be transported across the petiole to reach the stem and water from the roots must move through the petiole to exit into the atmosphere from the leaves— the petiole is understudied. We know very little about its physiology and how it may assist or hinder the transport of water and sugar. With the Sinnott Award, Dustin is investigating two portions of the petiole: the base which connects to the plant stem, and the tip, which connects to the leaf blade using diverse trees in the Arboretum. These two portions are significant because researchers have documented divergences and convergences in the tissues that transport water (xylem) and sugar (phloem).\n\nHeather Gladfelter\n\n2022 Sinnott Award\n\nPostdoctoral Fellow, University of Georgia\n\nThe Franklin tree (Franklinia alatamaha) can no longer be grown in its native range due to extreme susceptibility to Phytophthora cinnamomic, an exotic plant pathogen that causes a devastating root rot disease and is now ubiquitous in soils across the American Southeast. Since no natural resistance to P. cinnamomi has been identified within the cultivated population of Franklina, conventional breeding will not resolve the problem. Heather Gladfelter and colleagues received a Sinnott Award for studies focused on identifying and introducing resistance to P. cinnamomi into the remaining cultivated germplasm of F. alatamaha. The Sinnott Award will aid their novel breeding approach that utilizes mutagenesis of in vitro shoots to produce new genetic variants of F. alatamaha resistant to the pathogen.\n\nIsrael Lopes da Cunha Neto\n\n2022 Sargent Award\n\nPostdoctoral Fellow, Cornell University\n\nIn climbing plants, instead of forming the typical ring of wood and bark, many stems display unusual organizations of vascular tissues which vary from cylindrical stems with heterogeneous distribution of wood and bark to asymmetrical stems. Why do vines have unusual stem architecture? Israel Cunha Neto and colleagues received a Sargent Award for Visiting Scholars to use the living collections to study the developmental anatomy and molecular genetics underlying successive cambia formation in three pairs of distantly related groups: wisterias and common bean in the legume family; Cocculus and Canadian moonseed in the moonseed family; and Gnetum and Ephedra in the gymnosperms. Each pair includes a species with successive cambia and a counterpart with regular anatomy. This research—the first of its kind—will shed light on how successive cambia form across vascular plants, which at the same time can illuminate how radial growth occurs in ecological and economic important commercial trees.\n\nCunha Neto IL^, Hall BT, Lanba AR, Blosenski JD, Onyenedum JG. 2023. Laser ablation tomography (LATscan) as a new tool for anatomical studies of woody plants. New Phytologist 239(1):429–44. Abstract\n\nLei Duan\n\n2022 Hu Student/Postdoctoral Award\n\nFaculty, South China Botanical Garden\n\nPapilionoideae is the largest subfamily in the pea family, comprising around 14,000 species. Members of this family—with the showy, butterfly-like flowers that give it its name—include common gardening trees in North America and East Asia, including our native yellowwood (Cladrastis kentukea) and Asia’s wing-fruited pagoda tree (Platyosprion platycarpum). Lei Duan received the Shui-Ying Hu Student/Postdoctoral Exchange Award to clarify whether the Chinese and Japanese lineages of P. platycarpum are truly the same species as sugggested by most taxonomists. Populational phylogenomic analyses will reveal how and when the genus Platyosprion dispersed from northeastern Asia to southern China and southern Japan. The phylogenomic analyses can also reflect, to some extent, environmental changes in eastern Asia since the Miocene (about 20 million years ago).\n\nLindsey Kollmer\n\n2022 Cunin/Sigal Award\n\nUndergraduate Student, University of Connecticut\n\nLindsey Kollmer studies how flower development affects phenology—the timing of annual events in the life of plants. Climate change is shifting the phenology of many species, a fact well documented at the Arboretum. The phenology of flowering plants is of particular interest to biologists because of its importance to ecology, since climate change may create phenological mismatches between plants and other species (like pollinators) that interact with them. With support from the Cunin-Sigal Research Award, Lindsey is examining dormant winter buds in several species of Magnolia and Cornus (Dogwood) trees at the Arboretum that flower at different times to understand how their development relates to phenology using light and scanning electron microscopy.\n\nWarren Chatwin\n\n2022 Jewett Prize\n\nResearch Scientist, USDA Agricultural Research Service\n\nThe Arboretum’s nationally accredited hickory collection was recently used to develop a genetic analysis pipeline capable of identifying the species and/or hybrid status of unknown hickory samples using low-coverage DNA sequencing. This pipeline includes hickories from the USDA germplasm repository and others sourced from other geographic areas like Texas. However, it needs to be tested on hickories from other geographic regions before it can be used to screen trees for inclusion in the USDA germplasm repository. With the support of the Jewett Prize, Warren Chatwin collected young leaf tissue from 216 wild-origin hickories and 4 hybrids at the Arnold Arboretum for DNA sequencing and testing of their genetic analysis pipeline.\n\nYujing Yan\n\n2022 Arnold Arboretum Genomics Initiative and Sequencing Award\n\nHUH Fellow, Harvard University\n\nPlants are experiencing exceptionally high rates of anthropogenic extinction. Vulnerable species are especially imperiled—in fact, some species may have already experienced pressure from dramatic climatic changes over millennia and may serve as a basis for exploring extinction dynamics. One of the most iconic plants to have gone extinct in the wild is the Franklin tree (Franklinia alatamaha), a species in the tea family which persists only in gardens today (assisted by ex situ conservation efforts at institutions including the Arnold Arboretum). Yet the main causes of its extinction are still debated, and a close relative (Gordonia lasianthus) with similar morphology and habitat remains common in the wild today. With the Genomics Initiative and Sequencing Award, Yujing is testing whether climate oscillations during the Pleistocene epoch were responsible for the extinction of F. alatamaha. Through genome sequencing of Arboretum accessions of F. alatamaha and G. lasianthus and historical herbarium specimens, Yujing will construct a spatially-explicit ecological model to examine the past and future of plant biodiversity and distribution patterns with a goal to better predict the future of biodiversity.\n\n2021 Awardees\n\nBruno Nevado\n\n2021 Sargent Award\n\nPrincipal Investigator, University of Lisbon, Portugal\n\nBruno focuses on the uneven distribution of biological diversity over space and time. At the Arboretum, he will focus on North and Central American members of the genus Lupinus present in the herbarium.

This reference will include thousands of images of leaves, flowers, cones and other parts of the plants. He will visit the Arboretum to take photographs of trees in the living collections.\n\nJonas Frei\n\n2021 Jewett Prize\n\nMaster’s Student, Zurich University of Applied Sciences, Switzerland\n\nJonas is focused on telling the botanical, cultural and natural history story of edible nuts. He has published a book in German on the walnut family, the Juglandaceae, and is currently working on the English translation. He is also working on a new book on the genus Corylus, the hazels. At the Arboretum, Jonas will closely examine, illustrate, and photograph these plants in the living collections and herbarium for his publications. Learn more.\n\nSusan McEvoy\n\n2021 Arnold Arboretum Genomics Initiative and Sequencing Award\n\nPhD Student, University of Connecticut\n\nAcer macrophyllum genome\n\nSusan will lead the effort to create a reference genome and epigenome for Acer macrophyllum (bigleaf maple). This project, together with the reference genomes, transcriptomes, and epigenomes developed using Arboretum accessions of A. saccharum, A. negundo, and A. griseum, will provide genomic resources that will benefit the entire scientific community and provide needed tools for the detailed analysis of the life and times of Acer at the genomic level.\n\nSuzanne Ou\n\n2021 Ashton Award\n\nPhD Candidate, Stanford University\n\nSuzanne is studying the role of mycorrhizal interactions in shaping aboveground forest diversity and belowground nutrient dynamics. Using a mix of fieldwork in the Dipterocarp forests of Southeast Asia, greenhouse experiments, and molecular sequencing techniques, she is interested in understanding how soil microbes influence both primary and disturbed forests. The Ashton Award will support her research in Singapore.\n\nVanessa Indeglia\n\n2021 Sinnott Award\n\nDVM Candidate and Master’s Student, Tufts University\n\nImportant members of the ecosystem, bats face many threats and challenges. Vanessa will set-up acoustic monitoring of bats at the Arnold Arboretum to help understand the role of urbanization on bat populations and species diversity, and to aid in conservation efforts. Vanessa will design community walks highlighting areas of bat activity in the Arboretum.\n\n2020 Awardees\n\nAdam Negrin\n\n2020 Jewett Prize\n\nAdjunct Assistant Professor, Lehman College (CUNY)\n\nAdam will investigate the phenology and localization of secondary metabolites in flowers, fruits, and vegetative tissues of Tilia species (Malvaceae), and members of the Theaceae and Aquifoliaceae.\n\nBailey Cowart\n\n2020 Sinnott Award\n\nUndergraduate Student, Boston University\n\nUsing multiple species of the Arboretum’s Acer collection, Bailey will examine and compare the water stress response and stomatal arrangement in both leaves and samara, the photosynthetically active fruits. Compared to leaves, samaras are a relatively neglected photosynthetic tissue and little is known about their contribution to photosynthesis and water responses.\n\nDiana Castillo Diaz\n\n2020 Ashton Award\n\nPhD Candidate, Guangxi University, China\n\nAs important members of tropical and subtropical ecosystems, Ficus species have specialized requirements that limit the establishment of new seedlings. Diana will examine the limiting factors for seedling recruitment using eight species of Ficus in a transitional tropical to subtropical forest environment across different microsites and host plants. The Ashton Award will support her research in China.\n\nEndro Setiawan\n\n2020 Ashton Award\n\nMaster’s Student, Universitas Nasional, Indonesia\n\nAs the local botanist and field assistant, Endro has collaborated for decades with scientists from the Arboretum and elsewhere.
