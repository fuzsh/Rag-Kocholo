        "text": "Co-Director\n\nProfessor Celia E. Naylor\n\nCelia E. Naylor, Professor of Africana Studies and History, joined the Barnard College faculty in 2010.\n\nMost of her published work explores the multifaceted connections between African-Americans, “Black Indians,” and Native Americans in the U.S. In her book African Cherokees in Indian Territory: From Chattel to Citizens, she explores the experiences of enslaved and free people of African descent in the Cherokee Nation in Indian Territory from the 1830s to 1907.\n\nProfessor Naylor's book entitled (Un)Silencing Slavery: Telling Truths about Rose Hall Plantation, Jamaica was published in 2022 by the University of Georgia Press (Gender and Slavery Series). She is also working on a digital humanities project on Rose Hall that will highlight the individual and collective lives of the enslaved people who lived and labored at Rose Hall Plantation. She hopes this overall project will also provide the foundation for integrating and interrogating more critical information about enslaved people and slavery in future tours and materials at the Rose Hall Great House in Jamaica.\n\nProfessor Naylor has served on a number of committees at Barnard College and Columbia University. She is on the Editorial Board of the Journal of African American History. Due to Professor Naylor's interest in, and commitment to, racial equity and social justice, over the past few years she has been working with the Institute for Strategic and Equitable Development (ISED). She has served as President of the Board of Directors of this non-profit organization since its establishment in 2015. ISED's purpose is to promote impactful grant-making, investments, and economic development in communities of color through strategic planning, evaluation, project management, and technical assistance services. ISED's 2 major initiatives are Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity in Environmental Philanthropy (InDEEP) and the Presidents' Forum on Racial Equity in Philanthropy.\n\nCo-Director\n\nProfessor Shayoni Mitra\n\nShayoni Mitra works at the intersection of performance and politics. She teaches courses on gender and performance theory, as well as postcolonial drama and non-Western forms of theatre. Her teaching stresses transnational connections, and bridges the gap between the global North and South, putting into dialogue the histories of Western Realism with classical, folk, stylized, avant garde and improvised forms from around the world. As part of one of her courses, she maintains the collaborative digital humanities project Performing Women, with contributions from successive semesters of students.\n\nProf. Mitra actively embraces the scholar-practitioner-activist role encouraging the covalence of pedagogy and praxis. Her interest in political theatre stems from her years as an actor with Delhi-based street theatre group Jana Natya Manch. She has contributed essays to critical volumes such as Gender, Space, Resistance edited by Anita Singh, and Mapping South Asia Through Contemporary Theatre edited by Ashish Sengupta.\n\nHer research appears in peer reviewed journals such as TDR, Asian Theatre Journal, Contemporary Theatre Journal, CSSAAME and others. Prof. Mitra's opinion editorials and writings on protest culture and student activism appear in The India Express, Columbia Spectator, and Inverse Journal. She is a recurring co-host with On TAP: A Theatre and Performance Studies Podcast. Before coming to Barnard, she taught at Brown and New York University in the United States and conducted lectures and theatre workshops in Jawaharlal Nehru University, Jamia Milia University and Delhi University in India.\n\nScholars\n\nValeria Alanis '26\n\nI was planted in a Mexican border city called Reynosa, Tamaulipas, right across the South Texas Border. Having a basket of opportunities lying just next door, my mother decided to embark on an adventure that hasn’t quite yet ended. Every morning, while the sun remained peacefully dormant, I found myself half-asleep, traveling from one country to another and back for school. Although I was fairly young and full of collagen, I rapidly recognized the differences rooted between my two homes. I always remained thankful for this.\n\nIt was through the hardships that I harvested resilience and a prevailing frame of mind. In High School, I was President of Student Council, Ambassador of my school district, participant of NHS and SHS, and multiple time BPA state qualifier. Throughout this period of growth, I cultivated a myriad of fascinations. I discovered my fondness of expression through dancing, my love for undressing the mind through writing, and my admiration of genuineness through people. There is no denying that I still have a lot to learn; Through the Barbara Silver Horowitz '55 Scholars of Distinction Program, I am confident that I will harvest my ideas so that one day, I can tell that little girl that observed the world through a window that she made it. My journey has just begun.\n\nShanthi Ashok '27\n\nLiving in northern Virginia, an exponentially diverse community, for my entire life has instilled in me a deep appreciation for inclusivity and racial justice. I was labeled a “gifted and talented” student at a young age, quickly exposing me to how today’s education system creates unnecessary barriers to academic achievement for many communities of color. Throughout high school, I worked to bridge these gaps by instituting free tutoring and mentoring services and working with my local school board to implement more inclusive policies such as the institution of staff equity leads in every high school in my county.\n\nThus, at Barnard, I hope to explore this passion by double majoring in Economics - Political Economy and Computer Science, with a possible minor in Education. I am a strong believer that socioeconomic status should never affect one’s ability to achieve their potential, which is why I am so excited to be a part of the Barnard community that shares these values.\n\nIn my freetime, I love to coach and play volleyball (coaching for the last 2 years and playing for over 10 years!) and am very excited to explore and engage with political groups at Barnard/Columbia.\n\nRuby Carter '27\n\nHi, I’m Ruby (or Ruben) and I was born and raised in San Jose, CA. I enjoy creative writing, reading nonfiction, sewing, and playing flute and trombone.\n\nI grew up in a household that prioritized education and social justice–my mother is a middle school teacher and my father works at a nonprofit that serves the community. These values showed up often in the projects I pursued in high school: most of my junior and senior years were spent creating a documentary title Made Invisible: Uncovering Queer America. For the film, I got to retell the stories of unsung queer heroes, interview queer students at my school, screen the documentary in my city, and teach a 2-day lesson to middle school students on LGBTQ+ history. I have a deep interest in queer studies and Africana studies, and hope to learn more about the intersection of the two fields at Barnard.\n\nI’m incredibly excited to be a Scholar of Distinction and a first-year at Barnard. I plan on majoring in Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. At the college, I hope to explore my place in the world as a queer Black student and draw parallels between advocacy and events of the past to the contemporary.\n\nShaya Godycki '25\n\nI grew up in Santa Clarita, California-- a small, very conservative Republican town. Growing up in a space dominated by white supremacy and conservative values forced me to be hyper-aware of my positionality as a young, black feminine-presenting individual in the United States and as a global citizen. My lived experiences prompted my curiosity about studying intersections of oppression and how we can dismantle these systems. Exploring this curiosity allowed me to find Barnard’s CCIS department, a department that I plan to study under during my four years here.\n\nI plan to double major in both Comparative Literature and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, along with minoring in ICORE/MORE. I want to use the knowledge that I gain to further my goals of analyzing various axes of oppression, how they intersect, and, especially, how these axes are extended through social exchange and media. Through the courses provided and extracurriculars available, I hope to grow as an artist, an activist, and an author. Outside of academics, I love to watch anime and read fantasy novels along with sketching out characters for my original works.\n\nBrynn Green '27\n\nHello! I'm Brynn, and I am from sunny Los Angeles, California. I plan to major in political science and Africana studies, focusing on pre-law, to become a civil rights lawyer. In high school, I was involved in cultural organizations and student leadership, having been president of my school's Black Student Union and vice president of our student government. These opportunities led me to understand my passion for civic engagement and civil rights. Working with my peers and administrators helped me find the value of collaboration and new perspectives. At Barnard, I hope to continue my involvement in cultural groups and join Black student organizations for more ethnic learning and cohesion!\n\nMy experience as a Black American, research, and reading have also brought me to a passion for criminal justice and prison reform. The George Floyd protests inspired me to learn more about our country's history of inequality, and that rabbit hole led me to develop a passion for criminal justice. Through Scholars of Distinction, I hope to research the inequities in our criminal justice system and find solutions to some of the problems facing policing, the penal system, and society today.\n\nJem Hanan '27\n\nI was born and raised in Manhattan, New York, in a Jewish Modern Orthodox family. People watching from my apartment window was probably the first indicator of my fascination with the lives of humans. Since then, most of my academic interests have been focused on the larger goal of understanding people. I love telling character driven narratives through my writing, studying history through a cause and effect lens, and reading the Bible stories I learned from birth as a literary study of the human condition.\n\nMy first philosophy class in high school also exposed me to a vast well of questions surrounding the nature of humanity, their politics, and their psyches. In-depth readings of philosophical works with professors, book clubs with friends, and countless hours of YouTube essays, ranging from film to marxist feminism, followed closely after. All of the areas I engage with continue to deepen my appreciation of people, their creations, and the reasons they create.\n\nThrough the Scholars of Distinction program, I will pursue an interdisciplinary project that utilizes every facet and angle the humanities offer. Additionally, talking to the passionate people at Barnard will push me in new directions, both academically and personally; I am ecstatic to see where they take me.\n\nNina Haskins '26\n\nAs a biracial woman growing up in the diverse metropolis of New York City, I’ve always been fascinated by the coexistence and sharing of cultures. I want to promote (both in my life and in others’) ways in which we can diversify our own perspectives through the listening and appreciation of experiences that differ from our own. This has fueled my interest in anthropology, international relations, linguistics, and environmental studies, but has also left me with endless possibilities of exploration. No matter what way my studies of human ecology and society manifests, I aim to return to those values.\n\nIn the meantime, I love to hone in on both collaborative and independent passions, like ceramics, soccer, violin, and language learning. I’m so honored to be a part of the Scholars Program, and cannot wait to be connected with storytellers around the globe who share similar values. I’m so eager to explore existing and future curiosities, and am ready to hit the ground running!\n\nShreya Kumar '24\n\nI was born in Racine, Wisconsin, but I was raised primarily in New Jersey. I’m a middle child, sandwiched between a 14-year-old sister and a 20-year-old brother. I go from playing Nerf guns with my sister to talking about the history of the English throne with my brother in the span of an hour.\n\nGrowing up with two distinct siblings has allowed me to develop a capacity to engage with people with diverse and varied interests. When asked what my favorite color is, I can never pick because I like them all. I love lounging on the beach, but I would never say no to hiking in the mountains.\n\nPerforming musicals has given me chills; balancing the intense adrenaline rush, your friends and family cheering, and remembering lines and notes is a unique–and addictive–feeling that I can’t dream of giving up.\n\nI'm passionate about politics and served Editor-in-Chief of The First Amendment, my high school's political opinions magazine; however, I also appreciate the weekly-deadlines and late night feeds that come with editorship at The Lawrence, my school's daily newspaper. Honors Biology has been one of the more interesting classes I’ve taken in school; I find the correlation between structure and function in organisms and how they evolve to be beautiful, and I admire how simple evolutionary rules lead to complex life forms. In an age when specializing is the norm, I will bring different interests together with classic middle child patience and humor and cultivate them with the Barnard community.\n\nAlexandria Landry '26\n\nI was born and raised in Belmont, Massachusetts, right outside of Boston. I am a proud daughter of a Mexican immigrant, and many of my passions stem from this aspect of my identity. During high school, I used my Spanish language skills to help researchers at Boston College School of Social work better understand how Latinx immigrants navigate healthcare systems in greater Boston. My work as an assistant in this research opened my eyes to many of the shortcomings of systems – like the healthcare system– that are meant to work for everyone.\n\nI began making changes in my own life because of this research, starting a program for culturally-competent translators at the local food pantry and also serving as a Spanish tutor. I hope to continue my advocacy work throughout college and beyond, particularly with a focus on economics. As I grow in my understanding of the economy and how it often affects our world in imperceptible ways, I aspire to better understand how advocates can use their economic and financial knowledge to truly make an impact in communities that are often left voiceless. In my free time, I have loved getting to know NYC, especially exploring the restaurant scene. I also love watching light-hearted movies, baking, and going on long walks.\n\nAtswei Laryea '25\n\nHiya! My name is Naa Atswei (or just Atswei) Laryea, and I’m a West-African Washingtonian majoring in Africana Studies here at Barnard College. With the Scholars of Distinction program, I hope to explore the relationship between the math classroom, race, class, gender, and other socio- political constructs. Additionally, I’m interested in music(ology), fashion, and design, and perhaps will find a way to string all of these topics together during my time as a Scholar of Distinction.\n\nThough I primarily grew up in D.C., I've spent a lot of time in London (where a large chunk of my family grew up and reside) and consider myself an honorary Black Brit on top of my Ghanaian and Nigerian identity. For my junior year of high school, I went abroad and studied in Rennes, France, and would love to broaden my cultural inventory by studying abroad on the African continent during my time at Barnard. On-campus, I have plans to join Barnard B.O.S.S., Columbia University African Students Association, Hoot Mag, and maybe try my hand at DJing for WBAR. Outside of academics, you can find me chatting with friends and family, going on walks, planning family vacations, or listening to Amapiano on too high of a volume.\n\nSophia Lopez '26\n\nI was born and raised in Chicago, the same hometown as my parents. But when the opportunity for change presented itself, I took it! The summer before my freshman year of high school, we moved to Los Angeles, California. Being here in New York now, I will have lived in the three best cities in the United States, in my opinion of course. I am incredibly excited to be here in New York as a Barnard student and Scholar of Distinction. I am currently interested in pursuing theology and neuroscience.\n\nMy interest in theology grew from a summer research program I participated in during high school where I studied the digital age of American Sufism. My interest in neuroscience grew from my mother's vertigo diagnosis, as I’ve spent many years observing its effects on her. I look forward to exploring how these topics can overlap in a broader sense. I am newly a member of the crocheting club and the culinary society at Columbia. So, I am looking forward to keeping up with my favorite hobbies from home throughout the school year. Similarly, in my free time I babysit, read, try out new coffee shops and admire every dog I see!\n\nJohanna Mintz '24\n\n\"I’m a New Yorker, born and bred (fuggedaboutit!). Having spent my formative years in a city with such diverse representations of identity, cultural experience, and ways of life, my interests are far-flung and varied, ranging from Gulag art to Bollywood movies, to true crime podcasts, to Klezmer music, to Ancient curse tablets.\n\nFinding an academic discipline that could combine my seemingly modern and disparate passions for art, history, language, philosophy, and literature appeared to be a daunting task. However, after taking Latin and Ancient Greek in high school and reading ancient texts ranging in topic from atomic theory to gynecology, I found that Classics was the perfect encapsulation of all my interests and a means of accessing a broad range of cultural material that is surprisingly applicable to our modern world. However, as I began to actively pursue Classics, my experiences in courses and summer programs were punctuated by misogyny and the false classification of Classics as a “white, western history.” These encounters recentered my focus and sparked a sense of urgency; my particular interest is now in gender and sexuality in the ancient world in tandem with modern receptions of antiquity and its appropriation by the Nazis, the alt-right, and men’s rights movements.\n\nI hope, at Barnard and with the support of the Scholars program, to become an active contributor to the razing and restructuring of Classics as a discipline and the creation of a more inclusive and accurate depiction of the ancient world. Outside of class, I love to paint, play guitar, watch The Sopranos, re-read Madeline Miller’s Circe, and make matzo ball soup with my sister.\"\n\nAngelina Nicolosi '25\n\nI was born and raised in Fayetteville, North Carolina as the oldest daughter of a single mother. While I attended a relatively wealthy high school in a small, country town, I navigated through my education as one of few low-income students in many of my classes. From as early as kindergarten, socioeconomic status and income inequality have been two of the most prevalent factors impacting my worldview. For most of my life I thought I would make something of myself through the medical field, but after several formative political experiences in my sophomore year of high school, I found my passion in law and government. I realized my own success would be meaningless if I wasn’t able to help as many people as possible along the way, and fighting against injustices towards the people most harmed by our political system is how I intend to do it.\n\nAt Barnard, I hope to double major in political science and social and economic history. When I’m not reading up on those subjects, I enjoy watching Glee, perfecting my iced coffee order, and writing tweets that I hope people will laugh at.\n\nMimia Ousilas '27\n\n\"While I lived in Berkeley, California for my whole life before coming to Barnard, my heart and identity belongs across the world — as cheesy as it sounds. My mom was born in Taiwan, my dad was born in Algeria, and from a young age I grew up visiting family in both countries roughly every year. While this cultural combination inevitably led to many mixed kid internal crises, it also gave me a global perspective like no other. I hope to use my personal experience both struggling with and embracing my cultural identity as a unique lens on tackling issues in the classroom and in the city.\n\nI plan to major in Economic and Social history with a minor in Africana studies, as I find the intersection of race and larger systemic issues not only fascinating, but crucial to understand when it comes to tackling essentially any systemic issue in the US. Additionally, I’m excited to explore the creative side of everything, from dance, to art, to spoken word, and I’m ready to use art to power change as well. I love dancing, reading, listening to music, frequent late-night ramen and boba hangouts, and look forward to connecting with anyone who can relate!\"\n\nFahitza Quessa '26\n\nHello my name Fahitza Quessa, I am a Haitian-born native and a natural extrovert. As a first-year Barnard student, I am currently a computer science and political science major interested in software engineering and law. I became interested in law when I joined advocacy programs in Boston.\n\nAs someone from an underprivileged background, my ambition stems from wanting to help other disadvantaged people overcome the barriers they are surrounded by. Thereby, I hope to obtain a law degree to give a voice to the voiceless. Whilst I work towards a law degree, I want to get a B.S. in computer science because I enjoy the logic-based thinking that is very pertinent to coding. I hope to inspire other incoming young gifted black women at Barnard as a scholar of Distinction.\n\nMariah Iris Ramo '27\n\nNaimbag nga aldaw yo (Good day)! I am Mariah Iris Ramo, a proud freshman and a Scholar of Distinction at Barnard College. I was born in the Philippines and immigrated to Hawai'i when I was four years old. Despite growing up in predominantly Filipino communities, my peers bullied me due to my thick accent and my family's socioeconomic status. Hence, I disconnected from my roots to try to “fit into” society. Luckily, I found myself again thanks to the extraordinary experiences and the people in my life.\n\nI joined the Filipino Curriculum Project and taught at my alma mater to provide representation for students of color. I also founded the Girl Up Club, collaborated with local organizations, and currently hold the Miss Teen Asia Hawaii title to support women in reaching their fullest potential. One day, I hope to become a U.S. Senator and lifelong educator. But for now, I firmly believe that my time in college and the program can (1) remind me that it is okay to \"stand out\" in the crowd and (2) help me continue using my past experiences while tuning in to the voices of the people to work collectively towards a bright future.\n\nAlice Rodi '25\n\nI’ve been fascinated by words and writing ever since I can remember: growing up in a tiny, idyllic town in New Hampshire called Lyme, I spent much of my free time reading, crafting poetry, or inventing my own languages. Once I got to high school, I joined my school’s newspaper and fell head over heels, eventually taking on editorship my junior and senior years. I became infatuated with journalistic writing, and, although it scared me, I was thrilled to share my work with the public—doing so allowed me to build connections and foster relationships I never thought possible.\n\nWithin the Scholars of Distinction program, I hope to examine language through not only a journalistic and storytelling lens, but a scientific one, as well. In short, I aim to study how language affects communities and the people within them. In addition, I want to delve further into my curiosities regarding language acquisition, cognition, and phonetics through psycholinguistics and linguistic anthropology, as well as (potentially) cognitive neuroscience.\n\nArianna Suarez '26\n\nMy name is Arianna Suarez, and I am a first year at Barnard College. I was born and raised in Westchester County, New York. I am a proud Scholar of Distinction and am eager to continue exemplifying my hard work, responsibility, and commitment to my education by challenging myself throughout my college experience. A hobby of mine is dancing especially Spanish music such as Bachata and Merengue because I find it to be a fun way to feel immersed in my Dominican culture.\n\nI am the Dance Coordinator of the Grupo Folclórico Dominicano and through my role, I help spread the culture of the Dominican Republic through church and community events. I do this by leading practice groups and assisting with event coordination and the creation of dance routines. At college, I am taking Salsa classes at Casa Hispanica and am a part of the Latinx community to continue learning and feeling connected to my culture.\n\nAs a first year, I hope to explore a variety of different classes and topics to gain a better understanding of possible career interests. This year I look forward to being open-minded and going out of my comfort zone to try new things and meet new people. I am currently a prospective educational studies major and urban teaching minor, but I am open-minded and exploring several different areas of study.\n\nAnjali Smith '25\n\nI was born and raised in NJ, and am lucky to be a part of a big multiethnic family. I love to paint, go on long walks, make Pinterest boards, and I have a strange obsession with flipping through companies’ brand books (Glossier’s is my favorite).\n\nAs a descendant of Indo-Fijian Girmitiyas, indentured laborers under British colonialism, I am aware of the lasting impact a single policy can have on generations of people. Traditionally, the people in positions of power to create policies rarely feel the impact of their policies. This observation served as the foundation for my academic interests throughout high school as I researched and drafted legislation with my school’s model congress team, and analyzed data about systemic racism and racial attitudes in politics as a research assistant for Princeton University Professor LaFleur Stephens-Dougan.\n\nI am beyond grateful to attend Barnard College and for the opportunity to pursue my research interests as a Scholar of Distinction. I hope to bring more Indo-Fijian oral histories into academic research and knowledge on indentured labor in Fiji because my ancestors, especially the women, deserve better than colonial documents and narratives that exclude their lived experiences.\n\nMia Wolff '27\n\nI was born and raised in Miami, Florida, though I moved around a bit in the city. My mother passed away from ovarian cancer in 2012, though I grew up with two much older siblings who have always remained my best companions. I eventually went to high school in central Florida - a big change from city to rural life.\n\nHowever, I learned there what I was most passionate about. I developed a fervor for environmental protection - more specifically, sea-level rise affecting agricultural communities. Among other awards, I earned a letter of recognition from the US Environmental Protection Agency for taking this concept to the regional and state science fairs.\n\nSimultaneously, I grew my interest in social change. I worked with different non-profits promoting cancer awareness, became interested in studying court cases, and conducted research on queer censorship in high school. I also fostered my lifetime love of reading and English.\n\nOutside of academics, you could find me watching “When Harry Met Sally…” again, playing video games, re-reading Taylor Jenkins Reid’s “The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo”, or swimming laps in the local pool!\n\nAll these interests give me a duality in my set of skills that I believe will allow me to greatly contribute to the wonderful Barnard community in my coming years.\n\nLauren Zhou '24\n\nDespite being born in the US, I grew up predominantly in Manila, Philippines. I spent ten years at the International School of Manila, where I received an International Baccalaureate diploma and cultivated my passions for journalism, photography, and history. While living in Manila, I observed Filipino democratic values erode. Notably, in July of 2020, right before I went off to college, I witnessed the anti-terrorism act pass into law in the Philippines — through a broad definition of terrorism, it allowed for the warrantless arrest of individuals with the purpose of deterring government criticism. Although I will forever call the Philippines home, it is undeniably a fragile democracy, prone to abuse. Thus, upon coming to Barnard, my upbringing made me cognizant of the larger US polity, and my place — as a first-generation Asian American — within it.\n\nAt Barnard, I am double majoring in Political Science and History on a pre-law track. Under the Scholars of Distinction Program, I have been given the opportunity and resources to explore my Asian American heritage, despite growing up abroad. Last year, I began researching legislation and immigration policy which influenced the emergence of Flushing, Queens as an Asian American enclave and its progression into a commercial district. Furthermore, I have been able to streamline my passion for photography and visual storytelling by supplementing my research with digital and analog photographs of Flushing and its residents."
