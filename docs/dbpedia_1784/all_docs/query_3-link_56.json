        "text": "For over a century, the American Academy in Rome has awarded the Rome Prize to support innovative and cross-disciplinary work in the arts and humanities. Each year, the Rome Prize is awarded to about thirty artists and scholars who represent the highest standard of excellence.\n\nFellowships are chosen from the following disciplines:\n\nAncient studies\n\nArchitecture\n\nDesign: includes graphic, industrial, interior, exhibition, set, costume, and fashion design, urban design, city planning, engineering, and other design fields\n\nHistoric preservation and conservation\n\nLandscape architecture: includes environmental design and planning, landscape/ecological urbanism, landscape history, sustainability and ecological studies, and geography\n\nLiterature: includes fiction, literary nonfiction, and poetry\n\nMedieval studies\n\nModern Italian studies\n\nMusical composition\n\nRenaissance and early modern studies\n\nVisual arts: includes painting, sculpture, drawing, photography, film and video, installation, new media, digital arts, and other visual-arts fields\n\nAdditionally, AAR is pleased to offer the Tsao Family Rome Prize, to be awarded to a humanities scholar whose project explores the relationship between Chinese and Mediterranean philosophical traditions. Please see the humanities guidelines for more information.\n\nThe deadline for the nationwide Rome Prize competition will be November 1, 2024. Applications will also be accepted between November 2 and 15 for an additional fee. No applications are accepted after November 15.\n\nFull-term fellowships generally run from early September through the following June. Winners of half-term fellowships may indicate a preference to begin in September or February.\n\nEach Rome Prize winner is provided with a stipend, meals, a bedroom with private bath, and a private workspace. Those with children under eighteen live in partially subsidized apartments nearby. Winners of half- and full-term fellowships receive stipends of $16,000 and $30,000, respectively.\n\nRome Prize winners are the core of the Academy’s residential community, which also includes Residents, Affiliated Fellows, and Visiting Artists and Scholars. Life at the Academy is most fully realized through the participation of all community members, in conversation with each other and deeply engaged with Rome’s historical and modern identity.\n\nApplicants for all Rome Prize Fellowships, except those applying for the National Endowment for the Humanities postdoctoral fellowships, must be United States citizens at the time of their application.\n\nUS citizens, and foreign nationals who have lived in the United States for three years immediately preceding the application deadline, may apply for the NEH postdoctoral fellowships in ancient studies, medieval studies, Renaissance and early modern studies, and modern Italian studies.\n\nGraduate students in the humanities may apply for predoctoral fellowships only if they are all but dissertation (ABD).\n\nPrevious winners of the Rome Prize are not eligible to reapply.\n\nUndergraduate students are not eligible for Rome Prize Fellowships.\n\nCollaborators may submit joint applications provided their work is genuinely collaborative, as demonstrated by the materials submitted. In the case of joint applications, each individual must meet all eligibility requirements. Joint applications must be submitted in one dossier with one of the collaborators serving as the primary applicant. Joint applicants selected as winners will each receive the full Rome Prize offering (i.e., individual room and board, a full stipend, and private work space).\n\nWinners of the Rome Prize may hold other fellowships concurrently, as long as the requirements do not conflict with the winner’s full participation in the Academy community. Applicants are required to disclose all fellowships and awards they expect to hold during their proposed residency in Rome, including sabbatical pay.\n\nRome Prize winners may not hold a full-time job during the fellowship term. Winners may undertake part-time work commitments—including scholarly or artistic work that is not related to their Rome Prize project—provided that this work does not interfere with the winner’s full participation in the Academy community.\n\nTen juries, representing a broad cross-section of leaders in the various Rome Prize disciplines are appointed annually to judge the candidate pool. The juries convene in January and February to select finalists for each category. Those applicants selected as finalists will be invited to interview with the jurors, in person at our New York office, in February or March. The winners are approved by the Academy’s Board of Trustees and announced in April.\n\nThe jurors’ primary criterion is excellence. They will consider the quality of an applicant’s submission and select candidates who are not only outstanding in their respective fields, but also at a point in their careers where the Rome Prize is likely to be crucial to their future growth and development.\n\nRead lists of Rome Prize jurors from the past three years."
