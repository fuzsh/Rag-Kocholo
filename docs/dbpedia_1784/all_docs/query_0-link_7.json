Miller]\n\nby Eugene F. Miller\n\nForeword\n\nDAVID HUME’S greatness was recognized in his own time, as it is today, but the writings that made Hume famous are not, by and large, the same ones that support his reputation now. Leaving aside his\n\nEnquiries, which were widely read then as now, Hume is known today chiefly through his\n\nTreatise of Human Nature and his\n\nDialogues Concerning Natural Religion. The\n\nTreatise was scarcely read at all during Hume’s lifetime, however, and the\n\nDialogues was not published until after his death. Conversely, most readers today pay little attention to Hume’s various books of essays and to his\n\nHistory of England, but these are the works that were read avidly by his contemporaries. If one is to get a balanced view of Hume’s thought, it is necessary to study both groups of writings. If we should neglect the essays or the\n\nHistory, then our view of Hume’s aims and achievements is likely to be as incomplete as that of his contemporaries who failed to read the\n\nTreatise or the\n\nDialogues.\n\nThe preparation and revision of his essays occupied Hume throughout his adult life. In his late twenties, after completing three books of the\n\nTreatise, Hume began to publish essays on moral and political themes. His\n\nEssays, Moral and Political was brought out late in 1741 by Alexander Kincaid, Edinburgh’s leading publisher.\n\nA second volume of essays appeared under the same title early in 1742,\n\nand later that year, a “Second Edition, Corrected” of the first volume was issued. In 1748, three additional essays appeared in a small volume published in Edinburgh and London.\n\nThat volume is noteworthy as the first of Hume’s works to bear his name and also as the beginning of his association with Andrew Millar as his chief London publisher. These three essays were incorporated into the “Third Edition, Corrected” of\n\nEssays, Moral and Political, which Millar and Kincaid published in the same year. In 1752, Hume issued a large number of new essays under the title\n\nPolitical Discourses, a work so successful that a second edition was published before the year was out, and a third in 1754.\n\nEarly in the 1750s, Hume drew together his various essays, along with other of his writings, in a collection entitled\n\nEssays and Treatises on Several Subjects. Volume 1 (1753) of this collection contains the\n\nEssays, Moral and Political and Volume 4 (1753-54) contains the\n\nPolitical Discourses. The two\n\nEnquiries are reprinted in Volumes 2 and 3. Hume retained the title\n\nEssays and Treatises on Several Subjects for subsequent editions of his collected works, but he varied the format and contents somewhat. A new, one-volume edition appeared under this title in 1758, and other four-volume editions in 1760 and 1770. Two-volume editions appeared in 1764, 1767, 1768, 1772, and 1777. The 1758 edition, for the first time, grouped the essays under the heading “Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary” and divided them into Parts I and II. Several new essays, as well as other writings, were added to this collection along the way.\n\nAs we see, the essays were by no means of casual interest to Hume. He worked on them continually from about 1740 until his death, in 1776. There are thirty-nine essays in the posthumous, 1777, edition of\n\nEssays, Moral, Political, and Literary (Volume 1 of\n\nEssays and Treatises on Several Subjects). Nineteen of these date back to the two original volumes of\n\nEssays, Moral and Political (1741-42). By 1777, these essays from the original volumes would have gone through eleven editions. Twenty essays were added along the way, eight were deleted, and two would await posthumous publication. Hume’s practice throughout his life was to supervise carefully the publication of his writings and to correct them for new editions. Though gravely ill in 1776, Hume made arrangements for the posthumous publication of his manuscripts, including the suppressed essays “Of Suicide” and “Of the Immortality of the Soul,” and he prepared for his publisher, William Strahan, the corrections for new editions of both his\n\nHistory of England and his\n\nEssays and Treatises on Several Subjects. When Adam Smith visited Hume on August 8, 1776, a little more than two weeks before the philosopher’s death on August 25, he found Hume still at work on corrections to the\n\nEssays and Treatises. Hume had earlier been reading Lucian’s\n\nDialogues of the Dead, and he speculated in jocular fashion with Smith on excuses that he might give to Charon for not entering his boat. One possibility was to say to him: “Good Charon, I have been correcting my works for a new edition. Allow me a little time, that I may see how the Public receives the alterations.”\n\nHume’s essays were received warmly in Britain, on the Continent, where numerous translations into French, German, and Italian appeared, and in America. In his brief autobiography,\n\nMy own Life, Hume speaks of his great satisfaction with the public’s reception of the essays. The favorable response to the first volume of\n\nEssays, Moral and Political made him forget entirely his earlier disappointment over the public’s indifference to his\n\nTreatise of Human Nature, and he was pleased that\n\nPolitical Discourses was received well from the outset both at home and abroad. When Hume accompanied the Earl of Hertford to Paris in 1763 for a stay of twenty-six months as Secretary of the British Embassy and finally as Chargé d’Affaires, he discovered that his fame there surpassed anything he might have expected. He was loaded with civilities “from men and women of all ranks and stations.” Fame was not the only benefit that Hume enjoyed from his publications. By the 1760s, “the copy-money given me by the booksellers, much exceeded any thing formerly known in England; I was become not only independent, but opulent.”\n\nHume’s essays continued to be read widely for more than a century after his death. Jessop lists sixteen editions or reprintings of\n\nEssays and Treatises on Several Subjects that appeared between 1777 and 1894.\n\n(More than fifty editions or reprintings of the\n\nHistory are listed for the same period.) The\n\nEssays, Moral, Political, and Literary were included as Volume 3 of\n\nThe Philosophical Works of David Hume (Edinburgh, 1825; reprinted in 1826 and 1854) and again as Volume 3 of a later edition by T. H. Green and T. H. Grose, also entitled\n\nThe Philosophical Works of David Hume (London: Longmans, Green and Co., 1874-75; vol. 3, reprinted in 1882, 1889, 1898, 1907, and 1912). Some separate editions of the\n\nEssays, Moral, Political, and Literary were published as well, including the one by “The World’s Classics” (London, 1903; reprinted in 1904).\n\nThese bibliographical details are important because they show how highly the essays were regarded by Hume himself and by many others up to the present century. Over the past seventy years, however, the essays have been overshadowed, just as the\n\nHistory has been, by other of Hume’s writings. Although some recent studies have drawn attention once again to the importance of Hume’s\n\nEssays, Moral, Political, and Literary, the work itself has long been difficult to locate in a convenient edition. Some of the essays have been included in various collections,\n\nbut, leaving aside the present edition, no complete edition of the\n\nEssays has appeared since the early part of the century, save for a reprinting of the 1903 World’s Classics edition\n\nand expensive reproductions of Green and Grose’s four-volume set of the\n\nPhilosophical Works. In publishing this new edition of the\n\nEssays—along with its publication, in six volumes, of the\n\nHistory of England —Liberty Fund has made a neglected side of Hume’s thought accessible once again to the modern reader.\n\nMany years after Hume’s death, his close friend John Home wrote a sketch of Hume’s character, in the course of which he observed: “His Essays are at once popular and philosophical, and contain a rare and happy union of profound Science and fine writing.”\n\nThis observation indicates why Hume’s essays were held in such high esteem by his contemporaries and why they continue to deserve our attention today. The essays are elegant and entertaining in style, but thoroughly philosophical in temper and content. They elaborate those sciences—morals, politics, and criticism—for which the\n\nTreatise of Human Nature lays a foundation. It was not simply a desire for fame that led Hume to abandon the\n\nTreatise and seek a wider audience for his thought. He acted in the belief that commerce between men of letters and men of the world worked to the benefit of both. Hume thought that philosophy itself was a great loser when it remained shut up in colleges and cells and secluded from the world and good company. Hume’s essays do not mark an abandonment of philosophy, as some have maintained,\n\nbut rather an attempt to improve it by having it address the concerns of common life.\n\nEugene F. Miller\n\n1 October 1984\n\nEugene F. Miller is Professor of Political Science at the University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia\n\nAn Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding appeared for the first time under this title in the 1758 edition of\n\nEssays and Treatises on Several Subjects. Earlier it had been published several times, beginning in 1748, under the title\n\nPhilosophical Essays Concerning Human Understanding. An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals was first published in 1751. I have drawn this and other information about the various editions of Hume’s writings from two sources: T. E. Jessop,\n\nA Bibliography of David Hume and of Scottish Philosophy (New York: Russell and Russell, 1966), and William B. Todd, “David Hume. A Preliminary Bibliography,” in Todd, ed.,\n\nHume and the Enlightenment (Edinburgh and Austin: Edinburgh University Press and the Humanities Research Center, Austin, Texas, 1974), pp. 189-205.\n\nBooks I and II of the\n\nTreatise were published in 1739; Book III, in 1740.\n\nHume wrote the\n\nDialogues about 1750 but decided to withhold publication during his lifetime. When Adam Smith proved unwilling to take responsibility for the posthumous publication of the\n\nDialogues, Hume entrusted it to his own publisher, William Strahan, with the provision that the work would be committed to Hume’s nephew David if Strahan failed to publish it within two and one-half years of Hume’s death. When Strahan declined to act, the nephew made arrangements for the publication of the\n\nDialogues in 1779.\n\nHume’s\n\nHistory was published between 1754 and 1762 in six volumes, beginning with the Stuart reigns, then working back to the Tudor and pre-Tudor epochs. A “New Edition, Corrected,” with the six volumes arranged in chronological order, appeared in 1762 under the title\n\nThe History of England, From the Invasion of Julius Caesar to The Revolution in 1688.\n\nThis edition contained the following essays: (1) “Of the Delicacy of Taste and Passion”; (2) “Of the Liberty of the Press”; (3) “Of Impudence and Modesty”; (4) “That Politicks may be reduc’d to a Science”; (5) “Of the First Principles of Government”; (6) “Of Love and Marriage”; (7) “Of the Study of History”; (8) “Of the Independency of Parliament”; (9) “Whether the British Government inclines more to Absolute Monarchy, or to a Republick”; (10) “Of Parties in General”; (11) “Of the Parties of Great Britain”; (12) “Of Superstition and Enthusiasm”; (13) “Of Avarice”; (14) “Of the Dignity of Human Nature”; and (15) “Of Liberty and Despotism.” Essays 3, 6, and 7 were not reprinted by Hume after 1760, and essay 13 was not reprinted after 1768. The title of essay 14 was changed to “Of the Dignity or Meanness of Human Nature” in the 1770 edition of\n\nEssays and Treatises on Several Subjects. The title of essay 15 was changed to “Of Civil Liberty” in the 1758 edition of\n\nEssays and Treatises.\n\nThis edition contained the following essays: (1) “Of Essay-Writing”; (2) “Of Eloquence”; (3) “Of Moral Prejudices”; (4) “Of the Middle Station of Life”; (5) “Of the Rise and Progress of the Arts and Sciences”; (6) “The Epicurean”; (7) “The Stoic”; (8) “The Platonist”; (9) “The Sceptic”; (10) “Of Polygamy and Divorces”; (11) “Of Simplicity and Refinement”; and (12) “A Character of Sir Robert Walpole.” Essays 1, 3, and 4 were published by Hume in this edition only. Essay 12 was printed as a footnote to “That Politics may be reduced to a Science” in editions from 1748 to 1768 and dropped after 1768.\n\nThis edition, entitled\n\nThree Essays, Moral and Political, contained: (1) “Of National Characters”; (2) “Of the Original Contract”; and (3) “Of Passive Obedience.”\n\nThis edition contained the following essays: (1) “Of Commerce”; (2) “Of Luxury”; (3) “Of Money”; (4) “Of Interest”; (5) “Of the Balance of Trade”; (6) “Of the Balance of Power”; (7) “Of Taxes”; (8) “Of Public Credit”; (9) “Of some Remarkable Customs”; (10) “Of the Populousness of Antient Nations”; (11) “Of the Protestant Succession”; and (12) “Idea of a Perfect Commonwealth.” The title of essay 2 was changed in 1760 to “Of Refinement in the Arts.”\n\nThe 1758 edition of\n\nEssays and Treatises incorporated, from a 1757 work entitled\n\nFour Dissertations, the essays “Of Tragedy” and “Of the Standard of Taste” as well as two other works,\n\nThe Natural History of Religion and\n\nA Dissertation on the Passions. Two new essays, “Of the Jealousy of Trade” and “Of the Coalition of Parties,” were added late to some copies of the 1758 edition of\n\nEssays and Treatises, then incorporated into the edition of 1760. Finally, Hume prepared still another essay, “Of the Origin of Government,” for the edition that would be published posthumously in 1777.\n\nSee, in Smith’s letter to William Strahan in the present edition, p. xlvi.\n\nReprinted in the present edition, pp. xxxi-xli.\n\nSee\n\nA Bibliography of David Hume and of Scottish Philosophy, pp. 7-8.\n\nSee John B.

David Fate Norton (Edinburgh: Tragara Press, 1976), p. 8.\n\nEditor’s Note\n\nT. H. Grose, in prefatory remarks to Hume’s\n\nEssays, Moral, Political, and Literary, admits to being struck by “the suddenness with which his labours in philosophy came to an end” with the publication of the\n\nTreatise (see “History of the Editions,” in\n\nThe Philosophical Works of David Hume, ed. T. H. Green and T. H. Grose [New Edition; London: Longmans, Green, and Co., 1889], 3.75). Grose maintains that Hume “certainly lacked the disposition, and probably the ability,” for constructive philosophy, once the critical or negative task of the\n\nTreatise was completed (ibid., p. 76). Though contrary to what Hume himself says about his mature writings as well as to what other interpreters have said about his abilities, this view was a rather common one at the turn of the century. It helped gain for Hume’s\n\nTreatise the attention that it deserves, but at the same time it discouraged the study of Hume’s other writings, particularly the\n\nEssays, as proper sources for his philosophy.\n\nA few years ago, Roland Hall observed: “Hume’s\n\nEssays, Moral, Political, and Literary have not been properly edited, and the best text may still be that in the Green and Grose\n\nPhilosophical Works.” See\n\nFifty Years of Hume Scholarship: A Bibliographical Guide (Edinburgh: University Press, 1978), p. 5.\n\nPeter H. Nidditch writes: “In my view, a suitable and attainable standard of accuracy in the text (from printed materials) offered by an editor working single-handed is an average in his first edition of two brief miswordings and of six erroneous forms per forty thousand words of the text; in the first reprint taking account of his rechecking (which is a pressing duty), these allowances should be halved. This is the standard I have adopted as the General Editor of\n\nThe Clarendon Edition of the Works of John Locke (Oxford, 1975, in progress).” See\n\nAn Apparatus of Variant Readings for Hume’s Treatise of Human Nature (Department of Philosophy, University of Sheffield, 1976), p. 34.\n\nIn the 1777 edition of Hume’s\n\nEssays and Treatises on Several Subjects, proper names and adjectives derived therefrom (e.g., “BRITISH,” “FRENCH”) are printed entirely in capital letters, with the first letter being larger than the rest. Abstract nouns are sometimes printed the same way for emphasis or to indicate divisions in the argument (e.g., “FORCE,” “POWER,” and “PROPERTY” in “Of the First Principles of Government”; “AUTHORITY” and “LIBERTY” in “Of the Origin of Government”). Occasionally, however, words are printed entirely in large capital letters (“GOD”) or entirely in small capitals (e.g., “INTEREST” and “IIGHT” in “Of the First Principles of Government”). It is uncertain to what extent this reflects Hume’s manuscript practice, as distinguished from contemporary book trade convention, but in any event, Hume did have the opportunity to correct what finally went into print. Since these peculiarities of capitalization may be relevant to the interpretation of the text, they have been preserved in the present edition.\n\nThe Introduction and Appendix to Nidditch’s edition of Locke’s\n\nEssay provide a very helpful discussion of the techniques and terminology of critical-text editing. Nidditch’s editorial work on some of Hume’s most important writings is also noteworthy. He has revised the texts and added notes to the standard Selby-Bigge editions of the\n\nEnquiries Concerning Human Understanding, and Concerning the Principles of Morals, 3rd ed. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1975), and the\n\nTreatise of Human Nature, 2nd ed. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1978). Nidditch discusses the problems of editing Hume as well as the merits of various editions of Hume’s writings in the aforementioned texts as well as in\n\nAn Apparatus of Variant Readings for Hume’s Treatise of Human Nature.\n\nIn “Notes” to Hume’s\n\nEnquiries Concerning Human Understanding, and Concerning the Principles of Morals, p. 348.\n\nMy Own Life, by David Hume\n\n[This autobiography and the accompanying letter from Adam Smith to William Strahan were published in March, 1777, as\n\nThe Life of David Hume, Esq. Written by Himself (London: Printed for W. Strahan; and T. Cadell, in the Strand). At the time the autobiography was written, the disorder that would take Hume’s life on August 25, 1776, was already well advanced. To Adam Smith, who had been entrusted with his manuscripts, Hume wrote on May 3: “You will find among my Papers a very inoffensive Piece, called\n\nMy own Life, which I composed a few days before I left Edinburgh, when I thought, as did all my Friends, that my life was despaired of. There can be no Objection, that this small piece should be sent to Messrs Strahan and Cadell and the Proprietors of my other Works to be prefixed to any future Edition of them” (in J. Y. T. Greig,\n\nThe Letters of David Hume [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1932], 2:318). Concerned lest Smith delay the publication of this and other manuscripts, Hume added a codicil to his will, dated August 7, leaving all of his manuscripts to Strahan and giving specific directions as to their publication. Regarding\n\nMy own Life, he wrote: “My Account of my own Life, I desire may be prefixed to the first Edition of my Works, printed after my Death, which will probably be the one at present in the Press” (in Greig, 2:453). The 1777 edition of\n\nEssays and Treatises on Several Subjects did not contain the autobiography, but it was added to the first, 1778, posthumous edition of the\n\nHistory of England. In writing his autobiography, Hume anticipated the keen desire on the public’s part to know, in view of his scepticism about the claims of revealed religion, if he would face death with philosophical tranquillity. It was in the context of the lively public debate following Hume’s death that Adam Smith composed his letter to William Strahan, describing Hume’s tranquil state of mind during his final months and testifying to his strength of character. With the publication of his letter to Strahan, Smith himself now became the target of widespread indignation for his approval of Hume’s manner of death. A decade later he would write: “A single, and as I thought, a very harmless Sheet of paper which I happened to write concerning the death of our late friend, Mr. Hume, brought upon me ten times more abuse than the very violent attack I had made upon the whole commercial system of Great Britain” (quoted in Ernest Campbell Mossner,\n\nThe Life of David Hume [Edinburgh: Thomas Nelson and Sons, 1954], p. 605.) The attacks on Hume’s\n\nLife and Smith’s\n\nLetter are discussed by Mossner,\n\nThe Life of David Hume, pp. 604-607, 620-622, and by T. H. Grose in the “History of the Editions” that begins the Green and Grose edition of Hume’s\n\nEssays: Moral, Political, and Literary (London: Longmans, Green, and Co., 1889), 1:80-84. Almost all printings of Hume’s\n\nLife and Smith’s\n\nLetter, including that of Green and Grose, have followed the edition of 1777. A reliable version of the 1777 edition can be found in Norman Kemp Smith’s “Second Edition” of Hume’s\n\nDialogues Concerning Natural Religion (Edinburgh: Nelson, 1947; Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, n.d.), pp. 231-48. I have compared the Green and Grose version with that of 1777 and corrected a few errors of wording and punctuation. In the case of Hume’s\n\nLife, the manuscript has been preserved; and it is reprinted in Greig,\n\nLetters, 1:1-7, and in Mossner,\n\nLife of David Hume, pp. 611-15. The first printed version of\n\nMy own Life and subsequent printings based upon it differ markedly from Hume’s manuscript version in punctuation, capitalization, and spelling; and there are also some important differences in wording. Hume did not, of course, have the opportunity to correct the printed version. I have noted these differences in wording at appropriate places in the present text.]\n\n[Hume’s manuscript has: To attend him as Secretary.]\n\n[Hume’s MS.: I there wore.]\n\n[Hume’s MS.: in the Course.]\n\n[Hume’s MS.: Pound.]\n\n[Hume’s MS.: at first but little.]\n\n[Hume’s MS.: this Fury.]\n\n[Hume’s MS.: distinguishes.]\n\n[Hume’s MS.: Lord Hertford.]\n\n[Hume’s MS.: Effect.]\n\n[Hume’s MS.: Recoiled.]\n\n[Hume’s MS.: the city.]\n\n[Hume’s MS.: pounds.]\n\n[Hume’s MS.: I know, that I had.]\n\n[Hume’s MS.: humour.]\n\nPart I, Essay I\n\nCategories: David Hume"
