We are looking for a new colleague who is passionate about Classics and eager to share that enthusiasm with middle and upper school students. With courses offered in grades 7 through 12, our department is keen to add a versatile colleague to our collaborative and collegial team who is equally capable of teaching dynamic introductory courses alongside advanced and AP courses.\n\nWho You Are\n\nMaking Latin accessible to all students and meeting them where they are have enabled us to grow the number of students taking Latin in recent years. A colleague with the following will be the most helpful to us as we look to continue this upward trend:\n\nPedagogical approach that embraces the reading method and use of texts such as the Oxford Latin Course and the Cambridge Latin Courses\n\nDeep and varied teaching tool kit that includes project-based learning and various forms of authentic assessment\n\nA student-centered approach to teaching and learning, with an emphasis on making the curriculum relevant and meaningful to middle and upper school students\n\nInterest in running clubs and activities related to Classics\n\nDeep commitment to building and sustaining inclusive learning spaces\n\nAbility to teach Greek a plus, but certainly not required\n\nWho We Are\n\nWhile each employee at Episcopal brings a unique set of competencies and skills to their work, we believe all employees should:\n\nBe student-centered, embraces school and life and shows it through actions and interactions with students, colleagues, and parents.\n\nEmbody and live The Stripes.\n\nConsistently maintain high standards for his or her own work and motivates others to achieve the same standard of excellence.\n\nDemonstrate a desire and willingness to constantly grow and learn, both personally and professionally, and sees others – especially students – as having the ability to learn and reach success.\n\nFoster a positive culture by being optimistic, selfless, flexible, and collaborative.\n\nDemonstrate a belief in and commitment to fostering an inclusive and diverse school community.\n\nHow to Apply\n\nInterested candidates should submit a cover letter, current resume, and list of three references as pdf documents to jobs@episcopalacademy.org.

But activism is not solely a modern concern. We can find examples of community-based interventions in antiquity as well, such as, arguably, Spartacus’ revolt, Greek and Roman land reform movements, or Lysistrata’s strike.\n\nIn this affiliated group panel the Classics and Social Justice group endeavors to build on activist work through talks that link contemporary activism with movements and ideas in the Greek and Roman worlds. We are interested in continuing to bring scholarship into dialogue with activist practice and critiques, and seek a wide range of papers that deal with questions of activism in antiquity and in the present day, broadly defined.\n\nPaper topics might include, but are not limited to:\n\nproposing new ways of looking at ancient movements for land and wealth redistribution or revolts of enslaved people in the light of recent movements calling for reparations, criminal justice reform, education reform, and leveling income inequality\n\nexamining how modern debates concerning democracy affect thinking about organizing and agitating in the classical world\n\nconversely, analyzing what classical models, theories, and historical events add as paradigms or warnings for activism today\n\nDecentering Classics through activism\n\nOffering self-reflexive critiques of activism in the Classics\n\ncritiquing the applicability of modern paradigms of activism to the ancient world\n\npresenting specific public-facing outreach projects that use Classics\n\npresenting specific educational policy advocacy efforts that use Classics\n\npresenting activism connected to museums and archaeology\n\nexamining the role of teacher and student activism in the Classics classroom\n\nAbstracts are welcome from all SCS/AIA members and will be anonymously selected.\n\nPlease send abstracts for 20-minute talks (up to 350 words) to Nancy Rabinowitz (nrabinow@hamilton.edu) by February 15, 2021.\n\nPosted on\n\nClassics and Social Justice at the 2021 SCS/AIA\n\nIf you have things that seem related to the Classics and Social Justice mission that you would like to see included here, please email amypistone at gmail dot com.\n\nAll times listed are Central Time.\n\nMeetings and Receptions of Interest\n\nCSJ Open Meeting: Tuesday, January 5, 5-6pm CT (access link)\n\nWCC’s Welcome Night Reception and Awards Ceremony: Tuesday, January 5, 8 – 10pm\n\nPachanga Latina: A Hispanic/Latinx Faculty and Grad Student Meet and Greet: Wednesday, January 6, 6:30 – 7:30pm\n\nReception: MRECC and EOS’s Reception in Honor of Shelley Haley and Her Assumption of the SCS Presidency: Thursday, January 7, 8 – 9pm\n\nMountaintop Coalition Virtual Reception: Friday, January 8, 7:30 – 8:30pm\n\nWCC Open Meeting: Saturday, January 9, 12 – 1pm\n\nJanuary 5\n\n9am – 12pm: Classics In/Out of Asia (AAACC panel)\n\n2 – 5pm: Ancient Theater in Chicagoland (CAMP panel)\n\nJanuary 6\n\n9am – 12pm: Believing Ancient Women: A Feminist Epistemology for Greece and Rome (seminar)\n\nYou must sign-up for this seminar before it takes place.

What was conceived as an intimate gathering on the campus of Mary Washington for those teaching Classics was transformed into a digital event attracting 250 registrants from twelve countries. In our papers and conversations, we explored how people on the margins in our texts and contexts are invited—or pushed further from—the center, and explored avenues through with such marginalization might be addressed. Following the conference, recordings of the presentations were made available online at resdifficiles.com. Furthermore, a selection of those papers is being prepared for publication in a co-edited series of consecutive issues in Ancient History Bulletin which will start to appear in 2021.\n\nThough tempted to narrow our focus to any one of the critical issues in and surrounding the discipline, we elected to maintain the furry and broad welcome to a Classics community that clearly needs to talk. In this second wholly digital conference, we shall once again examine the challenges presented by this curriculum with students who are increasingly more diverse in gender identity, race, ethnicity, income, family structure, and more. And while the society of our conference will examine pedagogical issues, we hope again to dilate outward to broader issues in education and society from (a) the current and future roles of Classics and the humanities in K-12 and higher education to (b) the ultimate goals of education. We invite papers from all those who study and teach the ancient world.\n\nOur keynote speaker will be Patrice Rankine, Dean of the School of Arts and Sciences and Professor of Classics at the University of Richmond.\n\nThe conference will be hosted as a Zoom webinar with a capacity of 500. Please note that the time zone of the conference will be US Eastern.\n\nAbstracts of 350 words should be sent electronically to Joseph Romero (jromero@umw.edu) by January 8, 2021. Papers will be 20-25 minutes with coordinated discussion at the end of each session. Any questions regarding abstract submission may be addressed to Professors Romero or Čulík-Baird (culik@bu.edu).

But how did we get to this moment? How can Classics help us process a historical and scholarly legacy of white supremacy? As a recent article stated, “Classics can and should be seen as a field with diverse origins and a rich history of contributions, interpretations, and reinterpretations by people of all races. It is not the heritage of one group of people to the exclusion of another, and it cannot be used to form the bedrock of a white supremacist ideology.” The editors of the Classical Memories/Modern Identities Series seek innovative scholarship that focuses on fully mapping out the racial complexities of the ancient world and how they relate to our time. We are looking for works that reflect on the contributions of African-Americans, Indigenous, Latinx, Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA), and other underrepresented groups in the field of Classics. We are also searching for works that investigate the archaeology of Classics as a discipline, the complexities and compromises of its formation and development, its appropriation by and for racist agendas, and its deployment as a tool of resistance.\n\nThe series is already dedicated to exploring how the classical world has been variously interpreted, transformed, and appropriated to forge a usable past and a livable present. Books published in this series detail both the positive and negative aspects of classical reception and take an expansive view of the topic. Thus it includes works that examine the function of translations, adaptations, invocations, and classical scholarship in personal, cultural, national, sexual, and racial formations. Please email Ana Maria Jimenez-Moreno at the Ohio State University Press for more information.\n\nPosted on\n\nCFP: Global Antiquities (Journal)\n\nCall for Papers\n\nGlobal Antiquities\n\nLAUNCHING IN 2020!\n\nGlobal Antiquities (GA) is a peer-reviewed, open-access journal dedicated to promoting academic work at the crossroads of Classics and Global Studies. The journal aims to publish research that engages scholars of ancient and modern worlds in dialogue about globalization and its effects, both historical and contemporary. Poverty, war, xenophobia, nationalism, migration, terrorism, imperialism, racism: these are major issues in global history shaped powerfully by the contexts in which they occur. GA welcomes submissions of research articles, book reviews, review articles, translations, and commentaries by scholars across disciplines seeking to understand and illuminate global issues through time, from antiquity to the present day.\n\nGlobal Antiquities is edited by an international editorial team, supported by a distinguished and diverse advisory board.\n\nVisit https://globalantiquities.pitt.edu/GA/about/editorialTeam for details.\n\nNOW INVITING SUBMISSIONS\n\nGlobal Antiquities invites submissions from Classicists, Ancient Historians, Archaeologists, and scholars in related fields, whose research is in dialogue with contemporary Globalization Studies. We also welcome papers from post-Classical Historians, Political Scientists, Theorists, and Philosophers, Anthropologists, Sociologists, and other social scientists and humanists whose work on global issues engages with the ancient past.\n\nWe view as “global” those features of human societies throughout history that cross real or imagined boundaries (geographic, chronological, cultural) and destabilize the primacy of the “state” or “nation” as the fundamental unit of analysis in world history. These “global” features are sometimes described processually as “flows” or “movements”, at other times statically as “systems” or “structures”. We seek work that challenges historical narratives of separateness rooted in a national imaginary, with narratives of interconnectivity and mobility made possible by globalization. Global Antiquities therefore invites submissions on a broad range of topics including (but not limited to):\n\npoverty, inequality, enslavement, human rights\n\nwar, peace, terrorism, diplomacy\n\nstate formation and development; interstate networks, commerce, and governance\n\nancient and modern identities (esp. the role of antiquity in configuring post-Classical identities)\n\nperceptions and expressions of difference (e.g. in gender, race, religion, ethnicity, ability, nationality, sexual identity, etc.)\n\nnationalism, indigeneity, citizenship, xenophobia\n\nmigration, mobility, displacement\n\ncenter, border, and periphery\n\nconstructions and propagations of culture (esp. across borders)\n\nillness and public health (including mental health); disability studies\n\nimperialisms; colonization; exploration and geography\n\nclimate change, the environment, environmental justice\n\norganization, structures, and movement of knowledge; technology in society\n\nsocial movements and activism\n\ntransnational organizations (including criminal) and movements\n\nperceptions of and attendance to basic needs and threats thereto (e.g. drought, famine)\n\nIn addition, the editorial team also welcomes proposals for edited special issues bringing together cross-disciplinary articles on a single subject. Prospective editors should contact the journal staff for proposal guidelines and further instructions.\n\nHOW TO SUBMIT\n\nFull guidelines for authors are available at https://globalantiquities.pitt.edu/GA/about/submissions\n\nTo submit your paper online go to https://globalantiquities.pitt.edu/GA/submission/wizard\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\nVisit https://globalantiquities.pitt.edu/GA to subscribe and register for email alerts!\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\nFor further details visit the journal homepage at https://globalantiquities.pitt.edu/GA\n\nPosted on\n\nLetter of Support and Solidarity for Black Classicists\n\nClassics and Social Justice welcomes the Women’s Classical Caucus as a co-signatory to this statement.\n\nClassics and Social Justice unequivocally supports #BlackLivesMatter. We strongly oppose the racism and state-sanctioned violence that unjustly target Black people, and we pledge our advocacy, as well as our resources, to support Black lives. We support protestors who are seeking justice and the end of police brutality and advocating for community-based restorative justice. We affirm the pain, grief, frustration, anger, and other emotions that our Black members, colleagues, and students are experiencing as a result of a society that does not recognize their full humanity. We recognize that the privileges those of us who are white enjoy are afforded by the past and continuing oppression of Black communities.\n\nWe express our support as scholars and students of the ancient Mediterranean world, whose work notably pertains to the study of ancient imperialisms and the historical links between modern white supremacy, slavery, settler colonialism, and a Eurocentric, whitewashed understanding of Greece and Rome as the universally valid and inherently superior ‘Classics’.\n\nWe recognize that our membership is predominantly white and that there are many groups in our field that are better able to represent the voices of Black classicists (including Mountaintop and Eos, among others). With that in mind, we ask our members (particularly our white members) to first listen and learn what we can do to best support our Black colleagues and to amplify Black voices. It is not the job of our Black colleagues to do the emotional and intellectual labor of educating anyone about how to be good allies. The resources are available, and it is incumbent on non-Black people to do the work of learning how to be anti-racists. One good place to start is by reading the Sportula’s statement of Solidarity: Statement of Solidarity with #BlackLivesMatter – The Sportula Microgrants For Classics Students.\n\nActions: White silence and complicity with a racist system are unacceptable. A statement of solidarity is an important first step, but it is not enough. We therefore urge fellow non-Black classicists and Classics departments to do something concrete. Constructive, helpful actions include:\n\nDonate to organizations dedicated to supporting classicists of color such as the Sportula.\n\nCreate an action plan in your department with concrete steps that you will take to promote #BlackLivesMatter. Advocate for your professional organizations to do the same.\n\nInclude readings by Black scholars on your syllabi, particularly Black women, and Black-Centered Resources. Do so in a non tokenizing way, and emphasize the past and ongoing contributions of Black scholars to our field.\n\nOrganize and conduct over the upcoming academic year a series of faculty-led workshops using Black Lives Matter’s public syllabus.\n\nLeverage faculty and institutional privileges by implementing a coordinated strategy for public engagement about the entanglements between anti-Black racism and the field of Classics (op-eds, twitter threads, public lectures).\n\nWork with librarians to develop resource lists, open source syllabi, or a lecture series on topics such as Classics and Blackness or Classics and White Supremacy. Engage with the work of scholars around Critical Race Theory and create opportunities for your students and colleagues to do the same.\n\nDevelop and execute strategies to attract and retain faculty and graduate students from Black communities by addressing the implicit and explicit barriers to Black scholarship in our discipline and institutions.\n\nUse whatever pull you have in your institutions to support Black-led efforts for institutional reform beyond the departmental scale, including opposing exploitation of low-wage employees of color, supporting Black student groups, revising racist historical narratives of the institution, increasing accountability for university or school police, and any other issues facing Black members of your campus community.\n\nAmplify the work and words of your Black colleagues.\n\nShow up to protests, if you are able and have done the work to be a good ally at a protest. If you are white, your body gives you greater protection by virtue of our white supremacist system of policing. When joining a protest, use the privilege and protection afforded by your white body to protect others.\n\nDonate to bail funds for people who have been arrested while protesting. Here is a list of bail funds and legal help by city.\n\nDevelop an accountability plan to make sure that you, your department, and your colleagues are making concrete progress toward racial justice.\n\nHere is a much larger list of resources for Accountability and Actions for Black Lives and a list of 75 Things White People Can Do for Racial Justice.\n\nListen to what Black people are asking and telling you to do. Any move toward racial justice, in the academy and in our society as a whole, will need to center Black voices.\n\n10 Ways For Non-Black Academics to Value Black Lives\n\nhttps://twitter.com/trussleadership/status/1267333391604527104\n\nhttps://twitter.com/mireillecharper/status/1266335563197501440\n\nAdditional resources:\n\nResources for scaffolded anti-racism work\n\nAnti-racism resources for white people\n\nPosted on\n\nClassicists in Solidarity with the Wet’suwet’en First Nation\n\nWe are cross-posting this statement to amplify the statement and hopefully reach a broader audience. The full statement is available here.\n\nIf you are a Classicist living, studying or working in North America and you wish to sign the solidarity statement below, you can still do so via this link. The group of Classicists behind this initiative thanks the authors of the University of Toronto’s Department of Geography and Planning Solidarity with Wet’suwet’en statement, on which the following text is based.\n\nNorth America-based Classicists in Solidarity with the Wet’suwet’en\n\nWe, a group of classicists living, studying and working across North America, write in the spirit of solidarity with the Wet’suwet’en First Nation, as they peacefully work to defend their sovereignty over their unceded territories. We express our support as scholars and students of the ancient Mediterranean world, whose work notably pertains to the study of ancient imperialisms and the historical link between modern settler colonialism and a Eurocentric understanding of Greece and Rome as the universally valid and inherently superior ‘Classics’. We understand our roles as educators, researchers and organizers to have specific responsibilities to Indigenous peoples’ efforts to protect their lands, waters, and peoples. continue reading >>"
