She was the oldest of four children and grew up helping at her parent's restaurant. In 1945, she married Man Ting Kwan. Together, they had 8 children. In 1980, Feng Ying immigrated to Canada with her husband and family. While in Canada, she resided in Saskatoon and briefly lived in Vancouver.\n\nFeng Ying was a hard worker who was a pillar of support for her family. From owning a grocery store in China with her husband to being an integral part of many of her children's restaurants and businesses, she persevered to provide for her children.\n\nFeng Ying's greatest pride was her family. She is survived by her brother and 7 children: Wen Shi, Andy, Jean, David, Mei Lin, Debbie, and Jennifer, and their spouses as well as 22 grandchildren and 20 great-grandchildren, along with numerous other extended family members.\n\nHer family is celebrating her 98 years of amazing health, as she lived a full and loving life and spent time with family and friends in her final years. Feng Ying was predeceased by her husband Man Ting Kwan and daughter Mei Lan.\n\nFeng Ying's family would like to thank her caregivers, Cindy Lin and Bernice Van Der Velden, who treated her like family. They would also like to thank Dr. Arun Nayar and Dr. Jim Barton for their time and excellent care.\n\nA funeral service will be held at 10 am on Friday, January 19th, at the Saskatoon Funeral Home.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please consider donating to the Saskatoon Food Bank and Learning Centre."
