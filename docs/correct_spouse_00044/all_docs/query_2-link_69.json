        "text": "Elizabeth Hurley's Indian wedding outfit cost an incredible ?64,000.\n\nThe British star, who married Arun Nayar in a lavish Hindu ceremony on Saturday (10.03.07), wore a diamond encrusted pink sari worth ?4,000, ?40,000 earrings and a ?20,000 bracelet.\n\nLiz's hands were covered in traditional henna tattoos, which cost a mere ?5.\n\nArun's bejewelled coat and turban added a modest ?5,000 to the wedding bill.\n\nLiz's four-year-old son Damian - from her relationship with movie producer Steve Bing - wore a matching coat and trousers costing ?3,000.\n\nThe Indian ceremony held at the Maharajah of Jodhpur's palace was the couple's third wedding event. They married in a civil ceremony in Gloucestershire's Sudeley Castle, England, on March 2. Guests were invited to a blessing and a party at the castle the following night.\n\nLiz and Arun chartered a jet - costing a further ?100,000 - to take friends and family to India for the Hindu part of their union.\n\nCelebrity magazine Hello! have reportedly paid a seven-figure sum for the couple's exclusive wedding pictures.\n\nLiz, 41, and Arun, 42, are said to have jetted off to the Maldives for their honeymoon on 10 March."
