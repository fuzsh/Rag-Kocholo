        "text": "I've had quite a few. I had a one night holiday in London a few years ago and I went to a one-day cookery class at Leith's School of Food and Wine. I was very shy at the time and staring at the floor. Everyone had to pick a partner to cook with. A multimillionaire model called Kim Johnson chose me. There was free wine available and I kept on asking for more and she was telling me about how on the weekend she would be going to Tuscany with her partner, Arun Nayar, to hunt for truffles. What I found interesting about this model is she looked a bit like Liz Hurley, the actress, and that was Arun Nayar's ex-wife so he was clearly with this woman because he was trying to recreate the original Liz Hurley.\n\nI was in Manchester PIccadilly train station once and all the flights out of England had been cancelled that day because of volcanic ash coming out of a volcano in Iceland. You wouldn't believe who I saw a few metres away from me. Robert Redford!"
