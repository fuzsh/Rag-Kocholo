        "text": "Glam gazillionaires Elizabeth Hurley and her hubby, textiles heir Arun Nayar, were forced this week to shell out a five-figure settlement to an Indian-born maid who accused the couple of being cheap with the help!\n\nViolet D’Souza, who worked for the accused Estee Lauder skinflint and her Indian-born spouse in their chichi West London manse for less than $3 per hour, was thisclose to telling all to an employment tribunal yesterday, but her hearing was cancelled Tuesday, according to the London tabloids.\n\nApparently, Liz and Arun, who were married last March in two lavish bi-continental weddings, ponied up some hush money to D’Souza, who was paid $200 per week for 70 hours of cleaning, cooking and babysitting Hurley’s 5-year-old son, Damian.\n\nViolet’s main perk, according to the Mirror, was the offer of airline tickets home to see her family in India.\n\nThe couple dismissed D’Souza without notice in August and she retaliated by slapping them with a breach of contract suit shortly thereafter.\n\nThe Mirror and Daily Mail reported that the 31-year-old domestic worked seven days a week, starting at 7:30 a.m. and sometimes finishing up around 3 a.m. for a paycheck of 8,000 rupees. They didn’t even pay her in British pounds!\n\nThe minimum wage in Britain, BTW, is $10.71 per hour.\n\nHurley, the “Austin Powers” actress and face of Estee Lauder, is believed to be worth $25 million, while her hubby is the heir to a fabulously rich textiles family in Mumbai.\n\nAccording to the reports, D’Souza is believed to have worked for Nayar’s family before the scion brought her to London in 2003."
