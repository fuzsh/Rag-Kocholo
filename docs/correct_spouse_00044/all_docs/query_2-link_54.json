        "text": "Hugh Grant and Elizabeth Hurley were once the UK's power couple.\n\nHe was the dashing leading man and she was Britain's glamour girl. But their relationship faced the ultimate test when the actor was arrested by police one fateful night in LA back in 1995.\n\nSurprisingly, Hurley stood by his side throughout the scandal. They would eventually split five years later but to this day remain the best of friends.\n\nHere's how their relationship evolved...\n\nHow long did Hugh Grant and Liz Hurley date?\n\nGrant and Hurley were a power couple before it was even a thing. They dated from 1987 to 2000, when they parted ways amicably.\n\nAt the start of their relationship, Grant was the bigger star having starred in Four Weddings and a Funeral, Sense and Sensibility and Sirens.\n\nBut Hurley — a successful model in her own right — could hold her own, especially on the red carpet. She created one of fashion's memorable moments back in 1994 when she wore that black safety-pin Versace dress to the London premiere of Four Weddings and a Funeral.\n\nHow did Hugh Grant and Liz Hurley meet?\n\nThe couple met on the set of the Spanish film Remando al Viento (Rowing with the Wind) in 1987 — it was Hurley's first major acting role.\n\nGrant played Lord Byron in the drama-mystery and Hurley played his former lover Claire Clairmont. The co-stars had chemistry both on set and off and soon went out on a date. Their relationship would last 13 years.\n\nWhy was Hugh Grant arrested?\n\nTheir relationship faced the ultimate test in 1995 when Grant was arrested for engaging in lewd conduct after picking up a sex worker off the Sunset Strip in LA.\n\nAt the time, the actor was in Hollywood to promote his film, Nine Months. But afterwards, he found himself behind bars and now has a mugshot that will forever haunt him.\n\n\"Last night I did something completely insane. I have hurt people I love and embarrassed people I work with. For both things, I am more sorry than I can ever possibly say,\" he said in a public statement following his arrest.\n\nREAD MORE: Elizabeth Hurley's dating history: Everything we know about her past relationships\n\nWhy did Hugh Grant and Liz Hurley break up?\n\nSurprisingly, Hurley stood by his side throughout the ordeal but they eventually went their separate ways in 2000, with the 1995 cheating scandal undoubtedly playing a role in their breakup.\n\nAlthough to this day Hurley has never spoken out about his arrest, Grant has discussed it in numerous interviews.\n\nJust last week, he revealed on the WTF with Marc Maron podcast that he was not in a \"good frame of mind\" when he was busted on the Sunset Strip. Grant said he was disappointed in his acting in Nine Months and felt he let down his co-stars Julianne Moore and Robin Williams.\n\n\"I was about to launch my first Hollywood film — my timing was impeccable,\" Grant said on the March 11 podcast. \"My problem was that was my first Hollywood film and I'd just been to see it.\n\n\"The film was about to come out a week or two after that, and I had a bad feeling about it. I went to see a screening. Everyone in it was brilliant, but I was so atrocious that I was not in a good frame of mind.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Inside Hugh Grant's complicated family life\n\nThe ordeal was challenging to overcome but now Grant and Hurley are at a place where they can laugh about it.\n\nHurley made light of the situation in 2017 on her now-defunct TV series, The Royals. The actress played Queen Helena, the fictional queen of England, who is set up with a male prostitute named 'Huge Grant'. Side note: she did not sleep with him but the joke delighted viewers.\n\nIn an appearance on Watch What Happens Live in 2015, Grant shed some insight into why they split.\n\n\"The sex bit probably fizzled out, but now she's my absolute best friend — number one person I call in a crisis,\" he told host Andy Cohen.\n\nMeanwhile, during Hurley's interview on WWHL that same year, she said Grant's grumpiness is what also contributed to their breakup.\n\n\"He used to really annoy me, actually. I mean, I love him, but, um, he's very annoying,\" she said. \"My friends used to call him Grumpelstiltskin. He is very grumpy. But I found it actually fairly charming.\"\n\nREAD MORE: What happened between Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck?\n\nAre Hugh Grant and Elizabeth Hurley still friends?\n\nGrant and Hurley never married and never had children together, but they remain the closest of friends. The exes split 21 years ago but they are still in contact. Every day.\n\n\"We met on a movie 29 years ago and he's still my best friend today, and I still speak with him every day,\" she told Us Weekly in 2016. \"That was the best co-star I've ever had for sure.\"\n\nIt helps that they are neighbours and are godparents to each other's children — Grant is the godfather of Hurley's son, Damian, and she is godmother to one of his daughters.\n\n\"I'm very lucky that 31 years into our friendship, he's still my best friend in the world. He's a really great guy,\" she told E! News in 2018. \"Yeah, I see him a lot, I speak to him a lot. You know, he's now a father of five, he has five kids and he's a great dad. He'll remain my best friend for life.\"\n\nWho is Hugh Grant married to now?\n\nGrant reportedly married his longterm girlfriend Anna Eberstein in 2018. He shares three children with the television producer and also has two other children with ex-girlfriend, receptionist Tinglan Hong.\n\nIn 2018, it was Hurley who confirmed the arrival of Grant's fifth and youngest child.\n\n\"He had another one last week. He has five. He was over 50 when he spawned them all!\" she said on WWHL. \"He's an enchanting dad — really, really sweet.\"\n\nREAD MORE: What happened between Laura Dern and Billy Bob Thornton?\n\nWho is Liz Hurley married to now?\n\nHurley married Indian textiles heir and businessman Arun Nayar in March 2007.\n\nThe couple, who were introduced over dinner by a mutual friend five years prior, had two lavish ceremonies that month — the first a Christian ceremony held at Sudeley Castle in England and the second a lavish Hindu ceremony in India.\n\nThe couple split in 2010 after three years of marriage and finalised their divorce in 2011.\n\nHurley moved on to Aussie cricketer Shane Warne after her split. The couple got engaged in October 2011, four months after her divorce from Nayar was finalised. But they never made it down the aisle as the pair split in 2013.\n\nBefore meeting Nayar, Hurley dated businessman Steve Bing on and off in the early 2000s. They split for good after 18 months, only to discover weeks later Hurley she was pregnant with Damian, who she welcomed as a single parent in April 2002. Bing initially denied the claims but a paternity test later confirmed he was the father.\n\nThe businessman sadly passed away in June 2020 after reportedly taking his own life.\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, sign up here to receive our top stories straight to your inbox"
