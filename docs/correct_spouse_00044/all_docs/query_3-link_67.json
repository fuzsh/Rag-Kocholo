        "text": "Apparently Demi Moore, Bruce Willis and Ashton Kutcher aren’t the only former spouses and new husbands who get along like best of friends.\n\nHugh Grant tagged along with Elizabeth Hurley, her five-year-old son Damian and Hurley’s new businessman husband, Arun Nayar, to Seychelles island, off the East coast of Africa, where they vacationed on October 24.\n\nHugh Grant, Liz Hurley & Arun Nayar: Two’s company… three’s a crowd?\n\nElizabeth Hurley, 42, and Hugh Grant, 47, certainly weathered a lot over the course of a 13-year relationship, namely him appearing in many romantic comedies, as well as soliciting oral sex from a cheap hooker, before parting ways in 2000.\n\nBut Elizabeth Hurley has maintained they remain close friends.\n\nIn fact, the handsome actor is even one of Damian’s godfathers, and was even invited to Elizabeth Hurley’s fabulous March nuptials with Arun Nayar.\n\nThe actor was a no-show, however, because he did not want to create a media craze and take the attention away from the Austin Powers star’s big day with Nayar."
