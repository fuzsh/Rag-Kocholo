        "text": "WINCHCOMBE, England - Elizabeth Hurley married an Indian businessman in a private civil ceremony at a 15th-century castle, and photographers and spectators descended Saturday on this quiet town in western England to catch a glimpse of their lavish wedding party.\n\nBritish actress and model Elizabeth Hurley (L) arrives with partner Arun Nayer at Harrods department store to promote a swimwear range, in central London, in this April 12, 2005 file photo. [Reuters]\n\nGloucestershire County Council confirmed that Hurley and Arun Nayar married Friday at Sudeley Castle in Winchcombe, 125 miles west of London. The pair held a blessing and party at the castle Saturday evening, with guests including Elton John, Kate Moss, Elle Macpherson and Hurleyâs ex, Hugh Grant.\n\nSecurity guards on Saturday patrolled the castle grounds, set amid the Cotswold hills of western England. A large tent had been erected on the grounds, and a covered walkway led from the gardens to the building.\n\nHurley, 41, and Nayar, 42, reportedly have signed a lucrative deal with Hello! magazine for exclusive rights to images of the event. Hurley made appearances in the âAustin Powersâ movies and âBedazzledâ and for several years was the international face of Estee Lauder cosmetics.\n\nSeveral shopfronts in the picturesque town were adorned with signs and notices wishing the couple good luck.\n\nâObviously, people are out celebrity spotting â I donât think theyâll see any but they are out at the thought â and itâs just a lot of excitement for the small town of Winchcombe,â said butcher Colin Pilcher."
