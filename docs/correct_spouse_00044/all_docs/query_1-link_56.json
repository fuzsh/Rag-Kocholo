        "text": "The Indian father-in-law of British actress Elizabeth Hurley said in an interview yesterday that he had cut ties with his son, Arun Nayar, amid anger over their lavish wedding.\n\nVinod Nayar told the Sunday Mirror from Mumbai that he and his wife Joanne felt \"publicly humiliated\" and treated \"like social outcasts\" at the event, which took place in Britain and India last month. \"Liz and Arun have treated us very shabbily. My heart is heavy with pain,\" the newspaper quoted him as saying.\n\nNayar senior, a textile magnate, claims that the couple seemed to disrespect Indian relatives. \"We were pushed into the background like poor relations. This has broken my heart,\" the 66-year-old added.\n\nGuests at the wedding celebrations included singer Sir Elton John and supermodel Elle Macpherson.\n\nHe said that he had not spoken to his son since the wedding and had sent him a letter accusing him of having \"disregarded me like one of your office boys. . . . You have shown disrespect to me and my family, plus my dear friends who have been with me since your birth,\" the letter reportedly said."
