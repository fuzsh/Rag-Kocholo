        "text": "LONDON, England (Reuters) -- Model and actress Elizabeth Hurley married Indian businessman Arun Nayar in a secret ceremony on Friday, a day before the couple were due to host a lavish wedding party, British media reported on Saturday.\n\nThe Daily Mirror newspaper said Gloucestershire's county superintendent registrar Anne Williams conducted the civil ceremony at Sudeley Castle in the west of England together with another registrar in front of two witnesses.\n\nReverend John Partington told the Daily Mirror he would bless the couple later on Saturday at the castle, describing his blessing as \"a celebration of their wedding.\"\n\nSudeley Castle is owned by the family of Henry Dent-Brocklehurst, who is a close friend of Hurley.\n\nAfter the blessing Hurley, 41, and Nayar, 42, will host a lavish party with actress Patsy Kensit, singer Sir Elton John, fashion designer Donatella Versace as well as the model's former lover, British actor Hugh Grant, expected to attend.\n\nHurley's 13-year relationship with Hollywood star Grant ended in 2000 after his well-publicised encounter with a prostitute.\n\nTwo years later, she had a son with U.S. film producer Steve Bing. She met Nayar, who has celebrity status himself, shortly after her child was born.\n\nThe Daily Mirror said the couple will travel to Rajasthan on Sunday for a traditional Indian-style wedding.\n\nHurley's publicist was unavailable for comment.\n\nCopyright 2007 Reuters. All rights reserved.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.\n\nsource: CNN.com\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/03/03/hurley.marriage.reut/index.html\n\nCongrats to them.\n\nSo do all the guests for the England wedding have to wear saris (was that the name?) or is it only the guests at the wedding in India? Feel kind of bad for people who have to (or chose to) attend both weddings...that's a heck of a lot of traveling to do. Gawd, if I were the bride I'd be exhausted.\n\nfrom fashionweekdaily...\n\nElizabeth Hurley’s much talked-about Versace wedding dress finally came to fruition over the weekend, when the actress and model wed Arun Nayar at Sudeley Castle in Gloustershire, England on March 3. The custom-designed Atelier Versace gown was created in a luxurious ice white French chiffon and silk tulle. The bodice was embellished with micro pleats fixed entirely by hand, and the full skirt boasted shredded chiffon and tulle plissé soleil, creating a wave-like effect.\n\nThe flower girls and page boys were also in Versace for the ceremony. The girls wore 18th century-style white romantic chiffon and georgette Empire style dresses paired with a rose satin bands, while the boys wore cream white tuxedos with short trousers. For the wedding celebration party that followed the ceremony, Hurley chose to wear another Atelier Versace gown, this one a goddess dress with décolleté delicately embroidered with crystal and transparent glass beads. The soft draped silhouette underlined the side split cut ‘à la Liz,’ which reprised the clothespin Versace gown she wore to the Four Weddings and a Funeral premiere in London that put her on the international map. An exclusive Versace white silk satin “Ritz” evening pochette with silver Greek fret chain and Atelier Versace white silver sandals completed her look."
