        "text": "Elizabeth Hurley appears to be engaging in a spot of megaphone diplomacy with her husband Arun Nayar.\n\n\"I felt lonely this morning,\" she told her 15,593 followers on Twitter yesterday. \"So I cuddled and kissed my black Spaniel till he begged for mercy.\"\n\nNayar, who is believed to be preoccupied with business activities in India, was conspicuous by his absence when his wife attended Goodwood last month.\n\nThere have been whispers before about the couple's marriage, and Miss Hurley's spokesman was, to say the least, enigmatic when I asked if Nayar planned to join his wife on their Cotswolds farm before too long.\n\n\"I have no idea and I don't know anyone who can help you,\" she said, tersely. \"I am sorry, but there it is.\"\n\nStill, Miss Hurley is finding other diversions while her husband is away. \"I've taught Mr Yellow, my cockatiel, to wolf whistle,\" she also noted. \"I'm easily amused\".\n\nBaroness Greenfield: It's a man's world\n\nAlthough Baroness Greenfield withdrew her claim of sexual discrimination and unfair dismissal against the Royal Institution after it sacked her as its director, she still believes women have a tough time of it at work.\n\n\"Women have been encouraged to make men look good and not to be too pushy,\" she says. \"I often see a middle-aged scientist with an entourage of attractive young female graduates. The power lies with the male, senior scientist, like a magus with his handmaidens\n\nShe adds women should not feel the need to be \"pushy and arrogant.\" She just feels \"it would be very nice if men stopped being like that.\"\n\nPope Benedict XVI spares no expense"
