        "text": "What is changing for marriages in India today from a legal standpoint?\n\nWhen did the courts recognize the need for change?\n\nIf in 1984 the Family Courts Act came into existence, what occurred to bring it into existence? The courts saw a rise in matrimonial issues and felt the need for a special forum. The Act itself brought into the scope of the courts counselling for the first time. Special social welfare and child welfare family agencies were involved, taking matters beyond the scope of just judges and lawyers. This happened because the courts accepted that “it may be a trend that is unfortunate, but we still have to adapt to it.\"\n\nWhich have been our most path-breaking matrimonial laws/amendments?\n\nThe Domestic Violence Act 2005, which recognized the rights of a woman in a partnership without the legal or ceremonial sanction of marriage, is path-breaking. Judicial activism, interpreting the law in spirit rather than in letter, keeping in mind ground reality, is also path-breaking. The rights of men are also being considered today.\n\nWhat change does the court notice in couples who approach it?\n\nWhat is the court’s view on relationships that exist outside the purview of the court?\n\nThe alternative relationships that people are coming up with are not exactly outside the purview of the court. Though courts still uphold the institution of marriage, monogamy, etc., however, the courts now try to see that where there is a live-in relationship, where there is no legal or ceremonial sanction of marriage, where there is violence against the woman, a man cannot get away scot-free. By virtue of social sanction, a live-in relationship would be taken to be “akin to a marriage\", though not a marriage. Even in Justice (Markandey) Katju’s famous Supreme Court judgement which created a furore due to his use of words like “keep\" and “mistress\", what he meant to say was that when a woman is not legally married but is in a relationship “akin to marriage\", she is entitled to maintenance. But if it is not akin to marriage, or if it is a frivolous stay, then she is not entitled to it because it would be difficult to distinguish it from such a relationship.\n\nWhat is the criteria for a relationship to be akin to marriage?\n\nIt would be a substantial period of cohabitation. Again, what is meant by “substantial\" is subjective. The courts now look into the nature of the inter-personal relationship, which is determined after interviewing both parties. If you have lived with someone for four months, does it amount to a domestic relationship? Yes and no. It’s not the time frame alone. It is the extent of the inter-personal relationship. Assets owned together, money spent together—all are taken into account. If in a live-in relationship, the woman was taken care of by the man, he provided a roof over her head, etc., and things go sour, then she can go back to the court because for the first time the enactment/statute has also included the concept of “emotional violence\", which was earlier not there. There was only “mental cruelty\" in matrimonial law, which was again subjective. Emotional violence is that which erodes the confidence of a woman, or which amounts to humiliation. Derogatory statements, abuses, etc., are taken to be emotional violence.\n\nWhat are the alternative legal documents tenable today?\n\nPre-nups are not tenable in India as we speak, but at the same time, there are certain people in our fraternity who do draw up such pre-nups. It is, at best, a memorandum of understanding (MoU), unlike overseas, where it is an executable document. In India, this is so because the law still believes that a pre-nup can go contrary to the benefit of the woman and children. A woman in her zest may say, “I don’t want your money\" but ultimately, under the law today, she is provided for. It is “contrary to public policy\" and a pre-nup is not promoted as a matter of right.\n\nMoUs are a good alternative. There are today many marriages that don’t work within two-three months of marriage. If the reason is sexual, they often do not want to get into messy details. But they need one year from the date of marriage and one year from the date of separation for a divorce. I suggest to such couples that they get into an MoU that clearly states their terms, intent and claims. Some renege on it, some abide by it. Yet in case of a contest, at least MoUs provide the courts with a guideline to the intent of the couple. These are new innovations that help ease the way forward. They may not be legally binding, but they are morally binding.\n\nIs there a change in the way couples are managing assets?\n\nUnder the Hindu Marriage Act both husband and wife are entitled to maintenance, no other marriage Act ensures that. A new trend is men applying for alimony under this Act. There are cases where people are practical enough to know that things can fall apart… Couples have become very practical. They now demarcate assets as “individual assets\" and “joint assets\". It may not be a pre-nup but it is akin to that. Also, I’ve had the case of a working, healthy marriage where both parents drew up an MoU to contribute a proportion of their individual incomes to a trust fund for the child.\n\nWhat are the new laws in the making?\n\nThere are a dime-a-dozen laws which are well-meaning and lofty but there is many a slip in execution. The courts have now made a suggestion to the Union government that they should introduce “the irretrievable breakdown of marriage\". I was explaining to the then Union Law minister Veerappa Moily that every marriage may not be abusive, but it may not be much of a marriage either, and the spouse may not be progressive enough to take it to the point of divorce.\n\nMrunalini Deshmukh has been legal counsel to Aamir and Reena Khan, Karisma Kapoor and Valentina Pedroni (Arun Nayar’s ex-wife), among others.\n\nMilestone Alert!
