        "text": "IT'S OVER\n\nUPDATE: Elizabeth's rumored cheating partner, married father and cricket player Shane Warne, has addressed his status on his blog:\n\nSadly and unfortunately, Simone and I split up a while ago, our close friends and family were informed at that time. It is a private matter so we did not make it public. We remain friends and will continue to be good parents.\n\nPREVIOUSLY: Elizabeth Hurley has confirmed that she and her husband of three years, Indian textile heir Arun Nayar, have separated.\n\n\"Not a great day. For the record, my husband Arun & I separated a few months ago. Our close family & friends were aware of this,\" she tweeted on Sunday.\n\nElizabeth's announcement comes amid a News of the World report that she spent the night at a London hotel with Australian cricket player Shane Warne.\n\nThe actress has an eight-year-old son with Steve Bing and previously dated Hugh Grant for 13 years. Earlier this year she said that Hugh is \"still my number one\" because there are parts of her life Arun does not understand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom Our Partner"
