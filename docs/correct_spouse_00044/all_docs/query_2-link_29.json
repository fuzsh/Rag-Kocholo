        "text": "The window that was at least partially kept open since late last year has officially been closed.\n\nElizabeth Hurley has filed for divorce from husband Arun Nayar. The couple, who wed in 2007, have been separated since December, when rumors linked Hurley to Australian cricket star Shane Warne.\n\nThe gossip spurred Hurley to confirm the separation via Twitter:\n\n\"For the record, my husband Arun & I separated a few months ago. Our close family & friends were aware of this.\"\n\nThe actress has cited \"unreasonable behavior\" as the impetus behind the divorce.\n\nNayar is the heir to an Indian textile fortune. Hurley most recently began work on David E. Kelley's \"Wonder Woman\" series, playing the role of primary villain Veronica Cale."
