        "text": "The couple were married on Friday in a private civil ceremony at Sudeley Castle in Winchcombe, 125 miles west of London.\n\nThey held a blessing and party at the castle Saturday evening, with guests including Elton John, Kate Moss, Elle Macpherson and Hurley’s ex, Hugh Grant.\n\nThe couple’s Indian friends hosting the parties in Mumbai were tight-lipped about other events, but the Indian Express newspaper published details of planned festivities.\n\nThe newspaper quoted guests saying a “haldi” ceremony followed by a black-tie dinner earlier scheduled for yesterday was shifted to late today. The function will be hosted by Parmeshwar Godrej, wife of well-known Indian industrialist Adi Godrej, at their beach-front home in suburban Mumbai.\n\nIndian weddings include a traditional “haldi”, or turmeric ceremony, in which the bride and groom are covered in a paste of turmeric, milk and cream believed to cleanse and beautify them.\n\nThe couple arrived in Mumbai early yesterday to begin six days of celebrations, which will end with a ceremony at Umaid Bhavan Palace, the Maharaja of Jodphur’s palace-turned-luxury resort in the state of Rajasthan in western India."
