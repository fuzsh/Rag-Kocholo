        "text": "Agencies/London\n\nActress Liz Hurley’s four-year marriage to Indian businessman Arun Nayar ended in divorce yesterday amid continued speculation about her romance with Australian cricketer Shane Warne.\n\nHurley and textile tycoon Nayar were granted a divorce at a London court, although neither of them attended the hearing.\n\nThe judge held that the marriage had ‘broken down irretrievably’ and would be dissolved within six weeks\n\nThe couple married in March, 2007, in a star-studded ceremony at Sudeley Castle in southwest England, and had a second traditional Hindu ceremony at a palace in Jodhpur, northwest India.\n\nHurley, 46, revealed in December that she had split from Nayar, telling her followers on microblogging site Twitter: “For the record, my husband Arun and I separated a few months ago.”\n\nIt came after photographs were published of the actress and Warne apparently kissing and cuddling together in London.\n\nFollowing the pictures’ publication, both Hurley and Warne hastily issued statements revealing that their respective marriages had been over for some time.\n\nThe cricketer, 41, reportedly met Hurley at an English race meeting in July last year and the pair have since been spotted together on several occasions.\n\nMeanwhile, Nayar has been dating model Kim Johnson.\n\nHurley was photographed cheering on Warne at an Indian Premier League match in northwest India in April. Warne’s romances have sparked almost as much media attention as his performance in cricket matches and his energetic love life is widely thought to have cost him the Australian captaincy.\n\nHe brought the curtain down on his two-decade career at an Indian Premier League match last month, several years after he retired from international cricket.\n\nHurley and actor Hugh Grant were one of Britain’s leading celebrity couples in the 1990s but separated in 2000."
