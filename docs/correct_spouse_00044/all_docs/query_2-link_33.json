        "text": "Elizabeth Hurley and her husband, Arun Nayar, arrived in Mumbai, India, Monday to kick off the next leg of their nuptial celebrations – six days of traditional Indian festivities that will culminate in a ceremony at a lavish palace.\n\nPhotographers snapped shots of Hurley and Nayar arriving at Mumbai’s airport from London early Monday.\n\nThe couple were married Friday in a private civil ceremony at Sudeley Castle in Winchcombe, 125 miles west of London. They held a blessing and party at the castle Saturday evening, with guests including Elton John, Kate Moss, Elle Macpherson and Hurley’s ex, Hugh Grant.\n\nHurley, 41, and Nayar, 42, have been tightlipped about their plans that likely will include a traditional “haldi” or turmeric ceremony, where bride and groom are covered in a paste of turmeric, milk and cream to cleanse and beautify the couple.\n\nThe ceremony will be hosted by family friend Parmeshwar Godrej, wife of well-known Indian industrialist Adi Godrej, the Times of India newspaper reported.\n\nGodrej told the newspaper that the ceremony would be held in Mumbai on Monday and attended by a small group of close associates. It would be followed by a formal dinner.\n\nIn Indian marriage ceremonies, haldi or turmeric is applied to the bride’s face, hands and legs and dabbed on the groom’s face. Elder family members and friends then bless the couple with wishes for a happy married life.\n\nWedding celebrations will continue Wednesday through Saturday in the city of Jodhpur at Umaid Bhavan Palace.\n\nHurley and Nayar are also expected to attend a “mehendi” ceremony where intricate henna designs are applied on the bride’s hands a day before the lavish reception at the palace on Saturday.\n\nThe British actress made appearances in the “Austin Powers” movies and “Bedazzled.”\n\nRadcliffe renews role\n\nDaniel Radcliffe has signed on to star in the final two “Harry Potter” films, Warner Bros. said Monday.\n\nRadcliffe, who plays the bespectacled schoolboy wizard in the Hollywood adaptations of J.K. Rowling’s novels, will reprise the role in “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince” and “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.”\n\nWarner Bros. will release the fifth installment – “Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix” – on July 13, a week before the book “The Deathly Hallows” is released. The show dates for the last two movies haven’t been announced.\n\nSpringer’s got talent\n\nJerry Springer is taking on another TV show.\n\n“The Jerry Springer Show” host and “Dancing with the Stars” alum will be the new frontman of “America’s Got Talent,” NBC’s Craig Plestis announced Monday.\n\nSpringer is “the perfect ringmaster” for the TV talent competition, Plestis said in a statement. “To say the least, he is known for presiding over an unpredictable show where the unexpected is the typical order of each day.”\n\nSpringer has hosted “The Jerry Springer Show” for 16 years.\n\n“I’ve been around some of America’s most talented individuals on my talk show,” he said, “so I’ll feel right at home hosting `America’s Got Talent.”‘\n\nAnother year older\n\nTV personality Ed McMahon, 84 … Actor Ben Murphy, 65 … Singer Mary Wilson of The Supremes, 63 … Drummer Hugh Grundy of The Zombies, 62 … Singer-guitarist David Gilmour of Pink Floyd, 61 … Actor-director Rob Reiner, 60 … Actor Tom Arnold, 48 Rapper Bubba Sparxxx, 30.\n\n– Edited by Austin Lewis"
