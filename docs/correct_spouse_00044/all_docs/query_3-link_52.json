I had no idea he was with her in London,\" she said.\n\n\"I remember getting up in the morning, turning on the computer and seeing those photos.\n\n\"I was shocked and embarrassed for the children because it was so public and this was just before the holidays. It ruined our Christmas.\n\n\"Shane is a little kid, like Peter Pan, and he doesn't think about how his actions will impact other people.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n\"You would think that a mother like Liz Hurley would be more mature and respectful of my kids, but she wasn't.\n\n\"I don't believe in hatred and Â­bitterness but I do believe karma will make things right in the end.\"\n\nCallahan broke her silence and told how his romance with Hurley caused her pain.\n\nShe was upset that Warne had invited Hurley to their family home.\n\n\"I know we were still together when Shane first met Liz because he called me from London that summer and told me he had spoken to her at the Goodwood races,\" Callahan claimed.\n\nMORE ON:\n\nElizabeth Hurley\n\n27 Craziest Celebrity Bedroom Confessions\n\nLove Scandals: 30 Celebrities Who Faced Relationship Dramas Off-Screen\n\nElizabeth Hurley's Son Damian Goes Out For Wild Night & Ends Up Kissing A Woman, Days After Being Cut Out Of $250 Million Inheritance\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n\"I thought it was funny because we had watched her in the Austin Powers movie with the children and we all thought it was hilarious.\n\n\"Also, I've known Shane for years and she is this big movie star, so it was odd to think that he was hanging out with her.\n\n\"I remember him saying, 'I've met this girl and she is really beautiful.'\"\n\nShane insists nothing had happened at that point but Simone says: \"I don't know if he is telling the truth because I had lost trust in him by that point.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n\"Also, I was on the other side of the world.\"\n\nHurley got engaged to Warne in 2011 after divorcing husband Arun Nayar.\n\nThe sexy star, who had a son by onetime beau Steve Bing, reportedly split from Warne in 2013.\n\nWe pay for juicy info!
