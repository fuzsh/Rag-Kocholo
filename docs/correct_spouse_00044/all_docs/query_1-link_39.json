        "text": "Actress Elizabeth Hurley's four-year marriage to businessman Arun Nayar ended in divorce at a 92-second court hearing today.\n\nThe couple were granted a decree nisi by District Judge Penny Cushing at the Principal Registry of the High Court's Family Division in London.\n\nJudge Cushing ruled that Hurley was entitled to a divorce because the marriage had broken down due to Mr Nayar's \"unreasonable behaviour\".\n\nCourt papers said the judge \"held that the respondent (Mr Nayar) has behaved in such a way that the petitioner (Hurley) cannot be reasonably expected to live with the respondent\".\n\nPaperwork showed that Hurley and Mr Nayar had agreed to share the costs of the divorce.\n\nHurley and Mr Nayar were number 17 on a list of 28 couples granted divorce orders by the judge today.\n\nThe judge approved each order as a court official read down the list of names.\n\nNeither Hurley, 46, nor Mr Nayar, who is also in his mid-40s, was at the hearing.\n\nHurley, who listed her address in paperwork as Redcliffe Road, London, SW10, and her occupation as \"actress/model and businesswoman\", married the Indian textile heir in March 2007, when she was 41 and he was 42.\n\nThe couple wed at Sudely Castle, near Winchcombe, Gloucestershire - and had a traditional Hindu wedding at Umaid Bhawan Palace in Jodhpur, India.\n\nThe ceremonies were attended by numerous celebrities, including Sir Elton John, who gave the bride away.\n\nThe judge held that the marriage had \"broken down irretrievably\" and would be dissolved within six weeks.\n\nHurley had answered a question on a form which asked what \"effect\" her husband's unreasonable behaviour night have had on her health as \"N/A\" (not applicable).\n\nIn December last year, Hurley, who has been linked to former Australian Test cricketer Shane Warne, announced on her internet Twitter page that she and her husband had separated several months earlier.\n\n\"Painful sad days,\" she wrote. \"Arun & I separated for private reasons but... he has been a great father to our son Damian & will always be in his life.\"\n\nShe added: \"No-one is fighting over money and I have no plans to go to Australia.\""
