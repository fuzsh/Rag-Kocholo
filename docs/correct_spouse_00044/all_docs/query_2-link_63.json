        "text": "British actress Elizabeth Hurley may lose a major chunk of her 13 million pound fortune to her husband Arun Nayar if they divorce as the couple did not sign a pre-nuptial agreement before their lavish wedding in 2007.\n\nThough Nayar is a businessman, it is believed that Hurley, who announced that she separated from Nayar months ago, is richer than her husband and the absense of a pre-nuptial agreement means that Nayar could claim for a piece of her money, the Daily Mail reported.\n\nFormer model announced the breakdown of her three-year-old marriage to the Indian tycoon after she was caught kissing Australian cricketer Shane Warne, who is said to be her latest flame.\n\n\"A pre-nup would have been a deal-breaker for Arun. He has his pride,\" a source told the newspaper.\n\nHurley thanked her fans for their support on her twitter page, saying : \"Painful, sad days. Arun & I separated for private reasons but FTR he has been a great father to our son Damian & will always be in his life (sic).\"\n\nWarne too confirmed his single status on his website.\n\nHurley has invested most of her fortune into property.\n\nShe is the sole owner of the sprawling 4.3 million pound farmhouse where she and Nayar live in Gloucestershire, and her 2.5 million pound Chelsea townhouse is still jointly owned by her and her ex-boyfriend Hugh Grant.\n\nAlthough Nayar comes from a wealthy family in India, analysis of his finances suggests much is dependent on future inheritance.\n\nHe has declined to comment on the breakdown of his marriage."
