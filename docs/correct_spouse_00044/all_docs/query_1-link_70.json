I've always had a much, much bigger female fan base than male. It probably seems like I've had so many knocks, as well as good luck, that it means women are friendly to me.\"\n\nThe 44-year-old British star - who now runs a 400-acre farm in the UK with her husband and has brought out a range of health snacks - also admits she is often difficult to work with because she thrives best under pressure.\n\nShe told magazine: \"I'm probably not the best person to have shrinking violets around me. We all have to work extremely hard. It's hopeless if someone can't take it. I thrive under pressure and am less good if it's calm. I don't like serene atmospheres and go demented if I'm in a spa for too long where everyone whispers.\"\n\nDespite this, Elizabeth says Arun manages to put up with her because he is successful in his own right.\n\nShe said: \"Arun is astonishingly good-natured and would be the last man on earth to feel overshadowed by me. He's thoroughly comfortable in his own skin and I don't think he'd swap places with anyone.\"\n\nBang Showbiz"
