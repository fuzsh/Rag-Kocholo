Members of the toddler and baby club dressed up as brides to sell cakes in the high street.\n\nThe couple were married on Friday in a civil ceremony and held a church service at the castle last night. Shops put up balloons and signs to wish the newlyweds well. Security guards surrounded a marquee in the castle's grounds as celebrities, including Sir Elton John and Donatella Versace, were expected to arrive. The couple fly to India this week to continue their celebrations."
