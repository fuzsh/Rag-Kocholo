        "text": "Elizabeth Hurley and her husband, Arun Nayar, arrived Monday to kick off the next leg of their nuptial celebrations â€” six days of traditional Indian festivities that will culminate in a ceremony at a lavish palace.\n\nPhotographers snapped shots of Hurley and Nayar arriving at Mumbai's airport from London early Monday.\n\nThe couple were married Friday in a private civil ceremony at Sudeley Castle in Winchcombe, 125 miles west of London. They held a blessing and party at the castle Saturday evening, with guests including Elton John, Kate Moss, Elle Macpherson and Hurley's ex, Hugh Grant.\n\nHurley, 41, and Nayar, 42, have been tightlipped about their plans that likely will include a traditional \"haldi\" or turmeric ceremony, where bride and groom are covered in a paste of turmeric, milk and cream to cleanse and beautify the couple.\n\nThe ceremony will be hosted by family friend Parmeshwar Godrej, wife of well-known Indian industrialist Adi Godrej, the Times of India newspaper reported.\n\nGodrej told the newspaper that the ceremony would be held in Mumbai on Monday and attended by a small group of close associates. It would be followed by a formal dinner.\n\nIn Indian marriage ceremonies, haldi or turmeric is applied to the bride's face, hands and legs and dabbed on the groom's face. Elder family members and friends then bless the couple with wishes for a happy married life.\n\nWedding celebrations will continue Wednesday through Saturday in the city of Jodhpur at Umaid Bhavan Palace.\n\nHurley and Nayar are also expected to attend a \"mehendi\" ceremony where intricate henna designs are applied on the bride's hands a day before the lavish reception at the palace on Saturday.\n\nThe British actress made appearances in the \"Austin Powers\" movies and \"Bedazzled\" and for several years was the international face of Estee Lauder cosmetics."
