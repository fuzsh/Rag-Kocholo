        "text": "Elizabeth Hurley has announced the end of her three year marriage to Arun Nayar amid reports of an affair with Australian cricketer Shane Warne. On Sunday, the News of the World alleged that the 45-year-old model had become involved with Victoria-born Shane, purporting to have pictures and videos of the couple embracing outside a London restaurant.The tabloid newspaper also claimed that the pair – who first met at the Goodwood races in July (pictured below)– spent two nights together in the sportsman's hotel suite last week.And later that same day, Elizabeth seemingly responded to the news on her Twitter page.\n\n\"Not a great day,\" she wrote. \"For the record, my husband Arun and I separated a few months ago. \"Our close friends and family were aware of this. \"Elizabeth's representative has refused to comment on her friendship with Shane, 41, although the pair have been exchanging messages on Twitter in recent months – she has referred to him as 'angel' in some posts, visible to both her 35,000 followers, and his.\n\nElizabeth – mum to eight-year-old Damian with ex Steve Bing - and Arun started dating in 2003 and married in March 2007 in Gloucestershire.Days later, they held a week-long celebration in Jodhpur, which included a Hindu wedding ceremony.Shane – who flew back to Australia on Sunday – is divorced from the mother of his three children.Known to be a bit of a ladies' man, he was stripped of his Australian vice-captaincy after a text message scandal, and split from wife Simone in 2005 following reports of extra marital affairs. They divorced in 2007, but briefly reunited again in 2009, and have lived together in Melbourne since then.Writing on his website under the title 'Clarification' on Monday, Shane said: \"Sadly and unfortunately, Simone and I split up a while ago; our close friends were informed at that time. \"It’s a private matter so we did not make it public. We remain friends and continue to be good parents.\"\n\nSign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage\n\nEmail Address\n\nBy entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
