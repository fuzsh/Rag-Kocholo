        "text": "British actress and model Elizabeth Hurley says she has separated from her Indian husband of three years, Arun Nayar.\n\nHurley's announcement on her Twitter account comes amid reports in British tabloids linking her romantically to Australian cricket star Shane Warne. Warne on Monday confirmed he has also split from his wife.\n\nâ€œNot a great day,â€ Hurley, 45, tweeted Sunday. â€œFor the record, my husband Arun & I separated a few months ago.â€\n\nThe couple married in 2007 at a castle outside of London. They followed up the private civil ceremony with a lavish and traditional Hindi wedding in Jodphur, India.\n\nHurley, 45, dated actor Hugh Grant for more than a decade and has an 8-year-old son, Damian, from a relationship with film producer Steve Bing."
