        "text": "The couple are also expected to celebrate in India\n\nActress and model Elizabeth Hurley has been celebrating her marriage to Indian businessman Arun Nayar in a lavish ceremony in the Cotswolds.\n\nThe couple married \"in a private ceremony\" on Friday, a spokesman for Gloucestershire county council said.\n\nCelebrity guests including Sir Elton John, supermodel Elle Macpherson and artist Tracey Emin attended the blessing and party at Sudeley Castle.\n\nThe bride arrived on Saturday morning, followed by her bridegroom at 1530 GMT.\n\nA tracksuit-clad Sir Elton arrived in a purple helicopter, while his partner David Furnish and actress Patsy Kensit arrived by car.\n\nArun Nayar arrived in a blue Bentley\n\nFashion designer Donatella Versace and footballer David Beckham were also rumoured to be among the guests.\n\nMs Hurley, 41, and Mr Nayar, 42, have reportedly sold the exclusive rights for the celebration to Hello! magazine.\n\nSecurity guards have been surrounding a large marquee in the castle grounds.\n\nA covered walkway has been erected from the gardens into the castle, presumably to keep Ms Hurley out of the view of the paparazzi.\n\nThe civil ceremony on Friday took place in a licensed room in the castle.\n\nSaturday's celebrations began with a church service.\n\nLocal butcher Colin Pilcher also wishes the couple well\n\nShop and restaurant owners in nearby Winchcombe have been displaying good luck signs for the couple.\n\nHairdresser Rachel Jones, who owns the Cat's Whiskers salon, said the town was \"overwhelmed with excitement\".\n\nShe said she had been \"on the lookout\" for actor Hugh Grant - an ex-boyfriend of Ms Hurley.\n\n\"There are rumours his car has been seen in the village,\" she added.\n\nThe Rev John Partington, vicar for Winchcombe, said he \"would be officiating at the celebration of the wedding\".\n\nSudeley Castle belongs to the family of Ms Hurley's close friend, Henry Dent-Brocklehurst, who is godfather to her four-year-old son, Damian.\n\nMs Hurley and Mr Nayar are thought to be planning to fly to India for a second celebration after their wedding party in England."
