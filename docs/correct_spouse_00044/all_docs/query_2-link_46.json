He married wife Anna Elisabet Eberstein in 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, businessman Nayar was also pictured at the event, which saw Elizabeth sporting a glittering green number.\n\nThe Gossip Girl actress was married to Nayar from 2007 until 2011, and she once described the split as “the most amicable divorce in the world”.\n\nShe shares son Damian with ex-partner Steve Bing, an American businessman.\n\nIn 2017, Elizabeth told the Mail On Sunday’s You magazine: “Hugh and Arun are very important in our lives.”"
