Friends say he is like Hugh Grant in that he loves to party and flirt, loves women and fast cars and is very charming, but more down to earth than all her previous friends and that she seems very happy with him.\n\n<img border='0' alt='image'src=http://lifestyle.t-online.de/life/peop/top-/pi/pi-liz_2Barun-kostuem,property=Grossbild.jpg>\n\nNayar with his ex-wife\n\n<img border='0' alt='image'src=http://lifestyle.t-online.de/life/peop/fs/fp/lm/liz-/fp-liz-hurley2,property=thumbnail.jpg>\n\nWhose hand???\n\nThis story on Yahoo India was more negative than the magazines:\n\nLiz Hurley's charming new lover is, alas, married\n\nWashington, Jan 28 (ANI Hollywood star Liz Hurley must be heart-broken as it has been revealed that her charming new lover Arun Nayar is married to an Italian model and has no plans to divorce.\n\nModel wife Valentina Pedroni's father claimed that the pair were still married and had no plans to divorce. \"There is no question of separation or divorce. He runs around with all sorts of women. He likes a good social life, but he is a great guy who has worked hard to build up a business. We are really proud of him\", Giovanni Pedroni said.\n\n\"Though the rumours about Arun and Liz are talk of the town, nobody is really surprised. He is a playboy, part of the jet-set. And the kind of guy who is so good looking and charming, he could sweep a film star off her feet\", a close friend of Arun was quoted by the website peoplenews.com as saying.\n\nThe new love in Hurley's life was revealed by her last week at the Christian Dior fashion show in Paris. The two clearly were together as they held hands and looked close. (ANI)\n\nLet's see if he wins TFS approval. :mrred:"
