        "text": "Elizabeth Hurley is to get a quickie divorce from her husband Arun Nayar.\n\nThe British actress-and-model - who announced at the weekend she had split from the Indian businessman \"months ago\" following claims she is romancing Australian cricket legend Shane Warne - is said to have already had the details of her divorce settlement drawn up.\n\nDespite neither party having signed a prenuptial agreement, they are both believed to be happy not to share each other's fortunes, with Elizabeth reputedly worth Â£13 million.\n\nAn insider explained: \"There will be an amicable settlement with no party giving out large portions of money. Liz doesn't want Arun's money, and neither is Arun interested in her wealth.\"\n\nHowever, the textile tycoon's family are said to be \"glad\" the pair have parted ways after the photos emerged of Elizabeth kissing Shane.\n\nThe source added to The Sun newspaper: \"Liz never mentioned she was seeing anybody when she met her in-laws in October. The family is actually glad they have separated.\"\n\nThe 45-year-old star praised her estranged spouse for being a \"great father\" to her eight-year-old son Damian, the child of her former lover Steve Bing.\n\nShe tweeted: \"Painful, sad days. Arun & I separated for private reasons but FTR (for the record) he has been a great father to our son Damian & will always be in his life. (sic)\"\n\n- BANG! Showbiz"
