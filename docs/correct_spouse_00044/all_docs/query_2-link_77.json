        "text": "So I thought it would be cute to use some older photos of Liz Hurley and Hugh Grant to illustrate this story about how Liz homewrecked her own marriage to Arun Nayar, and how Hugh Grant has already âstopped byâ Lizâs house to pay his respects (with his dong). Anyway, as I was looking through the old photos, I was transported to a time when they were a seriously hot couple. The photo of Hughâs hand on Lizâs leather-clad ass is my favorite, I think. Anyway, yes, Hugh has stopped by, and Liz has already done a round of post-split photo ops (see here at The Mail) – and surprisingly enough, the British tabloids arenât really smearing her. Yet. Probably because they know sheâs good for scandal, and because everyone secretly wants her back with Hugh anyway.\n\nThere are some new developments in Liz and Arunâs marriage drama. According to British sources, they are set to do a âquickie divorceâ and neither Liz nor Arun will be asking for financial support from the other. Arunâs family has allegedly cut off Arun for the most part, so Liz walks away from the marriage with more money, maybe. A source says: â’It will be an amicable settlement with no party giving out large portions of money to anybody. Liz doesnât want Arunâs money and neither is Arun interested in her wealth.â Also: apparently, Liz called the Nayar family in India to personally apologize for being a dirty whore with the Australian Paris Hilton, Shane Warne. Another source says: â’Liz was very matter-of-fact. She just said that there are certain irreparable differences between her and Arun and that she intends to separate from him. She also said that sheâs sorry.â Iâm sure that call was AMAZING. Anyway, the American tabloids are getting into it too – Us Weekly has a report that Lizâs âwe separated months agoâ story wasnât the whole truth:\n\nElizabeth Hurley’s marital drama isn’t quite over yet. After the model-turned-actress, 45, was photographed kissing Australian cricket player Shane Warne, 41, she Tweeted that she and businessman hubby of three years Arun Nayar had “separated a few months ago.” (Warne made a similar announcement about his marriage shortly after.)\n\nBut a source tells UsMagazine.com the split wasn’t exactly that clean.\n\n“They had been having marriage problems for some time, but Arun wasn’t prepared to give up so easily,” says the insider. “Liz, on the other hand, gave up and didn’t tell her husband. Instead she went out and found someone else and then broke the news to him. He is gutted.”\n\nBehind the breakup? “He wanted children so badly,” says the insider, while Hurley, who had son Damian with Steve Bing in 2002, “didn’t want to go through the pain of IVF. Liz doesn’t compromise, everything was her way or no way.”\n\nNow, says the source, Nayar is scared he won’t be able to see Hurley’s son. “He doesn’t want to lose Damian,” says the insider. “They are so close — he is ‘Daddy’ to Damian. And he’s embarrassed that his marriage fell apart so publicly. He feels Liz intentionally humiliated him.”\n\nAs for Hurley’s new romance, “It’s a rebound,” sniffs the insider. “They’ll be over before you know it.”\n\n[From Us Weekly]\n\nOf course Liz and Shane have to be over soon. Liz and Hugh FOREVER. But seriously, as I was looking through the old photos, there are so many of Hugh and Liz hanging out post-breakup (their breakup), and lots of Hugh hanging out with Damien, his godson. THIS is why Hugh hasnât been able to âsettle downâ with a woman since Liz (although he did last a while with Liz-lookalike Jemima Khan). Because he and Liz still live in each otherâs pockets, so to speak. Another way to say it? Theyâre still stuck up each otherâs asses."
