        "text": "Elizabeth Hurley rocked in the New Year with a very surprising friend by her side and it shows just how well they get along over a decade after their divorce. The 58-year-old actress shared a celebratory — and rather cozy moment — with her ex-husband, Arun Nayar, which was captured on camera by her son, Damian Hurley, 21.\n\nWearing a multi-colored sequin minidress, Hurley showed off her toned legs as she sat cheek-to-cheek with the textile entrepreneur. She accessorized her festive look with metallic heels, a smoky eye, and her long brunette locks in soft waves framing her face. Nayar looked dapper in his expertly tailored black suit with a crisp white shirt underneath and a watch peeking out from his jacket. Hurley raised her air in the air as her ex leaned in close to her. Damian captioned the Instagram Story snapshot, “Mama & Daddy.”\n\nMore from SheKnows\n\nCardi B and Offset's NYE Bash Offers a Fresh Take on Relationship Endings\n\nThe couple was married from 2007 until 2011, and while that may seem like a short time, Hurley’s son has always looked at Nayar as his dad. Damian’s biological father was film producer Steve Bing, who tried to deny paternity of his son until a DNA test confirmed his as the father. Even though he paid child support, he was largely out of Damian’s life until his death by suicide in 2020.\n\nHurley has often shared how important Nayar was to her son over the years because he stepped up as a father figure when Damian needed him the most. “Arun was his father figure. Arun still calls him son and Damian calls him Dad,” she told The Times in 2022. It’s wonderful to see that years later Nayar and Damian’s father-son bond is as strong as ever after the heartbreak of Bing’s absence and his subsequent death.\n\nDamian opened up about the loss of his biological father in 2021, sharing that it was “devastating news” despite their lack of a relationship. “I didn’t realise at the time quite how much it would affect me… We all like to show ‘perfect’ versions of our lives- for me, the idea of publicly discussing something as personal as grief is terrifying… but sometimes it’s necessary,” he wrote on Instagram. “The last year has been bloody hard- for everyone on the planet- and I think acknowledging that is vital. It’s not weak to struggle. In fact, to get through to the other side is immensely strong.”\n\nBefore you go, click here to see celebrity exes who will always be friends.\n\nBest of SheKnows\n\n38 Celebrities You Didn’t Know Were Related to Each Other\n\nAll the Celebrities Who Got Engaged in 2023\n\nAll the Celebrities Who Got Married in 2023"
