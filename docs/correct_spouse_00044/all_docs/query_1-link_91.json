The divorce decree was granted at a brief hearing in London Wednesday by District Judge Penny Cushing. Neither Hurley nor Nayar was in court to hear their names read out along with those of 27 other divorcing couples. The grounds given for the divorce was Nayar's \"unreasonable behavior.\" The British actress and Indian businessman married in 2007 at an English castle, with singer Elton John giving the bride away. They followed up the private civil ceremony with a lavish and traditional Hindu wedding in Jodphur, India. Hurley announced last December that the couple had separated. She has since been romantically linked to Australian cricket star Shane Warne. Hurley, 46-years old, dated actor Hugh Grant for more than a decade and has a nine-year-old son, Damian, from a relationship with film producer Steve Bing.",
