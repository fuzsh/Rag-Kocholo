        "text": "James Martin was in a relationship with Louise Davies for over a decade before they made the decision to part ways in December 2023.\n\nThe celebrity chef, 51, and the TV producer, 47, started seeing each other after meeting on the set of Celebrity Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? over a decade ago. James and Louise, who still remain good friends after their recent breakup, lived together in Hampshire but never tied the knot.\n\nAlthough it hasn't been confirmed why the duo decided to go their separate ways, James previously discussed why they never married. In a blunt interview from a few years back, the Saturday Morning with James Martin star explained marriage \"doesn't interest me in the slightest.\"\n\nHe said to Sunday People at the time: \"No, it doesn't interest me in the slightest, mainly because I've catered for so many weddings, really. I admire people who do it, that's fine, but I'm quite happy. I don't need to spend 60 grand on a day, no, I'm more than happy thanks.\"\n\nThe chef also said he would rather spend his money on adding cars to his lavish collection than spend it on a wedding. James said: \"My mates come round to my house and they look into my garage and I go, 'These are my babies, these are my things,' but you know, it's each to their own, isn't it?\"\n\nIn another interview, the star also explained why he and Louise didn't start a family. He admitted it was because he was \"so focused on work\", and it was the \"biggest low\" missing out on being a dad. \"The biggest low of my career is that I've given up everything for it,\" he told Prima magazine back in 2020.\n\nHowever, James had no regrets, even though his friends were \"all married with kids\", as he acknowledged just how hard being a parent is. \"The level of commitment it requires and the choices you have to make have a huge impact,\" he admitted. Meanwhile, it was recently reported that James moved on from Louise with Kim Johnson - a personal trainer.\n\nThey were seen looking at watches in a shop in Mayfair, London, on Saturday. Kim was once married to businessman Arun Nayar - who was also formerly married to Elizabeth Hurley. Kim and Arun started dating after he split from actress Elizabeth in 2011. They tied the knot in 2016 but divorced one year later."
