The couple lived in a south Mumbai apartment.\n\nNayar and HurleyÂ have been romantically involved for nearly three years and are often seen at parties and fundraisers in Britain and the United States and holidaying in India.\n\nHurley, mother of three-year-old Damian by former movie producer Steve Bing, is reported to be learning Hindi."
