        "text": "There are some juicy rumors swirling about Elizabeth Hurleyâs marriage to Indian billionaire Arun Nayar. After a particularly nasty wedding, the pair has barely been married for two years. Some of the coupleâs closest friends are already wondering aloud if theyâll make it through a third year. The Sunday Telegraphâs gossip guy “Mandrake” is reporting that Liz has “made no effort to deny the claims” and the official word from Hurleyâs spokesperson is “no comment” rather than “those rumors have no basis”. Hereâs more from The Sunday Telegraph:\n\nElizabeth Hurley has been phenomenally busy since she married Arun Nayar in 2007.\n\nWith a swimwear and gift company, an organic farm in Gloucestershire and her various television and modelling commitments, she has sometimes been unable to spend as much time with her husband as she might have liked. Now, friends of the 43-year-old actress have expressed their concern that all may not be well in the couple’s marriage.\n\nLast night, there was even speculation that they may be about to announce their separation. Surprisingly, perhaps, when Mandrake contacted Miss Hurley’s spokesman to ask her about the rumours, she made no effort to deny the claims. After a long pause, the spokesman said there would be no comment.\n\nThe couple, who married in two lavish ceremonies, at Sudeley Castle and in India, have been together since 2002. Miss Hurley has a six-year-old son, Damian, from a brief relationship with the American businessman Steve Bing.\n\nHowever, she has no children with Nayar and has made no secret of the fact that she yearns for a baby. He had no children with his first wife, the Italian model Valentina Pedroni.\n\nHugh Grant, who courted Miss Hurley for 13 years, is a godfather to Damian. Somewhat unusually, the actor accompanied the model and her husband as they cruised around the Mediterranean last year.\n\nFrom The Sunday Telegraph\n\nAs far as Liz âyearningâ for a baby with Nayar, Iâm sort of disbelieving. I realize that there are so many breakthroughs in fertility treatments, and when all else fails, people with those kinds of means can adopt. But Nayar knew he was marrying a woman in her forties, so why this shock that they havenât been able to conceive thus far? Of course, the other explanation is that they arenât trying to have a child, and simply like their lives as is.\n\nAt this point, I would enjoy seeing Hugh Grant and Liz Hurley get back together. I really think they made each other happy, and the revelation that Hugh came along on Liz and Nayarâs vacation cracked me up. Nayar sounds like a very understanding husband. His family was right, he could do better."
