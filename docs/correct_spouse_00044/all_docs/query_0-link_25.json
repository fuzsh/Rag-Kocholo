Our close family and friends were aware of this,” she wrote.\n\nIt was the first marriage for the actress, who was previously in a long-term relationship with actor Hugh Grant, and gained attention for standing by her man in 1995 when he was caught with a prostitute in Los Angeles. The two split in 2000 after 13 years together but remain friends.\n\nThe Estee Lauder model also has a son, now aged nine, from her brief relationship with American financier Steve Bing."
