        "text": "Elizabeth Hurley, who married longtime boyfriend Arun Nayar in 2007, tried to do damage control on a tabloid report claiming she'd spent the night with cricketer Shane Warne by tweeting on Sunday that she and husband had separated a few months ago. (A version of this tactic was also recently employed by David Arquette during his split from Courteney Cox.)\n\n\"Not a great day,\" she tweeted Sunday, after the publication of photos in the News of the World showing the Hurley and Warne kissing. But she also insisted that \"our close family & friends\" were aware of Hurley's separation from Nayar, the heir to an Indian textile empire."
