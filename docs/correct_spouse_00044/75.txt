London - British actress and model Elizabeth Hurley's four-year marriage to Indian businessman Arun Nayar ended in divorce on Wednesday.

The couple was granted the divorce by a district judge at the High Court's Family Division in London, according to the Press Association.

Hurley, 46, married the textile heir at Sudeley Castle in western England in 2007 and had a traditional Hindu wedding in Jodhpur, India.

Elizabeth announced in December 2010 she had split from husband Nayar "several months ago" after she was romantically linked with former Australian cricket star Shane Warne.
