Vinod Nayar, Indian textile tycoon and former father-in-law of Elizabeth Hurley, says that the model-actress ruined his marriage.

The extravagant, ill-fated 2007 wedding between Hurley and Arun is one of the reasons Vinod, 71, broke up with his British-born wife Joan, 60, reported Daily Mail online. The tycoon said that Joan attempted to profit from her stepson's high-profile romance and glittering wedding.

In a divorce petition, he accuses Joan of selling an interview about the pair, appearing on TV to discuss the relationship and signing as an ambassador for a luxury jewellery brand.

London: Vinod Nayar, Indian textile tycoon and former father-in-law of Elizabeth Hurley, says that the model-actress ruined his marriage.

The extravagant, ill-fated 2007 wedding between Hurley and Arun is one of the reasons Vinod, 71, broke up with his British-born wife Joan, 60, reported Daily Mail online.

The tycoon said that Joan attempted to profit from her stepson's high-profile romance and glittering wedding.

In a divorce petition, he accuses Joan of selling an interview about the pair, appearing on TV to discuss the relationship and signing as an ambassador for a luxury jewellery brand.

The tycoon said that his wife's behaviour indicated her "money-minded nature".

Nayar claims that his wife's behaviour angered Hurley, who is now dating Australian cricketer Shane Warne.

Because of her 'behaviour', Hurley did not want Joan at the British part of the couple's wedding or at the second traditional Indian part of the nuptials, held in Jodhpur.

He also said that the frostiness over the interviews about the wedding, "split the family relationship and things went sour".

He also accused his estranged wife of deliberately trying to mortify him and his family by selling a story to a UK tabloid in 2010.
