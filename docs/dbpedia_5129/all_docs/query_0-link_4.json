        "text": "You may be new to the concept, but particles are a part of the Korean language used every day. These Korean particles are found in nearly every sentence you’ll hear if not all!\n\nBut it’s essential to learn how to use them correctly. We’ll cover Korean particles for everyday use that you should learn to become a competent Korean speaker.\n\nHere is a free PDF guide that you can download and take with you:\n\nWe will get into some of the most important parts of Korean grammar that you’ll use regularly. If you don’t know how to read in Hangeul yet, then you can learn Korean here in under an hour. For some helpful resources on a Korean language study plan, go here.\n\nWhat are Korean Particles?\n\nKorean particles mainly function as markers in a sentence. These words help identify what a certain word’s role is in the sentence (whether it’s the topic or the object), and it also helps connect words to give a clearer meaning to what you want to say.\n\nKorean particles may come off as confusing initially, but these are essential in building sentences, which you’ll learn with enough practice!\n\nKorean Particles List\n\nThere are a great number of particles in the Korean language. However, you don’t need to know all of them immediately. You’ll only need the most common particles to get started.\n\nIn this section, we’ve listed the Korean subject-marking particle and object-marking particle alongside the other basic particles.\n\nType of ParticleKorean Particle topic markers은 (eun)\n\n는 (neun) subject particles이 (i)\n\n가 (ga) object particles을 (eul)\n\n를 (reul) location particles에 (e)\n\n에서 (eseo)\n\n으로 (euro)\n\n로 (ro)\n\n부터 (buteo)\n\n까지 (kkaji) linking particles과 (gwa)\n\n와 (wa)\n\n이랑 (irang)\n\n랑 (rang)\n\n하고 (hago)\n\n고 (go) plural particle들 (deul) possessive particle의 (eui)\n\nThe Different Korean Particles\n\nNow that you have some idea of what Korean particles are let’s learn more about the specific particles and their different uses.\n\nKorean Topic Markers\n\nThere are two Korean topic markers used in sentences. They function the same but are used depending on the last letter of the word that precedes them. We’ll learn all about them below.\n\n~은/는 (~ eun / neun | Topic)\n\n1. The ~은/는 (~eun / neun) markers are used to mark the topic in the sentence which is what you are going to talk about. These markers have the same meaning as “regarding ~” or “as for ~.”\n\nYou can use the topic marker 은 (eun) when the last syllable of the preceding noun ends in a consonant and the topic particle 는 (neun) when it ends in a vowel.\n\nFor example:\n\n나 (na) → 나는(naneun)\n\n선생님 (seonsaengnim) → 선생님은 (seonsaengnimeun)\n\nSample Sentences:\n\n나는 학생이에요 (naneun haksaengieyo)\n\nI am a student.\n\n나는 행복해요 (naneun haengbokhaeyo)\n\nI am happy.\n\n우리 선생님은 미국인이에요 (uri seonsaengnimeun migukinieyo)\n\nOur teacher is American.\n\n2. The topic particles ~은/는 (~eun / neun) are also used for comparing or contrasting two things.\n\nSample Sentences:\n\n어제는 더웠어요. 오늘은 추워요. (eojeneun deowosseoyo. oneureun chuwoyo)\n\nYesterday was hot. Today is cold.\n\n나는 커피를 마셨어요. 친구는 주스를 마셨어요. (naneun keopireul masyeosseoyo. chinguneun juseureul masyeosseoyo)\n\nI drank coffee. My friend drank juice.\n\nKorean Subject Particles\n\nThere are two Korean subject particles used in Korean sentences. Each subject particle is used depending on the last letter of the word that precedes them.\n\n~이/가 (~i / ga | Subject)\n\n1. 이 (i) and 가 (ga) are used as subject particles to mark the subject in the sentence. Both 이 (i) and 가 (ga) are added after the subject.\n\nThe difference between the two is that 이 (i) is a subject marking particle used when the preceding noun ends in a consonant, while the subject particle 가 (ga) is used when it ends in a vowel.\n\nSample sentences for each subject particle:\n\n가방이 무거워요 (gabangi mugeowoyo)\n\nThe bag is heavy.\n\n버스가 오고 있어요 (beoseuga ogo isseoyo)\n\nThe bus is coming.\n\n2. 이 (i) and 가 (ga) also focus on the subject of the sentence.\n\nSample sentences:\n\n누가 주문할 거예요? (nuga jumunhal geoyeyo)\n\nWho is going to order?\n\n내가 주문을 할게요 (naega jumuneul halgeyo)\n\nI will place the order.\n\n누가 아파요? (nuga apayo)\n\nWho is sick?\n\n민경 씨가 아파요 (mingyeong ssiga apayo)\n\nMinkyung is sick.\n\nTopic markers vs subject particles\n\nThe particles ~은/는 (~eun / neun) and ~이/가 (~i / ga) can be quite tricky.\n\nWhy are these so tricky? Both of them are used to indicate the subject in the sentence, making them almost the same in use, which can cause confusion. When creating sentences, you should be careful which one you’ll use unless it doesn’t matter in that particular sentence. With practice, you’ll get the hang of them!\n\nAs mentioned above, in many cases, you can use the particles ~이/가 (~i / ga) and ~은/는 (~eun / neun) interchangeably. With time, as you begin to learn and speak Korean, you’ll be able to differentiate between the two just by noticing how each sentence sounds, but it’s still good to focus on how they are different.\n\nHere are the differences between the subject marking particles ~이/가 and topic markers ~은/는 explained with a few examples.\n\n1. ~은/는 is used to state a general fact. While ~이/가 is used for specific ones.\n\nSample sentences for both topic marking particle and subject particle:\n\n개는 냄새를 잘 맡아요 (gaeneun naemsaereul jal matayo)\n\nDogs are good at smelling\n\n개가 냄새를 못 맡아요 (gaega naemsaereul mot matayo)\n\nThe dog can’t smell it.\n\n2. ~이/가 is used when introducing new information. After the subject has been declared and known to those involved in the conversation (became a topic), 은/는 (eun / neun) is often used.\n\nSample sentences:\n\n옛날 옛적에 한 남자가 살았어요. 그 남자는 요리사였어요 (yennal yetjeoge han namjaga sarasseoyo. geu namjaneun yorisayeosseoyo)\n\nA long time ago, a man lived. The man was a chef.\n\n개가 냄새를 못 맡아요 (gaega naemsaereul mot matayo)\n\nThe dog can’t smell it.\n\n지금 내 친구가 오고 있어요. 내 친구는 한국 음식을 좋아해요. (Jigeum nae chinguga ogo isseoyo. nae chinguneun hangung eumsigeul joahaeyo)\n\nMy friend is coming over now. My friend likes Korean food.\n\n3. ~이/가 is used to ask a question and ~은/는 is used to answer.\n\nSample sentences:\n\n이름이 뭐예요? (ireumi mwoyeyo)\n\nWhat is your name?\n\n내 이름은 지나예요 (nae ireumeun jinayeyo)\n\nMy name is Jina.\n\n화장실이 어디예요? (hwajangsiri eodiyeyo)\n\nWhere is the toilet?\n\n화장실은 엘레베이터 옆에 있어요. (hwajangsireun ellebeiteo yeope isseoyo)\n\nThe toilet is next to the elevator.\n\nHere is some additional information to explain the difference between the Korean particles ~은/는 (~eun / neun) and ~이/가 (~i / ga):\n\nWhile you can use the subject particle ~은/는 (~eun / neun) to describe someone’s profession or nationality and the like or describe someone or yourself with an adjective, you cannot use ~이/가 (~i / ga) to do the same. Think of ~은/는 (~eun / neun) as the markers to use with descriptive sentences.\n\nSimilarly, when you want to describe that you or someone else will do something, it’s better to use ~이/가 (~i / ga) rather than ~은/는 (~eun / neun). So think of ~이/가 (~i / ga) as the subject particles to use with actions.\n\nBut remember, this isn’t always the case. It’ll become easier with practice. This example below shows both ~은/는 (~eun / neun) and ~이/가 (~i / ga) concept in a sentence:\n\n한국 음식은 비빔밥이 제일 맛있어요. (Hangung eumsigeun bibimbabi jeil masisseoyo)\n\nAs for Korean food, bibimbap is the most delicious.\n\n*Note: In this example, Korean food is a topic, and Bibimbap is a subject.\n\nKorean Object Particles\n\nThere are two Korean object particles used to indicate the object in a sentence. Similar to the Korean topic markers and Korean subject particles, both object particles are used depending on the last letter of the word that precedes them.\n\n~을/를 (~eul/reul | Object)\n\nWhen the last syllable ends in a consonant, you use the object marking particle 을. On the other hand, when it ends in a vowel, you should use the object particle 를.\n\nExample sentences using ~을/를 (~eul/reul):\n\n나는 책을 읽었어요 (naneun chaekeul ilgeosseoyo)\n\nI read a book\n\n바나나를 먹어요! (bananareul meogoyo!)\n\nEat a banana!\n\n새 옷을 입으니까 기분이 좋아요. (sae oseul ipeunikka gibuni johayo.)\n\nI feel good to wear new clothes.\n\n비밀을 지켜주세요. (bimireul jikyeojuseyo.)\n\nPlease keep the secret.\n\n따뜻한 차를 마실까요? (ttatteuthan chareul masilkkayo?)\n\nShall we drink some hot tea?\n\n주말에 친구와 영화를 볼 거예요. (jumare chinguwa yeonghwareul bol geoyeyo.)\n\nI’m going to watch a movie with my friend on the weekend.\n\nNotice the subject marking particles in the above example? Multiple types of particles often come into play in a single sentence.\n\nKorean Location Particles\n\nThere are five Korean location particles. All of them help indicate the location in sentences. They can emphasize the place where the subject is going, where action has or is taking place, and direction or movement.\n\nSome of the Korean location particles can also be used to express time.\n\nIn this section, you’ll learn about how each of the Korean location particles functions.\n\n~에 (~e | Time/Location)\n\nThis particle indicates both time and location. The location can express where you are or were at, where you are going, or where something is. And for time, it can express the time or day something happens.\n\nExample Sentences Using ~에 (~e):\n\n저는 학교에 있어요 (jeoneun haggyoe isseoyo)\n\nI am at school.\n\n우리 월요일에 부산에 갈거에요 (uri woryoire busane galgeoeyo)\n\nWe will go to Busan on Monday.\n\nYou’ll need to get used to understanding the use of particles (and also different vocabulary) based on the context of the sentence. In the above sentence, you can recognize the two separate uses of 에 (e) based on the words it’s used with, 월요일 (wollyoil | Monday) and 부산 (Busan).\n\n~에서 (~ eseo | Location)\n\nAlthough ~에서 (~ eseo) also indicates location, its use is quite different from ~에 (~ e). When you use ~에서 (~ eseo), you are stressing the location you are doing or did something in, excluding when the verb of the sentence is 있다 (itda), in which case 에 (e) is used.\n\nExample Sentences Using ~에서 (~ eseo):\n\n카페에서 숙제를 했어요 (khapheeseo sukjereul haesseoyo)\n\nI did my homework in the cafe.\n\nYou can also take advantage of ~에서 (~ eseo) when describing how something is like somewhere. For example:\n\n물가는 노르웨이에서 가장 높아요 (mulganeun noreuweieseo gajang nopayo)\n\nPrices are highest in Norway.\n\n~에서 (~ eseo) can also be used to express “from.” For example:\n\n저는 인도네시아에서 왔어요 (jeoneun indonesiaeseo wasseoyo)\n\nI am from Indonesia.\n\nNote the nuance of how the location is stressed when using 에서 (eseo).\n\nLastly, for 여기 (yeogi)/거기 (geogi)/저기 (eogi), only attach ~서 (~seo).\n\n~으로/로 (~euro/ro | Direction and multiple other meanings)\n\n~으로/로 (~euro/ro) is a multi-functional particle. For starters, you can use it to express the location where something is happening, making its meaning similar to ~에 (~ e).\n\nFor example:\n\n우유를 슈퍼로 사러 가려고 해요 (ujureul syupeoro sareo garyeogo haeyo)\n\nI intend to go to the supermarket to buy milk.\n\nYou can also use it to express the tool, method, language, and so on that something is being done. For example:\n\n기차로 이탈리아에 갈거에요 (gicharo italliae galgeoeoyo)\n\nI will go to Italy by train.\n\n수채화로 그림을 그렸어요 (suchaehwaro geurimeul geuryeosseoyo)\n\nI painted using watercolors.\n\n그사람한테 한국말로 대답을 줬어요 (geu saramhante hangukmallo daedabeul jwosseoyo)\n\nI answered that person in Korean.\n\nYou can even use this particle to express what you ate for a specific meal. For example:\n\n맨날 아침식사로 죽을 먹어요 (maennal achimsiksaro jukeul meokeoyo)\n\nI eat porridge for breakfast every morning.\n\nBy attaching ~(으)로 (~(eu)ro) to 쪽 (jjok) you will create the meaning “the direction of_.” You can attach 쪽 (jjok) with Korean nouns and also some direction words. For example:\n\n그쪽으로 (geujjokeuro)\n\nthat way\n\n남쪽으로 (namjjokeuro)\n\ntoward south\n\n사람쪽으로 (saramjjokeuro)\n\ntoward people\n\n~부터 (~buteo | Start)\n\nThe most common use for ~부터 (~buteo) is to indicate when something starts.\n\nExample Sentences using ~부터(~buteo):\n\n저는 지난달부터 한국어를 배웠어요 (jeoneun jinandalbutheo hangukeoreul baewosseoyo)\n\nI started to learn Korean last month.\n\n~부터 (~buteo) can also be used in a similar fashion to ~에서 (~ eseo), where the difference is more so in the nuance of the sentence rather than the meaning. It is usually reserved for Korean sentences where you would include ~까지 (~ kkaji) in its structure. For example:\n\n집부터 학교까지 걸어 다녀요 (jibbutheo haggyokkaji georeo danyeoyo)\n\nI walk from home to school.\n\nIn fact, it is common to combine ~부터 (~ buteo) with ~까지 (~ kkaji) where ~부터(~ buteo) indicates the starting point and ~까지 (~ kkaji) the end.\n\nFor example:\n\n기말고사는 내일부터 다음주말까지 있을거에요 (gimalgosaneun naeilbutheo daeumjumalkkaji isseulgeoeyo)\n\nOur final exams will start tomorrow and last until the end of next week.\n\nLastly, you can attach the word 처음 (cheoeum), which means “first,” to ~부터 (~ buteo) to express “from the start.” For example:\n\n영어를 배우기가 처음부터 어려웠어요 (yeongeoreul baeugiga cheoeumbutheo eoryeowosseoyo)\n\nLearning English was difficult from the start.\n\n~까지 (~ kkaji | Until)\n\n~까지 typically means “end,” more specifically “until,” and it works for both time and place. You can also use it to mean “to,” often used together with ~에서 (~ eseo), although the use of ~에서 (~eseo) isn’t always necessary and ~까지 (~ kkaji) on its own will remain clear in its meaning.\n\nExample Sentences Using ~까지 (~ kkaji):\n\n집에서 여기까지 걸어서 왔어요 (jibeseo yeogikkaji georeoseo wasseoyo)\n\nI walked until here from home.\n\n시험결과를 내일까지 기다려야 해요 (sihyeomgyeolgwareul naeilkkaji gidaryeoyahaeyo)\n\nI have to wait until tomorrow for the exam results.\n\n우리는 8일부터 12일까지 부산에 있을거에요 (urineun 8ilbutheo 12ilkkaji busane isseulgeoeyo)\n\nWe will be in Busan from the 8th until the 12th.\n\nIf you wish to combine ~까지 (~ kkaji) with the previously mentioned 처음부터 (cheoeumbuteo) to express “from start to finish,” the word to attach to ~까지 (~ kkaji) becomes 끝 (kkeut), which means “end.”\n\nFor example:\n\n하루안에 그 책을 처음부터 끝까지 읽었어요 (haruane geu chaekeul cheoeumbutheo kkeutkkaji ilgeosseoyo)\n\nI read that book from start to finish in one day.\n\nKorean Linking Particles\n\nThere are four Korean linking particles that can be used to connect two or more ideas. Two out of the four linking particles have two variations. Their usage depends on the last letter of the word before them.\n\n~과/와 (~gwa/wa | and/with/as with)\n\nYou use these particles to indicate “and” or “with.” ~과 (~ gwa) is used after a consonant and ~와 (~ wa) is used after a vowel.\n\nExample Sentences Using ~과/와 (~gwa/wa):\n\n아침식사로 죽과 커피를 먹었어요 (achimshiksaro jukgwa kheophireul meogeosseoyo)\n\nI ate porridge and coffee for breakfast.\n\n오늘 남자친구와 영화를 보러 가요 (oneul namjachinguwa yeonghwareul boreo gayo)\n\nToday I will see a movie with my boyfriend.\n\n~이랑/랑 (~irang/rang | and/with/as with)\n\nThis particle is nearly identical in use with ~과/와 (~gwa/wa). You should attach ~이랑 (irang) with a syllable ending in a consonant and ~랑 (rang) with one ending in a vowel. The main difference between these and ~과/와 (~gwa/wa) is that ~이랑/랑 (~irang/rang) is more casual to use and is also more common to hear spoken than to see in text.\n\n~하고 (hago | and/with/as with)\n\n~하고 (hago) is another particle meaning “and” and “with.” It can be used with both vowels and consonants.\n\n~고 (~ go | connective)\n\nThe ~고 (~ go) is a connective particle mainly used to connect two actions, happening one after another, into one sentence, attached either to an action verb or a descriptive verb.\n\nExample Sentences Using ~고 (~ go):\n\n샤워하고 잠을 잘거에요 (shawohago jameul jalgeoeyo)\n\nI will take a shower and then go to sleep.\n\nYou can also use this particle to connect two adjectives describing the same topic or two sentences describing a similar topic into one sentence.\n\nFor example:\n\n그 사람이 똑똑하고 부지런한 학생이에요 (geu sarami ttokttokhago bujireonhan haksaengieyo)\n\nThat person is a smart and diligent student.\n\nAnd yes, you can also use the ~고 particle together with the past tense!\n\nKorean Plural Particle\n\nThere’s only one Korean plural particle added to nouns in a sentence that would make them plural. It is the particle 들 (deul).\n\n~들 (~ deul | Plural)\n\nThe marker 들 (deul) indicates a plural form. However, it is solely used as a marker when talking about people (it’d be weird to use it with a noun like a fruit). In fact, apart from people, it is not that common to use a plural form, and it isn’t totally necessary to use it with people, either. In the cases, you would want to indicate plural, check out the examples.\n\nExample Sentences Using ~들 (~ deul):\n\n오늘 친구들을 만나요 (onweul chingudeureul mannayo)\n\nToday, I will meet with my friends.\n\n그들은 다른 나라에서 살아요 (geudeureun dareun naraeseo sarayo)\n\nThey live in another country.\n\nWhen Koreans talk to you in Korean, you may notice that they omit this particle. This is common in a Korean language conversation.\n\nIt is possible to add the possessive form, which we will introduce soon.\n\nKorean Particle “Only”\n\n~만 (~ man | Only)\n\nThis marker is used to express the word “only,” and it is attached to nouns.\n\nExample Sentences Using ~만 (~ man):\n\n어제 맥주만 마셨어요 (eoje maekjuman masyeosseoyo)\n\nI only drank beer yesterday.\n\n그는 거짓말만 해요 (geuneun geojitmalman haeyo)\n\nHe only says lies.\n\n하루종일 공부만 했어요 (harujongil gongbuman haesseoyo)\n\nI did nothing but study all-day.\n\nKorean Possessive Particles\n\nUnlike in English, where showing possession is indicated by adding an apostrophe and an “s,” Koreans use a possessive particle. The Korean possessive particle ~의 (~ ui) is added or used in sentences to show possession.\n\n~의 (~ ui | Possessive)\n\nFairly straightforward, the ~의 (~ ui) particle indicates possession. This possessive particle is attached to the person who possesses the object, similarly to ‘s in English.\n\nExample Sentences Using ~의 (~ ui):\n\n선생님의 차 (seonsaengnime cha)\n\nthe teacher’s car\n\n그 사람의 여자친구 (geu sarame yeojachingu)\n\nthat person’s girlfriend\n\n나의 집 (naui jib)\n\nmy home/my house\n\nIn the case of “my,” specifically when using the more casual 나(na), you can shorten from 나의 (naui) to 내 (nae). Like this:\n\n내 고양이 (nae goyangi)\n\nmy cat\n\nOther Essential Korean Particles\n\n~께/에게/한테 (~kke/ege/hante | To give someone something)\n\nThese forms all indicate you are giving someone something.\n\nExample Sentence Using 한테 (hante):\n\n오빠한테 돈을 빌려줬어 (oppahante doneul billyeosseo)\n\nI lent money to my big brother.\n\nThe difference between each one is simply their level of politeness. 께 (kke) is of honorific level, 에게 (ege) is formal polite form, and 한테 (hante) is informal and casual. You can read more about Korean honorifics here.\n\n~께서/에게서/한테서 (~kkeseo/egeseo/hanteseo | To receive something from someone)\n\nThese markers possess the same level of politeness as their counterparts above. Technically you do not need the ~서(~seo) attached to the end to make the meaning clear, but it’s good to keep it for differentiation when you’re still a new learner of Korean.\n\n~도 (~ do | Also)\n\n~도 (~do) indicates the use of the additive principle in the form of “too” and “also.” You can drop ~은/는 (~ eun / neun) or other particles when using the additive particle ~도 (~do).\n\nExample Sentences Using ~도 (~do):\n\n나도 빅뱅을 좋아해요 (nado bikbaengeul johahaeyo)\n\nI like Big Bang, too.\n\n나도 연세어학당을 다녀요 (nado yeonseeohakdangeul danyeoyo)\n\nI also attend Yonsei Korean Language Institute.\n\n나도 영국사람이에요 (nado yeongguksaramieyo)\n\nI am also from England.\n\nWrap Up\n\nPhew!
