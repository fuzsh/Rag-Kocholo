The role of language in maintaining cultural identity is examined, and prospects for the future of American Indian languages are assessed.\n\nANTH 201 - Resources and Civilizations\n\nThe availability and use of metals, petroleum, coal, industrial minerals, and other nonrenewable resources has shaped the history of world societies from the Stone Age to the present, and will continue to be a core part of future human development. This course covers how nonrenewable resources form and how they are extracted; the diverse ways that global civilizations have extracted and used nonrenewable resources over time, and how resource use shaped their history; and how the distribution of resources and the development of resource technology around the world created our modern global sociopolitical and economic framework. Other topics covered include nonrenewable resource exhaustion, space mining, resource substitution and associated energy costs, and unintended social and environmental consequences of nonrenewable resource extraction and use.\n\nARC 220 - History Applied Building Tech\n\nThis course provides an overview of global developments in building technology throughout history focusing on the Industrial Revolution to today, exploring core questions and conditions that shape architectural solutions.\n\nAREC 365 - Food Economy & Efficiencies\n\nFew questions are more fundamental than how we feed the world¿s people. Yet, the coexistence of food insecurity and food waste begs the question: how can we feed the population efficiently, sustainably, and equitably? This course familiarizes students with the food economy and its efficiencies while identifying where gaps occur as food flows from producers to consumers. These gaps frequently lead to food insecurity with a less healthy populous, as well as food waste, an issue in more developed societies. By examining 1) the food supply chain and markets, 2) food insecurity, 3) food loss and waste along the food supply chain and 4) food policies through the lens of marginalized populations, students will gain insights into the economic forces that shape the food system. This course stimulates critical thinking and problem solving through economic, nutritional science and policy-making perspectives, which may lead to potential resolutions for those who struggle to afford and consume healthy, wholesome foods.\n\nART 150B1 - Engaging Visual Culture\n\nIn this course, we will engage with concepts and practices of visual culture which includes art) as they relate to our daily lives and to our own productive and consumptive practices. These concepts and practices necessarily have private, public, and profound political and educational affects.

Students will examine museums in their communities, as well as national and international museums. Throughout this course, students will consider whose voices are elevated in museum spaces and who is left out. They will explore the interdisciplinary connections museum visitors can make through synthesizing ideas, sharing perspectives, and learning together.\n\nASTR 214 - Life in the Cosmos\n\nThis course explores key questions in astrobiology and planetary science about the origin and evolution of life on Earth and the possibility that such phenomena have arisen elsewhere in the Universe. We examine what it means for a planet to be alive at scales ranging from cellular processes up to global impacts of biological activity. We survey international space-exploration activities to search for life within the Solar System, throughout our Galaxy, and beyond.\n\nCLAS 160B1 - Meet the Ancients: Greece/Rome\n\nJourney into the past to discover the worlds of the ancient Greeks and Romans. From democracy and republicanism to literature, philosophy and art, the contributions of these two cultures serve as the foundation for much of what has been described as western culture. This course explores who these peoples were, how these civilizations developed, what ideas and institutions they created, and why the Greeks and Romans matter today. Through this exploration into the Greco-Roman world, this course builds connections between the multiple types of evidence that scholars draw upon to paint a picture of the ancient past. Close readings of texts provide a humanistic perspective on classical culture; archaeological data inform us about social scientific trends in demography and economics; environmental evidence from ice cores, botanical remains, and soil samples enable a natural science perspective on the past; and some of the world's most famous objects--from the Venus di Milo to Grecian vases--allow for artistic insights. In this course, students will evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each disciplinary approach to understanding the past, and ultimately weave together multiple strands of evidence to create their signature assignment. Upon completing Meet the Ancients, students will not only have a better understanding of Greco-Roman history and culture, they will, above all, have a deeper understanding of the different perspectives used to approach ancient history and the skills to evaluate and synthesize diverse types of evidence.\n\nCLAS 305 - Greek+Roman Religion\n\nReligious beliefs and cult practices in ancient Greece and Rome.

This course offers an introduction to the histories, cultures, languages and scripts, religions, and literatures of traditional East Asia. It also invites students to participate in the interdisciplinary knowledge production that is East Asian Studies. While we explore what has been historically shared among these East Asian societies, our emphasis is on how East Asia has always been diverse and heterogeneous. We encourage students to debunk the popular myths about East Asia--particularly premodern East Asia--as an exotic and homogeneous place. This will not only inform our understanding of today's East Asia in its historical context, it will also prompt us to actively address the historical legacy of orientalism.\n\nEAS 270 - War & Revolution in East Asia\n\nThis course examines conflict, typically expressing itself in violence and often resulting in wars and revolutions, as defining moments in the modern history of East Asia when opposing social movements, and their affiliated ideas about political, cultural, and economic organization, confront one another over questions of power and autonomy. The course explores how conflict introduces new social dynamics that may have led to revolutionary changes in ideas and institutions.\n\nECON 150C2 - Climate Science and Economics\n\nIntroduces the fundamentals of climate change: what is it, what does it mean, and what to do about it. Describes economic approaches to managing climate change. Shows how a climate scientist's perspective leads to one set of policy recommendations and an economist's leads to another. Students adopt these perspectives through quantitatively-based projects, with introductions to climate modeling and economic modeling.\n\nECON 205 - Ethics+Econ/Wealth Creat\n\nWe will study the ethics and the economics of such phenomena as market competition, institutions of private and public property, trade restrictions, globalization, and corporate welfare. How do people create wealth? How do societies enable people to create wealth? Are some ways more ethical than others? Why do some societies grow rich while neighboring societies remain poor? People have various ways of creating wealth. Which are ethical and which are not? Why? PHIL 205 is not an introduction to the principles of Economics and is not a substitute for ECON 200, ECON 201A or ECON201B.)\n\nENGL 160A2 - Food Writing\n\nENGL 160A2 explores food writing and its relationship to culture. Exploring food as both personal and cultural symbol, students will develop an appreciation for how food traditions reflect and shape cultural societies and diverse worldview. Course materials will include diverse perspectives with emphasis on marginalized groups such as migrant, incarcerated, and Indigenous food communities. Students will explore their own food memories in reflective writing and storytelling to find connections between personal food histories and social or environmental justice. Using various rhetorical strategies and drawing from research, field study, oral history, and lived experiences/traditional knowledge, students will practice food writing for a variety of audiences in four key genres: recipe card, podcast, food memoir, and manifesto. Workshop and revision will be important aspects of the course.\n\nENGL 307 - Business Writing\n\nBusiness writing is an Engaged Learning course that provides applied, hands-on experiences with professional business writing. The course explores how to address ethics of communication and how to navigate opportunities and challenges presented when writing business correspondence.

But how might the perspectives of university students, environmental and social scientists, activists, influencers and other community members work together to build connections and get humanity there faster? And how might science literacy coupled with social and cultural awareness provide pathways for long term solutions? This course will help you to answer these questions through exploring the underlying science while considering how your own worldviews the experiences, biases, perceptions, preconceived notions, skepticism, fears, behaviors and knowledge gaps every human possesses) play a role in the socio-cultural complexities of environmental issues. Upon completing this course, students will be able to bust the myths, challenge the naysayers, make science-informed decisions as global citizens, promote cultural awareness, and save planet earth.\n\nENVS 310 - Ecosystem Health and Justice\n\nAcross America, one in four Americans lives within 3 miles of a hazardous waste site U.S. General Accounting Office, 2013). This means that one's zip code can be more important than their genetic code. Today's complex environmental health and justice challenges have far-reaching impacts and require an ability to interweave different data sources to build connections across disciplines and social positions. Students will learn how using an environmental justice framework and merging different datasets and forms of knowledge can uncover the underlying assumptions inequality, distribution of power and privilege, oppression/marginalization) that contributes to and produces unequal protection. Students will learn from diverse individuals who are generating creative and systems-based environmental health solutions. After the course, students will demonstrate an ability to build connections among various stakeholders and use multiple perspectives to solve challenges.

Never has there been a more urgent and exciting!) time to take a class that carefully navigates these terms and the important subject positions they represent. How have these shifts influenced the work of visual artists? What new tools do literary scholars need in order to analyze innovative creative writing that seeks to destabilize gender? How have sociologists expanded their presuppositions about the social transmission of gender roles? And how can we, as students of this class, build connections between the artists, literary scholars, and sociologists in order to create our own robust interdisciplinary frameworks that are capacious enough to apprehend new and dynamic gender formations? In addition to exploring these questions, we will consider the ways that gender influences, and is influenced by, social differences, social status, and political and economic systems. We will track the connections between the individual and institutions such as mass media, science, education, and the family. By the end of the semester students should have developed a facility with gender as a key term of interdisciplinary analysis and should have a good understanding of the dynamic interactions between gender, race, sexuality, nation, embodiment, and socio-economic class.\n\nGWS 160C1 - Techn+Soc:Intro Sci+Tech\n\nThis course is an introduction to the social, historical, and ethical contexts of knowledge, science and technology. Although science and technology are perhaps the defining features of contemporary Western society, all cultures have distinct forms of knowledge and technical practices, which reflect their relationships to the natural world and other peoples. In this course we will discuss a range of questions relevant to scientists, engineers, and the general public, about the contexts of technoscience, basing these discussions on a broad historical understanding of science and technology in various cultures\n\nGWS 200 - Gender, Identity, and Power\n\nThis course examines how ideas about women, gender, and sexuality have been created through the arts, literature, laws, and science.

The course examines gender through complex relations of power such as race, class, sexuality and considers historical and transnational contexts. Engaging multiple fields, texts, and approaches, students gather a conceptual tool box with which to explore gender and make connections to the world around them.\n\nGWS 242 - Gender & Education\n\nRecently, there has been an increasing focus on gender in educational research and practice. Scholars and practitioners are taking note not only of the differential outcomes for students in relation to gender, but are also discussing how systems of privilege and oppression e.g., sexism, heteropatriarchy, transgender oppression) mediate educational environments. Furthermore, there has been a call by some to address gender in expansive, non-binary ways that include students with diverse genders beyond just thinking about men and/or women. In this class, students will survey the current literature regarding gender in education--both K-12 and postsecondary education--as well as discuss how policies and practices both inhibit and promote expansive understandings of gender as a social identity. Students will also develop educational interventions that reflect this literature.\n\nGWS 317 - Science Fiction Study\n\nScience fiction is studied as a genre of film and print fiction in which we can imagine future societies and future science and technology in utopian and dystopian forms, paying particular attention to race/class/gender and depictions of identity and otherness, as well as social power in imagined societies.\n\nGWS 321 - Women In Judaism\n\nThis course examines religion and gender through the study of women in Judaism. How do scholars construct a history of women in ancient Judaism when Jewish sacred texts are written by and for men? How have modern Jewish women accommodated feminist ideals without undermining the authority of the established tradition? What impact has the feminist movement had on Jewish communal institutions in the United States and Israel? In this course, we explore these questions and others by examining the influence Jewish religious beliefs and practices have played in the formation of Jewish women's identities, image and their understanding of power and authority. Students study the role of women in the formation of Judaism and Jewish society as a culturally constructed and historically changing category through archaeology, biblical studies, rabbinics, theology, folklore, social and political movements.\n\nHED 242 - Gender & Education\n\nRecently, there has been an increasing focus on gender in educational research and practice. Scholars and practitioners are taking note not only of the differential outcomes for students in relation to gender, but are also discussing how systems of privilege and oppression e.g., sexism, heteropatriarchy, transgender oppression) mediate educational environments. Furthermore, there has been a call by some to address gender in expansive, non-binary ways that include students with diverse genders beyond just thinking about men and/or women. In this class, students will survey the current literature regarding gender in education--both K-12 and postsecondary education--as well as discuss how policies and practices both inhibit and promote expansive understandings of gender as a social identity. Students will also develop educational interventions that reflect this literature. HED 397C - Native SOAR This service-learning course emphasizes current issues in K-12th grade and college education with a focus on Indigenous Native American) students.

Why do certain foods appeal and others repel? How do foods move from their original homes into our own? How has our cuisine evolved? And how do food and consumption reflect status and power? Food & Power in Global History takes a world history approach to investigate these and other questions by considering the cultural, economic, and geopolitical discovery, evolution, and migration of food and drink from pre-modern times to the present. We explore the discovery, invention, and adaptation of new foods from early human history to our own post-Columbian era, when local foods have become truly global. Food and drink have transformed continents and trading networks, and made and broken empires. Food is a site of cultural exchange and interaction, and it is also an expression and marker of identities. Wars have been fought to control food access. Dining, retail, and industrialization have reshaped the way we look at food. We will trace the origins, migration, and reinvention of global foods to understand how it is that food choice, food waste, and famine are more abundant today than at any point in human history.\n\nHIST 246 - History of American Capitalism\n\nThis course provides a long-term historical perspective on the origins and development of American capitalism, combining three interrelated thematic fields in U.S. history: economic history, business history, and labor history.\n\nHIST 247 - Nature & Technology in US Hist\n\nThis course explores the development of technology and concepts of nature in the United States, from the eighteenth century to the present.

The course explores how conflict introduces new social dynamics that may have led to revolutionary changes in ideas and institutions.\n\nHIST 362A - Culture Food & Health in Japan\n\nHow do we know what is good for us, who gets to decide, and how does healthy change over time? This seminar explores these basic questions through the lens of Japanese food culture: the dietary trends, choices, and ideas of proper consumption that help shape the relationship between people's bodies and the world around them. We will discuss how and why eating right became such an important issue in Japan from the seventeenth century to the present and ask what the everyday experience of eating can tell us about the core themes, concepts, and events in Japanese and East Asian history. By putting Japanese foodways in conversation with global gastronomy, we will investigate what makes food cultural and what makes it historical. This course welcomes undergraduates of all interests and majors, and no prior knowledge of Japanese language or history is required. Additional materials in East Asian languages will be made available upon request.\n\nHNRS 150C1 - Knowledge, Power and Nature\n\nThis interdisciplinary course facilitates students to critically examine how different factors shape the relationships between human beings and the natural world from social, physical, and earth science perspectives.

They interpret Buddhist texts describing the construction of buddha bodies in art, ritual, and in the mind. Students also engage with the work of contemporary performance artists inspired by Buddhist ideals of discipline and impermanence. Reflecting upon these experiences, students uncover how the categories of East' and West have obscured the understanding of Buddhist art, artists, and communities.

Absolutely no previous experience with the study of China is necessary. At the same time, we hope to bring new perspectives to those who already have some familiarity with Chinese history and culture.\n\nENGL 160D2 - Nonhuman Subjects\n\nMonsters are cool--but they're also interesting, and also sometimes deeply problematic. The category of the non-human (or, more broadly, the Other) raises key questions about human identity, human values, and the cultural boundaries we construct to cordon off the horrific, the weird, the frightening, the monstrous, or the non-human. As a result, we won't focus simply on particular monster-types like the zombie, the vampire, or the cyborg. Instead, we'll look at the monster-figure in literature and film as a key indicator of cultural history: the symbolic carrier of cultural values, problems, and ideological tensions. These cultural issues can include things like political dissension, systems of religious belief, social order and disorder, human nature, or distinctions of race/class/gender. As we'll see, monsters often become symbols in the cultural, political, and intellectual clashes that mark Western history. In order to better understand our cultural roots, then, we have to come to terms with the historical and ideological tensions behind those clashes. In this course, we'll demonstrate that through well-organized analytical arguments that present strong textual evidence and display critical thinking.\n\nENGL 265 - Major American Writers\n\nThis class will introduce students to the study of American writers working in English.

They provide entertainment and recreation, but they also reflect and influence many other aspects of life. We will investigate the importance of games and play in shaping medieval and early modern societies by exploring a wide variety of leisure activities, including board games (like chess), equestrian sports (like hunting), ball games (like skittles), and gambling (with dice, cards, and just about anything else imaginable!). We will also explore what role people at this time believed games and play had in maintaining health. Through our examination of games and play, we will explore the cultural, social, political, religious, economic, legal, military, environmental, and intellectual history of the medieval and early modern world. We will critically engage (and also play!) with a wide selection of medieval and early modern texts, images, and material objects from around the world; and you will use these sources (and ones you discover!) to do your own historical research on games and play.\n\nHIST 277A - Hist Mid East 600-1453\n\nIn this course, students take a humanistic disciplinary perspective to explore the cultural products of the pre-modern Middle East and answer questions about its historical development. Using primary sources in translation and secondary scholarship, students will explore the context of the rise of Islam; the process of conversion and expansion across the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia; the crystallization of Shi'ism and changing notions of religious authority; and the impact of Turkish migrations and Mongol conquests. They will become familiar with major genres of pre-modern Middle Eastern literary, religious, and scientific writings, and use techniques of close reading to answer questions about those texts' ideological positions and contexts.\n\nHIST 277B - People's History Middle East\n\nThis course approaches the history of the modern Middle East through a Humanist perspective. We consider the Ottoman Empire, the Arab lands, and Iran from 1453 to the present through the interconnected spheres of political, economic, and social history. We will identify major historical periods, figures, geographical features, and movements that have shaped the region and assess the effects of colonialism and imperialism. Lectures, readings, writing, and discussions develop case studies to emphasize the interplay between individual lives, structural diversity and inequality, and historical contingency. Through guided primary source analysis and close readings of a range of texts, students will develop the tools to consider different temporal and spatial scales. Finally, students will consider their own positionality as historical actors in relation to the people of the modern Middle East.\n\nHIST 316 - Warfare and Violence\n\nFrom the time of our stone-age ancestors violence has been an integral feature of human societies. Variously expressed as the organized violence of state-directed warfare, the smaller-scale conflicts of tribes and clans, or the actions of lone individuals, violence is a depressingly-common feature of the human experience. This course analyzes the impact and function of violence from the late-Neolithic onwards, culminating with the more-complex state structures, legal systems, and military bureaucracies that have emerged in the modern age. Topics of particular focus will include how technology relates to and facilitates violence; the impact of warfare on civilian populations; the effect of violence on individuals; legal efforts to frame and define legitimate violence; and the mythologizing of violent acts (and actors) in historical memory. Students will gai a broad understanding of warfare and violence as expressed in a variety of Western and non-Western contexts including Europe, Africa, the Near East and the Americas. By taking this course students will develop a greater understanding of the concept of violence as a historical phenomenon, and be better prepared to analyze the place and function of modern/contemporary expressions of violence, both between and within human societies.\n\nHUMS 150B1 - Mind-Altering Substances\n\nThis course will be an introduction to the many uses of psychotropic substances in the ancient world.

In order to do this, we will read portions of primary texts in translation and learn to interpret visual and material culture. The primary focus will be to understand how these psychotropic substances were employed within all aspects of society. By understanding the various uses of psychotropic substances in a comparative context, students may better understand how to think critically about the role of drugs beyond their recreational use, thereby fostering an understanding of different cultures and their uses of psychotropics.\n\nITAL 250C - Italian Theatre\n\nHow did the Italian historical context and theatrical spaces impact the creation and reception of theatrical texts? How did these texts shape the context of the Italian society? What is intermediality? How do media re-narrate, re-interpret, and adapt literary texts? How do media cross linguistic, space/time, and cultural borders? What gets lost in the translation of texts across different media? What is produced instead? These are some of the questions we will explore to improve our understanding of intermediality, or the relations among different media (theatre, opera, film), using the humanist's tools and methodologies (historical and social contextualization, close reading, critical analysis, scholars' production).We will engage with the history of Italian theater from 16thto 20thcentury, contextualizing, reading, and analyzing plays and libretti by Machiavelli, Da Ponte, Goldoni, Mascagni, Pirandello, Fo, and Ginzburg. We will combine a traditional approach to canonical texts of the Italian theatrical tradition with an interdisciplinary methodology that compares literary and visual texts.\n\nITAL 330D - Women In Italian Society\n\nComprehensive study of images of Italian women in literary, historic, religious texts, the visual arts, and their effects on the cultural productions of women writers and artists.
