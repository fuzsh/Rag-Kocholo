        "text": "ARTH 0127 The Material Past in a Digital World\n\nThe material remains of the human past -objects and spaces- provide tangible evidence of past people's lives. Today's information technologies improve our ability to document, study, and present these materials. But what does it mean to deal with material evidence in a virtual context? In this class, students will learn basic digital methods for studying the past while working with objects, including those in the collections of the Penn Museum. This class will teach relational database design and 3D object modeling. As we learn about acquiring and managing data, we will gain valuable experience in the evaluation and use of digital tools. The digital humanities are a platform both for learning the basic digital literacy students need to succeed in today's world and for discussing the human consequences of these new technologies and data. We will discuss information technology's impact on the study and presentation of the past, including topics such as public participation in archaeological projects, educational technologies in museum galleries, and the issues raised by digitizing and disseminating historic texts and objects. Finally, we will touch on technology's role in the preservation of the past in today's turbulent world. No prior technical experience is required, but we hope students will share an enthusiasm for the past.\n\nAlso Offered As: ANTH 1303, CLST 1303, HIST 0871\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 0141 Museums, Monuments, and Social Justice\n\nMonuments, museums, and heritage are all critical parts of the world that we have created and are shaped by. These institutions and sites often claim to represent our past, who we imagine ourselves to be today, and how we might define our futures. We often rely on museums and monuments to frame history and history’s relationship to our current social and cultural systems. However, in recent years, social, racial, and economic justice movements have pushed us to rethink the function of monuments, museums, and heritage. In particular, these social movements have helped us understand how racism, sexism, and colonialism are responsible for the creation of monuments and museums. This course examines the echoes and continuities of colonial representations in museums and monuments. In addition, we will examine how new ways of commemorating and representing the past can result in a new vision for our future. By visiting a variety of local monuments and sites and by engaging in conversations about accountability and social justice, this course will challenge us to rethink the tangible and intangible ways that we weave the past into the present for the creation of the future.\n\nFall\n\nAlso Offered As: ANTH 1410\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 0143 The Past Preserved: Conservation In Archaeology\n\nThis course explores the scientific conservation of cultural materials from archaeological contexts. It is intended to familiarize students with the basics of artifact conservation but is not intended to train them as conservators. The course will cover how various materials interact with their deposit environments; general techniques for on-site conservation triage and retrieval of delicate materials; what factors need to be considered in planning for artifact conservation; and related topics. Students should expect to gain a thorough understanding of the role of conservation in archaeology and how the two fields interact.\n\nAlso Offered As: ANTH 3235, CLST 3315, MELC 4955, NELC 4955\n\nMutually Exclusive: ANTH 5235\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 0221 Material World in Archaeological Science\n\nBy focusing on the scientific analysis of inorganic archaeological materials, this course will explore processes of creation in the past. Class will take place in the Center for the Analysis of Archaeological Materials (CAAM) and will be team taught in three modules: analysis of lithics, analysis of ceramics and analysis of metals. Each module will combine laboratory and classroom exercises to give students hands-on experience with archaeological materials. We will examine how the transformation of materials into objects provides key information about past human behaviors and the socio-economic contexts of production, distribution, exchange and use. Discussion topics will include invention and adoption of new technologies, change and innovation, use of fire, and craft specialization.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ANTH 2221, CLST 3302, MELC 2960, NELC 2960\n\nMutually Exclusive: ANTH 5221\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 0339 Sacred Stuff: Religious Bodies, Places, and Objects\n\nDoes religion start with what's in our heads? Or are religious commitments made, shaped and strengthened by the people, places, and things around us? This course will explore how religion happens in the material world. We'll start with classical and contemporary theories on the relationship of religion to stuff. We'll then consider examples of how religion is animated not just by texts, but through interactions with objects, spaces, bodies, monuments, color, design, architecture, and film. We'll ask how these material expressions of religion move beyond private faith and connect religion to politics and identity.\n\nFall or Spring\n\nAlso Offered As: ANTH 1120, RELS 1020\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 0500 First-Year Seminar\n\nThe primary goal of the first-year seminar program is to provide every first-year student the opportunity for a direct personal encounter with a faculty member in a small setting devoted to a significant intellectual endeavor. Specific topics are posted at the beginning of each academic year.\n\nFall or Spring\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 0501 Spiegel-Wilks First-Year Seminar\n\nThe primary goal of the first-year seminar program is to provide every first-year student the opportunity for a direct personal encounter with a faculty member in a small setting devoted to a significant intellectual endeavor. Specific topics are posted at the beginning of each academic year. This Spiegel-Wilks seminar focuses exclusively on contemporary art.\n\nFall or Spring\n\nAlso Offered As: ENGL 0365\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 1010 World Art Before 1400\n\nThis course serves as a double introduction to art history. First, it surveys the visual arts in a global context from prehistory to the dawn of the modern era. Focusing on multiple premodern cultures and traditions, the course examines a wide variety of art forms, from public monuments and architecture to paintings, textiles, and illustrated books. We will consider this rich material in its historical context and ask how art was made, used, seen, and valued by people in the past. Special emphasis will be placed on cross-cultural connections, interactions, and analogies. Second, the course will introduce you to the practice of art history. You will develop the skills of visual analysis and critical reading and learn the basic methods that scholars employ to interpret works of art and architecture. In the process, you will gain a deeper understanding of the intersection of art, society, and human experience at large. Lectures and group discussions will be complemented by visits to museums and other collections on campus and beyond.\n\nFall\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 1020 The Artist in History,1400-Now\n\nThis course is an introduction to the history of art in a global context from the early 1400s to the present. Lectures will introduce students to significant moments in artistic production in both the Western and Eastern hemispheres through focused studies on crucial ​aspects of exchange between cultures and continents. Covering an era of increasing economic ​transactions, ​imperial conquests, and industrialization, this course will build recursively through themes such as: the emergence of authorial identity and models of artistic collaboration, the ​traffic of artistic materials and techniques and their adaptation in different cultural settings, and the foregrounding of art to both document and initiate political change. Developing vocabularies to discuss painting, sculpture, architecture, and prints, ​as well as photography and film, students will learn to ​analyze art's decisive role during times of social transformation, including modernization, ​colonization, and technological advances​. ​We will also examine the role of broad-reaching ​media and the advent of art criticism in forming public opinion. Assignments will encourage students to think widely across geographies and study intimately local examples in the Philadelphia museums. This course fulfills Sector III: Arts and Letters and counts towards the History of Art major and minor requirements.\n\nSpring\n\nAlso Offered As: VLST 2320\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 1030 Art and Civilization in East Asia\n\nIntroduction to the major artistic traditions of China and Japan and the practices of art history. We will also consider aspects of Korean and Indian artistic traditions as they relate to those of China and Japan. Our approaches will be methodological in addressing how we understand these objects through careful looking; chronological in considering how the arts developed in and through history; and thematic in studying how art and architecture were used for philosophical, religious and material ends. Special attention will be given to the relationship between artistic production and the afterlife; to the impact of Buddhism and its purposes; to painting traditions and their patronages; and to modernist transformations of traditions.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: EALC 0100, VLST 2330\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 1040 Art of Global Asia\n\nThis course surveys flows of ideas, images, and objects across, within, and beyond Asia. It considers how the art of Asia is and has been global from antiquity through the present, and introduces 'Asia,' 'globality,' and 'art' as key terms and concepts that shift over time and place. Artistic traditions are presented within broader historical, cultural, social, and economic frameworks, with attention to their local and regional significance. Trade, exchange, and interaction between cultures and groups, including but not limited to artists, pilgrims, merchants, warriors, and rulers, and the transmission of concepts through languages, religions, and philosophies, will be highlighted throughout. We shall address problems of iconophilia and iconoclasm, narrative and temporality, archeology and historiography, ritual and religion, sovereignty and kingship, gender and sexuality, colonialism and nationalism, diasporas and migration as they pertain to the images, objects, and sites of our study. We shall make use of local resources at the Penn Museum and Penn Libraries, as well as other sites, to show how objects retain and inflect these ideas. The course builds out from a central focus on the arts of South Asia or the arts of East Asia, depending upon the specialty of the faculty member teaching the course, with additional faculty offering guest lectures as available. Students with a background in art history, studio art, architecture, history, religion, literature, anthropology, and/or South or East Asian Studies are especially welcome.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: SAST 1040, VLST 2340\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 1060 Architect and History\n\nThe built environment shapes our lives and this course tackles its underpinning design principles and qualities as well as social and cultural contexts. It is an interpretative look at the built environment or, more precisely, at the ways in which monuments and cities are designed, represented, perceived and construed over time. It introduces students to the interrelated fields of architecture, art history, and urbanism and explores great architectural monuments and cities from the modern to the ancient period, from the US across Europe and from the Mediterranean to Asia. We will assess the built environment as culturally meaningful form and examine a body of historical and cultural material relevant to its interpretation. In doing so, the course seeks to foster a critical understanding of the cultural and artistic processes that have influenced architectural and urban design. The focus will be on understanding these works as results of skilled workmanship as well as social and cultural products. We will tackle ancient and modern perceptions of these monuments and cities by analyzing form, design, structure and by addressing their perceptual qualities through 3D reconstructions and virtual environments, as well as sketchbook assignments. This course fulfills Sector IV, Humanities and Social Sciences.\n\nFall\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 1100 What is Modern Art?\n\nModernism is not easily defined. For some, the word simply identifies Western art of the last two hundred-odd years. For others, modernism refers to forms of “advanced” visual art, whether the cubist distortions of Pablo Picasso or the allover abstractions of Jackson Pollock, that break with established representational conventions. For still others, the term singles out modes of artistic opposition to the ravages of capitalism, colonialism, industrialization, imperialism, and war that continue to define our world. Among its manifold practices, we find the rise of abstraction, paintings that pretend to show nothing but an instant, dreams and erotic desires set free for everyone to see, and everyday objects elevated to the status of sculpture. At key moments, \"Art\" itself was declared dead, then resurrected as the solution to the social problems of the era, forming a highly ambivalent relationship to the spheres of politics and history. We will cover the development of Modernism broadly, from the 1860s to the 1960s, introducing many of the best-known figures (like Monet, Van Gogh, Duchamp, and Picasso) and movements (like Impressionism, Cubism, Dada, and Surrealism). Europe and North America will be the focus, but we will frequently look to global developments as well and analyze art made in colonial and diasporic conditions. The standard narratives of Modernism will be questioned at every turn, and artists of color, diverse gender and sexual orientations, as well as national and economic backgrounds studied in depth as well. We will proceed more or less chronologically, doubling back or projecting forward when necessary to understand the determinative historical influences that have shaped the development of modernist idioms in particular times and places. In every instance, we will study works of art that have confronted our culture’s visual means—of life, death, consumption, and display—and attempted to work them over into critical form.\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 1500 Eye, Mind, and Image\n\nVisual Studies 101 provides an introduction to the collaboration of eye, mind, and image that produces our experience of a visual world. How and what do we see? How do we perceive color, space, and motion? What is an image? Does seeing vary across cultures and time? What can art tell us about vision? Is there a 21st-century form of seeing? This course combines different approaches to the study of vision, drawing from psychology, cognitive science, philosophy, history of art, and fine art. Professors representing two or three disciplines present lectures that demonstrate the methods of their disciplines and draw connections across fields.

In fact the concepts of modern art and homosexuality that we use today are twins, for they were both founded in the third quarter of the 19th century and grew up together. Introduction to Queer Art thus begins with the coining of the word \"homosexual\" in 1869, and surveys how a range of mediums including painting, sculpture, poetry, music, and film shifted in response to new definitions of sexuality. Along the way, we will work towards answering two related questions: 1) Why were queer creators largely responsible for the introduction of modernity in the arts, and 2) why do we find so often that queer social and political dissent found form in, and as, aesthetic dissent as well? In creating new forms for art that often seem far removed from any traditional definition of sexuality, including non-objective and abstract art, queer artists pushed the boundaries of normativity, leading to new ways of seeing, hearing, feeling and thinking that often dared to encode queer meanings as part of their formal innovation. We will look into the politics of queer art, and how and why in the US, even amidst often dangerous homophobia, it was queer artists who represented America to itself. Thus, we will cover such key cultural figures such as Walt Whitman, Gertrude Stein, Georgia O'Keeffe, Frank O'Hara, Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol, and Agnes Martin. Throughout, new methods informed by queer, gender, and critical race theory will be utilized.\n\nFall\n\nAlso Offered As: GSWS 1800\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 1900 What is Contemporary Art?\n\nWhat is contemporary art? When is contemporary art? For whom is contemporary art? Where is contemporary art? And… why does contemporary art matter? This survey introduces us to some central artists, themes, works, and debates currently comprising the history of contemporary art, with a particular focus on the social, racial, and political engagements that have informed artistic developments, as well as how they are historicized in relation to other art and geopolitical events, globally. We consider the ways in which artists have approached, contested, reflected, and reconfigured the problems and possibilities of institutions in order to find critical traction and build historical context. We also look at how globalization, technology, racialization, and capitalism have all shaped artistic production, art criticism, and the art market, while also reflecting upon the temporality of our present and what it is that is “contemporary” to our “now.”\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2094 Dress and Fashion in Africa\n\nThroughout Africa, social and cultural identities of ethnicity, gender, generation, rank and status were conveyed in a range of personal ornamentation that reflects the variation of African cultures. The meaning of one particular item of clothing can transform completely when moved across time and space. As one of many forms of expressive culture, dress shape and give forms to social bodies. In the study of dress and fashion, we could note two distinct broad approaches, the historical and the anthropological. While the former focuses on fashion as a western system that shifted across time and space, and linked with capitalism and western modernity; the latter approach defines dress as an assemblage of modification the body. The Africanist proponents of this anthropological approach insisted that fashion is not a dress system specific to the west and not tied with the rise of capitalism. This course will focus on studying the history of African dress by discussing the forces that have impacted and influenced it overtime, such as socio-economic, colonialism, religion, aesthetics, politics, globalization, and popular culture. The course will also discuss the significance of the different contexts that impacted the choices of what constitute an appropriate attire for distinct situations. African dress in this context is not a fixed relic from the past, but a live cultural item that is influenced by the surrounding forces.\n\nSpring\n\nAlso Offered As: AFRC 2324, ANTH 2024\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2120 Cities and Temples in Ancient India\n\nThe wooden architecture of ancient India's cities is represented in relief carvings from Buddhist religious monuments of the early centuries A.D. and replicated in remarkable excavated cave cathedrals. This lecture course will trace that architectural tradition, its transformation into a symbolic vocabulary for a new structure, the Hindu temple, and the development of the temple in India from ca. 500-1500 A.D.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: SAST 2120\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2130 Arts of Japan\n\nThis lecture course introduces the major artistic traditions of Japan, from the Neolithic period to the present, and teaches the fundamental methods of the discipline of art history. Special attention will be given to the places of Shinto, the impact of Buddhism, and their related architectures and sculptures; the principles of narrative illustration; the changing roles of aristocratic, monastic, shogunal and merchant patronage; the formation of the concept of the artist over time; and the transformation of tradition in the modern age.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: EALC 0140\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2140 Arts of China\n\nA broad survey of Chinese architecture, sculpture, and painting from the Neolithic age through the nineteenth century. Topics include excavated material from China's Bronze Age, Chinese funerary arts, Buddhist caves and sculpture (including works in the University Museum), the Chinese city, the Chinese garden, and major masterpieces of Chinese painting.\n\nFall or Spring\n\nAlso Offered As: EALC 0120\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2145 Reading Maya Culture: Decipherment and a New Window into the Ancient Americas\n\nThe past three decades have seen a revolution in the study of the Ancient Americas, one with far-reaching implications for how we understand indigenous society and culture on this continent. This course will take us on a journey of academic discovery—encompassing language, art, and materiality—that explains how the decipherment of a major writing system has revealed a previously hidden world. The Maya are one of the most distinctive and best-known of Mesoamerican peoples, who live today, as they did in ancient times, in the Yucatan Peninsula and a region that spans modern southern Mexico, the whole of Guatemala and Belize, and the westernmost fringes of Honduras and El Salvador. From as early as 1000 BCE they were erecting major architecture and flourished for twenty-five more centuries before the invasion of Europeans brought their independence to an end in the sixteenth century CE. Within their elaborate urban spaces, the Maya erected large stone monuments inscribed with imagery and hieroglyphic texts—most of them commissioned in the Classic Period that reaches from 150-900 CE—although the script is also found on many smaller and more intimate objects. For the first century of research these texts proved all but unintelligible, as faulty assumptions and lack of adequate sources left a deep pessimism that they could ever be understood. But beginning in the 1980s major progress in \"cracking the code\" took place and today we can read almost all inscriptions to some extent, a decent number in their entirety. This course will teach practical skills that allow students with no previous background to read Maya inscriptions and gain access to the history, politics, religious beliefs, and practical material culture they describe. The fabulous design of the hieroglyphs, that at first seem so impenetrable, will be broken-down to reveal not only language but an iconographic system that reveals much about the ancient Maya aesthetics and visual culture.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ANTH 2145, LALS 2145\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2170 Chinese Painting\n\nStudy of Chinese painting and practice from the earliest pictorial representation through the late twentieth century. Painting styles are analyzed, but themes such as landscape and narrative are considered with regard to larger social, cultural, and historical issues. The class will pay particular attention to the construction of the concepts of the \"artist\" and \"art criticism\" and their impact on the field into the present. Visits to study paintings at the University of Pennsylvania Museum and Philadelphia Museum of Art.\n\nFall or Spring\n\nAlso Offered As: EALC 1127\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2180 Art and Architecture in Ancient Egypt\n\nThis course will be an introduction to the art, architecture and minor arts that were produced during the three thousand years of ancient Egyptian history. This material will be presented in its cultural and historical contexts through illustrated lectures and will include visits to the collection of the University Museum.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ANCH 1305, MELC 0210\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2200 The Ancient Maya: Integrating Material, Text, and Image\n\nAncient Maya studies is one of the most dynamic and innovative fields in world archaeology today. Emerging as a true historical archaeology only in the past three decades, the decipherment of Maya script now provides a powerful complement and counterpoint to both traditional excavation data and new remote sensing technologies. Equally, the reading of images, and their interaction with texts and artifacts, forms a vital part of our interest in the broader humanistic concerns of worldview and the transcendent--where our primary interest lies in gaining access to past mentalities. This course will provide a comprehensive introduction into current knowledge of the Ancient Maya, with a recurring methodological focus on how different types of evidence are integrated to assemble a persuasive \"portrait of the past.\" This scope of this process is unique in the ancient Americas, since only the Maya offer us the opportunity to read their own descriptions of the world two millennia or more in the past. Geographically, we will be looking at the greater Yucatan Peninsula, which today covers parts of southeastern Mexico, the whole of Guatemala and Belize, and the western extremities of Honduras and El Salvador. Since archaic times (before 1200 BCE) this has been occupied by speakers of the Mayan language group, and millions of people identified as Maya by that means continue to do so today (despite popular notions to the contrary, they have never \"disappeared\"). No prior knowledge of archaeology or art history is necessary. The course structure is one 3-hour session per week, consisting of a lecture followed by group discussion in seminar-style. Additionally, in Week 6 there will be a virtual tour of the new Mexico and Central American Gallery at Penn Museum. This will introduce the class to the issues of disseminating scholarship and building narratives that are accessible to the wider public.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ANTH 2150, LALS 2150\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2220 Art of Ancient Iran\n\nThis lecture course offers a survey of ancient Iranian art and culture from the painted pottery cultures of the Neolithic era to the monuments of the Persian Empire.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: MELC 2050, NELC 2050\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2221 The Early Bronze Age\n\nThis lecture course offers a survey of ancient Iranian art and culture from the painted pottery cultures of the Neolithic era to the monuments of the Persian Empire. Particular emphasis is placed on the Early Bronze Age.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: MELC 2055, NELC 2055\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2240 Art of Mesopotamia\n\nVisual expression was first developed in Mesopotamia in the same environment as the invention of writing. This lecture class will introduce the arts of the major periods of Mesopotamian History ending with the \"cinematic\" effects achieved by the Assyrian artists on the walls of the royal palaces. The strong connection between verbal and visual expression will be traced over the three millennia course of Mesopotamian civilization from the earliest periods through the imperial art of the Assyrians and Babylonians of the first millennium BCE. The class and the assignments will regularly engage with objects in the collections and on display in the galleries of the Penn Museum.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: MELC 0060, NELC 0060\n\nMutually Exclusive: ARTH 6240\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2250 Greek Art and Artifact\n\nThis lecture course surveys Greek art and artifacts from Sicily to the Black Sea from the 10th century BCE to the 2nd century BCE, including the age of Alexander and the Hellenistic Kingdoms. Public sculpture and painting on and around grand buildings and gardens, domestic luxury arts of jewelry, cups and vases, mosaic floors, and cult artefacts are discussed. Also considered are the ways in which heroic epic, religious and political themes are used to engaged viewers' emotions and served both domestic and the public aims. We discuss the relationships of images and things to space and structure, along with ideas of invention and progress, and the role of monuments, makers and patrons in Greek society.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: CLST 3401\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2260 Hellenistic and Roman Art and Artifact\n\nThis lecture course surveys the political, religious and domestic arts, patronage and display in Rome's Mediterranean, from the 2nd c. BCE to Constantine's 4th-c. Christianized empire. Our subjects are images and decorated objects in their cultural, political and socio-economic contexts (painting, mosaic, sculpture, luxury and mass-produced arts in many media). We start with the Hellenistic cosmopolitan culture of the Greek kingdoms and their neighbors, and late Etruscan and Republican Italy; next we map Imperial Roman art as developed around the capital city Rome, as well as in the provinces of the vast empire.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: CLST 3402\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2269 Classical Myth and the Image\n\nThe peoples of the ancient Greek and Roman worlds shared a vast body of stories about human and not-human beings set in a legendary deep past or supernatural present - \"Classical myth.\" Even their neighbor cultures took up those stories (or, sometimes, gave them). The stories as spoken, read, or performed turn up in surviving ancient literature. But from the very point when Greek myth began to be written down, those stories were told with images also. Many arts of the Mediterranean world explored myth at temples and sanctuaries, in civic spaces, theaters, parks, houses and palaces, for tombs and trophies - and even on the body upon weapons, clothes and jewelry. Love and desire and hate, hope and fear and consolation, war and peace, pleasure and excitement, power and salvation, the nature of this world and the cosmos, justice and duty and heroism, fate and free will, suffering and crime: mythological images probed the many domains of being human in order to move the emotions and minds of people (and of gods). Our class samples this story art to ask about its makers and viewers and contexts. What, also, were relations between images and texts and language? What about religious belief vs invention, truth vs fiction? What might it mean to look at this ancient art today, and to represent the old stories in post-ancient cultures? The class introduces ways of thinking about what images and things do; we will read in some relevant literature (drama, epic, novels, etc); and our Penn Museum will be a resource. No prerequisites--no prior knowledge of art history, archaeology, myth or Mediterranean antiquity is assumed.\n\nAlso Offered As: CLST 3416\n\nMutually Exclusive: AAMW 6269, ARTH 6269, CLST 5416\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2290 Roman Architecture and Urbanism\n\nArchitecture is the most striking legacy of Rome and the well-preserved remains of Roman buildings dominate our vision of the empire. Although Roman architecture has been studied since the Renaissance, it is only since the middle of the 20th century that it has come to be appreciated for the developments in concrete construction, which led to a revolution in the treatment of interior space and landscape architecture. Indeed, Rome’s architectural revolution radically changed both cities and countryside. Romans developed a wide range of new architectural forms and technological innovations in order to meet the increasingly sophisticated and diverse needs of their society. The purpose of the course is to shed light on Roman architectural and urban projects within their social, political, religious, and physical contexts. Throughout, the emphasis will be on concepts of organizing space, issues of structure, materials, decoration and proportion, the role of architecture in Roman society, and on the varied ways that architecture was employed by individuals and communities to express and enhance their status.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: CLST 3415\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2320 Byzantine Art and Architecture\n\nThis lecture course offers a wide-ranging introduction to the art, architecture, and material culture of Byzantium—a Christian, predominantly Greek-speaking civilization that flourished in the Eastern Mediterranean for over a thousand years. Positioned between the Muslim East and the Latin West, Antiquity and the Early Modern era, Byzantium nurtured a vibrant and highly sophisticated artistic culture. With emphasis placed upon paradigmatic objects and monuments, we will examine an array of artistic media, from mosaic and panel painting to metalwork, ivory carving, book illumination, and embroidery. We will consider the making, consumption, and reception of Byzantine art in a variety of contexts—political, devotional, ritual, and domestic. Topics include the idea of empire and its visual articulation; court culture; the veneration of images and relics; patronage, piety, and self-representation; authorship and artistic agency; materiality and the sensory experience of art; the reception of the \"pagan\" Greco-Roman past; and the changing nature of Byzantium's interactions with neighboring cultures.\n\nFall or Spring\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2330 Eastern Medieval Art and Architecture\n\nThis lecture course examines art and architecture in the Mediterranean, Eastern and Southeastern Europe, and the Christian Near East between the seventh and the fifteenth century. The focus is upon the Byzantine Empire and neighboring polities, including Bulgaria, Serbia, early Russia, Armenia, Georgia, and the Crusader states. The course introduces students to this immensely rich and multifaceted world through an exploration of key artworks and monuments, addressing in particular issues related to cross-cultural exchange, conflict, and appropriation.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2350 Introduction to Visual Culture of the Islamic World\n\nA one-semester survey of Islamic art and architecture which examines visual culture as it functions within the larger sphere of Islamic culture in general. Particular attention will be given to relationships between visual culture and literature, using specific case studies, sites or objects which may be related to various branches of Islamic literature, including historical, didactic, philosophical writings, poetry and religious texts. All primary sources are available in English translation.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: VLST 2350\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2370 Berlin: History, Politics, Culture\n\nWhat do you know about Berlin's history, architecture, culture, and political life? The present course will offer a survey of the history of Prussia, beginning with the seventeenth century, and the unification of the small towns of Berlin and Koelln to establish a new capital for this country. It will tell the story of Berlin's rising political prominence in the eighteenth century, and its position as a center of the German and Jewish Enlightenment. It will follow Berlin's transformation into an industrial city in the nineteenth century, its rise to metropolis in the early twentieth century, its history during the Third Reich, and the post-war cold war period. The course will conclude its historical survey with a consideration of Berlin's position as a capital in reunified Germany. The historical survey will be supplemented by a study of Berlin's urban structure, its significant architecture from the eighteenth century (i.e. Schinkel) to the nineteenth (new worker's housing, garden suburbs) and twentieth centuries (Bauhaus, Speer designs, postwar rebuilding, GDR housing projects, post-unification building boom). In addition, we will read literary texts about the city, and consider the visual art and music created in and about Berlin, and focus on Berlin's Jewish history. The course will be interdisciplinary with the fields of German Studies, history, history of art, urban studies, and German-Jewish studies. It is also designed as a preparation for undergraduate students who are considering spending a junior semester with the Penn Abroad Program in Berlin.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 1040, GRMN 1040, HIST 0821, URBS 1070\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2400 Medieval Art\n\nAn introductory survey, this lecture course investigates architecture, painting, sculpture, and the \"minor arts\" of the Middle Ages. Students become familiar with major monuments of the Romanesque and Gothic periods, primarily in Western Europe as well as relevant sites around the Mediterranean basin. Analyses of works emphasize cultural contexts, thematic content, and the function of objects and monuments. Discussions focus such themes as: the circulation of artists, materials and techniques; the relationships between art and power; anthropogenic impact of art making on the environment; the theological role of images; the explosion of secular visual culture; and the role of art in an interconnected world.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nMutually Exclusive: ARTH 6400\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2450 Gothic Architecture: Gold and Stone\n\nKey monuments of the Middle Ages, the Gothic cathedrals of Western Europe present a synthesis of the theological, economic, and social developments of the twelfth through fourteenth centuries. A harmonious marriage between technology and aesthetics, of political power and imagination, these immense and ingenious structures are as famous for their sculptural programs as they are for the liturgies that animated their spaces. Students will also be introduced to local uses of Gothic in Philadelphia architecture to better understand the lived experiences of these built manifestations of transcendence.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2451 Bones to Stones: Medieval Pilgrimage Culture\n\nDry bones, rotted flesh and discarded teeth — these were the heart of medieval pilgrimage culture. The bodily remains of the holy dead, saints and martyrs, spurred thousands of devout believers throughout the Middle Ages to travel to far off lands to venerate these abject traces. This lecture course, while anchored in Western Europe, will consider pilgrimage as a cross-cultural phenomenon, focussing on the resplendent arts, notably reliquaries, and architecture that developed to accommodate the desire to venerate bodily remains of the sacred.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2500 Michelangelo and the Art of the Italian Renaissance\n\nAn introduction to the work of the Renaissance artist Michelangelo (1475-1564)-his sculptures, paintings, architecture, poetry, and artistic theory-in relation to his patrons, predecessors, and contemporaries, above all Leonardo and Raphael. Topics include artistic creativity and license, religious devotion, the revival of antiquity, observation of nature, art as problem-solving, the public reception and function of artworks, debates about style, artistic rivalry, and traveling artists. Rather than taking the form of a survey, this course selects works as paradigmatic case studies, and will analyze contemporary attitudes toward art of this period through study of primary sources.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ITAL 2550\n\nMutually Exclusive: ARTH 6500, ITAL 6500\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2540 Titian and Venetian Painting\n\nThis lecture course examines the art and architecture of the Venetian Republic, with emphasis on the work of the renowned painter, Titian.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ITAL 2540\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2541 Caravaggio\n\nThis lecture course explores the artistic culture of Baroque Rome, with focus on the life and career of Caravaggio.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ENGL 2541, ITAL 2541\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2542 Brazilian Baroque\n\nThis lecture course explores the art, architecture, and visual culture of the Portuguese Empire with emphasis on Brazil and its relations with Africa and Asia.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: AFRC 2542, ENGL 2542, LALS 2542\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2559 European Baroque Art\n\nThis course surveys the art and architecture of seventeenth-century Europe, with particular attention paid to the visual culture of Italy, Spain, and the Northern and Southern Netherlands. Artists to be covered include Caravaggio, Bernini, Velazquez, Poussin, Rembrandt, Vermeer, and Rubens. While developments in form and style will be discussed, the class will examine art in context, particularly focusing on the historical, religious, political, geographical, and theoretical basis for these works. Themes covered will include the Counter-Reformation church, emergence of the art market, the creation of new genres, the academy, and global exploration.\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2580 Early Modern Japanese Art and the City of Edo\n\nStudy of the major art forms and architecture of Tokugawa (or Edo) period (1603-1868). In this lecture course, we will consider how the arts of this era occur within an increasingly urban and modern culture, particularly with regard to the city of Edo. Issues of the articulation of authority in the built environment, the reinvention of classical styles, and patronage will be raised. May include some visits to PMA, Penn Museum, or other local collections.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: EALC 1141\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2610 Northern Renaissance Art\n\nThis course critically examines concepts traditionally associated with the Renaissance by focusing on the exchange of artistic ideas throughout the Holy Roman Empire and across different media, such as the altarpieces of Jan van Eyck, the expressive drawings of Albrecht Durer and Hans Baldung Grien, the peasant studies of Pieter Bruegel and the prints of satirists who wished to remain anonymous. The material is organized thematically around four topics: religious art as piety and politics; antiquity as a source of tradition and imagination; the formulation of a public discourse that exposed social threats; and the distinctiveness of artistic claims of individual achievement. A motif throughout the course is the question of how the survival of fragments may be presented in museum contexts as parts standing in for an absent whole. We will also consider how historians approach designs for works of art now lost or never completed. Encouraging encounters with art and artifacts around the city, assignments focus on objects in Philadelphia collections.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: GRMN 1301\n\nMutually Exclusive: ARTH 6610\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2620 Early Netherlandish Painting: Angels, Demons, Nudes\n\nOver the course of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, painting in the Netherlands experienced dramatic technological advancements: the application of oil on panel allowed for an unprecedented richness of color; experiments with optics led to improved illusions of space; artists rendered light and reflections as never before. Did these advancements in depicting the natural world conflict with or enhance the portrayal of spiritual visions? Did realism pave the way for secular art? In this course, we will look critically at the relationship of science and art, tradition and innovation, the imagined and the experienced. The delicate preciousness of Jan van Eyck, the strange spaces of Petrus Christus, the bizarre hellscapes of Hieronymus Bosch, and the peasant festivals of Peter Bruegel will guide us through these themes.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: DTCH 2610\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2621 Prints and Politics: From the Early Modern Era to Now\n\nThis course offers a history of how mechanically reproducible images reshaped the social world. Beginning in the fifteenth century in Europe, these media connected new audiences across geographies by providing access to the same visual information. Prints launched propagandistic missions, fomented rebellion against authorities, and built networks of progressive thinkers who could envision alternative futures. Prints played a key role in developing what constituted news. Mass-distributed images delivered the mistreatment of the “Indians” by the Spanish and portrayed the packing of Africans on a slave ship. Goya’s etchings protested the repression of the Second of May uprising. The silkscreens of Andy Warhol repeated the image of police dogs attacking civil rights activists in Birmingham. Covering a five-hundred-year history, this course will focus on how printed images created communities and acted as exclusionary devices. We will train our eyes on examples from local collections and pay particular attention to Philadelphia activist groups and their places in these histories.\n\nMutually Exclusive: ARTH 6621\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2670 Latin American Art\n\nThe numerous traditions of Latin American art have been formed from the historical confluence of Indigenous, European, African, and Asian cultural traditions, each one impacting the others. This lecture course serves as an introduction to these hybrid New World art forms and movements by both providing a large chronological sweep (1492-present) and focusing on several specific countries, including Brazil, Mexico, Cuba, Peru, and Argentina.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: AFRC 2670, LALS 2670\n\nMutually Exclusive: ARTH 6670\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2679 Latinx Literature and Culture\n\nThis course offers a broad introduction to the study of Latinx culture. We will examine literature, theater, visual art, and popular cultural forms, including murals, poster art, graffiti, guerrilla urban interventions, novels, poetry, short stories, and film. In each instance, we will study this work within its historical context and with close attention to the ways it illuminates class formation, racialization, and ideologies of gender and sexuality as they shape Latinx experience in the U.S. Topics addressed in the course will include immigration and border policy, revolutionary nationalism and its critique, anti-imperialist thought, Latinx feminisms, queer latinidades, ideology, identity formation, and social movements. While we will address key texts, historical events, and intellectual currents from the late 19th century and early 20th century, the course will focus primarily on literature and art from the 1960s to the present. All texts will be in English.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 1260, ENGL 1260, GSWS 1260, LALS 1260\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2680 Art and Empire in India, 1750-1900\n\nThis course surveys transformations in visual culture between the Mughal and British empires in India from the mid-eighteenth through the nineteenth centuries. We shall consider changes in artistic production, patronage, publics, and viewing protocols in the contexts of the court and bazaar. We shall examine the emergence of new technologies and its impact on visual forms, media, and genres, focusing on the interplay of photography, print, and painting. We shall explore the role of institutions -the art school, the museum, and the archeological survey- and the professions and practices they engendered. We shall analyze how architecture and urban planning created new built environments and social relationships in colonial India. We shall view objects first-hand in the Penn Museum, Penn Libraries, and Philadelphia Museum of Art. This is a reading- and writing-intensive course. Students with a background in related disciplines such as literature, history, religion, anthropology, and South Asian Studies are welcome.\n\nAlso Offered As: SAST 2680\n\nMutually Exclusive: ARTH 6680, SAST 6680\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2699 Wolf Humanties Lecture\n\nThe Wolf Humanities Center is Penn’s interdisciplinary humanities research center based in the School of Arts & Sciences. Each year the Wolf Humanities Center hosts postdoctoral scholars as they conduct research and teach one course on the center’s annual theme.\n\nMutually Exclusive: ARTH 6699\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2700 The Modern City\n\nA study of the European and American city in the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries. Emphasis is placed on the history of architecture and urban design; political, sociological, and economic factors also receive attention. The class considers the development of London, St. Petersburg, Washington, Boston, Paris, Vienna and Philadelphia.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: URBS 2760\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2710 Modern Architecture, 1700-1900\n\nThe history of western architecture, ca. 1700-1900, when architecture was transformed to serve a world that had been reshaped by political and industrial revolutions. Topics to be considered include the Rococo, the English Garden, Palladianism, Romanticism, neo-classicism, the picturesque, the Greek and Gothic Revivals, and the search for a new style.\n\nFall or Spring\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2730 History of Photography\n\nA history of world photography from 1839 to the present and its relation to cultural contexts as well as to various theories of the functions of images. Topics discussed in considering the nineteenth century will be the relationship between photography and painting, the effect of photography on portraiture, photography in the service of exploration, and photography as practiced by anthropologists; and in considering the twentieth century, photography and abstraction, photography as \"fine art\", photography and the critique of art history, and photography and censorship.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2740 Facing America\n\nThis course explores the visual history of race in the United States as both self-fashioning and cultural mythology by examining the ways that conceptions of Native American, Latino, and Asian identity, alongside ideas of Blackness and Whiteness, have combined to create the various cultural ideologies of class, gender, and sexuality that remain evident in historical visual and material culture. We also investigate the ways that these creations have subsequently helped to launch new visual entertainments, including museum spectacles, blackface minstrelsy, and early film, from the colonial period through the 1940s.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: AFRC 2740, CIMS 2740, LALS 2740\n\nMutually Exclusive: ARTH 6740\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2750 Revolution to Realism: European Art, 1770-1870\n\nThis course surveys the major trends in the arts of Europe and its colonies in the tumultuous decades stretching from the French and Haitian revolutions in the late-eighteenth century to the rise of realism in the mid-nineteenth. Starting with Jacques-Louis David's revolutionary history paintings, we study Napoleonic representations of empire, Goya's imagery of violence, romantic representations of madness and desire, the origins of both nationalist and ecocritical landscape painting, the aesthetics of the industrial revolution, as well as the politicized realism of Gustave Courbet. Some of the themes that will be addressed include: the revolutionary hero, the birth of the public museum, the specters of slavery and colonialism in modern representation, the anxious masculinity of romanticism, the rise of industry and bourgeois culture, the beginnings of photography and caricature, the quest for national identity and, not least, the origins of modernist painting. Throughout, we will strive to recover the original radicalism of art's formal and conceptual innovations at times of profound political and social crisis.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nMutually Exclusive: ARTH 6750\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2760 Impressionism\n\nImpressionism opened the pictorial field to light, perception, science, modernity, bourgeoise leisure and famously the material qualities of paint itself. This course will survey the movement's major contexts and proponents--Manet, Monet, Morisot, Cezanne, Gauguin, Van Gogh, Rodin--from its origins in the 1860's to its demise in the 1890's, as well as its subsequent adaptions throughout the world until World War I. Particular attention is paid to the artists' critical reception and the historical conditions which allowed one nation, France, to claim the emergence of early Modernism so firmly for itself. The course also analyzes the effects of the rapidly changing social and cultural fabric of Paris, and its affects on artistic developments. We also look outside of France's borders to Germany and Britain.\n\nFall or Spring\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2770 The Rise of Modernity: Arts of the 19th Century\n\nThe nineteenth century is often considered as fast-paced, politically volatile and new-media obsessed as our own age. This course explores the nineteenth century's claim to have produced the first truly modern culture, focusing on the visual arts and metropolitan spaces of Europe and North America in their intellectual and social contexts. Stretching from the American and French Revolutions to the eve of World War I, topics to be covered include: the rise of capitalist and industrialist culture, art and revolutionary upheaval, global travel and empire, the origins of modernist art and architecture, and new media such as stereoscopes, iron and glass construction, and photography. Major artistic personalities of the age, from Jacques-Louis David and Gustave Courbet to Claude Monet and Vincent Van Gogh, and from Friedrich Schinkel and, Baron Haussmann to Frank Furness and Frank Lloyd Wright, are discussed. Each lecture will be followed by a brief period of discussion, and regular field trips take students to examine art and architecture first hand, in the museums and on the streets of Philadelphia.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2779 Reckoning: Art and Monuments in Europe and the Americas\n\nIn this course, we will examine how commemorative traditions in Europe and the Americas have been invented and contested since the nineteenth century. We will discuss why certain events in the past rather than others have been the object of commemoration; what these creations stood for originally; how their meanings have changed over the time; and the lessons, if any, these commemorative practices continue to teach us today. We also will examine the ways in which Europeans and Americans have protested, torn down old monuments, erected new ones, and turned to a wide variety of artistic forms to call into question stories about empire, fascism, communism, westward expansion and settler colonialism, enslavement, as well as military victory and loss. To answer these questions, we will focus on the history and theory of public monuments and sculpture, painting, commemorative sites, museum exhibitions, and film. The lecture topics will range from the Napoleonic Wars and Occupation, the American Civil War, German Unifications, National Socialism and Fascism, Holocaust Memorials and Museums, the Disappeared in Argentina, Spanish Civil War and Post-Francoism, Refugees and Migrants in the Mediterranean, as well as works by individual artists who have reflected on these historical events. Taught in English.\n\nAlso Offered As: GRMN 1240\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2780 American Art\n\nThis lecture course surveys the most important and interesting art produced in the United States (or by American artists living abroad) up through the 1950s. This period encompasses the history of both early and modern art in the U.S., from its first appearances to its rise to prominence and institutionalization. While tracking this history, the course examines art's relation to historical processes of modernization (industrialization, the development of transportation and communications, the spread of corporate organization in business, urbanization, technological development, the rise of mass media and mass markets, etc.) and to the economic polarization, social fragmentation, political conflict, and the cultural changes these developments entailed. In these circumstances, art is drawn simultaneously toward truth and fraud, realism and artifice, science and spirituality, commodification and ephemerality, nationalism and cosmopolitanism, individualism and collectivity, the past and the future, professionalization and popularity, celebrating modern life and criticizing it.\n\nFall or Spring\n\nMutually Exclusive: ARTH 6780\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2781 African American Art\n\nThis lecture course focuses on art, architecture, and visual culture made by peoples of African descent in the United States.\n\nFall or Spring\n\nAlso Offered As: AFRC 2781\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2810 Modern Architecture,1900-Present\n\nThe architecture of Europe and America from the late nineteenth century until the present is the central subject of this course, but some time is also devoted to Latin American and Asian architecture and to the important issues of modern city planning. Topics discussed include the Arts and Crafts movement, Art Nouveau, Expressionism, Art Deco, the International Style, and Post-modernism. The debate over the role of technology in modern life and art, the search for a universal language of architectural communication, and the insistent demand that architecture serve human society are themes that are traced throughout the course. Among the important figures to be considered are Frank Lloyd Wright, Walter Gropius, Le Corbusier, Louis Kahn, Robert Venturi, and Denise Scott Brown. The course includes weekly discussion sessions and several excursions to view architecture in Philadelphia.\n\nFall or Spring\n\nMutually Exclusive: ARTH 6810\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2850 Modern Art in Africa and Europe\n\nThe history of modern art is closely tied to and largely unfolds from the history of Western Imperialism. While the technologies made possible by colonial resource extraction produced new ways of looking, modern conceptions of the nation and how to represent it, developed in dialogue with racialized notions of the other. This course focuses on encounters between the cultures of Africa and Europe, from 1880 to 1960, and on the artistic practices that emerged on both continents as a result. Topics of special interest will include racial difference and the ramifications of colonialism, colonial masquerade, post-colonial monuments and memorials, the African influence on Dada and surrealism, Negritude and interwar Paris, colonial arts education, and the South African built environment under and after Apartheid.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: AFRC 2850\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2860 Modern Art: Picasso to Pollock\n\nEarly twentieth-century art in Europe is marked by a number of exciting transformations. This period witnessed the rise of abstraction in painting and sculpture, as well as the inventions of collage, photomontage, constructed sculpture, the ready made and found object, and performance art. Encounters with the arts of Africa, Oceania and other traditions unfamiliar in the West spurred innovations in media, technique, and subject matter. Artists began to respond to the challenge of photography, to organize themselves into movements, and in some cases, to challenge the norms of art through \"anti-art.\" A new gallery system replaced traditional forms of exhibiting and selling art, and artists took on new roles as publicists, manifesto writers, and exhibition organizers. This course examines these developments, with attention to formal innovations as well as cultural and political contexts.\n\nFall or Spring\n\nAlso Offered As: AFRC 2860\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2870 Postwar Art\n\nAt a time of seismic shifts in the American polity, postwar art has too often seemed above the fray. Even as New York came to replace Paris as the epicenter of art world in the post war period, the rapid succession of styles and movements from Abstract Expressionism to Neo-Dada, Pop Art, Minimalism, Conceptual Art and Happenings can seem to have their own internal logic, severed from the historical backdrop of the time. Some of the artists we'll consider include Pollock, Krasner, Rauschenberg, Johns, Warhol, Kusama, Martin, Lichtenstein, Bearden, Oldenburg, LeWitt, Chicago and Judd. In this course, we'll reexamine American art and art criticism in the postwar period alive to everything from the Cold War's virulent anti-communism to the rise of progressive liberation movements around race, ethnicity, sexuality, and gender. In the process, we will repeatedly underscore how art both served, and bit, the hand that fed it.\n\nAlso Offered As: GSWS 2870\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2871 Witnessing, Remembering, and Writing the Holocaust\n\nWitnessing, Remembering, and Writing the Holocaust What is a witness? What do the witnesses of the Shoah see, hear, experience? And how will they remember things, whether they are victims, perpetrators or bystanders? How are their memories translated into survivors' accounts: reports, fiction, art, and even music or architecture? And what does this teach us about human survival, and about the transmission of experiences to the next generation? The course will ask these questions by studying literature on memory and trauma, as well as novels, poetry, and non-fiction accounts of the Holocaust. We will also look at art work created by survivors or their children, and listen to video testimonies. Among the authors and artists discussed will be work by Primo Levi, Paul Celan, Jean Amery, Christian Boltanski, Daniel Libeskind. The course is supported by the USC Shoah Foundation Visual History Archives.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 1210, GRMN 1210, JWST 1210\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2872 Sex in the Museum\n\nThis course maps the often fraught intercourse between the history of sexuality and the history of museums, exhibitions, and curation. Bodies have long been the mainstay of art, but the attribution of sex to those bodies is a highly variable social phenomenon that tells us as much about the culture in question as it does about ourselves. Sex is thus in the eye of the beholder, defined by cultural, religious, scientific, and political norms, themselves often defined in and through a politics of visibility and exhibition. Beginning in the ancient world and moving into the present, this course studies the sexual politics of display, inherent but little studied, in the history of art history. From Renaissance battles over fig leaves to Enlightenment Europe’s titillation at what they saw as the unbridled eroticism of the ancient world to the culture wars of today, sex has long been a hidden motor of shifts in the art world. Whether coming to understand the so-called “Free Body Culture” of turn of the 20th century Europe with its very public nudity, to the explosion in nude performance in the 1960s to the culture wars of the 1980s in the USA over an art that addressed queerness, AIDS, and their intersection, we’ll see how often exhibitions have served as proxy for other social and political issues. In this course we’ll also come to understand the distinction between the nude, a category in art, and the naked, a category that was often said to corrupt art. Reading the latest work in queer, feminist and anti-racist scholarship, we will see how easily bodies on display can turn into sex, and conversely, slip as easily back from sex into bodies again.\n\nAlso Offered As: GSWS 2872\n\nMutually Exclusive: ARTH 6872\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2879 Eastern and Central European Art, 1917 to the Present\n\nThis is a survey course examining the prolific and significant artistic production of the region in four parts: the rise and fall of the Avant-Garde (1917-1934), the development of Socialist Realism (1934-1953), the embrace of post-war Nonconformism (1953-1989); and the proliferation of contemporary art (1989 - 2023). The course will include Russian artists, where applicable; however, it will intentionally recenter the narrative around artists from the satellite states (Poland, Hungary, Romania) and republics of the Soviet Union (Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Ukraine). In light of the war in Ukraine, additional emphasis on Ukrainian art will be provided. Subtopics will include architecture and graphic design; monuments and memory; colonialism and postcolonialism; feminism and LGBTQAI+; the environment; protest. All readings and lectures will be in English\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: REES 0230\n\nPrerequisite: n/a\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2889 Fashion and Modernity\n\nIn this class we will study the emergence of the Modernist concept of the \"new\" as a term also understood as \"new fashion.\" We will move back and forth in time so as to analyze today’s changing scene with a view to identify contemporary accounts of the \"new\" in the context of the fashion industry. Our texts will include poetry, novels, and films. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 1072, ENGL 1071, FREN 1071, GRMN 1065\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2900 Post War Japanese Cinema\n\nMizoguchi Kenji, Ozu Yasujiro, and Kurosawa Akira are recognized today as three of the most important and influential directors in Japanese cinema. In their films of the late 1940s and 1950s, these directors focused upon issues surrounding the human condition and the perception of truth, history, beauty, death, and other issues of the postwar period. This lecture course places their films in period context, and pays particular attention to the connections to other visual media, and to how \"art\" and \"history\" are being defined in the cinematic context. How other directors also took up these issues, and referred to the \"big three\" is also be discussed.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: CIMS 2900, EALC 1340\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2910 East Asian Cinema\n\nThis survey course introduces students to major trends, genres, directors, and issues in the cinemas of East Asian countries/regions, including Japan, Korea, China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Charting key developments over more than a hundred years from the early twentieth century to the present, this course examines films as aesthetic objects, asking questions about film form, narrative, and style. It also pays attention to the evolution of cinema as an institution (e.g. modes of production, circulation, and exhibition) in different cultural and political contexts. Weekly course materials will include both films (primary sources) and analytical readings (secondary sources). By the end of the course, students are expected to gain broad knowledge of East Asian cinema, develop skills of film analysis, and apply these skills to perform historically informed and culturally sensitive analysis of cinema. Prior knowledge of East Asian languages is NOT required.\n\nAlso Offered As: CIMS 2910, EALC 1116\n\nMutually Exclusive: ARTH 6910, EALC 5116\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2920 Digital and New Media Seminar\n\nThis course explores a particular topic in the study of digital and new media in an intensive and in-depth manner.

Large-scale color photographs and time-based installations in projections are everywhere. Looking back, we can see that much of the art making of the past 60 years has also been defined by this medium, regardless of the form it takes. Photographic images have inspired countless paintings, appeared in combines and installations, morphed into sculptures, drawings and performances, and served both as the object and the vehicle of institutional critique. They are also an increasinglyimportant exhibition site: where most of us go to see earthworks, happenings and body-art. This course is a three-part exploration of our photographic present.\n\nSpring\n\nAlso Offered As: ENGL 2639, GSWS 2940, VLST 2360\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2950 Global Film Theory\n\nThis course will provide an introduction to some of the most important film theory debates and allow us to explore how writers and filmmakers from different countries and historical periods have attempted to make sense of the changing phenomenon known as \"cinema,\" to think cinematically. Topics under consideration may include: spectatorship, authorship, the apparatus, sound, editing, realism, race, gender and sexuality, stardom, the culture industry, the nation and decolonization, what counts as film theory and what counts as cinema, and the challenges of considering film theory in a global context, including the challenge of working across languages. There will be an asynchronous weekly film screening for this course. No knowledge of film theory is presumed.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: CIMS 2950, COML 2950, ENGL 2900, GSWS 2950\n\nMutually Exclusive: ARTH 6950\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2951 Russian and East European Art and Cinema since 1900\n\nSince the turn of the twentieth century, art and politics have been uniquely intertwined in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, and its successor states. In the first decades of the century, across these territories, radical artistic movements such as suprematist abstraction, productivism, constructivist architecture, Bauhaus modernism, and, finally, Stalinist socialist realism sought to support revolutionary social transformation by literally reshaping the social world and human perception. Cinema, too, played its part—Vladimir Lenin, the Communist revolutionary founder of the Soviet Union, famously said that “of all the arts the most important for us is the cinema.” Propelled by this vision, the early USSR became a laboratory for cutting-edge film that sought to transform viewers into a new kind of person. Yet as the century wore on and Soviet socialism gave way first to state terror and then to moribund bureaucratism and cultural conservatism, it was non-comformist underground artists who took the lead in experimental and politically radical art in the region. Finally, in the post-Soviet era, art and cinema in these territories embraced democratic freedoms and market institutions, before finally, in some quarters, returning to revolutionary roots in response to rising authoritarianism. In this broad survey course, we will trace the history of art and film of the region through a series of case studies, including: Erik Bulatov, Sergei Eisenstein, Miloš Forman, Ilya and Emilia Kabakov, Oleg Kulik, Emir Kusturica, El Lilzitsky, Kazimir Malevich, Jiří Menzel, Kira Muratova, Pussy Riot, Aleksandr Rodchenko, Varvara Stepanova, Dziga Vertov, Andrzej Wajda, and others.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: CIMS 0274, REES 0240\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2954 Collecting Media\n\nThere are tens of billions of videos on YouTube; a similar number of photos on Instagram; seven million items in the Penn Libraries; remains from more than 12,000 people stored in the Physical Anthropology Section of the Penn Museum; roughly 250 surveillance cameras capturing footage across our campus; over one million seed varieties stored in the Svalbard Seed Vault; tens of thousands of meters of frozen samples in the U.S. Geological Survey’s Ice Core Facility — and, most likely, one huge, messy folder into which you dump all of your email. For thousands of years, cultural critics have lamented the onslaught of “information overload,” and for just as long, people have derived systems for collecting, organizing, storing, and facilitating access (or not) to media — whether Spotify playlists or cuneiform tablets or massive image files from NASA’s space telescopes. In this course we’ll consider the past, present, and future — as well as the pragmatics, politics, and aesthetics — of organizing media and information in archives, libraries, and other media assemblages. Through readings, listening and screening exercises, occasional field trips and guest lectures, a few low-stakes student presentations and group collaborations, fun design exercises, art explorations, and potential collaborations with external cultural heritage organizations, we’ll study why and how we collect media; why it matters for myriad scholarly fields, industries, creative practitioners, and communities; and how we might do it better. Because this new course is still in development, the assignments haven’t yet been finalized — but students can tentatively expect to write one or two short papers; share one low-pressure in-class presentation; participate in a few small (and ideally enjoyable) design workshops and group exercises; and, in lieu of a final exam, complete a written or creative final project.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: CIMS 2954, ENGL 2954\n\nMutually Exclusive: CIMS 6954\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 2960 Contemporary Art\n\nMany people experience the art of our time as bewildering, shocking, too ordinary (my kid could do that), too intellectual (elitist), or simply not as art. Yet what makes this art engaging is that it raises the question of what art is or can be, employs a range of new materials and technologies, and addresses previously excluded audiences. It invades non-art spaces, blurs the boundaries between text and image, document and performance, asks questions about institutional frames (the museum, gallery, and art journal), and generates new forms of criticism. Much of the \"canon\" of what counts as important is still in flux, especially for the last twenty years. And the stage is no longer centered only on the United States and Europe, but is becoming increasingly global. The course will introduce students to the major movements and artists since 1980, with emphasis on social and historical context, critical debates, new media, and the changing role of the spectator/participant.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nMutually Exclusive: ARTH 6960\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3000 Undergraduate Methods Seminar\n\nTopic varies from semester to semester. This course, required for history of art majors, acquaints students with a wide variety of historical and contemporary approachees to studying art, architecture, material culture, and visual culture.\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3020 Methods of Object Study\n\nThis immersive hands-on seminar introduces students to methods of analyzing the material, physical, and visual aspects of objects in a museum, gallery, or library context. Students will receive training in curatorial practices, close observational skills, and precise descriptive terminology for materials and techniques. They also will learn about essential tools of conservation and technical analysis.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3030 Introduction to Museums\n\nThis course introduces students to the history, theory and modern practices of museums. Using the resources of the Penn Museum and other Philadelphia museums, students will study curatorial practice, education, exhibition design and conservation, while exploring the theoretical and ethical issues confronted by museums. Particularly relevant for those interested in archaeology, anthropology, art history, cultural heritage and public education.\n\nFall or Spring\n\nAlso Offered As: CLST 3309\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3060 Venice Biennale Spiegel-Wilks Seminar\n\nFounded in 1895, the Venice Biennale (La Biennale di Venezia) is one of the art world’s most prestigious venues for contemporary art. In this seminar, we will consider the history of the Venice Biennale, its curatorial process for group shows, the role of national pavilions, and related topics, within the larger frame of the international art world. How contemporary artists cross boundaries, challenge expectations, and respond to the site itself are also key issues. The seminar focus will be adapted in each iteration according to the expertise of the instructor, and students will be funded to travel with the instructor to Venice over fall break as part of this site seminar. This course is open to History of Art Juniors and Seniors, admission by permission only.\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3070 The Rise of Image Culture: History and Theories\n\nToday images are everywhere; two centuries ago, they were rare. This seminar considers key historical and theoretical contexts for this change and its social consequences. With the help of some of the strongest critics and theorists of image culture, we will consider five interrelated aspects of the rise of image culture. - First, we will explore how new media and mechanical reproduction has changed the idea of the image over in the free market. - Second, we will explore how images operate through the psyche and gaze and how that operation is tied to social and political power. - Third, we will examine how representations make meaning and form identity in coded systems. - Fourth, we will consider the relationship between visual space and concepts of reality. And finally, we will interrogate how the physical and digital material that images are made from affects their meaning.\n\nSpring\n\nAlso Offered As: VLST 3030\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3071 What is an Image?\n\nThe course explores various concepts of images. It considers natural images (as in optics), images as artifacts, virtual images, images as representations, and works of art as images. Themes to include: the image controversy in cognitive science, which asks whether some cognitive representations are irreducibly imagistic; the question of whether some images resemble what they represent; the development of the concept of the virtual image and of three-dimensional images; the notions of pictorial representation and non-representational images in art. Readings from C. S. Peirce, Nelson Goodman, Robert Hopkins, Dominic Lopes, W. J. T. Mitchell, John Kulvicki, and Mark Rollins, among others.\n\nFall\n\nAlso Offered As: VLST 3050\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3100 Cinema and Socialism\n\nFilms from socialist countries are often labeled and dismissed as \"propaganda\" in Western democratic societies. This course complicates this simplistic view, arguing for the value in understanding the ties between socialist governments, the cinematic arts, and everything in between. We will examine films from past and present socialist countries such as the Soviet Union, China, North Korea, and Cuba, as well as films made with socialist aspirations. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: CIMS 3100, EALC 2314, ENGL 2934, REES 3770\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3120 Indian Art Seminar\n\nThis seminar addresses topics in the art of India from antiquity to the present emphasizing global connections and comparisons. Topics vary from year to year and might include the arts of the book in South Asia; Indian painting, 1100-now; history and theory of museums in the colony, 1750-1950; photography, cinema, and performance art in South Asia; and art, ecology, and environment in South Asia. We shall explore objects in area collections and incorporate special excursions and programs when possible. A background in South Asian studies or languages is not required.

We will begin by considering the terms that constitute the definition of the \"modern\" and the \"contemporary,\" asking how, by whom, and for whom these terms have been configured. By gaining a familiarity with the major styles, media, institutions, artists, and concepts over the twentieth century in East Asia, we will develop tools to analyze how contemporary artists are crossing boundaries, challenging the limits of nationalism, and dealing with shifting political and social grounds. We will take our analysis on site at the Venice Biennale, looking closely at how East Asian artists are participating in, as well as contesting, this influential international exposition. Students will make close studies of national pavilions as well as the international exhibition, generating analyses of these display spaces, and will produce a group website in response to the Biennale as an alternative virtual exhibition.

It is open to undergraduates only.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: AFRC 3180\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3200 Aegean Bronze Age Art Seminar\n\nIn this class, we will explore the art and cultures of the Aegean Bronze Age in Greece, a period from roughly 3,300-1,100 BCE. The geographic regions of the Greek Mainland, the Cycladic islands, and the island of Crete were home to complex cultural groups that formed a unique Bronze Age society. Topics will vary from semester to semester, and may include and not be limited to the examination of the architecture, pottery, wall paintings, stone carvings, jewelry, seals, weapons and other metalwork, and the iconography of these prehistoric arts. We will also delve into issues of the organization of society and the distribution of power, the role of women and men, trade and the unique position of the (rather small) Aegean world as it existed between two huge powerhouses of the ancient Mediterranean: the Ancient Near East and Egypt.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3230 Origins of Art / Origins of Writing\n\nEach of the earliest systems of writing had intimate and enduring ties to pictorial traditions. This seminar addresses the fundamental relationship between texts and visual imagery in the Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Chinese, and Maya traditions. The class will take a comparative approach to examine the parallel development of scripts and images, extending from their earliest beginnings to their on-going lives as mature systems. As the individual scripts became more capable of representing speech, the subject matter, composition, and function of images changed, and one goal of this class is to identify these processes. Emphasis will be put on seeing text and image as collaborative and interactive constructions, in which parts of a single message can be encoded and presented in different ways. The class will make extensive use of the collections and the curatorial expertise of the Penn Museum.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ANTH 2330, MELC 3070, NELC 3070\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3250 Classical Mythology in the Western Tradition\n\nHow and why have artists and viewers, from the Middle Ages to the global present, so often confronted ancient Greek and Roman stories? This undergraduate seminar makes use of local museum collections.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: CLST 3409\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3251 Arts of the Roman House, Villa, and Palace Seminar\n\nPrivate and public met in the elite Roman dwelling; this undergraduate seminar looks at the rich record of things and images, in multiple media, and in their spatial contexts, among which Romans chose to live.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: CLST 3410\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3252 Violence in Ancient Mediterranean Art Seminar\n\nViolence, physical and emotional, pervades the images of the ancient Mediterranean. This undergraduate seminar asks why, how and to what end that occurred; in these and any cultures, why do people look at such images?\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: CLST 3411\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3290 Luxury in the Greco-Roman World: Self-Identity and Self-Indulgence\n\nThis undergraduate seminar examines the physical contexts, artifacts and visual narratives of the Greek and Roman cultures that attest the idea of luxury. The topics of the course look at the ways in which Greeks and Romans, on the one hand, defined their personhood through the representations of the self and the other in the arts, and, on the other hand, indulged in their personal manifestations and social interactions. The course is organized in two thematic sections: self-identity (the self, the other, sexuality, death) and self-indulgence (dressing and accessorizing, dining, exercising and bathing, having fun: entertainment and educated leisure lifestyles).\n\nFall or Spring\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3291 Greek Art, Architecture, and Urbanism\n\nThis undergraduate seminar explores key themes in Greek Art, Architecture and Urbanism. Topics vary from semester to semester and may include: “The Greek city,” “The architecture and sculpture of Greek temples,” “The architecture and landscape of Greek sanctuaries.”\n\nFall or Spring\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3292 Roman Art, Architecture, and Urbanism\n\nThis undergraduate seminar explores key themes in Roman Art, Architecture and Urbanism. Topics vary from semester to semester and may include: “Houses and Society,” “The Roman city,” “Pompeii and Herculaneum,” “Designing for luxury: Roman villas and houses,” “The architecture and landscape of Roman sanctuaries.”\n\nFall or Spring\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3305 Topography and Monuments of Ancient Rome\n\nAn intensive exploration of Rome's urban topography during the Republican and Imperial periods (6th c. B.C. through 4th c. A.D.) Using archaeological and textual sources, including the Etruscan and Roman collections of the Penn Museum, the goal will be to reconstruct the built environment and decoration of Rome over the course of a millennium. Of interest to students of classics, archaeology, art history, and architecture. Some familiarity with Rome will be a plus, but is not required.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: CLST 3305\n\nMutually Exclusive: CLST 5305\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3320 The Byzantine Art of Devotion Seminar\n\nFar from being exclusively a matter of belief and inner feeling, religion in the Byzantine world was intensely material. Icons, reliquaries, illustrated books, and other objects that we now consider under the rubric of “Byzantine art” played a crucial role in shaping one’s relationship and interaction with the realm of the sacred. This undergraduate seminar offers an in-depth exploration of the material culture of personal piety in Byzantium. Larger topics to be addressed include icon veneration, the cult of saints and relics, pilgrimage, monasticism, and mysticism. Special consideration is given to the ways in which personal devotion objects functioned as instrument of self-formation.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3321 Portraiture Seminar\n\nWhat does it mean to depict a person? And how might culturally specific notions of personal identity and subjectivity inform such an endeavor? This undergraduate seminar takes a broad view of the forms, functions, and meanings of portraiture in the Western tradition. Images across a wide gamut of media, from monumental sculptures to portrait miniatures, will be examined alongside other signs of identity, including seals, heraldic devices, inscriptions, and insignia.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3330 Material Christianities\n\nWhat can objects tell us about Christianity? How might a lavish mosaic, a withered body part, a dark crypt, or a pilgrim's oil lamp challenge and complicate visions of the past extracted from texts? This course investigates the first thousand years of Christianity through the lens of material culture. The history of Christianity - from its nebulous beginnings in Palestine to its recognition as the official religion of the Roman Empire and subsequent expansion - is often narrated from a perspective that privileges the writings of elite men. To capture the rich diversity in Christian experience and expression, we will turn to the material practices of religion and explore how things, places, and bodily acts shaped what it meant to be Christian. Building on insights drawn from archaeology, art history, anthropology, and religious studies, we will seek to recover the experiences of diverse and often marginalized subjects and communities, and in the process, will problematize the categories of religion, authority, and identity. Regular visits to the Penn Museum and other collections in Philadelphia will complement lectures and group discussions.\n\nAlso Offered As: RELS 3330\n\nMutually Exclusive: ARTH 5330, RELS 5330\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3400 Medieval Art Seminar\n\nThis undergraduate seminar explores through the lens of more focused topics the arts produced in the European Middle Ages, and in adjacent territories, from 800 to 1400. Close readings of primary and secondary sources drive class time, and the rich resources of the Philadelphia area are brought to bear, including the Penn Museum, the Free Library of Philadelphia, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Glencairn Museum, Bryn Athyn, etc. Students will work on skills relating to research, oral presentations, and academic writing.\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3401 Topics in Medieval Art\n\nTopics vary from semester to semester. For the Spring 2021 semester, the topic will be: Art in the Time of Dante. 2021 marks the 700th anniversary of the death of Dante Alighieri (1265-1321). While his Divine Comedy is the pinnacle of medieval literary arts, Dante was himself interested in the masterpieces of visual arts of his own time -- in Italy and abroad. Prominent artists like Cimabue and Giotto are mentioned in his texts, as well as such notorious figures linked to artistic production as the usurer Reginaldo degli Scrovegni or the mercenary Castruccio Castracani. Dante witnessed some of the most dramatic events of the Middle Ages, from the transfer of the papacy to Avignon to the salacious affair of the Tour de Nesle in France -- together we will examine the visual culture of this tumultuous time.\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3430 Late Medieval and Renaissance France: Art, Politics, and Power\n\nThis undergraduate seminar will examine the commission, production, and display of art at the Valois courts from the start of the Hundred Years War with England in the 1330s to the death of Francis I in 1547. During these two centuries, conflict and conquest shaped the making of artwork in profound and sometimes unexpected ways: precarious dynastic claims could be substantiated through carefully crafted images, while foreign artists (including Rosso Fiorentino, Francesco Primaticcio, and Leonardo da Vinci) could be called upon to boost the monarch’s prestige. Investigating the role played by objects in cultural diplomacy and propaganda, this course will examine works in a wide variety of techniques including easel painting, manuscript illumination, tapestry, armor, and metalwork, without neglecting less tangible art forms such as feasting, chivalric tournaments, and royal processions. Topics will include the art of the gift, female patronage, the interaction between text and image, and the role of artists in shaping a royal visual identity. The course will include a visit to the Philadelphia Museum of Art and an illuminated manuscript handling session at the Free Library of Philadelphia.\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3500 Topics in Southern Renaissance Art\n\nTopic varies from semester to semester. For the Spring 2021 semester, the topicwill be: Chiaroscuro. In this seminar we will explore the artistic technique known as \"chiaroscuro,\" the contrast between light and shadow so as to produce effects of volume and relief. While we will grapple with chiaroscuro as deployed in architecture, drawings, and prints, our focus will be all the tenebrist paintings of Caravaggio. If the lit bodies in Caravaggio's paintings project out boldly in relief, does anything remain and speak in the surrounding darkness?\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3510 Writing About Art Seminar\n\nWhat does it mean to write about art? What are the historical origins of this undertaking? How does language mediate the intellectual, somatic, and cultural rapport between the viewing self and the physical object? As an initial response to these questions we will examine the writings of the Tuscan artist and critic Giorgio Vasari (1511-1574), the biographer of such renowned artists as Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello, and Michelangelo. We will also read the letters of famous artists from the early modern period, and examine the theoretical forays of artists such as Albrecht DÃ?rer, who attempted to sketch the relationship between the memory and the imagination. Finally, we will look to examples of works of art for how we might read visual images as expressive of theories about what are is and what it can do.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ENGL 0549, GRMN 1302, ITAL 3610\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3511 Brazilian Baroque Seminar\n\nThis undergraduate lecture explores the art, architecture, and visual culture of the Portuguese Empire with emphasis on Brazil and its relations with Africa and Asia.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: AFRC 3511, LALS 3511\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3512 Caravaggio Seminar\n\nThis seminar explores the artistic culture of Baroque Rome, with focus on the life and career of Caravaggio. This course is open to graduate and undergraduate students.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ITAL 3612\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3560 Freud's Objects\n\nHow do we look at objects? And which stories can objects tell? These are questions that have been asked quite regularly by Art Historians or Museum Curators, but they take a central place within the context of psychoanalytic studies as well. The seminar \"Freud's Objects\" will offer an introduction to Sigmund Freud's life and times, as well as to psychoanalytic studies. We will focus on objects owned by Freud that he imbued with special significance, and on Freud's writings that focus on specific objects. Finally, we will deal with a re-interpretation of the \"object\" in psychoanalytic theory, via a discussion of texts by British psychoanalysts such as Melanie Klein and Donald Winnicott.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: CLST 3509, COML 2052, ENGL 1425, GRMN 1015\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3620 The Invention of Communication\n\nThis undergraduate seminar covers a history of print from Gutenberg to the twenty-first century.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3621 Prints and Politics: From the Early Modern Era to Our Times\n\nBy the late fifteenth century, mechanically reproducible images were reshaping the social world. Connecting new audiences across geographies through access to the same visual information, prints launched propagandistic missions, fomented rebellion against authorities, and built networks of progressive thinkers who could envision alternative futures. Prints played a key role in developing what constituted news. Mass-distributed images delivered the mistreatment of the “Indians” by the Spanish and portrayed the packing of Africans on a slave ship. Goya’s etchings protested the repression of the Second of May uprising, while the silkscreens of Andy Warhol repeated the image of police dogs attacking civil rights activists in Birmingham. Covering a five-hundred-year history, this course will focus on how printed images created communities and acted as exclusionary devices. We will train our eyes on examples from local collections.\n\nAlso Offered As: ENGL 2621\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3630 Early Modern Art Seminar\n\nThis seminar takes a thematic approach to the study of European art produced between 1400-1800. Topics, which change annually, include such offerings as \"Art and Law;\" \"Spectacle, Punishment, and Surveillance;\" \"Prints and Politics\" and \"The Subject of Nature.\" In a given year, we will approach a corpus of objects, images, and performances through a study of three kinds of text: primary sources, secondary art-historical scholarship, and critical theory. Discussions will convene around local museum and library collections.\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3730 American Art Seminar\n\nThis undergraduate seminar focuses on the art of the United States, the European American colonies that preceded it, and the increasingly diverse and complicated communities that have come to characterize the modern era. Topics may explore representational, material, and aesthetic aspects of painting, sculpture, and photography; the social and political roles of mass visual and material culture; and histories of exhibitions and museums. The history of artistic genres (portraiture, history, and landscape painting, still life); representational structures (common themes and types); and reproduction technologies (photography, sculpture casting, and printmaking) throughout the history of this nation may also be featured. The class is reading- and discussion-based. It is recommended for art history and other humanities majors and minors.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3749 In/Visible: Asian American Cultural Critique\n\nThis interdisciplinary seminar examines how popular cultural representations frame Asian Americans as either invisible or hypervisible—our explorations will move across race and national origin, language and class, gender and sexuality. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\n\nAlso Offered As: ASAM 2272, ENGL 2272, GSWS 2272\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nARTH 3750 Topics in 19th-Century Art\n\nTopic varies from semester to semester. For the Spring 2022 semester, the topic will be: World's Fairs. This seminar will study the manifold novelties first displayed at the nineteenth and early-twentieth century World's Fairs, stretching from 1851 to 1915. Such events-first held in cities like London and Paris, but eventually all over the world-chronicled the period's innovations in art, technology, ethnography, and science. Many of the most crucial inventions were first shown to the publ"
