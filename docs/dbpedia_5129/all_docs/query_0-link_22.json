        "text": "Citation preview\n\nUnderstanding Korean Film\n\nFilm viewing presents a unique situation in which the film viewer is unwittingly placed in the role of a multimodal translator, finding themselves entirely responsible for interpreting multifaceted meanings at the mercy of their own semiotic repertoire. Yet, researchers have made little attempt, as they have for literary texts, to explain the gap in translation when it comes to multimodality. It is no wonder then that, in an era of informed consumerism, film viewers have been trying to develop their own toolboxes for the tasks that they are faced with when viewing foreign language films by sharing information online. This is particularly the case with South Korean film, which has drawn the interest of foreign viewers who want to understand these untranslatable meanings and even go so far as learning the Korean language to do so. Understanding Korean Film: A Cross-​Cultural Perspective breaks this long-​awaited ground by explaining the meaning potential of a selection of common Korean verbal and non-​verbal expressions in a range of contexts in South Korean film that are often untranslatable for English-​speaking Western viewers. Through the selection of expressions provided in the text, readers become familiar with a system that can be extended more generally to understanding expressions in South Korean films. Formal analyses are presented in the form of in-​depth discursive deconstructions of verbal and non-​verbal expressions within the context of South Korea’s Confucian traditions. Our case studies thus illustrate, in a more systematic way, how various meaning potentials can be inferred in particular narrative contexts. Jieun Kiaer is professor of Korean Language and Linguistics at the University of Oxford. She publishes widely on East Asian translation, with particular emphasis on Korean translation. Her publications include The Routledge Course in Korean Translation (2018) and Korean Literature through the Korean Wave (with Anna Yates-​ Lu, 2019). Kiaer is also the series editor for Routledge Studies in East Asian Translation. Loli Kim is a DPhil researcher in Korean Studies at the University of Oxford. Her work explores multimodal, semantic, and cross-​cultural communication, particularly from a Korean perspective. Her current research focuses on the translation of multimodal meaning-​making processes in South Korean film that become ‘untranslatable’ for Anglophone European viewers, with special focus on socio-​pragmatic verbal and non-​verbal behavioural expressions.\n\nRoutledge Studies in East Asian Translation\n\nSeries Editors: Jieun Kiaer, University of Oxford, UK Amy Xiaofan Li, University College London, UK\n\nRoutledge Studies in East Asian Translation aims to discuss issues and challenges involved in translation between Chinese, Japanese, and Korean as well as from these languages into European languages with an eye to comparing the cultures of translation within East Asia and tracking some of their complex interrelationships. Most translation theories are built on translation between European languages, with only few exceptions. However, this Eurocentric view on language and translation can be seriously limited in explaining the translation of non-​European literature and scholarship, especially when it comes to translating languages outside the Indo-​European family that have radically different script forms and grammatical categories, and may also be embedded in very different writing traditions and cultures. This series considers possible paradigm shifts in translation theory, arguing that translation theory and practice need to go beyond European languages and encompass a wider range of literature and scholarship.

Soon, however, the pandemic started, upending everything. Now, just a year later, South Korean cinema reached another milestone when Yuh-​jung Youn won the Oscar for best supporting actress for her role in Minari, becoming the first Korean actor to win an Academy Award. What a year we have had! We wish to express our gratitude first and foremost to our friends, colleagues, and families, who bore with us during 2020 while we persevered with this book in spite of the disruptions caused by the global pandemic. We are particularly grateful to Dr. Janina Wildfeuer and Dr. John Bateman, whose work on multimodal film analysis and the semantics of film has been instrumental in our research, underpinning much of this book. We are also grateful to those who attended talks we gave at the Korean Education Centre and Korean Cultural Centre. Thanks also to Frank Davey, Derek Driggs, and Sophie Hwang for their help at various stages, providing wonderful editorial help and helpful comments, and to Professor Taehoon Kim, whose insights and feedback were incredibly helpful. We are also grateful to our publishers at Routledge, and especially to Ellie Auton and Andrea Hartill, for giving us the opportunity to publish this book, and for their ongoing patience throughout the chaos of 2020 and the first half of 2021.

Romanisation conventions There have been a vast number of attempts at finding a system which effectively romanises the Korean language, and as a result more than 20 different romanisation systems have appeared in printed media. Currently, there are three main romanisation systems in place, and it is important that we explain our choice for prioritising certain systems of romanisation over others and what purpose this serves in making this book accessible beyond academia. The longest standing amongst them is the McCune–​Reischauer system (MR), which was the first official romanisation system in Korea and was the most popular of the twentieth century. However, in recent years, the system has fallen out of favour mainly because of the use of diacritic marks (which also present challenges when typing), and consequently difficulty when pronouncing certain words. Furthermore, an apostrophe (’) is used to differentiate between consonants, as read in k, t, p, ch, and k’, t’, p’, ch’. For this reason, the main users of this system are historians for academic purposes. Then there is the Yale system, which presents Korean in a morphophonemic structure. This system is useful in the linguistic evaluation of morphemes, and thus makes the system popular among academics in linguistic publications. However, again, it is not as useful when attempting to pronounce Korean words. Finally, the Revised Romanisation system (RR) was developed by the National Academy of Korean language with the intention to redress the problems mentioned in the McCune-​Reischauer system, namely using diacritic marks. The system succeeded in distinguishing between certain vowels and consonants when reading hangeul (한글) without the reliance of said diacritic marks. The (RR) is currently the official romanisation system used in Korea. Along with these three methods developed by non-​Koreans, there is now another romanisation method established by non-​Korean fandoms, which rather than being systematically ‘worked out’, has evolved through popular use and can therefore be understood as being a more natural and intuitive solution. This is becoming increasingly popular. Out of the three systems already mentioned, it is closest to (RR).\n\nnewgenprepdf\n\nxxii Preliminaries In this book we have used (RR), wherever possible, which we have then joined with the forms of romanisation popularised by Korean pop culture fandom. We have taken this route to make Korean words and phrases pronounceable for readers or viewers, regardless of their knowledge of the Korean language. Hence, when they view Korean films, these words can be easily recognised without need for an academic foundation or a prior level of fluency. We follow the romanisation of Korean words with the hangeul in brackets followed by the English translation, on every first occasion of a given word or phrase’s use. We take a similar approach when it comes to film titles and film directors. In the main text, a film title will only be referred to by its romanised Korean after its first full mention. The only exception is with film still captions, where the titles are presented on every occasion with the romanised Korean title first, followed by the title in hangeul in brackets, and then the English title. The glossary tables also use the order of romanised Korean, hangeul, English, and then the explanation for use (e.g., for prefixes and suffixes). In one of the case studies, there are a limited number of Japanese words used. These are again presented first with romanised Japanese, followed by the word or phrase written in the Japanese syllabary hiragana in brackets (which is also labelled as hiragana to avoid confusion with the Korean), and then by the English translation. Confucian cultural concepts and titles of Confucian texts that were originally written in Classical Chinese, in this book are presented in Korean. Finally, when referring to Korean film directors and actors, we place their family name first before their forename, as is the norm in Korea.\n\n1 Introduction\n\n1.1 The global age of Korean film In February 2020, Bong Joon-​ho’s1 2019 film Gisaengchung (기생충), popularly known by its English film title Parasite, made Academy Awards history by becoming the first foreign language film to win the prestigious Best Picture Award. The moment signified an important shift in the South Korean (hereafter Korean) film (K-​film) industry from marginal to global phenomenon, serving to confirm K-​film’s move into the global mainstream and thus into the daily lives of many English-​speaking viewers. It was not a move out of the blue; only two years earlier, Park Chan-​wook’s 2016 film Agassi (아가씨), popularly known outside of Korea as The Handmaiden, was the first Korean film to win a BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television Arts) Award. Also, in recent years, K-​films have become increasingly accessible via a wide range of streaming services, Netflix being the most significant. In 2019, it was reported that 61 million Netflix viewers were registered in the US, and out of the remaining 63% of viewers across the globe five million were registered in the UK and 14.4 million in Australia (Iqbal, 2020). This is a remarkable feat considering the K-​film industry’s infamous self-​ isolation from international film markets until the 1980s and the global dominance of Hollywood since early in film history (An et al., 2006). It is no wonder that K-​film’s dramatic transformation in respect to both its product and rising global popularity has fittingly come to be known as the ‘Korean Film Wave’ (Yecies & Shim, 2016; Dal, 2016; Choi, 2010), a faction of the popular culture phenomenon the ‘Korean Wave’ (K-​Wave), which is an English translation of the Sinitic-​origin neologism hallyu (한류). The K-​Wave is a blanket term that encompasses numerous cultural products which increased in international popularity when the Korean government strategically opted for the globalisation of its popular culture in order to generate soft power. This has been the only popular culture movement outside of the US to be successful in exporting the majority of its major cultural products simultaneously (Korean pop music (K-​Pop), television dramas (K-​Drama), food (K-​ Food) and cosmetics (K-​Beauty)) (Lee, 2011). Among K-​Wave factions, film has been one of the most important, with its soft power evidently increasing DOI: 10.4324/9781003089896-1\n\n2 Introduction since the K-​Wave first broke and today the faction that has gained the most formal, global recognition.\n\n1.2 The one-​inch barrier K-​film’s shift into the global mainstream makes now a prime time to start moving towards a richer understanding of meaning in K-​film, as with more fans worldwide there is less of a need to domesticate the English subtitles to attract foreign viewers. The Korea Foundation recently estimated the number of fans of Korean popular culture to be around 89 million across 113 countries (Elfving-​Hwang, 2019), and in actuality the number in social media seems to be even greater. In his acceptance speech for the Academy Award for Gisaengchung, Bong Joon-​ho referred to the barrier of subtitles when he stated, ‘once you overcome the one-​inch-​tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films’. His statement, aimed at the continued ‘transnationalism’ of Korean cinema (Dal, 2019), and indeed all foreign language films, encouraged viewers to give subtitled films a chance. However, issues regarding foreign films are more than merely the inconvenience of having to read subtitles. For non-​Korean, particularly English-​ speaking audiences, K-​ films bring considerable challenges due to their vast differences in linguistic and cultural heritage, and as a result, subtitles cannot realistically provide definitions of all the meanings expressed. There simply isn’t equivalent linguistic or cultural means nor the capacity in the English subtitle for their explanation in every case. Thus, we may ask, what are audiences who lack knowledge of Korean language and culture missing? What exactly does this one-​inch barrier consist of, and what tools are needed to break through it?\n\n1.3 Film viewers seek visibility Untranslatable meanings are not only an issue for researchers but increasingly a matter that interests the public, who in a time of informed consumerism want to know exactly what they are watching. The subject has been raised in numerous online articles and blogs, many of the most recent of which having been stimulated by the release of Gisaengchung due to foreignisation in its English subtitles and the symbolism in the film (e.g., Yang, 2020; Cho, 2020; ZenKimchi, 2020; Maffei, 2020; York, 2019). Articles by Korean K-​film viewers appear keen to help foreign fans’ understanding of K-​film rather than allowing meaning to be misinterpreted, used to justify broad generalisations about East Asian cultures, or missed entirely. For example, in an online article Cho (2020) describes the invisibility she encountered viewing Parasite as a bilingual Korean American. Cho immediately noticed what she describes as ‘the peculiarity of translating Korean into English text’, followed by her realisation that ‘The subtitles are not for me, […] they’re for American audiences’. Cho writes:\n\nIntroduction 3 I wanted to tap my boyfriend on the shoulder to explain this in the theatre. I wanted to pause the film and explain to this mostly white audience in the (un-​ironically named) Oriental Theatre that this film isn’t just funny and unconventional when characters call each other ‘sis’ in the middle of a violent argument. Further, the proactivity of K-​film viewers hasn’t merely involved blogs and articles. Viewers from around the world have even been learning the Korean language in order to understand the meanings beyond the subtitle, often using K-​film as a means of doing so. It has become so prevalent among Korean film (and also Korean drama) fans that streaming sights have caught on to this and begun providing services for it. For example, Viki.com, which focuses on Asian content, provides a range of features to cater to K-​film viewers’ desire to learn both the languages and the cultures of the films they are viewing: Many of Viki’s viewers aren’t native speakers of the languages of the programs they watch, and Viki also engages these users by offering them the chance to pick up the languages. In LEARN mode they can study Chinese, Korean, Japanese, by referring to dual English and foreign-​language subtitles, by pausing programs to repeat words, and also searching for words and phrases so they can hear them in different ways, in different languages. Movies and TV are one of the most important and potent ways students can employ for learning about language and culture, and Viki makes the most of the opportunity. (Cain, 2017)2 The motivation of K-​film fans to understand what they are viewing is also evident in the increase of Korean words that are being absorbed into World Englishes, which makes K-​fandoms stand out amongst fandoms in general as particularly semiotically productive. Fandoms select and use Korean words to create an environment that is stylised by Korean culture, through which they create empathic solidarity between members. Moreover, these words are not limited to nouns or unknown concepts in English (e.g., chaebol, bibimbap, doenjang, gochujang, soju), and their usage is becoming increasingly formalised with some words now even appearing in the Oxford English Dictionary.\n\n1.4 The importance of understanding Korean interactions The invisible meanings that are the subject of online articles like Cho’s are often socio-​pragmatic ones, which are unavoidable in K-​films as they are fundamental in Korean interactions. English-​speaking viewers neither have the repertoire nor the cultural context for interpreting these meanings. While Korean is a socio-​pragmatically rich language, highly sensitive to the relationship between speaker and hearer, the English language and ‘Western’ culture\n\n4 Introduction in general is not. Korean expressions are multifaceted in how they encode layers of information, such as the hierarchy between interlocutors, the basis of their relationship, and what they think or feel towards each other. This sensitivity is present at every moment of Korean interactions, for interlocutors are required to constantly modulate their expressions as the relationship develops (Kiaer, 2017 and 2019). Non-​verbal expressions are no exception to this; from posture and eye gaze to haptic gestures, touch, and traditions such as bowing, they play a primary role in expressing these socio-​pragmatic meanings in Korean. This means that in Korean film English-​speaking viewers encounter multimodal invisibility (Kiaer & Kim, 2021). The socio-​pragmatic differences in the English and Korean languages and non-​verbal expressions can be demonstrated using a simple scenario. Suppose a Korean child hears a knock on the door and is about to ask who it is. The child will first consider whether the person outside of the door is an adult or a child of the same age. In Korea, even for the simplest of utterances one must be mindful of whom they are addressing. One must determine their relationship to the other party before interacting, and in order to do so often the most important criteria for determining interpersonal relations are the dimensions of power and intimacy. Balancing the two is not easy and misjudging them can result in tension and even conflict. In the situation described above, for instance, the child knows they can say the interrogative pronoun nugu (‘who’), but can’t decide whether it is appropriate to say nugu-​ya (‘who is it?’ for friends or siblings) or nugu-​seyo (‘who is it?’ for adults) without knowing who is behind the door. Even for Koreans, who are used to this system, establishing the correct interpersonal relations and consequently finding the appropriate verbal and non-​verbal tools can be challenging. Therefore, these expressions are incredibly difficult for English-​speaking viewers, because English is much less sensitive to hierarchy and intimacy. In English, basic phrases like ‘Who is it?’, ‘It is raining’, ‘It is 2 o’clock’, or ‘I need to eat’ do not need to be altered depending on the hearer. For instance, in English, when answering the door, the child would not need to make the same considerations as the Korean child did in our example. The English-​speaking child would simply ask ‘Who is it?’ Thus, Korean socio-​pragmatic expressions cause considerable untranslatability and require a cross-​cultural approach to translation.\n\n1.5 What you will find in this book This book provides a starting point for English-​speaking Western viewers who wish to reach beyond the one-​inch barrier of subtitles to explore what’s really happening in K-​films. Whether they be researchers requiring a framework to analyse K-​films or fans, this book provides the tools needed to translate the often-​untranslatable Korean multimodal expressions. While this book can be helpful for English-​speaking viewers in general, it is important to clarify from the offset that the invisibility addressed in this\n\nIntroduction 5 book will not necessarily always apply to English speakers who are not from Western cultures. English is now widely spoken, even by large numbers of people in non-​Western regions such as Singapore and South Africa. While these viewers may encounter some of the same invisibiles when it comes to linguistics, due to their cultural differences form Western regions the forms of invisibility they experience can vary. In this regard, there is a clear limitation in defining Anglophone (Anglo) readership and even in the use of terms that refer to English speakers, because it is not simple to address the cultural diversity that accompanies the use of the English language. Here, we aim to provide a foundation, by focusing our attention on Western culture that plays a key role in the Eurocentrism that has traditionally prevented translation, upon which microscales can later be added in order to build a truly cross-​ cultural, international perspective on meaning in world films. This book is organised into four key sections. The first section in Chapter 2 provides the theoretical background of this work, which brings together strands from national film studies, Korean film studies, Korean-​ English translation, Korean linguistic and cultural studies, and multimodal film analysis. In the second section in Chapter 3 we lay out the Korean cultural context –​Confucianism and in particular a key part of its fundament the Samgang Oryun (‘the three bonds and five key relations’) –​which underpin Korea’s system of interpersonal relations, with focus given largely to the Oryun (‘the five key relations’). The main hierarchical factors that we consider are age, position (primarily professional and familial), class (pre-​modern Korea)/​ socio-economic status (SES) (contemporary Korea), and the implication of gender and intimacy on these hierarchies. The third and fourth sections in Chapter 4 provide an inventory of common Korean expressions and the social reasoning behind their usage; a set of socio-​pragmatic primitives that are common in Koreans’ verbal and non-​verbal repertoire that we propose be used as a starting point for understanding Korean films. This is by no means a comprehensive list of expressions, but rather a selection of what we believe to be the most common. Formalisms are provided in Chapter 4 to illustrate more systematically the workings of socio-​pragmatic primitives and lay the groundwork for a framework that can be developed by English-​speaking researchers. Nevertheless, we have sought to make it accessible to keen K-​film fans by providing a key for understanding formulas and considerable examples with film stills. These formalisms are then employed within generous discursive descriptions in the case studies that are presented in Chapter 5. The case studies provide a more detailed look at socio-​pragmatic primitives at work in K-​films and the impact of missing these meanings and the cohesive links that they create within the greater narrative structure. Table 1.1 provides an overview of the core films that we will cover in our case studies. It is important to note that this book focuses on the case of South Korea only, due to the vast differences in political and social ideologies held by North and South Korea. The cultural contexts are different as is the motivation\n\n6 Introduction Table 1.1 Key films we use to demonstrate invisibility and how to deconstruct it in our case studies in Chapter 5 Film Title (Romanisation, Hangeul, English translation)\n\nDirector\n\nYear of Release\n\nSado (사도) ‘The Throne’ Gisaengchung (기생충) ‘Parasite’ 82 Nyeonsaeng Gim Jiyeong (82년생 김지영) ‘Kim Ji-​young Born: 1982’ Taeksi Unjeonsa (택시운전사) ‘A Taxi Driver’ Chingu (친구) ‘Friend’ Jopok Manura (조폭 마누라) ‘My Wife Is a Gangster’ Ai Kaen Seupikeu (아이 캔 스피크) ‘I Can Speak’ Hanyeo (하녀) ‘The Housemaid’\n\nLee Joon-​ik Bong Joon-​ho Kim Do-​young\n\n2015 2019 2019\n\nJang Hoon Kwak Kyung-taek Jo Jin-​kyu\n\n2017 2002 2001\n\nKim Hyun-​seok Im Sang-​soo\n\n2017 2010\n\nbehind the films, with North Korean film heavily regulated, censored, and infused with propaganda. Also, since the division of North from South, significant language and cultural variations have occurred between the two countries (Sohn, 2006). A cross-​cultural perspective on North Korean film for English-​speaking viewers would thus require another framework that takes account of these various factors.\n\nNotes 1 Surnames will precede forenames unless otherwise needed. 2 www.viki.com\n\n2 Theoretical background\n\n2.1 Calls for visibility Before we provide a toolbox for understanding K-​films, it is important that we first explain why it is necessary. In this chapter, we will provide an overview of some of the key issues encountered by film researchers and translation studies scholars, and why the singularities in cultures and languages require translation in order to enrich understanding of foreign films. We will discuss how we define ‘foreign’, and what are the dimensions of this invisibility. We will then go on to explain what precisely singularities are in the Korean language and culture and why these are not translatable within an Anglo-​Eurocentric point of view, resulting in invisibility in K-​films. 2.1.1 Calls for visibility in national film studies There has long been a call for visibility in national film studies which, unsurprisingly, runs parallel with issues in both cultural and translation studies. There remains an overwhelming lack of empirical research on precisely what is invisible from cross-​cultural perspectives, and a general tendency to Eurocentricise film rather than contextualise films within their own cultures. From verbal to non-​verbal expressions, there are numerous modes that mean differently when employed in the cultural context of each society. For instance, some meanings that are expressed in a particular way in K-​films may not be expressed that way in Hollywood films, while they may be in Japanese films. Pan-​Asian and microscales of ‘Western’ cross-​cultural perspectives are even essential, to help to de-​generalise Eurocentric commentaries on meaning in non-​Western films. It is such differences in cultures and languages that give them their ‘singularity’ (Deutsch, 1966: 75), and which Bhabha (1994) argues should be the very focus of translation. Cultural contextualisation is the only means for breaking through this invisible barrier because it provides the ideology and reasoning for the singularity. In national film studies, untranslatable elements and the requirement for their contextualisation is referred to often. Higson DOI: 10.4324/9781003089896-2\n\n8 Theoretical background terms them ‘exotic elements’, which he explains will potentially be ‘interpreted according to an indigenous frame of reference’ by viewers who do not have knowledge of them (2000: 69). Precision is difficult to obtain in translation, even concerning literary texts which deal with a single mode rather than the multi-​modes that are required in film interpretation. Higson suggests cultural contextualisation as a solution when he calls for debates about national cinema to ‘take greater account of the diversity of reception, the recognition that the meanings an audience reads into a film are heavily dependent on the cultural context in which they watch it’ (2000: 68–​69). Willemen recommends a cross-​cultural approach as a solution that appears translational, in his suggestion for researchers to keep one eye on the culture of the text at hand and the other eye on their own culture. This is a means of identifying untranslatability, in order to account for it. although it is necessary for Western intellectuals to address, for instance, the cinema in India, with one eye on their own situation, their other eye must remain focused on the potential effects of their discourses within the Indian situation. This uncomfortably cross-​eyed mode of operation is absolutely vital if Western intellectuals, however well intentioned, are to avoid obstructing the work of Indian allies. […] Differences between, say, Ireland and Britain, or Korea and Japan, require a similar approach […] If this cross-​eyed dialectic is forgotten, the term ‘specificity’ loses any meaning and any notion of creative or diagnostic understanding. That would be unfortunate, since a position of double outsideness, that is to say, of in-​between-​ness, is the precondition for any useful engagement with ‘the national’ in film culture. (Willemen, 2006: 41) The need for a cross-​cultural approach is also demonstrated in the experiences of foreign film researchers, particularly those of European researchers of East Asian film. For example, Kaplan (1993: 142) recognises this problem in research on Chinese cinema and states, ‘cross-​cultural analysis, we know, is difficult –​fraught with danger. We are forced to read works produced by the “Other” through the constraints of our own frameworks/​theories/​ideologies’. Matron (2010: 36) also comments on the limitations of analysing the ‘other’ using a local scope to do so in the conclusion of their analysis of the transferability of cultural meanings in selected German and Korean films. Matron reflects, In this article, I drew a line connecting two movies from two very different cultures while always maintaining my own West German point of view. It is obvious that within the limited context of this study it is not possible to undertake a deeper comparison of the movies regarding diverging filmic and narrative traditions and the applicability of symbols specific to the respective culture.\n\nTheoretical background 9 In his argument for cultural contextualisation, Willemen supports these experiences of foreign film researchers and argues that researchers must account for the differences in the films of other cultures. He explains that otherwise films are forced to conform to the cultural practices of those creating or reading the research: If we accept that national boundaries have a significant structuring impact on national socio-​cultural formations […] this has to be accounted for in the way we approach and deal with cultural practices from ‘elsewhere’. Otherwise, reading a Japanese film from within a British film studies framework may in fact be more like a cultural cross-​border raid, or worse, an attempt to annex another culture in a subordinate position by requiring it to conform to the readers cultural practices. (Willemen, 2006: 35) The lack of progress in pursuit of understanding cultural specificities in film is often considered to be propagated by universalism, an argument that ultimately seeks to remove the concept of culture. Ironically, though, it seems to aid Eurocentrism, which has traditionally plagued cultural translation in the translation of texts in general (Kiaer, Yates, & Mandersloot, 2020: 3) and now extends to filmic texts. The seemingly obvious need to define the conventional differences between every two cultures in order for one to understand the other better, has been disregarded as a pointless crusade because of the ‘destabilisation of culture’. This concept is based on the notion that since cultures are destabilised by incoming influences from outside of the culture, then culture isn’t pure to begin with and is constantly in flux, and thus since all cultures are mixed, all cultures are universal. The universalist argument seems to enable a certain laziness when Eurocentric researchers study the ‘other’, what Willemen refers to as an ‘illusion’ created in order ‘to ignore the specific knowledges that may be at work in a text, such as shorthand references to particular, historically accrued modes of making sense (often referred to as cultural traditions)’ (2006: 35). In any case, universalists’ attacks on culture have proven fruitless. According to House, ‘in the empirical social sciences, attempts to “problematise” and “relativise” the concept of “culture” have not as yet prevented solid ethnographic descriptions’ (2002: 94). Thus, in the spirit of productivity, perhaps a way forward for film researchers is to look to linguistics for which dealing with destabilisation has not prevented cultural singularity from being investigated. Translanguaging studies even provide evidence of destabilisation not preventing the identification of singularity. Translanguaging studies actually track language as it moves around the world and how expressions take on new meanings when they enter new cultural spheres (Hua, Li, & Jankowicz-​Pytel, 2020; Li, 2018; Kiaer, 2018). Translanguaging could, in fact, be described as the study of cultural destabilisation itself in this respect, since both the function of the expression in\n\n10 Theoretical background its origin and the new form it takes on in its new environment are made the subject of investigation. Importantly, even though expressions travel, there is no evidence to imply that there is a subtraction from either culture as a result that would make it impossible to identify cultural differences. Rather, expressions and meanings are gained, even creating cultural currency for bridging the two cultures as a by-​product. The Korean address term oppa (오빠) serves as an apt example to demonstrate this point. Oppa, which means ‘older brother’ in Korean and is used by females when they address males who are older and of the same generation, has been adopted internationally by youths. However, words like this have not retained their interpersonal meanings when adopted by other cultures. In the case of oppa, for instance, rather than meaning older brother outside of Korea, it is often used to mean ‘boyfriend’ or ‘handsome guy’. The reason for this particular use of the word is because fans hear oppa frequently used to address young men in Korean dramas, who are typically handsome love interests. This doesn’t mean that there is not an association between oppa and handsome young men for Koreans also, and for the same reasons, however, amongst Koreans the term retains its interpersonal meaning, which it does not elsewhere. Furthermore, just as there is no evidence to suggest oppa has lost its fundamental interpersonal function in Korea as a result of the extension of its use into non-​Korean regions, there is also no evidence that its adoption has impacted on the pre-​existing form of other languages either other than its plus value. When considering the extent of the differences between cultures and languages and the importance of not dismissing singularities, we can perhaps take a lesson from Venuti’s description of the extensive transformation of a text that is involved in translation in order to make it comprehensible for a reader of a different language and culture. It is this process that film viewers undergo when interpreting films, be it for the purpose of research or casual viewing: The foreign text is not only decontextualized, but recontextualized insofar as translating rewrites it in terms that are intelligible and interesting to receptors, situating it in different patterns of language use, in different cultural values, in different literary traditions, in different social institutions, and often in a different historical moment. (Venuti, 2009: 162) 2.1.2 Current K-​fi lm literature There have been considerable (and rapidly increasing) works published in recent years that cover an array of subjects on K-​films. Many of them cover aspects of the K-​Wave and are too numerous to list. There has been limited exploration of meaning in K-​film, especially multimodal and cross-​cultural perspectives. Among these, the concept of invisibility in Korean film has been\n\nTheoretical background 11 approached on one occasion by Kiaer and Kim (2021), which is perhaps why there are also no studies on the socio-​pragmatic meanings in K-​films either, since this would involve addressing K-​films’ invisibility. There has been a degree of cultural contextualisation in a number of works that do not focus specifically on meaning in K-​film. For example, Dal (2019) uses culture to contextualise the development of Korean film, while Shin et al. (2005) provide a cross-​cultural and multi-​dimensional perspective, including a comprehensive overview of contemporary film production, its circulation and reception. Kim (2004), which is one of the earlier writings in English on Korean film, focuses on emasculisation and the expression of social struggles and identity in K-​film. Min et al. (2003) provide a culturally contextualised account of Korean film as a form of expression, considering film as part of Korea’s cultural identity. They propose that Korean films’ narratives and meanings provide evidence of the ways in which the culture makes sense of itself. Of the limited number of studies that investigate ‘meaning’ in K-​films, none of which are monographs, it is primarily symbolic meaning that has been explored. The meaning of colour, costume, and other aspects of aesthetics are common subject matter among them. For example, Kim (2018) analyses the meaning of the colour orange in Korean films; Kim (2017) analyses how colours, particularly red, interact meaningfully in a series of popular Korean films; Yoon & Yim (2015) examine Han Hyung-​mo’s 1956 film Jayu buin (자유부인) ‘Madame Freedom’ and explore the symbolic significance of costumes, makeup, and body awareness; Cameron (2012) explores the meaning of colours in Kim Ji-​woon’s 2003 film Janghwa, Hongryeon (장화, 홍련) ‘A Tale of Two Sisters’, along with French film Haute Tension ‘High Tension’ (Aja, 2003); and Jang and Cho (2006) analyse Park Chan-​ wook’s 2005 film Chinjeolhan geumjassi (친절한 금자씨) ‘Sympathy for Lady Vengeance’, exploring the meaningful use of colour and form in costumes and the symbolic meaning of the film itself. There are also studies which look at how key concepts within Korean culture and national identity are signified in K-​films. Boman (2020), for instance, explores expressions of implicit han (한) –​a concept of emotion often compared to grief and considered an essential element of Korean identity –​in contemporary Korean films. Also, Elfving-​Hwang (2015) examines the signification of national sentiments and identity in K-​films, specifically how the physical soil of the Korean peninsula signifies the continuity of the Korean nation when challenged by political or social disaster. While studies like those aforementioned do look at meanings and their expression in film, they are limited in terms of scope. Few K-​film studies mention film language either directly or indirectly by referring to ‘conventions’ (e.g., Smith, 2013: 188, 189; Han, 2011: 64; Ok, 2009: 38; Kim, 2006: 6, 7). For example, Kim (2006: 7) argues that conventions ‘feed into the ways in which an audience responds to and interprets a film’. Because of the limited focus given to these discussions, inevitably, K-​film remains absent of the needed\n\n12 Theoretical background theoretical background and appropriate terminology within relevant fields of film and communication research (e.g., multimodal film analysis, semiotics, semantics, pragmatics). This is vital in order to discuss the conventionalised usages that studies refer to, which are really the more systematic side of film language (Kim & Kiaer, 2021). Wildfeuer’s description of the processes involved in constructing meaning in film highlights the limited scope of current discussions of meaning in K-​films in this regard: Meaning in film arises out of the multiple interaction of various modalities such as images, sounds, music, gestures, camera effects, etc., which are stringed together by film editing in a chronological, linear order. The interplay of modalities results in a narrative text whose comprehension and interpretation requires the spectator’s active participation. (Wildfeuer, 2014: 1) To elaborate on Wildfeuer, if we consider events in film narrative to constitute types of meaning, then such meanings could be a person ‘starting the day’, ‘meeting a friend’, ‘shopping’, or two people ‘falling in love’. Each of these events has a clearly distinguishable purpose and, in general, relatively well-​ demarcated boundaries. They also commonly exhibit internal structure, constructed from a series of shorter happenings. For instance, starting the day will involve ‘waking up’, ‘taking a shower’, and ‘eating breakfast’. Similarly, ‘waking up’, ‘taking a shower’, and ‘eating breakfast’ will also be composed at even finer levels of discourse by elements associated with those activities rather than others. For instance, ‘eating breakfast’ might include camera shots of the food, a person reading a newspaper, and drinking coffee at the breakfast table, whereas ‘taking a shower’ might include shots of water pouring from the shower head, along with steam on the bathroom mirrors, and a person washing their hair. This is without even beginning to consider the socio-​pragmatic expressions which are engrained into any interactions that might take place using verbal or non-​verbal expressions. Kim & Kiaer (2021) have approached meaning in K-​film as comprehensively as Wildfeuer’s describes, in a pilot study that tested whether a formally specified notion of film discourse, a development of Wildfeuer’s (2014) model, could help identify conventions in meaning-​making processes in K-​films in a reliable fashion. The pilot did not attempt to give a cross-​cultural perspective or account for invisible meanings, though it produced results of patterns significant enough to determine conventions among the events in the selection of films under analysis. Kim and Kiaer did address the need to account for specifically Korean expressions in future studies, stating that the approach would benefit by ‘accounting for Korean social reasoning and how this manifests meaningfully in Korean language and behaviour’ through which the ‘long-​ awaited contextualisation of the meaning systems of Korean culture and language’ could be gained (Kim & Kiaer, 2021: 258).\n\nTheoretical background 13 2.1.3 Defining foreign How do we define elements in a text as ‘foreign’ to begin with? Recent controversy over the categorisation of Korean American film director Lee Isaac Chung’s semi-​autobiographical film Minari (2020) provides a starting point for discussing how ‘foreign’ is currently defined and the flaws in this conceptualisation. Minari was categorised as a foreign language film rather than a drama by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association at the Golden Globe awards, on the basis that a significant portion of the film’s dialogue is spoken in Korean. This is not a first. In 2020, Chinese American director Lulu Wang’s film The Farewell (2019) was also categorised as a foreign language film for the same reason. However, Minari tells the story of a Korean American immigrant family in 1980s Arkansas which, for many, encapsulates the very thing that it means to be an American –​to be an immigrant. Lulu Wang tweeted, ‘I have not seen a more American film than #Minari this year. It’s a story about an immigrant family, IN America, pursuing the American dream. We really need to change these antiquated rules that characterise American as only English-​ speaking’ (Wang, 2020). Further, the combination of Korean with English languages and Korean, American, and Korean American cultures presents cultural contexts and frequently the use of translanguaging, which creates a dimension of foreignness for Koreans just as the Korean dialogue does for English-​speaking Americans. This is where defining foreign complexifies. The combination of multiple languages or cultures in interactions can also present another type of foreignness, created by the particular tensions that occur when certain languages and cultures communicate with each other (Figure 2.1). For this interaction to be local for a viewer, they would require\n\nFigure 2.1 An American employer gives his two new Korean employees a round of applause for joining, in front of his other East Asian employees, in Minari (미나리) (2020). The cross-​cultural misalignment of this expression creates tension between cultures and subsequently awkwardness and humour.\n\n14 Theoretical background knowledge of all languages and cultures present. As we will go on to demonstrate, this is not only to understand either side of the interaction but also because the interaction of multiple languages and cultures in itself can create another dimension of foreignness that requires understanding of how the given languages and cultures relate to each other. Another dimension of foreignness also occurs when bilingual and multicultural individuals communicate (e.g., Korean Americans). This creates foreignness even for people who speak the respective languages, because they do not share the bilingual/​multicultural experience and as a result do not understand the differences in the culture and language use that they encounter. As aforementioned, even the interaction between different languages and cultures in a scene can create foreignness in its own right, because the meanings that arise from the interaction require knowledge of both languages and cultures. Often, humour can be created by particular cross-​ cultural interactions that can be understood by the respective cultures based on the knowledge they have of themselves in relation to the other culture. Those without this knowledge may be partially or wholly excluded from the joke as a result. Éric Lartigau’s French film #JeSuisLa, translated in English as ‘#IAmHere’, provides us with numerous examples of this. The film tells the story of Stéphane, a French chef, who falls in love with Soo, a woman from Korea, whom he met online through Instagram. After having a car accident, he decides life is too short and embarks on an adventure to Korea to meet her. However, when he arrives at the airport, Soo doesn’t come to meet him. Before finally tracking her down, he spends time at the airport and interacts in French with Korean service staff (Figure 2.2). These cross-​cultural interactions are humorous often because of the friction created when Stéphane communicates with Koreans, as a result of the particular pairing of his semiotic repertoire\n\nFigure 2.2 Stéphane trying to order ‘duck’ (using the English word but French pronunciation) from a Korean waitress at Incheon airport who still can’t understand him, in #JeSuisLa ‘#IAmHere’ (2019).\n\nTheoretical background 15 with theirs. He even resorts to using English to get his point across, and in these moments another cross-​cultural dimension is created yet again –​this time that only English and French speakers can fully understand. For instance, in one scene Stéphane attempts to order at a restaurant. He wants to order the duck, but the Korean waitress can’t understand him. He uses the English word ‘duck’ in the hope of gaining her understanding; however, employing the lingua franca doesn’t work because of his French pronunciation, which sounds more like ‘dook’. For speakers of English and French, the moment is filled with humour. This is because they know that the French word for duck is canard, and Stéphane is not using this word. They know that duck is an English word and, clearly, he is using this word in the hopes of being understood. They also are well acquainted with the French pronunciation of English words, firstly, to know that it is indeed ‘duck’ that he is saying and, secondly, to find it funny that after all of his efforts, his pronunciation still makes it impossible for him to be understood by the Korean waitress. When he eventually resorts to translanguaging by literally impersonating a duck, quacking and miming the flapping of wings at the waitress, his desperation to be understood creates humour and also stimulates sympathy for the difficult situation he finds himself in. Bong Joon-​ho’s Okja (옥자) (2017) is another example of a film in which cross-​ cultural interactions cause dimensions of foreignness that require multiple languages in order to understand. In this case, there are jokes that one must speak both Korean and English in order to understand. Okja tells the story of Mija, who cares for a giant pig named Okja in the mountains of Korea for international conglomerate Mirando Corporation. The time comes for Okja to be returned to the corporation, unbeknownst to Mija to be slaughtered. When Mija finds out the intentions of the Mirando Corporation, she travels to New York to find and save Okja. In one scene, the animal-​rights group ALF (Animal Liberation Front) rescue Okja from the Mirando Corporation, with the goal of attaching surveillance equipment to her and using her as a mole to expose Mirando’s animal-​rights abuse. To do this, they have to hack into Okja’s monitoring system and allow her to be taken back to the lab, which Mija does not want. Jay (the group’s leader) won’t go through with the plan without Mija’s consent, but the only way to communicate with her is through fellow ALF member ‘K’, who is a Korean American and can speak Korean and English. When they ask Mija if she will agree, she says that she wants to take Okja home to the mountains in Korea. K ignores this and lies to Jay, saying that Mija has agreed to the plan. With that, the ALF members abandon Mija, with K the last to go. According to the subtitles, K’s final words to Mija are ‘Mija! Try learning English. It opens new doors!’ What he actually says is ‘Mija! Also, my name is Koo Soon-​bum’ (Figure 2.3). It’s a mistranslation that would only be apparent to those who can speak both Korean and English, and a subversion to the supremacy of English in Korean society because to understand what K says, you would need to speak Korean.\n\n16 Theoretical background\n\nFigure 2.3 The mistranslation in the subtitle when K says, ‘Mija! Also, my name is Koo Soon-​bum’, in Okja (옥자) (2017).\n\nThe name ‘Koo Soon-​bum’ also creates a layer of meaning, this time that is invisible to viewers without knowledge of Korean culture. The name is actually quite old-​fashioned. In Alex Jung’s article (2017) ‘Did You Catch the Translation Joke in Okja?’ on Vulture.com, actor Steven Yeun who plays K was quoted explaining this: ‘Koo Soon-​bum’ is sort of like a white man saying his name is ‘Buford Attaway’ […] When he says, ‘Koo Soon-​bum’, it’s funny to you if you’re Korean, because that’s a dumb name. There’s no way to translate that. That’s like, the comedy drop-​off, the chasm between countries. Jung’s article also recognises the dimension of foreignness created by the culture and language of second-​generation Korean American character K, which he explains is noticeable for those who have knowledge of the Korean language: Yeun’s performance itself is a nod to that gap; it reads differently if you know Korean. While it’s obvious that he’s a bit of a dolt, if you have the ear for the language, his failures are more apparent, because he speaks with the stiltedness of a second-​generation speaker (Yeun’s actual pronunciation is a lot better). He’s not quite sure of himself, and is trying to fit into both spaces, but can’t. Thus, expressions in film are ‘foreign’ if they are unknown and untranslatable by the viewer, which means that the dimensions of foreign are diverse and far more prolific than the term ‘foreign’ traditionally connotes. There may be multiple types of foreignness occurring within a single interaction, scene, or film, which may be simultaneous. These expressions may be verbal or non-​ verbal. It is also important to note that just because a film is in another\n\nTheoretical background 17 language and culture, this does not mean that no local expressions will occur or that the entire film is foreign. This would have a similar effect on defining foreign, and subsequently identifying invisibility, as only acknowledging the dominant foreign language. What foreign ultimately comes down to is the knowledge, which in large part concerns language and culture, of the viewer. This does not present a clear or easy solution for the classification of films at award ceremonies, like The Farewell or Minari, because award ceremonies simply are not equipped to account for every foreign dimension encountered by every viewer. However, in film research it is both feasible and appropriate to define foreign in this way, and to subsequently identify all the unknown languages and cultures that are encountered in a film analysis. Without conceptualising ‘foreign’ in this way, the problem of invisibility will undoubtably remain since cross-​cultural approaches to the dimensions of foreign being encountered can’t be developed and untranslatability can’t begin to be addressed. 2.1.4 Invisibility in translation and foreignisation In this section we will provide the necessary theoretical background on the concept of invisibility in translation, and specifically how this occurs cross-​ culturally in the translation of Korean language and culture into AngloEuropean (Euro) texts. Since Venuti’s The Translator’s Invisibility (1995), the concept of invisibility has become a focus of critique in translation studies. Whether it involves the invisibility of the translator’s role of co-​author in producing the finished text –​in contrast to the traditional view of translators as subservient to the original text –​or the invisibility of the translation itself through the domestication of the foreign text in order to produce a smooth, comprehensible, and marketable end product, translational invisibility has been criticised for being less ethical and aesthetically interesting than an overt approach to translation. Later critics such as Spivak (2005), Booth (2008), and Coldiron (2012) even established a general critical consensus in translation studies in which making the foreign visible is considered to be a more ethical approach to the cultural other, especially for non-​Western source texts. Nevertheless, these arguments about invisibility and visibility in translation are almost exclusively based on translation between English and non-​ English literary texts and have mainly focused on a specific set of issues: the invisibility and domestication of foreignness, the invisibility of translators and their creativity, and the visibility of the ‘other’. We believe that there are other issues pertinent to thinking about translational (in)visibility. One recent theoretical intervention into translational invisibility takes the phenomenological view of invisibility as the ‘plus-​value’ of objects’ visibility, such as in Scott’s suggestion that the original text’s invisibility is a ‘latent multi-​perspectivalism’ that translators and readers of translated texts ‘can never properly achieve’ (2012: 62). In this way, invisibility is inevitable in\n\n18 Theoretical background translation. This shows that all has not been said about (in)visibility, especially in the East Asian context. 2.1.5 Cultural translation Cultural translation is a term defined by cultural theorist Homi K. Bhabha (1994) as a set of discourses that enact hybridity by crossing cultural borders, revealing the intermediary positions of (figurative or literal) translators in the process. This paradigm enables us to view translation as a broader process responsible for transferring not only semantic meaning but also cultural concepts lacking direct equivalents. Historically, there has been a great imbalance in translation between East Asian languages and English. Direct linguistic interaction between the two areas began in earnest as a result of increasing Western trading expeditions, colonialism, and the colonial mindset which created a perceived superiority of Western, particularly English language, texts. As a result, translation was a one-​sided affair where few East Asian texts were translated into English, while huge numbers of English texts were translated into East Asian languages. The translation of classic English-​language literature and foundational texts into East Asian languages was viewed as a crucial cornerstone in the process of ‘modernising’ East Asian societies. Translation between English and East Asian languages was thus built on a foundation of colonialism. The effects of this are still felt today: according to the LTI Korea archive, only 659 published Korean texts have been translated into English while in 2012 alone over 10,000 foreign texts were translated into Korean (Kiaer, 2017). Entering the postcolonial period, scholars began to recognise the need for a paradigm countering this colonial imbalance between Eastern and Western languages. Colonial and postcolonial processes have complicated the relationships between languages, with implications for the act of translation. It is clear that translation is far more than simply the process of changing the language in which a text is presented. Indeed, ‘translation’ existed as part of a paradigm negotiating the relationships between cultures mediated by verbal languages as well as non-​verbal signs. Bhabha’s notion of ‘cultural translation’ also places focus on the process of translating from one culture to another, removing the necessity for a fixed beginning and end product (such as a written work). In this way, Bhabha’s sense of ‘translation’ encompasses more than just texts. Instead of simply describing the way colonial and postcolonial translations are carried out, Bhabha talks not of a set of translations but rather of translation in a different sense of the word. Despite the emergence of ‘cultural translation’, to use Bhabha’s term, most studies of the concept remain generally Eurocentric, either exclusively discussing European languages and cultures or else seeming to implicitly suggest the superiority of Western languages over those less traditionally studied. There continues to be a great need to embrace further diversity in both translation theory and practice.\n\nTheoretical background 19 The source language audience are often angered when translators ‘naturalise’ or simplify culturally specific expressions and replace them with more accessible terms for the target language audience, accusing the translation of being inaccurate. Yet at the same time, if the translation adheres too strongly to the source text, the translated work often fails to gain traction with readers in the target language. Oftentimes, when translating from East Asian languages into English, translators may find it easier to omit invisibles so as to appease a larger, more prestigious, and often more lucrative English-​speaking audience. What results is the whitewashing of cultural elements present in the source text. Additionally, seen through the lens of cultural appropriation, this kind of anglicisation can take on added significance as another avenue of imperialist cultural expansion. Saglia (2002) defines cultural appropriation as ‘the inclusion and adoption of foreign, other signs into one’s own cultural environment in order to aggrandise, enlarge and reinforce it’, where the diversity of translated material ‘is perceived as naturalised, whilst still importantly retaining its other status’. Saglia also cites Lawrence Venuti (1995: 18), who sees domestication strategies as working to reconstitute ‘the foreign text in accordance with values, beliefs and representations that preexist in the target language’. In other words, by domesticating foreign texts in accordance with the values of one’s own culture, translators may end up contributing to the illusion that one’s own cultural values are therefore universal, based on their supposed reflection in foreign texts. This is the same problem faced in foreign film analysis. Translators, however, are given the choice to either naturalise or foreignise their texts: to either make the text more comfortable and culturally recognisable to readers in the target language or to keep it closer to the original text, often at the risk of readability in the target language. This choice may be less important when translating between relatively similar cultural contexts; however, the vast differences that currently exist between East Asian and English-​ speaking Western cultures mean that naturalisation and foreignisation are a crucial aspect of translation between these cultures. However, historically translators have over-​prioritised naturalisation when translating East Asian texts into English, resulting in translations stripped of nearly all sense of the culture of their origin. 2.1.6 The implications of (in)visibles Invisibles and visibles arise when the source and target languages possess different linguistic features, or ‘feature inventories’. For example, it is not necessary to specify gender in Korean, while in English one is often forced to specify a subject’s gender by English’s gendered third-​person pronouns, such as ‘he’ and ‘she’. (‘They’ is now also widely recognised as a gender-​ neutral alternative, yet this is not always the perfect solution.) Because of this, Korean-​English translators often find themselves in situations where they are\n\n20 Theoretical background effectively forced to add information to a text that went unspecified in the original text, requiring careful interpretation. For instance, they may need to specify a character’s gender, or the number of people present in a scene despite these details not being present in the original text (perhaps even intentionally omitted!). Such situations arise because the differences between feature inventories in Korean and English mean that it is possible to omit elements of a sentence in Korean that would be necessary to specify in English. Thus, for a Korean work to make sense in English, invisibles such as these must be chosen by the translator and added to the text in the target language. Invisibles in Korean include gender and number, as mentioned above, as well as a fine-​ grained system of hierarchical language and speech styles that add nuance to almost every utterance in Korean. These visibles and invisibles mean that translators’ linguistic decisions are not limited merely to word-​level decisions but go beyond to syntactic and pragmatic decisions too (Kiaer, 2017, 2019). The interplay between social hierarchy and language in Korean is incredibly difficult to replicate in English without losing much of the nuance of the original text. In order to properly address somebody of a higher social status in Korean, verbs and names must be changed into a polite form, and certain address terms must be used. Although levels of politeness and formal speech do exist in English, the main difference is that polite speech in English is not as codified or systematic as in Korean. For the most part, polite speech in English is limited to a few lexical terms like ‘please’ and ‘thank you’ and the use of more indirect language. Additionally, the decision of when to use a politer register in English is much vaguer than in Korean; except for certain situations like job interviews or formal emails, one’s tone when speaking English is most often decided on a case-​by-​case basis depending on the personal relationship or closeness between speakers. In comparison, there is little freedom regarding which speech register to use when speaking Korean, as the appropriate speech register strictly depends on the relative age, gender, and social status of speakers. The strict nature of Korean speech styles makes them essential to properly understanding a text, particularly when the context or social relations between characters are often left implicit. Therefore, in order to convey both the surface meaning and implied meaning of the Korean source text, translators must attempt to somehow replicate these fine-​grained social registers in English –​a difficult task to achieve elegantly. Another point of difference in Korean and English is word order. Korean is a subject-​object-​verb (SOV) language, in contrast to English, which uses a subject-​verb-​object (SVO) structure. English is also primarily a head-​initial, or ‘right-​branching’ language, while Korean is primarily head-​final, or left-​ branching. In practice, this means that while in English a modifying clause typically follows the noun being modified, as in ‘the cat [head noun] that ate the rat [modifying clause]’, modifying clauses in Korean usually precede the head noun they modify, creating a structure more like ‘the ate-​the-​rat [modifying clause] cat [head noun]’. In many cases it is irrelevant to a text’s meaning whether a modifying clause comes before or after a head noun. However,\n\nTheoretical background 21 when translating poetry, for instance, the dramatic impact of the poem can often depend on information being revealed in a specific order, and this order can easily be disrupted if a translator is forced to rearrange the order of lines by the differing headedness of the target and source languages. In effect, every point of difference in feature inventories, as seen below, forces the translator to choose whether to attempt to preserve the linguistic information in the source language –​often at the cost of readability or naturalness in the target language –​or whether to accept a loss of linguistic information in exchange for a more readable or natural translation in the target language. Yet if both of these choices result in something lost from the original text, what does this mean for our ideas of ‘faithfulness’, the criterion traditionally held up as the definitive measure of a translation’s quality? One may be tempted to say that the more ‘faithful’ approach would be to sacrifice readability and naturalness in order to preserve as much linguistic information as possible from the original text. Yet even in this case, a clunky and awkward translation can hardly be said to be ‘faithful’ to a natural-​sounding source text, even if one has managed to accurately preserve most of the source’s linguistic subtleties. Given this, we can perhaps assume that the more the linguistic inventories of source and target language differ, the less achievable faithfulness becomes, at least in a conventional sense. In the case of Korean and English, these differences are numerous, tending to be more pragmatic in Korean. We can summarise them as follows: i. Tense (pragmatically driven in Korean) ii. Gender (pragmatically driven in Korean) iii. Number (pragmatically driven in Korean) iv. Optional arguments (pragmatically driven in Korean) v. Flexible word orders (pragmatically driven in Korean) vi. Politeness (rich and sophisticated in Korean) vii. Social hierarchy (rich and sophisticated in Korean) Each one of these linguistic points of difference makes the very possibility of achieving ‘faithfulness’ more and more questionable. Of course, even between closely related languages, there will always exist subtle differences in the nuance or history of certain words that raise similar questions regarding faithfulness. Due to factors like these, we are forced to concede that translation is essentially an imperfect art, and ‘faithfulness’ is thus perhaps best thought of as an impossible ideal that can never be fully attained –​and is even further out of reach in translations between languages as different as Korean and English.\n\n2.1.7 Cultural appropriation and the problems with anglicisation As a result of this traditional preference for naturalness over faithfulness in the West, Asian-​ness and the essence of Asian cultures are often made invisible,\n\n22 Theoretical background\n\nFigure 2.4 Mrs Park eating ram-​don, in Gisaengchung (기생충) ‘Parasite’ (2019).\n\nwith translators playing down cultural differences for the sake of producing a more familiar "
