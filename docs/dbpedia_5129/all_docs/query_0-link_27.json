The main challenge facing all filmmakers is to show the story: in other words, to visualize the drama. Over the past century, narrative, experimental and documentary filmmakers have developed a variety of creative strategies and techniques designed to give their audiences compelling, multi-sensorial experiences. The goal of this class is to explore how filmmakers in different historical and cultural settings have contributed to the evolution of film as a powerful, complex and captivating art form.. This course allocates as History & Criticism for Film & TV majors.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nFMTV-UT 20 Storytelling Strategies (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered Fall and Spring\n\nThe ability to understand \"what makes a good story well told\" is a skill that is crucial to your growth as a filmmaker whether you become a writer, director, producer, actor, editor, cinematographer, etc. Storytelling Strategies looks at how narrative stories work through an examination of the structural and mythic elements first established by the ancient Greek playwrights and recognized by Aristotle in his \"Poetics\" thousands of years ago. The course continues this examination up to and including such contemporary story models as Joseph Campbell's \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\" as well as the current Hollywood paradigm, \"the three-act structure.\" We will seek to find those principles that form the backbone of successful narrative screenplays and contribute to a film's ability to resonate with an audience. The lecture is for analysis. The recitations are for applying what you have learned, through writing exercises and a completed short screenplay. This course allocates as Scriptwriting for Film & TV majors.

That question is answered in Frame & Sequence, a core production course taken as a complement to Sound Image in preparation for the Fundamentals of Sight and Sound. Addressing both the technical and the creative, Frame & Sequence teaches you how to express yourself by creating insightful, thought-provoking work through the creation of individual and collaborative films. Students with DSLRs work in crews develop an understanding of the camera, lenses, light-meters, and shot progressions as they transport the viewer through the time, space and action of their stories. This introductory class touches on all areas of filmmaking and after taking Frame & Sequence, you will have a strong foundation in the terminology necessary to communicate with other filmmakers when dealing with visual imagery. Students learn how to create pre-production books to properly plan time and resources for their films by pre-visualizing with storyboards. Ensuring safety and proper set protocol is also discussed during this period. After several still photography projects, students will make several video productions such as a simple narrative, experimental film, a 1 minute \"Lumiere Brothers\" style film, a group documentary, and final film. In post-production, students will learn how to use Premiere Pro. Exploration of the Unreal Engine will also provide students with cutting edge opportunities in storytelling as well as previsualization and pre-production. A key element of the class is the peer-to-peer discussion and critique of projects at all stages of production. Discussion and collaboration is key to your growth through the semester.

This course is designed to provide a survey of the wealth of styles, forms, purposes, and approaches to filmmaking that developed and emerged in this era. While Hollywood has obviously served as the dominant mode of filmmaking in this country, a significant of other filmmaking practices have continued to operate and sometimes thrive outside of it. Beyond the attention paid to Hollywood narrative cinema as it has changed and evolved over this half-century, we will also consider documentaries, avant-garde and experimental works, independent narraive cinema, and \"cult\" films. Consequently, we will be screening a variety of films, including works by such notable American filmmakers as Steven Spielberg, Francis Ford Coppola, Quentin Tarantino, George Romero, John Singleton, and Michael Moore.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nFMTV-UT 1002 Media Mavericks (3 Credits)\n\nTypically offered Fall and Spring\n\nThis class is a critical examination of experimental film and video with and emphasis on makers in New York City. There are no criteria for an avant-garde film or video, only the expectation that by watching it a viewer will be introduced to a challenging, refreshingly unfamiliar language that, by the end of the piece, he or she will have begun to speak. This new language many be politically confrontational, aesthetically difficult, lyrical, or rhythmical, but no matter what the form, it will express the particular vision of the artist who produced it. Challenging as this work may be for any audience, a close viewing of these \"avant-garde\" pieces will expand on your appreciation of their poetry and complexity. Whether you call these films experimental, alternative, independent, personal or poetic, they share very little save for their adventurous desire to reawaken those dormant visual and aural sensibilities that may have been hypnotized into years of sleep by too much commercial, mainstream media. This course allocates as History & Criticism for Film & TV majors.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nFMTV-UT 1003 History of Editing (3 Credits)\n\nTypically offered Fall and Spring\n\nThe theory and practice of editing, from Griffith to Kubrick.

Starting with a concentrated foundation in the tools of the trade, the semester moves through a series of workshops that present the student with a variety of situations like those faced on a working set. Workshops include many different and challenging scenes and situations, both interior and exterior, in which the students do complex multi-mic mixes. Other workshops focus on very specific aspects of the mixer's craft: radio mics, light and boom shadows, time-code and music playback, etc. the goals are to provide both professional skills and attitudes and to create an understanding of how production mixers bring the director's vision to the screen. The final project is the production mix of a film or video for one of the intermediate production courses. This course allocates as a Craft for Film & TV majors.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nFMTV-UT 1005 Studio Recording (3 Credits)\n\nTypically offered Fall and Spring\n\nThis is a workshop-style class focusing on the techniques of stereo music recording in the studio. The first three classes are lecture/demonstrations, after that we will alternate between recording soloists, small ensembles, and bands, and discussing and analyzing these recordings. The emphasis is on making complete ensemble recordings of performances. As part of the process we will compare digital and analog systems, and study the structural and operational differences among a variety of microphones. Effects processors, reverbs, delays, equalizers and compressors will all be studied and applied to recordings. The goal of the class is to provide a set of principles and tools that will be relevant to any music recording situation that arises. We will be jumping into a relatively complext studio very quickly, students will be expected to put in whatever time they need to become comfortable in the studio. Over the course of the semester each student is expected to make three finished recordings. Often the first recording will be of a soloist, the second a duo or trio, and the last a band or large ensemble. It is the student’s responsibility to find musicians to record. Grading is based on attendance and participation in class and on the quality of the recordings produced. Students will not be graded on the quality of the music, just the recording. In this class we will refer to the history of music recording repeatedly as we learn about the fundamental techniques as they have been practiced since the 1930s.

Zbrush is the perfect tool for traditional artists to transition to artmaking in the digital realm. Zbrush is an extremely feature-rich piece of software, with a unique interface unlike any other computer graphics program. While the interface may seem quite intimidating at first, rest assured we will explore the interface together and learn all the most important tools to get started and having fun with organic character creation! Some benefits of using Zbrush for Character and Creature Design over other computer design software: -The ability to quickly create concepts as if you were manipulating real clay -Great for rough character concepts or more finished painted renders -Transition is much smoother from practical to digital art using Zbrush because it feels like you are using an artistic tool rather than a technical tool - Zbrush offers such a deep diverse toolset, you can create stylized cartoon-like characters, realistic animals and humans! The possibilities are endless. You can use it for everything from organic characters to hard surface robots and props! -Once you learn the interface and tools, you can simply sculpt without worrying as much about technical aspects like polygons, faces, points and edges like other traditional polygon modelling programs\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nFMTV-UT 1076 Intermediate Television Production: TV Bootcamp (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered Fall and Spring\n\nThe goal of this course is to write and produce two five-episode series, each episode no more than five minutes in length.
