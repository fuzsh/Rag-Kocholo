ELECTIVE AFFINITIES (ongoing)

Elective Affinities – inspired by the 1809 Goethe novel – the term once used for the tendency of species to combine with certain species in preference to others. The project was created in order to explore partnerships that were created out of the work process. I would ask someone to elect somebody they had met through work and with whom they had continued to collaborate. In the nineties over 100 couples were photographed; recently I began to revisit some of those duos, as well as visiting and photographing new ones. This is an ongoing project, the gallery 'Behind The Colorama' contains updated work on this project including film and archive.
