        "text": "7\n\nSYMBOLIC ECONOMIES IN GOETHE’S\n\nDIE WAHLVERWANDTSCHAFTEN\n\nJohann Wolfgang Goethe’s final novel, Die Wahlverwandtschaften (Elective Affinities), is a work obsessed with exchange and equivalence. Most conspicuously, the question in this novel is whether one partner can be exchanged for another: whether the protagonist Eduard can replace his wife, Charlotte, with her cousin Ottilie, giving Charlotte in turn to his friend the Hauptmann in order to balance the accounts. The famous parable (Gleichnisrede) in the novel, in which the dissolution and reconstitution of various chemical elements serves as a metaphorical representation of the possible recombinations of the four main characters, can be seen as the epicenter of this obsession. But the reader is in fact confronted with questions about the possibility of value substitution on virtually every page of the work. We are asked to consider what is gained and what is lost when Charlotte transforms a cemetery into a garden, for example, or when a farmstead (Vorwerk) is mortgaged to finance a pavilion (Lustgebäude) or when the narrator substitutes a prose summary for a speech in verse.\n\nDavid Wellbery was one of the first to elucidate the centrality of these categories to the work, and to situate them in the context of the decline of Old Regime Europe.1 In what remains one of the most penetrating analyses of the novel to date, he characterizes the novel as a tale of modern Entgrenzung (de-delimiting) and Entortung (displacement) in which a decontextualization and flattening of objects and signs marks the destruction of the complex tissue of symbolic relations that had previously invested them with social meaning. The consequence is a collapse of the stable link between signifier and signified, creating a kind of universal commensurability and fungibility of objects, not least as sources of aesthetic pleasure: a churchyard, an architect’s collection of grave mound artifacts, a series of tableaux vivants, and even, when reduced to a topographical map, nature itself. While Wellbery’s primary interlocutors appear to be Luhmann and Lacan, one could just as well speak with Jean-Joseph Goux of the emergence of a general equivalent and read the Die Wahlverwandtschaften as an interrogation of this idea.\n\nIn this final chapter, I would like to offer an elaboration and specification of this line of interpretation (which has been taken up by others as well) and thereby to bring what one scholar has termed the Tausch-Rausch (frenzy of exchange) depicted in the novel more squarely into the orbit of late eighteenth-century political economy.2 This phenomenon, I would argue, is best understood not simply in terms of a general destabilization of meanings, or of the loss of the spatial and temporal depth that had previously anchored signification. Such a general perspective can certainly be discerned in the novel, and much recent scholarship has rightly sought to link it to the social and political upheaval that occurred in the wake of the French Revolution and the battles of Jena and Auerstedt.3 Probably the most vivid example of this leveling and its consequences for signification is Charlotte’s transformation of the local church cemetery. As a result of her decision to relocate the grave markers, the “bumpy graves” are turned into “a fine colourful carpet” (118), and a debate ensues regarding the most appropriate way to commemorate the dead.4 A flattening and a destabilization of meaning, to be sure, but this same example, when one looks closely at the diction, also suggests a more precise concern. What was once a kind of dwelling (“graves”) has been transformed into an ornament (“carpet”). At issue here is the status of the decorative, in a description that suggests the by-now familiar inversion of a natural hierarchy of needs, whereby the superfluous has been given priority over the necessary.\n\nAs was the case with the other works we have considered in this study, the eighteenth-century discourse of needs and the concomitant interrogation of the value of luxury can open up new avenues for interpretation of Goethe’s work. More specifically, they can help us to anchor the societal critique in the novel to the universalist anthropological model of evolving needs elucidated in chapter 5, and to see that this model proves to be at least as important to a full understanding of the work as its endlessly debated class content.5 In addition, an analysis of luxury and needs in the novel can help us to grasp the profundity of Goethe’s engagement with the expansion of consumer culture in the period. While the economic themes of the novel have figured prominently in a range of incisive interpretations, these interpretations have tended to operate with rather general analytical categories (such as exchange, capital, or commodification) and to remain rather vague regarding the historical specificities of the “capitalist” system allegedly under investigation in the work. Without an adequate consideration of the centrality of a blossoming cultural consumerism to the plot of the novel, such analyses, however insightful, remain incomplete.\n\nAs we will see, Die Wahlverwandtschaften looks backward to the extent that it shares many of the basic assumptions regarding luxury, consumption, and needs that also shape earlier works. What makes the novel unique, and uniquely modern, is, first of all, the extent to which cultural consumerism appears as an identifiable and relatively autonomous phenomenon, and, second, the manner in which this cultural consumerism becomes foundational for a much broader and more self-conscious analysis and critique of modernity. A consideration of the symbolic economies in Die Wahlverwandtschaften can thus not only deepen our understanding of Goethe’s text; it can also shed light on the evolving material and intellectual saliency of an expanding world of goods and on the consequences of this evolution, both negative and positive, for the development of the German novel.\n\nConsumer Culture in the “Age of Goethe”\n\nSome of the best recent scholarship on Die Wahlverwandtschaften has sought to restore the novel to its historical, and especially its political-historical, contexts, illuminating how it addresses, in ingenious ways, a wide array of pressing political issues related to the French Revolution and its aftermath.6 While these interpretations have provided an invaluable corrective to the long-standing assumption that Die Wahlverwandtschaften is a resolutely unpolitical novel, they have tended to neglect another, equally important historical context: that of the culture of consumption that was in full swing by 1809. What is so striking about Goethe’s novel in this regard is not simply that it includes references to a remarkable variety of luxury goods and commodified entertainments, but that it provides a comprehensive overview of virtually all of the key arenas of discretionary consumption around 1800.\n\nThe historian Michael North has provided a useful catalogue of these arenas in his recent study “Material Delight and the Joy of Living”: Cultural Consumption in the Age of Enlightenment in Germany.7 A brief consideration of his analysis will allow us to gain a better sense of both the breadth of Goethe’s depictions and the level of detail at which he operates. North divides what he terms “cultural consumption” in the period into nine categories: (1) books and reading; (2) the culture of travel; (3) fashion and luxury goods; (4) the culture of domestic interiors; (5) gardens and country houses; (6) art and taste; (7) musical culture; (8) theater and opera; and (9) the new stimulants and sociability. Every single one of these categories is represented in the novel; indeed, they provide the scaffolding of the entire work, essentially creating the narrative space in which the catastrophe unfolds, sometimes marking its stages and sometimes serving to drive it forward.\n\nAt the risk of lapsing into a simple inventory of passages, it is worth taking a few moments to review some of the examples that can be used to support this claim. With regard to books and reading, we have not only Eduard’s performances of reading aloud, but also references to prestige editions such as “the volumes on English country houses, with the engravings” (46) and the “folio” (168) with images of apes that Charlotte provides to Luciane.8 It should also be remembered that a book is implicated in the death of the infant Otto. As Jochen Hörisch writes, “Otto dies because Ottilie not only holds this child, but also a book in her arms.”9 The burgeoning culture of travel is reflected in the references to Eduard’s travels (and the corresponding journals) as well as in the figure of the English traveler who visits the estate late in the novel. Also significant are Eduard’s and the Hauptmann’s interest in the “buying…of horses” (23), and “the new carriages” (66) that arrive on the scene with the duke and the baroness. Fashion and luxury are of course everywhere in the novel, most notably (and most ominously) in the case of the chest that Eduard orders for Ottilie’s birthday—“covered in red morocco, studded with steel nails, and filled with presents that were worthy of such a vessel” (91). Domestic interiors become a focus of attention at various points, and the novel mentions precisely those artifacts that constituted the focus of interest and artisanal innovation in the period: upholstered furnishings such as the “sofa” (154) and “upholstered chair” (Sessel, 54) as well as specialized tables such as a “card table” (134), “desk,” and “a low table” (54).10 And the centrality of gardens and country houses in the novel goes without saying.\n\nThis list goes on: private concerts, sheet music available for purchase, and Luciane’s guitar all exemplify the latest developments in musical culture; various collections of prints, engravings, and artifacts speak to concerns with art and taste; the theater and derivative entertainments take center stage after the arrival of Luciane, who is the driving force behind the pantomimes and tableaux vivants that figure so centrally in the work. Even coffee, tea, and sugar, the three stimulants most closely associated with new modes of sociability, receive brief mention.11 Both the extraordinary range and the specificity of these references suggest a conscious examination of the new consumer culture rather than a coincidental appearance of contemporary social phenomena. Indeed, these artifacts and activities are enmeshed in a set of subtle and sophisticated reflections on the status of the ornamental, reflections that can be fully understood only in terms of period debates about luxury. A number of scholars have noted the preoccupation of the narrative with the themes of excess and superfluity, as for example in the case of Eduard’s infatuation, because of which he becomes “immoderate in the giving of himself and of presents and promises” (91). And some of these same scholars have pointed out the ways in which the novel engages with processes of commodification and the increased circulation of money and goods. There has, however, been little attempt to place these references in a contemporary political-economic discourse with any real specificity.12\n\n“Abwechselung und fremde Gegenstände”\n\nThis oversight is all the more surprising given that the construction of a garden pavilion or Lustgebäude, which proves so central to the unfolding of events in the work, also serves as an anchor for the examination of luxury and needs in the novel. The link to eighteenth-century reflections on luxury first becomes clear in a crucial early discussion among the four main characters during which a decision is made regarding the location of the pavilion on the estate. It is the Hauptmann, often viewed as the embodiment of an Enlightenment faith in progress through social engineering, who justifies the placement of the structure by referring to a process of historical evolution. Contrasting the original construction (Schloß) with the new structure, he explains: “Building the Hall where they did, an older generation showed good sense, for it has shelter from the winds and is near the things we need every day; but a house intended more for social gatherings than for living in will be very well placed up there, and many pleasant hours may be spent in it during the summer months” (53). Here we see both the hierarchy of needs—shelter (“shelter from the winds”) and nourishment (“near the things we need every day”) precede pleasure—as well as the way in which this hierarchy is mapped onto a succession of generations. The discussion, however, also makes clear that the placement of the pavilion at the top of the hill entails a symbolic severing of the purportedly natural link between necessity and luxury. According to the Hauptmann, unlike “the older generation” the current residents demand “novelty, variety” (Abwechselung und fremde Gegenstände, 53). As Ottilie has already pointed out, from the new location the Schloß will be invisible, as will the village and all the homes. At issue here is thus not simply an “unacknowledged inclination to withdraw.”13 This is certainly one important aspect of the project, but one must also recognize the particular nature of this withdrawal, that it entails a conception of leisure and pleasure that seeks to obscure the existence of its own foundations.\n\nThe same framework of progressive needs also finds expression in another key passage relating to the pavilion—namely, in the description of the celebration that accompanies the laying of the foundation stone. Wellbery points to the relative stability of the symbolic order suggested by the mason’s detailed speech at this event, contrasting it with the trivialization of ritualistic speech delivered later in the topping-out ceremony. In the latter case, the speech is lost to the wind, and as a consequence the individual words lose their independent meaning. They have been rendered equivalent as so many identical units that constitute the abstract collectivity of the “celebration speech.” More recent interpretations have argued that this trivialization is already apparent in the initial speech, which is, after all, given not by a Meister but by a “young mason” (61) who attempts to compensate for his lack of experience by adopting the appropriate “manner of a public speaker” (Rednermiene, 61).14 Regardless of which of these approaches one finds more compelling, what is clear is that this speech raises questions not only about the stability of the link between signifier and signified, but also about that of the link between the essential and the ornamental. The entire idea of a ritual to mark the laying of the foundation stone (at least in its original conception if not in this particular instantiation) can be grasped as a form of socially sanctioned luxury. The construction of a dwelling serves as the occasion for a celebration, thereby directly anchoring pleasure, leisure, and surplus to the requirements of daily life. The mason draws attention to this link when he immediately progresses from a reference to the “sculpted” (wohlzugehauenen) and thus supremely functional stone to remark on the “walls of earth, for the present still decorated with beautiful and dignified living figures” (59; my emphasis).\n\nEven more telling are the mason’s remarks on the appropriate relationship among the various architectural elements that make up the structure. The adornments that decorate the exterior, he explains, rely on the existence of a stable foundation. The organization of his comments in this passage is particularly revealing, because it again suggests a normative model of progression, in both spatial and temporal terms, from the necessary to the ornamental. Beginning with the “foundations, properly laid” (59), he proceeds to the construction of the walls, which, he remarks, already threaten to obscure the existence of the foundation work. The more decorative but still structural contributions of the stonecutter and the sculptor further contribute to this occlusion, until the whitewasher completely eliminates the traces of the mason and appropriates his work, “because he covers it and colours it and smooths it over” (60). Finally, when the floor has been tiled and the exterior decorated, it would seem to be the mason alone who can still see through all of the concealments to recognize “those regular and careful joints to which the whole owes its existence and its stay” (60).\n\nRead in an allegorical fashion, then, one of the main implications of the speech is that the sphere of basic needs, however indistinct it may become as a result of the passage of time or the addition of increasingly refined and ornamental elements, must always be kept in mind. Indeed, the subsequent call for contributions to the time capsule seems intended to reinforce the connection between spheres, as guests are invited to participate in a ritualistic reintegration or recombination of the superfluous and the foundational. One is tempted to invoke Marcel Mauss in this context and to see in this passage a distant echo of the potlatch, as the guests compete in the destruction of wealth—“a couple of buttons off my uniform,” “little combs,” “bottles of smelling salts and other fine articles,” and, of course, Ottilie’s “golden chain” (60). The foundation-stone ritual thus not only evokes, perhaps only as a memory, the existence of a stable symbolic order based on a hierarchy of needs. It also instantiates a form of socially sanctioned prodigality, a model of productive-unproductive luxury that actually serves to maintain that stability and to foster community rather than undermine them.15\n\nThat Goethe chooses to raise these issues in the context of the construction of a pavilion is itself significant, as a comparison with political-economic writings of the period illustrates. In the works of commentators on both sides of the debate, from Mandeville to Isaak Iselin, architecture figures prominently.16 Joseph Sonnenfels, in his Versuch über das Verhältnis der Stände (Essay on the Relationship among the Estates) of 1777, includes a criticism that proves particularly illuminating for Die Wahlverwandtschaften. In the course of a series of reflections on “well-ordered” versus “immoderate” luxury, Sonnenfels laments the negative impact of “so many pavilions [Lustgebäude], most of which stand empty,” occupying land that could be cultivated and thus more productively used to feed a growing population.17 Rather than such static and unproductive accumulations of affluence, Sonnenfels endorses those forms of expenditure “which derive from surplus, which propel wealth through all of the ateries of the state.”18 Precisely this kind of productive use of wealth proves strikingly absent from the novel, and with it the reciprocal relations among the estates that many more liberal commentators around 1800 see as the key to an affluent state and a stable social hierarchy.\n\nIs Die Wahlverwandtschaften best read, then, as an admonition against the dangers of unproductive luxury? One finds many passages in the work that support such an interpretation, especially when one approaches it with the previous chapters of this study in mind. It requires only a minor shift in perspective, after all, to see Eduard as a reincarnation of Wieland’s sultans on a smaller scale, lavishing funds on superficialities as he neglects those projects that would increase the productivity of his lands and the well-being of his subjects. Even his surrender to Ottilie of the decision about where to place the pavilion, a decision described by the mason as the “privilege of the lord” has a clear pendant in the Mätressenwirtschaft that defines the courts of Scheschian.19 What is Eduard doing, after all, if not constructing a pleasure garden for his mistress? The parallel is strengthened by the ambiguous designation of Ottilie as the “mistress [Herrin] of the household” (54). Hans Vaget’s seminal interpretation of the novel actually argues along similar lines, even if his focus is on Goethe’s notion of dilettantism and on the rigidity of the minor nobility in postrevolutionary Germany. As Vaget writes, Eduard’s “ill-considered plans and projects…reveal this rich baron to be incapable of managing his estate in an economically responsible manner.”20 But while the connection between Goethe’s intervention and the specific situation in Napoleonic Europe is undeniable, the similarity with Wieland indicates that the elements of the critique also derive from a more expansive political-economic framework.\n\nA preoccupation with the status of allegedly natural and fundamental needs—and the potentially baleful consequences that result from their neglect—runs through Die Wahlverwandtschaften like a red thread. At times the references are explicit, as when the assistant from Ottilie’s school posits a cyclical ebb and flow of surplus and scarcity across the generations. More often, however, the question of needs is thematized only indirectly or through allusion, as with the pavilion. These moments of indirect thematization, moreover, frequently illuminate one another in reciprocal fashion. In order to grasp the full resonance of the allusion in the case of the pavilion, for example, we must take a step back and also consider the object in conjunction with its enabling condition—namely, the decision to sell the tellingly named Vorwerk in order to finance improvements to the park. The staging of the decision to sell this outbuilding, a facility with real, if unrealized, economic potential, provides additional details that can help us to grasp more precisely how the discourse of luxury informs the novel’s critique of what we might, following Zygmunt Baumann, term a “liquid modernity.” Because of the significance of this passage for my argument, it deserves to be quoted at length:\n\nThey climbed down to the summer-house and sat there all four together for the first time. It was, very naturally, the unanimous wish that the day’s walk, which they had done slowly and not without difficulty, should be so devised and accommodated that it could be done more companionably, at a stroll and in comfort. Everyone made suggestions, and they calculated that the route for which they had needed several hours, if it were well laid out, must lead back to the Hall in an hour. Below the mill, where the stream flowed into the ponds, they were already erecting a bridge which would shorten the way and adorn the landscape when Charlotte reined in their inventive imaginations a little by reminding them of the costs which such an undertaking would entail.\n\n“There too we have a solution,” Eduard replied. “All we need do is sell the holding in the woods that looks so well situated but brings in so little, and spend the revenue on this project, and in that way, having the pleasure of a priceless walk, we enjoy the profits of a good investment, whereas at present, according to our last accounts at the end of the year, we draw, to our annoyance, only a pitiable income from it.” (52)\n\nAs in the subsequent consideration of the pavilion, here we also find a subtle reference to a “natural” progression, from “difficulty” (Beschwerlichkeit) to “comfort” (Behaglichkeit), the latter term also being associated with the combination of efficiency (“which would shorten the way”) and pleasure (“adorn the landscape”) so frequently connected with the legitimizing categories of comfort and convenience as characterized by Woodruff Smith.21 Equally significant is the contrast between the “inventive imaginations” and Charlotte’s attempt to anchor them to reality with her rational reflections on the cost of such an endeavor.\n\nIt is tempting to see this moment as something as a turning point in the novel, not least because it reiterates a previous discussion while adding an ominous twist. When the idea of the pavilion is first mentioned in the previous chapter, the claim is not only that it will “bear on the Hall” (sollte einen Bezug aufs Schloß haben, 46), but also that it will be financed on the basis of a careful allocation of existing resources—in other words, through surplus funds. What follows Charlotte’s objection in this second instance, however, is the abandonment of that plan in favor of one that requires the inversion of priorities that I mentioned previously. Even more portentous is the nonchalance with which Eduard blurs key conceptual categories in the subsequent paragraph. What is in fact a liquidation of potentially productive capital in order to finance nonessential consumption is presented as “a good investment,” with aesthetic pleasure as its metaphorical interest.22\n\nLuxury and Entropy\n\nThis blurring of categories brings us to one of the most significant facets of Goethe’s appropriation of the luxury discourse in the novel. I am referring to the leveling of distinctions mentioned at the outset of the analysis, a leveling that Wellbery captures with the phrase “dis-organization of symbolic orders,” and that others, following Foucault, have taken as evidence of a general crisis of representation around 1800.23 A concern with the reduction of dimensionality, the loss of depth and context, suffuses Goethe’s work, finding expression in examples ranging from the previously mentioned gravestones to the seemingly painted images of the landscape from the door and windows of the “little summer-house” (3) described by the narrator as “like a sequence of framed pictures” (4) to the abstraction of the estate in the topographical map prepared by the Hauptmann. Related to these phenomena is a flattening of the existing relationship between linguistic signifier and signified, what Wellbery refers to as “the contraction of the signifier to an opaque power unto itself,” and Nils Reschke terms “the abolition of the topological conception of language, which presumes a fixed relationship between words and things, signs and ground.”24\n\nThis aspect of the novel in particular has been taken as evidence of its modernity, or even its postmodernity. This very same aspect, however, is also what draws the novel most powerfully into the orbit of the classical and republican attacks on luxury. The work of John Sekora, whose monograph of 1977 has, in more recent scholarship on the topic, not always received the attention it deserves, provides the most comprehensive account of luxury and social disintegration. Luxury, Sekora writes, is “a theory of entropy that explains as it describes how men, singly or collectively, lose vitality and fall from grace”; and he goes on to explain that “luxury in the Old Testament begins in the neglect of necessity and the forgetting of one’s place in the hierarchy.”25 We have seen on various occasions how these exact ideas of “entropy,” the “neglect of necessity,” and the “forgetting of one’s place in the hierarchy” carry over unchanged into the more vociferous attacks on luxury in the late eighteenth century. The blurring of social categories, for example, and the increasing unreliability of traditional markers of status, are set pieces in critiques of the spread of fashion as far back as Zedler. They find their paradigmatic eighteenth-century expression in the work of Johann Peter Süßmilch, who, as we have seen, describes Luxus as “that magnificence, opulence, and expenditure, which eliminates all order, which confuses everything, and mixes the noble with the lowest class of citizen, which is born of a vain pride, characterized in particular by a ceaseless forward motion, without ever resting, since by dint of arrogance each wants to appear to be more than he is, until finally everything is identical to everything else, such that one can no longer distinguish one from the other.”26 And it is precisely this sort of relentless, egotistical, boundary-blurring expenditure that defines the plot of Die Wahlverwandtschaften as well, as a number of insightful interpretations have noted, without, however, recognizing the venerable discursive tradition being activated in its representation.\n\nThe shared nexus of concerns that links Goethe to these other commentators can be expanded if we reconsider the claims of Johann August Schlettwein cited in the previous chapter. Schlettwein, it will remembered, described “the aim, the spirit, and the meaning of opulence” not only in the familiar terms of the senses and the imagination; he also stressed the loss of any capacity to think in causal terms, to focus on the future consequences of present actions: “The unchanging, the enduring, the value of the past and the present in the future, the evaluation of the impressions and of causes in terms of their effects, and the progression thereof; these are not the goal of opulence.”27 In the case of Heinrich von Ofterdingen (Henry von Ofterdingen), we saw that the miner proved uniquely resistant to the temptations of luxury as described in this passage, serving as a model for the romantic artist. Faced with “the stimulation of the senses and the imagination through forms, colors, and appearances,” he nonetheless managed to embed these stimulations in a meaningful causal framework, thereby channeling his egoism toward socially productive ends and maintaining the appropriate balance between surface and depth, past and present.28 Eduard, in contrast, appears as the embodiment of Schlettwein’s opulent individual, driven exclusively by sensuality and the imagination. Past and future obligations (the “value of the past and the present in the future”) mean nothing to him; his perceptions of causal relationships are deeply distorted by his unbounded desire; and he establishes the value of all things solely on the basis of their capacity to satisfy this desire. He acts, as Thomas Wegmann writes, as “the omnipotent despot of signs.”29 In this role, he mirrors many of the figures we have considered in this study, not least those targeted in books and treatises critical of luxury consumption. There as well the target was an alleged revaluation or misappropriation of signs based on a fantasy construction of the self, in a manner that detached them from their allegedly natural contexts of meaning. The key difference is that Eduard, as a result of his social position and his financial resources, proves uniquely capable of extending his semiotic tyranny over a much broader range. Like those other luxury consumers, however, his ability to engage in this fantasy play is closely linked to the availability of new commodities and commodified entertainments, a point that the novel underscores on numerous occasions.\n\nAt times, to be sure, Die Wahlverwandtschaften suggests that its catastrophic events can be traced back to Eduard’s moral failings, failings that themselves appear to have their origins in a combination of a weak character and a failed upbringing. Not unlike Campe’s Robinson the Younger or Wieland’s Azor, he is “the only child of wealthy parents, spoiled by them” (10; translation slightly modified). But the process of social entropy related by the novel clearly transcends the agency of any one figure, and beyond that, Goethe’s narrative style, the often-noted “symbolic” character of the work to which I will return in my concluding remarks, seems to demand an interpretation of individual characters in emblematic terms.30 Along these lines, one should also note that Eduard is far from the only character who can be illuminated by reference to Süßmilch and Schlettwein. Luciane offers an even more concentrated embodiment of Schlettwein’s opulence, as evidenced by her excess in all things, from the “valises,” “portmanteaus,” “leather containers,” “little boxes,” and “cases” (133) that crowd the house upon her arrival to her “endless change of clothes” (135). Her prodigality is the stuff of legend—or, perhaps, allegory.31 She proves a voracious consumer of material and financial resources in her efforts to stage an endless series of ephemeral entertainments, each of which has at its primary purpose the gratification of her own ego. It comes as no surprise that the description of her departure makes conspicuous use of the verb aufzehren (translated as “exhausted,” 149) and refers to her entourage as a “swarm” (149), associating her with that quintessential consumer of the animal kingdom, the locust.\n\nLuxury and Commodification\n\nRecognizing the discursive context of luxury that informs Goethe’s critique, I would argue, gives us a more historically nuanced perspective on the fear of an absolute equivalence and exchangeability that haunts the novel. One can certainly affirm Helmut Schneider’s claim that the “epochal transformation of modernity” constitutes “the global background of the novel,” but one must also acknowledge that the reading of modernity offered by the novel owes a clear debt to a conceptual framework with origins in the premodern period.32 Of course, my argument from the outset has been that precisely this framework becomes the focus of controversy in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and Goethe’s novel takes up a unique position within this controversy. If one finds much in Die Wahlverwandtschaften that is familiar from the other texts we have considered in this study, one also finds a number of crucial differences. Most notable is the level of detail in the novel’s articulation of the link between commodification and luxury.\n\nWhile one can certainly claim (as I have done repeatedly) that all of the works addressed thus far need to be understood against a backdrop of commercial expansion, none of them lavishes anywhere near the same level of narrative attention to commodities as Die Wahlverwandtschaften. One would in fact be hard pressed to find any novel written around 1800 that contains such a highly elaborated treatment of either processes of commodification or the material culture of the period. Goethe’s novel, I would argue, can be seen to signal the historical moment at which the traditional discourse of luxury as entropy becomes inextricably entwined with the modern world of goods.\n\nIn this context as well we owe a debt to David Wellbery, who first noted the significance of these processes and objects for the novel, which he collected, for obvious reasons, under the rubric of the “K-paradigm.” There is the chemische Kabinett (chemistry cabinet, 32), which is intended to demonstrate the principles of elective affinity; the ultimately deadly Kahn (rowing-boat, 80), which “at considerable expense Eduard had sent away for”; der Koffer (box, 97) that Eduard orders for Ottilie’s birthday; the various Kataloge (catalogues, 107), from which Eduard and the gardener order flowers and shoots; the Kästchen (box) of the architect, which resembles das Kästchen eines Modehändlers (the little trinket boxes, 123) as well as having a link to the Kästchen (little boxes, 133) of the Englishman’s companion; finally, one has the Naturalienkabinett (natural-history cabinet, 169) mentioned by Ottilie in her journal, and the tragbare dunkle Kammer (portable camera obscura, 182) that the Englishman uses to sketch the landscape.33\n\nThe crucial point here is not simply that the novel makes reference to a large number of commodities, but that these artifacts are explicitly linked to processes of monetization, and that these processes are linked in turn with the flattening of distinctions and the social entropy that so many scholars have identified in the novel. The very existence of the “K-paradigm,” by establishing a linguistic parallel among disparate objects, suggests commensurability, a collapsing of the distinctions that separate the spheres of art, science, agriculture, and entertainment. All find a common denominator in their status as mobile property.34\n\nNowhere is the link between commodification, luxury, and the obliteration of difference clearer than in the case of the chest or box that Eduard gives to Ottilie, which certainly figures as one of the most prominent and narratively significant commodities in all of eighteenth-century German literature. The gift of “muslins, cambrics, silks, shawls, and lace-work” (97) tucked away in the drawers of the “marvelous little box” (97) indicates nothing so much as Eduard’s narcissistic excess and his desire to remake Ottilie in his own image, “to dress her head to foot, and more than once” (97; translation modified). The gift is profoundly impersonal; nothing about it suggests an effort to address the unique individuality of the recipient. Framed as a purchase undertaken through a third party (Eduard’s valet) in contact with “tradespeople and people from the fashion houses” (91) who presumably know what “young women” like, the chest offers a material challenge to any readers who would take seriously the authenticity of Eduard’s affection.\n\nIts impersonal character is further cast into relief by the description of another gift, the hand-knitted vest given to the architect by Charlotte and Ottilie on the occasion of his departure. In this case the emphasis is on the absence of mediation, on the object as a direct repository of the (innocent) affection of the giver and as the product of a direct personal investment of time (“which for a long time he had watched them both working at,” 160). The chest thus appears in the novel as the quintessential luxury commodity, both in terms of its cost and exclusivity and in its link to the intensification of erotic desire through external display. Despite this exclusivity, however, it is no less the product of what Arjun Appuradai terms “culturally standardized recipes for fabrication,” produced for an anonymous purchaser and ordered from anonymous merchants in—where else?—the city.35 The object and its contents demonstrate the powerful symbolic role of such commodities, their expressive function as markers of identity, even as they unmask this identity as a fantasy construction (Eduard’s) completely detached from the essential qualities of the recipient. One can hardly be surprised that Ottilie finds the object unsettling—“so costly and exotic that she could not bring herself to think of it as hers” (97).\n\nEduard’s desire to use the chest and its contents to refashion Ottilie according to his ideal can be read as an attempt to enmesh her in a wider circuit of exchange and equivalence. That Ottilie herself ultimately turns to these same goods in order to irrevocably signal her disengagement from this circuit is a key point to which I will return shortly. Before doing so, however, it is worth mentioning a few more examples of the explicit connection between monetization or commodification and the blurring of distinctions in the novel. In the case of the Vorwerk, as we have already seen, the decision to sell is framed by a confusion of conceptual categories (investment, interest) that obliterates the difference between the necessary and the ornamental. In the case of the cemetery as well, one finds a reference, albeit a subtle one, to the financial interests that helped facilitate the transformation of the “bumpy graves” into “a fine colourful carpet” (118). The narrator points out that the pastor was ultimately reconciled to the new arrangement because Charlotte gives him the right to capitalize the property, thereby ensuring that this beautiful carpet “moreover would be of benefit to his household” (118).\n\nA more significant example, however, is the drinking goblet that was originally created for Eduard in his youth, onto which were engraved the first initials of his two names, an E and an O, “together in a very decorative intertwining” (61). Like the chest, the goblet has a complicated life history that reflects what Igor Kopytoff refers to as successive phases of commodification and decommodification.36 Having begun as a gift to Eduard in his youth, it is then incorporated into the foundation stone ritual, where the young journeyman tosses it into the air, for, according to the narrator, “we mark the superabundance of our joy by destroying the vessel we made use of when we were joyful” (61). At this point the goblet has long been removed from the sphere of commodities, and within the ritual it functions as a sign whose meaning reflects a shared and presumably stable community of values. Like the various items submerged in the time capsule, its destruction can be seen as part of the socially sanctioned prodigality described previously.\n\nRather than shattering on the stones as expected, however, the goblet is caught by one of the spectators, who is then persuaded by Eduard to part with it “at a high price” (113). At this moment of recommodification, the goblet is extracted from a socially agreed-upon sphere of meanings and becomes a merely private symbol; more specifically, it becomes Eduard’s private token that the hand of fate is involved in his relationship to Ottilie.37 This transition, moreover, from a set of socially fixed meanings anchored to particular rituals to a sphere of exclusively private meanings, a transition that the novel identifies with the process of (re-)commodification, initiates a development whereby the distinction among artifacts evaporates entirely. The novel marks the final stage of Eduard’s decline after Ottilie’s death by way of another reference to the goblet, which, having meanwhile been shattered by accident, is quietly replaced by Eduard’s valet. When Eduard discovers what has happened, he loses all interest in food and drink. As if to indicate the instability of private signs and the fragility of meanings privately constructed through commodities, the narrator foregrounds this final substitution as the beginning of the end.\n\nOne finds other passages in the novel where artifacts explicitly identified as commodities are linked to a modern destabilization of the traditional social order—for example, the second-rate grafts (presumably French) that are featured in the catalogs of “fruit-growers nowadays” (107), or the row-boat that Eduard has delivered at great expense from afar.38 Of particular significance in the case of the three crucial artifacts discussed above, however (the chest, the Vorwerk, and the goblet; the case of the cemetery is less clear-cut), is the way the novel emphasizes the moment of commodification as a key point of origin for the processes of social destabilization related by the work as a whole. In light of this emphasis, it comes as no surprise that some have seen in Die Wahlverwandtschaften an anticipation of Marx’s characterization of capitalist modernity as a social order in which “all that is solid melts into air.”39 The novel certainly does anticipate Marx in this respect, but to read Die Wahlverwandtschaften exclusively in these terms is to miss the extent to which the novel captures a discourse in transition (and this is still the case, it should be noted, in the work of Marx and Engels). The novel gestures toward both the future and the past. It illuminates, on the one hand, how deeply the conception of modernity as entropy, which finds a dramatic though by no means final articulation in the Communist Manifesto, is indebted to an older discourse on luxury. But the novel also foregrounds the indelible transformation of that discourse through processes of commodification, processes that seem to obliterate traditional models of social order, but also, as we will see, raise the possibility of new kinds of depth and distinction.\n\nIn order to better understand the innovations of Goethe’s novel in this regard, we can turn to the work of Igor Kopytoff, who approaches the category of the commodity from a more anthropologically informed perspective than is often the case in the Marxist tradition. Kopytoff points out that the existence of a commodity depends not simply on its being produced as such, but also on a “cultural and cognitive process” by which individuals mark certain things (or people) as commodities, and thereby as participating in a sphere of universal commensurability.40 On this reading, commodities exist in all societies, traditional and modern, “exchange being a universal feature of human social life” (68). Important differences between societies come into play, however, with regard to both the number and kinds of items that occupy this sphere as well as the circumstances under which they are allowed to do so.\n\nAll societies can be located between the two extremes of complete commodification, a state in which any person or thing could be exchanged or sold for any other, and a state of perfect decommodification, in which everything is completely singular. Indeed, for Kopytoff, one of the primary tasks of culture is to identify and maintain those areas in which people and/or things can be understood as equivalent and those in which they cannot. With the spread of new institutions and technologies of exchange in early modern Europe, however, establishing the boundaries between what can be exchanged and what cannot becomes a much more dynamic and contested process. Shifts in the location of these boundaries or an expansion in the terrain they mark off tends to be accompanied by conceptual unease: “The flattening of values that follows commodification and the inability of the collective culture of modern society to cope with this flatness frustrate the individual” (88). Beyond this, moreover, these shifts also generate counterreactions. According to Kopytoff, “The counterdrive to this potential onrush of commodification is culture…. And if, as Durkheim saw it, societies need to set apart a certain portion of their environment, marking it as ‘sacred,’ singularization is one means to this end. Culture ensures that some things remain unambiguously singular, it resists the commodification of others; and it sometimes resingularizes what has been commodified” (73). What we see in Die Wahlverwandtschaften, is, on the one hand, the encroachment of the principles of exchange into arenas from which they had previously been excluded, and a corresponding “flattening of values.” The sale of the Vorwerk proves particularly relevant in this regard, since it hinges on both the monetization of landed property and the expansion of credit instruments.41 Equally important, however, is the diagnosis in the novel of a counterreaction, of strategies employed to reestablish meaningful discriminations through attempts at singularization.\n\nAs Kopytoff points out, traditional, small-scale and modern, complex societies alike respond to commodification by demarcating certain areas of activity that are excluded from such exchange—a process that he terms “singularization.” The key difference between the two lies in the fact that in complex societies this process no longer reflects a stable social consensus but rather the idiosyncrasies of individuals and small groups. He contrasts, for example, the modern institution of high art with the fixed exchange hierarchy of the Tiv of central Nigeria. With regard to the former, he writes: “Singularity is confirmed not by the object’s structural position in an exchange system, but by intermittent forays into the commodity sphere, quickly followed by reentries into the closed sphere of singular ‘art’ ” (82–83). The problem in complex societies involves not just the existence of extensive spheres of equivalence, and not just the loss of meaning, but also the ambiguity of objects and the corresponding proliferation of individualized meanings. And here we can establish a link back to the novel. As much as Die Wahlverwandtschaften relates a “dis-organization of symbolic orders,” it also reflects on a remarkable range of attempts to reestablish order and distinction on the basis of new and largely individualized value hierarchies. These attempts, moreover, often operate through the mechanisms of commodity exchange itself. What is Eduard’s purchase of the goblet, after all, if not an attempt at singularization, a “foray into the commodity sphere” immediately followed by a withdrawal into the closed sphere of (private) singularity?\n\nAn even more dramatic example is Ottilie, who singularizes the chest she receives from Eduard by turning it into a sacred object, a kind of altar before which she worships in the evening: “But how often at nights, having locked herself in, Ottilie knelt before the open box and looked at her birthday presents, not one of which she had used or cut or made up” (108). Even more significantly, her concluding gesture, her ultimate act of independence, self-determination, and self-expression, makes use of this commodity as its primary vehicle. By using the materials from the chest to construct her burial gown, she transforms what was a rather straightforward token of desire into a highly idiosyncratic prefiguration of her imminent death. As if to underscore the confusion that results from the privatization of meaning through the dialectic of commodification and singularization, the narrator explains how her friends completely misinterpret this “most meaningful” (das Bedeutendste) act, taking it to be an indication of her steady improvement (fig. 11).\n\nFigure 11. Ottilie and her Koffer. Urania, Taschenbuch für Damen auf das Jahr 1812. Reproduced courtesy of Princeton University Library, Princeton, New Jersey.\n\nObjects of Distinction\n\nAt stake in these two examples is the status of the commodity as a means of confirming, asserting, and even constructing individual identities, not, as is the case in traditional societies, on the basis of a stable set of correspondences between artifacts and status, but in terms of highly idiosyncratic, individualized value systems. This dialectical entwinement of commodities and identity, whereby commodities both threaten and help to ground a sense of self, constitutes one key way in which Goethe departs from the straightforward enervation/motivation dichotomy that is typical of eighteenth-century debates about luxury. In addition, the novel offers a rather different perspective on the fetishism of commodities than we have come to expect from authors writing in a Marxist vein. It seems clear that both Eduard and Ottilie have a fetishistic relationship to the commodities in question, but their fetishism is itself a reaction to the leveling effects of commodification. That Eduard’s and Ottilie’s attempts to singularize are so closely linked to their deaths suggests a profound skepticism toward their efforts and toward privatization of value and identity in complex, highly commodified societies. The novel, in other words, implies that private singularization, though it may be opposed to homogenization, is too weak to counter the “flattening of values” caused by new technologies of and opportunities for exchange. The conflicts between individual value systems that the novel relates would seem to confirm Kopytoff’s claim that the “complex intertwining of the commodity exchange sphere with the plethora of private classifications” leads to “anomalies and contradictions and to conflicts both in the cognition of individuals and the interactions of individuals and groups” (88).\n\nBut the situation is not quite so simple. Even as the novel relates a loss of distinction and the confusion of values, it insists on the need to recontextualize within the new order, to resist the leveling.42 One central figure in this regard is the architect, whose profession not only evokes that of the author but also suggests an interest in structure and stability, an interest that reminds us of the journeyman’s speech on the occasion of the foundation stone ritual. He also owns a collection of diverse artifacts taken from old Germanic burial mounds: “tiny one-sided and weightier coins, seals” (123). As if to underscore the homogenizing impact of the fashionable commodity, the narrator explains how these artifacts have been arranged “in drawers and compartments on trays fitted into these and lined with cloth” such that these “ancient and solemn objects seemed in his handling of them almost modish, it was a pleasure to look at them, like looking into little trinket boxes at a milliner’s [Modehändlers]” (123).\n\nOn the one hand, such a description seems to confirm what James Bunn, with regard to the English context, has described as the eclectic aesthetic of the curio cabinet, an aesthetic that emerges as a consequence of commercialization, expanded trade, and the exotic imports that accompanied them. The central features of this “mercantile aesthetic” would appear to apply equally well to the architect’s collection: decontextualized objects combined “without consideration of a unifying principle,” which thus “no longer signify in a figure-ground relationship” but only in terms of a “circumscribed allusiveness among a collection of others.”43 And not just to his collection. As we have seen, processes of disembedding, decontextualization, and semiotic collapse suffuse the novel.44\n\nIn the case of the architect, however, the conclusion that these artifacts have been transformed into little more than an unrelated collection of fashionable diversions is undercut in a later passage. Here the novel draws a clear distinction between the discriminating care with which the owner treats his “treasures” (123) and the homogenizing extravagance of a figure like Luciane. Asked by Ottilie why he refused to bring out his collection during one of Luciane’s soirées, he responds: “If you knew…how roughly even cultured people handle the most precious works of art, you would forgive me for not wishing to have mine passed around. They seem not to know that a medal should be held along the edge. Instead they touch the face, however beautifully and cleanly stamped it is, they rub the loveliest pieces between finger and thumb as if that were the way to appreciate artistic forms!” (155). Particularly the rubbing movement described toward the end of this response, which evokes the typical approach to testing the quality and character of fabrics, seems calculated to highlight precisely that these artifacts are not the wares of a milliner and need not be treated as such.\n\nA further example of discrimination within the new (dis)order can be seen in the depiction of the tableaux vivants. Goethe’s ambivalence toward this form of entertainment is well documented, and it appears to have stemmed from the way the genre elides the distinction between art and life, thus vitiating attempts to treat the representation as an object of disinterested contemplation.45 As a transformation of a two-dimensional painting into a three-dimensional display, the tableaux might seem to counter the general tendency toward a loss of depth that the novel relates and criticizes. The loss of depth in this case, however, pertains to the balance of the faculties in play during the process of reception. The overwhelming power of the sensuous aspect of the presentation flattens the combination of sensory stimulation and reflective contemplation that constitutes the normative approach to painting. Brigitte Peucker, situating the tableaux within the context of the history of the visual arts, explains how they turn the material body itself into an image and thereby “collaps[e] as far as possible the distance between signifier and signified.”46\n\nOn a more superficial level, the skepticism toward the tableaux no doubt stemmed partly from their association with a commodified entertainment culture viewed by some as overrefined and excessive. The examples depicted in the novel can certainly be linked to commerce and luxury, both in terms of the expense required to stage them and in the sense that each of the paintings represented would have been known primarily through the popular engravings available for purchase.47 They were also associated in popular discourse with luxury consumption, as is made clear by Karl August Böttiger’s description of these displays as a “confection, which, at events where one expects lavish entertainments, is sometimes brought out as a dessert.”48 Goethe himself, in a journal entry from the Italienische Reise (Italian Journey) that anticipates key episodes in the novel, also places them in the context of financial extravagance. After first commenting on the Neapolitan fascination with Christmas nativity scenes, “for the outfitting of which the house expends great sums,” he goes on to describe living pictures as one of the most beloved entertainments of “high-ranking and wealthy families.”49\n\nIf, however, one can discern in the novel a general suspicion toward such entertainments, a distinction is nonetheless drawn between the tableaux featuring Luciane and the nativity scene in which Ottilie plays the lead role. Goethe’s description of the latter repeatedly draws attention to those details that render the display more than a mere imitation, that enable it to shed—quite literally—new light on such a familiar scene.50 The uniqueness of this particular effort stems in part from a “clever arrangement of the lighting” (157) but also from the serendipitous slumber of the child and from Ottilie’s inimitable “pose, bearing, expression and looks” (157). And yet another distinction is drawn in this passage, between the first staging of the image and a second, misguided attempt to turn the modest evening scene into an “image…of daylight and glory” (158). In the latter case, as a result of “a vast [unmäßige] illumination” (158) the texture-producing chiaroscuro of the original staging is bathed in a homogenizing light, an “infinite brightness” (158). One is reminded here of the narrator’s reference in Heinrich von Ofterdingen to the “skillful distribution of light, color, and shadow” that has been lost as a result of the homogenizing affluence of the modern age. To be sure, like so many of the representations in the novel, these scenes are characterized by an inscrutable ambiguity, and one can certainly agree with Jochen Hörisch’s claim that “the pathos-laden and sublime sounding ambiguities are clearly infused with a soberly objective, sometimes even sarcastic force.”51 One can never be sure, in other words, just how seriously to take the claims of the narrator. The juxtaposition of multiple variants of these “trivial” art forms, however, a juxtaposition that offers just one example of the mirroring so central to Goethe’s technique as a novelist, suggests an effort to establish meaningful distinctions, and this suggestion forces the reader to consider whether such distinctions are valid.52 One is reminded here of a remark made by Walter Benjamin in a remarkably similar context in the notes for his Arcades project: “And of course: isn’t it profaning Goethe to make a film of ‘Faust’; and isn’t there a world of difference between Faust as text and Faust as film? True. But isn’t there also a whole world of difference between a bad and a good film of ‘Faust’? It is never a matter of the “major,” but only of the dialectic contrasts, which often seem nothing more than nuances. But it is from them that life always springs anew.”53 If we consider the novel with Benjamin in mind, it becomes possible to read the disintegration of the symbolic order as a moment of opportunity, albeit one less relevant to the ethical and political spheres in general than to the ethical and political dimensions of literary production.\n\nLiterature as Myth\n\nThe key conceptual category for grasping this opportunity, I would argue, is that of myth. The mythic quality of Goethe’s novel has been a source of interest and controversy ever since Benjamin described the work as a “mythic shadowplay staged in the costumes of the Age of Goethe.”54 Others have since challenged this claim, whether by insisting on the work’s topicality or, more fundamentally, by casting the work as antimythic in its essence.55 These interpretations have illuminated important facets of the novel, but my own interest in myth takes a different approach to the question. In agreeing with Benjamin regarding the mythic character of the work, I am referring not so much to what Burkhardt Lindner terms the “inexorability of the narrated events” but to what virtually all scholars have agreed on as the symbolic mode of narration.56\n\nIn reading Goethe’s symbolism as mythic, I take my cue from the Victorian author and critic John Ruskin, who understood myth as a form of enigmatic allegory, or, in his more precise language, “a theory of the universe under the grotesque of a fairy tale.”57 What he means by this claim is simply that myths signal the existence of the deeper truths they intend to convey precisely through their inclusion of circumstances deemed by readers to be “extraordinary, or in the common use of the word, unnatural.”58 Ruskin had in mind such events as Hercules’s slaying of a water serpent in the lake of Lerna, but we might substitute the seemingly miraculous similarity of the infant Otto to Ottilie and the Hauptmann, or the resurrection of Nanny after her apparently dead limbs brush the gown of the truly deceased Ottilie. As Ruskin further explains, because stories like that of Hercules may be read simply as fantastic tales and thus generate no deeper reflection, “it will be wise in me to surprise your attention by adding some singular circumstance; for instance, that the water-snake had several heads, which revived as fast as they were killed, and which poisoned even the foot that trod upon them as they slept. And in proportion to the fullness of intended meaning I shall probably multiply and refine upon these improbabilities.”59 There is much that can be (and has been) said about Ruskin’s claims, and this is not the place for a detailed elucidation. The aspect of his theory relevant to this discussion, which may seem rather commonplace, is that it allows us to think of Die Wahlverwandtschaften as mythic without linking it (along the lines of Benjamin’s essay) to questions of fate or implying a connection to the ideologically dubious mythologizing of some German romanticism.\n\nStarting from Ruskin’s notion of myth as a polysemic and often ambivalent allegory, an iridescent hieroglyph that can contain multiple natural, moral, historical, and social resonances, we can grasp Goethe’s narrative strategies in Die Wahlverwandtschaften as strategies for creating depth.60 As such, they represent a variant of the same kind of singularization or even sacralization undertaken by Ottilie and Eduard, a means of resisting homogenization. The novel, in other words, counters at the level of narrative technique the loss of depth and the drive toward universal commensurability that seems to prevail at the level of plot. What makes this possible, moreover, is precisely the attenuation of a stable link between signifier and signified brought about by an expansion of the sphere of exchange. Returning to Kopytoff’s idea of informal singularization and focusing on the author rather than the characters of Ottilie and Eduard, we can reinterpret the loss of a social consensus regarding the space of singularity as a moment of tremendous creative opportunity, whereby a universe of objects with fixed signification gives way to one in which artifacts open themselves up to the possibility of new metaphorical resonances. Commodification poses threats on many levels, but it likewise expands the scope of potential literary creativity.\n\nOne of Goethe’s many achievements in Die Wahlverwandtschaften is to have taken advantage of this opportunity to a degree unmatched by his contemporaries, turning precisely those profane objects of the commodity sphere into repositories of deep and multifaceted symbolic resonance. Reading Benjamin’s interpretation against the grain, one might claim that the real force of his statement about the “mythic shadowplay” stems from the insight that precisely the “costumes” of the age of Goethe become the raw material for the construction of a mythically charged narrative. And not only the costumes—which are crucial—but a whole range of fairly trivial objects and events that the novel infuses with a mythic significance: a collection of coins and seals, a little chest, a goblet, a rowboat, and a Vorwerk, as well as concerts, a fireworks display, and, of course, an evening presentation of living pictures.\n\nGoethe’s profane illumination of the depths of reflection to which we can be led by quotidian objects gestures toward a new foundation for justifying literary practice as more than a mere superfluity. By way of a conclusion, I would like to offer just a few—admittedly somewhat speculative—remarks regarding how we might understand this foundation. Against the backdrop of debates about luxury and with the previously discussed novels in mind, Goethe’s approach can also be understood as an effort to reconnect the superfluous to the necessary, the latter being understood in this case not in terms of basic material needs but of existential significance. In this regard, the novel as edifice embodies the same sort of attempt to reintegrate the structural and the ornamental that finds expression in the foundation stone ritual. The dubious status of the novel as a primarily commercial genre makes such a strategy all the more comprehensible, and this insight allows us to place Die Wahlverwandtschaften within the category of antifiction that has served as one framework of interpretation throughout this study. Goethe’s work includes a variety of ironizing allusions to the tropes and plot conventions of the popular romance, from the subtle yet telling reference to Eduard’s “legendary [romanenhafte] fidelity” (10) to his rather overheated insistence that the success of the Hauptmann’s efforts to persuade Charlotte to divorce him be announced with “a few cannon shots” (205). To these must be added the reference to the book that indirectly causes the death of Otto, which the narrator describes as “one of those that draws a tender-hearted reader in and will not let go” (205).61 I would agree with Jochen Hörisch that the desire “to live as one reads” drives the catastrophes that shape the work, and that the fact “that they read becomes for the characters a source of calamity.”62 But I would also point out, first, that it is not reading per se but a certain kind of reading, of a certain kind of literature, that gives rise to disaster, and, second, that with this qualification, this position is shared by all of the authors considered in the previous chapters as well.\n\nA number of the more recent studies of the novel have elucidated Goethe’s extraordinarily complex intertextual practice, and Gabrielle Bersier in particular has composed an incisive and compelling interpretation of Die Wahlverwandtschaften as an elaborate parody of Friedrich Schlegel’s aesthetics. My primary objection to this form of radical contextualization is that it situates the ultimate significance of the novel in a localized literary border skirmish. In once again invoking the category of antifiction in regard to Die Wahlverwandtschaften, I want to suggest that we intentionally reduce the degree of precision with which we approach the text, zooming out to a somewhat higher level of abstraction in order to reveal those features of the topography that allow us to place Goethe into dialogue, not just with Schlegel or even romanticism more generally, but with broader transformations in the literary market and the sphere of cultural consumption. From this broader perspective, such ironizing allusions to the sentimental-romantic tradition indicate that Die Wahlverwandtschaften, like all of the novels considered in this study, employs a set of narrative techniques designed to restrict the dosage of pleasure and limit the generation of desire on the part of the reader. All of these techniques, which range from the crude didactic interventions of Campe’s father-narrator to the sophisticated container narratives of Wieland and Novalis, can be construed as ironic in a broad sense. Against this backdrop, the mirroring technique so often commented on in the scholarship on Goethe, which gradually reveals meaning through the juxtaposition of characters and episodes, appears in a new light. Rather than the expression of a general skepticism toward the possibility of meaning as such, as Hans Vaget has suggested, it comes into focus as a means to anchor pleasure to reflection, to balance the two. To write in such a way that “meaning has to be assembled in the reader’s mind from fragments and refractions” is to retard the forward momentum of plot and thus check readerly desire.63\n\nOn this reading, Goethe’s mirroring technique, as well as the sophisticated structural irony to which it is related, helps to constitute Goethe’s novel as another example of self-limiting luxury, a text that, like the novels of Campe, Wieland, Moritz, and Novalis but unlike those at the heart of attacks on reading mania, cannot be devoured (verschlungen). If the general unraveling related by the narrative suggests a profound skepticism toward the possibility of achieving a self-regulating equilibrium at the societal level, the narrative structure raises the possibility that this equilibrium has in fact been displaced to another level, where, in a manner similar to Novalis’s Heinrich von Ofterdingen, it manages to contain a remarkably high degree of dissonance within a work that is nonetheless experienced as a unity.64 However comprehensive the societal dissolution related by the plot of the novel, in other words, two hundred years of scholarship would seem to confirm that the work itself demonstrates an extraordinary—albeit extraordinarily complex—coherence.\n\nOne can also identify an additional level of engagement with the contemporary literary market in Die Wahlverwandtschaften, one that deemphasizes the opposition to romanticism so frequently adduced in recent scholarship and instead points to a literary-ideological strategy of domestication similar to the one deployed by Wieland in the case of Der goldne Spiegel (The Golden Mirror). We are indebted to Jane Brown for an insightful interpretation of how Die Wahlverwandtschaften appropriates and transforms the narrative codes of the English novel of manners. As Brown explains, “The novel…was preeminently an English genre, and the tradition in which Goethe was working was that of Richardson, Fielding, Sterne, and Goldsmith, the developing novel of manners.”65 There are indeed striking structural and plot similarities between Goethe’s novel and those of Jane Austen, especially Mansfield Park (1814). But the novels of these English authors also differ from Goethe’s work in crucial ways. Emil Staiger elucidates the primary distinction between Die Wahlverwandtschaften and the novel of manners by foregrounding Goethe’s mode of narration: the novel of manners depicts the world “as it is,” whereas Goethe’s novel is “symbolic.”66 Brown herself notes that while Mansfield Park may have a “pat, fairy-tale like ending,” it remains within a recognizable social world, unlike the “even more arbitrary and fairy-tale-like” union of lovers that concludes Die Wahlverwandtschaften.67 With Ruskin’s remarks on myth in mind, we can view such elements as examples of those “improbabilities” that help generate reflection. The symbolic or mythic mode of narration, in other words, can also be read in terms of an effort to reembed a more quotidian manner of representation, preoccupied with what might be seen as trivial forms of sociability, within a constellation of higher and thus more fundamental human concerns. If Goethe was generally admiring of those English authors who wrote novels of manners, he was far less enthusiastic about German imitators who produced formulaic sentimental novels of the “Yorick-Sterne” variety without “humorous irony of the British.”68"
