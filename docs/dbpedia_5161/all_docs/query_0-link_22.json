        "text": "The Outline of Cultural Materials, first developed by G.P. Murdock in the 1940s, is an ethnographic classification system on human behavior, social life and customs, material culture, and human-ecological environments. In the past, this indexing system was used in the paper and microfiche versions of the Collection of Ethnography. Today, the OCM subject thesaurus serves the eHRAF World Cultures and eHRAF Archaeology databases.\n\nOCM Print Copy\n\nA print copy of the OCM is 300+ pages, can be ordered from HRAF, and contains the following:\n\nA list of the 90+ major OCM categories (e.g. 750 Sickness)\n\nA list of the 700+ OCM subcategories (e.g. 751 Preventive Medicine, 753 Theory of Disease)\n\nDetailed descriptions of the OCM subjects\n\nAn alphabetic index of the OCM terms\n\nInformation about the types of subject categories, developmental perspectives, and the use of the OCM in field research\n\nOCM in eHRAF\n\nIn eHRAF World Cultures and eHRAF Archaeology, the OCM can be found in Browse Subjects, or used in the Add Subjects function of an Advanced Search. In a Basic Search it is used to automatically “map” keywords to the extensive OCM subject thesaurus.\n\nPDF Download\n\nA PDF file containing the list of OCM subjects can be found here.\n\nInteractive List of OCM Subjects with Descriptions\n\nBrowse the complete list of OCM subjects below. You can view the descriptions for each subject using the following links:\n\nExpand Main OCM Descriptions\n\nExpand all descriptions\n\nCollapse All\n\n000 MATERIAL NOT RELEVANT\n\nThis category is used to index text that, for several possible reasons, is not relevant. Reasons for indexing text with 000 include: the text is about a culture or tradition different from the one that this HRAF collection focuses on; the text is not about cultural information but rather is on something pertaining to the document, such as, it is a table of contents, it is the author statement on the title page, etc. ; the text consists of conjectures, personal data not relevant to the culture, etc. The term and scope note were revised in 2002.\n\n100 ORIENTATION\n\nThis category is used to index and find information especially likely to be needed by users of a collection as a frame of reference for understanding the materials classified elsewhere; organization of the file, special indexing decisions, and evaluation of the file. This category is not used in eHRAF. In eHRAF, the information is contained in a brief introduction to the collection, “Culture Summary: …”\n\n101 IDENTIFICATION\n\n102 MAPS\n\n103 PLACE NAMES\n\n104 GLOSSARY\n\n105 CULTURE SUMMARY\n\n106 CODED DATA\n\nThe concise, quantitative and/or qualitative expression or interpretation of cultural, social, ecological or other variables relating to human behavior; the data are classified into pre-conceived categories represented by number and/or letter codes. Common reasons for presenting data in coded form are to facilitate statistical analyses and/or cross-cultural comparisons.\n\n107 DIAGNOSTIC MATERIAL ATTRIBUTES\n\n110 INFORMATION SOURCES\n\nSources of information on the particular society as defined and described in the Outline of World Cultures, and data relevant to their evaluation. This term was called “Bibliography” until 1997.\n\n111 CITATIONS OF DOCUMENTS IN THE HRAF COLLECTION\n\nFull bibliographical citations to all documents included, with a brief abstract of each. Documents are numbered. This category is relevant only to the microfiche and paper collections. The bibliographical citations in the eHRAF collections are called “citation”, not 111. The method of retrieval depends on the medium you are using. This term does not appear in the electronic version of HRAF. Instead, in the electronic version a full citation you may search for citations and they are browsable in several ways. This term was called “Sources Processed” until 1997.\n\n112 ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nHRAF compiled bibliographical citations, some annotated, to documents reviewed but not included in the HRAF collection. This term was called “Sources Consulted” until 1997.\n\n113 BIBLIOGRAPHIES IN SOURCES\n\nWorks referred to in the documents included in the HRAF collections. This term replaced the term “Additional References” in 1997. In addition, in 1997 a term on artifact and archive collections was introduced. For information on artifact and archive collections indexed before 1997, use this term. For information on artifact and archive collections indexed after 1997, use term 119. Descriptor shortened IN 2012 from INFORMATION SOURCES LISTED IN OTHER WORKS.\n\n114 REVIEWS AND CRITIQUES\n\n115 INFORMANTS\n\n116 COMPLETE TEXTS OF HRAF DOCUMENTS\n\n117 FIELD DATA\n\n118 FICTION\n\n119 ARTIFACT AND ARCHIVE COLLECTIONS\n\n120 RESEARCH METHODS\n\nThese subject headings are used to index descriptions and discussions of methods used by ethnographers, archaeologists, and others. Category 120 includes general statements about factors affecting the consistency, reliability, and validity of the data obtained. For information on specific factors regarding reliability, consistency, and validity in the use of specific techniques or methods use the appropriate categories. This term replaced “Methodology of Research” in 2000.\n\n121 THEORETICAL ORIENTATION\n\nResearch aims and objectives (e.g., complete ethnographic description, study of a particular institution or culture complex, testing of a theoretical hypothesis); general theoretical approach (e.g., historical, functional, psychological); formulation of research program; reasons for choice of particular field site or archaeological site; theoretical results; research strategy employed (e.g., ethnographic, survey, excavation, museographic, ethnoarcheological investigation), etc. Descriptor replaced “Theoretical Orientation” in 1997. The scope note was updated in 2000. Restored descriptor in 2012 from THEORETICAL ORIENTATION IN RESEARCH AND ITS RESULTS.\n\n1210 ARCHAEOLOGICAL EXCAVATION METHODS\n\n1211 DATING METHODS IN ARCHAEOLOGY\n\nStatements about how an archaeological site, unit, stratum, or non-artifactual constituent, etc. was dated and what methods were used (absolute versus relative dating, Carbon-14, thermoluminescence, archaeomagnetism, obsidian hydration, etc.), This category is used to index discussions about what was used for the sample (that is, what was dated), how the sample was extracted in the field, where the sample was processed, and how the sample was processed. This category, term, and scope note were introduced in 1997. The scope note was rewritten completely in 2000.\n\n1212 LABORATORY ANALYSIS IN ARCHAEOLOGY\n\nDescriptions of archaeological laboratory methods including physiochemical analysis methods in archaeology such as X-ray spectrometry, neutron activation of trace elements, mineralogy, and palynology; how and where the artifacts and non-artifactual constituents were processed once they were excavated; techniques and equipment used; problems encountered, etc. This category includes descriptions of methods used to analyze faunal and floral remains for archaeological and non-archaeological purposes (e.g., analysis of plants for their pharmacological properties, shellfish analysis, laboratory analyses for ethnographic studies not found elsewhere, etc. This category, term, and scope note were introduced in 1997. The scope note was rewritten completely in 2000. The Descriptor was shortened in 2012 from LABORATORY ANALYSIS OF MATERIALS OTHER THAN DATING METHODS IN ARCHAEOLOGY.\n\n1213 EXPERIMENTAL DATA\n\n122 PRACTICAL PREPARATIONS OF FIELDWORK\n\nSource(s) of financial support (expedition expenses, cost of publishing results, etc.); selection and assembly of equipment; coping with problems of transportation and bureaucratic red tape; familiarization with previous descriptive literature; learning language; living conditions in the field; etc. This term replaced “Practical Preparations” in 1997. Changed again from PRACTICAL PREPARATIONS IN CONDUCTING FIELDWORK in 2012.\n\n123 OBSERVATION IN RESEARCH\n\n124 INTERVIEWING IN RESEARCH\n\n125 TESTS AND SCHEDULES IN THE FIELD\n\n126 RECORDING AND COLLECTING IN THE FIELD\n\n127 HISTORICAL AND ARCHIVAL RESEARCH\n\n128 ORGANIZATION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS\n\n129 ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY METHODS\n\nThis category is used to index statements on archaeological survey methods such as thermography, electricity, magnetism, radio waves, etc.; sampling techniques; methods of determining site location, extent, occupation periods, etc. Use of non-invasive techniques such as remote sensing, aerial imaging, etc. Monitoring of archaeological sites before or after excavation, especially archaeological monitoring done during construction work. This category, term, and scope note were introduced in 1997. The scope note was updated in 2005.\n\n130 GEOGRAPHY\n\n131 LOCATION\n\n132 CLIMATE\n\n133 TOPOGRAPHY AND GEOLOGY\n\n134 SOIL\n\n135 MINERAL RESOURCES\n\n136 FAUNA\n\n137 FLORA\n\n138 POST DEPOSITIONAL PROCESSES\n\nDiscussions of how an archaeological site, its cultural strata, and its artifacts and non-artifactual constituents were affected by the natural and cultural environment after being deposited and before being excavated. These processes include erosion, floods, animal use of the site such as pack rat middens or animal burrows, taphonomic processes not discussed elsewhere, looting of the site, human disturbances of the site and its artifacts, and differential preservation of artifacts and non-artifactual constituents. This category, term, and scope note were introduced in 1997. The scope note was updated in 2000. Descriptor shortened in 2012 from POST DEPOSITIONAL PROCESSES IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES.\n\n140 HUMAN BIOLOGY\n\n141 ANTHROPOMETRY\n\n142 DESCRIPTIVE SOMATOLOGY\n\nColor of skin, hair, and eyes; form, length, and distribution of hair; musculature; secondary sexual characteristics; physical descriptions; etc.\n\n143 GENETICS\n\n144 RACIAL IDENTIFICATION\n\n145 ONTOGENETIC DATA\n\n146 NUTRITION\n\n147 PHYSIOLOGICAL DATA\n\n150 BEHAVIOR PROCESSES AND PERSONALITY\n\n151 SENSATION AND PERCEPTION\n\n152 DRIVES AND EMOTIONS\n\n153 MODIFICATION OF BEHAVIOR\n\n154 ADJUSTMENT PROCESSES\n\n155 PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT\n\n156 SOCIAL PERSONALITY\n\n157 PERSONALITY TRAITS\n\n158 PERSONALITY DISORDERS\n\n159 LIFE HISTORY MATERIALS\n\n160 DEMOGRAPHY\n\nThis category contains general statements covering several distinct types of information on population, including vital statistics.

Since separate files will be prepared on each major historical period for societies with an appreciable known time depth, the narrower terms are designed to include only (a) information bearing upon the society’s prehistory and (b) historical data for the specific time period which do not readily fall into particular categories elsewhere in this thesaurus.\n\n171 COMPARATIVE EVIDENCE\n\n1710 CULTURAL REVITALIZATION AND ETHNOGENESIS\n\n172 PREHISTORY\n\n173 TRADITIONAL HISTORY\n\n174 HISTORICAL RECONSTRUCTION\n\n175 HISTORY\n\n176 INNOVATION\n\n177 ACCULTURATION AND CULTURE CONTACT\n\n178 SOCIOCULTURAL TRENDS\n\n179 ECONOMIC PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n180 TOTAL CULTURE\n\nSummary statements on the total culture as analyzed, interpreted, or described. The 18* categories are intended to include descriptive and interpretive materials which pertain to the entire culture or which override a number of more specific categories. Consequently much of the material pertinent to the individual topics below will be found only under other headings.\n\n181 ETHOS\n\n182 FUNCTIONAL/ADAPTATIONAL INTERPRETATIONS\n\n183 NORMS\n\n184 CULTURAL PARTICIPATION\n\n185 CULTURAL GOALS\n\n186 CULTURAL IDENTITY AND PRIDE\n\n190 LANGUAGE\n\n191 SPEECH\n\n192 VOCABULARY\n\n193 GRAMMAR\n\n194 PHONOLOGY\n\n195 SOCIOLINGUISTICS\n\n196 SEMANTICS\n\nGeneral problems of meaning and linguistic symbolism; semantics of morphological and lexical elements; affectual connotation (e.g., tone of voice, rapidity of delivery); multiple contextual definitions of words and phrases; semantic drift; etc.\n\n197 LINGUISTIC IDENTIFICATION\n\n198 SPECIAL LANGUAGES\n\n200 COMMUNICATION\n\n201 GESTURES AND SIGNS\n\n2010 INTERNET COMMUNICATIONS\n\n202 TRANSMISSION OF MESSAGES\n\n203 DISSEMINATION OF NEWS AND INFORMATION\n\n204 PRESS\n\n205 MAIL\n\n206 TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH\n\n207 RADIO AND TELEVISION\n\n208 PUBLIC OPINION\n\n209 PROXEMICS\n\n210 RECORDS\n\n211 MNEMONIC DEVICES\n\n212 WRITING\n\n213 PRINTING\n\n214 PUBLISHING\n\n215 PHOTOGRAPHY\n\n216 AUDIOVISUAL RECORDS AND EQUIPMENT\n\n217 ARCHIVES\n\n218 WRITING AND PRINTING SUPPLIES\n\n220 FOOD QUEST\n\n221 ANNUAL CYCLE\n\n222 COLLECTING\n\n223 FOWLING\n\n224 HUNTING AND TRAPPING\n\n225 MARINE HUNTING\n\n226 FISHING\n\n227 FISHING GEAR\n\n228 MARINE INDUSTRIES\n\n230 ANIMAL HUSBANDRY\n\n231 DOMESTICATED ANIMALS\n\n232 APPLIED ANIMAL SCIENCE\n\n233 PASTORAL ACTIVITIES\n\n234 DAIRYING\n\n235 POULTRY RAISING\n\n236 WOOL PRODUCTION\n\n237 ANIMAL BY-PRODUCTS\n\n240 AGRICULTURE\n\n241 TILLAGE\n\n242 AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE\n\n243 CEREAL AGRICULTURE\n\n244 VEGETABLE PRODUCTION\n\n245 ARBORICULTURE\n\n246 FORAGE CROPS\n\n247 FLORICULTURE\n\n248 TEXTILE AGRICULTURE\n\n249 SPECIAL CROPS\n\n250 FOOD PROCESSING\n\nGeneral statements dealing with several aspects of the techniques by which foodstuffs are transformed from their original state into forms more suitable for preservation or consumption.\n\n251 PRESERVATION AND STORAGE OF FOOD\n\n252 FOOD PREPARATION\n\n253 MEAT PACKING INDUSTRY\n\n254 REFRIGERATION INDUSTRY\n\n255 CANNING INDUSTRY\n\n256 CEREAL INDUSTRY\n\n257 CONFECTIONERY INDUSTRIES\n\n258 OTHER FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES\n\n260 FOOD CONSUMPTION\n\nGeneral statements covering various aspects pertaining directly to the eating of food.\n\n261 GRATIFICATION AND CONTROL OF HUNGER\n\n262 DIET\n\n263 CONDIMENTS\n\n264 EATING\n\n265 FOOD SERVICE INDUSTRIES\n\n266 CANNIBALISM\n\n270 DRINK AND DRUGS\n\nGeneral statements covering several aspects of the allaying of thirst and special appetite cravings, with the manufacture of artificial means of satisfying them, and with the preparation of drugs for other purposes.

Material concerning the property system as a whole will be filed in Category 421. The term “property” is to be distinguished from wealth, material possessions, or any object of ownership. It is to be understood only in the strict technical sense of the jural relations of people with regard to some subject matter and governing the use and enjoyment of the latter. In precise usage, a “right” is correlated with a “duty” (if A has a right against B, B is under a corresponding duty toward A); a “privilege” is correlated with “no right” (if A has a privilege as against B, B has no right against A, instead of a duty); a “power” is correlated with “liability” (if A has a power as against B, B is under a liability that his jural relations may be changed by a voluntary act on the past of A). A “title” is a distinct constellation of rights, privileges, and powers with respect to some subject matter. A “type of ownership” refers to the social composition of the holders of a title, e.g., an individual, a partnership, a clan, a corporation, a state. A “property transaction” is an act which transfers a title to a new owner.

Society is a structure of interpersonal relationships, i.e., sets of reciprocally adjusted habitual responses between pairs of interacting individuals. These tend widely to become culturally defined or standardized in terms of polar statuses. A social group arises whenever a number of specific individuals are linked, each to every other, by relationships of the same general types, e.g., friendship, kinship, or coresidence. Groups likewise reveal a marked tendency to become culturally standardized. The categories below are concerned with the general characteristics of interpersonal relationships and social groups, with some of their more voluntary forms, and with the unifying standards and disruptive influences typical of social relationships and groups in general.\n\n571 SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS AND GROUPS\n\n572 FRIENDSHIPS\n\n573 CLIQUES\n\n574 VISITING AND HOSPITALITY\n\n575 SODALITIES\n\n576 ETIQUETTE\n\n577 ETHICS\n\n578 INGROUP ANTAGONISMS\n\n579 BRAWLS, RIOTS, AND BANDITRY\n\n580 MARRIAGE\n\nGeneral statements dealing with several specific aspects of marriage.

In every society, individuals maintain interpersonal relationships, characterized by particular kinship terms and culturally patterned behavior, with each type of relative recognized by the prevailing kinship system. In addition, an individual is normally affiliated with one or more kin groups, each consisting of some, but not all, of his relatives. By “descent” is meant a cultural rule defining the types of relatives with whom an individual is affiliated in a kin group. It need not, and commonly does not, imply that these relatives are more closely akin to him than are those who do not belong to the same group. The major types of kin groups are defined in the narrower terms.\n\n611 RULE OF DESCENT\n\n612 KINDREDS AND RAMAGES\n\n613 LINEAGES\n\n614 CLANS\n\n615 PHRATRIES\n\n616 MOIETIES\n\n617 BILINEAL KIN GROUPS\n\n618 LOCALIZED KIN GROUPS\n\n619 TRIBE AND NATION\n\n620 COMMUNITY\n\n621 COMMUNITY STRUCTURE\n\n622 COMMUNITY HEADS\n\n623 COMMUNITY COUNCILS\n\n624 LOCAL OFFICIALS\n\n625 POLICE\n\n626 SOCIAL CONTROL\n\n627 INFORMAL IN-GROUP JUSTICE\n\n628 INTER-COMMUNITY RELATIONS\n\n629 INTER-ETHNIC RELATIONS\n\n630 TERRITORIAL ORGANIZATION\n\nGeneral statements dealing with several distinct levels of political territorial organization. Statements dealing with territorial hierarchy will be indexed for TERRITORIAL HIERARCHY (631). Material on political institutions of administrative or territorial units intermediate in size or functional scope between the community and the state, the sovereign or maximal political unit will be filed in the three digit categories below. It will be used only for societies of some political complexity, not for those in which communities are politically independent or for those with petty states embracing only a single district or a small city with its environs. The individual categories represent increasing levels of size and complexity, but since these are not universally comparable they must be considered subject to modification in order to adapt them to the actual territorial units of particular societies.\n\n631 TERRITORIAL HIERARCHY\n\n632 TOWNS\n\n633 CITIES\n\n634 DISTRICTS\n\nPolitical organization of moderately extensive territories embracing a number of settlements or municipalities (e.g., a subtribe, an English or American county, a French department); governmental personnel (e.g., executive, advisory, administrative, legislative); mode of selection (e.g., appointment, election, hereditary succession); jurisdiction, authority, prerogatives, functions, and activities associated with each position, etc.\n\n635 PROVINCES\n\n636 DEPENDENCIES\n\n640 GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS\n\n641 CITIZENSHIP\n\n642 FORM AND RULES OF GOVERNMENT\n\n643 CHIEF EXECUTIVE\n\n644 EXECUTIVE HOUSEHOLD\n\n645 ADVISERS TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE\n\n646 DELIBERATIVE COUNCILS\n\n647 ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES\n\n648 EXTERNAL RELATIONS\n\n650 GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES\n\nGeneral statements dealing with several aspects of the administrative activities of all governmental agencies usually above the level of the small local community.\n\n651 TAXATION AND PUBLIC INCOME\n\n652 PUBLIC FINANCE\n\n653 PUBLIC WORKS\n\n654 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n655 GOVERNMENT ENTERPRISES\n\n656 GOVERNMENT REGULATION\n\n657 PUBLIC WELFARE\n\n658 PUBLIC EDUCATION\n\n659 MISCELLANEOUS GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES\n\n660 POLITICAL BEHAVIOR\n\n661 EXPLOITATION\n\n662 POLITICAL INTRIGUE\n\n663 PUBLIC SERVICE\n\n664 PRESSURE POLITICS\n\n665 POLITICAL PARTIES\n\n666 ELECTIONS\n\n667 POLITICAL MACHINES\n\n668 POLITICAL MOVEMENTS\n\n669 REVOLUTION\n\n670 LAW\n\nGeneral statements dealing with several aspects of customary or imposed norms of behavior for violations of which sanctions may be enforced by some agent or agency of the politically organized community or state, and not alone through informal mechanisms of social control.\n\n671 LEGAL NORMS\n\n672 LIABILITY\n\n673 WRONGS\n\n674 CRIME\n\n675 CONTRACTS\n\n676 AGENCY\n\n677 ORGANIZED CRIME\n\n680 OFFENSES AND SANCTIONS\n\n681 SANCTIONS\n\n682 OFFENSES AGAINST LIFE\n\n683 OFFENSES AGAINST THE PERSON\n\n684 SEX AND MARITAL OFFENSES\n\n685 PROPERTY OFFENSES\n\n686 NONFULFILLMENT OF OBLIGATIONS\n\n687 OFFENSES AGAINST THE STATE\n\n688 RELIGIOUS OFFENSES\n\n689 SOCIAL OFFENSES\n\n690 JUSTICE\n\n691 LITIGATION\n\n692 JUDICIAL AUTHORITY\n\n693 LEGAL AND JUDICIAL PERSONNEL\n\n694 INITIATION OF JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS\n\n695 TRIAL PROCEDURE\n\n696 EXECUTION OF JUSTICE\n\n697 PRISONS AND JAILS\n\n698 SPECIAL COURTS\n\n700 ARMED FORCES\n\nGeneral statements covering several distinct aspects of specialized military organization.
