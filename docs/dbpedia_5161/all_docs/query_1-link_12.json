        "text": "Alice Hauptmann is one of those commanding, complacent women who draw you close to make sure you keep your distance. Her surface warmth is so great that, even though you should know better, it’s a shock when you become aware of a core of ice within her that leaves you frostbitten. She’s supremely charming company and she’s scary as hell. It is probably a blessing that they don’t make them like her anymore.\n\nBut if you’re one of the lucky few whom she has summoned to tea this month at her Fifth Avenue maisonette near the Metropolitan Museum, I strongly urge you to accept. It’s highly unlikely that your paths will cross otherwise, since Mrs. Hauptmann doesn’t normally make herself so available.\n\nNor — and this is the real draw — does Zoe Caldwell, the great actress who is embodying her with such merciless detail in the Soho Rep’s site-specific production of David Adjmi’s “Elective Affinities,” which opened on Friday night in an Upper East Side apartment. (The address is given only to those with tickets, of which there are about 30 for each performance.)\n\nMs. Caldwell — who has won leading-actress Tony Awards for portraying three women of charismatic power (Jean Brodie, Medea and Maria Callas) — is one of the few performers alive who could make Mrs. Hauptmann as credible and fantastical as she must be. (Marian Seldes, to whom this play is dedicated and who was instrumental in its creation, is another.) It’s not just that she has the unassailably grand, old-school presence that Alice requires.\n\nNow in her late 70s, Ms. Caldwell is also old enough and worldly enough to have come across some of the last of the real-life Alices, members of a vanishing social class who have never doubted their pedigrees or entitlement. And, boy, does Ms. Caldwell nail the type, while making Alice so intimately individual that you have the impression that you’ve been her reluctant but enthralled confidant for years. It’s only after the mere but full-feeling half-hour you’ve spent with her, when you’re on your way home to your shabby little digs, that you realize Alice is a full-blown allegory.\n\nTheatergoers familiar with Mr. Adjmi’s earlier plays — aggressively stylized satires like “Stunning” and “The Evildoers” — are likely to anticipate the poisonous political pulse that animates this portrait of a lady, which runs through Dec. 18. But that doesn’t mean they won’t be disarmed by the flirtatious artistry of “Elective Affinities,” in both its writing and its performance.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
