        "text": "The 19th edition of Forum Expanded presents 19 cinematic works from 20 countries. The selected films, installations and performances repeatedly draw our attention to communities – their constitution, the breaking points they face and the dangers and constraints to which they are exposed to. What becomes apparent are the frequently convoluted ways in which these communities end up having to live in order to secure their continued existence. The works evoke solidarity, cohesion and hope by highlighting permanent connections – familial or elective affinities which subvert social norms. Everyday objects and materials are metaphorically repurposed as a means of exploring hidden networks whose multifaceted nodes become visible in unexpected places.\n\nIn Praise of Slowness by Hicham Gardaf observes street vendors in Tangier selling liquid bleach. This specific profession is disappearing in the maelstrom of an ever-accelerating global economy. The slowness of the vendors and their characteristic shouts to advertise their wares comes across like a final physical manifestation of resistance.\n\nZhou Tao also examines economic expansion and its real-world effects in The Periphery of the Base. In the Gobi Desert, an infrastructure project is under construction, whose massive scale seems to swallow up the people working there. The camera scans the desert wasteland and occasionally captures – as if by chance – small events and conversations between the migrant workers on the construction site.\n\nhold on to her by Robin Vanbesien focuses on self-organisation in the fight against government misconduct. It documents the collective efforts of a group of victims, activists and other supporters to process a case of police and state violence against migrants in Belgium: a little girl is killed by a police bullet during a car chase. A film about care and solidarity in the face of deadly border regimes.\n\nIn her film detours while speaking of monsters, Deniz Şimşek sets off in search of a sea monster that roams the imaginarium of her homeland: a work about the politics of mythology as well as the filmmaker’s relationship to her father.\n\nFamily relations and myths are also examined in Grandmamauntsistercat by Zuza Banasińska. Created from archival materials from communist Poland and drawing on the Slavic witch figure Baba Jaga, the film tells the story of a multispecies matriarchal family through the eyes of a child grappling with the reproduction of ideological and representational systems.\n\nFar-reaching, hidden networks in the form of underground rhizomes and branching networks of fungi form the basis for the 16mm film performance Nanacatepec by Azucena Losana and Elena Pardo. The two artists use multiple projections of films and objects to create an irresistible visual eddy of nature shots and shadow plays.\n\nFor the first time this year, the main hall of silent green’s underground Betonhalle will not be used for a group exhibition of film and video installations, but functions instead as a 260-seat-cinema for Forum Expanded, Forum and Berlinale Shorts.\n\nInstallations remain part of the Forum Expanded programme however, with works installed in the adjacent rooms of the Betonhalle.\n\nAmong the works shown is Prapat Jiwarangsan’s Myanmar Anatomy, a research on three sites in Yangon – Yangon Zoological Gardens, Yangon Circle Railway and the Drug Elimination Museum – which is juxtaposed with interviews with Burmese refugees. Also on view is the first release by Little Egypt Collective (Theresa Delsoin, Lisa Marie Malloy, J.P. Sniadecki, Ray Whitaker). On the Battlefield stages a sound recordist reconnecting with the flat fields where once stood Pyramid Courts – the housing projects that formed the heart of the Black community of the Little Egypt region of southern Illinois.\n\nForum Expanded is curated by Ala Younis and Ulrich Ziemons (section heads), as well as Karina Griffith and Shai Heredia.\n\nThe films of Forum Expanded 2024"
