It follows the dynamics which ensue when a couple invite two other people. The film is based on Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's 1809 novel Elective Affinities. It was released by the DEFA film studio on 27 August 1974.[1]\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nBeata Tyszkiewicz as Charlotte\n\nHilmar Thate as Eduard\n\nMagda Vasary as Ottilie\n\nGerry Wolff as the Captain\n\nHorst Schulze as Mittler\n\nChristine Schorn as Baroness\n\nVolkmar Kleinert as Count\n\nJana Plichtová as Luciane\n\nNico Turoff as gardener\n\nJost Braun as architect\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nThe journal Film-Dienst wrote: \"In the historical scenography and in the dialogue, the film misses the issues of the original work; shortenings and tightenings occasionally make the developments incomprehensible. What in Goethe is presented as a clash of moral and natural laws, appears in the film as a questioning of norms, moral and ethics of civil marriage. For literature fans still a remarkable contribution.\"[2]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
