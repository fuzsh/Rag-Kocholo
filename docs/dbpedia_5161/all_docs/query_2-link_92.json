Here he experiments with color, separating day-to-day dreariness in b&w, from scenes in color conveying an optimistic, imaginative vitality.\n\nOfficials criticized this satirical comedy, with music by the East German rock band The Puhdys, for showing a “distorted image of the working class.” Despite its very limited release, it quickly became an insiders’ tip."
