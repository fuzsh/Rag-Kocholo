        "text": ".\n\n.\n\n.\n\nRidley Scott’s first feature The Duellists (1977) is a feast for the eyes – and I was surprised to find out that its impressive cinematography did not secure a brilliant future career for Frank Tidy. The film does not so much quote specific paintings; rather it displays the director’s keen eye for composition, unmistakable feeling for the period, and more than a superficial knowledge of European art. One thing I have always admired in Ridley Scott’s films is precisely the visual and compositional aspect of them, the insistence on details and the capturing of an atmosphere that transports the viewer into the materiality of the world represented. I have been waiting many years to catch the film (I was hoping it would be on the big screen, but the DVD with Scott’s commentary was an additional treat), and I’m more than happy to add my visual commentary to it: stills as paintings with titles, related to actual paintings.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n."
