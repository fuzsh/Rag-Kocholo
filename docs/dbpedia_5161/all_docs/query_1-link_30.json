        "text": "What are learning theories in education, and how do they impact teachers and students? How many learning theories exist, in what key ways do they differ from each other, and what goals or objectives do they share in common? These are just a few of the questions we’ll answer in this overview, which compares major theories of learning like Behaviorism, Cognitivism, and Constructivism — plus offers tips for educators on how to implement them.\n\nIn This Article:\n\nWhat Are Learning Theories?\n\nWhat Are the 5 Major Learning Theories?\n\nThe Importance of Understanding Learning Theory\n\nHow to Implement Learning Theories in the Classroom\n\nStudy Learning Theories at National University\n\nWhether you’re an experienced teacher who wants new ideas for putting learning theories into practice, or you’re still considering whether a career in education could be right for you, this guide will help provide you with insight into some core teaching principles that educators should be aware of. Read on to learn all about learning theories, why they matter, and how you can make them work for your students.\n\nWhat Are Learning Theories?\n\nIn simple terms, theories of learning are ideas about the ways students learn and retain information. As Cynthia Schubert-Irastorza, Ed. D., Academic Program Director for Inspired Teaching and Learning for the Sanford College of Education, explains, “Learning theories help educators understand the process of learning. Understanding and application of these theories is essential for effective instruction and successful curriculum development”. These principles provide different frameworks that teachers can use to adapt to students’ diverse learning styles and academic needs.\n\nIn addition to helping students absorb the information being taught, learning theories can also help teachers manage students’ behavior. This empowers educators to create an atmosphere that’s more inclusive and conducive to learning — a skill that’s essential whether teaching online or in a traditional classroom setting.\n\nThere are significant differences between most theories of learning. However, what all of them share in common is that they seek to understand and explain the learning process so that educators can act accordingly, taking approaches to teaching that are appropriate, effective, and efficient.\n\nSo how and when did this field get started? While humans have been pondering the process of learning and the nature of knowledge throughout history — notably including philosophers like Plato and Descartes — the first formal research on learning was conducted by psychologists during the 1800s. As fields like psychology have continued to develop, various learning theories have been proposed over time, from the principles of Cognitivism developed during the 1950s to the Experiential Learning Theory (ELT) proposed by David Kolb in 1984. More recently, Connectivism has emerged as “the 21st century’s new learning theory.”\n\nThere are numerous theories of learning, with new ones sure to emerge in the future while others fade and become obsolete. Although most sources tend to identify three to five core theories — a few of which, like Behaviorism and Constructivism, are discussed in detail here — some identify as many as 31 learning theories in total! (For instance, some of the theories not covered in this guide include Pragmatic Education Theory, Self-Determination Theory, and Flow Theory.)\n\nOne of the most significant learning theories is the theory of social learning put forth by psychologist Albert Bandura in 1977, when his influential book Social Learning Theory was published. Continue reading to learn more about Bandura’s Social Learning Theory (SLT) and its continuing impact on contemporary approaches to education.\n\nAlbert Bandura’s Social Learning Theory (SLT)\n\nSocial learning proposes that individuals learn through the observation of “models,” such as friends and family members, movie and television characters, or — most significantly for educators — their teachers and other authority figures at school. According to Social Learning Theory, observers process and think about what they witness being modeled, which — combined with environmental factors — results in the assimilation and imitation of positive or negative behaviors. During the 1980s, Bandura broadened and renamed his theory to “Social Cognitive Theory,” or SCT.\n\nSLT (and its offshoot, SCT) remain relevant to contemporary educators at all grade levels — not to mention brands and corporations. For example, according to one study, “Due to the affinity that Generation Z learners show toward technology advances and supporting social learning tools, the overall teaching-learning experience was perceived [as] more positive and rewarding.” The same research, which was published last year in Frontiers in Education, found that “social learning tools can enhance the teaching-learning experience of generation Z learners.” Some organizations, such as the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL), are even dedicated to advancing social learning as a driver of better and more equitable educational opportunities for children.\n\nWhat Are the 5 Major Learning Theories?\n\nA variety of learning theories have arisen within, and impacted the course of, the field of education. But these theories aren’t just abstract ideas, or academic concepts — on the contrary, they’re practical approaches to education that teachers can put into use in order to help students learn more effectively at every age.\n\nThat’s an important topic that we’ll discuss more later on in this guide, where we’ll share a few tips and strategies for utilizing theories of learning in the classroom. For now, let’s look at some key differences between five of the most prominent learning theories: Behaviorism, Cognitivism, Connectivism, Constructivism, and Humanism.\n\nBehaviorism\n\nFounded by John B. Watson (but widely associated with Ivan Pavlov and B.F. Skinner), Behaviorism is the idea that — like Bandura’s Social Learning Theory — children learn by observing the behavior of others, whether adults and authority figures or friends and peers their own age. In Behaviorism, the learner’s mind is a “blank slate” ready to absorb knowledge — and repetition and reinforcement play a key role in communicating with students.\n\nFor instance, the teacher will use either negative or positive reinforcement, which respectively means subtracting (“negative”) or adding (“positive”) something, in order to reinforce the desired behavior (or discourage an undesired behavior). An example of positive reinforcement might be rewarding or praising a behavior like volunteering during group discussions.\n\nCognitivism\n\nIntroduced during the middle of the 20th century, Cognitivism shifts away from Behaviorism to place a heavier emphasis on the internal thoughts of the observer, as opposed to merely observing others’ behavior and responding to stimuli. In contrast to Behaviorism, Cognitivism holds that learning chiefly takes place while the student is working to break down and organize new information in their mind.\n\nJournaling is frequently suggested as a helpful classroom exercise that uses the principles of Cognitivism. We’ll explore some additional ways of applying Cognitivism and other learning theories at the end of this guide.\n\nConstructivism\n\nAccording to Constructivist Learning Theory, or CLT, students learn new information by building upon — or in other words, constructing — knowledge they’ve already gained. This represents a more active approach to learning, as opposed to an approach like Behaviorism, where students arguably take a more passive role in learning.\n\nCognitive Constructivism is associated with Jean Piaget, while Social Constructivism is linked to pioneer Lev Vygotsky. Read more about the differences between Social and Cognitive Constructivist Theory.\n\nHumanism\n\nFounded by pioneers like Carl Rogers, James F. T. Bugental, and Abraham Maslow (whose famous “Hierarchy of Needs” you’re likely already familiar with), Humanist Learning Theory (HLT) is a learner-centric approach to education. Humanist Learning Theory places a heavier emphasis on the learner themselves — and their untapped potential — rather than the methods of learning or the materials being taught. Built on the premise that humans are fundamentally good and will act appropriately if their basic needs are met, HLT prioritizes meeting the unique emotional and academic needs of each learner so that they are empowered to take greater control over their own education.\n\nConnectivism\n\nConnectivism, as we mentioned above, has been called a learning theory for the 21st century. But, other than its relatively recent introduction as a theory of learning, what makes Connectivism so useful and relevant to the modern student — and educator?\n\nCritically, Connectivist Learning Theory makes effective use of technology, which is an essential tool for learning — particularly among Generation Z students and future generations. Connectivism also places a strong emphasis on the ability to find and sift through information in order to conduct reliable research. Some examples of a Connectivist approach to teaching might be to have your students write a blog or launch a podcast together — activities that merge technology with group and community interaction.\n\nSupplemental Learning Theories\n\nThere are many additional learning theories that educators may be interested in exploring further. One example is andragogy — or, in everyday language, adult education — which follows different rules and principles than pedagogy (education for children). For example, pedagogy involves the teacher as a central leader of classroom activities, whereas andragogy leans more heavily toward self-direction and student-led learning. Another theory to consider exploring further is the “Learning as a Network” or LaaN Theory, which one 2012 study defined as a “new learning theory characterized by the convergence of KM [Knowledge Management] and TEL [Technology-Enhanced Learning] within a learner-centric knowledge environment.\n\nThe Role of Motivation in Learning\n\nEver wonder why some students are extremely engaged, and others seem to drift? A lot of it comes down to motivation. Think of it like the fuel that keeps the learning engine running. There are two main types of motivation: intrinsic motivation, which is about internal personal interest, and extrinsic motivation, which revolves around external factors such as rewards, grades, or praise.\n\nTeachers play a large role in sparking that motivation. One great way to do this is by giving students choices—when they feel they have a say, they’re more likely to get excited about their work. Providing clear goals is another way to inspire motivation. When students know exactly what they’re aiming for, it’s easier for them to stay focused and driven. It’s all about striking the right balance between intrinsic and extrinsic motivators to not only help students succeed academically but also to cultivate a genuine love for learning.\n\nThe Importance of Understanding Learning Theory\n\nWhy are learning theories important, and what value do they hold for educators and students? Put simply, they provide actionable insight into how learning occurs — insight which, ideally, should be used to drive and inform each educator’s approach to teaching and interacting with their students. Here are a few of ways that you and your students can benefit when you bring learning theories into your classroom or curriculum:\n\nTheories of learning can provide clarity and direction by offering a set of principles or guidelines to build your teaching approach around.\n\nThe more theories of learning you’re familiar with, the more strategies you’ll have to connect with a diverse range of students who come from different backgrounds, learn at different paces, and face different academic challenges or obstacles.\n\nLearning theories facilitate clear communication between teachers and students (including nonverbal communication like body language, as we saw in the section on Behaviorism), along with parents, families, and school administrators.\n\nAs learning outcomes improve, students will also build confidence and self-esteem.\n\nConsidering their value and significance, how are learning theories actually used by educators in the real world? Keep reading for tips on how to apply learning theories in the classroom.\n\nHow to Implement Learning Theories in the Classroom\n\nNow that you’re more familiar with some core theories of learning, such as Humanism, you’re probably starting to think about how educators — including yourself — might put them to work in the classroom. So how can learning theories be applied to help teachers do their jobs more effectively so that students can achieve better outcomes? Here are 10 ways educators can implement various theories of learning more successfully.\n\nWays to Apply Behaviorism\n\nProvide positive reinforcement, like rewards and recognition, to students who show outstanding improvement, effort, or performance.\n\nRepeatedly use body language and nonverbal or physical cues to reinforce and manage behavior — for instance, one educator suggests folding your arms and moving to a specific area of your classroom when your students are becoming disruptive to the learning environment.\n\nWays to Apply Cognitivism\n\nEngage your students in group or class discussions.\n\nEncourage your students to identify links between concepts or events.\n\nWays to Apply Humanism\n\nIdentify ways to provide your students with more control over the direction and pace of their learning.\n\nProvide ample support, encouragement, and motivation to your students to help them build confidence and connect with the material.\n\nWays to Apply Connectivism\n\nBring more educational technology into the classroom.\n\nTeach students how and where to find quality information and conduct solid research — a critical skill that will aid them with tasks like writing and studying throughout their whole academic careers.\n\nStudy Learning Theories at National University\n\nIf you plan on pursuing a career in education, it’s essential to have a solid understanding of fundamental theories in learning, like Behaviorism, Constructivism, and Humanism.
