He has appeared in a number of high-profile motion pictures, including Pretty Woman, A Mighty Wind, L.A. Story, Runaway Bride, The Princess Diaries, and many more. He also frequently acts in episodic television series, including Eight Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter, Dream On, Mad about You, Boston Legal, and Law & Order. A respected voice actor, he has applied his vocal talents to animated features and television shows. Miller began his career as a musician, receiving classical training at Amherst College and then playing piano and drums in New York clubs. On a whim, he decided to try telling jokes on stage, and discovered a rewarding new career in comedy and acting.\n\nAs an observer and commentator, Miller has appeared on numerous television programs centering on cultural and political criticism, including Real Time with Bill Maher and Dennis Miller Live. Branching out into writing, Miller contributes to a number of periodicals and maintains a regular humor and criticism column in the Weekly Standard. In his first book, Spoiled Rotten America: Outrages of Everyday Life, Miller contemplates an assortment of subjects, from celebrity excess to political correctness, that he sees as symptoms of the decline of America. Though his material is generously couched in humor, Miller is \"obviously not afraid of getting serious, whether in his political material or in one poignantly personal and saddening anecdote about racism,\" observed a Kirkus Reviews critic. Miller's book, the reviewer continued, is above par \"fare from a comic-turned-author.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nKirkus Reviews, August 15, 2006, review of Spoiled Rotten America: Outrages of Everyday Life, p. 827.\n\nONLINE\n\nInternet Movie Database,http://www.imdb.com/ (March 4, 2007), filmography for Larry Miller.\n\nLarry Miller Home Page,http://www.larrymillerhumor.com (March 4, 2007).\n\nLarry Miller MySpace Profile,http://www.myspace.com/larrymillerhumor (March 4, 2007).\n\nShecky Magazine,http://www.sheckymagazine.com/ (October 2, 2006), review of Spoiled Rotten America."
