        "text": "Kirt T. Larson of Grace, Idaho, passed away peacefully surrounded by his family in his home on Saturday, April 27, 2024, at the age of 70. He is finally out of pain from an illness he fought courageously for several years.\n\nKirt was born on October 15, 1953 to Glen T. and Bernice Thompson Larson. He was raised in Preston, Idaho, on a small farm with one older sister and two older brothers. He graduated from Preston High School. He married his high school sweetheart LaRee Roberts, and some years later, solemnized their marriage in the Idaho Falls Temple.\n\nKirt faithfully served in the Air Force and later served in the Air Force reserves at Hill Field Air Force Base working on the last F105â€™s in the inventory. Kirt loved his country and loved his time he served in the military. Serving in the reserves opened the door to support his passion of traveling. Besides his love for his family, he had a great love for travel and motorcycles.\n\nAfter deciding to leave the family farm, he found employment at the Grace Hydro Plant and moved his family to Grace where he made a home for his family and raised his four daughters there. He volunteered to be an EMT for Caribou County and later served as the President of the Caribou County EMS. He retired from Utah Power and Light as a Compliance Technician for all the company owned hydro plants in Idaho.\n\nKirt loved the outdoors. He loved to hunt and fish, and do anything that involved guns. Kirt found his creative side when he was in his wood shop. He was so good with his hands and made many creations for his family. He was so smart and could learn anything he put his energy into. He loved adventure and learning new skills.\n\nHe is survived by his wife LaRee and by his children Amy (Mark) Beckstead of Preston, Idaho, Andrea (Jon) Andersen of Preston, Idaho, Amber (Phil) McEwen of Soda Springs, Idaho, Aubree (Jeff) Gittins of Kaysville, Utah. 15 grandchildren and 5 great grandchildren, his Sister DeAnn Acor, and Brothers, Bruce Larson, and Craig Larson.\n\nHe is preceded in death by his daughter, Jenny, his parents and two grandchildren, Gunner and Ruger Bates and a dear friend, Barry Berglind.\n\nHe will be missed so much, but we know that he has a great mission on the other side. He touched so many through his life and loved to serve his Heavenly Father. The family would like to thank the nurses, doctors, and those that touched our family through this time."
