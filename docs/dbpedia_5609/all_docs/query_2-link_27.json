Well, you will now. You were born on a Thursday.\n\n1000 days old\n\nMost kids no longer need to wear diapers by the time they are 1000 days old. At that age, most girls and boys can also walk. You are definitely not a toddler anymore at this point. Your 1000 day birthday is on July 11, 1956.\n\n3000 days old\n\nYour 3000 day birthday comes a couple of months after your 8th birthday and is a cool day to celebrate. Most kids are in 2nd or 3rd grade on the date of their 3000 day birthday. Your 3000 day birthday is on January 1, 1962.\n\nTween\n\nWe hear the word tween a lot these days. It is the time before you are a teenager, but after you are done playing with the silly kids toys! Your official tween time starts at age 10 and ends when you become a teenager. The date of your first day as a tween is on October 15, 1963.\n\nTeenager\n\nYou're a teenager! You are no longer a child. This is a when a lot of changes happen emotionally, physically, with how people treat you, and with your level of personal responsibilities. You become a teenager on October 15, 1966.\n\n5000 days old\n\nYour 5000 day old birthday is a few months before your big 14th birthday. This day is a good day to have a party if you can't wait for your 14th birthday party. Your 5000 day birthday is on June 24, 1967.\n\nSweet 16\n\nThis is a big day for people born on October 15, 1953. You can get your Driver's License and this is also the day you are allowed to get a job so you can pay for gas. You are 16 years old on October 15, 1969.\n\n18 Years old\n\nMany consider you an adult at age 18. You can do stuff like vote or serve your country. But don't bring out the champagne yet - you have to wait another three years to drink alcohol. You are 18 years old on October 15, 1971.\n\n21 Years old\n\nOK. Now you can bring out the champagne! You are probably almost done with college, considering moving out of your parents' nest for good, and getting a real job. Welcome to reality! You are 21 years old on October 15, 1974.\n\n10,000 days old\n\nYou are 27+ years old at this time. Do you still party? If so, this may be a good excuse to do so. Your 10,000 day birthday is on March 2, 1981.\n\n30 Years old\n\nMany feel this is the birthday when they transition from young to old. Are you married yet? Do you have children? Your biological clock is ticking fast now. You are 30 years old on October 15, 1983.\n\n40 Years old\n\nOK. At this point you're officially not young any more. You probably have lots of responsibilities with kids and a job and a house. Some people have a hard time with this birthday and are depressed, because they see this as the half-point of their life. You are 40 years old on October 15, 1993.\n\nThe BIG 50\n\nYou have lived half a century! You have seen it all and done it all, yet you feel happy, because the kids have moved out, you are working less and playing more, and you are looking forward to retirement. You are 50 years old on October 15, 2003.\n\nRetirement\n\nThe Social Security Administration changes the age when you can get retirement benefits now and then, but as a general rule, you can start receiving partial benefits at age 62 and max benefits at 67 years old. You are 62 years old on October 15, 2015 and 67 years old on October 15, 2020.\n\n25,000 days old\n\nYeah, yeah, we here at Research Maniacs are obsessed with \"number of days birthdays\".
