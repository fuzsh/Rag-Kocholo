        "text": "Larry L. King is a novelist, journalist, and playwright. He is the only writer nominated for a unique \"Triple Crown\" of American letters: a National Book Award, a Broadway Tony, and a television Emmy. In 2004 King received the Texas Bookend Award for Lifetime Achievement. He began donating his archives to the Southwestern Writers Collection/Wittliff Collections in 1987.\n\nResearch Topics: African American studies, Civil Rights, Correspondence Treasures, Drama, Football, Humor, Lyndon B. Johnson Studies, Kennedy Assassination, Magazine Journalism, Larry McMurtry Studies, Memoirs, \"New Journalism\", Politics, Ann Richards Studies, \"The Sixties\", Texas Monthly\n\nKing's archives were originally processed in 1993, resulting in the \"finding aid\" posted here. Since that time King has continued to send additional archives to the Wittliff Collections. A separate archival inventory of those gifts is posted below the original finding aid. Please note that access to unprocessed materials is granted on a case-by-case basis by the archivist. Please contact the archivist for details.\n\nBiography of Larry L. King\n\nJournalist, novelist, and playwright Larry L. King is the only writer to be a finalist for a unique “Triple Crown” of American letters: a National Book Award, a Broadway Tony, and a television Emmy. The author of fourteen books and seven stage plays, King is the co-author of the smash Broadway musical The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas. He was also a star writer at Harper’s at the peak of “The New Journalism” during the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThroughout his long and illustrious career King has been known for his humor, intelligence, and courage. A college dropout from Texas Tech, he was once described by Harper’s editor Willie Morris as a brawler from the West Texas oil patch with \"a deep and abiding commitment to America and to authentic American values.\"\n\nKing became a National Book Award finalist in 1972 for Confessions of a White Racist, his soul-baring account that revealed the depths of white attitudes towards African Americans. As a consequence of that book, he received death threats from many whites, as well as praise from other writers such as Maya Angelou, who wrote to tell him, “I had no idea of your startling courage. I applaud you, man. And pray you stay alive.\"\n\nKing’s literary legacy includes a voluminous collection of his literary papers, housed at the Southwestern Writers Collection at Texas State University in San Marcos. King saved nearly everything over the years and, as a prolific correspondent, he kept carbon copies of the letters he'd typed, as well as all those he'd received. King’s literary papers contain an estimated 40,000 letters, ranging from personal exchanges with senators and congressmen to his relationships with family, friends, and other writers such as David Halberstam, Norman Mailer, and Willie Morris. A collection of King’s letters, A Writer’s Life, or, Reflections in a Bloodshot Eye, was published in 1999.\n\nAmong King’s many awards are an Emmy for his 1982 television documentary for CBS, “The Best Little Statehouse in Texas.” His play The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas was a Tony finalist for Best Play. He received the Helen Hayes Award for best new play in 1989 for The Night Hank Williams Died. That play also earned him the Mary Goldwater Award from the Theatre Lobby Trust.\n\nKing’s work has also been recognized and praised in his native state of Texas. He received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Texas Book Festival in 2004. The Austin Playhouse named the Larry L. King Theatre in his honor in 2006. King has received multiple awards from the Texas Institute of Letters for his writing, including a Stanley Walker Journalism Award for his 1999 article on Willie Morris in Texas Monthly. That article formed the basis for King’s acclaimed 2006 book, In Search of Willie Morris.\n\nLawrence Leo King, the youngest child of Clyde Clayton and Cora Lee Clark King, was born January 1, 1929 in Putnam, Texas. He fixed on a career as a writer early in his childhood, inspired by the Mark Twain his mother read to him.\n\nAs early as grade school, King pursued publication of his works. He wrote regularly for the student newspaper at high school where he found a mentor in Aubra Nooncaster, football coach, English teacher and poet. From high school, King joined the army where he was a reporter for his base paper. He wrote professionally as a sports and crime reporter for the Hobbs (N. M.) Daily Flare, the Midland Reporter-Telegram and the Odessa American after a brief stint at Texas Technological College (now Texas Tech University) as a journalism major.\n\nIn 1954, King moved to Washington, D.C. as the Administrative Assistant to Representative J. T. Rutherford. After Rutherford was defeated in 1962, King joined the staff of another Texas congressman, future House Speaker Jim Wright. In 1964, struggling to complete a contracted novel, King quit Capitol Hill to become a free-lance writer.\n\nHis first novel, The One-Eyed Man, was published in 1966, but King’s chief livelihood as a writer during this time came from his magazine articles. From 1964, King wrote for The Texas Observer, an iconoclastic liberal magazine “then the only voice of dissent (constant) or reason (occasionally) to be found in my native state” At the same time, Mississippian Willie Morris, a University of Texas graduate and former editor of the Observer, encouraged King’s writing ambitions.\n\nWillie Morris gave King his first national exposure in Harper’s, where Morris was an editor. In 1967, Morris was named editor-in-chief of Harper’s and under his aegis, the magazine became famed for its exciting and innovative writing.\n\nMorris published the brightest literary lights of the day as represented by an impressive list King catalogues in his book The Old Man and Lesser Mortals: “James Dickey, Jules Feiffer, Robert Penn Warren, Justin Kaplan, Sara Davidson, Jack Richardson, Elizabeth Hardwick, Norman Podhoretz, Arthur Miller, Tony Lucas, George Plimpton, Bud Shrake, Michael Arlen, Joe McGinnis, Alfred Kazin, John Updike, Ralph Ellison, Jeremy Larner, Ward Just, Truman Capote, Herbert Gold, Tom Wicker, Gay Talese, Larry McMurtry, Joan Didion, Philip Roth, John Fowles, Irving Howe . . .” Not to be left out are William Styron, Norman Mailer, Bill Moyers and David Halberstam.\n\nKing’s best magazine work, as witnessed by the dominance of Harper’s pieces in King’s published collections, was done under Morris’s editing. Examples of this work are “Requiem for a West Texas Town”, “My Hero LBJ”, “The Old Man”, and “The Whole World’s Turned On.”\n\nKing went on to write for numerous, well-known publications including Life, Holiday, Cosmopolitan, The Progressive, Playboy Sports Illustrated. He served as a contributing editor at New Times, Audience, Parade, The Texas Observer, and Texas Monthly.\n\nKing’s topics often involved Texas: “Requiem for a West Texas Town,” “The Old Man,” “The Lost Frontier,” “Playing Cowboy” as well as politics: “My Hero LBJ,” “God, Man and William F. Buckley,” “The Trial of John Connally.” King also treated other subjects such as sports, travel, and music.\n\nIn 1978, King penned the book for the hit Broadway musical The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, based on an article he wrote for Playboy. The success of Whorehouse allowed King to get off what he had come to feel was the magazine treadmill and develop his talent in a different form. He has subsequently written six more plays, several of which have earned glowing reviews and popular success. His post-Whorehouse work includes The Kingfish (co-written with Ben Z. Grant), The Night Hank Williams Died, Christmas 1933/That Terrible Night Santa Got Lost in the Woods, The Golden Shadows Old West Museum, The Best Little Whorehouse Goes Public, and The Dead Presidents' Club.\n\nKing’s journalistic talent brought him to Harvard University in the 1969-1970 academic year as a Nieman Fellow. He chronicled this experience in the October 1970 issue of Harper’s, “Blowing My Mind at Harvard”. From Fall 1973 through Fall 1974, King taught as a Ferris Professor of Journalism and Political Science at Princeton University. He was a Duke Fellow of Communications from 1975 to 1976.\n\nKing has lived the majority of his life away from his home state but he continually returns there in his writing. In his own words, “That time and place of my youth—which, I had been thoroughly convinced contained no story material, has merely provided me with the stuff of a career.”\n\nBy chronicling the Texas that formed him, a Texas that is passing if not past, King, who believes “understanding of the past is vital to the lessons of the present” has come to see himself as a leaver of “literary signposts. Those signposts say, simply . . . this is how it was, in my time and my place, when I passed this way . . . . Pass it on!”\n\nKing married Wilma Jeanne Casey in 1950. They had three children, Alexandria, Kerri Lee King Grandey, and Bradley Clayton. King, divorced in 1964, married on February 20, 1965 Rosemarie Coumaris Kline, who died of cancer June 8, 1972. Since May 6, 1978, King has been married to Barbara S. Blaine, who is also his lawyer and agent. They are the parents of two children, Lindsay Allison and Blaine Carlton.\n\nWorks by Larry L.

It was first produced in showcase production at Actor’s Studio, New York City, October 27-November 12, 1977. It then opened off-Broadway at Intermedia Theatre in April 1978, and moved to Broadway’s 46th Street Theatre, on June 19, 1978, where its success supported 1,584 performances over the next four and half years and garnered King a Tony award nomination.\n\nThe files in this series include scripts, sheet music, screenplay drafts, a playbook, playbills, posters, flyers, reviews, clippings, photographs, tickets, T-shirts, a jacket, promotional buttons, congratulations and a 1981 cartoon by Patrick Oliphant drawn on a napkin.\n\nThe Kingfish, a one-man play about the flamboyant Louisiana Governor Huey P.

The series contains tear sheets, and in some cases, whole copies of the magazine in which the article appeared.
