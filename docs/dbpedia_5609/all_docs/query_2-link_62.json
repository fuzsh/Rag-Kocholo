        "meta_description": "John Lyons Patton died peacefully in his sleep on January 6th, 2024 at the age of 70 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. John's passing was unexpected much like his sense of humor and the stories he enjoyed sharing with his family and friends. John was born in Schenectady, New York on October 15th, 1953 to loving parents, the third of four children. Growing up he enjoyed reading books and swimming. Throughout his childhood, his family moved to several cities and John ultimately settled in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He attended Pennsylvania State University for college where he studied psychology. He put this degree to good use by working for many years at Mayview State Hospital, caring for patients with a variety of mental health conditions and also serving as the union's president.  John met his wife Diana while working at Mayview State Hospital and became a stepfather to her daughters. The couple went on to have two sons together. Though the relationship ended after eleven years, John and Diana remained close friends and a source of support for one another through the years.  John found his greatest joy in helping others. He overcame addiction in his late 40s and through these struggles developed a passion for supporting others with similar challenges such as through volunteer work. He knew no stranger and made everyone feel welcome with a quirky joke and a warm smile. He enjoyed sharing whatever he had with his family and friends and preferred to go without so that others had what they needed. John had a silly nature and enjoyed dressing in costumes (aliases included a pirate, a lobster, a leprechaun, and his signature \"glad hatter\") and dancing to house music. He also appreciated knowledge and audited several courses at the University of Pittsburgh as an adult and frequented the hospital's Grand Rounds.  John is preceded in death by his parents Leon and Johnne Patton. He will be dearly missed by his children Johnny (Susie) and Michael Patton, Brigette (Brian) Marsh, Robin (Matt Solarczyk) DalCero, and Nicole Cullen; former wife and friend Diana Fodor; grandchildren Violet and Louis Patton, AJ Brunick, Zoe Marsh, and Sonny and Rex Solarczyk; siblings Lucy (Dan) Patton Sondles, Christine Patton Klassen, and Jeff (Carol) Patton; along with many other family members and friends.  Friends will be received at the John F. Slater Funeral Home, Inc. , 412-881-4100, 4201 Brownsville Road. Brentwood 15227, Friday, January 12, 2024, 6:00-8:00 p. m. and Saturday 10:00 a. m. until time of service at noon. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions can be made to: UPMC Children's Hospital Foundation of Pittsburgh, donate. givetochildrens. org, 412-692-3900.",
