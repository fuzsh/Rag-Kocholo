        "text": "Producer, theater owner, actress and benefactor, Lucille Lortel, was born Lucille Wadler in New York City on December 16, 1900. A graduate of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, she had her first notable role in the Theatre Guild's production of George Bernard Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra, starring Helen Hayes in 1925. Shortly after marrying the wealthy industrialist Louis Schweitzer in 1931, she retired from performing.\n\nIn 1947, on the grounds of her home in Westport, Connecticut, she began the White Barn Theatre, a summer theater which continues to the present day. Here she introduced experimental, less-commercial works, including the American premieres of plays by writers such as Sean O'Casey, Edward Albee, Jean Genet, Eugene Ionesco, Samuel Beckett, Yukio Mishima, and Paul Zindel.\n\nHer first Off-Broadway production was A Sleep of Prisoners by Christopher Fry at the St. James' Episcopal Church in New York City in 1951. In 1955, Miss Lortel's husband purchased the Theatre de Lys in Greenwich Village for her, where her revival of The Threepenny Opera by Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht ran for almost 7 years. It was also at her Theatre de Lys, which was renamed the Lucille Lortel Theatre in 1981, that she initiated the ANTA (American National Theatre and Academy) Matinee Series in 1956. For 20 seasons, she presented works selected on the basis of innovation and originality. In 1998, Miss Lortel created the Playwrights' Sidewalk, a walk of fame for playwrights, outside the Lucille Lortel Theatre.\n\nIn a career spanning more than 50 years, Lucille Lortel produced more than 500 shows on Broadway, Off-Broadway, at the Library of Congress, at her White Barn Theatre and at other venues. Among the highlights of her productions are the Off-Broadway premiere of Athol Fugard's The Blood Knot, Sean O'Casey's Cock-a-Doodle Dandy, I Knock at the Door and Pictures in the Hallway, Jean Genet's The Balcony, Lee Blessing's A Walk in the Woods, Mbongeni Ngema's Woza Albert! and Sarafina!, Win Wells' Gertrude Stein and a Companion, Jane Anderson's The Baby Dance, and Larry Kramer's The Destiny of Me. A Walk in the Woods by Lee Blessing was her last Broadway production. Because of her belief in the play, Miss Lortel also produced it at the Library of Congress, co-produced it in London and took it to Moscow in 1989.\n\nShe received numerous awards, including 5 Tony nominations, an Emmy award, honorary doctorates from the University of Bridgeport, Fairfield University, and the CUNY (City University of New York) Graduate School, where the Lucille Lortel Distinguished Professorial Chair in Theatre was the first theatrical chair named for a woman. In 1986, the League of Off-Broadway Theatres and Producers established the annual Lucille Lortel Awards for Outstanding Achievement Off-Broadway.\n\nHer donations to many institutions and organizations included the Lucille Lortel Fund for New Drama at Yale University; the first play to be sponsored by this fund was August Wilson's Fences, which later won the Pulitzer Prize. Miss Lortel also endowed a playwriting fellowship in her name at Brown University. The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts' TOFT (Theatre on Film and Tape) room is also named for her.\n\nLucille Lortel died at the age of 98 after a brief illness on April 4, 1999.

The papers include correspondence, production files, scripts, programs, production photographs, personal and family photographs, organization files, clippings, ephemera and scrapbooks. Miss Lortel's life spanned the century and her papers encompass many aspects of her personal history, as well as the history of Off-Broadway and of her regional theater in Connecticut. Miss Lortel is credited with creating the Off-Broadway movement and providing a forum for avant-garde and experimental works at her Theatre de Lys. Both the ANTA Matinee Series at the Theatre de Lys and her White Barn Theatre brought works by Genet, O'Casey and Fugard to a wider audience. Many of these productions are represented in the collection by correspondence, programs, photographs and clippings. Over the years Miss Lortel also worked closely with several non-profit theaters as a donor and mentor. Her affiliations with the Circle in the Square, Circle Repertory Company, Goodspeed Opera House, Yale Repertory Theatre, and other theater companies are documented in the organization files.\n\nThe collection also contains information about Miss Lortel's husband, Louis Schweitzer, her mother, Anna Mayo Wadler, her brothers, Seymour Wadler and Waldo Mayo, and her sister Ruth Wadler Cugat. Louis Schweitzer's papers include some correspondence (mostly with Miss Lortel), clippings and a few documents relating to his work with the Vera Institute of Justice. Waldo Mayo's files contain programs, clippings and writings which detail his early career as a violinist in the United States and Europe. Ruth Wadler Cugat and her husband, Francis Coradal-Cugat were artists, and some examples of their work can be found in the collection.\n\nThe Lucille Lortel papers are arranged in eleven series:\n\n6.5 linear feet (16 boxes 9 folders)\n\nThis series contains letters from Miss Lortel's business associates and friends, about both personal and business matters.\n\n8.4 linear feet.

While the affiliated productions are arranged alphabetically, the others are arranged chronologically.\n\nIncluded are Affiliated productions with which she was involved as the owner of the Theatre de Lys, the ANTA Matinee Series, which were innovative works performed at the Theatre de Lys on days when the Theatre was dark, and over 20 Off-Broadway productions, from Miss Lortel's first Off-Broadway venture, Christopher Fry's A Sleep of Prisoners at St. James' Episcopal Church in 1951, through Mondays at the Lortel in 1997.

It was also at Yale that Miss Lortel first saw Lee Blessing's A Walk in the Woods, which she took to Broadway, London and Moscow during 1988-1989. Lloyd Richards, Dean of the Yale School of Drama, and Artistic Director of the Yale Repertory Theatre was a frequent correspondent.

The files (1983-1989) contain letters from recipients telling Miss Lortel about themselves and their studies. At Columbia University she also funded the Meyer Berger Award, a journalism award initiated by her husband Louis Schweitzer. Some of the Connecticut organizations included the Westport Historical Society, the Westport Public Library and the Connecticut Commission on the Arts.
