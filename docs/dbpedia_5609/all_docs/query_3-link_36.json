Mr. and Mrs. Dewey Moore and sons spent Monday evening with Mr. and Mrs. Harold Kellogg and family. Every Day Bargain Most everyone follows the American custom of looking in the newspapers to see what is on sale. That is quite natural because no one cares to pay more than necessary for what they purchase. One bargain, available every day in the year, is railroad transportation. For example, Burlington charges an average of only one and three-tenths cents to haul a ton of freight one mile. What's more, it moves over our own steel highway, pro vided and maintained at Burlington expense to give you safe, low-cost, dependable transportation. You save money by taking advantage of this every day bargain. Whatever you have to ship, let Burlington handle it. H. G.

ROUGH HANDLING OF LIVESTOCK EXPENSIVE Livestock losses in 1951 due to careless handling, diseases and insects amounted to $800 mil lion. If all farms suffered the same amount of this loss, it would amount to $160.00 per farm. Each day the amount of meat lost would be enough to supply all the meat needs for al most two cities the size of Om aha. These facts were presented to 4-H club members and lead ers attending the 9th annual Livestock Conservation Day Jheld in Omaha March 19. 4-H club members with livestock proects spent a lot of energy each year in an effort to reduce these losses. In these day of increased production costs, no one can afford to overlook any method that can help reduce unneces sary costs.
