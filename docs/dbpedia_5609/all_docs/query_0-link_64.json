        "text": "BIRTHDAY GUY: Actor Larry Miller was born in Valley Stream, Long Island, N.Y., today in 1953. This birthday guy is probably best known for playing the role of Walter Stratford, both in the 1999 movie “10 Things I Hate About You” and the short-lived 2010 TV series of the same name. He’s also played recurring roles on “Boston Legal,” “8 Simple Rules” and “Mad About You.” He’s guest-starred on episodes of “NCIS,” “Shake it Up” and “Curb Your Enthusiasm.”\n\nARIES (March 21-April 19): You may be in your element where the deer and the antelope roam. Mixing with people from different backgrounds can give you a refreshing sense of freedom. Friendliness can be mistaken for romance.\n\nTAURUS (April 20-May 20): You can whistle while you work rather than whittling away the day on time-wasting activities. Your need for social interaction might be satisfied by being part of a group engaged in a new project.\n\nGEMINI (May 21-June 20): You might be tempted to make up the rules when faced by new concepts, people and situations. If you can’t find common ground by appealing to logic, seek support by emphasizing popular views.\n\nCANCER (June 21-July 22): Chess is a thinking person’s game. Four-leaf clovers might grow in your garden, but they don’t produce strategic luck. You need to be rational and appreciative when nice people beat a path to your door.\n\nLEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Remain levelheaded. Unexpected reactions or unforeseen changes in your professional life or relationships are possible. Use poise to handle emerging situations and be prepared to try something new and daring.\n\nVIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Simplify rather than sensitize. Something you hear might hit too close to home and ruffle your feelings. Take a time out for crossword puzzles instead of trading cross words with a lover or partner.\n\nLIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): You need more than one for fun. Your sign is known for being happiest when paired with a congenial other. Today you might be poised to spread your wings and search for more exciting companions.\n\nSCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Don’t let a temporary breakdown in communications bar your way. A misunderstanding with a romantic partner could upset plans. Give your partner room to roam before returning to the roost.\n\nSAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Off with the old and on with the new. Impulsive mood swings result in a tendency to jump from the frying pan into the fire. Your actions are subject to misinterpretation, so consider appearances carefully.\n\nCAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): The serenity prayer makes the point that you must be wise enough to know the difference between the things you can change and those you can’t. Focus on making your ambitions come true.\n\nAQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Togetherness doesn’t require chains. Friends, by definition, may come and go. Sometimes a circle of friends shifts for the better. Adhere to your principles even if you’re challenged to bend them.\n\nPISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): The carrot held in front of your nose may be unattainable. Make agreements, but don’t gamble cash. Have faith in your talents, as well as your friends, and your best interests will be protected in the end.\n\nIF OCTOBER 15 IS YOUR BIRTHDAY: Friendships and business success can be especially important to you during the upcoming six to eight weeks. You might put the two together and join a club or business organization to further your ambitions by networking among your peers. Wait until December to make major financial changes or decisions, as that’s when your financial expertise is at a peak. Your next best chance to make a sound career move or a key financial change is April, but a romantic idea or wild goose chase could spoil your concentration."
