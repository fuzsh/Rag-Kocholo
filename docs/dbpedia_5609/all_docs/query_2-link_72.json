        "text": "Looking back, it was probably not a good idea to put a bachelor in charge of General Electric's 75th anniversary employee promotion.\n\nThe story goes that William D. Haylon, of Pittsfield, Massachusetts, a public relations executive for the consumer electronics giant, was given the task of finding a way to incorporate GE's employees into the company's celebration of its 75th birthday on Oct. 15, 1953.\n\nAt the beginning of 1953, he thought he had hit on a winning, low-risk, idea.\n\nAny baby born to an employee, or employee's spouse, on the company's birthday would earn five shares of stock, valued at about $78 a share at the time.\n\nThe media called the idea the \"GE Baby Derby.\"\n\nHaylon studied U.S. Census records and birth patterns of the past decade. After crunching the numbers, he expected about a dozen or so births to occur on any single day to the company's 226,000 American employees.\n\nHaylon and General Electric must have been surprised when the company had 189 new stockholders by the end of the day.\n\nMaybe he did not factor in the post-World War II baby boom or possibly the company made a mistake in announcing their plan almost exactly nine months before its anniversary.\n\n(A GE statistician later confessed that using general population figures was a mistake; company employees tended to be younger and were more likely to be having children.)\n\n\"The stork was winning in a landslide today over the General Electric Company,\" the Associated Press reported.\n\nIn Syracuse, where the company had a facility at Electronics Park, eight babies, were born, almost equaling the company's nationwide projection.\n\n\"Each baby came into life a capitalist worth $394.48,\" the Herald-Journal reported.\n\nThe births began early in the day.\n\nThe first new stockholder in Syracuse came at 1:40 a.m., a daughter, born to Mr. and Mrs. Alfonso Letizia, of North Syracuse.\n\nShe was followed by seven more. The first six children born were photographed for the front page of the Post-Standard.\n\nAs the day progressed, local hospitals were besieged by telephone calls from local media.\n\n\"Hospital delivery floors answered calls every five minutes as radio and newspaper deadlines neared, statisticians rechecked their figures in amazement, and the whole country chortled,\" the Herald-Journal said.\n\nNot laughing, however, were the expecting parents whose babies had not yet arrived as the midnight deadline loomed.\n\nHenry Poplaski, of Delmar Place, hung a gigantic sign at his workspace with \"NO!\" written on it, to stop coworkers from asking if his wife had delivered yet. The baby missed the deadline.\n\nAlso disappointed was Peter Bednick, of North Syracuse. The production engineer's wife was admitted to St. Mary's Hospital and he was told that a child was \"sure to be born before midnight.\" But, alas, the baby was not born in time.\n\nThe response was even greater in Schenectady, where the company's main plant was located.\n\nThirty babies were born in employees in 24 hours, including a son to Mrs. Edward Sheward, who was delivered one minute before midnight.\n\nAs midnight approached in the east, 122 GE babies had been born nationwide.\n\n\"And the West Coast hasn't been heard from yet,\" said a company spokesman, \"a bit desperately,\" the Associated Press noted.\n\nThe number eventually reached 189 and the company would be on the hook for over $74,000 worth of stock.\n\nTo its credit, the company said it would \"stand firmly by its offer,\" and discounted any rumors that some parents had resorted to Caesarian sections as a way to \"beat the gun.\"\n\n\"We never expected this many babies,\" a company spokesperson said, who also mentioned that at least four babies were given names with the initials \"G.E.\"."
