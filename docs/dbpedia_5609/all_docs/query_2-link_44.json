        "text": "Marshall Ray Witt 66 of Sutherland, went to be with The Lord, Thursday June 4, 2020. Marshall was born October 15, 1953 to the late Walter and Virginia Witt. He was also preceded in death by a brother John Timothy Witt. He is survived by his wife of 44 years Ann Patterson Witt; two children, Dr. Jeffrey Ray Witt and Megan Witt Krenicky (Brandon); two grandchildren, Emerson Blake Krenicky and Kinsley “Kiki” Brooke Krenicky; two sisters, Brenda Witt Sullivan (Michael) and Theresa Witt Baird (Mark); two brothers, Walter David Witt, Jr. (Linda) and Jerry Lynn Witt (Debbie); and numerous other loving family members. Marshall was a 1972 graduate of Dinwiddie High School where he played quarterback for the football team. He was a 1974 graduate of Ferrum College. Marshall worked for many years for his family business, Walter D. Witt Roofing until his retirement. He enjoyed coaching basketball for many years for the Dinwiddie Youth League. One of his biggest passions was UVA athletics. He was a season ticket holder for football and basketball for his entire life. Marshall would travel across the United States to support UVA. In 2019 he had the chance to witness, in person, UVA win the men’s basketball national championship in Minneapolis, MN. He also attended every UVA game during that tournament run in three different cities. Marshall also traveled to Miami to see UVA play in the 2019 Orange Bowl. He loved his grandchildren more than anything. He often attended their sporting events and dance recitals. His remains will rest from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Monday June 8, 2020 at the Colonial Heights Chapel of E. Alvin Small Funeral Home, 2033 Boulevard. A graveside service will be held 3:00 p.m. Monday June 8, 2020 at Southlawn Memorial Park, 1911 Birdsong Rd. The family would encourage, if possible, to wear UVA apparel or orange and blue. In lieu of flowers donations may be made to the Virginia Student Aid Foundation, http://virginiaathleticsfoundation.com/how-to-make-a-gift/ or the Dinwidde Fire and EMS.
