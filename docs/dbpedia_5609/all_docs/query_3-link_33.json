Smoking driftwood by the campfire while trying not to get caught always added to the adventure. These early years gave him great respect for nature.

He spent many years raising quail, pheasant, turkeys and other game animals for the Department of Natural Resources to be released into the wild.

He could always be found in his garage ready with a cold beer and some free advice.\n\nThe most cherished gift Jim would tell you he had was his daughter, Jamey. Jamey gave Jim his legacy. He was never prouder than while watching her become the beautiful, caring, giving, hard-working young woman that she has grown to become. Watching her graduate high school was one of the many achievements he got to see her accomplish that gave him great pride. Jim’s way was to counsel, not just to correct bad behavior, but to give meaningful life advice. He and Jamey spent many hours talking, exchanging opinions and poking fun at each other. He truly loved every moment spent with her.\n\nCremation rites will be accorded. A graveside service is scheduled for 1 p.m. on Aug. 8, 2024, at the Chillicothe City Cemetery.

He retired at age 60 and said he enjoyed snowy days, knowing he no longer had to get up early and “walk the tracks.”\n\n“Late-night Larry” was how he was known to friends at the VFW post, which was his favorite (and only) place to hang out. They knew to expect him a few times each week – precisely at 7:30 p.m. – and often staying until late in the evening, especially if beloved friends Gary and Lana were there. Though not a veteran himself, Larry always sported a VFW cap and loved all those who served in the military. He spent countless hours volunteering for “the V,” selling hams and tickets to steak dinners and fish frys, as well as passing out poppies to those who donated.\n\nLarry was an outstanding cook and usually brought requested favorites, scalloped potatoes and chicken and noodles, to all family gatherings. And no dinner was complete without one of his pies.\n\nHe also was an avid fan of the Chicago Cubs and Bears and a 47-year member of the Moose Lodge in Canton and Pekin.\n\nVisitation will be from 3-5 p.m. Friday, July 26, at Oaks-Hines Funeral Home in Canton, with services immediately after at 5 p.m. He will be buried later beside his parents at Elmwood Township Cemetery in Elmwood.\n\nMemorials may be made to VFW Post 1984 in Canton.\n\nCandy J.

Johnson\n\nHANNA CITY – Arlen V. Johnson, 78, of Hanna City, passed away at his home on July 11, 2024. The second son of Albert Johnson and Viola (Miller) Johnson, he was born on V-J Day (Victory in Japan), Aug. 14, 1945, the end of World War II, with middle name “Victor.”\n\nHe was a 1963 graduate of Farmington High School.\n\nDrafted, he served in Vietnam with the U.S. Army. Returning home, aware of a widening spectrum of cultures, he studied languages at Bradley University, graduating on the G.I. Bill.\n\nAt the Goethe Institute in Vienna, Austria, he invested 11 years helping foreign students develop their language skills and his own appreciation for German language and culture, while making yearly trips home to Illinois for spring planting. His association with the Peace Corps in Belize stretched to six years, teaching agriculture and working in community development.\n\nArlen returned to the family farm full time in rural Hanna City in 1993. He married Elvira Faulkner on Dec. 7, 2002. Both were active in the Christ Church-Limestone (Stone Church), where their faith life grew together.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, his brother Roger and his wife Elvira.

His accounts of family and the world spiced up many a discussion at different reunions.\n\nArlen’s memory was a storehouse of data ready to access. Beethoven and Mozart, “friends” of his in Vietnam and Vienna, became frequent chums in his house: for visitors or while alone as the music rattled the windows throughout the house.\n\nArlen was a steward of the land and its produce, a caretaker of animals. He was in continual “thought process,” making things happen. He took up baking after his mom died to provide family/friends with pies on birthdays or Christmas and at reunions. He’d glean roadside berry patches, picking/distributing fruit to neighbors and friends. Orphaned critters were cared for. He wrote ditties to sing in the field and recited poetry when the urge came.\n\nThe Lord in his grace has blessed you, Arlen! He blessed by gifting you to us as friend and brother. Fluent in five languages, your God-given gift of service, your “love language,” has been a treasured sentiment for many. And by your faith you have touched many. We have been blessed.\n\nThere will be a private memorial service for Arlen at Christ Church-Limestone. A public celebration of life will be at the German-American Central Society, 7601 N.

Early in his farming career during the offseason, he also worked as a carpenter, building houses for Colgan Brothers Construction.\n\nFrank was a lively teller of jokes, and, if he could overcome his own laughter before he got to the punchline, his jokes were always funny.\n\nHe loved watching Jeopardy! with Alice, making sure to write down the final questions to quiz the kids and grandkids when they came to visit. He avidly solved crossword puzzles – often with the help of his friend, Siri. Frank also had an exceptional memory, recalling farming details, people’s names and sports facts like no one else while his family had to refer to Google just to join the conversation.\n\nHe was well known in his family for his witty, pithy sayings, including one that would always come after hearing of the deals and savings from shopping excursions: “You’re going to go broke saving money!”\n\nOne of Frank’s proudest moments came when his first grandchild, Ryan, was born on his birthday. They shared many special days together over the 27 years, often savoring a bunny cake Alice would bake for them.\n\nThose surviving to cherish his memory include his doting wife of nearly 61 years, Alice; his devoted children, Kyle Waldinger (Danielle Svetcov) of Corte Madera, Calif., Corey (Laura) Waldinger of Naperville, Ill., Cynthia (Todd) Carlson of Amboy, Ill., and Teresa Waldinger (Tom O’Connor) of North Aurora, Ill.; his adoring grandchildren, Charlotte and Jo Waldinger (Corte Madera, Ryan Waldinger (Chicago), Alex Waldinger (Nashville, Tenn.), Sarah Waldinger (Chicago), Emma Waldinger (Naperville) and Avery and Beckett O’Connor (North Aurora); his beloved siblings, Ginny (Ted) Gilles, Henry (Paulette) Waldinger, Ruth (Don) Stahl, Clarence (Kathy) Waldinger and Tom Waldinger; his amazing Parkin “out-laws”; and 36 dear nieces and nephews.\n\nFrank was preceded in death by his parents; his sister, Liz Code; his brother, Willie Waldinger; four brothers-in-law, Phil Code, Bill Hinkle, Rodger Woodley and Jim Parkin; and two nephews, Travis Parkin and Billy Hinkle.\n\nA visitation will be from 4-7 p.m. with the recitation of the rosary at 7 p.m. on Tuesday, July 23, 2024, at Grant-Johnson Funeral Home in Bradford.

Bell\n\nGALVA – Duane O. Bell, 85, has no more cart to move around or office chair to miss, as he has for the past six months. He has taken his final load to the streets of gold in heaven, where he was greeted by his parents and son, Ron, on the morning of June 7, 2024, from the Knox County Nursing Home.\n\nHe was born in Galva (the house is gone now but was located behind the Ford garage) on Oct. 30, 1938, the son of C.S. and Marjorie Bell.\n\nGraduating from Galva High School in 1956, he married the love of his life, Suzanne Armstrong on Nov. 17, 1957.

Johnson, 89, of Denver, Colo., formerly of Wyoming, passed away at 11:14 p.m. Friday, May 17, 2024, at Highpoint Assisted Living in Denver.\n\nOne word that describes Pete is commitment.

Rosenberg\n\nCRYSTAL LAKE – Vicky Lynn Rosenberg (née Bloomberg) died June 6, 2024, at Advocate Christ Medical Center after years of valiantly fighting both heart failure and breast cancer. She was 76.\n\nShe is survived by her husband of 54 years, James Rosenberg; their two daughters, Amanda (Whit) Chaiyabhat and Katherine (Kirk) Douglas; her sister Tracy (Charlie) Jaco; six grandchildren; her niece Rachel Bloomberg; and nephews Donovan and Dustin Jaco.\n\nVicky was born in Kewanee on May 3, 1948, to parents Richard Bloomberg and Mildred Scott. Vicky was the first of three Bloomberg girls, big sister to Gail Bloomberg and Tracy Jaco. As a child, she lived a rural life in Toulon, Ill., some of it on a farm. She often lamented the hour-long bus rides to and from school and decided she wanted to raise her family in a larger town.\n\nShe got her wish after she began attending Illinois State University where she met Jim Rosenberg. The couple was married Nov. 22, 1969, and the following year Jim accepted a teaching position at Crystal Lake Central High School and the couple moved to the northwest Chicago suburb, where they made their home the remainder of her life. Later Vicky would finish her studies at Northern Illinois University, from which she graduated with a bachelor of science in education in 1971.\n\nShe gave birth to her first child, Mandi, at the age of 30, on Mother’s Day 1977. Three years later the family welcomed Kate.\n\nAn ever-dedicated mother, she chose her jobs and the location of their home specifically to maximize time together as a family. The girls could walk to all of their schools from K to 12 and they never came home to an empty house – in fact, most friends who visited the girls after school were met with delicious homemade baked goods. She loved to cook for her family to show her love, which she continued to do even throughout her illness. Not a single special occasion ever passed without a special meal, treat, or a thoughtful gift or card sent cross country.\n\nHer first professional job was working as a teller at Home State Bank but she also spent time working at Thunderbird Nursery School while her girls were enrolled and volunteered at Husmann Elementary School. She then worked as a librarian at the Fox River Grove Children’s Library, where she frequently took the girls on the weekends. She later worked as an assistant librarian at McHenry County College, which her daughters also attended, until she retired.\n\nAlthough she wasn’t a natural traveler, with Jim by her side she pushed herself out of her comfort zone so the pair could see the world together. They traveled everywhere from Spain’s Canary Islands to Budapest, Vienna, Berlin, Paris, Dublin, Prague and Krakow among countless other globe-trotting adventures. When her daughters were young the family also took multiple vacations each year, driving all across America (with the girls bickering in back).\n\nOnce they were grown, she also made frequent visits to see her children as they moved around the country to places including Washington D.C., Arizona, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, California, Texas and Florida. She witnessed the birth of all six of her grandchildren: Mackenzie Chaiyabhat (19), Carter Chaiyabhat (18), Kayleigh Chaiyabhat (15), Cameron Chaiyabhat (6) and twins Alexandria and Andrew Douglas (9).\n\nShe was preceded in death by her parents Dick and Millie Bloomberg and her sister Gail Bloomberg – the mention of whom as she was gravely ill made Vicky smile for the last time; she was at peace thinking of reuniting with her sister in heaven.\n\nFierce, pragmatic, logical and determined, Vicky was always athletic, strong and capable. She played basketball in high school and took jujitsu classes as a young wife. She handled home renovations including demolition and building a deck on her own. She wasn’t often openly emotional, which belied the fact she was the most loving and thoughtful person you’d ever encounter. Of the grief we all are feeling, she would offer the warmest of hugs, a kiss on the cheek and simply say, “This too shall pass.”\n\nVisitation will be held from 4-8 p.m. on Friday, June 14, 2024, at Querhammer and Flagg Funeral Home, 500 W Terra Cotta Ave, Crystal Lake, IL 60014.\n\nAgnes E.
