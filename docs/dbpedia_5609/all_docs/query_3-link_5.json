        "text": "History of National Larry Day\n\nThe name Laurence is traditionally used as a feminine name meaning ‘bright one.’ The masculine version is Laurent. It’s derived from the Latin word ‘Laurentius’ meaning ‘Man from Laurentum,’ referring to the ancient Roman city. It possibly originated from the Old Greek name Lavrenti as well. The Italian variations are Ilario or Ilaria. The English version of this name is Lawrence, the nicknames for which are Larry and Lawrie. However, it is also common to use Larry as a given name.\n\nWhile Larry was first considered a nickname, it began being used in the U.S. in 1880. The name was given to 13 newborns that year. It grew in popularity and reached its peak in the 1930s. In 1939, it became the number one name in Kansas. The most newborns given this name were in Texas in 1952. From 1880 to 2018, there have been 809,287 Larrys born.\n\nThis previously European has become very American and a staple in American T.V. The most notable ones are Larry Burns (or Mr. Burns as you might know him) from “The Simpsons.” Larry is the name usually reserved for a friendly neighbor or a parent. It invokes the image of an older man, usually cold and firm. For this reason, this name has greatly declined in popularity in the last decade."
