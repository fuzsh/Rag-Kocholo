I've got a tower.\n\nWe often confuse what we wish for with what is.\n\nNOOOO, I DON'T WANNA BE A WAITER!!!\n\nLook! An idiot!\n\nMy mum always said: \"It's a dog-eat-dog world, son. You get them before they get you. Eat your greens. Please don't do that. Stop embarrassing me in front of the neighbors. I think it would be best if you just leave home and never come back!\" She wasn't even really my mum. She bought me from a man...\n\nWe just have to try the key in every single lock we pass, and when we find the one the key opens, we'll know that 10,000 bloody years have passed!!\n\nWe'll do things that rich people do. We'll bathe in... fish. And eat our weight in chocolate buttons!\n\nI shall slip unnoticed throught the darkness, like a dark, unnoticed, slippy thing.\n\nOther\n\n[edit]\n\nMrs. Bagwell: I remember I said to him: 'Mr Bagwell, how can a mask know what you need?' And he said: 'Cynthia, remember I don't know what I'm talking about.'\n\nDialogue\n\n[edit]\n\nJoanne: All those kids in there want to run away and join the circus!\n\nHelena: Great, they can have MY life!

I'm sorry, but all in all, it is completely, utterly, unarguably, quintessentually hopeless.\n\n(The flower held by the sleeping Queen suddenly blooms)\n\nHelena: What does that mean?\n\nPrime Minister: It means... that it's maybe not quintessentually hopeless.\n\nSphinx: Hungry.\n\nValentine: Is this a riddle thing?\n\nSphinx: Hungry!\n\n(Helena gives it her cake; the sphinx just bats at it)\n\nSphinx: Still hungry.\n\n[The Gryphon has been unable to answer Helena's riddle: \"What's green, hangs on a wall and whistles?\"]\n\nHelena: It's a herring.\n\nGryphon: But a herring isn't green.\n\nHelena: You can paint it green.\n\nGryphon: But a herring doesn't hang on a wall.\n\nHelena: You can nail it to a wall.\n\nGryphon: [through clenched teeth] But a herring doesn't WHISTLE!!\n\nHelena: Oh come on, I just put that in to stop it from being too obvious.\n\nTaglines\n\n[edit]\n\nEnter A World Where Dreams Are Real.\n\nAn extraordinary dream quest to rescue a world out of balance.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nStephanie Leonidas - Helena Campbell / The Princess\n\nJason Barry - Valentine\n\nRob Brydon - Morris Campbell / the White Queen's majordomo\n\nGina McKee - Joanne Campbell / The Queen of Shadows / The Queen of Light\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nMirrorMask quotes at the Internet Movie Database\n\nMirrorMask at Rotten Tomatoes\n\nMirrorMask at Allmovie\n\nOfficial site"
