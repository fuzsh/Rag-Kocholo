        "text": "“Eye-scorching screen candy.”\n\nMirrormask is a personal favorite film of mine, and with good reason. It’s all of that eye candy that left me begging for more! The film was created by two immensely gifted artists and storytellers, Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean, both of whom worked on the epic Sandman graphic novels together. They have created a mind-blowing film in Mirrormask, one that takes you into a realm that can only be woven in a world of fantasy.\n\nSo today, we delve deeper into this mesmerizing fantasy film, charting a new film territory that could possibly be the quintessential 21st century version of Alice in Wonderland.\n\nMirrormask is about a fifteen-year-old girl going through life changing events. In order to deal with the reality of growing up and dealing with the mental strain of losing her mother, she escapes into a world of fantasy. One could say the girl is trapped in an alternative reality – this new reality being a metaphor for growing up and facing adult fears and tribulations. We’ve all escaped our “realities” at times…\n\nMirrormask was directed by Dave McKean (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban 2004). The story and teleplay was co-written by McKean and Neil Gaiman (American Gods TV series, Coraline 2009). It stars Stephanie Leonidas (American Gothic 2019), Jason Barry (Beyond Re-Animator 2003), and Rob Brydon (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels 1998).\n\nMirrormask is known for being the ultimate theatrical eye candy for art and film lovers alike. For those who know of McKean’s work, you’ll appreciate it in its lifelike form. The artwork is indeed incredible. The visual aspects evoked from Gaiman’s conceptual ideas are absolutely outlandish, dreamlike and spellbinding. The combination of CGI, animation, illustrations and cinematography involved in the creation of this film make for a tasty, mouthwatering dish.\n\nGaiman’s imagination and quirkiness are truly brought to life in this memorable dreamscape, treating the viewer to new findings upon reviewing. And I’ve watched Mirrormask dozens of times, and I notice something new in every viewing. My personal favorite out of the many strange and wondrous characters in the film is the Sphinx.\n\nI find this film rather fascinating, as it deals with issues of the self and the duality of the mind, so to speak. Who knows what our “mirror selves” or “mirror’d world” reveal. As they say, the grass is never greener on the other side. Or is it..? Now there’s a thought to ponder.\n\nLike any other movie, Mirrormask is not for everyone, but it is definitely a living creation in itself. The work of Gaiman is hypnotic and sets those dormant cells into action, waking the world of the unknown, flowing through the abyss of the mind. Combine that with the visuals of McKean, and you’ll have your imagination running wild… you’re surely in for a treat!\n\nThere are those who insist that this film is more of a work or style of art rather than a mere film, as it’s more visual than your typical bland movie, as there are so many hidden layers that need only be peeled away. With the influence of Neil Gaiman, you know that there are hidden meanings and psychological themes involved. His writing will undoubtedly leave you with food for thought, if not to question your own reality.\n\nIf you’re a fan of Neil Gaiman’s writing and storytelling, and you love the artwork by Dave McKean, Mirrormask is one not to be missed. It is an outstanding creation that will leave you breathless and glued to your seat, if only for the sheer, jaw dropping visuals and concepts. It truly is a beautiful piece of work with music that can only be described as a virtual symphony. All aspects of the film combine to create a gorgeous, phantasmagoric, whimsical, hypnotic delirium.\n\n*SOME TRIVIA FOR YOU*\n\nAccording to an interview with Neil Gaiman, the original computers used to do all of the CG were named after the Beatles (John, Paul, Ringo, George). Later, a fifth computer was required, so it was named Yoko. Soon after the fifth computer was introduced, the network crashed and could not be restored properly. “The computers refused to talk to each other.” A new server and computers were purchased and named after The Ramones (Joey, Jonny, DeeDee and Tommy). Gaiman said, “I wish I knew more about the history of The Ramones; the computers performed brilliantly, vibrantly and died an untimely – and early – death.”\n\nAccording to Neil Gaiman, Mirrormask was made as a straight-to-DVD film, but ended up getting a limited theatrical release in the United States.\n\nTotal number of digital fish in the film: 42. There were 70 masks within the film.\n\nWhen Helena reaches for the copy of “The Complete History of Everything” in the library, the book directly beside it is entitled “Muppets in Space,” using the font from Farscape (1999). Farscape is another Jim Henson Company production set in space. This joke is often mistaken for Muppets from Space, the 1999 film.\n\nJosefine Cronholm’s version of Burt Bacharach’s classic song, “Close to You,” which was played during the scene where Helena is dressed by mechanical handmaidens, was inspired by composer Wayne Horvitz’s 1997 cover version of the song featured in the tribute album, Great Jewish Music: Burt Bacharach, sung by Julie Wolf and Robin Holcomb. I personally loved this version."
