        "text": "MirrorMask\n\ntells the story of Helena (Stephanie Leonidas), a young girl who hates her life performing in her parents' circus. Although her mother (Gina McKee) tells her that every kid wants to run away and join the circus, Helena only wants to draw and live a normal life like normal kids. During one particularly apocalyptic argument with her mother, Helena says that she wishes her mother were dead so she could stop performing and live a regular life.\n\nOf course, during the very next performance, Helena's mother passes out and is rushed to the emergency room. While her father (Rob Brydon) worries and argues with his performers over keeping the circus alive, Helena agonizes over what she said to her mother and her inability to find a way to properly apologize.\n\nLaying in bed one night, she finds herself suddenly awoken and transported to a mysterious - yet familiar - world in which only she can awaken the white queen and bring balance to the world. Along the way, she meets the loquacious Valentine (the scene-stealing Jason Barry), malicious sphinxes, and a black queen who's convinced that Helena is actually her run-away daughter.\n\nStory-wise, MirrorMask isn't particularly innovative. It obviously borrows many motifs and themes from Alice in Wonderland, The Prince and the Pauper, Wizard of Oz, Labyrinth and various other fish-out-of-water stories. Gaiman's script is incredibly smart, funny, and very economical in painting fully-formed characters without much exposition. At the same time, the story and the path of the characters is extremely predictable. There are dozens of moments in the film in which the characters are surprised or stunned, but the viewers are already a step ahead.\n\nBut Gaiman's script is really just a vehicle for Dave McKean's artwork. If you're a fan of comics such as The Sandman or Arkham Asylum, you're probably already familiar with McKean's chaotic, collage style of artwork. It's an insane, creepy style that really fills out the fantasy world which Helena enters.\n\nIn fact, this is one of the few times I can say that CGI has made a movie. Although blue-screen sets were used to create stylized landscapes in Sin City and Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, MirrorMask is the first film to really use computer animation and blue-screen to create an impossible world. Gaiman and McKean's sepia-tone world - imagine a world created of doodles and trash and you're almost there - could not have been created with sets or miniatures or any other sort of physical special-effect. Only CGI would have worked, and it's something splendid here.\n\nFortunately, the filmmakers avoided the Star Wars-effect and got great performances from the actors to go along with the great visuals. Leonidas and Barry really carry the film and perfectly interact with their environment. Both play their roles extremely well - Barry's Valentine understands the strange world, Leonidas doesn't, but both are extraordinarily believable in their exchanges. In fact, it's in their interactions that Gaiman's writing really shines - it's in those moments when Valentine and Helena are speaking to each other without understanding what the other's talking about that the humor and emotion really come out.\n\nIn the end, MirrorMask is a hard movie to pass judgment on. But even though many casual viewers might find the movie a little too weird to digest, Gaiman and McKean fans are in for a field day, of course.\n\nScore: 7 out of 10\n\nVideo and Presentation\n\nMirrorMask has a very strange visual style - the majority of the film takes a sepia-tone quality in which light fades in and out of the picture. Therefore specific 'errors' in the visual quality of the world can be difficult to differentiate from poor transferring. For example, most of the bleeding colors are intentional - they were present in the theatrical print and add to the atmosphere of the movie. Many of the issues prevalent throughout the original DVD release are relatively absent in the Blu-ray transfer. The colors are much more vibrant and the artistic, painter-like quality of the film itself is vastly enhanced. The detail could be a bit better, but overall, this is a stunningly original and beautiful film.\n\nScore: 8 out of 10\n\nLanguages and Audio\n\nThe DTS-HD 5.1 audio on MirrorMask is surprisingly sharp. Little atmospheric sounds really explore the surround-sound space and the few sequences in which there's a lot happening in the scene really sound decent despite some unintentional background noise here and there. Viewers aren't likely to notice any major distinctions between this and the standard-def transfer, but the visual punch alone supports the weight of any flaws in the audio department.\n\nScore: 8 out of 10\n\nExtras and Packaging\n\nNeil Talks - Interview with Writer Neil Gaiman is a straightforward interview with the writer of the film. Gaiman is a great speaker and really does a great job exploring the background of his relationship with McKean and the origins of the movie.\n\nDave Talks About Film - Interview with Director Dave McKean is another interview, this time with the director/designer of the movie. McKean is an interesting character, and isn't as public as Gaiman is, so this interview is going to be a treat for fans. McKean discusses his background in short films and how that led to MirrorMask.\n\nBeginnings is a series of interviews with the producers of the film in which they explain how they got around to spending money on Gaiman and McKean's vision. This is the least interesting of any of the features considering that the producers just say the things that you might expect them to say: 'the movie's brilliant, everyone loves it, we were happy to work with everyone and never had any problems whatsoever.'\n\nCast & Crew Interviews are a bit more interesting because the cast and crew really explore their feelings on the movie. Many DVDs would just have the stars gushing about the movie, but here they really talk about the challenges that face them and what it was like to work on such a weird movie.\n\nDay 16 is a particularly fun feature - it's basically a fast-forward, single take of an entire day of blue-screen shooting. As we see the actors lining up, being shot, and eating lunch, we get a split-screen image of the scene being shot, as well as subtitles detailing various facts and trivia about the film. A really interesting and extremely fun featurette.\n\nGiants Development is a short making-of feature that gives some background on the design and creation of the \"giants orbiting\" scene. Although it's interesting, the brevity of the feature simplifies the process a bit too much.\n\nQuestions & Answers will definitely be a fan favorite. Consisting of various Q&A sessions with Gaiman and McKean at comic shows and movie screenings, the feature gives a lot of insight into the creative process involved in making such a weird film.\n\nFinally, the commentary featuring McKean and Gaiman is easily the best feature on the disc. Gaiman has a knack for being charming on tape, and he keeps McKean talking about the history and creation of the film. One of the things I was especially pleased with was where Gaiman and McKean point out specific work by the computer animators, naming names. It never takes over the commentary, but McKean obviously respected the animators he worked with and goes out of his way to distinguish the different artistic styles of his staff.\n\nMeanwhile, Gaiman keeps bringing up cut scenes, lines, and difficult aspects of screening a special-effects movie without the special effects. In fact, Gaiman spent so much time promoting the film that he actually never got to see a complete, final print - therefore his surprise and delight at minor changes in the movie really come across in this commentary when he sees them for the first time.\n\nThere are plenty of features here that will please diehard fans and casual viewers alike. Although the inclusion of DVD-ROM features such as Gaiman's script would have made this disc gold, what's here is still incredibly strong and should hopefully prevent Sony from double-dipping.\n\nScore: 8 out of 10"
