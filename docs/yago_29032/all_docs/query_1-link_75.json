        "text": "Neil will be talking about his new book, Anansi Boys, and his new movie, Mirrormask.\n\nAnansi Boys is Gaiman’s latest novel and the follow up to American Gods. Readers across America and around the world were first introduced to Mr. Nancy (“Anansi”), the spider god, in American Gods. Anansi Boys tells the story of his two sons, Fat Charlie and Spider.\n\nGaiman notes, “It’s a scary, funny sort of story, which isn’t exactly a thriller, and isn’t really horror, and doesn’t quite qualify as a ghost story (although it has at least one ghost in it), or a romantic comedy (although there are several romances in there, and it’s certainly a comedy, except the scary bits). If you have to classify it, it’s probably a magical-horror-thriller-ghost-romantic-comedy-family epic, although that leaves out the detective bits and much of the food.” (After all, there is a very interesting lime.)\n\nMirrormask is directed by famed illustrator/artist Dave McKean and written by Neil Gaiman. Produced by the Jim Henson Company, Mirrormask blends live action with digital animation. The film premiered at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival. Mirrormask opens on Friday, September 30, 2005.\n\nMirrormask tells the story of Helena, a fifteen-year-old girl working for her family circus, who wishes – quite ironically – that she could run away from the circus and join real life. But such is not to be the case, as she finds herself on a strange journey into the Dark Lands, a fantastic landscape filled with giants, monkeybirds and dangerous sphinxes. On her quest to return home, Helena searches for the Mirrormask, an object of enormous power, which is her only hope of escaping the Dark Lands.\n\nIn 1986, McKean met Gaiman and the pair collaborated on a short graphic novel of disturbing childhood memories, Violent Cases, which garnered instant critical acclaim. Since then, the pair has worked together on numerous award-winning comic books, graphic novels and children’s books.\n\n©2005 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved."
