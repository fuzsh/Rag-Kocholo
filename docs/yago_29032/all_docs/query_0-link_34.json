        "text": "I had a marvelous conversation with a grad student friend of mine last month about the relative merits of my job. While I argued that it was perfectly reasonable to discuss opinions on films, he countered that such talk would get me unceremoniously thrown out of UCLA Film School classes. There, he said, graduate directing students are taught – not to express whether or not they like a film – but to try to ascertain what they can learn from a film. MirrorMask, the new film by director Dave McKean and writer extraordinaire Neil Gaiman proves his point, I think. There's a wealth of stuff here, plenty you can learn from and appreciate. That I did not like it, and therefore can't recommend it, seems trivial by comparison.\n\nThe film concerns the quest of young Helena (Stephanie Leonidas), a feisty circus performer who wishes her parents led more normal lives. When her mother is suddenly hit with terrible illness, Helena is magically transported to an alternate universe where she must fight against overwhelming odds to return home. The key to her journey lies with the mysterious MirrorMask, a talisman of such power that it could both help her escape and heal the Light Queen of the wonderland she finds herself in. Complicating her trip is the discovery that, while she was taken into the dreamy \"Dark Lands,\" an anti-Helena was transported into the real world. This Dark Helena has no intention of leaving her new surroundings.\n\nIt is with, perhaps, a hint of irony that MirrorMask begins, not with this dreamy landscape, however, but with a complete reversal of familiar tropes as a young circus performer yells at her mother and threatens to run away and join the real world. I say \"perhaps\" because it is entirely possible Gaiman included it as a joke merely so every critic in the country will mention it in his or her review. It seems somehow indicative of the kitchen sink philosophy MirrorMask embodies.\n\nIndeed, this film is so chock-full of fantastic and bizarre images – from books that transport people across town, to riddling sphinxes, to walking rubies, to giants that float in mid-air – that it's the rare film that makes effects seem \"special\" again. This is not your father's exploding Death Star. Seeing MirrorMask in a packed theater made me wish I had seen it from the front row of an empty auditorium. Better still, from the vantage point of my floor as I lied on my back with a couple of beers and let the images and colors wash over me. I may indeed rent the movie for this very reason.\n\nBut the movie's great success – the absurdly beautiful images it repeatedly conjures out of thin air – is also its great weakness. There's a story here somewhere tantalizing us below the surface of impressive imagination, but that story never breaks through to make us care about the characters or their choices. MirrorMask, then, plays less like a cohesive film and more like a collection of amazing scenes. Each on its own is fascinating, like when Helena and her scout Valentine (Jason Barry) escape from dark emissaries on half-bird, half-ape creatures. But strung together the film lacks structure.\n\nMuch will no doubt be made of the fact that MirrorMask is produced and funded by Jim Henson Studios. As somebody who had a Kermit doll in his crib, I couldn't be happier that the great Henson name is again backing films. But then I always loved the imaginative leaps of The Muppet Movie more than The Dark Crystal. To be sure, the Muppets were bizarre, but at the center of every adventure was a profoundly moving heart, a heart that for all its visual sorcery MirrorMask lacks. If you're the other way around, though, by all means see MirrorMask. Just do it from the front row with the sound off. You'll make my UCLA friend proud.\n\n2 out of 5 Stars, 4/10 Score"
