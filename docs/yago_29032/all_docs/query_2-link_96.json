        "text": "Like The Company of Wolves and The Wizard of Oz, MirrorMask, a collaboration between cult illustrators, designers and comic book artists Dave McKean and Neil Gaiman, is quite open about being the anxiety dream of an adolescent girl. She's Helena (Stephanie Leonidas), whose mother (Gina McKee) and father (Rob Brydon) live in Brighton and run a second-rate circus.\n\nMum has been taken into hospital shortly after Helena has wished her dead and the guilty girl makes a therapeutic nocturnal journey through a world of strange creatures and masked humans. Mixing live action, stylised sets and computer-generated images, the movie has a rough-hewn, handmade feeling that is the opposite of Hollywood slickness."
