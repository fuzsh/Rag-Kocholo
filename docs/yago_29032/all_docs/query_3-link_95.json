She juggles, and she sells popcorn, and she really does not long to be in the circus, and she would quite like to run away and join real life.\"\n\nGaiman described the story to an audience of around 4,500 conventioneers, while McKean displayed a series of computer generated images that were projected onto the big screen from his laptop. \"Helena has a dream, or something that may not quite be a dream, in which she gets to try and sort everything out for herself in her own way,\" Gaiman said. \"It's a dream in which she winds up in this very strange land, which is divided into the light kingdom and the dark kingdom. ... And there are all sorts of peculiar adventures to be had.\"\n\nGaiman said that the project was originally conceived by executive producer Lisa Henson of Jim Henson Pictures, who wanted to develop a new film that could equal the cult status of the company's earlier works. \"The whole thing all started with a phone call from Lisa,\" Gaiman said. \"She said that TriStar had noticed that The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth, far from being the financial failures that they were commonly perceived to be, actually had become these rock-solid, perennial sellers that people bought on video and then bought on DVD.'\""
