        "text": "[Reader advisory: Please consult my review of The Ocean at the End of the Lane for some important information regarding this author.]\n\nHate to say it, but ever since Neil Gaiman endedÂ The SandmanÂ and left the comics industry to become a quote-unquoteÂ realÂ writer, Iâve been not-quite-overwhelmed by his output. His multi-award-winningÂ American GodsÂ was a dazzling mess, and his equally laudedÂ CoralineÂ was, I felt, a needlessly compromised attempt at a grim fairy tale. (The movie was actuallyÂ tonsÂ better.) It seemed Gaiman was propelling himself onto the overrated list, delivering heavily hyped event novels which sounded the Pavlovian bell of style-over-substance for an eager fanboy throng.\n\nAnansi BoysÂ puts those fears to rest. Still rooted in Gaimanâs enduring fascination with gods and myths, the book shows the most whimsical side of Gaiman weâve seen sinceÂ Good Omens. And yet, except for one or two passages that are clearly in homage, he avoids obvious allusions to his collaborator on that book, that force of comic nature better known as Terry Pratchett. Gaimanâs acknowledgements page acknowledges Wodehouse, among others, and there is much more of that great humoristâs influence in evidence than Iâve seen from Gaiman before. And unlikeÂ American Gods, there is a far more focused and consistently satisfying story here. Ultimately,Â Anansi BoysÂ may be just a trifle. Reading it often feels like youâre eating a rich dessert made up entirely of meringue, whipped cream, and marshmallows. Delicious going down, but not exactly something that leaves you feeling nourished or even particularly well-fed.\n\nBut come on â we donât eat desserts for the nutrients, we eat them for the yummy calories!\n\nPerhaps Gaimanâs maturation as a novelist (not to mention his development as a humorist) has had something to do with the fact heâs been pacing himself. Itâs been four years sinceÂ American Gods, after all, during which time Gaiman has teamed up with longtimeÂ SandmanÂ collaborator Dave McKean for some striking childrenâs books and the fantasy filmÂ Mirrormask. Having stretched himself into other fields thus, Gaimanâs novel-writing has avoided the creative stagnation that could have crept in had he promptly and greedily responded toÂ Godsâ rampant success with some shake-ân-bake sequels.Â\n\nAnansi BoysÂ follows the life of Charles Nancy, a breed of protagonist quite common to British comedy (Wodehouse in particular). Heâs the nebbish who wants a normal life, yet cannot seem to do anything right, or at the very least, anything that doesnât put him in a humiliating situation. Yet all his problems arenât entirely his own doing. Heâs been anointed with the nickname Fat Charlie, by a flamboyant father whose penchant for pure whimsy was always a source of acute embarrassment. And his shame at his fatherâs antics has colored not only his relationships and perceptions of the world, but his self-image. His job, working as a financial advisor for a supercilious boss with a bad habit of speaking entirely in clichÃ©d catchphrases and embezzling from his wealthy clients, and his fianceÃ©, a traditional young woman who frustrates him by holding out on sex until marriage, donât do much to enhance his happiness.Â\n\nBut upon his fatherâs death, he learns a few startling secrets. For one thing, his father, it appears, was no man, but the trickster god Anansi (who also appeared inÂ American Gods). Furthermore, Charlie has a brother heâs previously known nothing about. An enigmatic fellow calling himself Spider, he begins to intrude upon Charlieâs life, even moving into his flat. At first this seems like an attempt at creating a real fraternal bond by an estranged brother. But soon, Spider is taking more after their late (?) father than Charlie. A wild success at every social and personal achievement that has eluded Charlie, Spider is before long courting (with equal success) Charlieâs fianceÃ©. Enough is enough. And when Charlie turns to some of his fatherâs old acquaintances for help in getting his brother out of his life â some crotchety old ladies intended as a parody ofÂ Macbethâs witches â he learns a thing or two about who he, his brother, and his father really are.\n\nWhereasÂ American GodsÂ examined the role of myths in culture, here, gods and goddesses and spirits are more of a backdrop to the main story of Charlieâs personal journey from wimp to man of action. (The titleÂ Anansi BoysÂ is also a pun upon Charlieâs last name and the insult ânancy boy,â a class of wimp to whose ranks Charlie certainly belongs at the storyâs opening.) Throughout, the pacing is quite brisk â even average readers wonât have a problem polishing this off in a couple of evenings â and the wit sharp, with a smattering of laugh-out-loud bits (my favorite involves stuffing a turkey) worthy of Wodehouse, Pratchett, and Adams. So involved is Gaiman with the light-hearted spirit in which heâs telling the story that heâs all too happy to let lackadaisical plot gaffes slide. As the book moves toward its climax, Gaiman tosses off some wildly improbable contrivances in order to get all of his principals together in the same location for the dual showdown, resolving both the main plot thread involving Charlie and Spider and a subplot about Charlieâs crooked boss.Â\n\nBut as the book finally gets us where we wanted to end up, who cares? Itâs an entertainment, a trifle, a charming tall tale to put a smile on your face on a rainy day. No, itâs not the four-course dinner you might get from truly top-flight humorists like Wodehouse and Pratchett. But you know what they say. Life is short. Eat dessert first."
