        "text": "Surrealist illustrator, filmmaker, artist, and musician Dave McKean returns with his new film Luna (2015). Luna made its world premiere at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival and was met with positive reviews. The film follows a grieving couple who are struggling to live their daily lives after losing their baby. In order to get back to normal they visit an old friend and his girlfriend who help them come back down to Earth after they begin to lose themselves in a series of strange dreams. Besides his own works including his comic book Cages (1990-96), Dave McKean is known for his illustrations for many of Neil Gaiman’s works including Coraline, The Graveyard Book, and Sandman. Back in 2005 with the help of the Jim Henson Company, McKean and Gaiman teamed up to create the surreal fantasy adventure MirrorMask. MirrorMask follows the story of Helena whose family owns a traveling circus. After a fight with her mother, her mother ends up hospitalized. Helena deals with the tragedy by escaping to a fantasy world where she finds out she is trapped and must race to save both her mother and herself.\n\nStephanie Leonidas who played Helena in MirrorMask will return in Luna which I am excited about. MirrorMask and Luna both deal with reality versus fantasy and how the two worlds interact when dealing with tragedy. Luna is an emotional and dramatic film with imagination guiding the characters inner worlds. These strange dreams emerge from the couples most vulnerable moments representing grief in a beautiful poetic form. The worlds of live action and animation clash creating a fantastic world that only Dave McKean can capture. Luna will be Dave McKean’s first film he has both written and directed. He has directed The Gospel of Us (2012), MirrorMask (2005), and a few short films and music videos. As well as being a concept artist for TV series Neverwhere (2006) and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire.\n\nLuna is now available on Blu-Ray and DVD (UK only)\n\nCheck out Dave McKean’s art HERE\n\nTo keep up to date on Luna’s releases:\n\nFacebook"
