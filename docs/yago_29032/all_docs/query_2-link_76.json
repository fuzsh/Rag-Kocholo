Directed by acclaimed visual artist ~Dave McKean~, and it shows. Written by acclaimed author/comic book guy Neil Gaiman, and it also shows.\n\nHelena Campbell is a teenage girl who wants to leave her home at the circus to go and join real life. She gets into an argument with her mother, who then falls spontaneously ill with what is presumably a brain tumor. Helena blames herself, and dreams (maybe) that she travels to a magical world made entirely out of pictures she has drawn.\n\nThe City of Light is being gradually destroyed because the White Queen (who bears a suspicious resemblance to her mother) has fallen ill and the Charm to wake her has been stolen by someone called the Dark Princess, daughter of the Dark Queen (who also bears a suspicious resemblance to Helena's mother). Accompanied by a bizarre Irish juggler named Valentine, Helena journeys from the White City to the Darklands to find the Charm and save both the White Queen and her mother.\n\nDeliberately made as a Spiritual Successor to Labyrinth, and like it, the film has gained a cult following, due largely to the massive fan bases of Gaiman and McKean.\n\nBy the way, the circus isn't scary, nor is the clown.\n\nTropes used in Mirror Mask include:\n\nA Darker Me\n\nActing for Two - Stephanie Leonidas is Helena and the Dark Princess. Rob Brydon is Morris Campbell and the Prime Minister. Gina McKee is Joanne Campbell, the White Queen, and the Dark Queen. Jason Barry is Valentine and his equivalent in the human world.\n\nAction Dress Rip - Helena does this to the dress she aquired in her Evil Makeover.\n\nAll Just a Dream - Although we know this from pretty early on.\n\nOr Was It a Dream?? The final scene implies that, while it was all a dream, it wasn't just a dream.\n\nWith Neil Gaiman, it's never just a dream.\n\nAll Take and No Give - The Dark Queen and the Princess, one of the most dysfunctional family units in fantasy.\n\nAnd You Were There - All of the main characters including Helena, although Valentine's equivalent is met after the dream.\n\nAre You Pondering What I'm Pondering? -\n\nArson, Murder, and Jaywalking:"
