        "text": "I'm a big fan of the visual style of Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean's Mirrormask, and I was thinking it was about time to make some props. Namely, the key to the Mirrormask's hiding place, and \"A Really Useful Book.\" Neither one seems too ridiculously difficult, but I might need some help, since I don't exactly have any resources. But I will try my best to contribute to this community for once.\n\nThe key:\n\nhttp://x.seventh-sin.org/gallery/displayim...album=3&pos=260\n\nhttp://x.seventh-sin.org/gallery/displayim...album=3&pos=261\n\nhttp://x.seventh-sin.org/gallery/displayim...album=3&pos=407\n\nhttp://x.seventh-sin.org/gallery/displayim...album=3&pos=329\n\nIt doesn't seem too ridiculously complex. How does one go about making something like this? Should I try making it from clay, or what?\n\nOh, and I also found a site that claimed that some keys were once made, cast from the screen-used key. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any information about these official ones other than this obscure article: Mirrormask Collectibles\n\nThe book:\n\nhttp://x.seventh-sin.org/gallery/displayim...album=3&pos=181\n\nhttp://x.seventh-sin.org/gallery/displayim...album=3&pos=182\n\nhttp://x.seventh-sin.org/gallery/displayim...album=3&pos=183\n\nhttp://x.seventh-sin.org/gallery/displayim...album=3&pos=295\n\nhttp://x.seventh-sin.org/gallery/displayim...album=3&pos=496\n\nhttp://x.seventh-sin.org/gallery/displayim...album=3&pos=523\n\nThis seems fairly simple to make. The only difficult part would be re-creating McKean's handwriting style properly...it's very distinctive, after all.\n\nSorry I couldn't find any higher-resolution screencaps, they aren't my own. If anyone has anything to add, or any sources that already worked on this stuff that I missed, I'd love to hear it. Thanks.\n\n<div class='quotetop'>(Zev @ Oct 9 2006, 06:56 PM) [snapback]1334956[/snapback]</div>\n\nYou, uh, wanna sort out the pictures there, chief?\n\nI know Dark Horse published a 'Really Useful Book':\n\nReally Useful Book\n\nAlthough I'm not sure if that yellow circle on the front is a sticker...\n\n[/b]\n\nThanks for the tip on the book, I'll look and see if I can scrounge one of those up.\n\nBut I don't see why you made that comment about the pictures. After all, the key pictures are in the key section, and the book pictures are in the book section. And not that the order in which the pictures appear even matters, but the book pictures are all in the order of when the scenes appear in the movie. Yes, there are two pages in the book referring to Mother's advice, one at the beginning and one at the end. I'll admit the key pictures are mixed-up, but I don't see how that matters.\n\nStill no pictures. If I copy/past the URLs to a new browser tab they show up. This may mean that your host does not allow remote linking. You see them because they arleady in your browsers cache.\n\nI've been thinking about MirrorMask props as well. For the key, I would like to cast it in sterling silver. There's a centrifigal caster collection dust in my Mom's garage because I don't have anywhere to set it up right now :cry The \"Eye & nose\" section as well as the spikes appear to be seperate pieces, which simplifies the sculpting.\n\nI intend to make the Really Useful Book \"post-sacrifice\" as it only leaves one page of text to replicate in addition to the cover, and it ends up being the most important quote in the brave little book. I've had no problem finding all sorts of small, red, blank paged journals. The trick seems to be finding that does not have the word \"Journal\" or \"Diary\" already embossed into the cover :angry It's beginning to get irritating... but my search continues undetered.\n\nI thought this might make a good base to replicate the mask:\n\nIt's from this web site:\n\nhttp://www.unitedmaskandparty.com/Masks/character.htm\n\nThe eyes need to be reshaped and the features sharped. The brow and nose ridges of the MirrorMask are very hard lined. Obviously the moon has to go. However, it seems to have the correct general shape and proportions. The chrome finish is coincidental since modifiying the features will certainly ruin it and it will require refinishing.\n\nI ordered an \"official\" Really Useful Book yesterday. It was produced by Dark Horse, and it doesn't seem like a bad deal. It looks more or less the same on the outside (I say more or less because I can't tell exactly what's written inside the gold circle on the screen-used book), but I think it's a bit larger than the original. Personally, I think it looks fine - I'm more of a good-enough-ist than a perfectionist, and at $15 shipped, it's perfect for my rather limited funds.\n\nThe inside pages are blank, but have tiny messages printed in invisible ink in the corners (written by Neil Gaiman). It comes with an invisible ink pen to write your own secret messages, and a mini U.V. light to reveal the ink. How cute.\n\nI was thinking that, in addition to re-creating the text from the screen-used pages, it might be fun to convert Gaiman's invisible messages into Dave McKean-style inked pages, if I could figure out how they ought to be penned. I'm a big fan of non-canon stuff, if'n you can't tell.\n\nAnd I'm sorry about all this hullabaloo with the pictures, folks. I should have figured out that cache thing.\n\nRedTwoX, I would happily buy a sterling silver key. How much do you think that would run?\n\n<div class='quotetop'>(Patattack @ Oct 10 2006, 11:02 AM) [snapback]1335406[/snapback]</div>\n\nRedTwoX, I would happily buy a sterling silver key. How much do you think that would run?\n\n[/b]\n\nI wouldn't care to venture a guess right now. The jewlery supply where I used buy sterling silver for casting closed a few years ago. I have no idea what the going rate is now. I also have no idea how much I need per casting until a master is made. All of that is purely academic until I can find a place to set up the centrifigul caster. I didn't have much luck house hunting this summer, and trying to sling molten metal in my two bed room condo is a BAD. idea.\n\nThis will be a long term project. I have kicked around the idea of knocking out a \"stand in\" out of resin as Southreplicas suggested.\n\nJuno,\n\nThanks a million on the lead for the Really Useful Book :thumbsup I'm off to track down Pentalic."
