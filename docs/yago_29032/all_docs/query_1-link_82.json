You’ll come right back for more.\n\nHate for sale. Enough to start a war.\n\nHate the rich, the brown, the black, the poor.\n\nHate is clean. And hate will make you sure.\n\nHate for sale. You’ll feel superior.\n\nHate for sale. You’ll make the news.\n\nHate the families who come here fleeing war.\n\nHate the gay. The trans. The new. The Jews.\n\nDon’t need to care who you detest\n\nHate makes you feel a whit less scared\n\nTo know that your group is the best\n\nAnd burn to ashes all the rest\n\nWho will not face the real test\n\nBut showed up naked, unprepared\n\nTo be sent back, or drowned, or hurled\n\nback into the abyss. Your world\n\nwill be so safe, so clean, so great.\n\nAnd all you needed was some hate.\n\nHate for sale. All the very best\n\nHate for sale. Vintage stuff.\n\nDo my cries excite your interest?\n\nHate for sale. Never enough."
