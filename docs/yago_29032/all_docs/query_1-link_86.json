        "text": "By Golly, I says to myself, that's pretty/striking/odd/imaginative, but what does it mean? At any point in MirrorMask, this was the question hovering over my head in the imaginary comic-book dialogue bubble.\n\nThe film is a British fantasy containing live action and computer animation about Helena (Stephanie Leonidas), a pretty 15-year-old girl who wants to escape her (drab) life in the family circus.\n\n\"I want to run away to real life,\" she cries. When her mother (Gina McKee) collapses mid-show after a raging argument, Helena is suffused with guilt. While her ineffectual father (Rob Brydon) tries to keep the circus going, Helena slips into a waking dream full of fabulous, frightening creatures and bizarre goings-on. It's like a computer-graphics modernisation of Alice in Wonderland, except that Lewis Carroll had more sense of humour.\n\nThere's a cubist creature with half of Stephen Fry's face that looks like a child's mobile sculpture; nasty little sphinxes with human faces that like to eat books; white \"monkeybirds\", with the body of a gorilla and a stylised avian head, except that their cone-like beaks keep falling off. Great black flocks of other birds descend every so often, sometimes turning into sticky tar. A spider with a big eye instead of a body scuttles about menacingly.\n\nHelena and her dream companion Valentine (Jason Barry) have to keep making escapes from one beautiful tableau to the next, each of which is arresting as a design idea but somewhat less arresting in terms of story.\n\nIt's like watching a Dr Who movie made by the Brit art-animators the Brothers Quay, or the late Derek Jarman - only not that good.\n\nThe film is by two stars of comic-book fantasy. Neil Gaiman wrote the DC Comics series Sandman, described by the Los Angeles Times as \"the greatest epic in the history of comic books\". The director, Dave McKean, is an illustrator and advertising director who has made some well-received shorts. The film was produced on a low budget through the Jim Henson Company, now co-run by Henson's daughter, Lisa. Gaiman and McKean apparently wrote it in her London house, to save money on hotel bills.\n\nEncouragement came from Terry Gilliam, which is not surprising, as it owes something to his brand of absurdism, and shares something of his narrative clumsiness.\n\nThe problems start and end with the script. The characters are dull figures in a fantastic landscape, whose adventures are merely metaphors. These keep piling up, layer upon layer, without adding to our sense of character. They're like random delusions, a disordered maze of techno-doodles. Trying to construct a meaning is possible, but unrewarding. McKee turns up as the Queen of Light and the Queen of Shadows, with two fantastic costumes and matching make-ups, but there's no emotion to draw from this. Her husband doubles up in the dream world as a prime minister. Why? Buggered if I know.\n\nIt's a dress-up show with massive amounts of computer grunt and no heart.\n\nMcKean has assembled an attractive cast and given them nothing to play. He moves them around like chess pieces, although chess has more logic and more drama. I know that narrative is in decline, and that the consumers of computer games don't always mind their stories being silly or derivative, so long as there is action. This one doesn't even have that. It's an arty, design-driven puff of smoke."
