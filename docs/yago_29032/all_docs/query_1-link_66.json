        "text": "Regular readers of this column at its previous location at IGN FilmForce may recall that the last few times that I reviewed books associated with Neil Gaiman, some weird occurrence befell me (most recently in \"Comics in Context\" #72: \"F. O. G.\").\n\nIn the last few weeks I found myself preparing to review the newly published screenplay of MirrorMask, the forthcoming film scripted by Gaiman and directed by his longtime collaborator Dave McKean (published by William Morrow, an imprint of HarperCollins). I've been looking forward to this project ever since hearing McKean and Gaiman talk about it two years ago at Comic-Con International (see \"Comics in Context\" #7: \"San Diego 2003: Day Two: From Henson to Hamill\").\n\nSo now, of course, I was on the lookout for the next weird occurrence.\n\nSince I write this column virtually every week, I like finding continuing themes and running gags, like finding some excuse to mention IGN Comics contributor Fred Hembeck in each installment.\n\nIt's certainly weird that the MirrorMask screenplay has been published so many months before the movie itself is to be released in September. (The film was first publicly shown in January at the Sundance Film Festival, and shortly afterwards at a considerably less snow-covered festival in Florida.) Then again. plenty of movies are made from pre-existing novels or plays. Much, perhaps most, of the original audience for Gone with the Wind, say, had already read the novel and knew what would happen in the movie. How differently, really, is the case of MirrorMask?\n\nBesides, reading the MirrorMask book actually increases my interest in seeing the movie, since the suspense for me now lies not in finding out how the story ends but in how McKean will visually translate onscreen this fantasy that he and Gaiman jointly concocted. The published screenplay is illustrated by McKean's storyboard, but storyboards vary considerably in kind. Recently Danny Fingeroth and I jointly interviewed artist Bill Sienkiewicz at the Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art (MoCCA, at www.moccany.org.), where he showed a slide show of much of his work, including a storyboard he had done for a sequence for the live action movie Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas. These turned out to be a series of detailed, brilliantly colored watercolor paintings which astonished the audience at MoCCA. McKean's MirrorMask storyboard is at the other end of the spectrum from these: McKean's basically consist of small thumbnail sketches, which only provide hints of the actual look of the completed film. However, the book does have two sections of color photographs, both behind the scenes shots of the making of the film, and, more importantly, images from the film itself. the latter should whet readers' desire to see MirrorMask onscreen as much as they did mine.\n\nSo, the book's early publication is insufficiently weird for my purposes.\n\nIs there anything else that I can find that seems strange?\n\nWell, I had been told at my favorite New York comics store that the MirrorMask book wouldn't be available in May, and then within less than a week I found and bought a copy (at a good discount, too) at the Barnes & Noble at Manhattan's Lincoln Square. That's weird, but no more than momentarily interesting.\n\nBut why was I at that particular Barnes & Noble on a Sunday night? it's because it is across the street from Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, and I was busying myself looking at books before the start of the Film Society of Lincoln Center's showing of the 1951 film of my favorite opera, Jacques Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann (www.filmlinc.com). This is based on three fantasy tales by the German writer E. T. A. Hoffmann, one of which was titled The Sandman (!). As it turns out, Tales of Hoffmann and MirrorMask have various themes and devices in common: puppets, mirrors and reflections, a mysterious fatal illness, the creative artist as hero, the artist whose stories become alternate realities onscreen, a woman who appears as a doll, and characters who manifest in multiple guises. Unless I someday read Gaiman or McKean referring to Tales of Hoffmann, I'm attributing these similarities to mere accident, but now I feel I'm on the right track to weird coincidences.\n\nBut there's more. The showing of the Tales of Hoffmann film was part of the Film Society's retrospective, \"Michael Powell: Unending Beauty,\" marking the late British director's centennial, and, unexpectedly, the screening was introduced by his widow, film editor Thelma Schoonmaker. (This is one of those only-in-New-York happenstances.) Powell is best known for his long collaboration with writer Emeric Pressburger, most famously on the ballet film The Red Shoes, and on Hoffmann as well.\n\nThe Film Society's May program book provided further food for thought: \"'Powell always identified with the 'fantastic' strand of English culture,' wrote Laura Mulvey in her notes for the DVD of Peeping Tom [another Powell film] 'and succeeded better than anyone in adapting it for the cinema. The 'fantastic' or the 'gothic,' not only aims to disturb its reader or spectator, it disturbs the boundaries of cultural tradition. It stands in opposition to British realism and merges with the European fantastic.' This strain in Powell's work, almost all of which has intimations of the supernatural, is at the heart of his singularity in English cinema, and accounts for a lot of the bafflement and hostility with which his films were greeted.\"\n\nCertainly America too has critics who prize realism so highly that they react to the \"fantastic\" in film — or comics — with \"bafflement and hostility,\" as I have shown time and again in \"Comics in Context.\"\n\nBut here's something I had not considered before: the notion that Gaiman and McKean are contemporary practitioners of a tradition of \"fantastic\" narrative in English culture that has long stood as an alternative to English realism. Who and what else is in this tradition: Shakespeare's The Tempest, Swift's Gulliver's Travels, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Dickens' A Christmas Carol, Lewis Carroll's Alice books, W. S. Gilbert's Iolanthe, Bram Stoker's Dracula, all the way up through the initial-laden ranks of H. G. Wells, C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, Arthur C. Clarke, and J. K. Rowling? (Among its many other virtues, Alan Moore's League of Extraordinary Gentlemen serves as a catalogue of \"fantastic\" literature of the past. See \"Comics in Context\" #22, 23, 66.)\n\nThe Film Society May program guide inspired me to further, shall we say, reflections, in a section that referred to the Hoffmann film as \"probably\" Powell's \"boldest experiment and deepest venture into artifice.\"\n\nThe guide stated that \"When many of us hear Michael Powell's name, we think of artifice, in the true sense of the word—'the making of anything by art, construction, workmanship,' according to the OED. Where most filmmakers. . . used fabricated sets or landscapes as replacements or fill-ins for unruly reality, for Powell artifice led the way to a totalizing vision, the creation of a world unto itself, and a world view as well.\" According to the guide, in the mid-1940s Powell and Pressburger joined with their collaborators \"to create a new kind of cinema — call it the Art film. Or, as Powell put it, the Composed film.\"\n\nWatching the Hoffmann film shows what the Film Society writer means. The elaborately designed set for the tavern in which Hoffmann tells his stories is blatantly theatrical, not realistic at all; Olympia the doll dances before a minimalist, but equally stagelike setting. The seductress Giulietta rides in a gondola through a painting evoking Venice and its canals. Later Hoffmann and his companion Nicklausse undertake a voyage through the classic painting \"Isle of the Dead.\" There are special effects throughout. The sorcerer Dappertutto transforms globs of wax into diamonds; Olympia is dismembered into still moving, robotic body parts. Towards the end the four female lead characters, all representing Hoffmann's beloved, merge before our eyes into a single figure. Watching the movie, I found myself thinking, what might Powell and Pressburger have done had they been making this film today, in the age of CGI?\n\nAha! Then is Powell and Pressburger's Hoffmann a \"high art\" forerunner of today's series of films which combine live actors with computer-generated backgrounds and CGI animation, this new school of filmmaking which includes the Lord of the Rings film trilogy, The Polar Express and Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (see \"Comics in Context\" #66: \"A Christmas Potpourri\"), the Sin City movie (\"Comics in Context\" #78, 79, 83 and another still to come), and the Star Wars: Episode I-III trilogy (see next week's \"Comics in Context\")?\n\nWith McKean conceiving designs for the characters' masks, costumes and makeup, devising computer-generated settings and creating CGI animated characters for the movie, MirrorMask is a contemporary equivalent of the \"Composed\" film, wherein virtually everything but the actors is \"artificial,\" created by the filmmakers.\n\nSo, there I was on a Sunday evening, watching a \"composed\" film by a British director-writer team who specialized in the \"fantastic,\" having just bought the book of a forthcoming CGI film by another longrunning artist/director-writer team who are best known for their work in fantasy. Yes, this is just the kind of strange juxtaposition I needed: not so much weird as intriguing, providing fodder for this week's column and many to come. Gaiman is currently teaming with Zemeckis and writer Roger Avary on a film of Beowulf which employs CGI and motion-capture technology in the manner of Polar Express, and that will be yet another example of the 21st century \"Composed\" film of the \"fantastic.\"\n\nAnd now, all of you who don't wish to learn about what happens in MirrorMask should duck and cover in your Spoiler Warning shelters. The Detailed Analysis commences now.\n\nCertainly MirrorMask has plenty of familiar Gaiman motifs: cats (here represented as human-faced sphinxes, but with distinctly feline personalities); blank, inhuman eyes; a librarian; spiders; the friendly animals who aid the protagonist; \"the Dream-lands.\" As in The Wolves in the Walls, the young heroine is displaced from her home by a usurper; as in Neverwhere the protagonist crosses over into an alternate realm than that of her everyday life (see \"Comics in Context\"#18: \"All about Doors and Walls\"). The strongest parallel is with Gaiman's Coraline, in which another young girl heroine, disgruntled with her parents, enters into an alternate universe in which she contends with an evil counterpart to her mother and saves her real parents (see \"Comics in Context\" #67: \"Catch as Cats Can\").\n\nWhat first and foremost strikes me as new and different about MirrorMask is its twist on a familiar device of children's fantasy stories. If Alice dreamed about Wonderland and Dorothy (in the 1939 MGM movie) dreamed about Oz, then they must have had creative imaginations as brilliant as those of Lewis Carroll and L. Frank Baum, respectively (see \"Comics in Context\" #25: \"Byrne, Baum and Bumble\"). Helena, the young heroine of MirrorMask, likewise has an adventure in an alternate, supernatural reality. which may or may not exist only in her dream. (During her adventure, Helena even realizes that she is having a dream, and at its conclusion, her father wakes her up in the real world, and yet a character from that \"dream\" — or that character's counterpart — turns up in the real world at the film's conclusion.) But MirrorMask explicitly presents its dreamworld as Helena's creation. Helena is the creative artist as heroine. The story she creates represents her own unconscious, and she enters into the imaginative world she has devised in order to resolve her psychological conflicts from within it.\n\nIn fact, the movie opens with Helena putting on a primitive sort of puppet show for herself, with a white sock on one hand, representing a good queen, and a black sock on the other, representing her enemy, the evil queen. The two sock puppets fight as Helena performs the voices of both.\n\nFirst, it is highly appropriate that a movie produced by the Jim Henson Company should start with a puppet show; perhaps this is in part McKean and Gaiman's homage to the late Mr. Henson (see \"Comics in Context\" #47: \"Retro Hero Retrospective\").\n\nSecond, as we shall see, within Helena's dreamworld there is a conflict between a \"real\" good queen and evil queen. Each represents an aspect of Helena's mother. Whether Helena is conscious of it or not at the beginning of the film, this puppet version of the war between the good and evil queens symbolizes her own conflicted attitudes towards her mother.\n\nBut there is still more. The fact that Helena does the voices of the puppet queens, and hence is playing their roles, suggests that Helena is projecting the \"good\" and \"evil\" sides of her own personality onto these fictional representations of her mother. Don't the characters created by a writer all represent aspects of his or her own self?\n\nAs we shall see, the division of her mother into the good queen and the Dark Queen in MirrorMask is paralleled by the division of Helena into her good self (Gaiman notes in the book that Helena's name is derived from a word meaning \"light\") and her Jungian shadow self, which Gaiman and McKean dub the \"Anti-Helena.\" The divided self is a perennial theme of fantasy fiction, especially the superhero genre with its \"secret identities\" (see \"Comics in Context\" #51: \"What's New, Pussycat?\").\n\nIn the next scene with Helena, she has added a new puppet to her private show, a Harlequin figure whom she names \"Mr. Valentine.\" Doing Valentine's voice, she has him say, \"I'm a very important man,\" which will become the trademark phrase of the \"real\" Valentine when he turns up later in Helena's dreamworld. One of the puppet queens calls Valentine \"moderately brave,\" which the dreamworld Valentine will ultimately prove to be.\n\nIn his introduction Gaiman refers to Valentine as \"an unreliable, Puck — like guide.\" In the book's appendix, \"The Origins of MirrorMask,\" Gaiman's original prose version of what evolved into the screenplay, the character is even named Puck, though it is made clear he is not \"Shakespeare's Puck,\" but \"a puck,\" one of many. (This will remind Gaiman's readers of his use of Shakespeare's Puck in the Sandman story \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\": see \"Comics in Context\" #65: \"Artists Alone\".)\n\nThis suggests that Valentine is a trickster, as the dreamworld Valentine proves to be, though Helena will prove just as adept at trickery, unsurprisingly, since she is his creator.\n\nValentine's name suggests romance, and Helena is at the age at which she is having to confront her own emerging sexual drives. If the two queens are projections of sides of Helena's personality, then perhaps Valentine is what Carl Jung would call her \"animus,\" her image of what maleness is. We shall see in the course of the story that until the end Helena reacts negatively towards sex, so it fits that until the latter portion of the tale, Valentine, the most prominent male character in the dreamworld, comes off as irresponsible, cowardly, and untrustworthy.\n\nTaking this idea still further, perhaps Valentine is a projection of these qualities in Helena herself. To put it differently, Valentine embodies Helena's own childishness, and in the course of her exploits in the dreamworld, she becomes more psychologically mature, following the standard fairy tale pattern. The ultimate awakening of Valentine's own conscience and courage hence mirrors her own.\n\nI didn't use that word \"mirrors\" by accident. In this story Helena is surrounded by embodiments of aspects of herself: the two queens, Valentine, and, most explicitly, the Anti-Helena. This dreamworld is a psychological hall of mirrors. Perhaps one reason why all of the people in the dreamworld wear masks is that they are all \"masks\" — or reflections — of aspects of Helena. So, yes, even though there is a literal MirrorMask in the story, the title is symbolically appropriate as well.\n\nNot only is Helena an artist, but so are her parents, Morris and Joanne, and they all perform in what the screenplay calls the \"Campbell Family Circus.\" Whether the name alludes to Bil Keane's Family Circus cartoons I do not know, but perhaps McKean and Gaiman are joking that the inner workings of any family make it seem like a circus.\n\nSo, just as Helena puts on a puppet show for own benefit (suggesting her disdain for others?), her parents, working with other performers, are staging a full-scale circus performance for an audience. Morris and Joanne even play roles in the circus, characters other than themselves, as Helena does in her puppet show. Significantly, in Gaiman's original concept for MirrorMask, Helena's parents were part of a traveling acting company that performed the works of William Shakespeare and his contemporaries Christopher Marlowe and Ben Jonson. (All three English Renaissance playwrights are characters in Sandman, and this conjures up memories of the dysfunctional parent-child relationship in Gaiman's \"Midsummer Night's Dream\": young Hamnet Shakespeare also performs in his father's troupe.)\n\nVarious circus performers wear makeup or masks: Joanne even wears a mirrored mask. A performer's role can figuratively be said to be a \"mask,\" anyway. So, since the people in Helena's dreamworld wear masks, that world reflects the circus in which she was brought up.\n\nOf course, the concept of characters in a dreamworld being counterparts to people from the protagonist's real life is familiar to anyone who has seen MGM's Wizard of Oz. Lewis Carroll's Alice books also use this device at times: the White Knight and the Dodo are both regarded as stand-ins for Carroll himself (alias Dr. Charles Dodgson: \"Dodgson,\" \"Dodo,\" get it?), and the Duck in the Caucus Race sequence is meant to be his colleague, the Reverend Duckworth.\n\nHelena is also a performer in her family circus: she juggles, using the stage name \"Fortuna\" and wearing a mask.\n\nBut, in asserting their own independent identities, teens characteristically rebel against their parents and what they regard as the old-fashioned ways of doing things. So, when Joanne calls to Helena to get ready to play her part in the circus, Helena sullenly replies, \"I'm drawing.\" Helena not only puts on her little sock puppet shows, but she also draws her own fantasy world, which will turn out to be her dreamworld. The screenplay tells us she has drawn \"a fantasy city, creatures, masks.\" She's found her own ways of expressing herself artistically, and no longer wants to participate in her parents' form of art. (But as the reference to \"masks\" suggests, Helena's fantasy world is actually inspired by her parents' circus.)\n\nMoreover, as Mr. Gaiman has stated elsewhere, children are always embarrassed by their parents. What better image for a teen's view of her parents' world as an uncool embarrassment than this: they run a circus, complete with clowns! Summoned to play her part in the circus, Helena protests, \"I don't want to go, I feel like an idiot, I look like an idiot,\" and then sums up, \"It's just stupid.\"\n\nIt's no wonder Helena seems to prefer to stay in her bedroom, wrapped up in herself: she's intolerant towards the feelings of others. Joanne points out that \"Your dad keeps this circus running on charm and peanuts, it's his dream.\" I suppose that we may be meant to think of the phrase \"working for peanuts.\" Unlike the lucky few like Mr. Gaiman, most artists don't make big bucks. Including Mr. Gaiman, they went into the arts to pursue their \"dream.\" Putting on circus performances, a fantasy world staged in real life, is Morris Campbell's art, surely as important to him, perhaps more so, as Helena's drawings of her own fantasy world are to herself.\n\nAt this point Helena selfishly doesn't care: \"Exactly, it's his thing. Why should I suffer for it?\" But not only is Helena not suffering, but she is unappreciative of the creative opportunities her family provides: Joanne points out that other kids \"want to run away and join the circus.\"\n\nHelena counters that \"I want to run away and join real life.\" Like Dorothy, she will end up learning that there's no place like home.\n\nJoanne perceives the irony in Helena's wish to \"join real life.\" After all, here's a girl who prefers to stay in her bedroom and immerse herself in a fantasy world of her own creation. Joanne asks, \"Fairy queens and magic socks, Helena? Real life. . . you couldn't handle real life.\"\n\nI wonder if behind Helena's claim she wants to \"join real life\" is a question that haunts creative artists: are all the sacrifices made to follow one's dream worth it? I am reminded of Gaiman's Sandman #75 story The Tempest, in which Shakespeare asks Morpheus what his life would have been like had they never met, and he had not spent his life consumed with the passion to write his plays.\n\nThe tension in the argument between Helena and Joanne mounts until Joanne finally takes a step too far. Joanne says, \"You are going to be the death of me — \" whereupon Helena replies, \"I wish I was.\"\n\nSoon thereafter, Joanne falls seriously ill. The film's dialogue does not say what is wrong with her, but in the book McKean states that Joanne has cancer. It is as if Helena had willed her mother's death. This nightmarish turn of events shocks Helena back to realizing what her mother really means to her. As she watches her mother put into an ambulance, the screenplay tells us that Helena's \"face has an expression on it of pure heartbreak.\"\n\nHelena has gotten another of her wishes: she has been plunged into \"real life,\" and it's not pleasant, nor does she cope with it well. Gaiman and McKean pull off the neat trick of turning Helena figuratively into an orphan without actually killing her parents. Joanne is dying in the hospital; Morris is absent, dealing with the circus's financial troubles. Helena is staying with her great-aunt, Aunt Nan, who plays the fairy tale role of the insensitive stepmother.\n\nAccording to the screenplay, \"Helena writes 'mum, get well soon'\" on the bottom of a drawing. Not only is Helena newly sympathetic towards her mother, but it is as if she is utilizing her art to try to repair the damage she has done.\n\nEarlier the screenplay told us that Helena was \"unimpressed\" by watching her parents act affectionately towards each other. Now, as Helena rides a bus to the hospital, she sees a couple passionately kissing, and looks away, \"making a face. For a moment she looks like she's going to cry.\"\n\nWhy? Because they remind her of her parents? Because they remind Helena of her own loneliness? Because Helena is upset by reminders of her own emerging sexuality? All of the above?\n\nAt the hospital Helena apologizes to her mother (\"I didn't mean. . . what I said.\"), and Joanne significantly begins to quite an old nursery rhyme — \"There was a little girl, and she had a little curl, right in the middle of her forehead, When she was good. . . she was very, very\" — before she stops, exhausted. The rest of the rhyme states that when the little girl was good, she was very, very good, but when she was bad, she was horrid.\" This explicitly introduces the theme of Helena's divided self: her potential for both good (as she will prove in the dreamworld) and for evil (as she has already shown by verbally \"killing\" her mother).\n\nHelena also goes to visit her father, whose circus is \"off the road\"; having to attend to the medical emergency, Morris has stopped giving performances, and the members of the troupe are disbanding to find other work. Newly appreciating what her father's art means to him, Helena says, \"It's his dream,\" whereupon a tumbler replies, \"Dreams take you only so far, darling. After, you need cash\" (as I have discovered).\n\nHelena should realize that she is not responsible for the collapse of her family's once stable, happy world: she cannot give a person cancer. But Helena did inflict severe emotional pain on her mother through wishing her dead. Thus, Helena finds herself fusing her rejection of Joanne with Joanne's illness: \"I still haven't said sorry, not really sorry, not so she believes me. . . crying. I shouldn't have shouted at her. It was all my fault.\"\n\nThat is an important line to remember. Within her dream (or is it real?) Helena will contend against villains: the Dark Queen and the Anti-Helena. But we should keep in mind that these villains represent Helena's shadow side. In triumphing over them, Helena will rise above the negative side of her own personality.\n\nThere now comes the point at which Helena crosses the threshold, as Joseph Campbell would put it, into the \"enchanted realm.\" (Hey, wait a minute: Helena's last name is Campbell! And there's a book has been published applying Joseph Campbell's theories to Sandman. Another weird coincidence?) According to the screenplay, an unsmiling Helena looks into a mirror at her reflection, which smiles at her and shakes its head. At this moment Helena is displaced from the real world into an alternate reality. As noted earlier, this world takes the form of the fantasy world from Helena's drawings, and she realizes that she is dreaming its existence. So Helena has entered the world of her own artistic creation, that of both her unconscious and her imagination.\n\nThe scene with Helena and her reflection acting independently also shows that Helena has now become two people: her \"good\" self and her evil counterpart, the \"princess\" who will be known as the \"Anti-Helena.\" In Jungian terms the Anti-Helena represents Helena's shadow, her dark side.\n\nAs in the MGM Wizard of Oz, Helena soon meets fantasy world counterparts of people she knows, two of the circus performers, who are then killed by encroaching shadows. In the appendices McKean identifies the shadows as representing Joanne's illness; hence, they represent death. If this dreamworld represents Helena's subconscious, perhaps the shadows could also represent the dark side of Helena's personality, which, as we shall see, threatens to displace and overwhelm her \"good\" self.\n\nHelena now meets Valentine (her own creation from the puppet show, if you recall), and, when he tells her that there's no one left there (apart from himself) who can juggle, Helena volunteers, \"I can,\" and proceeds to do just that. So, in beginning her heroine's journey through this dreamscape, Helena has accepted the art which her parents taught her, and which she previously rejected. The juggling also seems to be a sign of interacting and cooperating with others: characters in MirrorMask juggle with each other, not alone.\n\nHelena is mistaken for \"the princess\" and taken before the Prime Minister, who is played by the same actor as her father and hence presumably represents Morris's dreamworld counterpart. In the appendices McKean refers to Gaiman's \"Prince and the Pauper\" concept, referring to Mark Twain's story in which a prince and his impoverished lookalike exchange roles. What I thought of instead was Alfred Hitchcock's recurring theme in which the protagonist is blamed for the crimes of somebody else, who symbolizes the protagonist's own shadow self.\n\nThe Prime Minister explains what has befallen this kingdom: \"The city was filled with joy, and we entertained each other with our astonishing skills.\"\n\nIn other words, it was like the circus, or like a happy family, or perhaps more specifically like a family of artists each of whom exercises his talents.\n\nAs the Prime Minister explains, this city was \"the city of light,\" ruled by the Queen of Light, who, as we shall see, looks like Joanne. \"Across the border was the city of shadows,\" ruled by the Dark Queen, who also looks like Joanne. The Queen of Light would be Helena's positive vision of her mother, as someone who loves her. The Dark Queen, who, as we see later, treats her \"princess\" as a pet, would represent Helena's negative vision of her mother, as someone who attempts to control her and deny her freedom; the Dark Queen is not all that different from the false mother in Coraline.\n\nThe real princess, the Anti-Helena, broke the \"balance\" between the Light Queen and the Dark Queen and thus between the city of light and the city of darkness. As a result, the Queen of Light has fallen into a deep sleep from which she has not wakened, and the shadows from the Dark Queen's realm are encroaching upon the city of light, slaying its inhabitants.\n\nThis is a variation on the \"Sleeping Beauty\" myth, but whereas in the familiar version the evil maternal figure (the evil fairy: Carabosse in the Tchaikovsky ballet, Maleficent in the Disney animated film) casts the good daughter figure into a deathlike sleep, here the victim is instead a good mother figure.\n\nI am reminded, of all things, of the \"Odinsleep\" from Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's Thor, whereby Odin, the (mostly) just and wise ruler of the Norse gods, periodically had to sleep undisturbed in order to renew his immortality. Of course Loki, Asgard's embodiment of the id, would take the opportunity to wreak havoc and even attempt to seize the throne. So, too, in MirrorMask while benevolent authority, in the person of the Queen of Light, sleeps, evil attempts to take over.\n\nSleep is here an image of death, and the comatose Queen of Light represents the dying Joanne.\n\nThis also reminds me of the mythic motif of the fisher king, the monarch whose illness and impotence afflicts his kingdom, which declines and decays. In non-Pythonesque versions of the Grail myth, the Holy Grail can restore the spiritual and physical health (and virility) of the king, and Helena too sets out on a quest to find the \"charm\" that can awaken the good queen and save her kingdom, which will turn out to be the MirrorMask of the title.\n\nAnd what was it that upset the \"balance\" between good and evil? The Prime Minister tells Helena that it was when \"a girl like you came to our city, from the darkness. She said she was a princess. Our queen took her in,\" and the next day, the princess was gone and the Queen of Light had fallen into her coma.\n\nHelena eventually discovers that the princess, the Anti-Helena, has taken her place in the real world, where, among other things, she antagonizes Helena's father.\n\nMy interpretation is this. The dark side of Helena's personality had increasingly emerged, and so she was, as we saw, insensitive, rude and arrogant towards her parents' needs. This ultimately led to Helena's rejection of her mother, voicing the wish that she would die. Figuratively, the shadow side of Helena had thus displaced her better nature. Helena had emotionally wounded her mother, as symbolized by Joanne's potentially fatal illness and the Queen of Light's deathlike trance.\n\nMoreover, since Helena had thus given in to her darker impulses, in the story the evil Anti-Helena, who represents that dark side, has literally taken the place of the \"real\" Helena. The Helena who is capable of goodness finds herself exiled to the dreamworld, while the Anti-Helena usurps her place in the real world. In the appendices, McKean confirms that Helena \"has lost control over her real body to her bad side.\"\n\nNote, however, that Helena's goal is not to destroy the \"bad side\" represented by the Anti-Helena and the Dark Queen. The Prime Minister put his focus on the fact that \"the balance was broken.\" Again, in the book's appendices, McKean agrees with Gaiman that \"we can only exist with both sides to our nature in balance.\" Hence, the two Helenas must again become one, but with the balance no longer tipped towards Helena's negative side.\n\nTo her credit, Helena volunteers to go on a quest to find the \"charm\" and revive the good queen. Valentine becomes her companion on the journey. and they soon consult a librarian, who delivers a speech about the origin of this fantasy world, originally written by McKean. (Gaiman's introduction to the book makes clear that, though he is credited as the writer, the story of MirrorMask resulted from the combination of his ideas and McKean's.)\n\nThe speech begins, accompanied by an \"image. . . of Helena. . . drawing cities and buildings.\" This makes clear that this fantasy world is the world of her creative imagination. The speech continues, \"Then she rested on her bed and dreamed of her creation, and the lives that inhabited it.\" Like God resting on the seventh day after creating the universe? Is God, if He exists, like an artist who has created a universe from his imagination? The image of Helena dreaming about her creation \"and the lives that inhabited it\" puts me in mind of Lewis Carroll's White King, whom, as you may recall, Alice dare not wake, because if he dreamed her into existence, she will cease to exist when he awakens.\n\nThe librarian proclaims that the city of light \"was her life and her dream, and it would live forever.\" This is a lovely statement both of the importance of an artist's creations to his life and of the potential immortality of art.\n\nThere is a lot more to say about MirrorMask, and I haven't gotten even halfway through the story yet, but I'm approaching the end of this week's column, and this is a busy season, with many other subjects that need addressing in the coming weeks, like those vengeful Sith next week. Besides, I will return to the subject of MirrorMask when the film itself premieres.\n\nSo I'll close remarking on one of my favorite bits in the screenplay, which is Helena's and Valentine's encounters with a \"gryphon\" that, \"fulfilling its mythological imperative,\" asks them the famous riddle from the myth of Oedipus. Now the riddling creature in Oedipus's story is a Sphinx, and the \"gryphon\" in the book's color photograph likewise looks like a Sphinx. (If you want to know what a gryphon looks like, to paraphrase Lewis Carroll, look at Sir John Tenniel's picture.) But, having already used the word \"sphinxes\" to describe the vicious little human-faced kitties elsewhere in MirrorMask, Gaiman and McKean call the riddling creature a \"Gryphon\" instead. Harrumph. McKean may have designed Hagrid's hippogriff in the last Harry Potter movie, but he would certainly fail Hagrid's course in mythological creatures.\n\nAnyway, in true trickster fashion, Helena and Valentine each turn the tables on the supposed \"gryphon,\" tangling him up in his own words and utterly befuddling him. It's a funny variation on the Campbellian motif of getting past the threshold guardian, reminiscent of Bugs Bunny's verbal bamboozlings of the likes of Elmer Fudd, and considering the \"gryphon's\" declarations \"You shall not pass,\" I wouldn't be surprised if Gaiman actually does want to evoke the memory of the Pythons' menacing but ineffectual Black Knight here (see \"Comics in Context\" #82: \"Idles of the King.\").\n\nShould you be seeking further amusement, I highly recommend see Ken Plume's new interview with Marvel's film mastermind Avi Arad over at our sister Web site IGN FilmForce. It should prove quite revealing to you as to the degree of insight into and understanding of Marvel's classic characters and stories that goes into the making of the film adaptations thereof.\n\nIn fact, I'd love to see someone stage a recreation of this interview as a one-act play, or perhaps as a short film. I envision Will Ferrell (in his Alex Trebek mode) as Ken Plume and Martin Short made up as Avi Arad. Perhaps if we're lucky, the real Messrs. Plume and Arad could even perform a new interview at this year's San Diego Con. After all, who could top the originals?\n\nCopyright 2005 Peter Sanderson"
