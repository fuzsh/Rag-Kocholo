        "text": "Warning: Will contain spoilers from Mirrormask\n\nThe Jim Henson company has brought so many films to life, such as The Muppets, Labyrinth, the Dark Crystal, and even the upcoming new film, Five Nights at Freddy’s. (Watching the film this Thursday, I’m so excited). However, fans are not aware of one particular film, MirrorMask. It was written by Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean, a great team that works together on the fantasy genre. This film stars Stephanie Leonidas, who plays a young girl called Helena, a gifted artist who works in a circus with her parents. She dislikes being stuck in the circus, and wishes to move on, not wanting to be a part of her father’s dream life. An argument ensues between her and her mother, and the night only gets worse when her mother suddenly faints and is sent to the hospital. Helena freaks out when she founds out from her father that her mother will be undergoing an operation, blaming herself for her mother getting stuck in such a horrible situation.\n\nShe then goes to sleep, afraid of what she will find out of her mother’s surgery the next day, only to wake up in her own hand drawn world, full of darkness and light. She meets a friendly companion named Valentine, who aids her on her quest to save the queen from the good side, who resembles her mother. She vows to save her mother’s life, even if it is only a dream…or is it? This film is plain weird, fantastical, and can be either scary or a little unsettling. However, these are not the only elements that make the film such a masterpiece.\n\n1. Helena and Valentine’s Chemistry is Amazing\n\nHelena’s partner in crime, Valentine, is what makes the film very enjoyable from beginning to end. Both actors/characters play off each other so well, Valentine’s hilarious banter along with Helena’s logical sense as they continue their journey of saving the queen is extraordinary. I adore the relationship between the characters, it strongly hints that something more is growing between them, and even if we never get an on-screen kiss, it’s so obvious the two care more of each other than they let on. Valentine’s character design is so awesome too, the fact that we never get to see his face while expressing so much emotion and hilarity to Helena is so original, I love it!\n\n2. The Design of Helena’s Drawings Are So Uncanny To Watch\n\nHelena’s drawings coming to life in her dream are so unsettling to watch. The visuals look so weird and a creepy, even though the CGI can appear a little funky during the whole film, it makes a lot of sense why Helena and Valentine look off in so many scenes. They don’t belong in this strange world, they are human beings that belong in their own normal environment, and I’m glad the writers didn’t bother with making the CGI perfect. Dreams are supposed to not make any sense, we are meant to feel lost in a universe we are not familiar with. How Helena was able to keep her cool during every single sequence is crazy, but considering that these are her literal drawings, maybe she secretly was thrilled to be in a world that she made on her own, or maybe Valentine was the main reason why her sanity was intact. (He definitely kept her distracted with his comments).\n\n3. The Story is Beyond Your Imagination\n\nMirrorMask has one of those cliche plot lines, but it is delivered in a very unique progression. Helena must save her mother in the dream world, so that her mother will live on in the real world. However, the plot is a lot more insane than you think. Helena doesn’t just run into her mother in the dream world, she runs into other familiar faces, such as her father, and other companions from the circus. Little does she know that her own doppelganger escaped from the darkness side, entering into Helena’s real world, taking her place, causing havoc upon her family life. Helena must find the ‘charm’ that Helena’s twin used to leave the dark side, before it is too late. So yeah, the plot does sound super complicated, but it does not appear that way at all. The story is pretty straightforward, and it moves along pretty fast while exposing all the main sources in the film. Trust me, it’s a pretty easy story to follow, there is just a lot of craziness thrown in.\n\n4. The Soundtrack Is Spectacular\n\nThe music played throughout the movie is one of a kind. It’s a sort of sultry/melancholy soundtrack, that plays so well with the atmosphere of the film. It can sometimes be eerie in some sequences, be adventurous during the hard road ahead of the main duo’s journey, and a bit sexy during one scene in the movie, (Helena runs into an evil version of her mother, and she is forced to embrace the darkness as her mother, it is so beautiful to watch). Even the end credits feature a great song, written by both Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean, it is literally the perfect song to end the film, like you just woke up from a strange dream.\n\n5. The Item Helena Needs to Escape Her Dreams and Save the Queen/Mother Is One of the Most Creative Ideas Ever Put to Film\n\nI’ve never seen a movie pull this kind of creativity before, when it comes to retrieving an item to escape from a horrible situation. Helena eventually figures out what it was her dark half used to escape into her world, coming across the MirrorMask. Yes, a literal mask made out of a mirror. Helena must put on the mask to face her dark self, in order to send both her and her evil version back to where they came from. It sounds like poor written fan fiction that sounds impossible to pull off, but the execution of that final scene before Helena wakes from her dream is the icing on the cake. It’s so surreal and beautiful when their two halves join together, each being sent back to their worlds, it is the perfect execution to end the nightmare that Helena created.\n\nI believe MirrorMask can be found on Amazon Prime, but I think that’s about it. Unfortunately, it is a very difficult movie to find online, I only got lucky when I first discovered it on DVD. I wouldn’t recommend this film to those who lack imagination, but I hope they enjoy it nonetheless!\n\nSee you soon!"
