        "text": "Re: Dear Neil Gaiman, please stop letting people make films out of your books. Thank\n\nAnd Coraline is very well done......\n\nMirrormask was absolutely brilliant and although the BBC production of Neverwhere isn't great, nor I know entirely to Neil's liking, it still has some good elements to it.\n\nI too thought that Stardust the movie was quite well done. Not quite in the same league as a Mirrormask or Coraline IMO but still a satisfying movie in its own right.\n\nBeowulf, of which I have a copy of Neil's and Roger Avary's script notes, was well... not quite so satisfying but that of course isn't one of his novels/stories.\n\nRe: Dear Neil Gaiman, please stop letting people make films out of your books. Thank\n\nAm rather curious too. Mirrormask I thought was amazing. Dark and edgy. I just wish it had been screened in the cinemas here. It would have been brilliant on the big screen. I had to get it on DVD.\n\nThe same with Coraline. I was scheduled to be screened, then postponed. Then postponed again. And now there is no word. Again I bought the DVD and was impressed. It was well done and did justice to the book.\n\nStardust was lovely. Again it was different from the book but it did get the story across and for me it was well done. For me, it was well cast and everyone did a good job with their parts. Yes, it was not exactly like the book but I don't think that is possible. I believe even Gaiman admitted as much.\n\nThe BBC take on Neverwhere could have been better yes. But still, it was not a very bad effort. The characters there are varied and not so easy to bring alive on the screen and they did give it a good shot. I would like to see a movie made of this one.\n\nI quite liked Beowulf aside from some things here and there. It's such an ancient epic. It was good to see someone doing something new with it. If nothing else, it's given new life to and renewed interest in an old tale.\n\nI believe he does have a movie about Death in the pipeline but I don't seem to see much information about it. He did say that would like to work with del Toro on it because he had quite a lot of fun on the Hellboy set.\n\nRe: Dear Neil Gaiman, please stop letting people make films out of your books. Thank\n\nGaiman's own work has usually been adapted well and in several cases with a great deal of involvement from Gaiman himself.\n\nMirrormask is fantastic - it is as much Dave McKean's baby as Gaiman's.\n\nStardust was perhaps the most Hollywoodized version, and it was still rather good.\n\nCoraline was simply wonderful.\n\nI haven't seen Neverwhere, but that TV series was the original format in which the story was made, Gaiman later did a novel in which he was able to do some things in a way the TV format didn't allow, or something to that effect.\n\nBeowulf...ah, now there is a case waiting to be made that Gaiman shouldn't be allowed to do adaptations (although that would be a tough sell when most of his work adapts elements from myth and legend). It was a deeply trashy take on a story that was fine on its own...I didn't need to see Beowulf prancing about saying 'I'm here to kill yo monstah!!!' or that disgusting bit with the two women simpering over the aged Beowulf or indeed the whole anti-heroic subtext about his dealings with Grendel's mother. The whole thing was reduced to a typical ironic contemporary narrative, the kind of thing that makes us feel we are so much smarter than our ancestors without offering any sort of examination of why they told the stories they did and what we may have in common with that.\n\nRe: Dear Neil Gaiman, please stop letting people make films out of your books. Thank\n\nOk I'll concede I forgot Mirrormask, that one is pretty good. But I can't believe what I'm hearing about Stardust in particular, I thought that was painfully bad! Just awful all over, specially Ricky Gervais's cringe-worthy cameo. Urgh, the whole thing just made me shudder. And probably a lot of why I didn't like Coraline is I don't like the stye of animation, but I guess that's personal taste.\n\nI don't really ever like films of books, so I'm probably just being grumpy but I can't help it!\n\nOh, and I'd forgotten Beowulf too (face palm) but that one didn't seem to go anywhere at all if I remember rightly?\n\nRe: Dear Neil Gaiman, please stop letting people make films out of your books. Thank\n\nHmm... Ok I'll try to watch Coraline again at some point and give it another chance... But only cause it's you! And yes, De Niro was the straw that broke the Rachael's back when it comes to Stardust.\n\nI am quite fussy when it comes to what I see as things they changed for no good reason. I understand books have to be altered and bits have to be cut out for films but when they change stuff when I can't see why (eg Door has red hair, stupid BBC people!), that sort of thing really does annoy me.\n\nRe: Dear Neil Gaiman, please stop letting people make films out of your books. Thank\n\nI read an interview in which Neil Gaiman said that he was quite pleased with the adaptation of \"Stardust.\". He didn't have a problem with any of the changes, and he understood why they were made. Perhaps having been involved in writing scripts himself gives him a different perspective than the rest of us.\n\nAnyway, I thought \"Stardust\" was charming. I didn't like the Ricky Gervais cameo, either, and there were a few other things I didn't like, but they didn't spoil the movie for me.\n\nI think it is easy to blame Hollywood for everything one doesn't like. Is it possible that all British adaptations of books are flawless? Although, living in America, I have undoubtedly missed a great many of them, some of those I have seen disappointed me.\n\nRe: Dear Neil Gaiman, please stop letting people make films out of your books. Thank\n\nWell, I'm not expecting everyone to feel the same way I do, I was just voicing an opinion Clearly I'm in the minority, and all the interviews I've read Neil Gaiman has always said he was pleased with all the screen adaptations too. I told you all earlier I think I'm just a perfectionist (or maybe fussy would be a better word).\n\nTeresa, I wasn't trying to say British films are better than America films by any means, besides Neverwhere was a BBC thing. I just used 'Hollywood' where I guess I should have said 'the film industry'. I meant it very generally"
