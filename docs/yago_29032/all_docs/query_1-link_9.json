        "text": "Gothic films are described as films that draw from the Gothic tradition in literature. This means that they have dark and sometimes supernatural elements like the Gothic novels of the 18th and 19th centuries such as Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818) and Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897). The tragic theme of forlorn love is re-current in Gothic literature and film. Here I will focus on contemporary Gothic films. Many Gothic artists, musicians and film directors are Surrealists and rely on their subsonscious to produce their art. A lot of people seem to think that Goths like horror movies...as for myself I despise gore but do love all things dark. I think that there is a big difference between things that are dark and things that are evil.\n\nThe following film stars have been related to the Goth scene either because of the films they choose to star in, their fashion sense, their art or the people they associate themselves with:\n\nMarilyn Manson\n\nStarred in Party Monster, The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things, Rise, Lost Highway, Jawbreaker. Dated Rose Mcgowan, Dita Von Teese and Evan Rachel Wood.\n\nAngelina Jolie\n\nIn Angelina's first marriage to Jonny Lee Miller she wore black leather pants and a white top with his name scrawled on the back in Jolie's own blood. In an interview with the Boston Globe, Jolie explains why she and Thornton wear vials of each other's blood around their necks. \"Some people think a big diamond is really pretty,\" she says. \"My husband's blood is the most beautiful thing in the world to me.\" The couple also sign their wills in blood the same year, and for a first-anniversary present, Jolie buys Thornton his-and-hers cemetery plots in his native Louisiana. People magazine once noted in a fun facts section of the magazine that as a child, Angelina Jolie wanted to be an undertaker and studied embalming.\n\nChristina Ricci\n\nStarred in Addams Family Values, Sleepy Hollow, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Casper, Penelope, Pumpkin and Mermaids.\n\nEvan Rachel Wood\n\nStarred in Running with Scissors, True Blood and Thirteen.

Her very innovative, but also very disturbing video works, located in sceneries she once described as \"entropic underworlds inhabited by tortured souls and omnipotent beings\", attracted a number of very prominent musicians. Her films incorporate images derived from hallucinary dream-states. Apart from her art exhibitions, she is best known for writing and directing The Runaways, starring Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning. Sigismondi has also directed music videos for Marilyn Manson, David Bowie, BjÃ¶rk, The Cure, Christina Aguilera, The White Stripes, Sigur RÃ³s, Muse, Interpol, Incubus, and commercials for Old Navy, MAC, Adidas and Eaton's. Her trademark dilating, jittery camerawork, noticeable as early as her video for Manson's The Beautiful People, has been replicated by a great number of directors since. Her parents were opera singers. Floria's videos that she directed for Marilyn Manson inspired scenes in the movie The Cell.\n\nFloria Sigismondi's Offical Website\n\nFloria Sigismondi on Wikipedia\n\nTarsem Singh\n\nAn Indian born film director, producer and screenwriter.
