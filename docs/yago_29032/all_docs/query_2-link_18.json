While most kids long to run away and join the circus, Helena dreams of running away to the real world.\n\nUntil the day she wakes up to find herself in a strange new place populated by mysterious creatures -- a dreamworld where she is about to embark on a most amazing journey.\n\nAugmented by notes and observations by bestselling author Neil Gaiman, and lushly illustrated by the film's director (and renowned artist) Dave McKean (including all of the more than 1700 story boards created for the film), MIRRORMASK is a funny, scary, magical fantasy for readers of all ages.\n\nTo check out Mirrormask\n\naction figures and more,\n\nvisit Dark Horse Comics.\n\nClick below to view movie trailers for MirrorMask:\n\nWindows Media (high bandwidth)\n\nWindows Media (low bandwidth)\n\nReal Player (high bandwidth)\n\nReal Player (low bandwidth)\n\nBonus Content"
