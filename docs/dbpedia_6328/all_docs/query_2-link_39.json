        "text": "I vaguely remember the fall of the Soviet Union. I at least remember the headlines in 1991, and having a fuzzy idea that something important was happening. Unfortunately, those memories tend to blend with my even fuzzier 1989 memories of the fall of the Berlin wall. I know I found out about one of them while sitting in the study of my grandparents’ house before bedtime.\n\nPeople were happy that the Cold War was finally over and the free world was just a little bit freer. Personally, I don’t buy that Russia’s government has become significantly less powerful, as opponents are frequently silenced and the country is run by a former head of the KGB. But culturally, it was definitely a step forward. I can say this definitely because it is 1967 and I am just today reviewing the Soviet Union’s first horror film.\n\nI’ve read articles that claim that Viy (pronounced “vee” in the film) is actually the ONLY Soviet horror, but that claim doesn’t stand up to analysis. It is absolutely true that it is a sparse category, and the next twenty years would produce only a fraction of what the United States would produce in a single year. The Soviet government heavily restricted what films were available to the public. They wanted their citizens to be complacent, which is why they got comedies, colorful fantasy films, and war movies that showed the might of the Red Army. The highest grossing Soviet film in 1967 was a comedy with the horrific title Kidnapping, Caucasian Style, a humorous take on bride kidnapping, which is even more appalling than it sounds. Incidentally, that movie got a 2014 remake, which has a 1.1 rating on IMDB.\n\nI don’t have much experience with Soviet film, and much of what I’ve seen counts as fantasy: sprawling epics with fantastic spectacle, with stories I can barely follow. Viy continues this tradition, keeping the whimsy and the cinematic tricks, but muting the color scheme markedly. It’s very brown and grey. Viy is based on a story by Nikolai Gogol and follows seminary student Khoma Brutus on an ill-fated break from normal classes. When they stumble across a farm in the country, Khoma quickly learns that their withered old hostess is a witch. When he finally gets the upper hand on her, he beats her with a stick and the hag turns into a beautiful young woman. Naturally, Khoma flees.\n\nKhoma returns to the seminary but is soon approached by the Rector. Apparently the daughter of a wealthy merchant is dying, and asked for Khoma by name. Once he gets to the chapel where her body lies, he discovers that the now dead daughter is the witch. But Khoma can’t say anything about it to anyone, because he would also have to reveal that he was responsible for her death, and so he is told to stay up three nights with her corpse, praying for her soul."
