        "text": "There's no character that has quite captured the nation's hearts like Bridget Jones. Whether you love her or hate her (or find her views around weight and men a little outdated) there's no denying she's one of pop culture's most famous figures – making the fourth Bridget Jones film a serious talking point when it comes to reboots.\n\nRenée Zellweger is set to reprise her Oscar-nominated role as Bridget in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, a sequel from Universal Pictures and Working Title that's being co-financed by Miramax and directed by Michael Morris (To Leslie, Better Call Saul).\n\nBridget is one of Britain's best-loved characters\n\nBut what will the film be about? Bridget may be back, but will her old love interest, Daniel Cleaver, be returning too? Has she finally found her happily ever after? Here's everything we know so far.\n\nWhat will Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy be about?\n\nThe film will be based on the , in which Bridget is in her fifties, a mother to two children and widowed following the death of Mark Darcy. Fielding previously said that she wrote Darcy out of the series because she didn't want Bridget to become \"a smug married\" – a fate which, as viewers of the first film will remember, Bridget herself deemed utterly terrible.\n\nThe production studio hasn't commented on how closely the new film will follow the storyline of the book, but a source has recently hinted that it will follow Bridget as a single mum, trying to navigate a new world of social media and dating apps after Mark Darcy's death.\n\n\"Bridget is going to be a real cougar in the new film and she'll be seen starting a relationship with a much younger character [played by Leo Woodall],\" said the source. \"Hugh Grant is back as Daniel Cleaver, so there will be a love triangle between Bridget's older flame and this much younger new man.\"\n\nHugh Grant has confirmed he'll be returning as Daniel Cleaver\n\nIn a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), production company Working Title confirmed that filming had wrapped on the hotly anticipated sequel.\n\nSharing a picture of the a director's chair that had been labelled 'Bridget Jones', the post confirmed the film's release date as Valentine's Day 2025.\n\nWho is starring in it?\n\nOf course, Zellweger is taking on the leading role, and Hugh Grant – who plays the dashing but dastardly Daniel Cleaver, and did not appear in the third film – has confirmed he is returning, too. Could there be a reunion between the pair on the cards?\n\nEmma Thompson, who debuted her character of Bridget's despairing obstetrician in Bridget Jones's Baby, is also set for a return.\n\nNew faces on the cast list include Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years A Slave) and Leo Woodall, who has recently one plaudits for One Day, who will play Bridget's younger love interest as she navigates the world of dating once again.\n\nThere's certainly plenty to get excited about – and we'll be updating this story when we know more..."
