        "text": "One bit of housekeeping about this review first: technically this is a “Soviet” film, even though Nikolai Gogol, who wrote the original story, was from Kiev and set this story there. I’m instead going to give credit where it’s deserved – Slava Ukrani.\n\nThis isn’t actually about politics or national policy anyway – rather, it’s a surprisingly fun ghost story. Khoma (Leonid Kuravlyov) and his two friends are travelers from a seminary near Kiev, heading home during their Spring Break. They’re on foot, so it’s slow going and come nightfall they are forced to ask for shelter from an old woman out in the countryside. She agrees, but insists that the three all sleep in separate places – one in the house, one in another outbuilding, and Khoma in the barn with the cows (which is only fair, since Khoma was a bit of a jerk to her). Khoma starts bedding down when the old woman suddenly joins him, staring at him meaningfully.\n\nKhoma thinks it’s a sexual come-on and tries to fend her off – but suddenly she jumps on him piggy-back and starts whipping him like a horse. And just as suddenly, Khoma is compelled to start running – faster than he is capable. Then he starts flying, the woman still on his back. Realizing she’s a witch, Khoma curses her and compels her to land – and then beats her when she does, stopping only when she magically turns into a beautiful young woman (Natalya Varley) and begs him to stop. That’s enough for Khoma – he runs all the way back to the seminary, abandoning his two friends.\n\nHowever, when Khoma gets there, the Rector of the seminary wants to see him – a rich merchant nearby has a gravely ill daughter who’s asked if someone could read prayers by her bedside. In fact, she specifically asked for Khoma himself. Khoma is thus whisked right back to the same farm, this time a bustling farmstead with a number of workers – but it’s too late, she’s just died. Her grieving father mentions that his daughter’s dying wish was for Khoma to read prayers over her corpse for three straight nights while she lies in state. Khoma glances at said corpse – and sees it’s the young woman. But there’s nothing for it – Khoma is locked up in the church that night, his lectern sitting right bang next to the coffin. And as he starts to read – her eyes open…\n\nSo this is a fun ghost story, basically. The special effects were pretty damn good for 1967, but for someone used to CGI they were a little creaky – but that helped. There’s a homespun feel to them that keeps the film from feeling too creepy. The recently-coined slang term “spoopy” feels apt; it’s trying to be scary, but for me it ended up charming. The creepiest effect was probably the appearance of the title character – a lumpy, vaguely humanoid demon with enormous eyes and even bigger eyelids, ones so big that Viy has to ask his companions to manually lift them up for him. It’s not quite as terrifying as Gogol’s depiction – an iron face, body covered in dirt, hands and legs looking like tree roots, and five-foot-long eyelids drooping down to the floor – but it’s as creepy as you could get at the time.\n\nThis feels right for a tweens’ Halloween party, strangely; just creepy enough, but with some hokiness to keep the more sensitive kids from getting too wound up."
