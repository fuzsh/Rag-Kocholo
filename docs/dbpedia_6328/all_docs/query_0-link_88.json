Retail price: 8 Kop.\n\nLithuanian film and stage actor Regimantas Adomaitis (1937) passed away on 20 June 2022. He was particularly active in Soviet and East German cinema, for example in Korol Lir/King Lear (1970) and Jeto sladkoje slovo - svoboda!//That Sweet Word: Liberty! (1972).\n\nRegimantas Vaiksutovitch Adomaitis was born in Šiauliai, Lithuania in 1937. He graduated from the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics at Vilnius University. Later he studied acting at the acting department of the Vilnius Conservatory. He made a debut in the theatre and had engagements in Vilnius, Kaunas and Kapsukas. His film debut was Vienos dienos kronika/The Chronicle of one Day (Vytautas Zalakevicius, 1963) with Donatas Banionis. In 1966 he had his breakthrough with Niekas nenorėjo mirti/Nobody Wanted to Die (Vytautas Žalakevičius,1966). This action drama is set in a small Lithuanian farming community after the Second World War. The village is divided as the communists battle those in favour of national independence. When the leader of the community is killed, the man's four sons, including Adomaitis, set out to avenge his death. Adomaitis, director Žalakevičius. and cinematographer Jonas Gricius were awarded the USSR State Prize for the film in 1967. That year, he also acted in the a-typical Soviet war film Vostochny koridor/Eastern Corridor (Valentin Vinogradov, 1966) with Lyudmila Abramova. In the historical drama Sergey Lazo (Aleksandr Gordon, 1968), he played the title role of the Communist leader Lazo. He appeared as Edmund in the Soviet Shakespeare adaptation Korol Lir/King Lear (Grigori Kozintsev, Iosif Shapiro, 1971), starring Juri Jarvet. The Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich composed the score. Jugu Abraham at IMDb: “Kozintsev is one of least sung masters of Russian cinema. His cinema is very close to that of Tarkovsky and Sergei Paradjanov. Kozintsev's Lear is not a Lear that mourns his past and his daughters--his Lear is close to the soil, the plants, and all elements of nature. That's what makes Kozintsev's Shakespearean works outstanding.” In 1973, Adomaitis appeared in the Soviet drama Eto sladkoe slovo - svoboda!/That Sweet Word: Liberty! (Vytautas Žalakevičius, 1973). The film was shot in Chile shortly before the 1973 Chilean coup d'état. The basis for the plot is a real story: the escape from San Carlos prison in Venezuela of three political prisoners. The film was entered into the 8th Moscow International Film Festival where it won the Golden Prize. Velnio nuotaka/Devil's Bride (Arūnas Žebriūnas, 1974) is the first Lithuanian musical about the victory of love over the trickery of the Devil based on the book Baltaragio malūnas (Whitehorn Mill) by Kazys Boruta. Due to its popularity, it is sometimes called a Lithuanian Jesus Christ Superstar rock opera.\n\nIn East-Germany, Regimantas Adomaitis starred in Wolz - Leben und Verklärung eines deutschen Anarchisten/ Wolz - Life and Illusion of a German Anarchist (Günter Reisch, 1974) with Heidemarie Wenzel. Tom Dooley at IMDb: “Part comedy at one point, part political statement and a definite swipe at National Socialism, it is very ambitious and it pulls it all off. It has a great musical score too and the music adds to the moods tenfold. The acting is superb and Regimantas Adomaitis as Wolz is a powerhouse.” For the DEFA, he also starred in Mann gegen Mann/Man Against Man (Kurt Maetzig, 1976). In the historical drama Yuliya Vrevskaya/Between the Tsar’s Court and the Battlefield (Nikola Korabov, 1978), Adomaitas played opposite Lyudmila Saveleva and Stefan Danailov. Other films were the Maxim Gorky adaptation Vrag/Enemies (Rodion Nahapetov, 1978) with Innokentiy Smoktunovskiy, the Soviet-Italian drama La vita è bella/Life Is Beautiful (Grigoriy Chukhray, 1979) with Giancarlo Giannini and Ornella Muti, and Poloska neskoshennych dikikh tsvetov/ A strip of unclosed wildflowers (Yuri Ilyenko, 1980). He returned to East-Germany for the drama Die Verlobte/The Fiancee (Günter Reisch, Günther Rücker1980) with Jutta Wachowiak as a woman sentenced in 1934 to ten years in prison for antifascist activities. The love between her and her fiancee enables her to survive it. He co-starred with Donatas Banionis in the Soviet Lithuanian-language war film Gruppa krovi nol/Faktas/Facts (Almantas Grikevicius, 1981).

He was once described as the Michelangelo of the circus and was at one time the best-known clown in the world. He appeared in a few films.\n\nOleg Konstantinovich Popov was born in 1930 in Vyrubovo, Russia, the son of a clock repairman. At age 12, he began working as an apprentice typographer for the newspaper Pravda, and he later joined the Pravda's Athletic Club. There, in 1945, someone suggested that he apply for Moscow's State College of Circus and Variety Arts. He was accepted and studied acrobatics, juggling, and other circus skills there, graduating in 1949. At 19, he made his debut as a juggler and slack-wire artist at the Tbilisi Circus in the Georgian SSR. Afterward, he continued his career at the Moscow Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard (today Circus Nikulin). The circus was a vital part of life in the Soviet Union where, typically every year, more than 70 million citizens would attend one or more shows put on by more than 100 troupes. Popov's comic abilities were spotted just after the Second World War.\n\nIn 1955, Oleg Popov performed abroad for the first time, in Warsaw, and the following year, he toured with the Moscow Circus in France, Belgium, and England, and was immediately noticed by the press, which made him a circus star. The Soviet regime would quickly build on his success abroad and transform Oleg Popov into a goodwill ambassador for the Soviet Union. He appeared in 1958 at the Brussels World Fair, and in 1957, he was broadcast from Moscow on American television. He toured the United States in 1963 and 1972 with the Moscow Circus. In 1969, Oleg Popov was honored with the title of People's Artist of the USSR. He toured extensively around the world in subsequent years with the Moscow Circus. In Australia, he was named King of Moomba (1971).\n\nPopov appeared in a few films, including Арена Смелых/Ring of the Braves ( Sergei Gurov, Yuriy Ozerov, 1953), the Bulgarian film Ritzar bez bronya/Knight Without Armour (Borislav Sharaliev, 1966) and Ma-ma/Mummy ( Elisabeta Bostan, 1977). He also appeared as a clown in the American-Russian coproduction The Blue Bird (George Cukor, 1976), starring Elizabeth Taylor, Jane Fonda, and Ava Gardner. It was a huge flop. In the early 1990s, at the fall of the Soviet Union, Oleg Popov began touring for a few years with a unit of the Moscow Circus in Germany, where he eventually resettled. He later performed extensively in Germany, in circus shows, on television, or with his own touring show. He married Gabriela Lehmann, a German circus performer, in 1991, she was 32 years younger than her husband. He was previously married to Alexandra. In 2006, Popov was invited to perform at the 30th anniversary of the International Circus Festival of Monte Carlo. Aged 75 years of age, he received a standing ovation. In 2015, he returned for the first time to Russia after 28 years of living in Germany. Popov died on 2 November 2016, from a cardiac arrest while on tour, at a hotel in Rostov-on-Don at the age of 86.\n\nSources: Wikipedia and IMDb.\n\nAnd, please check out our blog European Film Star Postcards.\n\nRussian postcard in the 'Animals at the circus' series by Planeta Publishers, Moscow, no. 7, 1975.

At 19, he made his debut as a juggler and slack-wire artist at the Tbilisi Circus in the Georgian SSR. Afterward, he continued his career at the Moscow Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard (today Circus Nikulin). The circus was a vital part of life in the Soviet Union where, typically every year, more than 70 million citizens would attend one or more shows put on by more than 100 troupes. Popov's comic abilities were spotted just after the Second World War.\n\nIn 1955, Oleg Popov performed abroad for the first time, in Warsaw, and the following year, he toured with the Moscow Circus in France, Belgium, and England, and was immediately noticed by the press, which made him a circus star. The Soviet regime would quickly build on his success abroad and transform Oleg Popov into a goodwill ambassador for the Soviet Union. He appeared in 1958 at the Brussels World Fair, and in 1957, he was broadcast from Moscow on American television. He toured the United States in 1963 and 1972 with the Moscow Circus. In 1969, Oleg Popov was honored with the title of People's Artist of the USSR. He toured extensively around the world in subsequent years with the Moscow Circus. In Australia, he was named King of Moomba (1971).\n\nPopov appeared in a few films, including Арена Смелых/Ring of the Braves ( Sergei Gurov, Yuriy Ozerov, 1953), the Bulgarian film Ritzar bez bronya/Knight Without Armour (Borislav Sharaliev, 1966) and Ma-ma/Mummy ( Elisabeta Bostan, 1977). He also appeared as a clown in the American-Russian coproduction The Blue Bird (George Cukor, 1976), starring Elizabeth Taylor, Jane Fonda, and Ava Gardner. It was a huge flop. In the early 1990s, at the fall of the Soviet Union, Oleg Popov began touring for a few years with a unit of the Moscow Circus in Germany, where he eventually resettled. He later performed extensively in Germany, in circus shows, on television, or with his own touring show. He married Gabriela Lehmann, a German circus performer, in 1991, she was 32 years younger than her husband. He was previously married to Alexandra. In 2006, Popov was invited to perform at the 30th anniversary of the International Circus Festival of Monte Carlo. Aged 75 years of age, he received a standing ovation. In 2015, he returned for the first time to Russia after 28 years of living in Germany. Popov died on 2 November 2016, from a cardiac arrest while on tour, at a hotel in Rostov-on-Don at the age of 86.\n\nSources: Wikipedia and IMDb.\n\nAnd, please check out our blog European Film Star Postcards.\n\nSoviet postcard by Izdanije Byuro Propogandy Sovietskogo Kinoiskusstva.

Vladimir Korenev in Mnogo shuma iz nichego/Much Ado About Nothing (Samson Samsonov, 1973).\n\nYesterday, 2 January 2021, Russian film and theatre actor Vladimir Korenev (1940) passed away. In 1961 he entered the troupe of the Moscow Drama Theater, where he later was a teacher. The handsome Korenev became a sex symbol in the Soviet Union when he played the lead role of Ichthyander in the film Chelovek-Amfibiya/The Amphibian Man (1962). Korenev was awarded People's Artist of Russia (1998). The 80-year-old Korenev died of complications from COVID-19.\n\nVladimir Borisovich Korenev (Russian: Влади́мир Бори́сович Ко́ренев) was born in 1940 – in Sevastopol, in the family of Rear Admiral Boris Leonidovich Korenev. He lived in Izmail until his family moved to Tallinn, where he became interested in literature and theatre. Classmate Larisa Luzhina led Vladimir to the drama club, directed by Ivan Danilovich Rossomahin. The circle also engaged Vitali Konyayev, Igor Yasulovich, and Lillian Malkina. In 1957 he enrolled in GITIS in the studio of Gregory Konskiy and Olga Androvskaya. In 1961 Mikhail Yanshin, leader of the Stanislavsky Electrotheatre (Moscow Drama Theatre) invited him to join the troupe of the theatre. Korenev became famous when he played the lead role of Ichthyander opposite Anastasiya Vertinskaya in the Science-Fiction romance Chelovek-Amfibiya/The Amphibian Man (Vladimir Chebotaryov, Gennadi Kazansky, 1961). The film sold up to 100 million admissions and the handsome Korenev became known as a sex symbol in the Soviet Union. He also appeared in such films as the romance Svet dalyokoy zvezdy/The Light of a Distant Star (Ivan Pyrev, 1965), the comedy Deti Don-Kikhota/Children of Don Quixote (Yevgeny Karelovm 1966) and the war film Osvobozhdenie/Liberation (Yuri Ozerov, 1970). He also played in the romantic comedy Mnogo shuma iz nichego/Much Ado About Nothing (Samson Samsonov, 1973) based on William Shakespeare's play of the same name.\n\nIn the 1980s, he continued to appear in the theatre and cinema, but also on television. In 1988 he appeared in the two-part television crime drama Kriminalnyy talant/Сriminal Talent (Sergey Ashkenazi, 1988), a screen version of the same story by Stanislav Rodionov. His later films include Dinozavry XX veka/Dinosaurs of 20th Century (Khabib Faiziyev, 1990), and the war drama Neizvestnye stranitsy iz zhizni razvedchika (Vladimir Chebotaryov, 1991). He also had a role in the 16-part television series Deti Arbata/Children of the Arbat (Julia Damsker, Valentin Chernykh, 2004), based on the 'Children of the Arbat' trilogy by Anatoly Rybakov. By 2015 Korenev had become the artistic director of the Faculty of Theatre Arts Abbot. In 2020 Vladimir Korenev was diagnosed positive with COVID-19. He died of complications from COVID-19 on 2 January 2021 in Moscow. Since 1961, he was married to actress Aleftina Konstantinova. Their daughter, Irina Koreneva, followed her father in his footsteps, and she joined the troupe of the Stanislavsky Electrotheatre in 1992. Irina's son had a son Egor Korenev, who, with his wife Darya, has a daughter, Mariya (2017). Vladimir Korenev's last screen appearance as a king in the film Bezumnyy angel Pinokkio/The Crazy Angel Pinocchio (Boris Yukhananov, 2021) will be premiered posthumously.\n\nSources: Wikipedia and IMDb.\n\nAnd, please check out our blog European Film Star Postcards.\n\nRussian postcard by Izdanije Byuro Propogandy Sovietskogo Kinoiskusstva, nr. A 11239, 1966. Photo: G. Vajlja. (This postcard was printed in an edition of 100,000 cards. The price was 8 kop.)\n\nCharming Russian actress Lyudmila Savelyeva (1942) is internationally best known for her leading role in the grand epic Voyna i mir/War and Peace (1965-1967, Sergei Bondarchuk), based on the classic novel by Leo Tolstoy.\n\nLyudmila Savelyeva was born as Lyudmila Mikhailovna Savelyeva in Leningrad, Soviet Union (now St. Petersburg, Russia). She studied ballet at the Ballet Academy of Leningrad and worked for the Leningrad Opera en Ballet Theater, now the Mariinski Theater. In 1964 the ballet Sleeping Beauty in which she performed was adapted to film. Spyashchaya krasavitsa/Sleeping Beauty (1964, Apollinari Dudko, Konstantin Sergeyev) was seen by director Sergei Bondarchuk, who invited her for the leading part in his next film, Voyna i mir/War and Peace (1965-1967). The inexperienced Savelyeva played Natasha Rostova opposite the director himself as Pierre Bezukhov. The 7-hour-long film epic won the 1968 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and brought Bondarchuk a reputation of one of the finest directors of his generation. Recognized as the most expensive project in film history, Voyna i mir was produced over seven years, at an estimated cost of $100,000,000 (over $700,000,000 adjusted for inflation in 2008). The film set several records, such as involving tens of thousands of actors and extras from the Red Army in filming of the 3rd two-hour-long episode about the historic Battle of Borodino against the Napoleon's invasion, making it the largest battle scene ever filmed.\n\nIn her next film, Chayka/The Seagull (1970, Yuli Karasik) Lyudmila Savelyeva proved to be one of the best actresses at interpreting Anton Chekhov's work. According to reviewer James Brandon on IMDb she \"squeezes out more pathos and passion than many actresses encounter in a lifetime. The payoff is near the end of the film; with her character Nina returning to visit her former lover after a two-year absence. Even without the context of the rest of the story, this is an arresting scene, as the actress in her late 20's [actually she was only 23 or 24 at the time, Bob] reads as though she has seen as much suffering as Mother Russia itself has experienced throughout her long history. Within the context of the story, Savelyeva's change is so magically and maddeningly profound that it should bring tears to the eye of even the most jaded film-goer.”\n\nAnother triumph for Lyudmila Savelyeva soon followed with Beg/The Flight (1970, Aleksandr Alov, Vladimir Naumov), an adaptation of the play by Mikhail Bulgakov, about the defeat of the White Army in the Russian Civil War of 1918-1921, that caused massive emigration of the upper classes and nobility. Next she appeared opposite Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni in the Oscar nominated drama I Girasoli/Sunflower (1970, Vittorio de Sica). In the following decades Lyudmila Savelyeva went on to star in several Russian films, but to less acclaim. Recently she played supporting parts in films by director Sergei Solovyov, including Nezhnyy vozrast /The Gentle Age (2000) and the tv series Anna Karenina (2009), based again on a famous novel by Leo Tolstoy. Lyudmila Savelyeva was married to actor Aleksandr Zbruyev, and has one child with him.\n\nSources: IMDb and Melofanas.lt.\n\nRussian postcard in the 'Animals at the circus' series by Planeta Publishers, Moscow, no. 15, 1975.

She is the sister of film star Anastasiya Vertinskaya.\n\nMarianna Aleksandrovna Vertinskaya was in 1943, on a train going to Shanghai, China, which was home to a large Russian colony at the time. Her father, Aleksandr Vertinskiy was a legendary White Russian émigré, who was a popular actor, singer and songwriter. Her mother, Lidiya Vertinskaya (née Lidia Vladimirovna Tsirgvava), was also a Russian émigré who was born into a Georgian-Russian family in Kharbin. Her mother gave her the in Russia unusual name Marianna after the beloved of Robin Hood. Lidiya simply loved the American film The Adventures of Robin Hood (Michael Curtiz, 1938), with Errol Flynn as the legendary robber. In order to support his family in Shanghai, Aleksandr Vertinskiy had to give two concerts a day during the first years. They decided to return to Moscow, where a second daughter, Anastasiya Vertinskaya, was born in 1944. Marianna and Anastasiya had a happy childhood in Russia. They were brought up in a multi-lingual family where they enjoyed an intellectually stimulating environment, and a highly cultural atmosphere of their parents circle. Marianna was fond of her father, who invested much of his talent and energy in his daughter's education. Her famous father died when Marianna was 15, and she suffered from an emotional trauma. From 1962 till 1966 she studied acting under A. Borisov at the Shchukin Theatrical School of the Vakhtangov Theatre in Moscow, graduating in 1966, as an actress. Since 1966 she has been a member of the Vakhtangov Theatre in Moscow. Marianna Vertinskaya shone in the title role in the legendary 1963 re-creation of Vakhtangov's production of Carlo Gozzi's comedy 'Princess Turandot'. She also made memorable appearances in Dostoevsky's 'Idiot', in Moliere's 'Meshchanin vo dvoryansyve', and in other plays at the Vakhtangov Theatre in Moscow.\n\nMarianna Vertinskaya made her film debut with a small part in the crime drama Visokosnyy god/ Leap Year (Anatoli Efros, 1962). She played a supporting part in the coming of age drama Mne dvadtsat let/I Am Twenty (Marlen Khutsiev, 1965). The film is now seen as the Russian answer to the Nouvelle Vague in France. At the time, the film invoked Soviet premier Nikita Khruschev's sharp criticism. At the censor's insistence the film was re-cut. Mne dvadtsat let follows Sergei (Valentin Popov), his two best friends, Nikolai and Slava, and his eventual love interest, Anya (Vertinskaya), and juxtaposes their aspirations against the harsh realities of everyday life in the Soviet Union in 1960. The following year, Marianna played the female leads in two films. She starred opposite Nikita Mikhalkov and Oleg Strizhenov in the drama Pereklichka/Roll-Call (Daniil Khrabrovitsky, 1966). The second film was the family adventure Gorod masterov/The City of Masters (Vladimir Bychkov, 1966). Elaine Freeland at IMDb: “Although far removed from Tamara Gabbe's original theater play of the same name, Gorod Masterov is an excellent work in its own right. A good example of the so-called \"po motivam\" Soviet adaptation policy which allowed filmmakers unlimited freedom when it came to changing the plot, characters and even the idea of the original story, Gorod Masterov used that freedom only to emphasize the main points of Gabbe's tale. That turned a meticulously researched, beautifully worded historical play inspired by the events of the famous Marseille rebellion into a never-never-landish children's fantasy movie.” She also co-starred with Oleg Strizhenov in the Sci-Fi comedy Ego zvali Robert/We Called Him Robert (Ilya Olshvanger, 1967), and was one of the brides in the comedy Sem nevest efreytora Zbrueva/The Seven Brides of Lance-Corporal Zbruyev (Vitaliy Melnikov, 1971). She had the leading role in Nave zem buras (Ada Neretniece, 1976). Later films include Dialog s prodolzheniyem (Gennadi Karyuk, Aleksandr Lapshin, 1980), Zhenshchina v more/The Woman in the Sea (Vyacheslav Krishtofovich, 1992) and her most recent film, Vlyublyonnye 2 (Elyer Ishmukhamedov, 2004). Vertinskaya was designated Honorable Actress of Russia. She has been married three times: to architect Ilya Bylinkin (1967-1973), to actor Boris Khmelnitskiy (1976-1980) and to businessman Zoran Kazimirovic (1983-1996). She has two daughters: presenter Aleksandra Bylinkina (1970) with Ilya Bylinkin, and designer Darya Khmelnitskaya (1978) with Boris Khmelnitskiy.

In 1961 he entered the troupe of the Moscow Drama Theater, where he later was a teacher. The handsome Korenev became a sex symbol in the Soviet Union when he played the lead role of Ichthyander in the film Chelovek-Amfibiya/The Amphibian Man (1962). Korenev was awarded People's Artist of Russia (1998). The 80-year-old Korenev died of complications from COVID-19.\n\nVladimir Borisovich Korenev (Russian: Влади́мир Бори́сович Ко́ренев) was born in 1940 – in Sevastopol, in the family of Rear Admiral Boris Leonidovich Korenev. He lived in Izmail until his family moved to Tallinn, where he became interested in literature and theatre. Classmate Larisa Luzhina led Vladimir to the drama club, directed by Ivan Danilovich Rossomahin. The circle also engaged Vitali Konyayev, Igor Yasulovich, and Lillian Malkina. In 1957 he enrolled in GITIS in the studio of Gregory Konskiy and Olga Androvskaya. In 1961 Mikhail Yanshin, leader of the Stanislavsky Electrotheatre (Moscow Drama Theatre) invited him to join the troupe of the theatre. Korenev became famous when he played the lead role of Ichthyander opposite Anastasiya Vertinskaya in the Science-Fiction romance Chelovek-Amfibiya/The Amphibian Man (Vladimir Chebotaryov, Gennadi Kazansky, 1961). The film sold up to 100 million admissions and the handsome Korenev became known as a sex symbol in the Soviet Union. He also appeared in such films as the romance Svet dalyokoy zvezdy/The Light of a Distant Star (Ivan Pyrev, 1965), the comedy Deti Don-Kikhota/Children of Don Quixote (Yevgeny Karelovm 1966) and the war film Osvobozhdenie/Liberation (Yuri Ozerov, 1970). He also played in the romantic comedy Mnogo shuma iz nichego/Much Ado About Nothing (Samson Samsonov, 1973) based on William Shakespeare's play of the same name.\n\nIn the 1980s, he continued to appear in the theatre and cinema, but also on television. In 1988 he appeared in the two-part television crime drama Kriminalnyy talant/Сriminal Talent (Sergey Ashkenazi, 1988), a screen version of the same story by Stanislav Rodionov. His later films include Dinozavry XX veka/Dinosaurs of 20th Century (Khabib Faiziyev, 1990), and the war drama Neizvestnye stranitsy iz zhizni razvedchika (Vladimir Chebotaryov, 1991).

(This postcard was printed in an edition of 200.000 cards. The price was 6 kop.).\n\nAcclaimed Russian actor Oleg Yankovsky (1944-2009) excelled in psychologically sophisticated roles of modern intellectuals. He is best known in the west for his parts in two of Andrei Tarkovsky's most haunting and poetic films: Zerkalo/The Mirror (as the father) and Nostalghia (in the main role). In 1991, he became the last person to be named a People's Artist of the USSR.\n\nOleg Ivanovich Yankovsky (Russian: Олег Иванович Янковский) was born in the village Jezkazgan, Kazakh SSR, USSR (now Jezkazgan, Kazakhstan) in 1944. He was born into a noble family of Polish origin. His father, a former tsarist army officer who joined the Red Army, was exiled and later died in a Gulag labour camp during Josef Stalin's crackdown on Trotskyites in the military. After Stalin's death in 1953, the family settled in Saratov, in southern Russia. In 1957 Oleg's older brother Rostislav, an actor, went to Minsk. Back in Saratov, Oleg intended to become a dentist but a casual visit to the Slonov Theater Academy, the local drama school where his brother had studied changed his mind. After marrying fellow student Ludmilla Zorina, he graduated in 1965 with an appearance in The Three Sisters before joining the Saratov Drama Theatre. A year later, aged 22, he appeared in his first film, O lyubvi/A Ballad of Love (1966, Mikhail Bogin), and immediately impressed with his aristocratic bearing and handsome features. His film career was launched, when he was cast in two films about World War II, Shchit i mech/The Shield and the Sword (1968, Vladimir Basov) in which he played an arrogant German officer, and Sluzhili dva tovarishcha/Two Comrades Were Serving (1968, Yevgeni Karelov). About the latter, Ronald Bergan wrote in his obituary in The Guardian: “Yankovsky played a student who joins the Red Army during the civil war, fighting for the revolution not only with his gun, but with his camera. The performance demonstrated Yankovsky's skill in playing heroic roles with a certain irony, without resorting to the larger-than-life mannerisms in Soviet cinema of the 1950’s. However, despite the ‘Thaw’ period following Khrushchev's famous speech in 1956 attacking Stalin's ‘cult of personality’, a new era of repression had set in by the time Yankovsky made his screen debut.”\n\nIn the west we have little idea of how much Oleg Yankovsky was revered in his own country, in both Soviet and post-Soviet times, equally on stage and in films. In 1973, he joined Mark Zakharov's Lenin Komsomol Theatre in Moscow, and became one of its leading actors. He starred in the TV versions of such Lenkom productions as Obyknovennoye chudo/An Ordinary Miracle (1978, Mark Zakharov) and Tot Samyy Myunkhgauzen/The Very Same Munchhausen (1979, Mark Zakharov). Despite the mediocrity of the majority of the films he appeared in during the stagnant Brezhnev years, he managed to humanise historical figures by expressing certain deep emotions, lifting his portrayals of Communist Party leaders above the popular film stereotypes. In 1974, he played a Communist Party official in Premiya/The Bonus (1974, Sergei Mikaelyan), a film that generated international attention for its frank examination of mismanagement and fraud in the Soviet construction industry. In the west we know Oleg Yankovsky only from a handful of films. He was cast to play the father in Tarkovsky's intensely personal dreamlike and somewhat hermetic Zerkalo/The Mirror (1975, Andrei Tarkovsky). Philip Riley in his obituary of Yankovsky in The British paper The Independent writes: “ a multi-layered oneiric autobiography, Yankovsky played a loose depiction of the hero's father, the poet Arseny Tarkovsky, whose verses are heard on the soundtrack. The complex layering included casting various members of Tarkovsky's family and, as one of the children, Yankovsky's son Philip.” It was the first of his films to be shown widely in the west. But he had to wait another eight years, for the main role in Tarkovsky's Nostalghia/Nostalgia (1983, Andrei Tarkovsky), before he was internationally recognised again. Ronald Bergan : “Thankfully, This time he played the lead role – a Russian poet and musicologist doing research at a spa in the Tuscan hills. As an obscure act of faith, Yankovsky crosses an ancient sulphur pool from one side to the other carrying a lighted candle. With his lean, ascetic face and dark eyes, he was ideal as a man in extremis, through whom Tarkovsky, in his first film made outside the Soviet Union, expressed his melancholy and homesickness”. Other of his internationally known films are Moy laskovyy i nezhnyy zver/The Shooting Party (1978, Emil Loteanu), based on the Anton Chekhov story, where he was superb as Kamyshev, an intellectual crushed by the pettiness and false morality of a small provincial town; Polyoty vo sne i nayavu/ Flights in Dreams and Reality (1982, Roman Balayan), electrifying as a complacent adulterer painfully forced to reassess his life; Vlyublyon po sobstvennomu zhelaniyu/Love at His Own Choice (1983, Sergei Mikaelyan), as a former champion bicyclist who is rescued from his drunken ways by a plain-looking librarian; Kreytserova sonata/The Kreutzer Sonata (1987, Sofiya Milkina, Mikhail Shvejtser), adapted from Leo Tolstoy, where his portrayal of jealousy erupting into hate is a tour de force; and Pasport/The Passport (1991, Georgi Daneliya), about a case of mistaken identity which leaves a Russian man stranded in Israel.\n\nOleg Yankovsky’s few western films are reportedly not among his best. In Tsareubiytsa/Assassin of the Tsar (1991, Karen Shakhnazaro) he played a psychiatrist who is a look-alike of Nicholas II treating a man (Malcolm McDowell), who thinks himself the regicide. Mute Witness (1994, Anthony Waller) is a thriller set in a Russian film studio. While Sally Potter's transatlantic gypsy melodrama The Man Who Cried (2000) divided critics, Yankovsky impressed as Christina Ricci's Jewish father, who emigrates to the US from Russia. In 1991, Yankovsky was the last actor to be awarded the title of People's Artist of the Soviet Union. He continued to receive awards for his work with several Nika Awards from the Russian Film Academy for his directorial debut Prikhodi na Menya Posmotret/Come Look At Me (2001, Oleg Yankovsky) and for his role in Lyubovnik/The Lover (2002, Valery Todorovsky). Starting in 1993, Yankovsky ran the Kinotavr Film Festival in Sochi. He appeared as Count Pahlen in the drama Bednyy, bednyy Pavel/Poor, Poor Pavel (2004, Vitali Melnikov) and as Komarovsky in a TV adaptation of Doktor Zhivago/Doctor Zhivago (2006, Aleksandr Proshkin). His penultimate role was as Karenin in a television adaptation of Anna Karenina (2009, Sergei Solovyov). The last film Yankovsky appeared in was Tsar (2009, Pavel Lungin) which was presented in the Un Certain Regard section at the Cannes Film Festival, just three days before his death. He was being highly praised for his dignified and spiritual performance of the Metropolitanate Philipp, childhood friend and adviser of Ivan the Terrible (Pyotr Mamonov), and his only adversary. In 2009 Oleg Yankovsky died of pancreatic cancer in Moscow, aged 65. He is survived by his son, the actor and film director Filipp Yankovsky, who appeared as a young child in The Mirror, and his wife, the Lenkom actor Lyudmila Zorina.\n\nSources: Ronald Bergan (The Guardian), John Riley (The Independent), Bloomberg News (The New York Times), Wikipedia and IMDb.\n\nRussian postcard by Izdanije Byuro Propogandy Sovietskogo Kinoiskusstva, no. 1984.

Tabakov's film career was equally impressive with roles as Count Nikita Rostov in Voyna i mir I/War and Peace (1966-1967) by Sergei Bondarchuk, and as the title figure in Oblomow (1981) by Nikita Mikhalkov.\n\nOleg Pavlovich Tabakov (Russian: Олег Павлович Табаков) was born in Saratov, USSR (now Saratovskaya oblast, Russia) in 1935.

His parents separated during the Second World War, and young Tabakov was brought up by his single mother and grandmother. He attended the all-boys school in Saratov, and was active in the drama class. From 1950-1953 he studied acting at the Saratov House of Pioneers under the legendary acting coach Natalia Iosifivna Sukhostav. In 1953, Tabakov moved to Moscow and studied at the Moscow Art Theatre School. In 1957 he graduated from the school, and became one of the founding fathers of the Sovremennik Theatre. There he played leading roles in such productions as Goly Korol (Naked King), Tri Zhelaniya (Three Wishes), Obyknovennaya istoriya (Ordinary story) and other contemporary Russian plays.

In 1986, Tabakov persuaded his students to form the Tabakov Studio attached to the Moscow Art Theatre. Several notable Russian actors including Yevgeny Mironov, Sergey Bezrukov, Vladimir Mashkov, Andrey Smolyakov and Alexandre Marine studied at the studio. Tabakov also spread his theatre's ideals abroad. His teaching credentials include workshops and productions at the Paris Conservatoire, the British American Drama Academy, Akademie Der Künst in Hamburg, the Max Reinhardt Seminar in Vienna, Carnegie Mellon, The Juilliard School, New York University, Florida State University, The University of Delaware, and Harvard University. For his stage work he won several medals an honours. Tabakov's film career paralleled his theatrical career. He made his film debut as Sasha in the drama Sasha vstupayet v zhizn/Sasha Enters Life (Mikhail Shvejtser, 1957).

An international success was Neokonchennaya pyesa dlya mekhanicheskogo pianino/ An Unfinished Piece for a Piano Player (Nikita Mikhalkov, 1977). His later films include the Academy Award-winning Moskva slezam ne verit/Moscow Does Not Believe In Tears (Vladimir Menshov, 1980), the international art house hits Oblomov (Nikita Mikhalkov, 1981) and Oci ciornie/Dark Eyes (Nikita Mikhalkov, 1986) starring Marcello Mastroianni. He also played in the mock slapstick Western Chelovek s bulvara Kaputsinov/A Man from the Boulevard des Capuchines (Alla Surikova, 1987) about Mr Jonny First (Andei Mironov), who arrives in the Wild West to present the art of the Cinematograph. Over 40 million people in the USSR paid to see the feature. Tabakov has lend his distinctive, purr-like voice to a number of animated characters, including the talking cat Matroskin in the animation film Kanikuly v Prostokvashino/Three from Prostokvashino (Vladimir Popov, 1980) and its sequels. After the Matroskin role he dubbed the character of Garfield into Russian in the feature film Garfield. During the 1990s, Oleg Tabakov was a strong supporter of democratic reforms and freedom in the new Russia. He made public speeches and was involved in many public events facilitating the cultural transformation of arts and theatres in Russia.

For his films ‘the Russian Spielberg’ won an impressive amount of awards, including the Oscar for the Best Foreign Film with Utomlyonnye solntsem/Burnt by the Sun (1994). As an actor he appeared in more than 40 films.\n\nNikita Sergeyevich Mikhalkov-Konchalovsky was born in Moscow in 1945 into the distinguished, artistic Mikhalkov family. His great grandfather was the imperial governor of Yaroslavl, whose mother was a Galitzine princess. Nikita's father, Sergei Mikhalkov, was best known as writer of children's books, although he also provided the lyrics for the Russian anthem. Nikita's mother, the poet Natalia Konchalovskaya, was the daughter of the avant-garde artist Pyotr Konchalovsky and granddaughter of another outstanding painter, Vasily Surikov. Nikita's older brother is the filmmaker Andrei Konchalovsky, primarily known for his collaboration with Andrei Tarkovsky and his own Hollywood action films, such as Runaway Train and Tango & Cash. Mikhalkov studied acting at the children's studio of the Moscow Art Theatre and later at the Shchukin School of the Vakhtangov Theatre. While still a student, he appeared in the romantic comedy Ya shagayu po Moskve/I Step Through Moscow (1964, Georgi Daneliya). It was nominated for the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival. He was soon on his way to becoming a star of the Soviet stage and cinema. He had a supporting part in Krasnaya Palatka/The Red Tent (1969, Mikhail Kalatozov) starring Sean Connery and Claudia Cardinale. His brother directed him in Dvoryanskoe gnezdo/Home of the Gentry (1970, Andrei Konchalovsky). While continuing to pursue his acting career, Mikhalkov entered VGIK, the state film school in Moscow, where he studied directing under filmmaker Mikhail Romm, teacher to his brother and Andrei Tarkovsky. He directed his first short film in 1967, Devochka i veshchi/The Girl and Things (1967, Nikita Mikhalkov), and another for his graduation, Spokoynyy den v kontse voyny/A Quiet Day at the End of the War (1970, Nikita Mikhalkov). His first feature, Svoy sredi chuzhikh, chuzhoy sredi svoikh/At Home Among Strangers, Stranger at Home (1974, Nikita Mikhalkov), was an Ostern (East-European Western) set just after the 1920’s civil war in Russia. He established himself as one of the most promising Russian directors with a vision of his own with his second feature, Raba lyubvi/A Slave of Love (1976, Nikita Mikhalkov). Set in 1917, it followed the efforts of a film crew to make a silent melodrama in a resort town while the Revolution rages around them. The film, based upon the last days of Vera Kholodnaya, was highly acclaimed upon its release in the U.S. Mikhalkov's next film, Neokonchennaya pyesa dlya mekhanicheskogo pianino/An Unfinished Piece for Player Piano (1977, Nikita Mikhalkov) was adapted by Mikhalkov from Anton Chekhov's early play, Platonov, and won the first prize at the San Sebastian Film Festival. In 1978, while starring in his brother's epic film Siberiada/Siberiade (1978, Andrey Konchalovskiy), Mikhalkov made Pyat vecherov/Five Evenings (1979, Nikita Mikhalkov), a love story about a couple separated by World War II, who meet again after eighteen years. Mikhalkov's next film, Neskolko dney iz zhizni I.I. Oblomova/Oblomov (1980, Nikita Mikhalkov), with Oleg Tabakov in the title role, is based on Ivan Goncharov's classic novel about a lazy young nobleman who refuses to leave his bed. Rodnya/Family Relations (1982, Nikita Mikhalkov) is a comedy about a provincial woman in Moscow dealing with the tangled relationships of her relatives. Bez svideteley/Without Witnesses (1983, Nikita Mikhalkov) tracks a long night's conversation between a woman (Irina Kupchenko) and her ex-husband (Mikhail Ulyanov) when they are accidentally locked in a room.\n\nIn the early 1980’s, Nikita Mikhalkov resumed his acting career, appearing in the immensely popular romance Vokzal dlya dvoikh/Station for Two (1982, Eldar Ryazanov) and Zhestokiy romans/A Cruel Romance (1984, Eldar Ryazanov). At that period, he also played Henry Baskerville in the Soviet screen version of The Hound of the Baskervilles, Priklyucheniya Sherloka Kholmsa i doktora Vatsona: Sobaka Baskerviley (1981, Igor Maslennikov). He also starred in many of his own films. Incorporating several short stories by Anton Chekhov, Oci Ciornie/Dark Eyes (1987, Nikita Mikhalkov) stars Marcello Mastroianni as an old man who tells a story of a romance he had when he was younger, a woman he has never been able to forget. The film was highly praised, and Mastroianni received the Best Actor Prize at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival and an Academy Award nomination for his performance. Mikhalkov's next film, Urga/Close to Eden (1992, Nikita Mikhalkov), set in the little known world of the Mongols, received the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Mikhalkov's Anna: Ot shesti do vosemnadtsati/Anna: 6-18 (1993, Nikita Mikhalkov) documents his daughter Anna as she grows from childhood to maturity. Mikhalkov's most famous production to date, Utomlyonnye solntsem/Burnt by the Sun (1994, Nikita Mikhalkov), was steeped in the paranoid atmosphere of Joseph Stalin's Great Terror. The film received the Grand Prize at Cannes and the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, among many other honours. Mikhalkov was the third Russian director to receive Oscar after Sergei Bondarchuk (in 1961) and Vladimir Menshov (in 1980). To date, Burnt by the Sun remains the highest grossing film to come out of the former Soviet Union. Mikhalkov used the critical and financial triumph of Burnt by the Sun to raise $25,000,000 for his most epic venture to date, Sibirskiy tsiryulnik/The Barber of Siberia (1998, Nikita Mikhalkov). The film, which was screened out of competition at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival, was designed as a grandiose, big budget romance set in the 19th century Russia. It featured Julia Ormond and Oleg Menshikov, who regularly appears in Mikhalkov's films, in the leading roles. The director himself appeared as Tsar Alexander III of Russia. The film received the Russia State Prize and became a runaway box office success. There were rumors about Mikhalkov's presidential ambitions. The director, however, chose to administer the Russian cinema industry. Despite much opposition from rival directors, he was elected the President of the Russian Society of Cinematographers and has managed the Moscow Film Festival since 2000. He also set the Russian Academy Golden Eagle Award in opposition to the traditional Nika Award. In 2005, Mikhalkov resumed his acting career, starring in three brand-new movies - Statskiy sovetnik/The Councilor of State (2005, Filipp Yankovsky) - a Fandorin mystery film which broke the Russian box-office records, Zhmurki/Dead man’s Bluff (2005, Aleksey Balabanov) - a noir-drenched comedy about the Russian Mafia, and Krzysztof Zanussi's Persona non grata (2005). In 2007, Mikhalkov’s film 12 (2007, Nikita Mikhalkov), a loose remake of Sidney Lumet's court drama 12 Angry Men (1957), received a special Golden Lion for the ‘consistent brilliance’ of its work and was praised by many critics at the Venice Film Festival. Recently he took on a role of the executive producer of an epic film 1612. 12 was also named as a nominee for the 2008 Academy Awards. Mikhalkov's first wife was the renowned Russian actress Anastasiya Vertinskaya, whom he married in, 1967. They had a son, Stepan Mikhalkov, born in 1966. With his second wife, former model Tatyana Mikhalkova, he has a son, Artem (1975), and two daughters, Anna (1974) and Nadya (1987). Nikita Mikhalkov is actively involved in Russian politics. He is known for his at times extreme Russian nationalist and Slavophile views, and has been a strong supporter of Russian president Vladimir Putin. Because of his controversial political views, he fell from public favor in the late 1990’s.\n\nSources: Wikipedia and IMDb.\n\nRussian postcard. Photo: Oleg Popov, Ava Gardner, and Todd Lookinland in The Blue Bird (George Cukor, 1976).\n\nThe legendary Russian clown Oleg Popov has died on 2 November, aged 86. He was once described as the Michelangelo of the circus and was at one time the best-known clown in the world. He appeared in a few films.\n\nOleg Konstantinovich Popov was born in 1930 in Vyrubovo, Russia, the son of a clock-repairman. At age 12, he began working as an apprentice typographer for the newspaper Pravda, and he later joined the Pravda's Athletic Club. There, in 1945, someone suggested that he apply for Moscow's State College of Circus and Variety Arts. He was accepted and studied acrobatics, juggling, and other circus skills there, graduating in 1949. At 19, he made his debut as a juggler and slack-wire artist at the Tbilisi Circus in the Georgian SSR. Afterwards, he continued his career at the Moscow Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard (today Circus Nikulin). The circus was a vital part of life in the Soviet Union where, typically every year, more than 70 million citizens would attend one or more shows put on by more than 100 troupes. Popov's comic abilities were spotted just after the Second World War.\n\nIn 1955, Oleg Popov performed abroad for the first time, in Warsaw, and the following year, he toured with the Moscow Circus in France, Belgium, and England, and was immediately noticed by the press, which made him a circus star. The Soviet regime would quickly build on his success abroad and transform Oleg Popov into a goodwill ambassador for the Soviet Union. He appeared in 1958 at the Brussels World Fair, and in 1957, he was broadcast from Moscow on American television. He toured the United States in 1963 and 1972 with the Moscow Circus. In 1969, Oleg Popov was honored with the title of People's Artist of the USSR. He toured extensively around the world in subsequent years with the Moscow Circus. In Australia, he was named King of Moomba (1971).\n\nPopov appeared in a few films, including Арена Смелых/Ring of the Braves ( Sergei Gurov, Yuriy Ozerov, 1953), the Bulgarian film Ritzar bez bronya/Knight Without Armour (Borislav Sharaliev, 1966) and Ma-ma/Mummy ( Elisabeta Bostan, 1977).

He had his breakthrough as Aladdin in the famous Soviet fairy tale film Volshebnaya lampa Aladdina/Aladdin's Magic Lamp (1967). Later he was known as the Russian voice of Homer Simpson.\n\nBoris Yevgenievich Bystrov (Russian: Борис Евгеньевич Быстров) was born in 1945 in Moscow. In 1966, he graduated from the Moscow Art Theatre.

John Seal at IMDb: \"The Soviet film industry was, perhaps unsurprisingly, a hotbed for fantastic stories of witchcraft, magic, and monsters. Aladdin's Magic Lamp is a typical example of the genre, and while it's no classic, it certainly has much in its favour. Take, for example, the marvellous opening sequence, as a black-robed magician conjures a spell under the stars and proceeds to enter Baghdad by midnight. The widescreen photography is gorgeous (though the colours on Ruscico's DVD tend to flutter), the genie in the bottle impressive, and the lead actors well cast.\" In 1968, Bystrov became an actor of the ensemble of the Yermolova Theatre. After his resounding success in the role of Aladdin, he also appeared in other Soviet films such as the sports comedy Удар! Ещё удар!/Goal! Another Goal! (Viktor Sadovsky, 1968) and the children's fantasy film Приключения жёлтого чемоданчика/Priklucheniya zheltogo chemodanchika/Adventures of the Yellow Suitcase (Ilya Frez, 1970). Since 1968 he has been an actor of the Moscow Drama Theatre.\n\nIn the 1970s, Boris Bystrrov started working dubbing foreign feature films and cartoons. In the animated series The Simpsons and Futurama, he voiced all the male roles for several years. He also appeared in the Soviet spy miniseries ТАСС уполномочен заявить..., /TASS upolnomochen zayavit.../TASS Is Authorized to Declare... (Vladimir Fokin, 1984) set in the Cold War era. He also played supporting parts in the films Продлись, продлись, очарованье…/Prodlis, prodlis, ocharovaniye.../Lets the Charms Last Long (Yaropolk Lapshin, 1984) and the French film La Piste du télégraphe/The Telegraph Road' (Liliane de Kermadec, 1994). The latter is a road movie, set in 1927, that follows a Russian-born woman on foot from New York towards her homeland Siberia. Boris Bystrov died in 2024 in Moscow, at the age of 79. He was married three times, to the actresses Inna Kmit, Tatyana Leibel and Irina Savina. He had two children, Yekaterina Kmit and Nikolay Bystrov.

He was accepted and studied acrobatics, juggling, and other circus skills there, graduating in 1949. At 19, he made his debut as a juggler and slack-wire artist at the Tbilisi Circus in the Georgian SSR. Afterward, he continued his career at the Moscow Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard (today Circus Nikulin). The circus was a vital part of life in the Soviet Union where, typically every year, more than 70 million citizens would attend one or more shows put on by more than 100 troupes. Popov's comic abilities were spotted just after the Second World War.\n\nIn 1955, Oleg Popov performed abroad for the first time, in Warsaw, and the following year, he toured with the Moscow Circus in France, Belgium, and England, and was immediately noticed by the press, which made him a circus star. The Soviet regime would quickly build on his success abroad and transform Oleg Popov into a goodwill ambassador for the Soviet Union. He appeared in 1958 at the Brussels World Fair, and in 1957, he was broadcast from Moscow on American television. He toured the United States in 1963 and 1972 with the Moscow Circus.

He appeared in more than 60 leading roles, including his spot-on depiction of Lenin in Serdtse materi/A Mother’s Heart (1967).\n\nRodion (Rodin) Rafailovich Nahapetov was born in Pyatikhatki, located in the Dnepropetrovsk region of the Ukraine in the former Soviet Union, in 1944. His mother, Galina Antonovna Prokopenko was a schoolteacher. During the Nazi occupation, Galina was involved in the underground organization Motherland that operated in Krivoi Rog. Rodion was delivered by Russian soldiers during the liberation of the Ukraine. Galina aptly named her son Rodina, which means Motherland. Later, his name was changed to Rodion. Rodion’s father, Raphael Nahapetov, never met his son. After the war, Raphael returned to his family. Galina never married. Rodion lived with his grandmother in the village of Skelevatka (a suburb of Krivoi Rog) until he was 5. In 1950, Galina and Rodion moved to the city of Dniepropetrovsk. She found a job teaching in Elementary School Number 34. By the early 1950’s she was suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. The management of the school decided to place Rodion in an orphanage, where he spent almost two years. Galina’s health improved and the school helped her procure a small room in a communal apartment. She brought ten-year-old Rodion home from the orphanage and he resumed his place in school. Rodion was once asked to play the part of a bear in a school play celebrating the new year. Wearing a mask, he began to growl fiercely and imitate the bear so well the students applauded his performance enthusiastically. This experience influenced his professional path in the days to come. In 1960, he traveled to Moscow after receiving his high school diploma. His goal was to be accepted in the prestigious acting department of VGIK (USSR University of Cinema). Rodion played the part of an old man for his audition, reading a passage from Gorky’s novel Childhood. Renowned masters of Russian cinema, Sergei Gerasimov and Tamara Makarova recognized the talent in the sixteen-year old, and he moved into the dormitory of the Institute of Cinematography in Moscow.\n\nRodion Nahapetov acting career started in his third year of studies. His film debut role was an engineer named Gena in the romantic comedy Zhivyot takoy paren/There Lived Such a Lad (1966, Vasili Shukshin). An important acting challenge was playing the young Vladimir Lenin in Serdtse materi/A Mother’s Heart (1967, Mark Donskoy) and the sequel Vernost materi/A Mother’s Loyalty (1968, Mark Donskoy). Rodion was only twenty-years-old and was required to portray the life of Lenin over a period of 31 years (age 16 to 47). His talent to play much older people served him well. In response to his lauded performance of Lenin, Nahapetov received the Moscow Komsomol Award and was presented the Order of Merit medal. These roles in the 1960’s made Nahapetov tremendously popular among a loyal following of fans. Among his most famous films is Vlyublyonnye/Tenderness (1971, Elyer Ishmukhamedov) with Anastasiya Vertinskaya. During this period Rodion’s mother had become seriously ill. The last film she saw which starred her son was A Mother’s Heart. Galina Prokopenko died in Moscow in 1966. Rodion grieved deeply over the death of his beloved mother. Despite his marked success in acting, Rodion chose to return to VKIG to widen the scope of his talent and study directing. His debut work as a director S toboy i bez tebya/With You and Without You (1974, Rodion Nahapetov) was filmed at Mosfilm Studios in Moscow. The film was popular among public and the critics.
