        "text": "Reviewed by: Tim Salmons\n\nReview Date: Apr 09, 2020\n\nFormat: Blu-ray Disc\n\nReview\n\nSeverin Films has been busy releasing a variety of films as of late, from Eurosleaze to the erotic to the undervalued, all on Blu-ray with fresh film transfers and extras. Their last several titles have been no different, offering up a kaleidoscope of cinema’s mostly forgotten films.\n\nViy is a Soviet Union horror film released in 1967, based upon the novel of the same name by Nikolai Gogol. In it, a priest in training named Khoma (Leonid Kuravlyov) is sent to a small village where the body of a dead woman, whom they believe to be a witch, is being kept in a church nearby. Khoma is hired by the girl’s father to stand watch over the course of three nights and to pray for her soul. However, during his vigil, the girl gets up out of her coffin, threatening him with curses and visions of ghosts and goblins, as well as the titular monster of ancient folklore.\n\nWhat makes Viy stand apart, aside from its story which builds its tension over the course of the three nights as the attacks on Khoma gradually worsen, is the look of the film. It’s incredibly well-shot with genuine moments of suspense. The witch is truly unnerving, particularly during her moments of anger when the sun rises and she must return to her coffin. The most disappointing moment of the film comes with the appearance of its monster, which is not at all scary, tipping into camp territory unintentionally. However, the other elements surrounding it outshine it, making Viy an undervalued genre film during a period before Russian filmmaking’s golden age.\n\nAccording to the marketing materials, Viy has been “remastered in HD for the first time ever,” though the source is not identified. It’s a solid high definition presentation, appearing quite natural with excellent color. However, there are minor moments of color fluctuation. The audio is included in Russian and English 2.0 mono DTS-HD. Both tracks feature clear dialogue exchanges and a strong score, though sound effects aren’t always that impactful. The English dub sounds a bit more mechanical, comparatively. English subtitles are also provided for both tracks.\n\nExtras include the following:\n\nViy the Vampire: An Interview with Richard Stanley (HD – 22:57)\n\nFrom the Woods to the Cosmos: John Leman Riley on the History of Soviet Fantasy and Sci-Fi Film (HD – 34:46)\n\nViy Trailer (SD – 1:53)\n\nThe Portrait Short Film (SD – 5:23)\n\nThe Queen of Spades Short Film (SD – 6:25)\n\nSatan Exultant Short Film (SD – 9:09)\n\nViy is certainly a title worth your attention if you’re a fan of off-the-wall cinema.\n\n– Tim Salmons"
