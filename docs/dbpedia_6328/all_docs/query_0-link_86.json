        "text": "We have an assumption, generally speaking, that anything \"free\" must have a catch. It must be of worse quality, we tell ourselves. It must have some cut corners or loose ends, surely. Not so with Tubi, the streaming service that is, get this, completely free.\n\nSure, there is a \"catch\" of sorts. The streaming platform is ad-supported, which means that you'll get a brief advertisement every now and then. A small price to pay, we say, considering the incredible depth of their library. Tubi offers titles from a wide range of studios including Paramount, MGM, and Lionsgate, among others. And as the list below will testify, the quantity of their materials does not sacrifice quality. You're truly spoiled for choice as far as Tubi is concerned, from cult classics and preternaturally excellent directorial debuts to top-shelf international offerings.\n\nWe culled through the streaming service's offerings and picked out the best of the best. So get out your pen and paper (or Letterboxd watchlist tab ... whatever floats your boat), and read on for our look at the best films currently streaming on Tubi.\n\nUpdated on December 5, 2023: Tubi is constantly updating its selection with new, excellent titles that will keep your watchlist well-staked. So please note that this article is updated monthly to reflect changes to Tubi's streaming availability.\n\nWhen it comes to stagey, one-room dramas, you just can't beat \"12 Angry Men.\" A group of male jurors (because apparently women couldn't be trusted to sit on a jury) are tasked with deliberating over a high-profile murder case in which a teenage boy is accused of killing his father. Everyone is pretty much convinced that he's guilty, and the jurors are prepared to vote quickly — after all, they've got stuff to do. But one juror, played by a never-better Henry Fonda, insists that they owe it to the boy and the criminal justice system itself to at least talk about the case for a little while. As they turn over each piece of evidence, doubt over the boy's guilt grows, exposing the weighty role that our own prejudices and preconceived notions can play in crucial decision-making.\n\nStarring: Henry Fonda, Jack Klugman, Lee J. Cobb\n\nDirector: Sidney Lumet\n\nYear: 1957\n\nRuntime: 96 minutes\n\nRating: NR\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 100%\n\nYou'd be forgiven for thinking that \"Charade\" is an Alfred Hitchcock movie — it has all the hallmarks of his best thrillers. Audrey Hepburn stars as Regina Lampert, who returns to her Parisian flat after a skiing vacation to discover her home ransacked and her husband missing. It quickly becomes clear that he was murdered, and his killers are still at large. With her life in danger, she teams up with the mysterious Peter Joshua (Cary Grant), who promises to keep her safe but has some secrets of his own. Hepburn and Grant have incredible chemistry with one another, and the film's combination of stylish visuals and constant twists makes it irresistible.\n\nStarring: Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn, Walter Matthau\n\nDirector: Stanley Donen\n\nYear: 1963\n\nRuntime: 115 minutes\n\nRating: NR\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 94%\n\n\"Memory is a selection of images, some elusive, others imprinted indelibly on the brain. The summer I killed my father, I was 10 years old.\" Whatever you think about \"Eve's Bayou,\" surely this is one of the most interesting opening lines in all of film, the kind of thing that every screenwriter wishes they had been the one to pen.\n\n\"Eve's Bayou\" stars Jurnee Smollett as a young girl coming of age during the 1960s as part of a prominent Creole family in Louisiana. But as her understanding of the world around her — and particularly the inner workings of her family unit — becomes more nuanced, she begins to realize that her parents are not quite as perfect and respectable as they appear. \"Eve's Bayou\" is a delightfully atmospheric Southern gothic with standout performances from its young star and Samuel L. Jackson as her father.\n\nStarring: Samuel L. Jackson, Jurnee Smollett, Meagan Good\n\nDirector: Kasi Lemmons\n\nYear: 1997\n\nRuntime: 109 minutes\n\nRating: R\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 83%\n\nOne of the most exciting \"supernatural child\" films of the modern era, \"Freaks\" centers around Chloe, a young girl who lives with her father in a creepy old mansion and is forbidden to interact with the outside world. But kids are curious, and her seemingly innocent attempts to explore what lies beyond her front door come at a terrible price. In many ways, \"Freaks\" feels like the origin story for a superhero (or potentially a supervillain) without all the baggage of an established canon. Chloe's potential is limitless, even if she exists in a world that is purposefully trying to snuff out any spark of supernatural ability.\n\nStarring: Emile Hirsch, Bruce Dern, Lexy Kolker\n\nDirector: Adam Stein, Zach Lipovsky\n\nYear: 2018\n\nRuntime: 105 minutes\n\nRating: R\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 88%\n\nTwo irony-poisoned teens named Enid and Rebecca find themselves in a post-graduation malaise once the summer hits. Now that high school is over, they have to figure out what kind of people they want to be — but in truth, they don't seem to want to be much of anything. Self-discovery is hard ... and they have lonely middle-aged men to mess with in the meantime. Based on Daniel Clowes' comic series of the same name, \"Ghost World\" pokes fun at late-20th century cynicism while offering a poignant portrait of the inevitable rifts that form in young adult friendships.\n\nStarring: Thora Birch, Scarlett Johansson, Steve Buscemi\n\nDirector: Terry Zwigoff\n\nYear: 2001\n\nRuntime: 112 minutes\n\nRating: R\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 93%\n\nNo, Marlon Brando is not a particularly good singer. Yes, he talk-sings his way through \"Luck Be a Lady.\" Yes, he has the role that by all rights really should have gone to Frank Sinatra. But does that make \"Guys and Dolls\" any less of a classic movie musical? It does not. Brando and Sinatra star as a pair of degenerate gamblers: Sky Masterson and Nathan Detroit, respectively. These two will bet on anything. So it should come as no surprise that Nathan bets Sky that he can't take a lady of Nathan's choosing on a date to Havana. Of course Sky agrees. Then Nathan picks the primmest, most self-righteous dame in New York — Sergeant Sarah Brown of the Save a Soul Mission. You can probably see where this is going.\n\nStarring: Marlon Brando, Frank Sinatra, Jean Simmons\n\nDirector: Joseph L. Mankiewicz\n\nYear: 1955\n\nRuntime: 150 minutes\n\nRating: NR\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 91%\n\nNewspaper editor Walter and ace reporter Hildy are no longer married, but that little technicality isn't going to stop him from doing everything in his power to keep her on the payroll. While Hildy gets sucked into a thrilling assignment about a convicted cop killer, Walter pulls out all the stops to thwart his ex's impending marriage. Does Walter value Hildy more as an employee or as the love of his life? Will Hildy continue her career or will she settle down for a quiet life of domestic bliss? A screwball comedy with wit and heart to spare, \"His Girl Friday\" is a fast-talking delight.\n\nStarring: Cary Grant, Rosalind Russell, Ralph Bellamy\n\nDirector: Howard Hawks\n\nYear: 1940\n\nRuntime: 92 minutes\n\nRating: NR\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 99%\n\nMost film fans are aware of Alfred Hitchcock's massive contributions to the thriller genre from the 1950s and 1960s, but they might be surprised to learn exactly how far back his career as a director stretched. \"The Lodger,\" a silent film released in 1927, was Hitchcock's third, but the first that saw him utilize his now-familiar cinematography of suspense. In a London plagued by a serial killer targeting young blonde women, an unassuming lodger falls under suspicion for the heinous crimes — but is he actually the murderer, or just a convenient scapegoat? With the fog drifting through nearly every shot, \"The Lodger\" is a uniquely atmospheric thriller that established Hitchcock as one of the best in the business.\n\nStarring: Ivor Novello, June Tripp, Malcolm Keen\n\nDirector: Alfred Hitchcock\n\nYear: 1927\n\nRuntime: 90 minutes\n\nRating: NR\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 96%\n\nFor all those of you out there who have ever had a family member pseudo-innocently ask you when you're going to settle down and get married, this one's for you. Ernest Borgnine stars as Marty, a shy, mild-mannered butcher who has been struggling to meet a woman in the face of pressures from his overbearing mother. One night, he hits it off with Clara, a schoolteacher who is equally unlucky with love, and the two wallflowers are aglow with the joy of someone actually showing interest in them. A sweet, low-key romance, \"Marty\" is thoroughly of its time while still feeling strikingly relatable to modern audiences.\n\nStarring: Ernest Borgnine, Betsy Blair, Joe Mantell\n\nDirector: Delbert Mann\n\nYear: 1955\n\nRuntime: 90 minutes\n\nRating: NR\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 96%\n\nReleased in the middle of the 1980s, when the teen flick was king, \"Night of the Comet\" is basically John Hughes meets \"Return of the Living Dead.\" A pair of teenage sisters are caught unawares when they become survivors of an apocalypse caused by a comet crossing through the Earth's orbit. Most of the world's population turns into either a pile of ash, or the walking dead. But Regina and Samantha soon realize that they not only need to fear zombies, but also their fellow survivors, who may or may not be acting in good faith. A classic '80s horror comedy, \"Night of the Comet\" has a well-deserved cult following.\n\nStarring: Catherine Mary Stewart, Kelli Maroney, Robert Beltran\n\nDirector: Thom Eberhardt\n\nYear: 1984\n\nRuntime: 93 minutes\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 79%\n\nHere's the slow-shambling survival horror that started it all. For reasons unknown, the dead have started clawing their way out of their graves. A group of survivors, some in better mental states than others, congregate in an abandoned farmhouse. Soon enough, the undead are swaying in the front yard, pawing at the boarded-up windows, and gnawing on anyone unlucky enough to fail to find a farmhouse of their own. A film you can't help but put yourself in (how would you react?), \"Night of the Living Dead\" is an incredible directorial debut and an essential piece of the cinematic puzzle. Featuring one of the most gut-punch endings of all time, \"Night of the Living Dead\" has lost none of its power, even in an age where zombies have learned how to break into a full sprint.\n\nStarring: Duane Jones, Judith O'Dea, Karl Hardman\n\nDirector: George A. Romero\n\nYear: 1968\n\nRuntime: 95 minutes\n\nRating: NR\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 96%\n\nAfter a bank robbery goes sideways, seasoned criminal Dad Longworth chooses to sacrifice his young partner Rio to the law. Five agonizing years later, Rio escapes from jail with a singular, revenge-filled purpose: find and kill his treacherous mentor. However, when Rio finally tracks Dad down, he's shocked to find his former friend has changed his criminal ways and is the elected sheriff of Monterey. He even has a family. Melancholic and deeply agnostic about the hard line between the good guys and the black hats, \"One-Eyed Jacks\" is an essential and criminally underseen entry in the revisionist Western canon. While the reputation of \"One-Eyed Jacks\" is mostly as a curio — it's the only film that Marlon Brando ever directed — this atmosphere-rich portrait of revenge and redemption is a must-watch.\n\nStarring: Marlon Brando, Karl Malden, Katy Jurado\n\nDirector: Marlon Brando\n\nYear: 1961\n\nRuntime: 141 minutes\n\nRating: NR\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 61%\n\nA shocking and unnerving solo venture from British director Michael Powell (one half of a prolific duo alongside Emeric Pressburger), \"Peeping Tom\" follows Mark, a photographer, a loner, and a compulsive killer. Indeed, Mark's mild-mannered exterior masks a deep-seated darkness. He's an artist, you see — a documentarian making a film on the nature of fear that's made up of filmed recordings of his murders. When he befriends Helen, his neighbor, there's a glimmer of hope that Mark may be able to get his head on straight and form a real human connection. As the tension between his dark desires and his insatiable loneliness come into conflict, Mark's careful balancing act begins to crack. Meticulously crafted and endearingly acted, \"Peeping Tom\" will raise the bristles on the back of your neck and then some.\n\nStarring: Carl Boehm, Moira Shearer, Anna Massey\n\nDirector: Michael Powell\n\nYear: 1960\n\nRuntime: 101 minutes\n\nRating: NR\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 96%\n\nIt should come as no surprise to anyone that the son of Meg Ryan would be a perfect fit for a rom-com. Jack Quaid stars alongside Maya Erskine as a pair of friends who, staring down a long wedding season, agree to be each other's dates at the endless nuptials they're obligated to attend. But, predictably, the weddings have a habit of putting these two attractive, charming people into romantic situations, and it isn't long before they start catching feelings for one another. Quaid and Erskine have a completely natural chemistry together, making \"Plus One\" an adorable date movie that deserves more attention than it gets.\n\nStarring: Maya Erskine, Jack Quaid, Ed Begley Jr.\n\nDirector: Jeff Chan, Andrew Rhymer\n\nYear: 2019\n\nRuntime: 99 minutes\n\nRating: NR\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 88%\n\nWhile Walt Disney Studios floundered during the 1980s, Don Bluth reigned supreme in the world of Western feature animation. While we're certainly \"The Land Before Time\" fans around these parts, \"The Secret of NIMH\" is neck in neck for Bluth's masterwork. It's a visually stunning, imaginative, and shockingly intense film that's one of those movies that probably shouldn't actually be rated G. The film tells of a widowed field mouse who must relocate her family in order to get out of the way of an incoming farmer's plow. When the move proves too much for her sickly youngest son, she must seek out the rats of NIMH, who may hold the key to saving her family.\n\nStarring: Elizabeth Hartman, Derek Jacobi, Dom DeLuise\n\nDirector: Don Bluth\n\nYear: 1982\n\nRuntime: 82 minutes\n\nRating: G\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 93%\n\nIn the year 1880, a group of strangers climbs aboard a stagecoach headed from Arizona to New Mexico, with each passenger running from something. Their journey takes them through Native American territory, and their unwelcome presence triggers the ire of the local tribal leader. A heart-pumping chase sequence ensues. You know how \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" is one long chase? Well, John Ford was doing that nearly eight decades earlier. A metaphorical door kick both for the career of John Wayne, the Hollywood Western, and a new visceral vision of what cinema could do, \"Stagecoach\" may be old, but don't let its age fool you. This puppy's got some kick to it.\n\nStarring: John Wayne, Claire Trevor, Andy Devine\n\nDirector: John Ford\n\nYear: 1939\n\nRuntime: 95 minutes\n\nRating: NR\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 100%\n\nIf you've ever thought to yourself, \"Gosh, I'd love to watch the first (and only) Soviet-era horror film officially released in the USSR,\" have we got the film for you. Adapted from Nikolai Gogol's horror novella of the same name, \"Viy\" tells the story of a young and airheaded priest who bumbles his way into presiding over the corpse of a rumored witch for three consecutive nights. This seemingly easy task is foiled by the terrifying fact that the witch is dead-set on making the priest break his vigil. As tense as it is full of \"Evil Dead\"-style physical comedy, \"Viy\" is the most nightmarish film to also contain a scene where a witch surfs atop her own coffin. With its crisp runtime and striking visuals, \"Viy\" is much more than a historical footnote.\n\nStarring: Natalya Varley, Vadim Zakharchenko, G. Sochevko\n\nDirector: Konstantin Yershov, Georgi Kropachyov\n\nYear: 1967\n\nRuntime: 78 minutes\n\nRating: NR\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 88%\n\nObstinate barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts is recovering from a serious health scare, and is ordered by his doctor to take a leave of absence from work in an effort to reduce stress. Naturally, the first thing he does upon returning to the office is take on a new client, Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power), who is charged with murdering an elderly woman in the hopes of inheriting her vast fortune. \"Witness For the Prosecution\" is a snappy courtroom drama, but it's also funnier than audiences might expect, with just as much witty dialogue as dramatic surprises on the witness stand. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including nods for best picture, best actor (Charles Laughton), best director, and best supporting actress (Elsa Lanchester, who plays Robarts' put-upon nurse, but was Laughton's real-life wife).\n\nStarring: Charles Laughton, Tyrone Power, Marlene Dietrich\n\nDirector: Billy Wilder\n\nYear: 1957\n\nRuntime: 116 minutes\n\nRating: NR\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 100%"
