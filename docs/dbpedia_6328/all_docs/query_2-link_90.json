        "text": "VIY—SPIRIT OF EVIL, legend holds, was the first horror film ever made in the Soviet Union, and for a long time the only one. Based on Nikolai Gogol’s Ukrainian folk tale, VIY recounts the story of a debauched novice priest who, one dark and spooky night, encounters an old witch whom he mortally wounds. But when the witch inhabits the body of a young and beautiful noblewoman, she dies with a curse on her lips: the priest must spend three nights alone in the church praying for her. And every night is filled with fresh horrors and crazy demons!\n\nA brilliant interplay of special effects and folk motifs, VIY is a beautiful example of the insurgent national cinemas emerging in the USSR during the 60s, and also just plain creepy fun!"
