But when she rises from the dead to seduce him, it will summon a nightmare of fear, desire and the ultimate demonic mayhem. Bursting with startling imagery and stunning practical effects by directors Konstantin Yershov and Georgi Kropachyov, this “overlooked classic” (Paste Magazine) has influenced generations of directors for more than half a century and is still unlike any horror movie you’ve ever seen.\n\nSpecial Features:\n\nViy the Vampire: An Interview with Richard Stanley\n\nThe Woods To The Cosmos: John Leman Riley On The History Of Soviet Fantasy And Sci-Fi Film\n\nShort Silent Films – Satan Exultant, The Queen of Spades, and The Portrait\n\nTrailer\n\nEnglish Track"
