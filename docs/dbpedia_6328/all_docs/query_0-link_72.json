        "text": "According to Jonathan R. Eller, in his piece, \"The Story of Fahrenheit 451\", in the 60th Anniversary Edition of the novel, he tells his reader that:\n\nIn late 1949 Los Angeles, during the \"Second Red Scare\", Ray and a friend where walking down the deserted Wilshire Boulevard, a major Los Angeles Street running from the Pacific Ocean into downtown, in an area that was not normally used by pedestrians at that hour. When a police cruiser pulled over and stopped them. The police officer asked what the two where doing on the deserted main street?\n\nAccording to Eller, Ray Bradbury answered sarcastically:\n\nWell, we're putting one foot in front of the other.\n\nThe police officer did not appreciate Bradbury's joke and became very suspicious of the two men. As a result of the incident, again according to Jonathan Eller, Ray Bradbury wrote \"The Pedestrian\", about a man named \"Leonard Mead\", who lived in a house with the same address as the one the author had grew up in.\n\nThe novel is broken into three sections and there is no way to avoid the politics seen in the Southern United States and especially Florida at the time of my writing about this prophetic novel. However, I will not address the situation specifically, as this article is about Ray Bradbury's writings and the interpretations by others in different mediums of his words.\n\nBriefly:\n\n\"The Health of the Salamander\"\n\nIntroduces the reader to the improved character of \"Fireman, Guy Montag\", over his first appearance in the short story, \"The Fireman\". A fireman does not put out fires, he causes them, by burning books banned by the government.\n\n\"The Fireman\" is returning from his life's work one evening, and \"Guy\" meets his teenage neighbor \"Clarisse McClellan\". She a free-thinking, spirited, young girl, whose lifestyle has the effect of causing \"Montag\" to question his work.\n\nThis is supplemented by \"Guy Montag\" entering his home and finding his wife, \"Mildred\", having overdosed on sleeping pills, he calls for EMT's, they pump out her stomach, and change her blood. They leave, and \"Guy\" over hears \"Clarisse\" and her family discussing the illiterate society they live in. \"Clarisse\" starts meeting \"Guy Montage\" and as the two walk, she tells him of her simple pleasures and interests that make \"Clarisse\" an outcast among her peers. Under the government dictates related to having and reading books, she is sent to therapy to correct her anti-government thoughts. One night \"Clarisse McClellan\" just disappears.\n\nWhile ransacking an old women's house and piling up books to be burned. \"Guy\", having been influenced by \"Clarisse's\" ideas, steals one book before the others are burned. The old lady refuses to leave her house and dies in the fire lite by the firemen's \"Salamander\" machine.\n\nFireman \"Guy Montag\" goes to his firehouse chief, \"Captain Beatty\" and asks him a question he had heard expressed before. What happened to the original firemen who fought fires? The answer was that for safety, all buildings were now made of fireproof materials. So, firemen were no longer needed.\n\n\"Beatty\" tells \"Montag\" how books lost their value over decades, as people embraced the new medias of film and television, watched sporting events, and with the ever-quickening pace of life, had no time to read a long book and they became obsolete in that form. Adding, that what books that were still being made, started to be abridged for the shorter attention span of people.\n\nFinally, books had been banned by the government, because reading books was a source of confusion that caused the readers to have depressing thoughts. Thoughts that went against what the government was telling them should be their society of peace of mind. Besides, books lied about history and told troubling stories creating free-thought.\n\nAt some point in the past. the government had turned to the unemployed firemen. The government turned the firemen into officers charged with enforcing societies \"peace of mind\". Instead of fighting fires, firemen were ordered to start them, by burning books for everyone's good.\n\nLater, \"Mildred Montag\" reveals that \"Clarisse's\" parents moved away after she was hit and killed by a speeding car.\n\nFor over a year \"Montag\" has been saving books and at the end of this section reveals this to \"Mildred\", and tells her they will read them to see if they have any value.\n\n\"The Sieve and the Sand\"\n\n\"Mildred\" flatly refuses her husband's idea to read books. Having been conditioned by the government about the evil in books, \"Mildred\" questions \"Guy\", as to why she or anyone else should even care about books?\n\n\"Clarisse's\" ideas have had their effect on \"Guy\", and they come out against \"Mildred's\" refusal to read even one book. He loudly speaks to her suicide attempts, the disappearance and death of \"Clarisse\", and the woman who let herself be burnt to death with her books,\n\n\"Montag\" will visit a \"Mr. Faber\", an English professor before books were banned, to help him understand books. He visits \"Faber\" with the book he stole from the woman's home, the bible. The frightened \"Faber\" starts to help \"Montag\" and gives him an earpiece communicator so they can be in constant touch.\n\nAt home, \"Mildred\" and two of her friends are watching \"the parlor walls\", a futuristic form of television, and become confused when \"Guy\" brings out a book of poetry and starts to read it aloud. \"Mildred\" tries to explain away his action by telling her friends it's a tradition firemen do once a year, read a book to show how silly the past was. The poetry causes one of \"Mildred's\" friends, \"Mrs. Phelps\" to cry and they leave.\n\n\"Montag\" hides his books in the backyard before he leaves for the firehouse. An alarm rings at the firehouse and \"Beatty\" picks up the address and they drive there, it's \"Guy Montag's\" home.\n\n\"Burning Bright\"\n\n\"Beatty\" orders \"Guy Montag\" to burn his home down with a flamethrower and not the more powerful \"Salamander\". He adds that it was his wife and her two friends that reported him. \"Guy\" watches \"Mildred\" walk out of the house and past him as if in trance only thinking about losing her \"parlor walls\". \"Montag\" now starts to burn down his house, but \"Beatty\" discovers the earpiece and plans to hunt down \"Faber\". \"Guy\" turns the flamethrower on his superior and burns \"Beatty\" to death.\n\n\"Montag\" almost suffers the same fate as \"Clarisse\", when he is almost killed by a speeding car. \"Faber\" urges him to go to the countryside and contact the other exiled book-lovers. He escapes a man-hunt and makes it to the book-lovers. They unlock his photographic mind and he starts to learn and become \"The Book of Ecclesiastes\".\n\nIn horror the group witness bombers flying overhead and dropping nuclear weapons and annihilating the city that \"Guy Montag\" used to live in. The war began that morning, and ended that night.\n\nWhen the war was over, the exiled book-lovers returned to rebuild the city and the old society.\n\nRay Bradbury made some changes to his novel over the years. In 1979, he added a coda, that contained:\n\nThere is more than one way to burn a book. And the world is full of people running about with lit matches. Every minority, be it Baptist/Unitarian, Irish/Italian/Octogenarian/Zen Buddhist, Zionist/Seventh-day Adventist, Women's Lib/Republican, Mattachine/Four Square Gosepel feels it has the will, the right, the duty to douse the kerosene, light the fuse. [...] Fire-Captain Beatty, in my novel Fahrenheit 451, described how the books were burned first by minorities, each ripping a page or a paragraph from this book, then that, until the day came when the books were empty and the minds shut and the libraries closed forever. [...] Only six weeks ago, I discovered that, over the years, some cubby-hole editors at Ballantine Books, fearful of contaminating the young, had, bit by bit, censored some seventy-five separate sections from the novel. Students, reading the novel, which, after all, deals with censorship and book-burning in the future, wrote to tell me of this exquisite irony. Jusy-Lynn del Rey, one of the new Ballantine editors, is having the entire book reset and republished this summer with all the damns and hells back in place.\n\nThen, in 1982, it was an afterword, in 1993, he added a foreword, and at different times, different editions saw introductions by the author.\n\nStarting in January 1967, \"Ballantine Books\", started censoring portions of the book. This began with an edition aimed at High School student reading programs, it was known as the \"Bal-Hi Edition\". Among the words censored by the publisher were \"Hell\", \"Damn\", and \"Abortion\". This also included the modification and changes to 75-passages and two-incidents. By 1973, the publisher was printing only the censored edition. It was in 1979, the Ray Bradbury found out about the censorship to his work.\n\nAccording to Bill Green, in his February 2007, \"The mutilation and rebirth of a classic: Fahrenheit 451\", in \"Compass: New Directions at Falvey\", Villanova University, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1979, one of Bradbury's friends showed him an expurgated copy. Bradbury demanded that Ballantine Books withdraw that version and replace it with the original, and in 1980 the original version once again became available. In this reinstated work, in the Author's Afterword, Bradbury relates to the reader that it is not uncommon for a publisher to expurgate an author's work, but he asserts that he himself will not tolerate the practice of manuscript \"mutilation\".\n\nThere would be other censorship issues over the novel, examples occurred in Panama City, Florida, Irvine, California, and South Africa.\n\nStage Productions:\n\nDuring the 1970's, Ray Bradbury turned his novel into a play. Part of the play originally was staged at \"Colony Theatre\", Los Angeles, in 1979. The World Premiere of the complete play was in November 1988, in Fort Wayne, Indiana, at the \"Indiana Civic Theatre\". Portions of this play seemed influenced by the 1966 motion picture, rather than Bradbury's actual written work.\n\nIt wouldn't be until 2003, in Nottingham, East Midlands, England, before the play was once again performed,\n\nIt was another three-years before in 2006, \"Godlight Theatre Company\", produced the play and performed it in New York City, at the \"59E59 Theaters\". After its run in New York City, the play transferred across the pond for the 2006, Edinburgh, Scotland, stage festival.\n\nIn April 2012, the \"Birmingham Repertory Theatre\" performed a play entitled, \"Time Has Fallen Asleep in the Afternoon Sunshine\", at the \"Birmingham England Central Library\". The play was inspired by \"Fahrenheit 451\", or more to the 1863, book, \"Dreamthrop\", by Alexander Smith. Which Ray Bradbury had sourced his title, \"The Health of the Salamander\" from.\n\nRadio Productions:\n\nOn December 4, 1956, Ray Bradbury was interviewed on NBC Radio. His interview referred directly to both Senator Joseph McCarthy and \"The House Committee on Un-American Activities\":\n\nI wrote this book at a time when I was worried about the way things were going in this country four years ago. Too many people were afraid of their shadows; there was a threat of book burning. Many of the books were being taken off the shelves at that time. And of course, things have changed a lot in four years. Things are going back in a very healthy direction. But at the time I wanted to do some sort of story where I could comment on what would happen to a country if we let ourselves go too far in this direction, where then all thinking stops, and the dragon swallows his tail, and we sort of vanish into a limbo and we destroy ourselves by this sort of action.\n\nAdding his reasoning for writing \"Fahrenheit 451\", Bradbury stated:\n\nIn writing the short novel Fahrenheit 451, I thought I was describing a world that might evolve in four or five decades. But only a few weeks ago, in Beverly Hills one night, a husband and wife passed me, walking their dog. I stood staring after them, absolutely stunned. The woman held in one hand a small cigarette-package-sized radio, its antenna quivering. From this sprang tiny copper wires which ended in a dainty cone plugged into her right ear. There she was, oblivious to man and dog, listening to far winds and whispers and soap-opera cries, sleep-walking, helped up and down curbs by a husband who might just as well not have been there. This was not fiction\n\nIn 1982, television writer and radio dramatist, Gregory Evans, wrote the BBC Radio 4 production of \"Fahrenheit 451. It would be broadcast eight more times, twice in each of 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2015.\n\nIn 2003, BBC Radio 4, ran a different version of \"Fahrenheit 451\", written by David Calcutt, but returned, as I just mentioned, to the Gregory Evans version in 2010.\n\nTelevision Productions:\n\nOn October 3, 1957, the CBS anthology series, \"Playhouse 90\", performed \"A Sound of Different Drummers\", written by Robert Allan Arthur, and directed by John Frankenheimer. Sterling Hayden portrayed \"Gordon Miller, the young security police officer\", and Diana Lynn portrayed \"Susan Ward, an idealistic librarian\".\n\nJohn Ireland portrayed \"Ben Hammond, a satisfied conformist\", and David Opatoshu portrayed \"Ellis, the chief trial judge and secret reader\". The program was hosted by Tony Randall.\n\nWriter Robert Allan Arthur, unauthorized, combined plot ideas from both Ray Bradbury's, \"Fahrenheit 451\", and British author, George Orwell's, \"1984\". Ray Bradbury sued and won on appeal.\n\nMotion Pictures:\n\nThere are two film versions of the novel, I start with the classic version that the author used ideas from for his play.\n\n\"Fahrenheit 451\" premiered at the Venice, Italy, Film Festival on September 7, 1966\n\nThe motion picture was a co-production of France and the United Kingdom. After the premier in Venice, Italy, the feature film next opened in France on September 15, 1966, followed by the United Kingdom on September 16, 1966, and had a United States exclusive engagement in New York City starting on November 2, 1966, and finally went to general release in the United States on November 16, 1966.\n\nThis was the first English language motion picture by French director Francois Truffaut. He followed this film with the 1968, French revenge feature film, \"La Mariee etiait en noir (\"The Bride was in black)\" aka: \"The Bride Wore Black\", starring the excellent French actress Jeanne Moreau.\n\nThe screenplay was co-written in French, by Francois Truffaut and Jean-Louis Richard, also the co-writer on \"La Mariee etiait en noir\". However, because Truffaut did not speak English, his directions during filming, were translated by Helen Scott. The movie was shot at England's, \"Pinewood Studios\" in Iver Heath.\n\nAt the time, Helen Scott worked in the French Film Office in New York City, and had been the translator for a series of interviews about motion pictures between Francois Truffaut and Alfred Hitchcock. Along with translating the French language screenplay for the English-speaking actors. Scott also wrote additional English language dialogue for \"Fahrenheit 451\".\n\nJulie Christie was initially cast as \"Linda Montog\", the novels \"Mildred Montag\". The year before, the daughter of a British/India planter and a Welsh mother, had portrayed \"Lara\", in director David Lean's epic film version of Russian author Boris Pasternak's, \"Dr. Zhivago\". She would follow this feature film with director John Schlesinger's, 1967, version of English novelist Thomas Hardy's, \"Far from the Madding Crowd\".\n\nFrancis Truffaut had interviewed both Jean Seberg and Jane Fonda, for the role of \"Clarisse\", who was not a teenager in the screenplay. However, he made an interesting decision and cast Julie Christie in the dual roles, making the relationships of the two women to \"Guy Montag\", more psychologically interesting.\n\nAbove, Julie Christie as \"Linda Montag\", and below as \"Clarisse\".\n\nOskar Werner, born in Vienna, Austria, portrayed \"Guy Montag\". He had just been part of the all-star cast in director Stanley Kramer's, 1965, version of authoress Katharine Anne Porter's, \"Ship of Fools\".\n\nCyril Cusack portrayed \"Captain Beatty\". The South African born actor had just co-starred with Sarah Mills, in 1966, \"I Was Happy Here (Time Lost and Time Remembered)\", he followed this feature with a role in the Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, 1967, version of British playwright, William Shakespeare's \"The Taming of the Shrew\".\n\nThe opening credits are all spoken not shown as printed title cards.\n\nIn a futuristic town, \"Guy Montag\" is a \"Fireman\". Whose job is to burn books in giant bonfires to enforce the government degree that books are banned, because of the evil effects of literature on the citizens. That cause them to stray away from the government-controlled societies good for them. \"Guy\" has known no other idea from the day he was born.\n\nHe lives with his wife, \"Linda\", whose life is empty, devoid of self-thought, and revolves around drugs and government controlled-television. In short, \"Linda Montag\" is the perfect citizen and emotionless wife of \"Fireman Guy Montag\".\n\n\"Guy\" meets his neighbor, a young schoolteacher named \"Clarisse\", who is the exact psychological and emotional opposite of his wife. They have a discussion about his job and she is asks if \"Guy\" has ever read a book? Additionally, for the first time in his life, he learns, from her, what a \"Fireman\" was before the society he lives in was created.\n\nAt the house of an illegal book collector, \"Captain Beatty\" talks at length about how books make people unhappy and makes them think they're better than others, which is considered anti-social.\n\nBecause of his continuing discussions with \"Clarisse\", \"Fireman Guy Montag\" hides a copy of Charles Dickens's \"David Copperfield\", before they burn the hundreds of pieces of great literature the book collector had.\n\nThat night in his home, \"Fireman Guy Montag\" discovers the words of Charles Dickens. He sits by a wall-sized, tubeless television set. At one point in the screenplay, as in the novel, \"Montag\" is listening to information through earbuds. Remember we are speaking about a 1966 motion picture, based upon a 1953 novel.\n\nNote:\n\nIn 1929, the second \"Anthony 'Buck' Rodgers\" novel by Philip Francis Nowlan. \"Airlords of Han\", was published. He also had wall-sized television sets, but you could also see and speak to another person on them. Nowlan had people using automatic paychecks sent to your bank, and the same people buying items on line with a table-top machine, payment automatically deducted from their bank accounts, and delivered by a carrier to their homes.\n\nThe following day at the house of an old woman \"Montag\" had seen with \"Clarisse\", he is shocked when she refuses to leave her house and dies in the flames of the books the firemen burn her house down with.\n\nWhile, his wife \"Linda\" feels it is more important to her own life, to be part of \"The Family\". An interactive television program that refers to her and other viewers as \"Cousins\". \"Guy's\" meetings with the freethinking \"Clarisse\" continues as he is being drawn into the world of books as his wife remains the perfect citizen of the government's society.\n\n\"Guy\" comes home to find his wife and her three friends watching \"The Family\", completely obvious to his arrival. He goes and get a book and returns to the living room.\n\nHe tells the four about the woman who \"Martyred\" herself for in the name of books and what knowledge and adventure they contain. Next, he calls the four, \"Zombies\", telling the four they are just \"Killing Time\" for the government-controlled society, instead of \"Living Life\"! The three friends start to leave, he forces them to stay, reads from the novel causing one of the friends to become emotional from the words and start to cry. The friends leave in disgust over \"Guy's\" cruelty forcing them to hear the novel.\n\nThat night, \"Guy Montag\" dreams of \"Clarisse\" and the women who died surrounded by her books. The same night, \"Clarisse's\" house is raided by firemen, but she escapes through a trapdoor in the roof provided by her uncle. \"Montag\" breaks into \"Captain Beatty's\" office looking for information about \"Clarisse\", is captured, but not punished.\n\n\"Guy\" meets with \"Clarisse\" and helps her break back into her house to search for incriminating papers about a group she calls \"The Book People\". They are a hidden group of people who have each memorized one book to keep it from disappearing.\n\nNext, \"Montag\" goes to \"Captain Beatty\" and tells him he is resigning as a fireman. However, \"Beatty\" asks him to go on one last raid, \"Guy Montag\" agrees, and finds himself at his own home.\n\n\"Linda\" walks out, telling \"Guy\" she couldn't live with his book obsession, and leaves him to be punished by the other firemen. \"Montag\" in a rage destroys his bedroom. his television, and sets fire to his books.\n\n\"Beatty\" lectures \"Guy\" about books and pulls one last one from \"Montag's\" coat, causing \"Fireman Guy Montag\" to turn a flamethrower on \"Captain Beatty\", burning him alive.\n\n\"Montag\" escapes, finds \"The Book People\" and with them, views his fake capture on television, having been staged by the government for the masses entertainment to make them believe he is dead and reading books remains a crime even for a fireman.\n\nOne time fireman \"Guy Montag\" now becomes, Edgar Allan Poe's \"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\".\n\nWhat did Ray Bradbury think about this motion picture version of his novel?\n\nAccording to the website \"Wikipedia\", without a citation to verify the complete accuracy.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_451_(1966_film)\n\nAuthor Ray Bradbury said in later interviews that, despite its flaws, he was pleased with the film. He was particularly fond of the film's climax, where the Book People walk through a snowy countryside, reciting the poetry and prose they've memorized, set to Bernard Herrmann's melodious score. He found it especially poignant and moving.\n\nHowever, in an April 22, 2009, interview in \"LA Weekly\", with Jill Stewart, Ray Bradbury is directly quoted about the motion picture as saying:\n\nThe mistake they made with the first one was to cast Julie Christie as both the revolutionary and the bored wife.\n\nOn May 12, 2018, at the Cannes France Film Festival, a new film version of \"Fahrenheit 451\", made for \"HBO Television\", premiered. Seven-days-later, on May 19, 2018, the \"HBO\" premiere took place.\n\nThe production did not go over well with the critics, fans of the author's work, and the general viewing public. In director, and co-screenplay writer Ramin Bahrani's version of the Ray Bradbury novel, the setting is now Cleveland, Ohio, sometime after the \"Second American Civil War\". In this future world, most reading is confined to the internet, now called \"The Nine\".\n\nKevin O'Keef's review in \"Variety\", May 12, 2018, explains:\n\nAll modern communication takes place on “the Nine,” where people can watch book burnings live and read emoji-fied versions of the Bible and “Moby Dick\".\n\nThe \"Firemen\", work for \"The Ministry\", a totalitarian dictatorship that blames unhappiness, mental illness, and conflicting opinions, upon reading the wrong literature.\n\nAbove, Michael Shannon portrays \"Captain Beatty\", and Michael B. Jordan portrays \"Guy Montag\". Below, Sofia Boutella portraying \"Clarisse\". There is no \"Mildred\", or similar character in this version. Nor are any of the characters drawn like in the novel.\n\n\"Clarisse's\" purpose seems only to be a means to educate the unmarried fireman, \"Guy Montag\" about the real past history of the United States and the rise of \"The Ministry\". However, Todd McCarthy, for \"The Hollywood Reporter\", May 12, 2018, notes that:\n\nAll we hear in “Fahrenheit 451” is references to a Second Civil War that left 8 million dead. Details of how the ministry rose from the ashes are scarce.\n\nhttps://variety.com/2018/tv/reviews/fahrenheit-451-review-michael-b-jordan-451-1202801285/ In this version, instead of being \"The Book People\", the book reading outcasts are called \"Eels\". Which \"The Ministry\" and \"The Firemen\" justify the term by looking upon this group, as sneaky, slimy, and disgraceful causers of chaos, hence, they're \"EELS\"!\n\n\"The Eels\", that \"Guy Montag\" will help, are taking books and encoding them into one starling's, the bird, DNA. Then the bird will fly to scientists in Canada and they will transfer the DNA to other animals, saving the books for history and create a means of retrieving them. \"Montag's\" part in the plan is to steal a transponder from the fire department so it can be attached to the starling and the Canadian scientists can locate it.\n\nIn the end, the starling makes it to Canada and a flock of other starlings, but \"Guy Montag\" is burned to death by \"Beatty\".\n\nTwo questions I have that are not answered in the screenplay. First, if Canada is considered a safe place for the starling to go, does that mean Canada is not under \"The Ministry\", and not a totalitarian country? Second, what books are being saved that the scientists in Canada wouldn't have access too?\n\nMatt Fowler wrote for the \"IGN\" website, on May 18, 2018, that this production of Ray Bradbury's novel:\n\nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/18/hbos-fahrenheit-451-review\n\nfeatures strong performances and a dancing, flickering visual flare, but all that's not enough to cover up the clunkiness of the script and the strain of reconfiguring this always relevant-yet still very 1950s-story to fit within our 2018 specifics\n\nDANDELION WINE first published in 1957\n\nAbove, the dust jacket for the first edition.\n\nThis started out as a short story in the June 1953, issue of \"Gourmet Magazine\". The first magazine devoted to food and wine, first published in January 1941.\n\nThis is the first of what become known as the \"Green Town Trilogy\". I will be speaking to the final entry in the trilogy, after I speak to the first.\n\nThe novel might be best described as a series of vignettes in the form of chapters of life in \"Green Town, Illinois, as viewed by the protagonist, 12-years-old \"Douglas Spalding (aka: Ray Bradbury)\".\n\nIn his 1974 introduction to the novel entitled: \"Just This Side of Byzantium An Introduction\", Ray Bradbury writes: https://www.soarnorthcountry.com/images/upload/f17-bradbury-byzantium-1974.pdf\n\nFirst I rummaged my mind for words that could describe my personal nightmares, fears of night and time from my childhood, and shaped stories from these.\n\nThen I took a long look at the green apple trees and the old house I was born in and the house next door where lived my grandparents, and all the lawns of the summers I grew up in, and I began to try words for all that.\n\nWhat you have here in this book then is a gathering of dandelions from all those years. The wine metaphor which appears again and again in these pages is wonderfully apt. I was gathering images all of my life, storing them away, and forgetting them. Somehow I had to send myself back, with words as catalysts, to open the memories out and see what they had to offer.\n\nSo from the age of twenty-four to thirty-six hardly a day passed when I didn't stroll myself across a recollection of my grandparents' northern Illinois grass, hoping to come across some old half-burnt firecracker, a rusted toy, or a fragment of letter written to myself in some young year hoping to contact the older person I became to remind him of his past, his life, his people, his joys, and his drenching sorrows.\n\nThe novel is set during the 1928's in a fictional town based upon his own childhood home of Waukegan, Illinois. However, in that year Ray Douglas Bradbury would have been 8-years old, not the 12, of his character of \"Douglas Spalding\".\n\nThe following is a fictional chapter listing for the novel \"Dandelion Wine\". There are no actual chapter titles in the novel, but it is a fix-up novel using old and new material. I have added my comments to the original list found at: https://isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?13569\n\nChapter One:\n\nWritten for the novel.\n\nChapter Two: \"Illumination\"\n\nThe original story first appeared in \"The Reporter\", on May 16, 1957.\n\nChapter Three: \"Dandelion Wine\n\nThis is the original 1953 short story.\n\nChapter Four: \"Summer in the Air\".\n\nThe above is the original 1956 title, but the short story appeared in a 1957 issue of \"The Saturday Evening Post\", in 1957, under the title of \"The Sound of Summer Running\".\n\nChapter Six:\n\nWritten for the novel.\n\nChapter Seven: \"The Season of Sitting\"\n\nI could only determine that the short story was written in 1951.\n\nChapters Eight: Nine, Eleven, and Thirteen:\n\nThese four chapters are based upon \"The Happiness Machine\", an article in the September 14, 1957 issue of \"The Saturday Evening Post\".\n\nChapter Ten: \"The Night\"\n\nThe original story first appeared in \"Weird Tales\", in July 1946, but major changes to it were done by Ray Bradbury for this novel.\n\nChapter Twelve: \"The Lawns of Summer\"\n\nI could only determine that the short story was written in 1952.\n\nChapter Fourteen:\n\nWritten for the novel.\n\nChapters Fifteen and Sixteen: \"Season of Disbelief\"\n\nThe original story first appeared in \"Collier's Magazine\", on November 25, 1950.\n\nChapters Seventeen and Eighteen: \"The Last, the Very Last\"\n\nI could not locate when this short story was originally published, it is also known as \"The Time Machine\". No to be confused with Ray Bradbury's, June 28, 1952, short story, \"A Sound of Thunder\", published in \"Collier's Magazine\", about time travel.\n\nChapter Nineteen: \"The Green Machine\"\n\nI could only determine that the short story was written in 1951.\n\nChapter Twenty: The Trolley\n\nThe original story first appeared in \"Good Housekeeping Magazine\", in July 1955.\n\nChapter Twenty-one and Twenty-two: \"Statues\"\n\nWritten for the novel.\n\nChapters Twenty-three and Twenty-four: \"Exorcism\"\n\nThis story is an original to the novel, but Ray Bradbury's pre-publication title was \"Magic\".\n\nChapters Twenty-five and Twenty-six: \"The Window\"\n\nThe short story first appeared in \"Collier's Magazine\", on August 5, 1950. The story is also known as \"Calling Mexico\".\n\nChapter Twenty-seven:\n\nWritten for the novel.\n\nChapters Twenty-eight and Twenty-nine: \"The Swan\"\n\nThe original story first appeared in \"Cosmopolitan Magazine\", in September 1954.\n\nChapters Thirty and Thirty-one: \"The Whole Town's Sleeping\"\n\nThis original story first appeared in \"McCall's Magazine\", in September 1950.\n\nChapter Thirty-two: \"Good-bye Grandma\"\n\nThe original story first appeared in \"The Saturday Evening Post\", in 1957. The story is also known as \"Leave Taking\".\n\nChapter Thirty-three:\n\nWritten for the novel,\n\nChapter Thirty-four: \"Tarot Witch\"\n\nWritten for the novel.\n\nChapter Thirty-five:\n\nWritten for the novel.\n\nChapters Thirty-five, Thirty-six, Thirty-seven, and Thirty-eight: \"Dinner at Dawn\"\n\nI could only determine that the short story was written in 1954.\n\nChapter Thirty-nine: \"The Magical Kitchen\"\n\nApparently, see above link, there is disagreement over the possibility that this chapter is actually part of \"Dinner at Dawn\", and not a standalone story.\n\nChapter Forty: \"Green Wine for Dreaming\"\n\nThis was written for the novel without a title. The title was created for the 1965 collection, \"Vintage Bradbury\".\n\nStage Productions:\n\nIn New York City, \"The New Phoenix Repertory Company\", performed the first stage production of \"Dandelion Wine\", on February 8, 1975. The production was under the artistic direction of Stephen Porter and Harold Prince.\n\nIn 1988, Ray Bradbury co-wrote with pop, country, and rock composer Jimmy Webb, a musical version of the novel.\n\nAnother stage production was in 1992, in Manistee, Michigan, and on opening night at the \"Ramsdell Theater\", apparently the cast was surprised by a front row audience member, Ray Bradbury.\n\nOn October 21, 2017, the Williamsburg, Virginia, players, below, performed Ray Bradbury's, \"Dandelion Wine\".\n\nRay Bradbury's play continues to be performed as of this writing.\n\nRadio Productions:\n\nIn 2006, \"The Colonial Radio Theatre on the Air\", performed the radio play, \"Dandelion Wine\", written for them by Ray Bradbury.\n\nAbove, the cover for the audio recording of the play, and below the cast performing the play.\n\nIn 2011, as a BBC Radio 4 Extra, the station broadcast a production of the Ray Bradbury radio play and that continued for the next three years. I could not locate any information if the yearly broadcasts are continuing.\n\nMotion Picture Productions:\n\nGo on line and you will find many videos on how to make \"Dandelion Wine\".\n\nGo to the website, \"Dead Line Insider\", at:\n\nhttps://deadline.com/2011/08/ray-bradbury-and-mike-medavoy-team-for-dandelion-wine-160816/\n\nYou will find Mike Fleming, Jr's, article about a proposed motion picture version of Ray Bradbury's, \"Dandelion Wine\", dated on August 19, 2011, that the 91-years-old author was excited about. Sadly, as of this writing, that proposed film for 2012, or 2013 release was never made.\n\nHowever, back in 1997, a three-hour-and-twenty-eight-minute motion picture version of Ray Bradbury's story was released. Like myself, my reader probably never saw it, because it was filmed inside one of the Soviet Union block of countries, at the time, the Ukraine, as a made-for-television-movie.\n\nThe Russian title was \"Вино из одуванчиков (Vino iz oduvanchikov)\", English translation, \"Dandelion Wine\".\n\n18-years-old, Andrei Novikov, portrayed \"Douglas Spaulding\".\n\nSergei Kuznetsov portrayed \"Tom Spaulding\".\n\nVladimir Zeldin portrayed \"Grandfather\".\n\nLera Kolegaeva portrayed \"Douglas's mother\".\n\nThe Green Town Trilogy, the First (?) Sequel:\n\nNormally a trilogy comes in chronological order, but that is not the case for the \"Green Town Trilogy\".\n\nFAREWELL SUMMER first published on October 17, 2006\n\nThe tag line on the cover reads:\n\nTHE EAGERLY ANTICIPATED SEQUEL TO DANDELION WINE\n\nThat may be true in actuality, but not to what became the trilogy. The novel would be moved to third-position and another, published much earlier to second position. It should also be noted that, like \"Dandelion Wine\", this is an autobiographical novel. The books first chapter, also entitled \"Farewell Summer\", was originally published in 1980, as one of the one-hundred short stories by Ray Bradbury in \"The Stories of Ray Bradbury\".\n\nThe novels setting is the Indian Summer of October 1929, which clearly follows the 1928's of \"Dandelion Wine\".\n\nWhat the website, \"Goodreads\" calls \"Green Town #2\",\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9620.Farewell_Summer\n\nIs described by them as:\n\nIn a summer that refuses to end, in the deceiving warmth of earliest October, civil war has come to Green Town, Illinois. It is the age-old conflict: the young against the elderly, for control of the clock that ticks their lives ever forward. The first cap-pistol shot heard 'round the town is dead accurate, felling an old man in his tracks, compelling town elder and school board despot Mr. Calvin C. Quartermain to marshal his graying forces and declare total war on the assassin, thirteen-year-old Douglas Spaudling, and his downy-checked cohorts. Doug and his cronies, however, are most worthy adversaries who should not be underestimated, as they plan and execute daring campaigns-matching old Quartermain's experience and cunning with their youthful enthusiasm and devil-may-care determination to hold on forever to childhood's summer. Yet time must ultimately be the victor, with valuable revelations for those on both sides of the conflicts. And life waits in ambush to assail Doug Spaulding with its powerful mysteries-the irresistible ascent of manhood, the sweet surrender to a first kiss-\n\nAccording to David Soyka, in his December 12, 2006, review of the novel for the website, \"Strange Horizons\":\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20071209074640/http://www.strangehorizons.com/reviews/2006/12/farewell_summer.shtml\n\nRay Bradbury had actually planned one giant story arc, tentatively called, \"Summer Morning, Summer Night\", that he was forced to split into 1957's, \"Dandelion Wine\", and this novel.\n\nDavid Soyka quotes Ray Bradbury:\n\nWhen I delivered it to my publishers they said, 'My God, this is much too long. Why don't we publish the first 90,000 words as a novel and keep the second part for some future year when it is ready to be published ---\n\nSoyka continues in his own and Bradbury's words:\n\nWhile this was during a time when the publishing business had yet to discover the \"fat fantasy novel\" in which such a word count would hardly be overly off-putting, Bradbury also acknowledges that the Summer Night part of the book that has now finally appeared in print was written \"when I was very young and had no knowledge of novels and no hope of creating a novel that was sensible. I had to wait for years for material to accumulate\"\n\nWhich brings me to the earlier novel that became the second part of the trilogy.\n\nSOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES first published on September 17, 1962\n\nAbove, the dust jacket for the first edition.\n\nThe year is not stated, the characters are different than either \"Dandelion Wine\", or \"Farewell Summer\", but the town is still \"Green Town, Illinois\".\n\nUnlike the other novels and short stories I have mentioned above, this is a truly dark novel, but it was also inspired by an event the life of the young Ray Bradbury. For that I turn to the website for the \"Smithsonian Magazine\", and an article by History Correspondent Erik Ofgang, dated March 9, 2023:\n\nhttps://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-sideshow-magician-who-inspired-ray-bradburythen-vanished-180981764/\n\nBradbury was 12 years old when his uncle, Lester Moberg, was murdered during a robbery gone wrong in October 1932. As the young Bradbury grappled with his own mortality, he was drawn to a Chicago-area performance by Mr. Electrico, who was traveling the country with a visiting circus.\n\nAccording to a 1980 essay by Bradbury, the magician sat with a sword in hand on an electric chair. Zapped with somewhere between 50,000 and 10 billion volts of electricity (the number changes depending on the retelling), his hair stood on end, and sparks leapt between his teeth. Then, Bradbury wrote, he stood and “brushed an Excalibur sword over the heads of the children, knighting them with fire. When he came to me, he tapped me on both shoulders and then the tip of my nose. The lightning jumped into me. Mr. Electrico cried, ‘Live forever!’”\n\nFrom that 1980 essay:\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/zeninartofwritin0000brad/page/60/mode/1up?q=%22excalibur%22"
