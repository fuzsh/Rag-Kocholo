        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jackie Chan have joined Rutger Hauer in the cast of Russian-Chinese fantasy adventure movie “Viy-2,” producer Alexey Petrukhin has told Variety.\n\nThe film is the sequel to the 2014 Russian box-office hit based on a horror novella by the Russian writer Nikolai Gogol. It grossed $33.2 million in Russia, and was released in multiple international territories.\n\nThe cast on “Viy-2” is led by Jason Flemyng (“Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels”), who also starred in the first film, Charles Dance, Martin Klebba and Christopher Fairbank. The director was Oleg Stepchenko, and the screenplay was by Stepchenko, Dmitry Palcev, and Petrukhin.\n\nThe movie was shot in China, and is now in post-production. The film, which is budgeted at $48 million, is expected to be released early next year.\n\nThe movie centers on English explorer Jonathan Green (Flemyng), who receives an order from Peter the Great to map the Russian Far East. “Once again he sets out for a long journey full of incredible adventures that will eventually lead him to China,” according to a statement. “The cartographer will face many breathtaking discoveries, encounter bizarre creatures, meet with Chinese princesses, and confront deadly martial-arts masters and the Dragon King.”"
