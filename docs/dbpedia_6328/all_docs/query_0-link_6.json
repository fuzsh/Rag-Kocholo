        "text": "Hello guys. I have a real treat for you, this week!\n\nPrepare yourself for a journey in the 60s’ Russia with the first Soviet-era horror movie VIY!\n\nTechnical details:\n\nWriters and Directors: Konstantin Ershov, Georgi Kropachyov (story by Nikolai Gogol)\n\nProduction: Mosfilm\n\nCast: Leonid Kuravlyov, Natalya Varley and many others.\n\n77 mins, colour\n\n(Viy on IMDb)\n\nIMDb rating: 7.5/10\n\nRotten Tomatoes rating: 80%\n\nPolenta’s rating: 3 ghosts, 2 daisies and 1/2 Harryhausen\n\nPlot:\n\nThis tale is about a seminary student who finds himself locked in a church with a beautiful dead girl for three nights, praying for her soul. Problem is, the girl happens to be a witch, and the poor -and always drunk- priest struggles to survive with only his faith and a magic circle drawn on the floor with a piece of chalk as weapons.\n\nThe film, as written above, is based on a short story by Nikolai Gogol about a charming witch that comes back from the death and tries to unleash the power of evil in the world. Reminds of anything? It’s not the first time I write a post about a movie like this. In fact, apparently, Mario Bava’s The Mask of Satan is based on the very same tale.\n\nI swear I didn’t know that, or I would have called this blog ‘All the films based on the same Russian short story’.\n\nPolenta’s comment:\n\n[with some minor SPOILERS]\n\nApart from a couple of perplexing -if not embarrassing- scenes, I found this film amazing at the very least.\n\nFirst, I must admit I know nothing of Russian culture and folk tales. I bet I would have enjoyed it much more if I had known of all the strange things that are shown in the movie. Like, for example, the old creepy witch at the beginning.\n\nIs it normal in the Russian folklore that witches use men as horses and gallop around on their back? That, by the way, is the first of the two puzzling scenes.\n\nAnyway, after the ride across the country, the ugly old witch turns herself into a stunningly beautiful girl and, only at that point, our hero runs away terrified. I don’t get it.\n\nThe other baffling moment is during the second night, when the witch tries to scare the priest out of the circle surfing around on her flying coffin. Apparently, both of the scenes appear in the original tale, so we just have to accept them and move on.\n\nI liked the frequent wibbly wobbly effect of the camera. Makes one feel a bit dizzy, maybe, but all the characters are drunk non-stop so I found it appropriate, very expressionist. And of course gives the movie a very 60’s taste, so psychedelic! It could almost be a pop music video. And the witch herself is so hippie! With her long hair, a daisy chain on her head and her fluttering gown. Not so scary, after all.\n\nOh, but let me tell you about my favourite part!\n\nThe first time the witch wakes up from the coffin, she tries to reach for the priest but she can’t touch him, blocked by the sacred circle. But she doesn’t give up easily and searches for a way in trough the invisible wall. In other words: she mimes. A cute, hippie, mime witch. And the actress did it very well, too! I was in awe, really. I had to watch that scene again.\n\nThe ending is controversial for me. Some parts are really really creepy and scary, at some point we even have some kind of skeleton monsters animated in a very Harryhausenesque stop-motion. But the real main character, the evil spirit Viy, is a bit disappointing. My very first thought was ‘Is that a pokemon?’ and the next one was ‘Am I watching Labyrinth or what?’. But please, if you haven’t seen this film yet, do it and have a look yourself.\n\nLast consideration: my timing in discovering and watching this film was close to perfection, because yesterday I learned that a remake has been done, and has been released in Russia just three days ago.\n\nFun fact: made in 1967, as I wrote above, this film is the first Soviet-era horror movie; this 2013 remake will be the very first Russian movie filmed in 3D.\n\nA Korean remake exists, too. I’m definitely going to have a look at both of them and, above all, at the original short story.\n\nThanks as usual for reading, hope you had fun, leave a reply if you want to.\n\nSee you next time!"
