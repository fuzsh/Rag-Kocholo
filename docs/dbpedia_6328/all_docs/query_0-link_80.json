The following questions will be addressed in connection with this main research focus: Which technical problems did the sound designers of the early 1930s encounter in transforming a natural human voice into an electro-acoustic voice design? What psycho-acoustic and ethno-cultural aspects of voice performance have been rated most important in the context of such transformations? By which means were the boundaries of social communities and gender displayed in early e-voice-designs? The analysis of discussions and surveys carried out by early radio magazines in Germany (Radio Amateur, Funk, Radio für alle), Russia (Radio front, Radio Vsem) and the United States (Radio broadcast; Radio service bulletin) with regard to the quality of female and male announcer voices should provide an answer to the posed questions. The first part of the study examines press materials, in which the problem of low vs. high voice pitch was discussed with regard to the semantic differentiation of hard vs. soft news in newsreels. Based on the analysis of early sound films, the second part of the study deals with the interrelationship between the voice stereotypes of radio and TV announcers on the one hand and the voice stereotypes of classical horror films (monster, scream queen) on the other hand. The purpose of this analysis is to determine the contribution of electronically reproduced voices to the emergence of mass media publicity.\"\"\"\"\"\n\nThis article focuses on public debates about the emotional quality of electronically recorded voices of early radio and TVannouncers.

The purpose of this analysis is to determine the contribution of electronically reproduced voices to the emergence of mass media publicity.\n\n\"\"A greater awareness of electro-acoustic voice media increasingly defines the day-to-day experience of the modern historical witness. This witness is able to calmly read about catastrophes while eating breakfast, but will quickly lose his appetite when he is confronted with the voices of catastrophe victims in audio or audio-visual real-time formats. Calculated strategies of “letting hear” can manipulate the individual’s sense of perception and guide it in various directions. And vice versa: by accessing electro-acoustic means of production, the contemporary individual seizes the possibility of manipulating the perception of others. By modifying amplitudes, frequencies and phase shifts, electronic “voice transformers” enable the user to model new identities by refining shrill voices or suppressing pronunciation mistakes. In order to analyze the listening experience accumulated by this new historical witness, scholars of voice must develop a suitable set of instruments. The development of such a conceptual equipment, which must take place at the disciplinary boundaries between philosophy and media philosophy, linguistics and media linguistics, literary studies and film studies, sociology and sociology of the media, history and media history, is the primary goal of this conference. The program of the conference is divided into four thematic blocks. Within the first, participants will address broader questions regarding voice transmission. In blocks two and three, presenters will focus on the communicative functions of audio and audio-visual voice formats, whereas contributions in the fourth block will emphasize transformations of vocal stereotypes in national film cultures.\"\"\n\nThe research presented in this paper has been conducted in the framework of the large sociolinguistic project aimed at describing everyday spoken Russian and analyzing the special characteristics of its usage by different social groups of speakers. The research is based on the material of the ORD corpus containing long-term audio recordings of everyday communication. The aim of the given exploratory study is to reveal the linguistic parameters, in terms of which the difference in speech between different social groups is the most evident. An exploratory subcorpus, consisting of audio fragments of spoken communication of 12 respondents (6 men and 6 women, 4 representatives for each age group, and representatives of different professional and status groups) with the total duration of 106 min and of similar communication settings, was created and fully annotated. The quantitative description of a number of linguistic parameters on phonetic, lexical, morphological, and syntax levels in each social group was made. The biggest difference between social groups was observed in speech rate, phonetic reduction, lexical preferences, and syntactic irregularities. The study has shown that the differences between age groups are more significant than between gender groups, and the speech of young people differs most strongly from the others.\n\nThe paper presents recent results of a multilevel analysis of representative corpus data, conducted in order to identify key speech parameters (lexical, morphological and syntactic) that can diagnose some social/biological characteristics of a speaker or, more broadly, a modern Russian urban sociolect. The study is based on the everyday Russian speech corpus One Speakers Day. Specific data were obtained on the analysis of the annotated subcorpus of 289,205 tokens, which includes recorded speech days of 57 men and 48 women, which were the research participants, as well as speech fragments of 87 men and 139 women, which were their interlocutors. Thus, the total number of speakers in the subsample amounts to 144 men and 187 women. The article also begs the question of Data Mining approach usability to the subcorpus and possibilities of further research using machine learning. The results obtained are important for the optimization of speech technologies systems, for theoretical underst...\n\nVoice is our main communication resource but especially is the tool more important for working on radio. Voice on radio transmits not only the explicit text, but also all the meaning and the affective dimension. Consequently, the audience’s attention to the radio message as well as understanding and assimilating of it will depend on a correct and expressive use of voice. Even in the most basic bibliography, the importance of the correct use of voice is recognized. Nevertheless, the suitable training for the broadcasters always has not a special consideration."
