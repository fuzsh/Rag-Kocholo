        "text": "A museum guide will also discuss the various characteristics of the Ferrari track where the Prancing Horse has carried out all its competition and road car tests since 1972. Likewise the Ferrari headquarters, the heart of the complex where all the Prancing Horse cars are built. The buildings and facilities are also fascinating, designed by world-leading architects of the likes of Renzo Piano, Massimiliano Fuksas, Jean Nouvel, Marco Visconti, Luigi Sturchio and Mario Cucinella, who designed the e-building inaugurated in 2024. Equally interesting is the historic part of the factory which has been meticulously preserved, not least the factory entrance which dates back to 1947.\n\nThe Panoramic Tour is completely different to the Ferrari Factory Tour as factory visits are only available to clients and F1 sponsors. Visitors are not permitted to leave the shuttle bus, take photographs or video footage during the Panoramic Tour.\n\nVisitors must remain on the bus at all times throughout the tour, and both photography and videoing are prohibited.\n\nFor further details, please read the rules for the Fiorano Track and Viale Enzo Ferrari Panoramic Tour.
