        "text": "The Ferrari Museums in Modena and Maranello: which one to choose, how to book, tips for visiting with kids.\n\nThe Ferrari Museums in Modena and Maranello are among the best car museums in Italy.\n\nThey are a treat for Ferrari lovers and car people in general and they are set out in such a way, you can enjoy them at any age.\n\nWe visited as a family of four, with varying degrees of interest in cars, and we all loved it.\n\nThe car lover in the family dubbed the place as ‘his favorite place in the whole world’.\n\nHowever, even the least interested got excited there: the cars, the power of the story, the overall experience is inspirational, easy to enjoy and great fun.\n\nThis is a visit I now recommend to everyone and today, I am sharing how to book it and how to arrange your day.\n\nThe Ferrari Museum in Modena and Maranello: what you need to know\n\nThe first thing you need to know when it comes to the Ferrari Museums is that they are not one museum but two.\n\nOne is called ‘The Enzo Ferrari Museum’ and it is in Modena city.\n\nThe other one is the Ferrari Museums and Factory and it is in Maranello, a small town about 20km out of Modena.\n\nThe two museums complement each other and you can see one or the other on their own or book a combined visit.\n\nWhich one to choose depends on what you are most interested in.\n\nAt a glance, I recommend you:\n\nVisit the Enzo Ferrari Museum in Modena if you love classic cars and want to see where it all started\n\nVisit the Maranello Museum if you love the Ferrari brand and F1. This is also the best museum to visit if you want to take a guided tour of the Ferrari factory estate.\n\nLet’s look at this more in detail.\n\nWhich Ferrari Museum is best? How to choose\n\nIf you have the time, I highly recommend you visit both museums.\n\nThe two are rather different from one other and have a different take on the whole Ferrari experience.\n\nThe Enzo Ferrari Museum in Modena\n\nThe Enzo Ferrari Museum is in Modena city and develops around the original Enzo Ferrari workshops.\n\nThe museum has an older part, with Enzo Ferrari’s first office, and attached to it there is a beautiful, modern and futuristic-looking dome with a large display of classic cars.\n\nThe place is fantastic: the large showroom has many beautiful car models from different times, there are some incredible engines on display and there is a photo booth where you can be photographed while driving a Ferrari!\n\nAt regular intervals, a short film tells the story of Enzo Ferrari and explains how the brand came to be.\n\nThe museum is not very big and it is easy to visit in about an hour. As well as the showroom, there is a merchandising shop and restroom facilities.\n\nThere is no restaurant on-site; however, since the museum is in Modena city, it is easy to find places for lunch nearby.\n\nYou can get here to / from the station in about 10 minutes on foot.\n\nThe Ferrari Museum in Maranello\n\nThe Ferrari Museum in Maranello is very different from the one in Modena.\n\nLocated about 20km out of the city, the museum is more focussed on the Ferrari Brand as it developed for one-off models and F1 endeavors and feels a lot more like an immersive experience than just a museum.\n\nThe whole place is designed with the red and black Ferrari brand colors and Ferrari logos and touches are everywhere.\n\nIn the various rooms, you see cars, displays of photos, videos and all the Ferrari trophies and F1 cars.\n\nIn the ‘Victory Room’ you are literally surrounded by the F1 winning cars and you can see the names of the pilots and their victory cups.\n\nThe whole thing is captivating even if you do not like cars.\n\nThe place has made an incredible job and getting people on board with the idea of Ferrari being more than cars and you feel like you are part of a big successful family.\n\nAs well as seeing the museum displays, here you can also participate in two main activities:\n\nFerrari driving simulator: for an extra charge, visitors tall more than 150cm can experience the Ferrari simulator. This is a 7-minute experience and you get to sit in a car and ‘drive’ along a circuit of your choice.\n\nOur son did this and said it was similar to a videogame experience, albeit ‘bigger and better’.\n\nFor it, you sit in a car shell in front of a wrap-around screen. With the help of a Ferrari Museum warned, you learn how to use the steering wheel and gear, pick a circuit to drive and you are ready!\n\nThe experience doesn’t require a headset nor goggles and others can watch you while you drive.\n\nPanoramic Bus Tour of the Factory: for an extra charge, you can hop on bus and get a guided tour of the Ferrari factory estate.\n\nThis tour is highly informative and leads you inside the Ferrari Factory village, where you see the outside of the plants and workshops and the wind gallery where they test the cars.\n\nThis is also where Ferrari owners bring their cars for checks so, while you bus around, you will see many Ferrari zooming around the place in all possible colors!\n\nThis tour also brings you to see the local race track; however, racing regulations do not allow for practice on the track, therefore you do not actually see cars in action her\n\nThe Maranello Museum also has a merchandising shop on-site, restrooms facilities and a cafe on site.\n\nImmediately outside of it, you have several restaurants and cafes. It is worth noticing that the Ferrari-themed restaurant ‘The Paddock’ is not here but in Maranello Village, which is a short drive away.\n\nVisitin the Ferrari Museums of Modena and Maranello with kids\n\nWe visited the Modena and Maranello museums with our two children: a car-loving 11-year-old and a car-uninterested 9-year-old.\n\nThey both loved the day.\n\nWe started with a visit to Maranello and we all immediately felt the buzz and excitement of the place.\n\nUnsure about the simulator, we hadn’t booked it but quickly got sucked into the desire to treat our son to it.\n\nThere was no queue at the simulator desk and there were several children who had just finished and were enthusiastic about it, which reassured us it was suitable for their age.\n\nThe museum desk person was lovely with our son and they had a grand old chat about circuits while he explained how to use the commands.\n\nThe simulation itself only lasts 7 minutes and at 25 Euro is all but cheap. However, it stayed as one of the highlights of our son’s day and you can take photos of them driving, which is an incredible memento for them.\n\nThere is a minimum height requirement to do it and this is strict as it has to do with the size of the car.\n\nMy son just about made the height and was able to just about hit the pedals: any shorter would have been technically impossible to drive.\n\nIf you are unsure about height, I recommend you only decide about the simulator on the day as they will be able to advise.\n\nAfter the visit to the museum we went to a nearby cafe/restaurant (not branded, just beside the museum) andf then we joined the factory tour.\n\nThe factory tour is the most informative part of the visit albeit possibly the least impressive.\n\nYou hop on a bus and a guide brings you to the factory estate (no photo allowed there): you pass the main gate and you are driven around the factory lot, seeing the different paint/tire etc workshops from outside, and getting a taste of what it may feel like working at Ferrari, passing the company canteen etc.\n\nIn the estate, you also see the outside of the wind gallery which they use to test for aero dynamicity.\n\nThe highlight of this part of the tour is the guide who gives an incredible amount of information about Ferrari cars and F1 regulations.\n\nThis part of the tour was excellent for my car-obsessed son but too information-driven for my daughter who mostly just enjoyed sitting on the bus and seeing the Ferrars from the windows!\n\nIf you have a car lover, highly recommend this part of the tour. If you are here with a little one, however, or just want to see the beautiful cars, you can stick to the museum only.\n\nHow to visit the Ferrari Museum in Modena and Maranello on the same day\n\nIt is possible to visit the Ferrari Museums in Modena and Maranello on the same day. however, it takes a little bit of planning.\n\nSince the two are in different areas, you will need to book both entrances, make arrangements for transport and you will also need to separately book the bus tour if doing.\n\nYou can do all this by yourself on the Ferrari Museums Ticketitn platform or you can do what we did: send an email to Vivara Viaggi their travel agency partner, and get them to book it for you!\n\nIn our case, the day worked perfectly and it entailed:\n\n10.40 Shuttle from Modena train station to Maranello Museum\n\n11.15 Arrival and self-guided visit to the museum\n\nSimulator experience (booked last minute on site)\n\nLunch (own time, no booking needed)\n\n13.00 Bus tour from Maranello Museum to factory lot\n\n14.45 Shuttle to Enzo ferraru Museum in Modena\n\n15.25 Self guided museum visit\n\nSince we were staying in Bologna, we then just easily walked back to the station to get back to the city. we were home in the late afternoon.\n\nHow to book the Ferrari Museums\n\nThere are several ways to book your visit to the Ferrari Museums.\n\nFrom the Museums, Websites (combined tickets available) >> click here <<<\n\nVia Vivara Viaggi >>> click here <<<, this is the museum’s official partner, recommended on the museum website. They are perfect if you don’t have your own transport and want to also get tickets for the Ferrari shuttle.\n\nWhere to stay to visit the Ferrari Museums of Modena and Maranello\n\nThere are many options when it comes to accommodation, depending on budget and plans for the other day so your trip.\n\nPlease note: this post contains affiliate links. Should you make a purchase through them, we will make a small commission on qualifying purchases at no extra cost to you.\n\nSome you may like are:\n\nHotel Maranello Village: A Ferrari-themed property, this hotel is the equivalent of an in-park hotel at a theme park.\n\nThe hotel and ‘The Paddock’ restaurant and perfect if you want to live and breathe Ferrari for the entire duration of your stay. Please note: this hotel is a 5-minute drive from the museum: own transport recommended.\n\nCasa Palestro in Modena: this is a lovely apartment in Modena city, close to the station and the Enzo Ferrari Museum, good for larger families (sleeps 5)\n\nStarhotel Excelsior Bologna: if you prefer to base yourself in Bologna and come for the day (like we did!), we found the Starhotel Excelsior in Bologna to be excellent.\n\nThey have family rooms, excellent breakfast and an excellent location right in front of the train station. Our top pick.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this quick guide to the Ferrari Museums in Modena and Maranello and the review of our experience helped you plan your day at best. Safe travel planning!"
