        "text": "Ferrari\n\nHome Ferrari Lamborghini Porsche Jaguar Bugatti\n\nFerrari S.p.A. is an Italian sports car manufacturer based in Maranello, Italy. Founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1929, as Scuderia Ferrari, the company sponsored drivers and manufactured race cars before moving into production of street-legal vehicles as Ferrari S.p.A. in 1947. In 1969, Fiat S.p.A. became a shareholder of Ferrari and now its majority owner. Throughout its history, the company has been noted for its continued participation in racing, especially in Formula One, where it has had great[citation needed] success. Ferrari road cars are generally seen as a symbol of speed, luxury and wealth.\n\nFerrari has been manufacturing annoyingly outstanding cars since 1947, becoming a major player in all professional racing events and staying ahead of the majority of competitors ever since. Founded by rebel spirited Enzo Ferrari, the story of the famous Scuderia is that of dedication, distinction and really, really fast cars. Having become enamored with driving and car engineering in his youth and having gained substantial race car test driving experience through a series of jobs for different companies in Turin in Milan, Enzo set the base of the red-flagged road legend. Initially, the Scuderia appeared as a conglomerate of sponsors and trainers for Alfa Romeo whom Enzo had worked for as head of the racing department during the late '30s.\n\nHis ties to Alfa Romeo would only last for 2 years as Enzo parted from the company upon learning of their plans to take over his Scuderia. Still bound to racing restrictions stated in his contract, Enzo had little to do except becoming a temporary supplier of tools and accessories for producers like Piaggio and RIV. After moving to Maranello in 1943, Enzo built the Tipo 815 which was the actual first Ferrari and not the 125 Sport as it is mistakingly believed. The latter was indeed much more popular than the first. Propelled by a 1.5 L V12 engine, the raw, beautifully unfinished model set the landmark for a future highly acclaimed racing dynasty. However, it would not be easy to rise to the rank it holds today. Following several tensions between Ferrari's wife and Scuderia manager, Romolo Tavoni, a lot of key employess were fired, including Tavoni and some top engineers.\n\nHis ties to Alfa Romeo would only last for 2 years as Enzo parted from the company upon learning of their plans to take over his Scuderia.

Following several tensions between Ferrari's wife and Scuderia manager, Romolo Tavoni, a lot of key employess were fired, including Tavoni and some top engineers.\n\nDuring the mid-60s , Ferrari saw a set back delivered by the Ford GT mark 2 who abruptly ended Scuderia's winning streak at Le Mans. After safely emerging from a FIA bill banning all cars above 3000cc from entering LeMans and having had to pause the 312 P model project, Ferrari would make acquaintance with a new contender. The menace came from Porsche who dominated racing in the early 70's , leaving Ferrari dreaming about the title. Later however, Ferrari would make a spectacular comeback withe their later 312PB model. 1973 saw Ferrari retire form sports car racing to focus entirely on F1. After a life caught between struggle, jet-setting and winnings, Enzo Ferrari passed away a age 90. His demise cemented the maturity of the Ferrari myth as well as it helped boost sales and the overall value of the brand.\n\nPresently, Ferrari is part of the Fiat group who owns the majority of the company's share. As for Ferrari's modern days of racing, they are far from being over. Between 2000 and 2004, Ferrari pilot Michael Schumacher went straight for world domination and won the World Driver's championship four times in a row. Subsequently, Ferrari was the keeper of the Constructor's Championship for 5 years (1999-2004). Ferrari has long shed the mantle of sports-car status, becoming an icon while Enzo Ferrari was unofficially appointed Patron Saint of Sports Cars. Curiously enough, Ferrari never made use of advertising, being a brand built entirely though tradition and quality.\n\nFast Fact!\n\nThe 1962-1964 Ferrari 250 GTO is often called the most sought after car in the world. Only 39 were produced.\n\nFerrari\n\n458 Italia\n\n458 Spider\n\nFerrari 360\n\n360 Spider\n\n360 Modena\n\nChallenge Stradale\n\nF430\n\nF430 Spider\n\nF430 Scuderia\n\nFerrari Enzo\n\nEnzo FXX\n\nSpecial Editions\n\nBarchetta\n\n612 Scaglietti\n\nSuperamerica\n\n599 GTB Fiorano\n\nBack Next\n\nFor more info try Ferrari."
