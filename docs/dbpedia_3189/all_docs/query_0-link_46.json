        "meta_description": "Maranello is a town in the region of Emilia-Romagna in Northern Italy. It is worldwide known as the home of Ferrari and Scuderia Ferrari Formula One racing team. Maranello was also home to coachbuilding firm Carrozzeria Scaglietti, owned by Ferrari. The Ferrari factory is off-limits, unless you are able to arrange a tour through a Ferrari dealership. Preference for those tours is given to Ferrari owners and 30 days notice is usually required. But the Galleria Ferrari which boasts both historical and new Ferrari road and F1 cars is worth seeing. You can also see a part of the Fiorano test circuit from the roadside when coming into town - if there is testing going on, expect to see a lot of tifosi (Ferrari fans) around.",

        "text": "Guglielmo Marconi has been described as Italy’s best-known inventor and scientist apart from Galileo Galilei. But who was the man and how’d he reach that level of fame?\n\nA passion project for Massimo Bottura and Lara Gilmore, Casa Maria Luigia is the ultimate gastronomic getaway, housed in a dreamy 18th-century farmhouse on the outskirts of Modena.\n\nBologna’s Art Nouveau-accented cinema has reopened after a nearly two-decade closure, with updated programming made to pull streaming-era spectators off their couches and back to the movies.\n\nChefs Massimo Bottura (Osteria Francescana) and Niko Romito (Reale) are tied for the top spot in the new 2024 guide from leading Italian food and wine publisher, Gambero Rosso.\n\nYou don’t need fancy pasta-making equipment to create this specialty shape from the small town of Bobbio in the Piacenza province of Emilia-Romagna — but you do need a knitting needle.\n\nTwo specialties of Italy, panforte (“strong bread”) and its predecessor panpepato (“peppered bread”), are not breads at all, but closer to fruitcakes featuring many spices.\n\nI wonder if someone may be able to help me ? In 2005 we purchased some land and property. The intention was to set up an Agri Tourism. We were unable to stop the infiltration of hunters onto the land and eventually abandoned the venture in 2007.\n\nCiao a tutti\n\nMight anyone have a flat/house a family of three-four could rent between 1 Sept-30 Nov 2023 in Modena? I’m a researcher on sabbatical visiting from New Zealand. Options like Airbnb and Stayz are ridiculously expensive for such a long period.\n\nGrazie mille,"
