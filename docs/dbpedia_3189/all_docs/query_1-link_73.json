Typically, participants need to be at least 16 years old and 150 cm (approximately 4 feet 11 inches) tall to use the simulators.

How Long Should You Plan to Spend at Each Museum?\n\nYou should plan to spend about 1 to 1.5 hours at each museum to fully explore the exhibits. The Enzo Ferrari Museum in Modena can typically be seen in about an hour, especially if you’re primarily interested in the history of the brand and Enzo Ferrari himself. The Ferrari Museum in Maranello, with its broader range of exhibits and interactive displays, may take a bit longer—up to 1.5 hours or more, depending on your level of interest. If you’re planning to take part in additional activities, such as the factory tour or simulators, consider adding extra time to your visit.\n\n3.

During the tour, you’ll see key areas of the factory, such as the building where engines are installed in the cars, and possibly even catch a glimpse of Ferrari cars being tested on the track.
