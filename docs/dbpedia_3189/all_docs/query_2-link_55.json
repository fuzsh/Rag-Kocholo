It is not subject to the FIA limits that apply to testing at GP or other race circuits. Is that the case? Can anyone confirm or correct that?\n\nNo, that is NOT correct, same FIA limits are on all the team where ever thay test.\n\nOriginally posted by BRG\n\nOK, if that is the case, why do Ferrari use Fiorano so much? I imagine it has some extra telemetery gear, and it is cheaper being so close to home (no plane fares, hotel bills etc) but it is a bit Mickey Mouse, even by Tilke standards and it isn't a current GP track. What is the advantage from using it rather than Barcelona, Valencia, Ricard etc?\n\nOriginally posted by Mickey\n\nIndeed, and especially in the Pianura Padana, the plains where Maranello lies. You can pretty much expect it to be foggy every other day for about six months of the year.\n\nFerrari also own Mugello, which is a few kilometers south in Tuscany. Mugello doesn't lie in the plains but in the Appennini mountains, where it often rains and it also snows a few times every winter.\n\nFerrari recently tested at Vallelunga, near Rome, for the first time in 25 years or so. The weather there is better and milder, so I expect to see them there more often during the winter.\n\nOriginally posted by Viktor\n\nAlso have in mind that Fiorano is not only a F1 test track for Ferrari but its there test track for the production cars also, just like BMW, Ford, Toyota and Mercedes all have there own test tracks for there production cars.\n\n/Viktor\n\nOriginally posted by Viktor\n\nI dont know much about car testing fecilitis but my guess is that normal car makers (BMW, Mercedes, Honda etc) dont have race tracks as there testing fecilitis but fecilitis that more simulate the conditions that there cars will face out on the streets, hills, bumps etc etc, not racing on a track and that my not sute a F1 car. I know that when Wirdheim testen in Belgium at a Ford fecility it was only straight line testing.\n\n/Viktor"
