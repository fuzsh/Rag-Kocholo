        "text": "This is the factory where Ferraris are born. Housed in the location originally chosen by company founder Enzo Ferrari in 1947, the 165,000-square-metre plant, in Maranello, Italy, produces 8,400 cars a year and employs 1,300 workers. Every car that has ever borne the famous Prancing Horse was painstakingly assembled here – and Ferrari wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\nEvery Ferrari takes three months to complete. The first and most critical stage is the casting of the engine, which takes place in the plant’s in-house foundry. The completed parts are then delivered to the assembly line, where 147 engines are hand-built every day.\n\nOnce the engine is completed, two robots connect the Ferraris’ valve mechanics – this is the only part of the process not done by hand. “The robots work so closely together that we call them Romeo and Juliet,” says Vincenzo Regazzoni, the company’s chief manufacturing officer.\n\nTo mark its 70th anniversary, Ferrari invited WIRED inside to watch the key stages of the manufacturing process, from start to finish.\n\nAssembly Line\n\nTechnicians in the 21,000m2 Maranello line attach mechanical parts to the inside of each Ferrari, such as this 488 GTB, before adding wheels, bumpers and windscreens. Once the car reaches the end of the line, the interiors are installed and the engine is tested.\n\nV8 engine assembly\n\nThe V8 assembly line consists of 32 stations; employees each work on one phase of the process. Ferrari’s V8 engines are assembled separately to V12s – the latter are more complex and require additional human attention, so get their own line.\n\nGTC4Lusso T V8\n\nThis is a V8 engine destined for a Ferrari GTC4Lusso T, a four-seater model that has rear-wheel drive, as opposed to all-wheel drive. Aimed at urban drivers, the engine isn’t as loud as the larger V12, but it has been tuned to produce a similarly appealing sound.\n\nFactory mechanics\n\nEach car frame (this is a 488 Spider) is held by an individual mechanical lift, made from steel hooks. These are used to move the car from one station to another, rotating the chassis and automatically adjusting it to the height appropriate to the task.\n\nDoor assembly\n\nThe doors of all Ferraris are made from aluminium, and are pressed and cut at the Scaglietti factory in nearby Modena, 22km from Ferrari’s main facility. The doors are only attached to a completed car body once it has reached the end of the production line.\n\nPropulsion unit\n\nThis is where the engine, transmission and suspension systems are mounted on to the cars’ underbodies. The engine is removed from the automatic guided vehicle (AGV) that has transported it through the production line, and attached to the car body.\n\nInternal mechanics\n\nTwo robots, Romeo and Juliet, fuse the valve seats that will go into the engines – a job too intricate for humans. Romeo picks up cylinder heads and warms them with compressed air; Juliet dips aluminium rings into liquid nitrogen. The parts are then joined together.\n\nThis article was originally published by WIRED UK\n\nBack to BASIC—the Most Consequential Programming Language in the History of Computing\n\nCoding was a preserve of elites, until BASIC hit the streets.\n\nCraig Wright Faces Perjury Investigation Over Claims He Created Bitcoin\n\nBy order of a UK judge, Craig Wright can no longer claim he is the creator of bitcoin and now faces the prospect of criminal charges.\n\nHuge Microsoft Outage Caused by CrowdStrike Takes Down Computers Around the World\n\nA software update from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike appears to have inadvertently disrupted IT systems globally.\n\nNew Jersey’s $500 Million Bid to Become an AI Epicenter\n\nThe Garden State has enacted a hefty new tax credit specifically for AI businesses. But tax incentives—particularly for data centers—don’t always create a lot of jobs.\n\nZombie Alt-Weeklies Are Stuffed With AI Slop About OnlyFans\n\nBeloved alt-weeklies like the Village Voice have started publishing what appears to be AI-generated clickbait about OnlyFans.\n\nYou Won’t Believe What Car Headlights Have in Store\n\nNew technology and a drive toward electrified powertrains have converged to create a flashy new car-lighting landscape. What comes next could be an international light language.\n\nThe Metaverse Was Supposed to Be Your New Office. You’re Still on Zoom\n\nTech founders painted a vision of employees clocking into virtual workplaces. But the adoption of VR at work has been slow.\n\nAI Is Heating the Olympic Pool\n\nA data center in Paris has been hooked up to the energy system heating the Olympic pool. But critics say that projects recycling data centers’ excess heat are a distraction from the real environmental costs of AI."
