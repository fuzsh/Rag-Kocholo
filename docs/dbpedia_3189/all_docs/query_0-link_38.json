        "text": "The main significance between the two was that the Ferrari hq/factory was once in the city of modena, and then moved to the city of maranello recently. Think thats right, might be backwards though, but generally it.\n\nQuote biography.com\n\n\"Racing-car designer, born in Modena, N Italy. He became a racing driver in 1920 (with Alfa-Romeo), founded the company which bears his name (1929), and was its president until 1977. In 1940 he began designing his own cars. Since 1951, the marque has been a major presence at Grand Prix races.\"\n\nso modena is his birthplace\n\nA lot of you folks may already know this, but the link between Maranello and Modena has a lot to do with the way Italian territories are subdivided and associated geographically. The Ferrari factory resides in Maranello, but it's directly associated to Modena, the largest nearby city, because Maranello is in the province of Modena. This is how smaller towns are referenced in Italy, and it's a little like the administrative subdivisions you have in the USA with counties, I believe.\n\nOn a side note, you will no doubt have noticed that in the older (pre-Euro) license plates the letters \"MO\" appear at the beginning, MO standing for Modena, the province where the car was registered. (In the Euro plates it is much smaller and at the right edge)\n\nI agree that the smaller cities are refrenced by the bigger one's but as far as provinces working like counties, I would say you are referring to Reggio E'milia.\n\nThat is how I understood it when I lived there. Just my 2 pennys\n\nEmilia Romagna is a region in Italy...\n\nThe capital of this region is called Bologna...\n\nModena is a province in the region of Emilia Romagna...\n\nModena (pop. 175.000) is also the name of the capital of this province...\n\nMaranello (pop. 15.800) is a much smaller town located about 16km south of the city of Modena...\n\nModena is indeed the birthplace of Enzo Ferrari... he founded Scuderia Ferrari here in 1929 (Alfa Romeo cars racing activities until 1938). Later, Enzo Ferrari split with Alfa Romeo and founded Auto Avio Costruzioni, in the old Scuderia Ferrari headquarters.\n\nIn 1943 the workshops moved from Modena to Maranello.\n\nAfter the war, the company changed its name to Ferrari and went on to design the 125 Sport, a 12-cylinder, 1500 cc car which Franco Cortese drove on the Piacenza circuit on May 11, 1947.\n\nCiao, Alexander\n\nThe factory was bombed anyway because they were making machined parts for the war. Damaged extensively, it was the scene of the fateful meeting between Enzo and Luigi Chinetti, who had travelled from New York..\n\nLiugi urged Enzo to renew his efforts in the automotive world, when asked \"Who would buy them?\" in the war ravaged European economy, Chinetti responded with an order for twenty five cars...for America!\n\nThe fates of these two men, would be forever after intertwined....until their deaths many years later.\n\nYou can tell by the size of the blue dots that Modena is significantly larger!"
