        "text": "Italian car manufacturer Ferrari is expanding its range of offerings in an effort to increase its customer base beyond those that love its sleek, sporty cars. The iconic prancing horse logo that has long been associated with high-powered luxury sports cars has made its debut on the catwalk and simultaneously opened a restaurant.\n\nEarlier this month, members of the Italian style world were admitted to the Ferrari headquarters in the small Italian town of Maranello. There, what is usually an assembly line for the manufacturer’s famous cars had become a runway, down which high-fashion models stalked to show off the new fashion line.\n\nIt was Ferrari’s first high-fashion collection and an ambitious foray away from luxury car company to luxury lifestyle brand\n\nFor years, Ferrari has granted leases for other companies to produce merchandise adorned with their logo: Clothing, of course, being the main product. Now, of course, the company is bringing all Ferrari fashion in-house and giving it somewhat more of a luxury feel.\n\nTaking the design process in-house and upmarket, Ferrari has hired Armani and Pal Zilieri alumn, Rocco Iannone, as creative director. The brand has also shut down the majority of its existing licencing deals. Those that will remain under the watchful eye of Iannone are the more high-end collaborations: Puma for sneakers, Ray-Ban for sunglasses and Richard Mille for watches.\n\nFerrari is at pains to insist that this is not a side project, rather this is a completely new direction for the brand. The parent company, Exor, has increasingly been leaning towards fashion as a lead product of late—it bought a majority stake in an Hermès brand in December and 24 per cent of Christian Louboutin in March.\n\nThis recent move may put Exor in the position of being Italy’s answer to French conglomerates LVMH and Kering, who are generally considered the biggest names of luxury in the world.\n\nThe fashion exhibited at Ferrari's launch show was distinctively Ferrari—with the brand’s red-and-yellow colour scheme, images of cars and seatbelts working as belts—and John Elkann, the interim CEO of Ferrari and CEO of Exor, is confident that consumers will make the leap from a $30 prancing horse-branded cap to a $1,800 jacket with the same logo.\n\n“There are a lot of people already buying Ferrari-linked products, right?” Elkann said. “So if I give them something better, why wouldn’t they buy it?”\n\nThink of it as something for Ferrari fans who can’t yet afford the $300,000 car, we suppose, but Iannone admits there were challenges to that approach.\n\n“From an aesthetic point of view, in the beginning we have to be very literal with symbols and anatomy in order to legitimise our design territory,” he said.\n\n\"Given the kind of scale you need to be profitable in luxury, I don't think this will be accretive to Ferrari's margins, which are quite high already,\" said Susy Tibaldi, luxury analyst at Swiss bank UBS.\n\nThe fashion line will be on sale at Luisaviaroma later this month, but Ferrari’s own storefronts are being renovated to reflect the new direction for the brand and will also have a fashion section.\n\nAnd it doesn't stop there.\n\nAll while launching the fashion line, Ferrari has simultaneously undertaken the reopening of the restaurant, Ristorante Cavallino, in Maranello. Across from the brand's headquarters, founder Enzo Ferrari famously used to dine there with friends and Formula 1 stars. Now helmed by triple Michelin-starred chef Italian chef Massimo Bottura, it's yet another cornerstone of Ferrari’s new lifestyle brand strategy."
