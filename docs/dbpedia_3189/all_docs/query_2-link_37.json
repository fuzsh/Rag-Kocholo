        "text": "The Pinnacolo Maranello is an Italian 2-door Berlinetta manufactured by Pinnacolo in Pacifico 2.\n\nThis 'retro thrill seeker' can only be accessed and driven if the user has joined the UrbanSector Roblox Group.\n\nSpecifications\n\nThe Pinnacolo Maranello has 471 HP and weighs 3000 pounds (1361 kilograms). The specifications of this retro supercar are an impeccable match to the Ferrari F40 as the power output is the same to its European spec and its in-game basis, weighing 18 pounds (8 kilograms) less than the US version. The top speed of the Maranello can reach up to 191 MPH (307 KM/H) while its real-world counterpart (both US and European specs), as according to Road & Track, can reach 196 MPH (315 KM/H) while according to Car and Driver, tops out at 197 MPH (317 KM/H), being 5 miles per hour (8 kilometers per hour) and 6 miles per hour (10 kilometers per hour) faster respectively.\n\nTrivia\n\nThe name 'Maranello' originated from Maranello, a province of Modena in Emilia-Romagna, Northern Italy, it is also home to Ferrari and its Formula 1 racing team, Scuderia Ferrari.\n\nPart of the Pinnacolo Maranello's description reading \"You've seen it on bedroom posters\" is referring to the Ferrari F40 being popular to the point where it appeared on many magazine covers and children's bedroom wall posters in the 80s.\n\nAnother part of the vehicle's description reading \"a total disregard for drivers safety\" is referring the F40 as an analog vehicle, a type of vehicle that relies on its drivers' skill.\n\nAn additional part of the vehicle's description saying \"the Maranello is possibly the world's fastest casket\" is once again in reference to the F40. Just like the Porsche Carrera GT, it is notorious for many accidents. Such as the Swiss Hill Climb Event where it collided with a barrier, damaging the car. In Japan, it was caught on fire at the Hakone Turnpike route.\n\nThe vehicle itself also received some feedbacks, such as in 1988, Ferrari invited journalists from the American Magazine, Automobile Magazine and the British Car Magazine to test the F40 at their home track, such as the Fiorano Circuit as well as bringing a Porsche 959 along for comparison. where their overall verdict was that the Porsche 959 was the better car than the F40. Richard Hammond, one of the former hosts for Top Gear in 2012 described the F40 \"as visceral and edgy\", and for the 959, \"refined and sophisticated\". Lastly, Car and Driver called the car a “mix of sheer terror and raw excitement”, where they also claimed that the most fun part of the F40 was accelerating at 15 MPH (24 KMH), labeling the experience as “pure terror” due to the poor rear view while attempting to merge lanes on a busy freeway. Due to this, merging the vehicle required “leaps of faith.” The car was then found unfit for daily road use.\n\nThe car was initially introduced as a Server Booster car which used to be obtainable through boosting the UrbanSector Discord server. However, the car was removed due to concerns of new Roblox Terms of Use/Community Rules and later on, was re-added to the game as an update to commemorate 500k group members, being reintroduced as a Group Exclusive Vehicle."
