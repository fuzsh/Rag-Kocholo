        "text": "Lively town surrounded by magnificent hills reachable through historic roads that offer enchanting glimpses of the landscape and delicious gastronomic landings.\n\nLocated just over 20 km from our farmhouse, Maranello is a charming and lively town surrounded by magnificent hills that can be reached via historic roads that offer enchanting glimpses of the landscape and delicious gastronomic destinations. In particular, its somewhat improbable landscape is striking, where gullies and chimneys, woods and enormous expanses of tiles, agriculture and livestock coexist with the most advanced industry. Its history has distant origins, in fact, archaeological finds document this history at least from the Bronze Age or even from much earlier times, as evidenced by the remains of the Terramare di Gorzano or the Cumarola necropolis dating back to the Eneolithic. It is known with certainty that people of Ligurian origin lived there who were subjected by the Roman legions between 189 and 179 BC.\n\nMaranello is famous throughout the world as the city of Ferrari. Here, after the Second World War and precisely in 1943, Enzo Ferrari from Modena founded the car manufacturer of the same name which in a short time became one of the most prestigious in the world. Since then, the history of Maranello has been strongly linked to that of the Ferrari company: from the industrial development of the 1950s and 1960s up to the present day. Enthusiasts and sports enthusiasts come to Maranello from all over the world to visit the Ferrari Museum, which tells about the Ferrari of today and tomorrow, sinking its roots into the extraordinary history of the Prancing Horse. The permanent exhibition dedicated to Formula 1 and the World Championships is joined by five rooms offering thematic exhibitions of notable interest. The Wind Tunnel designed by Renzo Piano is part of the Ferrari factories: in the tunnel of the tunnel the cars are tested on a moving carpet synchronized with the speed of the wind.\n\nAmong the other monuments and places of interest in Maranello, the following should be mentioned: the Parish Church of San Biagio, built between 1894 and 1903, with an imposing bell tower erected between 1900 and 1913; the small and picturesque Castle, built around the year 1000 by a noble family from Marano, the Arardini or Araldini; the Torre della Strega, i.e. the monumental remains of an ancient tower built between the 13th and 15th centuries AD; the Romanesque parish church of Fogliano, of which there is evidence from the year 963; and the parish church of SS. Pietro e Paolo Apostoli of Torre Maina, which originated in the 10th century as a possession of the Benedictine monastery of S. Pietro in Modena.\n\nIn addition to the Ferrari, Maranello is also known for its good cuisine, in fact, in this area it is possible to taste delicious products and typical dishes, among which the most famous Parmigiano Reggiano, Traditional Balsamic Vinegar, the Campanina Apple, the Chestnut honey from the Modena Apennines, the Gnocco Fritto, the delicious focaccia called “Tigella” and the Modena liqueur par excellence, the Nocino."
