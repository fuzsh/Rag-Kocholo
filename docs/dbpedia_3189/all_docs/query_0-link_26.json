        "text": "Ferrari is considered one of the most prestigious car manufacturers in the world. The Maranello-based company saw the first car come out of its factories in 1947 and certainly owes its initial glory to Enzo Ferrari, called \"the Drake\", who with his team collects immediately amazing successes, helping to create the \"Ferrari myth\" all over the world. The extraordinary momentum is reflected in a historic phrase by Enzo Ferrari: «For me, the most important victory is the one I still have to achieve».\n\nFerrari still has its headquarters in the historic headquarters in Maranello, which has always hosted all the design and production activities and is present all over the world. You can visit the Ferrari Museum in Maranello and the Enzo Ferrari Museum in Modena. The Ferrari Museum in Maranello hosts a permanent exhibition and large exhibition areas that periodically propose new and important exhibitions dedicated to current issues or great moments of Ferrari history. The Museum also houses temporary exhibitions representing the company’s history, actors, venues and competitions. You can immerse yourself in the history of the brand, among the extraordinary and victorious achievements of the Prancing Horse. A path suitable for all people, with any need."
