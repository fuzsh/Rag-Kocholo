        "text": "MARANELLO, Italy  To walk through the back gate of the Ferrari automotive works here and stroll down Viale Enzo Ferrari is to enter a museum of architecture. To the left is a wind tunnel designed by the Italian architect Renzo Piano, a soaring tangle of immense gray tubes and cubes where Ferrari’s ear-splitting, nerve-tickling, expensive automobiles are tested for aerodynamic properties.\n\nTo the right is the finishing plant for engine blocks and other components, designed by Marco Visconti  three sets of huge glass blocks floating on greenery.\n\nFarther down is the sprawling new assembly hall, designed by Jean Nouvel, the French architect who won the Pritzker Prize this year, in gleaming metal and mirrored glass. One side faces a masonry wall of the old Ferrari works, erected in the 1940s by Enzo Ferrari, who started building his sports cars after World War II. In the evening, the ruddy color of the old wall is illuminated, casting an eerie red glow on Mr. Nouvel’s creation.\n\n“We had three goals,” said Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, Ferrari’s president, who began commissioning star architects, beginning with Mr. Piano, in 1997. “We wanted to renew Ferrari’s organization, to eliminate the division into series A and series B among our employees, and to maintain, not to lose, the spirit of Ferrari.”\n\nSeated behind a large round desk covered in red leather, Mr. Montezemolo added: “But  I repeat, but  there is a great link with our tradition, our culture, our DNA. Ferrari is not a car, it is a dream, and the ingredients must remain innovative.”\n\nFerrari is not the only carmaker to highlight a brand and underscore a claim to luxury style through the innovation of a factory design. Volkswagen hired the architect Gunter Henn to design an unusual glass factory in Dresden, Germany, where it assembles its top-of-the-line Phaeton. Outside Leipzig, Germany, Porsche has its own signature building, designed by the Hamburg architectural firm von Gerkan, Marg & Partners. BMW hired the London architect Zaha Hadid, another Pritzker Prize winner, to design a factory in Leipzig.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
