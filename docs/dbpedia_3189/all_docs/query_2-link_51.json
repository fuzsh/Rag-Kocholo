        "text": "550 info\n\nWSR info\n\nFerrari 550 “Michael Schumacher info”\n\nHi there.\n\nSorry for the text that follows. It’s a bit long .....\n\nHowever it’s just to add a little bit of information that may help finding out s little more about your 550. Either early - Wsr - Schumacher Specification - etc etc.\n\nI’m no expert ......\n\nWhen I think about road going 550’s and the WSR cars I think of them in 5 categories.\n\nIt is extremely important for detailed records to be kept as for some reason Ferrari are coy when discussing Vin numbers of the WSR cars.\n\nIf an official list was released from Ferrari this would (and will) prevent a lot of confusion which will 100% be coming due to the huge prices WSR cars arena demanding.\n\nAn official Ferrari dealer in London (today in 2018) has one of the British WSR cars for sale for £279,991. (Roughly $ 362,000 at todays exchange rate). The huge difference in value and the limited official information means that it wont be long before ‘fake’ WSR cars appear on the market.\n\nI know this as a fact. As a member of the Ferrari Owners Club I am often in contact with official suppliers and have been informed of the recent request for “replacement WSR badges that have been lost”.\n\nAnyway, back to my categories (Ignoring race cars like Prodrive GTS or GTO names models etc).\n\nThe obvious way to think about the 550 to start with is simple ... date of manufacture and Vin numbers.\n\nIt’s pretty easy to assume that the 33 WSR cars must have been produced ‘after’ the WSR car broke the record.\n\nTherefore I’m going to list my categories by date and vin number.\n\n1. The original and standard 550. (1996-2001)\n\n2. The 550 as above with often requested factory extras. (ie Fiorano handling package)\n\n3. The Official Carrozzeria Scaglietti Ferrari 550 “Michael Schumacher” (and I’m quoting\n\ndirectly from the Ferrari brochure here - and thats important).\n\n4. The actual WSR car VIN ZFFZR49A5X0113518 (as I’ve been told)\n\n5. The 33 WSR badged cars produced by Ferrari 23 LHD and 10 RHD.\n\nWhat I’m going to talk about is the 3rd group in relation to WSR cars.\n\nThese are the most likely faked into WSR cars and are often called “Michael Schumacher Edition” 550’s.\n\nThere is no such car and his term is incorrect as it should only apply to the 456.\n\nBefore the WSR cars were produced, Michael requested I custom made 550 for himself (not a WSR car).\n\nThis is where things can get confusing for 550 owners.\n\nMy car and Michaels car Vin ZFFZR49B000113182 (again - this is the Vin I’ve been told) have almost the exact same Vin number.\n\nIn fact the Vin numbers are so close they were likely made on the same day. This is late summer 1998.\n\nThe 550 “Michael Schumacher” is a 550 that replicates the special order of items that Michael requested on his car as officially listed by Ferrari.\n\nIt is no surprise that the WSR car that was then released ‘later’ has the “Michael Schumacher” items as standard with a couple extras that I will try and explain.\n\nThe Official Ferrari 550 “Michael Schumacher” options are listed by Ferrari as follows (This is a direct quote from Ferrari).\n\n1. Road legal Roll-Bar (Except For USA, Canada, Australia) with racing seats wholly in leather.\n\n2. Four Point Adjustable Harness (Except for USA, Canada, Australia).\n\n3. Carbon Made Door pockets.\n\n4. Main and Secondary Instrument panels in Carbon.\n\n5. Underdoor mouldings in carbon with ferrari logo in Aluminium and hand brake cover in carbon.\n\n6. Tunnel Moulding and gear knob in Carbon, with dedication plate in silver. (Michaels has his autograph on it - it does not say World Speed Record).\n\n7. Modular week rims (available during 1998).\n\n8. Brake callipers in red colour.\n\n9. Handy Fire extinguisher fitted in the car (This was also leather covered).\n\nSo, the above is what Ferrari list however from various chats with people who remember the car - they were not sure that Michael had all of his own options (Strange but thats what they said).\n\nI’ve been told he may not have had split rim wheels (perhaps he changed them later - perhaps he didn't).\n\nThe argument I often hear is - How many official options do you need from the above to call your car a “Michael Schumacher” 550. Thats an argument with no answer.\n\nWith the exception of Michaels ‘actual’ car I guess.\n\nHowever more importantly - if you have all the options - how easy would it be to fake a WSR car ?\n\nSo look out for the following additions being made to the Ferrari 550 “Michael Schumacher”.\n\nFirstly need to add wing badges (not stick on type).\n\nThe wing badges are the type fitted into an ‘indentation’ in the metal wing.\n\nI have heard from Ferrari that people may simply order later type wings of this style or I have even heard of a US garage that have a machine that will press into your own wings and then add the badge.\n\nSecondly, you’d also need to get a WSR badge made and as I have previously mentioned people are requesting these from Ferrari saying they have ‘lost their old one’.\n\nTo this day I cant understand why Ferrari apparently made 2 different types and put them in 2 different locations.\n\nLastly the WSR cars have\n\n1. A suede steering wheel.\n\n2. Carbon F50 gear knob with stallion.\n\n3. On the metal gear change plate it has a diagram of the gear numbers - rather than the stallion.\n\nThere may be other differences - perhaps you may know.\n\nAll of this could be easily avoided if Ferrari release an official WSR Vin list.\n\nHowever If you’re buying a WSR or a high specification 550 “Michael Schumacher” or being asked to pay more for any rarity, I’d check the Vin number (does the sequence and date look wrong) and get a Ferrari expert to double check things with you.\n\nAs I said with soaring prices of rare cars fakes are going to become a problem.\n\nHere is 113162\n\nThe same as Michaels - called by Ferrari ....\n\nFerrari 550 “Michael Schumacher”\n\nYou’ll see the difference, it’s a race car.\n\nThis car won Gold at the FOC Concours.\n\nNobody knows how many Full Schumacher cars there are. Maybe 5-10 ?\n\nSee The Official Carrozzeria Scaglietti Ferrari 550 “Michael Schumacher” if you need clarification.\n\nView attachment 2666627 View attachment 2666628 View attachment 2666629 View attachment 2666630 View attachment 2666631\n\nCheers Ralph\n\nSent from my iPhone using FerrariChat\n\nPs.\n\nStrangely the Schumacher Cars have a carbon Center Console and the WSR leather.\n\nHmmmm.\n\nSent from my iPhone using FerrariChat"
