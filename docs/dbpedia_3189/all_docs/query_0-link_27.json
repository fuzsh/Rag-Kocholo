        "text": "Museo Ferrari\n\nMany of the most important cars built, both racing and street cars, are exhibited here.\n\nIf you are in Maranello we would highly recommend Museo Ferrari. It is centrally located in the village. The museum has been around for a few years, and the exhibition has been expanded on several occasions. Most recently, the museum was expanded with a whole department dealing with F1 and racing. It is impressive. Many of the most important cars built, both racing and street cars, are exhibited in the same place.\n\nAre you visiting by car? Then I recommend that you park outside the Museo Ferrari. There is a large parking lot there. After visiting the museum, you are within walking distance to both Ferrari's old factory entrance and Ferrari's large shop with gadgets.\n\nNearby\n\nSchedoni\n\nFamous producer of exclusive fitted luggage for supercars\n\nDucati Museum\n\nThe Ducati factory and museum\n\nMuseo Pagani\n\nHoracio Pagani's monument to his own glory.\n\nRistorante Lo Smeraldo\n\nA fantastic pizza restaurant in Maranello.\n\nFerrari Factory gate\n\nFerrari's famous old factory gate"
