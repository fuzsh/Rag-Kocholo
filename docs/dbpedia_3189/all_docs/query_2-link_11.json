        "text": "The shortest route from Milan to Rome is roughly 600 km via Bologna and Florence. But the route I followed was the same as that used by the Earls who visited the Holy House Shrine at Loreto near Ancona on the Adriatic coast. They followed the old Roman road, the Via Aemilia, which ran for about 270 km from Piacenta (Piacenza) to Arminium (Rimini) before then making their way south along the Adriatic Sea to Loreto. From Loreto, the Earls then made thier way over the Apennines to Assisi. All in all, their detour to Ancona and Loreto added about 200 km to their journey between Milan and Rome.\n\nDay 30 Thursday July 18th – Total distance cycled from Monza to Rivergano– 125 km (400m of climbing). Total distance cycled so far on 2019 Tour de Travoy – 2410 km.\n\nAfter leaving Milan in April 1608, the Earls made their way to Piacenza over the river Po. Their journey that day was described by the Gaelic scholar Tadhg O’Cianain as follows “The next day the Earls traveled seven leagues to an ancient remarkable city named Piacenza. There is a very remarkable river close to the city. It is very great and very wide. The name of the river is the Po. ”\n\nApparently, there are only about 1,200 equestrian statues in the world and incredibly, 2 of them are located here in the Piazza Cavelli in Piacenza. One of the statues is that of Alessandro Farnese, the Duke of Parma and Piacenza who was also Governor of the Spanish Netherlands. The other statue is off his son, Ranuccio Farnese, who the Earls were to meet when they visited Parma.\n\nIt was Ranuccio Farnese who commissioned both these statues which were both created by the Italian sculptor Francesco Mochi between 1620-1625. This was about 15 years after the Earls passed through Piacenza so this explains why Tadhg O’Cianain did not mention them.\n\nIt was on the Trebbia river near Piacenza where Hannibal had his first major battle after crossing over the Alps in 218 BC, It was a resounding victory for Hannibal as the Romans suffered heavy losses, with only about 10,000 out of 40,000 Romans surviving.\n\nDay 31 Friday July 19th – Total distance cycled from Rivergano to Modena – 125 km (200m of climbing). Total distance cycled so far on 2019 Tour de Travoy – 2535 km.\n\nWith a population of 200,000 people, Parma is the second largest city in Emilia-Romagna. Unlike many other cities in Italy, it escaped widespread destruction during World War 2 and the city is a joy to cycle through with many pedestrianized streets and numerous Renaissance era buildings.\n\nMobike is a Chinese dockless bike rental company that started in Beijing in 2015 and 2 years later expanded to selected cities in Europe and the USA. You simply download the Mobike app onto your phone which you can use to hire a bike in any city their bikes are available. In 2017, they expanded to Italy and launched first in Florence and Milan. In May 2018, they also launched in Reggio Emilia and there were many bikes to be seen as I cycled through the city. Unfortunately, very few of their bikes were being used.\n\nMotorists have to pay to use motorways in Italy so that means traffic is always busy on any roads alongside a motorway including the SS9 between Parma and Modena. In France, you can always find quiet local roads between 2 major cities but that in not the case in the Emilia-Romagna region of northern Italy as there is no alternative to the SS9 for making your way between Parma and Modena and beyond to the Adriatic. A lot of the traffic is due to the many Italian car and motorbike manufactures which are located in the Modena region, including most famously of all, Ferrari.\n\nThe city of Modena is famous as the birthplace of Enzo Ferrari but the Ferrari company is now based in Maranello, about 15 km south of Modena. This is the only Ferrari factory in the world and practically every Ferrari car ever built was built here in Maranello..\n\nThe Ferrari factory is huge and it is only from the air that you get a much better view of its scale. Last year over 9,000 sports-cars were built here with many of them exported to the USA and China, The white tube to the fore on the left hand side of the above photo is the Ferrari wind tunnel which is used to test both Ferrari’s production cars and its Formula 1 cars.\n\nNot only do Ferrari have their own wind tunnel they also have their own race track located adjacent to their factory. Ferrari also have a museum beside the Fiorana race track in Maranello, which opened in 1990.\n\nThe museum in Maranello is located about 500 m from the Ferrari car factory but adjacent to the Ferrari Formula 1 team base. That might explain why the museum in Maranello concentrates on Ferrari’s Formula One cars and their victories.\n\nFerrari also have a museum in Modena which is dedicated to their founder, Enzo Ferrari. It was here in Modena where Enzo was born in 1898 and where his father had a carpentry workshop.\n\nThe museum in Modena includes two separate buildings, a former house and original workshop that belonged to Enzo Ferrari’s father and a new 6,000 square metres exhibition centre that displays some of the most noteworthy Ferrari cars, including rare cars of the 1950s, Formula One race cars and more recent sports cars.\n\nModena is famous not only for Enzo Ferrari’s birthplace but also as the headquarters for luxury car maker Maserati. The company was first established in 1914 in Bologna by the 5 Maserati brothers before moving to Modena in 1940. In 1968, the company was bought by Citroen only to be declared insolvent 7 years later. The company was rescued by Alejandro de Tomaso, a former car racer and in 1993, the company was bought by FIAT. In 2017, FIAT spun off Ferrari into a seperate company meaning Maserati is now the luxury high performance brand within the FIAT Group. However, in 2020, Maserati merged with PSA Group which includes Peugeot, Opel and Citroen. So Maserati is once again merged with Citroen but hopefully, history will not repeat itself once again.\n\nWhat surprised me most cycling through Modena and Maranello is how few Ferrari cars I came across. Last year on the Stelvio, I counted at least 20 Ferraris but on this tour, I only saw a few Ferraris all week in Italy that is apart from the Ineco car dealership in Modena where they had 3 on display.\n\nDay 32 Sunday July 21st – Total distance cycled from Modena to Cesenatico – 165 km (300m of climbing). Total distance cycled so far on 2019 Tour de Travoy – 2700 km.\n\nBuilt in the 12th Century by the powerful Asinelli family, it is 97 m tall and claimed to be the tallest medieval tower in thew world that is still standing. The Asinelli Tower was just one of up to 180 towers built by rival families in Bologna in the 12th and 13th Centuries. Only 20 of these towers remain today including the 48 m tall Garisenda tower to the left of the Asinelli tower in the sketch and photo above. The Garisenda Tower leans by 3.2 m almost as much as the much more famous Leaning Tower of Pisa which is 56 m tall and leans by 5 m.\n\nImola is famous the world over for its racing track and it here the San Marino G|rand Prix takes place every year. However, the town of Imola has lots of charm with many buildings dating back to the Renaissance.\n\nIn 1608, Tadhg O’Cianain wrote “The following day, the Earls went three leagues to a strong fort belonging to the Pope named Savignano” Savignano is also where Julius Caesar crossed over the Rubicon in 49 BC before marching on Rome and taking control of the city from the Senate. Ever since that day, the phrase “to cross the Rubicon” has meant to decide to do something risky and no matter the danger, to never change your mind or return to what you were doing previously.\n\nIt would actually take Julius Caesar 10 months after crossing the Rubicon river before he eventually made it to Rome and was declared Dictator. This was because he first had to travel to Spain to defeat the Roman Senate’s army. Even after being declared Dictator in Rome in October 49 BC, he then had to travel to both Greece and Egypt to defeat other Senate armies which were led by the great Roman general, Pompey. The Civil War caused by Caesar crossing the Rubicon would drag on for 4 years and result in at least 10, 000 Roman soldier casualties.\n\nIt took the Earls 4 days to travel 165 km from Modena to Savignano in 1608, a journey that I managed to cycle in one day, though it did take me almost 14 hours. In fact, it was the longest ever day on any Tour de Travoy beating the previous record by 10 km.\n\nDay 33 Monday July 22nd – Total distance cycled from Cesenatico to Fano – 85 km (200m of climbing). Total distance cycled so far on 2019 Tour de Travoy – 2785 km.\n\nThe Marco Pantani memorial in Cesenatico is actually quite moving. Marco, who won the Tour de France in 1998, the year it started in Dublin, was born in Cesenatico. This memorial, unveiled in 2014, 10 years after his death, certainly is a fitting tribute to a great cyclist\n\nIt had taken me about 5 weeks to travel from the Atlantic Ocean of the coast of Ireland to the Adriatic Sea here in Italy. The Adriatic Sea is obviously much calmer than the Atlantic as the coastline here is one long sandy beach with hardly any headlands anywhere.\n\nIn 1608, Tadhg O’Cianain wrote “That night the Earls advanced with the sea on their left to the small town Cattolica. Their journey that day was ten leagues. The roads were very good, and as they went along there was fair fruitful land, with much vines, wheat, and abundance of every crop.”\n\nIt was here at the Metauro river that the army of Hasdrubal, Hannibal’s brother was defeated by the Romans in 20& BC. Hasdrubal had marched all the way from Spain and hoped to meet up with his brother in Umbria. But his messengers were intercepted by the Romans who learnt of the plan for the 2 Cathaginian armies to meet up and then lay siege to Rome. In response, the Romans dispatched 2 armies and they engaged in battle with Hasdrubal’s army here at the Metauro river near Fano. The battle resulted in an overwhelming defeat for the Carthaginians and Hasdrubal was killed. His head was later chopped off and placed in a bag before being thrown into Hannibals camp about 100 km away. The significance of the Battle of the Metaurus is recognized amongst historians. It is included in Edward Shepherd Creasy’s The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World (1851), the rationale being that it effectively removed the Carthaginian threat from Rome’s ascendancy to global dominion by leaving Hannibal stranded in Italy.\n\nDay 34 Tuesday July 23rd – Total distance cycled from Fano to Loreto – 75 km (200m of climbing). Total distance cycled so far on 2019 Tour de Travoy – 2860 km.\n\nIn 1608, Tadhg O’Cianain wrote “The next day, the Earls advanced with the sea on their left to the famous city of Ancona. The Pope has three strong castles there and many strong guards, with all necessaries for defence. They command the city and the country near the bay.”\n\nSaint Cyriacus Cathedral was built in the 11th Century but its dome, which is is one of the oldest in Italy, was added in 1270. Together with the church of Sant’Antonio at Padua and St. Mark’s Basilica in Venice, it was one of the few examples of a dome built onto an existing church rather than a new church. The copper cover was added in the 16th century.\n\nAncona has been occupied since Roman times as it was the closest port to Dalmatia (modern day Croatia). The Roman Emperor Trajan had the harbour enlarged and it was from he he launched his invasion of Dacia in 105 AD. Ever since then, the port has been the major port in Italy for crossing to the Balkans.\n\nJadrolinija is a Croatian sea shipping company that is a state-owned and its main mission is to connect the Croatian islands to the mainland. The company also operates car ferries on domestic routes along the Croatian coast, as well as on international routes across the Adriatic Sea to Italy. Jadrolinija currently operates a fleet of 55 vessels, one of which is the Zadar shown in the photo above and which is the largest vessel operated by the company."
