        "text": "The 42,500 square-metre factory was built at a cost of €200 million ($AU323 million) and sits inside the existing Ferrari complex at its base in Maranello, Italy.\n\nThe multi-purpose facility will be home not to just Ferrari’s first electric car, due in early 2026, but will also be used to build internal combustion and hybrid vehicles.\n\nFerrari CEO Benedetto Vigna told assembled media, including Drive, at the facility’s inauguration in Maranello last week that the new factory has not been designed to increase production capacity.\n\nVigna refused to be drawn into media speculation ahead of the inauguration that the addition of the new plant could see Ferrari’s annual production increase from around 14,000 to 20,000 cars annually.\n\nHe also refuted reports that Ferrari’s first-ever electric car would be priced around €500,000 ($AU805,000) when it is released in early 2026.\n\n“I think that it was a surprise also for us to hear those things,” said Vigna. “We do not confirm the 20,000 [annual production], we do not confirm the price.”\n\nInstead, according to Vigna, Ferrari’s new e-building will allow the Italian manufacturer to shorten development times of new product and, more importantly, dedicate resources to the increasingly lucrative practice of personalisation for Ferrari customers.\n\n“We did not design [the new factory] with the desire to grow our volumes,” said Vigna. “Our ethos will remain the same: quality of revenues over quantity.”\n\nThat “quality of revenues” will come from a focus on increased personalisation, a lucrative part of the business where customers can option any number of personalised touches to distinguish their car from every other Ferrari.\n\nVigna would not be drawn on what type of electric car would be the company’s first, saying only (with a wry smile) that it would “have four wheels”. Production is scheduled to start in early 2026.\n\nBefore then, Ferrari’s new factory will begin production in January 2025, with the Purosangue V12 SUV and SF90 hybrid hypercar likely the first cars off the line.\n\nExplaining the name of its latest production facility, Vigna stated the ‘e’ in ‘e-Building’ does not stand for ‘electric’.\n\n“So why does our new building start with the letter ‘e’?” he stated. “‘E’ stands for three things: energy, evolution and environment.\n\n“Energy because it will allow us to implement our multi-energy product strategy with three powertrains. Evolution since it provides us with much greater flexibility in manufacturing and technological capability. Environment because the e-building represents a key milestone in our journey to carbon neutrality.”\n\nElaborating on his company’s “journey to carbon neutrality”, Vigna said: “On the energy front, we have installed more than 9000 solar panels, we have adopted new technologies such as the hydrogen-ready fuel-cell, and we made a greater use of renewable energy, reducing the cubic metres of gas we use.\n\n“By the beginning of 2025 we will shut down our tri-generator and we will not burn any more gas to produce our electricity, heating and cooling.”\n\nOf the 9000 solar panels installed at Maranello as a whole, 3000 grace the roof of the new four-story e-building. It’s claimed to generate around 1.3 megawatts of power at peak capacity.\n\nVigna also revealed that Ferrari will design and build almost all of the components of its first electric car in-house, including the electric motor, e-axle and battery pack, although the individual battery cells that will make up the Ferrari-designed module will be sourced from an external supplier."
