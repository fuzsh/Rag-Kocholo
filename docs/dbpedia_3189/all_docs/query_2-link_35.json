        "text": "Add to favorites Remove from favorites\n\nThis is the birthplace of racing cars and luxury vehicles that have become legendary all over the world, and this is also the home of the most famous car brands in the world.\n\nMotor enthusiasts who visit Italy will certainly find the answers to their prayers in Emilia-Romagna. From Piacenza to Rimini, this small pocket of land lying along the Via Emilia, contains the home of the most sophisticated and modern automobile and motorbike manufacturers in the world.\n\nFerrari, Ducati, Pagani, Lamborghini and Maserati: this 300-km stretch of Emilia-Romagna holds the secrets of high-speed cars, jealously guarded by the companies that have marked the history of this industrial sector on an international level, joining the tradition of Italian artisanal know-how with power and quality.\n\nFERRARI\n\nVia Abetone Inferiore, 4 - Maranello (Modena)\n\nArguably, the most prestigious car manufacturer in the world. The history of Maranello’s company needs no introduction: the dream of Enzo Ferrari, the company was established more than seventy years ago and today it is the symbol par excellence of Made in Italy production.\n\nMASERATI\n\nViale Ciro Menotti, 232 - Modena\n\nIt has been more than a century since the founding of Maserati. In 1914, the House of the “Trident” opened as a car repair garage. Since that historic date, Maserati’s success has known no limits, becoming the brand of prestige, refinement and elegance that is today known all over the world.\n\nLAMBORGHINI\n\nVia Modena, 12 - Sant'Agata Bolognese (Bologna)\n\nThe legendary factory at the gates of Bologna encapsulates the entire Italian engine manufacturing tradition of one of the most famous international brands. Founded in 1963 by Ferruccio Lamborghini, the fame of this company with the characteristic golden bull logo speaks for itself.\n\nDALLARA\n\nVia Provinciale, 33 - Varano Melegari (Parma)\n\nAfter working for the most prestigious car makers in the world (Ferrari, Maserati, Lamborghini and De Tomaso), Giampaolo Dallara has transformed a pipe dream he had had for years into a reality: to own his own car company. Thus, Dallara Automobiles was born in 1972, specialising in the creation of racing cars.\n\nPAGANI AUTOMOBILI\n\nVia dell'Artigianato, 5 - San Cesario sul Panaro (Modena)\n\nPagani cars really are supercars − racing cars with innovative designs and particularly fine attention to detail. Founded in 1999 in a small town between Modena and Bologna, this car manufacturer perfectly combines Italian culture and design with the proud Argentinian character of its founder, Horacio Pagani.\n\nTAZZARI EV\n\nVia Selice Provinciale, 42/E - Imola (Bologna)\n\nTazzari cars don’t stand out for their speed as much as for their technology and environmental sustainability. The company’s history is closely linked to that of the electric car in Italy. In the Imola factories, half a century of skills acquired in the car frame, electronics and design sectors, led to the birth of the first completely zero-impact electric car model in 2006.\n\nDUCATI\n\nVia Cavalieri Ducati, 3 - Bologna"
