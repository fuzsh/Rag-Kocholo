Has anyone done this?  Where would you recommend staying?  I will have a rental car and need to know if we could ...",

        "text": "The Ferrari Museum outside of Modena in Maranello is excellent https://musei.ferrari.com/en/maranello. You can stay in Modena or Bologna or in an agriturismo in the countryside. Some of the best pizza we have ever had was nearby at https://pizzerialabufala.it/.\n\nAlso of interest may be the National Museum of the Automobile in Torino. http://www.museoauto.it/website/en.\n\nI’d stay in Bologna instead of Modena or if you want an authentic small town then Vignola is wonderful. (I live there 1/2 the year). You can also see them test driving the new cars if you’re lucky. Pagani was doing loops in Vignola this year! The Pagani factory is also nearby in Castelfranco Emilia and you can certainly drive to all of them. My husband has visited all of them several times. Maserati has something but it was more difficult to contact them if I’m remembering correctly.\n\nIf you can fly into and out of Milan, it would be quite easy to take a train to Torino for two nights just to see the spectacular car museum there. My husband and I have zip interest in cars but we spent several enjoyable hours in that museum --- there are plenty of cars and interesting car information for your grandson and lots of imaginative and fun displays and vintage videos on car-related subjects. There's a whole kitchen and living room made out of car parts, for instance. Then train back to Milan and train to Modena or Bologna for however many nights you have.\n\nYes, \"a base and day trips\" is our key to having a good time in Italy rather than being locked in to having to frequently pack up and leave for the next location whether you want to or not --- maybe you're tired or have a cold or it's raining or you need to do laundry or there's one more thing to see or do in the town you are in.\n\nHighly recommend getting a two bedroom apartment in Modena or Bologna rather than either two rooms in a hotel or sharing a room.\n\nVisit All car museums will take some days to you :-D\n\nIn Emilia-Romagna there are:\n\nFerrari museum in Maranello (MO)\n\nEnzo Ferrari museum in Modena\n\nLamborghini museum (can be visited the factory too) in Sant'Agata Bolognese (BO)\n\nFerruccio Lamborghini museum in Funo (BO)\n\nPagani museum (can be visited the factory too) in San Cesario (MO)\n\nDallara museum in Varano de' Melegari (PR)\n\nOn top you can add the Ducati museum (can be visited the factory too) in Bologna\n\nIn Arese there is the Alfa Romeo museum.\n\nDon't forget even the car museum in Turin, one of the biggest in Italy."
