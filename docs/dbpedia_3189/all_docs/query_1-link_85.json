        "text": "The name Ferrari represents an unmistakable brand the world over. Car and racing fans alike have different reasons for their love for the brand. Over the years, the car manufacturer has released masterpiece after masterpiece of exotic cars that continue to impress collectors and casual fans alike.\n\nThere’s often talk about the era when teenage boys had posters of Ferrari cars in their rooms as a sign of admiration of the wonderful feat of engineering the cars represent. With the manufacturer enjoying this kind of recognition, it is easy for the origin of the success story to get lost. You can trace the whole Ferrari story back to the dream of one racing driver, Enzo Ferrari.\n\nIn addition to racing, Enzo also built race cars and eventually detoured into making cars for street use. The Enzo Ferrari Museum in Modena captures this story well. That makes it a great place to visit for all Ferrari fans and other car enthusiasts.\n\nMuseo Enzo Ferrari (Enzo Ferrari Museum) is dedicated to the life and times of the legendary automotive company founder. Situated in Modena, Italy where Ferrari was born, the Museum takes visitors on a trip back in time to the beginnings of the car company. While the Ferrari Museum in Maranello focuses on the cars and Formula One, the Modena museum is more focused on Ferrari the man.\n\nRegardless, if visitors want to learn about the company’s sports cars or the man behind the prancing horse, the Enzo Ferrari Museum is an ideal location to visit. Thanks to a wealth of exhibits and activities, Ferrari fans will fall in love with a day out at the Modena museum.\n\nThe Museum\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe Enzo Ferrari Museum is split into two parts. One part is the restored building that housed Enzo Ferrari’s father’s workshop. The other section of the Museum is a futuristic wing, built to appear like a large yellow automobile car hood.\n\nEnzo Ferrari Museum Activities\n\nThe museum offers a number of guided tours giving visitors the chance to learn about the exhibits from Ferrari staff. The museum’s officials recommend 60 minutes for the guided tours. Like the Ferrari Museum in Maranello, there are two semi-professional Formula One simulators located inside. Museum-goers can sit in the simulator and experience the tarmac of famous circuits from around Europe.\n\nDue to the proximity of the Enzo Ferrari Museum to the Autodromo di Modena circuit, car enthusiasts can take on a few laps of the racetrack in a race car. A professional driver will give thrill-seekers a briefing before sending them out onto the circuit.\n\nDon’t miss:\n\n- The design and architecture of the museum\n\n- Older model Ferrari sports cars that are on display\n\n- The personalized experiences that offer visitors the chance to learn even more about Ferrari\n\nThe Enzo Ferrari Museum offers car enthusiasts the opportunity to learn more about the man behind the brand. Given the fact that the museum is close to the Ferrari Museum in Maranello, Ferrari fans should definitely make an attempt to see both."
