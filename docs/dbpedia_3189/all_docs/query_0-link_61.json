        "text": "Maranello is home to a legend: Ferrari!\n\nThis is the faithful reproduction of the Ferrari with which Schumacher won for the first time.\n\nThis is the tyre used by Schumacher in the 2003 Japanese GP.\n\nWe are in the Po Valley, after all …\n\n…and the cars here are hung up like salamis.\n\nIt’s almost like reliving the atmosphere of the formula one races.\n\nThis is the pit wall, and you feel as though you could almost change the tyres on a racing car.\n\nThen there’s also the historical section.\n\nThis is the 125s from 1947, the first Ferrari to come off the production line.\n\nThis is the last Ferrari with a front-mounted engine.\n\nBut we aren’t in a museum: Enzo Ferrari only looked to the future.\n\nHe never kept any of the cars he made.\n\nThe historical models here are owned by private collectors who loan them to the “Ferrari sanctuary”.\n\nEnthusiasts travel here from all over world to admire unique models.\n\nThis one is black, but it is a very rare 1957 Ferrari Testa Rossa.\n\nWe are in a veritable gallery where the exhibits alternate.\n\nThere is one, for example, on Ferrari in America.\n\nOr there’s the exhibition on Italian cars: Alfa Romeo, Maserati and Lancia.\n\nIt’s the history of the automobile told like the history of modern art and design.\n\nI’d love to become a part of Ferrari’s history!"
