        "text": "Behind learning the history of the famous company, visitors go through the stages of the development of the automobile industry, which Ferrari has contributed to increase throughout the years.\n\nThe Ferrari Gallery was inaugurated on 18 February 1990. It's a very modern and functional structure. The big parking area is animated by a red arch provided with the red and green lights which remind of the Fl Gran Prix starting line.\n\nThe galleria is divided in 4 areas dedicated to: Formula 1, themed exhibitions, technological innovations and photografic shows. The tour begins at the ground floor, in the space hosting the automobiles which have raced on circuits all around the world in the past 50 years. A series of monitors displays images of the most evocative moments of the Ferrari's history; the trophies of the victories are located on a showcase. The next stage of the tour is the amphitheatre which hosts theme exhibitions (changing every 6-8 months) and 2 driving simulators set in real F1 cars.You can also see several photo murals dedicated to the great drivers who have linked their name to Ferrari and a faithful reconstruction of Enzo Ferrari's study-room which testifies his essential work that certainly contrasts with the incredible beauty of his factorys cars.\n\nAt the first floor, in the area dedicated to technological innovation, are shown special vehicles (like the F50 and the 550 Barchetta), the representation of the \"galleria del vento\" and the exhibition of components explaining how F1 technology is applied to roading cars. There is also a line up of all Formula 1 engines employed since 1981.\n\nThe tour inside the Gallery ends in the area exhibiting art and photographic shows. In the hall near the exit are the Ferrari shop, the bookstore and the photo point.\n\nOpening hours\n\nThe Ferrari Museum is open:\n\nOctober/March 10.00 - 18.00;\n\nApril/September 9.30 - 19.00.\n\nWe recommend booking and purchasing tickets in advance online to their website, to avoid disappointment.\n\nTickets and admission"
