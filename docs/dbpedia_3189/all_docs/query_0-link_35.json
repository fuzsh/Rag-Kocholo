        "text": "This land has been inhabited since the Bronze Age, then conquered by the Romans. Maranello is located in the Modenese hills and combines a typical agricultural countryside with the most advanced industrial plants. It is criss-crossed by Via Giardini, built by the Estense Duchy to connect Modena to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, it is the site of a castle from the 16th century which is now private property. Known since the 19th century as a great place for holidaying due to its position on prime hills, Maranello is the place where balsamic vinegar, Parmigiano Reggiano (Parmesan cheese) and Prosciutto di Modena DOP (Modena ham) are produced.\n\nFerrari Museum\n\nThe Maranello Ferrari Museum is the city’s main attraction. It tells the legend of the Prancing Horse in history, thanks to a permanent exhibition and thematic sections. There are many attractions for visitors, among them a Cinema Hall with continuous projection of thematic films, semi-professional simulators, and a Ferrari pit wall, as well as the Ferrari store and the inviting café."
