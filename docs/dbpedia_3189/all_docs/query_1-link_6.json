        "text": "Modena, Italy, is home to some of the most renowned sports cars in the world.\n\nLamborghini. Pagani. Maserati.\n\nBut there‚Äôs only one Ferrari.\n\nMichael Mann‚Äôs Ferrari movie starring Adam Driver presents a snapshot of the iconic car maker as his life begins to veer off course. The Ferrari filming locations didn‚Äôt need much movie magic, as shooting on-site in Ferrari‚Äôs home of Modena recaptured the triumph and heartbreak of 1957.\n\nImage Credit: Getty Images, Tim Stocker Photography. Image Location: Hampshire, England\n\nFast Ferrari FAQs\n\nA few quick facts about one of Italy‚Äôs fastest exports.\n\nWhat is the most iconic Italian car?\n\nWe‚Äôre going to hit the brakes before answering that question because every gearhead, auto enthusiast, and James Bond fan has their own opinion. However, Ferrari is undoubtedly one of the most iconic Italian cars ever made and holds the record for the most Formula 1 Grand Prix wins.\n\nWhere is Ferrari located?\n\nThe Ferrari factory is in Maranello, Italy, less than a half-hour drive from Enzo Ferrari‚Äôs birthplace in Modena. Both cities are in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy, which is known as the ‚Äúslow food, fast cars‚Äù region (you can thank Ferrari for its contribution to the latter).\n\nHow many Ferrari factories are there?\n\nThere is only one factory in the world that makes Ferraris: the Ferrari Factory in Maranello, Italy. It produces a limited number of Ferraris each year. It used to only produce less than 9,000 cars per year ‚Äî but in recent years, it has produced over 13,000. Compared to another ‚ÄòF‚Äô factory like Ford, which produces more than 4 million, you can see why Ferraris are so coveted.\n\nIs the Ferrari movie based on a true story?\n\nYes, the Ferrari movie is based on the true story of Enzo Ferrari, his car company, and the 1975 Mille Miglia. The real story behind the Ferrari movie is played out on screen, with much of the screenplay inspired by the book Enzo Ferrari: The Man, the Cars, the Races, the Machine by Brock Yates.\n\nWho plays Ferrari in the new movie?\n\nAdam Driver plays Enzo Ferrari in the 2023 Ferrari movie. This is Driver‚Äôs second role portraying an Italian icon (he played Maurizio Gucci in House of Gucci in 2021). Driver is joined by an equally striking cast, including Pen√©lope Cruz, Shailene Woodley, and Giuseppe Festinese.\n\nImage Credit: Getty Images, Francesco Riccardo Iacomino. Image Location: Modena, Emilia Romagna, Italy\n\nThe filming locations of Michael Mann‚Äôs Ferrari movie\n\nThe majority of the Ferrari locations are located in Italy‚Äôs Emilia-Romagna region, mainly in the city of Modena. Brescia, Reggio Emilia, and Maranello also hosted Ferrari locations.\n\nPalazzo Ducale di Modena\n\nClosest station: Modena\n\nThe Palazzo Ducale in Modena sets the backdrop for the start of the Mille Miglia race.\n\nDa Antonio Barbershop\n\nClosest station: Modena\n\nNot far from the Duomo di Modena, the Da Antonio barbershop used in the film was Enzo Ferrari‚Äôs real hometown barbershop.\n\nPhi Hotel Canalgrande\n\nClosest station: Modena\n\nThe hotel used in the Mille Miglia scenes is not a real hotel, though part of the Phi Hotel Canalgrande‚Äôs lobby was used.\n\nüöÜTrainline Tip: If you need suggestions on where to stay in Modena, we‚Äôve got a list of hotels for you to park your Ferrari in front of.\n\nPiazza Grande\n\nClosest station: Modena\n\nPiazza Grande in Modena stood in for the Bologna piazza that the Mille Miglia race sped through.\n\nPiazza della Vittoria\n\nClosest station: Brescia\n\nLocated in the town square of Brescia, you‚Äôll recognize this Ferrari location from the real photograph of Enzo Ferrari and Peter Collins at the start of the Mille Miglia.\n\nImage Credit: Getty Images, Ratnakorn Piyasirisorost . Image Location: Bologna, Italy\n\nWhat to do in Emilia-Romagna, Italy\n\nThe Emilia-Romagna region stretches from south of Milan through Bologna to Rimini on the eastern coast of Italy. If Ferrari locations are your driving reason for a visit to Modena, then the Enzo Ferrari Museum should be your first stop.\n\nTake the bus (or rent a Ferrari 296 GTB, because, when in Modena, right?) to the Ferrari Museum in nearby Maranello for more Ferrari exhibits then dine at Enzo Ferrari‚Äôs restaurant, Ristorante Cavallino. It has a menu designed by Michelin-starred Chef Massimo Bottura.\n\nüöÜTrainline Trivia: Chef Bottura is no stranger to the silver screen. Not only was he a special guest for two episodes of the PBS show Dream of Italy, but he also had a cameo in the Ferrari movie as a hotel clerk.\n\nIf you‚Äôre short of a Ferrari, feel free to download the Trainline app to get around Emilia-Romagna by train from Milan or Bologna to Modena ‚Äî the home of Ferrari."
