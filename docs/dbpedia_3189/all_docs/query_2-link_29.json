        "text": "My last visit to the factory in Maranello was a guided tour in 1983 arranged and accompanied by my friend Jacques Swaters, himself a famous Ferrari importer and privateer racing team manager for Ecurie Francorchamps, whom Enzo sold and/or loaned the latest prototypes in the 60's and early 70's. I was then a young guy of 32 and now 40 years later, I have an appointment in July for a return visit. I do not know whether a view of Fiorano will be included, but would appreciate any thoughts and suggestions about what to expect and other things to do while in Maranello. FORZA.\n\nIn addition to the obvious places…factory, museum, etc.,…I suggest a private tour of the Classiche shops and archives. That was the highlight of my visit in 2009. Of course, many more things have been added since then.\n\nI agree with Marcel to avoid Cavallino and have at least one dinner at Montana, although when I return I plan to visit some of the lesser known restaurants in Maranello and Modena that are favored by locals. A couple of years ago an issue of The Road Rat had an article about Enzo’s favorite restaurants and his favorite dishes at each one.\n\nLast month, my adult son and I did a factory tour arranged by my dealer, Ferrari of Washington. We stayed in Modena, which was a terrific base (it’s a lovely place). Took a taxi to and from the factory (takes about 30 minutes). The factory tour was absolutely terrific. Afterwards, we had lunch at the Montana (make reservations). We walked there from the factory, about a kilometer or so distance, and on the way you walk right by the edge of the Fiorano track. After lunch, we stayed another 3 hours in Maranello, going to the museum and then to many of the nearby stores selling Ferrari merchandise and memorabilia. Next day, we went to the Ferrari museum in Modena, which also was fantastic. PM me if you want to discuss.\n\nAt the risk of sounding like a heathen - Ferraris aside (!) Maranello is the least interesting place in a province that is the gastronomic heart of Italy. Modena, Reggio Emilia, and above Bologna are worth days of exploring - Bologna has the oldest university in the world and there are superb restaurants everywhere.\n\nIf you can get hold of a nice car (Ferrari or otherwise) drive the routes across the Apennine Mountains above Maranello. And bear in mind Florence is a 40 minute drive away if you are Stirling Moss, Milan and the rest of Tuscany (in opposite directions) not much further. Enjoy!\n\nSolid points, are there any places to rent an F car around Maranello/Modena?\n\nI have not been to Cavallino since its been renovated and taken over by Massimo Bottura. The last time I was there the Cavallino was ok... basic Modenese food - nothing great... service could be rude to spectacular... you went there for the history... we got to see Enzo's private room, etc... but I have been to Osteria Franchescanna in Modena - that is Bottura's 3-star Michelin restaurant ... so not sure how Cavallino is doing ... but the food will not be anywhere close to the same... perhaps that is why people say its a rip-off. Ferrari wanted to go upmarket with the restaurant... perhaps its too much for \"gear heads\"... But I would find it hard to think the food is bad... but it may not meet your expectations for the price. ( sometimes like Ferrari itself! ).... Montana is very rustic home cooking of the area ... well worth the trip... Italian culinary culture does not do well with change... which is why i think Cavallino does not get much local respect.\n\nTom, you seem to have a lot of experience with the Factory Tour. My family and I have the tour scheduled for Sept 11th. I'm wondering if that includes tickets to the Ferrari Museum? What about Enzo's Museum in Modena? Thanks for any advice.\n\nKen\n\nIf you have the Owners tour - then yes, you will get entrance to the Maranello Museum as part of it. The last tour I was on ended at the Ferrari store across the street from the factory and you get a one-day 20% discount. The museum in Modena is not included as it is separate but still well worth it. The only thing I did not like is they dont give you much time at the Maranello museum, you could easily spend half a day there. but you do get to go back after if you like. Have a great time! that time of the year should be very nice - and not as Hot.\n\nThanks Tom. We are on the owners tour. I was told the whole thing lasts 2.5 hours, but that does not include the museum, you do that after. Is that correct? Thanks again."
