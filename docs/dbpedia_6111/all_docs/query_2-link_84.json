        "text": "May 20, 2021\n\nI enjoyed Betina Krahn's HRs back in the day (1990s and early 2000s) but found her more recent books of the Sin and Sensibility series to be just okay. So I downloaded this new one with few expectations. Fortunately, it exceeded them.\n\nThis didn't start very well, considering the way the hero is presented. As a matter of fact, I assumed while reading the first chapters that that miserable excuse for a man the heroine was engaged to would not figure in the book. That she would dump him and find a real man, a real hero, like the ones in the books she read. An Ivanhoe to suit her sensibilities.\n\nBut no. Ms Krahn redeems him instead, not 100% effectively but fairly well, even giving him a reason for his extremely unheroic actions of the first chapter. And I do enjoy romances where the H and h fall in love after an initial dislike or misconception about the other's character or personality. In addition, the Victorian times that Krahn favors are always a welcome change from Regency romances. And there's an interesting historical setting here of a time of shipping and tariffs and unrest and low wages and enough political and economic troubles for a person to see that history does nothing but repeat itself, with few of us learning much from it.\n\nNow to the romance. As I said at the beginning of this review, I didn't think much of the hero. Nor did the heroine. She and the hero are children of two shipping magnates who are having financial troubles at the moment and decide to form a partnership by having the H and h marry and the h's trust money handed over for company improvements to make their shipping business more competitive.\n\nNeither H nor h are very happy about this, but not to worry. They muddle through riots and protests, abductions, beatings, almost drownings, and more troubles than the average HR puts its MCs through, only to come out on the other side with a much better opinion of each other.\n\nI found this to be humorous and romantic and the best recent Krahn book that I've read. She has been writing romance since 1983, I believe. Her books can be hit or miss for me but I always appreciate her writing abilities and her humor. I'm looking forward to more books in this new Reluctant Heroes series. I suspect the best friend of the hero of this one will figure in the story to follow.\n\nJanuary 17, 2021\n\nI had a lot of fun with this read. It was filled with action and adventure, and it kept me engaged from the very beginning. I mostly read it in one sitting. I have read a few by Krahn at this point, and her stories tend to be a bit of a romp. This one did not disappoint in that area!\n\nIt starts with an inauspicious beginning. Rafe and Lauren have been betrothed by an arrangement made by their fathers. They are spending some time together rowing on the river, both out of obligation for their betrothal rather than actual desire to spend time together. They are polite and talk mundane topics, not really trying to learn about each other or show their real selves. Then, they notice a crises with two women and a flipped over boat and some apparently real character traits come to light in how they handle the situation. After that, it's one adventure after another that breaks down their defenses and gets them to see how well they work together.\n\nOnce they got past those defenses, the chemistry leaped off the page. I found Rafe to be a very compelling hero, which was surprising after the beginning when he was rather loathsome. And I liked that Lauren was a strong heroine who thought she knew her own mind, but then she grew with more understanding. I would say that I was a bit disappointed that the intimate scene was mostly closed-door, because I was expecting it to be scorching.\n\nThe historical context was interesting with a good deal of focus on unrest and disparity between classes. Lauren and Rafe were both heirs to shipping families, and it was not a good time for the shipping industry with high & rising tariffs. Gossip columns were also a big feature, but they are a frequent device used in HR.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this book. I think I read this book at the right time. It suited my mood, and it was a good diversion to the news of the day, while finding ways to relate to current day. That is something that I like finding in historical romance, relatable to situations to the present.\n\n*Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for the chance to read and review this book. Views are my own.\n\nNovember 18, 2020\n\nLauren is a headstrong, independent young lady and a hopeless romantic. She dreams of finding a hero, but instead she was forced to be the heroic one, coming to the rescue of two drowning women when her fiancé refused to jump in to help. Subsequently to this, any good opinion Lauren had for Rafe (courtesy of his impressive looks) took a cold dunking, and Rafe himself was horrified by her unladylike act and her exposed body parts. Well, admittingly he was also somewhat secretly awestruck by said body parts. However, the young couple is told in no uncertain terms by their fathers, both respected businessmen. that they have no choice but to continue with their engagement and arranged marriage for the viability of their respective family businesses are at stake. They dutifully go about town trying to keep up the image of a couple in love but get caught up in mayhem and kidnapping, and suddenly, they find themselves depending on one another for survival. Heroism is called for once again - this time by both of them.\n\nThis was my first book by this author and the book started well enough. However, the plot got bogged down by intricate details of the business merger, industrial unrest and dodgy dealings. The romance got seriously sidelined which was a pity. They fell for each other too quickly after the initial fallout. I'm really not convinced Rafe rose to the occasion and made up for his initial craven and egotistic behaviour.\n\nThis was an ARC from NetGalley.\n\nAugust 12, 2021\n\n✨Not one single pirate’s booty.✨\n\nOkay this book absolutely capsized me. It tied me to the mast and set me adrift. It sacrificed me to a sea monster with major ego issues. It marooned me on a deserted island without rum. I absolutely adored the high-stakes high-tide momentum of the story. My heart was racing right along with the characters. My breath caught when they were trapped. I was enraptured and captivated and so in love. Until the end.\n\nThe plot started off with an interesting premise, Lauren rescuing a group of drowning women while Rafe refused to get in the water. They called off their engagement and then all hell broke loose. It was fun to see the beginning of their rift and then the attraction and understanding that patched them back up.\n\nThe cover definitely did make me think they were going to have more of a shipwreck situation, but it was pretty clear from the beginning that it wasn’t the case. I enjoyed where the story took me instead, but I still think a deserted island story would be fantastic. Hell, give me an Amanda Bynes Love Wrecked moment.\n\nFurther, the cover also made me think I was in the direct path of some scorching heat. And for the most part I thought that’s what I was going to get. Their chemistry was felt like a flare gun shot into a barrel of fireworks. It lit up the dark and made every room, cabin, brig they entered together about ten times hotter. However, my hopes and dreams were doused with a cold bucket of water when I got to that point in a book where the number of pages remaining severely limits the scope of what can still happen.\n\nI got to about twenty pages left and was desperately trying to map out the the paths where they still had enough time left to get sparky. By the last page I was crawling across the sand, half-alive and resigned to my fate. I was, for lack of a more eloquent phrase, cockblocked. Their wedding night was summed up in about half a page with an absolutely appalling lack of detail.\n\nIf I’d known to not expect steam, maybe I wouldn’t have felt so cheated but I can’t change the fact that it severely affected my opinion of this book. I enjoyed so much about it but I was ultimately heartbroken. This would have easily been a five-star read if not for the lack of steam. I won’t go below four because it really was a good pirate-adjacent read and it does deserve praise. But again, close but no treasure chest.\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️/5 🌶🌶.75/5*\n\nI gave a couple peppers for their on-page chemistry, despite being cockblocked.\n\n______\n\nInitial reaction:\n\nI have to let my emotions cool before writing this review, and I finished the book two days ago. It was at once so amazing and so frustrating.\n\nApril 13, 2021\n\nGreat Start…but\n\nThis is actually a 1 and 1/2...because it could have been so much better.\n\nHero Wanted caught my attention right at the very beginning of the story. Our hero and heroine are already engaged, but it seems they don’t care too much for each other. The story begins with Lauren Alcott and Rafe Townsend in a row boat. All of a sudden, they hear screams. Nearby are two women struggling in the water. Rafe refuses to rescue the women. Lauren stands up, strips off most of her clothes, dives into the water and saves the women. Rafe is outraged at his fiancée stripping off her clothing and diving into the water. But that’s nothing compared to when she is standing in front of him in wet clinging clothes. Her clothes are almost transparent. He can see almost everything. >i>How dare she! Not that he has any interest in her, or her luscious body. Lauren is upset as well, she calls Rafe a coward. She breaks the engagement and storms off. And, that’s just dandy with him.\n\nLittle do they know that all of this was viewed by a reporter. The reporter has been looking for a big break, and he believes he has just witnessed his chance. He adds a few embellishments, even goes so far as to name Lauren, the Angel of the River. He reports what he’s seen. Of course, Rafe and Lauren’s reputations are in ruin, and their fathers are enraged. It seems that their fathers are trying to join their businesses together. Now their children have ruined their business deal. They are not happy campers. Back to the drawing board.\n\nIn order to fool the public, and make their fathers happy, Rafe and Lauren pretend to still be engaged. This requires that they spend a lot of time together. I was excited! “Here comes the fun”, I thought. I rubbed my hands together in glee. Then they are kidnapped!!! Oh noooo! Not ye olde kidnapping plot! This was the point in the story in which I got lost. Yes, my little Petunia’s, I was reading another story that had tooooo much going on.\n\nThey are kidnapped not once, but twice. The sailors who kidnap them are not nice, so Lauren and Rafe burn the ship down. Lauren and Rafe rescue a starving street kid, get involved in a riot, have the reporter following them around…plus they have their fathers to contend with. It could have made for a fun screw-ball comedy book, but the narrative became filled with family business…in great detail. It was all very tedious. If only the business details hadn’t been added to the book. Lauren and Rafe could have been a great couple. They were getting in and out of trouble. There were some great secondary bad guys, even the reporter was interesting. But the business detail was mind numbing.\n\nSorry to say, I was disappointed in this story. In fact, I believe I was more disappointed in this story because it had such a great start. Hero Wanted could have been a fun story. If only allll the tiresome business dealings had been left out. Sorry to say, I am unable to recommend Hero Wanted.\n\nTime/Place:; 1880 England\n\nSensuality: Warm/Hot\n\nJanuary 23, 2021\n\nThanks to NetGalley and Kensington Books for providing an eARC in exchange for an honest review.\n\nAfter a horrible couple of weeks this was exactly what I needed to cheer me up a little bit. A fast-paced and action packed enemies to lovers with a great cast of characters, delightful banter, a touch of mystery and some social commentary perfect to binge in two sittings.\n\nThis was my first Betina Kahn but it certainly won’t be my last.\n\nFebruary 23, 2021\n\n4.5 stars rounded up.\n\nWhen their fathers desire a profitable business merger, handsome bachelor Rafe Townsend and forward-thinking, impulsive Lauren Alcott are pushed into an engagement. There is a spark of attraction between them which suggests they may just be well-matched, until a Sunday picnic goes badly awry and brings the efficacy of their engagement into question.\n\nWhen Rafe won’t leave their boat to help two women whose boat overturned on the river Lauren takes matters into her own hands. She removes her heavy overskirts and takes to the water to save them herself, flinging Rafe’s ring back at him in the aftermath. A reporter happens to be nearby and sensationalizes the story, leaving Rafe publicly declared rather cowardly and Lauren viewed by some as an angel and by others as a wanton. With both their reputations sullied, they must salvage things by making their relationship very publicly visible and very amicable, even if they don’t intend to follow through with a wedding. Their ensuing closeness will either go down as part of a successful campaign or sew the seeds of a truly loving partnership.\n\nThis was my first read from this author, but it won’t be my last. I liked the writing style and with a unique spin on the arranged marriage trope, this book felt fresh and held my attention. Lauren and Rafe were already engaged but they had preconceived notions of each other and seeing them get to know one another as they faced challenges together was excellent. They both developed feelings for each other before they’d realized it and I loved their teamwork and how they made a conscious decision to be together. Rafe had more depth than he showed at first blush, but both he and Lauren grew and changed their perspectives as they learned more about each other and I loved that character development and the tension between these two was great. I do wish we’d gotten a bit more steam, but I loved the storyline and the characters kept me entertained so I didn’t really mind. Lauren’s impetuousness was curbed by Rafe’s cautiousness; these two brought out the best in each other and I’ll look forward to continuing this series.\n\nI voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book. All thoughts and opinions are my own. Blog link: https://mustreadalltheromance.blogspo...\n\nOctober 27, 2020\n\nThis book was so exciting. Instead of historical romance, it should read adventure romance! I mean, in the first chapter the heroine saves the lives of two woman and ends her betrothal, all in one fell swoop. Then we read that the hero and heroine are in a contracted marriage that will benefit the shipping companies of both families. And this benefit will change the shipping market because such a large company can change the way cargoes are shipped from overseas and not depend on the government. So many people want the marriage to go on but many politicians and government officials do not want this marriage. The hero and heroine agree. They can't stand or understand each other.\n\nOne of the better parts of reading this story was the development and growth of maturity in both of the main characters. The hero has always been the golden child and that follows him into adulthood. He can do no wrong in his parents eyes and that has made him a self centered, jaded lily of the field. The heroine has always been a reader, but more than that, an educator. She is dedicated to reading and teaching the poorer classes how to read and do math. Her father hates this and feels that she has expectations too high for a normal man, she wants a hero. So what does she do, she turns her self centered fiance into a hero. He does also do a lot on his own, but it takes her opening his eyes and educating him in the ways of the world. He was never a bad man, just used to being the center of attention.\n\nThis story was a good read from.cover to cover. It was well written with a supporting cast that made sense and added to the story. It was conclusive and no spelling or grammatical errors. 5 stars all around. I recommend reading this book.\n\nFebruary 16, 2021\n\nThank you to Goodreads/the publisher for this book.\n\nI've read several other books by Betina Krahn. The first and still my favorite was the \"The Last Bachelor\", but I quite enjoyed this one too. I enjoy most of her books because she has intelligent feminist characters and tries to add some historical and social commentary in her books as well.\n\nIn this book we have a plucky do-gooder (she reminded me a little Sally Lockheart series by Philip Pullman) setting straight her starchy, arrogant and cowardly fiance, yet when pushed together by circumstances, over time both characters grow, adventures abound.\n\nIt avoids the obsession with titles, fashion & manners that sometimes occupy the regency genre, by setting the story among the genteel but working class. There may be some anachronisms in language, actions, but overall you can tell the author does her research (I like that she adds a section at the end discussing what she learned). From her previous books I learned about clothing manufacturing and oceanography. This time, I quite enjoyed the subplot about the impacts and problems of tariffs. (As the author points out in her epilogue the 'protectionist'/'isolationist' tendencies in both America & British politics in the last few years have had similar short-sighted impacts on our economies.)\n\nKudos for couching a topical historical socio-economics lesson into an adventure & romance while also showing how the characters grew and formed a mutual love and appreciation. The adventures may be a bit unrealistic but they're amusing. Her heroes may be a little TOO perfect in their complete support of the women (probably anachronistic for the time), but since this is being written in the present time for current audiences and it's a romance novel, not a purely historical piece, it's what I'm reading it for.\n\nMinuses: The cover is a bit tawdry; a \"From Here to Eternity\" homage.\n\nWhile she's usually pretty good about not writing the same \"independent bluestocking\" character over & over, she does reuse the \"annoying/snivelling reporter\" subplot (and not the same character (Rupert Finch), just the same archetype, that is in \"The Last Bachelor\" and I think at least another of her books as well.\n\nFebruary 22, 2021\n\nThis was my first Betina Krahn novel. Sadly, it fell a little flat for me.\n\nBoth the hero and the heroine were a bit hard to like starting out, though they both did grow on me as the story progressed.\n\nMy struggle with this title, is that it focused more on the merger between the two families then on the actual romance for me. I wanted more time not talking about the merger, and more time with our couple.\n\nI will try this author again, as I can see the talent in their writing. This particular title was just a miss for me.\n\nFebruary 21, 2021\n\nWhen dashing, determined bachelor Rafe Townsend, and beautiful, impetuous Lauren Alcott are trapped into an engagement by their powerful business magnate fathers, their attraction suggests there may be pleasurable compensations to matrimony after all. Until an outing together puts a damper on their future. Lauren is appalled when Rafe refuses to help two women whose boat has overturned on a river. Stripping her outer clothing, she dives in to rescue them herself—delighting a nearby reporter. Soon newspapers and scandal sheets have labelled Rafe as “less than heroic,” for all of London to see, while Lauren is viewed by many as brazen.\n\nThe first in a new series, I must admit I wasn’t enamoured of either Lauren nor Rafe at the start of the book but the more I read the more I grew to love them & the more I enjoyed the book. A well written book with action & adventure as well as romance. I read the book in two sittings & devoured it towards the end. I loved Jims who stole the book for me. There were some ‘upright' characters who I would have loved to have had their comeuppances. A fun, entertaining, enjoyable read\n\nMy honest review is for a special copy I voluntarily read\n\nWant to read\n\nMarch 26, 2021\n\nI'm always intrigued by heroes who'd rather not be one thanks very much!\n\nMarch 5, 2021\n\nThis was totally fun!

And this new one does not miss its mark. So I happily let myself be sucked by the pages.

But one day when he didn't step up to save two women who were about to drown, Lauren was furious and broke their engagement after saving those women. But it caused a huge scandal which made them to act as betrothed again. They thrusted into some dangerous situations because of some dishonorable people trying to ruin their business. A reporter was also after them; stalking their every moves. Between all those things, Rafe and Lauren soon realized that their feelings for each other had changed. Before they wanted to rip each others throat but now they couldn't really be without each other. Thus begin their new life. After making sure there was no threat to their happiness of course.\n\nThat Barnaby dude was creepy AF with his stalking. I felt really bad for Lauren when the church and school committee members were so harsh to her after all the things she did for them. Really wanted to beat the shit outta Mrs. Buffington and the others as well. And Ledbetter was a piece of shit! Ugh! Asshole! Loved Rafe and Lauren's banter. Loved Barclay too. That boy, Jims was cute!\n\nTruth to be told, I assumed this book was gonna be one of those boring books I wouldn't like but have to finish it because I didn't wanna DNF it. But imagine my surprise when I couldn't put it down and got really addicted. This book is amazing. I loved it! It has action, humor, romance, mystery everything. It's one hell of a work. The author did an amazing job tbh! I really enjoyed it!\n\nHe would not lose her−this woman he intended to share his life with. She was a light, a beacon to a better world. His world.\n\nMarch 26, 2021\n\nI picked this book up because I've read a couple of books by the author that I liked, and I wanted a light, fun story. I got that, with a feisty heroine and slightly stuffy hero, just as I expected. What I didn't expect was the plot, that adds twists and turns I didn't see coming. You know those books you read where only one or two things happen and everything plays out just the way you thought it would when you read the first page? This isn't one of those. The twists are logical and arise from what's happened before, but they also are unexpected. As the plot played out I learned more about the MCs, who became real people to me. I deserately wanted them to work out all the complications and get the happy ending they both deserved.\n\nI need to add a note about the awful cover. It's a throw-back to the bodice ripper covers of earlier days, and doesn't reflect the characters well, or the story. This isn't a sex-in-every-chapter book; though they are attracted to each other it's not a main part of the story or their relationship. Instead there are adventures, complications, personal problems, and even a sea battle. Just right if you're in the mood for a romantic adventure story. 4 stars for a fun read that never bogged down.\n\nNovember 17, 2020\n\nI received a complimentary copy of Hero Wanted in exchange for an honest review. This was one of the best books I've read in a long time. This novel was well written, and had a unique plot with realistic characters. The author did a great job developing Lauren and Rafe's relationship, and included several secondary characters that didn't detract from the main characters. What I liked most is the innuendos between Lauren and Rafe as their relationship developed. Overall, great job. I'll definitely be looking for more from this author.\n\nNovember 12, 2020\n\nA romance that starts with a couple who want nothing to do with one another although their fathers wish them betrothed. A headstrong woman and a seemingly ungallant man agree to agree in public. With a few stolen kisses and an adventurous courtship splayed in the newsprint, this couple just might build a relationship. A sweet story but not enough sizzle.\n\nCopy provided by the publisher and NetGalley\n\nFebruary 22, 2021\n\nThis book captivated me from the first chapter where our hoyden heroine strips to her underclothes to perform a daring water rescue of two women, while her fiancee sits back and watches agog! After growing up reading of hero’s like Ivanhoe, she can not believe that her fiancee is a coward… how will they ever get along?\n\nI absolutely loves the impetuous Lauren Alcott and the ever proper Rafe Townsend. These two opposites have been forced together in a match in order to same their family business… Lucy for them, once they agree to work together, they make a better team than on their own. Soon these enemies start seeing each other for who they are and quickly become infatuated with each other…\n\nHero Wanted had me staying up late to keep reading from all the action, twist and turns and funny moments that made this story all the more enjoyable.\n\nNeedless to say, this action packed, sweet romance is full of drama from the water ways of London to the courtroom! I enjoyed the fast pace that kept me on my toes. This was my first book by this author, I am excited to explore her backlist for some more gems!\n\nHero wanted by Betina Krahn is scheduled to release February 23rd, 2021.\n\nI received a complimentary copy of this book from Kensington Books through NetGalley. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own.\n\nBlog link: https://pinkcowlandreads.blogspot.com...\n\n#HeroWanted #BetinaKrahn #NetGalley #pinkcowlandreads\n\nFebruary 12, 2021\n\n❤️❤️❤️❤️\n\n💋\n\nComplex plot with twists and turns, but very satisfying and entertaining to read.\n\nAlways a good read from Betina , this one is very good with some excellent characters and addictive storyline.\n\nVery addictive.\n\nI received an Arc copy of this book and chose to post this review\n\nAugust 9, 2022\n\nThis was delightful! A reformed hero, a kidnapping, orphan children, and a heroine to root for! I sped through this within a few hours and truly enjoyed this fun read!\n\n5 ⭐! ❤️\n\nJanuary 4, 2024\n\nI loved this book! Its hilarious, romantic and packed with action. The chemistry was sizzling, though still PG-13.\n\nRight from the beginning we are introduced to a great heroine. Lauren Alcott is feisty, intelligent, compassionate and brave.\n\nThe hero though is deliciously horrible! When I started reading this book, I skipped through the blurb- It’s Bettina Krahn and I knew I wouldn’t be bored, so didn’t catch the male lead’s name and wondered within the first few chapters when he would make an appearance!\n\nI kept thinking Rafe Townsend is just the bad example against whom the hero would shine or perhaps the villain in the story! He is tall, fair, wealthy, educated and handsome BUT also indifferent to others especially Lauren, arrogant, spoiled, opinionated and worst of all, a coward! He is a bad date- fiancé! He doesn’t care about Lauren beyond the fact that she’s nice looking, drones on and on his favorite subjects, doesn’t rush to be heroic (that boat scene!) and even thinks people in trouble deserve it (he called the two women who almost drown “feckless”)!\n\nInstead of applauding Lauren for her heroism or even grudgingly accepting that she did the right thing and saved two women from drowning, he scolds her for stripping down to her drawers in public. She calls him a coward and pushes him in the water! The entire episode is witnessed by a journalist who publishes the tale in her favor and causing Rafe embarrassment. Their two dominating fathers who had brokered their engagement- it was basically an important business deal sweetened with the two families joining in matrimony- discover this and force the two to mend reputations.\n\nI thought Lauren would run away or bump into the real hero then, but no, it was going to be Rafe! So, I settled down to see how the author would make this sorry excuse of a man redeemable in my eyes. He refused to help two drowning women!! They started meeting in public and his transformation wasn’t instant. She gave him her favorite novel, he kept trying to get rid of it. He took her to an exhibition and then ignored her while he tinkered with the machines! And every excursion was being secretly spied on by the same journalist so there were more tales of Lauren the “angel of London” opposed to her sullen betrothed.\n\nLauren also wasn’t the perfect heroine. She could hold her own with Rafe, the remarks between them were funny, but she did have this tendency to be impulsive, judgmental and a slightly narrowed view of the world. She was a romantic, wanting a man like those she had read about in her books- a “heroic knight”- and kept shoving those ideals on Rafe- the book she wanted him to read being about her favourite hero. She wanted to be seen as more than an empty-headed female and demanded that from those around her. It made her appear as pushy but was perfect for Rafe.\n\nEverything about this book was hilarious and wonderful. I was laughing and smiling throughout. I liked how the author made the two characters so real. They both grew as people, looked at the world from the other’s point of view, developed tender feelings for each other that soon bloomed into real love. I loved how Rafe became the man deserving of Lauren and she the only woman for him.\n\nAll the characters were a joy to read. The autocratic tycoon fathers, the story hungry journalist, the villainous smugglers and even Rafe’s best friend- all came together to keep one turning the pages as we went from funny moments to thought provoking realizations and adventure upon adventure! This book had a tightly written plot, everything falling into place eventually and I recommend it highly. I also can’t wait to read the next book in the series.\n\n**I received a free copy of this arc from Netgalley and the publisher for a fair and honest review. **\n\nJanuary 2, 2021\n\n4.5 Stars Rounded-Up! This book is heartwarming, full of romance, adventure, twists and turns, entertaining, and much more! Whenever I picked up \"Hero Wanted\", I was whisked away on a journey that had me hooked from the first page to the last.\n\nThis is the first book in Betina Krahn's new series, and I absolutely can't wait for, what I hope will be, many more! Her writing style and storytelling is so vivid, visceral, and jumps off of the page. Her characters all feel like such real people, and I could envision each moment, place, and scene. I can only imagine the amount of research Ms. Krahn must have done for the various aspects of this book, as everything felt so true and authentic to the era.\n\nLauren Alcott is such a strong, caring, brave, intelligent, and selfless woman who puts others before herself. She is unafraid to go against what the society around her deems to be proper behavior, and sees that, sometimes, one must act following their heart.\n\nRafe Townsend is a caring, kind-hearted man, and there is quite a bit more to him than initially meets the eye. At first seemingly selfish and with his mind focusing on the wrong things, never could he have imagined what entering into a plot with Lauren (due to both of their fathers' plannings) could lead to.\n\n(Possible Spoilers):\n\nI actually did not find myself rooting for Lauren and Rafe to end up together from the start (I quite disliked Rafe in the beginning). However, as the story progresses, so does their relationship, and I began to see exactly why they are perfect for each other. Both Lauren and Rafe grow throughout the book, and come to compliment one another quite well. As the reader, you learn why they do and do not take certain actions, and as you begin to understand their backstories more, it becomes clear that they bring out the absolute best in each other, which is beautiful to read.\n\nThe opening scene of this book...just WOW! You are immediately thrown into the action, and I found myself flipping the pages quite quickly to see what would happen next! However, I did feel at times that the pacing of the book did not quite keep up. Even with this said, it in no way affected my enjoyment of the novel in any way.\n\nIf you enjoy Historical Romance, I highly recommend this book! I could not wait to see how everything worked out, and I hope we see many of these characters in future novels in the series.\n\nThank you so much to Kensington Books and NetGalley for the ARC of this book, and to Kensington Books for sending me a physical ARC as well, I so enjoyed it! All opinions expressed in this review are my own.\n\nApril 27, 2021\n\nOverall a really good read. Loved the characters and the story was good. Looking forward to the next book in the series.\n\nDecember 7, 2022\n\nVoilà une romance historique plutôt sympathique sans être exceptionnelle ! Tout repose essentiellement sur les interactions des protagonistes et leur caractère à chacun. Rafe est loin d’être un héros sans peur ni reproche. C’est un homme, tout ce qu’il y a de plus normal dont le père le fiance avec la fille de son futur associé. Et apparemment, cette fusion repose sur les épaules de nos deux jeunes gens. Ils n’ont pas trop voix aux chapitres.\n\nMais…\n\nRien ne se passe comme prévu ! Parce que Lauren, elle, rêve du beau héros, de ce chevalier intrépide qui sauve la veuve et l’orphelin ! Ce que Rafe n’est pas du tout et il lui prouve en la laissant sauver elle-même deux femmes d’une noyade probable. Rafe la juge extravagante et vulgaire. Lauren le trouve couard et pédant. On sait déjà qu’entre eux, ça va être épique.\n\nPourtant, entre des articles de journaux qui encensent le courage de la jeune femme et quelques conflits Lauren et Rafe vont tout de même réussir à se rapprocher.\n\nSi on peut oublier la passion avec un grand P entre nos deux héros, c’est juste drôle et lire leur histoire fait du bien au moral. Pour tout dire ce récit se rapproche plus des comédies romantiques historiques que de « l’aventure et passion ».\n\nIci donc, pas de scènes épicées du tout. Tout repose sur les dialogues et les situations qui parfois frisent le vaudeville.\n\nMalgré tout, j’ai passé un bon moment avec L’ange de la Tamise. Ce n’est certes pas super prenant émotionnellement, ici il n’y a pas d’ascenseurs qui vous fera passer pour tous les sentiments possibles. C’est drôle et doux, le tout servi par une plume des plus agréables. À lire, sans trop en attendre.\n\nFebruary 9, 2021\n\nThis was the first time reading this author and while I did enjoy the story, there was just too much focus on the adventures the couple finds themselves in and not enough of the romance to make the story believable. The writing is well done and I very much enjoyed both main characters. Thanks to GR for this giveaway!\n\nMay 17, 2021\n\nThis is a good romp about a pair of new middle class merchant families and how they contrive to get the firms united by marriage. I enjoyed the well researched read and carefully drawn characters.\n\nHave fun!\n\nI read an e-ARC from Fresh Fiction and Net Galley. This is an unbiased review.\n\nFebruary 25, 2021\n\nHero Wanted is the fun first book in Betina Krahn's Reluctant Heroes series. I've only read one of this author's previous books and enjoyed it, but it was the last one of her previous series. So I was glad to get the opportunity to be able to read this one from the get-go. It was an entertaining introduction, and I have good expectations for the next one.\n\nRafe Townsend and Lauren Alcott are the children of powerful shipping magnate fathers who want to join business forces. Join forces how? Well, by having their offspring marry, of course! Rafe and Lauren aren't thrilled with the prospect, but they rub along well enough. That is, until the day they're rowing during a picnic and another boat tips over, throwing two women into the river. Lauren is appalled when Rafe refuses to help them, so she strips off most of her clothing and jumps in to save them. Rafe in turn is appalled by his wet and near naked fiance's appearance. In disgust, Lauren calls him a coward and throws his ring back at him. After this event is reported in this newspapers, their fathers are furious. Rafe and Lauren must appear in public together and act like they like each other in order to appease them. Funny thing is, they begin to actually like each other... and then hell starts breaking loose around them; can they possibly have a real relationship?\n\nThis story started out a bit slowly for me, and the main reason for that was at first I didn't particularly like either Rafe or Lauren. Rafe seemed uncaring and aloof, and Lauren seemed a bit overbearing and expected a man to be like her hero Ivanhoe.. However, as they began to spend more time together, they began to see the true person underneath. Lauren was a very caring young woman who wanted to help poor children get an education and discover the joy of reading. Rafe's family's shipping business was very important to him, and he cared about both the needs of business owners and employees who desperately needed their pay. When Rafe attempted to stop a riot, the story started moving at breakneck speed and I was glued to the pages. Besides romance, social issues such as tariffs, education and reading were addressed. (I could, however, done without the tiny bit of politics in the afterword. I personally read romances to escape from real life and politics. Just a personal opinion.) There were some great supporting characters, especially Jims, an endearing street urchin, and Rafe's best friend Barr. I'm looking forward to another fun romp in the next book of the series!\n\nI received an ARC of this book courtesy of the publisher and NetGalley. I received no compensation for my review, and all thoughts and opinions expressed are entirely my own.\n\nFebruary 22, 2021\n\nI received an ARC of this book to read through NetGalley. All opinions are my own. Hero Wanted by Betina Krahn is the first book in her captivating new series Reluctant Heroes.\n\nLauren Alcott’s father has arranged an engagement for her with Rafe Townsend in order to cement a business merger. She’s been willing to go along with the idea even though she finds Rafe pompous and boring until the day he refuses to act when a mother and daughter are in danger of drowning from a boating accident. She rescues the pair herself and ends her betrothal to Rafe after calling him a coward. Her father and Rafe’s father stand to lose everything without the merger of their companies so she and Rafe agree to pretend a courtship until the situation can be resolved and along the way Rafe discovers that he does want to be her hero. The story is quite exciting with adventures, and kidnapping, nasty villains and just the right amount of steam. I enjoyed reading this book immensely and the cover is simply awesome. Highly Recommend. Steam Level: Medium.
