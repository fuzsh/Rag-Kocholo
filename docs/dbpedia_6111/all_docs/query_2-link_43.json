        "text": "HERO WANTED\n\nUS, 2008, 95 minutes, Colour.\n\nCuba Gooding Jr, Ray Liotta, Norman Redus, Kim Coates, Thomas Flanagan, Jean Smart, Ben Cross.\n\nDirected by Brian Smrz.\n\nHero Wanted is a straight-to-DVD action thriller. It was also made in Bulgaria standing in for the United States.\n\nAfter his Academy Award for Jerry Maguire, Cuba Gooding seems to have had a downhill career in terms of many forgettable action films straight to video and DVD. Ray Liotta turns in yet another detective performance. Norman Redus and Kim Coates have been the supporting actors in many thrillers. Ben Cross (Chariots of Fire) now doubles as an American ex-Vietnam veteran.\n\nThe screenplay is quite confused, shifting in time, has Cuba Gooding’s character going on a vengeance spree because of the death of a teller in a bank. However, later in the film it emerges that he was behind the idea of the bank robbery to impress the girl – but the criminal associates turned it into something real and shot her.\n\nBrian Smrz is a veteran of stunt work for films over many years as well as an assistant director.\n\nNot particularly impressive – an exploration of the theme of vengeance and its futility.\n\n1.The popularity on DVD of this kind of action film? Plot, themes, action, vengeance? The cast?\n\n2.The American settings (filmed in Bulgaria)? Authentic?\n\n3.The title, Liam Case and his initial accident, his failure to rescue his wife?

His upset at her being shot, the vigil, her coma?\n\n6.The subsequent action, going after the killers? Bashing one, shooting the other? McGraw? and his tracking Liam down? The threats? The kidnapping of the little girl? Holding her?\n\n7.Detective Subcott and his investigations, his associates? Presenting the medal to Liam? Suspicions? Interrogation? Coming into the final shooting? The confrontation with Liam? His decision about the girl and Liam?\n\n8.The injured girl, her coma, her mother coming to visit Liam? Dependence? Seeing the criminals, holding the gun, her puzzle?

Swain and his relationship with Liam? McGraw’s? brother and his death?\n\n10.Cosmo Jackson, the Vietnam veteran, the substitute father for Liam? Going for his advice, the practice shooting?
