Have not delved beyond the police scanner yet, as that was main reason to use it.\n\nIt works exactly as you would want for that. So many options! I live in a large city in CO and rest of my family live back in MI. This lets me not only know what is happening here in this huge city around me, but I can keep an ear out on my adult kids toðð¼\n\nInteresting how you learn that when police departments complain how underfunded they are, or under staffed, by hearing that on any given weekend, in any district, only 3-4 cars are on the late night shift, and complaint calls hold for over 24 hrs....you can understand the frustration from not only the people in the city, but very much so by the police who have to answer those insanely late response times! Last weekend Friday night, 2am, 4 different calls were held involving guns and knives simply because there was no one to respond!\n\nYup. Sorry for the long story, but this app has actual learning value to it. 109% recommendation âð½\n\nCSRD1 ,\n\nOne of the best for free!\n\nI shouldn't complain about the ads since it's free but they can be a pain. Sometimes the full screen ads won't allow you to X out of them. 95% of the time it works great though. It's nice to know what's going on around my neighborhood!\n\nSince the last iPhone update, I've been getting bumped off a lot! I'll play my game, which I've done several times in the past with no problems but now it's very annoying! Now I'm conflicted on my rating. Please fix!\n\nJune 2017:\n\nSince my last post, I've learned that I have to update all my apps for this to work appropriately! I quits on me if I have anything pending. Also once you've established your station and if you can successfully \"X\" out of the ad, go the one page back, where you chose your station and then you can listen while doing other things on your phone without getting bumped off! I think leaving it on the clock page leaves it vulnerable to quitting! Now that I've figured all of this out, I can enjoy it! Thanks!"
