The classes are taught by experienced peace officers and staff. The Community Academy concludes with a culmination ceremony, where participants receive a certificate of completion. The Community Academy does not certify participants as law enforcement officers.\n\nSCHEDULE\n\nThen next Community Academy session will begin Tuesday, April 16, 2024, at 6 pm. Participants interested in attending may submit an application to Detective Jorge Cervantes (call (818) 898-1263 or email JCervantes@sfcity.org). The 11-week class schedule will be distributed to registered students. Space is limited to 20 students per class.\n\nIf selected for the Community Academy, participants will be expected to attend nine of the 11 scheduled sessions in order to receive a certificate of completion.\n\nCODE OF CONDUCT\n\nIt is the intent of the Community Academy staff to facilitate a positive learning environment. Meaningful and constructive dialogue is encouraged and requires a degree of mutual respect, willingness to learn, and tolerance of opposing points of view. Respect for individual differences and alternative viewpoints will be maintained at all times. A person’s words and use of language should be temperate and within acceptable bounds of civility and decency.\n\nAll participants are required to treat each other and the staff with courtesy and respect. Failure to abide by the Community Academy Class Code of Conduct is grounds for dismissal from the course.\n\nREQUIREMENTS"
