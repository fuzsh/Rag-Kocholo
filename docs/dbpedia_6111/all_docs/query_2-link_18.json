        "text": "The first hour of this wasn't too bad (kinda sluggish but for DTV it was serviceable enough) but the last half hour of this is pretty awful even if that's the half with all the action, that action is frequently nonsensical. Cuba Gooding Jr is a garbageman turned local hero who saved a little girl from being burned to death in a car crash right in front of him. A couple months later he ends up witnessing this bank teller whom he has a crush on get shot in the head right in front of him during a holdup. Having already suffered the loss of a wife and child, he empathizes greatly with the bank teller's mom played by Jean…\n\nSecond until director/stuntman Brian Smrz directed the pretty good Ethan Hawke actioner 24 Hours to Live and this. Between 2008 and 2017 he really learned a lot.\n\nPlotwise it's a bit messy and for no reason. It could have been a simple revenge thriller, it had higher aspirations and it does not meet those aspirations.\n\nI saw this year's ago and for whatever reason the twist stuck with me, not because it's a good one but because it's such a weird one, especially for something called Hero Wanted. His motivations are far from heroic.\n\nThe cast is all right. Cuba Gooding Jr., Ray Liotta and Jean Smart are the B+ listers. Tommy Flanagan, Kim Coates (two Sons of Anarchy!) and…\n\nafter losing his wife Dawn (Elitsa Rajeva), Liam (Cuba Gooding Jr.) is left searching for something, or possibly someone, who resembles her again. in a desperate attempt to impress a bank teller who looks similar to Dawn, Liam stages a bank robbery, which backfires, ruining his hero reputation gained by saving the life of a young girl in a fire and his life as a whole. off the bat, Hero Wanted (2008)'s storyline isn't too promising. it follows a character whose motives are beyond unrealistic, making this watch very difficult before it even gets rolling. it took forty minutes for some real action to appear and some plot pieces to be clarified before i became engaged with this movie.\n\nfor…"
