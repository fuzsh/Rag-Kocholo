        "text": "It’s happening again. It took a fraudulent 911 call, the deaths of three citizens — Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd — and tweets from the president endorsing lethal force against a protest movement, but finally the slow-moving American conscience is recoiling in horror.\n\nWhites everywhere are describing their “shock” and “disgust.” As they were shocked and disgusted at the murder of black citizens last year. And the year before that. And the year before that.\n\nThis white shock, is it genuine? Perhaps. But why are whites repeatedly rediscovering a fact that people of color have always known: that the police are often as dangerous as the criminals they allegedly protect us from?\n\nAs a writer of crime fiction, I’ve become convinced that white writers like me bear some responsibility.\n\nSome of our first organized police systems were designed to catch runaway slaves, keep tabs on Native American populations, break up riots and protect the private property of the white and wealthy. The police were the main weapon deployed against black Americans after slavery was abolished and white property owners — suddenly bereft of free labor — exploited a loophole in the 13th Amendment that was just wide enough to march a chain gang through."
