        "text": "Police have spoken to more than 600 people since a mother-of-six was found injured after taking her dog for a walk in a Suffolk village and later died.\n\nAnita Rose, 57, had left her home with her springer spaniel Bruce at around 5am on 24 July and was found unconscious near Rectory Lane in Brantham at 6.25am.\n\nShe had suffered serious head injuries and was rushed to hospital, where she died four days later.\n\nPolice have now lifted police cordons in her village in the Newmill Lane area, after officers placed them there having identified two additional points of interest on 3 August.\n\nWhile they have spoken to more than 630 people and taken around 90 statements during the course of their investigation, there have been no charges.\n\nThere have been three arrests in connection with the inquiry – a man aged in his twenties and a 45-year-old man on suspicion of murder, and a 37-year-old woman on suspicion of handling stolen goods.\n\nAll three were subsequently released on bail.\n\nDetective superintendent Mike Brown said: “All police cordons in the village have now been lifted, however we are continuing our inquiries including CCTV and data analysis, forensic work and collating messages and statements received.\n\n“Over the last two weeks, we have spoken to more than 630 people, including as part of house-to-house enquiries, and as a result of this approximately 90 statements have been taken.\n\n“We have also received more than 150 messages via our Major Investigation Public Portal and continue to appeal for anyone with information to come forward.”\n\nThe force said Ms Rose would have followed one of her usual dog walking routes – starting around 5am at Palfrey Heights, where she turned onto a track road off Brooklands Rise which she followed to Rectory Lane, before turning onto The Chase and the A137 Ipswich Road.\n\nFrom there she would have turned onto Newmill Lane, reaching the river before turning back and retracing her steps up to Ipswich Road.\n\nPolice are appealing to speak with anyone who may have seen Ms Rose – or anyone else – that morning, especially between 6am and 6.30am, from the top of Newmill Lane, off Ipswich Road, to the track road between the railway line and the Anglia Water sewage treatment plant, near Rectory Lane where Ms Rose was found.\n\nAnyone with information regarding suspicious people or vehicles seen in the area is urged to get in touch with police.\n\nDetectives continue to search for Ms Rose’s pink zip-up waterproof jacket, which they believe she was wearing immediately prior to the incident.\n\nIt is believed to be from an outdoor clothing brand, possibly from Regatta.\n\nAnyone with any information or knowledge of the incident that could help the police is asked to contact Suffolk Police on 101 quoting 37/41580/24 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
