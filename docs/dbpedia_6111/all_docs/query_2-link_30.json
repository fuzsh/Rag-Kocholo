Cuba Gooding Jr. stars in the lead role as Liam Case, a trash collector who has a good day & a bad day. As the film begins, he rescues a child from a burning car. He wears the hero recognition uncomfortably. The film unfolds so that the audience moves deeper into the story as we see the relationships that were not apparent. Case lost his wife in a tragic accident in which she drowned while trapped in their car. Gooding starts moving out of his shell as he develops a crush on Kayla McQueen played by Christa Campbell. Unfortunately, when he goes to the bank where she works, she is shot in the head during the heist, confined in a coma. We come to learn how his buddy Swain that works with him on the trash truck, well played by Norman Reedus, has taken Case's idea on how to impress a girl to another level by bringing in the McGraw brothers. Steven Kowalski plays the leader Lynch while his younger brother Skinner played by Kim Coates discharges his gun during the bank heist, unfortunately fatally wounding Kayla. Detective Terry Subcott played by Ray Liotta tries to piece together the relationships of the crime. Case goes after younger brother Skinner in the factory where he sleeps and then after Lynch in a bar. Faced with a string of bodies, Subcott starts looking more closely at the vigilante played by Gooding. Tommy Flanagan whose scarface makes Derek looks like a crazed killer with an itchy trigger finger takes over the gang & lures Liam to a confrontation by kidnapping the little girl he saved at the beginning of the film. Meanwhile, Jean Smart from TV's \"Designing Women\" plays Melanie McQueen, Kayla's mother, and urges Liam to get revenge. The bloody battle that climaxes the film comes with a pivotal choice by Swain to side with Case. There's an irony as Liam hangs onto a tropical postcard labeled \"Paradise.\" All in all, this was a good engaging shoot-'em-up. Gooding focuses well, being very different from his Oscar-winning performance in \"Jerry McGuire.\" Enjoy!\"\n\nAmerica's critic\n\nDavid R.
