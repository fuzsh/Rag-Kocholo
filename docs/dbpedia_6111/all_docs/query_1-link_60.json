        "text": "The Head of Britain’s police chiefs has warned: “Those intent on violence have not gone away”.\n\nChair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC), Gavin Stephens, told how there are “many potential events” advertised and circulating online for this weekend.\n\nHe stressed: \"We will be there in significant numbers to deal with it.” He said 5-6,000 public order trained police officers will be on standby and on duty this weekend, with many posted to specific events. He revealed 104 officers had been injured in total and confirmed there have been 482 arrests leading to 149 charges. He described the violence towards officers as \"brutal and ferocious\" - particularly last weekend. \"For many it was absolutely terrifying,\" he said revealing officers had been offered psychological support as well.\n\nHe pointed out how for quite a few officers \"it was the first time they had put that equipment on\" and they had bricks and missiles thrown at them with fires set.The boss was at pains to thank the public, “Team UK,” who came out peacefully on Wednesday night to say no to the “terrible violence.”\n\nHe said those looking for trouble were still there on the “edges” but were “watching and spotting”. But he said they saw the huge police presence and crowds of people who “came out onto the streets in their hundreds and in their thousands to stand up to the terrible violence they have seen.\" He described it as a “loud and clear message from communities that they had had enough and there's no place for hate and no place for violence.\n\n“We are grateful that communities are taking back their local areas…” he added, admitting they had been “nervous” about events. He pointed out that 150 charges were for on the street violence and for those inciting it online - which he said was “equally important”.\n\n“We are very focused on the weekend. There are many potential events advertised and circulated online…Those intent on violence have not gone away,” he said. And he asked families to keep up the conversations to tell children it’s “not worth it” - saying a lot are on the \"fringes\" and being dragged into it."
