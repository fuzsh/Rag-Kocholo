        "text": "Chapter Text\n\nHawks has never been to Tartarus before.\n\nThere’s never been a need for it. Every villain that he’s ever arrested that has ended up behind the impenetrable walls of the island fortress, had never required any further interrogation from Hawks. He knows already that they all must have been relatively open-and-shut cases — the HPSC know how to utilise Hawks’ particular set of skills perfectly, and if they ever needed answers from the kinds of villains that they send Hawks pursuing — well, those criminals never made it as far as a pair handcuffs.\n\nAn accident, the police write-ups would say when the body was eventually discovered, a home invasion gone wrong.\n\nHawks gazes up at the staggeringly tall building from behind the car window that he’s currently stuffed behind. He can’t help but wonder if any of the villains who had met their demise at the end of one of his razor-sharp feathers might have thanked him for sparing them from a lifetime spent here.\n\nFlying to the prison hadn’t been an option. He would have been shot out of the sky on sight, no matter what kind of special permission the Commission might have granted him. Tartarus does not tolerate any hint of risk, and so Hawks had been forced to make his way here in an armoured vehicle that the Commission had sent to collect him.\n\nHe fucking hates travelling in cars. The bulk of his wings being stuffed into such a confined space makes it an uncomfortable experience at best, but it’s not simply the matter of practicality that bothers him.\n\nIt’s the itch gnawing beneath his skin when he looks out the window, at the great vastness of sea and sky and beyond — the endless stretch of what should be his domain. Cars make him feel restless, trapped, and set a strange queasiness churning in his gut.\n\nIt reminds him of the tiny shack that he’d been born in, the first few years of his life that he’d endured there. Pushing himself up onto his tiptoes — his filthy feet grazed and nicked by shards of broken beer bottles — and resting his chin on the windowsill, peering out the grimy window in search of what lay beyond the walls containing him. The cage that he and his mother were trapped inside of.\n\nOut there, young Keigo had thought. Out there, it will be better. Some day.\n\nAll he had to do was survive.\n\nBeing cooped up in a car feels especially claustrophobic as the vehicle crosses the long stretch of bridge leading up to the facility. The ocean beneath them roars tumultuously, audible even over the sound of the car’s engine and Hawks tries to not think about the prospect of the structure crumbling beneath the relentless tirade of the crashing waves.\n\nThe idea to travel here had been Hawks’ own. The attack on UA the month prior had shaken hero society and those who operated it down to its very foundations, and very little progress had been made in uncovering the perpetrators behind the attack. The names that the ringleaders had called themselves had turned up nothing within the Quirk database, and none of the criminals that they had arrested had any useful information about Shigaraki and Kurogiri. Only that each of them had been offered a hefty sum of money by the mysterious man made of shadows, and a chance to seek their revenge against hero society by taking down the symbol of peace.\n\nAnd yet, what bothered Hawks more than anything else was the sheer amount of coincidences that seemed to be piling up. There were always going to be anti-establishment factions rallying against the peaceful society that the Commission and all of Hawks’ fellow heroes work so hard to keep in place — but unearthing two groups that appeared to be incredibly organised within a month, was another story altogether.\n\nWhich left the question that was causing Hawks even more sleepless nights than ever before — could the two groups be related? Was it possible they were working as a part of a larger whole?\n\nIf there was even the slightest chance that such a thing might be true, then they were going to need to start trying to crack the one source that they have who might hold any useful information.\n\nAnd for that, Hawks would need his newfound partner.\n\nDetective Tsukauchi is waiting for him outside the doors of the prison — as is Dabi, standing a few feet behind the policeman. Judging by the detective’s exhausted expression and Dabi’s wry smirk around the cigarette perched between his lips, Dabi had been putting his particular brand of people skills to use — and Tsukauchi was not being charmed by them in the slightest.\n\n“Hawks,” Tsukauchi calls by way of greeting, as Hawks steps out of the car. “Thank you so much for coming today. I don’t believe we’ve ever been formally introduced before — I’m Detective Naomasa Tsukauchi, and I’ll be escorting you through Tartarus Prison, as well as supervising the interview with the witness.”\n\nThe good detective is clearly wound up by the case as well — Hawks can smell the cloying scent of coffee clinging to his slightly dishevelled looking suit, as well as the twitch in his cheek. He toys with the idea of offering the other man a high five, if only to see how far he’d jump out of his skin. He catches sight of Dabi over the cop’s shoulder, his gaze burning like a brand laid flat against Hawks’ skin.\n\nIt fills Hawks with the absurd urge to grin like an idiot teenager — memories flittering through his head of the pair of them giggling as they rush through the kitchen, whispering ‘sorry!’, catching their breath outside as Dabi’s simmering blue eyes had drank in the sight of him, and he had asked — care for a little fun, now that we’re off the job?\n\n“Hawks,” Dabi rasps, and somehow he manages to turn a mere greeting into the promise of something more. Hawks tries to hide his shiver by wrapping his fleece-lined jacket tighter around him, as if he’s more concerned by the chill of the ferocious winds whipping around them.\n\nThere’s no fooling Dabi, however. There never is.\n\nHawks watches as Dabi chuckles, before lifting his blue-tipped cigarette back up to his pierced lips. His eyes glint against the burning sapphire embers, and Hawks hates that he already knows Dabi well enough that he can tell what he’s thinking.\n\nYou can keep on fooling everyone else, Dabi would say if they were alone, but you’ll never fool me.\n\nHawks flicks his gaze back towards Tsukauchi, and finally returns his greeting — even going so far as to offer him a hand, a gesture that’s a little too formal for his usual taste.\n\nSuch a small thing, but it earns an additional notch to the long list of things that Hawks is finding frustrating about Dabi. He doesn’t like how easily Dabi is able to throw him off his game — doesn’t like that at all.\n\nIf the detective has noticed the bizarre tension sparking between them, he’s too professional to say anything. He gives Hawks’ gloved hand a firm shake and offers him a pleasant smile.\n\n“Nice to meet you, Detective,” Hawks says, flashing Tsukauchi a smile of his own. He gets the feeling that his usual classic cocky grin won’t earn him many brownie points. He settles for arching a brow at Dabi over the officer’s shoulder, one that he hopes Tsukauchi will interpret as a disdainful ‘really?’\n\nAll the while knowing that Dabi will understand its intended meaning: ‘can you fucking behave for at least one minute?’\n\nDabi’s answering smirk is all the confirmation that Hawks needs.\n\n“Well,” Tsukauchi declares, clapping his hands together, “we should head on inside — no point freezing ourselves half to death out here. I can brief you both on the way to the interrogation room.”\n\nHe glances at Dabi, his brow slightly furrowed.\n\n“It’s a no smoking facility, I’m afraid.”\n\nDabi rolls his eyes and makes a show of pushing himself off the wall that he’s leaning back against. He takes a final drag from his cigarette, before summoning up a tiny blue blaze to burn away its remnants. Tsukauchi nods in approval and waves them on towards the massive security gates that lie before them.\n\nHawks takes a moment to gaze up at their terrible height: it’s a strange thing for him to have to find the size of a building imposing. Why be put off by how tall a structure might be when you have wings?\n\n“‘The Gates of Hell’,” someone whispers over his shoulder — Dabi. “Or so I’ve heard them call it. In Greek mythology, Tartarus was the lowest point of the universe. It was where the wicked were sent to suffer for all eternity — the dungeon of the damned.”\n\nAn eerie prickle of unease stirs in Hawks at that: the implication is not lost on him. He’s heard what people say: that those who are imprisoned in Tartarus will never emerge from it alive. He knows damn well there’s at least one villain imprisoned inside that the Commission have ensured will never see the light of day ever again.\n\nHawks does not want to think about Lady Nagant, not while he’s here. Instead he lightly shoves Dabi with one of his wings, watching as Tsukauchi approaches the cluster of security guards outside the gates, his ID already raised.\n\n“Please tell me you weren’t giving the good Detective any trouble before I got here.”\n\n“Me?” Dabi actually does a fairly decent job at sounding offended. “You know I hold officers of the law in the highest regard.” To prove his point, he pulls out his pack of cigarettes and lights up another whilst Tsukauchi’s back is turned. Hawks should really knock the damn thing out of his mouth, but god help him, he finds himself having to hold back a laugh.\n\nThis is so stupid. Once again, he feels like an idiot teenager fooling around behind the teacher’s back, a dumb fucking kid who should know better. He does know better. But this place is setting Hawks on edge, and Dabi’s teasing helps settle some of the discomfort that being here causes.\n\nOh, god. He actually finds Dabi’s presence reassuring.\n\nThat’s something he’s going to have to unpack at some stage — before forcibly stuffing those feelings back into their bag and burying them back down somewhere deep, where they belong.\n\n“Doesn’t your Dad disapprove of your smoking?” Hawks asks, chancing a glance at Dabi. “You won’t make Number One anytime soon if your lungs are shot.”\n\nDabi snorts, blowing out a cloud of smoke as he does. His own gaze is trained on the detective who appears to be flicking through documents on a tablet with the guards.\n\n“It’ll take more than a smokers’ cough to knock me off the top, birdie. Us fire-types have better tolerance for more than just heat — have you ever heard of my old man passing out on the job from a little smoke inhalation? ‘Sides…”\n\nHe pauses, flicking away from some stray ash. His white coat flutters around him, its coat tails whipping in the winds, but the chill doesn’t appear to bother him.\n\n“...what’s the fun without a little rebellion every now and then? We all have our vices, after all. What’s yours, pretty bird?”\n\nDo you count? Hawks wants to reply — wants to see the flash of surprise on Dabi’s face, the faint hint of a blush before it turns into a wicked grin. But it’s a little too close to the truth, so instead Hawks swallows that thought down, along with all the rest.\n\nThankfully, they’re interrupted by the call of Tsukauchi — and the look of obvious annoyance on his face at Dabi’s smoking. Hawks and Dabi exchange a look, before both bursting into a fit of snickering.\n\n“He’s gonna leave you in one of the cells if you’re not careful in there, Dabs,” Hawks teases — before realising the nickname that slipped from his lips so very easily. He’s not really the kind of guy to give nicknames, not like Dabi does — nicknames require a degree of intimacy that Hawks does not usually allow.\n\nDabi looks at him with an unexpected warmth.\n\n“Well,” Dabi replies, a wry grin creeping across his lips, “I suppose I’ll have to rely on having my partner watch my back.”\n\nHawks ducks his head, horribly aware of the rising flush creeping across his face.\n\nHe’s going to miss Dabi when this ends.\n\nWhich is exactly why this has to end.\n\nThe sooner, the better.\n\nAn escort of guards lead the pair of them and Tsukauchi through the winding maze of Tartarus’ inner walls, deeper and deeper into its depths. Hawks tried on several occasions to get a sense of their direction — how many floors had they descended, how far beneath sea level were they, which cell block lead where — but it was impossible. How the gaolers managed to navigate this place was beyond Hawks, and he liked to pride himself on his sense of direction.\n\nTsukauchi fills them in as they walk, not at all put off by their surroundings. Hawks wonders how often the detective finds himself down here, walking these same halls.\n\n“The attack on UA came from the League of Villains, but that’s not to say we can rule out involvement from any other groups known to us,” he explained, “All Might practically brought an end to organised crime, but it’s not something that can be stamped out entirely. Our society is already saturated with heroes, and your number only continues to grow — you’d think that would serve to deter folk from turning to felony, but really, it has the opposite effect. More and more small-time villains are cropping up — in fact, we arrested a grand total of seventy-two at USJ the other day. Questioning that lot wasn’t particularly fruitful: they seemed to be following that Shigaraki guy because he offered them a chance to get vengeance against heroes, the people they reckon that wronged them for one reason or another.”\n\nShigaraki, Hawks remembers from the reports he’d received from the President. Quirk: Decay. Unregistered. Real name and age unknown. No known previous criminal history.\n\n“How did he make contact with so many?” Hawks asks, frowning. “The Commission couldn’t turn up anything on the guy. So how did manage to round up over seventy criminals, let alone recruit and convince them to follow him?”\n\nTsukauchi nods, holding up the datapad that he’s been carrying and consulting it as they walk.\n\n“That’s what we’ve been wondering too. It stands to reason that he must have contacts outside of his own organisation — perhaps one with a more concrete ideology. One that has roots that stretch back decades, one that might have followers already committed to the potential for revolution.”\n\nDabi let out a breath.\n\n“The Meta Liberation Army,” he mutters gruffly, “you’re saying that you think this Shigaraki guy might be tied to them?”\n\n“It’s a definite possibility,” Tsukauchi confirms, “and the theory fits. All Might says that Shigaraki didn’t strike him as the ideological type, and his lack of experience was obvious. If he had contacts in the Meta Liberation Army — or is possibly even a member of their ranks — then the very fact he was able to gather such a large number of villains and convince them to go up against the Symbol of Peace would make a lot more sense. I’ll admit — the police are in something of a desperate position in this investigation. We need more information about Shigaraki — as well as his Nomu and the Warp Gate user, Kurogiri — but we’ve very few leads. If we can establish a link, however…”\n\n“So you need Geten to finally start talking,” Dabi surmises, his tone flat. “Hence the family reunion.”\n\nTo his credit, Tsukauchi looks abashed.\n\n“Like I said: we’re not in a great position right now with this investigation. Almost eighty villains managed to overcome UA’s security systems and sneak onto the campus, and those are some of the most highly advanced constructs in the world. Shigaraki somehow knew exactly what security measures were in place, what Quirks he’d need to counter them, and even more than that — he knew when and where All Might was supposed to be. And we barely have any leads to work off of. If you can get something useful out of your cousin…”\n\n“If you ask me,” Hawks remarks, shoving his hands in his pockets and glancing up at a security camera, “it sounds like UA has a spy in its ranks. How else would they know All Might’s schedule, as well as the security protocols?”\n\nThe stark white overhead lamps that illuminate the prison hallways cast shadows on Tsukauchi’s face; his features looking gaunt and hollowed-out as he grimaces.\n\n“It pains me to even consider, but…” Tsukauchi sighs and takes off his hat, raking his fingers through his neatly-cropped dark hair. He’s a youthful enough looking man, but Hawks spots the dark circles beneath his eyes beginning to take root. The incident at UA has caused the detective more than one sleepless night. “...We can’t ignore the possibility. The school itself is cooperating with us in conducting a thorough background check on all its students and the staff. Naturally, we perform these checks before anyone even enters the school grounds, but—”\n\n“—Obviously not thorough enough,” Dabi cuts him off, a slight scowl contorting his face. It catches Hawks off guard — is Dabi perturbed by the idea of a traitor lurking within the walls of UA? He supposes Touya Todoroki is UA alumni himself, but Hawks certainly wouldn’t have expected this degree of lingering loyalty to his old school all the same. “That level of information would be impossible for someone on the outside to access. Painful or not, face it: you have a mole. Which means you fucked up.”\n\nTsukauchi’s expression tightens in irritation, his fingertips pressing into the brim of his hat — before exhaling a deep sigh, and brushing out the folds that he’d clenched into the fabric.\n\n“Maybe,” he admits, settling his hat back up on top of his head. “Maybe not. It all comes back to the same problem: we don’t have any solid leads. Even if Geten has never heard of the League, he’s still a dissenter in the criminal underworld — he might have heard of some kind of unrest that can help lead us to them. He might be able to give us something — or at least, you.”\n\nThe detective casts a pointed look at Dabi, who simply snorts in derision.\n\n“I still don’t understand why you guys think he’ll talk to me of all people. This isn’t exactly your typical family situation — I don’t even know Geten. His folks fled the Himura clan before I was even born, according to my grandparents.”\n\nHawks lets out a wry chuckle, shaking his head as he walks. He feels Dabi’s gaze turn on him, his cerulean eyes narrowing in suspicion. Probably Tsukauchi is side-eyeing Hawks as well, but Hawks isn’t as troubled by that prospect.\n\n“Don’t you see what it is?” he snorts, digging an elbow into Dabi’s ribs. Dabi instinctively swerves away from him and wraps his arms around Hawks’ forearm — his fingertips burning like a brand even through the thick wool of Hawks’ coat. That heat will never cease to amaze Hawks.\n\nHe makes a decent show of recovering himself by reaching over and poking Dabi square in the chest with the tip of his index finger, relishing the blaze of challenge he sees spark to life in the other hero’s eyes.\n\n“It doesn’t matter whether or not you actually know one another,” Hawks declares. “The Commission says this guy is unbreakable: no matter what he’s been promised or threatened with, he doesn’t budge. Geten’s not going to talk to the police and he’s not going to talk to a Pro like me — but he might just talk to family.”\n\nDabi rolls his eyes and shoots Hawks a withering look.\n\n“I already told you. He’s not gonna—”\n\n“—he’s not gonna wanna get to know you, sure. But you’re still bound by blood, and only family knows how to get beneath one another’s skin. You’re the closest we’ve got to someone who can actually get through to this guy in any shape or form.”\n\nHawks catches the brief hint of a smirk threatening Dabi’s lips. The sound of their footsteps is the only other noise that disturbs the unsettling silence of the steel walls closing in around them.\n\n“Want me to reopen some old scars, huh? I suppose there’s no one quite like family who can manage that.”\n\nHawks thinks he detects the faintest note of bitterness laced in Dabi’s tone, and curiously considers him out of the corner of his eye.\n\nFor someone who takes such pride in their lineage, Hawks wonders, you sure do lash out like a wounded animal whenever anyone touches on the subject of your family.\n\nWhat exactly is your deal, Touya Todoroki? What are you hiding?\n\nTsukauchi clears his throat pointedly, in an obvious effort to draw the attention of both Dabi and Hawks to the matter at hand. Once again, Hawks finds himself caught in a giddy mixture of feeling abashed whilst simultaneously alive with energy. He realises all of a sudden that this might be simply what it must feel like to work a case with someone else: to share in the ebbs and flows that accompany it, the thrill of catching a lead and both working doggedly in pursuit of it.\n\nHawks always believed that working with other people slowed him down, but working alongside Dabi is different. It feels like he’s spurred on to keep one step ahead of the other hero, or else risk having him nip at his ankles as he rushes after Hawks in pursuit.\n\nIt’s…exhilarating and bewildering, all at once.\n\n“We’re nearly at the interrogation room,” Tsukauchi announces, turning around to face the pair of them. The Tartarus guards that had been sent along to escort them come to a sudden halt as well, obediently waiting for permission to continue. “What Hawks said…well, it’s not exactly how I would phrase it, but he’s right. We’ve thrown our very best at Geten to no avail. We need to switch up tactics, fast. If you don’t get anywhere either, then that’s fine. At least we’ll have tried.”\n\nThe detective turns his eyes on Hawks, considering him carefully. Hawks wonders what he’s searching for: some proof that Hawks is indeed the young prodigy that he’s been painted as, perhaps? Or else another foppish fool with a pretty face and sparkling personality that the press and people have latched onto, without any real substance behind him?\n\nHawks can’t fault Tsukauchi for wondering. If he were in his place, he’d do the same.\n\n“I’d appreciate having your eyes on this from the observation room,” Tsukauchi tells Hawks, “you might catch something that might be hinting towards more information about the Meta Liberation Army that I’d miss.”\n\nMeaning: we both know the Commission aren’t telling the police everything about this investigation, and we both know I’m not happy about that. We could work together to crack this case, never mind what the superiors say.\n\nJust trust me.\n\nHawks huffs out an exaggerated breath, blowing tufts of his fringe out of his face. He fixes Tsukauchi with a painfully forced grin.\n\nI wish it was that easy, Tsukauchi, Hawks laments ruefully, I really do.\n\n“I’m all eyes, ears, and feathers,” Hawks says, shooting the detective a faux salute. “Lead the way.”\n\nHawks hadn’t really gotten the opportunity to get a proper look at Geten’s face on the day that himself and Dabi had apprehended the villain. He had spent a considerable amount of time pouring over the mug shots after Madame President had informed him that Geten was related to Dabi: curiously hunching over his phone and zooming in on features such as eyes, ears, the set of his jaw. Seeking out the little hints at a family resemblance that seem so obvious in retrospect.\n\nHe watches alongside Tsukauchi in the observation area, through the one-way mirror, as Geten is hauled inside the interrogation room by two Tartarus maximum security guards. The solid metal box cuffs that confine his hands are set against the table, so that one guard can lock it around a chain binding it to the table, whilst the other guard gets to work securing the cuffs around Geten’s ankles to the table as well.\n\nHawks tilts his head to the side as he notices the guards exhaling clouds of frost.\n\n“I thought the prisoners’ Quirks were contained whilst within the facility,” he remarks to Tsukauchi, shifting his weight from one foot to the other. On the other side of the mirror, Dabi sits opposite Geten, tilting his chair back onto its two rear legs and looking utterly unconcerned about his cousin’s presence, as well as his restraints. “Isn’t there supposed to be security measures to counter their use?”\n\nTsukauchi doesn’t look back at him, his gaze remaining fixed on the interrogation room. Hawks notes the way that the detective has tucked his arms around himself, fitting his hands beneath his armpits as if restraining himself from intervening.\n\n“It’s a little more complicated than that,” Tsukauchi murmurs, sounding strangely distracted. “It’s specific to every prisoner, and the ways in which their Quirks actually activate. There's no known way to entirely nullify a prisoner’s Quirk, other than the power belonging to the hero Eraserhead. We use Iron Maidens for prisoners with Strength-Type Quirks, and cuffs for those with Power-Types. Geten doesn’t just manipulate ice, however — he can freeze even water molecules in the air. So we can’t actually prevent him from lowering the temperature exuded from his own breath and body.”\n\nHawks nods along attentively to what Tsukauchi is saying, but he has a strong suspicion that Tsukauchi is barely even aware of his presence. That suits Hawks just fine: there’s no point dancing around the fact that both of them are more interested in what’s happening in the other room.\n\nThe guards finally finish securing Geten in place, and take their leave. The door clicks shut behind them, but Dabi doesn’t bother to raise his gaze and lock eyes with Geten.\n\nInstead, he reaches inside his coat pocket and pulls out his packet of cigarettes, before lightly setting them directly in front of him on the table. Hawks can hear Tsukauchi let out a grumbled curse, and has to raise his hand to his mouth in order to smother a laugh into the thick leather of his glove.\n\n“They tell me his father isn’t one for following rules either,” Hawks remarks, casting Tsukauchi a rueful side-eye.\n\nThe older man pinches his brow between his forefinger and thumb, and forces himself to let out a long, slow exhale through his nostrils. Hawks recognises it as the ‘ujjayi’ breath — someone had taught Detective Tsukauchi the calming technique.\n\n“You don’t know the half of it,” the detective eventually replies, releasing the grip that he had around his skin and working furiously at smoothing out the wrinkles around the creases of his brow. “With Endeavor, it’s always a matter of making sure he doesn’t burst past the boundaries of his own patience. With Dabi, it’s like he knows he can make a game out of quite how far he can push my patience instead.”\n\nHawks casts his gaze back towards the observation mirror, and watches Dabi flick his fingers against the base of his cigarette pack until one shakes loose. He snatches it up and holds it, unlit between index and forefinger as he rocks back and forth on his chair — watching Geten carefully the whole time.\n\nHawks crosses his arms across his chest and considers the pair of cousins contained within the adjoining room: Dabi with a loose smirk written across his face, whilst Geten visibly seethes under the weight of his restraints. .\n\nYou have no idea just how patient he’s willing to be, Hawks could say. It’s been two days, but Hawks can still feel Dabi’s hand wrapped around his waist — burning bright, like a brand. The glint sparkling in his azurite eyes, when he’d drawn Hawks in close and had been brave enough to ask—\n\nWhat do you say, pretty bird?\n\nHawks brings his hand up to rest against the one-way mirror and gently taps his finger against the divide. A gesture far too light for either Geten or Dabi to hear.\n\n“That’s where you went wrong in the first place, Detective,” Hawks murmurs, huffing a laugh under his breath as he splays his palm flat over Dabi’s visage. “You made the mistake of thinking Dabi’s patience has a limit.”\n\nAs if on cue, Dabi grins at his captive.\n\n“How ya doin’, cousin?” Dabi cheerfully hails the inmate, flashing him a brazen grin before raising the cigarette to his lips. He uses his fingertip to spark the lucifer to a blinding blue light before the villain even has the chance to answer. His lips quirk upwards in amusement, around the filter of his lucifer.\n\n“‘You want one?” Dabi taunts, picking up the pack of cigarettes and waving it tantalisingly in front of the villain’s face. “Hell — I could get you so much more than a couple of smokes. I’m sure you don’t fancy being locked up in Tartarus for the rest of your life. Simply say the word, and I can get you somewhere cushier than here — maybe somewhere with a view?”\n\nGeten spits at Dabi.\n\nThe table separating them is too long a distance for it to meet its mark, and the glob of phlegm lands awkwardly on the metal surface between them.\n\nHawks watches as the surrounding guards rush towards Geten — only to sink back to their allocated positions the moment that Dabi holds up his hand towards them in reassurance.\n\nDabi chuckles and folds his arms in front of him on the table. He leans forwards, the tip of his cigarette glowing tantalisingly blue as he fixes Geten with an icy gaze.\n\n“Now, now,” Dabi begins, calmly, exhaling a cloud of smoke from his nostrils as he plucks his cigarette from between his lips. He cocks his head to the side, eyebrows raised as if he was genuinely surprised by Geten’s unwillingness to play happy families. “I’m not sure exactly what happened to you after you decided to go rogue, but if my grandparents are anyone to go by, I’m certain that’s not how the Himuras raised you.”\n\nGeten’s lips draw back in a furious snarl, and Hawks takes note of how the muscles in his exposed forearms tense. If it weren’t for his restraints, he would have lunged at Dabi for certain.\n\n“Corporate fucking dog,” Geten growls, wrestling against his restraints so that the chains clank against the metal surface holding them. “Of course they’d send you. Do they really think I’ll open up and tell you all just because we happen to share a bloodline?”\n\nDabi crosses his legs and flicks away the ash from his cigarette. Hawks doesn’t fail to notice the irritated expression that briefly flashes across Tsukauchi’s expression at that.\n\n“Come on,” Dabi hums with mocking reassurance, “don’t be that way. You really think I’m the type of guy who’d come here with anything other than sincere motives for a member of my own family? I’m heartbroken, Geten. Truly.”\n\nGeten barks a derisive laugh, throwing himself back in his chair as he regards the hero with a loathsome look of disbelief.\n\n“Don’t waste my time even trying to play good cop here, cousin. We both know neither of us give a fuck about family. You want to get me a better cell if I play nice, huh? What, like the one your own mother has?”\n\nHawks winces. The details had never been made public for obvious reasons, but he’d learned whilst leafing through the HPSC files on the Todoroki family, that Dabi’s mother had been institutionalised approximately a decade ago. From the way he senses Tsukauchi tense up at his side, the detective knows that too.\n\nHow a villain is aware of that fact, however… Was it possible Geten still had some contacts within the Himura family? Did the MLA have informants inside of the facility staff? Just how far did this underground web actually spread?\n\nIf Geten had been hoping to provoke a reaction out of Dabi, he had been unsuccessful. Dabi’s expression doesn’t falter for even a second, his attention seemingly more focused on the plume of thick smoke he’s exhaling into the air. Geten’s nose wrinkles in distaste — someone is clearly not a fan of Dabi’s favourite habit.\n\nThe tip of Hawks’ tongue darts out over his lips. Sometimes he can swear he can still taste the nicotine clinging to Dabi’s fingers, from the times that he’d lightly grazed them over Hawks’ mouth.\n\n“Depends on how nice you feel like playing,” Dabi answers, rolling out his shoulders and tilting his head as he fixes the villain with a curious gaze. “I hear you haven’t been particularly forthcoming with the police. You can clam up and play dumb all you like, but no one’s gonna look away from this case simply because you don’t wanna talk. What happened to you, cousin? Did the Meta Liberation Army find you first, or did you go out into the big bad world searching for them?”\n\nGeten hisses, his breath escaping his lungs as a cloud of frost. The room must be freezing, but yet again, Dabi remains unphased.\n\nHe does burn hotter than most people, Hawks supposes, squinting up at the particles of ice flakes that are beginning to form on the other side of the one-way mirror. Hawks can testify to that fact himself.\n\n“The Himuras are an old bloodline,” Tsukauchi murmurs to Hawks as Geten and Dabi settle into a rhythm of seeing who can most successfully work themselves beneath the other’s skin. “Very old. They predate the existence of Quirks themselves, stretching back to even before the agricultural revolution — back when they used to be village leaders. An old family — and proud. An incredibly powerful ice Quirk runs in their lineage, which led them to…rather extreme measures in order to ensure that their bloodline did not dilute. You can see how that became especially problematic after a generation or two.”\n\nHawks doesn’t need it spelled out to him, as much as it turns his stomach.\n\n“Marrying inside the family in order to preserve the purity of the Quirk. I’ve read about these kinds of cases before, especially in families with particularly powerful Quirks. It never ends well.”\n\nTsukauchi gives a small nod, continuing to watch the interrogation in the other room very carefully.\n\n“Their wealth dried up as the family continued to shrink. Many chose to run, especially as family heads began to sell their children into Quirk marriages as a way to preserve their bloodline and try to restore a semblance of their former wealth. Touya — Dabi — was the one who suggested to me that Geten might be one such runaway.”\n\nBlood, Hawks muses to himself, taking note of the similar physical traits that both Dabi and Geten share. He thinks of the vibrant red of his wings, the same colour as his own father’s feathers. The crimson shade of blood itself, the blood that his father had spilled over some petty crime, the blood that Hawks can feel coating these filthy wings of his — the wings that have ended so many lives in the name of the greater good.\n\nBlood’s the one thing that we can never truly run away from.\n\nHawks turns his attention back towards the interrogation room. He had been too busy listening to Tsukauchi to fully take in what exactly had been said within the last several minutes, but whatever Dabi was doing in order to further push Geten into a state of agitation, it was working.\n\n“Pathetic curs,” Geten scoffs, raising his chin and glaring down his nose at him. “So tightly leashed to your masters. You really think I’ll tell any of you a single thing about our greater purpose? A soldier knows more about loyalty than mindless mutts like you.”\n\nHawks recognises the feverish glow in Geten’s steel grey eyes, the eerie gleam that seems to illuminate his pale moon face.\n\n“He’s a fanatic,” Hawks mumbles, mostly to himself. But Tsukauchi nods, his mouth set in a grim, hard line.\n\n“Yeah,” he sighs, rubbing at the side of his neck. Hawks can’t help but notice a small nick from shaving just beneath the detective’s jaw — a probable sign that the recent rise in criminal activity is catching up with him. “I had him pegged as one from the start. Fanatics don’t break so easily — there’s nothing you can promise or threaten them with that will ever persuade them against their cause. Truthfully, I didn’t think Dabi would be able to put a dent in that armour either, but I’d hoped…”\n\nHawks huffs a laugh and pushes a hand through his hair — pocketing his visor once his fingers knock against it. He shoots a grin at Tsukauchi.\n\n“Cheer up, Detective. I’ve only worked with Dabi for a short while, but if there’s anyone I trust to sniff out a weakness, it’s him.”\n\nTsukauchi fixes him with a rueful look, although Hawks doesn’t miss the tiny, grateful smile playing on the other man’s lips.\n\n“Spoken like a man who had to learn that from firsthand experience.”\n\nHawks feels his cheeks colour as he remembers Dabi warm hand wrapped around his own, as they both shared a stolen bottle of champagne the other night, whilst the other cradled Hawks’ waist. Their bodies moulded so perfectly against one another that it was if they were made to be fit together.\n\nWho says things have to get complicated?\n\n“All I’m saying,” Hawks continues, hoping that Tsukauchi doesn’t pick up on how flustered he sounds, “is to have a little faith. If you find Todorokis a pain in the ass, imagine how it must feel for the people who actively dislike them. Like our good friend Geten here.”\n\nTsukauchi rolls his eyes up at the ceiling, before turning back onto the interrogation room — but Hawks is heartened to see that the small smile does not slip from the other man’s lips.\n\nDabi lets out a long sigh and crushes the end of his cigarette into the table, stamping it out that way rather than utilising his usual disintegration tactic. Hawks feels Tsukauchi bristle with irritation beside him — but more than that, he sees the obvious annoyance flash briefly across Geten’s face.\n\n“You sure do love to yap about how very obedient I am to my apparent owners,” Dabi declares, stretching his arms out overhead with a yawn. “But I’m not quick to fall in line. That’s you and your lot. You really think we don’t know that the Meta Liberation Army are involved with the League of Villains?”\n\nGeten’s brow furrows in confusion.\n\n“Who?”\n\nDabi snorts and gives a dismissive flap of his wrist.\n\n“You know. The villains that attacked UA. The ones that came with a weapon prepared to kill All Might. C’mon, cuz, don’t sit here and pretend that doesn’t have you and your anti-establishment crew’s names written all over it.”\n\nTsukauchi scowls, and Hawks can pick up the sound of the detective’s teeth grinding through his feathers.\n\n“That’s classified—”\n\n“Who’s Geten gonna tell?” Hawks interjects, “his cell warden? From what I know about how Tartarus is run, prisoners don’t exactly get yard time together.”\n\nGeten sits upright, and from the way that the muscles in his arms are flexed, Hawks can tell that his hands must be clenched within the iron cage that imprisons them. He can faintly make out the sound of Geten’s chains clattering against their restraints, as the villain’s bound hands shake with anger.\n\n“We would never stoop to something so base — such a crude plan, and with such little—”\n\n“Ah, but you would say that, right?” Dabi interjects with a sneer, “because it failed. Because you failed.”\n\nGeten’s pale face blazes red with indignance, and in that moment, Hawks knows Dabi’s got him.\n\n“I know I don’t have to lecture a cop on the art of interrogation,” Hawks murmurs, conscious of the side-eye that Tsukauchi shoots at him, clearly wary as to whether or not the young hero was mocking him, “you’ve got more experience in it than someone like me. I appreciate that. But I know a thing or two about fanatics, and it’s that there’s only one way to make them crack — and it’s not through making them break in the traditional sense. Dabi could sit there and hurl insults at Geten about his family all day long, and he wouldn’t flinch. Try and make a crack about the very thing that a fanatic is most devoted to, however…”\n\nAs if on cue, Geten slams his cuffed fists down against the table. The heavy sound of steel clattering against the hollow metal surface of the table is loud enough to startle Hawks, even from the next room over.\n\n“We did not fail,” Geten hisses, as he attempts to push himself to his feet. The shackles around his ankles mean that his effort falls somewhat flat — succeeding only so far as scraping his chair back a few inches and his attempt to stand leaves the villain hunched over — but Hawks admires the gusto all the same. “ReDestro does not fail.”\n\nHawks turns his head and lifts a brow in Tsukauchi’s direction — the name ‘ReDestro?’ forming on his lips, but Tsukauchi is two steps ahead of him. The detective had already whipped out his datapad and was in the process of scribbling down the name ‘REDESTRO’ in the middle of what looked to be a pile of personal notes on the case. Hawks decides not to interrupt..\n\nDabi seemingly pretends not to notice Geten’s slip, and instead hunches forward, crossing his arms and resting his elbows on the table. His expression shifts, his smirk shifting into something much more menacing than before. His pierced tongue darts out over his lower lip, the steel glinting against the harsh overhead prison lights.\n\n“But they did fail, cuz,” Dabi insists, leaning forward ever so slightly. He looks far too pleased with himself, and Hawks can tell from watching Geten, that the sight makes his cousin’s blood boil. “They got sloppy, just like you. So damn sloppy that they brought a whole bunch of amateurs into UA, knowing All Might of all fucking people was there — and they really expected to win? Is this what you and your lot mean by preaching about how only those with the strongest Quirks will survive — was this some kinda test you wanted to pitch against the newest generation of heroes?”\n\nGeten shakes his head furiously, his silvery hair whipping in either direction. Hawks notices the flakes of ice forming in the air with each heavy breath that Geten heaves, and shoots a worried frown at the thermostat displaying the temperature in the interrogation room. It’s shot down to -5°Celsius, which has the security guards bundled in their thick wool coats shivering, but Dabi…\n\n“Don’t worry about Dabi,” Tsukauchi murmurs softly — catching Hawks entirely by surprise. He hadn’t expected the detective to notice his concern. “The Quirk Registry says he inherited the Himura’s resistance to sub-zero temperatures. Rest assured, if it drops any colder, we’ll put an end to the interview.”\n\nHe’s resistant to ice? Hawks wonders, turning over the memories he’s shared with the other hero in his head. Dabi surrounded by towering walls of ice when he’d faced off against Geten in Osaka. Dabi unaffected by the night chill as he passed a bottle of champagne back and forth with Hawks the other evening, despite the lack of his usual jacket. Hawks had assumed that Dabi’s fire-type Quirk meant his temperature ran a little hotter than the average person, but clearly it was much more than that.\n\nSo how then to explain how very warm Dabi feels whenever Hawks is in his proximity? Why, then, does Dabi’s skin always simmer with heat whenever Hawks brushes against it?\n\nHawks swallows thickly, and forces his attention back to the interrogation room.\n\nNow is not the time for distractions.\n\nHell — there’s never going to be time for stupid fucking distractions like this kind of thing, and that’s the whole damn reason he’d turned down Dabi’s proposition in the first place.\n\nThis fascination with the other man needs to end.\n\nOnce this mission ends, Hawks can go back to the emptiness that he’s accustomed to.\n\nIn the other room, Geten hunches over, frost beginning to solidify in the sweat patches soaking through his shirt.\n\n“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Geten growls, “but it sounds like you’re describing a collection of amateur idiots. ReDestro would never be so foolish as to attack a stronghold at the apex of its strength, all in order to — what did you say? To kill All Might?”\n\nThe ice villain snorts and jerks at his chains irritably.\n\n“Sounds like the pathetic pipe dream of an egocentric idiot, with no true goal other than to inflate their own sense of self-worth. The Meta Liberation Army — ReDestro — is so much more than that.”\n\nDabi snorts, rolling his eyes towards the ceiling as he slumps back in his chair with his arms folded over his chest.\n\n“Right,” Dabi drawls, “I’ve skimmed the book that inspired the lot of you, and my, what an impressive set of goals you have in mind. Free and liberal use of Quirks for all, yeah? I wonder how well that will work out when someone who can manipulate metal gets impatient at the checkout line, and decides to impale the next person in line with their shopping trolley? What about when a kid goes swimming on the beach, and another child splashes them? What if they use their Quirk to control the tides and sweep them out to sea? Or even worse—”\n\nGeten slams his bound fists back down against the table again, this time snapping the layer of ice that had formed across the surface of the table separating them.\n\n“Heroes like you would never understand,” Geten growls, thrashing against his bindings. “Your narrow minds can’t conceive of a world outside of the one that you’ve already shaped. In ReDestro’s world, the weak will be the natural prey of the strong. You think that your regime is so solidly built that it can never be undone, but you’re blind to the reality. People are waking up and seeing the cracks in the society you’ve structured around yourselves — and it’s not only the civilians that are dissatisfied. There are heroes, too, who realise the limitations that the HPSC have placed upon them, how much more they have to offer the world. The world that once worked so hard to crush people like us beneath the heel of their boot, because we didn’t fit.”\n\nHawks’ feels his chest tighten as his heart flutters with an arrhythmic beat.\n\nThere are heroes too…\n\nHeroes working with villains, Hawks realises, acutely aware of how dry his tongue feels in his mouth.\n\nIt’s a mission statement that he’s read at the beginning of many a manila folder. It’s been the primary purpose for an extermination on more occasions than he can count.\n\nOne of the reasons that Hawks even exists is to eradicate these cases before they can ever come to light.\n\nWhat if there are heroes working with the Meta Liberation Army? Is this why Madame President had assigned him to the case? What would happen if Geten spills the details — would Hawks be forced to cover up this mess, too? What then, for the onlookers? What about Detective Tsukauchi — what about Dabi?\n\nHawks desperately wants to step out of the room and splash cold water onto his face. Preferably even dunk his head under the tap.\n\nBut that’s not an option, so instead he has to continue doing the one thing that he’s worst at — staying still.\n\n“Bullshit,” Dabi snorts, looking decidedly unimpressed by Geten’s outburst. He taps on the frost-covered table between them, as if to command the villain’s attention. Like a teacher speaking to a petulant child. “I don’t know what kind of nonsense they’ve been pumping into your head, cousin. But the only people that stupid fucking dogma is going to appeal to is little lost souls like yourself — wanderers eager to devour whatever is spoonfed to them so long as it provides them with a sense of purpose. Heroes have a purpose — they aren’t gonna fall for a bunch of maniacs preaching about how power lies with the strongest. We know better than that.”\n\nTsukauchi lets out a low whistle.\n\n“He sure knows how to find a weak spot and sink his teeth into it,” the detective admits, his stylus hovering over the datapad, waiting, “I gotta hand him that.”\n\nThat he does, Hawks agrees, wordlessly. He keeps one gloved hand pressed over his mouth, rubbing at his chin pensively to mask the concern that he’s sure must be showing on his face. I just wish he could let this particular one thing go.\n\nGeten drops back into his seat, his head hanging low. For a moment, Hawks thinks the fight might have finally gone out of him — before the villain’s shoulders begin to shake, and Hawks realises that he’s laughing.\n\n“‘We’,” Geten repeats, mockingly, raising his head and peering at Dabi between greasy strands of his fringe. His cold grey eyes glint like the sun reflecting off a rock pool — except there’s no traces of warmth there. Not anymore. Not since he’d been captured and cast down here — down, down, into the Gates of Hell. “You really are one of them, aren’t you, Touya? Or should I say Dabi.”\n\nGeten grins at the other man, and something about it sets an unpleasant prickle beneath Hawks’ skin — as if the cold from the other room has leaked through the thick shield of the window. He shifts on his feet and tugs his aviator jacket tighter around him.\n\n“All you heroes — you’re a damned con, each and every single one of you. The people put you on your pedestals, and you devour the attention, the adoration, oh-so-very eagerly. You love to act like there’s some kind of noble intent behind your actions, but at the heart of it — you’re all greedy little boot-lickers, desperate for a pat on the head to tell you that you did good.”\n\n“I gather that the heroes who flock to your side see it so very differently,” Dabi retorts, dryly. He looks completely disinterested as he reaches to collect his pack of cigarettes. .\n\n“They see the truth of it,” Geten snaps back at Dabi, “they see all the fractures accumulating in hero society, so of course they’re looking for somewhere else to turn. Because it will all turn to shit someday, Touya, and sooner than you think. You and your father can continue sweeping all the dirty secrets beneath the rug as much as you want, but eventually the truth will come to light. Tell me, cuz — what do you say to the press, when they ask after your poor, beloved mother? Do you stick to the line that you’ve been given — that she’s frail of health — or do you tell the truth? Do you think that your family are the only people who know about what went on behind those walls of yours? Shouto must have started UA by now, right? How long do you think you can hide—”\n\nDabi stands up, abruptly.\n\n“It’s always such a joy, catching up with family,” Dabi drawls, plucking a fresh cigarette out from the pack. Hawks is almost certain that Dabi’s hands are shaking, however unaffected he might otherwise seem. “We really must do it more often. Thanks for the info, cuz — we’ll be sure to look into those heroes linked to the MLA that you mentioned. Might even tell them that you said hello.”\n\nGeten’s face pales in realisation and his jaw goes slack. Hawks might have taken a little pleasure out of that, if it were not for the uncomfortable feeling lodged deep in the pit of his stomach, its roots wrapping themselves around his insides.\n\n“I didn’t—” Geten tries to protest, stumbling over his words as the prison guards approach him. “I never said that — get your hands off me, you pigs — I never said there was — Touya, wait!”\n\nDabi slips the lucifer between his lips, and leaves the interrogation room without looking back.\n\nTsukauchi sees the pair of them out.\n\n“A message was left with the guards,” the detective had told them both, once they passed through the final security checks on their way out of Tartarus. “The HPSC President wants to see the both of you at once. She’s sent a car to bring you both back immediately to the Commission — no stops or detours.”\n\nDabi clucks his tongue, chidingly.\n\n“And after I’m sure my old man’s chauffeur came all this way. Such a terrible waste of gas money.”\n\nHawks snorts in amusement.\n\n“I’m sure I can swing for the HPSC to reimburse it. The Endeavor Agency won’t be running out of yen quite yet.”\n\n“You think that’s what I’m worried about?” Dabi rebukes, his eyebrows shooting up in exaggerated offence. “No, no — I’m all about the environment, me.”\n\nAs if to accentuate his point, he gives another flick of his wrist and sends the ends of his cigarette up in a sparkling inferno of blue flames.\n\nHawks has to muffle his laughter into his fist as Tsukauchi throws Dabi a withering look.\n\n“I meant it when I said it’s a ‘no smoking’ facility, Dabi. The rules apply to you too. Abiding by the rules is one of the core aspects of what sets us apart from villains.”\n\n“You know,” Dabi hums, falling into step alongside Hawks whilst still speaking to Tsukauchi, “you sound so much like my dad sometimes.”\n\nTsukauchi’s exaggerated groan is more than enough to send both Dabi and Hawks into another helpless fit of sniggers, even as the heavy gates of Tartarus slowly shut behind them.\n\nThe sleek black car sent by the Commission zips in practical silence across the long bridge that separates Tartarus from the rest of Japan.\n\nHawks envies Dabi his vices. He would love something to indulge in right now, to fight off the gnawing discomfort crawling beneath his skin. He knows the President has most likely called the pair of them to her office specifically because of what Geten had said — that the MLA had heroes among their ranks. The real question is what did it mean that Dabi now knew this? Tsukauchi too, not to mention the number of guards who had watched the interrogation? The interrogation logs themselves?\n\nHawks’ fingers twitch and he bites his lip, purposefully flexing his left hand in and out of a fist.\n\nThey won’t ask you to get rid of Endeavor’s son, he tries to rationalise to himself, especially not with so many eyes on us. There’s too much of a trail that could be easily tracked, surely I can—\n\n“Hey, birdie,” Dabi calls, abruptly dragging Hawks’ out of his frankly fucking insane train of thought. “Got something on your mind?”\n\nHawks turns his head, and watches as spectrums of light fall across Dabi’s pale face as the car glides through the city streets.\n\n“I’d be a poor excuse of a hero if I was sitting here lost in a daydream,” he quips, flashing the other man a forced grin. He knows that Dabi will see right through the bullshit, but it never hurts to try.\n\nDabi sighs and leans his head against the car window. The light from the street lamps outside whip past them, illuminating the car in brief flashes of neon lightning. It flatters Dabi’s profile, casting him in shades that make Hawks think of a fresco painting. Frozen in the moment; caught eternal and otherworldly.\n\n“I know you wanna ask,” Dabi mutters, rapping his fingers against the plush leather car seat. “So go on. Ask.”\n\nHawks’ breath hitches in his chest.\n\n“I don’t know what you’re—”\n\nHe’s cut off by Dabi holding up his hand and fixing Hawks with a surprisingly chilling glare.\n\n“Sure you do. Don’t pretend that all those insights into my family courtesy of my charming cousin didn’t catch your interest. I’ve known from the start what a nosy little bird you are, remember?”\n\nTell me, cuz — what do you say to the press, when they ask after your poor, beloved mother?\n\nHawks shifts in his seat, prodding at the inside of his cheek with the tip of his tongue.\n\n“I didn’t want to pry,” he lies. Dabi narrows his eyes, as if able to hear the deceit in Hawks’ tone. It’s an uncomfortable thought.\n\n“If we’re supposed to be partners,” Dabi retorts, sounding strangely bitter, “then we should be honest with each other, yeah? So just fucking ask.”\n\nHawks looks at him and frowns.\n\n“Do you want me to ask?” he inquires, his brow furrowed. If the driver that the HPSC sent is currently listening in on them, then Hawks knows that Madame President will be displeased by Hawks’ question. A good spy never turns down an open opportunity to learn more from their target and whilst the President has never explicitly stated it, they both know that Touya Todoroki is a target. He’s young and exploitable, and everyone knows that some day, All Might will eventually have to retire — leaving Endeavor to fill the ill-fitted boots of being Number One. A role that he’s seemingly unsuited for, but there’s never been a way to properly assess his condition, given the distance that the Number Two hero insists on maintaining from the Commission.\n\nUntil now. Until the Commission had essentially gotten their ‘in’ by having their very own protégé team up with Endeavor’s firstborn son. The most excellent candidate to provide insight into the future Number One that Madame President is so very worried about.\n\nDabi sighs and makes a flippant gesture, letting his head fall back against the window.\n\n“It was an arranged marriage,” he begins, his fingers flexing on top of his lap. Hawks has known Dabi long enough by now to recognise that the other man is itching for a cigarette. “My mother…struggled. With my dad, with us kids — with all of it. It reached a point where my old man had to institutionalise her for the sake of the whole family’s safety, including her own. That was about…ten years ago now? She’s still in there. I don’t get to see her too much. Hero work takes up most of my time — well, I suppose I don’t need to tell you that .”\n\nDabi keeps his cerulean blue eyes trained away, watching the rest of the world flash by. Hawks feels the strangest urge to reach out and hold his hand.\n\n“I’m—” Hawks hesitates, inhaling a deep breath. “I’m — I’m really sorry, Touya.”\n\nDabi’s burning gaze flickers towards him.\n\n“Look at you, getting so familiar,” he teases — but Hawks notices that the usual trace of playfulness has faded from his tone. That interview with Geten had drained him, no matter how hard he fights to hide the fact. “How about this — you can call me Touya if you tell me your real name too.”\n\nHawks bites his lip and forces a small smile.\n\n“What, and have you dig up my sordid past? That’s far too scandalous.”\n\nSomething Hawks had learned along the years was that if you scattered just the right amount of truth into the bullshit, it made the lies sound that much more believable. Fortunately, the gamble in this case seems to pay off, as Dabi raises his eyebrows and lets out a derisive snort.\n\n“I can only imagine what kind of skeletons you keep in the closet,” he drawls, idly rapping his knuckles against the windowpane. “You got any family yourself?”\n\nIt strikes Hawks all of a sudden that this is the closest thing to a normal conversation that he can remember having in quite some time.\n\n“They’re not in the picture.”\n\nDabi nods, considering this fact.\n\n“Easier that way?”\n\n“Almost certainly.”\n\nSilence falls as the car emerges into the lively streets of Tokyo. Hawks has never been a fan of crowds, but they’re a welcome sight after the horrifying isolation of Tartarus.\n\n“You hear the news about Ingenium?” Dabi asks Hawks, his gaze turned back out towards the world beyond the window once more. The other man flexes his fingers a final time, before forcing them to settle — smoothing his hand out over his lap, bunching the loose white fabric of his pants.\n\n“About the Hero Killer?” Hawks replies, wincing at the uncomfortable feeling of guilt that wraps itself around his heart and holds on with a vice-like grip. It looks like himself and Ingenium never will have the race that Hawks kept putting off. “Yeah. I heard.”\n\nHe should have found time for that race. They’re heroes — all they have is borrowed time, after all.\n\n“Right,” Dabi answers, reaching up to absently scratch at his chin. “That’s what they’re calling him. Didn’t manage to kill Ingenium, however.”\n\n“But he came close,” Hawks murmurs, fighting off a shiver. He’d read Tensei Iida’s medical reports, after discreetly procuring them from Madame President’s office without her knowledge. The doctors had managed to save Ingenium’s life, but not his legs. He had been left paralysed from the waist down by the attack, spelling an early end to his career as a Pro Hero.\n\nWhilst Ingenium’s Engine Quirk was built into his elbows, even the most sophisticated of wheelchairs would find it impossible to compensate for the explosive speed that his body was capable of producing. It was unlikely that he’d ever be able to use his Quirk again.\n\nThe thought sends a wave of nausea washing over Hawks as he instinctively curls his wings around him, even within the cramped space of the car.\n\nWhat was a hero, without his Quirk?\n\nNothing at all.\n\n“I’m not one for conspiracies,” Dabi says, his breath creating small clouds of fog against the window, “but I also don’t believe in coincidences.We’ve got this ‘ReDestro’ guy, along with the so-called League of Villains. Now the Hero Killer — all within a couple of weeks. I’m not a fucking idiot, I know resistance against the status quo is a given in this line of work. But all these successful attacks suggest a level of organisation that is…suspect, to say the least.”\n\nHell, Hawks hates how alike himself and Dabi think.\n\n“You think that they’re all related?” he queries, “that they’re all operating beneath the same ringleader? The one who wanted to kill All Might?”\n\nDabi lifts his shoulders in a shrug.\n\n“Maybe,” he replies, drawing idle patterns in the fog canvas he’s created on the car window. “Maybe not. It would be stupid to ignore the possibility, though — if they’re not working together now, then they sure as hell will be soon. The UA attack was a fairly decent demonstration of just how powerful attacking in numbers can be — especially when facing off Pros who are not only stronger, but have the experience and technique to boot.”\n\nHawks mulls that over for a moment, stroking his chin thoughtfully.\n\n“If they’re all linked,” he answers, after a few moments of thought, “then we’re looking at someone with an awful lot of power pulling the strings. Someone who has access to UA’s security protocols and teaching schedules, as well as the details of any given Pro Hero’s patrol route. If we have traitors in our midst…”\n\nHis mouth feels dry.\n\n…then how many of them are there? Is this the kind of mess that I can clean up? Or are things already too far gone?\n\nHawks scrubs his gloved hand over his mouth, trying to mask his expression.\n\n“...the public would lose faith in heroes, if they knew they were collaborating with villains,” he continues, rubbing at his jaw. “Whatever is happening, we need to learn the truth of it before it can come to light. This mission just got a whole lot more serious, Dabi.”\n\nDabi peers at him, curiously.\n\n“I wasn’t exactly planning on taking it easy, Number Two,” he drawls, knocking his knee pointedly against Hawks’. “As much fun as it is playing the role of ‘arm candy’ to Japan’s most eligible bachelor, I do actually take my job somewhat seriously, y’know. You might recall that I was the one reluctant to join you in putting on this whole charade to please the people, because I was more concerned about catching the bad guys. You had to convince me. So what gives? Why the sudden nerves?”\n\nFuck, but Hawks really wishes he didn’t have to deal with the cloying claustrophobia of the car alongside everything else right now. Everything feels like it’s pressing in on him too tightly, too cramped, when all he wants to do is stretch his wings and fly.\n\nWhen Dabi had thought that Hawks’ earlier discomfort was the result of trying to politely refrain from digging into the Todoroki family’s secrets, Hawks had hoped that would be the end of it.\n\nTrust Dabi to notice that the anxious itch beneath Hawks’ skin had not settled.\n\nHe doesn’t like how well Dabi can read him. Not one bit.\n\nHawks heaves a sigh, making a show of attempting to shrug out his shoulders and grimacing when his wings are crushed uncomfortably behind him against the leather car seat, the ends of his primaries wedged at an awkward angle against the car window.\n\nIf he can’t mask his own emotions, he can at least try to obscure the source of them.\n\n“I fucking hate cars,” he admits, wincing as he rubs at an aching muscle in his neck. “They’re too damned cramped, and I’m used to the freedom of the sky. Sorry — it puts me in a bad mood. Didn’t mean to take it out on you.”\n\nHawks shakes a stubborn strand of fringe out of his face, and tries to adjust his wings back into a more comfortable position. The task is made considerably more difficult by the fact he’s doing his damndest to avoid brushing his feathers against Dabi — he doubts the other man would mind, but Hawks most certainly does not need to feel the pulse of Dabi’s heartbeat thrumming through the shaft of one of his feather’s rachises right now.\n\n“I only mean…this whole assignment is likely to get a whole lot bigger than either of us was briefed for. Like — a lot bigger. I’m pretty sure the Commission is going to want to keep this operation as small as possible, given the sensitivity of the information on the line. So I guess I’m asking you… Are you still up for this?”\n\nHawks meets Dabi’s eyes, glowing even brighter from the light of the street lamps whipping by them outside. He already knows the answer is yes. Touya Todoroki has never been one to back down from a challenge — Hawks knew this about him before he’d even met the man.\n\nBut still. It’s the right thing to do: to offer Dabi a way out, before potentially dragging him down into the inevitable mess that lay ahead.\n\nAnd if you say you’re prepared for what you know we’re going to face, Hawks tells himself, then the President will have to listen to me. You can be an ally — not another name that needs to be crossed off of a list, in order to preserve our nation’s secrets.\n\nThe hapless strand of golden hair that Hawks had been trying to huff away has fallen directly back over his eye. Dabi takes the liberty of reaching out and tucking it gently back behind Hawks’ ear for him — his fingertips lingering at the twitching muscle in Hawks’ neck longer than they should.\n\n“There you go again, always chirping about what the Commission is going to want,” Dabi mumbles with surprising softness. Hawks has always known the other hero to use the intensity of his gaze to his advantage — whether to unnerve or to beguile — but peculiarly, he doesn’t quite meet Hawks’ golden eyes this time. Instead, he seems to drink in Hawks’ whole visage in a way that feels borderline obscene. Hawks would liken it to being stripped nude, but he’s gone in various states of undress for photoshoots before and hasn’t batted an eyelid — he’s used to the necessity of using his body as a selling point. This — this — whatever this is, feels more intimate than even sex ever has for Hawks. “You’re too clever a bird to be kept in a cage.”\n\nDabi’s index and pointer finger graze over Hawks’ jugular, pressing down against it with just the faintest touch of pressure. Hawks has to swallow down a whimper, and considers for what must be the umpteenth time how easy it would be to sink into what Dabi is so wantonly offering him.\n\nJust let go.\n\nBut he can’t.\n\nHe can’t, because Hawks knows that if he allows himself to fall into this pit of terrifying desire, there will be no clawing himself back out of it.\n\nHawks exhales a breathless laugh, easing himself back into the car’s seat and away from where he’d felt himself sinking into Dabi’s intoxicating warmth. That stupid stubborn strand of fringe has fallen over his eyes, and he quickly attempts to smooth it back into place before Dabi gets the chance to.\n\n“Clever enough to be the one that keeps our wits about them, I think,” he quips, hoping that his face doesn’t look as red as it feels.\n\nThe flash of disappointment across Dabi’s face is brief, falling away almost as quickly as it appears, but Hawks catches it all the same. Hawks feels the same nauseous churning in his stomach that he experienced the last time — after the party, where Dabi had been brave enough to address the tension lingering between them, and dared to suggest acting upon it.\n\nAnd Hawks had told him ‘no’ — in spite of everything inside of him that wanted so desperately to scream ‘yes’.\n\nWe shouldn’t complicate things, Hawks had told Dabi back then. That remains true — more so now than ever before, especially as they were en fucking route to the woman who might easily order Dabi’s assassination for the crime of knowing too much.\n\nIt still fucking hurts, though. Watching some of the fire die out of Dabi’s eyes, and his mouth realign itself back into a straight line.\n\nWhatever Dabi is truly feeling, he keeps it to himself. The drumming of his fingertips on his lap suggest a certain agitation, all the same.\n\nHawks is surprised when Dabi suddenly nudges his knee against his own again, a wicked grin suddenly spreading across his face.\n\n“Your plan didn’t go so well, y’know,” he chides Hawks, with one of those damned looks that sets every nerve ending in Hawks’ body alight. When Hawks simply shoots him a baffled expression in return, Dabi chuckles before continuing. “You know. The whole plan that you were promising would send me soaring to the top of the hero ranking charts? Not that I give a shit about any of that stuff, but it must have stung, pretty bird, seeing yourself knocked off of the front pages of the tabloids, eh?”\n\nHawks rolls his eyes, crossing his arms over his chest with a huff as he tries to awkwardly sit back into his seat. No matter how luxurious the car he’s sent, he’ll never be able to settle comfortably — and he’s always fought vehemently against the idea of getting one customised in order to accommodate his wings.\n\nIf he has a chance to fly, he’ll take it.\n\n“Terrible timing,” Hawks coyly admits, absently tugging at the stray strand of hair that Dabi had been robbed of the chance of tucking away. “I suppose you’ll have to come up with something twice as scandalous the next time, if you want to really grab their attention.”\n\nDabi cocks an eyebrow at him, a coy smirk playing on his lips.\n\n“Next time?”\n\n“Next time,” Hawks echoes, trying to not think too hard about whether or not there can be a next time. “Any suggestions for a headline-grabber?”\n\nDabi snorts, shaking his head in amusement. He smooths his ashen fringe away from his face, turning to face Hawks as he does. The bright lights of Tokyo’s city bathe his pale face in an ethereal glow, painting him in the visage of something lost long ago. Like the ancient sculptures from distant continents that were centuries old, the kinds that Hawks has glimpsed in museums before.\n\nThose ancient visages always hinted at a wry cunning, whilst simultaneously hinting at a wariness that betrays what it means to know so much.\n\n“One or two,” Dabi chuckles, jiggling his knee as he considers his answer. It brushes against Hawks’ leg, but jostles away before Hawks can fully register it.\n\nBy the time he does, Dabi is peering back out the window at the streets streaking by.\n\n“One or two.”"
