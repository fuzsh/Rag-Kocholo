        "text": "WITH the 12-year run of \"NYPD Blue\" ending tonight, I have to confess deep affection for the show, and not just because of its much lauded realism.\n\nThe show started when I was a rookie in New York, and I was struck by how much Detective John Kelly, played by David Caruso, seemed like some of the guys at my station house. I recognized his wonder at the cruelties of the world. I also recognized the anger in Dennis Franz's Andy Sipowicz: the bizarre mix of nobility and self-destructiveness. But most of all, I recognized the language and the sets. The grungy office really did look just like the one in my precinct, and the producers used the old Ninth Precinct station house on East Fifth Street for the outside shots.\n\nYes, the dialogue was highly stylized, but it was a style pretty close to that of a lot of real detectives. (This was no wonder -- the show's creator, Steven Bochco, recruited a veteran homicide detective, Bill Clark, to be a co-producer.) Even after I had a few years on the job, I had to ask the veterans about the more obscure terms from the show: we all knew \"61\" (a complaint report) and \"skel\" (a dirtbag). But what is a \"yellow sheet\"? A \"57\"? (A rap sheet and a request for a transfer, respectively.)\n\nReal cops are not usually fans of cop shows -- I don't know any who like \"CSI,\" be it set in Miami, New York or Peoria -- but \"NYPD Blue\" was popular with my colleagues. That the public cared to watch a show that looked and sounded a little like us was flattering. I had a commander in Narcotics who had a picture of a woman on his desk; I always assumed it was his wife. One day I looked closely and saw that it was an autographed picture of Kim Delaney, who played Detective Diane Russell on the show.\n\nMany police officers maintain that the most realistic police show in the history of television was the sitcom \"Barney Miller,\" far more so than that father of reality TV, \"Cops.\" The action was mostly off screen, the squad room the only set, and the guys were a motley bunch of character actors who were in no danger of being picked for the N.Y.P.D. pin-up calendar. But they worked hard, made jokes, got hurt and answered to their straight-man commander.\n\nFor real detectives, most of the action does happen off screen, and we spend a lot of time back in the squad room writing reports about it. Like Barney Miller's squad, we crack jokes at one another, at the cases that come in, and at the crazy suspect locked in the holding cell six feet from the new guy's desk. Life really is more like \"Barney Miller\" than \"NYPD Blue,\" but our jokes aren't nearly as funny.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
