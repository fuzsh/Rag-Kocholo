        "text": "Chapter Text\n\nHe didn’t have any misconceptions that finding Cheshire would be easy, but he hadn’t taken the time to properly prepare himself for just how frustrating it was going to be.\n\nThe digital search was yielding nothing. They hadn't had much time to dive into everything when it first happened. They ran their search and ran it again but at the time there wasn't much else they could do. Eraserhead was busy coordinating a raid, Present Mic became passionate about vigilantes, and Hizashi nervously checked recent deaths.\n\nNothing came from any of it.\n\nThey hadn’t talked about Cheshire much. Shouta hadn't even let himself consider the idea that Cheshire was dead. He was confident that Chiyo and Hizashi had done enough.\n\nHizashi didn't seem to think so.\n\nCheshire disappeared, or at least, he hadn't been spotted since Hizashi’s run-in with him. Shouta thought that was as good a sign as any. The vigilante was healing. He'd clearly been alright enough to erase both their memories and get out of there alive.\n\nStill, it was like that cat in a box. Eraser found nothing on the quirk registration, and Hizashi found no sign of anyone matching that description dying recently.\n\nSo they didn't talk about it, because it wasn’t exactly a joyous topic but also because there wasn't much to talk about. They didn’t have anything new, and they simply didn't have the time to look. Hizashi didn't sleep, but neither did Shouta. They were just too busy.\n\nNow they had all the time in the world to be stumped by the young vigilante.\n\nWhile Hizashi was in the hospital he decided to simply skim through the results himself. He ran a few different searches, combing through them one by one when he had the time. If he could, he’d start brainstorming Cheshire’s routes and patrols, and he did, based on his older sightings, but there still wasn’t anything new for him to go off of.\n\nHe didn’t want to think about why that might be, so for now, he focused on the searches.\n\nHe didn’t bring Hizashi into it immediately, he didn’t even bring it up. He kept his work phone firmly in his pocket when Hizashi was awake, only pulling it out once to mute Detective Sawaya’s angry calls.\n\nAnd when he was sure Hizashi was asleep, he researched Cheshire.\n\nHe envied detectives before quirks. In some ways things were easier now. Mutant quirks for example were fairly easy to identify, or at least it was usually not too difficult to get the right family.\n\nIn a lot of ways though, quirks just made people harder to find.\n\nPeople were more unique now, which, in theory, sounds better. There are just too many factors now. Take Shouta for example. He very specifically had an emitter quirk, but his eyes suggest that at some point his bloodline had mutated at least a bit, and whatever the hell it was his hair did had to be left over from some unrelated quirk.\n\nThe thing they knew the most about was Cheshires' quirk, and that had been no help.\n\nIt didn’t help that the files they were using were quirk records since they suspected he was underage. Quirk records were the most annoying files to use. They were often old and out of date, at least when it came to power level and evolved abilities.\n\nThere were other records they could use, but to do that they’d have to open an official case, and everything they searched would be cataloged, and maybe no one was watching, maybe no one cared what Eraserhead was up to.\n\nHe was paranoid, sure, but he couldn’t stand the idea of a trail.\n\nHe didn’t want this on the kids' record, he didn’t want this to ruin his future, whatever future that may be. He was a kid trying to do the right thing. He helped save lives.\n\nBut how long could he let this go on?\n\nSo, yes, they had new information, but nothing solid, nothing concrete. They knew things, but they didn’t know enough. They didn’t know anything important.\n\nLike how a kid like that even starts doing something like this in the first place.\n\nObviously, his quirk suited the life quite well. He had yet to see what it took to activate the quirk, but from what he knew, he could put a villain to sleep and avoid any violence at all.\n\nBut why was he doing it?\n\nHe was young. Even if it was done once in a childish attempt to play hero, it has evolved far past that. Assuming he was enrolled in school, when was this kid sleeping? Did his quirk somehow allow him to need less sleep? What were his parents doing about this? Were they encouraging it? Maybe they were also vigilantes, or perhaps even villains. Maybe that's where his connection to the hero killer came from.\n\nThey had useless surface-level information.\n\nLuckily, as Hizashi said, Shouta had experience with strays.\n\nIn the end, Hizashi was in the hospital for four days. Leaving was more of an event than they planned. Somehow, news had gotten out that there were a few heroes hospitalized, and, while nothing was confirmed, many of his fans suspected Present Mic was among them.\n\nThey tried their best.\n\nTensei waited outside the door, for reasons Shouta wasn’t completely sure of, Chiyo was there, because Shouta asked her to be, and so was Nemuri. The three of them were listening to the rundown of Hizashi’s condition, and how healing might look for him at home. Shouta flicked a glance over to Chiyo when the nurses said that, but her lips just pressed straighter.\n\nThey thought everything was normal until someone knocked on the door, peaking his head in to inform them of the chaos outside.\n\nThe best they managed to do was convince the paparazzi to move a few meters back, for the safety of other patients. It didn’t help them sneak Hizashi out.\n\nHizashi sighed as he slid into the car, and the rest of them were packed into the back before anything else could go wrong.\n\n“I looked right at a camera,” Tensei groaned when they started moving.\n\nNemuri laughed, and then so did Tensei, and then Chiyo was making fun of them for being pro heroes and still being unable to do a task so simple.\n\nShouta didn’t laugh, instead, he tilted his head to find Hizashi leaning his head back against the headrest, watching for a few brief moments as airy laughs slipped past his lips.\n\nIt took more than a week after Hizashi got out of the hospital for them to get news that Cheshire was spotted again.\n\nThings started to pick up then.\n\nHizashi, despite still healing, seemed much more chipper after they got the news. As for Shouta, the work he put in trying to track Cheshire’s patrol patterns hadn’t been a complete waste. He seemed to pick up right where he left off as if he hadn’t taken a break at all.\n\nHe went out looking for him that night. It still wasn’t easy, and it was almost entirely guesswork. Sure, he had information on where Cheshire used to be, but if there was a pattern, he couldn’t find it.\n\nWell, he did know that Cheshire didn’t seem to go to the same areas within the same week, he’d avoid it even longer the bigger the takedown.\n\nOther than that, it was completely guesswork with a touch of luck.\n\nEven if he guessed the correct area, he’d have to hope that both he and Cheshire just happened to run into each other, and he never has had that great of luck.\n\nStill, he went out every night. He kept himself relatively in one place. He’d occasionally leave his perch, swinging from roof to roof in a quick sweep of the area, and then he’d plant himself down again, watching and waiting.\n\nHis attempts paid off much sooner than he had expected.\n\nHe had heard the criminals first, they weren’t exactly trying to be quiet. He landed a bit rough, stepping closer to the edge to find the two giggling, spray cans in hand. He unraveled his scarf, ready to lower himself when movement out of the corner of his eye caught his attention.\n\nThe hooded figure dropped from an emergency escape into the alley next to the two of them. Eraser stepped back, dropping low. He didn’t let his hopes up. It wouldn’t be the first time he saw some civilian in a dark hood and dared to hope.\n\nMost civilians didn’t drop into alleyways and peek out at criminals.\n\nMost civilians didn’t approach vandals.\n\nThe figure stepped out of the alley, and the street lights lit his face, or at least the part that was visible despite the mask, and Eraser moved. In a moment of indecision, he stood up straight his scarf unfurling for a moment before dropping jerkily back down when the voice called out.\n\n“Hey,” The man he was fairly certain now was Cheshire said, “What the hell are you doing?”\n\nHe wouldn’t linger long, but he was intrigued. This was Cheshire perfectly in his element, no heroes, no police, just him and the criminals.\n\nOne of them threw a spray can, and they erupted in laughter.\n\nCheshire seemed unfazed. He simply stepped forward in response, pulling a can from their grip.\n\n“I’ll call the cops.” He spat, and Eraserhead leaned forward, his capture weapon unfurling.\n\nHe couldn’t have that.\n\nEven if he was bluffing, Eraser couldn’t risk it.\n\n“What? Why?” One of the criminals sputtered as he threw out his scarf, latching it onto a street lamp.\n\n“You’re breaking and entering.”\n\n“Breaking.” The other said firmly, his head turning just as Eraser pulled himself forward, “We weren’t planning on entering.”\n\n“Destruction of property is still illegal,” He said as he landed, pulling his scarf back in. Cheshire jumped, moving to the side, turning towards him. The vandals, on the other hand, stood straighter, flashing nervous glances at each other.\n\n“It was- It was just an accident,” one of them said.\n\n“And the paint?” Eraser asked, activating his quirk.\n\nFor a moment, they just stood there, either considering their option or trying to wrap their heads around the situation.\n\nAnd then they ran.\n\nAll three of them, Cheshire included, though Cheshire was at least smart enough to head the other way. He handled the criminals quickly, wrapping his scarf around one and pulling them back towards him before they even took a step. He pulled himself into the air, bringing the captured one with him, and hanging them on a street lamp.\n\nHe grabbed the other one easily, pulling him back and hanging him on the same lamp. He quickly unraveled that part of his capture weapon, sending an alert and pulling himself the other way.\n\nCheshire was fast but, without the help of a speed quirk, Eraser was faster than most people. It wasn’t too long before he caught up, throwing out the other end of his scarf to pull him back a bit. He was just trying to slow him down and show him he wasn’t actually trying to arrest him.\n\nCheshire didn’t seem to realize that though.\n\nInstead, he turned into an alley, and Eraser lost a lot of momentum.\n\nThe sudden change in strategy felt intentional like he knew this would slow him down. How many times has this happened? How many times has Cheshire had to run from Eraserhead?\n\nHe was good at it.\n\nCheshire was losing him. Not by a ton, but every time he was given a chance to gain some ground, Cheshire was turning again, and he lost the momentum he could’ve gained.\n\nAnd then they reached a dead end.\n\nHe dropped to the ground immediately, curling what was left of his scarf back around his neck.\n\n“Cheshire,” He said simply, taking deep breaths.\n\nThe vigilante tensed, only turning a little, giving none of his face away.\n\nEraser blinked, taking in the hunched form. It had been maddening, just days ago he was driving himself mad trying to remember anything. Now, standing here, it felt- wrong.\n\n\"You look different.\"\n\nHe hadn’t even really thought to say it. There could be a lot of explanations for why it wasn’t quite clicking in his mind. He could barely even see him now, but he still seemed- taller, even as hunched as he was now, and the color wasn’t quite right.\n\n\"Upgraded.\" He answered simply.\n\nAnd Eraser nodded, scanning the vigilante.\n\n\"I can see that.\"\n\nIt wasn’t really a lie. He had seen it, he just hadn’t been able to piece it together, not in a normal way. Cheshire turned his head a little more, scanning him for a second before saying, ”You look the exact same.\"\n\nHe nodded, trying desperately not to cringe at his own terrible people skills as he asked, \"How are you?\"\n\nCheshire scoffed, \"Don't do that.\"\n\n\"I'm curious.” He admitted, sounding far more believable that time, “You disappeared for a bit there.\"\n\n\"Did I?\" He said simply, turning his head away again but stepping closer. \"I hadn't noticed.\"\n\nHe took a breath, trying desperately to get a solid footing in this conversation. His eyes dropped to his shoulders, taking in the way they were hunched. He didn’t seem to be in pain, and Eraser wasn’t even sure which shoulder he should be watching. He wanted to ask, to be more specific.\n\nHe didn’t want to scare him off.\n\nHe should’ve thought this through more, should’ve prepared a speech or something. Instead, he was stuck here, fumbling through it.\n\nThis would be so much easier if he was just trying to arrest him.\n\n\"Your work paid off.\" He said, causing Cheshire to freeze. \"The raid against the insiders was a success.\"\n\n\"I saw. Took you long enough.\"\n\nHe nodded a fraction, \"Took time to do it right.\"\n\nToo much time.\n\nCheshire nodded, \"How was it?\"\n\nHe took a page from Hizashi’s book then, saying, “You never answered my question.”\n\n“What question?”\n\n“How are you?”\n\nCheshire was quiet for a moment before sighing and saying, “I’m fine. How was the raid?”\n\nBarely an answer, and almost certainly not a truthful one.\n\nHis eyes darted to his shoulders again, but this time he was quick to pick them up.\n\n\"Went better than I expected.\" He admitted anyway, forcing himself to breathe, to relax his shoulders.\n\nHe didn’t know how to look relaxed, or friendly.\n\n\"Better?\"\n\nHe nodded, and Cheshire stared at him for a moment before stepping back, “Seemed like a bit of a mess.”\n\n“I expected it to go wrong.” He replied, answering more honestly than he’d planned to. “How’d you get all that information?” He asked, changing the topic.\n\n“Does it matter?”\n\nIf he’s somehow wrapped up with the villains it mattered. If he had more friends like the hero killer, then it mattered.\n\n“Not really.”\n\nCheshire shrugged, \"Luck mostly,\"\n\nHe leaned back, desperately trying to keep the conversation going, \"How long are you staying out?\"\n\n\"Until I get bored.\"\n\nEraserhead nodded, \"I guess that's the advantage of doing this your way.\"\n\nCheshire turned his head away, \"What do you want?\"\n\nWhat did he want?\n\nAnswers, mostly. He wanted to know how this could’ve happened, how someone like him could’ve made it this far, how he was connected to the hero killer and why. He needed to understand why he was so willing to give up that connection for some random hero wandering the street.\n\nFor his husband.\n\n\"To say thank you.\"\n\nCheshire stepped back, finally lifting his head properly. He met them then, the purple eyes, and Eraser looked, really looked, desperately trying to store this memory away somewhere Cheshire couldn’t reach.\n\n\"What? What for?\"\n\nToo much\n\nHe reached into his pocket, pulling out the cigarette box. It was empty now, but he still felt the need to bring it with him.\n\nHe wasn’t entirely sure why.\n\n\"I didn't even know the insiders existed. Not until this.\" It was a bit of a lie, but not entirely. He knew of their existence, but not much else. \"We saved lives with this.\"\n\n\"Technically, the person undercover helped save lives.\"\n\n\"You helped save his.\"\n\n\"So, he's safe?\"\n\nHe took a deep breath. That was part of the problem.\n\nHe hadn’t talked to Tsukauchi, not directly, and he had been avoiding checking over any files other than the ones strictly necessary. He really hadn’t wanted to know Tsukauchi’s decision.\n\nHe didn’t really get a choice.\n\nThe same detective who’d accompanied him during his interrogation of Ishikawa had called him, because Sawaya’s calls weren’t going through, and put him on the phone with one Song Kun. The officers were working to sort everything out for him, but apparently he’d wanted to thank both Eraserhead and Cheshire personally.\n\nHe supposed, in the end, the secret wouldn’t be kept forever. Even if Eraser had managed to keep it all quiet from Tsukauchi, there was always Song to share his own story.\n\nBut none of that concerned Cheshire, so he just said, \"Safer than before.\"\n\nCheshire tilted his head slightly so he elaborated, \"A lot of people want him dead.\" Cheshire nodded, \"Most people believe he was the one to get info out to the heroes. He wanted me to thank you too.”\n\nCheshire shifted, “Did you get the villains?”\n\n“Criminals.” He corrected on instinct.\n\n“What?”\n\n“They were criminals, not villains.”\n\n“So? What’s the difference?”\n\nHe blinked, unable to do anything but stare for a moment. Every time he thought he had a grasp on Cheshire being young and exactly what that meant, he’d learn something new that somehow cemented it further.\n\nHe shouldn’t be out here.\n\n“Villains use their quirks, and usually, they need to be repeat offenders to be considered a villain.” He pulled his scarf off his shoulders, setting it aside. “They weren’t villains, they were barely criminals.” He stepped back, leaning against the brick of the wall, trying his best to appear casual and non-threatening. He kept his eyes away from Cheshire, leaving himself completely open.\n\n“I didn’t know there was a difference,” Cheshire whispered.\n\n“A lot of people don’t.” He admitted.\n\nCheshire should though, someone should’ve taught him.\n\nSomeone should’ve taught him all of it.\n\nThere was a silence then, but this time, he didn’t try to fill it himself. Cheshire had complete control of this situation, he needed to know that.\n\n“Shouldn’t you be trying to find more criminals then?”\n\nHe did look at him then, “Some things are more important.”\n\n“Than stopping crime?”\n\nHe nodded.\n\n“I saw a hero got sent to the hospital.” His body reacted to those words, a blow to his goal to relax. “Well, actually, a few heroes did.”\n\nHe took a breath, “They all lived.”\n\nThey did.\n\nNo one died.\n\nCheshire nodded, “I wish I could’ve been there.”\n\n“No.” He said a little too quickly, holding back a grimace, “You’re just-” He stopped himself before he said something worse, forcing himself to actually think before speaking this time. “That would’ve complicated things.”\n\nCheshire snorted, “You mean someone would’ve had me arrested.”\n\n“Maybe,” He said, glancing up to stare at the stars.\n\nHe was so young. There was no reason he should’ve been there.\n\nHe doesn’t understand that though. Kids are always rushing to grow up.\n\n“If it weren’t so complicated, I would’ve appreciated having you there.”\n\nIf he was older if he was a hero instead of a vigilante.\n\nHe would’ve done some good.\n\n“What?”\n\n“You’re-” He breathed, taking a breath and letting go of some of the tension, “You’re good at this. You’re clearly doing something right, if I haven’t been able to catch you.”\n\n“You haven’t tried.”\n\n“Yes I have.” He insisted, “I know I was once, even if I don’t remember it.”\n\n“Why are you here?” Cheshire asked again. “What do you want?”\n\n“What do you want?” He asked instead, trying desperately to frame it as nothing but a casual curiosity.\n\n“What?”\n\n“You’re still here.”\n\n“You cornered me.”\n\n“You can leave.”\n\n“Can I?”\n\n“Of course.”\n\n“You’re just going to let me leave?”\n\nHe looked at Cheshire again, staring him in the eyes. “I’m not stopping you.”\n\nFor a moment, Cheshire did and said nothing, and then, he took a careful step forward. Cheshire huffed when Eraser didn’t move, voice rising when he said, “Why aren’t you arresting me? You should be trying to arrest me. I helped you once, one time, and all I really did was drop my problems onto you.\"\n\nIs that what he really thought?\n\nHe sparked one of the biggest raids in recent times. He saved lives and risked his own by getting that information to him.\n\nHe took a breath, forcing his thoughts to sort themselves.\n\nHe doubted Cheshire would care for the praise of a hero, so instead he shrugged, like it was a casual thing, \"I don't think you deserve it.\"\n\nCheshire stepped back, \"You don't know anything about me.\"\n\nHow right and wrong he is.\n\n\"I know enough.\"\n\n\"Clearly you don't.\"\n\nWould it help? If he admitted what he did know? If he laid it all out? He knew Cheshire was a hero killer, he knew he was a vigilante, but he also knew he saved a hero’s life, and he knew just how grey everything can start appearing if you're desperate enough.\n\nAnd yet, terrifyingly, part of him worried Cheshire was the one in the right here. Eraser knew things, but he didn’t know everything. It could be worse. He knew just how much worse it could be.\n\nAnd yet, he found himself saying, \"Maybe not. Are you gonna let me find out?\"\n\n\"No.\" He answered immediately.\n\nEraser nodded to himself, \"Then we're fine.\"\n\nCheshire huffed, \"We're fine?\"\n\nHe nodded, “I don’t see any reason to arrest you, and you aren’t going to give me any.”\n\n“And what if I do?”\n\nHe thought about it, turning to stare out at the street. “I guess we’ll find out.”\n\n“I guess we will.” He agreed, “You won’t follow me?”\n\nHe shook his head, checking his phone. His alert had been answered, which meant they’d probably start asking where he was.\n\n“I should be getting back to work anyway.”\n\n“Chasing vigilantes is part of your work.”\n\n“Not today.” He responded, glancing up at him, “Not unless you know of any other vigilantes around here.”\n\nCheshire shook his head, and he pushed himself off the wall, grabbing his scarf and putting it back where it belonged. He threw it up to the roof of the building and pulled himself up with practiced ease.\n\nHe sent one last glance down at Cheshire to find him staring up at him.\n\nA hero killer.\n\nHe was walking away, letting a hero killer go free.\n\nEven so, him having killed a hero had nothing to do with his hesitation.\n\nHe could grab him right now. He could grab him and drag him away. He was right there.\n\nFrom this angle, with his head tilted up and his eyes wide, he looked so small, so young.\n\nHe could do something.\n\n“Goodbye, Cheshire.”\n\nIt would just make him hate him. He’d never go with a hero, not willingly, not now. The moment he tried, Cheshire would probably slip through his fingers and he’d lose his chance at helping this kid.\n\nEven knowing all that, walking away was still hard.\n\n~ ~ ~\n\nShouta let out a long sigh, grimacing at the memory.\n\nIf he could go back, knowing everything he knew now, he’s not sure he’d do much better.\n\nHe said everything wrong, but he’s not sure what the right answers would be.\n\nHe tried. He tried so hard to understand, to make it all right.\n\nCheshire was just- he was just-\n\nHe’s so stubborn and snarky, so slow to trust but so quick to help. And Shouta did learn, did start to understand. Cheshire never said what he meant, not unless it was exploding out of him, and he had this thing- this desperate need for control.\n\nIf he went back, he’d just try dragging him away, and Cheshire would never allow that.\n\nHe ran his hand down his face, tilting his head back against the wall.\n\nAnd he had that sweater.\n\nHe pushed himself off the wall, moving suddenly. He shoved everything to the back of his mind. What happened then didn’t matter, not now. He could pretend he’d never even seen the sweater, he could pretend.\n\nHe slid his goggles back into place because they had been helping him earlier, and he needed to focus . He continued down the stairs, his jaw tightening with each step.\n\nHe just needed to wrap things up here before he started remembering things he couldn’t shake off so easily."
