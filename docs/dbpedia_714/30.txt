Detailed summary

Memorable quotes

Daffy: Those crazy ducks! Knocking themselves out flying south for the winter. Why, they just don't use their brains. An intelligent duck don't fly thousands of miles to get warm. Now take me for instance: I've got a scheme that will get me a home for the winter.

Mad scientist: Why did you hit me in the head, Leopold? Don't you know that made me very angry now, and I will do terrible, horrible things to you!

Daffy: What a house, what a house. All it needs is hands coming out of the wall... like those over my head.

Mad scientist: Give me your wishbone!

Daffy: Oh, you mad, impetuous boy, you!
