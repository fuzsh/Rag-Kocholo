        "text": "Stump-In-Situ\n\nLive 1-4pm, Opening Reception Sunday, June 23rd, 3-5pm\n\nArtists:\n\nLogan Bishop\n\nEnrique Figuerado\n\nNathan Lewis\n\nJesse Peck\n\nMaria Porada\n\nOn June 23rd, 5 artists will activate 5 stumps on Trumbull Street (sycamores that had to be cut due to disease) via a public printmaking event. Some of the prints created from this event, along with other works by the artists will be on display in the flat file. This is a merging of performance, printmaking and public art to activate an awareness of ecological issues happening here and now. Curated by John O'Donnell.\n\nActivating the urban landscape by envisioning the potential of the stumps that remain from the felled local trees, ECOCA is inviting five artists to reclaim the remains of felled trees on Trumbull Street in New Haven. Building on a long history of woodcut printmaking, these selected artists will use their skills as established printmakers to create art by carving into the existing stump to make an image. The image is carved into the wood and can be printed like a huge stamp. The process is eco-friendly and a great way to activate overlooked aspects of the relationship between trees and urban settings. Traditionally, printmakers produce art in a print studio, which is a relatively private activity. This project Is a way to help artists and audiences reconsider traditional approaches to printmaking, public art, and ecological issues affecting our community.\n\nEach artist will carve an image that can be printed by hand, using eco-friendly ink or a wax rubbing crayon. The process will involve the artists working on the stump with traditional wood carving hand tools or more contemporary dremel tools. The artist will informally demonstrate their process and help community members understand printmaking reimagined in a new context. The fun part will be people attending the opening will see the artists printing from the stumps. In many ways, this is a merging of performance, printmaking, and public art to activate an awareness of ecological issues happening here and now. We invite you, the community members, to participate in this collaborative and interactive artistic process.\n\nStump 1 Nathan Lewis\n\nStump 2 Logan Bishop\n\nStump 3 Maria Porada\n\nStump 4 Jesse Peck\n\nStump 5 Enrique Figuerado\n\nView Event →\n\nRamón Bonilla: Miradero\n\nOpening Reception Sunday, June 23rd, 3-5pm\n\nMiradero is a Spanish word that translates to watchtower or lookout point.\n\nIn Bonilla’s artwork the concept of degrowth is used to propose a downshifting from a boundless economic expansion and unsustainable consumption to a post-consumerist future addressing current environmental and social issues. Resource depletion decelerates to achieve ecological flourishing, social equity and quality of life. Furthermore, Bonilla’s personal notions about the metaphysical encompassing beliefs about God, existence, the Cosmos, a non-material realm transcending our observable physical domain and the afterlife provide an additional dimension to the discourse of degrowth and sustainability in his work. These seemingly disparate ideas intersect in profound ways. Alternative futures of human progress prompt reflection of humanity's longing for harmony, purpose, and interconnectedness. Prosperity beyond material accumulation conveyed through principles of simplicity, frugality and conviviality. By pointing to the concept of the afterlife his work considers the transcendence of our actions, a purposeful life, our relation to the Cosmos and our legacy after exiting this world. His work comtemplates ways of thinking about responsible stewardship of the environment, the importance of ethical conduct and towards materialistic world views. It is a call to transcend notions of progress based solely on material wealth and shift towards an existence fulfilled by cultivating a profound sense of fellowship, gratitude, and respect for life. Using his imagination and resilience in the face of systemic barriers and harsh realities, Bonilla finds solace in an enduring hope for a brighter tomorrow, whether in this life or beyond. Through his artwork Bonilla aims to spark conversations about possible futures.\n\nBRIAN SLATTERY: NEW HAVEN INDEPENDENT\n\nArtists Embrace Change, Trasformation | July 23, 2024\n\nRamón Bonilla has a BFA from Escuela de Artes Plásticas de San Juan, Puerto Rico. He has been featured on 5280’s Home magazine as one of the “The Five Local Artists To Watch And Collect”. His work has been commissioned for The Gates Building; Nexus BSP in Denver; Stanley Marketplace in Aurora, CO; The Bonfils-Stanton Foundation in Denver and through Muros, Chicago. His work is also part of the art collections of Le Meridien Hotel Denver and The Four Seasons Hotel and Resort Beverly Hills. He has been represented by Michael Warren Contemporary and Simon Breitbard Fine Arts in San Francisco. Currently he has representation through Space Gallery Denver. He has shown with Direction/Instruction, an international art group organized by Hyland Mather, and showed his work at Paradigm Gallery in Philadelphia. He has also shown his work at Understudy Denver and 516 Arts in Albuquerque, NM. Bonilla is an alumni of Redline Denver where he completed a two year residence and is a recipient of the Inside Fund which is funded by the Andy Warhol Foundation.\n\nView Event →\n\nLínda Perla-Giron: Corn-munion\n\nOpening Reception Sunday, June 23rd, 3-5pm\n\nLínda Perla-Giron’s installation Corn-munion is a work of three parts.\n\nAt 4pm on Sunday, June 23, \"Corn-munion” is a 30 min performance that invites audience members to enter a corny corn-struction of your not so typical typical communion. It’s giving drag. It’s giving Our Father Who Art Corn. It’s giving theater of a mythical self. It’s giving memories that all seem to slip into themselves and become a new history to be passed down instead of digging up what seemed to never be yours to begin with. It's giving a moment to settle into corn-munity care and breathe together — only happens on Sundays.\n\nA booklet — handmade with paper made of grass, wood block print, and typewriter ink.\n\nAn installation archiving the making of “corn-munion” includes journal entries, recipes, drawings, documentation of pre-performance prep and performance stills.\n\nBRIAN SLATTERY: NEW HAVEN INDEPENDENT\n\nArtists Embrace Change, Trasformation | July 23, 2024\n\nLínda Perla-Giron\n\nView Event →\n\nEsthea Kim: Reminiscent Reflection\n\nOpening Reception Sunday, June 23rd, 3-5pm\n\nReminiscent Reflection is born in a small attic space. Dark and old, the room is shaped like a capital A underneath the bar in the middle, yet a window facing the street lets in plenty of light. Materials in hand, scraped and collected for intended use of another sculpture, remnants from a recent (de)installation, a noticeable color discrepancy on the wooden floor, and a sanctuary of angled ceiling covered in tearing-down wallpaper seem to be scarce of things to begin with. The air in the room must have been filthy with collected dust and things over time, but the light itself isn’t. A beam of light brings in all the contrasting freshness, springiness, and liveliness from the outside, penetrating right through the hard glass surface.\n\nSome things let light go through, some reflect, some smear and absorb, and some may be a combination of those. Reminiscent Reflection may be a combination of all. Perhaps the clear paint drops hold the light a bit longer, as if taking time to dry into tiny round dots.\n\nObserving the passing time and changing light through Reminiscent Reflection during the daylight sparks condensed memories of certain days, events, or emotions, all in a smoothly progressive yet swift motion. A change of a material state- from solid to liquid, cold to warm, young to old- can be documented simply as before and after, but the process in between is rather ambiguous for a clean definition, thus often referred to as a state of chaos or a journey to the unknown.\n\nThe change in state causes us to look forward to the future while also reflecting on the past. Reminiscing how things were is a process of having the solid history melt into nostalgic memory particles. Often with a contrasting present reality and a bit of regret, a song of wishes and hopes commemorating past beauty our nostalgia plays.\n\nBRIAN SLATTERY: NEW HAVEN INDEPENDENT\n\nArtists Embrace Change, Trasformation | July 23, 2024\n\nEsthea Kim is an interdisciplinary artist integrating sculpture, installation and painting. Her works represent a captured notion from memories and express the sensed and theorized through fading and poetic imagery in a visually succinct way. Transposed from her perception, her painting transfers atmospheric vastness into repeated gestural brushstrokes and built up textures. While fleetingly capturing light in-between layers, these brushstrokes combine with hard-edged elements, condensing infinite views and the unseen into a single flattened composition. Esthea’s sculptural objects and installations are industrial yet organic. Focusing on the inherent qualities of materials, she expands the use of prefabricated and utilitarian items into more organic forms.\n\nView Event →\n\nAdrian Panaitisor: SDED\n\nOpening Reception Sunday, June 23rd, 3-5pm\n\n“The new millennium invites the artist to keep up with its complex understanding of reality. The bridge between painting and sculpture (a philosophical dimension) can be achieved visually with the use of several flat surfaces, canvas strips, optical illusion, and real objects.” -Panaitisor\n\nPanaitisor refers to his work as SDED, neither two-dimensional nor three-dimensional. His work created during the Keyhole Workspace Residency addresses points of scientific breakthroughs and discoveries while literally breaking through a painting’s surface. His reverence to optical illusions beckons the viewer for double and triple inspections for dissection; much as we need to see the world around us, though a critical lens.\n\nBRIAN SLATTERY: NEW HAVEN INDEPENDENT\n\nArtists Embrace Change, Trasformation | July 23, 2024\n\nView Event →\n\nEmily Weiskopf\n\nOpening Reception Sunday, June 23rd, 3-5pm\n\n\"One brought fire🔥, One brought frost ❄\".\n\nThis series of works, primarily made up of Palm stems and fronds were excavated from forest fires, ice storms and deforestation around the country. Some of these incidents occurred just feet from my own home.\n\nThe works in this exhibition aim to bring contemplation and new narratives between us and the earth. I believe that the notion of care cannot be separated from the notion of harmony with Nature. I consider architecture, formal elements, traditions of ancient and Indigenous art, and utilizing familiar historical craft techniques as a visual language in which to further explore critical environmental and social quandaries of our time. I aim to build consciousness and healing while emphasizing social impact alongside environmental concerns that reimagine the politics and ethics of care while drawing out a balance between artistic intervention and the raw material.\n\nBRIAN SLATTERY: NEW HAVEN INDEPENDENT\n\nArtists Embrace Change, Trasformation | July 23, 2024\n\nEmily Weiskopf (b. Syracuse, New York) creates a multifaceted body of work that shifts across mediums that include sculpture, ceramics, drawing, and photography. She received a BFA from the Hartford Art School(CT) and an MFA from the Tyler School of Art(PA) /Rome, Italy. Weiskopf’s work has been featured in Artnet, Gallerist NY, DNAinfo, the Contemporist, the Brooklyn Rail and exhibited with M.David&Co(NY); David Hall Fine Art (MA); Shin Gallery(NY); Tiger Strikes Astroid; among others including Deanne Evans Projects Flatfile (2022). In 2013, the NYC D.O.T commissioned Weiskopf’s first large scale public installation, Unparallel Way. Weiskopf was nominated for the Rome Prize in 2011, awarded the Robert Rauschenberg Award 2021, Walter Hodes Memorial Award, and numerous fellowships and residencies including the Artist Pension Trust(2013), Vermont Studio Center (2011/2021), the Wassiac Project (2012) the Atlantic Center for the Arts (2023), ECOCA Keyhole Workspace (2024), Jentel (WY) 2024. She was among the 2021 ReClaim Award winners in Cologne, Germany, selected for Chico Photography Review (2022) and is currently developing a permanent public artwork with the City of Austin, Texas due to debut in 2024.\n\nShe has held Lecturing positions at Fashion Institute of Technology (NY), Monseratt College of Art(MA) and Texas State University(TX). In 2014 she was in an 18-wheeler car accident that left her with life-altering injuries and permanent mobility and cognitive constrictions that paused her practice until the end of 2019, shifting the direction of her work exponentially. Weiskopf currently lives and works in the Northeast.\n\nView Event →\n\nLawrence Morelli: Remembrance\n\nOpening Reception Sunday, June 23rd, 3-5pm\n\nWhen Morelli decided to downsize his space, he became creative in where and how to work. No longer using models for large scale paintings, Morelli has been sitting at G Café in New Haven, painting outside in small notebooks. He has been working from intense memories of places throughout his life, spanning from California, Michigan, New York and Connecticut. Each work has the date of its creation as well as the location and date of the memory.\n\nBRIAN SLATTERY: NEW HAVEN INDEPENDENT\n\nArtists Embrace Change, Trasformation | July 23, 2024\n\nView Event →\n\nCan Yağız: Not today either\n\nOpening Reception Sunday, June 23rd, 3-5pm\n\n“Similar to the first cold day of the year, when you grab a coat you haven't worn in a while and put your hands in the pockets, and find a piece of a receipt, a used tissue, a caramel wrapper, and a band-aid, also used. And not recognize who these fragments belong to.\n\nI thought self as something innate, an enduring thread for the most part. Though it is more fragile, self can fragment, dissipate. It is difficult when memory becomes contested or one cannot reason with their doing.\n\nAt loose ends, such fragments became tangible comforts. Material had memory, in how a tissue soaked and how an envelope scuffed. It rendered progression.\n\nI have been working these materials into collages. The degradation of these elements is integral to how I contemplate themes of belonging, selfhood, and decay. In addition, I approach this degradation through printing monotypes in succession without cleaning the plate, so the image degrades with each subsequent print.” - Can Yağız\n\nCan Yağız was born in İstanbul, Türkiye, and currently lives and works in New Haven. Can received his Bachelor of Fine Arts from Maryland Institute College of Art, and Master of Fine Arts from Yale School of Art.\n\nBRIAN SLATTERY: NEW HAVEN INDEPENDENT\n\nArtists Embrace Change, Trasformation | July 23, 2024\n\nView Event →\n\nHoracio Marquínez: America Unfiltered\n\nOpening Reception Sunday, June 23rd, 3-5pm, following a screening of the film “America Unfiltered” 12:30 pm at the Yale Art Gallery\n\nAt the height of the pandemic, two immigrant filmmakers – one from Panama, the other from Russia – journeyed across the United States uncovering an unfiltered, unflinching portrait of America. What if we could better relate to one another and heal our nation’s divides by seeing that we share so much beneath the surface? What if we found the courage to ask questions and just listen, overpowering our natural instinct to react?\n\nSeeking to build empathy amidst a fractured country and uncertain future, America Unfiltered sets out on a cross country journey to photograph people and record their stories about what it means to live in America today.

They reflect a response to loss and illness, but have come to represent a recovery. I found the way in was in nature, an allegory of our place in the world, and the forces we face. After dozens of them, they began to become sculpture in a figurative sense, and after this episode of working solely on paper, I was able to begin to again to make literal sculpture. These are the bridge between events, and their translation into the structure of the world we live in- in all its seen and unseen dimensions.\n\nIt all starts with drawing.” - Seth Callander\n\nFor more information please visit Callander’s website.\n\nView Event →\n\nLionel Cruet: Sunburnt\n\nOpening Reception Sunday April 14, 2024, 1-3 pm\n\nSunburnt features Cruet’s video performance 'Sun Simulacrums.’ The title alludes to the history of human civilizations and the use of the sun as a symbol of god, energy, power, and clarity. Ultimately, the performance challenges viewers to reflect on our role in the climate crisis and the delicate natural world on planet Earth. Other works featured include ‘As far as the eyes can see’ print series, ‘Exercises to understand how to be together (Hand open)’, a series of carbon prints, and ‘Without Horizons’, a large scale painting on polyethylene canvas. This industrial material is used in high risk areas and the orange color is indicative of caution and/or danger. Cruet uses these multiple media, which include experimental digital printing processes, performance, and audiovisual installations, to confront issues concerning ecology, geopolitics, and technology.\n\nLionel Cruet was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and lives and works in both New York City and San Juan. He received a Bachelor in Fine Arts from La Escuela de Artes Plásticas y Diseño en Puerto Rico, a Master in Fine Arts - DIAP (Digital Interdisciplinary Art Practice) and from CUNY - The City College of New York, and a Master in Education from the College of Saint Rose.\n\nFor more information please visit Cruet’s website.\n\nPeriódico El Adoquín\n\n“Sunburnt” de Lionel Cruet en el Ely Center of Contemporary Art en New Haven, Connecticut, May 9, 2024\n\nBRIAN SLATTERY: NEW HAVEN INDEPENDENT\n\nArtists Stare Into The Sun, 5/16/24\n\nView Event →\n\nHanlyn Davies: This Bad Apple\n\nOpening Reception Sunday April 14, 2024, 1-3 pm\n\nHanlyn Davies is a Welsh-American painter and printmaker whose work has been widely exhibited and is included in public and private collections both in the United States and abroad. His current exhibition, This Bad Apple at the ECoCA, stems from his interest in growing apples in his New Haven backyard. It was observing the natural decay of these apples, while musing about the representation of ‘the apple’ in art, mythology, and folklore, that led to the work in this exhibition. This Bad Apple, 2019-2023, is a cautionary, allegorical tale for our current times. It is visualized in three works of archival pigment prints: one work is comprised of a set of thirteen prints; the other two works are individual prints. Each work uses an apple on its entropic journey to tell the tale.\n\nFor more information on Davies’ biography and portfolio, please visit his website.\n\nBRIAN SLATTERY: NEW HAVEN INDEPENDENT\n\nArtists Stare Into The Sun, 5/16/24\n\nView Event →\n\nSariah Park: Embedded Memory\n\nApril 14 - June 2, 2024\n\nOpening Reception Sunday April 14, 2024, 1-3 pm\n\nThe exhibition, Embedded Memory, addresses issues of identity, culture, and the act of making in relation to the Land. Sariah’s work asks important questions about how intrinsic identity informs what and how we make, and speaks to the devastating effects of overconsumption on the environment. This exhibition features work that repurposes textiles and damaged materials into new forms through her printing with waste series. Sariah’s work shows the transformation of material made immaterial, craft as a form of ceremony, and the transfer of energy and spirit into a living process, striving to become in balance with the natural world.\n\nSariah Park is an interdisciplinary artist of European and Indigenous descent, and an enrolled member of the Chiricahua Apache Nation. Sariah’s work has been featured in Hyperallergic, the Wall Street Journal, Women’s Wear Daily, Vogue, Elle, and Harper’s Bazaar. She is a recent recipient of a Pollock-Krasner Fellowship in 2019, as well as artist grants from Creative Capital, Foundation for the Arts, and the CERF+. Her work is included in portfolios, traveling exhibitions, and private collections including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. She is currently Assistant Professor of Fashion Design and Social Justice at Parsons School of Design where she has been teaching art and design for the last thirteen years.\n\nFor more information please visit Park’s website.\n\nBRIAN SLATTERY: NEW HAVEN INDEPENDENT\n\nArtists Stare Into The Sun, 5/16/24\n\nView Event →\n\nKevin Hernandez Rosa: Based Kevin\n\nOpening Reception Sunday April 14, 2024, 1-3 pm\n\nDuring the summer of 2022, while undergoing treatment as an inpatient at the Institute of Living, Hernandez Rosa read \"What You Practice is What You Have\" by Zen awareness practitioner Cheri Huber. The book’s primary “practice tool” is a recording of “reassurances”, defined as “True statements, made by one’s center… meant to solidify the relationship between the human being (oneself) and the wise, compassionate awareness (the centered self)”. The book goes on to assign “In your own voice, make a recording that reminds you of everything you need to remember so that you can make the choices you know you need to make, from center, to have the life you know is possible for you.”\n\n“Although I found solace in the teachings of Huber's book during my recovery, I hesitated to create my own reassurance recording. I grappled with the notion that the ego-self and conditioned mind, as discussed in the book, might render statements centered around \"I\" or self-improvement debased. This artwork serves as my attempt at composing reassurances, albeit straying from the book's original purpose as a practice tool for a self and instead opting to share words apt for love in its pure form, and boundless freedom.” -Kevin Hernandez Rosa\n\nFor more information please visit Rosa’s website.\n\nBRIAN SLATTERY: NEW HAVEN INDEPENDENT\n\nArtists Stare Into The Sun, 5/16/24\n\nView Event →\n\nYvonne Shortt & Rebecca West: Shedding My Toxic Core Part III\n\nOpening Reception Sunday April 14, 2024, 1-3 pm\n\nShedding My Toxic Core Part III is the continuation of work by the mother/daughter duo Yvonne Shortt and Rebecca West. The concepts of scarcity and abundance have become more and more prevalent in how Shortt addresses her artistic practice. Scarcity is found across industries such as art, education, for-profit and not-for-profit organizations; essentially in society at large. Examples of what Shortt defines as scarcity are: competition, gatekeeping, hierarchies, and exclusivities. The concepts of abundance, Shortt finds, are found in “intentionality and freedom as well as sustainability from a financial, emotional, and environmental perspective.”\n\nThe act of making art is almost always tied to a material. One must take a material from its natural state to create, often with environmentally harmful means of manipulation. Shortt and West have been approaching sustainability from a materials perspective in their practice. They collaborate with beavers, using their discarded sticks to create pieces for play, conversation, and energy shifts. Shortt and West will continue to investigate these concepts as they invite others to work with them in the gallery space for the duration of their exhibition, using abundance to source their art making techniques, such as creating paint from soil.\n\nFor more information please visit Shortt’s website.\n\nBRIAN SLATTERY: NEW HAVEN INDEPENDENT\n\nArtists Stare Into The Sun, 5/16/24\n\nView Event →\n\nWater Women: Flood 2.0\n\nOpening Reception Sunday April 14, 2024, 1-3 pm\n\nKrisanne Baker, Susan Hoffman Fishmen and Leslie Sobel, the three artists who make up the Water Women are established artists whose individual practices focus on water in the context of climate change.\n\nFlood 2.0 links future apocalyptic flood predictions to the ancient flood narrative of Noah and the world’s first apocalyptic flood. In the original Noah story, the Earth was flooded as a result of human greed, selfishness and immorality. Similarly, the predicted future apocalyptic flooding will occur as a result of the same human behaviors, which, this time, have caused significant environmental damage to the Earth itself.\n\nThe installation is comprised of 3 video projections, 45+ scrolls painted to imitate the motions of flood waters, a make-shift boat, sails and mast, and the performance of a Greek Chorus, which tells the story of Noa, the lone female survivor whose name in Hebrew means “action.” Flood 2.0’s goal is to use art, flood mythology and history to inspire community dialogue on local water issues. Water Women selected New Haven, CT as the site of the project’s second iteration because of its close proximity to both the Long Island Sound and the Connecticut River. The project’s videos incorporate documentary images of New Haven’s waterways and past floods. Flood 2.0 was first installed in 2023 at Five Points Gallery in Torrington, CT, a small inland community with a history of catastrophic flooding.\n\nFor more information please visit the websites of Krisanne Baker, Susan Hoffman Fishmen and Leslie Sobel\n\nReviews:\n\nKAPP SINGER: ARTS PAPER\n\nWater is in the Air May 10, 2024\n\nBRIAN SLATTERY: NEW HAVEN INDEPENDENT\n\nArtists Stare Into The Sun, 5/16/24\n\nView Event →\n\nThink About Water: Exquisite River\n\nOpening Reception Sunday April 14, 2024, 1-3 pm\n\nExquisite River is a collaborative installation created by members of the Think About Water collective (TAW). TAW includes over 30 environmental artists/activists in the US and abroad whose work addresses global water issues. Exquisite River is composed of 19 works of art evoking rivers. The images are connected to one another to form one continuous flowing river—a river of images of rivers.\n\nFor the exhibition at ECOCA, the 19 artists were inspired by the format of the Surrealist Exquisite Corpse game, in which one artist drew a head, folded the paper so it could not be seen, passed it to another artist who drew the next part of the body, and so on until the paper was unfolded to reveal the whole figure. In the spirit of artistic play and mimicking the fluid nature of rivers, the TAW collective has created an Exquisite River.\n\nFor the exhibition, each artist created a section of a river in his or her own studio using their distinctive materials, processes and intentions and without seeing other artists’ contributions. The sections were then assembled into one long river that winds across the gallery walls. The goal of the exhibition is to bring awareness to the importance of rivers to the health of the environment and to encourage visitors to appreciate a river in their own lives.\n\nPersonal stories about each of the rivers represented in the exhibition, along with information about the artwork, bios of the artists, and links to their websites are available in a digital catalog accompanying the show.\n\nContributing Artists: Michelle Boyle, Diane Burko, Betsy Damon, Leila Daw, Rosalyn Driscoll, Susan Hoffman Fishman, Doug Fogelson, Fredericka Foster, Giana Gonzalez, Fritz Horstman, Basia Irland, Sant Khalsa, Stacy Levy, Jaanika Peerna, Ilana Manolson, Aviva Rahmani, Lisa Reindorf, Meridel Rubinstein, Leslie Sobel, Naoe Suzuki\n\nFor more information please visit the TAW website.\n\nDONNA DOHERTY: CT INSIDER\n\nArtists Think About Water in New Haven art show.

Scattered around the world, Nua Collective is a group of professional visual artists that collaborate together to create, share and support one another in their journey as artists. BLACKOUT marks our first physical exhibition.\n\nFeaturing 13 artists, this exhibition presents a unique series of lino prints that, in their creation and processing, have traveled the globe. Together, it makes an inquiry about our climate catastrophe and the energy crisis that we face once again.\n\nThe climate-related events of last summer have brought a stark realization to Nua Collective, as artists and viewers, forcing them to confront the harsh realities of humankind's impact on the planet. This series of work serves as a poignant reminder of the blackout they experience regarding the urgent need to address the problems that contribute to a steadily warming planet and the dire consequences that result. Starting with discussions and sharing, like all concepts explored by Nua Collective, they digitally came together to understand and consider the theories and ideas that formed BLACKOUT.\n\nIndependently, each artist created their works using various materials, such as painting, photography, pastel and other mixed media. Digitally rendered, the final pieces were sent to Scotland, where Nua Artist Robert Jackson laser cut negatives of these artworks and using a 19th- century, traditional Colombian printing press, created unique editions that form the BLACKOUT exhibition.\n\nContributing Artists: Christina Geoghegan, Carol Healy, Caoimhe Heaney, Luke Hickey, Robert Jackson, Maria Markham, Paul McMahon, John Murray, Saoirse O’Sullivan, Katrina Tracuma, Eamonn B.

He lives and works in Connecticut since moving here in 1970, though his Caribbean roots serve as a visual footing for his work as he draws on memories full of saturated colors and patterns that make up his paintings. “A visual kaleidoscope from this exotic land, is referenced in my art. Coming from a tropical country, where everything is referenced by color, my art radiates a colorful energy that is both visually and spiritually stimulating. I find resiliency in being able to create artforms that reflect my rich and diverse culture.” His thick application of paint invites the viewer to physically enter Cromwell’s own world where the people of the Caribbean shine, radiating strength. His work combines both imaginary and spiritual concepts through myths and folklores, combining abstraction with representational. Cromwell’s work embodies his experiences as a human being and a Guyanese-born artist.\n\nPress:\n\nCLAUDIA FIKS: ARTSCOPE\n\nGuyana-Born, New England Strong: Forrester & Cromwell Elevate New Haven's Ely Center | March 1, 2024\n\nBRIAN SLATTERY: NEW HAVEN INDEPENDENT\n\nArtists Let In the Light | Feb 13, 2024\n\nView Event →\n\nMarlon Forrester: Skyward Bound\n\nOpening Reception Sunday February 4, 2024, 1-3 pm (storm date February 11, 1-3 pm)\n\nMarlon Forrester, born in Guyana, South America, is an artist and educator raised in Boston, MA.

Hogfeldt (1925-2014) a Word War II veteran and 1951 graduate of the Yale School of Art. The exhibition presents original artwork which has not been seen publicly since the period by six artists who constituted the Gallery's core active group in the early years of 1956-64: the aforementioned Hogfeldt, William Kent (1919-2012), Leo V. Jensen (1926-2019), David T.S. Jones (1926-1996), William Skardon (1923-1983) and Robert Alan DeVoe (1928-1992).\n\nThrough paintings, works on paper, three-dimensional works, and artist books - as well as printed ephemera, period newspaper articles, photography, and accompanying essay - this exhibition is the first to explore this group of artists and their interest in formal innovation, collaboration, and exchange of ideas. Accompanying the exhibition will be a satellite gallery presenting 1960s paintings by a contemporary of the group, artist Ruth S. Tyler (1922-2006) including works last seen publicly at the Ely Center in 1963.\n\nAvant Colony is being organized in conjunction with related shows at several museums across Connecticut devoted to the work of individual Westbrook Gallery artists.\n\nLeo Jensen exhibition at the Florence Griswold Museum details HERE\n\nLeo Jensen exhibition at the Lyman Allyn Art Museum details HERE\n\nDalia Ramanauskus exhibition at the Mattatuck Museum details HERE\n\nWilliam Kent retrospective scheduled to open at the New Haven Museum in spring 2024.\n\nPress:\n\nKATIE PELLICO & CATHERING SHEN: CONNECTICUT PUBLIC RADIO\n\n'Avant Colony': Celebrating the history of avant-garde art-making in Connecticut | March 18, 2024\n\nBRIAN SLATTERY: NEW HAVEN INDEPENDENT\n\nEly Center Opens Window to Art Scene's Past | Feb 22, 2024\n\nView Event →\n\nDesmond Beach: Threads of Memory\n\nThreads of Memory, Beach’s latest installation, consists of large quilt tapestries and a site specific altar.

My ancestors and those of the African Diaspora are honored in my work, and through performance and installation art, I build sacred spaces for their souls to rest. My ultimate goal as an artist is to transform the horrific into the beautiful, to take the pain and trauma of the Black experience and turn it into something that inspires and uplifts. Recent and historical events related to the African-American experience and anti-Blackness inspire my work, driving me to explore these themes in new and thought-provoking ways.”\n\nPATRICIA GRANDJEAN: DAILY NUTMEG\n\nEverything and More | Nov 28, 2023\n\nBRIAN SLATTERY: NEW HAVEN INDEPENDENT\n\nThree Artists Follow the Moves | Dec 5, 2023\n\nView Event →\n\nAndree Brown: Leaves of Durham\n\nThe Ely Center of Contemporary Art is pleased to present Andree Brown: Leaves of Durham.

In her latest series of work, Leaves of Durham, Brown is playful with form and scale, taking liberties with both. Brown’s inspiration came from leaves she foraged in the woods of Durham, CT and has defined their character and given them voice. “There is a direct connection between trees and humans. Without trees humans could not survive and without humans, trees could not live.” Brown uses her sculptures as a means to connect with the natural world and learn how trees communicate with each other and us.\n\nPATRICIA GRANDJEAN: DAILY NUTMEG\n\nEverything and More | Nov 28, 2023\n\nBRIAN SLATTERY: NEW HAVEN INDEPENDENT\n\nThree Artists Follow the Moves | Dec 5, 2023\n\nView Event →\n\nHome: Amartya De, Lesley Finn & Vera Wu\n\nHome is a group show featuring work developed during the pilot of our Keyhole Artists in Residence program.

By doing so, we discover something about ourselves and the world we live in. If nothingness is matter and energy, then it includes everything that exists within that nothingness. Can we see everything and nothing simultaneously? In traditional Chinese and Japanese art, the use of empty space or large areas left blank/unpainted are understood as information and considered a vital part of the artwork and composition.\n\nOur perception of realities are sensations that help us navigate the world, while our surroundings and our world is defined by the space we take up in it. The concept of there being emptiness and fullness in the same space is one that artists have long considered in their work. Abstraction refutes the Western world’s obsession with the visible and concrete. In nothingness a presence can be felt. In everything the material presence is seen. The artists’ work selected for this exhibition reveals an aspect of the autonomous inner essence of creation, as being everything and nothing, defining a way of seeing.\n\nAbout SomethingProjects: It is an artist-run curatorial project founded by longtime friends and co-directors Howard el-Yasin and Suzan Shutan. As collaborators they are focused on empowerment and solidarity, studio productivity and communication among communities. They think holistically about how a project can impact both an artist, and an audience's intersectionality. They believe value is highly subjective and their goal is to push how we understand value outside the margins of dominant culture.\n\nAs a nomadic transitory and provisional space, SomethingProjects is an incubator for ideas, encouraging artists to step outside their boundaries and experiment with the intersection of materials, production, presentation and means of engagement with audience and space. Through collaborative projects,theybring together people of many different backgrounds- economic, geographic, geopolitical, age, BiPoc, queer and non-binary/gender identities. Their audience is all-inclusive and their projects are an opportunity to learn about one's neighbors, different ways of understanding art, acceptance of difference, and things happening within one’s everyday environment.\n\nBrian Slattery: New Haven Independent\n\nArtists Show ​“Everything And Nothing” At Ely Center | Nov 17, 2023\n\nPatricia Grandjean: Daily Nutmeg\n\nEverything and More | Nov 28, 2023\n\nFeatured Artists:\n\nDan Gries\n\nHeather Bird Harris\n\nYoko Iwanaga\n\nMischa Johnson\n\nBrian Kaspr\n\nRebecca Murtaugh\n\nDaniel Pailes-Friedman\n\nAllison Panzironi\n\nSylvia Schwartz\n\nRossie Stearns\n\nZach Zecha\n\nMeg Bloom\n\nSerena Bocchino\n\nRichard Bottwin\n\nSeth Callander\n\nEllen Carey\n\nPatricia Carrigan\n\nCynthia Cooper\n\nHyunsek Erickson\n\nGordon Fearey\n\nMichael Filan\n\nGreg Garvey\n\nAhna Girshick\n\nView fullsize\n\nMeg Bloom\n\nView fullsize\n\nSerena Bocchino\n\nView fullsize\n\nRichard Bottwin\n\nView fullsize\n\nSeth Callander\n\nView fullsize\n\nEllen Carey\n\nView fullsize\n\nPatricia Carrigan\n\nView fullsize\n\nCynthia Cooper\n\nView fullsize\n\nHyunsek Erickson\n\nView fullsize\n\nGordon Fearey\n\nView fullsize\n\nMichael Filan\n\nView fullsize\n\nGreg Garvey\n\nView fullsize\n\nAhna Girshick\n\nView fullsize\n\nDan Gries\n\nView fullsize\n\nHeather Bird Harris\n\nView fullsize\n\nYoko Iwanaga\n\nView fullsize\n\nMischa Johnson\n\nView fullsize\n\nBrian Kaspr\n\nView fullsize\n\nRebecca Murtaugh\n\nView fullsize\n\nDaniel Pailes-Friedman\n\nView fullsize\n\nAllison Panzironi\n\nView fullsize\n\nSylvia Schwartz\n\nView fullsize\n\nRossie Stearns\n\nView fullsize\n\nZach Zecha\n\nView Event →\n\nDaniel Recinos: My First Time Painting\n\nClosing Reception: November 5, 12pm -3pm\n\nFor Advertising Creative Photographer Daniel Recinos, it’s all about portraying honesty and honor through nontraditional methods which spark curiosity.
