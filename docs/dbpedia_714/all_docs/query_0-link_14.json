        "text": "To complete Clampett...\n\nJaveman said:\n\nAm I the only one that thinks that Clampett himself may have written \"Kitty Kornered\", \"Bacall to Arms\" and \"Big Snooze\" without credit? Maybe he thought being the director was enough and it would be too much of a brag to have two credits on one short. Of course, WB chopped off his direction credit in his two last cartoons.\n\n- Javier\n\nJaveman (Javier)~\n\nNooooo you're not the only one who has suspected that Bob Clampett may have actually written those three final entries... It was long my belief that such was the case (and I'm glad you reminded me!). But mercifully twenty plus years ago Bob clarified it when he denoted everything that he had done (or claimed to have done) at Schlesigner/Warners. Annnnnd Clampett did NOT claim authorship of either \"Kitty Kornered\" or \"Bacall To Arms\", BUT he most certainly DID claim to have written \"The Big Snooze\". So with that in mind IF Bob actually finished directing it then there is no reason in the world for it (as has been noted by so many as) being \"choppy\". Annnnnd it's one strong reason to believe someone else (almost certainly Art Davis) finished it/or actually directed much of it. Intriguingly enough on this occasion Clampett did NOT claim to have started directing ANY of the early Davis toons (like \"Mouse Menace\" or \"Goofy Gophers\").\n\nBUT...!!!!\n\n(Unfortunately Clampett at the same time also claimed to have co-written many of Tex Avery's toons AFTER he himself was in own unit!!! Then if that wasn't enough, he also claimed to written/co-written these (and keep in mind I'm a lover of things-Clampett)...\n\nHare Force-1944 (Why would he claim it...? Because such would let him lay claim to creation of Granny)\n\nThe Swooner Crooner-1944 (Why would he claim it...? Cynically, Tashlin was dead and couldn't dispute it)\n\nHare Trigger- 1945 (Why would he claim it...? This let's him claim the creation of Yosemite Sam)\n\nLife With Feathers-1945 (Why would he claim it...? Thus lays claim to creation of Sylvester & to an Oscar nomination)\n\nPeck Up Your Feathers-1945 (Why would he claim it...? Again let's him claim Sylvester)\n\nStrangely he claimed NOTHING in 1946 aside from the authorship of \"The Big Snooze\", but then he claimed these in 1947...\n\nThe Goofy Gophers- (Why......????????????? Let's him claim their creation).\n\nBirth Of A Notion- (Why.....?????? A great Daffy, with Peter Lorre. )\n\nTweetie Pie- (Why......??? Let's him lay claim to Friz's Oscar. Also to the first pairing w/Sylvester)\n\nHobo Bobo (Why......??? ?? Let's him claim creation of that fabulous pachyderm, Bobo.)\n\nCatch As Cats Can (Why......?????) An early Sylvester, since he claimed the other early ones, then this too).\n\nClampett claims\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I'm pro-Clampett all the way, but all this topic had me wanting to pull out my transcripts of the Mike Barrier/Milt Gray Bob Clampett interview in 1970, because I thought there was more that Clampett claims to have done in that article, and I found these testimonies:\n\n-Bob claimed to have animated on the \"first Merrie Melodie ever\" which means it would be \"Lady Play Your Mandolin\" (this is very likely, although he'd have been a teenager)\n\n-Bob claimed to have created the Mickey Mouse doll design for Walt Disney (he'd have really been young to have been able to do this)\n\n-Bob claims the original concept for using for the animated advertisements, which were first seen in \"Smile, Darn Ya Smile\"\n\n-Bob claimed to have originated the idea for using \"W\"s instead of \"R\"s, in the Elmer Fudd speech impediment ... apparently, this was based on making fun of Rudy Ising's hunting trips in 1931.... Bob said he drew up gags about a wily rabbit getting the best of the hunter, showing up behind him, etc, etc, etc which were \"used for the first Bugs Bunny cartoon seven years later\"... (gee, imagine that, to have such an influence over what was to happen so far in the future....)\n\n-Bob claimed to have created Porky Pig and Beans, and to have designed Beans, and the original Porky\n\n-he claimed to have written the script for \"My Green Fedora\", even though Freleng directed it (and Friz would have been perfectly capable by that time, having directed cartoons for a number of years already)\n\n-In the interview he said, \"Tex came up with the idea of Porky going on a duck hunt, wherein the hunter would try to get the ducks but they would always turn the tables on him....we had all these crazy ducks. After we boiled it down, we had two or three times as many gags as we needed. I asked Tex, 'What if instead of all these ducks being crazy, you consolidated them into one comic relief character?' Tex did that, and when he did, he created Daffy Duck, who turned out to be the second hit character we ever had.\"\n\n-Bob claims he had no gag man when Ub Iwerks left at first, so he \"wrote and sketched his first two cartoons 'by self'\" (which would be \"Porky's Badtime Story\" and \"Get Rich Quick, Porky\").\n\n-He claims to have pre-written the entire script and series of gags for \"Porky's Hare Hunt\", designed the character one weekend, and \"handed it to Leon who then assigned it to the Dalton-Hardaway unit to film..... (Huh? Bob already had his own unit directing cartoons. Why didn't Leon let him do his own material?)\n\n-Quote from the interview: \"It was then Leon assigned Bugs to a second hare-hunt story [*note- after Porky's Hare Hunt-] this time in colour. For this film, a model-sheet maker [*note- Robert Givens] was assigned to try and advance the design of the character. My first sketches were simple, but they were very close to what you finally saw in 'A Wild Hare'. But instead of progressing Bugs Bunny in the direction his development was headed, the model-sheet maker [*Givens].. changed him to a dumpy, silly-looking thing which ended up bouncing around the screen a la Daffy.... And this was thought to be the 'birth of Bugs Bunny'....... Tex was assigned the fourth hare-hunt cartoon.... he was a little scared of it, since there was some confusion on how this rabbit should be handled. After the Daffy-like regression in 'Hare-um Scare-um', I decided to stay close to all future storyboard development, and worked with Tex in order to help get Bugs back on the track to what I had envisioned in the first story sketches. \"A Wild Hare\" was the first with the more sophisticated and underplayed rabbit treatment I had always hoped to see.\"\n\nInteresting reading...... Maybe I'll type in some more later, my hands are getting tired of typing..... and there's plenty more to note...\n\nBob-bing for appeal?!? ;o)\n\nMatthew Hunter said:\n\nI know Clampett had been known to brag and claim credit for things that may not have been true...but that list I'd never heard.\n\nSome of those certainly could have had Clampett's input, but perhaps he was kind of exaggerating after the fact. Looking over Friz Freleng's or Arthur Davis' shoulder and giving a suggestion, or pitching in at a storyboarding session might have evolved into \"Oh, I wrote that\". Sort of a fish-story type thing, where the fish gets bigger every time you tell it.\n\nthe Sylvester thing, though, I don't buy at all. Clampett, aside from directing one early cartoon, didn't have a whole lot to do with Sylvester, and as far as I know Friz Freleng created him for Life With Feathers. Life With Feathers does not have much Clampett feel to me.\n\nNot that \"Kitty Kornered\" isn't a great cartoon mind you...and I would be willing to give Clampett some credit for defining that little mischievous streak in Sylvester's personality with that film. But one cartoon toward the very end of his tenure at the studio doesn't give Bob Clampett a whole lot of room to claim creation of the puddy tat.\n\nI've also heard that Clampett claimed creation of two other Freleng inventions...a certain pig and cat. Maybe Clampett had a hand in it, but Freleng was the one who started it all.\n\n-Matthew\n\nMatthew~\n\nI wish to high-heaven that we could just pass off that list as part of the \"Big YES\" storyboard sessions, but unfortunately we can't. I deliberately listed only from 1944-47 for reasons of space and to illustrate how ridiculous and downright pathetic were Bob's claims.\n\nBut Clampett also claimed that while in Tex Avery's original unit to have written or co-written 9 of Tex's 1936 cartoons and 7 of Avery's 1937 films (one of which is of course Daffy's all-important debut in \"Porky's Duck Hunt) plus 2 of Friz's 1937 toons, and another after leaving for Iwerks'. All this while he was animating for Tex and allegedly functioning as his \"assistant director\". These claims are neither readily proveable or disproveable, but it's a fact that Avery used the story dept. and in fact sat in with them (greatly lessening Bob's claims). But then after Bob was moved off into the exile of first Iwerks' studio then the \"Ray Katz Unit\" something weird happened... He goes on claiming authorship of others cartoons, even though he's off directing in a separate studio!!!\n\nThe cartoons he CLAIMED to have authored for others share these recurring marks...They are the debuts/early appearances of future STAR characters, or of characteristically 'Avery-ian' genres of cartoons, or were nominated for AWARDS!!! ...BEAR this in mind, Bob Clampett only CLAIMED to have authored his own FIRST and LAST cartoons...!!!\n\n1937\n\nLittle Red Walking Hood----Avery--------------(Why claim it??? The second Egghead cartoon. He failed to remember the first \"Egghead Rides Again\").\n\nSeptember In The Rain------Freleng-----------(Why claim it??? It's another of the labels-come-to-life toons that he first suggested to Hugh & Rudy)\n\n1938\n\nDaffy Duck And Egghead----Avery-------------(Why claim it??? It's the third Egghead cartoon AND the second Daffy.)\n\nPorky's Hare Hunt-----Hardaway & Dalton (Why claim it??? Because it's the debut of a RABBIT at Schlesinger's).\n\nThe Isle Of Pingo Pongo-----Avery-------------(Why claim it??? Once again, it's an Egghead toon).\n\nHave You Got Any Castles?--Tashlin--------(Why claim it??? As before another of the labels-come-to-life toons that he first suggested to Hugh and Rudy).\n\nA Feud There Was------------Avery--------------(Why claim it??? Easy, it's an Egghead cartoon...)\n\nDaffy Duck In Hollywood----Avery--------------(Why claim it??? It's the fifth Daffy...)\n\n1939\n\nHamateur Night----------------Avery---------------(Why claim it??? Take a guess... It's Egghead).\n\nA Day At The Zoo-------------Avery---------------(Why claim it??? Again, it's Egghead).\n\nPresto Change-o---------Chuck Jones----------(Why claim it??? Early RABBIT. ONLY time Bob would claim a JONES toon).\n\nBelieve It Or Else-------------Avery----------------(Why claim it??? Egghead)\n\nDetouring America-----------Avery----------------(Why claim it??? Nominated for the Oscar...At this point Clampett SEEMS to have gotten confused and FORGOT to claim \"Hare-um Scare-um\", necessary to his absurd claim on Bugs)\n\nLand Of The Midnight Fun--Avery---------------(Why claim it??? He seems to want to claim Avery's spot-gag cartoons).\n\nFresh Fish----------------------Avery-----------------(Why claim it??? Another spot-gag cartoon).\n\n1940\n\nCross Country Detours-----Avery----------------(Why claim it??? The best of the spot-gag toons ever)\n\nYou Ought To Be In Pictures--Freleng--------(Why claim it??? A superb toon, possibly inspired \"The Big Snooze\")\n\nCircus Today-------------------Avery----------------(Why claim it??? Spot gags, in-jokes & caricatures of the staff, including Bob)\n\nA Wild Hare---------------------Avery----------------(Why claim it??? The Holy Grail of toons to grab hold of, the creation of Bugs)\n\nWacky Wild Life--------------Avery-----------------(Why claim it??? Spot gags)\n\nOf Fox And Hounds---------Avery-----------------(Why claim it??? The first use of a REALLY dumb dog at WB)\n\n1941\n\nThe Crackpot Quail----------Avery-----------------(Why claim it??? Another REALLY dumb dog, and a Bugs-ish quail)\n\nTortoise Beats Hare---------Avery-----------------(Why claim it??? The second REAL Bugs Bunny cartoon)\n\nPorky's Preview---------------Avery-----------------(Why claim it??? Stick-figure animation & first use of a Warners skunk character!)\n\nHollywood Steps Out-------Avery-----------------(Why claim it??? Another spot gag toon, now with celebrities)\n\nThe Heckling Hare-----------Avery-----------------(Why claim it??? Avery's third Bugs Bunny)\n\nAll This And Rabbit Stew--Avery-----------------(Why claim it??? Tex's fourth Bugs, and the last Avery would complete)\n\nAfter Tex left there were NO major NON-JONES characters created till in 1944...\n\nHare Force-1944 (Why claim it...? Because such would let him lay claim to creation of Granny)\n\nThe Swooner Crooner-1944 (Why claim it...? Cynically, Tashlin was dead and couldn't dispute it)\n\nHare Trigger- 1945 (Why claim it...? This let's him claim the creation of Yosemite Sam)\n\nLife With Feathers-1945 (Why claim it...? Thus lays claim to creation of Sylvester & to an Oscar nomination)\n\nPeck Up Your Troubles-1945 (Why claim it...? Again let's him claim Sylvester)\n\nStrangely he claimed NOTHING in 1946 aside from the authorship of \"The Big Snooze\", but then he claimed these in 1947...\n\nThe Goofy Gophers- (Why......????????????? Let's him claim their creation).\n\nBirth Of A Notion- (Why.....?????? A great Daffy, with Peter Lorre. )\n\nTweetie Pie- (Why......??? Let's him lay claim to Friz's Oscar. Also to the first pairing w/Sylvester)\n\nHobo Bobo (Why......??? ?? Let's him claim creation of that fabulous pachyderm, Bobo.)\n\nCatch As Cats Can (Why......?????) An early Sylvester, since he claimed the other early ones, then this too).\n\nAnd yes Matthew, Bob claimed creation of Porky on the basis of winning the Schlesinger contest for an Our Gang group of characters. The original model sheet for it has Clampett's signature on it, Friz was aghast when he heard that, and said \"I drew that!\" When asked WHY he thought Bob (who he referred to as \"Bobby\") had signed it, he responded to this effect, \"I can't imagine why\". Clampett with his penchant for puns DID create the names of Porky and Beans, likewise Ham & Ex... Buuuuut he may well have been listening to Freleng, who revealed that two of his childhood playmates were a pair of very chubby brothers who were called \"Porky\" and \"Piggy\".\n\nWhat I listed for Bob was just a SMALL excerpt from his total theatrical filmography that he allowed to be published. He also denoted ALL the cartoons which he served as ANIMATOR on, which is a tremendous help as that also functions as a guide to the cartoons his best-friend/partner Chuck Jones animated on for Schesinger (at their request they were paired in their own private office). Clampett even listed all the films that he was assistant animator/inbetweener on, but failed to list who he was the assistant/inbetweener to on those films. ...In other words not much earthly use except on the early Harman-Ising films where he worked under Larry Martin."
