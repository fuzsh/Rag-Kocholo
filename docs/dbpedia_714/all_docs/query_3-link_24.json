        "text": "Indigenous actor and musician Warren Foster Snr of Wallaga Lake is finding his acting career going from strength to strength and in recent months he has been involved in a number of television and film projects.\n\nThe 44-year-old father of four and resident of the Wallaga Lake Koori Village near Bermagui will again appear in the Indigenous thriller Cleverman, set to air on ABC television soon.\n\nHe was cast as a featured extra in the second series of Cleverman that was filmed down at The Rocks in the shadow of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\n\n“I was one of the scary hairy fellas and then the plot changes and I had to shave all of my hair off,” he said.\n\nThat filming was back in November and December of last year, so fortunately his hair has grown back for several other film projects he has been involved in since.\n\nEarlier this year he was involved in a zombie apocalypse short film called “Z-End” that director Christian Fedor hopes to sell to someone like Netflix.\n\nFoster and fellow lead Melanie Parker play unlikely survivors who fight for life and hope in the ruins of a dead world, as an unknown force watches and plots their end.\n\nHe was proud to have a leading role in that production and had high hopes it would sell and get a wide audience, and he would love to have the film premiere at the Narooma Kinema.\n\nHe also has lead role in a television pilot that just wrapped up filming on the Hawkesbury River that is now in post production and will hopefully be be picked up by an Australian television station.\n\nHis agent also recently secured him a role as an extra in the production of “A Place to Call Home” that now airs on Foxtel.\n\nFoster said he was happy to be travelling around expanding his acting career, although there is plenty to keep him busy at home on the Far South Coast too.\n\nHe continues to lead the Gulaga and Gahdu Dancers that perform at various local events and has also been teaching at Eden Public School.\n\nHe has also a couple of books in the works, including a collection of 15 local Dreamtime short stories that he hopes will feature illustrations by local artists and students from Bermagui Public School.\n\nAnd he is set to appear at the two-day Giiyong Writers’ Forum celebrating Aboriginal writers and stories that will be held at Jigamy, Eden on July 1–2 thanks to South East Arts.
