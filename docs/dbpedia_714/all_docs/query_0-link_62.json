        "text": "This guide is meant to orient you to the conversation around land acknowledgments in universities and other cultural institutions, and provide resources to help you better understand the history and impact of this practice.\n\nUltimately, a land acknowledgment is not only a recognition, it is also a commitment (and an ongoing one). These statements, whether written or uttered, remind us that our relationship with the land (which preexists the act of acknowledgment, even if that relationship is tense, estranged, or otherwise challenged and challenging) is vital, and thus encourage us to center our responsibility to place and the other-than-human world. The resources we have curated here will help you better understand how to engage in a thoughtful practice of acknowledgement and recognition, of the land and the communities who have continuously cared for our world across time, while also challenging you to engage more deeply with Indigenous experiences and decolonial perspectives.\n\n\"Land is more than the diaphanousness of inhabited memories; Land is spiritual, emotional, and relational; Land is experiential, (re)membered, and storied; Land is consciousness—Land is sentient. Land refers to the ways we honor and respect her as a sentient and conscious being. Therefore, in acknowledgment of the fundamental being of Land I always capitalize Land. I have come to know Land both as a fundamental sentient being and as a philosophical construct.\"\n\n—Sandra Styres (Kanien'kehá:ka) from \"Literacies of Land: Decolonizing Narratives, Storying, and Literature\" (in Indigenous and Decolonizing Studies in Education)\n\nWe are always on Indigenous land.\n\nIndiana University and the city of Bloomington occupy lands of enduring historical and cultural significance, and that for some was, is, and will always be home, to a number of Indigenous groups, including the myaamiaki (Miami), Lënape (Delaware), saawanwa (Shawnee), kiikaapoa (Kickapoo), and Neshnabé/Bodwéwadmik (Potawatomi) peoples. We honor and acknowledge the ancestral and contemporary caretakers of this place, as well as our nonhuman spirits, elders, and guides, offer gratitude for being held and nourished by the land, and recognize the inherent sovereignty and resilience of all Native communities who have survived and still thrive to this day on Turtle Island in spite of the systemic subjugation, dispossession, and genocide that constitute the ongoing reality of settler-colonialism.\n\nAs learners, educators, and librarians, we will actively endeavor to challenge the legacies of settler-colonialism and Indigenous oppression, reject extractive and exploitative logics (both material and conceptual), continue to enact an orientation of humility, gratitude, and reciprocity toward/with local and trans-national Indigenous communities, and work to honor those who are here with us today.\n\nWe encourage all, settlers and guests alike, to look beyond acknowledgement and engage with local Indigenous communities while also cultivating thoughtful relations of reciprocity with the sacred land you live on, as well as the many vibrant beings with whom you share it.\n\nImage: \"Indigenize Indiana\" logo from the First Nations Educational and Cultural Center."
