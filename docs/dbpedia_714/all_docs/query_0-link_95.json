        "text": "Son of the famous landscape painter Pablo Fernandez, Pablo Jr. grew up heavily immersed and involved in the fine art world eventually graduating from the San Alejandro Cuban Academy of Fine Arts which is regarded as one of oldest and most prestigious fine art schools in the Southern Hemisphere. With many seeing the outstanding potential he had as a painter, Pablo Jr. was offered a rare opportunity and went on as an instructor at the school due to his skill and technique.\n\nHis work focuses on mainly on hyper-realistic paintings of women, highlighting, honoring, and celebrating the gender as an ode to the women in his life who have and continue to impact and inspired him. He hopes to spread the beauty and strength of women through his work and leave his viewers feeling empowered.\n\nWhile still early in his career at 24 years old, Pablo Jr. moved to America to further his career and currently is one of the youngest artists being considered for the Tate Modern Museum’s permanent private collection in London who houses works by contemporary pioneers like Pablo Picasso, Andy Warhol, and Roy Lichtenstein to name a few.\n\nPaul Rousso is an American-born visual artist and innovator. Educated at the California College of the Arts, his work is shown at galleries and art fairs around the globe.\n\nA prodigious perfectionist, his technique has leapt into the future, as his vision and imagination merge to embrace new conceptual and physical technology the moment they appear on the horizon. The artist lives his context and vehemently pursues his objective.\n\nRousso relentlessly excels at his efforts to evolve as an artist who will put forth an enduring impact on subsequent generations with his life’s work, “Flat Depth.” This concept, which he has been refining his entire professional career, is the logical progression of modern art – to render a flat object three-dimensional, or to collapse a three-dimensional object into two dimensions – and is a fusion of countless complex artistic methods, including painting, printing, sculpting, welding, chemistry, digital manipulation and digital printing\n\nA student of both pop-art and deep classical culture, as well as the vast interceding spectrum, Rousso endeavors to express his commentary on the human condition while physically, psychically and temporally committing his entire life to the imaginative evolution of his visual artistry. Toward that end, his creative processes are linear and complex, with many pieces developing simultaneously, and painstakingly.\n\nHis first summer job – designing the Tribeca loft of Robert De Niro – combined with stints as a Hollywood scenic artist and a brief career steeped in the cosmetics industry as an art director at Grey Advertising on the Revlon account, lend a wry touch to the social commentary woven through his work, and his vast and encompassing worldview flavors everything he creates.\n\nRaised in North Carolina, Rousso traces his inspiration to the paradoxes of the world around him and the work of the artists who began the conversation, as well as every artist through time who has advanced the subject or the art form. His work is deliberately attainable to nearly every viewer, and yet his classical training shines through as time-honored artistic conventions are woven through his work.\n\nRousso’s fascination with paper – currency, advertising, newspapers, magazines – its history and use, its rise and fall, is an emblematic theme reflected frequently in his compositions. Despite the complexity of Rousso’s artistic output, the character and subject matter of the art is relatable to all citizens of the world, so much so that it practically jumps off the wall, and straight into the viewer’s gestalt.\n\nRousso’s work is held in private collections over North America, Europe, the Middle East and beyond, and numerous public projects of his appear across the United States.\n\nGil Bruvel is a visionary artist, capable of translating complex ideas and fleeting impressions into stunning works of art. His curiosity about the human condition and the workings of the human mind is honed through daily meditative practice. His art emerges from a deep contemplation of images, emotions, and sensations, which he refines continually before he casts them into material form.\n\nWe try and fail until we get it right. Failure is essential in crystalizing and improving on our initial ideas. There is a great complexity to us and to all that surrounds us, which is not accessible unless we are willing to move beyond physicality and into the deeper layers of our consciousness. Therein lies an experience that is to be felt, rather than described or rationalized. Bruvel’s challenge as an artist is to give it a non-verbal expression through the use of form, patterns, and color.\n\nBruvel’s early work is marked by a desire to escape, rather than penetrate, reality at a deeper level. He was influenced by the surrealists such as Salvador Dali, Max Ernst, and Georgio de Chirico. His art was an exercise in imagination through the painting of alternate realities.\n\nWhile elements of surrealism have been present in his works throughout his career, Bruvel’s later efforts play with the distortion of realities, duality, and multiple perspectives. In his Cubist series, he reduces human form to component planes and geometric shapes, using negative space to create positive form, and vice versa. He seeks to reinforce the notion of fluidity by expressing multiple viewpoints simultaneously. Bruvel often bends or extends the lines that define human form, dissolving its rigidity and allowing it to connect with the flow that constantly surrounds it. To convey the complex interplay of forces that immerse us, he disrupts vertical lines by inserting horizontal ones. He creates intentional gaps and negative space to highlight disconnect.\n\nHaving trained extensively in his father’s cabinet-making business and later at a prestigious restoration workshop, Bruvel’s work displays a mastery of technique and high-level craftsmanship. He moves through a wide range of media and forms with ease. His sculptures in bronze, wood, and stainless steel, as well as his functional furniture and mixed media, all reflect a well-defined move towards three-dimensional representation. The influence of architects such as Zaha Hadid, Frank Gehry, and Lebbeus Woods is present in many of his pieces.\n\nMany themes that define Bruvel’s work culminate in his most recent series, “Bending the Lines.” At first glance, we recognize the ever-prevailing human form but are instantly transfixed by the thousands of wooden shafts that comprise the work. The pixelated outlines mimic our complex neural pathways, while his use of gradient color reinforces our minds’ interconnectedness. The wood is charred to show the impact of natural phenomena on the physical form and its inherently transient nature, which is transformed by the passage of time, revealing further patterns and detail.\n\nGil Bruvel was born in Australia, but raised in the South of France. He currently resides in Wimberley, Texas.\n\nIn scenes which sit on the divide between public and private space, the notion of luxury as portrayed in popular culture serves as a setting in which narrative can – and does – occur. The scenes I paint have an inherent sense of familiarity recognizable from popular culture and television. Working from found images from the public domain gives source imagery a certain currency for me; it already has a loaded cultural or experiential significance before I come across it. Combining these found images through a process of sketching, digital editing and finally through physical painting, layers of narrative from culture and art-historical references reveal themselves incidentally – much like the mechanisms of a Hollywood production.\n\nFormally and conceptually, the reference to constructed environments becomes the main function of my paintings; an allusive stasis borrowed from the mediums of photography and film, and adapted to painting in an ongoing dialogue with contemporary cultural discourse.\n\nThe heightened sense of colour in the hypnotic shimmer of aqua pools in the paintings serves a dual function as an indirect reference to the screen but also encapsulates the idea of escapism. In ‘Pool With Yellow Float’ the inviting glow of the pool’s surface draws the viewer in, with only a thin silhouette of hedgerow separating the viewer from the space – it is tantalisingly within reach. The exotic foliage and low hanging power lines locate the scene in a typical Los Angeles setting, heightened by the effect of the pool and distant glow of the city lights in the dusk. The float motif has been recurring in the paintings over the last couple of years; it adds a fragment of narrative, a human presence in an otherwise private scene. It also serves an allegorical function, echoing the paintings of Hockney and the mythic promise of Los Angeles.\n\nBorn in 1971 in San Bernardino, California and raised in the Atlanta area, Craig first recognized his creative drive via crayons on his parents’ walls, like many inspired young artists, and by the age of 7 his capacity for detailed visual interpretation became undeniable. After excelling in an introductory drawing class in school, Craig continued to develop technically and conceptually through his own diligent studies while always planning to pursue a formal art education.\n\nHe accepted a soccer scholarship at the University of Mobile, AL along with 3 summer art classes and in the first, Pottery, Craig’s light bulb switched on in a rejuvenating glow. Learning became enjoyable from that point forward in his life and he was immediately thrust into the scholastic limelight. To help sustain his education he found financial support and enjoyment in driving to New Orleans on his weekends and creating portraits for passersby on the streets, with original rates that baffle today, at $15 for charcoal and $30 for watercolor. This endeavor helped him perfect his flair for replicating the human figure and afforded the budding artist a sense of economic autonomy. With a focus on studio art, his minor concentration in theater further diversified Craig’s craft and armed him with additional techniques in makeup and set design. This blending of disparate influences and media is visually apparent in all of Craig’s works, which demonstrate a broad knowledge and appreciation of the human form as well as the colorful world these beings occupy. Craig earned an area award for academic excellence and the university’s most prestigious exhibition, “Art with a Southern Drawl,” featured 1 of Craig’s pieces, out of 42 chosen from a field of more than 1,600 submissions.\n\nHe learned how to frame art while working in a small frame shop part time while he was a student and a few months later his coworker pointed him in the direction of Deljou in Atlanta. He was hired and remained in framing for 4 years after pioneering the department’s establishment before he realigned with his passion of art and joined the league of other artists in the art studio.\n\nIn his prolific career is a culmination of textbook artistic knowledge and keen aesthetic sense that has gone from a “slow and studied” application to “fast and free of precise thought”. Craig’s collections run the gamut from abstract expressionism to haunting, graphic realism, each one a reflection of its creator’s unique vision. He is most well-known for his Populus series, which drew inspiration from a balcony overlooking Orange Beach, Alabama where patrons enjoying a wedding party seemed to form the shape of an eye where they stood. Craig explains, “Inspiration begins with a ‘What if…’ as I consider alternate imagery, surfaces, effects, results, etc. It comes from the past in conjunction with now. Like a bolt of lightning.” Since the epiphany, his Populus series is now home to dozens of celebrities and icons of all ages including: Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Freddie Mercury, James Bond, Salvador Dali, Pablo Picasso, Van Gough, Gandhi, James Dean, Lady Justice, John Lennon, Queen Elizabeth, Darth Vader, Michael Jackson, Audrey Hepburn, and many more.\n\nMichael Callas doesn’t live a Bohemian lifestyle. He is not the archetypal Romantic artist in the studio, maniacally laboring away and working in erratic ways to keep normal out at all costs. His methodology is premeditated (industrious as his artists friends tend to note), operating within an orderly studio that leaves no material out of line. Whereas some artists excel in sporadicity, Callas thrives in structure, ignited by his engineering and carpentry background. Rather than centering his craft around the finished product, he utilizes the active nature of the creation process as his muse.\n\nIn the primordial stages of his career, Callas recalls being so focused on completing the task at hand instead of enjoying each step of creation. He thought adherence to structure made him less of an artist, unable to fit the public eye’s perception of an artist. He quickly resented that outlook on his artistry and shifted his mindset towards a more appreciative view of the creation process: calculated, savoring the act of culmination and stressing executive function.\n\nCallas’ relationship to education catalyzed his view of the creative process through an executive function lens: ritualistic and rigid with confined parameters. Growing up with a learning disability, Callas struggled with maintaining focus while reading and completing tasks, the severity of which drove his mom to earn her Ph.D in Special Education to decipher what would make her son tick. Reflecting on this adversity years later, his philosophy is that one’s practice should be conducted under the paradigm of repetition, which helps him complete goals. Contrasting his current self against who he was 15 years ago, the efficiency he operates with now renders him wholly different from that previous persona, evolving from an upcoming artist to a well-established savant.\n\nThe way Michael Callas operates is deeply rooted in the concept of planned communities. Born and raised in Orange County, he was fascinated with them, always living in these premeditated templates of suburbia. Their repetitive nature subconsciously had an effect on his artistry, often producing the same silhouette of a painting with an altered color scheme.\n\nCompartmentalization is what most aptly describes him. Confined shapes, no gradation or bleeding between colors, a contrarian to traditionalist oil paintings. Architecture is a vehicle of expression he closely identifies with as evidenced in his interior-centric collection featuring Winter Living Room II and Kitchen I.\n\nBecause Callas came into the realm of fine art in a self-proclaimed ignorant way, bursting in the door rather than carefully stepping through it, influence generally evaded his stylistic evolution; despite this circumnavigation of a typical artist’s path, he appreciates the ethos of the Renaissance, where the artist is simultaneously the scientist, creator and engineer. This philosophy is apparent with artists he admires like Michelangelo, Bronzino, Botticelli. In his own work, he draws parallels to Warhol and Lichtenstein, pop art contemporaries who take a curatorial approach to their subject matter as well as David Hockney with his attention to color and composition.\n\nSince his pivotal Case Study series, Callas has continued to grow into his painting style, exhibiting a more refined technicality and fluency. New technology took his ideation process from traditional paper and pen to digital, from an opaque projector with a magnifying glass to a 4k projector alongside an iPad Pro, which increased the specificity of color choice, level of detail on shapes and layer separation.\n\n“It took a really long time to make the work truly represent who I was, attempting to minimize the influence of who I wanted to be seen as. The artistic process is genuinely who I am. I know that the audience is extremely intelligent and I want them to see me honestly through my work.”\n\nHe acknowledges there is a dialogue, however indirect, between the artist and the audience, and to act like an artist is above that, in a vacuum with no real-world impact, is disingenuous and not why people become an artist.\n\nMichael Callas wants to be remembered like Walt Disney, a virtuoso known for the complexity of their craft and whose work blossoms into multiple fields outside of their promoted practice. He’s always striving to improve, become more complex and execute ideas more cleanly, essentially hiding the human hand and leaving the audience with the firm belief that this work was made by machine.\n\nSandro Figueroa Garcia, artistically known as Sen2 Figueroa was born in 1969. He grew up in Canteras, a neighborhood of Santurce, Puerto Rico.\n\nIn the 1980’s his fascination with graffiti, color and letter forms took a hold of Sen2’s dreams. He chased his dreams to the streets of New York. Here he began to cultivate his love for urban art, creating graffiti murals and commercial work, but his vision was broader. It was at this point in his life that he met and joined the most famous graffiti crew ever assembled in the world to date: Tats Cru. With Tats Cru, Sen2 travelled throughout Europe and the rest of the globe. He found himself creating art for music videos, working with high profile artists (Jennifer Lopez, Nas, Missy Elliot). He was even commissioned by Robert DeNiro.\n\nSen2 evolved from spray painting wild-style pieces to developing mixed media works on canvases. He moved from classical New York graffiti art to a combination of graphic lettering styles with 3-D elements, imagery of pop art, and abstract art techniques.\n\nSen2 refers to iconic pop art as one of his art passions. One can recognize hints of Andy Warhol’s or Roy Lichtenstein’s inspiration in his works while applying his signature urban style from the streets to subtle reminders of his urbanesque childhood.\n\nHis work creates an entertaining dialogue between color and motion. Graphic elements, bold use of colors, sharp lines and subtle blends that collide intensely amongst a variation of textures and gestural splashes of color pave way for Sen2’s illustrious success with the canvas.\n\nBesides the fine art and pop culture references, all of Sen2’s pieces have graffiti elements in them to reflect his artistic roots, as well as his sophisticated and constantly evolving style.\n\nSen2 blurs the lines between graffiti and fine art. His beautiful chaos of modern and contemporary interpretations have created a signature style that collectors and art aficionados continue to admire. His love for contemporary, pop and urban art are evident in every piece.\n\nSince 2001, his artwork has been on display around the globe, exhibiting in numerous solo and group shows in America, Canada, and all throughout Europe. Sen2 has grown into one of hardest working contemporary artists in the world, with abstract paintings on display throughout America and Europe.\n\nSen2 Studio is located in the Bronx, NY, where he currently resides.\n\nBrendan Murphy (B 1971 – ) is a world renowned contemporary artist whose works are found in prominent private collections and public displays around the world. Famous collectors include Serena Williams, Novak Djokovic, Larry Page, Warren Buffett, Ryan Gosling, Grant Cardone among many others.\n\nSince his early career, Brendan has blended abstract and figurative forms to reveal meaning with deeper contemplations through his sculpture and painting pieces. Brendan believes it is in art’s potential where we can most universally transmit positive energy. He recognizes the effect this energy, when experienced as a collective, can have on society as a whole.\n\nIn 2021, Brendan founded the Boonji Project and did his first NFT drop of the Boonji Avatars. It became the biggest NFT primary sale in history. He is also the man behind “Frozen with Desire” sculpture. A 42” spaceman covered in 6,200 responsibly sourced diamonds with a total weight of 517-carats. In 2022, he also installed a 13′ Boonji Spaceman sculpture in Minute Maid Park Stadium, home of the Houston Astros baseball team.\n\nBrendan currently works from his studio in Miami, FL.\n\nThe sculptural work of Brendan Murphy communicates a rare perspective on the modern human experience through explorations of form, color, language, and universal symbols. Thematically, Brendan Murphy explores the interplay of beauty, power and the need to understand the source of all the energies of life.\n\nThe inspirations of the work; formulas, equations, relationships; create a pictorial spectrum of human emotion and the unifying natures of shared humanity. Through the layering of these emblems, Brendan Murphy’s painted works boldly portray careful imagery and density of the human experience, exposing the deep natural beauty that surface in this fragile balance.\n\n—\n\nA Window Into Your Soul. Symbols that provoke curiosity, messages that promote thought and equations that signify the complexities of the inner heart.\n\nSuch is the compelling swirl of paintings, sculptures and concept pieces emerging from the studio of L.A.-based Brendan Murphy. Charged with color and immediacy, his work explores the abstruse nature of the human spectrum of emotion–musing on everything from fear and uncertainty to the random and sometimes nonsensical decisions of the heart—demanding an awareness and dialogue with viewers. Mentored under iconic New York painters Eric Fischl, David Salle and Ross Bleckner, with celebrity fans like Serena Williams, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovik and pieces represented in over 600 private collections and at every major art fair, Murphy is one to watch.\n\nFresh off a major solo show in London last year, this is an artist currently entering new heights of his creative power, with works that read like a book into the inner workings of anyone who is fortunate enough to stand face to face with his captivating series. With a potential and drive that is limitless, Murphy invites collectors to delve further into the inner workings of their mind and find themselves within each of his pieces. And in a post-COVID-19 world, where connection is craved and emotions are explosive, his is a voice poised to resonate even more profoundly.\n\nThink of the movie A Beautiful Mind for a glimpse into Murphy’s own brain and process. The artist predominantly uses symbols, shapes, and words to fill vast surface areas, for an abstract effect that’s science class chalkboard meets Jean-Michel Basquiat canvas. The writing in his works is pointedly haphazard and littered with everything from lyrics to words like love, lust, and passion. By design, it not only provokes a visual conversation on sight but prompts a deeper gut check too.\n\nMurphy uses a wide range of impactful materials, tools and a patent-protected chroming technique to create his range of work. His spacemen sculptures and some of his fingerprint paintings, when crafted using a reflective silver-based chrome, cause viewers to quite literally confront themselves while gazing at his work. The spaceman, according to Murphy, is the embodiment of the human desire to look ahead and venture beyond boundaries, to step into the unknown and be present in the moment—to Murphy, that’s the purest form of existence. He’s continually inspired by the interplay of beauty, power and the human need to understand the energies of life.\n\n“Inspiration for my work is exploring how we process emotions, the internal struggle that’s shared by everyone,” says Murphy. “Landing on a feeling is a very abstract process, it’s never A+B=C. And mathematically, the use of universal symbols like the golden ratio, the fibonacci sequence or circles lays a foundation of subconscious connection. These are forums that exist inside all of us.”\n\nMurphy’s personal journey—a professional basketball player turned Wall Street trader turned successful artist—naturally plays a major role in the work he produces. Everything from the trauma of 9/11 (as a Wall Street stockbroker, he lost friends and colleagues) to the highly charged atmosphere of playing sports professionally has shaped him as an artist and exposed him to wildly different lifestyles. 9/11, particularly, is the day he pinpoints as the turning point for him as an artist, a moment that made him question what it was he genuinely wanted to be doing with his life. The body of work he’s produced ever since is his answer.\n\nWorks by Brendan Murphy are currently on view online and by appointment starting May 11, 2020 through Art Angels LA. The gallerists have additionally created an exhibition preview for collectors with price information.\n\n– Shaun Thompson\n\nSwiss-born, Dubai-based artist Stefania Nazzal constructs vibrant rainbows that emulate her first encounter with a rainbow. Symbolizing hope and the transience of life, the rainbow becomes her tool to manipulate the spectrum of light, seeking to evoke the same hopeful and magical feelings that remain associated with her fond memories of a childhood escape.\n\nAs a child, Nazzal escaped the world through color. An encounter with a rainbow offered her a moment of magic that she extended through the activity of coloring, a contemplative process that she has brought to her practice. Her bold use of color recreates her magical escape, capturing the transient experience of a rainbow in a magnificent, fixed form.\n\nStefania Nazzal’s artistic practice is an exercise in breaking through her notions of perfection. In a meticulous process, for each work, she begins by planning a base layer, mapping out the grid of colored PVC strings that wrap around her canvases. She then builds on additional layers, improvising the color scheme for the second and third layers, beyond the initially planned base. Through a process of repetition, Nazzal’s work becomes meditative, offering an escape from the world in both the process of creation and her resulting organized, whimsical colorscapes.\n\nFor Nazzal, constructing these refractions of light evokes the energy of a rainbow. The seven visible colors of a rainbow are in fact different frequencies or energy levels of sunlight reflected through color, while each color is associated with a specific type of energy and state of wellbeing. This spectrum of colors corresponds to the body’s energy centers, with each chakra, associated to a specific color. Nazzal amplifies the energy of a rainbow by a gesture of multiplication and scale, reproducing variations of rainbows in multiple color schemes and various dimensions, each evoking a particular positive energy.\n\nThough Nazzal continues to experiment with different mediums, her primary medium of choice is PVC, for the sculptural quality and pristine shine that it offers her works. Her use of PVC also has a sustainability objective, by repurposing PVC materials that would otherwise be harmful to the environment, Nazzal creates permanent works of art that give life to an otherwise disposable material.\n\nAs her practice evolves, she continues to introduce different mediums, building on her layers of PVC strings with paint, spray paint, sprinklings of diamond dust, as well as casing her works in plexiglass.\n\nPhilippe Shangti is a complete artist with an extraordinary talent to transcribe his art pieces into scenic performances totally imagined by him. Thus he directs the full artistic conception by creating his own universe. Among his notorious pieces, he signed several ‘tag’ works such as the very famous “Enjoy Your Fucking Dinner”.\n\nHis art comes in a variety of photographs, artistic concepts but also in limited edition sculptures. His work is exhibited in many countries in the best art galleries in Europe and the USA.\n\nConstantly looking for new ideas and challenges, the artist also created special works featuring sports personalities, collectors and their families. In addition, he collaborates with many luxury brands as part of the development of a range of products steeped with his art and his universe.\n\nWith his experience, the artist organizes ephemeral private events on the international scene where he manages to recreate the artistic atmosphere he is immersed in, in order to carry the visitors away and intensely connect them to his artistic world.\n\nAfter living in St Tropez for more than 10 years, the artist wished to upgrade his career and decided to move his studios and all his teams to the Principality of Andorra where he experiences now a new energy.\n\nIn 2019, Philippe Shangti has been selected to represent the Principality of Andorra at the 58th Venice Biennale.\n\nHis monumental and highly committed project “Future Is Now” aims to demonstrate that the behaviour of people today irreversibly determines tomorrow’s world. Here again, the message is clear: to change human consciousness and behaviour by shaking up the values and priorities of our societies.\n\nThe international press and the art world have ranked the Andorran pavilion – and Philippe’s work “The Future Is Now” – among the 10 essential pavilions of this Biennale.\n\nFrom July 2020 to September 2021, his exhibition “Future is now”, realized for the 2019 Venice Biennale, was shown at the Museum of Fine Arts of Carcassonne, France, marking the first museum exhibition of the artist’s career.\n\nFrom March to July 2021, the Erarta Museum of Contemporary Art in Saint Petersburg Russia, organized an exhibition of some thirty works by the artist, mixing various artworks from different collections.\n\nBrendan Murphy (B 1971 – ) is a world renowned contemporary artist whose works are found in prominent private collections and public displays around the world.

Even if the representations can stand as indications of a contemporary Western zeitgeist, the images lose their temporal determinability through their static transience and acquire an essence of infinity.\n\nAbove all, his most recent paintings impress with their oversized and hyper-realistic representation of people. The artist plays with the effect on the observer right from the beginning. Although the works appear to be photographs from a distance, on closer observation the large scale of the portrait establishes the macroscopically precise observation of the artist and his masterly intercourse with colour shading and colour shift rich with nuances, that sharpen the view of the picturesque.\n\nMike Dargas, born in Cologne in 1983, stood out as early as his childhood years with his talent for drawing. Through his mother, the young schoolboy discovered the works of Salvador Dali, Caravaggio and HR Giger, who acted as an influential example for him as he moved towards adolescence. He attracted the keenest interest at only eleven years old, when he painted the cathedral square in Cologne with adaptations of master works in pastel and chalk. Besides painting, the many and varied techniques of which he made his own through independent study and the adult class of a school sponsored by the arts, he also began to develop an interest in three-dimensional art. During his training as a carpenter, he created sculptures from wood and metal. But his passion continued with painting, to which he turned with an intense focus in his mid-twenties, mainly through his work as a tattooist. With his particularly refined portraits in the style of the old masters, Mike Dargas won numerous awards and distinctions on the tattoo scene and attracted attention worldwide, above all due to the rapid distribution of his works through social media. He used social media to eagerly share his enthusiasm for perfecting painting techniques and high art in the trompe-l’œil style.\n\nRussell Young was born in 1959 in Yorkshire, where he was immediately put into a foster home, then a nunnery, and was adopted before reaching the age of one. No one knew who exactly his birth parents were, though there were rumors his mother was fourteen, and his father was from Italy. In Northern England, he spent much of his time moving from town to town and living an isolating existence. Here he would take his first photographs of birds on the lawn only for the film to come back developed so dark he could hardly make out the birds. Like these first photographs, Young’s life developed with areas blotted by abandonment. The lack of a personal or even a shared history has left him free to explore dreams and fantasies of sometimes better, sometimes harsher worlds. That yearning has resulted in a body of work that is an uncompromising, intimate love letter addressed to these vast reaches, which, with every passing inscription, are revealed to be rich, wild frontiers.\n\nWith few prospects other than working in the factory towns, Young lied about his age to attend art college at the age of fifteen. Had he not done so, he would have most likely moved to the streets of London and died. He moved to the capital five years later and caught the attention of photographer Christos Raftopoulos, whom he assisted for several years. Raftopoulos introduced Young to another side of himself, building him his own darkroom, taking him to the opera, showing him the limits of his life did not need to confine him or his work. It was during this time—still rough in nature and occasionally homeless—he photographed the early gigs of Bauhaus, R.E.M., and The Smiths. His innate eye for movement landed him photoshoots for magazines and eventually his first record sleeve cover for the 1986 album Faith by George Michael.\n\nYoung continued to photograph celebrities and direct music videos, eventually leading him to the United States. The rock star aesthetic he had brandished in his photography lent itself to his earliest screen prints that followed in the 2000s. His first series, Pig Portraits, shown in Los Angeles in 2003, collected the infamous mugshots (real and staged) of celebrities awash in fame and monochrome but also restrained as a result of their actions. In his following series, Dirty Pretty Things, he began to incorporate his popular use of diamond dust. The glam shots of cultural icons, glittering in pulverized diamonds, embodied the lusts and aspirations of their eras.\n\n“My art is not about what I see… Its about what I invite you to see” are the words of contemporary light artist Olivia Steele, who has earned an international reputation for her spirited public neon happenings. Always symbolic and sometimes irreverent, her neon statements suspend time and motion. The interpretable phrases inhabit spaces of contradictory, confrontational or conciliatory meaning. They crystallize the unity between landscape, semiotics and spectacle that engenders myriad avenues for contemplation.\n\nSteele harnesses the power of neon gas to assert symbolic phrasing that allures and provokes. Her expansive career has seen her impart fragments of wisdom and wit all over the globe, from Tulum to Berlin to Mumbai in the form of site-specific land art and indoor installation. Aside from the immediately iconic and often humorous style of Steele’s work, her interventions are pointedly placed in environments that prompt existential musings. Her innate relationship with the sublime and spiritual manifest as explosive imagery where Steele’s opus positions her as one of the most compelling contemporary artists working in her field today.\n\nProving that “it is the spectator and not life that art really mirrors,” Steele’s oeuvre is a synthesis of contrast and contradiction. She encapsulates the contemporary storyteller and uses the traditional medium of neon to form her striking expressions that address the vortex of modernity. Her neon works are short, punctuated truths that mirror the ingenuity (or malaise) of the digital age. Her glass acumens are often paired with incendiary imagery – explosive atomic bombs and religious symbols – that are evocative stimuli for the viewer. Covert emotions and unforeseen forces also charge Steele’s themes where her studies into consciousness and the divine pervade her transformative pieces.\n\nIn dialogue with media such as facades, rivers, photographs, and found objects, she tells short stories that evoke thought while illuminating our perception with acumens formed in neon glass. Henri Nannen once wrote, “Art has to be provocative, it has to stimulate our thoughts.” With this as encouragement, Olivia Steele uses iconic images such as exploding atomic bombs or the seemingly sacred cross along with deep personal sentiments to jar the viewer beyond the everyday. The nature of her content is both provocative and reflective as her work asks the viewer to consider the hidden emotions and unforeseen forces in these moments of reflection. Another level of Steele’s contemplative works is transformation, inspired by the otherworldly nature of divine inspiration and consciousness. “Good, bad, right or wrong, it’s all relative. Art is notoriously ambiguous as there are no rules. The art of challenging conventional semiotics and observing the vast spectrum of strangers’ reactions and interpretations is both filled with lessons and highly rewarding,” says the artist. Yet, she holds true to the belief that it is the spectator and not life that art really mirrors.\n\nThe story of a talent started after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Through his striking symbolism Michael Moebius gives a new dimension to popular cultural icons, adding brightly colored gum bubbles to monochrome portraits and creating a new way of communicating emotions.\n\nMichael Moebius came into the world in 1968, in Germany. Having developed a love for art at an early age, cartooning became his first passion. However, in the then-communist East Germany, more pragmatic pursuits were the order of the day. Art would have to be put on the back burner while a formal education was pursued, and Michael decided on a career in engineering and construction. It was during a stint working in a parallel field of architectural illustration that Michael happened upon a book featuring the pin-ups of Alberto Vargas. A new love affair took root, and Michael decided that figurative art would be his life’s work.\n\nHe started studying painting at the academy of arts in Dresden, and in 1998 he got a big breakthrough. It was at this time, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, that Michel was able to make his way to the United States. His talent as a painter and photographer was readily apparent, and he quickly became a sought-after favorite of collectors. Michael has already been part of major exhibitions throughout the US. His collector base and publishers include Playboy, Procter & Gamble, Laura Biagiotti, Vogue, Vanity Fair, Superyacht Digest, and other well-known companies.\n\nHis work has also won attention from celebrities including Mel Gibson, Paris Hilton, Hugh Hefner, Rihanna, David Guetta and KISS frontman Gene Simmons.\n\nMichael Moebius shows a huge talent when it comes to turning pop art and popular culture on its head. Today, Moebius has become one of the most recognized and in-demand contemporary artists in the world. His now famous bubble gum portraits have become a favorite among interior designers and investors the world over thanks to their striking symbolism.\n\nUnlike his gum bubbles, the artist’s value continues to expand and shows no sign of bursting. Moebius’ commercial abilities and partnerships with some of the world’s most popular names means that he is a serious name in the art investment world.\n\nMost famously, Michael Moebius gives a new dimension to popular cultural icons, adding brightly colored gum bubbles to monochrome portraits. Marilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth have all been re-imagined in this style, up to his latest work (“All you need is gum”) where he depicts the four Beatles all with signature gum bubbles.\n\nIn terms of artistic influences, Moebius cites inspiration from Italian Renaissance artist Titian and the genius baroque Caravaggio, as well as more contemporary names such as Andy Warhol, Pablo Picasso and Alberto Vargas.\n\nHis novel portrayal of much-featured subjects make Moebius’ bubblegum works of an art investment favorite. His art also acts as a window into his personality and creative vision.\n\nWhat’s most interesting is the contrast between the communist ideals which influenced the artist (Michael was born in 1968 when Germany was still divided in two by the Berlin Wall) and the western values and popular culture.\n\nMoebius became aware of cultural differences between his home and the rest of the world, and this incongruity plays a significant role in his art today.\n\n“Almost all of the items which we received from the west part of the world such as magazines, toys, soda cans were forbidden in east Berlin. As a child and growing up I would dearly hold onto the then-forbidden items… these really influenced me with their colors, designs and scents.\n\nThe more Michael Moebius was pushed to conform with communist ideals, the more he became enamored with western popular culture, and the more he was driven to create. After his conscription in the East German army, and then the fall of the Berlin Wall, he travelled to the US to dedicate his life entirely to art.\n\nU.K. born, U.S based artist studied Fashion before continuing her education in design at The University of Manchester. She has exhibited at galleries in New York, London, Paris, Los Angeles, Abu Dhabi, Basel, Miami, Hong Kong, Zurich and Brussels. Alongside her collaborations with luxury brands such as Saks, Soho House and Netflix, Elizabeth has sustained ongoing partnerships with the UN’s Lionshare Fund, the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy and most notably, was commissioned by HRH The Prince of Wales in collaboration with the Prince’s Trust 50th Anniversary.\n\nIn her studio, Waggett’s distinctive style is informed by her background in gilding; large, almost impossible paintings and drawings are made, sculptural in experience. Whether the primary medium or an accent to illuminate the underbellies of the animal kingdom, her inclusion of 23-karat gold leaf ties her robust body of work together, achieving a simultaneous reconstruction of form, obscuring that which seems immediately discernible, often applied using traditional Victoriana patterns, nodding to the British roots of the artist.\n\nStudies of smaller creatures are augmented by scale to overwhelm and jar the viewer. Formally, the level of skilled craftmanship these drawings possess examines the importance of their participation in our environment as beings which exist on purpose and live with purpose.\n\nWaggetts paintings are wrought of apparent tension and transformation, unsettling viewers without distancing them and remaining, ultimately, committed to beauty. The methodology of each work marries the specimens, mirroring the strength and robustness possessed by the minutiae of nature. These works invite one into a state of rueful contemplation, to make sense of the world around them and the part we all play as walking complexities.\n\nAfter six years living and working in New York City, Elizabeth is currently residing and maintaining a full time studio practice between Texas and France.\n\nPhilippe Shangti is a complete artist with an extraordinary talent to transcribe his art pieces into scenic performances totally imagined by him. Thus he directs the full artistic conception by creating his own universe. Among his notorious pieces, he signed several ‘tag’ works such as the very famous “Enjoy Your Fucking Dinner”.\n\nHis art comes in a variety of photographs, artistic concepts but also in limited edition sculptures. His work is exhibited in many countries in the best art galleries in Europe and the USA.\n\nConstantly looking for new ideas and challenges, the artist also created special works featuring sports personalities, collectors and their families. In addition, he collaborates with many luxury brands as part of the development of a range of products steeped with his art and his universe.\n\nWith his experience, the artist organizes ephemeral private events on the international scene where he manages to recreate the artistic atmosphere he is immersed in, in order to carry the visitors away and intensely connect them to his artistic world.\n\nAfter living in St Tropez for more than 10 years, the artist wished to upgrade his career and decided to move his studios and all his teams to the Principality of Andorra where he experiences now a new energy.\n\nIn 2019, Philippe Shangti has been selected to represent the Principality of Andorra at the 58th Venice Biennale.\n\nHis monumental and highly committed project “Future Is Now” aims to demonstrate that the behaviour of people today irreversibly determines tomorrow’s world. Here again, the message is clear: to change human consciousness and behaviour by shaking up the values and priorities of our societies.\n\nThe international press and the art world have ranked the Andorran pavilion – and Philippe’s work “The Future Is Now” – among the 10 essential pavilions of this Biennale.\n\nFrom July 2020 to September 2021, his exhibition “Future is now”, realized for the 2019 Venice Biennale, was shown at the Museum of Fine Arts of Carcassonne, France, marking the first museum exhibition of the artist’s career.\n\nFrom March to July 2021, the Erarta Museum of Contemporary Art in Saint Petersburg Russia, organized an exhibition of some thirty works by the artist, mixing various artworks from different collections.\n\nThe story of a talent started after the fall of the Berlin Wall.

His innovative images printed on metallic paper in very limited editions of seven are filled with light and color, and resonate with harmonic beauty, with a rather edgy and critical approach.\n\nHe began his photography career at the age of 20 in the advertising industry and established himself as a fashion photographer. He later introduced his passion for poetry in his work and developed a unique visual perspective, approaching form and light as visual poetry. The poetic power and vitality of his talent led to a series of invitations to exhibit his work across Europe.\n\nHis first solo show was sponsored by the Art et Partage Association in Aix de Provence in 2005 entitled Brésil Autrement. In a brief period Robierb established an impressive international exhibition record and as his career flourished he settled in the United States.\n\nAs an artist he is keen in photographing all sorts of people, objects and scenes around the world with their different shapes and ethnicities. His recent works provocatively meditate on the contemporary American Society, making emphasis in the sociocultural issues that define our current times.\n\nIn the past year the artist received honorary mentions at the International Photography Awards in a variety of categories. He has recently exhibited in New York City and has been an active participant in the Art Basel Miami Beach for several years, exhibiting at Red Dot and Overture Miami. Robierb currently lives in New York City and Miami, where he maintains a studio in South Beach.\n\nPaul Rousso is an American-born visual artist and innovator. Educated at the California College of the Arts, his work is shown at galleries and art fairs around the globe.\n\nA prodigious perfectionist, his technique has leapt into the future, as his vision and imagination merge to embrace new conceptual and physical technology the moment they appear on the horizon. The artist lives his context and vehemently pursues his objective.\n\nRousso relentlessly excels at his efforts to evolve as an artist who will put forth an enduring impact on subsequent generations with his life’s work, “Flat Depth.” This concept, which he has been refining his entire professional career, is the logical progression of modern art – to render a flat object three-dimensional, or to collapse a three-dimensional object into two dimensions – and is a fusion of countless complex artistic methods, including painting, printing, sculpting, welding, chemistry, digital manipulation and digital printing\n\nA student of both pop-art and deep classical culture, as well as the vast interceding spectrum, Rousso endeavors to express his commentary on the human condition while physically, psychically and temporally committing his entire life to the imaginative evolution of his visual artistry. Toward that end, his creative processes are linear and complex, with many pieces developing simultaneously, and painstakingly.\n\nHis first summer job – designing the Tribeca loft of Robert De Niro – combined with stints as a Hollywood scenic artist and a brief career steeped in the cosmetics industry as an art director at Grey Advertising on the Revlon account, lend a wry touch to the social commentary woven through his work, and his vast and encompassing worldview flavors everything he creates.\n\nRaised in North Carolina, Rousso traces his inspiration to the paradoxes of the world around him and the work of the artists who began the conversation, as well as every artist through time who has advanced the subject or the art form. His work is deliberately attainable to nearly every viewer, and yet his classical training shines through as time-honored artistic conventions are woven through his work.\n\nRousso’s fascination with paper – currency, advertising, newspapers, magazines – its history and use, its rise and fall, is an emblematic theme reflected frequently in his compositions. Despite the complexity of Rousso’s artistic output, the character and subject matter of the art is relatable to all citizens of the world, so much so that it practically jumps off the wall, and straight into the viewer’s gestalt.\n\nRousso’s work is held in private collections over North America, Europe, the Middle East and beyond, and numerous public projects of his appear across the United States.\n\nThe story of a talent started after the fall of the Berlin Wall.

Symbolizing hope and the transience of life, the rainbow becomes her tool to manipulate the spectrum of light, seeking to evoke the same hopeful and magical feelings that remain associated with her fond memories of a childhood escape.\n\nAs a child, Nazzal escaped the world through color. An encounter with a rainbow offered her a moment of magic that she extended through the activity of coloring, a contemplative process that she has brought to her practice. Her bold use of color recreates her magical escape, capturing the transient experience of a rainbow in a magnificent, fixed form.\n\nStefania Nazzal’s artistic practice is an exercise in breaking through her notions of perfection. In a meticulous process, for each work, she begins by planning a base layer, mapping out the grid of colored PVC strings that wrap around her canvases. She then builds on additional layers, improvising the color scheme for the second and third layers, beyond the initially planned base. Through a process of repetition, Nazzal’s work becomes meditative, offering an escape from the world in both the process of creation and her resulting organized, whimsical colorscapes.\n\nFor Nazzal, constructing these refractions of light evokes the energy of a rainbow. The seven visible colors of a rainbow are in fact different frequencies or energy levels of sunlight reflected through color, while each color is associated with a specific type of energy and state of wellbeing. This spectrum of colors corresponds to the body’s energy centers, with each chakra, associated to a specific color. Nazzal amplifies the energy of a rainbow by a gesture of multiplication and scale, reproducing variations of rainbows in multiple color schemes and various dimensions, each evoking a particular positive energy.\n\nThough Nazzal continues to experiment with different mediums, her primary medium of choice is PVC, for the sculptural quality and pristine shine that it offers her works. Her use of PVC also has a sustainability objective, by repurposing PVC materials that would otherwise be harmful to the environment, Nazzal creates permanent works of art that give life to an otherwise disposable material.\n\nAs her practice evolves, she continues to introduce different mediums, building on her layers of PVC strings with paint, spray paint, sprinklings of diamond dust, as well as casing her works in plexiglass.\n\nRussell Young was born in 1959 in Yorkshire, where he was immediately put into a foster home, then a nunnery, and was adopted before reaching the age of one. No one knew who exactly his birth parents were, though there were rumors his mother was fourteen, and his father was from Italy. In Northern England, he spent much of his time moving from town to town and living an isolating existence. Here he would take his first photographs of birds on the lawn only for the film to come back developed so dark he could hardly make out the birds. Like these first photographs, Young’s life developed with areas blotted by abandonment. The lack of a personal or even a shared history has left him free to explore dreams and fantasies of sometimes better, sometimes harsher worlds. That yearning has resulted in a body of work that is an uncompromising, intimate love letter addressed to these vast reaches, which, with every passing inscription, are revealed to be rich, wild frontiers.\n\nWith few prospects other than working in the factory towns, Young lied about his age to attend art college at the age of fifteen. Had he not done so, he would have most likely moved to the streets of London and died. He moved to the capital five years later and caught the attention of photographer Christos Raftopoulos, whom he assisted for several years. Raftopoulos introduced Young to another side of himself, building him his own darkroom, taking him to the opera, showing him the limits of his life did not need to confine him or his work. It was during this time—still rough in nature and occasionally homeless—he photographed the early gigs of Bauhaus, R.E.M., and The Smiths. His innate eye for movement landed him photoshoots for magazines and eventually his first record sleeve cover for the 1986 album Faith by George Michael.\n\nYoung continued to photograph celebrities and direct music videos, eventually leading him to the United States. The rock star aesthetic he had brandished in his photography lent itself to his earliest screen prints that followed in the 2000s. His first series, Pig Portraits, shown in Los Angeles in 2003, collected the infamous mugshots (real and staged) of celebrities awash in fame and monochrome but also restrained as a result of their actions. In his following series, Dirty Pretty Things, he began to incorporate his popular use of diamond dust. The glam shots of cultural icons, glittering in pulverized diamonds, embodied the lusts and aspirations of their eras.\n\nRevealing the technical complexity, design, and intricate engineering of the mechanical – Nick’s work is a classic example of the fusion between science and art. He messes with dangerous radiation emitting x-ray machines to create beguilingly beautiful and incredibly detailed x-ray artworks. These are not the x-rays we are used to seeing in hospitals but amazingly complex creations that take months, if not years to create. It is common for Nick to use hundreds of separate x-rays to create large scale works. His process is painstaking and extremely unusual (not many artists have a radiation proof concrete bunker for a studio!). This is art that is at once engaging and ,upon closer inspection, dramatically revealing. There is a lot to discover in Nick’s work. The overriding pervading message is that society’s obsession with superficiality and materialism pales into insignificance compared to the importance of what we, and the world around us, is really made of. It’s what on the inside that counts.\n\nWe live in a world obsessed with image. What we look like, what our clothes look like, houses, cars… I like to counter this obsession with superficial appearance by using x-rays to strip back the layers and show what it is like under the surface. Often the integral beauty adds intrigue to the familiar. We all make assumptions based on the external visual aspects of what surrounds us and we are attracted to people and forms that are aesthetically pleasing. I like to challenge this automatic way that we react to just physical appearance by highlighting the, often surprising, inner beauty.\n\nThis society of ours, consumed as it is by image, is also becoming increasingly controlled by security and surveillance. Take a flight, or go into a high profile courtroom, and your belongings will be x-rayed. The post arriving in corporations and government departments has often been x-rayed. Security cameras track our every move. Mobile phone receptions place us at any given time. Information is key to the fight against whatever we are meant to be fighting against. To create art with equipment and technology designed to help big brother delve deeper, to use some of that fancy complicated gadgetry that helps remove the freedom and individuality in our lives, to use that apparatus to create beauty brings a smile to my face.\n\nWorks by Nick Veasey are currently displayed in the following museum collections:\n\nDeutches Roentgen Museum Remscheid, Germany\n\nMuseum Villa Rot Burgrieden, Germany\n\nScience and Technology Museum Milan, Italy\n\nNatural History Museum Tring, UK\n\nNational Media Museum Yorkshire, UK\n\nVictoria & Albert Museum London, UK\n\nAMOREPACIFIC Museum of Art Gyeonggi-do, Korea\n\nFort Wayne Museum of Art Fort Wayne, IN, USA\n\nMASS MoCA North Adams, MA, USA\n\nMusée de Design et D’Arts Appliqués Contemporains (MUDAC) Lausanne, Switzerland\n\nMuseum of Contemporary Art Taipei, Taiwan\n\nMuseum of Contemporary Art San Francisco, USA\n\nThe story of a talent started after the fall of the Berlin Wall.

Curious about the psychological aspects of the interaction that occurs between a photographer and his sitter during a photo session, he decided to base his M.A. thesis on that subject, and spent several months in Niger, Africa taking photographs of isolated tribes that had never or very rarely been exposed to the medium. For this project, he received many prominent awards and grants including La Bourse de l’aventure with Fujicolor and the Humanity Photo Award with UNESCO.\n\nBadessi started his career in Paris and continued working abroad before moving to the United States in the early 90s.\n\nAfter spending ten years focusing on the human figure, his work SKIN, was compiled in a book of the same name internationally released in 2000 by Edition Stemmle. The book contains a foreword written by Sondra Gilman, Founder and Chairperson of the photography committee at the Whitney Museum.\n\nHe uses symbolism, mythology, historical and cultural references to create his images. His work often addresses subtle and relevant questions on social, political, and cultural issues, such as the relationship with religion, war or the environment.\n\nBadessi’s photographs are part of many important private and public collections. He has received several prestigious awards, including a grant from the French Department of Cultural Affairs for his Paris show Métamorphoses. A large-scale photograph from his series Age of Innocence was recently exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery in London for the prestigious Taylor Wessing Photographic Portrait Prize.\n\nThe book Age of Innocence has been released this spring by Editions Images Plurielles. Solo and group shows of his work have taken place around the world in major cities worldwide.\n\nMichael Callas doesn’t live a Bohemian lifestyle. He is not the archetypal Romantic artist in the studio, maniacally laboring away and working in erratic ways to keep normal out at all costs. His methodology is premeditated (industrious as his artists friends tend to note), operating within an orderly studio that leaves no material out of line. Whereas some artists excel in sporadicity, Callas thrives in structure, ignited by his engineering and carpentry background. Rather than centering his craft around the finished product, he utilizes the active nature of the creation process as his muse.\n\nIn the primordial stages of his career, Callas recalls being so focused on completing the task at hand instead of enjoying each step of creation. He thought adherence to structure made him less of an artist, unable to fit the public eye’s perception of an artist. He quickly resented that outlook on his artistry and shifted his mindset towards a more appreciative view of the creation process: calculated, savoring the act of culmination and stressing executive function.\n\nCallas’ relationship to education catalyzed his view of the creative process through an executive function lens: ritualistic and rigid with confined parameters. Growing up with a learning disability, Callas struggled with maintaining focus while reading and completing tasks, the severity of which drove his mom to earn her Ph.D in Special Education to decipher what would make her son tick. Reflecting on this adversity years later, his philosophy is that one’s practice should be conducted under the paradigm of repetition, which helps him complete goals. Contrasting his current self against who he was 15 years ago, the efficiency he operates with now renders him wholly different from that previous persona, evolving from an upcoming artist to a well-established savant.\n\nThe way Michael Callas operates is deeply rooted in the concept of planned communities. Born and raised in Orange County, he was fascinated with them, always living in these premeditated templates of suburbia. Their repetitive nature subconsciously had an effect on his artistry, often producing the same silhouette of a painting with an altered color scheme.\n\nCompartmentalization is what most aptly describes him. Confined shapes, no gradation or bleeding between colors, a contrarian to traditionalist oil paintings. Architecture is a vehicle of expression he closely identifies with as evidenced in his interior-centric collection featuring Winter Living Room II and Kitchen I.\n\nBecause Callas came into the realm of fine art in a self-proclaimed ignorant way, bursting in the door rather than carefully stepping through it, influence generally evaded his stylistic evolution; despite this circumnavigation of a typical artist’s path, he appreciates the ethos of the Renaissance, where the artist is simultaneously the scientist, creator and engineer. This philosophy is apparent with artists he admires like Michelangelo, Bronzino, Botticelli. In his own work, he draws parallels to Warhol and Lichtenstein, pop art contemporaries who take a curatorial approach to their subject matter as well as David Hockney with his attention to color and composition.\n\nSince his pivotal Case Study series, Callas has continued to grow into his painting style, exhibiting a more refined technicality and fluency. New technology took his ideation process from traditional paper and pen to digital, from an opaque projector with a magnifying glass to a 4k projector alongside an iPad Pro, which increased the specificity of color choice, level of detail on shapes and layer separation.\n\n“It took a really long time to make the work truly represent who I was, attempting to minimize the influence of who I wanted to be seen as. The artistic process is genuinely who I am. I know that the audience is extremely intelligent and I want them to see me honestly through my work.”\n\nHe acknowledges there is a dialogue, however indirect, between the artist and the audience, and to act like an artist is above that, in a vacuum with no real-world impact, is disingenuous and not why people become an artist.\n\nMichael Callas wants to be remembered like Walt Disney, a virtuoso known for the complexity of their craft and whose work blossoms into multiple fields outside of their promoted practice. He’s always striving to improve, become more complex and execute ideas more cleanly, essentially hiding the human hand and leaving the audience with the firm belief that this work was made by machine.\n\nRock Therrien draws his ideas from everyday life, music, and memories of his childhood. As he seeks to capture the viewer’s attention through the subject of his work and his palette of colours, his explosively vibrant works are always lined with a touch of humor. His latest production focuses on universal icons: cartoons. These timeless characters, known and loved by young and old people alike, provide a feeling of cheerfulness, inevitably reminding the viewer of their own childhood memories. A superposition of collages, repetitive patterns made with stencils and various writings adorn the background. The works of Rock Therrien have significant texture and depth that make the viewer smile with nostalgic humor. The artist likes to hint at the process of construction of his compositions and his sketches.\n\nOften illuminated with colourful neon integrated into the work, his recent works are part of a pop and modern spirit. His works are presented as missives, inviting the viewer to decode them. Rock Therrien considers each of his paintings as carrying a story, an independent message. We are invited to approach his work in many ways, as he provides the viewer with a multitude of clues, to be discovered as we browse the canvas.\n\nBorn in 1970 in Armagh, Quebec, Rock Therrien has been attracted to art from an early age. He trained himself to master visual arts, thanks to a true love for creation. His works are found today in several private and public collections around the world. He lives and works in the heart of the Laurentians region.\n\nAfter 20 years of painting in the streets around the world, Mateo has studied and used the art of ornamentation in most of his works. From walls to ceramics, fabrics and rugs, patterns blend into the paintings creating a cohesive bridge between his street and gallery work.\n\nMateo has always been captivated by the power of transcribing emotion or thought into an image. For him, creative activities are essential for personal growth and development. At 23, he earned a Master’s degree in Fine Arts from Toulouse and wrote a thesis on “Perception and our 5 Senses” before moving to Montreal, where he specialized in graphic design and art direction. He worked for four years for major brands such as Ubisoft, Cirque du Soleil and SidLee, before choosing to avoid any commercial work. In parallel, he freely developed his artistic style on the streets.\n\nIn 2015, during an artist residency in Barcelona, he became interested in traditional ceramic tiles that are seen everywhere in Spain and Portugal. He began incorporating these designs into his street murals, marking the beginning of the integration of traditional crafts into his work. Similar to carpets, ceramic tiles are used to decorate the floors of houses, and Mateo transposed them onto the walls of the city.\n\nIn the city, Mateo’s inspiration adorns walls with ethnic patterns and vivid, contrasting portraits. In his studio, the artist experiments with different materials and supports, until one day, he paints on a carpet – an unimaginable support for a painter. He imagine the symmetry of a face that reflected in the symmetry of the carpet. His first artwork on a carpet was displayed at the Mural Art Fair in Montreal in 2017. With his alternative spirit, Mateo found a way to hang his artwork on an unused wall of the fair, without being represented by any galleries, and the artwork had an astonish effect on the audience and galleries. In the following days, Mateo was inundated with proposals from galleries who wanted to exhibit his work. It was the moment for him to enter the art world.\n\nRock Therrien draws his ideas from everyday life, music, and memories of his childhood.

He lives and works in the heart of the Laurentians region.\n\nPhilippe Shangti is a complete artist with an extraordinary talent to transcribe his art pieces into scenic performances totally imagined by him. Thus he directs the full artistic conception by creating his own universe. Among his notorious pieces, he signed several ‘tag’ works such as the very famous “Enjoy Your Fucking Dinner”.\n\nHis art comes in a variety of photographs, artistic concepts but also in limited edition sculptures. His work is exhibited in many countries in the best art galleries in Europe and the USA.\n\nConstantly looking for new ideas and challenges, the artist also created special works featuring sports personalities, collectors and their families. In addition, he collaborates with many luxury brands as part of the development of a range of products steeped with his art and his universe.\n\nWith his experience, the artist organizes ephemeral private events on the international scene where he manages to recreate the artistic atmosphere he is immersed in, in order to carry the visitors away and intensely connect them to his artistic world.\n\nAfter living in St Tropez for more than 10 years, the artist wished to upgrade his career and decided to move his studios and all his teams to the Principality of Andorra where he experiences now a new energy.\n\nIn 2019, Philippe Shangti has been selected to represent the Principality of Andorra at the 58th Venice Biennale.\n\nHis monumental and highly committed project “Future Is Now” aims to demonstrate that the behaviour of people today irreversibly determines tomorrow’s world. Here again, the message is clear: to change human consciousness and behaviour by shaking up the values and priorities of our societies.\n\nThe international press and the art world have ranked the Andorran pavilion – and Philippe’s work “The Future Is Now” – among the 10 essential pavilions of this Biennale.\n\nFrom July 2020 to September 2021, his exhibition “Future is now”, realized for the 2019 Venice Biennale, was shown at the Museum of Fine Arts of Carcassonne, France, marking the first museum exhibition of the artist’s career.\n\nFrom March to July 2021, the Erarta Museum of Contemporary Art in Saint Petersburg Russia, organized an exhibition of some thirty works by the artist, mixing various artworks from different collections.\n\nAfter studying language and communication sciences at Université des Lettres d’Avignon, Badessi enrolled in a photography course at Université Paris VIII. Curious about the psychological aspects of the interaction that occurs between a photographer and his sitter during a photo session, he decided to base his M.A. thesis on that subject, and spent several months in Niger, Africa taking photographs of isolated tribes that had never or very rarely been exposed to the medium. For this project, he received many prominent awards and grants including La Bourse de l’aventure with Fujicolor and the Humanity Photo Award with UNESCO.\n\nBadessi started his career in Paris and continued working abroad before moving to the United States in the early 90s.\n\nAfter spending ten years focusing on the human figure, his work SKIN, was compiled in a book of the same name internationally released in 2000 by Edition Stemmle. The book contains a foreword written by Sondra Gilman, Founder and Chairperson of the photography committee at the Whitney Museum.\n\nHe uses symbolism, mythology, historical and cultural references to create his images. His work often addresses subtle and relevant questions on social, political, and cultural issues, such as the relationship with religion, war or the environment.\n\nBadessi’s photographs are part of many important private and public collections. He has received several prestigious awards, including a grant from the French Department of Cultural Affairs for his Paris show Métamorphoses. A large-scale photograph from his series Age of Innocence was recently exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery in London for the prestigious Taylor Wessing Photographic Portrait Prize.\n\nThe book Age of Innocence has been released this spring by Editions Images Plurielles. Solo and group shows of his work have taken place around the world in major cities worldwide.\n\nThe story of a talent started after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Through his striking symbolism Michael Moebius gives a new dimension to popular cultural icons, adding brightly colored gum bubbles to monochrome portraits and creating a new way of communicating emotions.\n\nMichael Moebius came into the world in 1968, in Germany. Having developed a love for art at an early age, cartooning became his first passion. However, in the then-communist East Germany, more pragmatic pursuits were the order of the day. Art would have to be put on the back burner while a formal education was pursued, and Michael decided on a career in engineering and construction. It was during a stint working in a parallel field of architectural illustration that Michael happened upon a book featuring the pin-ups of Alberto Vargas. A new love affair took root, and Michael decided that figurative art would be his life’s work.\n\nHe started studying painting at the academy of arts in Dresden, and in 1998 he got a big breakthrough. It was at this time, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, that Michel was able to make his way to the United States. His talent as a painter and photographer was readily apparent, and he quickly became a sought-after favorite of collectors. Michael has already been part of major exhibitions throughout the US. His collector base and publishers include Playboy, Procter & Gamble, Laura Biagiotti, Vogue, Vanity Fair, Superyacht Digest, and other well-known companies.\n\nHis work has also won attention from celebrities including Mel Gibson, Paris Hilton, Hugh Hefner, Rihanna, David Guetta and KISS frontman Gene Simmons.\n\nMichael Moebius shows a huge talent when it comes to turning pop art and popular culture on its head. Today, Moebius has become one of the most recognized and in-demand contemporary artists in the world. His now famous bubble gum portraits have become a favorite among interior designers and investors the world over thanks to their striking symbolism.\n\nUnlike his gum bubbles, the artist’s value continues to expand and shows no sign of bursting. Moebius’ commercial abilities and partnerships with some of the world’s most popular names means that he is a serious name in the art investment world.\n\nMost famously, Michael Moebius gives a new dimension to popular cultural icons, adding brightly colored gum bubbles to monochrome portraits. Marilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth have all been re-imagined in this style, up to his latest work (“All you need is gum”) where he depicts the four Beatles all with signature gum bubbles.\n\nIn terms of artistic influences, Moebius cites inspiration from Italian Renaissance artist Titian and the genius baroque Caravaggio, as well as more contemporary names such as Andy Warhol, Pablo Picasso and Alberto Vargas.\n\nHis novel portrayal of much-featured subjects make Moebius’ bubblegum works of an art investment favorite. His art also acts as a window into his personality and creative vision.\n\nWhat’s most interesting is the contrast between the communist ideals which influenced the artist (Michael was born in 1968 when Germany was still divided in two by the Berlin Wall) and the western values and popular culture.\n\nMoebius became aware of cultural differences between his home and the rest of the world, and this incongruity plays a significant role in his art today.\n\n“Almost all of the items which we received from the west part of the world such as magazines, toys, soda cans were forbidden in east Berlin. As a child and growing up I would dearly hold onto the then-forbidden items… these really influenced me with their colors, designs and scents.\n\nThe more Michael Moebius was pushed to conform with communist ideals, the more he became enamored with western popular culture, and the more he was driven to create. After his conscription in the East German army, and then the fall of the Berlin Wall, he travelled to the US to dedicate his life entirely to art.\n\nBorn in 1971 in San Bernardino, California and raised in the Atlanta area, Craig first recognized his creative drive via crayons on his parents’ walls, like many inspired young artists, and by the age of 7 his capacity for detailed visual interpretation became undeniable. After excelling in an introductory drawing class in school, Craig continued to develop technically and conceptually through his own diligent studies while always planning to pursue a formal art education.\n\nHe accepted a soccer scholarship at the University of Mobile, AL along with 3 summer art classes and in the first, Pottery, Craig’s light bulb switched on in a rejuvenating glow. Learning became enjoyable from that point forward in his life and he was immediately thrust into the scholastic limelight. To help sustain his education he found financial support and enjoyment in driving to New Orleans on his weekends and creating portr"
