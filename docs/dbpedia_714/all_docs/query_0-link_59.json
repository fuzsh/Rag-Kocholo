        "text": "The Arizona Commission on the Arts, an agency of the State of Arizona, has awarded $5,000 Research and Development Grants to 31 artists throughout the state. Awarded through a competitive application and review process, Research & Development (R&D) Grants support Arizona artists as they work to advance their artistic practice, expand their creative horizons, and deepen the impact of their work. This year, thanks to a new public-philanthropic partnership between the state agency and the Arizona Community Foundation (ACF), and through funding from the Newton and Betty Rosenzweig Fund for the Arts, the number of available awards more than doubled, from 15 to 31.\n\nGrantees represent a variety of artistic disciplines and reside in communities throughout the state. Funded projects include a four-mile long mural, a children’s book about transracial adoption, a celebration of women in Jazz, and an experimental fusion of breaking and the Colombian social dance style known as Cumbia.\n\n2019 Artist Research and Development Grant Recipients\n\nClick here for details on the artists and their projects\n\nIn addition to the Artist Research and Development Grant, the Arts Commission presented the Bill Desmond Writing Award, which offers funding in the amount of $1,000 to an excelling nonfiction writer. The recipient is selected from the pool of applicants for Research and Development Grants and a single applicant may be awarded both. The award was established by Kathleen Desmond in honor of her late husband, Bill Desmond, a reporter, editor, and nonfiction writer.\n\n2019 Bill Desmond Writing Award Recipient\n\nRenee Angle (Tucson)\n\nApplications were reviewed by a diverse and distinguished panel of Arizona residents:\n\n2019 Artist Research and Development Grant Review Panel\n\nFelipa Lerma (Peoria), Artist & Artistic Director of Comun Teatro\n\nLaura Maher (Tucson), Writer, Instructor at the University of Arizona Poetry Center and Major Gifts & Grants Officer at Arizona Public Media\n\nJacob Meders (Phoenix), Artist & Faculty at Arizona State University\n\nYvonne Montoya (Tucson), Choreographer & Director of Safos Dance Theater\n\nMilta Ortiz (Tucson), Playwright & Marketing and Outreach Director at Borderlands Theater\n\nChristina Park (Phoenix), Artist & Senior Coordinator for the Initiative for Creativity, Place and Equitable Communities at the Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts\n\nChristian Ramirez (Tempe), Public Programs Manager at Phoenix Art Museum\n\nJenea Sanchez (Douglas), Artist & Founder and Director of Border Arts Corridor\n\nAfter reviewing and scoring applications individually, the panelists convened for a public meeting at the Arts Commission’s office in downtown Phoenix to discuss top-scoring applications and make recommendations for funding.

This year, the Arizona Community Foundation matched state funding allocated to the Research & Development Grant program dollar-for-dollar.\n\n“Arizona artists contribute such value to their communities, including the many ways they provide leadership through creativity, skill, inquiry, and ingenuity,” said Jaime Dempsey, Executive Director of the Arts Commission. “We are so grateful for ACF’s partnership, which has meant that together we can encourage and expand support for the critical research and development phase of artists’ work.”\n\n“The Newton and Betty Rosenzweig Fund for the Arts has provided ACF with a great opportunity to invest in Arizona artists, in partnership with the Arizona Commission on the Arts. These artists are critical to growing and supporting the creative economy of our state, said Steve Seleznow, President and CEO of the Arizona Community Foundation. “Each of these 31 artists represents a distinctive voice and a unique point of view. Together, they are united through their pursuit of artistic excellence and commitment to community service through their creative expression.

A veteran of live performances of mixed musical styles over the years in the Denver and Phoenix areas, she also experienced the thrills and chills of travel working on a cruise ship, several DOD tours, hotels, and resorts. After years of working behind vocalists in all these venues she decided to never look back and create concerts where musicians could thrive and learn new music. This idea soon morphed into arranging and performing, and therefore supporting, the many women jazz musicians who compose and perform this music but never reach the name recognition of many men.\n\nBijoyini Chatterjee\n\nProject Description\n\nFilmmaker Bijoyini Chatterjee’s R&D Grant will support the video documentation of a five-week-long creative journey of an international group of dance artists as they reinterpret a 1,000 year-old Sufi poem into a 90-minute evening-length dance performance.\n\nArtist Bio\n\nBijoyini Chatterjee is a filmmaker, photographer, and dancer and is the co-founder of Onirica Productions. Born and brought up in India, she came to the Boston (MA) to study software engineering but a near fatal car accident at the age of 27 served as a catalyst for change.

Corman’s R&D Grant will further assist with his efforts to exhibit his sculptures and demonstrate his materials and techniques.\n\nArtist Bio\n\nGreg Corman divides his time between two passions, sculpture and landscape design. His art work reincarnates discarded steel and wood to create objects in both the decorative and functional realms. He works to maintain as much patina and history as possible, for the “stories” evoked by the materials, either real or as products of the viewers’ imaginations, can add great appeal to a sculpture. His approach is mostly intuitive and exploratory, building from existing materials in a process that is sometimes gratifying, sometimes frustrating, but results in one-off abstract pieces reflecting a range of emotions. The compositions are often influenced by plant life and natural elements of the desert which are constants in his other work as a botanist and landscape designer.\n\nCorman’s horticultural and design experience spans nearly three decades in the desert regions of Australia, Saudi Arabia, and Arizona. He is the owner of Gardening Insights, Inc., an award winning landscape design and consulting firm in Tucson which specializes in ecological gardens and wildlife habitat landscapes.\n\nIt’s the nexus of these passions that he finds most interesting and his sculptures that incorporate native bee nesting habitats can be found in the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum, the Phoenix Zoo, Boyce Thompson Arboretum, Tohono Chul, the Tucson Botanical Gardens, and other public spaces.\n\nWesley Fawcett Creigh\n\nProject Description\n\nWesley Fawcett Creigh’s R&D Grant will fund the animation and installation phases of an ambitous multi-disciplinary work called Love in the Time of Migra, depicting the personal stories of binational couples whose relationships “straddle the line” of the US/Mexico border.\n\nArtist Bio\n\nWesley Fawcett Creigh lives and works in Tucson, Arizona. In 2008 she completed her Bachelor’s Degree at Prescott College in the self-designed major of Public Art with an Emphasis on Social Impact. Since this time she has produced artworks as an individual, as a member of artist collectives, and as a scenic designer for performance collaborations. Her work aims to bring the arts into community spaces, foster a sense of creative place making, and bring overlooked issues into the forefront of a broader community dialogue.\n\nMost recently, she has employed animation and multi-media installation for her artwork and received numerous grant awards in 2016 for an animation and installation project that examines the complexity of violence on the US/Mexico border. This project, entitled “Of Rocks and Bullets: An Animated Discourse” has been included in exhibitions at Exploded View MicroCinema, Museo de Arte Nogales, MOCA Tucson, and Yavapai College. Her experimental video work, “Prototype”, was screened at MOCA Tucson in November 2017. “Prototype” also received an official selection into the WomenCinemakers Biennale in 2018 and the Sharjah Film Platform in 2019. She has been awarded grants and residencies from organizations such as the Arts Foundation for Tucson and Southern Arizona, The Puffin Foundation, Arizona Commission on the Arts, Springboard for the Arts, and Santa Fe Art Institute.\n\nMel Dominguez\n\nProject Description\n\nWith their R&D Grant, Mel Dominguez will focus on strengthening their skills as a printmaker, sculptor, and welder while experimenting with new processes of block printing, etching, and silk screening. These skills and techniques will allow the artist to better reproduce their work and realize more ambitious visions for public art installations built from both new and recycled materials.\n\nArtist Bio\n\nMel “Melo” Dominguez is an artist, muralist from Los Angeles who has lived in Tucson since 2007.
