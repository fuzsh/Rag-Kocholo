        "text": "McKimson seems to be more in the vein of a \"meat and potatoes\" director, like Friz Freleng. While he had his own characters and themes he liked to work with, he wasn't necessarily a very individualistic or stylish director -- in fact his early cartoons seem very similar in style to Clampett's cartoons! He was not an innovator like Avery, Clampett and Tashlin were, nor was he as idiosyncratic as Jones and, again, Clampett were.\n\nMcKimson's best cartoons are those from early in his career, in my opinion. In particular, cartoons like DAFFY DOODLES, ONE MEAT BRAWL, ACROBATTY BUNNY, BIRTH OF A NOTION, A-LAD-IN HIS LAMP, EASTER YEGGS, HILLBILLY HARE, GORILLA MY DREAMS, etc. Even by the early fifties, before he lost his entire team of animators, the animation in McKimson's cartoons started to look dull and the staging became flatter. McKimson didn't take advantage of Rod Scribner's strength's as an animator the way Clampett did, nor did he develop a style of animation that worked well with the more restrictive budgets of the post war years the way Chuck Jones did.\n\nThe cartoons McKimson directed after the post 1953 shutdown look shabby in comparison to the other directors' output, and his cartoons weren't as funny, either. Some of this was beyong the control of McKimson. Office politics ensured he got Pierce as a writer, and he had the weaker animators working for his at that time. But had McKimson been a stronger director he might have overcome these limitations and produced cartoons that were at least witty and entertaining, if somewhat crude in the animation. After all, Avery's and Clampett's cartoons of the 30's worked with such strictures and they were still hilarious despite them. (And Avery's cartoons for Lantz were funny and had exaggerated animation poses despite limited budgets.)\n\nDaffysleftfoot said:\n\nI've already given a spiel about Mr. McKimson in this thread. And my question there still hasn't been fully answered really.\n\nI never thought of McKimson as an \"auteur\". I think directors like Tex Avery, Bob Clampett, Frank Tashlin, Chuck Jones, John Hubley, Bob Cannon, Walt Disney (although not always as a director but more as a producer) and maybe Friz Freleng and the team of Bill Hanna & Joe Barbera as falling under the auteur theory of filmmaking. Definitely Winsor McKay and Otto Messmer were the primary creative forces behind their cartoons. (McKay was the only creative force in the making of his cartoons, in fact.) I would even consider Gene Deitch to be an auteur before I would think of McKimson as one.\n\nDirectors like Robert McKimson, Hugh Harmon, Rudy Ising, Bob Wickersham, Dick Lundy, and Shamus Culhane seem more like talented craftsmen to me. I think they worked with the material they were given in a very professional manner, but they couldn't really be considered the primary creative force behind their cartoons. That had a lot to do with the writers and animators they had to work with. They didn't think up their own gags in the way that Tex Avery, Frank Tashlin, Otto Messmer or Joe Barbera did. They didn't use their animators to achieve a more personal style of animation as did Clampett, Jones, Hubley and Cannon. Innovators like Disney, Messmer and Avery broke new ground in the animated cartoon and were imitated for years. The Fleischers created technical innovations and Tashlin introduced cinimatic techniques to animated cartoons. While directors such as McKimson crafted solid, well-made entertainment with very little stylistic flourishes and without breaking any new ground.\n\nNo, not the Geseundheit!\n\nI actually idolize Robert McKimson, because he and I shared the same style of drawing - no preliminary sketching or guidelines, just placing everything right where it needs to be.\n\nPersonally, I think he's a sensational director. Watching the Golden Collection over and over, I developed new appreciations for \"What's Up, Doc?\", \"Rabbit's Kin\", \"Boobs in the Woods\", \"The Foghorn Leghorn\", \"Early to Bet\", \"Devil May Hare\", and yes, even \"A Broken Leghorn\", which certainly has its moments (\"Three, two, one, oh...oh!\", \"Pull harder! Harder! Har..dee har har...\"). I still say \"Early to Bet\" has some of the best writing, animation, music, and voice acting in any Warner short.\n\nProbably one of McKimson's best was just on CN this morning, \"Leghorn Swoggled\". Lots of inter-character play, hilarious gags, and some great writing (\"If I give the cat a fish, I get a dog...no, the fish gets a bone...no, wait, the cat wants some cheese...no, the mouse wants cheese! Gee, I wonder what the cheese will want.\").\n\nMr. McKimson\n\nI almost hate to say this, but I find McKimson's cartoons to be either \"hits\" or \"misses\"- it seems like there's really no intermediate cartoons, which is odd... because you'd think that a director's style would uphold some sort of consistency.\n\nWhen they're hits, they're really hits- like some of my favourites, \"Easter Yeggs\", \"The Foghorn Leghorn\", \"Rebel Rabbit\", \"Hurdy Gurdy Hare\", \"It's Hummertime\", \"Hilbilly Hare\", \"A Fractured Leghorn\", \"Pop 'Im Pop\", \"Corn Plastered\", \"Who's Kitten Who\", \"The Turn-Tale Wolf\", \"Cat-Tails For Two\", \"No Parking Hare\"..... I find McKimson's cartoons seemed to want to come across with intelligent humour and well-thought-out gags. I feel he had a great track record when using one-shot characters as well- he could develop them for viewers to get to know them on top of working in a plot, all in a 7-minute cartoon. Probably due to his experience in animation/draftsmanship, all his cartoons seem very precisely laid out visually- characters are well-staged, action is well-timed, and scenes are not usually too \"busy\". I also find his character designs make all his players very sturdy-looking and solid. Good thing he had Scribner and Hawkins (for a while) to really give these heavy-looking characters a bit of cartoon \"surreality\".\n\nOn the other hand, when his cartoons are \"misses\", they're pretty weak, like some of my least-liked McKimson cartoons- \"The Upstanding Sitter\", \"The Shell-Shocked Egg\", \"A HorseFly Fleas\", \"Dog Collared\", \"Dr. Devil and Mr. Hare\"..... it seems as if he was trying too hard to illicit a laugh, but at the same time thinking that the laugh had to be more intelligent than a pie-in-the-face (I wonder how much \"Ham In A Role\" reflected how McKimson felt about the cartoon industry in general....?). Sometimes his writing seemed somewhat restrained- like he was trying to bridle his own creativity just to make a humour in a different vein.\n\nMcKimson's cartoons were heavily dependant on strong stories by the early 1950s, which meent that when he got weak struff from his writers, there's just weren't any imaginative little touches to bail out weak cartoons. As Leonard Maltin inferred in his book, the worst of Bob's output feel like better made and more polished versions of Paul J. Smith's cartoons for Lantz, in that there's a stiffness to the cartoons and a forced feeling to the plots.\n\nGetting Sid Marcus to split time as story writer with Tedd Pierce helped McKimson a lot between 1953-55, and despite lower-quality animation, the studio shutdown and reopening seemed to have provided a lift to his work in the 1955-57 period (getting some stories out of Warren Foster and Michael Maltese during this period also was a plus). But Bob's cartoons from 1958-62 really slipped into verbal talkfests that, with only a few exceptions, were pretty uninspired (on the other hand, his cartoons in the final few years of the original stduio's operations slipped less than Jones' and Freleng's work did, since the losses of Maltese and Foster hurt them in the long run more than the loss of Pierce hurt McKimson).\n\nFor what it is worth, Larry T.'s right about McKimson and one-shotters..(or short lived series..)\n\n[Just a few...]\n\nThe gambling bug\n\nThe hummingbird\n\nThat cat and dog who part time appeared with them\n\nDodsworth the cat (voiced by Sheldon Leonard just as he was going from acting to producing)\n\nand let's not forget the beany-capped crow and farmer...\n\nI actually believe that McKimson was the BEST director of the fifties, and Jones had the best looking cartoons and the two best series (Pepe LePew and Roadsrunner--that's one area regarding Jones that Bigshot and I DISAGREE on--Pepe certainly influenced Chuck to do that GAY PURR-EE toon wioth cats, at UPA...) and Friz had the best SINGLE cartoon, in his latter years (FROM HARE TO HJEIR, the funniest ever just in the whole \"If ya blow your top you blow your dough\", 1960..). )Overall, McKimson had consistently the best stories, and his version of Daffy even when he became the (expletive delted) jerk still had lines loike (to Bugs Bunny in PEOPLE ARE BUNNY,1959) \"Blanks he says\"(after Bugs denies the lethal impact of the shotguns in the TV studio therein) \"Have a HANDFUL of blanks..geesh\"..Nromally I'm not a big fan of CJ or FF's use of this Daffy.\n\nMcKimson, thnough, was ruined (by the EXEC here,not himself, as directing as such no longer seemed to exist outside Clokey and Hanna Barbera by the middle 1960s) by having to work with the Speedy Gonzales/Daffy Duck team..\n\nAnd let's not forget the STAR McKimson characters..\n\nIn chronological order please..\n\nFoghorn Leghorn and Barnyard Dog (Jones created the other adversary Henry Hawk)\n\nHippety Hopper, the young kangaroo eternally taken for a giant mouse\n\nSylvester Jr.\n\nAnd of course the later Foghorn supporting cast-[Miss] Prissy the Hen (orig.in a McKimson 1950 Porky Pig,AN EGG SCRAMBLE-that, like some others by all the directors during this periodis one odd duck, and I don't mean Daffy, in mixiing 1) animals who play \"animal\" parts-e.g.Prissy, 2) animals who play \"people\" parts-e.g.Porky Pig, and 3) humans who play Human parts-e.g.that housewife who sees \"Prissy's\"(It's actually another hen's egg,laid as a joke on her) egg)..BTW I think I'll continue that last thought el;sewhere..\n\nWhen McKimson died, around 1976 (b.1910), there was little attention - whoops I mean, NO attention whatsoever given him -- andf even Jones was lucky.Now things of course are different, even McKimson'\n\ns sons rose to spread the ethos of their uniqely talented dad.\n\nLarry T said:\n\nOn the other hand, when his cartoons are \"misses\", they're pretty weak, like some of my least-liked McKimson cartoons- \"The Upstanding Sitter\", \"The Shell-Shocked Egg\", \"A HorseFly Fleas\", \"Dog Collared\", \"Dr. Devil and Mr. Hare\"..... it seems as if he was trying too hard to illicit a laugh, but at the same time thinking that the laugh had to be more intelligent than a pie-in-the-face (I wonder how much \"Ham In A Role\" reflected how McKimson felt about the cartoon industry in general....?). Sometimes his writing seemed somewhat restrained- like he was trying to bridle his own creativity just to make a humour in a different vein.\n\nEven though I like \"The Up-Standing Sitter\", which has good gags even though that chick is a bit annoying, \"A Horsefly Fleas\", which is not that funny, but memorable and \"Dog Collared\", good but weird gags, especially the talking dog. I see your point.\n\n\"The Shell Shocked Egg\", while a decent cartoon, seems to be a bit heavey handed in the story and lightly handed in the gags, a good example is the cow golfing Clem's egg. I never thought that was funny.\n\n\"Dr. Devil And Mr. Hare\" is just awful though. The gags are very badly timed and embarassing at the same time, and what was with the ending? Completely stupid and lame."
