        "text": "Claire Kim is a junior at Columbia College majoring in Computer Science. A Korean-American multidisciplinary artist, Claire fancies creative direction, styling and makeup, and production design. As diverse as her artistic interests are her inspirations (furniture, sculpture, and interior design), her academic interests (sociology, computer science, math), and mediums (film, music video, fashion show). I’m sure there are a couple more I’m missing.\n\nWhile waiting for Claire at Blue Bottle Coffee on Broadway, I suddenly worried. “Do I remember what she looked like?” While familiar with the faces of the models she’s worked with, I was less familiar with the face of the one behind the camera, behind the styling.\n\nThis worry quickly dissipated. Coming in with black clothes—not a Hamlet, these are “the suits of woe” black but a rather sophisticated, inviting black. Claire recognized me and came over to my temporary corner in Blue Bottle. She had a hot matcha latte with such latte art on top that could excuse the Blue Bottle price tag. Her enthusiastic smile made it easy to converse with someone of her magnitude—not just an artist, but an artist in many different areas. In a sense, a jack of all trades and yet a master of all.\n\nHowever, to describe herself, Claire often used the word “amateur.” She considers herself an amateur because art was a relatively new hobby that came out of a crisis during her sophomore year.\n\nThis crisis was a crisis of what to pursue. With the sophomore year CC major declaration deadline looming, she, at the time, was debating between computer science, sociology, and her other interests. But, in a way, this wasn’t a crisis but rather a metamorphosis into becoming the artist she is today.\n\nWhile thinking about her interests, she realized that she needed new hobbies. “Frankly, I didn’t have any hobbies, so I decided that this year I needed to do something creative.”\n\nWith this new art bug inside her, what allowed her to create art for the first time since seventh grade was a Literature Humanities assignment. “I was inspired by Dante, and I wanted to use fashion and makeup to convey symbolism that I was interested in.”\n\nWhile the project looks polished, Claire opened up about the messy process of creating art for the first time in a while. Claire had to find an empty classroom instead of a proper studio, stood on a table to get a blank wall, and didn’t edit the final results (all files were raw). It was a frenzied state of experimentation that, fortunately, ended up well. “The makeup, hair, costume - all of that - was just me. Just me in the classroom, putting shit up on my face, going to the bathroom, being stuck for seven hours.”\n\nOne of the most eye-catching visuals in this project is the one on violence. In this visual, Claire attempts to show the soul abandoning the body, which she captures through low shutter speed. In addition, what she seems to be holding is a key, a direct allusion to Pier della Vigna in Canto 12 who held the keys to his king’s heart but later committed suicide.\n\nWhile the creative process for her first art project may have been chaotic, that has changed over her artistic career. As her MBTI is an INFJ (emphasis on the J), she takes pride in “meticulously planning everything because of the type J. I like to plan everything out.”\n\nHer next project gumiho (구미호), which she was the creative director and stylist for, reflects her need-to-plan inclination. Her mood board has all the specifics of her vision laid out, as well as a Pinterest board that furthers those specifics. Her mood board was full of surrealist art, and one stand-out piece from it would be the fur cup.\n\n“I came across Méret Oppenheim’s fur cup at MoMA, and I learned more about the sculptor. She uses a lot of fur as a nod to sexuality and, recognizing that, combines fur with everyday objects to create a sense of discomfort. I was really inspired by that, so I took the idea of fur and was reminded of the gumiho myth and its themes of gender, sexuality, classism, the grotesque as well as the aesthetic.”\n\nSplitting up the themes of gumiho into the day and night, Claire played with time and duality. While directing her model, she told the model to look like a “submissive domestic housewife” for the visual for the first look (day), and, for the second look (night), the model acted more freely with the gumiho’s true identity being revealed.\n\nA completely different type of project that Claire took on recently was a fashion show. It was by far her biggest project yet. “I was working with fourteen models, five designers, two makeup artists, two styling assistants, and one personal assistant. It was a huge team, and everything was happening at the same time. Styling and makeup were happening at the same time, in the same room. It was a lengthy process.”\n\nThis project started with Claire cold emailing a bunch of Korean brands, as well as some FIT and Parson students. She also held model casting auditions. She also recalled the physical labor of putting together the show, such as picking up garments and meeting people downtown.\n\nFor this gargantuan project to come together smoothly, Claire had to plan everything meticulously. She showed me her in-depth Pinterest boards that had more in-depth Pinterest boards within them as well as a spreadsheet of the models’ info that looked more like an investment banker’s Excel sheet.\n\nA lot of the clothes, makeup, and styling featured alluded to Korean culture, probably most prominent in the clothing being reminiscent of Korean traditional clothing hanbok.\n\nWorking with a lot of people for a project is not something Claire is new to. For the film Or, A Frail Correspondence, which she served as the production designer, stylist, hair & makeup artist for, she mentioned how this film had the largest crew she’s worked with. The film uses the loss of virginity to depict themes of absence, loss, and death. “The director wanted to create a sense of limbo, a place in between spaces.\n\nWhile she wasn’t the director for this project, she was definitely able to have a large role in the creative process. “I didn’t have as much creative say over this project, but I enjoyed interpreting the director’s version, interpreting it, translating it into my ideas, and making it come into reality. One object she got to design was the chair. “I designed this chair, which I found a little funny. There’s an idea of bondage, as well as the use of strings that plays with the idea of hanging in between—again, the theme of limbo.”\n\nSimilar to My 9 Circles of Hell, there were chaotic elements of working on site the whole day. She mentioned pouring plaster and dust on an actor as well as yogurt into an actor’s mouth. The plaster was a bit of a problem though, as it elicited an allergic reaction from the actor.\n\nIt was also the first time Claire worked with a naked actor, and as she was in charge of styling and makeup, interacting with a naked actor felt different. But, due to the feeling of being on set, she’s able to set aside her personal opinions and be committed to the professional role.\n\nShe also mentioned this addicting feeling of being on set. “It’s like doing a Hackathon, and there’s a deadline. I also have ADHD and work well under time constraints. It’s kind of a challenge that I enjoy. Also, the enjoyment of focus and creating collaboratively is addicting.”\n\nAnother medium Claire often frequents is music videos. For music videos, Claire works off of the music. “The music grounds the creative process. I feel like someone’s giving me ideas, and so it’s more of a service to the musician.”\n\nAs one can tell by now, Claire has many interests and experiences. But as wide as those are her inspirations as well. Her inspirations aren’t limited to surrealist sculpture. She’s been interested in space-age furniture and interior design. “The shapes of that art inspires my creative ideas.”\n\nOne interior design she pointed out as her inspiration was the Headquarters of the French Communist Party. “They may seem like different disciplines, but they seem similar to clothing: silhouettes, textiles, material of construction. With space-age furniture, I’m mostly inspired by the silhouettes.”\n\nIn the future, Claire plans to pursue more photography and film. “I get to have the gaze rather than be the object of the gaze. It gives me a sense of power. Sometimes I see photos taken of my work, and I’m not 100% envision it. If I get to caption my work, it’ll align with how I envision it.”\n\nTo find more of Claire’s art, you can find her website and her Instagram.\n\nYimo Chong is an artist, a talented one, but above all else, he’s an activist—and nothing makes that more evident than his paintings. Despite currently working on a series of oil paintings entitled “Progress” (many of which can be seen in this article) depicting the hypocrisy bolstering that titular neoliberal narrative that’s taken both his original home of China and his current home of America by storm, Yimo’s true focus is aimed, laser-sharp, at labor advocacy writ large. A double Politics and Economics major whose academic interests are primarily focused on Latin America (he’s fluent in Spanish and even interned in Chile in 2021), Yimo’s retelling of his life is filled with anecdotes of class consciousness reckonings deserving of memoir: his anarchist awakening was in elementary school when his role as Safety Patrol (no running in the hallways, classmates!) made him question fundamental institutions of power, and he burst into tears upon turning the page of a textbook in high school and learning that Salvador Allende died. But his relationship to art is no less insightful and nuanced than his political awareness; how could it be, when the former has become, for him, almost a manifestation of the latter? For Yimo, painting is both a space separate from the rest of the world that allows him to “regain the sense of a normal life” and an active process that forces the painter to interrogate societal standards of “normalcy,” bringing about an unlearning, a denormalization, of norms themselves.\n\nWhen did you first begin to take an interest in art?\n\nIt was before primary school, I think. Instead of sending me to a really intense cram school, which is the norm in China, I was very lucky and my parents sent me to this art place, and the teacher was very nice. The moment I realized I liked art was maybe just when the teacher at one point said, like, “Oh, did you know crayons and watercolor don't mix?” And for some reason, little kid me was just, like, “Oh, my God!” My mind was blown. After that, I pretty much just stayed at that art school for a very long time—all the way until I left for the United States in high school.\n\nIs oil painting is still your medium of choice? Did you ever experiment significantly with other art forms, or primarily sketching and oil painting?\n\nThere was another period of time during primary school, and middle school, where I also learned Chinese art—this kind of Chinese watercolor thing. It was a totally different style. It didn’t matter whether things looked realistic; you were just supposed to get the vibe. t least from our home, Impressionists learned from Japanese art, and that’s why they started doing that different style in the first place. There was something, like, Daoist about it. I think there’s this sense in a lot of Chinese art that to have something, like, full is actually pretty gaudy, which is why blank space is prioritized so much. I think it’s about being content with some imperfections and actually making them part of the painting. The result is pretty calming.\n\nObviously, you mostly focus on oil painting these days but are there any remnants of this style, this mindset, that linger in your art or your artistic process even now?\n\nThe idea of keeping the important things in the forefront, of making those more detailed, and backgrounding the rest so that it is not overwhelming is still pretty relevant to my art, but more than that, my mindset AND my heart. This sentiment, and art in general, basically reminds me that I should block some time off for, essentially, empty space so that the actual important things can get the room they need. It’s mostly a mentality thing.\n\nWhat was it about the art school that you went to, about art, that you felt so drawn to?\n\nIt definitely wasn’t that I was good at it. I remember there was a time when I tried to be creative, and I wanted to draw a little bird resting on a cloud, and it just looked like it died there. I tried so hard to make it better, but I literally could not figure out how to make it not look dead. It was just a really fun experience. You could draw all of these things and use colors however you want—it felt very freeing. That lack of pressure and being able to just do something out of love is probably why art is the one thing that I’ve continued to do throughout all this time, even when I left for the United States, and even when I came back.\n\nBut then, though, the art school teacher I really liked turned out to be super transphobic. I look very passing right now, so people often get confused or surprised when they hear that I’m trans—but back then, I was not. At that point, I was 14 and I had just come out and it was a time when I needed a lot of support. And, well, she was not very supportive. By now, I had already gone to the United States—it was ninth grade—and there was a girl there who was also transgender, the first trans person I had ever met in my life. She—her name was Emelia Worth—became a really good friend of mine. She was so outgoing; she was the little sun of the entire campus. She invited me to her concert and I remember we had this long talk, and she was just very supportive, and nice, and energetic—she was just, like, everything, you know? And then she had depression. Nobody knew about it. And then she committed suicide. That was one of the first things that, eventually, made me realize how terrible the United States was.\n\nRight, because you were brand new there, so you really had no sense of what it was actually like yet.\n\nThere’s this fantasy that, in a lot of places but in my case in China, people have about America, especially middle-class liberals. It’s insane to think about now. We looked at the United States and thought it fixed everything bad and authoritarian and unfair in China, in everywhere. When I first came to the United States, I was 14 and I guess I was not supposed to be this stupid, but I genuinely thought that there were no poor people in the United States. There’s just so much propaganda from the United States but I honestly don’t think it’s as effective as our own propaganda, distributed by diaspora, by people who are just guessing what’s happening that these myths begin to feel like facts. To then go to the United States and experience that suicide so soon after, and to see the school be so unresponsive to it was just very unreal.\n\nI was really sad, so I came back home for a few weeks that winter, and thought I’d go back to the art studio and do a sketch of Emelia. I wanted to make a postcard, something people could remember her by. That was the first time I ever drew a detailed person, body, face, eyes, and ears altogether. Naturally, I wanted my teacher to take a look at it and see if it was okay. And then she just started doing transphobic stuff. Eventually, she said, “I want to take you to gǔzhēng performances.” The gǔzhēng is a traditional Chinese string instrument, right? There’s this weird belief that if someone is exposed to more traditional Chinese culture, they would just stop becoming transgender. It’s weird! People have weird understandings of what being transgender is.\n\nAnyways,I switched to a different tutor after that. The thing is, though, I live out of spite. So after that, I was honestly just, like, “I have to finish this and I have to do it well.” It took me a long time but I did eventually make the postcards and send them out to the school—I still have one or two of them. That was another major leap forward in my career; I became much more confident with drawing humans.\n\nWhat did it feel like when you finished the drawing, considering how charged the entire situation was?\n\nIt was just…nice. I picked a picture of Emelia from when she was playing the guitar and she was just in her moment, you know? The happiest. You know how in that Soul movie from Disney when people were in their moment, their soul started floating? This was that moment.\n\nWas this drawing of Emelia your first endeavor into socially conscious art?\n\nYes. Although, honestly, I didn’t do much more of it until down the line—I did a series of oil paintings on climate change and animal abuse in AP Art, but that was mostly just because AP Art wanted me to pick a theme, so I picked one. It’s not like I did a lot of research into climate\n\nchange or anything.\n\nWhen did your current series — “Progress” — begin? What was the impetus for it? It’s a lot more overtly political than your previous work, so what shifted there for you?\n\nThe first painting of the series—not that it was a series yet—started back in 2021, when I quarantining at home during COVID. At this point, I was not very aware of labor problems or capitalism or any of that, at least in China; I had left when I was 14 and I never paid attention to the workers’ situation, which is weird to think about, because I’m Chinese. It was right after the Chinese New Year, and it was COVID, and outside I saw this food delivery worker working. And to work in Beijing, right after the Chinese New Year, and during COVID too, I thought it was insane. The government didn’t give him or any other migrant workers any kind of relief or assistance that would allow people to stay home, but there was nothing, so they just started working, working whatever they could—so that was the first painting with this guy. And I guess it was just this moment of understanding, of realizing that “This is not normal.”\n\nLiz Radway is a senior at Columbia College studying dance, computer science and math. She enjoys glancing into the future as she experiments with motion capture technology and the mechanization of the body through dance and choreography. Liz spoke with me about the notion of the body as architecture, the future of dance, and blue zones.\n\nLiz met me in the lobby of her Ruggles dorm in a red checkered sweater, ripped blue jeans, and a pair of cow earrings. She welcomed me into her room where I sat on a soft pink couch tucked between her bed and the window. The bookshelf full of texts on dancers and computer science, a black and white mat with the same checkered pattern as her sweater, and small hanging disco balls that reflected rainbows onto my pants as the light from the window grazed them all made me feel immediately cozied into a world of Liz. She filled this oasis on Frat Row with the music of an Etta James soundtrack playing from a record player next to her book shelf. As I sat on her couch, waiting for her to bring our waters, I could picture Liz playing a song on this and dancing on the checkered mat, creating what might be the start of one of her mesmerizing pieces of choreography or improv… Liz lifted the needle from the record player, pausing the song, and began to tell me about her career in dance.\n\nLiz started taking dance classes with her sister when her mom enrolled them both after finding out that there was a sibling discount. Since then, Liz tells me, “it's always been a part of my life.” She started choreographing professionally during covid. “I wanted to do things on my own terms,” she tells me, “that's when I started getting interested in choreography.” Recently, Liz has been choreographing pieces that experiment with the notion of the body as architecture. “It's something that I've been exploring this semester, as I've been exploring Trisha Brown's movement. Her idea of the body as architecture is something a little bit different than how I've been interpreting it and putting it to use for myself. For her, it's the notion of almost perfection within the body in its positionality. For me, it's the acceptance of positionality in the body and movement, on its own. It's something beautiful and artistic, it can tell stories and can be designed. I’m less interested in the idea of there being a right and wrong and more in the idea of occupying space in a way that tells meaning and is beautiful.”\n\nI asked Liz what that process of choreographing pieces and telling stories through them looks like for her. “I definitely like to keep my work thematic so it has something the audience can cling on to and kind of interpret on their own. But I'm trying to stay away from rigid narratives.” For Liz’s full length works, she takes a phrase of choreography and builds from there to create a story that the audience can interpret. “I think different types of dance serve different purposes,” Liz explains. “The point of improv, for me, is just to have fun, get out some energy, move my body, take a step back from the day and just move around. With choreography, the point is to either get something across or, with some pieces, I feel like the dancers are just trying not to throw up through it. My piece [in CoLab’s ‘The Big Jam’] is definitely like that. There’s going to be a lot of heaving and hawing at the end but it’s so much fun.”\n\nThe Computer Music Center at Columbia, or the CMC, is tucked away into the side of 125th’s Prentis Hall–obstructed by concrete buildings and scaffolding. It is a secret gem of Columbia, a hidden garden only for those bold enough to brave its cracked ceilings, open electrical wiring, and commitment to spending hours there. For Maddie Breeden, her fresh dive into experimental music began here, in the CMC room with the modular synthesizer. She spends two hours a week in it, making music for her classes, her band, and hopefully, a debut album.\n\nMaddie’s relationship with music has grown and evolved alongside her over the years. Her deep connection to music began with her father, who was constantly playing synthy 80s music–like New Order and The Human League–as Maddie grew up, slowly creating the sonic palette that resonates with her today. She also played the flute for her entire childhood, until the orchestra program was cut at her school in the middle of her high school career. Despite the loss of the music program, the musical discipline she learned at a young age persisted into her later life. She would go on to teach herself to play guitar, saying how she “loved the creative freedom I had with it, because I could write my own songs on the guitar.” Throughout Maddie’s life, music has been a constant thread. She grew up in Washington D.C, where she was exposed to the vast genres within the lesser known D.C music scene. “There's a Southern influence to the music scene there,” she tells me, “it gave me an almost Southern way of playing the guitar, which I think is pretty unique and special”. She also takes inspiration from D.C’s hardcore scene in the 80s, consisting of bands like Fugazi, Minor Threat, and Bad Brains. However, she revealed to me her biggest inspiration from home is not the D.C music scene, but the river by her house. She smiles shyly when she tells me, and I can perfectly picture her sitting by a creek, quietly recording the sound so she can try to modulate it later. “I do my best writing when I'm close to water” she professes, “I love the sound. When you listen to a song and get completely lost in it, it's like the feeling of waves on your body. In my music, I want there to be waves of sound that hit the listener.”\n\nMaddie seeks to achieve these waves of sound with the modular synthesizer, a new tool in her life that has completely transformed how she creates music. This past year, in her digital music class, she learned how to use a Digital Audio Workstation, or DAW, and the modular synthesizer. “It opened me up to a lot more sounds that I've been wanting to make,” she mused, “ones that I've been hearing in my head and I can now actualize in my music.” When I ask her to explain to me the process of using the modular synth, she smiles and says “let me show you!” I watch as Maddie kneels down to the huge, black box covered in nodes, switches, plugs, and flickering lights. She takes a plug and inserts it into two outlets diagonal from each other. A booming synth rings out as she tells me about voltage control oscillators, sine waves, clock sequences, and frequency filters. As I try to keep up with the terminology, I feel like I’m learning a secret language. I realize the music Maddie hears is so different from the music I hear–her ear trained in picking up a song’s distorted tom drums or low modulators, like she knows the full recipe of a meal after taking only one bite. “It's not like a typical musical instrument directed around chord melodies,” she explains, “you have no idea what sound you're going to create, which is why it's so fun. Sometimes, when I'm writing a song, I really struggle with trying to perfect it. But I can come to this with an open mind and create something awesome without thinking twice about it. You can't recreate the sound; it just happens.” Despite her skilled use of the modular synth, she discloses to me how much more she still has to learn. “I learned how to do this by just experimenting and playing with it,” she reveals, telling me how much more she wants to learn and what new genres she wants to dive into (currently, she and her bandmate Lolo have been experimenting with playful disco beats–just another genre to add to her diverse discography).\n\nMaddie is struck by the concept of unpredictability, a theme that seeps into her demos. She describes her struggle with finding footing in formulaic chord progressions and song structures, expressing how musical standards never fully resonated with her until she broke free of the structure and discovered the creative freedom of experimental music. “You don't have to follow the rules that are set just because they're popular, or because that's what people expect of you. Experimental music has allowed me a lot more creative freedom.” Her sound is the manifestation of her unpredictable dreamscape–airy, jarring, melodic, and exploratory. Her most cherished song, Etretat, named after a village in France she once visited, combines a gentle electric guitar riff with a synthy humming–coming together in a dreamy beat overlaid with biting electronic chords that build into a thrumming voltaic end. “I love the meshing of electronic music sounds with something delicate” Maddie muses, “I love incorporating the modular synthesizer into dream pop-esque music in order to create a shock or a sound you're not expecting; it keeps the listeners on their toes a little bit.”\n\nHer journey into this more experimental music began during her study abroad last spring in the UK. Introduction to the UK’s post punk groups–such as Black Country, New Road, Jockstrap, Black Midi, and Opus Kink–combined with the prevalence of experimental and techno music allowed Maddie to explore genres of music in a way she hadn’t before. Maddie told me how she also joined the Indie Music Society, a group of bands in Scotland that met to discuss music and share their work. Her friends in the group pushed her to make music with the same devotion they did. She tells me how “I was able to allow myself to be open to creating, centering my music creation. A product of doing that was allowing myself to listen to other types of music and realize their power and how interesting they are. There’s a structure to the noise, and that’s awesome.”\n\nI’m almost reminded of that infamous NYU Masterclass video, in which singer-songwriter Maggie Rogers shows Pharrell Williams her song Alaska–to which Williams shockingly tells her, “I have 0 notes” after hearing it. The reason the song is so striking is because it reflects Rogers musical journey, as she explains how she grew up as a folk singer but after studying abroad in France and having a spiritual experience with dance music there, her relationship to music completely transformed. Maddie’s musical journey–while different–still holds that idea of having a strong piece of one’s musical past transformed by the introduction of a previously unheard of music scene in a city far away. I realize there’s something magical about being in a new city, alone and young, being held together by the songs you come across–letting it shape who you become and what you create. When we get to step out of the everyday Columbia bubble, the thing quietly beating inside us gets to take form, as if it's been there all along and was merely waiting for a calling.\n\nThese days, Maddie is working towards releasing new music on her own and with her bandmate and drummer, Lolo. “It's been challenging to create the sound you feel in the room and translate it to an audio file,” she confesses, “But we want to get our music out there so that people can listen. I’m trying to put out at least a few songs by the end of the semester.” Her determination to release music is in part due to an illuminating conversation with an old friend and music teacher from home, who respectively told her how much they loved her music from high school and want more of it. “Having those conversations made me realize it's my duty to produce something and give back by inputting something out into the world. It can be a lot to juggle, but I know I have this obligation to new music.” She played me a snippet of two songs she's been working on–one a thrumming electronic beat with snappy and buzzing synth inspired by indie rock band Spirit of the Beehive, and the other a haunting single-string guitar melody with a build into electronic drums and piano that she only started the day before. Each is completely different from each other, but also intrinsically Maddie. She tells me how she’s been struggling with the notion of making a cohesive theme in her music. However, to me, I feel like the theme is obvious: it's all grounded in the fact that she was the one who created it. The reproduction of her dreamscape, of her mind and the sounds within it, are all immersed within the music she's made. It's a sound that recreates a Southern guitar influence combined with a passion for experimental music abroad–a sound that has a journey within that reflects Maddie’s own.\n\nFrom writing songs in her teenage bedroom using GarageBand and a MIDI keyboard, to taking on the intricate and complex modular synthesizer, Maddie’s musical journey has grown up alongside her. She reflects on how the musical practices she developed when she was younger are still with her (the Alvvays songs she first learned on guitar in high school are forever embedded within her fingertips when she plays). Maddie’s pure joy and adoration for music is the vehicle for her intricate and impactful songs, as she embeds her experiences in venues across the world into dreamy guitar riffs and idiosyncratic synths. Maddie articulates the sensational feeling of music, contemplating how “When I’m dancing somewhere, I feel the music. It speaks to me and takes over my body in a way that I can't explain. You just get lost in it, and lost in your own world”. The ephemeral, glittering, intangible experience of music is built into the core of what Maddie does. She describes to me a poem by David Berman, the lead singer of the Silver Jews (a 90s indie rock band she listened to growing up), called “And the Others”. “Berman talks about this ‘Light’ that you cannot see,” she tells me “He says how the light shines for all these different people in different ways [such as literature, art, or sexuality] but it shines.\n\nFor me, the light comes from my music.”\n\nRenny Gong (he/him) has a very pleasant smile, takes many pauses in conversation, and his preferred beverage at the Hungarian Pastry Shop is black coffee. He prefers black coffee not because he is particularly fond of Hungarian’s black coffee but because he is able to refill his beverage as much as he pleases [pro-tip: order black coffee if you don’t want to keep paying for those fluffy cappuccinos]. Due to popular demand, I never got a chance to taste the stew he sold in Lerner, but something tells me that he would put a lot of joy into any culinary endeavor he undertakes. If in luck, you might be able to hear Renny singing a Justin Bieber hit over karaoke (perhaps at a certain poetry open mic night). I was minutes or maybe even seconds away from witnessing both Renny’s cooking and singing… I hope I’ll get to eat his food and hear his singing one day. Renny describes himself as a flash-fiction writer.\n\nMara Toma– What’s one thing that made you feel something today?\n\nRenny Gong – I wanted to show you something. Look at this! I have a carabiner attached to my pants and there are a bunch of keys on it. When I stand up, it (really) jangles [Renny gets up at this point]. I put it on for the last few days, and today in particular… I knew I wanted to show Mara [you].\n\nMT— Is that specific to today?\n\nRG— It’s specific to the last few days because I rediscovered it in my possessions. I forgot about it a little bit but now it is fully part of my aesthetics. My friend Andy (one of my best friends), a very sweet guy, decided to get me this as a birthday present. Interestingly, these keys don’t do anything… they're simply decor. Isn’t that so funny?\n\nMT— It is. And there is an interesting musicality too, you now.\n\nRG— It’s a very annoying musicality. I walk around and I clang clang everywhere. He [Andy] went into a key store and asked if he could have their spare keys, and picked all the ones that looked weird.\n\nMT— Now that I am getting to know you a bit more… If you had a day to yourself and you could do anything you wanted to, how would you spend it?\n\nRG— I’d go to the Hungarian Pastry Shop– I honestly feel at my best there. One thing that I love about the Hungarian Pastry Shop is that it’s very loud and there’s no music, and one feels very consumed by noise. There is also nothing piercing through the noise so you can feel fully bothered… which I enjoy. I'd also like to play a game– it can be Gomoku or this other game called Sheng Ji. Sheng Ji is a Chinese card game played by 4 or more players… It's my favorite game in the world. Hungarian Pastry Shop, play a game, black coffee, and I’d like to be on some sort of transportation vehicle, but not a car. I want to be on a train or a bus. I’d like to go somewhere and come back. I would also call my mom.\n\nMT— I am curious… What attracts you to transportation?\n\nRG—I feel like I’ve done something once I’ve transported. If I am just around I don’t feel as good as when I’ve left. You know how some people say things like “I’ve got to get out of the city, or I've got to get out of Morningside Heights, or I've got to get off campus”... I feel that constantly.\n\nMT— Shifting gears a little bit. I feel like your work may be interpreted in a number of ways. It could be read as poetry, prose, or even song sometimes– especially in your shorter pieces, your writing’s identity can appear fluid. Do you defy classification?\n\nRG — I don’t want people to think I am a poet… I don’t know why. There is nothing wrong with a person who writes poems; poems are really good, and poets are nice. I don’t know that I want to be a poet because I’ve set out to become a fiction writer.\n\nMT— As a writer, what does your creative process look like?\n\nRG– Do you make art?\n\nMT– I am not an artist, but I doodle.\n\nRG— What is your creative process for doodling?\n\nMT— I feel bored and then I doodle.\n\nRG— It’s the same thing then– I feel bored and I doodle. I am always trying to think about someone’s voice. If the first line sounds good, then it will work. At least initially, it’s about how it sounds. If it sounds good at first then it will carry throughout the piece. Most artistic process is coming up with a nice first sentence. Also, writing has to sound like someone’s speaking.\n\nMT– How do you construct that voice, that someone-speaking effect?\n\nRG— I say it out loud. If it sounds like someone, it’s good.\n\nMT– Something else that struck me about your work is that it seems to be rooted within a very specific moment in time. It almost feels like a photograph that immortalizes a very specific experience, feeling, or event. What’s the role of temporality in your writing?\n\nRG — My work tends to get very into one moment. I don’t want to make any generalizations. It’s a difficult task to make generalizations about the world. Statements like “that’s why you should never get into a car with a stranger” or “hurt people hurt people” are bad things to write. Instead, the way to achieve some sort of greater meaning is to dig deeper into a specific meaning. That way, you can illuminate deep into one moment, and that can actually help you understand something.\n\nMT — In addition to dealing with a very specific moment in time, a lot of your work engages two parallel interior and exterior worlds that are constantly interacting with one another.\n\nRG— The two are always interacting with one another. I write more “exterior,” though… I want to let the reader figure out the interior. It’s harder to purely write the interior without the exterior. You can say something like “I felt sad” which is not interesting. Instead, you can describe the outcomes of sadness and that way the thing itself is much more sad… and you feel more from that. If I say “I felt sad,” you don’t actually empathize with me. But if I say I did something dramatic and I’ll tell you what the dramatic thing was then you’ll empathize with me. It’s more valuable to write about the exterior as a way to illuminate the interior.\n\nMT — What strikes me is that even though you are firm in the fact that you are a fiction writer, your work is written exclusively in first person and is filled with many details that read as autobiographical. How does your identity interact with the work?\n\nRG — All fiction is completely autobiographical– there is no escaping autobiography. If you make up a story, the elements of that story are still you. There is no point of distinction… everything is me and everything is you. If I incorporate non-fiction elements in my writing that doesn’t make it less fiction. And all storytelling, even \"nonfiction\" storytelling, is an act of lying. You are always choosing what to share and not share… The prose doesn’t suddenly become better or worse if it’s fiction or nonfiction. It’s not very enjoyable to draw the line between fiction and non-fiction. If you decide that it’s better or worse because it’s fiction or nonfiction, then you are not paying attention to the right things. If you say it’s one thing or another, that’s not interesting. For instance, if you ask your crush if they are into you, and they say “yes” or “no” then the crush is over.\n\nMT– For some people it’s the beginning of a burgeoning relationship though.\n\nRG– Yes it’s true, but the crush is over. Or, the infatuation or the crush may not be over, but something is over.\n\nMT– The mystery is over maybe? The delusion?\n\nRG– Yes, the delusion is over. And delusion is engaging…\n\nMT- When reading your work I felt an informality about it that felt joyful and freeing. How would you characterize the role of joy in your work?\n\nRG—[Instead of answering my question, Renny told me 7 facts about animal sex. According to him, that was more interesting and I think I agree.]\n\nMT– When reading your work, I felt that your writing sometimes resists endings. Would you say this is true?\n\nRG— My dad says it does. But no, I don’t resist endings. I think about endings very carefully, how to land them, where to land, in what fashion to land. I think all my stuff has carefully considered endings.\n\nMT–... I don’t think your endings are not carefully considered– I just think some of your prose resists that finite end.\n\nColumbia professor Sam Lipsyte, who I am doing an independent study with this semester, says that an ending should look like this\n\n[At this point, Renny takes out a notebook and draws two circles. For the first circle, he connects the beginning point with the end point, “a full circle” whereas for the second circle he draws a circle but instead of connecting the beginning to the end the line isn’t fully connected.\n\nA short story should end like this [points to the second circle] so that it achieves an almost closure. That’s something I think about for endings.\n\nMT– Finally, you mentioned working on a novel. Could you tell me a little bit about that?\n\nIt’s about a bunch of kids playing ping-pong in rural China. A bunch of wacky shit happens… The kids have some issues. One of the kids, for instance, is twelve years old and has an alcohol problem. His name is Jean-Pierre. There’s a guy named Durian [who is the other main character, I would say]. He loves karaoke. There’s a guy who draws porn for money. They all get really mistreated by the coaches. And there’s a lot of rule-explaining–telling how ping-pong works.\n\nBut mainly, it’s a story about the main character and his mother.\n\nMT– … inspired by autobiography?\n\nRG– 10% of it. The setting is all autobiography, but all the content is not.\n\nMT— do you play ping pong?\n\nRG— yeah. That’s the main history of my life: table tennis. I’ve pivoted into the second phase of my life: writing. The first phase is called table tennis and the second phase is writing.\n\nYou can find more of Renny’s work here: www.rennygong.com\n\nMeinzer’s dislike of machines, including cell phones, meant that the interview almost didn’t happen. They had texted the wrong number, agreeing to meet in Hungarian to chat. Later, Meinzer mentioned their “book of inconveniences, which is basically just a book of things [they] hate.” I imagined a page dedicated to cellular devices, expounding at length over the futility of technology, and the word-swallowing void into which Meinzer’s text had disappeared, unopened.\n\nWe did end up meeting, after some last-minute relocation, on the first floor of Dodge, due to Hungarian’s perpetual lack of seating. I first noted the firmness of Meinzer’s handshake. At the time, I didn’t know about Meinzer’s love of color, which they attributed to their legacy of working with painting. They were dressed in black and white, a juxtaposition of colors they enjoy, inspired by their work with inks and dyes at an internship for a screen printer. There, Meinzer discovered their secret superpower: someone could point to a computer, say, “I want this color,” and Meinzer would mix it perfectly, despite never having taken a formal color theory class.\n\n“Tell me about yourself” revealed several more important facts about Meinzer: they’re from Austin, Texas; their favorite food is dino nuggets and Diet Coke (although “it's actually pretty hard just finding dino nuggets down here, so I really struggle with that,” Meinzer observed); and that they simply would not survive life without their squishy pillow.\n\nIt occurred to me that I knew which pillow Meinzer was referring to. Selfies, a series of self-portraits drawn with charming crudeness on kitakata paper, depicts Meinzer swimming, stretching, and walking, among other poses. One print features Meziner hugging the squishy pillow to their chest. There is something relatable and honest about it — the bluntly drawn arms encircling the object, the familiarity and comfort of the embrace.\n\n“With the subject matter, I just didn't want to think about it. I was like, ‘Oh, here's me today,’” Meinzer said. “Also, I’m really self obsessed. All the self portraits and the selfies are kind of a continuation of that self-ness, I would say.”\n\nAs a nonfiction writer, I was interested in this: the raw depiction of a self. I explained my own work in personal narrative, how I was beginning to tire of myself, the first person, and the “I”’s dotting the page. “It all feels vaguely narcissistic,” I said. Meinzer agreed with this; they also have concerns about self depiction. They spend a lot of time in front of the mirror. They’ve seen so many photos of themselves and drawn themselves in so many different ways that they’re no longer sure what their face looks like. Their fingers skim their cheek as they tell me this, as if to confirm their physical presence. “Looking at your image, you can become really disconnected with yourself,” they said. It’s a disconcerting experience similar to being in a room with multiple mirrors, where you’re forced to confront many reflections of yourself from all sides. Looking at yourself, I realized, is not necessarily synonymous to seeing yourself.\n\nMeinzer investigates their perceived disconnect between mind and body through the 30 second process of printmaking, which was how the Selfies were made. Printmaking is Meinzer’s way to shake off their technical training in drawing and painting in favor of an “intuitive type of making,” which they find akin to muscle memory. “I want things that put me back in my body,” Meinzer, who described themself as anti-movement, explained. “I really have a hard time feeling like I'm living in my body. I feel like I spend a lot of time in my head. But I’m not going to think myself back into my body, I’m going to get myself back in by feeling something.”\n\nIt’s important to Meinzer that audiences are grounded by the tactical element of their work, that they remember how to sit and interact and use things. Meinzer’s objects evoke a choreography of the body, urging users to consider the ways they traverse through space, and what they can touch and do. The objects are situated in an environment that can’t be “beige and millenial,” but possesses its own visual language.\n\nThis is apparent in The Dollhouse, which houses Meinzer’s alter egos, Baby Dyke and Lady Darling. The objects within the dollhouse, from the dolls to the furniture themselves, exist to facilitate play and conceptualize Meinzer’s past and present selves – allowing for a growth of consciousness. I press Meinzer on their definition of consciousness as something we continually attain throughout our lives. Do we become more distant from ourselves as we grow older? Part of me assumed, naively, that The Dollhouse was a nostalgic attempt to return to childhood.\n\nMeinzer’s definition of play, however, is more intertwined with one’s submission to fantasy – sustaining the make believe. It’s something kids do all the time, Meinzer said: “If you’re playing a magical character, you’re not delusional. You’re submitting to fantasy. It’s how kids learn empathy. It’s a great tool for imagination. And we lose that in puberty when we become really aware of the gaze.” Slipping into a different self – a metamorphosis that occurs when you remove yourself from external perceptions of you – is something that fascinates Meinzer. It’s a phenomenon that happens with drag, BDSM, and within the trans community, they added. They view themselves as an amalgamation of many different selves and aggregate identities; in play, there is no awareness of fulfilling a role. The new, embodied self doesn’t necessarily imitate who you are in real life, but is unequivocally you.\n\nThe follow-up question naturally became, “Is there a way to teach people this?” I pulled up the first page of their portfolio, where they described themselves as “interested in crafting games.” Were games the best medium to activate the confrontation of self?\n\n“I hate games,” Meinzer said bluntly.\n\n“What?” I was incredulous; yet this, I soon discovered, would be my introduction to one of their many paradoxes.\n\n“I'm not interested in games that are traditional, like a board game or a card game or something with a set objective, or way to win,” they explained. “And while I can see the merit and satisfaction in organizing yourself in relation to that sort of structure, I'm personally so bored by it. People get really defensive when I talk about this, especially board game lovers.”\n\nI pointed out the window. “I think I see them coming,” I said. “They’re rallying on the walkway and they’re all holding Monopoly.”\n\n“Yeah, if you’re [a board game lover] reading this, cool it,” Meinzer said.\n\nOne game Meinzer does enjoy, though, is arrangement. Their piece, Anti-Puzzle, debuted at Caffeine Underground in Bushwick, and features birch plywood puzzle pieces meant to be assembled on the printed wood table. There is no making Anti-Puzzle, no correct order it can be arranged. It also doesn’t reference anything – it doesn’t take on the elaborate shape of a duck, for example. Instead, how much of the game people can take into their own hands, and apply their own experience and intrigue to the rules, is Meziner’s metric for whether a piece was successful. They recalled the different approaches users took with Anti-Puzzle: some tried to arrange all the patterned pieces together, while others stacked them like blocks. “That was the best thing that happened, because I would have never thought to do that,” Meinzer said. “Other people had covered the table completely so that all of the holes were hidden. And they were like, ‘Oh, did we win the game?’ And I was like, ‘Sure, yeah.’”\n\nStill, Meinzer recognizes that they actually are operating under a set of rules: their audiences are not puppets, and they aren’t the puppet master. “It’s such an artist’s ego thing,” they said. “Like, you really want control over everything. And then when you bring people into it, it’s hard.” To Meinzer, the difficulty of relational aesthetics, and the participatory element of their work, lies in the tension between knowing what to give and not giving too much. “I don’t want people to be used as a medium as opposed to just interacting with a piece,” they continued. “I am realizing how desperate I am for a very specific pattern of use. But then it's also like, I'm not interested in having wall text that says, ‘You can use this.’ That sucks.”\n\nThe variability of setting comes up here; would a gallery be the best environment for Meinzer’s pieces? Would they kill the casualness of the objects? These are questions Meinzer is still trying to figure out. They launch into another paradox: how their intuitive side of making is constantly wrestling with their intense planning side. Because their objects are meant for use, the piece needs to be referent enough to everyday objects, and not abstract to the point where the purpose of picking it up and interacting with it is completely lost. Even if there are certain rules in place, concedes Meinzer, they’re “definitely trying to really obscure the set of rules.”\n\nWith Anti–Puzzle, a game’s structure can and should be constructed by the user, whose agency depends on decision-making. When does the game start and finish? What are the rules of the game? These are questions the piece asks of the audience, meant to spur the activation of bodily awareness and co-creation on the users’ part. “The game can even be changed halfway through,” Meinzer added. “If you’re bad at the game you’re currently playing, you can definitely change the rules.”\n\nTo eliminate the performativity of the gallery space, Meinzer posited whether the best way to interact with their objects is in a room alone, without the acute awareness that others are watching you use the piece. I argued against this, because part of Anti-Puzzle’s appeal to me was its ability to form community, the way strangers were drawn together, even if briefly, to work on the tessellation together.\n\nMeinzer shrugged. Maybe it’s a problem that doesn’t need to be solved. Ambiguity can be desirable. “If the piece fails, it says something about the space around us, the social rules that are assigned to that certain space,” Meinzer said. “Your pieces are smarter than you and they should teach you. You don’t need to know 1000% what your piece is doing.”\n\nA new concept Meinzer is working on now involves unlocking a new level of bodily agency in the audience by encouraging the destruction of their artwork. It’s a pushback against their observed preciousness with art objects in the art world – “do they need to be treated that preciously?” They brought up Ray Johnson’s mail art, in which cheap pieces of paper are streaked with crayola marks, chafed by the mailbox, and carry the indentations of the hands that have held, opened, and transported the material. These signs of wear inspire Meinzer deeply. . There’s something beautiful about imperfection: the undeniable affectation of time and flesh.\n\n“[With Anti-Puzzle], people were putting their iced coffee down, and it was condensating on the table,” Meinzer said, following our dialogue on signs of use. “Thankfully, or I don’t know, not thankfully, there were no marks left, but had there been a mark left, I realize I kind of would have been excited by that.”\n\nThis nonchalant approach doesn’t mean that Meinzer isn’t protective of their objects. They recalled a time their friend almost damaged the Anti-Puzzle, which freaked them out. It was another paradox they were grappling with: how open were they really to a piece being altered? When I explained my reaction to “For When You Want to be Alone” as a shelter, they countered by saying many had the opposite reaction – they found the environment hostile. To a certain extent, this accomplishes the goal of their work: “I want people to feel some sense of discomfort but also feel very safe,” Meinzer said. “It can’t just be this sanctuary safe space sort of thing. I’m trying to find ways to include risk or destruction or violence into the work…[to incorporate] some sort of decision making or risk within.”\n\nShe may not have realized it, but in her black turtleneck and leather jacket, Sofía Trujillo looked every bit like the writer I had imagined. With my hair pragmatically pulled back and my notebook and pen in hand, I probably looked exactly like the interviewer I was playing at, too. I had suggested we meet in Butler to chat, which she countered with the Hungarian Pastry Shop – an infinitely better choice given the shop’s ambiance, and its deep roots of literary history. We both waved to friendly faces (a few we had in common!) as we shuffled awkwardly past the tight tables, to the back, and sat down. I was waiting for my first almond horn of the season, and she had a hot chocolate coming.\n\nSofía, a Barnard junior, has a command over language and a way of painting with words that feels all-consuming (and frankly, extremely intimidating. I mean, how am I supposed to write an article about a writer?). Reading Sofia’s work is a sensory experience. She writes with an abundance of scenery and description, both abstract and tangible, that does more than just help you visualize the narrative, but allows you to actually live within it. On explaining my experience reading her work, Sofía seemed a bit surprised, explaining that she just “get[s] really heavy handed.” Sofía elaborated that some of her influences include “David Foster Wallace and some Virginia Woolf, but especially the latter: I think most Virginia Woolf came after being told, ‘oh, I feel like you write like this.’ I already had established my voice, and realized ‘I also have really long sentences with a lot of adjectives’ so in school my parents, my teachers, would repeatedly make comments on my papers. One of my teachers called my sentences baroque.” As an art history student, I jumped at that – baroque is, in the best way possible, exactly how I would describe Sofía’s writing, full of simmering tension and tenebrism. Sofía continued, “there's so much to say about every given thing and I want to put everything in a sentence - and give it a color and a sound and a name and what it is about. That is what is exciting about writing to me.”\n\nUndergirding this pathos, and giving Sofía’s writing its potency, is her commitment to writing what she sees and lives. Practically everything she writes is grounded in her own experiences, which she filters through absurdist and satirical lenses, though she cautions that, “I use those words more as adjectives than as a movement,” clarifying that she does not see herself as a Satirist or Absurdist (as proper nouns) but rather someone who plays with elements of those movements. Explaining her relationship with satire, for Sofía, satire is “a way to give an opinion, but also hide behind humor and nonchalance, to say ‘I don't care.’ Which is not always true, you can act like you don't care. You're just making a joke.” Sofía arguably began to develop her affinity for social critique in freshman year. As an international student coming from Argentina, her experience was different from many U.S. natives: “People thought I was cool on the basis of nothing. I remember feeling like I wasn't even required to have a personality because just my experience growing up somewhere else was enough material. I say ‘I've never been to Chick-fil-A’ and people would freak out.”\n\nSofia describes herself as being predisposed to holding back her thoughts, never the first to share an opinion nor someone who moves through the world with externalized convictions, something that people have occasionally misinterpreted: “my own hesitancy to say things about social dynamics and silence was interpreted as, ‘okay, it's cool.’ People just fill in the gaps in their brain. I think it was me doing a ground-analysis of the situation. It was also just a lot of fear, and a lot of discomfort. I was really scared to take a stance in general, and I was raised in an environment that sometimes encouraged me to be more fearful of what was new instead of curious. Taking a stance, for me, on anything, literally the smallest thing, felt like losing my ability to maneuver 360° all the time. I was staking my claim with this one particular corner of a discussion, and I didn't like that because I didn't feel like I had enough knowledge to stand behind it. It got to a point where I wanted people to know what I stand for more clearly.” Sofía did not come to writing as a form of self-expression linearly, her path was not as romantic as just “she wrote her way out of it.” It took a mix of therapy and practice - all of which diffuses into her writing to create works so thoroughly observant of the human experience. Reading her work feels like becoming another person altogether, you become so immersed in her world. Sofía’s style reads like the perfect blend between a surgeon and a surrealist - something so profoundly emotive but also deeply precise in its details.\n\nHaving heard so much about her writer’s process, I felt compelled to ask Sofía how she contends with questions about originality in her work – some artists seem obsessed with it, while others swat it off as ego-driven and impossible. After thinking for a moment, she replied, “I do think that that's something that every person who is creating something is going to grapple with. Because so much of my work is centered on my human experience, I truly focus on the exceptionality of each person and what they do. That's why I'm not necessarily as concerned with doing something that really makes me feel powerful, and that's hard.” Despite her focus on her own lived experiences, Sofía often writes as a disembodied third-person narrator, finding it to be just as personal but far more rewarding. “​​I'm tired of myself,” she said with a slight, exasperated roll of her eyes. “That's how I was feeling in my whole non-fiction class this semester. I had already, previously, taken another class called ‘What's Your Story.’ So, I had already been writing about myself for so long. I'd already written about my mother; our issues are well parsed out. Every time I would start a sentence with ‘I,’ I felt disgusted. That's kind of when I started writing about all these other things, because it felt like a way to talk about how I see things but not really center myself.” Out of all the brilliant things Sofía said to me at the café that day, this struck me the most. Here is a person who so sincerely experiences the world around her in prose, then uses the skills that she has worked so hard to develop to reflect the world back at itself. It is difficult to properly convey the power of the earnestness present in Sofia’s writing. (although, I suspect, Sofía could probably do it, and do it well). It is both natural and honed, as well as more deeply experiential than could ever be replicated.\n\nOn leaving Hungarian, Sofía explained, “when I got here, I never thought that I would have enough work to send it somewhere.” I looked at her, puzzled, and she explained, “I never thought that I would be chosen for someone to ask me questions about what I thought about writing, or that I would have answers.” I told her that I would call it a full-circle moment, for her to go from imagining interviews to participating in them—but for Sofía it is not, nor has it ever been, a circle, but rather a zig-zag of meaningful experiences and serendipitous accidents. Keep your eyes open for her work around campus – though be aware that if you bump into her, you might find yourself in the background of one of her pieces.\n\nRead her work here.\n\nHer apartment, shared with her friends, was filled with Linnea’s art–from portraits to still lifes to film photography. Her art shared a space with vibrant print collages and ceiling-high movie posters, creating a colorful and inspired space. In the kitchen, Linnea pushed a rainbow beaded curtain aside, offering me some tea left behind by a friend from England. On the dining room table lay black and white film prints of her roomate taken by the ferris wheel at Coney Island. When I asked Linnea about her inclination towards depicting her friends in her art, she smiled, saying “I’m so happy to be able to portray them. For these photos, someone else might be like “that's cool I guess” but I see it as “oh my god that was such a fun day at Coney Island!” Whether a picture of a day at Coney Island or a painting of a moment of quiet studying, Linnea is fascinated by the mundanity of life. Her current project is her weekly collage, made up of the wonders and scraps of the week. “I collect a bunch of stuff that most people would think is trash, but I choose very carefully. My memory is not great sometimes, and it's so easy to forget what happened. I’m super interested in the process of recording my life and others’ and those small stories that you would otherwise forget about.” As we talked, she quietly took the sticker label off a discarded pound cake wrapper that would later find its place in her collage. “It's also really nice to have a private practice for yourself,” she added, “and collages are helping me let go of perfection.”\n\nWe discussed her short films, one made in her sophomore year and one during her junior year study abroad in Prague. The latter was shot fully on film–an arduous but rewarding process. “The process of shooting on film itself is so intense. You only have 2-3 rolls of film, so you can't do as many takes as you can shooting on digital. With film, sometimes you get just one take.” Her first short film–funded by Columbia University Film Productions in 2022–is currently removed from Youtube so she can re-edit and re-work it. “It was my first time writing a script and my first time doing literally anything film related” she explained, “so I was trying to teach myself while pretending I knew everything for my crew.” Her film, which followed two people trying to figure out if they were on a date or not, struck a chord in many viewers. “It wasn’t based on my life, but a lot of people said it was relatable, which was great–it shows the truth in it!” Her next steps for filmmaking would be “Writing a feature. I wouldn't make it right now, but it would be an ongoing process extending beyond graduation. I definitely want to work to improve my script writing.”\n\nLinnea further expressed how she recently shed the idea of striving for perfection and mastery. “Since I work with so many mediums and have so many interests, it's impossible to get really good at one thing,” she mused, adding how “I spoke to a filmmaker over the summer who identified as a multimedia artist, even though they primarily focus on film. I asked them, \"Where do you find the time to master all the different skills you need to do this?\" And they said, \"well just the word ‘master’ itself has a deeply problematic history\" which is so true. It made me realize I don't want to master anything or aim for constant perfection. I can leave the unfinished behind me!” By renouncing the idea of perfection, Linnea is able to work in many mediums at once, as well as let projects breathe and have time between when she first works on them to when she finishes them.\n\nBirth being so thematically central, I find myself curious as to where Daniel’s composer identity was born.\n\nIn response, Daniel tells me a story. According to familial lore—lore indeed because he isn’t sure of its authenticity—Daniel’s family was at a dinner party, and in attendance was a family friend who happened to be a professional cellist. At some point that evening, the cellist plays, leaving Daniel utterly mesmerized and desperate to learn the glorious instrument, thereby unfolding his current world.\n\nGrowing up near Boston College—at the intersection of Chestnut Hill and Newton—Daniel fell in love with the Western and Romantic canon of music. Anchoring his pre-college education were auditions, competitions, orchestras, chamber groups, and the wholehearted pursuit of becoming a professional cello player.\n\n“I went to The Rivers School for high school, which has a conservatory program embedded in it where 10% of the students are musicians. I was a cellist there, but I also took some composition classes.” Soon, however, the intensity of playing the cello at school and for extracurriculars became overwhelming, and Daniel sought a means for rest and creativity.\n\n“I started playing jazz piano and jazz guitar for fun. Guitar started as a campfire activity and my older brother was a jazz pianist. I was very inspired by him and could borrow his materials.”\n\nWhat started as reprieve and play soon became a site for self-discovery: “Playing instruments other than the cello exposed me to an ensemble vision where I was playing with harmonies all the time. That made me want to compose a lot, because I had different instruments in my arsenal. And I could see that they played distinct roles.”\n\nBut Daniel didn’t start taking composing seriously until he came to Columbia, where he’s now a senior studying music (predictably) and physics (not-so-predictably)!\n\nPhysics doesn’t define Daniel’s identity the way music does—he does not call himself a physicist like he calls himself a musician: “The reason I [pursue both music and physics] is not because of their intersection. People say, oh, there's stuff that you can do with acoustics. But I do it for education, not vocation. I really want to study two very disparate things that interpret the world in opposition to each other because it allows me to have a more holistic and robust understanding of it.”\n\nSeldom do I come across individuals whose personal curiosities defined their education path. One of Columbia’s unique characteristics as an educational institution is its pre-professionalism, its “student-to-intern-to-investment banker pipeline,” so it can feel isolating to trek through a not-so-clear career path. Pursuing an art form of any kind as one’s primary vocation in an increasingly capitalist world is daunting.\n\nWhen I share these sentiments with Daniel, he admits that he experiences these anxieties as well. For him, there’s a limited degree of safety in pursuing physics in addition to music.\n\n“I'm gonna give myself five years to just do music after undergrad and apply to music master’s programs, knowing that I [could return to my physics] degree. If needed, I could apply to physics programs, and maybe make a life for myself there.”\n\nEven with such intense dedication in composition and music, Daniel is still afraid of putting himself in a box, of limiting his possibilities. “Oftentimes, I feel regret… I think I'm wasting so much of my time doing this and that, when I don't even expect to do it professionally. Why am I still playing so much cello? I'm not a performer anymore!\n\nOne belief I uphold is that anything in life will make me a better composer. My wider experiences help me as a creative person. All my mentors have taken years off of music to do other, unrelated things. It has made their music better and they’ll self-report that. And it makes a lot of sense to me. So maybe I can trick myself into thinking oh, it's for the craft.”\n\nThe words of Henry David Thoreau echo in my ears: “how vain is it to sit down to write when you have not stood up to live.” To become a better composer, Daniel studies physics, performs in the Columbia Orchestra, in chamber groups, in musical theater shows. Examples of work and dedication that are peripheral yet necessary. “I just can’t live without them. I’ve put myself in these social circles my whole life. It feels really off when I don’t have that experience and don’t connect with its people.”\n\nThe shift from performance to composition came to Daniel in a time defined by fluctuation—by birth and destruction—the pandemic: “I realized that so much of my cello playing was social. And so when I was stuck at home alone, practicing, I lost motivation in a way that I didn't expect. Being in a vacuum forced me to confront that I would rather compose.” At a time where performance was rendered impossible, composition—a form of creation that is time-intensive and also transferable via the Internet—became the outlet for human connection Daniel sought.\n\nDaniel’s composition scores read almost like a novel, the narrative aspect reinforced all the way through. Each music score starts with a cover page displaying the title, ensemble, and composer’s name. The next page is the composer’s notes, containing the inspiration for the score—typically poetry—and a message of gratitude. The page before the actual score are notation specifications to guide the musicians.\n\nIt’s clear that Daniel puts a lot of effort into his composer’s notes—they read like the preface of a book, ready to welcome you into a journey. The act of composing—I learn—requires more than just a connection to music, but to writing as well.\n\nIn Glass’ composer’s note, Daniel includes the self-written poem that first guided the creation of the score. Although he originally had no intention of making it into a musical piece, sound and its diction reverberates all throughout it. Even when Daniel writes a poem, he is conscious of sound, of musicality.\n\nThis process of transferring one form of art into another is what Daniel calls inspiration-laundering: “Oftentimes, if I'm tasked to create a piece, I'll listen to something that I really love while doing some sort of art—usually poetry or sculpture. In my mind, I'm a sponge absorbing the emotive human essence from the art I'm listening to. And months later—because then that means I've forgotten the specifics—I can compose based on the art that I created.”\n\nThere is a lineage of inspiration that flows from one medium to another, a story outside of the narrative each composition holds, where older creative artifacts are made into a final musical score.\n\n“Though the medium is sonic,” Daniel describes, “the main goal is to create imagery in one's mind. Our minds are very powerful, and they can do that, and not ascribe or prescribe what those images should be.”\n\nThere is also an unpredictably and self-governing nature to Daniel’s creative process. He began writing the Infants of Further Life for class without knowing where it was headed. Often, the music dictates to Daniel what his subject matter should be in a way he does not choose. He may approach a piece with singular purpose on one day, and realize that the music is beckoning to be made into something different the very next.\n\nWith Infants of Further Life, the piece told Daniel that it was a baby.\n\nIt was only upon this realization and further writing that Daniel started looking for poetry about birth to inspire the rest of the piece. “It kind of goes from one to another to another back to the music, so it's not as linear as it sounds. You create modules and then you arrange it in a way that's convincing as linear.”\n\nFrom there, theories develop about the role of the different instruments about the vibrant world Daniel conjures within the score. “If the clarinet is vocal, and it's whimpering and babbling and singing, then what are the other instruments doing? How do I fit them into the narrative?”\n\nIf a piece self-governs itself in Daniel’s work, then who names each piece? “I think about the title of my pieces for a very long time. They are the best articulation of how I am in a certain moment.”\n\nFor instance, the title for Infants of Further Life came to Daniel in a moment when he felt like “a child masquerading as an adult,” while Glass was a response to an upsetting situation, making Daniel want “to scream and shatter things.” The name becomes obvious when the narrative and emotions are clear.\n\nHowever, the process is a little different when it comes to film scores, another manifestation of Daniel’s composition. “I'm very lucky that the student directors that I've worked with have given me a lot of agency; they'll have a loose idea and will use words to describe it. But sometimes, it's hard to use language to describe music if you don't do it all the time. And so their descriptions end up being up to my interpretation as well. When the music is subservient to [a larger film or story], it also opens me up creatively.”\n\nScoring films can feel liberating, especially when contemporary academia expects young composers to be vanguarding the future. “You must be pushing the envelope in some sort of way to be taken seriously. In a post-modern world, people say that you can make anything and be fine, but in my experience, it doesn't feel to be true.\n\nIf you compose pieces in a very certain aesthetic, more doors will open to you. And I actually do love how art music is, and playing that game. But it can also be caging.”\n\nRight now, Daniel is writing a piece called May I Come In? for violin, cello, percussion, drum set, and piano. It’s an interactive piece between musician and instrument, where each musician takes their turn to knock on their instruments—as if knocking on a door—and asking the instrument if anyone is home. “And then people all whisper welcome and play the instruments in these kinds of luscious cascades in a very impressionist sort of way, with instruments inviting you in.”\n\nBut beyond concert music created for class and music scores created for student films, what does Daniel’s music sound like when it’s made just for him?\n\nWhen there’s no ensemble to play his score or an audience gazing upon a silver screen, Daniel returns to sonic meditations—a practice created by American composer Pauline Oliveros. Perhaps he’ll take his cello and play Bach cello suites. Other times, he’ll pick up his guitar and sing (he was listening to Ms. Lauryn Hill earlier that day because he’s trying to cover her).\n\n“They’re good palate cleansers. They bring me back to the live act of creation and listening, which ultimately should anchor everything else you do.”\n\nWatch his video interview:\n\nCurrently I am working on translating that same aesthetic into my films. But it's really hard to accomplish the same effect in moving images. My college roommate got me into horror, and discovering that genre has affected my work a lot too. For a while, my favorite movie was Alien Covenant. I really admire Ridley Scott’s costume design and world building, he’s one of the best ever to do sci-fi.\n\nHowever, I also draw inspiration from other film genres. I am fascinated by Roma. I watched it a year and a half ago, and I still think about it a lot. Because of my Mexican identity, I understand it differently: it hits so many beats that only Mexican people understand. When my mom watched it, she was like “Yeah, that's what Roma looked like when I was tiny.” And that tells me that it is a really, really well-made movie: it is informed by history and it reminds viewers of their own personal experience. I want to see more works like that. I want to tell stories that are real, that are diverse, that are something that people will be able to relate to.\n\nDoes your Mexican heritage influence your art in any other way?\n\nThe question of identity has been pervasive throughout my life. Growing up in high school, I couldn't really tell people that I was from Mexico, because I went to a public American high school when you're not supposed to commute across the border to go to school. I would go to class, be there for 10 hours, come back home to Mexico, do homework, and go to bed by like 10. It was when I started exploring darkroom photography that I first tried to incorporate my Mexican heritage with my work by learning from the work of past Mexican artists. For example, Armando Herrera invented what was essentially the first kind of Photoshop ever. After taking pictures, he would get big glass negatives and scratch the blemishes off the face of his models using a chisel. The results were these very characteristic portraits of the 40s and 50s in which people have beautiful porcelain faces. Thus, he defined the image of an entire generation in Mexico. And that’s what I want to do with my work, I want to be able to create iconic images that people can just look at and think “Oh, that’s Rommel.”\n\nHowever, a lot of the work I consume isn’t exclusively Mexican, so many different influences filter and mix into my pieces. And that is beautiful. In the end, I'm just concerned with telling good stories–stories that ring true to the people I'm concerned with. I want to use my art to learn more about different cultures, especially Latin American cultures. I know Mexico really well. But I want to have cultural conversations with people in Ecuador, people in Venezuela… I hope that, through my art, I will at least help other people see themselves represented on the screen."
