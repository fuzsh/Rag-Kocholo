Restore New York supports municipal revitalization efforts with funds to help remove and reduce blight, reinvigorate communities and generate new residential and economic opportunities statewide. The program, administered by Empire State Development, is designed to help local governments encourage new commercial investments through community revitalization, growing local housing, and putting properties back on the tax rolls to increase the local tax base.\n\n“Revitalizing and rehabilitating vacant and blighted areas of our communities brings new energy and investments that support local and regional growth,” Governor Hochul said. “Restore New York helps our municipalities plan for the future by catalyzing economic growth and supporting housing, businesses and cultural spaces. We are further unlocking the potential of these sites and communities across New York.\"\n\nAs Governor Hochul previously announced, Albany County was awarded a $10 million special project designation to support the safe demolition of the Albany Central Warehouse, a large blighted structure alongside I-787 in Albany. The long-vacant Central Warehouse is one of the first landmarks seen when entering the Capital Region, and its removal will encourage new investments and redevelopment of the site in a high growth area.\n\nEmpire State Development President, CEO and Commissioner Hope Knight said, \"Under Governor Hochul's leadership, New York State is building for the future by supporting projects that advance statewide priorities like increasing housing and revitalizing communities. Through the Restore New York Communities Initiative, we are working together with municipalities to remove blight and generate new investments to promote sustainable economic growth.\"\n\nHighlighted projects from each region are detailed below. View a full list of projects receiving funding here.\n\nThe Capital Region was awarded $16 million to support six projects, including:\n\nThe City of Albany was awarded $1.75 million to retrofit 28,000 square-feet of vacant buildings and land at 120 Madison Avenue and 135 South Pearl Street into a mixed-use development.

The county plans to invest in windows for this nine-story building, and the six vacant floors of the building can then be ready for the next phase of development that will include entertainment, lodging, food and hospitality.\n\nThe next round of the Restore New York program will launch this summer.\n\nThese awards complement Governor Hochul’s economic development vision by making strategic investments in communities across the State which revitalize the economy and create more opportunities for New Yorkers. The FY2025 Budget invests an additional $50 million in Restore New York, as well as $100 million for the Downtown Revitalization Initiative and $100 million for NY Forward.
