        "text": "Hey Frank,\n\nTwelve years ago I mailed in my license plate with the message “I don’t know where my home is” scrawled on the front. I had just dropped out of college and moved across the country to live with my dad.\n\nA lot has changed since then, but some things haven’t. My life imploded (again) and I found myself back in my dad’s house; I changed careers, graduated college, and went to grad school. But that secret has followed me for a decade, often featured on the website or exhibits. It popped up a few weeks ago and I thought “nothing has changed, I’m still just that lost kid” and then I realized how wrong I was.\n\nI’m not sure that I feel any more at home here now than I did back then, but something has changed. I found home in myself. Finally the skin that I live in feels like enough. Thank you for being a place of growth, love, and acceptance for all these years.\n\n-E\n\n~~~\n\nHey E-\n\nI know your secret well, it has been exhibited from the Smithsonian in Washington DC, to the Museum of Us (currently) in California. Like so many of the secrets I think we try to imagine the circumstances behind it, or project our lives onto it. So it’s really cool to hear from you over a decade later to learn the story (so far) behind your secret.\n\nRecently, we had your license plate professionally photographed. Soon it will be part of a large online exhibition of ‘naked mail’ (that’s what the post office calls it). I’ll include the photo below, along with a postcard that arrived recently that I feel speaks to your story.\n\nIt feels poetic that you wrote and mailed your secret on a license plate. Twelve years ago you started this long journey that gave you license to redefine your home – and your story.\n\nYour secret definitely has a home, so glad you found yours.\n\n-Frank\n\n“Life can only be understood backward, but it must be lived forward”\n\n–Kierkegaard\n\nThe PostSecret project began twenty years ago. I invited strangers to write a true secret on a postcard, decorate the card, and mail it anonymously to my home. Since 2004, hundreds have been arriving every week. Today, this 1,000,000+ collection of confessions is on exhibition at the Museum of Us. What started as a community art project became a website, six books, and live PostSecret events. At these events, I reveal the most extraordinary secrets I have received, share remarkable stories about the transformative power of our secrets, and invite audience members to stand at a microphone and tell a secret for the first time.\n\nI remember the first time I had two microphones on stage and asked if anyone wanted to walk up to share a secret. . .\n\nSilence.\n\nAnonymity was one of the keys that allowed people to find the confidence to release a confessional postcard to a stranger. But PostSecret presentations with full audiences offered zero anonymity. It took years of live events at colleges, museums, and bookstores to find ways to create a brave and uninhibited social space like the PostSecret blog I had created in the digital world. Some of the techniques I found that allowed strangers to feel more comfortable sharing were obvious, like moving the microphones from the stage to the back of the venue and lowering the lights. Other practices took longer to uncover and in hindsight were tied to experiences from my past.\n\nMy first job after college was selling cars at a Ford dealership. This was during the early days of the internet when nearly all sales were still made face-to-face. We were taught a three-step sales technique; first, get a prospect to fall in love with one particular car on the lot, second, ask this exact question, “What can I do to get you to drive off in this car today?” (Forty years later I still have it memorized.) And lastly, don’t speak first. We were told that if we could endure the awkward silence that was sure to follow that question, good things would happen. I only sold Fords for three months but in that time I became impervious to awkward silence. Years later at live events, I found if I could hold space for what seemed like an embarrassingly long time that first person would stand, take the long walk to the microphone, and open our public conversation of personal stories. After that others would quickly follow lining up to voice support or vulnerability. Courage is contagious and if I could ask my question, “Does anyone here tonight feel moved to share a secret?” and sit with the silence, good things would happen.\n\nI started volunteering on a crisis-intervention hotline while I was a college student. The countless conversations I had during my nightshift with strangers about emotions and experiences that were far beyond what I would ever talk about with friends or family felt like gifts but I almost failed hotline training before I could take my first call. Our class of twelve met for two weeks in a church basement with our instructor who told us the first night, “Not all of you will make it through to the phones”. We started by choosing hotline names to use with callers. I picked, “Mark” which was my brother’s name. Most of our learning came through role-playing exercises. Two chairs were placed facing away from each other. Our instructor sat in one and played the role of a caller while we took turns in the other chair trying to say the right things. When it was my turn in the ‘hot seat’ I was told I had a common failing. I didn’t listen to empathize, I listened to problem-solve. I had to learn not to seize on a solution but rather create a compassionate space to witness whatever hidden story or uncomfortable emotion might emerge. I was surprised by the hours spent coaching us to find our nonjudgmental voices and the number of times we had to be reminded, “Just listen”. What we said was often less important than how we said it. I haven’t told anyone my name is ‘Mark’ for decades, but I still use that same compassionate nonjudgmental hotline voice at every PostSecet event.\n\nWhen I started PostSecret my wife and I were emergency foster parents providing immediate home care for children who had suffered an acute family crisis. For three years we invited children to live with us until a permanent foster family could be found. Each child we shared our home with had different needs. We typically started with the most basic, making sure each child was hydrated, well-fed, well-rested, and had a secure room with privacy. After that, we tried to listen, build rapport, and demonstrate respect. Sometimes they wanted to be left alone, other times they wanted to play video games, but if they wanted to talk I stumbled upon a way to help build trust.\n\nDuring our conversation, I would find a way to share one of my true secrets with them.\n\nMaybe how I felt all alone after my parent’s divorce, or an embarrassing thing I said at the grocery store that day, or how being a volunteer on a crisis-line helped me as much as the people I spoke with. I found that if I took that vulnerable step first, it could be an invitation to a deeper conversation that helped us build understanding and goodwill. Secrets are the currency of intimacy.\n\nBeing nonjudgmental, sharing a true confession first, and holding space while others find the courage to share stories for the first time are trust unlocks that have allowed those of us in the PostSecret community to honor and celebrate our secrets at hundreds of PostSecret Live! events held around the world for over a decade. Some nights, these moments of revelation between strangers feel transformative, even sacred.\n\nWhen I started PostSecret I often wondered, “Why me”. I had no artistic training and was a busy father and struggling small business owner at the time. Why did this project find me? But looking back, I can see connections between past experiences and what I do today as the “PostSecret Guy”.\n\nOr maybe PostSecret was always my destiny. After all, my name, ‘Frank’, literally means “be honest” and “free postage”.\n\nThis San Diego event has sold-out (sorry/thanks) but you can learn about PostSecret Live! here or email me at frank(at)postsecret.com\n\nThank You, to everyone in the PostSecret community who has donated their money or time to suicide prevention. As someone who has answered those phones on the overnight shift, I can tell you, There Is Hope And There Is Help.\n\nIn the early aughts, Frank Warren ran a medical document delivery business in Germantown, Maryland. It was a monotonous job, involving daily trips to government offices to copy thousands of pages of journal articles for pharmaceutical companies, law firms, and non-profits. By his early forties, he had a house in a nice subdivision, a wife, a young daughter, and a dog. His family fostered children for a few weeks or months, and he felt a sense of purpose in helping kids who were suffering acute crises in their own homes. From the outside, things appeared to be going better than well. But inside, something was missing: A sense of adventure, or at least a little fun. An outlet to explore the weirder, darker, and more imaginative parts of his interior world. He’d never been one for small talk, preferring instead to launch into deep discussions, even with people he barely knew. He wondered if he could create a place like that outside of everyday conversation, a place full of awe, anguish, and urgency.\n\nIn the fall of 2004, Frank came up with an idea for a project. After he finished delivering documents for the day, he’d drive through the darkened streets of Washington, D.C., with stacks of self-addressed postcards—three thousand in total. At metro stops, he’d approach strangers. “Hi,” he’d say. “I’m Frank. And I collect secrets.” Some people shrugged him off, or told him they didn’t have any secrets. Surely, Frank thought, those people had the best ones. Others were amused, or intrigued. They took cards and, following instructions he’d left next to the address, decorated them, wrote down secrets they’d never told anyone before, and mailed them back to Frank. All the secrets were anonymous.\n\nInitially, Frank received about one hundred postcards back. They told stories of infidelity, longing, abuse. Some were erotic. Some were funny. He displayed them at a local art exhibition and included an anonymous secret of his own. After the exhibition ended, though, the postcards kept coming. By 2024, Frank would have more than a million.\n\nContinue Reading. . ."
