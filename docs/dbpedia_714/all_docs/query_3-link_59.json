        "text": "You’ve probably never heard of the movie that I’m most excited to see this summer. It’s titled “Thumbscrew,” and was directed by a shadowy auteur named Stanislas Cordova, a secretive genius whose dark art films are intensely studied by rabid fans known as Cordovites. “Thumbscrew” is about a woman who suspects her college-professor husband might be murdering young boys, and by all available accounts, it’s one serious creepfest. According to one person who has seen it, “Thumbscrew” is “an ominous tale of suspicion, paranoia, marriage and the inscrutability of the human psyche.” Cordova’s extensive filmography is so unnerving that there’s even speculation about whether his movies capture actual crimes rather than staged acts of violence.\n\nPerhaps you’re now as intrigued as I am. Well, too bad for both of us. Because “Thumbscrew” will not be coming soon to a theater near you. It won’t be making the film-festival rounds, nor will it be available on iTunes, Netflix or DVD. In fact, it doesn’t exist. The film — along with Cordova’s entire oeuvre and, for that matter, Cordova himself — was dreamed up by the author Marisha Pessl for her forthcoming novel, “Night Film” (out Aug. 20).\n\nThe inconvenient fact that Cordova is entirely fictional has not prevented me from getting strangely hooked on his work. Having finished “Night Film,” I now find myself a dedicated Cordovite, desperate to hunt down excellently titled obscurities like “At Night All Birds Are Black” and “Figures Bathed in Light.” But unless some brave, innovative movie studio decides to shoot adaptations of “Night Film” and “Thumbscrew” for simultaneous release (are you listening, brave, innovative movie studios?), Cordova’s films will forever remain in the realm of the imagination. Perhaps this suggests some undiagnosed O.C.D. tendencies, but I’m truly disappointed not to be able to plunk down an obscene amount of cash on a nicely packaged Criterion Collection Cordova DVD box set that could live on my shelves right next to “C.H.U.D.” and “The Conversation.”\n\nThis is frustrating, and it happens to me more often than you might think. I’m constantly falling for cultural artifacts that clever authors have cooked up for their novels. I become invested in these made-up movies and songs and books much the way I do with well-crafted characters — and I’m similarly sad to part with them when I finish the last chapter.\n\nI have fallen for the novels of the German cult writer Benno von Archimboldi (“Bifurcaria Bifurcata,” “The Return”), which are endlessly analyzed by devoted Archimboldians in Roberto Bolaño’s “2666.” I have ached to hear the collected output of the minor soul-music legend Barrett Rude Jr., “one of the most elusive and singular figures in pop-music history,” according to the critic Dylan Ebdus (as imagined by Jonathan Lethem in “Fortress of Solitude”). And I have labored through a significant chunk of David Foster Wallace’s epically detailed, 78-entry James O. Incandenza filmography in the footnotes of “Infinite Jest.” Two years after reading Dana Spiotta’s “Stone Arabia,” I’m still annoyed that I will never get to discover the music of the rock savant Nik Worth, who (in the novel) once fronted an almost-popular power-pop band called the Fakes and later created a homemade 20-volume album series called “The Ontology of Worth,” which would almost certainly be world-famous if only anyone had ever heard it. How thrilling it would be to stumble onto a garage-sale copy of a Fakes single (which in my mind might sound something like the Only Ones’ enduring real-life new wave masterpiece “Another Girl, Another Planet”) or — holy grail! — one of the “Ontology of Worth” discs. The world is a worse place for Nik’s sad lack of existence.\n\nRecently I read another summer novel, David Gilbert’s “& Sons” (out July 23), and again found myself falling into that familiar absurd yearning. The book’s central figure is an aging, Salinger-esque writer, A. N. Dyer, who, as his health declines, grapples with complexities involving family, friendships and his influential life’s work. Gilbert could have dealt with Dyer’s books as a necessary afterthought, tossing off some titles and quickly setting down to the real business of regret and death and endlessly messy human relationships. Instead, Gilbert really got into it. “& Sons ” conjures a career’s worth of drool-worthy fictional fiction that’s so convincingly evoked, I almost recall writing a paper on it in freshman English class. Gilbert pens large chunks of Dyer’s signature work, “Ampersand,” and describes other novels like “The Bend of Light” and “Here Live Angry Dogs and Brutal Men.” Here’s the tantalizing first (and sole extant) paragraph of a Dyer novel called “Dream Snap”:\n\n“Rather than one of those seed-filled tubes with holes and perches, his wife insisted on a miniature bird pavilion, two hundred dollars plus installation, which in her perfect world would attract Blue Jays and Cardinals, but in reality only charmed the crows who screeched like witches until Avery Price, on the sixteenth of July, chopped the [expletive] thing down.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
