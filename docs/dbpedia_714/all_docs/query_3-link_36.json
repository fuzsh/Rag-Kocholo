        "text": "The ocean looked especially lively. White horses rode hard towards rocks while the occasional spindrift lifted towards the sky. It was one of those days when the South Easter howled down False Bay and anyone with even a modicum of common sense would not attempt a swim. However, there I was on my deck at home, worrying about three people. Craig, Pippa and Roger, who were out there filming Craig in the water.\n\nThey were not auditioning for a Survivors type show, but filming Craig who had made a promise to himself that he would swim in the ocean every single day – no matter what. It was his way of dealing with a deep disconnect from nature and himself, and healing the physical and psychological pain that he was experiencing as a result. It was his happy place, even in moments like this, when the ocean looked like a washing machine.\n\nBy the time they started the edit, the octopus had passed away. Their lifespan is only about eighteen months. There were hundreds of hours of footage spanning years of Craig’s daily dives in the Seaforest and more recent experiences with octopus. This material required multiple viewings in order to identify a key narrative. It also required extensive scientific input in order to understand all of the complex animal behaviours Craig had captured on film.\n\nThe kelp forest, or Great African Seaforest, is a giant underwater forest home to an immense biodiversity and abundance of marine life. Over years of diving and exploring the intertidal zone, Craig had become a kind of citizen scientist, under the mentorship of Emeritus Professor Charles L. Griffiths of the Marine Biology Department at the University of Cape Town. In time, the Professor’s young PHD student, who has since graduated, Dr Jannes Landschoff started to work alongside Craig, helping him identify, classify and collate all of the animals and behaviours he was observing.\n\nCraig was doing something unique. Unlike a lot of scientists, he was in the ecosystem every day and was taking photographs and videos of everything he saw. It wasn’t rigorous scientific research, but it was immensely helpful in providing proof of certain observations and hypotheses, and in identifying new species and documenting animal behaviour.\n\nThis ecosystem is filled with tiny to medium-sized creatures who are mostly hiding from bigger predators that live in the forest. It’s not easy to find the animals you are trying to film. This is why Craig has spent years developing a system of underwater tracking, which allows him to find even the most cryptic creatures – including an 8-armed, shape-shifting, almost invisible cephalopod. Pippa spent months learning to track octopuses with Craig.\n\nA lot of the action and behaviour takes place in relatively shallow water. Filming requires careful movement and with certain animals, you need to get into tiny spaces. For many shots, this precluded the big camera rigs used in most natural history filmmaking. Using smaller gear also meant that Craig could shoot without scuba and not use a wetsuit. Over years of daily diving he has adapted his body to cope with the cold. Pippa had also trained her body in this way and all of the filming that they did together involved no wetsuits or scuba gear. This meant that Pippa was having a fully immersive experience the entire time she was directing and editing the film. The incredible, cinematic material shot by Roger on a RED Dragon with all of the usual filming equipment required for a big-camera setup.\n\nApart from some incredible shoots with Roger, Craig was on his own during most of his time with the octopus. For certain shots he was able to place the camera on the seafloor and capture their interactions, but at the time he was not thinking of creating a feature doc, so these shots were precious and rare and are certainly some of the most powerful scenes in the film. To tell the rest of the story, it required months of additional filming, mostly focused on Craig. Many of the underwater shots were filmed by Pippa and Tom, Craig’s son, captured the drone sequences.\n\nOn a couple of special occasions when the water clarity was especially good, or to film Craig with the seals, Roger came out with his RED. Additional material was also required to showcase the kelp forest itself: generic shots of the Seaforest, other animals and their behaviour and highly specialised long lens shots.\n\nWith many terabytes of footage to sift through, a plethora of potential narrative threads and the complicated life histories of two very different species to weave into one story, getting the narrative right was a daunting task. This is when Pippa stepped in with a critical eye and her gift for telling stories\n\nDaily debates that went on well into the night between Craig, Pippa and I became normal. There were so many angles and dramatic moments and complex back stories that it was hard to find one cohesive thread. Most importantly, where did the story begin? Was it with the San people who first introduced Craig to tracking and the wonders of what deep nature connection actually meant? Was it during Craig’s childhood on the shore of the seaforest? The beginning of the film was debated and scrutinised and recut over and over again – far more than any part of the story.\n\nMany beautiful sequences were cut and discussed and reworked and eventually discarded because despite being fascinating, they were not part of the core narrative: the story of Craig and the octopus. It was her who had drawn him deepest into the underwater world and the invisible “mind” of nature. She was his “Octopus Teacher”.\n\nThe first rough version of the film took a full year to edit. After months of shaping and crafting, this draft, although very powerful, was deemed too esoteric and inaccessible for a wider audience. Craig – in fact all of us – were having deeply powerful experiences in the wild, but this was proving difficult to convey to viewers who didn’t have a similar frame of reference.\n\nWe realised that the best way to get the power of these experiences across was to focus on the octopus’ story and tell it in the most emotive and authentic way we could. If viewers were drawn into the story, they would be more likely to absorb the larger ideas of deep nature connection, spiritual awakening and transformation and healing through having a relationship with the natural world. If we were too overt with these messages, we could make viewers uncomfortable and the whole story might get lost on them.\n\nOne of the toughest debates focused on how to convey the conservation aspects of the film and how much of an overt message to have. At the time of editing, there was a thriving octopus fishery operating in False Bay and within 10 days we witnessed 2 whales being dragged out of the water after becoming entangled in octopus trap lines and drowning. This was disturbing for us on both a personal and environmental level. For Craig and I, it seemed like it would have to find a place in the film, but Pippa was adamant that this story would overwhelm the more profound message that she was trying to explore around the transformative power of nature and the idea that as humans, we are part of the natural world. Pippa believed that if we told the story right, the conservation narrative would be embedded inside of it without needing to be vocal about conventional, often polarising environmental issues.\n\nFrom the beginning there had been questions around how the story should be told. Would it be a natural history film with a conventional voice-over? Should Craig appear in an interview? How about others who had met the octopus and been part of Craig’s journey? Should they appear on camera as well? A few rough edits of just the first minutes made it clear including other characters was both confusing and diluted the story.\n\nFor Craig, this was a new experience. He was an experienced filmmaker and had spent thousands of hours behind a camera and while all of his films explore the interface between humans and the wild world, he had never been the subject of his story before. The idea of being on camera as a central character, rather than just narrating in the background was intimidating for him. But slowly he got used to the idea and it seemed more and more important for giving the film an authentic and accessible voice. Pippa tried to interview Craig on a number of occasions, but because she already knew him and the story so well, these interviews just didn’t seem to work. Eventually they settled on an alternative approach that involved voice-over with shots of Craig in the story, but never speaking directly to camera. While the narrative was strong and emotive, something just didn’t feel right. Without seeing Craig speaking to the camera there was not a deep enough authenticity to the story. We needed an interview, but we knew that Pippa was not the right person to do it.\n\nThe score for My Octopus Teacher was composed by Kevin Smuts, a composer whom Craig and I had worked with on several other projects. Although young, Kevin has one of the finest sensibilities. He was approached very early in the production and in the beginning he worked with another composer called Matt Dennis who also made some beautiful tracks for the film, but by the time the budget came through, Matt had moved on to other work and so it was up to Kevin to compose the entire score for this massive project on his own. This was a daunting task, made more intimidating by the many experienced ears that were giving him inputs from all over the world. Tom Foster, Craig’s son who had composed a more raw, elemental piece of music using only kelp and water sounds for an earlier version of the edit was asked to compose two small pieces for the film. He also recorded notes and sounds using the kelp which Kevin incorporated into his music to create authentic soundscapes in some of the more eerie, ominous scenes.\n\nLater, Ronan Skillen, a master percussionist recorded live radio sequences using his collection of exotic instruments to add to the atmosphere of the soundtrack in key places.\n\nWhile all of this work was going into the offline edit, the enormous task of the online was also looming. With Netflix on board, the technical demands of a modern media giant had to be met and with so many cameras and formats from a library of footage that had been collected over nearly 10 years, the team was nervous. How would they match the colours from all of these different cameras? Would the film meet the required technical specs and could it pass Quality Control?\n\nAlthough this had become an international production, it was important to Craig and Pippa to run the online edit in South Africa and not send it outside the country. We were put in touch with Jade Kohler, a producer at The Refinery, an online production house in Cape Town who are experienced with delivering programs to international broadcasters. This world-class team is headed up by Lauren van Rensburg. Kyle Stroebel, a young genius Baselight colorist had the enormous task of making 20 different camera systems look like one. The project became his passion and he did extraordinary work on the film, going far beyond the call of duty to make sure that every shot matched and had the right feeling and tone to tell the story. Lauren, Jade, Kyle and the rest of their team ran a seamless post production process and were extremely generous with their time and energy. In the end, delivery took a full 6 months, but the film passed with flying colours, despite Netflix’ stringent quality control procedures. In fact, Netflix commented on the ease, professionalism and high quality of the production.\n\nFor sound, there was really only one consideration: Barry Donnelly, an international award-winning sound engineer who had worked on all of Craig’s previous films. He also grew up playing with Craig’s younger brother at the bungalow that appears in the early scenes of the film. Before sound design began, Barry ventured out into the kelp forest with Craig so that he could hear firsthand what an octopus’ world sounds like. He recorded some sounds in the field and worked with foley artist Charl Mostert to recreate others in his studio. In the end he created an audioscape with more than 150 layers that would transport viewers to The Great African Seaforest through their ears."
