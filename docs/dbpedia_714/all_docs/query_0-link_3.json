        "text": "Director: Robert McKimson\n\nRelease Date: April 12, 1947\n\nStars: Daffy Duck\n\nRating: ★★★\n\nReview:\n\nDaffy Duck tricks a dog called Leopold with a ‘poisoned bone’ to let him stay at his house during the winter.\n\nUnfortunately, the dog’s owner is an evil scientist (a caricature of Peter Lorre) who happens to be looking for a duck’s wishbone. This leads to a wild chase full of pretty weird gags and off-beat dialogue penned by Warren Foster.\n\n‘Birth of a Nation’ is the second of two Warner Bros. cartoons featuring Peter Lorre as a mad scientist, the other being ‘Hair-Raising Hare’ from 1946. New voice artist Stan Freberg does an excellent job in mimicking and parodying Lorre’s typical voice.\n\nWatch ‘Birth of a Notion’ yourself and tell me what you think:\n\nThis is Daffy Duck cartoon No. 36\n\nTo the previous Daffy Duck cartoon: The Great Piggy Bank Robbery\n\nTo the next Daffy Duck cartoon: Along Came Daffy\n\n‘Birth of a Notion’ is available on the DVD-set ‘Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume Six’"
