        "text": "Bugs Bunny: Superstar - Wikipedia\n\nContemporary critics pointed out that Bob Clampett's important role as one of the primary developers of the early Warner cartoons was noticeably slanted due to his prominent presence in Bugs Bunny: Superstar. In an audio commentary recorded for the 2012 DVD release, Larry Jackson claimed that in order to secure Clampett's participation and access to Clampett's collection of Warners history (memorabilia, drawings, films, photographs etc.), he had to sign a contract that stipulated Clampett would host the documentary, select the cartoons featured, and have approval over the final cut. Jackson further claimed that Clampett was very reluctant to speak about the other directors and their contributions. According to Jackson, Clampett was \"insecure\" about his place in the legacy of Warner Brothers cartoons. Furthermore, several of the cartoons featured in Bugs Bunny: Superstar are the \"Blue Ribbon\" versions which lack opening titles (including director credits). However, the three Clampett-directed cartoons are the original versions, preserving Clampett's director credit.\n\nThe documentary infuriated many of the Warner Brothers artists, as Clampett liberally took credit for several iconic Warner characters. Clampett implied that he was the creator of Bugs Bunny, claiming that he used Clark Gable's carrot-eating scene in It Happened One Night as inspiration for the character. (Although he never made the claim in Bugs Bunny: Superstar itself, Clampett further took credit for drawing the model sheet for the first Porky Pig cartoon I Haven't Got a Hat (1935), even though it was actually drawn by Friz Freleng.) Subsequently, Chuck Jones, who already had a strong dislike for Clampett, pointedly left out Clampett's name in the 1979 compilation film The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie when Bugs discusses his \"fathers\" (i.e. Jones and other Warner's directors), and similarly omitted any mention of Clampett in his 1989 autobiography Chuck Amuck. Although Chuck Jones opted to not contribute to Bugs Bunny: Superstar, Larry Jackson claimed he remained friends with Chuck Jones for many years.​\n\nI agree that Maltese seems to be a consistent link to their great cartoons (used by Jones and Clampett). Lots of egos clashing, but there was plenty of credit to spread around -nobody their worked in a bubble. Even Bob McKimson seldom gets his due, yet for a few years he made some of the funniest cartoons at Warner Brothers and did much to visually streamline Bugs Bunny into the final, most pleasing form we all know and love.\n\nCompletely agreed. McKimson's best cartoons during his first five (or so) years as director stand up to any during the same period (plus, I'm a sucker for Richard H. Thomas backgrounds). It's only later on that his films became what I'd call stagnant and you could tell he was just churning out these toons as a job. Of course, there were later period masterpieces, as well (\"The Hole Idea,\" for instance).\n\nStill, for me, these are hard to beat:\n\nDaffy Doodles\n\nEaster Yeggs\n\nHillbilly Hare\n\nHot Cross Bunny\n\nWhat's Up Doc? (a top 5 WB cartoon for me)\n\nWalky Talky Hawky\n\nBirth of a Notion\n\nHurdy Gurdy Hare\n\nA Ham In a Role\n\nOne Meat Brawl\n\nDaffy Duck Slept Here\n\nRebel Rabbit\n\nThe Foghorn Leghorn\n\nBoobs In the Woods\n\nDaffy Duck Hunt\n\nThe Windblown Hare\n\nGorilla My Dreams\n\nA-Lad In His Lamp\n\nRabbit's Kin\n\nGreat list! Boobs In The Woods is a personal favorite.\n\nMy take on this is that the origins of the WB characters are less important than the different approaches directors/writers have taken to them.\n\nAs great as the work of Avery (who was better at MGM), Clampett, Tashlin (doesn't get enough credit as he left to direct live action films) etc. was, I think Chuck Jones stands above them all as the most consistent and creative of them all.\n\nChuck's cartoons looked the best of the UPA-influenced post 1950 works. As for the writer/director dichotomy, anyone who has read interviews with him or his book, Chuck Amuck, would appreciate that with his deep insight into characters he would have had more than a little influence on the scripts.\n\nCartoons like the 'Hunting Season' trilogy with Bugs, Daffy and Elmer, 'Duck Amuck', 'Robin Hood Daffy' and 'What's Opera Doc' represent the greatest use of Warner Bros characters, as well as being among the greatest cartoons full stop.\n\nJones also made some wonderful cartoons with his own exclusive characters like Marc Anthony the bulldog and Claude the cat. Add to those some marvelous one offs like 'Much Ado About Nutting' and 'One Froggy Evening' and I think the case for Chuck is well made.\n\nHe also happened to make my all time favorite cartoon, 'Chow Hound' (\"This time, we didn't forget the gravy...\").\n\nMike Barrier is a very nice man and an excellent writer who has authored some of the best books ever written on animation history. It's fair to say that any interviewer can only report on the \"truth\" as it's told to them by their subjects. No question, Bob Clampett did exaggerate on many occasions, but he was one of several creators of Bugs Bunny and other characters. Still, I think he had a tendency to grossly inflate his importance during his brief years at Warner Bros. Still, Clampett's cartoons were hilarious and very important, and no question they did have some influence over what followed (as did all the directors at the studio). [I think the unsung hero of WB was Bob McKimson, both as an animator and as a director, and his 1940s work was absolutely impeccable.]\n\nBTW, Stan Freberg was one of the nicest guys in the history of showbiz, and both he and noted voice actor Daws Butler were very annoyed that Bob Clampett kind of left them out of the revival of Beany & Cecil as a cartoon show, four years after the live TV puppet show the three of them had done together. Clampett also took a lot of credit for the characters, omitting the fact that Freberg and Butler both did quite a bit of uncredited writing work and ad-libbing, which helped make the puppet show a relative success. Freberg was always reluctant to say anything bad about anybody, but if you asked him about Clampett, he'd just shrug and say, \"you know, that was a long time ago. Let's talk about something else.\"\n\nYep, Hillbilly Hare, directed by Bob McKimson. Hands-down, one of the best WB cartoons in history, very high on my list. Here's a short clip:\n\nI've seen this thing fifty times and it's still funny.\n\nI have to say, as much as I love Chuck Jones' films, his work was a lot less once Mike Maltese moved on and no longer wrote his films or contributed gags.\n\nNaw, Tex Avery's gags are never too much.\n\nThanks for posting these letters and interviews... Had Never seen them before...\n\nMade me pull and page thru my old dusty autographed \"Chuck Amuck\" book,\n\ngot it when he did a rare book signing at some gallery in 1989.\n\n(He was also selling some 'updated' cells)\n\nGot to meet him, shake hands, hear him share stories, and got to tell him how much all the work at Termite Terrace meant to me, was something I’ll never forget.\n\nInside my book, Found a 30 year old yellowed notepad page.\n\nIt reads: (EVERYBODY SING!)\n\n“What’s Up Doc?\n\nWhat’s Cooking”\n\nWhat’s Up Doc?\n\nAre you looking?\n\nFor Bugs Bunny bunting\n\nDoc is going hunting\n\nJust to get a rabbit skin\n\nBut now the rabbits gone again\n\nWhat’s Up Doc?\n\nWhat’s Cooking?\n\nHey! Look Out! Stop!\n\nYou’re Gonna Hurt Someone!\n\nWith that Old Shot Gun!\n\nEh What’s Up Doc?!\n\nWe Really Mean It!\n\nWhat’s! Up! Doc!\n\n[redacted]\n\nI read a story, maybe in Maltin's book \"Of Mice And Magic\", where the fallout between Foster and Pierce is described when they ended their writing partnership and Pierce was told essentially to f/off by Foster and to quit riding his coat tails."
