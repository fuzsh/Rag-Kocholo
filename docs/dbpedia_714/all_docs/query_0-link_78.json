        "text": "Art History Courses\n\nARTH 10100. Introduction to Art. 100 Units.\n\nThis course develops skills in perception, comprehension, and evaluation of various art objects and the built environment. It encourages close analysis of visual materials, exploring the range of questions and methods appropriate to works of art and buildings, in their historical, theoretical, and social dimensions. Most importantly, the course emphasizes articulate writing and salient argumentation about visual and other aesthetic phenomena. Three coherent units, on Monument/Site, Image/Medium, and Object/Museum, explore these issues across cultures and periods. Examples draw on original objects in campus collections and sites on campus.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Spring\n\nNote(s): Students must attend first class to confirm enrollment. This course meets the general education requirement in the arts.\n\nARTH 10701. Sound and the Built Environment. 100 Units.\n\nSound and the Built Environment examines the role of sound at all scales of the built world from the room to the city. This course highlights a sound studies approach in which students will learn how to listen deeply, an act of resistance in a culture that suffers from primacy of the visual. Students will also learn about concepts such as the soundscape, how to read a room intuitively through basic concepts of acoustics (reverberation, clarity, balance, etc), the history of buildings designed purposefully for sound, and the role sound plays in urban life throughout history. Deliverables for this course include a sound studies portion in which students will examine soundscapes that impact their lives in Chicago, and a design portion in which students re-evaluate spaces around Chicago through an acoustics lens.\n\nInstructor(s): K.

The Built Environment in the Ancient Greek World. 100 Units.\n\nHow are we to understand the ancient Greek world and how it was shaped and inhabited? How can the study of the past inform our perception of the present world around us? This course introduces students to the built environment of the ancient Greek world through the study of the architecture, monuments, and urban forms developed in the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods. Rather than solely focusing on examples from the ancient Aegean, this course will take a geographically broad perspective that spans from Sicily to Afghanistan to highlight the diversity of styles and cultural influences incorporated into Greek architecture and urban development. This topic will be approached thematically, ranging from the architecture of sanctuaries to monuments in public spaces to modern receptions of ancient Greek architecture.\n\nInstructor(s): L. Ladge Terms Offered: Winter\n\nARTH 14201. In and Out: Supply and Waste in 21st Century Dwelling. 100 Units.\n\nIn the next 25 years, give or take, the world's population is expected to reach 10 billion souls. 68% of these people, roughly 6.8 billion people, will be living in cities. The challenges of energy, transportation, food production and distribution, shelter are the IN and are, typically, the focus of architecture and its related disciplines. What about the OUT? Fuel emissions, food waste, human waste (solid and liquid), human remains, medical waste, thermal by-products of heating, cooling and manufacture, not to mention building waste to produce housing for 10 billion are the focus of this studio. As we urbanize, as cities expand, as the space for containing waste is ever more remote and the waste itself ever more copious, how do we manage, control or even understand the problem? This course will look at the challenges facing our cities as both recursive and emergent. The scale of these issues is of unprecedented magnitude, though not new in principle. As a practical matter, any solution must simultaneously reference contemporary approaches to waste management and urban sustenance and ancient practices of integration, symbiosis and elimination\n\nInstructor(s): K.

Introduction to the Arts of the Italian Renaissance. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will cover the major themes and works of the Italian Renaissance, including painting, sculpture, decorative arts, and architecture. We will consider stylistic development of the arts from the period of roughly 1300 (late Medieval/pre-Renaissance predecessors) to 1560. Throughout the course we will interrogate the concept of \"Renaissance\" as a unifying term and examine its relationship to the Medieval in terms of both continuity and change. A major focus of the course will be the functions of different media in this time period, and we will consider patronage, multiple viewerships, and access. We will explore how, for whom, and why works were created, and interrogate the relevance of the category 'fine arts' as it is commonly understood to the Renaissance. Additional themes will be: artistic practice, especially collaboration and competition; regional styles; the relationship of art in this period to the intellectual, political, and spiritual climate(s) of the time.\"\n\nTerms Offered: Summer\n\nARTH 14413. Global Pop. 100 Units.\n\nWhen you hear the words \"Pop Art,\" what comes to mind? Soup cans, comic book panels, portraits of Marilyn Monroe, enormous paper clips? These are some of the most iconic examples of Pop Art made in the United States. Since the 1960s, artists around the world have also explored art's relationship to mass media, consumerism, and representation. This course will examine the work of artists outside of the Euro-American canon who have employed Pop Art strategies. We will cover a wide geographic and temporal expanse, with a special focus on Latin America, and including as well art from East Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.\n\nInstructor(s): A. Obiols Roca Terms Offered: Spring\n\nARTH 14707. Meiji Modern: Reassessing Common Narratives of Japanese Art. 100 Units.\n\nThis course is taught in tandem with the traveling exhibition \"Meiji Modern: Fifty Years of New Japan,\" shown at The David and Alfred Smart Museum of Art, open from March 21st, 2024, to June 9th, 2024. Through the exhibition and its objects, the course will contemplate and question the canonization of Meiji art (and the common narratives of art that are engrained in one's mind). The main pedagogical approach used in this course is visual analysis. Students are required to visit the museum and interact with the actual objects, which will help solidify abstract concepts of Meiji artworks learned in class. While this course is not intended to survey Japanese art history, it aims to equip students with skills that will enable them to ask art-historical questions. Students majoring in art history may also benefit from taking this course, as it is an excellent opportunity to understand what one misses when one cannot access physical artwork.\n\nInstructor(s): M. Egashira Terms Offered: Spring\n\nARTH 15401. The Matter of Medium: Contexts and Making of Medieval Art. 100 Units.\n\nThis course is an introduction to the art of medieval Europe, covering the period from the Fall of the Roman Empire to the eve of the Reformation (c. 500-1500). Approaching medieval art as image-bearing objects, we will explore a range of visual material, luxury and mass produced, including manuscript illuminations, prints, relics and reliquaries, pilgrimage souvenirs, altarpieces, paintings, and architecture. What was the role of medium and materials in serving and shaping the spiritual needs and practices of medieval audiences? In a period of pervasive image anxiety, what issues arose when earthly matter was asked to picture the immaterial sublime? Through lectures, reading, discussion, and hands-on sessions with period materials, students are introduced to major themes in the study of the art and architecture of the Middle Ages: economic and social structures of making, reception of images and viewing conventions, theories of the image, gender, and the relationship between text and image. Beyond the medieval context, we will also follow the lives and afterlives of several medieval objects by looking at their re-use and re-interpretation across space and time.\n\nInstructor(s): C. Tom Terms Offered: Winter\n\nARTH 15630. Introduction to South Asian Art: Part I. 100 Units.\n\nThis core class introduces students to the visual arts of early, ancient, and early medieval South Asia. In this massive time period, South Asia gave birth to three major world religions-Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism. Christianity and Islam too made it to South Asia and the arts of these religious traditions flourished in various pockets of the Indian subcontinent. In the class, we will look at objects, buildings, and things that continue to beguile researchers, such as the paintings of Bhimbetka Caves (10,000 BCE); the enigmatic seals from Indus Valley (ca. 2000 BCE); the high polish of Mauryan sculptures, like the Ashokan capital that forms the emblem of India (ca. 3rd cent. BCE); the extraordinary rock-cut temples of Ajanta and Ellora (fifth to thirteenth centuries); and the famous minarets of Jam and Qutb in Afghanistan and Delhi (twelfth century). While the course will explore many themes, some prominent ones will be the role of politics, nature, and religion in shaping artistic practices. Conversely, we will also look at how artistic practices impacted the experience and understanding of state formation, natural resources, and religious practices.\n\nInstructor(s): M. Manohar Terms Offered: Winter\n\nARTH 15635. Introduction to South Asian Art: Part II. 100 Units.\n\nThis core class will pick up the narrative thread from Introduction to South Asian Art: Part I, although taking Part I is not a pre-requisite (but encouraged). We will cover the period of South Asian art from the fourteenth century until the present day. During the period covered in this class, European explorers landed on Indian coasts, with the Portuguese making it to India as early as 1498. (Christopher Columbus tried to get to India too, but as is well known, he got massively lost.) From the fifteenth century, with European forays into the Americas, the world order changed dramatically, and South Asia-and its artistic culture-benefited from being a commercial hub. South Asian patrons commissioned such extraordinarily expensive buildings and objects as the Taj Mahal (completed 1653) and the Peacock Throne (1635; the Kohinoor diamond from this throne forms the centerpiece of the British crown jewels). Equally, climate crises and colonial exploitation from as early as the seventeenth century left its marks in the art of the region. The modern period saw anticolonial resistance, the emergence of postcolonial nation states, as well as the dispersal of a vast South Asian diasporic community across the world. Art making and architectural practice responded to each of these historical shifts, and this class will examine what the visual art from South Asia can teach us about its complex history from the late medieval period up to the present day.\n\nInstructor(s): M. Manohar Terms Offered: Spring\n\nARTH 15706. Skills & Processes for Architecture and Urban Design. 100 Units.\n\nThis studio course seeks to acquaint students with a range of skills and methods in design, including manual, digital and hybrid methods. Students will test out several design processes through a series of problem sets and micro-projects, and develop their own personal tools and ways as they go. An emphasis will be put on free play and experimentation, followed by rounds of revision and refinement. We will also consider how historical research, precedent, context and constraint can help meaningfully inform design process, without overly paralyzing it. This is an excellent course to take if you are interested in other studio design courses (such as courses listed ARCH 2419X and ARCH 24267), but want to build up your skills before undertaking a major, quarter-long project.\n\nInstructor(s): S.

Western Modern Art from the Enlightenment until Today. 100 Units.\n\nSurveying the history of modern Western art from the 18th through the 21st century, this course will introduce students to the artists, art works, and issues central to the relationship between art and modernity: the rise of the self and identity politics, the growth of the metropolis, the questioning of the \"real\" and the invention of photography, the autonomous thrust and semiotic potential of abstraction, the political ambitions of the avant-garde, and the impact of consumer and media cultures. Most discussion sections will center around original works of art and take place in the Smart Museum of Art.\n\nInstructor(s): C. Mehring Terms Offered: Winter\n\nNote(s): Students must attend first class to confirm enrollment. This course meets the general education requirement in the arts.\n\nARTH 15800. Contemporary Art. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will consider the practice and theory of visual art in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Among the subjects that will drive our narrative will be the rise of postmodernism, pop art, the aesthetics of the social movements of the 1960s, institutional critique, the relationship between reproductive media and Feminism, the concept of spectacle, conceptual art, the appearance of a global art industry after 1989, the connections between art school and art-making, \"relational aesthetics,\" the fate of art in the age of the Internet, the art of the post-studio moment, and what happens to art when it engages with *everything*.\n\nInstructor(s): M.

Art of Mesoamerica. 100 Units.\n\nThis course provides an introduction to the art and architecture of Mesoamerica, a region that encompasses much of modern-day Mexico and northern Central America. We will examine sculpture, painting, architecture, ceramics, and other arts of the Olmec, Maya, Aztec, and other Mesoamerican civilizations over a period of three millennia, from ca. 1500 B.C. to the time of the Spanish invasion in 1519. We will study sacred art, courtly art, architecture and urbanism, writing systems and their relation to images, and the interactions between artistic traditions.\n\nInstructor(s): C.

Art of the East: China. 100 Units.\n\nThis course is an introduction to the arts of China focusing on the bronze vessels of the Shang and Zhou dynasties, the Chinese appropriation of the Buddha image, and the evolution of landscape and figure painting traditions. This course considers objects in contexts (from the archaeological sites from which they were unearthed to the material culture that surrounded them) to reconstruct the functions and the meanings of objects, and to better understand Chinese culture through the objects it produced.\n\nInstructor(s): W.

Moving Objects, Dispersed Cultures: Case Studies from China and the Middle East. 100 Units.\n\nThis course introduces big problems created by the movement, relocation or displacement of objects that are assigned special cultural, artistic, and historical values in new contexts. Such objects are often used as historical sources to justify the present, generating competing claims about the past while also raising problems and questions of preservation, ownership, copyright, and access. This class will ask how objects move from their original place to modern collections. How do they become art or part of cultural heritages? And how do they become historical sources? To address these complex issues, we will examine case studies of \"moving objects\" from two different geographies and historical contexts, China and the Middle East, in a comparative framework. We will discuss both historical and art historical questions stemming from specific objects and their stories in those two regions. We will talk about objects that were forced to move, relocated, or displaced, thereby their significance and value transform or take on new meanings. The dispersal and replication of moving objects in various collections is especially relevant today, with the creation of different types of digital replicas.\n\nInstructor(s): W.C. Lin & C. Palombo Terms Offered: Winter\n\nARTH 16800. Arts of Japan. 100 Units.\n\nThis course surveys the arts of the Japanese archipelago through the study of selected major sites and artifacts. We will consider objects in their original contexts and in the course of transmission and reinterpretation across space and time. How did Japanese visual culture develop in the interaction with objects and ideas from China, Korea, and the West? Prehistoric artifacts, the Buddhist temple, imperial court culture, the narrative handscroll, the tea ceremony, folding screens, and woodblock prints are among the topics covered.\n\nInstructor(s): C.

This course meets the general education requirement in the arts.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): EALC 16806\n\nARTH 16911. Modeling Contemporary Japanese Architecture. 100 Units.\n\nThis undergraduate seminar focuses on contemporary Japanese architecture. It builds on an association between three main pedagogies for the study of architecture: observation, critical reading, and modeling.Our discussions will focus primarily on buildings and works by individual architects and artists that are currently active in Japan and whose work contributes to a broader understanding of architecture as a creative field. Special emphasis will be given to the work of a younger generation of Japanese architects who are currently exerting a significant impact on the development of contemporary Japanese culture.The seminar recognizes the broad use and potential of architectural scale models and intends to use them as a central tool for investigation. Students will analyze buildings through various forms of model making.The construction of physical, three-dimensional scale models will provide a useful platform to further develop insights gained through reading, class discussions, and in-depth study of architectural representations.\n\nInstructor(s): Erez Golani Solomon Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ARCH 16911\n\nARTH 17121. The Art of Leonardo da Vinci. 100 Units.\n\nThe central focus of this course will be on the small, damaged and disputed body of paintings that Leonardo has left to us, the wealth of his drawings that help us make sense of that problematic heritage and provide the most direct route into his creative thinking, and the hundreds of pages of text in the form of notes in mirror-image handwriting that comment on art and so many other subjects. Our structure will be roughly chronological, including his late fifteenth-century Florentine artistic and social context; his two long periods in Milan as a court artist; his triumphant return to Florence and rivalry with the young Michelangelo; his brief and unsatisfying stay in papal Rome; and his final years in France. Among the themes that will be critically examined are: Leonardo's role in the creation of what is still grandiosely called the High Renaissance; the value and problematic aspects of thinking of him as the quintessential artist-scientist; the significance of the fact that he has been a figure of such obsessive art-historical and broader cultural significance for over 500 years; and the ways in which recent scientific examination and digital imaging have shed surprising amounts of new light on his art. Through the concentrated study of the works of Leonardo and his artistic context, the course will take seriously the attempt to introduce students with little or no background in art history to some of the major avenues for analysis and interpretation in this field.\n\nInstructor(s): C. Cohen Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nPrerequisite(s): Students must attend first class to confirm enrollment. This course meets the general education requirement in the arts.

Sixty years later it was the most powerful state in Europe. This course will provide an overview of French art in this period. Three themes will predominate: the rise of philosophical skepticism (pyrrhonisme) and the New Science, and their impact on ideas of painting; the relationship between new \"practices of the self\" and practices of knowledge; and political centralization and the emergence of the police state. We will discuss major artists like Nicolas Poussin, Philippe de Champaigne, Georges de la Tour, Claude Lorraine, and Charles Le Brun, as well as lesser-known figures like Laurent de la Hyre, Lubin Baugin, Eustache Le Sueur, and Valentin de Boulogne. Readings will be drawn largely from primary sources, all in translation.\n\nInstructor(s): R. Neer Terms Offered: Spring\n\nPrerequisite(s): Students must attend first class to confirm enrollment. This course meets the general education requirement in the arts.\n\nNote(s): This course will take place in Paris.\n\nARTH 17307. Death and Dying in the Middle Ages. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will explore the relationship between the visual arts and culture of death in the western Middle Ages. Death did not mark a firm end for medieval people, whose daily lives included ideas about the Resurrection, revenants, and saints - a special class of holy undead. We will turn to the visual arts as a privileged medium for commemorating and caring for the dead in order to chart changing conceptions of death and the afterlife from roughly the third century to 1500 CE. We will study a variety of works of art, from manuscripts to sculptures, textiles to poems, drawn from different regions throughout medieval Europe. Examining primary sources (in translation) and relevant secondary literature, students will hone their abilities to comprehend the past through historical objects and to understand the particular role that works of art played in mediating the relationships between the living and the dead. Special topics include reliquaries, necromancy, the Apocalypse, and the Black Death\n\nInstructor(s): T. Golan Terms Offered: Spring\n\nARTH 17412. U.S. LatinX Art. 100 Units.\n\nThis course explores the history of artistic production of Latin American diasporic communities living in the U.S. over the course of the twentieth century and up to our present. How have Latinx artists advanced, challenged, and/or undermined the development of U.S.-American art? How did Latinx artists in the U.S. operate both in dialogue with and independently from artists working in Latin America? Where did the agendas of Latin American expatriates and exiles, immigrants, and U.S. nationals of Latin American heritage intersect and where did they diverge? Exploring a wide range of artistic mediums (painting, sculpture, photography, printmaking, murals, performance, installation, video) we will trace a history of modern and contemporary art through the work of artists whose heritage spans diverse Latinx cultures, including but not limited to: Chicanx, Nuyorican, Afro-Latinx, and Cuban-American. We will consider the ways that art helps us to unpack and push against the notion of Latinx identity and how it helps us tell a story of Latinx culture and experience in the U.S.\n\nInstructor(s): M. Borowitz Terms Offered: Winter\n\nARTH 17608. Encountering Islamic Art in France, 11th-21st Century. 100 Units.\n\nIslamic artworks have been among the prized possessions of French collections from the medieval period to the present, but, as the reasons they have entered these collections have changed, so have the institutional spaces that frame how they might be encountered. In the first week, we study Islamic rock crystals and oliphants that were once in medieval French treasuries, and visit the Basilica of Saint Denis. In the second, we study Islamic ceramics, textiles, and works on paper that inspired French designers and painters, and visit the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Dijon. Finally, we study select works that have recently been exhibited for the explicit purpose of cultural ambassadorship, and visit l'Institut du Monde Arabe. How do the formal qualities of specific works themselves relate to the ways that institutional spaces can inflect their resonance?\n\nInstructor(s): P. Berlekamp Terms Offered: Spring\n\nNote(s): This course will take place in Paris\n\nARTH 17721. Groundwork: Infrastructure, Aesthetics, and the Built Environment. 100 Units.\n\nInfrastructures are conduits; they carry physical things like water, people, commodities, energy, and waste. But despite appearances, infrastructures are anything but neutral. Pipes, wires, and roads also carry beliefs about how the world should work and for whom it should function, designs that fix into place ideas about commercial circulation, social care, political representation, spatial organization, and economic development. This course will provide a thematic overview of the constructed networks that support the modern built environment, while simultaneously considering the social, spatial, and aesthetic implications of these encompassing systems. Through a historical survey of critical sites-the road, the bridge, the sewer, the mine, and the grid, among others-students will gain a sense of where these systems came from and how they have shaped expectations about our changing relationship with the natural environment.\n\nInstructor(s): Alexander Bierig Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ARCH 17721\n\nARTH 17761. Introduction to Modern Architecture: Modernity and Its Other(s) 100 Units.\n\nThis course invites students to reflect upon the idea of modernity in architecture as it developed between 1450 and the end of the 20th century. The purpose of this course is two-fold: 1) to introduce students to selected architectural episodes across time and space; and 2) to demonstrate that modernity as a concept is deeply charged with power dynamics. Indeed, the idea of modernity systematically includes a strong delineation of its margins: the people, cultures, and places that have been portrayed as lacking the modern mind, techniques, or esthetics. In this respect, modernity and its antonyms are often inseparable, like two sides of the same coin. Throughout the quarter, we will discuss exclusionary modern visions, debunk their absolutism, and amplify the voices of those who have proposed alternative models for modernity in architecture.\n\nInstructor(s): J. Huet Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ARCH 17761\n\nARTH 17762. Architecture and Colonialism in Algeria and Morocco. 100 Units.\n\nThis seminar invites students to examine the intersections of colonialism with architecture in Algeria and Morocco. Throughout the quarter, we will discuss the designs of architects working in these two contexts (Le Corbusier, Fernand Pouillon, Shadrach Woods, etc.) and concepts defining colonialism as a design project (segregation, repression, primitivism, etc.). We will also pay particular attention to modes of opposition pursued by residents and their historical impact toward the region's decolonization. Moments of heightened historical consequence, such as the strategic use of selected architectural spaces by independentist guerrillas, will be thoroughly discussed. The class will progress through a chronological scope, from Orientalism as a 19th century phenomenon to the enmeshment of modernism with colonialism in the 20th century. We will conclude with the emergence of postcolonial modernities.\n\nInstructor(s): J. Huet Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ARCH 17762\n\nARTH 17781. Women in 20th-Century Architecture. 100 Units.\n\nFrom the Renaissance to the present day, architecture has been a blatantly male-centric field. This course invites students to consider women who overcame systemic barriers to become figures of agency in 20th-century architecture. We will examine the lives and works of women who have managed to attend architecture schools, despite historical gender-based exclusion or restriction on enrollment, as well as those who found impactful ways to play architectural roles without academic training. We will pay particular attention to how these protagonists add necessary complexity to the modernist canon. The course will start with a first module on positionality (women as architects, women as clients, and women as residents) followed by a second module with a biographical scope (Minnette De Silva, Eileen Gray, bell hooks, and Sibyl Moholy-Nagy).\n\nInstructor(s): J. Huet Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ARCH 17781, GNSE 20145\n\nARTH 17915. Women's Work. 100 Units.\n\nAs a haptic art, an art experienced through touch as well as the other senses, architecture operates at multiple scales: that of hand, building, city. The scale of the hand gives the most direct access to architecture and its furnishings: think of a handrail, a chair, a textile, a brick pattern, a wood detail. This is the realm of craft in architecture and was, for decades, the realm inhabited and ruled by women practitioners. Women designed furniture, made drawings, wove textiles, produced pottery and glasswork as a means of expression within the male world of architectural practice. As an introduction to the study of architecture, craft entails applying principles of proportion, scale, tactility, precision, materiality, and assembly; in this way, craft is a microcosm of architecture. Through a series of projects and readings centered around the craft arts and the women who advanced them, this studio course will introduce students to small-scale making and translate that process to larger scales. Students will undertake two investigations: the first a series of small craft objects and a set of orthographic drawings describing the making process, the second a spatial analysis and workspace for a craft practitioner.\n\nInstructor(s): K.

To the Taj Mahal and Beyond: Arts of the Islamic South Asia. 100 Units.\n\nThis class is an \"Art in Context\" core class and introduces students to Islamic art and culture in South Asia, taking the Taj Mahal (1653) as a jumping off point. We begin with the Taj Mahal, taking time to analyse the architecture and history of the monument. Then we go back in time, where we examine the cultural and artistic context of the dynasty that made the Taj, the Mughals (r. 1526-1857). This will involve looking at contexts within and outside of South Asia, and within and outside of Islamic realms. Finally, we look at the impact of the Taj as a major world monument, studying later attempts to make similar tomb structures within large garden complexes. We will also examine the endearing legacy of the Taj Mahal in colonial and postcolonial periods, looking at prints, photographs, and films. The class includes a trip to the Art Institute of Chicago (details to be confirmed) and the Special Collections at Regenstein. There will also be the opportunity to construct the Taj Mahal Lego Set.\n\nInstructor(s): M. Manohar Terms Offered: Spring\n\nARTH 18706. Experiencing Medieval Art. 100 Units.\n\nHow did medieval artists and audiences encounter their material world? How do we experience medieval art and architecture today? Students in this introductory survey course will learn how to describe, analyze, and contextualize landmarks of art and architecture from Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages (ca. 200-1200) over a broad geographical area, from the Steppe to the Atlantic and the Mediterranean to the British Isles. We will practice fundamental art-historical skills through a combination of practicum sessions, lectures, and discussion of assigned readings. In practicum sessions, we will interact with materials such as incense, parchment and papyrus from the Joel Snyder Materials Collection; view pilgrimage tokens in the Smart Museum Study Room; handle manuscripts in the Special Collections Research Center; and visit the neo-Gothic Rockefeller Memorial Chapel. Proceeding chronologically, we will focus on key themes including sacred space and ritual, image theory and iconoclasm, and the sociopolitical uses of art and architecture. In addition to participation, evaluation will be based on the submission of two annotated readings, a formal analysis assignment, a midterm, and a final exam. This course meets the general education requirement in the arts.\n\nInstructor(s): M. Peterson Terms Offered: Winter\n\nARTH 20033. Iconology East and West. 100 Units.\n\nIconology is the study of images across media and cultures. It is also associated with philosophical reflections on the nature of images and their relation to language-the interplay between the \"icon\" and the \"logos.\" A plausible translation of this compound word into Chinese would describe it as \"Words in Pictures, Pictures in Words\": 诗中有画，画中有诗. This seminar will explore the relations of word and image in poetics, semiotics, and aesthetics with a particular emphasis on how texts and pictures have been understood in the Anglo-European-American and Chinese theoretical traditions. The interplay of painting and poetry, speech and spectacle, audition and vision will be considered across a variety of media, particularly the textual and graphic arts. The aims of the course will be 1) to critique the simplistic oppositions between \"East\" and \"West\" that have bedevilled intercultural and intermedial comparative studies; 2) to identify common principles, zones of interaction and translation that make this a vital area of study.

Exhibiting the Environmental Humanities: Curatorial Practicum. 100 Units.\n\nCollaboratively, students in this course will design and mount an exhibition based on research in the Environmental Humanities. Students will explore not just the exhibition's content and historical contextualization but think through critical questions about choices made in the collecting and display of selected objects as well as examine the history of exhibitions in the United States. Drawing on methods from museum studies, art history, history, environmental studies, and others, students will develop interdisciplinary approaches to research and practice communicating humanistic inquiry to general audiences. In the Fall 2024 Quarter, Students in Exhibiting the Environmental Humanities will have the opportunity to collaborate with the Sterling Morton Library at the Morton Arboretum to tell the story of May Theilgarrd Watts, an early environmental educator at the Arboretum, naturalist, author, and UChicago alumna.\n\nInstructor(s): Jessica Landau Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CEGU 20164, ENST 20164\n\nARTH 20228. William Blake: Poet, Painter, and Prophet. 100 Units.\n\nA survey of the major poetic and pictorial works of William Blake, centrally focussed on his illuminated books, from the early Songs of Innocence and Experience to The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, and the books of the revolutionary period of the 1790s: Europe, America, Visions of the Daughters of Albion, and The Book of Urizen. We will also consider the later prophecies, Milton: A Poem and Jerusalem, along with Blake's work as an illustrator of Milton, Chaucer, and the Bible. Blake's engagement with the political and religious controversies of his time will provide context, along with his pioneering exploration of dialectical modes of thought and radical forms of humanism (Poetry, 1650-1830, Theory; 18th/19th)\n\nInstructor(s): W.

Architecture and Value. 100 Units.\n\nThis investigation considers architecture as a \"value-added\" proposition, and looks at the several works as to how they take a unique position with regard to the marketpace. Architecture is largely considered for its aesthetic and cultural benefit, but here the proposition is that architecture, and the work of architects creates or improves value in their projects. Investigation begins with the normative, understanding the role of money in practice, including construction and development, all within traditional roles. The discussion includes review of the important relationship between time and money in projects. Value is often recognized through economic appraisal, which is different than architectural work impacting the performance (and thus the value) of a project. Typically value is reviewed in terms of optimizing efficiency and economy, but a fuller understanding is here pursued, including size, such as how larger projects can affect an urban area, or time, and how the value of a project may change. Different architects have used a variety of organizational approaches to improve project performance, and in some cases, have operated directly as developers or contractors. These improve projects with a different techniques. Some use dramatic form to influence market perception; others develop new responses to emerging markets; and lastly, architects working directly as contractors has resulted in unique results. Examples of each of these approaches are examined in review of\n\nInstructor(s): G.

Researching Chicago's Historic Parks and Neighborhoods. 100 Units.\n\nOften considered a \"City of Neighborhoods,\" Chicago has a fascinating network of community areas that were shaped by historical events and developments. Many of the city's neighborhoods include parks that have their own significant architectural, landscape and social histories. The class will introduce students to some of Chicago's most interesting historic neighborhoods and parks; expose them to key regional digital and on-site archives; and instruct them in appropriate methodologies for conducting deep research on sites and landscapes, with a special focus on Chicago's historic park system. Students will utilize an array of resources including Sanborn maps, US Census records, historic plans, photographs, and archival newspapers to provide in-depth studies of unpreserved sites. The course will also expose students to historic preservation policies, methodologies, and guidelines to provide practical strategies for preserving lesser-known places and sites. As a Chicago Studies class, its pedagogy will also include excursions into the city, engagement with local guest speakers, and research in relevant Chicago-area archives/special collections.\n\nInstructor(s): Julia Bachrach Terms Offered: Winter\n\nNote(s): This special class is offered in conjunction with the University’s ongoing commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the birth of Frederick Law Olmsted, the father of American landscape architecture. Olmsted and his sons, the Olmsted Brothers, had a substantial influence on the city’s South Side, including the University’s campus and the development of small parks that provided services to dense immigrant neighborhoods in the early 20th century. The class will include field trips during some Friday class sessions.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ARCH 10336, CEGU 20336, ENST 20336, HIST 27312, CHST 20336\n\nARTH 20337. Photography and the Making of Modern Art and Science. 100 Units.\n\nObservation, experimentation, invention, design. How has photography helped to shape these practices, which have been central to the development of both art and science? How might an interdisciplinary approach to the medium of photography invigorate questions of form, abstraction, realism, and subjectivity? This seminar surveys key episodes in the history and theory of photographic media to uncover overlaps, parallels, and moments of exchange across the history of modern art and science. Course readings, presentations, and site visits will offer case studies with which to consider cross-disciplinary connections, from H. Becquerel's visualizations of radioactivity and E. J. Marey's chronophotographs charting bodies in motion, to scientific iconography appearing in the photograms of Man Ray and L. Moholy-Nagy or R. Rauschenberg's use of x-ray imagery. These and many more examples evince how photographic media continually challenges historians of art and of science to reframe the methodological tools they use to evaluate visual and material artifacts. Students will have the opportunity to study and write about photographs in campus collections.\n\nInstructor(s): T. Shabtay Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ARTH 30337\n\nARTH 20685. Material Narratives. 100 Units.\n\nThis studio explores architecture and design thinking through the lens of building materials--wood, masonry, concrete, metal, glass, and sustainable products. Our focus is on how designers and architects think about materials, how they use them in their work, and how materials can play a principal role in the design process. The larger studio project is to design a pavilion somewhere on campus using what we learn and the language of materials to tell a story. There will be an emphasis on using physical models, along with sketching and drawing, to investigate, develop and communicate our ideas. A few off-campus trips to buildings around Chicago during seminar sessions will require some travel before and after class.\n\nInstructor(s): S.

Armenian History through Art and Culture. 100 Units.\n\nWho are the Armenians and where do they come from? What is the cultural contribution of Armenians to their neighbors and overall world heritage? This crash-course will try to answer these and many other similar questions while surveying Armenian history and elements of culture (mythology, religion, manuscript illumination, art, architecture, etc.). It also will discuss transformations of Armenian identity and symbols of 'Armenianness' through time, based on such elements of national identity as language, religion, art, or shared history. Due to the greatest artistic quality and the transcultural nature of its monuments and artifacts, Armenia has much to offer in the field of Art History, especially when we think about global transculturation and appropriation among cultures as a result of peoples' movements and contacts. The course is recommended for students with interest in Armenian Studies or related fields, in Area or Civilizations Studies, Art and Cultural Studies, etc.\n\nInstructor(s): Hripsime Haroutunian Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ARCH 20692, NEHC 30692, HIST 25711, NEHC 20692\n\nARTH 20700. Understanding the Built Environment. 100 Units.\n\nThis course aims to equip students with the basic skills and knowledge required to analyze architecture and the built environment. It offers an introduction to the methods and procedures of the architectural historian. These include practical tasks such as understanding architectural terminology, reading and interpreting architectural drawings, engaging with buildings \"on site,\" and studying buildings in urban context, relative to surrounding buildings, street networks and public spaces. At a broader level, the course will entail critical discussion about the relationship between architecture and society, the building as a historically specific object that also changes over time, the cultural representation of architecture, and modes of perceiving/experiencing the built environment.\n\nInstructor(s): Wei-Cheng Lin Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nNote(s): Students must attend first class to confirm enrollment.

Traveling Studio: From Detail to City at Taliesin. 100 Units.\n\nThe course is designed to immerse students in architectural drawing and making at a site of prolific drawing and making past, in a remarkable environment both natural and built. Working both individually and together, we will use our surroundings at Taliesin to tackle five short projects, increasing in scale, from the tiniest architectural details up through consideration of city and region. As part of the latter portion of the course, we will also consider the Driftless region of Wisconsin specifically, and issues facing this unique rural area in 2023, including environmental challenges, questions of housing, and rural foodways. Typical days will include studio time in the Hillside studio, ample exploration of the Taliesin grounds both programmed and free, conversations with guests familiar with the work of Frank Lloyd Wright and others who spent time at Taliesin, excursions across the Driftless region (including additional buildings designed by Wright and others close to him), and a modest amount of work helping to maintain the Taliesin site.\n\nTerms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ARTH 30704, ARCH 20704, ENST 20704, CEGU 20704\n\nARTH 21206. History and Culture of Printmaking in Early Modern Europe. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will consider the practice and theory of visual art in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Among the subjects that will drive our narrative will be the rise of modernism and postmodernism, art during the postcolonial era, pop art, the aesthetics of 1960s-era social movements, the relationship between popular media and feminism, the concept of spectacle, conceptual art, the appearance of a global art industry after 1989, \"relational aesthetics,\" the fate of art in the age of the internet, the art of the post-studio moment, and what happens to art when it engages with *everything*.\n\nInstructor(s): T.

Belgrade/Sarajevo/Zagreb. 100 Units.\n\nThe freedom to make and remake our cities (and ourselves) is one of the most precious yet most neglected of the human rights,\" argues David Harvey. In this course, we use an urban studies lens to explore the complex history, social fabric, architecture, infrastructure, and cultural transformation of the former Yugoslav capitals. Since their inception, these cities have relied on multifaceted exchanges of peoples and political projects, forms of knowledge, financial and cultural capital, means of production, and innovative ideas. Among others, these exchanges produced two phenomena, Yugoslav architecture, embodying one of the great political experiments of the modern era, and the Non-Aligned Movement, as explored in recent documentary films (Turajlić 2023), museum exhibits (MoMA 2018, \"Toward a Concrete Utopia: Architecture in Yugoslavia 1948-1980\"), and monographs (Tito in Africa: Picturing Solidarity). Drawing on anthropological theory and ethnography of the city, we consider processes of urban destruction and renewal, practices of branding spaces and identities, metropolitan citizenship, arts and design, architectural histories and styles, and the broader politics of space. The course is complemented by cultural and historical media, guest speakers, and virtual tours.

Marx's Theory of Class. 100 Units.\n\nThe topic of this course is Karl Marx's theory of socio-economic class. Its purpose is to gain insight into Marx's fundamental thesis that understanding classes helps us understand politics. Though it is one of the topics for which his name is most remembered, his view of class is often misrepresented. For instance, one might hear that, for Marx, there are just the two most famous classes of capitalist society-the so-called proletariat (workers) and the bourgeoisie (capitalists). Like classical economists before him and heterodox economists after him, however, Marx actually believes that modern societies consist of at least three classes: workers, capitalists, and landlords or rentiers, as well as other marginalized groups. And he even disaggregates those classes into the smaller groups which constitute them (e.g., productive and unproductive labor; industrial, commercial, and financial capital, etc.). By examining selections from his mature political-economic writings, we will reconstruct Marx's theory of social classes and consider his application of that theory in significant case studies such as the American Civil War. Themes which we will address include the relation between economy and politics, class and race, science and ideology, as well as agency and structure in historical development. Questions which we will ask include the advantages and disadvantages of Marx's view with an eye to contemporary questions.\n\nARTH 21451. Rhoades Seminar: Reading Ancient Egyptian Art. 100 Units.\n\nFor millennia ancient Egyptian artists constructed visual narratives on tomb chapel walls, temple structures, and other material remains - such as stelae - that provide glimpses of lived experiences in the land that gave rise to this ancient African culture. Focusing on two-dimensional representations produced in Egypt (ancient Kemet) between approximately 3000-1069 BCE, this course will consider the functions of such pictorial accounts within their original contexts and explore approaches to reading and interpreting them. We will investigate topics including depictions of \"daily life\" on the Nile, royal sojourns to foreign lands, and the imagined landscapes of the underworld, deconstructing scenes and the ancient artistic conventions used to produce them. Particular emphasis will be placed on how the natural environment of North Africa is reflected in the arts of ancient Egypt, from detailed renderings of indigenous flora and fauna to interpretations of the physical landscape. Sources will include ancient texts in translation and firsthand examination of Egyptian artifacts in Chicagoland museums, including the ISAC Museum.\n\nInstructor(s): A.

Art at the Frontiers of Faith: Christians, Muslims, and Jews in Medieval Iberia. 100 Units.\n\nSpain has long been marked out as a special case in medieval art history: a geographically and culturally distinct area in which the lives, material culture, and artistic practices of Muslims, Christians, and Jews were more closely intertwined than in any other part of the medieval world. This seminar proposes to test this deep-rooted vision of Spain's cultural hybridity, tracing through the study of its visual culture histories of cross-confessional contact, collaboration, and conflict. To account for local particularities and historical contingencies, the course follows a broadly chronological framework beginning with the construction of the Great Mosque of Córdoba after the Arab-Berber conquests of 711 and ending with the erection of Granada Cathedral in the aftermath of the expulsions and forced conversions of 1492. Over the quarter, we will critically analyze questions of religious and regional identity, paying close attention to how modern concerns have shaped scholarly approaches to this material. We will also take advantage of Chicago's collections of medieval Spanish art, notably those at the Art Institute and Newberry Library. This course welcomes students from different disciplines and caters especially to anyone interested in exploring questions related to the historical construction of identity and difference, the complexities of intercultural exchange, the modern reception of the Middle Ages, and the role of art in representing and shaping experience.\n\nInstructor(s): B. Diego Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nARTH 21821. (Re-)Living Nazi Germany through the Eyes of the Graphic Novel. 100 Units.\n\nThis course considers the graphic novel as an aesthetic and political response to Nazi Germany and the Holocaust. Through close reading of three paradigmatic graphic novels by German and American artists from WWII to the present day, we will develop a critical vocabulary to analyze the intermedial form and explore the historical conditions out of which these cultural artefacts emerge. Our journey begins with Charlotte Salomon's pioneering masterpiece Life? Or Theater? (1941-943), a recently discovered autobiographical account of life in the Third Reich created by the visionary German-Jewish artist before her death at Auschwitz at the age of 26. One generation later, Art Spiegelman, the son of a Holocaust survivor, produces his seminal 1980 graphic narrative Maus based on interviews with his father. In Nora Krug's 2018 graphic novel Belonging, the author seeks to understand her grandparents' potential collusion with the forces of ethnic cleansing in Nazi Germany. Our interpretative readings will focus on the authors' engagement with questions of European and Jewish identity and their treatment of historical trauma and culpability in the graphic novel form. This course is designed both for German majors/minors and majors from other disciplines. All texts are available in translation and class will be held in English. German majors are invited to engage directly with the German-language editions and historical sources. Additional discussions in German will be offered bi-weekly\n\nInstructor(s): Emily Dreyfus Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): GRMN 21821\n\nARTH 22003. Modern Architecture in East Asia. 100 Units.\n\nThis course explores the historical development of East Asian architecture during the 19th and 20th centuries. Students will examine the work of pioneering figures such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Tadao Ando, Kenzo Tange, SANAA, Wang Shu, and Rem Koolhaas, among other landmark building projects and significant historical events in China, Japan, and beyond. The course encourages students to use historical and cultural contexts as a lens to broaden their understanding of the relationship between architecture and society. How has architecture influenced the way people live over the last two centuries? How can architecture act as a catalyst for social transformation or a medium for social critique? How are East Asian traditions integrated into the global currents of modernization and globalization while preserving regional characteristics? By engaging with these questions, the course guides students through an understanding of why architecture and urbanism are critical in rapidly transforming societies and how ideological, technological, and aesthetic visions are manifested in architectural productions and discourses.\n\nInstructor(s): Z.

Dialogues:The Intersections of Tradition and Modernity in Contemporary Iranian Art and Architecture. 100 Units.\n\nThis studio critically explores the dialogues between tradition and modernity in contemporary Iranian art, architecture, and material culture. Through studying Iran's architectural heritage alongside emerging design practices, students will undertake projects that investigate how art and architecture can reinterpret the past to encounter the current political and economic landscapes. The studio will delve into recent buildings and artifacts created by Iranian architects and artists who actively engage with the discourse surrounding an \"Iranian modernity.\" We will specifically review the works of an emerging generation of artists and architects whose practices are instrumental in shaping cultural scenarios in Iran today. The studio involves two design projects, one at the scale of an object, and the other at the scale of a building. Through these projects, students will explore the politics and poetics of contemporary Iranian art and architecture, thinking about the local and transnational trajectories within the broader global arena.\n\nInstructor(s): R.

Spiritual and Protective Lives of Objects in African Art. 100 Units.\n\nThis seminar explores visual culture and historical arts of Africa primarily from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It is not an exhaustive geographical and temporal survey of the continent's object-making traditions, but rather, an introduction through a number of case studies highlighting religious practices and uses for art and objects of devotion and everyday life. Investigations will consider objects' tangible and intangible elements to examine their spiritual and protective dimensions through various lenses: organized religions, including Islam and Christianity, local belief systems and ritual practices, social or political organizations, and other cultural distinctions. Such contextualization will contribute to students' recognition of the diversity and historical depth of the continent's arts and cultures. We will visit objects in local museums and special exhibitions for in-person, close looking and to fuel discussions surrounding the role of museums and museum display and interpretation.\n\nInstructor(s): J.

Narrative Frescos in Early Modern Italy. 100 Units.\n\nIn this course we will observe different ways to tell a story through painting, and we will analyze strategies used by artists in early modern Italy to describe space and time in visual terms. Students will engage with different artists, from Giotto to Raphael and Pellegrino Tibaldi, and different cultural and geographic contexts, from Padua and Bologna to Florence, Venice, and Rome, over the span of about three centuries.Students will explore a wide range of visual examples and textual sources on various subject matters, from poetry to history, from the Bible to vernacular accounts about saints, from mythology to contemporary chronicles, in order to investigate what kind of stories were told on the walls of halls and courts of honor, private rooms, or public spaces, aiming at understanding why each of them was chosen. Complex projects such as narrative mural and ceiling paintings usually involved a tight collaboration among artists, patrons, and iconographic consultants, all figures with whom students will become familiar. We will also analyse the theory behind the comparison of poetry and painting (\"ut pictura poesis\", \"as is painting so is poetry\") by investigating the meaning and the reception of this ancient concept in early modern times, and its implications on the social role of the artist. Students will investigate the significance of narrative frescos in early modern times, while also asking questions about their value and impact today.\n\nInstructor(s): F.

The Japanese House Question. 100 Units.\n\nThis studio course in architecture focuses on the 'Japanese house' and the 'Japanese empty house' as main objects of investigation.We will study the 'Japanese house'-arguably the most prolific architectural typology in modern and contemporary Japan, and specifically a small group of 'Japanese empty houses' that we will select from Japan's 'bank' of empty houses, which currently includes about ten million. Each student will choose an existing empty house in Tokyo area and develop a transformation scheme. The 'Japanese house' and the 'Japanese empty house' will be observed, analyzed, represented, and finally re-interpreted by means of architectural design.\n\nInstructor(s): E.

Revision, Expression & Portfolio Design. 100 Units.\n\nThis studio course, similar to a \"senior seminar\" in other disciplines, serves five purposes: (1) to allow students to pick up a few elements (drawings, models, collages, visual and place-based research, etc.) they've produced in other ARCH studio courses and spend more time refining them, outside the broader demands of a thematic studio class, (2) to acquaint students with advanced skills in expression and representation related to the revision and refinement of these elements, based on student interest and needs, (3) to assist students in the development of a portfolio of studio work, either toward application for graduate school or simply to have for themselves, and in systems to organize projects and revisions, (4) to add to students' typographic and graphic design skillsets, primarily using the Adobe Creative Suite, as part of the portfolio process, and (5) to practice and hone communication and writing skills related to discussing architectural projects. While there will be a modest set of skills-based exercises each week, to help structure the studio, most of the work for this class will be students' own project revisions and portfolios, and most of class time will be spent sharing and refining both.\n\nInstructor(s): L.

Rhoades Seminar: Joan Mitchell. 100 Units.\n\nThis course centers around the Chicago-born, New York-and-Paris-based, artist Joan Mitchell (1925 - 1992), who will be the subject of a centennial symposium in October 2025 jointly organized by the Art Institute of Chicago and the Joan Mitchell Foundation. Student in this class will learn about Mitchell's life and work through the close study of her paintings and works on paper, gaining a foundation in the methods of object-based learning and applied art historical research of the sort practiced in museums. Together, we will survey the state of the scholarly field on Mitchell and conduct a critical review of her literature and recent exhibitions. We will also consider Mitchell's early upbringing in Chicago-her exposure to works on view at the Art Institute during her teenage years, her training at the School of the Art Institute and Ox-Bow School of Art, her immersion in the activities of the Poetry Foundation-and interrogate where and how these experiences may and may not be germane to an understanding of her work. Finally, the course will allow students to participate in the early phases of exhibition making, such as proposing and refining the scope and thesis of an exhibition, and the research and development of a checklist.\n\nInstructor(s): C.

COSI: Exhibition as Argument: Displaying Modern and Contemporary Art in and Beyond Chicago. 100 Units.\n\nCan exhibitions make arguments? How do spatial or object-driven arguments differ from textual ones? This course pursues such questions through a series of case studies focusing on exhibitions of modern and contemporary art. Structured around the richness of Chicago's art collections and spaces, each class session will bring us to a different institution, including on-campus venues like the Smart Museum of Art and the Renaissance Society, and off-campus ones, including the Arts Club of Chicago, the Driehaus Museum, and the Art Institute of Chicago. Over the course of the quarter, we will develop a toolkit for analyzing a variety of modes of exhibiting art, touching on a range of spaces and topics, including the emergence of the modern museum of the 1930s, the role of artists and institutional critique, approaches to exhibiting global contemporary art, and the place of performance in the museum. In each case, we will consider the ways that curators put artworks in conversation with one another spatially, advancing individual or institutional points of view, and explore how such strategies differ according to subject matter and context of display. This seminar is offered as part of the Chicago Objects Study Initiative. Students will be required to travel to different sites throughout the city each week and should therefore factor into their schedules roughly an hour of travel time before the official class period.\n\nInstructor(s): J. Harris Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nNote(s): The course also entails a traveling component. Students must be available between October 24-27 to travel to New York City where we will hear from curators and visit leading museums and galleries. The Department of Art History will manage the cost and coordination of air travel, hotels, and ground transportation. Consent is required.

COSI: The Material, Visual and Social Lives of Things from Premodern China. 100 Units.\n\nArtifacts from pre-modern China are often on display in museums today as art objects, and appreciated for their aesthetic value and craftsmanship. However, before entering modern collection, many of them had participated in people's daily, cultural, religious, and/or social lives. They were used, touched, collected and exchanged; they also inspired and mediated intimate emotions, philosophical discussions and artistic creations. In this course, we will study an array of objects of this sort, from bronze vessels and mirrors, to porcelains and textiles. Taking cues from their material and visual aspects, we will examine a selection of objects within their original contexts where they were made and used, and think about how they would have engaged their historical beholders. We will also explore the objects' \"journeys\" across time, space and medium, and discuss the theoretical and ethical issues that arise from each scenario. Through lectures, in-class discussions, museum visits, readings and writing assignments, students will familiarize themselves with the cultures of pre-modern China through the objects it produced, and develop skills of visual thinking and material-based analysis of art objects. Student will also review key discourses surrounding objects and material culture within and beyond the discipline of art history.\n\nInstructor(s): S. Yi Terms Offered: Spring\n\nARTH 24002. Advanced Nonfiction Workshop: Writing About the Arts. 100 Units.\n\nThinking about practices is a way of focusing a conversation between creative writers, art historians, curators, and working visual artists, all of whom are encouraged to join this workshop. We ourselves will be practicing and studying a wide variety of approaches to visual art. We'll read critics like John Yau and Lori Waxman, memoirists like Aisha Sabbatini Sloan, inventive historians like Zbigniew Herbert, and poets like Gwendolyn Brooks and Lyrae Van Clief-Stefanon, as well as curatorial and museum writings, catalogue essays, artists' statements, and other experimental and practical forms. The course hopes to support students both in developing useful practices and experimenting boldly. Classes will be shaped around current exhibitions and installations. Sessions will generally begin with student-led observation at the Smart Museum, and we will spend one session on close looking in the study room at the Smart. Students will also visit five collections, exhibitions and/or galleries and, importantly, keep a looking notebook. Students will write a number of exercises in different forms (immersive meditation, researched portrait, mosaic fragment), and will also write and revise a longer essay (on any subject and in any mode) to be workshopped in class.\n\nInstructor(s): Rachel Cohen Terms Offered: Spring\n\nPrerequisite(s): Open bid through my.uchicago.edu.

Painting Landscapes in 19th century France. 100 Units.\n\nOver the course of the 19th century in France, landscape emerged as a preeminent genre for exploring the complexities of the modern world. The massive growth of cities, industry, tourism, and other environmental changes dramatically affected inherited notions of ecological balance. How did landscape painters respond to these challenges by developing new aesthetic attitudes and representational strategies? We'll study how landscapes evolved from the Romantics and the Barbizon school, through the Realists at mid-century, to the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists. Artists to be considered in depth include Théodore Rousseau, Gustave Courbet, Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro, Paul Cézanne, Georges Seurat, and Vincent van Gogh. As many classes as possible will be held at the Louvre and Musée d'Orsay. We'll also make field trips to some of the sites represented by these painters.\n\nInstructor(s): M.

Imagining Chicago's Common Buildings. 100 Units.\n\nThis course is an architectural studio based in the common residential buildings of Chicago and the city's built environment. While design projects and architectural skills will be the focus of the course, it will also incorporate readings, a small amount of writing, some social and geographical history, and several explorations around Chicago. The studio will: (1) give students interested in pursuing architecture or the study of cities experience with a studio course and some skills related to architectural thinking, (2) acquaint students intimately with Chicago's common residential buildings and built fabric, and (3) situate all this within a context of social thought about residential architecture, common buildings, housing, and the city.\n\nInstructor(s): L.

City Imagined, City Observed. 100 Units.\n\nThis urban design studio course takes two distinct notions of the city as its starting point: grand, imaginative plans -- utopian, unbuilt, semi-realized, real... both as aesthetic objects, and as ideas -- and how the minute flows of day-to-day life, up from the smallest scale, enter into dialogue with little built and lived details, intended or not. Drawing on both Chicago and other places (not just urban) that individual students know well, we will dream both big and small, search both present and past, and tap precisely into both what we dream and what we experience... seeking not to dictate what the city will be, but to use these different modes of understanding to expand our sense of what a city can be. Necessarily, we'll grapple with difficult contradictions cities pose, our most central personal assumptions about spaces and places, and with questions of how, especially in present-day capitalism, cities change. We take as given the inevitable gap between how places actually evolve and how, perhaps, they could, and use that gap as a site for the imagination to step in, while also confronting the hubris of imagining cities real. The studio work will proceed in three stages: individually developing an alternate vision for a place you know well, at a historical moment of your choice... then breaking each others' plans... and finally using real observations and factors (and even spontaneous impulse) to complicate and rebuild your vision into something lovelier.\n\nInstructor(s): L.

Water Water Everywhere? 100 Units.\n\nThis interdisciplinary course explores aesthetics, environmental racism, and a human rights approach to the Commons to inform our perspective on the politics and aesthetics of water from the local to the global. The course will look at issues of scarcity and abundance through the lenses of art and human rights. The course will incorporate work by artist Iñigo Manglano-Ovalle, who will visit the class. Students will consider works by other artists including Mel Chin, Allan Kaprow, LaToya Ruby Frazier, and Fazal Sheikh, to understand how art can confront the 21st century's environmental challenges. Readings will include Susan Sontag's Regarding the Pain of Others, and Fred Moten & Stefano Harney's The Undercommons. The course will include visits to site specific installations by artists Iñigo Manglano-Ovalle and Mel Chin, and visits to Chicago-area natural sites such as the Big Marsh and Lake Michigan. This course is an extension of a collaborative project at the Gray Center for Arts and Inquiry with human rights lawyer Susan Gzesh, artist Iñigo Manglano-Ovalle, and curator Abigail Winograd.\n\nInstructor(s): Susan Gzesh, Abigail Winograd Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nPrerequisite(s): Third- or fourth-year standing\n\nNote(s): Students must attend first class to confirm enrollment.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): HMRT 24193, CEGU 24193, ENST 24193, CHST 24193, SOSC 21005, BPRO 24193\n\nARTH 24196. Second Nature: New Models for the Chicago Park District. 100 Units.\n\nThe Chicago Park District seems to preserve \"first nature\" within the metropolitan field. But the motive for establishing this sovereign territory was hardly natural. Today, cultural change raises questions about the significance and operation of this immense network of civic spaces. What opportunities emerge as we rethink them? While this design studio focuses on the development of new model parks for Chicago, it can support students coming from a broad range of disciplines. Texts, seminar discussions, and field trips will complement and nourish the development of architectural proposals.\n\nInstructor(s): A. Schachman Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nPrerequisite(s): Consent only\n\nNote(s): Students must attend first class to confirm enrollment.

The Life of Buildings. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will examine the life of buildings-- how they perform, evolve, and adapt over time. How do particular design decisions influence human experience and behavior? Which parts of the building align with its intended use and what are surprising outcomes or changes? These questions aim to provide students with a deeper understanding of the built environment and the series of decisions that shaped them. Through readings, surveys, site visits, and conversations with architects and building users, we will measure and examine the spaces around us. Students will begin with a series of short analysis and design exercises and create short films, projective collages and diagrams, and architectural concept models. Building on our collective observations, research, and analysis, we will then finish with a final project where we respond to an existing building and propose an alternate life path. The format of the course is part-seminar, part-studio that aims to equip students with practical tools and strategies needed to shape our world and account for the long-term impact of design.\n\nTerms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CHST 24199, ENST 24199, ARCH 24199\n\nARTH 24200. Migratory Aesthetics. 100 Units.\n\nWhat could it meant to construct a migratory history of modern art and design? The nineteenth century has been characterized by bounded models of settlement, citizenship, subjectivity, and what it might look like to intimately belong in such a world. Yet the character of that belonging was entangled with experiences of mass migration, mobility, displacement, exile, and untiring attempts to imagine a world otherwise. In this seminar, we will recenter migration as a material reality and interpretive tool. Through a series of case studies grounded in Europe and its wider worlds, students will investigate moments in which people, objects, and ideas formed as a result of the utterly mobile nature of nineteenth-century life and expressive thought. We will turn our attention to a wave of recent scholarship on the topic, and to literary and critical writings of the period, alongside paintings, prints, sculpture, design, and built environments (many from local collections). In short, frequent writing assignments, students will be prompted to reflect on broader applications of a migratory method for reading familiar objects and histories anew.\n\nInstructor(s): Alex Fraser Terms Offered: Spring\n\nPrerequisite(s): Consent Only\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ARTH 34200\n\nARTH 24255. Postcolumbian: The Ancient Americas in Modern and Contemporary Art. 100 Units.\n\nIn this seminar we will examine the varied ways in which modern and contemporary artists have engaged with the art of Aztec, Maya, Inca, and other ancient American Indigenous art traditions. We will examine modernist appropriations, later Chicano and Chicana movements, and contemporary re-inventions of Precolumbian art as new forms of Latin American and Latinx expression, commentary, and critique. Artists include Frank Lloyd Wright, Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo, Henry Moore, Michael Heizer, Robert Smithson, Enrique Chagoya, Yolanda López, Yreina D. Cervántez, Guadalupe Maravilla, Mariana Castillo Deball, Ana de Obregoso, Kukuli Velarde, among others. We will consider the ways artists have used forms of the past in a range of political, social, and aesthetic contexts, and ask what agency iconic forms of the past may have exerted, and continue to exert, on the present. Readings on modern and contemporary episodes in this \"Post-Columbian\" history will be paired with discussions of ancient art and visual culture, as we entwine understandings of early artworks with later histories.\n\nInstructor(s): C.

Children & Architecture. 100 Units.\n\nMany who pursue architecture do so initially out of a childlike fascination with buildings, places and worlds. Curiosity and limited understanding naturally provide children with an exploratory relationship to the built environments they traverse, and children also often show a heightened sense of wonder -- heightened emotions of all kinds -- as that relationship plays out. (This can be positive and formative, or scary and traumatic.) And yet, many of the adults who make choices about the worlds we inhabit think mostly of adults, and as adults, in doing so. This architecture studio course investigates the built world through a child's eyes, across different moments in history, including our own. Readings and seminar discussions will range from playgrounds to blocks, preschools to family relations, swimming pools and sandcastles to the very construction of childhood as an idea. We will explore Chicago, and meet with builders of all ages, likely culminating in designing (and potentially building) a real playground space. While previous experience with architectural skills is not necessary to excel in this course, childlike curiosity is required.\n\nInstructor(s): L. Joyner Terms Offered: Spring\n\nPrerequisite(s): While this class does not require prior experience, all ARCH studio courses require consent.

The Illustrated Book. 100 Units.\n\nKafka prohibited images of Gregor Samsa. In a 1915 letter to his publisher, he stipulated that the insect should not be drawn, not even to be seen from a distance. Why? Along with Henry James, Mallarmé, and others, Kafka seemed to fear that illustration would diminish the power of the text to \"illustrate\" or illuminate in its own way, as Hillis Miller has put it. The study of illustration has, however, emerged as a new interdisciplinary field in recent years, though illustration has often been neglected as an ornamental \"handmaiden\" to the printed word or as a commercial appendage to the book. This seminar will approach the topic with a focus on the heyday of the illustrated book, the nineteenth century, from the perspectives of book history, literary criticism, art history, word and image studies, and translation and adaptation studies. Topics to be considered to include: paratextuality; illustration as translation and/or adaptation; extra-illustration; illustration and authorship; text-image interactions or non-interactions; illustration and mass production; photography and illustration.\n\nInstructor(s): Catriona Macleod Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): GRMN 34524, GRMN 24524, ARTH 34524\n\nARTH 24651. Latest Experiments in Architectural History. 100 Units.\n\nThis seminar invites students to examine recent scholarly experiments in architectural history. Participants will read and discuss a corpus of books published in the last five years. Each week, we will take a deep dive into a single publication by synthesizing its argument, unpacking its structure, and demonstrating its potential limits. In-class activities will catalyze dialogue and debate on the readings as well as highlight resonances across assigned books. By the end of the quarter, students will have developed transversal views of contemporary practices in architectural history and heightened their senses of methodological self-awareness.\n\nInstructor(s): J.

Who does it belong to? How did it get here? Who's telling its story? Critical inquiry into the practice and politics of museums has reached a new zenith in contemporary discourse. From discussions of acquisition and repatriation to provenience (archaeological findspot) and provenance (an object's ownership history) and the ethics of curation and modes of display, museum and art professionals-and the general public alike-are deliberating on the concept of museums and the responsibilities of such institutions towards the collections in their care. This course will explore the early history of museums and collecting practices and their impact on the field today, with a focus on cultural heritage collections from West Asia and North Africa. We will first spend time on such topics as archaeological exploration of \"the Orient,\" colonial collecting practices, and the antiquities trade, as well as the politics of representation and reception in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Next, we will look at critical issues presently facing museums, including ethical collection stewardship, provenance research, repatriation, community engagement, and public education. The course will be structured in a seminar format, with lectures devoted to the presentation of key themes by the instructor and critical discussion as a group. Meetings will include visits to the ISAC Museum at UChicago.\n\nInstructor(s): K.

Museums Today. 100 Units.\n\nThrough a series of case studies, this course examines how museums are radically rethinking their function, their audiences, and their practices. What problems do they seek to redress? Who do the solutions aim to serve, and to what end? This course ultimately asks students to debate the role of the museum in the 21st century by way of course readings drawn from theory, scholarship, and the popular press; class discussions complimented by visits from guest scholars, artists, and curators; and engagement with real and virtual museum spaces.\n\nInstructor(s): M. Taft Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ARTH 34816\n\nARTH 24910. INSECT MEDIA. 100 Units.\n\nHow have insects affected ways of knowing and relating to the world? This course opens a dialogue between insects and Japanese audiovisual cultures, including fiction, poetry, visual art, manga, anime, and film. We aim to address the important and profound challenge that recent trends in animal studies, environmental humanities, and eco-criticism pose to received ways of studying human cultures and societies. The challenge lies in offering alternatives to the entrenched reliance on a nature-culture divide, which gives culture explanatory preference over nature. In the case of Japan and insects, for instance, there exists a fairly significant body of scholarship on how Japanese people respond to, interact with, and represent insects, and yet priority is generally given to culture, and Japan is treated monolithically. To offer alternatives to this monolithic culturalism, in this course we will (a) open dialogue between culture accounts of insects and scientific accounts and (b) explore different forms of media offering different milieus where human animals and more-than-human insects come into relation without assuming the ascendency of one over the other.\n\nInstructor(s): Chelsea Foxwell and Thomas Lamarre Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nPrerequisite(s): Consent of Instructor required: interested students should submit one paragraph of interest to Professors Foxwell and Lamarre.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CMST 34915, CMST 24910, EALC 34910, ARTH 34910, CDIN 34910, CDIN 24910\n\nARTH 25115. Winckelmann: Enlightenment Art Historian and Philosopher. 100 Units.\n\nWe approach the first great modern art historian through reading his classic early and mature writings and through the art and criticism of his time (and at the end, our own).

Architecture and Colonialism in Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia. 100 Units.\n\nThis seminar invites students to examine the intersections of colonialism with architecture in Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia. Throughout the semester, we will discuss the designs of architects working in the region (Le Corbusier, Fernand Pouillon, Shadrach Woods, etc.) and concepts defining colonialism as a design project (segregation, repression, primitivism, etc.). We will also pay particular attention to modes of opposition pursued by residents and their historical impact toward the region's decolonization. Moments of heightened historical consequence, such as the strategic use of selected architectural spaces by independentist guerrillas, will be thoroughly discussed. The class will progress through a chronological scope, from Orientalism as a 19th century phenomenon to the enmeshment of modernism with colonialism in the 20th century. We will conclude with the emergence of postcolonial modernities.\n\nInstructor(s): Jacobé Huet Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): RDIN 25119, ARCH 25119, ARTH 35119, RDIN 35119\n\nARTH 25140. Aesthetic Ecologies. 100 Units.\n\nWhat would an intellectual history of the environment look like when told from the perspective of art history writing? The geographer Friedrich Ratzel, who first began using the term \"Umwelt\" (\"environment\") in a systematic way, claimed that, up to the end of the 19th century, the idea of environment had been primarily discussed not in scientific contexts but rather in aesthetic ones, by \"artistically predisposed thinkers.\" In this course, we will take Ratzel's claim seriously and aim to recuperate the aesthetic side of theories of environment across diverse areas such as: notions of landscape (\"the picturesque\"); aesthetic and biological theories of milieu (Haeckel's \"ecology,\" Taine's \"milieu,\" Uexküll's \"Umweltlehre\"); Warburg's cultural history; the \"sculpture of environment\" (Rodin and Rilke); the \"space-body\" in modern dance (Laban). This course is about artworks that continue beyond their material confines into the space environing them. It focuses on evocations of air as the material space surrounding an artwork in texts that thematize the continuity between artwork as image and material object. Materials include: Aby Warburg, Rudolf Laban, Siegfried Ebeling, Camillo Sitte, Otto Wagner, Alois Riegl, R.M. Rilke, Wassily Kandinsky, Martin Heidegger, and others. MAPH and undergraduate students welcome.\n\nInstructor(s): Margareta Ingrid Christian Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): GRMN 33523, ARTH 35140, GRMN 23523\n\nARTH 25202. The Global Renaissance. 100 Units.\n\nThis course examines the early modern period (1450-1800) through the study of objects produced in various parts of the world that circulated the globe. Some case studies will include: the printed image, feather painting, the biombo, the automaton, porcelain, the atlas, and stonework. Some of these goods were novel, some were hybrid in medium and construction, and many were made in multiples or as copies. How did they circulate? Why were they made and how did they function? Recent publications on such objects and about the \"global Renaissance\" more broadly will be paired with primary source analysis of inventories, letters, and travel writing from the early modern period in order to evaluate this complex period of cross-cultural interaction and innovation in artistic production and collection. The class will visit the Art Institute of Chicago, the Newberry Library, and the Adler Planetarium for close study of materials in their current museum or library spaces.\n\nInstructor(s): L. Markey Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ARTH 35202\n\nARTH 25402. The Invisible within Visual Art. 100 Units.\n\nWhat the work of art looks like isn't too important.\" This is what U.S.-American artist Sol Lewitt wrote about conceptual art in 1967. This course takes Lewitt's statement seriously, asking: how can we consider the non-visible dimensions of artworks? How do we interpret artworks that rely upon extra-visual material, including other sensory material like touch, taste, sound, and smell, but also ideas? How do aspects that the viewer must imagine impact the way that artworks make meaning? Taking a broad approach to the category of conceptual art, this course will explore the history of art that is rooted in ideas from the 1910s to the present, investigating case studies of conceptual works from around the globe. Considering artworks that take a wide variety of forms, from paintings and sculptures, to documentary photographs and faked documentary photographs, to performances, installations, and participatory invitations, we will test Lewitt's statement. If what a given artwork looks like isn't all that important, how might the invisible inform our understanding of that artwork instead?\n\nTerms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ARTH 35402\n\nARTH 25545. Cartography & the Early Modern State. 100 Units.\n\nThis seminar focuses on concurrent watersheds in drawing, cartography, and information technology - the rise of hand-drawn maps in government archives. This occurred in fifteenth-century Venice, the first state to combine surveying, drawing, and text in the systematic collection, storage, delivery, and analysis of geospatial data concerning its territories. A radical departure from classical and medieval cartography, Venice's paper maps synced perspectival pictures with nested layers of toponyms, informational legends, directional indicators and scale bars, requiring a new kind of literacy and hardware to calculate distance. No precedent existed for this analog GIS (geographic information system); other chancery collections came later or did not have the same functionality. We will compare Venice's paper maps to contemporary landscape painting and print culture's bird's eye views and maps. We will address their increasingly dynamic interface, methods of indexing, and storage and retrieval before the arrival of filing cabinets; the addition of polychrome reliefs with their heightened sense of being there; and the increase in flattening abstractions through the end of the Venetian empire (1797). These abstractions anticipated modern mapping before the advent of digital GIS (also a government initiative) and cartography's return to embedding the user. Students are welcome from across the disciplines and may choose related topics for supervised research projects.\n\nInstructor(s): K.

Exhibiting Photographs. 100 Units.\n\nThis course traces the history of photography through a progression of landmark exhibitions, exploring the ongoing and reciprocal relationship between theories of photography and modes of public display. From the first public demonstrations of the new invention(s) through the emergence of photographic salons in the late nineteenth century, the forms of early exhibitions mirrored photography's fluid and indeterminate cultural status. By the interwar period, new theories of display and visual communication developed by the European and American avant-garde helped to elevate photography's standing in museums, transforming its liminal position between art and mass culture into a modernist virtue. For each case study, students will assess the ways that photographic exhibitions embody cultural and aesthetic values, political ideologies, shifts within the art market, and underlying ideas about photography itself. Along with these historical investigations, the course will include several visits to a multisite exhibition of contemporary photography to engage with current issues tied to curating and display.\n\nInstructor(s): C.

Photography and Political Ecology. 100 Units.\n\nThis seminar explores the role of photographic imagery in the global environmental movement from the 1960s through the present. We will investigate the uses of photography in shaping, documenting, and disseminating narratives surrounding ecological crises, activism, and public policy. Through a survey of photographic works in a variety of formats and media, we will explore how visual culture has shaped ecological thought and international politics over the last half-century, starting with the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Hum"
