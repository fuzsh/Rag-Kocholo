        "text": "Like many businesses that are struggling to survive the prolonged economic crunch, most theatre companies here in New York and across the country can’t afford anything as risky as innovation. In fact, many of the producers and directors one usually relies on to bring something new to the stage—and to infuse it with imagination and energy—have been spending their time, instead, trying to give their productions the slick, and sometimes forgettable, look of cable television, since cable works: people subscribe to it and watch it. And, just as pay-per-view TV stations list movies according to genre—comedy, action, drama, and so on—theatre companies, in a bid to minimize ticket buyers’ presumed confusion, often package their productions by era or by genre. Classical theatre is sometimes referred to these days as “classic” theatre, while avant-garde works are “fringe”—a less forbidding word, if not concept. On the face of it, the Roundabout Theatre Company’s revival of George Bernard Shaw’s “Mrs. Warren’s Profession” (at the American Airlines) belongs to the “classic” category. Its director, Doug Hughes, seems determined to milk our abiding interest in the gossipy, cozy, “Upstairs, Downstairs” aspects of English life. But his antiquated take on changing mores in Victorian England is cloying when seen from the vantage point of our postcolonial world.\n\nThe curtain rises: We’re in the garden of a modest but charming home in Surrey. Scott Pask’s lovely set, with its blue sky and lush hedges, immediately carries us to England’s green and pleasant land. (For other scenes, Pask has created a drawing room and a law office that recall those old Ealing Studios film sets—lots of burnished mahogany, flowers in tasteful vases, and dark skies beyond wood-framed windows.) Vivie Warren (Sally Hawkins) sits in the garden, studying furiously. A graduate of Cambridge, where she was an academic star, she has come to see her mother, Mrs. Kitty Warren (Cherry Jones), in the country, before starting work at a law firm. Vivie—who has inherited her mother’s gift for decisiveness, especially when it comes to money, or, more precisely, economics—hardly knows Mrs. Warren; she was sent away to school as a child. (She has no idea who her father is.) She reveals some of this to Mr. Praed (Edward Hibbert), a nice, sentimental friend of her mother’s, when he stops by to see Mrs. Warren, who is not at home. Mr. Praed is rather taken aback by Vivie’s blunt sensibility. Little does this young firebrand know that her mother could easily top her in the shock department: Mrs. Warren makes her living as a madam, running brothels in Brussels, Budapest, Ostend, and Vienna.\n\nBefore long, Mrs. Warren returns home to a drama that she doesn’t realize is under way. Strolling in, accompanied by her partner in crime, Sir George Crofts (Mark Harelik), who sports a dark, thick mustache, the matriarch is delighted to find her only child making friends with Mr. Praed—she’s acutely aware that Vivie is not the kind of girl who can make friends, at least not as easily as her mother does. And it’s fun for Mrs. Warren to chat with Sir George and to introduce him to her daughter. But Sir George is a bit preoccupied at the moment. He’d like to get married and is casting around for a suitable mate; eventually, he thinks of Vivie, but is she the marrying kind? Soon we learn that Vivie, despite her clinical and self-righteous view of the world, is not immune to romance. And young Frank Gardner (Adam Driver), the son of a neighbor, the Reverend Samuel Gardner (Michael Siberry), seems an appropriate catch. Mrs. Warren is fond of both father and son. Turns out, though, that the Reverend was too fond of Mrs. Warren in her youth, and this creates an obstacle for the would-be lovers.\n\nShaw wrote “Mrs. Warren’s Profession” in 1893, but it was banned in England and wasn’t produced there until 1902, and not in the United States until 1905. (An arrest warrant was issued for the entire cast after the first New York performance.) According to Michael Holroyd, who wrote the definitive, four-volume biography of Shaw, the Irish-born author, public figure, and defender of “unfortunates” was moved to produce this drama by what he had read in the press about prostitution. Holroyd writes:\n\nEver since the licensing of Continental brothels in the 1870s and the subsequent discovery that British girls were being exported to Brussels and Vienna . . . ‘The Great Social Evil,’ as the Victorians called prostitution, had begun to exceed slum-landlordism as the most controversial topic for the press.\n\nShaw himself explained that he had written the play “to draw attention to the truth that prostitution is caused, not by female depravity and male licentiousness, but by simply underpaying, undervaluing, and overworking women so shamefully that the poorest of them are forced to resort to prostitution to keep body and soul together.”\n\nOften, dramatic literature that grows out of journalism withers on the vine; journalism is not art. But newspapers worked as a source for Shaw’s plots, because he wasn’t an artist: he wrote light, entertaining sermons, in the epigrammatic style of Oscar Wilde. (Mr. Praed to Vivie, early in their acquaintance: “You know, my dear Miss Warren, I am a born anarchist. I hate authority. It spoils the relations between parent and child.”) “Mrs. Warren’s Profession” is a minor work on a major subject: a woman’s right to her own body, the body as capital, and the insufferable moralizing that occurs when one woman sells out another to justify her own self-loathing. And that’s just what Vivie does. At the end of the play, she disassociates herself from her mother; Mrs. Warren has given birth to her own emotional executioner—despite the fact that she has debased herself in order to provide a better life for her daughter than the one she was given. Not for Vivie the poverty-stricken, bitter days of Mrs. Warren’s youth:\n\nMRS. WARREN: It can’t be right, Vivie, that there shouldn’t be better opportunities for women. I stick to that: it’s wrong. But it’s so, right or wrong; and a girl must make the best of it. But of course it’s not worth while for a lady. If you took to it you’d be a fool; but I should have been a fool if I’d taken to anything else. . . . What’s a woman worth? What’s life worth? Without self-respect! Why am I independent and able to give my daughter a first-rate education, when other women that had just as good opportunities are in the gutter? Because I always knew how to respect myself and control myself.\n\nCherry Jones is a great artist, on the order of such theatre marvels as Geraldine Page, Maureen Stapleton, and Gloria Foster, all of whom excelled at portraying sometimes dejected, idealistic characters who never let their sadness overwhelm their love of the world. Just like those brilliant predecessors, Jones straps her character’s history to her heart, managing to project her wordless isolation, even as she speaks. She shows us who Mrs. Warren is not only through her interpretation of Shaw’s language—to which she gives a depth that doesn’t exist on the page—but through her silences, her ability to listen. (Whereas Shaw wanted Mrs. Warren to reveal her working-class roots through slips of the tongue, Jones speaks with a Cockney accent most of the time, and this works, largely because you can see the pleasure she takes in Vivie’s more “proper” accent, even when what she’s saying is hateful.) As the play goes on and as Mrs. Warren makes herself increasingly vulnerable to Vivie, Jones’s titanic force grows. But she’s no showoff, despite a towering wig (by Tom Watson), which she keeps patting, like Mae West in “She Done Him Wrong.” She’s a compassionate performer, generous to others. Throughout the play, she tries to engage Hawkins in the moment, but the younger actress—who was so memorable as the star of Mike Leigh’s 2008 film “Happy-Go-Lucky”—appears to shun Jones’s advances; her insecurity onstage doesn’t allow her to connect with any of the other characters. Hawkins seems to feel that she’s not being heard. Whenever she has to express a feeling—rage, joy, desolation—she shouts, as though afraid to call on anything internal to make the scene work.\n\nOne suspects that Jones is lonely onstage. (The only actor who seems up for actually playing with her is Driver. He doesn’t hide behind shtick, as the other male actors do; he allows his character to be seen without filigree.) But her loneliness only adds to the power of her character’s unvanquished womanhood. ♦"
