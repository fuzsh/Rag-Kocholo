        "text": "The other day, a discussion on cartoon writing erupted in response to recent posts on the subject in John Kricfalusi’s blog. One of John’s main points is that the golden age cartoons that we all regard as the greatest cartoons ever created were written by cartoonists as storyboards, not written in words as scripts. In support of his argument, he presented video clips of Walt Disney and Walter Lantz discussing the qualifications of the people who wrote their cartoons. (See also, Page 5 of the 1938 Disney Training Manual).\n\nThe scriptwriters in the comments dismissed John K’s points as old fashioned and irrelevant to the current scene, while expressing respect of a general sort for the classic cartoons of the past. They claimed that it was just a matter of John’s personal tastes, not a reflection on the effectiveness of the process itself. They never seemed to address the fact that prior to 1960 stories for cartoons weren’t created and developed with words in script form- they were drawn. In listening to these arguments by current cartoon scriptwriters, I began to wonder how much they really knew about the process used to make the classic cartoons they expressed respect for. I posed a simple question…\n\nWho was your favorite golden age cartoon writer?\n\nIt’s a fair question- one that I’ve heard animators discuss and argue about on many occasions. Surely current cartoon writers would have golden age writer heros, just like animators study golden age animators like Milt Kahl or Grim Natwick…\n\nDisney story man, Joe Rinaldi\n\nBut none of the scriptwriters participating in the discussion could name a single golden age cartoon writer. The only names they could mention were other current scriptwriters, or novelists, journalists and live action screenwriters who worked in totally different media. They had no idea who pioneered their profession and the process these people used to create cartoons for nearly half a century. To be fair, this sort of ignorance of the history of our craft isn’t just limited to writers. I’ve heard the same sort of admissions of ignorance from producers and directors, as well as artists and animators.\n\nHere is an example of a story by my favorite golden age story man… Warren Foster.\n\nWarren Foster is responsible for writing many of the greatest cartoons ever made… He started as a gag man on Fleischer’s Popeye series in New York, and moved West in 1938 to join Bob Clampett at Warner Bros. He wrote a string of classic cartoons… \"Coal Black And De Sebben Dwarfs\", \"Birdy And The Beast\", \"Falling Hare\", \"Baby Bottleneck\", \"The Great Piggy Bank Robbery\", and perhaps Bugs Bunny’s most shaded performance, \"Tortoise Wins By A Hare\".\n\nAfter Clampett’s departure from the studio, he wrote for McKimson (\"Gorilla My Dreams\", \"Easter Yeggs\", \"The Foghorn Legorn\") and Freleng (\"Ballot Box Bunny\", \"Bugs And Thugs\", \"Birds Anonymous\"). Freleng said that Foster was the best story man he ever worked with. In the TV era, Foster wrote episodes of Huckleberry Hound, Yogi Bear, Quick Draw McGraw, The Jetsons and The Flintstones.\n\nHere is a storyboard by Foster from his days at Hanna-Barbera. This is a model of clarity and simplicity, designed to meet the stringent economics imposed on TV animation at the time. This is a board from the pilot episode of The Yogi Bear Show.\n\nWHAT ABOUT ADVENTURE SHOWS\n\nAND COMIC STRIPS?\n\nIn his article, \"Detour Guide For An Armchair Marco Polo\", master comic strip storyteller, Milton Caniff writes…\n\nThere has been a tendency recently for artists to automatically assume they cannot write their own stories because they see so many double by-lines. I contend that any man who can invent pictures can invent situations and dialogue. In fact, it should be easier for the artist to pilot his own action because he is not likely to write himself into one of those undrawable dilemmas in manuscripts about which illustrators have complained for years. –Milton Caniff\n\nSound familiar?\n\nStephen Worth\n\nDirector\n\nAnimation Resources\n\nThis posting is part of the online Encyclopedia of Cartooning under the subject heading, Animation.\n\nby\n\nThis posting is a stub. You can contribute to this entry by providing information through the comments link at the bottom of this post. Please organize your information following the main category headers below….\n\nBirth/Death\n\nBirth: October 24th, 1904 in Brooklyn, New York.Death: December 13th, 1971 in San Clemente, California.\n\nOccupation/Title< Warren Foster was a highly regarded American writer, cartoonist, and composer. Bio Summary\n\nEarly Life/Family\n\nEducation/Training\n\nFoster was educated at Brooklyn Tech and the Pratt Institute. He later joined the ASCAP (American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers)\n\nCareer Outline\n\nWarren Foster began his career as a writer for Warner Bros. in 1938, and began his work there on a Porky Pig short, Porky in Wackyland. His work for Warner Bros. totaled nearly 171 cartoons. His more recognizable work for Warner Bros. includes Book Revenue and The Great Piggy Bank Robbery which features Daffy Duck, Catty Cornered with Sylvester the Cat, and Bugs and Thugs with Bugs Bunny. Near the end of his career with Warner Bros. in 1959, he worked on a Tweetie Pie short, Tweety Dreams. He is the composer for the Tweety bird theme song “I Tawt I Taw a Puddy Tat”. Foster later left the Warner Bros. studio and went to work for Hanna-Barbera. During his employment at Hanna-Barbera, he worked as a writer and cartoonist on many reputable animated programs, including The Yogi Bear Show, The Flintstones, and the feature length The Man Called Flintstone.\n\nComments On Style\n\nWarren Foster displays the skills of an accomplished draftsmen and writer, as demonstrated by one of his storyboards for the pilot episode of The Yogi Bear Show. His drawings indicate quick and precise pencil strokes with little to no erasures, suggesting that he is adept at fast sketches. The frames are simple and easy to understand within seconds of viewing them. Foster also possesses a great knowledge of line weight and tone, as he is able to suggest trees apart from solid rocks with apparent ease.\n\nInfluences\n\nPersonality\n\nAnecdotes\n\nDuring the later days of his employment at Warner Bros., Foster had written material for McKimson and Friz Freleng after Bob Clampett’s departure. Friz Freleng has apparently said that Foster was the best story man he had ever worked with.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nFilmography\n\n“The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show” (1986) TV series (writer) (1986)\n\nHappy New Year, Charlie Brown!
