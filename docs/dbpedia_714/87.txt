Career Outline

Warren Foster began his career as a writer for Warner Bros. in 1938, and began his work there on a Porky Pig short, Porky in Wackyland. His work for Warner Bros. totaled nearly 171 cartoons. His more recognizable work for Warner Bros. includes Book Revenue and The Great Piggy Bank Robbery which features Daffy Duck, Catty Cornered with Sylvester the Cat, and Bugs and Thugs with Bugs Bunny. Near the end of his career with Warner Bros. in 1959, he worked on a Tweetie Pie short, Tweety Dreams. He is the composer for the Tweety bird theme song “I Tawt I Taw a Puddy Tat”.

Comments On Style

Warren Foster displays the skills of an accomplished draftsmen and writer, as demonstrated by one of his storyboards for the pilot episode of The Yogi Bear Show. His drawings indicate quick and precise pencil strokes with little to no erasures, suggesting that he is adept at fast sketches. The frames are simple and easy to understand within seconds of viewing them. Foster also possesses a great knowledge of line weight and tone, as he is able to suggest trees apart from solid rocks with apparent ease.
