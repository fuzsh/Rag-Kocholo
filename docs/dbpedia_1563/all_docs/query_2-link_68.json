        "text": "Five Conference Modules in Webshop\n\nHow did progressive architecture develop in The Netherlands in the past hundred years and what have the residents of 'normal houses' gained from the wild experiments that the architects have sometimes carried out? We have put the strongest examples of innovative, avant-garde residential architecture in the spotlight for you in five online modules that can be purchased as modules through our WEBSHOP to watch on demand at your leisure.\n\nThese Iconic Houses Conference modules give context to the five below themes and provide insight into Dutch residential architecture of the 20th century for architecture enthusiasts, owners of modern homes, professional managers of modern museum houses, architects and heritage specialists.\n\nPioneers of the Dutch Modern House\n\nThe program consists of five modules of circa one and a half hours, each with a live-streamed keynote lecture and an episode of a new series of thematic videos in which twenty iconic houses across the Netherlands are discussed: from the Amsterdam School and De Stijl to Postmodernism, from Gerrit Rietveld to Mart van Schijndel and many others. There are also famous examples of social housing, an area in which the Netherlands was particularly rich.\n\nThemes addressed in the live streamed lectures and video series include:\n\nHygiene and Health in the Modern Home\n\nPalaces for the People\n\nA Woman’s Place: Clients, Architects, Promoters\n\nExperiments with Space\n\nHome as Self-Portrait: Architect's Houses\n\nThe last module includes a House Tour of Penthouse West399 in Rotterdam, designed by architects Nanne & Nolly de Ru of Powerhouse Company for their own family.\n\nLanguage: the lectures are in English, the thematic videoseries is Dutch spoken with English subtitles.\n\nCurious about the program?\n\nCheck out our line-up of international speakers and our interviews with them here below.\n\nKeynote Speakers and Expert Presenters of our Videoseries\n\n2 September, 2021 - Module 1\n\nHygiene and Health in the Modern Home - Architecture in the Age of Pandemics\n\nBeatriz Colomina is Howard Crosby Butler Professor of the History of Architecture at Princeton University.

He lives in the Diagoon House in Delft. His film is about the search for architectural and visual ways to guide and intensify our experience of space and time, and experiments involving these. It explores what in Dutch is called 'wooncultuur' – the culture of living in our homes.\n\nThe experimental houses that are featured in this episode are:\n\nVan Doesburg Rinsemahuis, Theo van Doesburg, 1921\n\nVan Zessen House, Cornelis van Eesteren, 1923\n\nDiagoon House, Herman Hertzberger, 1971\n\nCube House, Piet Blom, 1984\n\nWall House #2, John Hejduk, 2001\n\nClick here for our interview with Robert von der Nahmer..\n\n30 September, 2021 - Module 5\n\nHome as Self-Portrait: Architect's Houses\n\nGennaro Postiglione is Professor in Interior Architecture at Politecnico di Milano and author of The Architect's Home (Taschen), – a topic he revisits as a keynote speaker at the online conference Pioneers of the Modern Dutch Modern House. His research field is domestic interiors culture, at the intersection between people, places, and practices, crossing architecture, ethnography, and material culture. The same theoretical background nourishes also his research by design activity addressed towards adaptive reuse of minor and/or neglected heritage. Recently, he has engaged in a research investigating dwelling practices with the goal to provide new housing solutions for contemporary extremely articulated and differentiated households. He understands research and teaching – and tries to be consistent with - as an integral part of design practice.\n\nIn his keynote address, Gennaro looks at the architect’s house as an interesting form of 3D self-reflection which is otherwise rare in the architect’s oeuvre. In all houses built by architects for themselves, you see a mix of character and ideas – which may or may not be in harmony with each other.\n\nClick here for our interview with Gennaro Postiglione.\n\nThematic Video 5\n\nHome as Self-Portrait: Architect's Houses\n\nClick here for the TEASER.\n\nNatascha Drabbe is the founder and executive director of the Iconic Houses network. She graduated in architectural history from Utrecht University and has published, curated, lectured and been a member of design and architecture juries at home and abroad. She was an international project manager at the Dutch Design Foundation (Premsela) from 2002 to 2006. In 2007, she set up the Mart van Schijndel Foundation, in order to keep that architect’s ideas alive and make his home in Utrecht available for guided tours, lectures and film screenings. This was followed by launch of the Iconic Houses Foundation in 2008 and the website iconichouses.org in 2012. International Iconic Houses conferences have been held in London, Barcelona, Los Angeles and New Canaan.\n\nHouses that architects design for themselves are like test labs for new ideas. In the four houses that are central to this episode, we see the architects Van Ravesteyn, Jan de Jong, Mart van Schijndel and the Kortekaas artists duo putting their theories into practice down to the smallest detail. We also see what a challenge it is to build an experimental house with the small budget that architects usually have for their own homes. As a result, they often experiment with unorthodox, cheap building materials, which later leads to major restoration issues. Natascha lives in the Van Schijndel House in Utrecht.\n\nHouses that are presented in this episode are:\n\nSybold van Ravesteyn House, Sybold van Ravesteyn, 1932\n\nJan de Jonghuis, Jan de Jong, 1956-1983\n\nVan Schijndel House, Mart van Schijndel, 1992\n\nThe Tempelhof, Huub & Adelheid Kortekaas, 1995-1999\n\nClick here for our interview with Natascha Drabbe.\n\nClick on below photos for interviews with our keynote speakers.\n\nClick on below photos for interviews with the experts in our videos.\n\nThe last module on 30 September was followed by a Live Stream House Tour of Penthouse West399 in Rotterdam, designed by architects Nanne & Nolly de Ru of Powerhouse Company for their own family.\n\nNanne de Ru\n\nWe talked to leading authorities on architecture in the Netherlands about the Dutch reinvention of the house in the 20th century.\n\nFind our interviews with them here below.\n\nAnnouncement IHC2023\n\nThe 2023 International Iconic Houses Conference will be one where the Iconic Houses community can meet again in person, like the 2018 edition that you see in the sizzle reel here below. Scheduled for 22-27 May 2023 and hosted by the ten member houses in Czech Republic with Villa Müller in Prague and Villa Tugendhat in Brno as the highlights and with a post-conference tour program 28-30 May 2023 to Ljubljana in Slovenia to see the work by Jože Plečnik, that was inscribed to the UNESCO World Heritage List in July this year.
