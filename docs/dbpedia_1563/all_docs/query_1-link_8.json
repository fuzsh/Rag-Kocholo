        "meta_description": "This essay describes a migration scenario of architects in the interwar period, one that is different from others of the epoch. The Third Migration addresses a movement of mostly left-wing architects from Europe to the Soviet Union during the interwar period, architects that mostly relocated before the war, and many returned to Europe after the war. The Third Migration points towards a third paradigm of migration and not a chronological sequence, the first example being the Le Corbusier school around the world, and the second example being the Bauhaus that goes to the United States with Walter Gropius, Mies van der Rohe et alli. This larger frame helps to situate the specific group of architecture students from the German Bauhaus who followed Meyer to the Soviet Union in 1930 after he was expelled from the directorship of the Bauhaus: the so-called Red Bauhaus Brigade. This essay questions whether the movements of this Third Migration can be considered global and suggests a frame for analyzing the dissemination of modern architecture.",

        "text": "Migration of Architects\n\n2The first half of the twentieth century was characterized by the movement of people. On the one hand there was a proliferation of means of transportation that took people further and faster, and on the other hand a series of conflicts that ignited the relocation of large numbers of individuals. During the first decades of the century, as a result of the pogroms large numbers of Russian Jews moved to countries like Argentina and the United States, and there was a big wave of Japanese emigrating to California in the United States and British Columbia in Canada. As the century advanced, the map of Europe was dramatically reorganized – at least twice. The periods before, during, between and after the two World Wars saw the dislodgments of population from Europe to other continents, within Europe (including the moving of masses of people with the purpose of their termination), and to Europe. By way of the military there were also considerable movements of people between continents, either in the context of wars or colonial projects. In relation to colonial, and later post-colonial operations in India, Africa, and the Middle East, they also triggered not only the circulation, but also the displacement of population.\n\n4The aftermath of the Russian Revolution brought hundreds of foreign architects, Germans and Americans in particular, to the Soviet Union. The Spanish Civil War, which first attracted foreigners into Spain as part of the international brigades, later saw the exile of several Spanish architects, like Josep Lluis Sert who went to the United States and Felix Candela who went to Mexico. The Nazis in power in Germany sparked the movement of architects within continental Europe, and to Britain, the United States, Latin America, Australia, the Middle East and Africa.\n\nThree Migrations of Architects\n\nThe First Migration\n\n7The First Migration relates to Le Corbusier and his collaborators who resettled in their home countries, established practices around the world, or worked for international agencies. There are too many examples to name them all. For instance, the Swiss Albert Frey worked in Le Corbusier’s office for over a year in the late 1920s, and in 1930 immigrated to the United States. Others like Kunio Mayekawa (who worked for Le Corbusier in 1929) and Junzo Sakakura (1930-35) came to the office from Japan and then returned to their country. The foreigners who worked for him usually, but not exclusively, resettled in their home countries afterwards. Others emigrated again, and others stayed in France for good. All of them, to different extents, spread Le Corbusier’s gospel (and at times got international commissions for him).\n\n9The details of Le Corbusier’s politics and political ideas are particularly complicated; he was more focused in persuading politicians of different colors in several countries to give him commissions than in defending any particular political ideology. Le Corbusier provides an interesting contrast with those architects who had to leave Europe during the war whether for their political ideas or ethnicity. Like Gropius and Mies van der Rohe in the early 1930s with the German Reich (more on this later), Le Corbusier was on friendly terms with the Vichy government for part of the Second World War. Still, in the models of migration that will be described, the First Migration was the least political from an architecture perspective because it offered to bring modern architecture to whomever demanded it (even more so if the recipients did not know they needed it). In broad terms, for this migration, the ethical boundaries of modern architecture’s agenda were not tied to this or that political side.\n\nThe Second Migration\n\nThe Third Migration\n\n13The Third Migration had a distinctly peripatetic diaspora to “other” countries, determined by politics, although in most cases the participants returned to Europe after the war. The Third Migration describes architects who left their home country (or adopted country in some occasions), in many cases in order to put into practice their Marxist ideals – far from a Fascist bound Germany – finding the first test case for their ideas in the Soviet Union until circa 1937.\n\n16This larger context helps also to situate the specific group of architecture students from the German Bauhaus that followed Hannes Meyer to the Soviet Union after he was expelled from the directorship of the Bauhaus in 1930: the Red Bauhaus Brigade. Their migration is to some extent comparable, but in many respects also different from others of the period, including the most emblematic brigade of foreign architects to the Soviet Union at the time: Ernst May’s brigade. May’s brigade was considerably larger, was offered better conditions, and was by and large more official and as such more publicized (more on this later). The seven Red Bauhaus Brigade members were Tibor Weiner (1906-1965), Konrad Püschel (1907-1997), Philipp Tolziner (1906-1996), René Mensch (1908-1980), Béla Scheffler (1902-1942), Antonin Urban (?-1942), and Klaus Meumann (1907-?), all of whom had studied architecture under Meyer at the Bauhaus. Driven by collectivist ideology, Meyer and his short-lived brigade staged an itinerant extension of the interrupted “second” Bauhaus. Part of the interest lies on Meyer’s pedagogical project because it helps to uncover the education received by the students and understand the evolution of their architectural ideas after they moved to the Soviet Union. Specifically, the careers of Weiner, Püschel, Tolziner, and Mensch, extended well beyond the period they spent together in the Soviet Union and took divergent paths. From this group, Weiner went to the Bauhaus for post-graduate studies. Following his sojourn in the Soviet Union, he had perhaps the most itinerant trajectory: after working in France and Chile, he returned to his native Hungary in 1948 where he subsequently worked as an urban planner and teacher. After the Soviet Union, Püschel returned to Germany, fought in the war, and later dedicated his life to a professorship in Weimar – with the exception of an intense work assignment in North Korea in the 1950s that became the most important role of his career. Tolziner never left the Soviet Union. He survived the Gulag and became a specialist in the restoration of historic buildings in the Urals, only to return to Moscow after he was rehabilitated to work once again on the design of collective housing types. Mensch worked as an architect in Iran, Chile, and his native Switzerland, but while the rest of this group were engaged in political or survival logics, Mensch was following work opportunities rather than an ideological agenda. Of the remaining Brigade members, Scheffler and Urban died in the Soviet Gulag, and there is no trace of Meumann after the 1930s which probably means he had the same tragic fate (image 1).\n\n17At first, the Red Bauhaus Brigade worked under Meyer at GIPROVTUS (Construction of Higher and Technical Education Colleges Trust), but soon after Meyer left and started to work for other Trusts, also participating in projects like an entry for the Greater Moscow Plan (1932), and eventually designing cities for Siberia and the Far East of the Soviet Union. What happened to the Red Bauhaus Brigade members after 1933 when they left GIPROVTUS? Interestingly, unlike Meyer, many of the members of the Brigade were able to build in the Soviet Union. Antonin Urban allegedly designed and built a vocational school in Novokuznetsk. In 1932 Scheffler went to work for Pёtr Oranskij in the new city of Uralmash, and they designed and built a series of buildings (among them a school with ten classrooms and a stadium). Most importantly, in 1933, Püschel, Tolziner, and Weiner joined former Ernst May Brigade members Mart Stam and Hans Schmidt in the design of the city of Orsk where they would remain until 1936. As was normally the case for new towns, Orsk was built to accompany an industrial operation on the banks of a river (the Ural River in this case). Eventually, Schmidt had sole charge of the design, modifying the center-less first proposal, and rearranging the buildings on the short sides of the rectangular city blocks by turning them ninety degrees in order to create a profile for a main street. Under Schmidt, the three former Bauhaus Brigade members took on design and construction tasks. Individually or in pairs, they took charge of whole sectors (quartals) of the city. Moreover, since qualified laborers were scarce, training workers with no building experience was also part of their job.\n\nWas the Third Migration Global?\n\n23The “multi-continental” phase of Meyer and some of the former members of the Red Bauhaus Brigade was not exactly “global” in the current sense of the term. When attempting to emigrate, they were limited to certain countries that had the flexibility and openness to receive foreigners with connections to the Soviet Union. However, the tendency of architects like Meyer, Püschel, Mensch, and Weiner to jump from one country to another was often the product of changes in the political waves. In parallel, the fact that they could work in all these places speaks to an inherent flexibility of the architectural profession, the language of architectural drawings.\n\n24Yet, what was offered by this militant version of modern architecture? The Third Migration was an itinerant modernism that had to constantly adapt to local variables, but that nonetheless left buildings, urban schemes, cities, and, most importantly, generations of local architects who were educated by its members in countries where architectural culture was transitioning to modern approaches. Implied in the term itinerant is the idea that the expertise acquired by Third Migration architects in the Soviet Union involved fast work, adapting and learning about extreme climates and negotiating in a language they had not fully mastered. Similar things can be said about the work done later of Meyer in Mexico and Weiner in Chile. Above all, the members of the Third Emigration became what can be characterized as “architectural mercenaries”. In this case, the term “mercenary” is not intended in a derogatory way, instead suggesting that these architects could provide their professional services anywhere and that architecture could be deployed as a social weapon that had the capacity to contribute to progress, politics, and culture, particularly in places that were culturally foreign and remote from a European perspective.\n\n28Unlike many members of the Third Migration, the former Bauhäusler in Palestine did not return to Europe. This tendency to settle in Palestine can easily be explained by the fact that most, if not all of them, had come to the Bauhaus from Palestine in the first place. Above all, Zionism as an ideology had both left- and right-wing variants. The left-wing variants represented progressive socialist ideas that coincided with many of Meyer’s ideas, such as collective living which found an outlet in the Kibbutzim. The Red Bauhaus Brigade members Scheffler, Tolziner, and Weiner were Jewish, and Tolziner had been a member of the Zionist group “Blau-Weiss” in his youth and had lived in Palestine for a spell before his Bauhaus days. But after he became more radical politically, he left his Zionist ideals for Communist ones, and neither he nor Weiner considered the possibility of settling in Palestine. Their decisions to pursue their ideals elsewhere are telling, since as left-wing Jews the option of going to Palestine would have been an obvious one, but clearly their left-wing commitments were not aligned with a Zionist variant.\n\n32Unlike the Bauhaus under Gropius and Mies, the project of Meyer and the Red Bauhaus Brigade did not have a permanent home – or to be precise, never found a final home. Meyer’s project was not a global project – as a matter of fact it debunks the very idea of being “at home in the world”. Although he was in authority positions a series of times, he was more of a political intransigent than a political animal (even though this idea can be challenged if one considers all the lip service he performed for Stalin, exemplified by the lectures he gave in Western Europe between 1931 and 1936).\n\n33The first show trials in the USSR in 1936 prompted the beginning of the exodus of all of the foreigners who could leave. Even those who remained an extra year left the Soviet Union by November 1937 at the latest, if they could. Those who stayed usually had no choice, and ended in the Gulag accused of espionage. Meyer left the Soviet Union in 1936. No matter how much Meyer and the other members of the Red Bauhaus Brigade had identified with the Soviet project, they could not live in service of that project. Even though Meyer in some capacity kept on defending Stalinism, he ultimately was well aware that the Stalinist project excluded him. Meyer and his Brigade’s endeavors can be tentatively described as internationalist rather than global, engaged at times with the Communist party, various educational institutions, and a series of state organizations in countries of dissimilar political contexts.\n\nThe Three Migrations\n\n34Investigating these three migrations is one way of breaking down the impact of modernism in architecture, and disassembling romantic monolithic notions of modern architecture. Studying the Third Migration as a different set of architectural “strategies” is also a statement of resistance against more purist readings of modern architecture. As things turned out, the Third Migration’s understanding of modern architecture was interrupted by the war and for the most part found itself on the Eastern side of the Iron Curtain in the postwar period and, therefore, had to comply with Party dictates, loosing many of its initial modernist impulses. My larger project is an attempt to expose some aspects of this Third Migration, to question what was lost by its interrupted development, and to understand what can be learned from this unexplored legacy."
