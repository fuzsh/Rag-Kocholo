        "text": "Far from nostalgically celebrate the 90th anniversary of the second CIAM, which indeed opened in October 1929 in Frankfurt, the present issue is intended as collective work, a springboard which aims to widen the debate over housing experiences beyond geographical and temporal frameworks. The focus of that event, the Existenzminimum, has often been cited as representing a fundamental contribution to the rational design of the modern dwelling. But the debates during that event went beyond the definition of this concept, because demonstrated, on the one hand, how the responsibility of architects would imply the resolution of multiple technical aspects, starting from the typological concern stretching towards the town planning aspects, and on the other hand, the calling to develop a multifaceted intellectual vision of society. Though the title selected for the present issue, namely 'Housing Builds Cities', denotes the different scales of the project, the aim is to achieve a something more. First and foremost, the objective is not strictly confined to a historical understanding of facts around the 1929 congress. Today a critically objective approach is useful to examine past contributions and, if applicable, their actualization. Secondly, this special issue intends to address the CIAMs' theoretical and architectural legacy. The hypothesis on their interpretation suggests that these are still topical issues today. The issue comprises fourteen articles which investigate, through different applied methodologies, the years from the first steps of the CIAMs to the 1929 aftermath, analyze the postwar production and explore many case-studies, of which some are also geographically far from a Euro-centric vision as well as contemporary realities.\n\nThis idea of the universality of modernity in architecture, as in any other field, had to be put into perspective. For all that, the idea of modernity in architecture in the 19th century must be approached on both sides of the Atlantic, in a dialectical manner and aim to bring to light features of modernity, whether specific or not, rather than a monolithic and dogmatically defined modernity. In order to do this, it was necessary to avoid any teleological and linear vision of the idea of modernity between the end of the 17th and the beginning of the 20th century. In this study, it is reasonable to speak of a proto-modernity in architecture and town planning that was born in France at the end of the 18th century, on the eve of the French Revolution and in the wake of the Enlightenment. After 1945, American leadership in the cultural sphere accompanied American hegemony in the economic, political, strategic and other fields. There is a match between the International Style and the triumphant American modernity: the graft has taken hold, inventories have no place as long as there is no questioning of this modernity. The situation changed rapidly and radically with the postmodern context as early as the 1970s. More recently, deconstructivism has emerged in the United States as a movement of refoundation, of questioning the presuppositions of modernity and postmodernity, as a project for resolving the urban chaos resulting from the impasses generated by both modernity and its avatar, postmodernity.\n\nIn Theories and History of Architecture (1968) and in Project and Utopia (1973), the Italian historian Manfredo Tafuri identifies two cuts that establish modernity: 1st Brunelleschi's work in Florence in the 15th century. 2nd In architecture in the Age of Enlightenment and more particularly in the engravings of the Carceri of Piranesi, in which he agrees with Scully's interpretation. Tafuri's Marxist analysis sheds new light on the origins of modernity. Chicago at the end of the 19th century has a value as a testimony to the situation of architecture faced with capitalist urban modernity. Methodologically, however, Tafuri's approach is underpinned by the desire to show the gradual disappearance of architecture as an autonomous instance of intervention in urban space. By privileging the determination of architectural work through economic infrastructures, Tafuri comes to consider architecture as a pure ideological instance whose effectiveness is considerably reduced by the dominant context of new production relationships. Ultimately, it is around the postulate of the erasure of the architectural object in the modern era that a critical study of Tafuri's work can be made: is this trend inevitable? Is architecture condemned to immerse itself in the city in a fragmentary, neutral and reproducible form? What is meant by architecture of the pure sign?

Historically, the fascination that America exerted on Europeans from the beginning of the 19th century can be explained by the fact that it is an ideology in itself, embodying the conjunction of the two scenes, that of the future and that of modernity. The current paradox, in the postmodern context, is the American rejection of modernity, as a whole, without an inventory having been made to restore to modernity as the \"stage of the future\" its archaic American part, which has little to do with European modernity. Thus, revisionist postmodernist historians and architect-theorists of architecture favor eclecticism in restored architecture as a positive value based on attributing commonly recognized meanings to architectural forms. They celebrate the period 1893-1938, which corresponds to the eclipse of modernity in the USA, between the two schools of Chicago, that of Sullivan and that of Mies van der Rohe. Revisionist history not only relativizes the contribution of the Chicago school, but the entire modernist scheme is called into question, starting with the discredit that all modernist historians cast on the Colombian Exhibition of 1893. For Giedion, for example, it appeared to be an aberration of history. According to Stuart Cohen, the architectural neo-classicism that was revived in 1893 was perfectly adapted to the American historical context of the time. In the reactionary rejection of modernity in its entirety by the revisionists, there is an iconoclastic will towards the glories of modernity, like Gropius but especially Mies van der Rohe.In conclusion, the idea of modernity appeared to some historians and theorists as an ideological one.\n\nHélène Jannière (Université Rennes 2) and Paolo Scrivano (Politecnico di Milano), scientific coordinators of the Mapping Architectural Criticism network, are guest editing the next issue of HPA – Histories of Postwar Architecture. A call for papers has been launched on the topic Committed, Politicized, or Operative: Figures of Engagement in Criticism from 1945 to Today. Deadline for paper submission: July 31, 2020 Please find more information below Hélène Jannière (Université Rennes 2) et Paolo Scrivano (Politecnico di Milano), coordinateurs scientifiques du réseau Mapping Architectural Criticism, sont les rédacteurs invités du prochain numéro de HPA – Histories of Postwar Architecture. Un appel à contribution a été lancé sur le sujet Committed, Politicized, or Operative: Figures of Engagement in Criticism from 1945 to Today. Date limite pour l'envoi des propositions: 31 juillet, 2020 Veuillez trouver plus d'informations ci-dessous ---- Presentation In a 1995 article on the renewal of architectural criticism, French architect and critic Bernard Huet referred to Charles Baudelaire to define art criticism as necessarily – in the poet’s words – “partial, impassionate, political”. During the 1990s, perhaps as a reaction to the 1980s, when in many specialized publications architectural criticism was identified as “communication” or even as promotion of architects and architectures, it emerged an extensive nostalgia for a notion of criticism associated to the historical avant-gardes. In this “committed” criticism or in the “politicized” one it was possible to emphasize the critic’s influential and active role in discovering, promoting, and intellectually supporting groups of artists or architects. The idea of a “golden age” of criticism has thus spread, being from time to time related to the end of the 19th century, to the 1920s, and to the 1960s and 1970s. This issue of HPA intends to collect studies devoted to historical examples of “committed” and “politicized” criticism, reflecting on the real meanings of these concepts and on the themes and subjects to which they are tied. On the one hand, the figure of “committed” critic might be linked to the art and architecture avant-gardes from the end of the 19th century onward, hence defining a privileged relationship between critic and artist/architect; on the other, “politicized” criticism can be characterized as the understanding in political terms of architectural and city phenomena. Among the questions the issue wants to address are: in which way do these definitions of “committed” and “politicized” criticism come close to or differ from the definition of “operative” criticism, in the various meanings that have been attributed to it since Manfredo Tafuri? What are the theoretical tools, the rhetorical constructions, and the intellectual and political references of “committed” and “politicized” criticism? Should the latter be necessarily bound to the author’s belonging to a party or political group? What are their principal ways of circulation (specialized periodicals, journals, targeted actions)? In which measure did “politicized” criticism influence architecture’s historical narrative? And finally, what are the interlacements and the convergences between criticism’s intellectual and artistic engagement and the political commitment? The issue of HPA intends to include contributions dealing with specific case studies or themes, with a periodization that spans from the end of the Second World War to the present date. Guidelines and deadlines Please find the complete guidelines and deadlines for the submission in the pdf attached.
