        "text": "Wendelien van Oldenborgh was born in 1962 in Rotterdam, Netherlands, where she is based as an artist. She develops works in which the cinematic format is used as a methodology for production and as the basic language for various forms of presentation. She often uses the format of a public film shoot, collaborating with participants in different scenarios to co-produce a script and orientate the work towards its final outcome. She has participated in various large biennials, and in smaller dedicated shows. With Cinema Olanda she represented the Netherlands at the 57th Venice Biennale. She has participated in Forum Expanded with Pertinho de Alphaville (2010), La Javanaise (2012), and Beauty and the Right to the Ugly (2014).\n\nFilmography\n\n1996 St Anna; Super-8 loop, film installation 1997 Horizontal; Super-8 loop, film installation 1998 Splitising; Super-8 loop, film installation 1999 It's full of holes, it's full of holes; 24 min. and 16 min. 2001 Stadtluft; 34 min. and 23 min. 2002 Studio.
