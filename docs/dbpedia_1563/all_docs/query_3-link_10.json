        "text": "Charlotte Ida Anna \"Lotte\" Stam-Beese (28 January 1903 – 18 November 1988) was a German-Dutch architect, photographer and urban planner who helped with the reconstruction of Rotterdam after World War II. Beese was born in Reisicht, Silesia, Germany (now Rokitki, Poland). As a young adult she first found work as a weaver in Dresden. Before beginning her career as an architect, Beese was a successful photographer. Though she only worked with the medium professionally for a short period from 1926 to 1930, her work had a disproportionate impact and is now held in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, Arthur M. Sackler Museum, the J. Paul Getty Museum the Museum of Fine Arts Houston, and Los Angeles County Museum of Art. From 1926 to 1928 she attended the Bauhaus school in Dessau. In the next years of the interwar period she worked in office in Berlin, Moscow, Ukraine, Brno, and Amsterdam. From 1946 to 1968, Beese worked as an urban-planning architect, and later as chief architect, for the Agency for Urban Development and Reconstruction of Rotterdam, which had been heavily bombed in 1940 during the Second World War. Starting in 1926, she attended the Bauhaus school, where she studied with Josef Albers, Wassily Kandinsky, Joost Schmidt, and Gunta Stölzl. She enrolled to study the more \"feminine\" subject of weaving, but later, Beese got accepted into an architecture course from Hannes Meyer as the first woman to study in the building department of Bauhaus Dessau. Compared to his predecessor, Meyer was less prejudiced about the idea of women studying subjects that were dominated by and previously reserved for men. Beese was a good student but Meyer was not convinced of Beese's future prospects, unless she would marry a male architect and work for his firm. Meyer, Bauhaus-director and a married man with two children, and Beese started a love affair. Despite the school's liberal climate, the affair was not approved of, and in December 1928, Meyer suggested Beese to leave Bauhaus, which she did."
