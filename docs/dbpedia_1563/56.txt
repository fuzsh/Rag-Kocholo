Thanks to the work in which he intervened before the Second World War, Lotte Stam-Beese specialized in urban planning. She was appointed in 1946 director of the Department of Urbanism of the University of Architecture of Amsterdam and made the reconstruction of Rotterdam after the Second World War. Among its urban projects in this city include the reconstructions of Pendrecht and Ommoord districts.

Urban design Pendrecht (1949-1953)

The most outstanding project of Lotte Stam-Beese is its intervention in Pendrecht, one of the southern districts of Rotterdam, started in 1949. The main objective of this project was to organize 6300 houses using a series of spatial categories, which ascends according to their capacity were: housing, group, neighborhood, district and city.

Lotte configures a square that is free of traffic bordered by four neighborhoods. The unit chosen to host the neighborhood units was the so-called Wooneenheid (grouping). Each group has a set of buildings that respond to different needs depending on the type of residents intended to accommodate. We find, therefore, a great social diversity that is reflected in its spatial organization of independent blocks of different heights surrounding a community green space.

For her, the city project was the result of a community and not of an individual. The neighborhood is part of the city, without solution of continuity. This idea is contrary to the idea of ​​"Urban City-Garden", which bet on autonomous neighborhoods connected by commercial axes and equipment.

"The district of Pendrecht as part of the southern expansion of Rotterdam intends to be part of the city as a district. It does not intend to become a garden city or an isolated suburban settlement, where one can withdraw from the hectic life of the city. Pendrecht has an urban population formed by citizens".
