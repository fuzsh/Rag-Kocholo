Mike Geraghty has become the third Independent candidate to stand for election in the highly competitive Galway City Central ward in May’s Local Elections.

Mr Geraghty joins Mike Cubbard and Jimmy Horan as the third Independent, and brings to 12 the number of candidates running in the six seat ward. This will be the Newcastle resident’s third local election run, having stood in 2004 and 2009.

“Galway City Central has yet to elect an Independent councillor,” he said. “For too long the perception has been that only political parties can effect change. I disagree! The role of councillors is to work together and do what is best for Galway.”

Mr Geraghty will be campaigning for a stronger Garda presence on the streets to deter anti-social behaviour; sustainable solutions to Galway’s traffic problems; and provision of adequate community recreation facilities, green spaces, and use of these “to their full potential”.

He will also be calling for Galway to have a directly elected mayor. “We should explore options for political reform locally as well as moving away from the pact situation which has operated in City Hall for far too long,” Mr Geraghty said.

Mr Geraghty is a community activist, who has represented residents in negotiations with NUI Galway and the Galway City Council on traffic, road linings, pay and display, antisocial behaviour, maintenance of green areas, and preservation of the Corrib Walkway. A keen sportsman, he is director of Maree Community Tennis Club and is a member of the board of directors of the Galway Lawn Tennis Club.
