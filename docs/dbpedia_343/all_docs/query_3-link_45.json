        "text": "Athlone councillor Paul Hogan has announced he will be running for the new Independent Ireland party in both the Athlone and Moate local electoral areas at the council elections in June.\n\nThe Retreat Park native held an election fundraiser last weekend at which he confirmed he would be standing for the new Independent Ireland party which also includes Roscommon-Galway TD Michael Fitzmaurice and MEP candidate Ciaran Mullooly.\n\nCllr Hogan was first elected to Athlone Town Council as a Sinn Féin candidate in 2004, and he contested several elections under the Sinn Féin umbrella before quitting the party in 2018.\n\nHe lost his seat on Westmeath County Council in 2019, but was co-opted onto the local authority in 2022 following the resignation of Cllr Jamie Moran.\n\nIn a statement this evening (Monday), Cllr Hogan said: \"I wish to confirm that I will be contesting both wards of the Athlone Municipal District.\n\n\"I will be fighting this election under the umbrella of Independent Ireland. I was born and raised in Athlone. Although I am married and living outside the town for many years, I love my home town and have enjoyed representing the people since 2004.\n\n\"For the last number of years I have made representations on behalf of people from the entire Athlone and Moate Municipal District.\"\n\nCllr Hogan said he would be running in both the Athlone and Moate areas on June 7 in order to \"try to maximise the Independent vote\" in the election.\n\n\"The recent referenda on the family and care have proved that there is a disconnect between the main parties (Government and Opposition) and the people. I was the only elected representative locally to advocate a No/No vote in the referenda.\n\n\"People that I talk to struggle to see the difference between any of the parties. The purpose of running in both wards is to maximise the Independent vote across the District.\n\n\"I will be contesting the election under the umbrella of Independent Ireland. I have known Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice for many years, and I have the greatest of respect for him as a politician.\n\n\"Ciaran Mullooly is running in the Midlands North and West constituency for Europe. He is an excellent candidate and I expect him to take a seat.\n\n\"It is a huge undertaking to run in any election. I wish all of the candidates well in the election. I held a very successful race night fundraiser at the weekend and received huge support and endorsements from all those who attended.\"\n\nThe former Athlone Mayor mentioned a number of issues he intended to focus on if re-elected, including the housing and cost of living crises, the availability of high-quality broadband and other services in rural areas, traffic in Athlone, and anti-social behaviour, among others.\n\n\"I will be holding an official local launch in the next two weeks. Over the coming weeks, I will be calling to as many doors as possible. I look forward to talking to as many people as possible,\" said Cllr Hogan.\n\n\"I have already received an overwhelming level of support. I am encouraging everyone to take part in this milestone election.\n\n\"I am running in this election on my record of a high work ethic, experience and high record of delivery for the people of this District,\" he concluded."
