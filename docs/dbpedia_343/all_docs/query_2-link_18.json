        "text": "Sinn Féin TD insists party is ready for general election\n\nSinn Fein TD David Cullinane has said his party will be “match fit” for a general election whenever it was called.\n\nHe also insisted Mary Lou McDonald remained the right person to lead the party into that poll.\n\nMr Cullinane said Sinn Fein was “humble” enough to acknowledge Friday’s elections had not delivered the results the party had wanted.\n\n“We will learn, but also if this Government or when this Government calls the general election, we will meet them head-on on their failed records on so many issues, but, more importantly, on our positive vision on what we can do to deliver,” he told RTE Radio One.\n\nHe added: “People vote differently in a local and European election to a general election. We saw that before. It’s possible some of the Sinn Fein vote or some of those people who want change stayed at home in the local election. And we know that some of the people who possibly intended to vote for Sinn Fein voted for independents.\n\n“So we have to reflect on that. We don’t have all the answers as the votes are still being counted. So, what I’m saying is, like we did before, we will go and we will talk to our communities, we will listen to them and we will make sure that we’re match fit for a general election because that hunger for change that people had in 2020 in my view will not dissipate.”\n\nOn questions over the leadership of Ms McDonald, he replied: “Mary Lou McDonald will be the person to lead Sinn Fein very energetically into that campaign.”\n\nMichael McGrath 'not getting carried away' by election results\n\nMinister for Finance Michael McGrath says Fianna Fáil will not be getting carried away by the results of the election and appears firmly against the idea of an early general election, with the budget the main focus of attention between now and the year's end.\n\nSpeaking on Morning Ireland on Monday, he said: “We’re not getting carried away for a moment. We are not saying that this is a predictor of a general election. We want to improve on the number of seats we have in the next general election and there’s a lot of work left to do – but this does demonstrate that our vote is resilient.”\n\n“I still believe that the general election should be held in the first quarter of next year,” he added.\n\n“I believe not only should we announce a budget in October, and we are planning for the budget in the normal way in the autumn, but we should also enact a budget because I think it would be wrong and I would go as far as to say it would be irresponsible to announce a budget and then not to enact it, because of course it would take perhaps many weeks and who knows maybe even months after a general election before we have a new government.\n\n“And I think we should not take the risk of going into 2025 without having a budget legislated for and fully implemented, because economic stability is important and that comes from political stability.\n\n“And that’s why I believe we should have a budget, we should legislate for the budget, and we should implement it, and then go to the people based on our record.”\n\nCalls for earlier-than-expected General Election likely to intensify\n\nWhile Mary Lou McDonald has come out fighting in the wake of what Taoiseach Simon Harris described as an 'unmitigated disaster' of a performance in the elections, calls for an earlier-than-expected General Election are likely to intensify for the current coalition partners to strike while the iron is hot.\n\nHarris has so far quelled speculation that an election will take place any earlier than a previously flagged date of Spring 2025 but the situation may well change given the likely outcome of the elections, an outcome that few had predicted in advance.\n\nAs counting continues in the European elections, meanwhile, Fianna Fail’s Barry Andrews, who topped the poll, and Fine Gael’s Regina Doherty are expected to secure two of the four seats in the Dublin constituency.\n\nThe outcome of the first count in Ireland South is expected on Monday, with Fine Gael’s Sean Kelly and Fianna Fail’s Billy Kelleher looking well placed.\n\nThe Midlands-North-West constituency is not anticipated to complete its first count until later in the day, as officials grapple with what is set to be a marathon process of whittling down the 27 candidates vying for five seats.\n\nFascinating contest in store tomorrow\n\nCount staff are getting some rest ahead of a very interesting electoral battle tomorrow. Andrews and Doherty are safe, but there's going to be a real scramble for the remaining two seats.\n\nSinn Fein's Lynn Boylan is currently third and will be confident of a sizeable transfer from her running mate Daithi Doolan, who has 10,766 first preferences. She will need more, however, and Aodain O Riordain, Ciaran Cuffe, and Niall Boylan are all within 5,000 votes of her as it stands. Behind them is Clare Daly, who is around 4,000 votes further back. But she's ahead of Brid Smith, who has 21,577 votes. Daly could be in a good position if she stays ahead of Smith and benefits from her transfers.\n\nEqually, Niall Boylan will be eyeing up the votes of a plethora of right-wing candidates, which may push him further up the field as they are eliminated tomorrow. Meanwhile, if either O Riordain or Cuffe drop back as the counts continue, they could well end electing the other one.\n\n581 out of 949 seats filled in local elections\n\nAnother look at the lie of the land with 581 of the country's 949 local authority seats filled. Fine Gael still lead the way with 172 of those seats, followed by Fianna Fail on 150 seats, and independents on 120. Sinn Fein has secured 47 seats.\n\nIn terms of the parties' share of the vote, Fine Gael and Fianna Fail are each on 22.9%, independents got 20.8%, and Sinn Fein is on 11.9%. Sinn Fein's vote is down by 12.6% compared to its result in the 2020 general election. Interestingly, independents and others combined have increased their share of the vote by exactly the same percentage.\n\nFine Gael's vote is up by 2% compared to 2020, and Fianna Fail has increased its vote by 0.7%.\n\n'Harris should capitalise on bounce by calling early election' - Ring\n\nVeteran Fine Gael TD Micheal Ring has said Taoiseach Simon Harris has given the party \"an enormous bounce\" and he should \"capitalise on it\" by calling a general election as early as September.\n\nMr Ring told the Connaught Telegraph that he was sure the Taoiseach would choose the right time.\n\n\"I think it should be called for next September or October. Our new party leader, Simon Harris, has given Fine Gael an enormous bounce and it's important to capitalise on it,\" he said.\n\n\"The local and European elections have shown that our popularity and strength is restored at a time when Sinn Fein has gone into sudden decline. It's important to pick the right time and I am sure the Taoiseach will do so, and I will be supporting him 100 percent.\""
