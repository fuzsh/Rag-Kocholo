        "text": "Fans of the hit series Lost are buzzing with excitement as a new show is announced two decades after the original series premiered. A documentary, set to debut in September 2024, will delve into the success story of the cult favorite show that spanned six seasons. The film, titled Getting LOST, will narrate how the program became a massive hit among fans.\n\nIn addition, there will be a special screening in London of the very first episode, which originally aired on 22 September 2004. The documentary, Getting LOST, is also expected to address the controversy surrounding the series finale, which has been widely regarded as one of the most misunderstood endings in television history.\n\nThe documentary will feature several familiar faces from the original cast, including Evangeline Lilly (Kate), Daniel Dae Kim (Jin), Henry Ian Cusick (Desmond), Emilie De Ravin (Claire), Nestor Carbonell (Richard), Josh Holloway (Sawyer), Terry O'Quinn (Locke), Maggie Grace (Shannon), Jorge Garcia (Hurley), Michael Emerson (Ben), Malcolm David Kelley (Walt), Elizabeth Mitchell (Juliet) and Sonya Walger (Penny).\n\nZac Efron breaks silence after horror swimming pool accident after fall that left him 'unrecognizable'\n\nNicola Coughlan starred in 'addicting' racy show on Amazon Prime before Bridgerton and Derry Girls\n\nShowrunners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse will also make appearances. The documentary is set to premiere in Los Angeles on 22 September, reports the Mirror.\n\nFilm director Taylor Morden is at the helm of an exciting new project, celebrating one of television's most iconic shows. He expressed his enthusiasm, saying: \"We are thrilled to be able to tell the story of one of the greatest television shows of all time! This project has truly been a labor of love. It's hard to believe that it has been 20 years since we first saw that plane crash on the beach and wondered what was shaking the trees and why there was a polar bear on a tropical island.\"\n\nLoyal followers of 'Lost' received mixed news earlier this year when the series landed on Netflix, becoming available for streaming in the US but remaining inaccessible to UK viewers. Nevertheless, UK fans have not been left stranded. Every single one of the 121 episodes of 'Lost' can now be found on Disney+, with access coming as part of the standard plan that includes ads, starting from a mere £4.99 a month.\n\nFor all the latest news straight to your inbox, sign up for our FREE newsletters here.\n\nIf adverts aren't your cup of tea, an ad-free option is yours for £7.99 per month, while those craving a superior visual experience can opt for the premium plan at £10.99 monthly, which offers 4K viewing. Additionally, die-hard enthusiasts have the alternative to buy individual episodes or the complete first season from Amazon Prime Video, with prices beginning at £2.49 per episode or a full season pass for £14.99.\n\nALL THE LATEST ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\nMuch of the show was famously filmed in Oahu, Hawaii, and was notoriously costly to make the pilot episode alone came with a staggering price tag exceeding $14 million."
