I have campaigned to protect workers rights, fight the rising cost of living and protect public spaces. When the far right held a number of rallies outside of the Cork library, I joined the wider community in Cork countered them.\n\nI am running in the June 2024 local elections to be a strong representative for the people of Cork City South Central. I will fight against the scourge of dereliction and for public housing for all, against the political class and landlords.

I have experienced at first-hand the failure of the government to provide affordable housing for all. While I initially studied Poetry I changed careers after witnessing the impact of the housing crisis.\n\nI now work as an educator in Ballyfermot Youthreach with vulnerable teenagers.

I joined People Before Profit because it offers an alternative to the right-wing establisment.\n\nWe can build an alternative, united Ireland where housing and public services are genuinely affordable and accessible.\n\nVote People Before Profit No.1 this June\n\nI’m a visual artist from Ranelagh. I attended the local Gaelscoil and I’m passionate about Irish language and culture.\n\nI joined People Before Profit after returning from art college abroad when I saw friends, family and people from around the country being forced to emigrate for work and better quality of life, an ever growing statistic of nationals and immigrants being locked into homelessness and social housing tenants being disregarded by the council for minor and major issues to rectify in their homes.\n\nI’m an active member in my local People Before Profit branch and have campaigned for full Palestinian liberation, BDS, housing, immigration rights and anti-racism.\n\nI believe People Before Profit are a party for all and support local communities rather than our current government that exploit essential workers, have destroyed the public sector and have exasperated Ireland having the worst biodiversity in the EU.\n\nBernard is a full time carer and has been actively involved in the disability and caring movement for 10 years.\n\nHe has been very involved in fighting for the rights of workers, most notably the Debenhams workers, and last summer he spent the entire summer on the picket line supporting Iceland workers for their entitlements.\n\nHe first ran for for council in 2019 and received over 700 first preference votes.

He is a member of CATU (Community Action Tenants’ Union) and United Against Racism.\n\nEoghan played a key role in the campaign to save the Cobblestone pub in Smithfield. He believes the housing crisis and the loss of cultural space in the city are caused by the same profit-driven approach that has failed ordinary people.\n\nEoghan believes in an eco-socialist approach to the environmental crisis, that takes on the major polluting corporations and improves the lives of ordinary people. To do this, we need to build people power movements to fight for change.\n\n“If elected I will continue to defend the vulnerable, support students and young people, stand in solidarity with workers fighting for housing, fair pay and protect vital services”.\n\nBrigid Purcell is a young community activist and worker from Ringsend.

I have experienced all the challenges faced by our young people directly and I am all too aware of the underlying problems that decades of neglect by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have brought to Longford with their fondness for merely playing lip service to the real issues, while working hard to keep their wealthy friends happy at the expense of wider society -> the rest of us!\n\nI have been politically active for over 30 years and a member of People Before Profit for 8 years.

Our communities in Clondalkin, Rathcoole, Newcastle, Saggart, and Brittas are fast-growing, but local and national government have failed to ensure that there are enough services, school places and housing for everyone.\n\nI have been campaigning against dereliction, and against vulture funds buying up much-needed homes in our communities.

She sits on the board of North Clondalkin Community Development Programme and Clondalkin Drugs & Alcohol Task Force.\n\nI’m a 28 year old who is a victim of the housing crisis. I’m spending €1,500 a month for a small one bed apartment with my partner. More than 50% of my monthly wage goes towards rent alone. That’s before considering any other bills.\n\nNone of my friends have any hope of being able to buy a home. Lots of them have been forced to emigrate.\n\nThat’s why I joined People Before Profit and got active in trying to fight for housing and climate action, for a future for my generation.\n\nI’m also a member of ‘Love Rovers Hate Racism’. I think it’s vital that we stand up against those who want to spread hatred and fear.\n\nI am a Care Worker who became involved in activism after seeing the effects of the cuts to services and austerity enacted by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil on the people I support.\n\nI have campaigned for equality and justice for workers as a Trade Union activist.

I campaigned for abortion rights. As a former climate scientist, I have been particularly active in fighting for eco-socialist change.\n\nLocally, I helped establish the campaign to make Watergate Park a safe place. This won the installation of lights, more bins and family picnic benches. I have also led the campaign for a zebra crossing on Sylvan Drive in Kingswood.\n\nI have lived in Waterford City since 2016 from Cork to study in W.I.T. Ever since then I have called Waterford home. I have worked in several different areas from coaching to retail along with volunteering with different groups.\n\nI have been involved in a wide range of political campaigns from housing to education. I am an advocat for mental health as there is a lack of services in Waterford and it’s a growing issue.\n\nIn 2022 I became the first SU President of the S.E.T.U Students’ Union on the Waterford campus. I represented over 10,000 students at all levels from local to national level in areas such as accommodation, rent, cost of living, college fees, finances and much more.\n\nWith the experience I have gained over the years I want to put that to work to help Waterford, give it the representation it deserve and deliver the change that is needed.\n\nAisling Hudson’ political journey sprang from the housing and healthcare crises. Although homeless, with health problems, she returned to education in 2018, graduating first in her class, majoring in social policy and sociology.\n\n“From my background I see obvious solutions to common social problems.\n\nI have strongly campaigned for universal housing and mental health services, safe access to cannabis and other drugs to reduce deaths, a complete review of Irish/European migration policies, and against the current genocide in Gaza.\n\nI will continue to fight for the exploited, and against the super-rich, because profiteers have no place in any sustainable society.”\n\nLorraine has lived in Arklow all her life and is a mother of a young family. She understands the challenges of working mothers in Ireland today and is passionate about fighting for equal rights in our schools. She plans to focus her energy on fighting for special needs facilities and positions, universal access to mental health services, proper dental care for all and, of course, housing for all at affordable rates with security of tenure. As the government implement cutback after cutback, Lorraine is determined to bring working-class peoples’ voices to any table she gets access to.\n\nIn previous campaigns, Lorraine knocked on every door in Arklow, advocating for women’s right to choose and again on marriage equality. Equality is close to Lorraine’s heart, making her a perfect election candidate for People Before Profit.\n\nIt would be an honour to represent the people of Greystones, Delgany, Kilcoole, Newcastle and Killadreenan.\n\nArriving in Greystones in 2017, my introduction to this wonderful community was canvassing to Repeal the Eighth Amendment. Recently, I’ve been actively campaigning to end homelessness with the Community Action Tenants Union (CATU), working with United Against Racism Wicklow, and North Wicklow Against Genocide.
