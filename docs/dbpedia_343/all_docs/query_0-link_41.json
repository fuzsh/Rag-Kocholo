Mac Manus\n\nSeconded by Councillor J. Mc Garry\n\nAND AGREED\n\n“proposed revised wording of Section 4.2.3 Rural-generated housing, to incorporate:\n\nreference to returning emigrants; and\n\nvariation made by Members to current Plan on 10.10.03\n\n4.2.3 Rural-generated housing\n\nThis is defined as housing relating to:\n\nPersons employed in rural areas with a need to live in the locality, for example, those working in agriculture, forestry, horticulture, tourism and other rural-based activities;\n\nPersons who do not work on the land, but who have a vital link to the area in question via close family ties, including returning emigrants; and /or\n\nPersons whose primary employment is in County Sligo and who can demonstrate the need to live in a rural location because of that employment or other social reasons, or whose employment would provide a service to the local community.\n\nIn applying sympathetic consideration to bona fide farmers, returning emigrants and such applicants claiming exceptional social circumstances, the over-riding concern of the Council will be the resultant net community benefit accruing to an area by permitting further residential development, particularly in areas of population decline and/or where local rural services are under threat e.g. Clár areas. Whilst each individual case will be considered on its merits, the carrying capacity of the landscape in absorbing new development will be the determining factor. In other areas, development will be assessed with respect to its sustainability and to the specific design requirements as set out in Section 9.1.2 Rural housing.\n\nThe Council will endeavour to accommodate rural-generated housing in all rural areas, including Rural Areas Under Urban Influence and Rural Areas in Need of Regeneration (refer to subsection 4.2.6).\n\n4.2.3.1 Rural Housing – Operational Footnote\n\nOperationally, the following matters will apply to planning permissions in rural areas with respect to “sterilisation agreements” and “occupancy conditions”:\n\n“Sterilisation Agreements” should be used only in exceptional circumstances and are not to be applied in areas in need of rural regeneration.\n\nAny “Sterilisation Agreement” should only cover a portion of the land holding of which the site is the subject of a planning application and should not cover other unattached land holdings owned by the Applicant /Landowner.\n\nOccupancy conditions should only be applied in limited circumstances in rural areas under urban influence and should include a clause allowing the planning authority to lift the restriction in exceptional circumstances”.\n\nSUBMISSION 82,\n\nISSUES NUMBERED 11-22:\n\nThe members agreed with the Managers recommendations in relation to these issues.\n\nSUBMISSIONS 91-103, ISSUE 1:\n\nProposed by Councillor S.
