You can select from the drop-down menu below to find the results in your area.\n\nFrom our European correspondent Jack Power in Brussels\n\nEuropean Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has said the early results of the European elections showed the centre was “holding”, in the face of threats from the political extremes.\n\nWhile far-right parties have made significant gains in several European countries, the current governing majority of the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP), centre-left Socialists and Democrats (S&D) and centrist Renew will remain intact.\n\nAn initial projection based on early voting results from 17 countries, as well as exit polls and other data from the 10 other countries, shows the EPP will take 189 of the available 720 seats in the European Parliament. The S&D are projected to maintain their existing levels of support on 135 seats, while Renew will lose about a fifth of its MEPs, down from 102 to 80 seats.\n\n[ Read the full story here: Centre ‘holding’ in face of far-right parties, says von der LeyenOpens in new window ]\n\nWhat we know so far\n\nSo the narrative of this morning remains the same. It’s been a poor day for Sinn Féin. They are likely to get more seats than in 2019 but that’s not going to butter any turnips. That was an appalling election for the party. It was hoping to double its representation and then some. It didn’t happen. Migration as an issue affected the party.\n\nWhen its support began to dip, its strategy of running loads of candidates backfired. The brand did not do it the same service as 2020. Its candidates were not as visible on the ground wearing down shoe leather as their rivals from the two parties.\n\nA big dilemma now for the party is: how many candidates will it run in the general election? Too many. Bad. Too few. Bad. It’s going to be tricky.\n\nFine Gael had a slightly better election than Fianna Fáil but both will be pleased overall. Right now Fine Gael has just over 200 seats with Fianna Fáil on 180. The Greens less so. It was not a calamity but the party is slipping and will have to do something to arrest that decline in the next six months.\n\nIt was a great day for the Social Democrats and for Labour, with each looking poised to make significant gains in the locals. The Soc Dems are already on 30, 11 ahead of the 2019 total. Labour is on 45, and is likely to exceed the 57 seats it won five years ago. People Before Profit looks like it could make gains and has taken the seats on the last count in a number of LEAs across Dublin. It now stands at 9. Aontú has also taken some six seats, including two in Fingal\n\nThe far-right and anti-migration candidates have won about eight seats nationally, with four on Dublin City Council It’s not a surge or anything like that but cannot be ignored.\n\nAs against that, there are over 20 people from different ethnic backgrounds who have been elected to our councils for all parties. They provide a powerful antidote to the anti-migrant narrative.\n\nSome of the counts have been completed but some will continue until tomorrow. There are recounts in three LEAs in Wexford, one in Mullingar, and one in Dún Laoghaire where Cormac Lucey, the independent candidate was narrowly defeated in the final count.\n\nDublin City Council has concluded. Here is a full list of councillors.\n\nIn terms of the European Elections, the only solid information we have is from Dublin where Barry Andrews and Regina Doherty have both received over 16 per cent of the vote and look home and hosed. They are well ahead of everybody else. At least five candidates will fight it out for the last two seats: Lynn Boylan; Ciaran Cuffe; Aodhán Ó Riordáin; Clare Daly; and Niall Boylan. All are 30,000 plus or minus five, with between 40,000 and 50,000 transfers required to reach the quota.\n\nIreland South and Midlands North West will not finish their first counts until tomorrow so not until then will we know the shape of the parties. Sinn Féin has a fight on its hands in Dublin – could that be the case in the other two constituencies where it has also run two candidates?\n\nThat’s me done for tonight. I will be back to play the sweeper role for The Irish Times live coverage of the count tomorrow evening.\n\nFollow our European results hub for Dublin with all the figures, percentages and counts\n\nMore facts and figures and permutations than Leaving Cert maths\n\n[ European Election: Dublin resultsOpens in new window ]\n\nTaoiseach claims people don’t want Sinn Féin’s brand of change\n\nTim O’Brien writes\n\nThe electorate has told Opposition leader Mary Lou McDonald they do not want her type of change, Taoiseach Simon Harris said on Sunday night.\n\nSpeaking as he arrived at the count centre in his home constituency of Wicklow, Mr Harris immediately declared Fine Gael had done “extremely well” and had confounded those who said the electorate who wanted a political game change.\n\nThe real winner tonight!\n\nNever worries about getting boxed in!\n\nLast seat and possibly second last seat in play in Dublin\n\nIt’s going to be a cliffhanger of a battle in Dublin for the third and fourth seats with a group of five candidates grouped closely together.\n\nThe quota is 20 per cent plus one vote in this four-seat constituency. Translated into English, that is 75,345 votes. No candidate has come close to topping the poll in the first count.\n\nTwo candidates are so far ahead of the others they cannot be caught.\n\nBarry Andrews of Fianna Fáil tops the poll with 16.5 per cent of the vote (62,147). He is closely followed by Regina Doherty of Fine Gael with 16.3 per cent of the vote (61,344).\n\nSinn Féin’s Lynn Boylan is third with 35,431 votes (9.4 per cent). However, she will be bolstered by running mate Daithí Doolan who won 10,766 votes (2.9 per cent).\n\nSinn Féin may regret running a two-candidate strategy, but it was decided at the time when the party was running high in the polls and the leading party in Dublin.\n\nThe party is not as transfer-friendly as it was in 2019. Not all of Doolan’s votes will transfer although Sinn Féin tends to be more disciplined in that regard to other parties.\n\nCiarán Cuffe of the Greens is still in the mix and cannot be written off. He has won 8.5 per cent of the vote or 32,204 votes. He is in fourth place and almost 2,000 ahead of Independent Ireland’s Niall Boylan, the radio presenter, and Labour’s Aodhán Ó Riordáin. Cuffe’s task will be to stay ahead of Boylan and Ó Riordáin, and also Clare Daly of Independents 4 Change.\n\nÓ Riordáin has done well securing 8.2 per cent of the vote and 30,733 votes. Niall Boylan has 30,637 votes and he will need a lot of transfers from other candidates to overtake both Ó Riordáin and Cuffe.\n\nDaly has 26,855 votes (7.1 per cent) and will need to rely on very heavy transfers from Bríd Smith of People Before Profit (PBP), who won 5.7 per cent of the vote (21,577), if she has any chance.\n\nSinéad Gibney of the Social Democrats has won 4.3 per cent of the vote (a little ahead of the party’s profile) and her 16,319 votes could travel in the direction of Ó Riordáin and perhaps Cuffe.\n\nAisling Considine of Aontú has won a respectable 10,693. Niall Boylan could get some transfers from her and will also look to newly elected councillor Malachy Steenson (7,128 votes) and other right-wing candidates, who are hovering at 1 per cent and below, for transfers. But it’s a big ask for him to bridge the gap.\n\nAt the moment, it looks like the first two seats for Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, and then Sinn Féin, the Greens, Labour, Niall Boylan and Clare Daly all vying for the last two seats, with Sinn Féin’s Lynn Boylan perhaps a nose ahead of the other candidates.\n\nAndrews tops poll in Dublin\n\nFianna Fáil’s Barry Andrews looks poised to win the first seat in the Dublin constituency after winning over 62,000 votes in the first count. He finished just ahead of Regina Doherty, who also looks likely to win a seat in the four-seat constituency.\n\nDespite a fall in the Sinn Féin vote, Lynn Boylan has finished third with over 35,000 votes. With her running mate Daithí Doolan getting almost 11,000 votes, she is well placed to win a seat.\n\nThere are a large number of candidates clustered around 30,000 votes and all will be in contention for the final seat. Ciaran Cuffee of the Greens has 32,000 and Aodhan O’Riordan and Niall Boylan are both just over 30,000,\n\nClaire Daly is a little further back at 26,000.\n\nPolitical drubbing for Macron’s centrists had a sense of inevitability\n\nJack Power writes\n\nThe European election results could not have come as a shock to French president Emmanuel Macron.\n\nFor months his centrist coalition has been trailing way behind Marine Le Pen’s far right National Rally in the polls.\n\nMacron, who has been one of the big beasts of European politics for years, had tried in vain to kick-start the flagging campaign.\n\nThe far right’s campaign had been led by the 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, a National Rally MEP who has become a fresh, popular face in French politics. Savvy on social media, Bardella had pitched the European elections as a vote on Macron’s record.\n\nExit polls show the National Rally winning 31 per cent of the vote, to become one of the largest parties in the European Parliament. Macron’s centrist coalition are predicted to secure half of that, at 15 per cent.\n\nFive years ago the two parties were neck and neck, now the distance in support between the centre and the far right is jarring.\n\nA traditional anti-immigrant and Eurosceptic party, National Rally has made gains by targeting bread and butter issues like the cost of living crisis, and may win close to 30 seats, up from their current 18. Le Pen has also tried to soften the party’s image, ahead of a run for president in 2027.\n\nThe disastrous result this weekend could have been even worse for the current French president, as at one point it looked like his group would finish third rather than second.\n\nIn a dramatic response on Sunday night, Mr Macron decided to call a snap parliamentary election, despite his current unpopularity among the public.\n\nThe first round of the parliamentary election will be held in just three weeks, on June 30th, with a run-off on July 7th.\n\nTwo councillors who left FF over migrant accommodation in Galway are elected\n\nJohn Fallon writes\n\nNoel Thomas, who resigned from Fianna Fáil in a row over their accommodation policy for refugees, has topped the poll in Connemara South and will be re-elected.\n\nSeamus Walsh, who left Fianna Fáil for a similar reason, was re-elected in Connemara North yesterday after significantly increasing his vote.\n\nBoth were involved in protests against a proposed accommodation centre for asylum seekers in Roscahill, close to Lough Corrib. The party initiated internal action against both councillors but they resigned before the process began. Walsh stood as an Independent while Thomas joined Independent Ireland.\n\nTwo Thirds of Seats Filled in local council elections\n\nWe are beginning to quickly (or less slowly) move towards the end game of the local election count, as we brace ourselves for the next endurance race, otherwise known as the European election counts.\n\nThere has been a lot happening. We have seen Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael view for top spot. Sinn Féin is now winning more seats and will soon pass the 80 it won in 2019 but it’s still long way off its targets.\n\nThe Social Democrats have already exceeded their total of 19 in 2019, with 22 seats so far. PBP are on 6 and the Greens are on 12, which is considerably down from this stage of the count five years ago.\n\nIt is noteworthy that about seven anti-immigration activists have been elected, three of them on Dublin City Council, with a fourth likely to be elected in Artane. It is still 7 out of 949 but it is not insignificant.\n\nVideo of elections of candidates in Dublin including anti-immigration activist Gavin Pepper and Felin Jose of the Green Party.\n\nEnda O’Dowd captures the scenes at the RDS on Sunday evening.\n\nCentre majority in European Parliament to hold, despite far right gains\n\nJack Power writes\n\nOverall, European People’s Party (EPP), the centre right group which includes Fine Gael MEPs, is expected to remain as the largest grouping in the European Parliament.\n\nThe EPP is forecast to win 186 of the available 720 seats, with the centre left Socialists and Democrats (S&D) is predicted to take 133 seats.\n\nCentrist group Renew, which includes Fianna Fáil MEPs, will drop to 82 seats from 102, according to a projection of the make-up of the next parliament.\n\nThe projection was based on exit polls from 15 countries and surveys taken during campaigns where exit polls were not conducted.\n\nThe Green grouping is forecast to lose a significant portion of its seats, falling from 71 to 53 seats. Hard right and far right parties, which are splintered between groupings, are expected to take north of 160 seats in the new parliament, according to the projection.\n\nAn update on the snap election called by President Macron.\n\nIn France, National Rally (Rassamblement National) won 33 per cent of the vote, according to exit polls, compared to the Centrist Alliance of President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nMacron’s rationale was that an election was needed because he could not consider a France that did not believe in a united and strong Europe. He said he was giving the choice to the French people.\n\nIt is a high-risk strategy and could strengthen the hand of Marine le Pen ahead of the next Presidential elections.\n\nCiara Mageean wins gold for Ireland\n\nJust in from Ian O’Riordan in Rome\n\nAnother generation of the Haughey family elected in Dublin\n\nMartin Wall writes from Fingal\n\nA grandson of Charles Haughey, Cathal, has been elected for Fianna Fáil in the Howth-Malahide LEA.\n\nBarry Andrews says he will be the first Fianna Fáil MEP reelected in Dublin in 25 years\n\nBarry Andrews arrived in the RDS this evening where Cormac McQuinn and other reporters caught up with hi. He said that it was a difficult campaign but he tried to put forward a positive EU message at a time when there was increasing ideological fervour on the extremes of the political spectrum”. Here’s some of what he said to Cormac.\n\nThe State of Play\n\nWe are now just an hour from the first announcements being opened in the European elections. We are not expecting any of the Irish first counts to be announced at 10pm.\n\nFianna Fáil and Fine Gael are very close in the local elections. Fianna Fáil at 23 per cent has marginally higher percentage support than its Coalition partner (22.8) but Fine Gael has more seats (173 to 147). The highest percentage support has gone to the Independents.\n\nOf the smaller parties it has been a good election for the Social Democrats. At this stage, it is only one short of its 2019 total (it has 18 seats right now). Labour has also had a good day and could surpass its 2019 total of 57 seats.\n\nThere was no big breakthrough by the far-right but that is not to say it did not advance somewhate. Three explicitly anti-migration candidates elected in Dublin is not irrelevant.\n\nAnd the moment when JHJ cajoled the Taoiseach into the Inside Politics podcast\n\nJack Horgan-Jones was in the RDS giving his tuppence worth to Hugh Linehan on when the next election would be held. And then who hoved into view only Simon Harris. With a ‘G’wan, g’wan, g’wan’ worthy of Mrs Doyle, the intrepid Horgan-Jones press-ganged the Taoiseach into making his debut on the Inside Politics podcast. Naturally, he was a little nervous but he acquitted himself well.\n\nIf there’s smoke, there’s a Healy Rae homecoming!\n\nJerry O’Sullivan of Radio Kerry captured this on his drive into Kilgarvan this evening. Our late colleague Michael O’Regan would have loved it.\n\nWith Gavin Pepper’s election there are three anti-migrant councillors on Dublin City Council\n\nOlivia Kelly writes\n\nGavin Pepper an anti-immigration activist with a prominent social media presence has become the third far-right candidate elected in Dublin city, joining Malachy Steenson and Phil Sutcliffe. The Independent councillor has been a leader in several recent anti-immigration demonstrations.\n\nA proponent of the view that “Ireland is full” Pepper attended a protest in the city centre in May of last year that ended with a migrant camp on Sandwith Street being set alight. Pepper later said gardaí raided his house and accused him of being responsible.\n\nHe also encouraged crowds to gather in the city centre in the wake of the stabbing of three children and a carer on Parnell Square last November.\n\n“Everyone city centre tonight 7pm no excuses everyone out enough is enough,” he said in a later-deleted post on X, formerly Twitter. The ensuing riots resulted in extensive damage in the city centre with buses and a Luas tram set alight and shops looted.\n\nPepper was also present at the infamous demonstration outside Leinster House last September which featured a noose.\n\nHis is the third anti-migrant candidate to be elected to the Council, following the election of Malachy Steenson in the North Inner City and the Conor McGregor-backed Phil Sutcliffe, who also stood on an anti-migrant platform in Ballyfermot.\n\nDublin Mayor de Róiste loses Council seat, anti-migrant candidate elected\n\nOlivia Kelly writes\n\nIndependent Ireland candidate Phil Sutcliffe, a former boxer and boxing coach for UFC fighter Conor McGregor’s, is the second far right candidate elected to Dublin City Council following Malachy Steenson.\n\nSutcliffe, whose campaign was supported by McGregor ran on an anti-immigration platform. He was elected to the Ballyfermot Drimnagh area on the 10th count, along with Ray Cunningham of the Green Party.\n\nSutcliffe and Cunningham were over 300 votes ahead of Fianna Fáil Lord Mayor Daithí de Róiste after the votes of Sophie Niccolaud were distributed.\n\nMacron dissolves French parliament and calls Snap Election\n\nFrench president Emmanuel Macron has dissolved the national assembly and announced a snap election on June 30th and July 7th.\n\nAfter exit polls showed that Marine le Pen’s right-wing National Rally had won 31.5 per cent of the vote, more than double that of the president’s list (party), Mr Macron said in a national address that it was pointless to pretend that nothing had happened.\n\nThe move was unexpected and came as a shock. Mr Macron argued the EU parliament election results was not good for his party or for France and warned about the rise of nationalism, which he described as a danger to France and to Europe.\n\nLord Mayor of Cork shows off dance moves after being elected\n\nKieran McCarthy did not disguise his excitement when his election was announced in the South East Ward of Cork City Council. An impressive spin was followed by a quick two-step of delight.\n\nLisa Chambers says Sinn Féin drop has put her “in the mix” for fifth seat in MNW\n\nFiachra Gallagher writes from Castlebar\n\nLisa Chamber told reporters in Castlebar on Sunday that she was confident her party would win at least one seat in Midlands North West (MNW), and predicated that she would “be in the mix” for the fifth and final seat.\n\n“There appears to be a decline in the Sinn Féin support base that we weren’t expecting, certainly on the level that’s there, that’s shaking things up a little bit,” she said.\n\nMs Chambers attributed the slump in Sinn Féin support to “errors” in recent months – namely their messaging on immigration and housing. “They’ve tried to be all things to all people,” she said.\n\nA first count in MNW is not expected until Monday evening at the earliest.\n\nRight-wing candidate Philip Dwyer removed from South Dublin count centre after ‘altercation’.\n\nSarah Burns writes\n\nThe right-wing anti-migration candidate, Philip Dwyer, has been removed by gardaí from the Weston Centre, where the South Dublin local election count is being held.\n\nDwyer, who styles himself as a citizen journalist, is believed to have become involved in an altercation with Gino Kenny and Paul Murphy, both TDs with People Before Profit.\n\nA spokesperson for South Dublin County Council said that “gardaí removed a candidate from the Weston Airport count centre this evening following an altercation with another candidate at the centre”.\n\nDwyer is a candidate in Tallaght Central standing for Ireland First. He received 556 votes in the first count and is unlikely to get elected in the six-seater.\n\nMicheál Martin says he did not foresee extent of drop in Sinn Féin support\n\nBarry Roche writes\n\nTánaiste Micheál Martin says he was surprised by the collapse of Sinn Féin vote down to 11pc and said he didn’t see it coming to that extent\n\nBut he also warned against commentators attaching too much importance to opinion polls as they don’t always capture the mood on the ground and don’t capture the importance of campaigns.\n\nHe expressed satisfaction with the party’s performance in Europe pointing out that Billy Kelleher is on course to hold his seat in Ireland South while he still had hopes that Cynthia ni Mhurchu would be in the mix for the final seat\n\nSecond Female Poll Topper in County Meath\n\nLouise Walsh Ferriter writes\n\nFine Gael has a second woman poll topper after Cllr Sharon Tolan took the first seat in Laytown/Bettystown area of Meath Co. Council.\n\nShe had 1,782 first preference votes, exceeding the quota of 1,681.\n\nWith five seats now filled in the county, the count stands at three FG and two independents. There is still along way to go to fill the remaining 35 seats.\n\nNew Soc Dem councillor elected in leader Holly Cairn’s constituency\n\nfrom David Forsythe\n\nHolly Cairns was an unexpected winner of a council seat in west Cork in 2109. And her margin was the thinnest possible. She won the last seat by a single vote after rechecks and a recount. Less than a year later she was a TD. Now, five years later she is leader of the Social Democrats.\n\nIt has been a good day for the Soc Dems in Cairn’s home patch. Two of its candidates could be elected in West Cork. A short while ago, Ann Bambury was the first; elected in Bandon Kinsale, taking the fourth seat. She exceeded the quota of 2,379 on the seventh count.\n\nThe State of Play – Half Way There\n\nWe have reached the half way point of the local election count. As of now there are 475 seats filled. Fine Gael leads the way with 138 seats, followed by Fianna Fáil with 123. There is battle between the two traditional parties as to who will be the largest. Fianna Fáil won that contest in 2019 but it looks like Fine Gael will be slightly ahead this time around, albeit with some relatively small seat losses for both parties. Fianna Fáil won 279 five years ago but won’t emulate that feat.\n\nDoes this signal an early election? No, says Taoiseach Simon Harris. “I have been Taoiseach of this country for 61 days. I promised the people we would hit the ground running and I would bring an energy to the campaign trail and to Government buildings.\n\n“I want to continue that work tomorrow. There is lots of work to be done.\n\n“That the Government will do its full term is important and I look forward to continuing that.”\n\nFor now, that is.\n\nTwo months ago Sinn Féin would have been vying with the other two. But a precipitous drop in its poll ratings in addition to a poor candidate strategy have combined to suppress the surge that everybody expected from the main Opposition party. The party’s reverse engineering after the 2020 election has backfired.\n\nThen, it ran too few candidates and left nine or ten gains in the Dáil behind.\n\nIt has now over-compensated and has ran too many.\n\nIn Dublin South West Inner City, it ran three in a ward where it could take one seat at most. The same was true of Mary Lou McDonald’s own bailiwick of Cabra-Glasnevin where it ran four candidates.\n\nAt this moment in time it has 36 seats and only 11.6 per cent of the vote. That is a third of the heady support levels it was getting in the opinion polls until recent months.\n\nFianna Fáil and Fine Gael are both on about 23 per cent support. There is also evidence the parties are transferring to each other, although it seems the traffic is heavier coming from the Fine Gael side!\n\nThe party’s poor performance has been the prime story from these elections. Sure it will make gains but it was starting from a low base. It won only 80 seats in 2019, compared to 160 in 2014. Another factor was that the party had too many new and inexperience candidates. Some months ago, rivals from other parties in County Galway told me they saw no evidence of Sinn Féin representatives at local meetings, or events, or on the streets. The party relied too heavily, they argued, on its overall branding and image, as well as social media. It is also true that the party lost some support on the back of the migration issue.\n\n“We have made some gains. They are modest, but they’re there. It hasn’t been our day. Clearly frustrations and indeed anger with Government policy, on this occasion, has translated into votes for Independents and others,” Ms McDonald said today.\n\nShe accepted the candidate strategy was not right.\n\n“In 2020 we didn’t run enough candidates and as you know I heard a message loud and clear in that regard. I wanted to be sure that we didn’t make that mistake again. I wanted to be sure that everybody, wherever you lived, that you would have a chance to vote for Sinn Féin candidates,” she said. “But look, clearly we didn’t get that right.”\n\nOf the other parties the Greens look like they will fall from about 50 councillors to mid 20s. The party’s support held up partially in Dublin but it has lost councillors in rural Ireland. Labour looks poised to make gains and there are signs of recovery of a party that some predicted might struggle for survival after the next election.\n\nThe Soc Dems also look they will make gains. In 2019, the party won a lot of the very last seats in marginal constituencies and has proved to be very transfer friendly.\n\nThe other big narrative is that of the Independent candidates who are sure better the total from 2109. There are now a number of alliances or groups with a cluster of independent councillors. The largest of them is the new whip-less party Independent Ireland, which may return up to 20 councillors, and possibly two MEPs. Then there are the Independents associated with Michael Lowry in Tipperary, Verona Murphy in Wexford, and the three single-issue Mica councillors in Donegal.\n\nSeven councillors elected on first count in much-delayed Longford counts\n\nJess Thompson writes\n\nIt’s all go in Longford now after a very long wait. The first count for Longford LEA has seen not one, not two, not three, but four councillors elected – all four of whom are sitting councillors in the area.\n\nGerry Hagan (FG) topped the poll with 1,071 votes, with Martin Monaghan (FF) coming in just behind him at 1,051 votes. Seamus Butler (FF) was just ten votes behind with 1,041, while Peggy Nolan (FG) won 890 votes.\n\nMeanwhile, the first count in Granard LEA has seen three elected in one fell swoop. Fine Gael’s Garry Murtagh topped the poll with 1,450 votes. Turlough ‘Pott’ McGovern (Ind) followed with 1,413 votes, while Paraic Brady (FG) won 1,211 votes.\n\nThe surplus votes for Paul Ross (FG) are currently being transferred in Ballymahon LEA following his election on the first count earlier this afternoon.\n\nThere are five seats still up for grabs in Ballymahon, with three remaining in Longford and just two in Granard.\n\nFar-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) makes gains in Germany\n\nDerek Scally writes from Berlin\n\nGermany’s European election result saw nearly every fourth voter choose populist parties on the right and left fringes, with losses for all three parties in the coalition of Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\n\nThe far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) finished up nearly six points in second place, according to early projections, with 16.5 per cent and 17 seats in the new parliament.\n\nMeanwhile the new Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW), a breakaway from the Linke (Left) with pro-Russian and anti-immigration policies, took 5.5 per cent from a standing start to take five seats.\n\nSome 22 per cent support for populist parties sent an alarming signal to Germany’s established parties, given AfD and BSW performed even stronger in eastern regions where voters choose new state parliaments in September.\n\nThe results mean considerable changes in the 96 German seats, the largest country bloc in the European Parliament.\n\nAmong Berlin’s warring three-party “traffic light” coalition, losses were most dramatic among the Green Party: it lost nearly nine points and could shed up to nine seats in the new parliament.\n\nFirst data from Eu-wide exit polls suggests gains for far right and losses for Greens\n\nJack Power writes from Brussels\n\nThe European Greens are projected to lose a large number of the seats they won five years ago, with exit polls indicating a big drop in support in their traditional heartland of Germany.\n\nWhile the far right Alternative for Germany (AfD) are set to become the second biggest party in Germany, despite a rocky campaign full of controversy.\n\nExit poll data shows the centre right Christian Democratic Union are to top the poll in Germany, with chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democratic Party (SDP) to finish in third place, behind AfD.\n\nThe far right Freedom Party of Austria are projected to top the poll there and gain a number of seats, with exit polls showing them finishing ahead of the centre right Austrian People’s Party and the centre left Social Democratic Party of Austria.\n\nIn Greece the centre right New Democracy will remain the largest party, with an exit poll showing it taking 30 per cent of the votes. Left wing Syriza are on course to finish as runners up, with around 16 per cent of the vote. Greek Solution, a far right party, is expected to be the fifth largest party, with exit polls show it winning about 8 per cent of votes.\n\nGeert Wilders’ far right Party for Freedom will gain several seats in the Netherlands, where support for centre parties appears to have held up well, according to exit polls.\n\nMichael Healy-Rae has the Last Word\n\nBack in April Green Party leader Eamon Ryan told a news conference that he had shocking news for the Healy Rae family. “The Kingdom is going Green,” he declared, predicting big seat gains for the party in the Kingdom at the expense of the Healy Raes.\n\nThe Kerry TD waited until today to give his response to Ryan. What do they say about revenge being a dish best served cold.\n\nAnd here it is:\n\nBritto Pereppadan (FG) follows his father, Baby, on to South Dublin County Council.\n\nFine Gael’s Britto Pereppadan (24) is elected on ninth count for Tallaght Central. His father, Baby Pereppadan, was elected for Tallaght South, earlier on sixth count.\n\nHere is Bryan O’Brien’s lovely video of that moment.\n\nDublin Lord Mayor Daithí de Róiste in battle to save his seat\n\nThe current Lord Mayor of Dublin Daithí de Róiste is in a struggle to regain his seat in the Ballyfermot-Drimnagh LEA.\n\nHe is currently lying fifth after the eighth count on 1,291 but only one vote ahead of Independent Philip Sutcliffe (1,290) and less than 200 votes ahead of the other remaining candidates, Sophie Nicollaud and Dolores Webster.\n\nWebster came to prominence as an anti-lockdown and anti-vaccine protester and de Róiste’s fate will depend on transfers. Nicollaud is a left-wing candidate and is part of the Independents 4 Change group.\n\nSutcliffe is the former boxing coach of Conor McGregor and is endorsed by the MMA fighter.\n\nIt’s very hard to predict where the transfers will go.\n\nAnother long-serving incumbent retains seat on Dublin City Council\n\nOlivia Kelly writes\n\nLong serving Independent councillor Cieran Perry is the first councillor elected on the 9th count in the extremely crowded field of Cabra-Glasnevin.\n\nPerry was first elected in 2009, topped the poll in 2014 and was comfortably re-elected in 2019. The Cabra-Glasnevin area has the highest number of candidates in running for Dublin City Council at 21.\n\nShay Brennan reelected to Dún Laoghaire Rathdown\n\nMarie O’Halloran writes\n\nFianna Fáil Cllr Shay Brennan has been re-elected to the Dundrum LEA of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown Council on the fourth count. He is the first of Fianna Fáil’s councillors to be re-elected. His colleague Cllr Colette O’Sullivan lost her seat in the Dún Laoghaire ward when she was excluded on the second count.\n\nGreen Party Cllr Tom Kivlehan was re-elected in Dún Laoghaire on the fifth count, the second councillor in that electoral area to be elected. Cllr Kivlehan said that he and poll topper Fine Gael Cllr Lorraine Hall were both in favour of the controversial Living Streets initiative in the town and they got the votes.\n\nPeople are in favour of green initiatives he said. The Living Streets initiative will allow for the main street to be both pedestrianised and for vehicular use but with priority for pedestrians. He added that there was no inclusion of cycle lanes. “That’s a myth,” he said.\n\nHi It’s Harry McGee taking over for the evening shift taking you into the wee hours.\n\nI’ve just come from The Irish Times podcast and we were audiobombed towards the end by Taoiseach Simon Harris who was visiting the count centre in the RDS.\n\nJack Horgan-Jones, intrepid as always, cajoled him into saying a few words to Hugh Linehan.\n\nWhat he had to say was interesting.\n\nWe had just been talking about the prospect of an early general election and Hugh told him we all believed it would be “bonkers” for the Government to wait until Spring.\n\n“My position in relation to the General election is the same,” he said.\n\n“I have been Taoiseach of this country for 61 days. I promised the people we would hit the ground running and I would bring an energy to the campaign trail and to Government buildings.\n\n“I want to continue that work tomorrow. There is lots of work to be done.\n\n“The Government will do its full term is important and I look forward to continuing that.”\n\nSo he is saying the Government will do his full term. And the Government will continue to say that until it says the Government is not doing its full term.\n\nThe Taoiseach was also interesting about the transfers that are passing between the Government parties.\n\n“There is no transfer pact between the Government parties and I don’t expect to be one,” he said.\n\n“What you are seeing now is an organic agreement between the Government parties.”\n\nThat’s a trend that will be evident as we go into the general election. Essentially, there will be an unspoken agreement between the parties in the expectation that the electorate will view them as a bloc.\n\nOkay, so that’s it from me, Conor Pope. I am leaving you in the more than capable hand of Harry McGee but in the words of the Terminator, I’ll be back ... from early tomorrow morning.\n\nScenes in the RDS as anti-immigration candidate Malachy Steenson is elected in the north inner city LEA.\n\nNEWS SNAP: Anti-immigration candidate Derek Blighe eliminated on sixth count in Fermoy.\n\nSinn Féin is back in Co Offaly after its 2019 wipeout, writes Ellen O’Riordan. First-timer Aoife Masterson won a seat in Tullamore on the fourth count. Her running mate Tim Farrell received just 201 first-preference votes and was eliminated on the second count. Fianna Fáil has run four candidates in Tullamore, two of which have been elected. Its other two are leading among those competing for the final two seats in this area.\n\nThey have their priorities right in Clare.\n\nHarris says position on early election ‘hasn’t changed’\n\nThe Taoiseach Simon Harris has said his position on when the general election should be held “hasn’t changed” despite Fine Gael’s success in the Local Elections.\n\nMr Harris has previously said he wanted the Coalition to continue for its full term, which would mean the general election would not happen until early next year.\n\nFine Gael may well end up as the largest party in Local Government after Friday’s vote while the main Opposition party, Sinn Féin is disappointed by their own results.\n\nSpeaking at the RDS count centre in Dublin, Mr Harris said: “I’ve answered this question many times since becoming Taoiseach ... but my position in relation to that hasn’t changed.”\n\nHe said he was “absolutely delighted with the performance of the Fine Gael team right across the country in rural Ireland and in urban Ireland.”\n\nMr Harris added that it was “great to see hard working councillors being rewarded” and he thanked people for voting for his party.\n\nAnti-immigration activist Steenson elected in Dublin’s north inner city\n\nAnti-immigration activist Malachy Steenson has been elected in the North Inner City becoming the first far-right councillor elected to Dublin City Council, writes Olivia Kelly.\n\nShortly after 3pm on Sunday Steenson’s supporters hoisted him aloft and declared him elected, posting the same across social media. He hadn’t been, and it was not until more than an hour and a half later that he was elected to the North Inner City area on the 12th count.\n\nSteenson a former Workers’ Party candidate has swung to the extreme opposite end of the political spectrum as a far-right activist.\n\nA solicitor, Steenson has a history of association with anti-immigration activists including Irish Freedom Party leader Hermann Kelly.\n\nSteenson led anti-immigration protests in East Wall in late 2022 and has shared social media posts referencing the “plantation” of migrants into Ireland as well as a video of an asylum seeker being told to “get your stuff and f**k off out”.\n\nA lifelong republican, Steenson was expelled from the Workers Party more than a decade ago for attending an anti-abortion rally.\n\nNEWS SNAP: The first count has been completed in Meath where Independent Cllr Noel French and Fine Gael Cllr Joe Fox were elected on the first count, writes Louise Walsh Ferriter. French, who left the Fine Gael party last year received over double the quota of 1,690 with an impressive 3,963 first preference votes.\n\nLooking good for FG in Longford\n\nFinally, we have Longford news from Jessica Thompson. Newly elected councillor Paul Ross (FG) has said he’s confident Fine Gael will do well across the county of Longford – including Ballymahon, where Colm Murray is in danger of losing his seat.\n\nCllr Ross soared into the lead in yesterday’s tallies and was elected this afternoon on the first count, with 1,300 votes (18.5 per cent), surpassing the quota by 297 votes.\n\n“I’m absolutely delighted,” he said. “This is a tough job and days like today with your family and getting a great vote – it’s what it’s all about.\n\n“I have been here on the other side of the coin, ten years ago when it took four days to get elected to the second last seat in the Ballymahon area – the fifth seat out of sixth – and today I got the first seat going in Ballymahon, so it’s very, very satisfying and I’m delighted.”\n\nHis party has polled well across Longford, particularly in Granard Municipal District, where tallies suggest four out of five seats will be taken by Fine Gael candidates.\n\n“I think Fine Gael have polled extremely well across the county. In Granard it looks like we’re going to get four (seats) out of five. In Longford town, we’re going to get three out of seven and, in Ballymahon, I’m still confident we can get three out of six,” he said. “We have very good candidates in Martin Skelly and Colm Murray.”\n\nHe recalled his time ten years ago when his election relied on transfers and said he is confident that Colm Murray will keep his seat.\n\nOh. Hi. They’re filled in Athenry\n\nAll even seats in Athenry-Oranmore in Galway are filled and announced, but word starting to emerge that Fine Gael may seek a recount as their candidate Eoghan Gallagher – who is President of Young Fine Gael – only lost out by 19 votes to another newcomer Cillian Keane of Fianna Fáil, reports John Fallon.\n\nChristy Burke is home and hosed in Dublin.\n\nJust some of the Healy Raes getting a lift in Kerry.\n\nNEWS SNAP: Athy councillor Aoife Breslin (Labour) has scored a stunning victory in her local electoral area.

The result of count the fourth count in Bailieborough-Cootehill has resulted in a tie between the two lowest candidates – Kristofer Shakelton (II) and Garry Cosgrove (Ind) who are each on 727 votes.\n\nThe Returning Officer, Lynda McGavigan, has acceded to a request for a full recount of those candidates’ votes. While they are both unlikely to be in contention for a seat, the order in which they are eliminated will have a major bearing on which candidates secure the remaining seats.\n\nNEWS SNAP: Ireland First’s Derek Blighe may be eliminated on Fermoy’s 6th count, reports Liz Dunphy. There was no one elected on the fifth count there are three seats to fill. Kay Dawson (FG) on 1,254 votes; Peter O’Donoghue (NP) 1,192 votes; Diarmuid Hanley (Lab) 1,125 votes. Blighe on 1,070 gained 69 transfers from outgoing cllr Frank Roche who was eliminated in the last round.\n\nThese things take time, lots and lots of time\n\nWe won’t have a result for the first count of the Midlands-North-West constituency until at least tomorrow afternoon, according to count staff.\n\nSome 320 counters are working their way through the hundreds of thousands of votes from across the vast constituency, sorting into pigeon holes and then stacking in piles of 50.\n\nIncumbent MEP Luke ‘Ming’ Flanagan said earlier that he booked a hotel room for the whole week.\n\nNEWS SNAP: All seven seats in Monaghan LEA now filled, reports Seanín Graham.

He admitted that had there been a leadership battle following Leo Varadkar’s stepping down as Fine Gael leader earlier this year, he would have voted for Paschal Donohoe – but Mr Harris’s energy has really impressed him, he said.\n\n“Certainly, Simon Harris, and I have to be very honest here, has done a superb job. He has really lifted us and he lifted the campaign.”\n\nNEWS SNAP: Sinn Féin retained their seat for the southeast Inner City LEA after Kourtney Kenny was elected following the 10th count.\n\nAnd on the other side of the country, the Belmullet LEA is complete. Gerry Coyle (FG) and Paul McNamara (FF) elected on the fourth count. McNamara got a tremendous vote from his native Achill. Sean Carey (FF) elected on the fifth and final count. All three councillors elected in 2019 returned again. Another massive blow for Sinn Féin in Mayo, who had high hopes for Rosaleen Dixon-Lally in Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh’s home constituency. Sinn Féin councillor Daniel Céitinn lost his seat in this LEA after the ninth count.\n\nShe didn’t use an ‘I’m Janet Horner, I’m in your corner’ slogan on her posters – or indeed anywhere else – which seems like an open goal missed to me, but she has still been re-elected as this video proves.\n\nNEWS SNAP: Half of the Monaghan county council’s 18 seats have now been filled, reports Seanín Graham. That’s three FG, three FF, two SF and one Independent. All eyes now on the Independent seat vacated by the local authority’s most colourful representative, Hugh McElvaney, who stepped down in Ballybay Clones after 50 years of service. SF hotly tipped to get it.\n\nNEWS SNAP: Sean Murray writes that we are “close to filling the remaining two seats in the Kilmuckridge LEA in Wexford. The SF candidate Declan Kenny has been eliminated so it’s a straight shoot-out between Paddy Kavanagh (Ind), Willie Kavanagh (FF) and Oliver Walsh (FG) for the last two seats.\n\nNEWS SNAP: The fourth count s under way in Bailieborough Cootehill. Just three votes separate the bottom two candidates – Kristofer Shekelton (II) and Garry Cosgrove (Ind) – with 12 of Carmel Brady’s surplus up for distribution. It’s as close as it can be but the order in which close candidates are eliminated will make or break the count for other candidates still in the race. The question on everyone’s lips here is – what happens if they are tied after the next count? Linda O’Reilly will have the answers presently.\n\nNews to gladden the heart in Galway\n\nThe count to elect the 18 councillors for Galway City Council has traditionally been like the city’s traffic – frustratingly slow – and this year will not be an exception with a third day of counting now inevitable after a full recount was called in one of the three wards, writes John Fallon.\n\nSo far, just five of the 18 councillors have been elected. Current mayor Eddie Hoare (FG) and former mayor Mike Cubbard (Ind) have been elected in Galway City Central, while in Galway City East three of the six seats have been filled with sitting councillors Alan Cheevers (FF), and Independents Declan McDonnell and Terry O’Flaherty elected.\n\nHowever, a full recount has now been called in this ward with four candidates chasing the remaining three seats. Aisling Burke of Sinn Féin and first-time Labour candidate Helen Ogbu look good to claim seats but with Shane Forde (FG) just 16 votes ahead of sitting councillor Mike Crowe, the Fianna Fáil candidate has sought a recount which Galway City Returning Officer Gary McMahon was ‘an acceptable request’.\n\nA full recount is now due to start at Westside Community Centre and with the count for the six seats in Galway City West not yet started, it’s inevitable the count will continue for a third day.\n\nDLR seats start to fill up\n\nThe Labour Party has had its second success in Dún Laoghaire Rathdown with the re-election of Cllr Carrie Smyth who topped the poll in the Killiney-Shankill electoral area with 13.4 per cent of the vote.\n\nMs Smyth said Labour has held its own in the constituency and expects to return five of its six electoral seats. “Unfortunately we’re not going to hold probably, the second seat in Killiney-Shankill”, held by retiring Cllr and outgoing mayor Denis O’Callaghan.\n\n“We’re doing extremely well nationally, a lot higher than the polls were giving us before this election, which was down to 3 per cent or 4 per cent” when the party was actually on around 10 per cent.\n\nCllr Smyth believed that “with the Simon surge there could be an early general election. People are talking about the 4th of July, quick and snappy,” she laughed.\n\nFine Gael has elected its sixth councillor after John Kennedy passed the quota on the second count in Stillorgan. All six are incumbents.\n\nIndependent Cllr Sean McLoughlin has topped the poll in Dundrum electoral area of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown with 16 per cent of the vote and has been returned on the first count along with Fine Gael Cllr Jim O’Leary.\n\nIt is the second poll topping performance for an Independent following the election of Michael Fleming Glencullen-Sandyford with 32.9 per cent of the vote. Both councillors said their election was not a reflection of a surge for Independents but based on their own hard work in their communities.\n\nCllr Fleming said he worked hard for his community. Mr Fleming who has two butchers shops in Stepaside and Kilmacud has often groups with free burgers and other food.\n\n“I’ve aways supported sports clubs and community groups, long before I became a councillor.

If you take the wider picture and the last two or three weeks we had Sinn Féin and Fine Gael polling in all of the opinion polls at 20-22 per cent, Fianna Fáil was apparently in the mid teens and that was kind of setting the wider analysis of the political picture entering into this local elections [but] we’re nip and tuck with Fine Gael about who will become the largest party local government.”\n\nHe said it was “clear that both parties are going to be strong forces across councils in across the country.

We had a fantastic team of canvassers over the last couple of weeks,” the 24 year old independent councillor said. “They put in Trojan work, there was no house in the constituency that we didn’t knock on the door.

Co-opted following the retirement of his father Donal less than a year ago, the firefighter battled to get on the ballot. Guidelines on council employees seeking election were changed on the eve of a court case brought by Grady challenging a Department of Housing circular to Kerry County Council on retained firefighters.\n\nGrady has been outspoken on immigration issues, with his first motion on the council last September calling for Ukrainian refugees who were working while living in hotels to pay towards their accommodation and other costs. He failed to get support.\n\nHe has also objected to the use of Killarney’s only homeless facility for Ukrainian refugees and has been outspoken on concerns about the opening of a fifth international protection centre in Killarney, at the Harmony Inn on Muckross Road.\n\nWith tallies putting him on some 2,000 first preferences, Grady is set to be 400 votes over the estimated quota of 1,700.\n\nSo, where are we now when it comes to the local election counts?

Asked if she believed a general election should be called sooner given the party’s good results, Ms O’Connell said that after a “bit of a rest” they would be out canvassing again, but it was not a decision for her. Pressed on whether that meant she wanted an earlier election she said she had always been known for not wanting to fight an election in the middle of November.\n\nFine Gael Minister of State Neale Richmond said it had been a really good campaign “given that six months ago we were being written off. Now we will end up as the largest party in local Government and in Dún Laoghaire Rathdown again”. He put their success down to “good candidates, good campaign and strong leadership”. Taoiseach Simon Harris was a “large part of it.

All three are outgoing councillors in the area.\n\nThe tallies have put outgoing councillor and Independent, Mark Casey (9 per cent) in the running for the fourth seat, with newcomers, Fianna Fáil’s Sean Mimnagh (8.4 per cent) and Fine Gael’s Martin Skelly (8.3 per cent) currently in line for the fifth and sixth seats.\n\nOutgoing Fine Gael councillor and Cathaoirleach of Longford County Council, Colm Murray, could be at risk of losing his seat. With a vote of 7.6 per cent putting him ninth in the rankings, he’ll be relying heavily on surplus votes from his colleagues.\n\nIn Granard LEA, Fine Gael came out on top, with outgoing councillor Garry Murtagh topping the polls, not just in his own MD, but across the county. He received 20.4 per cent of the overall vote.\n\nHis party colleague and outgoing councillor Paraic Brady has also done well, shooting into the lead with 17 per cent of the vote and putting him third in the rankings.\n\nOutgoing Cathaoirleach of Granard MD and polltopper of 2019, Turlough McGovern brought in 19.8 per cent of the votes, setting him firmly in place for a seat once again.\n\nYesterday’s tallies have Fine Gael set to take the remaining two seats in north Longford, with Colin Dalton and Padraig McNamara taking 11.6 per cent and 9.8 per cent of the vote respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, in Longford LEA, Fine Gael’s outgoing councillor Gerry Hagan is in flying form at the count this morning as he looks set to top the polls in Longford MD at 15.6 per cent.\n\nBut, with 15.5 per cent of the votes, outgoing Fianna Fáil councillor Martin Monaghan is hot on his heels, and only six votes behind him.\n\nSnapping at the pair’s pair of heels is his party and council colleague, Seamus Butler, with 15.3 per cent of the votes, while Fine Gael’s Peggy Nolan also looks set to secure a seat, with 13.2 per cent.\n\nYesterday’s tallies put Fine Gael’s Niall Gannon (7.4 per cent), and Fianna Fáil’s Kevin Hussey (6.5 per cent) and Uruemu Adejinmi (6.2 per cent) in with a strong chance of winning the remaining three seats in Longford LEA.\n\nBut we’re only on the first count.

The lack of a reliable tallying operation means that beyond a general view that Barry Andrews (FF) and Regina Doherty (FG) will take seats, the final two are too close to call with any degree of confidence.\n\n“Green Party sources say they’re not feeling optimistic about retaining Ciarán Cuffe’s seat in Dublin – or Grace O’Sullivan’s in Ireland South.\n\n“The Social Democrats are pleased with their outing in the Dublin local elections, pointing to a strong performance on the North Side, especially in donaghmede and Howth Malahide, and in the Greater Dublin Area and commuter belt – as well as city councils in Limerick, Cork and Galway.

He was also a first-time candidate.\n\nO’Rourke came to prominence in her opposition to an entrance on to the M4 from Castletown House in Celbridge.\n\nPeter Melrose was elected in the Maynooth LEA. He gained national attention in 2021 when he highlighted that a new housing development, Mullen Park in Maynooth, was sold to a vulture fund. Following a political outcry, the Government introduced a 10 per cent levy on bulk purchases of 10 or more houses over a 12 month period.\n\nFormer Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy said that having six certainties and possibly a seventh is a “very good day for the party”.\n\n“We knew on the doors that there wasn’t any real surge for Sinn Féin. We were quite hopeful that our estimate was going to be correct for us,” she said. “We were concentrating on our own game.”\n\nIt was a good election for the Government parties in the constituency.

When it concluded counters at the Punchestown racecourse pavilion will begin the four remaining electoral areas – Athy, Newbridge, Kildare and Leixlip.\n\nBut why does it all take so long?\n\nYou might find yourself wondering why the counting of votes in Ireland drags on for days and days and days – after all we are a small country and France and Germany will be finished with it all long before we are.\n\nIf you are wondering, you are not alone.\n\nThe question has been asked for decades and for a brief period in the early part of this century it looked like we were going to leave the pencils behind and move into the digital age.\n\nThat never happened.\n\nIn 2014 in the aftermath of that year’s European and Local elections, Mary Minihan wrote a fine piece in which she noted that “long after the rest of Europe had wrapped up, the count in Castlebar to fill the European Parliament seats in the Midlands North West constituency was continuing.”\n\nMeanwhile electing MEPs for the South constituency “involved 12 counts spread over four days in Cork,” she said.\n\nBy the time they counted everybody on each count, the election staff had handled over one million pieces of paper. “It’s hard to see how that could be quick,” said one observer.\n\nAs was the case this time out there were two ballot papers in 2014 – one for the Europeans and one for the local elections. They had to be separated before the counts proper could begin.\n\n“Our quirky system of proportional representation by means of a single transferable vote (PR-STV) in multi-seat constituencies cannot be rushed. Malta is the only other country that uses PR-STV, which is beloved by many but truly understood by few,” Minihan wrote.\n\nAn obvious alternative is electronic voting.\n\nBut we tried that once and it was not a triumph.\n\nA pilot scheme in 2002 saw the results in three constituencies announced quickly on the night of the election.\n\nFormer Fine Gael minister Nora Owen dramatically lost her seat without warning. “I would never want to see it resurrected ... I don’t think the Irish people would ever want to go back to electronic voting,” she said.\n\nThe e-voting machines were never rolled out nationally due to security concerns and the experiment cost the State €54 million.\n\nAnd while the time takes might be wearying betimes, we love it all the same.\n\n“What is lost in speed and efficiency is made up for in transparency and a sense of the importance of the voting process,” according to the editorial in yesterday’s paper. “The long count is both an in-depth civics lesson and a piece of political theatre. It can combine the emotional drama of a knockout sporting fixture with the challenge of a knotty mathematical problem.”\n\nAnd we’re off ... at least in some places\n\nOur man in Cork, Barry Roche has arrived at the Ireland South Centre at Nemo Rangers GAA Club where counting has just started. It will be a long day there – and everywhere, really. The count in Cork involves “5 seats, 23 candidates and an electorate of 1, 345,792. Approximately 713,000 votes cast, weighing almost 6 tonnes – 5,818 kilos to be precise – to be counted by 250 counting staff under returning officer, Cork City Sheriff Martin Harvey.”\n\nMeanwhile in Wexford counting is due to resume shortly and as Sean Murray notes there were “no first count from any of the LEAs last night so we are hoping they come in thick and fast from early today. The vote for Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael was strong across the county here, with Verona Murphy’s nascent Wexford Independent Alliance in the mix for a few seats.”\n\nAnd Martin Wall is in Fingal where counting is about to re-commence with just one of the 40 seats filled. That went to Fine Gael’s Ted Leddy in the Castleknock electoral area who was elected on the first count.\n\nOur Political Editor Pat Leahy had a good wrap of what we learned from the first day of the count that was published late last night in case you missed it. It will bring you up to speed pretty quickly.\n\nDone and dusted in Castlebar after all-night count\n\nThey are a hardy lot in Mayo, that’s for sure. The Castlebar count went through the night and it has only just finished, reports Paul O’Malley.\n\nFianna Fáil’s Blackie Gavin was elected on the 11th Count with fellow party member Al McDonnell joining him on the 13th count. Fine Gael’s Ger Deere and independent Michael Kilcoyne were both elected on the first count, which might seem like a lifetime ago for those at the centre.\n\nIndependent Harry Barrett, Fine Gael’s Donna Sheridan and Cyril Burke were all elected on the 14th and final count meaning there is no room in the chamber for Stephen Kerr who ran on an anti-immigration platform while incumbent Fianna Fáil councillor Martin McLoughlin also missed out.\n\nIndependents and Sinn Féin have a good day out in Leitrim\n\nThe number of independents on who will have a seat on Leitrim’s county council has climbed from four to five while Sinn Féin managed to double their number of seats, admittedly from a low base of two up to four, reports Sorcha Crowley.\n\nFianna Fáil held on to six seats while Fine Gael lost half their seats which will see their presence in the chamber fall from six to just three.\n\nSitting FG councillor Enda McGloin, comfortably re-elected on the first count in Ballinamore LEA on 1,033 votes, described the party’s performance in north Leitrim as “a complete debacle.” It will be the first time in living memory that there hasn’t been a Fine Gael councillor in the Manorhamilton LEA. Carrick-on-Shannon first-time candidate Maeve Reynolds won a second seat for the party while Ita Reynolds-Flynn, former TD Gerry Reynolds sister, took the third and last Fine Gael seat in Ballinamore shortly before 5am Sunday.\n\nFianna Fáil had a good day out in Leitrim with stalwart Paddy O’Rourke topping the poll in Ballinamore on 1,434 votes in the first count. Another long-serving Fianna Fáil councillor Mary Bohan was re-elected to the Manorhamilton Local Electoral Area on 925 votes in the third count. Justin Warnock was elected to that LEA on the sixth count. The party won two more seats in the Carrick-on-Shannon LEA thanks to Sean McGowan (912) and Paddy Farrell, who was elected without reaching the quota of 824. Gary Prior won the last seat for Fianna Fáil in the Ballinamore LEA on the seventh count on 984 votes.\n\nIndependents have emerged as the second largest grouping on Leitrim County Council. Maths and Agricultural Science teacher James Gilmartin was the first of five independents elected, winning his seat in the Manorhamilton LEA thanks to a massive first preference vote of 1,335.\n\nEnda Stenson and Des Guckian won seats in the Carrick-on-Shannon LEA on the fourth count while Felim Gurn won a seat in Manorhamilton also on the fourth count. Eddie Mitchell won the fifth independent seat on the seventh count in Manorhamilton LEA with 866 votes, without reaching the quota.\n\nSinn Féin had to wait until 3.07am to see their first candidate deemed elected in the county, with Brendan Barry finally making it over the line with 1,007 votes on the fifth count of the Ballinamore LEA. He was followed by Padraig Fallon on the sixth count of Manorhamilton LEA (1,145 votes) and Cormac Flynn on the seventh count of Carrick-on-Shannon LEA on 841 votes. Roisín Kenny, sister of Sligo-Leitrim Sinn Féin TD Martin Kenny, took the last council seat in the Ballinamore LEA on count eight at 4.54am.\n\nIt leaves Leitrim County Council finely balanced 50:50 between the two Government parties of Fianna Fáil (6 seats) and Fine Gael (3 seats) versus five independents and four Sinn Féin councillors. Four women were elected, one more than in 2019 and three of them are newcomers. No breakthrough for any parties of the far right or left in Leitrim.\n\nAs it stands, only Leitrim Country Council has elected all its councillors with the final seat being taken by Sinn Féin’s Róisín Kenny in the Ballinamore electoral area at 5am. By contrast, the counting of votes across the Local Electoral Areas of Meath and Donegal are yet to begin.\n\nGood morning. So, here we are again. And where is that? Well, almost 24 hours after counting began, less than a quarter of the council seats have been filled, the count for the European elections has yet to start and we are a still full day away from counting the votes in the Limerick Mayoral election.\n\nNever let it be said the Irish electoral system doesn’t get value for money from the hard working counters in the centres across the country, many of whom were sifting papers and totting up numbers well into the early hours of this morning. I’m Conor Pope and I will be manning this live news story for much of today."
