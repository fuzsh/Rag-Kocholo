(1) Any ballot paper -\n\n(a) which does not bear the official mark,\n\n(b) on which the figure “1” standing alone, or the word “one” or any other mark which, in the opinion of the returning officer, clearly indicates a first preference, is not placed at all or is not so placed as to indicate a first preference for some candidate,\n\n(c) on which the figure “1” standing alone indicating a first preference, or the word “one” or any other mark which, in the opinion of the returning officer, clearly indicates a first preference, is set opposite the name of more than one candidate,\n\n(d) on which anything is written or marked which, in the opinion of the returning officer, is calculated to identify the elector,\n\nshall be invalid and not counted, but the ballot paper shall not be invalid by reason only of carrying the words “one”, “two”, “three” (and so on) or any other mark which, in the opinion of the returning officer, clearly indicates a preference or preferences.\n\n(2) The returning officer may endorse on any ballot paper, which he or she does not reject as invalid, an indication of his or her decision without, however, interfering with any mark placed by the elector on the ballot paper.\n\n(3) (a) The returning officer shall endorse “rejected” on any ballot paper which under this paragraph is not to be counted.\n\n(b) Any ballot paper endorsed “rejected” by the returning officer shall not subsequently form part of any re-examination or recount as provided for in paragraph 9.\n\n(c) The returning officer shall prepare a statement showing the number of ballot papers endorsed “rejected” and shall, on request, allow any candidate or candidate's agent to copy the statement.\n\nFirst count\n\n3. (1) The returning officer shall arrange the valid ballot papers in parcels according to the first preferences recorded for each candidate.\n\n(2) The returning officer shall then count the number of ballot papers in each parcel and credit each candidate with a number of votes equal to the number of valid ballot papers on which a first preference has been recorded for the candidate and the returning officer shall ascertain the number of all valid ballot papers.\n\nThe quota\n\n4. (1) The returning officer shall then divide the number of all valid papers by a number exceeding by one the number of members to be elected; the result increased by one, any fractional remainder being disregarded, shall be the number of votes sufficient to secure the election of a candidate and this number is referred to in this Schedule as the “quota”.\n\n(2) Where at the end of any count the number of votes credited to a candidate is equal to or greater than the quota, that candidate shall be deemed to be elected.\n\nTransfer of surplus\n\n5. (1) Where at the end of any count the number of votes credited to a candidate is greater than the quota, the surplus shall be transferred in accordance with and subject to this paragraph to the continuing candidate or candidates indicated on the ballot papers in the parcel or sub-parcel of the candidate deemed to be elected according to the next available preferences recorded thereon.\n\n(2) Where the votes credited to a candidate deemed to be elected whose surplus is to be transferred consist of original votes only, the returning officer shall examine all the papers in the parcel of that candidate and shall arrange the transferable papers in sub-parcels according to the next available preferences recorded thereon.\n\n(3) Where the votes credited to a candidate deemed to be elected whose surplus is to be transferred consist of original and transferred votes, or of transferred votes only, the returning officer shall examine the papers contained in the sub-parcel last received by that candidate and shall arrange the transferable papers therein in further sub-parcels according to the next available preference recorded thereon.\n\n(4) In either of the cases referred to in subparagraphs (2) and (3) the returning officer shall make a separate sub-parcel of the non-transferable papers and shall ascertain the number of papers in each sub-parcel of transferable papers and in the sub-parcel of non-transferable papers.\n\n(5) Where -\n\n(a) the surplus is equal to the total number of papers in the sub-parcels of transferable papers, the returning officer shall transfer each sub-parcel of transferable papers to the continuing candidate indicated thereon as the voter's next available preference,\n\n(b) the surplus is greater than the total number of papers in the sub-parcels of transferable papers, the returning officer shall proceed as specified in clause (a) and shall in addition make a sub-parcel of a number of non-transferable papers equal to the difference between such total number and the surplus and set the papers therein aside as finally dealt with, such papers being described as non-transferable papers not effective, and the non-transferable papers, as the case may be, also arranged as a sub-parcel shall be placed with the papers of the candidate deemed to be elected.\n\n(6) Where the surplus is less than the total number of transferable papers the following provisions apply:\n\n(a) the returning officer shall transfer from each sub-parcel of transferable papers to the continuing candidate indicated thereon as the voters' next available preference that number of papers which bears the same proportion to the number of papers in the sub-parcel as the surplus bears to the total number of transferable papers;\n\n(b) the number of papers to be transferred from each sub-parcel shall be ascertained by multiplying the number of papers in the sub-parcel by the surplus and dividing the result by the total number of transferable papers;\n\n(c) a note shall be made of the fractions (which may be expressed in decimal form), if any, in each quotient ascertained in respect of each candidate in accordance with clause (b) and if, owing to the existence of such fractions, the number of papers to be transferred is less than the surplus, so many of these fractions taken in the order their magnitude (beginning with largest) as are necessary to make the total number of papers to be transferred equal to the surplus shall be reckoned as of the value of unity and the remaining fractions shall be disregarded;\n\n(d) where 2 or more fractions are of equal magnitude, and it is not possible for the purposes of clause (c) to reckon all of those fractions as of the value of unity, that fraction shall be deemed to be the largest which arises from the largest sub-parcel, and if those sub-parcels are equal in size, that fraction shall be deemed to be the largest which relates to the candidate credited with the largest number of original votes. Where the numbers of those original votes are equal, regard shall be had to the total number of votes credited to those candidates at the first count at which they were credited with an unequal number of votes, and the fraction relating to the candidate credited with the greatest number of votes at that count shall be deemed to be largest. Where the numbers of votes credited to those candidates were equal at all counts the returning officer shall determine by lot which fraction shall be deemed to be the largest.\n\n(7) The papers to be transferred from each sub-parcel shall be those last filed in the sub-parcel, and each paper so transferred shall be marked to indicate the number of the count at which the transfer took place.\n\n(8) The returning officer shall not transfer the surplus of a candidate deemed to be elected whenever that surplus, together with any other surplus not transferred, is less than both the difference between the quota and the number of votes credited to the highest continuing candidate and the difference between the numbers of the votes credited to the 2 lowest continuing candidates and either -\n\n(a) the number of votes credited to the lowest candidate is greater than one quarter of the quota, or\n\n(b) the sum of the number of votes credited to the lowest candidate together with that surplus and any other surplus not transferred is not greater than one quarter of the quota.\n\n(9) Where at any time there are 2 or more surpluses which are to be transferred, the greater or greatest of such surpluses shall first be transferred and the remaining surplus or surpluses shall then, subject to subparagraph (8), be transferred in the order of their descending magnitude.\n\n(10) Where 2 or more candidates have each an equal surplus arising from the same count regard shall be had to the number of original votes credited to each candidate and the surplus of the candidate credited with the largest number of original votes shall be first dealt with. Where the numbers of such original votes are equal regard shall be had to the total number of votes credited to such candidates at the first count at which they had an unequal number of votes and the surplus of the candidate with the greatest number of votes at that count shall be first dealt with. Where the numbers of votes credited to such candidates were equal at all counts the returning officer shall determine by lot which surplus shall be first dealt with.\n\n(11) Subject to subparagraphs (8) and (9), where 2 or more candidates have a surplus arising from different counts, a surplus which arises at the end of any count shall be transferred before a surplus which arises at a subsequent count.\n\nExclusion of candidate\n\n6. (1) If at any time no candidate has a surplus (or when under paragraph 5(8) an existing surplus is not transferred) and one or more vacancies remain unfilled, the returning officer shall -\n\n(a) exclude the candidate or candidates credited with the lowest number of votes,\n\n(b) examine all the ballot papers of that candidate or candidates,\n\n(c) arrange the transferable ballot papers in sub-parcels according to the next available preferences recorded thereon for continuing candidates,\n\n(d) transfer each sub-parcel to the candidate for whom that preference is recorded, and\n\n(e) make a separate sub-parcel of the non-transferable ballot papers.\n\n(2) The non-transferable ballot papers shall be set aside and not further taken into account and shall be labelled as non-transferable ballot papers not effective.\n\n(3) Where the total of the votes of the 2 or more lowest candidates together with any surplus not transferred is less than the number of votes credited to the next highest candidate, the returning officer may in one operation exclude those 2 or next lowest candidates.\n\n(4) If, when a candidate has to be excluded under this paragraph, 2 or more candidates have each the same number of votes and are lowest, regard shall be had to the numbers of original votes credited to each of those candidates, and the candidate with the lowest number of original votes shall be excluded and where the number of the original votes are equal, regard shall be had to the total numbers of votes credited to those candidates at the first count at which they had an unequal number of votes and the candidate with the lowest number of votes at that count shall be excluded and, where the numbers of votes credited to those candidates were equal at all counts, the returning officer shall determine by lot which shall be excluded.\n\nTransfer of votes.\n\n7. (1) Where a transfer of votes is made under paragraph 5, each sub-parcel of papers transferred shall be placed on top of the parcel, if any, of papers of the candidate to whom the transfer is made, and that candidate shall be credited with a number of votes equal to the number of papers transferred to that candidate.\n\n(2) If, after any transfer, a candidate has a surplus, that surplus shall be dealt with in accordance with and subject to paragraph 5 before any other candidate is excluded.\n\nFilling of vacancy without reaching quota\n\n8. (1) Where there is only one continuing candidate after the other candidates have been excluded and that continuing candidate has not reached the quota he or she shall be deemed to be elected.\n\n(2) Where the number of continuing candidates is equal to the number of vacancies remaining unfilled, the continuing candidates shall thereupon be deemed to be elected.\n\nRecount\n\n9. (1) Any candidate or candidate's agent present at the counting of votes may, at the conclusion of any count, request the returning officer to re-examine and recount all or any of the papers dealt with during that count and the returning officer shall, as soon as practicable, re-examine and recount the papers accordingly, without making any alterations in the arrangement of the papers in the various parcels, save where such alterations may be necessary in consequence of any error discovered in the recount.\n\n(2) The returning officer may also at his or her discretion recount papers either once or more often in any case in which he or she is not satisfied as to the accuracy of any count but nothing in this paragraph shall make it obligatory for the returning officer to recount the same parcel of papers more than once.\n\n(3) The power of the returning officer under subparagraphs (1) and (2) to recount at his or her discretion papers in any case in which he or she is not satisfied as to the accuracy of any count shall extend to papers dealt with at an earlier count than the immediately preceding one.\n\n(4) (a) One request (and not more) may be made by each candidate or by his or her agent for a complete re-examination and recount of all parcels of ballot papers and the returning officer shall as soon as practicable re-examine and recount the parcels of ballot papers accordingly.\n\n(b) In the re-examination and recount, the number or order of ballot papers in any parcel shall not be disturbed.\n\n(c) Nothing in this paragraph shall make it obligatory on the returning officer to re-examine or recount the same parcel of papers more than once, but if an error is discovered which is, in the opinion of the returning officer, a significant error likely to affect the result of the election, the returning officer shall count all the papers afresh from the point at which the error occurred.\n\n(d) Nothing in this paragraph shall make it obligatory for the returning officer to comply with a request by a candidate or his or her agent which, in the opinion of the returning officer, is frivolous or vexatious.\n\n(e) A request under this subparagraph may be made only at the conclusion of a count.\n\n(5) Where an error is discovered, the returning officer shall, where necessary, amend any results previously announced by him or her.\n\n(6) Where a request made under subparagraph (4)(a) is withdrawn by the candidate concerned, it shall be open to the returning officer not to proceed or to proceed further with the re-examination and recount.\n\nDeclaration of the result of the poll\n\n10. On the completion of the counting of votes the returning officer shall determine and declare the results of the poll and the candidates deemed to be elected shall stand elected.\n\nDecisions of returning officer\n\n11. The decision of the returning officer, whether expressed or implied by his or her acts, on any question which arises at a count in relation to the exclusion of any candidate under paragraph 6 or to any ballot paper or transfer of votes is final."
