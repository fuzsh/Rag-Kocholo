        "text": "i suppose you can't really compare a party percentage vote in local election to that of a general election, but here's a rough figure for the FF, FG vote this time:\n\nFF 33%, FG 28%\n\nThat's a big drop from 46.8 for FF. FG too lost votes, going down from 31.5. (Cá bhfuil na vótaí ag dul?)!!\n\nIn a four seater, 20% gets you a seat, so FF and FG get one each, easily, and FF look good for two. They wouldn't be home and dry though.\n\nThe one thing people should realise is that there's no such thing as a safe seat and no such thing as a dead cert in politics. When paddy mchugh ran in 2002 nobody gave him a chance of winning a seat. He took the 3rd seat. In the last local elections the experts predicted that neither of McHugh's candidates for his Town Council and County Council seat would be elected because of a perception that he had lost support around Tuam. Both candidates were elected and suddenly people were talking about the \"mchugh dynasty\". Now people are saying he could lose his dail seat cos he hasn't delivered for tuam. I'm from tuam and although don't know the man personally I don't see how any of our other td's (connaughton in particular given that he could also be considered a north galway td) have \"delivered\" in ways that McHugh hasn't. His role, as a member of the opposition, is to fight for better services, etc for Tuam which he is doing. Michael Kitt hasn't been heard of around here since he lost his Dail seat. I don't see how he could win it back. Colm Keaveney will definitely run. It remains to be seen how he'll perform as a County Counciillor for the next couple of years. Joe Callanan is being roasted over the dump in Kilconnell and Ulick Burke is maintaining his profile. But the election is possibly 2 years away so who knows what could happen.\n\nRE Steely's reply to my comment on there being a lot of corruption, I don't think i was being unfair to assume there are plenty of others. There clearly are plenty and every few months we hear of more. I don't feel bad for being cynical. I don't think my comments were levelled against any particular party or in any given area.\n\nI do accept, however, that there is much apathy towards politics/polititians. I also see it as the role of those interested in politics to try any encourage others to resume their interest and also to bring young people into the arena of politics. Yes, positive contributions are vital, but it is also vital to face up to the fact that there are and have been many corrupt polititians (and plenty more have turned a blind eye to same). Until big numbers of people currently trying to encourage an interest in politics start accepting this, apathy will remain.\n\nReply to diggins.\n\nInteresting comments. I can't claim to have much knowledge of where things are at and certainly don't know a lot about the visibility of TDs and future candidates around Tuaim.\n\nI agree with your point about McHugh and the 'dynasty'. He can't be written off. How far he'll get next time will depend on how well Keaveney does maybe, as well as Connaghton and indeed Kitt (asuming he'll stand as he got to Seanad?) I imagine McHugh is trying to eat into the areas the conservative parties have long claimed as their own.\n\nIs Keaveney working for the Tuaim area primarily or is he aiming to politicise voters towards Labour politics?\n\nWithout out wishing to be offensive, I don't find any of the current TDs in the area to be extra-able, or as you said, 'a safe seat'. Each should be vulnerable, but to date, it only looks like they'll be vulnerable to the former TDs, such as Ulick Burke and Micheál Kitt. So far, I don't imagine the politics of Galway East has changed from being about constituency work to being ideology-based, and in particular towards electing an alternative type of person.\n\nBut I live in hope!\n\nWithout out wishing to be offensive, I don't find any of the current TDs in the area to be extra-able, or as you said, 'a safe seat'.

The average thirty or forty something voter in East Galway is more likely to be an REM fan rather than a Big Tom fan.\n\nThe two main partys are going to see some pressure in 2007. Yes Keaveney and McHugh will run and probably wipe each other out and do some damage to Connaughton and Kitt.\n\nThe PD's are looking at Ciaran Cannon in Loughrea/Athenry and so far he is making an impression. Without taking a seat he may do some serious damage to Noel Treacy, Joe Callanan and Ulick Burke.\n\nInteresting times ahead!!\n\nIt does seem that very few people have an interest is GE alright. I'm not sure it'll be a key battleground or that many will see it as being very interesting. Every seat counts though and there may well be changes which could effect the overall make-up of the next Dail.\n\nIf there are changes in terms of party's seats, I think it'll come as a shock to the media. I can't see how they'd buy into the idea that SF, Labour or indeed the PDs could take a seat. Shouldn't be ruled out though.\n\nSomeone mentioned there that Ulick Burke is 'in full flight'. I think the FG battle will be interesting. I assume it's a given that UB will stand. Is Paul Connaghton standing again or will it be his daughter? Which one is to stand will be determined by the strength of UB.\n\nOh yeah, go easy on poor old Big Tom!\n\ncandid, how about Connaughton (which ever of them runs) Kitt to take out McHugh, Ulick Burke to retake ( apparently he is already in full flight) and either Callanan or Treacy - my guess Callanan. Dont see the relatively good PD local result amounting to much in a GE\n\nMcHugh will be under serious pressure in Tuam with Kitt and Labour's Keaveney snapping at his heels.\n\nCallanan has lost massive support in his own locality with the arrival of two landfill sites, one private and one public.\n\nUlick might be in full flight but maybe a touch of Icarus about it.\n\nTreacy perceived as being a bit removed from the grass roots at the moment.\n\nOne of the Connaughtons guaranteed a seat.\n\nPrediction?\n\n2 FF\n\n1 FG\n\n1 left between FF, FG, PD's, Lab\n\nas a strong callanan supporter it pains me to admit but Joe is is in big trouble next time round. After the mess we made of the local elections this summer he is on in own in terms or party support, we have no sitting fianna fail councillor round these parts now!! Its a complete disgrace!! Although Treacy is the most annoying and irratating man to ever grace the Dail, he does get work done and the people think that because he is a junior minister he is a great benefit to the area! It'l be a terrible shame if Joe losses out put i can't see him pulling it off!!\n\nas a strong callanan supporter it pains me to admit but Joe is is in big trouble next time round.

People expected him to wave a magic wand and make two landfill sites disappear. His replacement on the council, Gormally, was a bit weak and maybe the seat could have been retained with a better candidate. If Joe goes how do you call it?\n\nTreacy, Connaughton, and after that its anyones game!\n\nas a strong callanan supporter it pains me to admit but Joe is is in big trouble next time round.

If Joe goes how do you call it?\n\nTreacy, Connaughton, and after that its anyones game!\n\nSorry, but i have to disagree with your comment on Gormally's ability, he was a hard worker and in the few months he was in he did as much as he could for the area. His failure in the election was as a result of personal vendetts against him, jealousy and greed had reared its ugly head in these parts and ther was a brutal campaign against Gormally!! Granted, the landfills had a hugh part to play aswell put with a group of idiotic vigilantes against him he really didn't have a fair chance!\n\nAlso there were too many canditates in the area, Ruane Divilly should not have been allowed run, 5 Fianna Fail candidates was ridiculous!! Personally i blame Treacy for this, he was instrumental in her decision to run. I really dont like that man!\n\nI don't know an awful lot about the internal politics of FF in the area, but Callanan was the surprise poll-topper in 2002. He topped the poll because he gets things done. I'm not sure that he could have been regarded by many as the 'fighter who'd look after us'. Nor could he ever have been regarded as being deeply anti-dump (I think). Gormally too was weak on this, and people probably saw that it was FF-type politics bringing dumps to the area.\n\nI would think Callanan would be in with a better-than-average chance of re-election. Remember, thbe votes of all the big name were down the last time.\n\nI imagine Treacy is a real shrewd operator, and fairly self-interested. I can't just see him being a FF-man as much as a Treacy-man. No doubt he has his ear real close to the ground.\n\nIs it to be assumed that FF will run three candidates and that Treacy, Kitt and Callanan are the likely ones?\n\n[quote 0mlzjq4]Personally i blame Treacy for this, he was instrumental in her decision to run. I really dont like that man!\n\nYes I can see that he has got no chance of securing your No. 1!\n\nWill Joe Callanan run or does he feel really deflated, I still think he would be in with a chance. [/quote 0mlzjq4]\n\nYeah, he will more than likely run again, he has worked to hard to get to this point to just give it up. Popular feeling around here is that he is in trouble but the local elections may have woken up the electorate and make them realise no one is certain of a seat, and that their vote is of the utmost importance. The shock of Fianna Fail losing 2 of their 3 seats in the Baliansloe area and the overall majority in the Co. Council might just have been the wake up call people round here need! Here's hoping now that they will turn out & support Callanan.\n\nIf we think things are bad now what are are chances with no national repersentive!"
