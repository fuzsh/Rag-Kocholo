These Regulations may be cited as the European Parliament Elections (Forms) Regulations 2004.\n\n2. The European Parliament Elections (Forms) Regulations 1998 ( S.I. No. 415 of 1998 ) are hereby revoked.\n\n3. In these Regulations a reference to the Second Schedule is a reference to the Second Schedule to the European Parliament Elections Act 1997 .\n\n4. The prescribed photographic identification for the purposes of section 12(1B)(d) of the said Act shall be a passport, driving licence, employee identity card containing a photograph, student identity card issued by an educational institution and containing a photograph; bank card with a photograph, travel document containing name and photograph; Temporary Residence Certificate card; Garda National Immigration Bureau card.\n\n5. Each of the forms in Schedule 1 hereto shall in relation to elections to the European Parliament be the prescribed form for the purpose for which such form is expressed to be applicable.\n\n6. The prescribed local authority offices for the purposes of section 12(1B)(a) for a European Parliament Constituency listed in column 1 of Schedule 2 shall be the offices listed in column 2 of Schedule 2.\n\n(b) A non-party candidate may enter the words “Non-Party” in the part of section 2 of this form relating to a registered political party or may leave the space blank. A non-party candidate who is a sitting MEP may include on the nomination paper the name of the European Parliament political group of which he/she is a member, provided a completed Certificate of European Political Affiliation is produced to the returning officer with the nomination paper. This is a certificate signed by a member of the Secretariat of the relevant political group that the candidate is a member of the political group named in the certificate and formed in accordance with the rules and procedure of the European Parliament.\n\nThe returning officer is also required to object to a candidate’s description if it is, in his/her opinion, incorrect, insufficient to identify the candidate or unnecessarily long or contains a political reference other than one covered by section 3 of these notes or a reference to a public or elected office held, or formerly held, by the candidate. The ruling on the nomination paper may be attended by the candidate and proposer (if any), one other person designated by the candidate (or his/her proposer) and any other person authorised by the returning officer."
