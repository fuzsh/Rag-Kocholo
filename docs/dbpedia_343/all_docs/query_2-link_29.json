        "text": "Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) are areas where rents are highest and rising quickly. An area must meet certain criteria to become an RPZ. In these areas, annual rent increases are capped.\n\nRPZs were introduced on 24 December 2016. They were to remain in place until 31 December 2024. But, on 14 May 2024, the Government agreed to extend them until 31 December 2025.\n\nSee below for the list of areas that are Rent Pressure Zones.\n\nHow are rent increases in RPZs calculated?\n\nThe system for calculating allowable rent increases in RPZs has changed a number of times.\n\nSince, 11 December 2021, annual rent increases in RPZs are capped in line with the rate of general inflation or 2% a year, whichever is lower. So, if your landlord reviews the rent every 12 months and the rate of general inflation is 1.5%, then your rent can only be increased by a maximum of 1.5%. However, if the rate of general inflation is higher than 2%, for example, 3%, the rent can only be increased by a maximum of 2%.\n\nIf your landlord has not reviewed the rent for a number of years, the 2% cap applies every year. So, for example, if you moved into rented accommodation in December 2016 and the rent hasn’t changed since then, the general inflation rate would apply when calculating the rent increase. This is because the inflation rate between December 2016 and December 2021 was 6.6%, which is lower than the 10% that would apply under the 2% per year condition (2% per year for 5 years = 10%). The RTB’s Rent Pressure Zone calculator applies both of these conditions and calculates the allowable rent increase for you.\n\nFrom 16 July 2021 to 10 December 2021, annual rent increases in RPZs were only capped at the rate of general inflation, as set out in the Harmonised Indices of Consumer Prices (HICP). But, due to rising inflation these rules were changed to include the new 2% per year condition. This was introduced under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2021. The RTB has published a guidance document (pdf) highlighting the changes this legislation brought in and what they mean for landlords and tenants.\n\nBetween 24 December 2016 and 15 July 2021 rent increases in RPZs were capped at 4% per year.\n\nThe RTB has general information about RPZs, as well as detail on the Harmonised Indices of Consumer Prices (HICP), and how it relates to RPZs.\n\nA tenant or a landlord can request a rent review. A rent review can result in an increase or reduction in the rent. Rent Pressure Zones and areas outside Rent Pressure Zones have different rules for rent reviews.\n\nRent reviews in Rent Pressure Zones\n\nRent increases in Rent Pressure Zones are capped and there are limits on how often the rent can be reviewed. There are different rules about the limits and frequency of rent reviews depending on if the tenancy in the Rent Pressure Zone is an existing or new tenancy.\n\nRent reviews for a new tenancy in an RPZ\n\nFor a new tenancy in a Rent Pressure Zone, the landlord can review the rent once every 12 months. The landlord must give the tenant the following information, in writing, at the start of the tenancy:\n\nThe amount of rent that was last set for the property\n\nThe date the rent was last set for the property\n\nA statement as to how the rent set for the property has been calculated, having regard to the Rent Pressure Zone calculator\n\nThe rent being set should not be more than local market rents for similar properties\n\nRent reviews for an existing tenancy in an RPZ\n\nIf a tenancy is already in existence when an area becomes a Rent Pressure Zone, the first rent review can take place 24 months after either of the following:\n\nThe start of the tenancy\n\nThe date you were notified in writing of your last review\n\nSubsequent rent reviews can take place after 12 months and must adhere to the RPZ rules.\n\nExceptions to rent limits in an RPZ\n\nThere are 3 exceptions to the rent limits applied in Rent Pressure Zones:\n\nProperties that have not been let at any time in the previous 2 years\n\nProperties in protected structures or proposed protected structures that have not been let in the previous year\n\nProperties that have been substantially changed. (A ‘substantial change’ in this situation is defined in the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019. The RTB website has details of the types of substantial change required).\n\nEven if a property qualifies for one of these exemptions, the new rent set must still be in line with market rent for similar properties in the area.\n\nIf a landlord wants to get an exemption from rent limits in an RPZ area, they must notify the RTB within 1 month of setting the rent by completing the RTB’s RPZ Exemption Form (pdf).\n\nThe RTB can investigate and sanction landlords who do not comply with RPZ rules. There are penalties for landlords who do not follow rent increase limits in RPZs, provide false information about an exemption in an RPZ area or do not notify the RTB about availing of an exemption.\n\nRent reviews outside of Rent Pressure Zones\n\nYour rent cannot be reviewed until 24 months after the start of your tenancy. If your rent was reviewed at any time in the last 24 months, it cannot be reviewed again until 24 months after the date of the last review. This rent certainty measure is in place until 31 December 2024.\n\nWhen the 24-month period is over your landlord must give you at least 90 days’ notice of a change in rent. This written notice must state the amount of the new rent and date the new rent will take effect.\n\nYour landlord cannot charge more than 'market rent' which is the going rate for your type of accommodation in the area you live.\n\nCalculating allowable rent increases\n\nYou can use the RTB’s calculator to check if your property is in a Rent Pressure Zone and to work out if the rent can be raised and, if so, by how much. You will need to enter your address or Eircode, the current rent and the date when the rent was last set.\n\nNotice of rent review\n\nOnce the required period (12 or 24 months) has elapsed, your landlord can issue a notice of rent review.\n\nThe landlord must give you proper notice of the amount of the proposed new rent and the date from which it is to take effect. Landlords must use the RTB’s Notice of Rent Review Form (pdf) when issuing a rent review. Landlords should fill out the sections of the form that are relevant to them and should not delete or change any of the form. Other forms, emails, text messages and spoken messages are not valid forms of notice.\n\nYou must get at least 90 days’ notice of a rent review. This means that the new rent cannot apply until 90 days after the notice has been issued.\n\nThe landlord must also notify the RTB of the revised rent so that it can update the registration details of the tenancy. The landlord can do this online using the RTB’s online account system, or by completing the RTB’s Tenancy Update Form (pdf) and returning it to the RTB. The form can be emailed to registrations@rtb.ie, or posted to the RTB. There is no fee for updating this information with the RTB. The RTB’s website has more information about updating your tenancy details.\n\nTenants requesting a rent review\n\nAs a tenant, you can ask your landlord to review the rent if:\n\nYou think it is more than the current market rate for the property or\n\nYou want a new review and more than 24 months have passedhttps://www.rtb.ie/registration-and-compliance/setting-and-reviewing-rent/rent-pressure-zones-setting-rent-and-rent-reviews#Exemptions%20to%20the%20Rent%20Pressure%20Zone%20rental%20cap"
