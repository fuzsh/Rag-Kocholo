        "text": "Highlights 2019/20\n\n· We succeeded in securing funding for the exam buses out to our satellite exam venues in Salthill. Students will no longer have to pay for transport to these facilities.\n\n· We brought forward a proposal and secured €57,000 for the Library Laptop Loan Scheme initiative. Students who don’t have their own personal laptops or can’t avail of a computer on campus will be able to borrow one of the laptops for a few hours a day from the library.\n\n· We distributed 3,000 Keep Cups across campus and had over 3,000 students sign our Sustainability Pledge committing to being more sustainable and environmentally friendly in their everyday lives.\n\n· We helped NUI Galway receive the University of Sanctuary designation through our involvement and contribution on the steering committee since it was initiated in 2017. The University of Sanctuary campaign aims to make NUI Galway more inclusive and welcoming to asylum seekers, refugees and members of the Irish Traveling Community through events, collaboration, courses and scholarships offered. This year NUI Galway offered 6 undergraduate and 3 postgraduate scholarships through the initiative which will be built upon year on year.\n\n· We engaged with both local and national media on many student issues including the cost of student accommodation, the barriers that exist when accessing higher education, the importance of voting in the general election, tips on exam stress and much more to ensure the student voice was always represented and on the agenda.\n\n· We collaborated with the One Galway movement to host a General Elections Hustings on campus to ensure students and the wider community were informed on the different candidates and their policies in advance of casting their votes.\n\n· We coordinated the Freeze the Four campaign to reverse the decision taken to increase the on-campus student accommodation rents by 4% . This included a letter writing campaign, media attention, rallies, protests, attending meetings and camping out and occupying the Quad.\n\n· We helped organise and participated in the second Christmas Tree Lighting celebrating staff and students coming together as part of the NUI Galway community.\n\n· We raised €10,000 for our two chosen charities this year: Sexual Health West and Domestic Violence Response.\n\n· We presented to the University Management Team on student issues.\n\n· We held our first AGM in 10 years at the first Student Council of the year to be more accountable and transparent with the Union’s finances.\n\n· We increased voter turnout out by 4.5% in the Students’ Union Elections Full Time Officer Elections from 2019.\n\n· We ran campaigns on mental health, sexual health awareness and guidance, voter registration, breaking the barriers in accessing education, climate change and sustainability, exam destress and empowering women to participate in sports.\n\n· We increased student engagement on various issues on campus through regular working group meetings on sustainability, the student levy, the constitution and living wage.\n\n· We were actively involved in the crafting of the University’s new Strategic Plan for 2020-2025 ‘Shared Vision Shaped by Values’ where two of the core values ‘Openness’ and ‘Sustainability’ were mainly driven forward by students. Students had their say and were listened to. The University will be accountable in ensuring their flagship goals are achieved in making NUI Galway a more sustainable and inclusive campus.\n\n· We collaborated with the national union, the Union of Students in Ireland (USI) throughout the year at national councils, national campaigns and addressing student issues. We sent students to their main events such as Pink Training, Women Lead, the Power of Disability – A National Forum and the Mature Students’ Seminar.\n\n· CÉIM, our peer assisted learning programme, saw another great year of success. The programme was commended in the CINNTE Institutional Review Report and it was recommended the programme be mainstreamed. The number of students offered CÉIM increased by over 35% this year.\n\n· The Students’ Union was involved in a University investment of nearly €200,000 into scoping out more inclusive learning practices. We campaigned to highlight the barriers that students face in their learning environment. This allowed the Students’ Union to plan and facilitate workshops training staff in inclusive practices for teaching, plan an international conference on Universal Design for Learning and launch a new Blackboard app called Ally that enables students to download their learning material in more accessible formats.\n\n· The SU International Officers and Vice President/Education Officer were involved in the ENLIGHT project which is a culmination of teamwork and effort from 9 universities around Europe, working together to create a connected community and support accessible and mobile learning. If funding is granted students will have the opportunity to move between each of these universities, either physically or through online learning, and have a cohesive degree from across the EU. If successful, the opening event of this project will be hosted here in NUI Galway.\n\n· The Union took a more proactive approach to Postgraduate Students, electing over 100 Postgraduate class reps and creating a better environment of engagement between Postgrad students and the Union. A position paper was drawn up of key areas to advocate for Postgrad students on including working and pay conditions, access to resources, stipends, mental, physical and financial support for PhD students and support for Postgraduate Taught students.\n\n· For the third year running, NUI Galway was selected by USI to host Pink Training, Europe’s largest LGBT+ workshop weekend. We had over 300 delegates participant in workshops over 3 days looking at how to make your SU more LGBT+ friendly, how to be a good ally or to explore a part of your identity in a safe environment. We were delighted to be part of such an amazing event highlighting the importance of the LGBT+ community.\n\n· We worked to establish greater links with Shannon College of Hotel Management, speaking at their 1st year orientation, electing several class reps and visiting them several times a semester.\n\n· A working group was set up to look at the core document that governs what we do – our SU Constitution. This working group posed a referendum that challenged what people thought made an effective Students’ Union Executive. While this referendum failed, it posed several important questions about the Students’ Union going forward.\n\n· A protest was held in the lead up to the General Election as the University had handed over the Áras na Mac Léinn building to RTÉ for a leaders debate event. This effectively locked students and staff out of the building and also caused disruptions for many societies. The protest of 70 students was led by the SU Societies Chairperson and the protesters took over space in the Quad to highlight the issue to the University Management Team and voice their frustration at the lack of consultation with staff and students regarding the closure of Áras na Mac Léinn.\n\n· NUI Galway SU was shortlisted for eight categories in the Student Achievement Awards Ireland including: Part Time Officer of the Year – Pádraic Toomey, Full Time Officer of the Year – Clare Austick, International Student of the Year – Mansi Kesarwani, Equality Campaign of the Year – University of Sanctuary, Outstanding Mental Health Activism – Emma Jane Kinsella, Student Representative of the Year – Reíltin Tynan, Postgraduate Champion of the Year – Cameron Keighron, Access Champion of the Year – SU"
