        "text": "2023 Irish Dignitary\n\nPaul Daly, Senator at Houses of the Oireachtas\n\n2020 Irish Dignitary\n\nJoan Freeman, Senator\n\nSenator Joan Freeman was born in Clontarf, Dublin and holds a BSc in psychology and an MSc in psychology.\n\nPieta House\n\nAfter a personal tragedy, she noticed there was a huge lack of suicide prevention services in Ireland and went about establishing the country’s only organisation providing a free, professional, face to face, therapeutic service for people in the acute stages of distress. In 2006, she set up Pieta House, the Centre for the Prevention of Self-harm or Suicide. Pieta House has since established twelve additional centres across Ireland with almost 270 therapists and administration staff, providing free therapeutic services to over 30,000 people\n\nThe stigma of mental ill-health is gradually being lifted, and there is no doubt that Senator Freeman’s work with Pieta House has contributed greatly to that. Senator Freeman regularly speaks to groups and organisations around the country, promoting tolerance and educating people around suicide and self-harm.\n\nDarkness into Light\n\nSenator Freeman created and held the very first 5km walk which began at 4am in the dark and ended as the dawn broke in 2009, in the Phoenix Park in Dublin. Along with 400 people, she set-off on the inaugural Darkness into Light to raise funds for Pieta House. From small beginnings, the movement has grown year on year and in 2018 over 200,000 people took part in 150 locations, in 16 countries across 5 continents. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ewsgdN2sk)\n\nSolace House\n\nHaving brought the services of Pieta House to great heights, and having helped thousands of people in suicidal distress, in 2015 Senator Freeman readjusted her focus and brought the wonderful work of Pieta House to the US, opening up Solace House. The centre was formally opened in early November 2017 by Minister for Children Katherine Zappone and Consul General of Ireland in New York Ciarán Madden.\n\nSenatorial Position\n\nIn recognition of her outstanding work, Senator Freeman was appointed to Seanad Éireann in 2016 by the then Taoiseach Enda Kenny. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgazdo787rY)\n\nShe immediately knew that her focus would be in mental health and the associated challenges we face in Ireland. By staying centred and committed to this difficult topic, especially around services for children’s mental health, Senator Freeman realised her passion was to act as a voice for the most vulnerable children in our society. Her numerous achievements in her first 18 months as Senator include holding a public consultation on mental health, inviting the parents of children using mental health services, and those who provided these services, to have their say. And one of her most recent achievements include an amendment to legislation that will make it illegal to place children in adult psychiatric wards.\n\nShe was instrumental in the formation of the first ever Irish Committee on the Future of Mental Healthcare and is Chair of the Committee as well as convening and chairing the Government’s first Public Consultation Committee on Children's Mental Healthcare in Ireland in June 2017. Senator Freeman introduced the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2016 which as of July 2018 has cleared all legislative stages in the Seanad.\n\nPresidential Campaign\n\nIn September 2018, Senator Freeman received the nomination of four councils required to be a candidate in the 2018 Irish presidential election.\n\nSenator Freeman has changed the lives of thousands and thousands of families through her compassion for people and in her belief that everyone deserves to have the proper services needed.\n\nSenator Freeman sees and fully understands the challenges that affect people’s physical and mental wellbeing which is central to our lives and is being increasingly challenged by the pressures of modern living. She is driven to continue to fight to put in place, services that help all of these individuals and communities to erode the inequality in society, to continue to take the stigma out of mental health and to focus attention back onto people and in particular, the social issues that affect families across the country.\n\nSenator Freeman is the sixth of the eight children of Marie and John Lowe, she lived in Warwickshire, England, where her parents moved when she was a baby. Her family returned to Dublin when she was 12. She is married to Patrick Freeman and they have four children.\n\nSenator Freeman is a member of the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.\n\nA former member of the Council for Justice and Peace of the Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference.\n\nHonorary Doctorate\n\nSenator Joan Freeman received in December 2019 and Honorary Doctorate (LLS) for her work in creating Pieta House and for being a national and international activist for Mental Health.\n\nBills\n\nMental Health Bill 2016\n\nChildren’s Digital Protection Bill 2019\n\nPublications\n\nSenator Freeman is the author of ‘Cover Up’ (understanding self-harm)\n\nAwards\n\n2011 RTE People of the Year Award\n\n2016 ‘Trailblazer Award’ (2016)\n\n2016 Tatler ‘Woman of the Year’ (2016\n\n2016 ‘SHEMAZING Special Recognition Award’\n\n2018 Trailblazer Award from the Women's Executive Network, Ireland.\n\n2018 Most Powerful Women awards\n\nJoan regularly speaks at conferences and events in Ireland and abroad. In addition to being invited as a key note speaker, guest speaker, panellist and contributor to national and international discussions around suicide, self-harm, mental health, health policy, public health, social entrepreneurship, and charity start-ups, to name a few.\n\n2019 Irish Dignitary\n\nMary Butler, TD\n\nHaving been a community activist all my life and a lifelong member of Fianna Fáill in 2014 I successfully contested the Local elections in the Comeragh area and won a seat. I served as a Councillor for 2 years and enjoyed my role as a public representative immensely.\n\nIn 2016 after securing the nomination from the Fianna Fáil party in Waterford I contested the general election, I was delighted and humbled to receive 10,603 votes, topping the poll and being elected on the first count. I also had the honour of being the first female Fianna Fáil TD to be elected for the party since 2007.\n\nI have a strong grounding in the retail sector having worked as both an employee and an employer. I successfully ran the family business a grocery shop in Portlaw for 17 years and continued my career working in John Martin Jewellers in Waterford City for 10 years.\n\nI was honoured to be asked to Chair the Oireachtas Committee on Business Enterprise and Innovation which scrutinizes many pieces of very important legislation and has produced many reports in relation to the cost of doing business, Brexit and apprenticeships among others. I feel that my practical experience in retail gives me strong grounding for this role.\n\nI am Fianna Fail Spokesperson for Older People and Health Promotion, an area I am passionate about. I work closely with the Alzheimers Society, Age Action, Nursing Homes Ireland and the Carers Association as well as many others. I also Chair the All Party Oireachtas Group on Dementia raising awareness for people with memory difficulties as they grow older. I have produced several pieces of legislation in relation to Fair Deal and Mandatory Sentencing for Crimes against Older People which are currently progressing through the Oireachtas.\n\nI am married to Mick and have three children and I am lucky to have a great family support network. Having constituency offices in Waterford City and Dungarvan, I believe in representing all of my constituents in Waterford City and County to the best of my ability.\n\n2018 Irish Dignitary\n\nGerry Horkan\n\nMy name is Senator Gerry Horkan and I am a Fianna Fail Senator based in South Dublin in Ireland.Â I am a Chartered Accountant, with a Masters in Accounting and a Bachelor of Commerce from University College Dublin.\n\nBefore entering national politics, I served as County Councillor for the Stillorgan electoral area of DÃºn Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in Dublin from 2003 until elected to the Senate in April 2016. My role involved being responsible forÂ policy-making in the local community, with the implementation of decisions resting with the county manager and their team. During this time I was also elected as Chairperson of two Strategic Policy Committees within the council. I was also elected Chairperson of the Dublin Regional Authority in 2006 and later in 2014 as Chairperson of the Southern & Eastern Regional Assembly which represents over half of the population of the country and subsequently I was also elected the very first Chairperson of the new Eastern & Midland Regional Assembly in 2015.Â I served as a councillor representative on my partyâ€™s National Executive and now serve there as a representative of the parliamentary party.Â I was also the chairperson of the Fianna Fail National Councillors forum which represents my party councillors all over the state.\n\nThough sometimes challenging, my long time in the council equipped me with the knowledge and skills to take on my next challenge and run for Seanad Ã‰ireann.\n\nI was successful in my first attempt and was elected to Seanad Ã‰ireann on the Industrial and Commercial Panel in April 2016. I was then appointed as the Fianna FÃ¡il Seanad Spokesperson on Finance and Deputy Whip of our Senate Group by party leader Micheal Martin TD and elected as the Vice Chairperson of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, positions I am privileged to hold.\n\nThese positions allow me to give a voice to people locally and nationally on important and often emotive issues. Senators are elected on a national basis so it is important to keep in touch with what is happening all over the country.Â Public service is a great privilege and every day I work to honour the trust people have placed in me. It helps that I love the work, the responsibility, and the challenge.\n\nI am also the chair of a secondary school board of management in a south Dublin school with approximately 500 pupils.\n\nFor me, individuals, families and communities are the bedrock of society, and what attracted me to politics in the first place was being able to get involved and improve the quality of life for all citizens. I felt I could make a difference with regard to the challenges facing people, and that I could help to shape and implement adequate solutions to those challenges. In my time in public life I am glad that I have been able to achieve many things both locally and nationally and I look forward to my upcoming visit to Emmetsburg.\n\n2017 Irish Dignitary\n\nAnne Rabbitte, TD\n\nAnne is an Irish Fianna Fáil politician and a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Galway East constituency, upon being elected at the 2016 general election. She had been a member of Galway County Council from 2009 to 2016.\n\nIn May 2016 she was appointed by the Leader of the Opposition Micheál Martin to the Shadow Cabinet as Opposition Spokesperson for Children and Youth Affairs.\n\nFrom Anne:\n\nI am a mother, a homemaker, a widow. I am an employee, a local representative, a voice for the people.\n\nI have worked for a well established financial institution for 15 years and became a full qualified financial adviser in 2002\n\nI have focused myself on five main areas about which I am truly passionate and wish to affect change in my constituency.\n\n•Rural Ireland (community development)\n\n•Tourism (economic growth)\n\n•Health and Fitness\n\n•Early intervention in Childcare\n\n•Care of the Elderly (Fair Deal/Nursing Home Support Scheme)\n\nThe committees I sit on and am involved in link directly and indirectly into these, my core issues. I am the Chairperson of the Finance Committee and board member of GRETB. I am a member of the Athenry Heritage committee. I am a member of the Strategic Policy Committee for Environment, Water services and Fire/Emergency services. I am a member of the Loughrea Municipal District. And at a more local level, I sit on the Portumna Camogie Club, Portumna Scouts, N.S Parents Association and Portumna Tidy Towns Task Force Committees. I also held a place on the recently formed Portumna FitTowns committee which launched a highly successful new initiative in Portumna in January 2015, to encourage the whole community, young and old, to get out and get active. Being involved in these groups helps me to keep my finger on the pulse, something which I find invaluable in doing my job as councillor to the highest standard.\n\n2016 Irish Dignitary\n\nJohn Deasy\n\nJohn Deasy (born 8 October 1967) has been a TD (Teachta Dála) for the Waterford constituency since 2002 and is a member of the Fine Gael party. He was named 2013 backbencher of the year by the Irish Times newspaper and is widely regarded as one of the most independent-minded members of the Irish parliament.\n\nJohn grew up in the seaside village of Stradbally, County Waterford until his family moved to the nearby county town of Dungarvan. He was educated at the local national school, St Augustine’s College, Abbeyside, and also Coláiste na Rinne, Ring, Dungarvan.\n\nAged 18, he received a scholarship to study at Mercyhurst College, Erie, Pennsylvania, USA. Deasy graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in History/Communications, and in 1990 took up the post of Legislative Assistant in the United States Senate. He worked extensively with the Senate Finance Committee, handling trade and foreign affairs for Pennsylvania Republican Senator John Heinz (heir to and major shareholder in H.J. Heinz & Co.) until his tragic death in an aircraft accident in April 1991.\n\nDuring his time working for Senator Heinz, John authored part of the 1991 US Defense Production Act. In 1991 Deasy and Heinz’s Chief of Staff began work for a multinational waste company, Chambers Development Co.. He returned to Capitol Hill in 1993 as a Legislative Assistant in the US House of Representatives, handling trade, foreign affairs, energy, environment, banking, economic development, immigration and human rights for Republican Ronald K. Machtley in the run-up to his bid to become Governor of Rhode Island.\n\nWhile working in the House of Representatives John authored the Tourist Visa Waiver Bill, which allowed Irish citizens to travel to US for a holiday without having to obtain a visa. Passed in 1994, it has turned out to be a significant piece of immigration law.\n\nHe subsequently spent two years as Manager of Legislative Affairs for Chicago-based international law firm, Gardner Carton & Douglas, a company with approximately 400 attorneys. During his time there he successfully lobbied Congress to repeal a tax on CFCs used in inhalers for asthmatics and people with respiratory problems. The money saved amounted to $60 million per annum. He also worked extensively with the Senate Finance Committee and house ways and means committee handling tax issues for Native American Indian tribes.\n\nIn 1997 John returned to Ireland, completing a Bachelor of Civil Laws (Honours) degree at University College Cork.\n\nIn May 2005, he married the RTÉ television presenter and former TV3 crime correspondent, Maura Derrane. In May 2014 the couple celebrated the birth of their son, Cal.\n\nPublic Life\n\nJohn Deasy was elected as a member of both Waterford County Council and Dungarvan Town Council in 1999 at the first attempt, topping the poll in both ballots.\n\nDuring his time on the County Council, John is credited with changing the culture that existed when it came to the loose oversight of planning regulations within the local authority. In 2000 he made allegations concerning the administration of planning guidelines that led to a series of internal and external investigations.\n\nAfter three years as a councillor he was elected as a TD, retaining the Dáil seat held by his father Austin, a former Minister for Agriculture in the 1982–’87 FG/Labour coalition government.\n\nJohn served as Fine Gael frontbench spokesperson for Justice, Equality and Law Reform from 2002-’04, being described by journalist Sam Smyth as having “a natural rapport with law-and-order traditionalists” and someone who “never bent a principle to duck a row.” In that, he said, “Deasy shares many of the qualities of his father... Both are famously stubborn, prickly and principled, yet they enjoy a dry humour and a proud nationalism.”\n\nWhen John defied the smoking ban in 2004 he was subsequently appointed as chairman of the Oireachtas European Affairs Committee from October 2004 until April 2007, before being re-elected to the 30th Dáil. He was chairperson of the Overseas Development subcommittee until October 2010 and also served as FG spokesperson on Foreign Affairs with special responsibility for Overseas Development Aid during that period.\n\nJohn topped the poll in Waterford in the February 2011 General Election, receiving a 20% share of first preferences. He is a currently a member of the high-profile Dáil Committee of Public Accounts, having also served on the State spending watchdog from 2004–’07. He has specialised in oversight of overseas development budgets while on the Public Accounts and Foreign Affairs committees.\n\nJohn is also regarded as one of the PAC’s most considered contributors. In February 2014 he was described by political correspondent Daniel McConnell in the Sunday Independent as “a voice of reason within the committee”, while fellow political commentator Shane Coleman, writing in the Irish Independent, said: “Deasy is no PAC firebrand. He has been highly critical of the committee at times for looking to exceed its remit.”\n\nThe Irish Times’ political editor Stephen Collins concurred. “Deasy may not be flavour of the month with his own party leadership but he has been one of the few Government TDs on the PAC to stand up to the McCarthyite tactics that are threatening to undermine the long-term credibility of what is the most important of the Dáil committees.\n\nAs well as frequently expressing forthright views about Fine Gael's policies and political direction, John has also stood firm against Labour Party attempts to impose on the coalition demands at odds with their paltry poll rating. He has taken a hardline stance on issues such as a planned land-based means test on college grants for farm families, which led to a swift Labour climbdown.\n\nHe also took aim at their ‘vote buying’ bid to reverse public service pay cuts, warning “we would prefer an election” than submissively keeping their junior partners “sweet”. John said, “If Labour starts putting a gun to our head every second week they can take their chances with Sinn Féin.”\n\nRepublican roots\n\nBoth John’s paternal grandfather, Mick Deasy from Courtmacsherry (who fought with Tom Barry and was the last survivor of the Crossbarry ambush) and his maternal grandfather, John Keating from west Waterford, fought with the IRA in the War of Independence.\n\nAsked by the Sunday Independent to comment on the “Blueshirts” controversy surrounding ‘Dreamland’, the 2014 play by Waterford playwright Jim Nolan, John said: “The history of the thing is not something I relate to. Both my grandfathers were in the IRA in the War of Independence. I come from a different tradition.”\n\nHe also had three grand-uncles from Bandon who fought in the Great War — a lineage that part-inspired his initiation of the Waterford Memorial project which, in October 2013, saw a vast black granite wall (similar in concept to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington) unveiled in Dungarvan. The monument is inscribed with the names of those 1,100 Waterford people who lost their lives in WWI.\n\nSports\n\nJohn's scholarship to study at Mercyhurst College was partly athletic. He was a member of the Dungarvan Golf Club team (along with Austin Spratt, Derry Kiely and Kieran Hogan) that won the All-Ireland Junior Foursomes title in 1985.\n\nHe was sports editor of the college newspaper and played soccer and golf for Mercyhurst, and also football and hurling for the Washington Gaels GAA Club, as well as the Waterford exiles in New York in 1987 when he marked legendary Tribesman Pete Finnerty in a hurling challenge match against Galway at Gaelic Park (“I kept him scoreless for 20 seconds”).\n\n2015 Irish Dignitary\n\nSenator Catherine Noone\n\nSenator Catherine Noone was elected to Seanad Éireann on the Industrial and Commercial Panel in April 2011. Catherine is currently the Fine Gael Seanad Spokesperson on European Affairs.\n\nShe was elected to Dublin City Council in June 2009.\n\nA practicing solicitor of commercial litigation, originally from Co Mayo, Catherine has been living in Dublin for the last number of years. Catherine and her family have had a long-standing association with Fine Gael. She speaks fluent Italian having studied at the Universita di Verona.\n\nCatherine is a member of the Housing Strategic Policy Committee on Dublin City Council and a board member of the Hugh Lane Gallery and the Temple Bar Cultural Trust. She is also committee member of the Council's Women's Group who work to create awareness and to celebrate International Women's Day.\n\nShe is keenly interested in the Arts and believes it to be more important than ever as a sector in these financially turbulent times.\n\nTourism is also a sector on which we have relied heavily in the past during challenging financial times and she endeavours to promote tourism by promoting incentives and measures to strengthen the Irish Tourism Product.\n\nCatherine will be flying into the United States on Wednesday March 11, and she will stay with us until St. Patrick’s Day where she has been invited to a dinner at the White House. She will be accompanied by her husband, Barry Flanagan.\n\n2012 Irish Dignitary\n\nSenator Maurice Cummins\n\n2011 Irish Dignitary\n\nDavid Stanton\n\nDavid Stanton (born 15 February 1957) is an Irish Fine Gael politician.
