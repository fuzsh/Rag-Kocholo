        "text": "Name: Tim Broderick. Party: Independent. Bio: Tim Broderick is a 47-year-old self-employed businessman married to Edel and they have two children. He is a fifth-generation publican in Kilconnell and has been a member of Galway County Council since 2009. Contact 087-2728058. Statement: I am running as an independent candidate offering a fresh and credible alternative to the people of east Galway. I will work for my constituents and prioritise their needs and interests free of party restraint. I believe the onus is on independents to engage constructively in national and local politics. If elected I will not hold the state to ransom but ensure a fair deal for Galway East. We have consistently been one of the most neglected constituencies in Ireland. Since elected as a councillor I have donated all my expenses to local charities. Unvouched expenses and politics as a career of enrichment must end. Complete, not token reform, of our stale political system is central to this. To create jobs there must be reform of the commercial rates system and incentives for business start-ups and rewards for existing ones. We must start the M17 Gort to Tuam motorway and facilitate apprenticeships through local authority projects. Existing healthcare facilities must be retained in east Galway. Investment in education is crucial to our future and we must support school buildings over prefabs and have smaller classroom sizes. We need political reform to give more autonomy to local government, abolish unvouched expenses, as well as a radical overhaul of the social welfare system. Name: Emer O'Donnell. Party: Independent. Bio: Emer is from Nogra, Kinvara. She lived and worked in Australia for almost 20 years before moving back to Galway with her husband Bartley and three children in 2007. This is her first time contesting a General Election. Statement: There is a pervasive sadness among the electorate that those entrusted to the care of our Nation appear to have failed us. I am running as an independent candidate because I no longer wish to allocate blame, I would like to be part of the solution. I am not interested in party politics. I am interested in policies that have merit and do not cause additional hardship. I want a streamlined government that leads by example, not rhetoric. I believe that the salaries and expenses of elected officials should be reduced and golden handshakes and early pensions should cease. These measures should be extended to executive salaries and bonuses within state-sponsored bodies. Union executives might also take note. While this would not raise the billions needed, it would demonstrate that public representatives are motivated by a love of their Nation rather than party, power or money. With regard to our public finances, I believe in watching the pennies and the pounds will mind themselves. For example, Ã¢â€šÂ¬4 million saved through the reallocation of miscellaneous government expenses could provide 100 people with incomes of Ã¢â€šÂ¬40,000 a year; or it could provide a Ã¢â€šÂ¬4,000 grant to a thousand students. I believe these are achievable, realistic and confident steps in the right direction and a strong foundation for the challenges facing us. We need a voice. Add yours to mine. Le gach dea-mhÃƒÂ©inn. Email: emero_donnell@hotmail.com. Name: CiarÃƒÂ¡n Kennedy. Party: Green Party Bio: This is his first time contesting an election. Statement: Sorry but I am not doing any press because of time pressures. I am on the ballot so that people who want to vote Green can do so. Name: Paul Connaughton Jnr Party: Fine Gael Bio: Paul Connaughton is the son of outgoing Galway East TD Paul Connaughton Snr. He is single and lives in Mountbellew and is a member of Galway Co Council. Statement Mountbellew based Cllr Paul Connaughton (29) has a Certificate in Agriculture from Mountbellew Agricultural College as well as a Degree in Business, specialising in Marketing, from GMIT and Mountbellew Agricultural College. Also H.Dip in Marketing from NUIG and is currently employed by Foroige (National Youth Organisation) as a Youth Worker. Topped the poll in the 2009 County Council elections with 2563 votes Key Priorities: Ã¢€Â¢Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Getting Ireland back to work and halt heartbreaking emigration Ã¢€Â¢Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Make patient care the centre of a new Health System.Ã‚Â Portunicula Hospital must be a centrepiece in this new health plan Ã¢€Â¢Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Help families with crippling mortgages to keep their family homes Ã¢€Â¢Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Secure the continuation of the Single Farm Payment, Area Based payment, REPS and ensure that any climate change legislation will not prevent farmers from making a decent living from the land Ã¢€Â¢Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Turf Cutters must be given every opportunity to cut their own domestic supply of turf from their own bogs. Ã¢€Â¢Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â The only Agricultural College in the West of Ireland in Mountbellew must remain open Ã¢€Â¢Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â No increase in income tax I would be honoured to be elected to the next DÃƒÂ¡il. If elected I will represent you, your family and community to the best of my ability. That is why I am asking you for your No.1 vote on Election Day. Contact me at Ballinlass,Mountbellew 087 2354682 or Email: connaughtonpaul1@hotmail.com You can follow my campaign on Twitter and Facebook Name: Michael F Dolan Party:Ã‚Â Fianna Fail Bio:Ã‚Â Michael F Dolan is a native of Monivea and runs an accountancy practice, which employs 10 people in Loughrea. He has managed several Fianna Fail election campaigns and is active with community work in the Athenry area. Aged 46 he is married to Dr Antoinette Dolan and the couple have four children. This is his first time running for any election. Statement Michael F Dolan wants in Politics: Ã¢€Â¢ Accountability Ã¢€Â¢ Responsibility Ã¢€Â¢ Common Sense Michael believes that the key issues are accountability, responsibility and common sense. It is Michael's conviction that lack of the above were the cause of the major financial difficulties in our country and can actually be the solution to the major problems and crisis, which our country faces. Michael is a new face in politics and has never been a public representative at local or national level. He has never stood for election in any previous elections and this is the first time that Michael had let his name go forward at a convention for selection as a candidate. Michael F Dolan is a qualified accountant and has operated his own accountancy practice in Loughrea town since 1985. Michael's business represents a diverse range of clients who are involved in small business and the agricultural sector, and he understands and appreciates the severe difficulties and Challenges, which a small business and individuals at large are encountering because of the current economic crisis. Name: Micheal Kitt Party: Fianna Fail Bio: Micheal Kitt is a sitting TD based in Castleblakeney. He has been a member of the Oireachtas, Dail and Seanad, since 1975. Married to Catherine, the couple have three sons and one daughter. Statement I am committed to investment in rural Ireland and to creating employment in the agriculture and food sector, arts, and culture and the tourism industry.Ã‚Â The Common Agricultural Policy Review should provide for full funding and should reflect the income of small farmers by providing suitable schemes for them. My background is in education as a former primary teacher and as Chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee from 1997 to 2002. I would continue to press for investment in school buildings and I welcome the Ã¢â€šÂ¬400 million allocated for 2011.Ã‚Â The issue of staffing has to be addressed and increased funding is now available for technology in primary schools.Ã‚Â Under the devolved scheme, there is specific funding for the students in each classroom. I would continue to promote the school library and county library services. We need to improve services in our local hospitals, to have good community care programmes and to protect the disability funding.Ã‚Â Every parish in County Galway has voluntary and community organisations who have plans for development.Ã‚Â Many of these organisations look after the most vulnerable.Ã‚Â They have to be supported through rural social schemes, FAS schemes, rural transport initiatives and continued support for family resource centres. I believe that we have international obligations to the people in developing countries, promotion of Fair Trade products can be of great assistance to the poorest of the poor. The road development programme has been successful including the motorway from Galway to Dublin and the funding of the new roadway from Gort to Tuam including the Tuam By-pass. Name: Ciaran Cannon Party: Fine Gael Bio: Ciaran Cannon is a member of the Seanad and a former leader of the PDs. He is married to Niamh and the couple have one son. He is from Kiltullagh, Athenry and lives in Carrabane, Loughrea. Statement 'Seven years ago I was the Chief Executive of a national charity that provides holidays for children with special needs. I saw the daunting challenges that special needs children had to face with little support from the state. Trust in our political system, which should function as a cornerstone of society, had been seriously damaged. I decided then that there was only one way to play my part in changing things and that was to get directly involved in our political system. Seven years later I am still convinced of the power of positive politics. Ireland needs a major programme of reform and meaningful change. Fine Gael is the only party proposing to carry out this reform and I want to be part of our national drive for real and lasting change. We here in east Galway are more than willing to play our part in that reform process and in rebuilding our country's economy. Our farmers produce high quality food that is the envy of Europe and Fine Gael in government will continue to support this most important sector of our economy. We have numerous indigenous businesses like JFC Manufacturing and C&F Tooling who are now world leaders in their respective fields. Fine Gael in government will create a new business environment so that many more entrepreneurs can create hundreds of jobs in east Galway. We will create a government and a public service that will put your family and your community at the heart of everything that we do. It is time to say goodbye to our difficult past and look forward to a brighter future and a new generation of politicians who are ambitious for east Galway, and for Ireland.' Name: Tom McHugh Party: Fine Gael Bio: Tom McHugh is a member of Galway Co Council and a businessman. He is married to Sally and they have four adult children. He is a former Mayor of Co Galway. He is in politics since 1999 and contested the last General Election. Statement I started my working life as a carpenterÃ‚Â and progressed to found and run a construction company, Tom McHugh (Kilcloghans) Ltd. I also run the family business in Kiltevna and the Ard RÃƒÂ­ House Hotel, in Tuam which opened for business in April 2008. I was first elected to Galway County Council in 1999, re-elected in 2004 and 2009. Served as Mayor of County Galway June 2009 Ã¢€â€œ June 2010.Ã‚Â I contested the General Election in 2007 and received 4,882 first preference votes. My priorities as a Tuam-based candidate in this election is job creation, healthcare, education, law and order and protection of the vulnerable and the progress of our agricultural industry. I believe I have now served my political apprenticeship and I believe I am fully aware of the needs of our people.Ã‚Â I have spent the past 30 years in business and I feel, if elected, I have a meaningful contribution to make in the field of establishing new business and stabilizing existing ones across the broad range of industry.Ã‚Â It is business that will create jobs and I believe this is what our people require most. I am asking the people of the Tuam Region and the constituency of Galway East to give me their support in this Election. A Tuam-based TD within Government can make a difference to peoples' every day lives. Name: Colm Keaveney Party: Labour Bio:Ã‚Â Colm Keaveney is married with three children. He is a full-time union representative and a member of Galway Co Council. This will be his third attempt to gain a seat for Labour in Galway East. Statement Colm Keaveney is an experienced and vociferous campaigner who has been involved in politics since he contested his first General Election for the Labour Party in 1997. Colm was elected to Tuam Town Council twelve years ago and has been returned twice to Galway County Council for the Tuam Electoral area. Colm has been involved in campaigning from a political and professional stance all his adult life and has gained invaluable experience as a skilled negotiator who will be in a strong position to represent you in the 31st Dail. Eamonn Gilmore wants Colm Keaveney on his team. This election is the most important election ever and now more than ever we need an influential and articulate voice to put our community to the fore. Labour will soon be in Government and as the most experienced Labour Party candidate in the West of Ireland Colm is well placed to deliver the highest quality representation. Colm believes that protecting education and health services will be critical for families in East Galway; Labour in Government will protect families and essential services. As part of the next Government Colm will prioritise job creation for East Galway to ensure that emigration for work is a choice not a necessity; only a Government TD can make a difference. We have learned the hard way that independent Politicians cannot deliver for this community so I am appealing to you to use your vote effectively and return a strong vibrant candidate who's only vested interest is you. Vote No 1 Colm Keaveney Name: Sean Canney. Party: Independent. Bio: SeÃƒÂ¡n, from Claretuam, was elected as an independent member of Galway County Council in 2004 and was re-elected in 2009. He served as Mayor of County Galway during 2007-2008. He is married to Geraldine McHugh and they have three children. Statement North East Galway has the population to elect a TD. I am running to give voters an opportunity to support a candidate who is completely independent. My vision is to assist in creating jobs for people in Galway East. This can be partly achieved by proceeding immediately with the M17 from Gort to Tuam and the Western Rail Corridor. We need to immediately abolish the Seanad and use the Ã¢â€šÂ¬25 million saved each year to fund our County & City Enterprise Boards, which have a proven track record in job creation. Business is under pressure to survive and commercial rates must be reformed to make the rates levied proportional to the profits of the business. We need to have an independent voice to be an advocate for people with disabilities and the vulnerable members of society. Galway East is a great place to live and we need to promote this area as a tourist destination. I believe that bog owners should be allowed cut turf in their own bogs for their own use. North East Galway has failed to elect a TD because the parties use us to vote for their candidates, who aren't elected, but when eliminated our votes are used to elect TDs in South Galway. Name: Dermot Connolly. Party: Sinn FÃƒÂ©in. Bio: Dermot is 42 years old and from Glennavaddogue, Aughrim, Ballinasloe. He worked for 15 years in Dubarry Shoes until he was made redundant in 2004. He now runs the family farm. He was elected to Galway Co Council in 2004 and retained his seat in 2009. Statement: I will seek public transport provisions to include and increase frequency of train services for Ballinasloe, Woodlawn and Attymon and the continuation of the Western Rail corridor as a matter of urgency. I will also seek for improved services for users of the bus network. I will continue campaigning for adequate provisions of primary health care centres, support for those with disabilities, and fight to ensure Portiuncula hospital continues as a fully-serviced hospital. Dermot Connolly will oppose measures that prevent domestic turf cutting. I will work to implement the schools' building programme, which will get people back to work and remove our children from sub-standard conditions. Dermot Connolly will fight to maintain the universal service obligation and state support for postal services. I will fight the reversal of cuts and for local government to be adequately resourced to provide a proper road network and water services. I will press insurance companies to provide comprehensive and universal flood insurance coverage. I will demand that the OPW develops a comprehensive programme to deal with flood alleviation measures. With regard to agriculture, I will demand measures which will ensure a decent standard of living for those involved in agriculture and will seek full country-of-origin labelling for all beef, lamb and poultry products. With increasing numbers of people emigrating and seeking employment, Sinn FÃƒÂ©in is the only party that has published a credible and costed job creation strategy to get people back to work. Name: Jimmy McClearn Party: Fine Gael Bio: Cllr Jimmy McClearn is from Killimor and is the current Mayor of Co Galway. He is married to Noreen and the couple have three children. He runs his own building company. Statement Current Mayor of County Galway andÃ‚Â member of Galway Co Council for 15 years, representing the Loughrea Area. Chairperson of Killimor GAA club for a number ofÃ‚Â years currently Chairperson ofÃ‚Â Killimor, Tiernascragh , Fahy and QuansboroÃ‚Â Community Employment Scheme which employs 36 people. Married to Noreen, they have two sons and one daughter. Jimmy runs his own business engaged inÃ‚Â electrical, building, and civil engineering services, from a farming background, he is fully aware of the unique difficulties now being experienced by small business and the self employed. Many of these people who paid enormous amounts of taxes during the boom years now have no work and are being refused job-seekers benefit or allowance. If elected Jimmy will work to: Ã¢€Â¢Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Safe guard and update facilities at Portiuncula Hospital, to serve a wider catchment area. Ã¢€Â¢Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ensure the Government introduces a jobs stimulus package to create employment and give hope back to the Irish people. Ã¢€Â¢Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Help identify and source funding to develop Tourism projects throughout South and East Galway Ã¢€Â¢Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Protect and retain farm support payments post 2013 and ensure the development of the agri-foodÃ‚Â industry. Ã¢€Â¢Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Implement a package of measures to relieve the misery that many are enduring as a result of mortgage arrears. Ã¢€Â¢Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Retain and improve facilities and services for the elderly, special needs, and the disadvantaged. Ã¢€Â¢Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Give a greater input into legislation concerning rural Ireland by the people who live there. I believe that the Irish People all working together have the capacity to rebuild our countryÃ‚Â and restore our respect and pride amongst the nations of the world. Name: Lorraine Higgins Party: Labour Bio: Lorraine Higgins is from Athenry and is a barrister. She contested the 2009 local elections for a seat on Galway Co Council, polling 1,187 votes. Lorraine is a keen golfer and is an active member of Junior Chamber International Galway. Statement I am running for Dail Eireann with a clear and positive plan to build a better and a more hopeful Galway East. The old politics of our community have failed us and we need change now.Ã‚Â This election is the most important election in a generation and while the challenges are immense the Labour Party and I are ready for the task. I am determined to bring real change to politics in Galway East by working hard to rebuild our local economy, create jobs and ensure prosperity for all, to protect all of our vital public services and to implement new debt-forgiveness programmes to help families and small businesses in financial difficulty. I believe that in Government we should help people improve their lives, not try to run their lives. I want to help implement the change which will give us the future we all deserve. With your support, I can play a key part in DÃƒÂ¡il Ãƒâ€°ireann. The time has now come for a new face with new ideas for Galway East. Please vote number 1 for me, Lorraine Higgins. I will not let you down. Please Vote No. 1."
