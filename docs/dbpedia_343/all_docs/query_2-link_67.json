        "text": "I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"\n\nIn 2013, the House passed the Local Government Reform Bill, which was steered through by Phil Hogan, who was then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. My party was in government at that time. Some 80 town councils were abolished, which was a mistake. I personally regret that the Government of which I was a member made that decision and that we did not stop town councils from being abolished at that time. I spent the past three days at the British Labour Party conference trying to persuade the British people to think again on a matter of some importance to this country. If one recognises that something needs to be done differently, it is important to put forward a solution. Town councils were replaced by 137 municipal district councils which were essentially sub-committees of the county council. Let us not pretend they were anything else. They are sub-committees of the county council and are seen as such. They were also replaced by public participation networks ,which were meant to involve local community groups and other civic society actors in discussing local concerns. That was an extension of a proposal that I made many years ago when I was in the Department of the Environment and published a document called Better Local Government.\n\nIt is fair to say that five years later, this policy has not delivered an ideal system of local government. I acknowledge it is not all bad. Some public participation networks have successfully engaged with civic society and with their own communities but they are very much reliant on the presence of active citizens and organisations in particular areas. In other places, public participation networks have not worked so well and that must be acknowledged too. Municipal district councils have not delivered as a replacement for town government. I say this as somebody who has been involved in the local government system since I was a town councillor. I have been mayor of Wexford, a county councillor and Minister for the Environment and I have been involved in looking at the evolution of local government and at people attempting to alter local government. One thing I have been clear on for a very long time is that for decades, the Department of the Environment was anxious to merge town government into a county structure. As I have said, municipal district councils, as were created in 2013, have not delivered.\n\nFirst and foremost, they operate across urban and rural areas in a way that undermines the concept of the urban centre, the town, the driver, the heartland of a community. A town is a defined urban area, a place with clear boundaries, with deep municipal histories that in many instances, as both Ministers of State here will remember, go back a long time. These are areas with an identity.\n\nA clear focus on building towns lends itself to better planning decisions, more compact coherent settlement patterns, which in turn facilitates the delivery of public services, and which are more likely to deliver a stronger local economy. Strong and vibrant towns drive local communities. They drive not only the urban environment but also rural enterprise and they create jobs. Towns are central to economic development. They are the central focus of commercial activity up and down the country, and all of us who have had the opportunity to travel up and down the country know that.\n\nThere are approximately 100 towns in Ireland with a population of more than 5,000 people in what we describe as \"defined urban boundaries\". Some of them have had town councils for more than a century, and some for many centuries. Others, notably places like Swords and Blanchardstown, never had a town council, despite in some cases having populations in the tens of thousands.\n\nWe propose changes to what existed in the past. Our proposals are for a single type of town council which is a uniform system across the country, rather than the system which many of us remember, where there were town commissions, town councils, urban district councils and borough councils - each with not only varying membership but also varying powers. In the past, there were also large towns which had no council at all for anomalous historical reasons.\n\nI ask people to give our proposal a fair hearing because it is one of the most important democratic initiatives that we can take as a House. We propose councils of nine members for every town with a population of 5,000 inhabitants or more, and councils of 15 members where the town population exceeds 25,000. The restoration of town government is to be done on a cost-neutral basis using the existing local government resources, simply moving the personnel that was taken from the town councils back to them.\n\nTown government is not primarily about the economy, however, important and all as that is. It is about local democracy. According to an Edelman global survey of people's trust in institutions, Ireland scores particularly low. In 2018 just over one third of the people, 35%, reported trust in government. A lack of trust in government, the media and so-called \"experts\" is a recurrent theme not only for Ireland but around the world. It was a theme that helped elect US President Donald Trump, it was a theme that drove Brexit, and it has been a theme in the argument made by populist, nationalist parties across Europe, which continues to be made by them, as Mr. Steve Bannon and some of his cohorts arrive on our shores now to bang a populist drum. The whole theme is best summarised in one of the Brexit slogans, \"Take back control\", or in President Trump's election slogan, \"Make America great again\". They have all these empowering-sounding slogans.\n\nWhat we want to do in the Bill that we are now proposing to this House is to give real power back to local people at local level. One of the core principles of the European Union is subsidiarity, which is the idea that decisions should be taken as closely as possible to the persons or people who will be affected by them. It makes sense for the population of towns, that is, those most affected by the decisions of local government, to be directly involved and consulted.\n\nWhat does \"Take back control\" mean? It sounds mundane but it really is relevant. If Deputies talk to people in their communities, they will find that the things most people get animated about are what we would call \"the smaller things\", namely, the street lights, the footpaths, the vacant buildings, dog-fouling or minor things in the greater scheme of things but important things for people. It is town councillors, who are clearly accountable to the local population, who address those issues most effectively. Many people involved at local level do not know who their town councillors are because, as the Ministers of State know, the councillors in my area, for example, are drawn from a quarter of the entire county of Wexford. It is just not working. It is often the job of councillors to inform citizens about what is going on with planning permission, big development plans and to bring them around to some of the big ideas. Citizens must know and trust the people they have elected to do that. It is that interface or immediacy which is so important.\n\nThis proposal is undoing a mistake that was made, and it goes much further than the status quo. I am not asking people to go back to exactly what existed prior to the abolition of town councils, but to put in a uniform system where every urban centre will have the opportunity to elect its own council and restore the immediate connection of the community to the elected council. I ask the Ministers of State present and the Government to give fair consideration to what is a truly important proposal.\n\nI thank the Ministers of State for coming in today. The Labour Party proposes this Bill because we believe it is necessary. My party colleagues around the country felt that getting rid of town councils was a mistake and that reforming and regenerating how they worked was the right thing to do, but we went a step too far. I am thinking of people like Mr. Sean Counihan in Killarney, who has been chasing us on this issue for years. It was a mistake, and it was one made by Fine Gael and the Labour Party. We need to deal with it now. I thank in advance Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin and others who have said they would support such a change.\n\nThis is a practical Bill to bring back town councils for towns that have 5,000 people or more, and it is necessary. In my county, Nenagh, Thurles and other towns need town councils, because town councils are on the money when it comes to issues relating to real things that affect people in towns. One can see how the municipal districts and the areas covered by the council at county council level do not get down into the detail as quickly as possible.\n\nOur proposal is cost neutral, which means it should be embraced even more. It also gives the opportunity to right the wrongs of situations, such as Ballincollig and other towns, that did not have town councils when they should have had then, while other areas had town councils historically which maybe should not have. The Government has an opportunity to right a wrong as well as dealing with something that is needed.\n\nIt is also apparent that it is needed when at various announcements and when dignitaries come to an area the representative is not from the area. He or she could be from the other side of the county, doing his or her best, and be a good person across a whole range of different political views, but not actually from the area. In a situation where there are town councils, they would obviously elect one of their own in order that if there were a major tourism initiative, a major announcement or a dignitary coming to the town, he or she would be able to deal with it and do so with local knowledge. There would be no need to ask for directions or where the event was on.\n\nWe recommend that a local government commission should have between nine and 15 members.\n\nWe are open to compromise in how that works but that is our proposal. In fairness to the Minister, he has acknowledged that there is a need for a change. I refer to the changes made to the local government boundaries. I looked at my own local district municipal unit of Nenagh. The councillors from all parties were expected to cover an area that extended from the Limerick border to the Clare border and all the way to the Galway border. It was incredible, crazy and impossible for many councillors, paid €17,000 or €18,000 a year, to cover that area. That has been acknowledged, as the councillors are in the same municipal area now. The local electoral area has been changed and made more realistic for their area of coverage. That was a step in a positive direction. Now we need to go further when it comes to dealing with the return of town councils and add to the progress made in recent times. When it comes to town councils, there may be some push back against this within the local government administration. I know what I am talking about in this regard from previous jobs I held.\n\nUltimately, Deputy Eoghan Murphy is the Minister and we are the people's forum. Town councils may have been a nuisance for some in local authority administrations. I do not accept that. I believe the decision was wrong and it is up to us, the Minister and the Government to be strong and to support this Bill because we know it is the right thing to do. Walking around the corridors of Leinster House, the majority of Members in the Minister's party, my party and in Fianna Fáil - no other party is represented in the House at the moment - know that we have to do this. If the current Government will not do it, it will have to be done by a future Government. I ask the Government to take the opportunity we have now to deal with this issue and show a bit of progressiveness and embrace what we are doing. The Government can change it if it wants. We are not stuck in the mud on every single detail. We will embrace any changes that the Government wants to bring forward but I believe that the Dáil is going to vote to back this Bill. I hope the Government will accept it in that spirit.\n\nWhen I was a Minister of State and somebody asked me before an Irish Presidency Competitiveness Council meeting whether I was nervous going into such a big room with all those European Union Ministers from the 27 members states, I had to say that if a person had ever chaired a meeting of Mallow Town Council then he or she could chair a meeting of any forum anywhere in the world. I am proud of the fact that I started there, as did my late father in 1967. In government, we become part of a collective agreement and I was part of the decision that collectively agreed to abolish town councils. I am glad that we as a party have taken a decision to seek to rescind that decision. It was a grievous error and I acknowledge fully that I was part of that decision. I support the legislation that we have put forward so that we can create again the front-line for representative democracy, that is, through our municipal or district councils. People will argue that local authorities such as Cork County Council have the municipal districts.\n\nIn my experience, since their creation, people have been a little removed from the decision-making mechanisms. The resources of the local authorities have become more stretched in the allocation of engineers, housing staff and outdoor staff and they are covering a larger geographic area. If we decide to implement this legislation as a Legislature and reinstate town councils, what we will put back into them is the core competency of staff who always looked after these towns. Since the abolition of town councils, I have noticed a diminution of services in towns. I am sure many Members find themselves doing council-related work more often. We are all happy to do that because all politics is local and we will help everybody at every turn of the road, no matter how high up the food chain we go politically. I believe though that having a coterie of town councillors again representing districts and towns would be another service. It would mean a return to basics and to core principles in representative democracy and the people would welcome that.\n\nNo matter what town a person comes from, when he or she walks down the main street as a public representative - whether as a councillor, a Deputy or a Minister - there will always be somebody on a Friday or Saturday afternoon that will ask why we abolished the town councils. I am hard-pressed to give an answer. This legislation seeks to address that. People liked the idea that they had a local person they could go to who would represent their interests and advocate for the bread and butter issues that affect them. I refer to getting the bread and butter issues or the simple things right because sometimes it is the simple things that exercise people. The town council gave everybody access on those bread and butter issues. There is now a sense of remoteness. Citizens in towns do not feel that connectedness through the relationships in the municipal districts. That is something that this legislation would address.\n\nI move amendment No. 1:\n\nTo delete all words after \"That\" and substitute the following:\n\n\"Dáil Éireann declines to give the Local Government (Restoration of Town Councils) Bill 2018 a Second Reading in order that the issue of town councils can be considered in the context of the report ‘Municipal Governance – Districts, Towns and Local Electoral Areas’ on potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability, and to ensure that local government funding, structures and responsibilities strengthen local democracy, including the issues of town or borough council status and reduction in the size of local electoral areas, which is currently under consideration by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government.\"\n\nI will go back to my council days as well to get the amendment procedures corrected. I welcome this opportunity to discuss important issues relating to the local government system, to hear the views of Deputies, and to share with the House the Government’s proposals for the future of local government in Ireland. One thing that most of us value is the work of local government, be that in the former town councils or the existing local authority areas and local councils. Most of us present served that apprenticeship and it is without doubt a major benefit coming into this House as a Deputy and going on to be committee chairmen or Ministers or Ministers of State. The opportunity that one gets at local government level is second to none. It gets a person ready for a proper career in politics and political representation. We cannot value that enough. Many of us have developed good working relationships at that level as well and that has benefits in this House because we carry that with us right the way through. Local government has achieved much when it comes to politics and we all value that. We might differ over the different versions of it and disagree with certain parts of it but we all recognise the importance of local government one way or the other. It is important that we remind ourselves of that as well.\n\nThe Bill proposes the re-establishment of town councils, as recommended by a Local Government Commission based on the census report on population distribution and movements published by the Central Statistics Office. We are opposing the Bill, mainly for reasons of timing, as the matters raised are part of the report on local government matters and have been submitted to the Government and the Oireachtas under the Programme for a Partnership Government. There are also parts with which we might agree with but for now we think the timing of it is premature. I am instead proposing that Dáil Éireann declines to give the Bill a Second Reading in order that the issue of town councils can be considered in the context of the report, Municipal Governance - Districts, Towns and Local Electoral Areas. This examines potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability and to ensure local government funding, structures and responsibilities strengthen local democracy, including the issues of town or borough council status and a reduction in the size of local electoral areas. That is currently under consideration by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government.\n\nThe report is with the committee, having been submitted to it for consideration in April. It is appropriate to allow the committee time to complete its deliberations before making any decisions. The Government's, Action Programme for Effective Local Government - Putting People First, which was the platform for the wide-ranging reform programme implemented in 2014, set out an ambitious vision for local government to be the main vehicle of governance and public service at local level, leading economic, social and community development, delivering efficient and good value services and representing citizens and local communities effectively and accountably. We intend to further that objective, building on the significant improvements that have been made in recent years. All of us can see how local government has stepped up in the past number of years to deliver a much wider range of services.\n\nLocal authorities have been involved in driving both social and economic development and have had some great success, and that should be recognised. They are taking a greater role, and in my view are much more of an authority than they used to be and are much more relevant across the board in many aspects of the development of our towns and counties, and rightly so. They are the key vehicle for making things happen at a local level. I have certainly seen the benefits in recent years.\n\nThe next stage in that process is the report to the Government and the Oireachtas under the programme for partnership Government on potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability and to ensure that local government structures and responsibilities strengthen local democracy. The programme signals this process as the next wave of local government reform and indicates specific issues to be considered, including reducing the size of local electoral areas and the question of town and borough councils. To date, several papers have been submitted to the Government and to the Oireachtas for consideration. In addition to the paper on municipal governance, papers on local authority boundaries and local authority structures have also been completed. Indeed, the recommendations in the local authority structures paper are the main substance of the Local Government Bill 2018 which will be before this House in the coming weeks. My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Phelan, also will bring forward proposals on local authority leadership, governance and administration - the issue of directly elected mayors - in the coming weeks, and a final paper examining devolution of functions will also be presented to Government in the coming weeks.\n\nTo achieve the vision set out in the 2012 policy document, the structural framework must be fit for purpose. Accordingly, a core element of the reform programme was structural reorganisation, involving the unification of certain city and county councils, and replacing 80 former town councils by municipal districts integrated with the county councils in a new, innovative, system of governance. This builds on the Barrington committee report of 1991 which identified the need to overhaul sub-county arrangements including the replacement of existing town authorities and also highlighted significant concerns with the existing town council system, including the issue of double representation, where towns have separate councils in addition to representation at county level. Outdated boundaries and other anomalies have now been removed. The new system provides more effective and community-focused decision-making and implementation. There is full integration of local authority resources across each county and elimination of duplication both in administrative and electoral terms. The new municipal district system is also closer to the European norm, covering the entire territory of each county, in contrast with the previous unbalanced arrangement of isolated town councils, while rural areas, many town environs, and some larger centres lacked municipal status and local governance. Indeed, a 2013 Council of Europe report specifically welcomed the decision to replace the town council system with the new municipal district arrangement, particularly because it ended the dual franchise in towns, which the report described as unfair.\n\nAn important benefit of the new system is a more appropriate assignment of local authority functions. Local matters are dealt with at municipal district level, while those of wider strategic application are decided at county level, without duplication between county and district jurisdictions. In effect, there is now a dual system of governance but an integrated administrative structure in each county, which maximises operational efficiency while ensuring devolved decision-making throughout the county.\n\nTurning to the Bill itself, I must record that it has technical flaws, particularly the fact that it is linked to repealed provisions of the Local Government Act 2001. Substantial redrafting would be required if it were to progress. However, there are more fundamental issues in principle with the Bill. Insofar as there are shortcomings and scope for improvement in current local government arrangements, these matters can, and will, be addressed without resorting to the re-establishment of an array of town councils, if that is what this House decides. Nobody has said that everything is perfect. Ongoing reform is required and we must constantly tweak the system to make it better. The Bill relies on a local government commission to define the town councils. The local government commission is provided for in sections 89 to 95 of the Local Government Act 2001, which have not been commenced and were repealed in 2014; the commission does not exist. Even if the local government commission was in place, the Bill provides for the commission, and not the Minister, to make orders determining what constitutes a town, including defining the boundaries of a town. The Bill proposes that each town council would consist of one local electoral area. Having more town-focused local electoral areas was part of the terms of reference for the independent local electoral boundary review, which is now complete. Local electoral areas will be now be provided for in legislation, in line with the boundary review report recommendations, and these recommendations do not align with the proposal in the Bill that each town council would consist of one local electoral area. It would not be possible to implement the Bill's proposals based on the 2018 local electoral area boundary committee report.\n\nArguments being made for restoring the town councils, such as a lack of investment by local authorities in towns, are not generally supported by facts. My home town of Navan, for example, has been very well served by the municipal area approach, although I recognise that the boundary of the municipal area in that example is married closely to the new town boundary, as well as some rural areas. It is one of the municipal areas we got right, and that has been recognised with the changes that have happened with the boundaries. We have tried to recognise those larger towns and realign the boundaries to match up with some of those towns.\n\nConcerns about lack of urban focus, as well as geographically large municipal districts, have in the main been addressed by the local electoral area boundary review of 2018, published in June 2018, in line with its terms of reference to define distinct urban-focused local electoral areas as appropriate in respect of towns where the population was equal to or greater than 15,000. This provision also applied to county towns where they did not meet the population criteria.\n\nThere is little general support for the restoration of town councils, even among councillors, as has been confirmed on several occasions by comments from the Association of Irish Local Government. We have met that group at various meetings and it has said that it is not interested in restoration, and has said the same publically. We have to have this conversation, but-----\n\nAs the advancement of local government and the need to take centralised power from the Custom House is something about which I am passionate, I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this subject this afternoon. Indeed, I introduced a Bill on behalf of Fianna Fáil on the re-establishment of town councils last year, which was brought through Second Stage and committee scrutiny before Christmas, after which the Government tried to suffocate it with a money message. However, we will persevere.\n\nFianna Fáil is passionate about making sure that we can have an enhanced system of local democracy, because the model of the municipal district simply does not deliver that in a truly meaningful way. It has conspired against our urban centres and means they are not provided with the powers to improve the lives of the people living in them. We flagged this issue quite clearly, and indeed were joined in chambers across Ireland by members from other parties who shared our view. We said clearly that if key powers, including budgeting and planning powers, were taken from local towns, the ability to positively impact the way these towns are governed would be neutered. Each town is unique. Each has its own challenges and its own strengths. Accordingly, the ability for each town to set different commercial rates, rather than having one rate per county, was always helpful in bad economic times when councillors could use their discretion and judgment to help businesses survive. Equally, in terms of the passing of town plans, councillors in a particular urban centre knew the area best and could produce stronger plans.\n\nI spent 17 years as a councillor at town and county level, and our ability to get things done was far more effective at town council level, where we ran budget surpluses, had the powers to raise our own finance, take bank loans and pursue projects for the people of my town, Navan. These plans were not subjected to a vote or a debate at county council level, where there was an inherently anti-town attitude from many members from other geographical areas. We were already living in an over-centralised and under-represented system before the abolition of town councils, but it got worse after those councils were abolished. We once had 1,627 elected councillors in Ireland. It has been slashed to 950 in the name of reform. Lest anyone think we had too many councillors before this, let us reflect on the hard facts.\n\nThe average population per councillor in Ireland used to be 2,815 and even that was the highest in the EU in 2015, with the UK in second place. We now have one councillor for every 4,838 persons, effectively 5,000. Let us compare that with the rest of Europe. In France, there is one councillor for every 118 persons. France has 36,500 councillors. In fact, across Europe the average of number of people per councillor is in the hundreds, yet here we have one for every 5,000. Those issues might have gotten lost for the ordinary person in the street, but when ordinary people saw the impact hit home as their towns formed part of larger urban boundaries, in some cases the size of Dáil constituencies, the net impact was realised. As I said, the crucial issue of finance then kicked in and the revenue which had been raised in towns from commercial rates or parking charges was now pooled into a county council budget. Our towns have suffered as a result.\n\nPolitically, it has to be said that it was the Labour Party which supported Fine Gael in government in implementing this disaster. It was the assassination of our democracy and it was shameful. I heard Deputy Brendan Howlin in the Chamber earlier today accusing Fianna Fáil of buying popularity at election time, yet here we are debating the re-establishment of a much-needed layer of local government because Deputy Howlin and the Labour Party went along with a so-called \"populist\" move, culling 1,000 councillors in the name of reform to try to make it look to the public that they were doing something positive. It was unforgivable because it centralised more power. More devastatingly, it crippled the ability of small and large towns to run their own shows, to be free of the shackles of government and to progress their own plans. It took away their ability to show how imagination could create urban spaces that are a pleasure to work and live in.\n\nI read the email that Deputy Howlin sent around last week, with the mea culpa story about what they had done. It was like a fox going into a henhouse. Having savaged all the chickens, he meets the farmer on the way out, and with a shotgun at his head says \"Mea culpa\". That is Deputy Howlin. Here he is today, the Fantastic Mr. Fox, with feathers coming out of his mouth as he begs forgiveness for culling so many effective councils that represented the beating heart of our towns.\n\nI served on Navan Town Council and was honoured to have been mayor of my town on two occasions. We achieved a hell of a lot. Another town I know very well is Drogheda, located close to us, where the local government proudly held borough council status. That town has felt the brunt of this decision very badly. It is a town with a very proud Labour Party tradition, where I attended many meetings of the National Union of Journalists, NUJ, in the local union hall.\n\nI am pleased to have the opportunity to once again address the very important matter of local democracy. I spoke to a very similar Bill in 2017 introduced by the Deputy across from me, and, needless to say, my position has certainly not changed. The decision in 2014 to abolish our town and borough councils was a sad day for Ireland. It left a deep democratic deficit that has not, and will not, be filled unless this policy is reversed and these councils restored.\n\nWe can speak today about the destruction of rural Ireland and the breaking of the social contract between citizens and the State but the extent of power and decision-making removed from urban communities at the time was fundamentally wrong. In my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, we lost eight town councils. County Cavan lost councils in Cavan town, Belturbet and Cootehill, and County Monaghan lost Monaghan town, Clones, Castleblayney, Carrickmacross and Ballybay. There were 72 elected members from all parties and none on these councils. They were entrusted by their local communities to make the right local decisions to make their town the best place in which to live, visit, grow up, work and invest.\n\nThis form of local government worked. It was a short-sighted and ill-thought out decision to remove this tier of local democracy and administration. Of course, at the time we did not have as much revenue to spend on public services but this has changed. Now that it has changed, we must reconsider how best to reflect ordinary people's opinions in the democratic decision-making process. It has been my consistent position, and that of Sinn Féin, that the best means of doing this would be through the restoration of town councils.\n\nAt a meeting of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government last May, the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy John Paul Phelan, who is present, addressed the committee on the matter of local government reform. He quoted a published report on municipal governance relating to districts, towns and local electoral areas, which \"sets out a range of proposals to strengthen the current municipal district system within local authorities and to address identified shortcomings rather than re-establish town councils\". He also indicated that stronger powers would be preferred for municipal district members, which would involve strengthening the role and capacity of elected members at municipal district level, particularly in budgetary and local development matters, with financial capacity being of particular importance. These proposals are welcome, as they indicate consideration is at least being given to restoring some powers to municipal areas but I still do not see any impediment whatever to restoring town councils. The boundary changes announced over the summer period complement their restoration. Local people and representatives make the best decisions for their local areas. Fighting for investment, facilities and resources as part of municipal areas and their budgets simply will not deliver the same results.\n\nAs others have said, the Labour Party has done an about-turn on the disastrous and short-sighted decision it made in government. It is now attempting to rectify the disaster by introducing this Bill today. I, for one, welcome this. Ultimately, Fine Gael must do the same and admit a mistake was made. I have made my own mistakes so it is not the worst thing to stand up and be man or woman enough to acknowledge it. The Government should return power to the people and restore town and borough councils at the earliest opportunity. I support this Bill and I welcome it wholeheartedly. I commend it to the House.\n\n\"Phil the Enforcer\", as I described him, and that is what he was. He left ruin after him. The Government, with the Labour Party a part of it, supported him.\n\nDeputy Howlin was a Minister at the time. I described him as being like the high priest because he would not listen to anyone. Deputy Howlin had a close family member who was a senior member of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, AMAI, and consequently, Deputy Howlin, above all should have been best advised as to the fatalities of this measure. However, this was not the case and I do not know what medicine he was trying to dispense to people. In Tipperary, Clonmel was a proud borough council and the Labour Party was founded there. As a result, the Labour Party could not go back there to celebrate when the party's centenary came around, which was a pity. I decried those who objected to the Labour Party. It should have been welcomed back anyway to Clonmel, but to protests and everything else. There is Carrick-on-Suir, as I said, Clonmel, Thurles, Templemore and, indeed, Nenagh, Cashel and Tipperary town. Cashel of the kings has been renowned for centuries. Now the council building, that was only opened a few years beforehand, is locked up to the people. There is not a place to host a civic reception for all kinds of dignitaries who come from far and near.\n\nWe retained the town hall in Clonmel with great difficulty because Mr. MacGrath, the chief executive officer, CEO, of the council - they are not called county managers any more - wanted to close that as well. He gave us a lucky-bag chain of office, while we have a noble chain, worth €50,000, that is locked away in a vault. It is an insult to the town of Clonmel. That is what we have and a lucky-bag would be better. We are in and out to - I was going to say \"fishmongers\" and I might as well - jewellery shops to get it fixed every time it is worn. Those chains of office were a disgrace and those for all the counties were all the same. They diminished and rubbished the people and the dignity of those offices.\n\nAlmost three years ago to the month, I highlighted the necessity of a constitutional challenge to the Local Government Reform Act 2014 as well as the urgent need for a judicial review of the legality of the Act, which led to the eradication of more than 80 town and borough councils throughout the country. It was high-handed in the extreme. We can all talk, as Sinn Féin is talking there now as well. On the last day of that Bill's passage here, I was the only Deputy standing - there were other parties representing - to challenge the then Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, to tell him how fatal it was and that we would be meeting in another forum. The following day, thanks to Former Local Authority Members Éire, FLAME, and former Councillor Niall Dennehy, a former mayor of Clonmel, I served Mr. Hogan with a summons in the Dáil canteen - probably the first ever. Of course, Mr. Hogan was laughing because he knew where he was heading. He did not care about the ordinary people. We are only minions. It was to hell with the people and \"Croppies lie down\", as Cromwell was back in a different guise.\n\nAt the time, the statement provided by Government sources suggested that the merger of Cork County Council was also a solo run by the then Minister, Deputy Kelly. Where is he today? He is not even happy with his Labour Party colleagues. He wants them all gone. He would run the party himself. I told the Labour Party at the time it would come back in a car but they came back in a seven-seater. If they get Deputy Kelly in charge, God knows, I do not where they will end up.\n\nAt the end of 2015, the then Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, properly described the abolition of 80 town councils as his single greatest policy regret in four years of Government. I acknowledge that and fair dues to him for that. It was the worst thing that ever happened. Those comments were then backed at the Labour Party conference by Deputy Kelly. The Deputy was backing Deputy Howlin at that time - now he is snapping at his heels. They wept tears for local government but did nothing to try and reverse that disastrous decision. When they were in government, they could have seen the folly of their way sooner and tried to change it.\n\nIn the intervening years, however, we have had no meaningful political debate about the implications of those admissions by the two then senior Ministers, Deputy Howlin agus An Teachta Kelly. This has, in turn, exposed a chasm of political indifference at the heart of Government concerning the threat to democratic structures in the State. It was absurd for this matter to continually go on without debate and for it to be relegated to the margins of political conversation. I stood here on countless occasions in that four-year period on the Order of Business questioning when the Government would return them but they were all happy to forget about it.\n\nI fully supported the work of FLAME, which, at the time of the so-called Local Government Reform Act, challenged the constitutionality of the decision to axe the councils. It was unconstitutional, as far as I am concerned. FLAME advanced the view that the Act was repugnant to the Constitution, specifically, that it violates Article 28A of the Constitution, and the European Charter of Local Self-Government.\n\nAt a committee earlier, I was talking to the EU representatives celebrating 45 years membership. I note that our Commissioner is due to retire soon. I told them to bring him to another country and not to send him back here, even to stand for any town council because he would not get elected to it. As I stated, the 80 town and borough councils had 744 members. These were decent people working for a pittance. They were the servants of the people on the ground. They were members of the joint policing committees, JPCs. They were able to help An Garda Síochána solve crime. They were able to help with the Tidy Towns competitions. They were able to help with planning matters and many other issues. Most of them did not do it for money. They were committed to better their own places.\n\nAs I said, the Fianna Fáil election manifesto, and indeed, the programme for Government, want to restore those with populations over 7,500. Why is that not being acted on? We are fooling around.\n\nThe Labour Party has suffered seriously over this. There were funds then as well. I have asked questions about that. There were funds in the relative organisations of the members such as the AMAI and others. Where did that money go? I am not saying anybody took it but it was amalgamated and sucked in somewhere.\n\nWe talk about savings. There were no savings. We talked about €5 million in Tipperary with the putting together and although the British could not rule Tipperary when it was such a long county, Big Phil, the enforcer, thought he could push us all in together and we would get €5 million. We got zilch savings and we got anti-democratic decisions. The decisions are being stripped away as late as last week by reserved functions being taken off the members in Clonmel borough districts.\n\nOne would not know is right. I welcome this Bill and hope it will be passed. I am calling on the Minister to withdraw his amendment to allow this Bill to be scrutinised on Committee and Report Stages. Local decisions should be made at local level, as near as possible to the people affected by them. Local government was working well. There was no need to fix it because it was not broken. I have seen at first hand the workings of town and borough councils. I was a member of Clonmel Corporation and Clonmel Borough Council between 1985 and 2004. I served as mayor of Clonmel from 1994 to 1995. Clonmel is a significant and substantial town. It used to be the biggest inland town in the country. Councillors across all political parties, including independent councillors, worked very well on the corporation and the borough council in Clonmel.\n\nCounty Tipperary was very badly hit by the abolition of the councils, which has been a disaster and obviously has failed. I welcome the introduction of this Bill. It is a pity that it has to be introduced, but so be it. County Tipperary lost Clonmel Borough Council and the town councils in Carrick-on-Suir, Cashel, Tipperary, Thurles, Templemore and Nenagh. It is important to get a flavour of these towns, which have been stripped of local representatives and local government. Carrick-on-Suir is known for the only existing manor house of its kind in the country. It was visited by Anne Boleyn, who was the wife of Henry VIII at one stage. Carrick-on-Suir was the home of the first president of the GAA, Maurice Davin. It is the home of Seán Kelly and Sam Bennett. It was the home town of the Clancy brothers.\n\nClonmel, which is the capital of south Tipperary, defeated Cromwell in May 1650 with the help of our northern neighbours, Hugh Dubh O'Neill and his people. The mayor of the day - Mayor White - negotiated a deal with Cromwell that saved the town and its people, and the soldiers who were supporting the town. Clonmel courthouse was the scene of many high-profile sessions, including the trial of the Young Irelanders in 1848. Of course, the Labour Party was established in Clonmel town hall in 1912. Clonmel has been the seat of administration in the south of the county for many years. Musicians like Frank Patterson, Mick Delahunty and Mícheál Ó Súilleabháin came from Clonmel, which is a Quaker town. Charles Bianconi, who was mayor of Clonmel on two occasions, set up his first transport system in the town.\n\nCashel is famous for the Rock of Cashel, which was once the seat of the kings of Munster. Tipperary town is known in Irish as Tiobraid Árann, or the well of Ara, and may be described as the nucleus of the War of Independence. Seán Treacy, Dan Breen, Séamus Robinson and Séan Hogan started the fight for Irish freedom in nearby Soloheadbeg in January 1919. Nenagh, which is the capital of north Tipperary, is a Norman settlement. Nenagh Castle was built in the 13th century. A great-grandfather of mine - Michael Healy, who was a Fenian - was incarcerated in the county jail in Nenagh for some time in 1867. Semple Stadium is in Thurles, which is the birthplace of the GAA.\n\nRoscrea, which is a heritage town, has 600 years of the finest Irish architecture at St. Cronan's cathedral and a Norman castle that dates back to 1280. Cahir is the location of Cahir Castle. I could also mention Templemore. This kind of history gives towns their identity and makes them communities. These towns should not have been stripped of their local government. There is no doubt in my mind that we should restore the town and borough councils as quickly as possible. It appears that the Minister and his Government colleagues, who abolished these councils some years ago with the help of the Labour Party, intend to put this off again. I hope they do not do that. I ask them to withdraw their amendment and to allow this Bill to go forward for scrutiny on Committee and Report Stages.\n\nThe Deputy should not worry about the fox. He is using the ould Meath trick. We know well in Westmeath what he is like. Deputy Munster is feeling the heat from Senator Nash. There is a campaign being led by the local newspaper to ensure Drogheda will have corporation status restored. Ultimately, we should all learn lessons and not be afraid to come in here to apologise. I have great respect for Deputy Ó Caoláin. Former Senator Máiría Cahill is looking for acknowledgment on various issues. Perhaps if they adopted the same position as Deputy Howlin, regarding where we have made a mess in abolishing town councils, it might be useful. Let us be clear that we did make a mess and regret it. One could not say, however, that town councils in which one could get elected by 50 people were worthy of retaining. There should have been reform rather than abolition. Let us be clear and call a spade a spade. I know of some of the town councils in question. Let us all grow up here. Let us not always fly off the handle over nothing. Let us deal with this in a critical, cool-headed way. We made a mistake and are in here apologising for it. I am delighted with the support coming from all quarters. We feel this Bill could probably be improved and put together with the Fianna Fáil Bill, brought forward and put into the committee. It was the colleague of the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, who led the charge. I was not there at the time. I was not even a member of the Labour Party. I did not have the Whip when this happened but I still assume responsibility, unlike some, because I was a Member of the House. I suppose I could have spoken out with greater clarity against the proposal.\n\nWe are now proposing that every town with a population of more than 5,000 and at least 1,000 dwellings, and with a clearly defined urban centre, should have its town council restored. In other words, there is critical mass. There should be nine councillors elected from one electoral area, but if the town is larger, as in where Deputy Lawless represents, there should be 15. This could be changed or reconsidered, of course. Deputy Cassells's idea may well be better. Let us bring the two ideas together. Let us not be afraid of this. Other Deputies, including Deputy Ó Caoláin, have other points of view. The central point is that the town would elect its own councillors to serve the needs of the town. People feel remote from their public representatives at present. The proposal would remedy this. Councils would have the ability to set their own rates. They could be lower or higher than those set by the county council.\n\nThe restoration of the town councils for Mullingar, Athlone and Longford would enable them to be in control of their own development plans, budgets, planning applications and finances. In Mullingar, the town council could promote the local industrial park at Marlinstown, which has 27 ha, so it could be sure to get an industry there. It is centrally located, well appointed, has planning permission and three-phase electricity, yet IDA Ireland has failed to secure an industry for the area. We could do more. Athlone and Mullingar both have well over 20,000 people, heading towards 25,000. Longford has 10,000. All of those areas would qualify. That is important.\n\nThe decision to abolish councils in wholesale fashion was stupid, driven by a false narrative that abolition would lead to significant savings. What happened as a result was that the reduction in the number of local public representatives, who are the fulcrum of representative democracy, just heaped work and pressure on a smaller number of public representatives, many of whom were not local to the area to be represented and who had to carry an extra load with no pay. The pay is absolutely useless. Let us call a spade a spade: the big problem we will face in the coming years is trying to get people to actually run for those offices. We bow to the lowest common denominator. Someone in the media makes a point about public representatives and we immediately rush in. We in this House are kings and queens of it. We condemn every public representative and lacerate ourselves in here. I have seen it. The deterioration over 26 years is frightening. When I came in here first, we respected one another. We had our political arguments, no more than the way in which I might now disagree with Deputies Cassells or Ó Caoláin, but ultimately there was respect. If we do not have respect for one another, we should not expect anyone outside to have respect for us. One might think one is gaining the upper hand by some snide or glib remark but one is only playing to the gallery and denigrating one's fellow representatives. We should argue the political toss vehemently and strongly but we are all colleagues, and I am sure we are in politics for the best motives – 99.9% of the people I have served with were always motivated by public service and I was proud to be one of their own. After the next election, I clearly will not be but I will be proud to leave and say I was part of that House and that it was a great honour. We should not run around denigrating one another because it is only fuel for somebody else to continue the denigration.\n\nIn the last week I have heard stories from across Ireland on the impact of the loss of the town council and why it should be reintroduced. Mr. Liam van der Spek, our representative in Cavan, is urgently seeking the restoration of his town council. He told me that Cavan town, with its population of more than 10,000, has been noticeably underdeveloped since losing its town council. The main streets and housing estates are suffering. The town has been dropped from the top spots in the league of Irish Business Against Litter. Owing to the lack of representation, Mr. van der Spek doubts the town could now host the Fleadh Cheoil like it did in 2010. I was very proud to be at Cavan's three fleánna, bearing in mind that I am a great Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann man, as most people know. It would be difficult to attract such events now because all towns want them. We are spending €3 million in Mullingar and hope to get the Fleadh Cheoil in 2020 and 2021 because it was founded in Mullingar. We want it in Mullingar for the 70th anniversary. Let that go out to everyone, including Deputy Howlin, who is seeking to have it in Wexford.\n\nMr. Ian McGahon from Bray, County Wicklow, told me the town has lost direct decision-making powers on housing and planning as well as direct finance and budgets. Towns have lost out greatly because of the 2014 legislation.\n\nMr. Seamus Ryan from Ennis, County Clare, told me communities took pride in having their local councils for their towns, and that the councils were a vital avenue for advocacy for people in small communities across the entirety of the country and they gave people a local focal point. People are being badly represented because of the changes introduced in the municipal districts, where it can literally take hours to cross from one end to the other. Ennis, a town of 26,000, effectively has three councillors as the other five are all rural. Shannon, which has a population of 13,000, has one councillor from the town. This shows the imbalance that can arise. I mean no disrespect to the rural councillors. They are fighting tooth and nail. Every councillor is travelling miles and getting damn-all for it. I was a rural councillor myself, in an area 12 or 14 miles from Mullingar. I was representing rural areas but the councillors elected in Mullingar knew intimately every pothole, ditch, hedgerow, light, pavement and manhole cover. I could not know those. This is where it all fell down. We need to give back a voice to the councillors and not be afraid to do so.\n\nMr. Aaron Byrne from Kells, County Meath, is a neighbour of Deputy Cassells. Mr. Byrne told me the removal of the town councils has created a deficit of representation for people in smaller towns and villages around the country. In his area there are three towns - Kells, Athboy and Oldcastle, which neighbours my county - that have all lost town councils and are now represented at county level by the shared seven councillors. This means seven voices among 40 on Meath County Council fighting for resources for three towns in a large municipal district. Kells is listed in the county development plan as having only a support function to Navan, which is in a different municipal district. As a result, there are seven councillors trying to vie for funding across a huge area of the county against seven councillors specifically elected to serve Navan town, backed up by a county development plan. That is the type of imbalance that happens because of the structure. While I might represent Mullingar and Deputy Cassells represents Navan, we represent everyone but it is important that the large towns have representatives. Kells needs representatives who can prioritise the needs of Kells and focus on developing the town and hinterlands in their own right and not as supporting entities of larger towns in the county.\n\nMr. Johnny Walsh from Ballinasloe, County Galway, listed eight reasons a town council is needed in the town. First, the town could set its own commercial rates, which were 30% lower than the county rate. The increase is hitting the town hard. Second, it would restore personal contact with local council officials instead of people having to travel 40 miles to the nearest office. Third, it would reconnect the general public in our towns with the political process, which is important. Fourth, it would restore budgetary, planning and housing functions to our town, giving people local control. Fifth, it would restore the discretionary community fund in respect of which the town council had the relevant local knowledge for allocating money to projects that needed it. Sixth, it would ensure proper services for people in the town for council housing maintenance and the upkeep of council green areas. Seventh, the previous town council had an affordable council rent scheme but the county council scheme is a more expensive scheme for tenants, even if there is no increase in their income. Eighth, it would restore a sense of civic pride in that the town would have its own local mayor to officiate at important local events.\n\nAs the Minister of State can see across the State, people who care about their towns want the opportunity to make their urban areas better. Their specific concerns are getting lost. Diversity is essential. It allows towns to experiment with new ways of doing things, to try out new projects and specialise based on the attributes they have. It gives towns a voice – a voice they now lack. I support the returning of those voices to the local councils.\n\nI know, and that is absolutely outrageous. However, I am changing that. There is a committee, which will have legislation shortly on how Members of the Seanad should be elected in the future.\n\nI wish to deal with other specific issues. Members spoke about this Bill being cost neutral. It is not cost neutral. Deputy Howlin spoke about 100 towns with a population of 5,000 or more. Interestingly, Deputies Butler and Aindrias Moynihan said they were supporting the Bill because it would bring back Lismore Town Council and Macroom Town Council. Those two towns are far below the population threshold of 5,000 so perhaps they should have read the Bill before they contributed.\n\nI believe the reason Deputy Cassells's legislation, which was passed by the House, has not been discussed since then is that there was a report due before the Cabinet on local government and local leadership. That was approved by the Cabinet. I find it frustrating, as the spare leg in the Custom House who is not directly involved in housing, that most of the issues discussed by the housing committee relate to housing, which is natural given that it is the biggest national issue at present. It is difficult to get time to discuss local government matters. I would prefer if there was a separate local government committee, and most Members here have served on local authorities, or if there was a subgroup of the joint committee to examine local government. We could have a proper and full discussion there, without shouting at each other, as to how we wish town councils, county councils and local authorities to progress in the future.\n\nDeputy Browne said there were no savings. There have been savings. Some €21 million was saved following the mergers of Tipperary, Waterford and Limerick local authorities and between €18 million and €20 million was saved through the abolition of town councils. It is not necessarily a huge amount but it is untrue to say no savings were made. I was struck by Deputy Cassells's comment that there was an anti-town attitude in county councils across the country. Perhaps that is the case in Meath but I never encountered it. Perhaps Kilkenny was unique. There was one urban centre and everything else around the county was much smaller but there was never a sense of anti-urbanism.\n\nFianna Fáil's deputy leader, a man for whom I have great respect, made a strange contribution in which he spoke about his ancestors being town engineers. He let the mask slip a little when he said Fine Gael never did well on town councils and was always opposed to them, the corollary being that Fianna Fáil always did well on them. I do not believe that this is behind Deputy Howlin's contribution or behind most of the contributions to the debate but there is an element of patronage involved in town councils. It offers a role for local party activists, who can be paid by the rate payer or the property tax payer, to become involved in the political activities of an organisation or as an independent in seeking election. I got a strong whiff of that from Deputy Calleary's contribution, which is unusual for him.\n\nThere was nothing much from Deputy O'Loughlin. Deputy Murphy O'Mahony spoke about town councils being the bottom rung of the ladder and said that people could stand for further elections after being on town councils. They did serve that function to an extent but that is not necessarily a good enough reason for them to exist in the future.\n\nWith regard to Drogheda, it is in the same boat as my own part of the world in Kilkenny where the borough council was abolished. The new Drogheda borough district was drawn up and most Members who contributed to the debate have acknowledged that the recent review of local electoral areas has made an attempt to make them more manageable geographically. It has also made an attempt to make them more manageable in terms of the focus on towns. Deputy Howlin has spoken to me several times about Wexford town. The new Wexford borough district corresponds to Wexford town and its immediate hinterland. My local town-----\n\nI thank everybody who contributed to this debate. This being Private Members' business, the Bill has had one of the largest number of Members contributing that I can remember in recent times. Everybody in the House has an affinity to the democratic system. We all strive in our own ways to try to make it better. There have been various attempts to do so, including by me during my tenure more than two decades ago in the Custom House when I produced the Better Local Government plan. The idea then was not only to strengthen local government but to link it to community activity for the first time. There was great resistance to the notion that unelected community groups should be involved in strategic policy committees and in shaping policy, although the majority of every committee would be, of course, the elected members.\n\nThe former Minister, Phil Hogan, also produced plans, in respect of which I do not attribute any malice to him. There have been various contributions to this debate, most of which were very constructive and measured. There are some Members from whom one never expects anything more than vitriol and they never disappoint. I am taken aback by the ungraciousness and lack of generosity in the comments of Deputy Cassells. It is important for politicians to recognise that mistakes were made and to come into this House and say that and to change their minds. As I said in my opening contribution, up to last night I had spent three days in Liverpool trying to persuade the British people to think again about what I believe is a grievous mistake in Brexit. We must have the ability to say that we should think again on the basis of how things work out. Whatever the merits people argued for a more integrated type of local government, it has not worked.\n\nI would like to make a couple of points on the contributions of the Ministers of State, Deputies English and Phelan. The Minister of State, Deputy English, said that the municipal system is working. It is not, although I acknowledge that the revised boundaries will improve matters. We all know our own areas best. The new municipal district of Wexford, which is essentially Wexford town and its immediate environs, will be immeasurably better than the old one which encompassed one-quarter of the county because as people from Kilmore Quay to Rosslare Harbour had no affinity to the town and mayors elected from those areas had no urban tradition, it did sunder the district. There needs to be an urban driver. While I acknowledge that an attempt has been made in the new boundaries to bring about improvements, I believe we need to have a stand-alone urban council and not one that is merely a sub-committee of the greater county council, which is what it is now.\n\nI am anxious to have this Bill enacted and I am determined to ensure it proceeds. I acknowledge the campaigning work of Deputy Cassells on the issue but his Bill did not seek to create the new councils. If this Bill is passed new councils will be created. Deputy Cassells's Bill sought to create a process that would consider the creation of the councils, which was welcome and we supported it. There will be a lot of work to be done on this Bill on Committee Stage if it passes Second Stage. I would like to see this legislation in place in time for the next local elections. This is not an impossible task. The Minister of State, Deputy English, also said that the Government proposes to commission another report on the issue, but that will probably be subject to a further report. This is not the way to deal with this critical issue. We want a debate. If the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, wants a debate then let us set aside a Friday or a Monday for a full debate on local government issues. I would be delighted to map out my own time to contribute to such debate and I am sure all Deputies who spoke this evening would do likewise.\n\nOn the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, I think the Minister will regret talking about the patronage issue. I believe that was unfortunate."
