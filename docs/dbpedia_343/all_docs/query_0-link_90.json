        "text": "Ongoing contact through correspondence and meetings at ministerial, official and expert level is being maintained with the UK authorities regarding a range of issues in regard to the Sellafield nuclear plant. These contacts are productive and reflect an increasing recognition by the UK Government of the serious concerns held by the Irish Government in regard to Sellafield. There remains, however, a significant difference of views between the Irish and UK Governments regarding the continued operation of Sellafield.\n\nIn accordance with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, our policy is to bring about the safe closure of Sellafield. This is based on our concerns in relation to the potential hazards arising from a nuclear accident or incident, the impacts of radioactive discharges on the marine environment, concerns about the generation, management and disposal of radioactive waste and the risk posed by the associated transport of radioactive materials through the Irish Sea. The UK response to these concerns is that radioactive discharges from Sellafield pose no threat to human health or the environment, the Sellafield plant and related transports are safe and secure, and the legacy wastes arising from the UK's nuclear programmes are being addressed through the establishment of the Nuclear Decommissioning Agency, NDA.\n\nThe provisional measures award and orders of the UNCLOS tribunal of 24 June 2003 and 14 November 2003 recommended that Ireland and the UK enter into dialogue to improve co-operation and consultation between the two Governments and report to the tribunal on specified dates. Complex discussions, confidential to the tribunal and the parties pending outcomes, are at present continuing, in line with the obligation on both parties to improve co-operation and co-ordination arrangements. It is my intention to report on progress arising from this process in due course.\n\nAs well as contacts with ministerial colleagues, my officials and scientific experts from the RPII continue to meet their UK counterparts on a regular basis during which Ireland's concerns regarding operations at Sellafield are raised. Such contacts continue to be productive. However, there remains a significant difference of views in relation to operations at Sellafield. The UK response to concerns raised by Ireland is that operations at Sellafield are safe and do not adversely impact on the environment. This Government holds a significantly different view and has at every opportunity expressed these views directly to the UK Government and its relevant authorities at all levels. The Government will not hesitate to explore further options in relation to Sellafield as they become available.\n\nI intend to continue to highlight Ireland's concerns on Sellafield and the nuclear industry generally to my UK ministerial counterparts.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 62, 95, and 99 together.\n\nAs members of the House will be aware, the clear policy direction of the Government is set out in two policy statements, the 1998 Waste Management: Changing Our Ways, and the 2002 Preventing and Recycling Waste: Delivering Change, and has been updated in this year's Taking Stock and Moving Forward statement.\n\nThermal treatment with energy recovery has an important role to play as one element of the Government's integrated approach to waste management. This approach is firmly grounded on the internationally accepted hierarchy which places the most emphasis on waste prevention and minimisation, followed by re-use, recycling and energy recovery, so as to leave the least possible residual amount for disposal to landfill.\n\nThose European countries which are recognised as among the most environmentally advanced, such as the Netherlands and Germany, combine high rates of recycling with the extensive use of modern, highly regulated thermal treatment facilities.\n\nThis integrated waste management policy is underpinned, and was foreseen, by the Waste Management Act 1996 introduced by the then Minister for Environment and Local Government, Deputy Howlin. Consistent with this, Fine Gael has until recently, accepted thermal treatment \"as an integral part of a waste management strategy .... properly located, operated and monitored high-temperature incineration can be consistently operated ... with no significant pollution.\"\n\nThe Government has ambitious targets for waste management by 2013 including: diversion of 50% of household waste from landfill; recycling 35% of municipal waste; and 85% recycling of construction and demolition waste. We have made major progress in the last few years including: recycling 21% of municipal waste in 2002, which is up from 13% in 2001; a significant slow down in municipal waste growth to less than 1% in 2002 with a 4% drop in waste going to landfill; and a 25% increase in material being accepted at local authority recycling centres.\n\nHowever, even when we meet our targets for diverting waste from landfill it is likely that we will still have to treat up to 1.7 million tonnes of municipal waste per annum. The provision of a suitable network of thermal treatment plants will significantly reduce the waste we will have to landfill and lower our dependence on the most unsustainable waste option. Regarding hazardous waste, our heavy reliance on the export of hazardous waste has been recognised as a potentially serious deterrent to future industrial development in Ireland. All these factors have informed Ireland's waste management policy, and if the Deputies opposite were honest, they would accept this position.\n\nThere has been some mis-reporting surrounding the health effects of thermal treatment and their consideration in the environmental licensing process. The EPA may not grant a waste licence unless it is satisfied that the activity concerned, carried on in accordance with the licence conditions, will not cause environmental pollution. The agency operates to highest EU and WHO standards.\n\nThe EPA takes the view that if the licensed emission limits are complied with, then human health is protected in line with best international practice. I would like to take this opportunity to reject the recent comments of Deputy O'Dowd regarding the EPA's consideration of health effects. In this regard, I received yesterday a letter from the director general of the agency on the matter which I will be pleased to forward to interested Deputies.\n\nIn relation to the Health Research Board study, the preparation by my Department and the Department of Health and Children, of a response to this desk-based research has taken longer than originally anticipated. The delay arose due to the need to also consider a more recently published report by the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on the Review of Environmental and Health Effects of Waste Management. This study looked at cancer, respiratory diseases and birth defects and found no evidence for a link between the incidence of the diseases and the current generation of incinerators.\n\nIt is often forgotten that nine hazardous waste incinerators are already in operation in Ireland. The EPA estimates that these have contributed a fraction of 1% of national dioxin emissions to air. Even assuming that 1 million tonnes of municipal waste might be managed by way of incineration in 2010, the report projects that dioxin emissions from waste incineration would account for less than 2% of total dioxin emissions to air.\n\nI am aware of the concerns of local communities regarding the development of thermal treatment and other major waste management facilities. I will do all that is possible to assuage these concerns. In particular, I will examine best practice in ongoing environmental monitoring of such projects including, in particular, ensuring that the local community is involved in overseeing such monitoring.\n\nIt would be premature to comment in detail on the relevant opinion of the Advocate General, given the further consideration which must be given to this matter by the European Court. However, I intend that the opinion will be carefully assessed and where gaps have been identified in our current control regime these will be urgently rectified. Nevertheless, it must be stressed that this case relates to past activities and, in the interim, substantial advances have been made in the statutory provisions governing waste management in Ireland, and their enforcement.\n\nThe Waste Management Act 1996, as amended by the Waste Management (Amendment) Act 2001 and the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, along with a range of supporting regulations, have brought the law in relation to waste into line with best European practice. The licensing regime operated by the EPA has also significantly evolved and over 160 waste licences have been issued by the agency to date. The provision of modernised waste infrastructure and services, all fully licensed, is continuing at an accelerated pace.\n\nA comprehensive review of waste management policy, Taking Stock and Moving Forward, issued in April 2004, demonstrated considerable advances in the provision of waste services between 2001 and 2003, for example, the number of bring banks increased from 1,400 to 1,700, and the number of civic amenity sites increased from 46 to 61 and the position regarding licensed landfill capacity also showed improvement.\n\nI regard enforcement as a key element in making further progress. This objective is being advanced in a number of ways. There has been considerable strengthening of enforcement powers and penalties under the Protection of the Environment Act 2003. Some €7 million has been allocated for the first year of a major five-year campaign of waste enforcement activity with the objective of supporting and enhancing local authority enforcement activity. The Office of Environmental Enforcement, OEE, has been established and has in turn established a national enforcement network to ensure a consistent standard of enforcement quality and evenness of activity across local authorities. The OEE has recently engaged consultants to conduct a study of unauthorised waste activities, which will include establishing the extent of unauthorised activities, a review of current procedures and the development of guidance on investigation of unauthorised activity.\n\nI intend to continue to place major emphasis on ensuring further progress, including any further measures which may prove necessary in response to the prospective judgment of the European Court.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 58 together.\n\nTackling environmental crime, including Illegal waste activity, demands the highest priority. While such enforcement is a matter for the local authorities and the office of environmental enforcement, I am determined to ensure that they actively use the legislative framework and resources now in place. Very significant powers are available to local authorities under the Waste Management Act 1996 to enable them to tackle illegal waste activity, and they were further strengthened by the Protection of the Environment Act 2003. They are empowered to order measures to be taken in relation to the disposal of waste, including the remediation of any effects arising from illegal activities. They may directly take appropriate actions to remedy or counteract such activities and to recover their costs through the courts. They also have substantial powers to halt vehicles, inspect premises and examine records. Maximum penalties of €15 million and-or a ten year sentence attaching to illegal waste activities are also substantial.\n\nTo assist local authorities in acting on these powers some €7 million has been allocated from the environment fund to directly support a more vigorous approach to environmental enforcement, with a particular emphasis on combating dumping and other unauthorised waste activities. This is now being reflected in the presence of additional enforcement personnel on the ground.\n\nI have met the director general of the Environmental Protection Agency, within which the OEE is located, and have stressed the importance I attach to its work. The office is well placed to mobilise a co-ordinated national response across all local authorities to what is a national priority. Those involved in environmental crime do not respect local authority boundaries or national frontiers and our response to them must be as comprehensive and sophisticated as possible.\n\nI am particularly concerned to ensure that detected illegal landfills are dealt with to the highest environmental standards. My Department is developing guidelines on best practice in this regard in consultation with the OEE. I intend shortly to issue these as policy directions under the power available to me in the Waste Management Acts.\n\nIn addition, a comprehensive study has been commissioned by the OEE to establish and document the extent of unauthorised waste activities in Ireland. Among the objectives of the project are to review and document current procedures and practices used by the relevant authorities to investigate unauthorised waste activities, as well as the use of powers available to tackle unauthorised activities. I will carefully consider the results of this study to identify any further actions that may be necessary in consequence of its findings.\n\nThe OEE has also established a working group on unauthorised waste, including representatives of the local authorities and my Department, whose functions include co-ordination of enforcement actions against companies and individuals involved in the illegal movement and disposal of waste in Ireland. I am fully supporting this more integrated approach to enforcement.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 52 and 103 together.\n\nThe primary role of the local authorities in response to flooding is to ensure public safety and all initial efforts are, therefore, directed to saving life and preventing injuries. Where possible, the local authorities also assist in the protection of property.\n\nMy Department's primary concern is to ensure that, when adverse conditions arise, the local authorities are geared to respond promptly and effectively to help offset the worst effects of these conditions. My Department issues a circular annually reminding local authorities of the need to revise and update, as necessary, their contingency plans for dealing with the consequences of severe weather conditions. This includes arrangements to take necessary action arising from early warnings from Met Éireann, the necessity to be proactive as regards public relations and information, and availability of equipment and stocks.\n\nArising from the work of the interdepartmental committee on major emergencies, IDC, following the November 2000 flooding my Department issued a questionnaire to the main local authorities, city and county councils in February 2003 seeking information in relation to plans and arrangements that they had in place to deal with severe weather emergencies. From the replies received at that time, it is clear that all local authorities have plans in place for dealing with flooding and have worked to put relevant recommendations of the IDC into effect. This means that emergency response personnel have equipment and stocks, for example, pumps, sandbags, etc. available to assist local communities in flooding situations and that the local authorities have arrangements in place for issuing accurate and timely information to the public, public representatives and the local media. From information received in relation to the recent flooding incidents, it is clear that these plans were fully deployed in the affected areas.\n\nMy Department has no direct role in relation to flood damage and compensation for householders or others who suffer losses as a result of flooding. The Office of Public Works has primary responsibility for devising and implementing such flood relief measures.\n\nNeither are there any funds available to the Department specifically to meet expenditure incurred by local authorities due to flooding. However, funding provided to local authorities in respect of non-national roads takes account of the need to address such incidents. Also, local authorities can, where necessary, provide emergency short-term accommodation for persons made homeless as a result of disasters such as flooding. My Department recoups 90% of the cost of providing such accommodation.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 30, 35, 92, and 102 together.\n\nThe exposure of workers in Ireland to radon gas in the workplace is subject to regulatory control set out in the Radiological Protection Act 1991 (Ionising Radiation) Order 2000. This order implements the 1996 EU basic safety standards directive laying down standards for the protection of workers and the general public from exposure to ionising radiation. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, is responsible for its enforcement in Ireland.\n\nThe order specifies a radon concentration reference level for workplaces of 400 becquerels per cubic metre, Bq/m3, averaged over a minimum period of three months. Under the order, employers are required to carry out radon measurements of their workplaces when directed to do so by the RPII. Where workplaces are found to have concentrations greater than the reference level, employers must evaluate whether remedial action to reduce the radon concentration to less than 400 Bq/m3 is justified.\n\nThe radon concentration reference level for workplaces in Ireland is consistent with that set in many other EU states, including the UK, Sweden, Finland and Denmark. This reference level is lower than that set in other EU states such as Greece, Italy, Hungary and the Czech Republic where the reference levels range from 500 to 1000 Bq/m3. The Irish reference level is also lower than that suggested by other international bodies such as the International Commission for Radiological Protection.\n\nThe RPII is satisfied that the current reference level is appropriate and consistent with best international practice and has no plans to bring forward recommendations for its change. The RPII estimates that approximately 150 to 200 deaths per annum are attributable to radon gas, whereas about 7,000 deaths in Ireland each year are attributable to tobacco related illness.\n\nMy Department understands that there are no statistics that specifically compare the risks of passive smoking and radon gas exposure. However, when radon gas is detected, ventilation and remediation measures can significantly mitigate any detrimental effects of the gas.\n\nUnder the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, employers are required to identify hazards arising in the workplace, assess the risks arising from those hazards and put in place measures to eliminate or control the risks which arise. The Health and Safety Authority has stated that, under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, all indoor workplaces in high radon areas must have radon measurements carried out.\n\nUnder the order made in 2000, the RPII has powers to direct employers or self-employed person responsible for workplaces falling within the scope of the order to carry out radon measurements. On receipt of a direction, an employer or self-employed person has six months to comply with the direction and carry out a radon measurement. There are currently three radon measurement laboratories approved under the order of 2000 to carry out radon measurements in workplaces. Of these the RPII is the largest.\n\nDuring 2001 and 2002 the RPII issued some 3,000 directions to employers in Tralee and Ennis. Both these areas had been identified in previous surveys as being located in a high radon area. However, the response to these directions was disappointing when only 408 employers carried out radon measurements. The RPII have again directed some of these employers to carry out radon measurements.\n\nEmployers were given six months to respond to the directives and this period elapses in December 2004 and January 2005. After this period the RPII expects to seek prosecutions against those employers who have failed to comply with the direction to carry out a radon measurement.\n\nThe RPII is working closely with the State Claims Agency on its efforts to promote awareness of radon among State employers. An initiative was launched in January this year entitled Radon Risk in State Buildings initiative. State employers have reacted positively to this initiative, and many State employers have either completed or are currently carrying out radon measurements either with the RPII or one of the other approved radon measurement laboratories.\n\nTo date, the RPII has carried out radon measurements on behalf of the Department of Education and Science in over 4,500 schools and other workplaces in the country. For those workplaces where high levels are found the RPII is satisfied that measures are being applied to reduce the radon concentrations in accordance with the legislation.\n\nBoth the Health and Safety Authority and the RPII take measures to inform employers and the public about radon gas. The RPII will be holding the third in a series of national radon fora in Dublin in November to raise awareness of radon as a health risk. Both the RPII and my Department will continue to use appropriate opportunities to raise public awareness of radon and to implement the provisions of the order working closely in harmony with the Health and Safety Authority.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 34, 101 and 216 together.\n\nThe Better Local Government modernisation programme has brought significant benefits to local government. These include: constitutional recognition and guaranteed local elections; enhanced levels of funding; strengthened political and management structures; and an updated legal framework as well as an efficiency agenda focused on improved corporate planning, IT, human resources and customer service. Updated financial management systems, facilitating better financial management and planning, have also been introduced, and a new initiative to improve service standards with an extended range of performance indicators was launched this year.\n\nLocal government modernisation also provides an enhanced role for elected members in local authority policy formulation and review, in partnership with representatives of the social partners, through the establishment of strategic policy committees, SPCs. I intend to assist the spread of best practice in respect of SPCs through provision of policy focused training for elected members when the current strand of induction training for new councillors is completed. I will also be stressing the importance of executive policy support for the committees in my discussions with local authority management.\n\nThe role of the locally elected representative has been further strengthened by the creation of a single mandate for councillors from the recent local elections and also by the improved financial support framework and better training-information opportunities. Additionally, local authorities have a lead role and wider sphere of influence in the county-city development board system aimed at a more integrated approach to economic, social and cultural development. The CDBs allow elected members a direct input into the services provided by other public bodies at local level.\n\nA number of initiatives, implemented as part of the modernisation programme, are specifically centred on improved service provision. These include, for example: the decentralisation of services by local authorities to area level with €31 million in support from my Department for a one-stop-shop programme; substantial investment in e-local government, including €9.8 million from my Department under the initiatives fund focused on the use of technology to improve efficiency and effectiveness in service delivery, particularly in an on-line context; and the requirement on local authorities to produce customer action plans.\n\nIn addition, as part of quality customer service, local authorities have progressively taken action, as the opportunity has arisen, to provide better facilities for private discussions with customers. This has been particularly so where local authorities are replacing or modernising their offices or decentralising their services to the local area level through one-stop-shops.\n\nMy predecessor established a customer services group in May 2003 with the objective of developing and improving customer service across the local government sector. Arising from the group's work local authorities are obliged from 2004 onwards publicly to report their performance against 42 service indicators across their principal functions. I believe that councillors, as the boards of directors of local authorities, have a central and pivotal role in making this initiative work. They will be able to compare the performance of their authority vis-à-vis other local authorities and ensure that necessary corrective actions are taken in good time. The customer services group will also shortly begin preparing guidelines for local authorities on customer surveys, customer consultation, complaints, appeals and redress systems. These guidelines, which will be presented to me in the new year, will take account of best practice, including relevant guidance issued by the Ombudsman.\n\nIt is my aim, over the lifetime of the Government, to build on progress to date and, in particular, to promote improvements in performance and in service delivery by local authorities to their communities.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 69, 83, 97 and 107 together.\n\nIn accordance with normal practice, the Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Rural Housing, published on 4 March 2004, were issued in draft form to give all those interested an opportunity to comment before the guidelines are finalised in statutory form. Submissions in relation to the draft guidelines were to be submitted to my Department by 30 April 2004. In view of the importance of the rural housing issue, my predecessor requested planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála to have regard to the draft guidelines with effect from their date of publication. The guidelines are a material consideration both in relation to development plans and in the consideration of planning applications. Planning authorities are required to review and vary their development plans, where necessary, to ensure that their policies on rural settlement are consistent with the policies set out in the guidelines.\n\nA total of 105 submissions in relation to the draft guidelines have been received by my Department from interested organisations and individuals. The submissions have been examined in detail by my Department. I intend to carefully consider any suggestions for clarifying or improving the guidelines before they are finalised. It is my intention that the guidelines will be issued in their final statutory form by the end of this year.\n\nI do not have any specific plans at this time to meet An Taisce in relation to the issue of rural housing. My Department received a submission on the draft guidelines from An Taisce which will be considered along with all other submissions received. The CSO's planning permission quarterly statistical release has included information on the number of permissions granted for one-off houses since the second quarter of 2002. My Department does not collect statistics on the total numbers of planning applications for one-off housing received by planning authorities nor on the number of such applications which are refused permission. However, last year a sample of planning authorities were contacted by the Department and asked to provide information on the numbers of decisions in 2002 on rural housing applications and the percentage of these decisions that were granted or refused. The information provided by the planning authorities sampled was as follows: on average 75% of applications for single rural houses made to the planning authorities surveyed were granted, the highest grant rates were in the westernmost planning authorities with grant rates falling somewhat in the more urbanised areas to the east; most planning authorities in the western half of the country grant around four out of five applications; and where permission is refused, the reasons for refusal generally relate to issues such as traffic safety, public health or protection of the natural and cultural heritage.\n\nMy Department is currently considering ways of developing a detailed statistical database to assist policy development and monitoring of trends in relation to rural housing.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 96 together.\n\nThe Government has responded actively to the increased level of social housing need by expanding social and affordable housing output significantly. Spending on housing has increased substantially in recent years, with capital spending in 2004 at four times the 1998 level. The focus of the Government's spending on housing is on responding to the needs of low income groups and those with social and special housing needs through a broad range of targeted initiatives. It is anticipated that through these measures the needs of over 13,000 households will be met in 2004, compared with some 8,500 households in 2000. This includes over 10,000 households assisted through various forms of social rented accommodation, involving new local authority and voluntary and co-operative housing and vacancies arising in existing local authority houses.\n\nThe Government is committed to the continued expansion of the social rented housing stock through local authority and voluntary and co-operative housing. The decision to introduce five-year multi-annual capital investment programmes provides an important opportunity to ensure a structured basis for the planning and delivery of all social and affordable housing programmes. Consequently, to maximise the benefits of this multi-annual approach, local authorities have been requested to prepare five-year social and affordable housing action plans for the period 2004 to 2008.\n\nThe main objective in developing these action plans is the need to ensure that the investment available for these programmes achieves the desired effect in the long term by tackling real need and breaking cycles of disadvantage and dependency having regard to the funding available under the five-year multi-annual capital envelopes. The Department is currently assessing the draft action plans submitted by the local authorities with a view to finalising them by the end of the year.\n\nThe expanded social and affordable housing provision over recent years has had a beneficial impact on the social rented housing stock. Returns from local authorities would indicate that the number of occupied local authority dwellings has increased in recent years. The number of occupied local authority dwellings at end 2003 was in the order of 105,000, compared with over 99,200 at the end of 1998. Having regard to activity on the tenant purchase scheme over the past four years, an average of 1,500 units are required each year to replace units disposed of through the scheme.\n\nThe Government is firmly committed to ensuring that all measures agreed at EU level are transposed within the timeframe agreed at the Council of Ministers and implemented correctly. I am keenly aware of the importance of timely transposition and effective implementation of EU environmental legislation. Some 200 pieces of EU environmental legislation, including more than 140 directives, have by now been transposed.\n\nThere are currently five outstanding directives in my Department's area of responsibility which have yet to be transposed. These include, Directive 2003/53/EC relating to end-of-life vehicles, ELVs, which contains two stages of transposition, the first by 21 April 2002, for new vehicles sold after 1 July 2002, and the second by January 2007, for all other vehicles. There have been difficulties in reaching agreement with the motor industry on ELV take-back arrangements required by the directive. However written agreement was recently reached on a scheme to provide for free take-back of all end of life vehicles from 1 March 2005, some 22 months ahead of the 2007 deadline. It is intended that the directive will be transposed in the first quarter of 2005.\n\nAnother Directive 2002/49/EC relates to the assessment and management of environmental noise. Drafting of regulations to transpose this directive is well advanced and transposition is intended in early 2005.\n\nA further Directive 2002/88/EC relates to measures against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from internal combustion engines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery. Draft regulations are nearing completion with a view to circulation to relevant bodies for observations prior to the year-end. It is intended that the directive will be transposed in the first quarter of 2005.\n\nTwo further related Directives 2002/95/EC and 2002/96/EC, respectively, concern restrictions on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment and arrangements for dealing with waste electrical and electronic equipment. Legislative proposals approved by Government for the transposition of both directives are now in drafting.\n\nI intend to give a high priority to completing work on the transposition of directives as rapidly as possible, and to improving national enforcement arrangements, in particular through supporting the work of the office of environmental enforcement, OEE, within the EPA. The main functions of the OEE include improving overall compliance with environmental protection legislation, auditing and reporting on the performance of local authorities in the discharge of their environmental protection functions and taking action, where necessary, and prosecuting, or assisting local authorities to prosecute, significant breaches of environmental legislation in a timely manner.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 53 together.\n\nDuring its EU Presidency, Ireland was actively involved in seeking to develop a sound consensus in the European Council's atomic questions working group on two proposed directives, one relating to safety of nuclear installations and the other to the safe management of spent fuel and radioactive waste. In the event, because a blocking minority of states opposed the principle of a legal instrument and, despite intensive efforts by the Irish Presidency, it was not possible to secure a consensus in the working group for adoption of the directives.\n\nHowever, the Council of the European Union, at a meeting on 28 June 2004 under the Irish Presidency, adopted conclusions on nuclear safety and on the safety of the management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste. These conclusions reaffirmed the commitment of the Community and its member states to a high level of nuclear safety and to the safe management of spent fuel and radioactive waste.\n\nWhile the EURATOM Treaty, already envisages the promotion of nuclear energy, Ireland seeks to avail of all opportunities at EU level to steer EURATOM activities in the direction of nuclear safety and radiological protection and away from expansion of the nuclear industry. This approach is in line with An Agreed Programme for Government.\n\nThe Irish Government has taken significant steps to bring about the closure of Sellafield. This objective was given added impetus by the legal actions taken by Ireland against the UK under both the OSPAR Convention and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. As the House will be aware, the action under the OSPAR Convention has been heard already but the action under UNCLOS is currently adjourned pending resolution of a jurisdictional issue raised by the European Commission which is now the subject of litigation by the Commission against Ireland before the European Court of Justice.\n\nWhile emphasising the importance of Drogheda as a primary development centre within the Border region, the regional planning guidelines for that region adopted earlier this year also point out that Drogheda's strategic position within the Dublin-Belfast economic corridor, its location relatively close to the greater Dublin area, and its much improved road and rail connections to and from the capital, mean that factors outside the Border region will also be significant in driving Drogheda's future development. The guidelines suggest that the future growth of the town should be focused on achieving a compact urban form with a good balance of development between the northern and southern environs of Drogheda. In this context the guidelines endorse the preparation of an integrated strategic land use and transportation framework for Drogheda and its environs in Louth and Meath, which broadly conforms with the national spatial strategy, the Border regional planning guidelines and those of the greater Dublin area. Work on the preparation of such a framework is now under way.\n\nThe regional planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area also adopted earlier this year recommend that inter-regional co-ordination committees should be established to discuss co-ordination of inter-regional proposals and their monitoring and implementation. In particular the guidelines recommend, in view of the ongoing preparation by Drogheda Borough Council, Louth County Council and Meath County Council of an integrated land use and transport framework for Drogheda, that a co-ordination committee involving those authorities, the Border Regional Authority and the greater Dublin area review team should be established.\n\nMy Department is in the process of finalising, in consultation with regional and local authorities, best practice guidance on the implementation of regional planning guidelines. Within this it is intended to cover the question of the putting co-ordination arrangements in place to address planning policies and proposals for areas which straddle the boundaries of two or more regional or local authorities. It is my intention to issue this guidance to regional and local authorities by the end of this year.\n\nSubstantial progress continues to be made on the affordable housing initiative under the Sustaining Progress agreement. Part V affordable units are also an important contribution to the initiative. More than 50 projects on State and local authority lands are planned at this stage which, together with some 2,100 affordable Part V units, will deliver a total of approximately 8,900 units under the initiative. My Department is engaged with a number of other Departments and State agencies with a view to securing further lands to reach the agreed target of 10,000 units. In particular, the Department of Health and Children is examining an inventory of health board lands to identify lands which could potentially yield 1,500 units to the initiative.\n\nConstruction has commenced on the Finglas Road site. A number of other projects have been advertised for expressions of interest, including the St. Bricin's military hospital site which was advertised as part of the O'Devaney Gardens redevelopment. Following a short-listing process, it is understood the request for proposals for the St Bricin's site will be issued this month. The Jamestown Road and Infirmary Road projects were advertised for expressions of interest in late September. Collectively, it is estimated that these four projects have the potential to yield more than 700 affordable housing units under the initiative. All projects are being progressed as a priority with activities being paralleled as necessary with a view to early delivery of units.\n\nA number of additional strategies, put forward by the Construction Industry Federation, including the possibility of land swaps, which may accelerate delivery of housing units, are currently being examined as a matter of urgency.\n\nMy Department will continue to work with the parties to the pay agreement to expedite effective implementation of the initiative. There is a strong commitment in Government to deliver on this initiative and I believe that the substantial progress made to date emphasises this commitment.\n\nI assume the question refers to the Agenda for Dublin, published on 19 October 2004 by the Dublin Regional Authority and the Dublin Employment Pact. The recommendations in this report involve a range of Ministers and will be a matter for each of them to consider, as appropriate. The establishment of a greater Dublin authority for land use and transport planning would be a matter in the first instance for my colleague, the Minister for Transport.\n\nIn so far as the policy areas within my remit are concerned, the national spatial strategy supports Dublin's pivotal role as a strong and internationally competitive city region, driving both its own economy and overall national development. The strategy endorses the need for the enhancement of Dublin's national role through improved mobility, better urban design, good social mix and top class international and regional connections. To achieve this, it calls for the physical consolidation of Dublin, supported by effective land use policies, to underpin the area's competitiveness and the ability of its public transport system to function more effectively.\n\nThe Dublin and Mid-East Regional Authorities have collaborated, under the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000, to produce strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, which were adopted in May 2004. These guidelines, which provide a more detailed long-term planning framework for the area within the overall vision of the national spatial strategy, also provide an illustration of how existing legislation can be utilised to ensure effective strategic planning at the regional level.\n\nThe Government has responded actively to the increased level of social housing need by expanding social and affordable housing output significantly. Spending on housing has increased substantially in recent years, with capital spending in 2004 at four times the 1998 level. The focus of the Government's spending on housing is on responding to the needs of low income, groups and those with social and special housing needs through a broad range of targeted initiatives. It is anticipated that through these measures the needs of over 13,000 households will be met in 2004, compared to some 8,500 households in 1998.\n\nIn addition, local authorities have been requested to prepare five-year social and affordable housing action plans to provide a framework for delivery of social and affordable housing measures for the period 2004 to 2008. The main objective in developing these action plans is the need to ensure that the investment available for these measures achieves the desired effect in the long term by tackling real need and breaking cycles of disadvantage and dependency.\n\nAs part of the homeless strategy, a homeless agency was established for the Dublin area to manage and co-ordinate the delivery of all services by both statutory and voluntary agencies to homeless persons in Dublin. The agency recently finalised its action plan for 2004 to 2006, which concentrates on four main areas. These are the provision of more housing rather than beds, the development of preventative strategies, the improvement of interventions when people become homeless, and an improvement in the collection and collation of data on homelessness.\n\nHaving regard to spatial planning and the other policies within my remit, regional co-ordination and co-operation is increasingly the norm. In this context, the Dublin Regional Authority, working closely with the Mid-East Regional Authority and the four Dublin local authorities, will continue to co-ordinate the provision of public services in the region.\n\nNew development management guidelines — a review of the development control guidelines of 1982 — are at an advanced stage of preparation by my Department. These guidelines are intended to give advice to planning authorities, planning practitioners and the general public on various areas of planning control and development management. The guidelines deal with the best ways to handle planning applications and other planning control issues, and will not deal with issues relating to any particular section of society.\n\nThe needs of children are provided for in the planning context by the guidelines for planning authorities on child care facilities and by the Planning and Development Act 2000. The child care guidelines were published by my Department in July 2001 and are designed to assist planning authorities in making suitable provision for child care facilities in their development plans and to ensure a consistency of approach throughout the country to the treatment of planning applications. Among other things, the guidelines state that a standard, with regard to new housing areas, of one child care facility with a minimum of 20 child care places for approximately 75 dwellings may be appropriate. The Planning and Development Act 2000 provides that planning authorities include objectives in their development plans for the provision, or facilitation of the provision, of services for the community including schools, crèches and other education and child care facilities.\n\nMy Department is currently finalising guidelines for planning authorities on development plans, which will be published in draft form for public consultation in the near future. The guidelines will aim to improve the standard and consistency of development plans and thereby improve the quality and consistency of decisions taken on the basis of those plans. They will refer, inter alia, to the mandatory objectives which planning authorities must include in the development plan with regard to community services including schools, crèches and other education and child care facilities. The guidelines will also refer to other community facilities, including facilities for children’s play, such as playgrounds, skateboard parks and other such facilities. The guidelines will indicate to planning authorities that they must respond to the circumstances of their own communities when formulating development plans. Under section 48 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, planning authorities may levy development contributions on developers to fund the provision of community facilities, including playgrounds.\n\nMy Department also assists the National Children's Office to administer the playgrounds grants scheme, which aims to increase the range of public play opportunities available to children. The scheme will provide funding for the provision of new playgrounds or refurbishment of existing playgrounds. An additional sum of €2 million was made available this year in my Department's budget for play facilities, to coincide with the launch of the national play policy in March 2004.\n\nThe term \"dirty bomb\" refers to a device created by mixing conventional explosives with radioactive materials so that the detonation of the explosives would result in the dispersal of radioactive materials. National regulatory authorities worldwide and relevant international organisations fully recognise this threat and a number of initiatives have been taken to combat it. For example, the International Atomic Energy Agency has produced a code of conduct on the safety and security of radioactive sources, which Ireland has formally endorsed. This code is intended to help guide national regulatory authorities to develop strategies to ensure that holders of radioactive materials have appropriate safety and security arrangements in place.\n\nUnder the Radiological Protection Act 1991, (Ionising Radiation) Order 2000, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, is responsible for regulating the custody, use, transport, importation, exportation, distribution, disposal and so on, of radioactive substances, nuclear devices or irradiating apparatus, as specified in the order. Under the order, any such activity is prohibited, save under licence issued by the RPII.\n\nIn this context, the RPII has taken a number of steps to improve security in situations where radioactive materials are stored, transported or used in Ireland. Licensed holders of such materials have been instructed by the RPII to pay increased attention to arrangements for ensuring security of the materials held in this country. In addition, the frequency of RPII inspections of radioactive materials and the licensees' storage arrangements has increased. The RPII also proposes to introduce new licensing conditions, which will require the licensee to undertake more frequent inventory checks of all their licensed radioactive materials. This will help to ensure a greater level of security is in place for such radioactive materials, whether in use or not. The RPII has also provided briefing to senior members of the Garda crime prevention unit, including advice on the security hazards posed by different radionuclides and practices.\n\nRadioactive materials imported into Ireland must comply with international requirements in regard to packaging and must be clearly labelled. Obviously, materials being imported for use in the making of a dirty bomb may not be so labelled. In this regard, earlier this year, the RPII held preliminary discussions with the customs authorities to advise them on how they might look out for and detect illegal imports. Security will be further strengthened when the EU high activity sealed sources directive is implemented in national law. This directive, the provisions of which must be enshrined in national law by the end of 2005, requires, inter alia, that customs authorities must be trained in methods for detecting radioactive materials.\n\nThe RPII's regulatory services will continue to keep the matter of the security of radioactive sources under constant review and maintain best practice in accordance with international and EU standards and advice.\n\nThe Government's national parks strategy includes the establishment of a management plan process for each of the country's six national parks, at Killarney, Glenveagh, the Wicklow Mountains, Connemara, the Burren, and Ballycroy, County Mayo. Hitherto, Killarney National Park was the only national park subject to a management plan, which was published in 1990. That plan acted as an important catalyst and framework for the many improvements that have been made in the park in the ensuing period.\n\nChanges in EU and national legislation since then, together with unprecedented levels of economic development, warrant a new and more participative approach to management planning for all our national parks. My Department therefore decided to establish a formalised consultative structure to elaborate draft management plans for each of the parks. This strategy involves the establishment of a national park liaison council for each park, three of which are already in place, in the Wicklow Mountains, Killarney and Connemara national parks. The role of these councils is to work with the national parks and wildlife service, NPWS, of my Department on preparing, and subsequently implementing, five-year management plans for the parks. Each draft plan will be the subject of widespread public consultation prior to final adoption and implementation. Once the management plan has been finalised and published, the council will continue to meet with park management to review the ongoing implementation of the plan.\n\nAn important element of this review process will involve the presentation by the NPWS regional manager of an annual business plan to the council outlining the park's proposed work programme for that year and the corresponding estimated cost involved, with direct reference to the strategies and targets elaborated in the plan. This review process is designed to achieve an inclusive and consultative approach to protecting and improving our national parks. Moreover, it is intended that, towards the end of the five-year implementation stage, a full assessment of progress achieved will be undertaken and a new management plan will be elaborated.\n\nThe management plan for each national park will be introduced on a phased basis. The management plan for the Wicklow Mountains National Park for 2005 to 2009 is the first plan under this strategy to have undergone the full cycle of approval by the park council, as well as a widespread public consultation process. Final editing of this plan is under way and I am hopeful that I will be in a position to formally launch it before the end of the year.\n\nThe draft management plan for Killarney National Park was launched by my predecessor in September 2004 and is available for public consultation. Following this, submissions received will be analysed and amendments made as considered appropriate. Once this process has been completed, I envisage that this plan will be published early in 2005.\n\nWork is under way on the preparation of the draft management plans for Connemara and Glenveagh National Parks and a liaison council will soon be established for Glenveagh. My Department hopes to commence the management plan process for both the Burren National Park and Ballycroy National Park, County Mayo in 2005.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 89 and 109 together.\n\nThe unprecedented demand for housing, fuelled mainly by rapid economic growth and demographic changes, has been the major driver of house price increases in recent years. The Government's strategy is to increase housing supply to meet demand and to improve affordability, particularly for first-time buyers, and in this way to seek to bring moderation to house price increases.\n\nThe measures introduced by this Government to boost supply, including significant investment in infrastructure, improving planning capacity and promoting increased residential densities, are having effect. The year 2003 was the ninth record year for house completions. Output continues to remain high in 2004 with 47,645 units completed in the first eight months of this year, up 15% on 2003 levels. The rate of house construction in Ireland, namely, 17 houses per 1,000 population, is among the highest rates being achieved in Europe.\n\nWhile the rate of house price increases is still problematic, this has moderated considerably since the late 1990s when price increases peaked at 40% per annum in 1998. A number of market commentators, including the Central Bank, are now predicting greater balance in the housing market over the next few years, as increased supply has a restraining effect on house prices. Indicative data available to the Department show that first-time buyers continue to have a significant presence in the housing market.\n\nIn addition to measures to support a market response to the unprecedented demand, the Government has placed a particular emphasis on the delivery of targeted schemes of affordable housing. Output has increased under the shared ownership and the 1999 affordable housing scheme which are targeted at purchasers with low and modest incomes. Over the coming years, the availability of affordable housing options will be further expanded with units coming on stream through Part V of the Planning and Development Act and the affordable housing initiative. In addition to the units already acquired to date under Part V, 1,600 affordable units were planned or in progress at the end of June, indicating the increased momentum of delivery of this initiative. At the same time, the Government is concerned to ensure that the broad spectrum of housing needs is met.\n\nThe total amount of funding available for social and affordable housing measures in 2004 is €1.884 billion. This is over four times the amount provided in 1997 and an increase of 5.4% on the 2003 provision, reflecting the strong commitment of the Government to continue to meet the needs of low income groups and those with social and special housing needs. It is anticipated that the needs of over 13,000 households will be met through these measures in 2004, compared to almost 8,500 in 1998.\n\nThe Government will continue to focus on measures to maintain a high level of housing supply in keeping with demand and ensuring that the demand for housing is met in a sustainable manner, and we will continue to monitor and review housing developments and policies as necessary.\n\nThere are currently nine cases in respect of which the European Commission has initiated legal action in relation to EU environmental directives, eight of which are the responsibility of my Department. This figure includes one case where the Commission has applied to the court for a daily fine in relation to the incomplete transposition of the EIA, environmental impact assessment, directive.\n\nThe following are the eight cases for which my Department has responsibility. The dangerous substances in water case relates to a directive on water quality. It is substantially implemented in the context of the Local Government Water Pollution Act and related legislation. For the purposes of this directive, water quality standards have been established for phosphorous and 14 other substances. However, EPA monitoring indicates that dangerous substances are generally not a problem in Irish waters. The directive is being further implemented in the context of implementation of the water framework directive.\n\nWith regard to the directive on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, commonly known as an environmental impact assessment, or EIA, the points at issue relate to one aspect of the implementation of the directive, with specific regard to peat extraction. The Commission applied to the European Court of Justice on 7 July 2003 seeking the application of a daily fine of €21,600 for each day of delay in implementing measures in relation to the environment impact directive. There is ongoing communication with the Commission to resolve the matter.\n\nThree cases relate to alleged failures to designate areas for conservation. The first case concerns the failure to fulfil obligations under the birds directive and the habitats directive and relates specifically to the effects of sheep overgrazing in the Owenduff and Nephin Beg regions. My Department is in communication with the Commission with a view to satisfying the requirements of the Court. The second case relates to the designation of a sufficient number of special areas of conservation under the habitats directive. My Department has worked to meet the requirements of the directive and has to all intents and purposes satisfied the requirements of the court judgment in this case. The third case, proceedings in which were initiated by the Commission during October 2004, relates primarily to allegations that insufficient special protection areas have been classified under the birds directive and the habitats directive and that the protective mechanisms in place are insufficient. The defence in this case is currently being prepared.\n\nWith regard to a number of related waste issues, the Advocate General delivered his opinion on this case to the European Court of Justice on 23 September 2004. With regard to end of life vehicles, it is intended to make regulations later this year fully transposing the directive's provisions and facilitating its full implementation in 2005. Regarding reporting requirements under an EU Regulation on ozone depleting substances, a response to the most recent judgment of the ECJ is being prepared.\n\nThe ninth case relates to matters for which the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has responsibility and concerns the shellfish waters directive. The Irish authorities have responded to the letter of formal notice of September 2004, providing clarification to the Commission on the areas in which the Irish implementation programme was deemed to be deficient.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 100 and 106 together.\n\nThis recent shipment between the United States and France arose from an agreement between the US and Russia in regard to the decommissioning of nuclear weapons. The weapons grade plutonium arising from the decommissioning process was shipped from the US to France for fabrication into MOX nuclear fuel for application in US nuclear reactors.\n\nThe shipment passed through international and French territorial waters at the European end. My officials sought and received assurances from the US and France that the shipment would not enter Irish territorial waters. In addition to the information received from the US and France, the United Kingdom Government advised my officials of the dispatch of the two ships from the UK to collect the shipment from the US for transport to France. This communication was on a government to government basis and no direct communication took place with British Nuclear Fuels Limited.\n\nThe Irish Government has long been concerned about the shipment of nuclear materials. It is also concerned about the risk of a major accident or security incident and about the potential for damage to public health, the environment and the economy arising from any such accident or incident.\n\nThe question of imposing a ban on the passage of ships carrying nuclear materials in international waters has proved difficult given the right of passage enshrined in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. The Irish Government's opposition to such shipments of radioactive material will continue to be voiced in the appropriate international arena and it will continue to press for detailed information about such shipments. Such information is vital in regard to national emergency preparedness and response in the event of any accident or incident.\n\nThe concerns of the Irish Government about nuclear shipments in general have been highlighted on numerous occasions at meetings of relevant international organisations such as the International Maritime Organisation and the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, and also at the EU. Ireland, along with a number of like-minded coastal states, has been particularly active in recent years at annual meetings of the IAEA general conference in promoting the adoption by the IAEA of resolutions on the shipment of radioactive materials. These resolutions acknowledge the concerns of a number of states about the potential for damage arising from an accident or incident involving shipments of radioactive materials. In promoting these resolutions, Ireland and like-minded states have sought detailed information from the shipping states on all movements of nuclear materials on the international seas.\n\nThe 2004 general conference of the IAEA again saw Ireland adopting a key role in the drafting of the resolution on transport safety, which addresses the issue of communication on shipments between shipping and coastal states. I am pleased to say that this resolution was ultimately sponsored by Chile, France, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Peru, the UK, the USA and Turkey. It received widespread support from all of the other member states of the EU as well as numerous other delegations at the conference. It was adopted at the plenary session of the general conference by consensus on 24 September last. While the issue will continue to prove difficult, I believe this resolution provides a basis on which to address the concerns of coastal states and Ireland with like-minded states will continue to pursue these issues at the IAEA and other relevant international fora.\n\nThe strategy for the control of antimicrobial resistance in Ireland, SARI, was launched in June 2001. Approximately €16 million in funding has been made available to health boards since then — of which €4.5 million was provided in the current year — to implement the strategy. Much of this funding is designated for improving hospital infrastructure for control of infection and for appointing the additional microbiologists, infection control nurses and other health care professionals required for effective control of infection in hospitals.\n\nMRSA infection is generally confined to hospitals and, in particular, to vulnerable or debilitated patients including those in intensive care units, on surgical, burns or orthopaedic wards, elderly and-or very sick patients and those who have open wounds, etc. Carriage of MRSA does not generally pose a risk to family members — unless they are suffering from a debilitating disease — or hospital staff of an affected patient or their close social or work contacts. MRSA does not harm healthy people, including pregnant women, children or babies. MRSA can affect people who have certain long-term health problems. Visitors to patients with MRSA infection should be advised by the local nursing-medical staff to wash their hands thoroughly after visiting patients so as to avoid spreading MRSA.\n\nInfection with staphylococcus aureus or MRSA bacteria can be prevented by practising good hygiene as follows: keeping hands clean by washing thoroughly with soap and water; keeping cuts and abrasions clean and covered with a proper dressing — a bandage — until healed; and avoiding contact with other people's wounds or material contaminated by wounds.\n\nWhile financial assistance as such is not given, assistance is given to patients and their families by way of advice. Both patients and families of patients who contract MRSA should ensure they practise good hygiene standards. Hand hygiene is a key component in the control of MRSA and the SARI infection control sub-committee has recently released national guidelines for hand hygiene in health care settings. These guidelines have been widely circulated by the NDSC and are available on the its website, www.ndsc.ie. Each health board — authority region has a regional SARI committee and these are responsible for regional interventions to control hospital infection, including MRSA.\n\nIn 1995 my Department prepared a set of guidelines in respect of MRSA which have been widely circulated and include an information leaflet for patients. The SARI infection control sub-committee is currently updating national guidelines on the control of MRSA in health care settings. A draft version of these guidelines will be distributed for consultation shortly and will also be available on the NDSC website. The key recommendations cover such areas as environmental cleanliness and overcrowding, sufficient isolation facilities, hand hygiene, appropriate antibiotic use, early detection of MRSA through surveillance and laboratory detection of MRSA.\n\nSenior hospital and health board managers have corporate responsibility for ensuring that appropriate infection control measures are implemented.\n\nIn a liberalised market, it is a matter in the first instance for the market players to provide telecommunications and broadband services. Recognising, however, that the pace of high speed broadband rollout to the regions was not sufficient to attain the Government's national broadband goals as set out in New Connections and in its broadband strategy, in March 2002, the then Minister announced the regional metropolitan area network programme. Against the backdrop of this concern, later in 2002, Forfás and the Department of the Taoiseach engaged SJS Consulting Incorporated to review that programme and the policy options for national broadband rollout generally.\n\nAs part of this process, the consultants held discussions with my Department, Eircom and other service providers. Officials from my Department met Eircom representatives on a number of occasions to discuss the options put forward by the consultants. The consultants and officials from my Department also met other market players and a number of public consultations under the aegis of IBEC's telecoms and Internet federation and Forfás were also held.\n\nNegotiations were not entered into with Eircom or any other party at any stage. At no stage were terms such as those postulated in The Sunday Business Post article on offer nor did the Government offer to fund Eircom directly or indirectly through subsidised loans, tax breaks or any other means. This has also been publicly confirmed by Eircom.\n\nThe Government at the time was dissatisfied with the speed of broadband rollout and decided to intervene with a view to bringing forward proposals to address this problem. Government policy is that it favours investment in open access infrastructure which all operators have access to on similar transparent terms. That is the idea behind the Government's open access metropolitan area network programme, which is rolling out high speed broadband infrastructure to all 120 towns and cities regionally.\n\nThe Sunday Business Post article of 31 October last to which the Deputy refers, contends, inter alia, that the Government offered Eircom a €1.8 billion deal to roll out broadband nationally. It also contends that Eircom was offered a range of incentives such as tax breaks, subsidised loans, amendments to the building regulations and price increases as \"carrots\". These claims are untrue.\n\nConsultancy advice contained in a report to a Government subcommittee, agency or a Department should not be misconstrued as Government policy. The telecommunications market is a regulated market and, thus, action by Government has to be consonant with national and EU regulation. Accordingly, the Government is not in the business of entering exclusive contracts of the kind inferred by the article with any market entities.\n\nMajor electricity blackouts are usually the result of a number of contingencies. These include generation shortages, transmission network failures or other operational difficulties. While no electricity power system can be fully protected from such events, I am satisfied adequate measures are in place to reduce the risk of a major blackout occurring on the Irish power system.\n\nThe Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, continues to monitor the security of electricity supply situation. Demand for electricity is forecast to increase at an annual rate of between 2.9% and 4.3% over the period 2004-2010 and the supply-demand balance will vary on a real time basis throughout the year depending on demand and generation availability. The current supply-demand balance is deemed to be workable, though not ideal.\n\nThe CER has initiated positive actions to redress possible generation capacity shortfalls in the short, medium and longer term, as forecast by ESB National Grid in its Generation Adequacy Report 2004-2010. Short-term measures put in place for this winter include the implementation by ESB National Grid of a demand side management programme, increased imports of 167 MW of electricity from Northern Ireland contracted on a priority basis and 208 MW of additional mobile peaking capacity.\n\nIn response to the medium to long-term capacity deficit, two new independent plants successful in the CER's capacity 2005 competition, which will generate up to 500 MW, are due to be commissioned by December 2005 and February 2006 respectively. In addition, the two new peat plants, with a combined capacity of 250 MW, are due to be commissioned by December 2004 and February 2005 respectively.\n\nAn ESB plant productivity programme is in place to enhance its availability from 76% in 2003 to a target of 82% during 2004. The CER will impose penalties on a progressive basis to make sure the action programme delivers. The ESB is also undertaking a significant networks investment programme of €4 billion up to 2007 to bring the transmission and distribution systems up to required international standards and to meet projected capacity demand requirements. The programme is being delivered within the planned timeframe and budget.\n\nFurther increments of capacity will be required by 2007 to ensure the supply-demand balance over the coming years. In this connection, Viridian Group PLC has recently announced its plans to construct a second 400 MW gas fired power plant at Huntstown, County Dublin. In addition, the Government has given approval to proceed with the development of two 500 MW interconnectors between Ireland and Wales, as a priority, which when operational will further enhance security of supply. The desirability and feasibility of increased interconnection between North and South is being investigated.\n\nAt EU level, the Commission has brought forward a draft directive concerning measures to safeguard security of electricity supply and infrastructure investment. The draft directive, which Ireland supports, forms part of a new energy infrastructure and security of supply legislative package, designed in the main to promote investment in the European energy sector with a view to both strengthening competition and helping to prevent the reoccurrence of electricity blackouts. Many of the elements of the proposed directive form part of the electricity regulatory framework in Ireland.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, the transmission system operator, ESB National Grid, as part of its licence conditions, has in place a number of specific emergency plans which can deal with the incident quickly and effectively. Procedures for activation and implementation of the plans, as well as communication procedures, are tested and reviewed at regular intervals. For instance, a key element of the plans is to ensure, in the event of a shortage of generation capacity, load shedding is kept to the minimum necessary to make sure the power system remains in a stable operating mode at all times.\n\nI am committed to the development of an integrated strategy to increase market penetration of biofuels in Ireland. To this end, an interdepartmental group has been set up by my Department comprising officials from my Department, Sustainable Energy Ireland, and the Departments of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Transport, Agriculture and Food and Finance. The group is considering policy options for the development of a biofuels sector in Ireland and to increase the penetration of biofuels in the transport fuel market.\n\nIn March 2004, my Department secured an amendment to the Finance Act 1999, which provides for the introduction of a scheme for excise tax relief for biofuels. The purpose of the scheme is to allow qualified and conditional relief from excise of biofuel used in approved pilot projects for the production of biofuel or the testing of the technical viability of biofuel for use as a motor fuel. My Department is finalising details of the scheme with the Department of Finance. The European Commission has confirmed that the scheme would represent a state aid and consequently its approval is required. The EU energy tax directive 2003 envisages such tax relief and the Commission has approved schemes for excise relief of biofuel in other EU member states. Formal application for Commission approval will be made shortly by the Department of Finance and, assuming approval is granted, the necessary commencement order will then be signed.\n\nSustainable Energy Ireland is also funding a number of biomass projects and studies through its renewable energy research development and demonstration programme. Under the programme, Sustainable Energy Ireland offers capital grant aid for biofuels market demonstration projects in the pure plant oil, biodiesel and bioethanol categories. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has no role in the issuing of licences for the production or refining of biofuels, which is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. Biofuel is a \"mineral oil\", as defined in mineral oil tax law, and is, therefore, an excisable product subject to the provisions of the law relating to mineral oil tax and to general excise law. In addition, bioethanol is subject to the provisions of alcohol product tax law. These are matters for the Revenue Commissioners. Further information and applications for authorisations and for licences may be made to the applicant's local Revenue office.\n\nThe humanitarian situation in Sudan, particularly the Darfur region, remains at the top of the agenda for Ireland. We have used all avenues open to us to urge action in improving the humanitarian, security and political challenges which exist there.\n\nThe Government has provided almost €10 million in funding to Sudan in 2004. The sum of €6 million has been provided in emergency assistance to meet the immediate needs of some of the most vulnerable populations in Darfur. Assistance amounting to over €3 million is being provided to other areas of Sudan, where needs are also great. Sudan has received the most significant level of Irish Government humanitarian support in 2004. In addition, I would also underline that the Irish people have been extremely generous in their private contributions to aid agencies.\n\nThe recent progress in meeting immediate humanitarian needs has been put in some jeopardy by an escalation in security incidents over the last few days. Field missions by international organisations have been suspended by the UN security co-ordinator until further notice. The security situation in all three states of Darfur remains highly volatile, and we are keeping in close touch with Irish NGOs operating there about the situation.\n\nThis recent deterioration follows on improvements in the humanitarian situation in September and early October. In September the UN World Food Programme, WFP, provided food to 1.3 million people in the Darfur region, exceeding its own target of 1.2 million and recording its largest food distribution since the humanitarian crisis began. Over 1.5 million people are now thought to be displaced within Darfur and 200,000 have crossed the border into Chad. Those affected will need continued humanitarian assistance for some considerable time to come. The needs remain huge and almost one half of all families do not have sufficient food. According to the WFP, 22% of children under five years are malnourished. The WFP remains a key partner for Ireland.\n\nThe UN Consolidated Appeal for Sudan for 2004 estimates that approximately US$720 million will be required for humanitarian programmes in Sudan, including Darfur. To date over US$490 million, 68%, has been contributed to this appeal. This does not include the significant funding being delivered to Sudan via NGOs and other international organisations such as the Red Cross family.\n\nIt is clear that the Government of Sudan needs to do more to meet its obligations under UN Security Council Resolutions 1556 and 1564. The most recent report by the UN Secretary General's Special Representative for Sudan, Jan Pronk, presented to the Security Council on 5 October, showed no real improvement in the overall situation in Darfur and a continuing failure by the Sudanese authorities to disarm the Janjaweed militias and bring those responsible for serious human rights violations to justice. The international community must therefore continue to maintain pressure on the Sudanese Government including, if necessary, through sanctions, to meet its obligations and support all efforts to put an end to the conflict between the Government and local rebel groups. It is also incumbent on the rebel groups to engage constructively in the peace process.\n\nUN Resolution 1564 also calls on the UN Secretary General to set up an international commission of inquiry which will investigate claims of human rights abuses and also genocide. The Government of Sudan has pledged its co-operation with this commission. Ireland fully supports the work of the international commission and looks forward to its producing a report at the earliest opportunity.\n\nLegally enforceable maintenance payments paid by one spouse to another are assessable as reckonable emoluments, as provided for under the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993 and liable for social insurance contributions at PRSI class S. Section 23 of the Social Welfare Act 2000 provided for new PRSI arrangements relating to legally enforceable maintenance payments between spouses. Previously a charge for PRSI arose by both the payer and the recipient of a maintenance payment, amounting in effect to a double payment of PRSI. The revised provisions ensure that PRSI is not charged twice on maintenance payments and that a refund is available to the payer where such occurs. The maintenance recipient continues to be liable for PRSI at class S on the amount of maintenance received. This measure brought liability for PRSI in line with previously existing arrangements for the health contributions and income tax.\n\nWhere the recipient of a maintenance payment is in insurable employment and already paying employee contributions at PRSI class A, the recipient is exempted from liability for class S PRSI. In such a case, no social insurance contributions are due on the maintenance payments received. Where a maintenance recipient has income arising from a trade or profession, the maintenance payment is accumulated with other class S income, with liability to social insurance contribution arising accordingly. These arrangements allow the recipient to build an entitlement to social welfare contributory pensions on an individual basis. Payment of class S contributions will enable a self-employed contributor to accrue personal entitlements, most notably to old age contributory pension. Others benefits payable include: widow's or widower's contributory pension; orphans contributory pension; maternity benefit; adoptive benefit; and bereavement benefit.\n\nAny extension of the range of benefits for self-employed contributors who are legally separated from their spouses would have to encompass all self-employed contributors and could give rise to significant additional costs to the social insurance fund.\n\nTo extend the range of benefits for self-employed contributors would in any event necessitate an appropriate increase in the rate of PRSI class S contribution. There are no plans at present to extend coverage for further benefits to the self-employed contributors. A self-employed contributor may claim an assistance based payment, such as one parent family payment, unemployment assistance or supplementary welfare allowance. Entitlement to these payments is contingent on fulfilling relevant qualification criteria and satisfying a means test. Income received by way of maintenance from an separated spouse would be assessable as means.\n\nThe Department of Health and Children has responsibility for the health levy.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 142 and 143 together.\n\nFamily income supplement, FIS, is designed to provide cash support for employees on low earnings with families and thereby preserve the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if s/he were claiming other social welfare payments. The range of improvements to the family income supplement scheme instituted in recent years, including the assessment of FIS on the basis of net rather than gross income and the progressive increases in the income limits, have made it easier for lower income households to qualify under the scheme.\n\nBudget 2004 provided for further increases in the FIS income limits with effect from January 2004. These increases raised the weekly income limits by €28 at each point, adding an extra €16.80 to the payments of most existing FIS recipients. The minimum FIS weekly payment was also increased by €7, from €13 to €20. The average weekly payment now stands at €74.16 per week, with a total of 14,303 families — end October 2004 — receiving a supplement under the scheme.\n\nThe weekly income thresholds for families with one, two and three children are €407, €433 and €458, respectively. At end December 1999 there were 14,686 FIS recipients compared to 14,303 at end October 2004. To ensure that employment remains an attractive option to people with families, FIS thresholds have been increased in line with increases in the rate of unemployment assistance, UA, relevant to each family size, which have exceeded cost of living increases in recent years.\n\nThe following tables demonstrate that the 2004 thresholds compare favourably with the 1999 rates when increase in the consumer price index is taken into account, table 1, and list the numbers of FIS recipients each year from December 1999 to October 2004, table 2. Any decision to increase FIS thresholds will be taken in a budgetary context and in the context of priorities generally, having regard to available resources.\n\n* Consumer Price Index\n\nTable 2: Number of Recipient Families of Family Income Supplement.\n\nNumber\n\nDecember 1999\n\n14,686\n\nDecember 2000\n\n13,181\n\nDecember 2001\n\n11,880\n\nDecember 2002\n\n12,043\n\nDecember 2003\n\n12,317\n\nOctober 2004\n\n14,303\n\nRent supplements are provided through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered by the health boards on behalf of my Department.\n\nSupplementary welfare allowance is not normally payable to people in full-time employment. However, special arrangements have been in place for a number of years which allow people on approved schemes such as community employment, CE, retain a portion of their rent supplement on a tapered basis, subject to a gross household income limit of €317.43 per week and certain other conditions.\n\nParticipants in CE schemes may opt for assessment under this tapered withdrawal system or the standard supplementary welfare allowance means test, whichever is the more favourable to them.\n\nUnder standard assessment rules, rent supplements are calculated to ensure that an eligible person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution, currently €13, which each recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources. Up to €50 per week of additional income from part-time employment is disregarded in the means test, with the aim of ensuring that a person is better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity. CE is regarded as part-time employment for these purposes. There are also earnings disregards applied to the one-parent family payment to the person concerned.\n\nThe South Western Area Health Board was contacted regarding this case and has advised that the amount of rent supplement in payment to June 2004 was based on the person's income from his one-parent family payment only. The board reviewed his entitlement when it became aware he was participating in a CE scheme and reduced his rent supplement in respect of July and August 2004.\n\nThe board has further advised that the person concerned was unsuccessful in appealing against the decision to reduce his rent supplement.\n\nHe was also requested to provide documentation confirming his continued participation in the CE scheme. To date, he has not provided the details sought and accordingly payment of his rent supplement has been suspended. His case will be fully examined on receipt of the requested information and if he has an entitlement to rent supplement, payment will be made at the appropriate level with immediate effect.\n\nI refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 156, which I answered on Tuesday, 2 November 2004. The position is unchanged.\n\nThe Garda Síochána is the responsible authority for the location of bus stops in Dublin. This power is vested in the Garda Commissioner under section 85 of the Road Traffic Act 1961. Under that section, the Commissioner may issue a direction to a bus operator identifying the specific location of bus stops in respect of any bus route. I understand the gardaí engage in a consultation process with both the local authority and the bus service provider before issuing a direction under section 85.\n\nThe review of the location of bus stops following the Dublin Bus tragedy is ongoing by Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann. Dublin Bus has completed the development of a database to facilitate this review process. It is anticipated that this joint review will be completed by mid-2005.\n\nTo date there are in excess of 1200 bus shelters in the Dublin area. Dublin Bus is proposing to introduce a further 400 over the next five years. Dublin Bus has a contract with a shelter provider company to erect shelters at stops. The cost of erecting shelters is financed from the advertising revenue. I am informed by Dublin Bus that it is policy that all relevant planning and safety legislation is complied with.\n\nTo date there are in excess of 470 Bus Éireann shelters erected throughout the country. Bus Éireann is currently in the process of finalising the award of a contract for the design, manufacture, installation and maintenance of between 180 and 220 additional bus shelters at bus stops along the Bus Éireann route network.\n\nThere are a number of external factors that influence the erection of shelters. These include the width and condition of the footpath, the layout of the stop, and the fact that shelters are subject to planning permission and have to comply with local authorities' requirements regarding visual presentation of street furniture, etc.\n\nI am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of tax assessments made by revenue bureau officers from the inception of the Criminal Assets Bureau in 1996 to 31 October 2004 is 1,017. However, this figure does not necessarily represent 1,017 individual cases as there could be a number of separate assessments in different years against one individual chargeable person.\n\nNot all of tax assessments result in settlements. The tax collection process carried out by the Criminal Assets Bureau following on those assessments will include court action for judgment in many cases. In other cases, collection will involve the use of attachment notices seeking payment to the bureau of debts owed to the chargeable person by third parties. Some cases will involve agreed payments and some but not all of those agreed payments will involve formal settlements.\n\nThe overall sum for tax collected by 31 October 2004 by the Criminal Assets Bureau since 1996 is €69,262,409. I am also informed by the Garda authorities that it is not possible to be specific as to how much of that recovered sum represents formal settlements as the variety of agreements reached to recover taxes will vary widely across the different types of cases with which the bureau deals.\n\nThe revenue bureau officers are subject to strict rules of secrecy under the law attached to their work. This was only lifted by the Oireachtas under the Taxes Consolidation Act to allow the publication of specific types of tax settlements reached with the Revenue Commissioners. Those provisions relaxing the general rule of Revenue secrecy only apply to tax settlements or agreements entered into by the Revenue Commissioners in excess of €12,700. The provision allowing disclosure does not apply to tax settlements entered into with the Criminal Assets Bureau as the law now stands. The Criminal Assets Bureau believes the current position is operationally useful.\n\nI have responsibility for policy on family reunion, that is, the policy on granting permission to enter and remain in the State to the spouses and children of non-EEA nationals who are legally resident in the State. This includes the spouses and dependant children of non-EEA nationals who have entered the State for work purposes.\n\nI fully acknowledge that family reunion policy should recognise the needs of persons coming to Ireland to work and be in accordance with the broad needs of the Irish economy, including the safeguarding of public resources. In the case of visa required family members of non-EEA national workers, the general rule is that it is only after the worker has been in the State for 12 months and has been offered employment for a further 12 months that they may be joined by their families. This is subject to the worker being able to support the family without recourse to public funds.\n\nThere is no general time restriction in operation with regard to family reunion where the family members in question are not visa required. The only caveat, again, is that the worker in question must be in a position to support the family without recourse to public funds.\n\nWhen assessing applications for family reunification, the visa officer will consider, amongst other things, whether the level of salary of the worker would come within the ambit of qualifying for payment from public funds. In this regard, the criteria set by the Department of Social and Family Affairs for eligibility for family income supplement payment, FIS, is used. The criteria, which may change from time to time, are available on that Department's website www.welfare.ie/publications/sw22.html. If the level of the worker’s income as evidenced by his or her payslips or P60 would qualify for FIS payments, the application for family reunification is generally refused as it is evident that the family can seek recourse to public funds.\n\nGarda trainees are attested to the force on successful completion of phase three of their training. On attestation, a Garda trainee becomes a serving member of the force with full Garda powers. Formal graduation takes place following the completion of the fifth and final phase of training. The serving strength of the force at any given time, therefore, includes those who have been attested following completion of phase three of their training but have not yet formally graduated. The strength of the force as at 25 October 2004 was 12,108, all ranks. When an additional 190 gardaí are attested on 26 November, the force strength, already at a record high, will have reached or exceeded 12,200.\n\nWith regard to Garda resources generally, I am very pleased that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the An Agreed Programme for Government commitment in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.\n\nThe Commissioner will now draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these resources. Clearly, however, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences in particular, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to significantly increase the number of gardaí allocated to traffic duties. I have already promised that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into front-line, operational, high visibility policing. They will have a real impact.\n\nThe person in question, accompanied by her daughter, arrived in the State on 16 April, 2003 and claimed asylum. I should explain that in the asylum process, a claim for refugee status by a child is considered in tandem with that of a parent. Following an interview, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner recommended that she should not be declared as a refugee and she was notified of this recommendation on 30 December 2003. This recommendation was appealed to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Following an oral hearing, the original recommendation was affirmed and she was informed of this decision on 28 April, 2004.\n\nIn accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, the mother was informed on 27 September 2004, that it was proposed to make a deportation order in her case and that of her daughter. She was given the options of making representations within 15 working days setting out the reasons as to why they should not be deported; leaving the State voluntarily before orders were made; or consenting to the making of deportation orders. On 19 October 2004, representations were received on behalf of both mother and daughter from their legal representatives requesting humanitarian leave to remain in the State and including medical reports in relation to both as well as country of origin information.\n\nThe case file will now be considered by my Department taking account of section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 dealing with prohibition of refoulement. The file will be submitted to me for decision shortly and the persons concerned will then be informed of the outcome.\n\nEntry to the Garda Síochána is governed by the An Garda Síochána (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations 1988, as amended. The educational requirements for entry to the Garda Síochána are set out in regulation 5(1)(d) of the 1988 regulations which provides that the Commissioner shall not admit a person as a trainee unless the person has, before the first day of September in the year in which the said advertisement was so published, obtained: (i) in the leaving certificate examination of the Department of Education and Science or the leaving certificate vocational programme examination of that Department — (1) a grade not lower than C3 at foundation level, or a grade not lower than D3 at a level other than foundation level, in Irish, (2) a grade not lower than B3 at foundation level, or a grade not lower than D3 at a level other than foundation level, in mathematics, and (3) a grade not lower than D3 in at least three other subjects, including English; or (ii) a grade not lower than the merit grade in the leaving certificate applied of the Department of Education and Science; or (iii) grades in at least five subjects, including Irish, mathematics and English, in another examination of a kind that is in the opinion of the Minister, of a standard not lower than the standard of either of the examinations referred to in clause (i) of this subparagraph, the grades aforesaid being grades that are in the opinion of the Minister, equivalent to the grades specified in the said clause (i); or (iv) a grade in another assessment of a kind that includes Irish, mathematics and English and is, in the opinion of the Minister, of a standard not lower than the standard of the assessment referred to in clause (ii) of this subparagraph, the grade aforesaid being a grade that is, in the opinion of the Minister equivalent to the grade specified in the said clause (ii). These are the statutory regulations and the Commissioner is precluded from admitting to the organisation a candidate who does not comply with the regulations.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 179 to 183, inclusive together.\n\nIn general, the following grants are available to schools who establish special classes for pupils with autism: start-up equipment grant of €635 per class and capitation grant of €589.50 per pupil. In addition to this, my Department's building unit fund a once-off equipment and furniture grant of €6,348.69 when a new autistic class is established. The school concerned has recently re-organised classes to facilitate the setting up of an additional autistic class. My officials are liaising with the Department's inspectorate regarding a set-up grant and a decision will be conveyed to the school authorities shortly.\n\nI have authorised a major expansion in the range of postgraduate training for teachers working with pupils with special needs in four colleges of education and UCD. In addition, I have authorised the introduction of a range of new training programmes to provide a mix of intensive induction training and more advanced training in specific areas. I have also established a special education support service, headquartered in the Laois education centre, to manage, co-ordinate and develop a range of supports in response to identified training needs. The service is developing training teams to deliver training in specific areas. In addition, the service supports a range of local initiatives including the use of e-learning which provides co"
