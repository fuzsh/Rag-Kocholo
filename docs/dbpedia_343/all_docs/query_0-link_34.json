        "text": "Sinn Féin gains council seats across the 26 Counties\n\nNew county council seats in Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Cork, Kilkenny, Limerick, Mayo, Offaly, Tipperary, Waterford and Wicklow all show the tangible gains by Sinn Féin as the party held up and improved upon its substantial 2004 performance in local and EU elections.\n\nAcross the five EU constituencies on the island Sinn Féin took a massive 331,797 votes and 14.34% of the all-Ireland vote. In the County council elections Sinn Féin entered the election with 51 seats and came out of the poll with 54 county council seats and 67 town council and borough seats.\n\nAn Phoblacht’s Robbie Smyth runs through the council votes county by county outlining the Sinn Féin performance which varies from seats won topping the poll to one vote margins in Cavan.\n\nCarlow: New Town council seat\n\nIn a first time election for Sinn Féin John Cassin took 11.2% of the vote running in Carlow West and running in Carlow Town Council took a first seat here for the party.\n\nCavan County Council: One new seat\n\nSinn Féin took 10.2% of the vote across Cavan County council, winning four seats and representation in each of the county’s four electoral areas, up 1 from 2004.\n\nIn Bailieborough Paddy MacDonald was re-elected to the council with 8.4% of the vote.\n\nPauline Tully McCauley’s vote share increased for the third election running as she was re-elected for the Ballyjamesduff ward of Cavan County Council with 11% of the vote up slight on 9.76% in 2004.\n\nIn Belturbet, Damien Brady won a new seat for Sinn Féin with 8.7% of the vote. Brady won by one vote and a recount was called by the returning officer, which only changed the votes to put Sinn Féin three votes ahead.\n\nFianna Fáil who lost the seat to Sinn Féin were demanding a full manual recount while the returning office favours a smaller recheck of how surpluses were allocated. As An Phoblacht goes to print it is still a Sinn Féin gain.\n\nIn Cavan county electoral ward Charlie Boylan topped the poll with 15.3% of the vote up slightly on 2004 and was elected on the first count.\n\nCavan Town Councils\n\nSinn Féin didn’t win back the seat it last held on Belturbet Town Council in 1999. Noreen Quinn Briddigkeit won 2.2% of the vote. In Cavan town Council Brian McKeown was elected on the fifth count and running mate Richard Cassidy didn’t make it a double for Sinn Féin who took 13.7% of the vote here. In Cootehill Sinn Féin did retain its two town councillors as Harry McCabe and John Martin were returned for the third successive election.\n\nClare: New seat on Ennis Town Council\n\nSean Hayes won 2.8% of the vote running in the Ennis West ward of Clare County Council and 3% of first preferences on Ennis Town Council. Cathy McCafferty was elected on the fourth count to Shannon Town Council with 6.4% of the vote.\n\nCork City: Two new seats\n\nSinn Féin took 10.8% of the vote in Cork city up marginally on 2004, but in 2009 the party doubled its representation on council seats across the six city wards.\n\nIn Cork North Central Thomas Gould was elected on the ninth count winning a new seat for Sinn Féin with 7.8% of the vote in the five seat ward. In Cork North East Pat Coughlan took 7.7% of the vote in this four seat ward but did not win a seat.\n\nIn Cork North West Jonathon O’Brien was elected on the first count with 21.7% of the poll, up from 17.25% in 2004.\n\nIn South Central Fiona Kerins took a seat on the fifth count with 11.06% of the vote, up from 9.02% in 2004. In South East Ken Ahern took 7.17%, repeating the 2004 result, but didn’t take a seat. In South West Henry Cremin was elected on the fifth count with 12.38% of the vote.\n\nCork County\n\nIn 2004 Sinn Féin made a breakthrough onto Cork County Council winning its first seat in Middleton. In 2009 the party held its seat with increased votes across the county.\n\nIn Bandon Sinn Féin’s Rachel McCarthy took 7.45% of the vote, Sam Simpson took 1.62% of the vote in Bantry, and in Blarney John Stanton won 5.77% of first preferences.\n\nDonnchadh Ó Laoghaire won 6.39% of the poll in Carrigaline up on 5.92% in 2004, Seamus Coleman took 4.67% of the vote in Fermoy and Donal Kelleher took 3.43% of the vote in Kanturk where Sinn Féin did not run in 2004.\n\nIn Macroom Sinn Féin’s Des O’Grady won 6.45% of the vote. Sinn Féin didn’t run here in 2004. Willie O’Regan took 8.44% of the vote in Mallow, another county council ward Sinn Féin did not contest in 2004.\n\nSandra McClellan retained the Sinn Féin seat in Middleton with 10.04% of the vote and in Skibbereen Cionnaith Ó Suilleabhain tool 6.19% of the vote, mirroring his 2004 performance.\n\nCork Town Councils\n\nIn Bandon Rachel McCarthy held the Sinn Féin seat with 7.53% of the vote. Mary Horgan took 2.74% of the vote in Bantry, while in Clonakilty Sinn Féin ran two candidates, with Cionnaith Ó Suilleabhain getting elected on the first count but Sinn Féin couldn’t retain the two sets won in 2004 and Paul Hayes wasn’t elected. Sinn Féin won 14.5% of the vote here.\n\nIn Cobh Sinn Féin won a seat in 2004 with 8.35% of the vote. In 2009 Kieran McCarty was re-elected on the fourth count, but running mate Albert McGroarty as just short of the second seat with a total Sinn Féin vote of 10.99%.\n\nIn Fermoy Seamus Coleman held the Sinn Féin seat with 4.62% of the vote, while In Kinsale Sinn Féin’s Noel Harrington won a new seat with 8.07% of the vote. Sinn Féin didn’t contest these town council in 2004.\n\nIn Macroom, Dermot O’Donovan polled 2.26% of the vote, while in Mallow where Sinn Fein won a seat in 2004, two candidates were fielded in 2009. Willie O’Regan retained his seat but second party representative Stella O’Sullivan didn’t make the second seat. Sinn Fein won 10.55% of the vote in 2009 compared to 9.16% in 2004.\n\nIn Midleton Sinn Féin won a seat here in 2004 with 4.99% of the vote. The party ran two candidates in 2009 with Pat Buckley being elected on the third count. Gerry O’Sullivan wasn’t elected and the party vote share more than doubled to 11.13%.\n\nIn Passage West, Sinn Féin retained their seat with 8.75% of the vote and Michael Frick Murphy was elected. Also in Skibereeen, Donnachadh O Seaghdha retained the Sinn Féin seat with 9.05% of the vote up on 2004, while in Youghal Sandra McClellan and Michelle Hennessy held the two Sinn Féin seats. McClellan was elected on the first count and Hennessy on the seventh.\n\nDonegal County Council\n\nSinn Féin’s vote share on Donegal County Council was at 13% in 2009, almost unchanged from 2004.\n\nIn the Donegal County Council ward, Jim McLaughlin took 6.51% of the vote, not enough to win a seat. In Glenties, Maire Therese Gallagher and John Ó Fearraigh took 15.82% of the vote, an increase on the 13.2% won by Pearse Doherty in 2004. Gallagher took a seat for Sinn Féin on the eighth count.\n\nPádraig Mac Lochlainn and Seán Ruddy ran for Sinn Féin in the Inishowen ward. Together they polled 17.42% of the vote, up on the 15.36% won in 2004. Mac Lochlainn topped the poll and was elected on the first count. His transfers could not pull in Ruddy for the second seat.\n\nIn Letterkenny, Mick Quinn was elected on the 10th count with 8.26% of the vote. Over in Stranorlar, Cora Harvey topped the poll and was elected on the first count with 19.04% of the vote.\n\nDonegal\n\nRosaleen Branley retained the seat formerly won by her father on Ballyshannon Town Council. PJ Branley died in a tragic car accident in 2008. Rosaleen topped the poll in the council with 15% of the vote.\n\nPádraig Mac Lochlainn and Darren Lalor retained their seats on Buncrana Town Council but could not go the extra mile and bring in the third Sinn Féin candidate, Ciarán McGuinness, even though Mac Lochlainn topped the poll here also.\n\nIn Bundoran, Sinn Féin did add an extra seat and Arthur Rafferty joins sitting Sinn Féin Cllr Michael McMahon on the town council. In Letterkenny, Sinn Féin’s Gerry McMonagle retained the seat he won in 2004.\n\nDublin City Council\n\nThe Leinster House breakthrough in 2002, where Sinn Féin won two Dáil seats in Dublin, narrowly missing out on a third for Dessie Ellis in Dublin North-West, was followed up by watershed elections in 2004, where on Dublin City Council Sinn Féin won 10 seats. Holding these was always going to be a serious challenge.\n\nOrganisational transition throughout the party in the city, boundary changes and a hostile print and broadcast media ignoring the party’s work on the doorsteps and in the council made the success in holding seven Sinn Féin seats all the more impressive, especially in the context of a campaign of hostile reporting targeted at Dublin South-East Cllr Daithí Doolan.\n\nIn the week before the election, the seven daily newspapers chose to ignore many of the party’s campaign activities and focus instead on the unfounded claims that Sinn Féin activists had burned the car of an electoral rival to Daithí Doolan.\n\nThis non-story made the front page of the capital’s only evening newspaper, the Evening Herald as “SF bullies smash up rival’s car”. The following day it was reported as “Sinn Féin accused over car damage” in the Independent; it was “SF election opponent’s car vandalised” in the Times; and “Terrorised by my brother’s killers” in the Mirror. The Star reported the story least negatively with a “Sinn Féin condemns attack”.\n\nEven after the election, the Evening Herald has maintained its campaign against the party, running a headline on 8 June “Why most of us still see SF as revolting”. None of this can take away an impressive performance by the party in the capital, taking 12% of the total city vote, in the face of such stern challenges.\n\nIn Artane/Whitehall, Cllr Larry O’Toole topped the poll again for Sinn Féin, where the party took 22.35% of first preferences. Sinn Féin ran two candidates here but Denise Mitchell’s 930 votes were not enough to take a second seat for the party.\n\nLouise Minihan was elected on the eighth count in Ballyfermot/Drimnagh with 13.67% of the vote. In Ballymun/Finglas, Cllr Dessie Ellis was elected on the first count but a strong showing by Cllr Ray Corcoran of 1,190 votes could not hold a second seat for the party here even though Sinn Féin had 26.6% of the first-preferences. Only the Labour Party at 31.6% registered a better first-preference share.\n\nSeamus McGrattan had to wait until late on Sunday in Cabra/Glasnevin after a stop-start election count, with recounts and challenges demanded by Fianna Fáil, as Maurice Ahern lost his council seat. McGrattan was elected on the ninth count, notching up 9.6% of first-preferences.\n\nHelen McCormack took 3.9% of the first preferences in Contarf. On the other side of the city, in Crumlin/Kimmage, Ray McHugh could not hold the Sinn Féin seat won in 2004. McHugh had 8.7% of the first-preferences.\n\nBack over on the northside, in Donaghmede, Cllr Killian Forde was re-elected on the seventh count with 16.1% of the vote, just below his 2004 vote share. Sinn Féin ran two candidates in the North City: Christy Burke and Ruadhán Mac Aodháin. Burke held the seat and Sinn Féin took 15.6% of the vote here.\n\nIn the south of the city, Oisín Ó Dubhláin won 1.7% of the vote in Pembroke/Rathmines while in the South-East Inner City Daithí Doolan lost his seat, polling 11.9% of the vote.\n\nCríona Ní Dhálaigh was elected on the seventh count to the South-West Inner City ward with 12.2% of the vote.\n\nDún Laoghaire/Rathdown\n\nSinn Féin have still not cracked this council. In the Ballybrack ward, Eoin Ó Broin polled 3.6% of the first preferences. Oonagh O’Reilly also took 3.6% of the vote in the Dundrum ward.

Byrne was also trying for a seat on Balbriggan Town Council but didn’t get elected.\n\nCharlie Maples won 3.6% of the votes in the Castleknock ward. Colm Ó Murchadha took 2.9% in the Howth/Malahide ward.\n\nIn Mulhuddart, Sinn Féin Cllr Paul Donnelly’s 11.4% of first-preferences was not enough to hold this council seat for Sinn Féin. In Swords, Conor Kelly won 4.6% of the vote. Across Fingal, Sinn Féin took 5% of the total vote.\n\nGalway City and County\n\nSinn Féin took 3% across the three Galway city wards.

In 2004, he took 9.7% of the vote and increased this to 12.7% in 2009.\n\nSinn Féin had two candidates in Connemara and Trevor Ó Clochartaigh and Kenneth Coyne shared 9.7% of the vote here. Anna Marley took 1.9% of the vote in Oranmore while, in Tuam, Grainne Morahan won 1.5% of the vote.\n\nJason Devlin held the Sinn Féin seat on Ballinasloe Town Council.
