In all but two cases, she cannot trace their burial records.\n\nFebruary 2014\n\nThe Connacht Tribune publishes an interview with Ms Corless about her campaign for a permanent memorial for the Tuam babies, including a plaque displaying all 796 infants' names.\n\nMay 2014\n\nThe Irish Mail on Sunday publishes a story claiming there are fears up to 800 babies were secretly buried in a \"mass grave\" at the home in Tuam. This time the story gains international attention.\n\nJune 2014\n\nFollowing weeks of speculation over the fate of the Tuam babies, the Irish government orders a nationwide commission of investigation into Ireland's mother and baby homes.\n\nAnnouncing the move, the then Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Enda Kenny says babies born to unmarried parents were treated as \"an inferior sub-species\" for decades in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nJanuary 2015\n\nUnder its terms of reference, the commission is tasked with investigating practices in Irish mother and baby homes over a 76-year period, from the foundation of the state in 1922 through to 1998.\n\nThe panel is asked to examine the living conditions in the homes as well as mortality rates; general causes of death among residents, burial arrangements and participation in vaccine trials.\n\nThey were also tasked with investigating adoption processes in the homes, including whether or not birth mothers were able to give \"full, free and informed\" consent for their children to be adopted.\n\nOctober 2016\n\nThe commission of investigation begins test excavations at the site of the former mother and baby home in Tuam.\n\n4 March 2017\n\nThe commission confirms that \"significant quantities of human remains\" have been found during excavations at the site in Tuam and says its is \"shocked\" by the discovery.\n\nTests on a small number of remains establish that they were children ranging in age from premature babies to three-year-old toddlers, all of whom died while the mother and baby home was in operation.\n\nThe remains were found in a large underground \"structure\" which was divided into 20 chambers.\n\nThe commission says the structure \"appears to be related\" to the treatment or storage of sewage or waste water but adds it has not yet established if it was ever used for that purpose.\n\n7 March 2017\n\nTaoiseach Enda Kenny describes the burial site as a \"chamber of horrors\".\n\nHe says he will await further work from the commission, coroner, and Gardaí (police) before deciding how to proceed.\n\nFebruary 2018\n\nThe commission appeals to the public for information about the burials of a \"large number of children who died while resident\" in Bessborough mother and baby home in Cork.\n\nApril 2018\n\nCatherine Corless is among those honoured at Ireland's People of the Year Awards - just one of several high-profile honours she receives for her work to uncover the truth about the Tuam burials.\n\nOctober 2018\n\nMinister for Children Katherine Zappone announces plans for a forensic excavation of the Tuam site, saying the remains of each child will be exhumed, identified and given a \"respectful\" reburial.\n\nMarch 2019\n\nThe commission outlines its conclusions on burial arrangements at the homes in its fifth interim report.\n\nIts report states that a total of 802 children died inside the Tuam home during its 36 years in operation.\n\nIn addition, 12 mothers died while resident at the home, the majority from childbirth complications.\n\nThe commission says the human remains it found in 2016/2017 \"are not in a sewage tank, but in a second structure with 20 chambers which was built within the decommissioned large sewage tank\".\n\nThe report says the precise purpose of the chamber structure has still not been established, but it is \"likely to be related to the treatment/containment of sewage and/or waste water\".\n\nThe commission dates this second structure to about 1937 and says: \"It seems clear that many of the children who died in the Tuam Home are buried in the chambers described.\"\n\nIt also dismisses theories that the structure may have been purpose-built burial chamber or crypt, saying it \"did not provide for the dignified interment of human remains\".\n\nThe report adds it has not been possible to establish who physically buried the infants but it \"seems likely that the burials were conducted on the instructions\" of the Bon Secours Sisters.\n\nThe nuns' representative had already told the inquiry that the order was \"shocked and devastated\" by the revelations and apologised \"unreservedly\" for the failure to provide proper burials.\n\nSeparately, the fifth report states that more than 900 children died while resident at Bessborough mother and baby home in Cork, but it is still not known where the vast majority are buried.\n\nDespite \"very extensive inquiries and searches\", the commission says it has established the burial place of only 64 of these children.\n\nOctober 2020\n\nFormer residents raise concerns over a new law which they fear could block access to much of the information collected by the commission.\n\nTheir campaign warns that many documents could be sealed in national archives for 30 years.\n\nHowever, the government insists that \"urgent legislation\" is required to protect the information from having to be destroyed or redacted when the commission is legally dissolved after its final report.\n\nMinister for Children Roderic O'Gorman explains that the commission has developed databases which could assist family tracing services, but because they contain sensitive personal information, the commission felt obliged to redact \"identifying\" details from its databases before transfer.\n\nThe minister says the new legislation allows a copy of the databases to be given to the child and family agency Tusla to assist family tracing, while the \"main archive\" can be deposited in line with the 2004 legislation under which the commission was set up.\n\nThe bill is fast-tracked through the Dáil (Irish parliament), infuriating former residents.\n\n25 October 2020\n\nIrish President Michael D Higgins signs the bill on mother and baby home records into law.\n\nHe notes that the bill raised important concerns \"which must be addressed\" but he concludes that it does not require referral to the Supreme Court for judgement on its constitutionality.\n\nHowever, a statement from the president's office says his decision to sign this legislation \"leaves it open to any citizen to challenge the provisions of the bill in the future\".\n\n10 January 2021\n\n12 January 2021\n\nThe inquiry concludes that about 9,000 children died in the 18 institutions under investigation - about 15% of all the children who lived in the homes.\n\nThe commission makes 53 recommendations, including compensation and memorialisation.\n\nAn umbrella group representing survivors of Mother and Baby Homes say they have \"mixed feelings about the long overdue report\".\n\nThe Coalition of Mother and Baby Home Survivors says: \"This report is fundamentally incomplete as it ignores the larger issue of the forced separation of single mothers and their babies since the foundation of the state as a matter of state policy.\"\n\n13 January 2021\n\nIn response to the final report, the Sisters of Bon Secours offer their \"profound apologies\" to all the women and children who lived at the Tuam home, their families and to the people of Ireland.\n\nThe order admitted its nuns \"did not live up to our Christianity when running the home\".\n\n\"We acknowledge in particular that infants and children who died at the home were buried in a disrespectful and unacceptable way. For all that, we are deeply sorry,\" the sisters added.\n\nTheir spokesman confirmed that the order will take part in a redress scheme.\n\nLater the Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Mícheál Martin issues a formal apology to former residents of mother and baby homes on behalf of the state.\n\nIn a statement to the Dáil (Irish parliament), he says a \"profound generational wrong\" had been visited on women and children who were sent to the institutions.\n\n\"We had a completely warped attitude to sexuality and intimacy, and young mothers and their sons and daughters were forced to pay a terrible price for that dysfunction,\" the taoiseach said."
