        "text": "Sinn Féin’s Affordable Homes Plan will bring homeownership back into reach for working people. It will also deliver affordable homes to rent. This means a home of your own that ordinary workers can afford.\n\nThis is the first part of our comprehensive housing plan which we will be launching in September.\n\nWe are driven by our belief that everyone deserves a good, safe, affordable home and that you need strong decisive intervention from the state to deliver those homes. That is what Sinn Féin will do.\n\nBack to school costs are far too high and many families are under real financial pressure trying to cover the price of uniforms, books, voluntary contributions and digital devices.\n\nSinn Féin’s plan will make education affordable by easing the burden of back-to-school costs for parents already struggling with the cost of living."
