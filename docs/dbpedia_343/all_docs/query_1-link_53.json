        "text": "Protected Disclosures and Policy and Procedures\n\nMaking a protected disclosure is also known as “whistleblowing”. A Protected Disclosure is defined in the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 as a disclosure of information which, in the reasonable belief of the worker, tend to show one or more 'relevant wrongdoings', which came to the attention of the worker in connection with the worker's employment and is disclosed in the manner prescribed in the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.\n\nThe Chief Executive of Galway City Council has appointed Helen Kilroy, Director of Corporate Development as the designated person for receipt of reporting of protected disclosures.\n\nContact Details to make a protected disclosure: Email: ProtectedDisclosures@GalwayCity.ie By Phone: 091 536871 or in writing to the above named: Galway City Council, City Hall, College Road, Galway H91 X4K8.\n\nInternal Reporting of Protected Disclosures\n\nThe Protected Disclosures Act 2014 was introduced to allow workers to disclose information about wrongdoing in the workplace by making sure workers who speak up are protected from penalisation. The Act also provided internal, external and regulatory ways to make a disclosure.\n\nIn 2019, the European Union adopted Directive 2019/1937 on the protections of persons who report breaches of Union Law and amendment to the existing legislation was required to implement the Directive's provisions. Updated legislation was also require to take account of the GDPR and amended Freedom of Information legislation. Consequently, the Protected Disclosures (Amendment) Act 2022 was signed into law on the 21st July 2022.\n\nThe primary purpose of the Protected Disclosures legislation is to promote and encourage the development of a positive workplace culture in which raising concerns regarding potential wrongdoing is valued and appropriate action is taken by public bodies in response to such disclosures.\n\nSpecifically the key objectives of the legislation are as follows:\n\nTo encourage workers to raise reasonable concerns regarding possible wrongdoing in the workplace so that these concerns can be addressed;\n\nTo underpin a working environment, the primary focus of which is on responding to the \"message\" (i.e. the report of wrongdoing) rather than on the \"messenger\" (i.e. the worker making the report).\n\nTo reinforce the legal requirement that public bodies should not penalise a worker who makes a protected disclosure;\n\nTo ensure that a competent and timely assessment and investigation of reports of wrongdoing takes place followed, where necessary, by an appropriate response.\n\nExternal Reporting of Protected Disclosures\n\nThese procedures below outline the process for making a protected disclosure on wrongdoing, as defined in the protected disclosures legislation, to the Chief Executive, Galway County Council as a prescribed person, using external reporting channels.\n\n‌\n\nAnnual Report of Galway City Council as required under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014\n\nGalway City Council confirms that no Protected Disclosures were received in 2023. Consequently no action was required to be taken by Galway City Council in relation to Protected Disclosures."
