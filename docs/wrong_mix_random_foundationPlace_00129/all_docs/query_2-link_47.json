        "text": "About this podcast\n\nOriginating as a tribute to 150 years of fisheries conservation, Season 1 followed co-hosts Katrina Liebich and Guy Eroh as they sought to unpack the diversity of Alaska’s fishes. Seasons 2-4 follow up as a true audio almanac to #ALLTHEFISH: a week-by-week tour of interesting American ichthyofauna with guests around the country from all walks of life. Listeners journey across America and beyond learning about fish that are big and small, common and rare, beautiful and downright strange. Diverse guests bring their perspectives about the latest fisheries science and how fish are woven into the fabric of communities and cultures across North America and beyond. The co-hosts bring their own excitement and humor to help listeners walk away from each episode smiling and with practical information and calls to action about how to live with, live from, discovery and enjoy our amazing finned friends.\n\nYour Co-Host/Fish Guides\n\nKatrina Liebich is a fish nerd and piscivore stationed in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Alaska Office of Communications.

A man on a mission, dedicated to conserving and fostering appreciation for all aquatic critters finned and gilled. He studied ecology and fisheries and the University of Georgia and has shared his enthusiasm for fish with colleagues from Alaska to Washington DC.\n\n2023 & 2024 finalist and 2022 winner of \"Best Podcast\"at Golden Posts, given out by the Government Social Media Association, citing its \"mix of expertise with humor\" to create a podcast that \"focuses on inclusivity and human-fish connections.\" 2024 Anthem Award Bronze winner for podcast or audio show that aims to raise awareness for Sustainability, Environment, & Climate Causes."
