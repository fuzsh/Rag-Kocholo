        "text": "Clorion. [Anatomical illustrations]. (New Harmony, 1830).\n\n\"Clorion\" was a pseudonym used by the creator of this anatomical sketchbook in New Harmony, Indiana, in 1830. It was apparently copied from The Medical Adviser and Domestic Physician, possibly a journal, published in London in 1830; unfortunately, no extant copies of the printed version can be located.\n\nHarmonie, Indiana, was founded in 1814 when Separatists from the German Lutheran Church left their home in Harmonie, Pennsylvania, led by charismatic religious leader Johann Georg Rapp. In 1825, these settlers left to found the town of Economy, Pennsylvania, selling the Indiana site to social reformer Robert Owen, who founded a utopian communitarian settlement there called New Harmony.\n\nA number of important scientists, well-known naturalists, and accomplished artists including Thomas Say, Charles Alexander Lesueur, Constantine Samuel Rafinesque, and Gerald Troost lived in or visited New Harmony during the Owen Period. Robert Owen's sons Robert Dale, David Dale, and Ricard were all excellent artists. The young man also studied medicine. Linda Warrum, an interpreter for the University of Southern Indiana/Historic New Harmony, has written an article published by the Indiana Magazine of History. With the expert help of document examiner Stephen McKasson, Warrum has unraveled a mystery that has puzzled researchers for decades. In \"The Chase for Clorion\" McKasson uses his experience as a handwriting analyst to determine that the series of anatomical sketches were in fact signed by Martha Chase Owen, Richard Owen's first wife using the pseudonym Clorion.\n\nThe vivacious, headstrong Martha was an excellent artist, musician, and teacher. Although Warrum's article proves that Martha signed the work as Clorion, the reason behind the name is still a mystery. Although not available to the general public, there are several drawings by Martha Chase Owen in New Harmony's Owen Archives which attest to her great talent.\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nKimberling, Clark. \"New Harmony scientists, educators, writers and artists.\""
