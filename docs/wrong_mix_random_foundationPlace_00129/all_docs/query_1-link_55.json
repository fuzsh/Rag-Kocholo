        "text": "There were only four things I didn't like about John James Audubon: The Making of an American (2004) by Richard Rhodes. One of those was the title; it has little bearing on the biographical construction. Other than the title and a couple, minor, pesky things, this 500-page volume was wholly captivating, twice.\n\nThere must be 30 other books that detail Audubon's life and another 200 that address his artwork. But Rhodes, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, in the fashion of Evan Connell's Son of the Morning Star, gleans and crystallizes the best of all those works and provides especially meaningful context to some information previously given fairly scant attention. What emerged was an amazingly vivid and fairly candid account of the life of the man generally recognized and revered as among history's foremost wildlife artists. As no other, Audubon moved wildlife art from the pedestrian discipline of illustration to an acknowledged fine art genre. But that's the fodder of about 230 other books. Rhodes' narrative uniquely puts Audubon's character ahead of his craft, although the latter certainly is not ignored.\n\nWhat I liked most about this book is that it provides excellent historical perspective. Readers are given an honest glimpse of Audubon's time and place in America.\n\nA dashing 18-year-old, \"of fair mien and quite a handsome figure,\" by his own account, Jean-Jacques Foug?re Audubon arrived in New York City in 1803, barely escaping conscription into Napoleon's army. He arrived with a fascination for bird life, a penchant for drawing, an insatiable curiosity and an affinity for wilderness. Described by others as excitable, vivacious, charismatic, and musically and athletically talented, Audubon's baggage included the secret of his being the bastard son of a French naval officer and a chambermaid, a much more onerous stigma in yesteryear than today. Despite remaining \"Frenchy as thunder,\" he and his largely self-taught accomplishments were American.\n\nWhile back in Europe in 1827, Audubon was received by none other than Sir Walter Scott, who subsequently provided a very telling description of the artist: \"He is an American by naturalization, a Frenchman by birth, but less of a Frenchman than I have ever seen?no dash, no glimmer or shine about him, but great simplicity of manners and behavior; slight in person and plainly dressed; wears long hair which time has not yet tinged; his countenance acute, handsome and interesting, but still simplicity is the predominant characteristic.\"\n\nUntil his death almost forty-eight years later, victimized by dementia, Audubon?the husband of Lucy Bakewell and father of Lucy, John Woodhouse and Victor Gifford? Audubon lived a most extraordinary life. His Birds of America may have done as much to advance and popularize ornithology as any scientific achievement to that time. It gave Audubon desired celebrity; it also provided him and his family needed wealth. Neither was easily or readily gained."
