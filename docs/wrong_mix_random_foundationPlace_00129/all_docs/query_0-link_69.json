        "text": "https://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780190647926.013.198 In ancient Mesopotamia, all five planets visible to the naked eye were known and studied, along with the Moon, the Sun, the stars, and other celestial phenomena. In all Mesopotamian sources concerning the Moon and the planets, be they textual or icono­graphical, the astronomical, astrological, and religious aspects are intertwined. The term “astral science” covers all forms of Mesopotamian scholarly engagement with celestial entities, including celestial divination and astrology. Modern research on Mesopotamian astral science began in the 19th century. Much research remains to be done, because im­portant sources remain unpublished and new questions have been posed to published sources.\n\nA large number of the astronomical observations in the Babylonian diaries are occurrences of close conjunctions of moving objects, such as the Moon or planets with bright stars, in the vicinity of the ecliptic. In , Graßhoff proposed the hypothesis that the observations fit best when one assumes that the Babylonians used an ecliptical coordinate system. In the following we present a test that excludes an equatorial coordinate system as an alternative system of measurement. Ein Großteil der astronomischen Beobachtungen in den Babylonischen Tagebüchern han-delt von Konjunktionsereignissen sich bewegender Objekte, wie dem Mond oder Planeten mit hellen Sternen in der Nähe der Ekliptik. argumentierte Graßhoff, dass die Beob-achtungen am meisten Sinn ergäben, wenn man davon ausginge, dass die Babylonier ein ekliptikales Koordinatensystem nutzten. Im Folgenden stellen wir einen Test vor, der ein äquatoriales Koordinatensystem als alternatives Messsystem ausschließt.\n\nThe year 1881 marks the birth of Babylonian astronomy as a modern area of scholarship with the first publication about this topic. From the outset, its scholarly practices were based on a variety of methods rooted in Assyriology, astronomy, mathematics and the history of science. In this chapter, the editing practices that were applied to Babylonian astronomical texts and their relationship to research methods in the abovementioned disciplines are traced through the works of the main scholars who were active in the field of Babylonian astronomy between 1881 and 1955. In this period, two phases can be distinguished: a pioneering phase (1881–1935) in which mainly individual tablets were edited while editing practices remained fluid, and a subsequent phase characterized by the appearance of standard editions of complete and coherent corpora of texts. In both phases, the translations and interpretations were strongly shaped by modern mathematics and astronomy."
