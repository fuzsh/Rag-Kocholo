        "text": "Thomas Say (1787-1834)\n\nAmerican entomology, or Descriptions of the insects of North America:\n\nillustrated by coloured figures from original drawings executed from nature\n\nAs a boy, Thomas Say, born into a prominent Quaker family in Philadelphia, often visited the family garden, Bartram’s Garden, where he could take butterfly and beetle specimens to his great-uncle William.\n\nA self-taught naturalist, he became an apothecary, and helped found the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia in 1812.\n\nHe served as librarian for the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, curator at the American Philosophical Society, and professor of natural history at the University of Pennsylvania\n\nIn 1816, he met Charles Alexandre Lesueur, a French naturalist, malacologist, and ichthyologist who soon became a member of the Academy and served as its curator until 1824.\n\nTo collect insects, Say made expeditions to the frontier, in spite of the risk of attacks by American Indians and the hazards of traveling in wild countryside.\n\nIn 1818, Say accompanied his friend William Maclure, then the ANSP president and father of American geology; Gerhard Troost, a geologist; and other members of the Academy on a geological expedition to the off-shore islands of Georgia and Florida, then a Spanish colony.\n\nIn 1819–20, Major Stephen Harriman Long led an exploration to the Rocky Mountains and the tributaries of the Missouri River, with Say as zoologist.\n\nTheir official account of this expedition included the first descriptions of the coyote, swift fox, western kingbird, band-tailed pigeon, rock wren, Say’s phoebe, lesser goldfinch, lark sparrow, lazuli bunting, and orange-crowned warbler.\n\nIn 1823, Say served as chief zoologist in Long’s expedition to the headwaters of the Mississippi River.\n\nHe traveled on the “Boatload of Knowledge” to the New Harmony Settlement in Indiana (1826–34), a utopian society experiment founded by Robert Owen.\n\nHe was accompanied by Maclure, Lesueur, Troost, and Francis Neef, an innovative education reformer.\n\nThere he later met Constantine Samuel Rafinesque-Schmaltz, another naturalist.\n\nSay married Lucy Way Sistare, whom he had met as one of the passengers to New Harmony, near the settlement.\n\nShe was an artist and illustrator of specimens, as in the book American Conchology, and was elected as the first woman member of the Academy of Natural Sciences\n\nSay was a modest and unassuming man, who lived frugally, like a hermit, in New Harmony. He abandoned commercial activities and devoted himself to his studies.\n\nHe died, apparently from typhoid fever, when he was 47 years old.\n\nThe quality of the plates, in his book on American insects, and the clarity of Say’s description won him immediate fame abroad, and he was made a foreign member of the Linnean Society of London.\n\nSay named some 1,500 new species – many of his discoveries (such as the American dog tick) were crucial for the future study and control of disease in humans, livestock and crops\n\nW\n\nhttp://www.abaa.org/book/844565199\n\nJoris Hoefnagel (1524 – 1601)\n\nSharp Decline of the Monarch Butterfly\n\nA new census found this winter’s population of North American monarch butterflies in Mexico was at the lowest level ever measured. University of Kansas insect ecologist Orley R. Taylor talks to Yale Environment 360 about how the planting of genetically modified crops and the resulting use of herbicides has contributed to the monarchs’ decline.\n\nTaylor talked about the factors that have led to the sharp drop in the monarch population. Among them is the increased planting of genetically modified corn in the U.S. Midwest, which has led to greater use of herbicides, which in turn kills the milkweed that is a prime food source for the butterflies.\n\n“What we’re seeing here in the United States,” he said, “is a very precipitous decline of monarchs that’s coincident with the adoption of Roundup-ready corn and soybeans.\n\nThe glyphosate used in agriculture has tripled since 1997, when they first introduced these Roundup-ready crops. The developers of these crops not only provided the seeds that were glyphosate-resistant, but they also provided the glyphosate — the Roundup. And, boy, that was a pretty good system. You could make money on both, right?\n\nIt’s a collateral damage issue. And one of the things that we’re worried about now is that it looks like there’s going to be a lot of collateral damage from the use of various herbicides and pesticides coming down.’\n\nhttp://e360.yale.edu/feature/tracking_the_causes_of_sharp__decline_of_the_monarch_butterfly/2634/\n\nIn fact, insects such as butterflies, moths, bumblebees and mayflies have been disappearing for a long time, although hardly anyone except specialists has noticed or cared . . . http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/michael-mccarthy-this-isnt-just-about-bees-ndash-it-affects-everything-2189269.html\n\nhttps://secretgardening.wordpress.com/2011/01/20/bees-facing-a-poisoned-spring/\n\nErasmus Darwin (1731 – 1802) was an English physician who turned down George III’s invitation to be a physician to the King.\n\nHe formed the Lichfield Botanical Society in order to translate the works of the Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus from Latin into English: A System of Vegetables and The Families of Plants, in which he coined many of the English names of plants that we use today.\n\nDarwin then wrote The Loves of the Plants, a long poem which was a popular rendering of Linnaeus’ works, and Economy of Vegetation, and together the two were published as The Botanic Garden.\n\nDarwin’s final long poem, The Temple of Nature, centers on his own conception of evolution and traces the progression of life from micro-organisms to civilized society.\n\nHe established a lifelong friendship with Benjamin Franklin and shared his support for the American and French revolutions, he endorsed a proper education for women, and along with other members of the Lunar Society he opposed the slave trade.\n\nHis experiments in galvanism were an important source of inspiration when Mary Shelley wrote “Frankenstein.”\n\nCosmological speculation of Erasmus Darwin:\n\nRoll on, ye Stars! exult in youthful prime,\n\nMark with bright curves the printless steps of Time;\n\nNear and more near your beamy cars approach,\n\nAnd lessening orbs on lessening orbs encroach; —\n\nFlowers of the sky! ye too to age must yield,\n\nFrail as your silken sisters of the field!\n\nStar after star from Heaven’s high arch shall rush,\n\nSuns sink on suns, and systems systems crush,\n\nHeadlong, extinct, to one dark center fall,\n\nAnd Death and Night and Chaos mingle all!\n\n— Till o’er the wreck, emerging from the storm,\n\nImmortal Nature lifts her changeful form,\n\nMounts from her funeral pyre on wings of flame,\n\nAnd soars and shines, another and the same."
