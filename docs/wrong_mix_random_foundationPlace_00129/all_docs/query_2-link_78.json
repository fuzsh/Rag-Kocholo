        "text": "Mount Rafinesque has not ever been part of Lansingburgh, though the westernmost part of it had been part of the Patent of Stone Arabia and Mount Rafinesque had been frequently visited by people from Lansingburgh. As noted in Warren Broderick’s article, quoted and linked below, it had at times been called Lansingburgh Mountain and was given the name Mount Rafinesque on the suggestion of Alexander Walsh of Lansingburgh.\n\nWhile in the area, [Constantine] Rafinesque visited Alexander Walsh (1783-1849), a prominent horticulturist who resided in Lansingburgh. Rafinesque stayed with him for a few days and “went to visit many remarkable places” near Lansingburgh. Rafinesque also met the Rev. Elijah Wiley, the minister of the local Baptist Church, who led the naturalist on a hike to the local landmark a few miles to the east, then known as Bald Mountain. Despite its prominence, the mountain had never been given a formal name; it was known at various times as Lansingburgh Mountain, Mount Washington, or more frequently Bald Mountain. Rafinesque later recalled his visit in A Life of Travels and Researches in North America:\n\n“I ascended the Bald mt. 4 miles east of [Lansingburgh], which is not on the maps altho’ 1030 feet high; I surveyed it, and explored the plants and minerals of it. As there are many mts. of that name, Mr. W. proposed to change it to Mt. Rafinesque. It is an insulated mt. wild and wooded except on the summit. It is primitive and transitive like the mts. Taconick in the neighborhood. It is visible afar, and is 10 or 12 miles in circuit.”\n\nFrom this time forward, the peak would be known as Mount Rafinesque, in honor of its distinguished visitor. On August 10, the Editor of the Waterford Atlas led the first expedition to the newly named summit, until then taken for granted by its neighbors but now given celebrity status by the colorful and distinguished scientist from Philadelphia. The editor of the Atlas and his companions, noted his paper, experienced the “most awfully grand and sublime…sight” they had ever witnessed. It urged “every soul of suitable years…male and female…to make the experiment of this grand ascension” of the mountain. “Go simply attired, and the most delicate will be able to surmount every obstacle, and reach the summit in safety.” Other expeditions, led by persons in Lansingburgh and Waterford, followed that summer and autumn. The Atlas commented that it “highly approved” renaming the local landmark as a “deserved compliment to the distinguished naturalist, Professor Rafinesque, who first directed public attention to it.”\n\nBroderick, Warren F. “A Mountain With an Unusual Name.” Hudson River Valley Review 21(2).

It caught in the pines, and, as the wind was blowing briskly at the time, it gained considerable headway before the discovery. The trees were dry and caught readily, and it was feared that not only all the woods on the mountain, but many buildings in the vicinity, would be destroyed. The farmers turned out in full force, and were engaged fighting the flames all the afternoon and evening. The barn of Jacob Hayner was threatened at one time, but was saved by considerable effort. The United States coast survey pole, erected some time ago, was burned down. The turf was very dry, and the fire spread rapidly through it in many places unnoticed, until it burst out in a blaze in some new locality. It is supposed the woods became ignited from the burning turf, the flames starting at the railroad track or in the vicinity. The fire is still burning, but the extent of the damage is unknown. At an early hour last evening it made a very bright light, and was plainly discernible from this city. During the afternoon a fire caught in the woods near the north end of Lansingburgh. This was extinguished, however, before any damage had been done.\n\nTroy Weekly Times.
