        "text": "Since its initial theatrical release 45 years ago, on December 26, 1973, The Exorcist has remained among the highest grossing horror movies of all time. The first horror movie to be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, this seminal classic fundamentally altered the genre irrevocably. Centered on a possessed teen girl and a priest suffering a crisis of faith, The Exorcist became the standard by which most horror films that followed were judged, in terms of scare factor, anyway. Not only did every possession film that came after draw inspiration from this film, but it spawned multiple sequels, prequels, television series, theatrical re-releases and more in its four-decade-long legacy. The original, true-story exorcism story that inspired author William Peter Blatty’s novel, tales of a curse plaguing the set of the film, and many other details surrounding The Exorcist have long been uncovered already. But here are 10 things you might not know about this horror classic:\n\nRosemary’s Baby paved the way for The Exorcist\n\nHaving embraced religion from a young age, and deeply inspired by the 1949 case about a possessed boy in Mount Rainier, Maryland since his college days, author William Peter Blatty really wanted to write a story inspired by the exorcism. Most mainstream movies tended to lean heavily for or against religion, though, making Blatty feel as though what he sought to do with his story would never fit mainstream ideals. However, when he saw Rosemary’s Baby in the theater he was inspired by the way the film turned the ambiguity and questions of faith and belief into a mainstream film. It was the push he needed, and he wrote the novel in a mere 10 months.\n\nWilliam Friedkin got the job because of William Peter Blatty\n\nBy now it’s likely well known that Friedkin wasn’t the first choice to direct. The studio approached the likes of Stanley Kubrick and Mike Nichols first, who both turned the project down. Then the studio eyed Mark Rydell. Blatty, however, pushed for Friedkin. Between Friedkin’s work on hit The French Connection, and Blatty’s assertiveness in getting his way, well, Friedkin got the job in large part to the screenwriter.\n\nWilliam Peter Blatty played dirty to get his way\n\nTypically, screenwriters don’t get so intertwined with the film. They write, and then it’s handed over from there. But no one was as invested in their story as Blatty, who was so passionate about The Exorcist and getting it correct. In Jason Zinoman’s novel Shock Value, it was revealed that Blatty actually snuck into producer Paul Monash’s office and went through his personal files until he found a paper trail revealing a deal with Warner Brothers that involved a completely restructured script. Blatty took that to his agent, who then went to Warner Brothers’ vice president, claiming false representation. Monash was removed from the project, and Blatty then became producer instead, his story once again intact.\n\nMercedes McCambridge provided the voice of Pazuzu\n\nOne of the most riveting performances in the film (among many stellar performances) is also one of the most unheralded. The demonic, possessed voice of Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) was performed by radio actor Mercedes McCambridge. Her radio acting skillset combined with her distinct voice, further made husky by insistence on drinking whiskey, chain-smoking, and swallowing raw eggs contributed to a terrifying performance. Having suffered from chronic bronchitis, McCambridge cleverly used her wheezing to create the bone-chilling breathing of Pazuzu. For a long while, McCambridge didn’t receive credit for her voiceover work; she didn’t want to take away from Blair’s performance according to Friedkin.\n\nFather Damien Karras was Jason Miller’s first film role\n\nAfter earning degrees in English and philosophy, Miller worked various odd jobs like welfare investigator, waiter, truck driver and messenger boy while writing plays. While he ultimately won a Pulitzer Prize for his play The Championship Season, the income wasn’t steady and he gave up professional writing for acting instead. The year he won his Pulitzer was the same in which he was offered the role of Father Damien Karras, the priest struggling with his faith. That role, his first in film, earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nThe projectile vomit scene took only one take\n\nIt’s now well known that the green vomit spewed by the possessed Regan was actually made up of pea soup. What’s not as well-known is that Miller’s horrified and disgusted reaction isn’t acting but genuine. Because it was real, the shot was nailed on one take. Originally, Regan’s projectile vomit was supposed to land squarely on Miller’s chest, but the tubing hose misfired, catching Miller off guard. It was a technical error that made Miller angry, he later confessed in interviews.\n\nMax von Sydow went through a lengthy aging makeup process for his role\n\nFather Merrin, the experienced veteran Catholic priest selected to perform the exorcism of 12-year-old Regan, is a 79-year-old with a weakened heart. At the time of filming, von Sydow was only 43. The actor underwent a 3-4 hour makeup application process every day to resemble the aged priest. Between the stellar makeup effects and von Sydow’s amazing portrayal of Merrin, it’s easy to forget how young the actor really was at the time.\n\nBlatty hates the movie’s ending\n\nDifferent views on how to handle the story meant a lot of tension between Friedkin and Blatty over the course of production. For Friedkin, he wanted a much more ambiguous story, one that left the viewer questioning the mysterious nature of the possession and the motivations. Blatty’s story, however, was much more explicit in its meaning. His novel spells out exactly why Regan was chosen and what Karras’ sacrifice meant. Friedkin’s ending made Blatty feel it would be interpreted that the Devil won, which was in extreme opposition to the point of his story.\n\nThe original theatrical release caused “cinematic neurosis”\n\nOver the holiday weekend that The Exorcist opened and the weeks that followed, visceral audience reactions swept the country. Fainting, vomiting, panic, and even reports of miscarriages and heart attacks lead to further reporting of panic and hysteria surrounding the film’s release. The frenzy was so publicized that it even lead to medical journalists giving a psychiatric name for the craze associated with the horror film, titled “cinematic neurosis.” To say that the film struck a nervous chord in America would be putting it mildly.\n\nThe Exorcist set the trend for the inevitable horror sequel\n\nWarner Brothers didn’t think the film would be a huge hit. They didn’t bother to screen it for critics and they only put it out in 30 theaters at first. They were proved wrong right away, when the film caught on like wildfire, quickly become the must-see movie of the year. Wanting to capitalize further on its success, Warner Brothers jumped on the opportunity to continue the story of Regan and Pazuzu with The Exorcist II, opening in 1977. While this sequel was panned and nowhere near as successful as its predecessor, Warner Brothers essentially pioneered the horror sequel as we know it today. Major horror films before, like Night of the Living Dead or Rosemary’s Baby hadn’t had any follow ups. The Exorcist II paved the way for the standard practice of the horror sequel.\n\nHurricanes are frightening all on on their own without having to involve a predatory animal. Yet Carlos Brooks’ Burning Bright not only features a Category 3 hurricane, a ferocious tiger is thrown in for added effect. Back when this film was first announced, its plot was met with laughter and doubt; the idea was as intriguing as it was ridiculous. Over time though, this suspenseful story of a girl, a boy, and a tiger has become a shining example of how to follow through on a high concept.\n\nTwo distinct yet equally uncontrollable forces are on display at the beginning of Burning Bright. As Hurricane Isabel builds a sense of foreboding in the background, a young woman finally confronts her family situation. The collegebound Kelly (Briana Evigan, Sorority Row) is making the difficult decision of leaving behind her autistic brother Tom (Charlie Tahan, Super Dark Times) when life catches her off guard again. Kelly’s plans are dashed after her late mother’s husband Johnny (Garret Dillahunt, Last House on the Left) steals the money intended for Tom’s new care. And for what? A wildlife ranch with the centerpiece being, of course, a former circus tiger deemed more evil than scary by Meat Loaf. The musician’s fulsome cameo feels nearly out of place in this film, but the character is a forceful reminder not to take the tiger lightly, even when the plot comes across as absurd.\n\nThere is no organic way to have a tiger present in this story, seeing as these creatures are exotic to most people. They don’t belong in, much less originate in a place like Florida. So there needs to be a bridge of some kind that brings these disparate elements together. And after assuming Johnny’s latest purchase would simply escape his enclosure and enter Kelly’s house, Burning Bright thinks outside the box even further by revealing the tiger was released. This plot development is both so nutty and so fiendish it sounds like something drummed up by EC Comics.\n\nThe film neither has nor needs time to ponder the whys and whats of the characters’ sudden predicament; like Kelly and Tom, Burning Bright is in survival mode. The director is instead too busy finding efficient ways to keep the momentum up and the audience engaged. Those forty-something minutes of a (big) cat and mouse game could have quickly gone south in less capable hands, but Brooks manages to avoid the worst possible outcome in these kinds of conceptual stories. That is, boring the audience by either desensitizing them to the threat or animal, or just being too repetitive.\n\nUnlike Alexandre Aja’s somewhat similar natural-horror film Crawl — the ’80s snake thriller Fair Game is an even closer match — Burning Bright doesn’t have the luxury of a dynamic venue (among other things). Kelly and Tom are very much sentenced to their home after it was sealed up with them inside. So there is a fair deal of the characters going around in circles here and revisiting the same parts of the house. In turn though, that story tightness becomes more and more intense as well as detectable on screen. The camera gets almost uncomfortably close and fixed on the actors’ faces, in particular when their rawest emotions are coming out in some form or another.\n\nEscaping the tiger would be easier than this film’s symbolism. Perhaps taking a page out of The Descent and other films like it, Burning Bright uses a deadly creature — albeit a non-fantastical one — to contextualize a personal dilemma. What’s missing is nuance, on account of the straightforward approach. There is no mistaking what is being communicated here as Kelly fights for hers and Tom’s life. That level of simple storytelling could maybe minimize the film’s impact, however, the uncomplicated route works well in this case. An allegory being precise is preferable to a poor one.\n\nBurning Bright would not be anywhere as effective without its leads. Charlie Tahan tends to be overlooked due to Tom being nonverbal, yet for his age, he turned in an impressive performance that is never ostentatious. Then there is Briana Evigan, a familiar face of 2000s horror, who is owed some credit for her character’s lasting impression. She requested the filmmakers give Kelly a personality touch-up so she would be more likable: “If you didn’t care about [her], why would you care if she survived?” And the work put into the protagonist pays off well. Yes, there is little delay before Burning Bright throws the brother and sister into the tiger pit that is now their home. However, it’s important to remember that Christine Coyle Johnson and Julie Prendiville Roux’s script doesn’t sacrifice character for action once the tiger shows up; the sibling relationship is always being explored. Every scene — especially ones with the tiger — deepens the personal story at the heart of the film, and paves the way for a rewarding and cathartic ending.\n\nThis isn’t a subtle film. Far from it. No, Burning Bright lays it on rather thick with traps both literal and metaphorical, which, by virtue of solid direction and performances, culminate into a worthwhile story of resilience. Apropos of thematic complexity, the film is still a far ways off from its namesake — William Blake’s poem The Tyger — but there are poetic moments here and there.\n\nHorror contemplates in great detail how young people handle inordinate situations and all of life’s unexpected challenges. While the genre forces characters of every age to face their fears, it is especially interested in how youths might fare in life-or-death scenarios.\n\nThe column Young Blood is dedicated to horror stories for and about teenagers, as well as other young folks on the brink of terror."
