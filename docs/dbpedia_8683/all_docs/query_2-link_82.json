        "text": "In November 2021 I rewatched The Exorcist and noticed my opinions had since changed in the time that had passed after writing this review. If you’d like, after checking this blog out you can read my thoughts from three years later here.\n\nStarring: Ellen Burstyn, Jason Miller, Linda Blair, Max von Sydow\n\nDirector: William Friedkin\n\nSynopsis: A young girl is possessed by Pazuzu and two priests are the only ones who can save her soul.\n\nI grew up hearing about how The Exorcist is the “scariest film of all time” and how when this film was released in 1973 you’d see priests outside the cinema pleading with the general public to not see this evil film. When you’ve sat through the first half hour of Friedkin’s adaptation of William Peter Blatty’s 1971 novel, you’ll think they were trying to do you a favour in regards to saving money rather than in regards to protecting your religion.\n\nThe Exorcist is just under two hours long, and eighty minutes of it is quite good, but the opening forty minutes are very poor. There are several attempts to unnerve us, as the film starts in Northern Iraq where Lankester Merrin (Max von Sydow) is doing architectural work and discovers a charm representative of Pazuzu. Next thing you know we’re seeing him staring at a daunting statue while two dogs fight one another in the background. This opening scene takes twelve minutes and with the exception of this thirty-second scene, its really pointless. It hardly serves as an introduction to Merrin for later in the film, doesn’t exactly explain the seriousness of Pazuzu, and everything else has minor relevance to the rest of the plot.\n\nWe’re then transported to Georgetown where we stay for the rest of the film and are introduced to Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn), an actress and single mother who appears to have a healthy relationship with her daughter, Regan (Linda Blair). Chris is portrayed as a loving mother, Regan as a loving daughter. They laugh and have fun playing on a Ouija board, they embrace, they mess about when Regan asks for a horse. It’s cleverly included so we don’t get frustrated with Chris later on when she’s shouting and swearing at people who are just trying to help. These scenes emphasise how much she evidently loves her daughter and it’s important to remember this as the film goes on. There’s little hints of what’s to come when we hear really loud rats in the attic – it turns out there aren’t any rats up there – and when Regan sleeps in her mother’s bed claiming “my bed was shaking.” Something is clearly afoot.\n\nBetween these scenes we meet Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller), who when not priesting is looking after his elderly Italian mother and exercising. I liked the character of Karras and thought he had some good moments in the film, particularly later on when he converses with Pazuzu during his initial exorcism attempt – there’s a really good back and forth between the two there that drifts between courtesy and contempt.\n\nIt’s not a bad film at this point, but when you watch something that’s been declared the “scariest film of all time”, you expect it to be consistently scary and while the scene in the hospital where Karras sees a lot of creepy looking and acting patients is far from pleasant, this film shouldn’t be taking so long to actually get going. Once it gets going though, it does become genuinely unsettling. When I say unsettling I’m not referring to the scenes where a possessed Regan spins her head around 180 degrees or vomits green slime, I’m talking about the scene where she first acts out of the ordinary, disrupting a party held by Chris with a look on her face that massively contrasts how joyful she’s been so far, bluntly telling an astronaut “you’re going to die up there.” It almost makes the slow start worth it because of how out-of-place and out of character it is. A few seconds later she’s urinating on the carpet, and then a moment or two after that she’s screaming in terror while he bed shakes uncontrollably. Pazuzu is now beginning to take control, and the film is finally on its way.\n\nAt this point everything escalates excessively for the next eighty minutes, but the next two scenes really stand out for me above everything else. Damien’s dream is one of the film’s most eerie moments, where he dreams of his mother walking up and down train station steps and we see quick clips of the charm found by Merrin, the fighting dogs and the face of Pazuzu that is hands down one of the most frightening shots in the horror genre. What follows this is the most uncomfortable scene I’ve personally ever watched in the history of cinema, where Regan is taken into hospital, diagnosed with a legion on the brain and operated on. This is too real of a scene and I still struggle to watch the syringe being stuck in Regan’s neck and see the blood squirting out of the tube – I’m not even someone who gets uneasy at the sight of needles and blood either.\n\nAfter we find out that there’s no legions whatsoever on Regan’s brain is when the acting of Burstyn and Blair and the work of the make-up and effects department of the film is highlighted. Pazuzu is in full control of Regan’s body and hearing a young girl screaming “It’s burning!” as she rocks back and forth uncontrollably isn’t a nice thing to watch. This scene (one of several) is a testament to how good Linda Blair was at conveying terror. Also great in their role is Mercedes McCambridge as the voice of Pazuzu, it’s absolute 10/10 voice-work and is so genuinely scathing and harrowing. Friedkin does a great job of implementing different ways to show how Regan is possessed and how powerful Pazuzu is, however, I don’t think there was any need for that scene with the Crucifix and it gets two thumbs down from me. I’m fully aware that religion was a much more important factor in people’s lives in the 1970s, but the film didn’t need this moment to make an impact. It’s there simply for the sake of being controversial in a film with more than enough controversy already.\n\nOne other dissatisfaction I had watching The Exorcist was the way Friedkin uses music. Now don’t get me wrong, the music used in this film is very good and the main theme is unquestionably one of the top two all-time horror themes, but my problem is the way it’s used as it always seems to play when there’s no need for it. In the first forty minutes there’s a scene where Chris walks down her street and it starts to randomly play. The music, as brilliant as it is, doesn’t create a scary atmosphere here, it just comes across as out-of-place because nothing we’ve seen so far has given any need for it and it playing doesn’t lead to anything directly after. What’s even more frustrating is that when there’s a scene where the music would fit perfectly, such as when Merrin receives the letter or when he arrives at the MacNeil home, it’s not used at all.\n\nAs for the final portion of the film with the exorcism itself, it’s most certainly one of the more unique scenes in the horror genre, but other than saving Regan and giving a redemption to Karras that I’m not 100% sure he actually needed, it doesn’t exactly achieve anything. If anything, the exorcism just highlights the strength and the resistance of Pazuzu, and with Karras shouting “take me!”, being possessed and jumping to his death, the demon isn’t definitively defeated. Regan may be saved, but there’s no winners in this instance, in the film or in the audience.\n\nThere’s a lot of good in The Exorcist, but for a film deemed “the scariest of all time”, the amount of bad is massively detrimental. The fact that it took me two sittings to finish the film because of the egregiously slow start speaks volumes. A horror film, even one that builds to the shock-horror, should have you hooked instantly and The Exorcist doesn’t do that.\n\nThis film should be so much better."
