        "text": "The Exorcist (1973)\n\nSometimes seeing a film for the first-time years of even decades after it is first released you can find yourself surprised when you find out when it was released even if you know the year. As horror fans, we often fall into the trap of assuming all our favourite classics were released either in the late Spring or mid-Autumn – although that might just be us applying the modern trend to years past. A perfect example of this is The Exorcist (1973), one of the most famous horror films of all time and carrying such a wonderful autumnal feeling – it was released the day after Christmas in 1973. Behind this most unseasonal of films was director William Friedkin, only two years after winning the Academy Award for Best Director for The French Connection (1971), with William Peter Blatty adapting his own bestselling 1971 novel of the same name. It starred Ellen Burstyn, Max von Sydow, Jason Miller, Lee J. Cobb, and defined the career of young actress Linda Blair playing the girl possessed. It became of the most critically acclaimed horror films of all time and its influence can be felt in the genre to this day, but how does it hold up having reached its forty-third birthday this past week?\n\nIs The Exorcist still scary? Yes, but it’s no longer scary for the reasons it was in 1973 – those same reasons it was one of the most terrifying films of the 1970s can result in some unintentional comedy moments nowadays. Instead there is a whole new level of terror to be found throughout the film, a much more subtly and unsettling fear that is missing from many of this films imitators from recent years that just try to recreate what made it scary in 1973. Even so, the atmosphere created by Friedkin’s oppressive atmosphere leaves you uneasy from the films Iraq set prologue. How many times have we seen the exact same scenario of some ancient evil being disturbed and released to wreak havoc on the modern world? Yet in The Exorcist there is no overt supernatural indications of what is going on, there is no dialogue for exposition – but we know there is something not entirely natural at work in these scenes.\n\nIt can be easy to forget that for the entire first act of The Exorcist is not a possession film but is much more akin to a haunted house film. All the usual trappings are there, the noises coming from the attic, objects moving seemingly of their own volition, an unsubstantial presence in the house seemingly communicating with someone. In your reviewer’s opinion, these are some of the best horror scenes in the film. Yet again there is nothing especially overt and certainly not the jump scares we have become so used to in both haunted house and possession films as of late. We see Chris (Ellen Burstyn) investigating scurrying sounds she believes to be rats in the attic and instead of the face in the darkness we would probably expect had the film been made today all we get is the candle she is holding flashing brightly and loudly for a second before revealing it was probably caused by a gust of air from the attic door being opened by another character. One of the films creepiest scenes comes when young Regan (Linda Blair) is showing her mother the Ouija board she found in the closet, in her communications with whom she calls ‘Captain Howdy’ (I don’t know why horror fans call the demon in the film by its proper name of Pazuzu instead of calling it Captain Howdy – the latter is a much scarier name for a demon) it is clear that there is someone or something on the other end of this conversation but again nothing is ever made explicit. This haunted house segment of the film ends with the first use by Regan of her demon voice with the chilling line “This hour is mine!”\n\nWith the second act the film moves into the territory of possession movie proper, but we still have a while to go yet before we get to any actual exorcising. What original horror we had from this part of the film is largely lost on modern audiences for reasons we’ll get too later. There is still plenty of horror to be had though in seeing just how you would check someone’s brain for issues in the days before MRI or CT scanning (why it involves making an incision in your throat and draining some blood I’m not sure I want to know). There’s also just a great deal of unsettling fear coming through Ellen Burstyn’s performance as a mirror who just doesn’t know what’s happening to her daughter. Perhaps the scariest thing during this act thought is Lieutenant Kinderman’s (Lee J. Cobb) description of the exact details surrounding the death of Burke Dennings (Jack MacGowran) who supposedly fell from Regan’s bedroom while he was babysitting the young girl. He relates to Father Karras (Jason Miller) that Dennings “was found at the bottom of those steps leading to M street with his head turned completely around – facing backwards.” Regan herself is not quite the parchment faced, glass-eyed monstrosity that we all know from a hundred and one videos made by arseholes on the internet until late in this act but we do get one of her most famous bits of vomiting thick green pea soup in the face of Father Karras.\n\nThe final act is almost made up entirely of the exorcism itself. Father Karras can get higher ups in the church to agree to it quite quickly compared to modern films where actually getting an exorcism authorised seems to involve more red tape than getting the chief of police to sign off on a search warrant in a cop thriller (and like a cop thriller normally leads to the protagonists taking the Lord into their own hands when they can’t get one). It is only after this point that we properly meet the title character Father Merrin (Max von Sydow) after briefly seeing him last in the prologue. The exorcism is nowadays perhaps much more intense than it is scary, the concept of an exorcism becoming such a cliché in horror that it simply wasn’t back in 1973, and the infamous head spinning is now maybe a different kind of infamous than it was back then as well. That said, the flashes we get of the demon’s face work best during the exorcism intercut with Regan’s demonic face moving back and forth from shadow to light. The actual climax still works though, Father Karras discovering Father Merrin slumped and dead while the Demon in Regan sits on the bed staring at the body. Finally losing it Father Karras begins attacking the Demon, by which we mean he begins punching a twelve-year-old girl in the face, begging it to take him. Finding himself now possessed he can keep enough of his mind to throw himself from the bedroom window and down a long flight of concrete steps killing himself. The power of this comes after the fact from the performance of Father William O’Malley as Father Joseph Dyer (yes, an actual priest playing a priest) delivering the last rites to his friend who is only able to grasp his hand in response. O’Malley’s shaking hand in this scene was accomplished by director William Friedkin slapping the actor unexpectedly seconds before calling for filming to begin, just to reiterate the director slapped an actual priest across the face to get a better performance out of him.\n\nIn addition to being a classic horror film The Exorcist is also a classic New Hollywood film. It could probably be said to be the New Hollywood horror. While most of the seminal horror films of the New Hollywood era were independent pictures that get lumped in with New Hollywood simply because of when they were made The Exorcist feels more akin to Friedkin’s other films of the 1970s (The French Connection and Sorcerer (1977) for instance) than it does to the likes of The Crazies (1973) or The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974). This can be seen through the reception the film received when first released. It received plaudits from top reviewers Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel, although the former despite giving it four stars out of four felt it wasn’t enjoyable and was amazed it received an R rating instead of an X. The fact the film was a box office success and was nominated for ten Academy Awards and winning two (Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Sound Mixing) instead of falling victim to the sort of moral panic that effects a lot of other horror films speaks volumes for its success.\n\nThat was when, but what about now? Your reviewer has heard the film described as more of a comedy than a horror and whilst there is a grain of truth in this it might be more due to the films reputation working against it amongst younger viewers. Like anything that has that high a reputation that you rarely hear a word against it upon encountering it yourself you can be somewhat underwhelmed. This reaction can leave be bemused at just why people found the film so terrifying when it was first released, so something of the shock value of The Exorcist has been lost thanks to its own infamy as well as generation differences. After all, is “Your mother sucks cocks in hell” so shocking when someone can be elected President of the United States after saying much worse things? As we’ve mentioned the concept of an exorcism was something largely untouched by horror in 1973 but by the 2010s it seems that every other horror film involves possession or an exorcism of some sort of another. It’s reaching a point where the possession film is in many ways becoming what slashers were in the 1980s with all the big franchises of the decade (Insidious (2010) and The Conjuring (2013) for example) involving possession in one way or another. This will also probably lead to diminishing reputation amongst younger viewers as even the epitome of a sub-genre can seem clichéd when you’ve seen dozens of imitators beforehand.\n\nIn spite of the fact The Exorcist has lost something of a potency in the forty-odd years since it was originally released there is a lot of horror still to be extracted once you look under the surface. It’s superior production and acting also elevate it above many other horrors. Taking everything into account The Exorcist gets an A- rating from both Kris and me, Ryan – making it a true masterpiece of the genre. There were numerous sequels to the film none of them actually any good (The Exorcist III (1990) is normally considered the best of them but even then it’s less of a step down and more falling off a cliff compared to the first, and shouldn’t have even been The Exorcist III in the first place by I’m digressing) so if you are looking for a horror session we recommend watching The Exorcist in between the two other proper New Hollywood horror films of that era – Rosemary’s Baby (1968) and The Omen (1976). Those three films will turn around any boring night.\n\nRyan’s Grade: A-\n\nKris’s Grade: A-\n\nOdds & Ends"
