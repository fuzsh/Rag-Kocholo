        "text": "Exorcist ‚Äì Linda Blair & Pazuzu painted kits\n\nThis topic has 13 replies, 7 voices, and was last updated 5 months ago by robinhood001.\n\nViewing 14 posts - 1 through 14 (of 14 total)\n\nAuthor\n\nPosts\n\n3Demonic\n\nParticipant\n\nHi all,\n\nFirst time poster, long time Exorcist fan here.\n\nI paint model kits as a hobby and the Exorcist is one subject matter that‚Äôs\n\nnear and dear to me.\n\nHere are a few shots of 2 recent kits I painted, which are lifesize scale‚Ä¶Hope\n\nyou enjoy them!\n\nYou can visit [url=‚Äùhttp://www.3demonic.com‚Äù%5D for more exorcist work and others\n\nLinda Blair bust:\n\nPazuzu wall plaque:\n\nfatherbowdern\n\nParticipant\n\n3Demonic,\n\nI love this work!\n\nBeing inquisitive, are you and Pete Murphy the same person?\n\nAn original mention of Pete‚Äôs work came from this posting about the Captain Howdy/Pazuzu wall plaque. This was on sale on eBay a few weeks ago, and I actually wrote to the artist; unfortunately I never heard back:\n\nOn eBay, crazyclayer6o8u, from Raleigh, North Carolina, USA had this on sale:\n\nhttp://captainhowdy.com/forum/the-exorcist-original/very-cool-captain-howdy-bust/\n\nThe Pazuzu piece says it‚Äôs copyrighted √Ç¬© 2009 Peter Gabriel Murphy @ http://www.petemurph.com/\n\nWhen I click on 3Demonic, the Linda Blair bust indicates it‚Äôs copyrighted √Ç¬© 2010 Killer Kits (Copyright √Ç¬© 2000/2005 3Demonic).\n\nThe talent is amazing, so I am making an assumption that Pete‚Äôs work and Killer Kits and 3Demonic are all the same, correct?\n\nFather Bowdern\n\n3Demonic\n\nParticipant\n\nHi and thanks for the feedback!\n\nNo, I‚Äôm not Peter Murphy. Peter sculpted and produces the Pazuzu kit and Killer Kits (UK) produced the Linda Blair kitm both of which came as blank resin copies‚Ä¶I painted both of them.\n\nGhettoExorcist\n\nParticipant\n\nNothing short of amazing!!! I would definitely like to own one if I wasn‚Äôt sure that I‚Äôd pee myself every time I enter a room with one of those busts looking at me with those lifelike grimacing faces.\n\nfatherbowdern\n\nParticipant\n\n3Demonic,\n\nEmphasizing Ghetto‚Äôs comment ‚Ä¶ you rock as an artist. Are those glass eyes? Fill us in on how you acheive these great works of art ‚Ä¶ I think you‚Äôll find the fans on here are quite dedicated to the behind-the-scenes approaches.\n\nThanks for sharing these!\n\nFather Bowdern\n\n3Demonic\n\nParticipant\n\nThanks Ghetto & Father Bowdern (cool nick BTW)‚Ä¶\n\nThe eyes are not glass‚Ä¶I prefer to paint all my eyes. I use an airbrush fr painting kits, each subject matter requires a different technique but one thing I always aim for is realism.\n\nDuplicating skin, even possessed ones, is always a challenge and requires painting several thin/translucent layers to build depth and replicate how skin reflects light and behaves over veins and muscle tissue.\n\nAs far as our Linda is concerned, trying to replicate Dick Smith‚Äôs wizardry was not easy! Dick Smith and Rick Baker are the true masters of modern horror FX.\n\nJagged\n\nParticipant\n\nThat Regan bust is just fantastic. Is that this kit with some alterations?\n\nhttp://daveskillerkits.tripod.com/exbust.html\n\nIf so your skills are pretty remarkable and I‚Äôm going to have to grab myself one and remodel it in a similar vein.\n\n3Demonic\n\nParticipant\n\nThanks Jagged‚Ä¶Yep, that‚Äôs the one!\n\nfatherbowdern\n\nParticipant\n\n3Demonic,\n\nDid you also paint the other masks on 3Demonic.com?\n\nFather Bowdern\n\netrigan69\n\nParticipant\n\nMy god man. Those are both incredible. The eyes are awesome. I thought you used glass eyes also.\n\nI‚Äôve been painting figure model kits for 20 years + and those are seriously some of the nicest paint ups I‚Äôve ever seen.\n\nHow did you do the hair? Is it punched or a wig? That can‚Äôt be the hair that came with the kit!\n\n3Demonic\n\nParticipant\n\nFather Bowdern said:\n\nDid you also paint the other masks on 3Demonic.com?\n\nYes, that‚Äôs right.\n\nEtrigan, thanks very much‚Ä¶great to see a fellow painter here üôÇ\n\nThe hair is a wig, which I sourced specifically for the kit. I trimmed and styled until I got the right look. The bust came with a wig, but it was useless.\n\nfatherbowdern\n\nParticipant\n\n3Demonic ‚Ä¶ I think you have great abilities! I hope you are applying them in a field of work that is both creative and exciting. üôÇ\n\nFather Bowdern\n\nViewing 14 posts - 1 through 14 (of 14 total)\n\nYou must be logged in to reply to this topic.\n\nLog In\n\nUsername:\n\nPassword:\n\nKeep me signed in\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nThe reCAPTCHA verification period has expired.
