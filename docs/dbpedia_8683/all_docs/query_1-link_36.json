It was the first film in a long time where people waited in line. With lines stretching around the block, people had no clue of the impact that it was going to have of their lives.\n\nThe Exorcist film was far too much for some people to handle. The movie theater had people fainting, women having Miscarriages, and some getting sick & throwing up.\n\nThe Exorcist set box office records with a story of good vs. evil, thus dividing religious leaders, and set a national debate of our belief system in God & Satan. Outraged critics called it religious pornography.\n\nThis blockbuster hit began as a testament to William Peter Blatty’s faith. When he was in college at Georgetown, William heard of a 1949 exorcism and possession case which ignited his interest, and he didn’t look back. He felt he needed to write a book about it which would then become a movie.\n\nThe story of a young girl by the name of Regan taken over by demonic possession beyond her will. The mother pursues every medical & technological remedy to help cure her daughter. Nothing works, so she then turns to God and a priest.\n\nFather Karras (Damien) is the priest she turns to, however he is having his own crisis in faith and his belief in God. In meeting the demon inhabiting Linda Blair which goes by Pazuzu, his struggle intensifies when this demonic force channels his dead Mother through Regan.\n\nHis struggle & battle with faith in God continues throughout the film, even through to the last Exorcism being performed on Regan. He exorcises the Demon out of Regan with the help of Father Merrin whom suffers a heart attack during the ritual.\n\nThe film inserted short clips which some claimed were subliminal messages. Some people even after watching the film claiming & mimicking signs of possession.\n\nThe Exorcist personifies demons & devils in a psychological & theological sense, and really hits close to home for everyone and begs to ask the question — Is the devil real?… and will he take control of me?\n\nHere is a quote from Linda Blair herself in why The Exorcist was such a major hit in grossing over 400 million dollars… “It became an event that you had to go and experience, but can you really take it.” ~ Linda Blair\n\nFiled under: Cosplay Contact Lenses • Scary Contact Lenses"
