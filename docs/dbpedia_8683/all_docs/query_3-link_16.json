        "text": "The upcoming film Of the Devil stars Eileen Dietz. If the name sounds familiar it is because the actress played the iconic face of Pazuzu in The Exorcist. You remember the face, it was the one that would flash on screen and send your spine through the roof. In addition Dietz played demonic Regan when effects were too intense for the young actress Linda Blair. So, it is great to see Dietz returning to the possession genre.\n\nThe description for Of the Devil goes like this:\n\na family desperate to find a cure for their young son’s brain cancer. When unconventional treatments lead to the child being possessed by an ancient evil, the parents must fight not only for the child’s life but also his soul.\n\nAccording to Deadline Of the Devil will receive an August release. So, we shouldn’t have to wait long for a trailer. In the meantime, we all we have is somewhat confusing and sinister photo of Dietz with a really adorable and chubby pug. I’m not sure what the implications are, but judging from the look on Dietz’s face it can’t be good.\n\nWe will let you know more about the film as we get more info in.\n\n'Alien:Romulus' Theater Merch Unboxing\n\nAKA: Adult Happy Meals\n\nCan you believe it’s been 21 years since Freddy threw down with Jason? The jury is still out on who won.\n\nThis was the last film in which Robert Englund appeared in makeup as Freddy. It’s unclear when or if Freddy will return to a mainstream film, as there is some debate in the surviving Craven household regarding the character’s copyright. Wes Craven directed the first A Nightmare on Elm Street in 1984.\n\nPitting famous movie monsters against each other in crossover battles isn’t a new concept. Universal embraced this idea and began doing it back in the 1940s with their own IPs. As is the case with Freddy vs. Jason, the films usually had open endings or no clear winner, since everyone has their favorite and doesn’t want them to lose.\n\nInteresting fact about Freddy vs. Jason: James Wan was supposed to direct, but he chose to make Saw instead.\n\nBelow, we have listed some great horror movie (sci-fi) battle films, starting with the birthday boys themselves. These films range from the biggest budgets to the lowest, but all are a great time.\n\nIf you want to check any of them out, go over to JustWatch and search for the title to find your preferred medium.\n\nFreddy vs. Jason (2003)\n\nFreddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees return to terrorize the teenagers of Elm Street. Only this time, they’re out to get each other, too.\n\nAlien vs. Predator (2004)\n\nDuring an archaeological expedition on Bouvetøya Island in Antarctica, a team of archaeologists and other scientists find themselves caught up in a battle between the two legends. Soon, the team realize that only one species can win.\n\nGodzilla vs. Kong (2021)\n\nLegends collide as Godzilla and Kong, the two most powerful forces of nature, clash on the big screen in a spectacular battle for the ages. As a squadron embarks on a perilous mission into fantastic uncharted terrain, unearthing clues to the Titans’ very origins and mankind’s survival, a conspiracy threatens to wipe the creatures, both good and bad, from the face of the earth forever.\n\nDracula vs Frankenstein (1971)\n\nDracula conspires with a mad doctor to resurrect the Frankenstein Monster.\n\nDollman vs. Demonic Toys (1993)\n\nJudith Grey teams with Brick Bardo (Dollman) and his girlfriend Ginger to face the evil Demonic Toys for one final battle.\n\nDinocroc vs Supergator (2010 – TV movie)\n\nCreated in the laboratories of a biotech corporation, two ravenous mega-reptiles level everything in their way. Now, three defenders must try to save the day. Who shall live and who shall die in the battle between Dinocroc and Supergator?\n\nVersus Films: End of an Era or a Fresh Start?\n\nVersus films, where iconic characters face off in epic battles, have always been a fan favorite, but they are becoming increasingly difficult to produce. Legal complexities and character rights often stand in the way, even though audiences love watching these epic showdowns.\n\nHowever, with classic characters entering the public domain, a new era of versus films is emerging. One of the most anticipated versus films is Mickey vs. Winnie in the upcoming horror film MVW, scheduled for release in 2025.\n\nThis film marks the beginning of a new evolution in versus movies, where beloved childhood icons are transformed into nightmarish adversaries in a terrifying battle that will captivate and horrify audiences. The synopsis teases a chilling confrontation in a cursed forest, where innocence and evil collide in a bloody showdown.\n\nHere is a further description of the Mickey Vs Winnie horror film MVW:\n\n“A century ago, two convicts disappeared into Hell Forest, a place feared for its dark legends and whispers of a sinister curse. The mysterious force lurking within the forest feeds on those who dare to enter.\n\nIn the present day, a group of ex-wilderness reform school survivalists, reunited and bound by a shared history of trauma and rebellion, travels back to their abandoned disciplinary teen camp, nestled at the forest’s edge. The desolate school stands as a decaying symbol of their lost innocence, its walls echoing with secrets and forgotten horrors.\n\nAs they step into the eerie corridors of the school and the shadowy depths of Hell Forest, they unknowingly stir the curse that has lain dormant for generations. The school’s long-buried malevolence intertwines with the forest’s ancient evil, feeding off the ex-troubled teens’—now in their 30s—hidden fears and desires, manifesting as two monstrous figures: Dark Mickey and Dark Winnie, once cherished childhood icons now twisted into grotesque nightmares.\n\nThese twisted incarnations, born from the curse and the group’s own inner demons, become locked in a vicious battle. The hellish energy that transformed innocence into horror now seeks to consume the survivalists, forcing them to confront not only the nightmarish creatures but also the dark secrets from their teen years at Camp Misery Bay Reform School.”\n\n'Alien:Romulus' Theater Merch Unboxing\n\nAKA: Adult Happy Meals\n\nEveryone’s favorite 80s suburban housing development, Cuesta Verde, California, has a vacancy. Of course, we are talking about the fictional family home of the Freelings from Tobe Hooper’s 1982 supernatural hit Poltergeist.\n\nThe real house, located at 4267 Roxbury St, Simi Valley, CA., is on the market, and if you can afford the California price tag of just over $1M you could own one of the most coveted life-sized movie props in film history.\n\nEntertainment site JoBlo put the wordy Zillow listing up on their site, which reads:\n\n“For the first time in 45 years, the legendary house from the movie Poltergeist is back on the market!

Buyers must send preapproval before showing.”\n\nPoltergeist has become notorious for being “cursed.” First, Jo Beth Willaims did a scene in which she fell into an unfinished, muddy swimming pool full of skeletons. The prop department failed to tell her they were real human ones.\n\nThen there was poor Heather O’Rourke who suffered many physical ailments after filming wrapped. About five years after Poltergeist and two sequels, she developed Crohn’s disease. A year later, she passed away at just 12 years old.\n\nTragedy struck the cast again when young actress Dominique Dunne who played Dana, the Freeling’s oldest daughter was stalked, then killed in real life in 1982.\n\nYou can take a virtual tour of the house on the Zillow site. Keep in mind, that the exteriors were filmed on location, but most of the interiors were shot on a sound stage. Still, you can see the set builders took some inspiration from the real house.\n\n'Alien:Romulus' Theater Merch Unboxing\n\nAKA: Adult Happy Meals"
