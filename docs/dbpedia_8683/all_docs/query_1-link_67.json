        "text": "Alright so confession time—I never found The Exorcist scary. I’ve always admired it as a film, and it features fantastic performances and direction, but even though an acclaimed supernatural horror film should be right up my alley, there was something about it that didn’t scare me. I think it was the ultra-realism mixed with the over-the-top supernatural story that didn’t quite do it for me, but we’re all scared by different things, and plenty of movies I find scary have been described by others as boring. That said, I rewatched The Exorcist recently and found something that truly unsettled me, something I had somehow missed before that made me look at the film in an entirely different light.\n\nDisclaimer: This article will cover themes of sexual abuse and intense sexual imagery in addition to the already explicit horror present in the movie. Also, as usual, I will be spoiling the whole movie, so this will not make any sense unless you’ve seen it.\n\nSometimes you watch a movie once or twice, move on with your life, and then come back to it years later and realize you missed something that was staring you in the face the whole time. Well there is one small piece of information in William Friedkin’s 1973 film The Exorcist that I had not paid much mind to before, but now I think may be the key to understanding the whole film. About halfway through the film, Burke Dennings (Jack MacGowran), the director of the film Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) is working on, is discovered dead after taking a fall from Regan MacNeil’s bedroom window.\n\nAt first, everyone assumes it’s just a drunken accident, but the strange thing that Lieutenant Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb) reveals is that Burke’s head has been turned around 180 degrees in a way that wouldn’t happen from a simple fall, and that a 12-year-old girl like Regan (Linda Blair) could never do. The main question the movie poses is “How was Regan (who was also presumably sedated at the time) able to have the strength to do this?” or perhaps “Was there somebody else in the house?” However, this time I found myself asking a new question that either hadn’t entered my mind before or at least hadn’t stuck—”What the hell was a grown man doing in a 12-year-old girl’s bedroom?”\n\nChris was out of the house, visiting a doctor to talk about Regan’s worsening condition, so she had the babysitter Sharon (Kitty Winn) stay with a sedated Regan. When Sharon stepped out to pick up medication for Regan, she had Burke stay in the house. Burke is clearly a friend of Chris’s, and it’s implied he has some interest in her that isn’t reciprocated. When Chris returns, she doesn’t know Burke is dead and just assumes that he has irresponsibly left Regan alone, and when she finds out he’s dead, the scene fades out. Kinderman does ask her a few questions during his investigation into Burke’s death about Burke being in Regan’s room, but he never goes into detail, and Chris just says she has no idea.\n\nThe possibility that Burke was sexually assaulting Regan is never brought up by a single character, yet any decent detective would absolutely wonder what is going on there.\n\nLet’s take a look at what we know about the character of Burke Dennings.\n\nHe’s an eccentric European director.\n\nHe’s an alcoholic or at least a heavy drinker.\n\nHe is constantly off-color. The first comment we see him make at Chris’s party is about finding a pubic hair in his drink. It comes out of nowhere and clearly makes the people around him uncomfortable.\n\nHe likes to stir the pot just for fun. He accuses Chris’s servant Karl (Rudolf Schündler) of being a Nazi just to torment him.\n\nHe was, without a doubt, in Regan’s bedroom the night he died, because he fell from her window.\n\nThis is a character, albeit a relatively minor one, without too many sympathetic qualities. After he dies, things get exponentially worse for Regan as the demon inside her takes over more and more, and she deteriorates.\n\nStrictly in terms of symbolism, what would you think a writer was trying to suggest about a character who died with his head turned completely around? It seems to be a pretty clear metaphor for Burke being two-faced.\n\nOn the surface, he’s acerbic but amusing, but deep down he’s hiding a dark secret.\n\nIn fact, there is another eccentric European director of the time, who also has a first name with five letters and a last name with eight, that Burke Dennings brings to mind. Sure, Roman Polanski had not been convicted of statutory rape yet in 1973 when The Exorcist came out, but it’s not like he kept his interest in underage girls a secret in interviews. Even if the average American didn’t know, surely a lot of Hollywood people did. Furthermore, actor Jack McGowarn, who plays Burke, worked with Polanski on Cul-de-sac and The Fearless Vampire Killers, so he may have even been channeling him in his performance.\n\nAfter the fight between Burke and Karl is broken up, Burke snarks “What’s for dessert?” which is a humorous way to break up the scene… except for the fact that we cut immediately to Regan lying in bed. Viewed in this context, that’s horrifying.\n\nHow about the gradual decline as Regan’s possession gets worse? First, Regan tells her mother that her bed was shaking, then we see it shaking, then we see her being tossed up and down the bed by an invisible force against her will as she screams out in pain for it to stop.\n\nBoth the bed shaking and Regan convulsing on the bed and screaming are reminiscent of a rape scene, even if the rapist is not present.\n\nWhen you start realizing these things, you start noticing more and more images that suggest the movie may have a theme of sexual abuse. For example, when the bed posts are covered so that Regan can be tied to the bed, they look extremely phallic…\n\nWhen Chris meets Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller) for the first time, she tries to cover her wounds with large sunglasses like an abuse victim might do…\n\nI also think it’s possible that Damien’s mother was abusive, at least emotionally, but that’s somewhat tangential to my main argument here, and it’s more my personal headcanon than a theory I can back up very well, so I won’t dwell on that.\n\nOn the wall of the basement, there’s a cutout of Little Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolf (dressed as Grandmother).\n\nThe wolf in the story is clearly a stand-in for a sexual predator, and in some early versions of the story, actually is a sexual predator. In one version, Red Riding Hood is only able to get out of bed with him by claiming she has to use the bathroom.\n\nThis might be referenced in the scene where Regan sleepwalks down from the bedroom, interrupts her mother’s party (which Burke has just left), and urinates on the floor. More likely, the urinating on the floor is a symptom of sexual abuse, as it is one of many possible explanations as to why an older child would urinate during sleep.\n\nWhen the demon taunts Chris, it takes on the voice of Burke Dennings and says “Do you know what she did, your cunting daughter?”\n\nThis could easily just be the demon mocking Chris about Regan (while possessed) killing Burke, but doesn’t Chris already know? I mean, she’s aware by this point that Regan has supernatural strength, and she knows no one else was in the house. She’s pretty sure whatever is in Regan’s body killed Burke, so why would this be such a horrifying reveal to her? Also, why would Burke be the one taunting? I realize it’s most likely the demon posing as Burke, but it doesn’t make a lot of sense that he would be taunting someone about his own death. If he’s a sexual predator taunting the mother about his rape of Regan, that would feel more in character.\n\nHow about the other crime Regan commits—the desecration of the Virgin Mary statue?\n\nSure, it could just be the demon essentially “trolling” God and the church, but practical joking doesn’t really seem to be its modus operandi. It seems pretty obvious that the desecration of the Virgin Mary statue represents a loss of innocence and virginity. However, if it was something as simple as a loss of childlike innocence, the desecration of the statue, complete with blood and a penis, would feel extreme. Everyone outgrows their childlike innocence eventually, but this represents a complete corruption and destruction of that innocence. The most pure and holy of images has now been corrupted in an absolutely obscene way.\n\nOne warning sign that a child is being sexually abused is that they suddenly have a knowledge of sexual subjects they did not before, and frankly should not have. In the opening scenes of the film, Regan has a very childlike, innocent view of sexuality. She teases her mother about what she’s heard about her and Burke in a playful “I know who has a crush on you” kind of way. Once the possession begins, however, she immediately switches to graphic sexual knowledge, including masturbating with a crucifix, shoving her mother’s face against her vagina, and insulting the priests with sexual insults like “Your mother sucks cocks in Hell” and “Stick your cock up her ass.” The “stick your cock up her ass” line could even be a “Do what that other guy did” kind of taunt. It’s also important to remember that the crucifix scene itself is explicitly sexual abuse. Regan is not masturbating with a crucifix by choice—the demon is forcing it upon her.\n\nWhether or not you think the film is about sexual abuse, it seems pretty clear that Friedkin is drawing direct correlation between Regan’s medical tests and Regan’s exorcism. Both involve long, drawn out scenes where Regan is held down on a bed as older men cause her pain.\n\nIn fact, plenty of viewers have claimed they find the medical scenes to be as scary if not scarier than the possession scenes, but I think that’s what Friedkin is going for. If the film was simply a story about possession, would we really need all of these medical scenes? You could just have one scene with a doctor, or even just a line where Chris says “The doctors say it’s not physical,” and that would be that. Since I don’t think William Friedkin is some kind of torture porn fanatic, these scenes exist to draw comparisons to the exorcism. Look at the way this needle forms a cross right before it goes into Regan’s neck.\n\nWe get scenes where both the doctors and the priests gather around long tables and discuss what to do about Regan.\n\nThe Exorcist author William Peter Blatty was a strict Catholic (well, besides the three divorces I guess), and wrote his novel to be a straightforward story where an exorcism was the only option. William Friedkin, however, is agnostic (or at least was at the time) and wanted to make the story a little more ambiguous. The medical tests and the exorcism feel equally violating for Regan, and even though the exorcism “works,” it doesn’t work in the traditional sense. Father Merrin (Max von Sydow) dies, and the demon only leaves Regan when Father Karras punches it out of her and volunteers his own body as a host.\n\nIf you track with the interpretation that Friedkin is comparing the medical tests to the exorcism, let’s take it one step further. Friedkin is comparing the medical tests and the exorcism both to sexual abuse. In both scenarios, Regan is strapped to a bed unable to move as older men surround her and do all kinds of things against her will. She is clearly uncomfortable with the male characters, even grabbing a psychiatrist’s testicles at one point. In the hospital scenes, Regan is constantly poked and prodded with phallic objects, and what’s more, the doctors are doing brain examinations. Like a true abuser, they get in her head. There’s an iconic scene in the exorcism where Regan levitates, but that’s not the scary part to me.\n\nIt’s far creepier the way two older men forcibly lower her onto the bed, once again, a bed with extremely phallic bed posts.\n\nAlright, alright, so I think the story is about sexual abuse both on the surface and symbolically. How does this connect to demon possession? Do I think that all of the supernatural elements are in the characters’ heads and that Regan’s condition is only a result of trauma? No. In spite of the fact that the spiritual elements are a bit more ambiguous in the film than the book, I still believe that what we see on screen is what happens. Regan is possessed by a demon, her mother does everything in her power to make it stop, and eventually Father Karras sacrifices himself. To understand the way in which I think this all ties together, we need to take a look at the demon that possesses Regan.\n\nPazuzu is a pretty ridiculous name to say out loud, so Friedkin makes the smart decision of never doing it in the whole movie. (The sequel of course threw caution to the wind on this and used the name over and over.) At one point, the demon says “And I’m the Devil,” but it’s clearly either a scare tactic or a joke, as the Pazuzu statue we see early in the film later reappears during the exorcism.\n\nA Mesopotamian demon, Pazuzu ruled the demons of the wind, and brought famine and locusts. However, he was a nuanced figure in that he also fought other evil spirits and was a protector. This is referenced in the opening scenes of the film when a museum curator tells Father Merrin “Evil against evil.” There are only a few lines spoken in this creepy prologue set in Iraq, so this being said seems to set a tone for the film… except, who’s the other evil? The evil of the film is Pazuzu, and the heroes are everyone else right? The exorcists and doctors may go to extreme measures to get what they want, but they aren’t evil. Chris can be unpleasant to people to make sure Regan is taken care of, but she only does it out of love for daughter, and she is anything but evil. Kinderman is a lousy cop who can’t ask the questions needed to investigate the murder, but, per his name, he’s the kindest man in the movie. Evil against evil? How is this setting the tone for the movie unless there’s a hidden evil?\n\nWhen Regan shows Chris the Ouija board she found, Chris insists it takes two to play.\n\nRegan insists she has a second, her friend Captain Howdy. What Chris assumes is simply an imaginary friend is of course the demon Pazuzu, coming to Regan in a friendly guise. I’m going to make a bit of a leap here, but stay with me. A lot of the important events of The Exorcist do not happen on screen. We never see Burke Dennings’ death, we never see the death of Damien’s mother, and we never see Regan playing with the Ouija board when her mother is away. Again, if Pazuzu is a protector, what if he offered Regan a classic “deal with the devil?” He promised to protect her and kill the man sexually abusing her. Of course, she doesn’t know that in return this means welcoming him in to destroy her, exposing her to similarly horrible situations all over again. A demon against a sexual predator? Now that sounds like evil against evil.\n\nAt the end of the film, things seem to be better for Regan and Chris, as Chris ensures Regan doesn’t remember anything from the possession. It won’t be a gradual process of dealing with what happened, but the memory is simply, magically gone. Maybe it’s a happy ending, but this seems more like repressed memory to me. Repressed memory in regards to sexual abuse wasn’t discussed as much in the early ’70s, so it’s possible this isn’t the case, but I found it interesting. (For what it’s worth, I’m not counting any sequels as canon here since Friedkin had nothing to do with them, even if Exorcist III is an interesting film in its own right.)\n\nIf you’re interested in reading more about this topic in regards to The Exorcist, I’m not the only one who views the film this way. Rob Ager has a great video which I watched after developing my theory about the film. He actually disagrees on the “Burke Dennings is a sexual predator” theory,” but he raises some interesting points nonetheless. Like with my theory on The Shining, it’s not like I’m the first viewer to raise these questions, but I hope I’ve brought a few new points into the mix and have helped some viewers see the film in a new way. I know there are a few scenes I now find particularly creepy (the demon impersonating Burke, for instance) which I never did before."
