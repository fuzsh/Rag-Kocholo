        "text": "You have to hand it to the Italian movie industry: they certainly made a lax trademark regime work for them when it comes to producing knock-off sequels. From Jaws to The Terminator to Alien, Hollywood hit after Hollywood hit would find itself rehashed by unscrupulous Italian B-movie studios in the 1980s. I’ve previously outlined how Dawn of the Dead – known as Zombi for the Italian release – spawned an actually pretty good Lucio Fulci followup before the Zombi series got into diminishing returns, and how a totally absurd number of movies got released as Zombi sequels on the sly regardless of anyone’s original intentions.\n\nA smaller-scale but no less bizarre franchise-which-isn’t-a-franchise is the La Casa series. La Casa, you see, was the Italian title for The Evil Dead, and naturally La Casa 2 was Evil Dead 2. This inspired Joe D’Amato to commission an unofficial La Casa 3; directed by the highly variable Umberto Lenzi at his absolute nadir of competence, this would be known in more trademark-respecting markets as Ghosthouse and is absolutely awful; Rifftrax did a pretty good job on it if you have to go there.\n\nAstonishingly, Ghosthouse was actually kind of a hit, one suspects because viewers put down their money thinking they’d be getting more Evil Dead and it was astonishingly cheap to make. Two more Italian-made La Casa sequels were made before the second and third House movies got repackaged in Italy to round off the series. Well, strictly speaking only House III: The Horror Story got repackaged as La Casa 7; House II: The Second Story is referred to as La Casa 6 but was never officially released under that exact name, leaving the series with a gaping hole at the 6 notch.\n\nIt gets more bizarre: Ghosthouse became the foundation of another franchise-in-name-only, with Lamberto Bava’s The Ogre, two other Umberto Lenzi haunted house clunkers (The House of Witchcraft and The House of Lost Souls, themselves part of the La Case Maledette series of made-for-TV horror films), and La Casa 4 and La Casa 5 forming the other members of the Ghosthouse series. Even wilder, La Casa 4 is sometimes designated as Ghosthouse 2 and sometimes as Ghosthouse 5, at the sheer whim of the various video distributors who participated in this nonsense.\n\nOnce you start getting into this stuff it gets outright fractal – Bava’s The Ogre was also dubbed by some (incorrectly) as being the third entry in the Demons series. So let’s back up from the edge of the abyss and just concentrate on La Casa: 88 Films have, for some goddamn reason, put out blu-rays of La Casa 4 and La Casa 5, so why don’t we take a look at them. After all, how bad can they be?\n\nDear reader: they can be astonishingly bad.\n\nLa Casa 4, AKA Witchcraft, AKA Witchery, AKA Ghosthouse 2, AKA Ghosthouse 5\n\nCalling itself Witchcraft on the print 88 Films used, this was directed by Fabrizio Laurenti and is notable largely for landing David Hasselhoff to play the male lead, having been made right in the middle of his career slump between Knight Rider ending and Baywatch kicking off. The Hoff plays Gary, a photographer who accompanies his buddy Leslie (Leslie Cumming) on a paranormal research expedition to an isolated island off the New England coast.\n\nThe island is home to an abandoned hotel complex which is the focus of much local legend, the root of these superstitions being linked to the witch persecutions that happened in the area centuries ago. The place’s dire reputation means that the hotel is up for sale cheap, and the Brooks family – domineering mother Rose (Annie Ross), father Freddie (Bob Champagne), pregnant daughter Jane (Linda Blair) and young son Tommy (Michael Manchester) – are stopping by for a viewing, since they are considering buying the place and reopening it. Accompanying them is the estate agent, Jerry Giordano (Rick Farnsworth), who’s eager to make the sale, and Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland), a sexually voracious architect who’s coming along to do an estimate of how much it would cost to renovate the place.\n\nThis makes things rather awkward once the two parties encounter each other, since Leslie didn’t get permission to go to the island and it’s private property – but that’s soon the least of anyone’s worries. The boat that took the Brooks to the island has vanished, and a storm’s up so the rubber dinghy that Gary and Leslie used to get here can’t be used either. And it is evident to the viewer – but not yet the characters – that everyone has been drawn to this place by the mysterious Lady In Black (Hildegard Knef), who it’s implied might be a former Hollywood star who, after filming a feature on the island, became obsessed with the place to the point of buying it up and making her home here, abandoning her career entirely.\n\nOr rather, the spirit of that actress – for the Lady In Black is manifesting in ways which make it clear she’s no mundane human. And that’s just the start of the strangeness that will claim the lives of most of the visitors to the island, as the forces of witchcraft gather and the gates of Hell yawn open…\n\nYes, like After Death (AKA Zombi 4, AKA Zombie Flesh Eaters 3), this is another late-1980s Italian horror film trying to ride on the coattails of Lucio Fulci’s Gates of Hell trilogy. Along with the references in dialogue to the “gates of Hell”, we also have a central role played by a dilapidated old hotel which was once the site of the brutal persecution of a suspected witch – so far, so The Beyond.\n\nThe presence of Linda Blair, naturally, prompts Laurenti and screenwriter Daniele Stroppa to resort to extensive ripping-off of The Exorcist as well; yes, dear reader, she does end up possessed, she does end up dressed in an old-fashioned nightie, and in a mild twist on the end of the original movie she ends up throwing herself out of the window to thwart the possessing entity, since that nice Father Karras isn’t here to do the job.\n\nThe only other interesting thing about Linda Blair’s casting is that it’s part of a more general botching of the casting of the Brooks family. Blair was 29 when this was made, and if the family had just been Jane, Rose, and Freddie then this would work fine – Rose and Freddie look about the right age to be the parents of a woman who’s pushing 30, job’s a good ‘un.\n\nThe fly in the ointment is little Tommy, who’s meant to be Jane’s younger brother – a younger brother for whom a Sesame Street tape recorder is a wholly age-appropriate gift. Whilst I suppose it is faintly possible that Rose had Tommy when she was on the cusp of menopause, or perhaps more likely that Tommy was adopted, it doesn’t seem like either was the intention since the age gap just isn’t addressed at all, and you’d think it’d be commented on what with Jane being old enough to be Tommy’s mother.\n\nOne suspects that the part of Jane was originally written as being younger and that there was a teen pregnancy angle to the story which got cut when Linda Blair got cast, necessitating appropriate casting for Freddie and Rose and leaving the question of her child’s paternity up in the air.\n\nAs far as the Hoff’s presence goes, his main task here is to pop his shirt off on occasion and be a total creep to Leslie – he’s always badgering her about how she’s a virgin and how he can totally fix that and how it’s totally weird and wrong of her to be a virgin at her age, which is pretty horrible behaviour all told.\n\nWhat of the actual story? Well, it’s a confused mess; my outline above makes it sound like it’s much more straightforward than it’s actually presented as being. It doesn’t help that some stretches of dialogue are just sort of mumbled; apparently Laurenti had issues working with the international cast, and I half-suspect that he didn’t actually speak English – meaning he couldn’t judge when an line had actually been audibly and clearly recorded and when it had been flubbed. There’s some endearingly gory set-pieces, but a great deal of confusion as to whether the story is a cautionary tale about witchcraft persecution or a weird justification of it by depicting witches doing everything they were alleged to have done and worse besides.\n\nNot only is the resulting film not good, but it’s also not even amusingly bad – it’s just mediocre. There’s some cunning ideas slipped in here and there; for instance, after Rose is spirited away by demonic forces and has her mouth sewn shut, she is restored to the conventional world suspended upside-down in the chimney, and left unable to cry out as the family light a fire in the fireplace which ultimately cooks her. This is a fun concept, but the execution is just rather drab. That’s a microcosm of the movie, really: a mashup of blatant plagiarism and some genuinely interesting ideas, none of it executed with enough flair or passion to really entertain.\n\nLa Casa 5, AKA Beyond Darkness, AKA Ghosthouse 6\n\nFather Peter (Gene LeBrock) and Father George (David Brandon) were seminary buddies who were taught by Reverend Jonathan (Stephen Brown), but they have had very different destinies since then. Peter has gotten married to Annie (Barbara Bingham) and has two children, Martin (Michael Stephenson) and Carole (Theresa Walker). Yes, this is an odd career path for a Catholic priest, but exactly how Catholic the clergy in this movie actually are varies over the course of its running time. Anyway, Peter and family have moved into a nice new house that Reverend Jonathan has found for them, only to find that it’s haunted by a small army of witches and a creepy crack in the wall.\n\nGeorge, meanwhile, took to the prison ministry. When he attempts to take the final confession of serial killer Bette (Mary Coulson), she regales him with a disturbing story – that she is a servant of the demonic entity Ameth, that the souls of her child victims are bound to her and will be dragged down to Hell with her, and that sooner or later she’ll take George’s soul down to Hell too. George might be able to brush this off – except for his visions of the dead children accompanying Bette to her execution.\n\nAs it turns out, Bette was part of the same hidden witchcraft religion which was also practiced in the vicinity of Father Peter’s new house – and which, back in the witchcraft persecutions, was the site of a mass execution of accused witches, some genuine and some innocent. This is a fairly sleazy attempt by the movie to have its cake and eat it, but it ends up coming across as saying that the problem with the witchcraft persecutions wasn’t that people were being accused of shit that didn’t happen, it’s that the witches were being exactly as evil as they were accused of being but the evidentiary procedures were sloppy and some innocents got caught up in it.\n\nEventually, Peter and George must team up to save Peter’s family from the supernatural evil assailing it, but by that point I didn’t particular care because it had become apparent that, whilst there are some original twists to the plot, this movie was basically one half of a Poltergeist bolted onto one half of an Exorcist rip-off.\n\nNot that I should have expected better, for the director of Beyond Darkness is none other than Claudio Fragasso – it’s a little something he squeaked out between After Death and Troll 2, and indeed Martin here is played by the same Michael Stephenson who played the plucky child who pisses on hospitality in Troll 2 and who would later make Best Worst Movie as a look at that movie’s latter-day infamy as an amusingly incompetent endeavour.\n\nWhilst I am sure there’d be interesting stories to tell about this one, I don’t see Beyond Darkness getting the Best Worst Movie treatment any time soon, or even getting much attraction as a so-bad-it’s-good cult movie. As with Witchcraft, it’s inept enough to disqualify it from being good, but not quite absurd enough to be amusing.\n\nThe script – cowritten by Fragasso and his wife Rosella Drudi, as was Troll 2 – is for the most part very by-the-numbers. For the first two thirds of the movie it’s ripping off Poltergeist – you had the young daughter who seems to hear something supernatural calling to her, you have the exhortations about going into the light, you have the kid being snatched away into an otherworld that their parent has to get them back from, and you have the whole shebang happening because the house was built on the site of a long-ago atrocity. (“They’re haunting it… and then they’re going to haunt me… OH MY GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWD!”)\n\nThen, about half an hour before the end, the movie switches gears and concentrates primarily on ripping off The Exorcist – you have an exorcism sequence which strongly resembles a zero-budget version of the one in that, you have two priests dealing with crises of faith, you have the dark force behind what’s happening having a past history with one of the priests, you have a possessed kid who snarls and has welts appear on their face as holy water is sprinkled on them. (“They’re possessing him… and then they’re going to possess me… OH MY GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWD!”)\n\nThe really infuriating thing is that there’s the germ of a good idea in here. Serial killers who claimed their actions bound their victims souls’ to them are an actual thing – Ted Cruz, the Zodiac Killer, bragged in his letters to the press about how those he killed would be his slaves in Hell. The idea of a killer for whom this is actually true, and a character who can see the souls the killer has bound to them and is desperately trying to disentangle them? That’s the seed of a really interesting story. You could make it a whole anti-death penalty thing, with the time remaining to the execution also being the time remaining to save those souls before they share their murderer’s fate.\n\nBut that would require you to do something original, and Fragasso clearly was in no mood to do that this time around. And that’s a shame, because the more original parts of the movie work much better than the rest of the surrounding material. The stuff which concentrates exclusively on George, Bette, and the souls of the slain children has a ton of potential, especially when a homeless, drunk George seems to run into them on the street, only for the kids to file onto a bus and get driven away by Bette. The sequence in which a horde of black-veiled witches file into the house is pretty good, at least the first time it happens, though it ultimately succumbs to diminishing returns.\n\nThere’s ultimately two ways a Claudio Fragasso film can end up entertaining you, and neither of them have to do with the movie actually being good. It can take the After Death route, where Fragasso ends up ripping off a well-worn genre or much-imitated movie with such astonishing ineptitude and outright absurdity that it’s funny, or it can take the Troll 2 route, where Drudi and Fragasso dream up something more original that’s so utterly off the wall it leaves you gobsmacked at the ridiculousness of it all. Beyond Darkness could have gone in either direction, but ultimately did neither."
