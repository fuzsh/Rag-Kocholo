        "text": "May 13, 2020\n\n#1 Favorite First-Read of 2019\n\nNovember 24th, 2019 : I've been dipping into the stories in this book sporadically since December 2018. Set to finish my first read next month. It's mindblowing stuff. Even in translation Agnon comes off to me as one of the best writers ever, and novellas and especially short stories being his forte, this story suite (containing a novella (published separately in English as The Parable and Its Lesson), a novel, and many stories—in the original Hebrew edition, very very many, whereas the English edition is cut by half, with half the book left untranslated) is pure wonder. This morning I finished In Search of a Rabbi, or The Governor's Whim, which I think is my favorite of all of Agnon's Englished novels (though (here comes an edit from May 2020) Only Yesterday and In Mr. Lublin's Store offer stiff competition; but I think The Governor's Whim is still my favorite). It's absolutely wild, unfettered, unpredictable, brilliant, beautiful stuff.\n\nNovember 30th, 2019 : Once I finished In Search of a Rabbi it was too difficult to resist reading straight on to the end. This must be one of the world's best collections of stories, at least for the sort of reader that I am, enamored of Agnon's particular brand of craft, wisdom, beauty; and the only pity in this affair is that the editors were given license to translate and publish but half the stories of the original 'Ir umelo'ah, which in full would've run to some 1100 or 1200 pages in English. Thus the other 116 stories from Agnon's great project, his great city, remain available only to those who can read Hebrew. Until I myself can, I'll have to be content with rereading the 23 collected here (and the 24th published separately). For now, I'm on to editor Alan Mintz's Ancestral Tales, 400 pages of scholarship dedicated solely to A City in Its Fullness!\n\nJuly 7, 2024\n\nThis is a cry for help: I read the first ~200 pages and am struggling to continue reading. David Zvi tweeted at me just a few weeks ago, in a different context all together, that it's okay not to finish a book, and I immediately thought about CiIF. I am a least putting it aside for now, but it'll sit on my coffee table and I will cast guilty glances its way until the end of the year.\n\nI'm particularly perturbed because of how important it feels to me. First, I feel like SY Agnon is being quoted again and again at the tables, funerals, hespedim that I'm attending, listening to. His attendance to a religious contemporary emotional literary mood is obvious but I wondered if there was something else to understand. Second, he's a Nobel Prize winner - surely there is more there. Third, the first chapter brought me to tears. \"Hayim smiled at me the way the dead smile when they see that you think they are alive,\" (p24), \"he came close to me, until I found myself standing next to him, and there was no distance between us except that created by the lowness of my spirit.\" (p28) - his project is so obvious to me, so necessary, his emotional state so unbearable - what SY Agnon did for Buczacz is not all that different than what I dream of doing for Igliya (https://akoschitzky.substack.com/arch...). But when I got started putting some stories, it seemed critical to edit, draw out the complexities, delete the repetitive elements and expand on the assumed insider language. Agnon's stories are on the other hand almost as if they were dictated directly from Baba's mouth. Sometimes they are too metaphorical, too instructional, too instrumental, idk. Are Hasidic mayses worthy of Nobel prize, and I'm just too close to them to see them plainly?\n\nShould I be reading a different Agnon? Should I be reading in Hebrew? A novel instead of the short stories, do those have more depth? Does anyone have the recs, the experience, the criticism? I'll buy you a coffee and pastry. Feeling needy\n\nJanuary 29, 2023\n\nA moving elegy to Agnon's hometown of Buczacz. Rather than take the lachrymose approach of telling of its last days, the author chose to focus on it \"in its fullness\". He tells of the history of the town, from its founding through the era of Tach veTat, right up to the post-World War I period. He alludes to, but never explicitly details its destruction. The various tales are given over in English by different translators, and end notes help provide context. What shines through in these stories is the author's deep immersion in the Jewish world, in the sea of Talmud, in the life of Torah. His language is replete with Jewish expressions, allusions to Biblical and Talmudic phrases, Yiddish humor and worldview. The end-papers are lovely and give an historical flavor to the volume. Some of the stories are deeply touching, and all carry the same tenor as tales from Rabbi Zevin, so much so, that aside from those that are clearly within the realm of magical realism, I gained the impression that some of this is based on historical fact."
