        "text": "S.Y. Agnon (born July 17, 1888, Buczacz, Galicia, Austria-Hungary [now Buchach, Ukraine]—died Feb. 17, 1970, Reḥovot, Israel) was an Israeli writer who was one of the leading modern Hebrew novelists and short-story writers. In 1966 he was the co-recipient, with Nelly Sachs, of the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nBorn of a family of Polish Jewish merchants, rabbis, and scholars, Agnon wrote at first (1903–06) in Yiddish and Hebrew, under his own name and various pseudonyms. Soon after settling in Palestine in 1907, however, he took the surname Agnon and chose Hebrew as the language in which to unfold his dramatic, visionary, highly polished narratives.\n\nAgnon’s real literary debut was made with Agunot (1908; “Forsaken Wives”), his first “Palestinian” story. His first major work was the novel Hakhnasat kalah, 2 vol. (1919; The Bridal Canopy). Its hero, Reb Yudel Hasid, is the embodiment of every wandering, drifting Jew in the ghettos of the tsarist and Austro-Hungarian empires. His second novel, Ore’aḥ Nataʿ Lalun (1938; A Guest for the Night), describes the material and moral decay of European Jewry after World War I. His third and perhaps greatest novel, ʿTmol shilshom (1945; “The Day Before Yesterday”), examines the problems facing the westernized Jew who immigrates to Israel. This is neither a realistic story (like some of the early tales) nor a symbolic autobiography, yet it can be understood only in the light of Agnon’s own actual and spiritual experience.\n\nAll Agnon’s works are the final result of innumerable Proust-like revisions, as is shown by the many manuscripts in existence and by the variety of the printed texts. Already there are two widely different versions of his collected works, one in 11 volumes (Kol sipurav shel Shmuel Yosef Agnon, vol. 1–6, Berlin, 1931–35; 7–11, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, 1939–52) and one in 8 volumes (Tel Aviv, 1953–62). The archaic structure of his prose presents great difficulties for the translator, yet even in translation his power is unmistakable.\n\nAgnon edited an anthology of folktales inspired by the High Holidays of the Jewish year, Yamim nora’im (1938; Days of Awe, 1948), and a selection of famous rabbinic texts, Sefer, sofer, vesipur (1938). An autobiographical sketch appeared in 1958. Translations of his works include In the Heart of the Seas (1948; Bi-levav yamim) and Two Tales (1966; Edo ve-Enam)."
