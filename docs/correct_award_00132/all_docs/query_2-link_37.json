        "text": "(1891–1970). German poet and dramatist Nelly Sachs became a poignant spokesperson for the grief and yearnings of her fellow Jews. When, with Shmuel Yosef Agnon, she was awarded the 1966 Nobel Prize for Literature, she observed that Agnon represented Israel whereas “I represent the tragedy of the Jewish people.”\n\nNelly Leonie Sachs was born on December 10, 1891, in Berlin, Germany. She was the daughter of a prosperous manufacturer and grew up in a fashionable section of Berlin. Sachs began writing verse at age 17. Romantic and conventional, her poems of the 1920s appeared in newspapers but were mainly for her own enjoyment.\n\nAs the advent of Nazism in Germany darkened her life, she sought comfort in ancient Jewish writings. In 1940, after learning that she was destined for a forced-labor camp, she escaped to Sweden with the help of the Swedish novelist Selma Lagerlöf, with whom she had corresponded and who interceded with the Swedish royal family on her behalf. Sachs lived with her mother in a one-room apartment, learned Swedish, and translated German poetry into Swedish and vice versa.\n\nSachs’s poems from those years combine lean simplicity with imagery variously tender, searing, or mystical. Her famous “O die Schornsteine” (“O the Chimneys”), in which Israel’s body drifts upward as smoke from the Nazi death camps, was selected as the title poem for a 1967 collection of her work in English translation. Another collection in English translation, The Seeker, and Other Poems, was published in 1970.\n\nSachs’s best-known play is Eli: Ein Mysterienspiel vom Leiden Israels (1951; Eli: A Mystery Play of the Sufferings of Israel, included in the O the Chimneys collection). Other books include Und Niemand Weiss Weiter (1957; “And No One Knows How to Go On”) and Gluehende Raetsel (1964, “Glowing Riddle”). Sachs died on May 12, 1970, in Stockholm, Sweden."
