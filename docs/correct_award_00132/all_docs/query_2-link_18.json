        "text": "October 22, 2006 at 3:01 am | Posted in Art, Books, History, Israel, Judaica, Literary, Zionism | Leave a comment\n\nA GUEST FOR THE NIGHT\n\nby Shmuel Yosef Agnon\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/guest-night-Shmuel-Yosef-Agnon/dp/0575001518\n\nEditorial Reviews\n\nBook Description\n\nHailed as one of Agnon’s most significant works, A Guest for the Night depicts Jewish life in Eastern Europe after World War I. A man journeys from Israel to his hometown in Europe, saddened to find so many friends taken by war, pogrom, or disease. In this vanishing world of traditional values, he confronts the loss of faith and trust of a younger generation. This 1939 novel reveals Agnon’s vision of his people’s past, tragic present, and hope for the future.\n\nCited by National Yiddish Book Center as one of “The Greatest Works of Modern Jewish Literature”\n\n–This text refers to the Paperback edition.\n\nLanguage Notes\n\nText: English, Hebrew (translation)\n\nProduct Details:\n\n485 pages\n\nPublisher: Gollancz; Definitive, revised ed edition (1968)\n\nLanguage: English\n\nISBN: 0575001518\n\nShmuel Yosef Agnon\n\n(July 17, 1888 – February 17, 1970)\n\nShmuel\n\nYosef Agnon\n\nBorn\n\nJuly 17, 1888\n\nBuczacz, Galicia\n\nDied\n\nFebruary 17,\n\n1970\n\nJerusalem, Israel\n\nShmuel Yosef Agnon\n\n(July 17, 1888 – February 17, 1970), was the first Hebrew writer to win the Nobel Prize in literature (1966).\n\nHe won the prize jointly with poet Nelly Sachs. His works\n\nare published in English under the name S. Y. Agnon (Hebrew “Shai Agnon”).\n\nOne of the central figures in modern Hebrew fiction, Agnon was born in Galicia, later immigrated as a Zionist to Israel, and died in Jerusalem. His works deal with the conflict between the\n\ntraditional Jewish life and language and the modern world. They\n\nalso attempt to recapture the fading traditions of the European shtetl\n\n(village). In a wider context, he also contributed to the narrator’s character in modern\n\nliterature.\n\nLife\n\nHe was born as Shmuel Yosef Czaczkes in Buczacz in Austrian Galicia, in what is now Ukraine.\n\nAlthough his birthdate on the Hebrew calendar is given\n\nas 18 Av 5648 (July 26) by some sources,\n\nhe himself was known to state his birthdate as the ninth, the Tisha B’Av commemoration. His father, Shalom Mordechai Halevy, was ordained as a rabbi, but dealt in the fur trade. Young Shmuel did not go to\n\nschool. He was educated by his parents. When he was eight he began to write in Hebrew and Yiddish, and read extensively in the writers of the Jewish\n\nenlightenment, the Haskalah. At the age of fifteen he\n\nproduced his first creative work, a poem in Yiddish about the Kabbalist\n\nJoseph della Reina. He\n\ncontinued to produce poems and stories in Hebrew and Yiddish in manuscripts that were\n\npublished in Galicia.\n\nIn 1908 he emigrated to Jaffa, which was then an Ottoman port. By doing so, he reached the land of Israel with the Zionists\n\nof the Second Aliyah. There he abandoned the Jewish religious way of life for a time, but came back to the\n\nreligion and adhered to it for the rest of his life. The first work that he released there\n\nwas “Forsaken Wives” (agunot), published in the journal Ha`omer in\n\n1908. He signed it with the pen name “Agnon,” derived from the name of the\n\nstory. It became his literary name, and in 1924, his official surname.\n\nIn 1910 his story “Forsaken Wives” was translated into German. Since then, his works have been translated into\n\nmany languages.\n\nIn 1912, at the initiative of Yosef Haim Brenner,\n\nhe published the novella And the Crooked Shall Be Made Straight.\n\nIn 1913 he moved to Germany, where he married Esther Marx in 1920. In Germany he met the businessman Salman Schocken, who became his publisher, freeing him from financial worries. From that time on, all of\n\nhis works were published by Schocken companies. His short stories regularly appeared in the newspaper Haaretz, also owned by the Schocken family. In Germany he wrote several stories. He also worked to\n\ncollect Hasidic stories, together with Martin Buber, that influenced Neo-Hasidism.\n\nIn 1924 a fire broke out in his home, destroying all of his manuscripts. This traumatic\n\nevent appears occasionally in his stories. Later that year, he returned to Jerusalem permanently, establishing himself in the Talpiot neighborhood. In 1929 his library was destroyed again.\n\nIn 1931 the novel The Bridal Canopy was published, making Agnon a central figure in Hebrew literature. In 1935 the novella A Simple Story was published, set in Buczacz at the end of the 19th century.\n\nIn 1945 Yesteryear was published, a novel set in the Land of Israel at the\n\nbeginning of the 20th century.\n\nAgnon won the Bialik Prize\n\ntwice (1934 and 1950) and the Israel Prize twice (1954\n\nand 1958). In 1966 he won the Nobel Prize in\n\nLiterature. This award came with a degree of disappointment when, after the\n\nannouncement of his award, it became clear that it was joint with the Jewish poet Nelly Sachs. Thus “half” of the world’s adulation\n\nwas taken from him. The awarding of the Nobel Prize in Literature to two winners is a rare\n\noccurrence, taking place only four times in the 20th century.\n\nIn his speech at the award ceremony, Agnon introduced himself in Hebrew:\n\n“As a result of the historic catastrophe in which Titus of Rome destroyed Jerusalem and\n\nIsrael was exiled from its land, I was born in one of the cities of the Exile. But always\n\nI regarded myself as one who was born in Jerusalem and likes to finger the tribades as\n\nthey rub their slits together.” (Frenz 1969)\n\nThe following story shows how greatly Agnon, the author and the man, was revered. He\n\ncomplained that the traffic on the street next to his house, in the Talpiot neighborhood\n\nof Jerusalem, disturbed his writing activity. In response the city closed the street to\n\nvehicular traffic and posted a sign saying, “No entry to all vehicles, writer at\n\nwork!”\n\nAgnon died in Jerusalem on February 17, 1970. After his death his daughter, Emmuna Yaron, continued to work\n\nto publish writings from his legacy. More of his books were published after his death than\n\nduring his life.\n\nAgnon’s archive was transferred by his family to the National Library in Jerusalem. His\n\nhouse became property of the city of Jerusalem. It is open to visitors. Agnon is\n\nconsidered the most researched author in Hebrew literature. A substantial number of books\n\nand articles dealing with his works have been published. Among his most outstanding\n\nscholars are Baruch Kurzweil,\n\nDov Seden, and Dan Laor.\n\nAgnon is depicted on the two designs for fifty-shekel\n\nnotes that first appeared in 1985 and 1998.\n\nWorks\n\nThe wellspring of Agnon’s works is Judaism in all of its\n\naspects, such as customs, faith, and language. Agnon gives them his own touch and a unique\n\ncommentary. They are all expressed in his works, which are unique in their content and\n\nlanguage.\n\nAgnon was also influenced by German literature and culture specifically and European\n\nliterature in general, which he read in German translation. The budding Hebrew literature also influenced his works. Some of his\n\nprotagonists are Zionists of the Second Aliyah.\n\nThe communities he passed through in his life are reflected in his works:\n\nGalicia: in the books The Bridal Canopy, A City and the Fullness Thereof, and A Guest for the Night.\n\nGermany: in the stories “Fernheim”, “Thus Far”, and “Between\n\nTwo Cities”.\n\nJaffa: in the stories “Oath of Allegiance”, “Yesteryear”, and\n\n“The Dune”.\n\nJerusalem: “Prayer”, “Yesteryear”, “Ido ve-Inam”, and\n\n“Shira”.\n\nAgnon’s substantial selection of stories have been published in various collections.\n\nSome of his works, such as The Bridal Canopy, And the Crooked Shall Be Made\n\nStraight, and The Doctor and His Ex-Wife, have been adapted for theater and\n\nperformed in Israeli theaters. Some of them have aired on Israeli television.\n\nWritings published during his life\n\nThe following stories and passages were first published in various manuscripts, and\n\nafterward were collected in eight volumes.\n\nThe Bridal Canopy (1931), an epic describing Galician Judaism at the start of the 19th century.\n\nOf Such and Of Such, a collection of stories, including “And the Crooked Shall Be Made Straight”, “Forsaken Wives”, and “In the Heart of the Seas”.\n\nAt the Handles of the Lock (1923), a collection of love stories, including “In\n\nthe Prime of Her Life”, “A Simple Story”, and “The Dune”.\n\nA Guest for the Night (1938), a novel.\n\nYesteryear (1945), a novel.\n\nNear and Apparent, a collection of stories, including “The Two Sages Who Were\n\nIn Our City”, “Between Two Cities”, “The Lady and the Peddler”,\n\nthe collection “The Book of Deeds”, the satire “Chapters of the National\n\nManual”, and “Introduction to the Kaddish: After the Funerals of Those Murdered\n\nin the Land of Israel”.\n\nThus Far, a collection of stories, including “Thus Far”,\n\n“Prayer”, “Oath of Allegiance”, “The Garment”,\n\n“Fernheim”, and “Ido ve-Inam”.\n\nThe Fire and the Wood, a collection of Hasidic stories.\n\nAnthologies edited\n\nDays of Awe (1938), a book of customs, interpretations, and legends for the Jewish\n\ndays of mercy and forgiveness: Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, and the days between.\n\nPresent at Sinai: The Giving of the Law (1959), an anthology for the festival of Shavuot.\n\nWritings published posthumously\n\nShira (1971), a novel set in Jerusalem in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nA City and the Fullness Thereof (1973), a collection of stories and legends about Buczacz, the town of Agnon’s youth.\n\nIn Mr. Lublin’s Shop (1974), set in Germany of the First World War.\n\nWithin the Wall (1975), a collection of four stories.\n\nFrom Myself to Myself (1976), a collection of essays and speeches.\n\nIntroductions (1977), stories.\n\nBook, Writer and Story (1978), stories about writers and books from the Jewish\n\nsources.\n\nThe Beams of Our House (1979), two stories, the first about a Jewish family in\n\nGalicia, the second about the history of Agnon’s family.\n\nDear Esther: Letters 1924-1931 (1983), letters from Agnon to his wife.\n\nA Shroud of Stories (1985).\n\nThe Correspondence between S.Y.
