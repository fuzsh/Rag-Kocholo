Agnon's works are written in old-fashioned Hebrew and are required reading in Israeli secondary schools and universities. Despite this, only a few of his works have been translated. His notable novels include \"The Bridal Canopy,\" which tells a story set in Poland; \"A Guest For the Night,\" recounting his experiences during a tour of Jewish communities in 1932; and \"Only Yesterday,\" which depicts the early struggles of pioneers in Israel. Agnon married Esther Marx in 1919, and they have a son and a daughter. Shmuel Yosef Agnon, an Israeli writer, was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1966.
