Born in the town of Buczacz in eastern Galicia. As a child he delved into the study of literature and foreign languages, ​​and as a teenager he published poems and short stories in Hebrew magazines. In 1908 he immigrated to Israel as a young writer and published his first story - \"Agunot\", which subsequently changed his last name to Agnon. In 1919, while living in Germany for several years, he married Esther Marx. In 1924, the couple returned to Israel and settled in Jerusalem. His unique work was greatly influenced by the Jewish sources alongside the spirit of the Hebrew Yishuv and modern literature, translated into many languages and enjoyed worldwide success. Agnon is considered the most researched writer in Hebrew literature, and for his extensive and unique legacy he won the 1966 Nobel Prize in Literature.",
