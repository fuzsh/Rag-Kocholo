        "text": "Born in Buczacz, Galicia, Austro-Hungarian Empire. His father was a rabbi. He did not receive formal education, but from his father he learned the haggadah and from his mother German literature. When he was eight years old he began writing in Hebrew and Yiddish, and at the age of 15 he published his first poem in Yiddish. In the following years he began to publish regularly and wrote 70 poems in those languages. In 1909 he decided to settle in Palestine (at that time under Ottoman rule) attracted by the Zionist ideal, where he lived in Iafo and adopted a secular way of life. Shortly thereafter, however, he would return to Jewish tradition and remained an observant Jew for the rest of his life.\n\nHis first short story, Agunot (abandoned wives) was published in Palestine in 1908 under the name Agnon, which resembled the title of the story, and which became its official name after that.\n\nIn 1913, World War I forced him to return to Europe, and he left Israel to settle in Germany, where he lived for eleven years. Young Zionists liked his style which combined the traditional and the modern. While in Germany he met Salman Schocken, a wealthy businessman, who became his admirer and benefactor. With his help, Agnon had the opportunity to not worry about his personal finances, which made it possible for him to write as much as he wanted. However, this period of tranquility and happiness ended when, on June 6, 1924, a fire destroyed all of the family. manuscripts of him. He then permanently left Germany in the face of the growing influence of Nazism, and settled permanently in Jerusalem in the Talpiot district. His return to Jerusalem was not entirely pleasant, as five years later a new setback would end up undermining his writings and his personal library during the Arab riots of 1929.\n\nIn 1932 he was recognized as one of the central figures of modern Hebrew literature when he published the first edition of his selected works, including The bridal pavilion.\n\nHis texts have the characteristic of combining the new with the old, making it possible for the reader to often not know how to distinguish where reality begins and where fantasy ends. His characters speak for themselves in an attempt to understand themselves and their surroundings. In Guest for one night, an anonymous narrator visits his hometown in Galicia after an absence of many years. The effective basis of this story was his own view of his life in Buczacz in 1930. The novel reflects the desperation of the Jewish world during this time.\n\nEtmol Shilshom (Yesterday and the day before yesterday) is considered Agnon's greatest novel. It is a powerful description of Palestine in the days of the second aliyah, but its sadness reflects the period in which it was written: the years of the Jewish Holocaust. Many of his books are about Buczacz, while others are popular rabbinic collections.\n\nHe received many awards during his lifetime, including the Israel Prize in 1954 and 1958 and the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1966, the first awarded to a Hebrew writer. He also received the Bialik Prize (1934 and 1950), the Ussishkin Prize (1940).\n\nSource: Wikipedia"
