In the center of the story is one of the pioneers in the land of Israel who decides to return on Wednesday, religious Jews, familiar to him from childhood. Complex situations and interlacing motifs of the novel raised in it moral issues, wholeness and inner rhythm of the narrative, full of symbols of the sinister image of a mad dog, from the bite of which kills the hero, put the novel on one of the highest peaks of Jewish literature."
