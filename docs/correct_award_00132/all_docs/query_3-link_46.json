        "text": "It has been half a century since Shmuel Yosef Agnon won the Nobel Prize in Literature. Yet he is one of those laureates for whom the prize has not translated into universal fame. Like Claude Simon (France) or Camilo José Cela (Spain), Agnon remains largely the possession of his original audience. In his case, however, defining that original audience is a difficult matter. Agnon wrote in Hebrew—he is the only Hebrew writer to win the Nobel—and he lived in Israel, in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Talpiot, where his house now stands as a museum. But although Israeli readers can read Agnon in the original, today even they may have a hard time with his books.\n\nAccording to Jeffrey Saks—a rabbi and the editor of a new series of editions of Agnon’s work in English, published by Toby Press—this is because Agnon assumed that Hebrew speakers would always be familiar with Judaism: its “rituals, phrases [and] concepts,” as well as with the many strata of the three-thousand-year-old Hebrew literary tradition. But, Saks observes, “this may no longer be the case,” with the result that “Agnon and the other Hebrew classics get whittled away each year from school curricula and chain-store bookshelves.” Many Israelis, in other words, no longer have the religious background necessary to grasp all of Agnon’s meanings, while the highly religious are unlikely to read a writer who, for all his deep roots, is unmistakably ironic, unsettling, and thoroughly modern.\n\nAnother way of putting this is that Agnon’s identity, like Jewishness itself, maps uneasily against modern Israeli identity. It could hardly be otherwise, since Agnon, born in 1888, was fifty-nine when the Jewish State was established. By then, he had spent nearly half his life in Palestine, where he moved in 1908, but he was born in the very different world of Jewish Eastern Europe, and from 1912 to 1924 he lived in Germany, where he was exposed to the latest literary and intellectual currents. When he started writing in Hebrew, in the first decade of the twentieth century, it was not yet the daily language of a modern society but still mainly the preserve of Jewish sacred and intellectual tradition. And his writing mines that tradition in ways that, Hebrew readers agree, are nearly impossible to communicate in translation. Agnon’s prose recalls the style and the archetypes of the Bible, the Talmud, medieval commentators, and Hasidic folktales. His homeland is as much a language as it is a piece of territory.\n\nWhen Agnon went to Stockholm to collect his Nobel, he emphasized the fact that his writerly identity was, above all, a Jewish identity. He described himself as a descendant of the Levites, the Israelite tribe that served in the ancient Temple service: “In a dream, in a vision of the night, I saw myself standing with my brother-Levites in the Holy Temple, singing with them the songs of David, King of Israel, melodies such as no ear has heard since the day our city was destroyed and its people went into exile.” Yet this same writer was deeply influenced by such European masters as Knut Hamsun and Gustave Flaubert, and his own work bears comparison with other modernist writers obsessed by place and ancestry, including James Joyce and William Faulkner.\n\nThe puzzle of Agnon’s identity is encapsulated in his very name. Agnon, the Hebrew name by which he became universally known, was his own invention. He was born Shmuel Yosef Czaczkes, in the town of Buczacz, which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and is now part of Ukraine. At the age of nineteen, he left home to settle in Palestine. This was the early period of the Zionist movement, when thousands of Eastern European Jews were settling in the Ottoman province. These immigrants were a small but ferociously dedicated group, whose members included many of the founding figures of the future State of Israel. Their mission could be summed up in a famous Zionist slogan, “To Build and Be Built”: in creating a new Jewish society, they would re-create themselves.\n\nTaking a new name was a standard part of this process. David Ben-Gurion, the first Prime Minister of Israel, arrived in Palestine in 1906 as David Gruen, and later exchanged his name for a Hebrew one. The young Czaczkes signed himself Agnon when he published his first story in Palestine, modelling the name on the story’s title, “Agunot,” and eventually adopted it as an all-purpose nom de plume. Many Zionists chose names with inspiring meanings or mythological resonances, but agunah (the singular form; agunot is the plural) is a Jewish legal term, referring to a married woman whose husband refuses to grant her a divorce. The plight of the agunah is an ancient and still relevant problem in Jewish law, which gives men but not women the power to issue a divorce.\n\nIn a way that would prove characteristic of his imagination, the young Agnon wrote his story as an ironic commentary on this word and this idea. “Agunot” is the tale of a failed marriage, told in the brief compass of a legend and the richly embroidered language of Biblical poetry. Dinah, the daughter of a wealthy man in Jerusalem, is betrothed to Ezekiel, a rabbinic prodigy who is imported all the way from Poland to be her groom. Their marriage is arranged by Dinah’s father, but each of the spouses secretly loves another: Ezekiel’s heart remains with a girl back home, while Dinah is pining for an itinerant artist named Ben Uri. They are married in a splendid feast, but their mutual loneliness leads to divorce, and Ezekiel leaves Jerusalem to return to Poland.\n\nThis theme, of individual choice and romantic love thwarted by parental edict and tradition, is a long-standing one in literature. But, within the context of Jewish experience in the early twentieth century, it is especially potent as a symbol of encroaching modernity. The Tevye stories of the Yiddish author Sholem Aleichem, written around the same time and made famous by the musical “Fiddler on the Roof,” have a similar theme. Although “Agunot” takes place in the anytime of folklore, Agnon sees the situation through a twentieth-century lens, emphasizing the high psychological and erotic cost of obedience to convention and authority. Another modernist touch is the depiction of Ben Uri as a genius of art, for whom artistic creation is a form of prayer, or takes the place of it. He is so wedded to his craft that he ignores Dinah, who is enraged by his indifference. Like Tonio Kröger, the eponymous hero of Thomas Mann’s nearly contemporary short story, Ben Uri is cut off from ordinary human relationships by the demands of his art.\n\nBut the most shocking thing about “Agunot,” given the time and the place in which it was written, is that it portrays another kind of failed “marriage”: between Jewish immigrants and the land of Israel. Ezekiel, who represents the best of Eastern European Judaism—its piety, devotion, and intellectual power—cannot find happiness in Jerusalem: “His feet are planted in the gates of Jerusalem and stand on her soil, but his eyes and his heart are pledged to houses of study and worship abroad, and even now, as he walked in the hills of Jerusalem, he fancies himself among the scholars of his own town, strolling in the fields to take the evening air.”\n\nImmigration to Israel is referred to, in Hebrew, as aliyah, which means “ascent.” To go from Diaspora to Israel is to exchange the lowlands for the heights. Agnon himself had just made this very exchange, but in his art he is drawn to a tale of descent, of a mismatch between the Jewish spirit and the Jewish homeland. What’s more, he named himself after this story, as though his role as a committed Zionist artist were not to affirm the Zionist narrative but to probe and question it. In this mixing of engagement and ambiguity, Agnon set a precedent followed by later generations of Israeli novelists, including Amos Oz (who wrote a study of Agnon) and David Grossman.\n\nThe atmosphere in which Agnon lived during his first years in Palestine is beautifully evoked in a book that he published some thirty years later, “Temol Shilshom,” which was translated by Barbara Harshav in 2002 as “Only Yesterday” (Princeton). It is considered his masterpiece and has a claim to being the Great Israeli Novel. While the setting and many of the details are drawn from Agnon’s own experience—and several real-life figures appear in the book’s pages—the mature author made the crucial choice not to write an autobiographical story. Instead, he made his hero, Isaac Kumer, a naïve and thoroughly average man. Isaac is a passive and uncomprehending witness to history, rather than a history-maker. In this way, Agnon makes possible a subtle kind of comedy, beginning with the novel’s first paragraph, in which he describes his hero’s vision of Palestine, filled with “vineyards and olive groves, the fields enveloped in grains and the orchard trees crowned with fruit.” It is a fertile, peaceful Eden, apparently. But, immediately afterward, Agnon writes, “A man of imagination was Isaac, what his heart desired, his imagination would conjure up for him.” He says no more, but it is enough to alert the reader that nothing is going to happen the way Isaac expects; his innocence and idealism will be constantly ground down by the reality of life in Palestine.\n\nThe Jewish community in which Isaac arrives is small but passionately divided. Those divisions, like the failed marriages in “Agunot,” threaten to make a mockery of Isaac’s Zionist dream. Even before he lands in the port of Jaffa (now a part of the metropolis of Tel Aviv, whose founding is depicted in the novel), he finds himself arguing with a fellow-passenger on the ship. Isaac is a young, secular, political Zionist; the old man he confronts is a religious Jew, and he is travelling to Palestine in the spirit of pilgrimage, as aging Jews have aspired to do throughout history. In Isaac’s contemptuous view, such people “came only to add dust to the dust of the Land of Israel.”\n\nLittle does Isaac know that, by the end of the book, he will be married to this old man’s pious granddaughter. Agnon portrays Isaac’s life in Palestine as a series of such unexpected developments, each of which takes him farther away from his initial goal. Like many socialist Zionists, Isaac arrives with the intention of becoming a farm worker, in the belief that agriculture is the purest and most redemptive kind of labor. But he immediately discovers that even Jewish landowners do not want to employ inexperienced Jewish workers; they prefer to hire Arabs. Instead, Isaac ends up as a housepainter in Jaffa, someone who covers up surfaces rather than nourishing roots. And Jaffa, in Agnon’s telling, stands for the same values that Tel Aviv does in Israel today—secularism, pleasure-seeking, modernity. In all these respects, it is the opposite of Jerusalem, the ancient capital, which at the time “Only Yesterday” describes had barely expanded beyond the narrow, impoverished confines of the Old City.\n\nIsaac Kumer’s story takes him back and forth between these cities, and all that they represent: past and present, orthodoxy and Zionism, traditional marriage and sexual experimentation. But, in this novel of symbols, the wildest and most memorable allegory does not involve Isaac at all; rather, it concerns a dog that seems to wander into Agnon’s story and then runs away with it. One day, in a fit of whimsy or cruelty, Isaac paints the words “crazy dog” on the back of a stray Jerusalem mutt. This idle action condemns the dog to misery, since everyone who encounters him is convinced that he has rabies, and he is driven from place to place with curses and hails of rocks.\n\nIt is impossible not to read the story of the dog—who is eventually named Balak, which sounds like the Hebrew word for “dog” spelled backward—as a parable of Jewish history itself. Like the Jewish people, Balak is marked for a persecution that he can neither understand nor avert. His suffering leads him, like Job, to challenge Providence: “Balak complains to Heaven and shouts, Arf arf, give me a place to rest, give me righteousness and justice. And when Balak’s shout is heard, they assault him with stones and sticks.” But during the course of the novel Agnon expands and complicates the allegory, with the result that it is no longer so clear; he even makes fun of the efforts of the characters in the book to figure out what Balak’s story means. Like Kafka—a writer whom Agnon said he never read—Agnon presents us with a parable that turns out to be illegible, as if to show that, in a twentieth-century novel, meaning itself must be made endlessly problematic. In this way, “Only Yesterday,” though an emphatically local story, makes a place for itself in the pantheon of international modernism.\n\n“Only Yesterday” was published in Palestine in 1945, which means that it was being written at the time the Holocaust was taking place. If ever there was a moment when piety and solidarity might have seemed compelling literary values, this was it. Agnon, however, refuses both, in favor of a complex and unsettling chronicle of an often mythologized period in Israeli history. One might say that, for Agnon, Israel represented the reality and the future of Jewish life, and of his own adulthood. His writing about it is ambivalent and ironic, like adult life itself. Piety and nostalgia belong to the past—which is why Agnon’s writing never glows with a warmer love than when he is describing the town he left as a teen-ager, Buczacz.\n\nEven in his stories about Buczacz, Agnon is far from innocent in his celebration. In some of his works, he gives the town a pseudonym, Shibush, which is related to the Hebrew word for “muddle” or “blunder.” Agnon’s Zionism implied a harsh judgment on Diaspora life, which had left the people of Buczacz, and those of thousands of other Jewish towns, helpless in the face of persecution. Yet even the pessimists of that generation could not have imagined how totally Eastern European Jewry would be destroyed. After 1945, to write about Buczacz was to write about a world of martyrs, as Agnon makes clear in his post-Holocaust story “The Sign.” This story, written in an autobiographical first person, shows Agnon in Jerusalem during the Second World War, as the news of the devastation of Buczacz reaches him:\n\nThe neighborhood was quietly at rest. No one stopped me on the street, and no one asked me for news of the world. Even if they had asked, I wouldn’t have told them what had happened to my city. The days have come when every man keeps his sorrows to himself. What would it help if I told someone else what happened to my city? His city surely had also suffered that same fate.\n\n“The Sign” is the first story in “A City in Its Fullness,” the newest volume in the Toby Press Agnon Library. The Hebrew original of the book was published in 1973, three years after Agnon’s death, and included more than a hundred stories about Buczacz, written in the nineteen-fifties and sixties. In a sense, it can be taken as Agnon’s literary transformation of the genre known as the yizkor-bukh, or “memorial book.” Such books were published after the Second World War by survivors of many towns in Eastern Europe, in an attempt to record the names of the dead and something of the way of life now irretrievably lost.\n\nAgnon’s memorial book about Buczacz, however, is on an altogether different scale: a hundred and forty stories (the English edition selects twenty-seven of them), including several of novella length. In this vast corpus of tales, Agnon creates a combination of chronicle and atlas, in which the historic Jewish life of Buczacz is raised to the level of myth. A number of stories recount the legendary piety of the town’s rabbis and sages, portraying a Jewish ideal that unites immense learning with extreme humility. In “Rabbi Turei Zahav and the Two Porters of Buczacz,” a rabbi grows concerned that his lifework, a “book of commentaries,” may be fatally flawed. As penance, he becomes an itinerant beggar, until one day he enters a study hall and hears two porters learnedly debating a point of law; when one of them finds a copy of the rabbi’s book on the shelf and uses it to prove an argument, the rabbi is finally vindicated in his own eyes. “This is one of the stories that people used to tell in Buczacz in the time when Buczacz was full of Torah study and all of its sons were surrounded by Torah,” Agnon concludes, harking back to an idyllic past in which even manual laborers were religious prodigies."
