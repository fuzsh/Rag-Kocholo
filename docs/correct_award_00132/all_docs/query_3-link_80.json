        "text": "Shmuel Yosef Agnon, actually Chachkes is an Israeli novelist. Winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature for 1966, he is the author of novels and short stories depicting the Hasidic community at the turn of the 20th century. He grew up in a family with strong ties to Jewish tradition. Self-taught; from the age of three to nine he studied in three cheders, including with his father. He studied German and Talmud with private teachers, and Hasidic literature at a Chortkov Hasidic synagogue. He read the literature of Galician enlightened Jews, and later also German and Scandinavian works, a result of his mother's stories about such literature heard in his youth. In 1908 he emigrated from Galicia (he lived there in Buczacz, in what was then Austria-Hungary) to Palestine and settled in Jaffa; from 1913 to 1924 he stayed in Germany. In 1929, his library was destroyed during Arab riots in Jerusalem.\n\nHe began writing at the age of eight; initially in Yiddish, and since settling in Palestine in Hebrew. His best-known Yiddish work is Toint-tanc(Dance of Death). In Palestine he made his debut with short stories already written in Hebrew: Agunot(Abandoned Wives) and Wehaya heakov lemishor(Crooked Will Become Straight). While in Germany, he and Martin Buber intended to publish Hasidic short stories; they published some of them in the collection Polin.\n\nList of short stories:\n\nTwo scribes who lived in our city\n\nA parable with a moral\n\nWork\n\nVinegar factory\n\nA story with a goat (Fable)\n\nThe lost book\n\nKidnappers\n\nIdo and Ejnam\n\nDance of Death"
