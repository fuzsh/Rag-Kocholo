        "text": "Two Jewish Writers Win Nobel Prizes\n\n(From the PAS Bulletin - November 8, 1966)\n\nIt is particularly significant during Jewish Book Month to note that the Swedish Academy has awarded the Nobel Literature Prize to two outstanding Jewish authors \"each of whom represent Israel's message to our time.\"\n\nShmuel Yosef Agnon, 78 years of age, who lives in Jerusalem, and Nelly Sachs, 74, who writes poetry in German, will share the 1966 award which is worth nearly $60,000. Mr. Agnon, the first Israeli to win a Nobel Prize, was cited by the Academy \"for his profoundly characteristic and narrative art with motifs from the life of the Jewish people.\" Nelly Sachs, a refugee from the Nazis, is a Swedish subject and writes only in German. She has published several anthologies among which are \"The Habitation of Death\" and \"Eclipsed Stars.\" The Academy has honored her for her \"outstanding lyrical and dramatic writing, which interprets Israel's destiny with touching strength.\"\n\nIn recognition of the 50th anniversary of the noteworthy achievements of S.Y. Agnon and Nelly Sachs listen to excerpts from Rabbi's Judah Nadich's lecture series \"Giants in the Modern Library of Israel.\""
