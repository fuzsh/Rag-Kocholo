        "text": "Not long before we drive to his favorite sushi bar in Los Angeles, Joaquin Phoenix, the actor, tells the story of how he became a vegan.\n\nIt was October 28, 1977, his third birthday, and Phoenix and his family were aboard a cargo ship bound for Miami from Venezuela. His parents had just abandoned their lives as followers of a notorious religious cult, the Children of God, which was led by a charismatic former preacher named David Berg, who called himself Moses. Phoenix’s parents, who spent much of the late 1960s wandering the West Coast in a VW microbus, had become missionaries, traveling around the southern U.S., Venezuela, and Puerto Rico, and giving birth to Rain, Joaquin, and Liberty along the way. To sing about God, Rain and first-born River went busking on the street. The organization made Phoenix’s parents “the archbishops” of Venezuela and Trinidad.\n\nIn those years, Children of God had not descended fully into the darkness and perversion for which it became infamous, including the use of sex for recruitment and allegedly introducing children to sex at a young age. The family was far from Berg’s orbit. When they realized what was happening, the Phoenixes, whose last name was then Bottom, left the cult, disillusioned, penniless, and expecting a fifth child, Summer.\n\nThe freighter was carrying a container with Tonka toys, and the crew gave Phoenix a truck and made him a birthday cake. “I vividly remember this cake, and I think it was probably the first cake that I ever had, like a proper cake,” Phoenix says. “I remember the toys. I had never gotten a new toy before, and really the most jarring and intense memory was what led to our veganism.”\n\nHe and his older siblings, River and Rain, were watching flying fish leap out of the water when Joaquin observed some fishermen pulling their catches off their rods and throwing them violently against nails that had been pounded into the wall of the vessel. At that moment, he says, it dawned on him that the fish his parents had been feeding him back in Venezuela, where they lived in a beach house and sang praise songs to God on the streets, were actually these helpless, flapping creatures being tortured to death on deck.\n\n“It was so violent, it was just so intense,” he recalls. “I have a vivid memory of my mom’s face, which—I have seen that same face maybe one other time, where she was completely speechless because we yelled at her. ‘How come you didn’t tell us that’s what fish was?’ I remember tears streaming down her face.… She didn’t know what to say.”\n\nWhen Joaquin Phoenix unsheathes his chopsticks for the seaweed salad at Asanebo, the Japanese restaurant in Studio City, this story adds to the queasy feeling that the actor may be offended by the platter of raw mackerel that shows up at the table.\n\n“Dude, do your thing,” he shrugs, casual in a black T-shirt and rolled-up pants, graying hair slicked back. “Not everyone is as evolved.”\n\nHe’s kidding. Maybe. With an impish smile, he lets the comment hang. “It’s up to you,” he says, and then bursts into maniacal laughter: “It’s so fucked up!”\n\nLater, he tells me to “enjoy your swastika” before stepping out for a cigarette. Phoenix’s moral intensity and sense of comedy—that laugh—define his talent as an actor, along with a sense of vulnerability. In his latest role, as Arthur Fleck in the psychological comic book drama Joker, he transforms himself into a tortured and mentally unstable loner driven to highly inhumane acts of violence—against humans—in pursuit of a quixotic stand-up comedy career. On camera his cackling laughter, sheepish grin, and slow-blinking eyes channel unexpected heartbreak and humanity in a DC Comics villain from Batman—in fact, erasing any trace of comic books and instead presenting a character study of a fevered vigilante suffering from mental illness, alienation, narcissism, and latent rage. Directed by Todd Phillips as an homage to grimy 1970s and ’80s classics, especially those made by Martin Scorsese with Robert De Niro (who costars), the film’s artful depiction of an alienated white man performing acts of nihilistic savagery has already rekindled the conversation over the relationship between Hollywood violence and the real-life kind seen last summer in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio.\n\nAfter the Venice Film Festival, where Joker premiered, a fiery debate erupted over the movie’s nuanced depiction of a character not unlike the “involuntary celibates,” or incels, behind recent mass shootings. Suddenly, the film’s likeness to Taxi Driver reminded those with long memories that Scorsese’s 1976 film partially inspired the would-be assassin John Hinckley Jr., who shot Ronald Reagan in 1981. Variety called Joker “the rare comic book movie that expresses what’s happening in the real world,” but Richard Lawson, writing for Vanity Fair, expressed another common sentiment, that it might be “irresponsible propaganda for the very men it pathologizes.” In Venice, Joker took home best film, which likely would have been more controversial had Roman Polanski not won the Grand Jury Prize. “I didn’t imagine that it would be smooth sailing,” Phoenix says of the press reaction. “It’s a difficult film. In some ways, it’s good that people are having a strong reaction to it.”\n\nPhoenix mostly wants to let the film speak for itself. “There’s so many different ways of looking at it,” Phoenix says of the Arthur Fleck/Joker character. “You can either say here’s somebody who, like everybody, needed to be heard and understood and to have a voice. Or you can say this is somebody that disproportionately needs a large quantity of people to be fixated on him. His satisfaction comes as he stands in amongst the madness.”\n\nPhoenix has always had an intuitive feel for the dark side of the human psyche. In Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here, from 2017, he played a damaged hit man who kills rich men who rape underage girls by hitting them with a ball-peen hammer. Before that, in Spike Jonze’s Her—during which he met his fiancée, costar Rooney Mara—he was a lonely depressive who finds love in his computer’s operating system. In 2010, he flummoxed everyone by playing a semifictional version of himself as a self-destructive actor trying to build a hip-hop career for the mockumentary I’m Still Here—a movie that further complicated the line between reality and fiction when director Casey Affleck was sued for untoward behavior by two female crew members—before returning with a bravura performance in The Master, as the unhinged devotee of an L. Ron Hubbard-like quasi-religious leader. That began a run of finely wrought indie performances. “From a very young age, I had an allergy to—what’s the word?—to just frivolous, meaningless kids’ stuff,” he says. “From an extremely young age. And I don’t know why. I’m sure you want some Freudian explanation, perhaps there is.”\n\nObserving the darkness in his work, it’s tempting to look for its source in his personal history. It wasn’t long ago that he was still being referred to as “the second most famous Phoenix,” his name associated most closely with the death of his cult-legend brother, River, in 1993, which Joaquin witnessed, along with sister Rain, in front of the Viper Room on Sunset Boulevard, then co-owned by Johnny Depp. The public memory of his brother has faded enough that Joaquin is now the most familiar Phoenix, but the tragedy is never far for Joaquin himself. In part that’s because reporters never stop asking him about it. But he was also deeply influenced by his brother, and by his death, even if he remains reluctant to draw a straight line between his unusual background and his private tragedy and his talent for inhabiting the morose, damaged, violent, and otherwise anxiety-riddled characters he takes on—roles he seems vividly made for.\n\n“I try not to fucking think about that,” he says, with that half-comic ambiguity. “Why am I doing this fucking interview? You’re going to ruin my acting.”\n\nJoaquin Phoenix is, as he tells me at one point, “as sensitive as any motherfucker is.” When I show up to his mission-style bungalow on a steep canyon road in the Hollywood Hills, he’s in the kitchen boiling a pot of sweet potatoes for his vegan dogs, Oskar and Soda, the latter a large white pit bull mix he rescued from euthanasia 13 years ago. Soda has an allergy to direct sunlight, which means she must be kept out of the sun from nine to five. Phoenix bought her a specially made suit to go to the beach. “She looks so fucking cool but she doesn’t like it,” he says.\n\nHe lives with Mara, who in addition to playing his ex-wife in Her was Mary Magdalene to Phoenix’s Jesus Christ in the Garth Davis-directed Mary Magdalene. (“Obviously it’s a part I was just born to play,” Phoenix says dryly.) He believed Mara despised him during the making of Her but later learned she was just shy and actually liked him too. “She’s the only girl I ever looked up on the internet,” he says. “We were just friends, email friends. I’d never done that. Never looked up a girl online.”\n\nPhoenix has recently undergone hypnosis to quit smoking, a habit he took up as a teenager, but it doesn’t seem to be working out. His fingernails are chewed to nubs and he keeps two packs of American Spirits and several lighters close at hand. “I eat really healthy,” he says. “I don’t really like junk food. I don’t like processed foods. Right? But I still can—like, I’ll fuck up a bag of chips. Like a fuckin’ Subway sandwich and shit.”\n\nFor Joker, he went on an extremely restrictive diet—advised by the same doctor who helped him lose weight for The Master—and lost 52 pounds. After the film, he gained back 25, but the oily image of his severe, wraithlike body in the trailer for Joker arrived like a shock last spring, evidence that Phoenix had once again gone all in on a role. As Arthur Fleck, Phoenix leans into his physical features, from the scar on his upper lip (not a surgically fixed cleft, he says, but a nonsurgical scar he was born with) to his leonine gaze, sad-sack grin, and distended shoulder, which he was also born with. Phillips told him he looked like “one of those birds from the Gulf of Mexico that they’re rinsing the tar off.” “He’s got the most interesting form,” he says. “He’s so beautiful.”\n\nPhillips, who directed the comedies Old School and the Hangover series, pitched the idea of a Joker movie to Warner Bros. as a kind of anti-superhero film, with practically no CGI effects or cartoonish plots, but instead a dark realism drained of heroics. Phillips had found it increasingly difficult, he says, to make comedies in the new “woke” Hollywood, and his brand of irreverent bro humor has lost favor.\n\n“Go try to be funny nowadays with this woke culture,” he says. “There were articles written about why comedies don’t work anymore—I’ll tell you why, because all the fucking funny guys are like, ‘Fuck this shit, because I don’t want to offend you.’ It’s hard to argue with 30 million people on Twitter. You just can’t do it, right? So you just go, ‘I’m out.’ I’m out, and you know what? With all my comedies—I think that what comedies in general all have in common—is they’re irreverent. So I go, ‘How do I do something irreverent, but fuck comedy? Oh I know, let’s take the comic book movie universe and turn it on its head with this.’ And so that’s really where that came from.”\n\nThe result is a drama that doubles as a critique of Hollywood: an alienated white guy whose failure to be funny drives him into a vengeful rage. With co-screenwriter Scott Silver, Phillips conceived an origin story for the Joker as a for-hire party clown and mentally ill loner in a late ’70s/early ’80s Gotham, drawing from the filmic palette of classics like Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, and One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. He says he conceived the character with Phoenix in mind and gave him the script in late 2017. What followed was four months of conversations at Phoenix’s canyon house. Phoenix queried Phillips endlessly before he joined the film—part of his process, it turns out, which also included asking his mother to examine the script. In pitching the movie to Phoenix, Phillips told him he needed to think of the film as a heist movie.\n\n“What are you talking about?” Phoenix asked, confused. “There’s barely any action in it.”\n\nPhillips cracked, “We’re gonna take $55 million from Warner Bros. and do whatever the hell we want.”\n\nFor Phoenix, the decision was more personal.\n\n“To me, there was a period of time when we think about all those great films from the ’70s, it wasn’t a genre,” says Phoenix. “It wasn’t like, this is a drama. It was just a movie. Like Dog Day Afternoon is, like, intense, heartbreaking, and fucking funny. And those are the movies that I love. And those are the movies that I pursue.”\n\nTo develop the character of Arthur Fleck, Phoenix did research on narcissism and criminology and studied the movements of Buster Keaton and actor Ray Bolger, the scarecrow from The Wizard of Oz, which inspired the highly creepy dance that so acutely expresses Fleck’s private madness. During one scene, the screenplay called for Fleck to shut himself in a bathroom after several murders, looking for a place to hide his gun. Phoenix and Phillips decided it didn’t feel right, and while they discussed the scene, Phillips played Phoenix some newly composed music for the movie. Phoenix began dancing, an elegant, tango-like movement, and Phillips asked the cameraman to start filming with a handheld camera, just the three of them in the room while a crew of 250 waited outside. The scene became part of an eye-popping trailer, set to a Jimmy Durante tune, “Smile.”\n\nThe muse of the movie, in many ways, is one of its costars, Robert De Niro, who plays a late-night talk show host modeled in part on Johnny Carson. “He is my favorite American actor,” Phoenix says of De Niro. “I got the impression from him that he did things in [a] scene, certain behaviors, certain gestures or movements, whether the camera was on him and registering it or not.”\n\n“For me, I always thought that acting should be like a documentary,” he continues. “That you should just feel whatever it is that you’re feeling, what you think the character is going through at that moment.”\n\nIronically, the two barely spoke on the set, in part because of their similar acting methods and artistic superstitions. “I didn’t like to talk to him on set,” says Phoenix. “The first day we said good morning, and beyond that I don’t know that we talked much.”\n\n“His character and my character, we didn’t need to talk about anything,” says De Niro. “We just say, ‘Do the work. Relate as the characters to each other.’ It makes it simpler and we don’t [talk]. There’s no reason to.”\n\nThere was nonetheless some disagreement on the method to the method. Before shooting his scenes, De Niro wanted the cast to do a read-through of the script, a practice he considered standard. Phoenix, however, has often disliked doing read-throughs, part of his own mercurial “let it happen” style. Recalls Phillips: “Bob called me and he goes, ‘Tell him he’s an actor and he’s got to be there, I like to hear the whole movie, and we’re going to all get in a room and just read it.’ And I’m in between a rock and a hard place because Joaquin’s like, ‘There’s no fucking way I’m doing a read-through,’ and Bob’s like, ‘I do read-throughs before we shoot, that’s what we do.’ ”\n\nIn De Niro’s company offices in Manhattan, Phoenix mumbled his way through the script and afterward went into a corner to smoke. De Niro invited him to his office, on a different floor, to talk, but Phoenix demurred. “He’s in front of Bob, and he goes, ‘I can’t, I gotta go home,’ recalls Phillips, “because he felt sick after that read-through, he didn’t like it.”\n\nPhillips urged him to come up—this was Robert De Niro, after all—and Phoenix reluctantly agreed. After they talked over a few minor issues, De Niro turned to Phoenix, took his face in his hands, and kissed him on the cheek. “It’s going to be okay, bubbeleh,” he said.\n\n“It was so beautiful,” says Phillips.\n\nLast July, Warner Bros. previewed Joker to a select group of journalists at a screening room in a West Hollywood hotel. After watching Phoenix as the maniacal creep Arthur Fleck, I went outside to discover my rental car had been towed—the rookie move of a non-Angeleno. It was 8:30 at night, just in time for a prescheduled phone call from Joaquin Phoenix.\n\n“Where are you?” he asked, offering to come to my aid. There was an uncomfortable moment as I told him the location. In an uncanny and unfortunate coincidence, it was directly behind the Viper Room. Phoenix paused, then said: “I know that’s on Sunset, but what’s the cross street?”\n\nHaving just seen Phoenix in his harrowing role, it was hard not to think of that grim night, October 31, 1993. It was three days after Joaquin Phoenix’s 19th birthday. He had accompanied River and Rain to the club, which was frequented by the Hollywood brat pack of the era, including actors Keanu Reeves and Christina Applegate. One version of the story is that a well-known guitar player handed River a Dixie cup containing a liquid concoction of heroin and cocaine, and he drank it—well over a lethal dose, the coroner later determined. As River convulsed on the sidewalk outside the club and Rain looked on, Joaquin made the heartbreaking 911 call. The transcript of his panicked words—“Please get to him. Please! Please!”—would be printed in newspapers around the country.\n\nNow, 26 years later, Phoenix drives up in a beat-up old black Lexus, warm and smiling in a pair of white karate pants and well-worn Converse sneakers, a cigarette dangling from his lip and his hair not so much combed back as yanked into submission. Just back from practicing karate, he goes immediately into the foyer of the nearby hotel to ask the manager for help finding where the car was towed, and a few minutes later we’re driving to Hollywood Tow Service, a fluorescent-lit garage on an empty street, talking about Ray Bolger and Phoenix’s recent experiences with cryotherapy, where you expose your body to subzero temperatures (“It’s amazing, you gotta try it”).\n\nIn 1991, River famously told Details magazine that he lost his virginity at age four, which seemed to cement a narrative about what happened inside the cult. “You really believe that?” says Phoenix. “It was a complete and total joke. It was just fucking with the press. It was literally a joke, because he was so tired of being asked ridiculous questions by the press.”\n\n“My parents were never negligent,” he says. When Joaquin and his siblings were children, his family was living in Venezuela, apart from the Children of God community in the United States. In 1977 they received a letter from the leader describing a new practice of “flirty fishing,” using sex to bring in followers. “They got some letter, or however it came, some suggestion of that, and they were like, ‘Fuck this, we’re outta here,’ ” Phoenix says. “I think they were idealists, and believed that they were with a group who shared their beliefs, and their values. I think they probably were looking for safety, and family. Leaving a country that had assassinated a president and any number of civil rights leaders within a few fucking years, which is so hard for me to fathom, right?”\n\nHis mother, who changed her first name to Heart, later said “it took several years to get over our pain and loneliness” after leaving the cult.\n\nAfter the family arrived in Florida, the singing and dancing continued, with River and Rain forming a brother-sister act, winning talent contests and gaining the attention of local media. When Phoenix’s father stopped working because of an old back injury, his mother took charge: She sent an article about the kids to an old acquaintance from the Bronx, Penny Marshall, who was then starring in the ABC sitcom Laverne & Shirley. Marshall’s office wrote back to say the family should stop in if they were ever in L.A., but hastened to warn them not to move there if they weren’t already coming. The family, having changed their last name to Phoenix, packed their station wagon and moved to L.A. “We said, ‘Well, that’s good enough,’ ” says Heart Phoenix. “It turned out that we never did meet them.”\n\nHeart got a job as a secretary for an executive at NBC and met a high-profile child agent named Iris Burton, who got the children into commercials and bit parts on TV. To supplement their income, the kids sang their original songs like “Gonna Make It,” written by River, and busked for money in matching yellow shirts and shorts. They studied dance; Joaquin became an avid break dancer.\n\nThe Phoenix family were both morally rigid—the children would not appear in soda or fast food commercials—and totally freewheeling: When Joaquin asked his mother if he could change his name, she told him yes, and he went to see his father, who was in the yard raking leaves. A moment later his new name was Leaf.\n\nIn some ways, his early roles as Leaf Phoenix set the tone for his career. In an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, for instance, he played a deaf rich boy who witnesses a murder and hatches a plan to blackmail the murderer. He also costarred with River in an ABC Afterschool Special called “Backwards: The Riddle of Dyslexia.”\n\nIn the late ’80s, Phoenix was getting roles in middlebrow kid films like SpaceCamp and Russkies, which didn’t necessarily meet his high standards but earned him his own press. He came off as eccentric and hyperactive. “During the course of an interview, he could not stay still,” went one profile in the Orlando Sentinel, written when he was 14 and known as Leaf. “He rocked back and forth in his chair, sometimes half out of it. He took a brief ride on a motorized skateboard and once fell to the floor to examine a tiny black bug.”\n\n“Leaf believes in animal rights (tuna harvesting often kills baby dolphins),” it continued. “He loves fried tofu. He wants more people to care about world peace.”\n\nPhoenix says he first understood the power of acting while playing a role in Hill Street Blues in 1984. While being briefed at the police station about his mentally unstable father, Phoenix wallops a victim’s advocate in the face and then kicks and screams while being restrained. “After they said ‘cut,’ I remember the other people and the other actors, I could feel that they went, ‘Oof,’ ” he recalls. “There was this moment and I felt it too, like my body was fucking buzzing. I’ll never forget this feeling. It’s like the first time you drink or smoke a joint or something. You’re like, holy fuck, my whole body is aware of it in a way that I’ve never been aware. It felt incredible. It was an incredible feeling, and I think the organism went, ‘Oh, well, huh, we’re tapping something.’ ”\n\nHe pauses to consider his own story. “Does that seem believable? Really? Because if somebody told me that, I’d be like, ‘You’re 7 years old [in fact, he was 10]. You really had a knowing of what the fuck you were?’ ”\n\nDissatisfied with life in Los Angeles, the Phoenixes moved back to Florida, settling in Gainesville, and River bought the family a ranch in Costa Rica.\n\nAs River’s fame grew with Running on Empty, about a family of ’60s radicals on the run, and an Indiana Jones movie, playing a young Indy, Joaquin wasn’t getting any appealing offers and took a break to hang out on a beach with his dad in Mexico, learning Spanish and riding motorcycles. After he returned to the States, his brother was shooting the indie classic My Own Private Idaho with director Gus Van Sant. River began tutoring his younger brother about cinema. “My brother came home and he was like, ‘We need to watch this movie called Raging Bull.’ And I’m like, ‘What?’ Prior to that, I watched Caddyshack and Spaceballs. And Woody Allen comedies.”\n\nNot long after, he recalls his brother making a strange prediction. “He suggested I change my name [back to Joaquin] and then, I don’t know, six months later, whatever it was, we were in Florida, we were in the kitchen, and he said, ‘You’re going to be an actor and you’re going to be more well known than I am.’ Me and my mom looked at each other like, ‘What the fuck is he talking about?’\n\n“I don’t know why he said that or what he knew of me at the time. I hadn’t been acting at all. But he also said it with a certain weight, with a knowing that seemed so absurd to me at the time, but of course now, in hindsight, you’re like, ‘How the fuck did he know?’ ”\n\nWhen he was 16, Phoenix says, he was sent a dead frog in the mail to dissect for his biology studies, which prompted him to discontinue his studies. When his parents protested, he dared them “to have me arrested.” (His mother says she doesn’t recall this.) Around that time, he appeared in Ron Howard’s Parenthood as a brooding, inarticulate adolescent grappling with his budding sexuality. Heart remembers her son’s intense emotional commitment to the part, especially in a scene where Joaquin’s character trashed his father’s dental office and broke down crying. Afterward, she says, “I had to come on the set and hold him, because he just inhabited what he believed that young child felt.”\n\nPhoenix says that he and his siblings were not frequent denizens of clubs like the Viper Room. His brother had gone there in 1993, and reportedly stayed in hopes of playing music. “I don’t think it was typical. To be honest, I don’t think it was really—I don’t think it’s what he would have wanted to have done with his night. He’d, just before that, spent time just playing me new songs that he’d written.”\n\nA few years later, when he transformed completely for a career-defining role as Johnny Cash, whose own brother had died when Cash was 12, the number one question Phoenix seemed to get asked was how his brother’s death informed his acting—a question he resented at the time, expressing anger at being cast as the “mourning brother.”\n\nSmoking a cigarette on the shaded patio behind his home, his dogs running in and out of the dog door, he considers his response to those inquiries over the years. “Because I came out publicly as an actor at that time, I suddenly was confronted with having to talk about something that already was very public, in the public sphere,” he says, “where you’re in a five-minute interview, every five minutes and everything, at a fucking junket.\n\n“It felt like, ‘Well, I’m not sure this is the right place and it feels insincere to be talking about this and I can hear in your voice that you’re trying to sound like somebody who really cares and is interested, but let’s be fucking frank about what’s happening here.’ It was just much easier to go, ‘Fuck you,’ which is an easier thing for me for whatever reason, than to explain it.”\n\nNonetheless, his role as Cash defined him as an actor with an uncanny power to subsume himself in a role. “I think I had this realization that the experiences I was having as an actor were deepening, becoming more profound to me,” he says of that role. “There is this revelatory feeling, and it feels like every step you’re dancing closer and closer to the thing.”\n\nPhoenix emphasizes that “the thing” is not his brother’s death, not some Rosebud, as in the childhood sled that unlocks the psychic secrets of Charles Foster Kane in Citizen Kane. “It’s one, it’s one of the Rosebuds,” he says, “but it’s not a Rosebud in the way that people think. At all.”\n\nInstead Phoenix speculates that his affinity for characters like Arthur Fleck or Johnny Cash derives from something more ineffable, a “cosmic angst,” possibly something “prenatal.” “I think there is a combination of nature and nurture, obviously,” he says. “For whatever reason—and some of it is my upbringing.”\n\nBut the topic of River remains sensitive. Not even Phillips, who became good friends with Phoenix over the course of making Joker, ever felt comfortable enough to bring it up. At one point, after I ask a question about the Viper Room incident, Phoenix says, “You’re such a great, decent human being. That sounds like I’m being sarcastic. I am.”\n\nThis year, on the anniversary of River’s death, Rain (to whom Joaquin affectionately refers as a “fucking hippie”) will release an album called River, inspired by his memory and legacy. Before recording the album, which includes a duet with Michael Stipe, she sought the blessing of the family, including Joaquin, whom Heart calls the “patriarch” of the family, to address their private tragedy in public. He understood her need to communicate her experience. “She was right there, also, and so I think there was a lot that was put on me,” he says. “Then I was like, don’t fucking put that on me. Just fucking—I’ll let you know if there’s anything on me that we’re talking about.”\n\nAt the sushi joint, the magazine writer makes an uncomfortable error, inquiring about Phoenix’s dad: Where’s he living nowadays?\n\n“He lives in heaven,” Phoenix says flatly.\n\nWait, where’s that? Costa Rica?\n\n“No one’s ever been there,” he says.\n\nHe’s alive, right?\n\n“Oh is he? Oh cool, great,” he says sarcastically. “Let’s talk to him.”\n\nIn fact, Phoenix adds, his father died four years ago of cancer, a development that didn’t make the news. “Suddenly, there’s a lot of holes in your research,” he says. “I was going to say I wouldn’t joke about that, but I actually would joke about something like that. But I’m not joking.”\n\nBut he considers the entertainment value of maintaining the ruse. “That would be so fucked up!” he laughs. “I could also just keep it up—‘I’m just fucking with you!’ ”\n\nLater, in the parking lot waiting for the valet to swing the Lexus around, he gives it another go: “I was just kidding before. He’s still alive.”\n\nI wait a beat. “Really?”\n\n“No, he’s dead. Sorry.”\n\n(In fact, he did die.)\n\nIt’s that blurring of reality and fiction that Phoenix enjoys so well, like a little glimpse from 2010’s I’m Still Here, which mixed Phoenix’s real-life public persona with an invented caricature of himself as a dilettante hip-hop artist, a role he developed as a send-up of Hollywood celebrity, complete with scenes depicting “Joaquin Phoenix” pawing a naked prostitute and snorting drugs. To this day, some people believe he went through a personal meltdown a few years ago. “I did the junket yesterday and a Brazilian guy said, ‘Are you still doing good music or are you still rapping?’ ” says Phoenix. “I said, ‘Are you serious?’ ”\n\nThe line between fiction and reality in I’m Still Here became even blurrier, however, when in 2010 two women, a producer and a director of photography on the movie, sued the director, Casey Affleck, for claims that included sexual harassment and emotional distress, with the women saying they were told that Phoenix, along with Affleck, used their bedroom during filming in Costa Rica to engage in “sexual activity” with two women. For a scene in the Palazzo hotel in Las Vegas, the suits claimed there were “several prostitutes, including male transvestites,” present at an evening shoot, with plaintiffs being told “none of the conduct that occurred in the hotel suite is in the version of the film that will be released to the public,” and claiming the behavior was purely for Affleck’s “gratification.”\n\nPhoenix and Affleck were brothers-in-law at the time (Affleck was married to his youngest sister, Summer), and the lawsuits seemed to puncture an uncomfortable hole in the film’s fictional conceit, bringing up the question of whether Phoenix is more like the self-involved dude-bro depicted in the movie than one would like to believe. The two had met on the set of 1995’s To Die For, and before Affleck married Phoenix’s sister in 2006, they lived in the same building in New York, enjoying Manhattan nightlife together, and once got matching tattoos in Italy, a black circle under the right arm.\n\nPhoenix says his lawyers advised him not to discuss the allegations against Affleck, who settled the suits in 2010. Last year, Phoenix told Xan Brooks from The Guardian that he was sympathetic to victims of power imbalances and expressed regret at not having been more vocal about abuses of power he witnessed in the past. While he wouldn’t elaborate on specifics with a reporter, he makes clear that he was not speaking specifically about the Affleck case, and that he himself did not witness sexual misconduct. What is clear is that Affleck’s subsequent divorce from Joaquin’s sister had personal consequences for Phoenix; he hasn’t spoken to Affleck “in many years,” he says. “My sister and him divorced. And I haven’t spoken directly to him or indirectly in a long time. Three or four years.”\n\nNowadays the line between fiction and reality has never been more porous. Last summer, Universal Pictures canceled the planned release of the film The Hunt, a “satirical social thriller” about a fictional human hunting ground, after the recent mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton. Though it’s based on a comic book character, Joker is uncomfortably close to current events as well: the story of a lone gunman with his own righteous rationale. Phillips is sensitive but fatalistic about the topic of copycat violence. “We’re making a movie about a fictional character in a fictional world, ultimately, and your hope is that people take it for what it is,” he says. “You can’t blame movies for a world that is so fucked up that anything can trigger it. That’s kind of what the movie is about. It’s not a call to action. If anything it’s a call to self-reflection to society.”\n\nWhen he took on the role, Phoenix says, he had to determine whether he could bring complexity and humanity to an ostensibly evil person.\n\n“I was going through [the script] and I realized, I said, ‘Well, why would we make something, like, where you sympathize or empathize with this villain?’ It’s like, because that’s what we have to do. It’s so easy for us to—we want the simple answers, we want to vilify people. It allows us to feel good if we can identify that as evil. ‘Well, I’m not racist ’cause I don’t have a Confederate flag or go with this protest.’ It allows us to feel that way, but that’s not healthy because we’re not really examining our inherent racism that most white people have, certainly. Or whatever it may be. Whatever issues you may have. It’s too easy for us and I felt like, yeah, we should explore this villain. This malevolent person.\n\n“There’s no real communication,” he continues, “and to me that’s the value of this. I think that we are capable as an audience to see both of those things simultaneously and experience them and value them.”\n\nFor now, Phoenix and Phillips are satisfied that they’ve slipped something that feels like auteur cinema under a tentpole usually reserved for blow-’em-up teenage fare—they pulled off the heist. Phillips tears up when he describes how Phoenix screened the final cut at Phillips’s house and emerged satisfied with the risk he had taken. “I started crying,” Phillips says. “And I’m crying again retelling it.”\n\n“Rooney said to me the other night, ‘Do you realize how many great opportunities you’ve had? These films?’ ” recounts Phoenix. “I said it’s true, I’ve been so fortunate, so many movies where I was like, I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to top this experience. The experience of making this movie. It was incredible that I found another one.”\n\nIn the past, Phoenix wasn’t able to play an all-consuming role like Arthur Fleck without grappling with some personal emptiness and neurosis after the experience. There was the insecurity of making the movie and the insecurity of promoting it. He was often uneasy about his performances and typically didn’t watch them. After filming the Cash movie, about the alcohol- and drug-addicted country star, Phoenix famously went into real-life rehab. At 44, he’s finding it easier to separate himself from his characters and simply go home. On a table in his house, he displays a white Styrofoam head adorned with a fake beard and moustache he wore in I’m Still Here. There’s “Joaquin Phoenix,” the actor, and then there’s Joaquin Phoenix, who’s getting married and who quit smoking the week after I saw him. “It was the hypnosis,” he says. Then he lapsed, in Venice. “I failed,” he confesses."
