I have always loved the name Joaquin ( pronounced wah-keen for those who havent heard it) I really like it, but im wondering if its the right way to go, just because it is unusual. I want his middle names to be Phoenix and Allen, and as my mum pointed out there is an actor named Joaquin Phoenix, but that is coincidental, so my babys name would be Joaquin Phoenix Allen, i really like it, but just looking for what others think? (thats IF i have a boy, obviously still dont know the sex yet) :)"
