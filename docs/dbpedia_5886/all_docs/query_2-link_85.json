So I got into London on the Saturday headed to Covent garden to get my number in the queue. They don't allow you to queue until late on sat evening so I decided to go to one of the pre BAFTA parties I heard Joaquin was headed to. So I waited outside annabels and exclusive club in Mayfair. There were a few other girls waiting for him too! So guys there had said they had met him during the day and was really nice a little weird but signed and took photos! This got me excited. A lot of excitement happened outside the club mainly between paps and the police! So much so that the stars were avoiding the front entrance and heading for the back! Joaquin included! When I heard I was so disappointed! So I headed back to Covent garden to start queuing! Yes if you want front row at the baftas you have to start queing the night before!! I won't bore you with my queing stories lets just say it was cold!!! So we got in the fan areas early Sunday afternoon and had to endure rain and snow! The celebs started to turn up around 5pm! Due to the cold the girls rushed inside but many of the actors stay out and signed!! I was getting worried as it was getting close to when they should be all inside and Joaquin hadn't arrived yet. Normally if they are late they are rushed to press!! But then all of a sudden I see him! I can't express the excitement of seeing him in the flesh a man you have worshipped and adored for so many years and there he was! He was working his way up the carpet signing autographs. His pa then start to drag him away half way down the carpet. My heart then plummeted thinking I'm not gonna meet him! Just as he passes us I shout out his name and shout that I've been here all night to meet him! He looks over and must have seen the desperation in my face! He then comes straight over to me! He asks if I d really been there all night and i was like yeah! I told him he was one of my fav actors and he thanked me. My friend next to me said she had loved him since space camp and he laughed at her and said really! I asked if I could have a photo and he said sure!! He then thanked me and signed a few more autographs up the line before being taken away to press! If though the meet only lasted a few minutes it will be remembered forever! Lets just say one thing joaquins eyes are amazing!! They are like this really light green. And when he talked to you he maintained eye contact so that he was really talking to you! And he was really softly spoken! and if you asked what one of his film character he was most like i would say lucius from the village! I must say he was one of the nicest celebs I've met! And really appreciated fans of his work! Sorry if this is long winded!!!!\n\nEdited by moderator Friday, March 1, 2013 2:33:27 AM(UTC) | Reason: Added photo for context.\n\nRank: Joaquin Devotee\n\nReputation:\n\nGroups: Registered\n\nJoined: 1/2/2013(UTC)\n\nPosts: 421\n\nLocation: Earth\n\nWas thanked: 3 time(s) in 3 post(s)\n\njoy wrote:\n\nkitten wrote:\n\nI glad the awards seasons is over but now no pictures of Joaquin , I guess it will be a long time before any new pictues of Joaquin will pop up, hugs\n\nThat's more than likely true, Kitten: it might be years! Joaquin deserves a rest anyway - if I was him, I'd be shattered with all the recent awards stuff.\n\nHere's another video. I know it's the BAFTAs again, but I'm kind of fascinated by it all. He appears completely different 'in action' to photographs, where he's not often been smiling (thus open to specualtion as to the reasons why). It's all complete madness! I didn't know he was left-handed....?\n\nI think when the moives low life and her come out wel will see something of Joaquin, I remember after ISH I saw no pictures of Joaquin for a year or more then one day there it was a video he did with liv and milley about voting on line something like that. I was so suprise to see him after so long of nothing, I do not know how it does it with no pictures but hope he is alright\n\nRank: Master of Joaquin\n\nReputation:\n\nGroups:\n\nJoined: 8/21/2012(UTC)\n\nPosts: 1,236\n\nLocation: Where the heart is.\n\nThanks: 3 times\n\nWas thanked: 39 time(s) in 31 post(s)\n\nKitten, I read that Inherent Vice is due to start filming in April, so if Joaquin is going to be in that film, then he'll probably be doing prep for that from now until then. Actually, I just read on Joaquin's imdb page that IV is in pre-production and he's playng Doc Sportello. So, looks like he's definitely in that film. Maybe we'll get some candids from the shoot come through.\n\nadmin wrote:\n\nHi Joy, I don't think he is left-handed... i think he was just signing with his left hand because he had a cigarette in his right hand (No surprise there then! )\n\nI didn't think he was either. I'm sure I'd have noticed before now if he was left-handed. He was obviously keeping his right hand for the important stuff then. Maybe the people who got an autograph from him just found it to be a sqiggle when they looked at it properly\n\nadmin wrote:\n\nIt would have definitely been more of a challenge to play guitar right-handed in Walk the Line, as Johnny Cash does, if he was naturally left handed... Maybe he's just that good an actor\n\nThat's a good point. I'm sure Freddie wrote that note with his right hand too.\n\nMiley Cyrus is such a pro. I saw her on Jonathan Ross' chat show ages ago and every opportunity she mentioned her record/tour/book/clothing line or whatever it was she was there to promote. You can see how tuned she is in the TWLOHA video. Joaquin obviously needs a computer tutorial."
