        "text": "It took Emma a few times to finally settle on her stage name. When she was 16, she had to ditch her first name Emily after joining the Screen Actors Guild and discovering there was another girl who shared her name.\n\nSpeaking to W magazine, the Oscar winner said: \"To ask a 16-year-old to pick a new name is really an interesting process because I was like 'I'm going to be Riley. My name is going to be Riley Stone.' And so my name was Riley Stone for about six months and I did a guest spot on Malcolm in the Middle and one day they were like, 'Riley, Riley,' and I had no idea who they were talking to and they were like, 'Hey, hey come on we need you on set.' And I was like, 'Oh I'm not Riley, I can't be Riley'.\" The actress finally settled on Emma because it was \"closer to Emily\".\n\nOn her birth certificate, the singer is Florian Cloud de Bounevialle O'Malley Armstrong, but Dido has always made it clear that Dido is now her real name and not simply a stage name. It derives from the mythical Queen of Carthage.\n\nDuring an interview with The Observer, she explained: \"To be called one thing and christened another is actually very confusing and annoying. It's one of the most irritating things that my parents did to me. ... Florian is a German man's name. That's just mean. To give your child a whole lot of odd names. They were all so embarrassing. ... I thought it was cruel to call me Dido and then expect me to just deal with it.\"\n\nThe Treasure singer was named after his father Peter Hernandez, but was nicknamed Bruno from a young age after his dad remarked that he looked like professional wrestler Bruno Sammartino.\n\nBruno added Mars to his stage name when he was pursuing a musical career in California. \"I felt like I didn't have [any] pizzazz, and a lot of girls say I'm out of this world, so I was like I guess I'm from Mars,\" he explained.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the name Whoopi was taken from a whoopee cushion. \"If you get a little gassy, you've got to let it go. So people used to say to me, 'You're like a whoopee cushion.' And that's where the name came from,\" the actress has said.\n\nOf her surname, she said: \"My mother did not name me Whoopi, but Goldberg is my name, it's part of my family, part of my heritage. Just like being black.\"\n\nThe actor adopted his stage name after claiming that people became suspicious of his birth name. He explained: \"Whenever I would call for an appointment, whether it was a job or an apartment, and I would give my name, there was always that hesitation and when I'd get there, it was always gone. So I thought, I got enough problems trying to get an acting job, so I invented Martin Sheen.\n\nIt's still Estevez officially. I never changed it officially. I never will. It's on my driver's license and passport and everything. I started using Sheen, I thought I'd give it a try, and before I knew it, I started making a living with it and then it was too late. In fact, one of my great regrets is that I didn't keep my name as it was given to me. I knew it bothered my dad.\""
