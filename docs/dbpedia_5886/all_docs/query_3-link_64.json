        "text": "A lot can be said with a name—especially in Hollywood. Choosing the right one could potentially make or break a career in showbiz. It'll either help fans easily remember you or could result in you blending in with the crowd. Opt for something too complicated and people might not be able to pronounce it, which could mean trouble come awards season. It's not as simple of a decision as you'd think!\n\nFor that reason, stars put a lot of thought into the choice. One of the biggest trends is going by a middle name. Maybe it sounds better (Meghan Markle does have a nice ring to it!), or perhaps it's just more unique (there's no denying Ashton Kutcher is more memorable than Christopher Kutcher). Other celebrities choose something more sentimental, like paying tribute to a late family member or honoring a mother or grandmother's maiden name. And when all else fails, a childhood nickname does the trick (we're looking at you, Miley).\n\nFrom royals to Grammy-winning singers and everyone in between, your favorite star's real name might surprise you. Learn all about how celebrities like Reese Witherspoon, Olivia Wilde, Katy Perry, and others ended up being called what you know them as today."
