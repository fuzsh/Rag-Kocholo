        "text": "Joaquin Phoenix is the latest actor to step into the shoes of Batman's iconic enemy, The Joker.\n\nAnd the first images from his take on the most murderous of clowns have been revealed.\n\nJoaquin is starring in an as-yet-untitled film, set in the 1980s, about a failed comedian who becomes one of Gotham City's biggest criminals.\n\nInstead of the heavy make-up we've seen on previous versions, Joaquin's take is (so far) altogether more subtle.\n\nAllow Instagram content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Instagram .

To view this content choose ‘accept and continue’.\n\nBatman first appeared on screens in the 1960s as a light hearted action adventure, with Cesar Romero playing The Joker opposite Adam West's polite caped crusader.\n\nThis was The Joker's least threatening hour, more interested in heists and theft than the vicious revenge dealt out by more recent portrayals.\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter."
