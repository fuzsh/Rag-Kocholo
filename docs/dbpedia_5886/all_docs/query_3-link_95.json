        "text": "best film: It is The Master (2012) here by a landslide. This is both a compliment to Paul Thomas Anderson’s film (one of the best of the 2010s decade) and sort of a nitpick at Joaquin Phoenix’s filmography. The number two film here is probably James Gray’s Two Lovers (2008) but that is a few steps down from The Master. Joaquin has a cluster back-end of the top ten quality of the year films (maybe as many as seven (7) – including all of the work with James Gray) but is lacking that second masterpiece or that film that seriously contends with The Master.\n\nbest performance: Joaquin Phoenix gives the best male acting performance of the 2010s in The Master so there is a decent sized gap in this category again between the top spot and everything else. Same here though – the overall depth is strong – there are performances like his turn as Johnny Cash (Walk the Line – 2005), his second time with Paul Thomas Anderson in Inherent Vice, and his project with Lynne Ramsay (You Were Never Really Here) – this is high quality work spilling out of his top five (5). It seems doubtful Phoenix will ever touch the highs of The Master and his work as Freddie Quell again – and that is totally fine. Freddie Quell is one of cinema’s great characters. Phoenix nails the ticks, the posture – his face a brilliant craggily façade. The processing sequence is screen acting at its finest.\n\nstylistic innovations/traits: Performances like Joaquin Phoenix’s in The Master do not come along often and still, he has enough here to make him anything but a one hit wonder sort of Peter Lorre or Malcolm McDowell-type resume (those two were not total one hit wonders like Bjork or Falconetti but still lean to that type of top heavy resume). One more big achievement would be crucial to help Phoenix climb up this list – and he has plenty of time. He was born in 1974 – the same year as peers Leonardo DiCaprio and Christian Bale. He is as talented as either of them. And, like both DiCaprio and Bale, Joaquin was a successful child actor. He followed in the footsteps of his older brother River Phoenix of course – who sadly passed away in 1993 at the age of 23. Joaquin had a few credits (including working with Gus Van Sant like his brother) in the 1990s – but 2000 was his breakthrough year – he stunned film fans in the immensely popular Gladiator, impressed in Quills and started his four (4) time connection with James Gray (The Yards). In one year, he showed he could act at the same level as Russell Crowe (white hot in 2000) and Kate Winslet (same). His work has been more than stellar since then with mentions as one of the best actors of the year in 2008, 2012, and 2019 (and close again in his strong 2013 with bot Her and The Immigrant). Joaquin is a four-time Oscar nominee (winning for Joker in 2019) with nineteen (19) total archiveable films and counting.\n\ndirectors worked with: James Gray (4), Paul Thomas Anderson (2), Gus Van Sant (1), Oliver Stone (1), Ridley Scott (1), Spike Jonze (1), Lynne Ramsay (1), Ari Aster (1). The James Gray collaborations seem to be over (nothing in the ten years from 2014-2023) and that is a shame because that was such an artistically fruitful partnership – but Phoenix seems to have no lack of promising auteur collaborations to choose to work with.\n\ntop five performances:\n\nThe Master\n\nTwo Lovers\n\nJoker\n\nWe Own the Night\n\nHer\n\narchiveable films"
