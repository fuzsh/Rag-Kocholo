        "text": "Joaquin Phoenix is gearing up for his next role — and it’s gonna be a gay one!\n\nDirector Todd Haynes made the announcement while doing the rounds at the Cannes Film Festival to promote his latest movie, May December.\n\n“There’s another movie I want to do in early 2024,” he told Les Inrockuptibles. “It’s a project that Joaquin Phoenix brought to me, and it’s set in the 1930s. A love story between two men, based on an original, very audacious scenario.”\n\nWith films like Velvet Goldmine, Far from Heaven, and Carol (which starred Phoenix’s wife, Rooney Mara) under his belt, a 1930s-set story about two men in love seems like an excellent next project for Haynes.\n\nHe also noted that this would be Phoenix’s first explicitly gay role, and fans agree that it’s about time.\n\ntwitter.com\n\n“Love that Joaquin Phoenix had a gay project he wanted to do and brought it to Todd Haynes. The correct move.”\n\ntwitter.com\n\n“@DiscussingFilm In the end, the gays always win!”\n\ntwitter.com\n\n“Rooney and Joaquin flipping a coin to decide who gets to be gay with Todd next.”\n\ntwitter.com\n\n“@roomforletters @FilmUpdates and not therese but theodore”\n\ntwitter.com\n\n“Joaquin Phoenix did not strut into the Colosseum in gold and monochrome cream 23 years ago for someone to say he’s now gonna play his first gay role.”\n\ntwitter.com\n\n“first gay role??? idk about that”\n\nEven without more information about the mystery film, fans are also already brainstorming who they would like to see cast opposite Phoenix in what they are fondly describing as “Carol, but for dudes.” If the movie does plan to film in early 2024, hopefully we will have more details to tide us over by the end of the year.\n\nIn the meantime, we can keep an eye out for May December, as well as Phoenix’s Joker: Folie à Deux, set for an October 2024 release.\n\nWhat is Joaquin Phoenix's real name?\n\nHis real name is Joaquin Rafael Bottom.\n\nWhat ethnicity is Joaquin Phoenix?\n\nHis mother is from a Russian/Hungarian Jewish family and his father is of British Isles descent.\n\nHow old is Joaquin Phoenix?\n\nPhoenix was born October 28, 1974."
