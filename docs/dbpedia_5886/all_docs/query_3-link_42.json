We shot on his family’s rural property in Florida. We did a number of different setups, and it was quite relaxed and fun.\n\nHe had a sweet disposition, but he did seem damaged in some way (was I projecting?). He reminded me of a young Montgomery Clift, so I mailed him a VHS copy of A Place in The Sun as a gift. He sent me a thank-you note on the back of an alligator postcard."
