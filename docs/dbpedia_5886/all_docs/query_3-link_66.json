        "text": "When John Travolta attended rehearsals for the 2014 Academy Awards, he had no trouble pronouncing the name Idina Menzel, the actress and singer who was set to perform the nominated âLet it Goâ from Frozen. Come the live telecast, though, Travolta invited the audience to welcome âAdele Dazeem.â\n\nMenzel found it funny. And in fairness to Travolta, heâs not alone. Plenty of people have trouble getting their tongues around the names of some notable entertainers, including musicians. (Irish and Welsh names can be particularly challenging, too.) Take a look at 25 actors from film and television that have to endure mispronunciations.\n\n1. Idris Elba\n\nThe Luther starâs name should be pronounced âIH-driss ELLE-ba,â not âEE-driss.â (The actorâs birth name is Idrissa; he changed it after enduring some childhood taunts.)\n\n2. Joaquin Phoenix\n\nPhoenix had the biggest commercial hit of his career with 2019âs Joker, a revisionist take on Batmanâs notorious villain. His name is pronounced âwah-KEEN.â\n\n3. Florence Pugh\n\nThe Midsommar and Black Widow star isnât âPugâ like in the dog or âpooâ like ... you know. Itâs âPew,â which Pugh herself described on Twitter as the noise you make when youâre âpretending to have a shoot out and you make all the noises yourself â¦ pew pew pew pew.â\n\n4. Matthew McConaughey\n\nThe actor broke out following a turn as a stoner in 1993âs Dazed and Confused. Both the spelling and pronunciation of his last name has proven challenging for people. Itâs not âMIC-CON-ah-hee,â but âmuh-KAH-nuh-HAY.â McConaughey says his name rhymes with âWhat did Madonna say?â And no, heâs never considered changing it.\n\n5. Brendan Fraser\n\nThe star of The Mummy franchise had an excellent 2022 and 2023 thanks to his Oscar win for Best Actor in The Whale. Itâs not âFRAY-sher,â though. Itâs âFRAY-zer,â which rhymes with razor.\n\n6. Lupita Nyongâo\n\nThe co-star of Black Panther has endured many maimings of her name over the years. Itâs âNYONG-oh.â\n\n7. Rami Malek\n\nMalek, who starred on Mr. Robot and inhabited Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody, sometimes gets âRAY-me.â According to the actor, itâs âRAH-me MAL-ek.â\n\n8. Margot Robbie\n\nThe Australian actress and Barbie star will typically see her first name given its dueâitâs âMAR-goââbut back home itâs âMA-go.â Her last name is âRAW-bee,â not âROBE-ee.â\n\n9. Keanu Reeves\n\nKeanu Reeves considered going by the stage name âChuck Spadinaâ (among others) because his agents thought his first name, which is Hawaiian, was âtoo ethnic.â Itâs pronounced âkey-AH-noo.â\n\n10. Domhnall Gleeson\n\nThe Irish actor has said his first name rhymes with tonal, just with a dâso youâd say âDOH-nal.â\n\n11. Thandiwe Newton\n\nThe actress admitted in 2021 that her first name has been misspelled as âThandieâ for most of her career. While correcting that, she also said itâs pronounced âtan-DEE-way.â\n\n12. Claes Bang\n\nThe Denmark native was recently in The Northman and has also played Dracula for the BBC. Itâs âClayzeâ (rhymes with maze). Bang isâwell, âbang.â Like bang, bang.\n\n13. Simu Liu\n\nThe star of Kimâs Convenience and Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings tweeted that his name is pronounced âSEE-moo LEE-ew.â He also corrected the common mistake made with his Marvel characterâs name: Itâs âSHONG-chee,â not âSHANG-chee.â\n\n14. Michelle Yeoh\n\nThe name of the 2023 Best Actress Oscar winner for Everything Everywhere All At Once is pronounced âYo,â not âYowâ or âYEE-oh.â\n\nRead More Articles About Commonly Mispronounced Names:\n\n15. Xolo MaridueÃ±a\n\nThe star of Cobra Kai and the upcoming DC film Blue Beetle says his name is âSHOH-loh mah-ree-DWEN-yah.â\n\n16. Andre Braugher\n\nThe star of Brooklyn Nine-Nine pronounces his name âAHN-dray BROW-er,â where Braugher rhymes with power.\n\n17. Chiwetel Ejiofor\n\nA very imposing name, but itâs not that difficult. Itâs âCHEW-it-tell EDGE-ee-oh-four.â\n\n18. Lea Seydoux\n\nThe James Bond actressâs name is French. Itâs pronounced âLAY-uh say-DOO.â The x is silent.\n\n19. Letitia Wright\n\nThe Black Panther star pronounces her first name âluh-TEE-shuh.â\n\n20. Mads Mikkelsen\n\nThe Danish actor (Casino Royale, Hannibal) is often cast in villain roles, but heâs typically polite in the face of people mangling his first name. While itâs easy to assume itâs âMads,â itâs actually âMass.â\n\n21. Mahershala Ali\n\nThe Moonlight and Green Book actor will soon be stepping into the shoes of Marvelâs vampire hunter Blade. Maybe that will prompt people to say his name correctly: Itâs âmuh-HER-shuh-luh.â He shortened it in 2012 from his full birth name, Mahershalalhashbaz (which you can see him pronounce in the video above).\n\n22. Saoirse Ronan\n\nThe Little Women and Lady Bird starâs Irish name can give people trouble. Itâs âSUR-shuh.â\n\n23. Daniel Kaluuya\n\nJordan Peele collaborator Daniel Kaluuyaâs last name is pronounced âkuh-LOO-yuh.â Heâs said people started pronouncing it correctly following the success of 2017âs Get Out.\n\n24. Giancarlo Esposito\n\nEspositoâs turns on Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, and The Mandalorian are just the most recent hits in a long career, dating back to a breakthrough role in 1989âs Do the Right Thing. His name is pronounced âjon-carloâ (make sure to roll the r) âess-POH-zee-toh,â not âespos-SITO.â\n\n25. Steve Buscemi\n\nThe character actor (Boardwalk Empire) might have the most maligned name in show business. Itâs so difficult that even Buscemi himself has managed to mispronounce it. The actor has said he uses âboo-SEM-eeâ while many others use âboo-SHEM-ee,â but neither is actually correct. In Italy, where Buscemiâs family is from, itâs pronounced âboo-SHAY-me.â\n\n26. Jake Gyllenhaal\n\nâThe only two places that [my last name] is pronounced correctly ... is in Sweden and in IKEA,â the actor told Conan OâBrien. So while Americans might pronounce it âJILL-in-hall,â go with âYEEL-en-HAULâ for that authentic Swedish feel.\n\n27. TimothÃ©e Chalamet\n\nSure, âTimothyâ will work, but Chalametâs father is French, so technically, itâs âTEE-moh-tay.â His last name is âSHAL-uh-may.â"
