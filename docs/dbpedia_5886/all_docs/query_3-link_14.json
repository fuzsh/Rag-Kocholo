        "text": "On January 26, 2006, Phoenix was in a car accident on a winding canyon road that overturned his car. Shaken and confused, Phoenix heard a tapping on his window and a voice say, \"Just relax\". Unable to see the man, Phoenix replied, \"I'm fine. I am relaxed\". Then managed to see that the man was famed, eccentric German auteur Werner Herzog, and Herzog replied, \"No, you're not\". After helping Phoenix out of the wreckage, Herzog phoned in an ambulance and vanished. The crash reportedly was caused by brake failure.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix and Heath Ledger won an Academy Award for their performances as the Joker, becoming the second pair of actors to win Academy Awards for playing the same character - the other pair being Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro, who won Best Actor and Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor respectively, for their portrayals of Vito Corleone.\n\nWas born Joaquin Rafael, but at the age of four, he decided that he wanted a more earthy name, like his elder siblings River and Rain, so while he was raking leaves with his father he decided on Leaf. In early roles, he was credited as Leaf Phoenix. In the early 1990s, he took back his birth name.\n\nAnnounced his retirement from acting in October 2008 and claimed he wanted to pursue a career as a rapper. This announcement was followed by several bizarre appearances and musical performances by Phoenix, which made the shocked public wonder whether it was all just an act or if his behavior was for real. His retirement from acting and his \"career\" as a rapper turned out to be a hoax, which was part of his movie I'm Still Here (2010).\n\nTwo days after his 19th birthday, he was in the company of his brother River Phoenix, his sister Rain Phoenix and River's girlfriend Samantha Mathis at The Viper Room in Hollywood, California when River Phoenix suffered an overdose of heroin and cocaine in the early hours of October 31, 1993. Phoenix called 911 from a call box located across the street from the club (co-owned by Johnny Depp who was performing on stage with his band at the time). A distraught Joaquin informed the 911 operator that his brother was \"laying on the cement\" had \"taken a Valium\" and was \"having seizures\", adding \"Please, [get here] because he's dying\". River Phoenix was pronounced dead at Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre at 1:51am, he was 23. Joaquin immediately returned to his home in Florida with his sister and mother (who had flown out to collect him). The incident was a high-profile celebrity death, with Joaquin's recorded 911 call released to the media and played repeatedly on news reports covering the story over the following weeks."
