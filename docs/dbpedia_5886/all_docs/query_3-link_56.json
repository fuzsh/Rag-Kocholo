        "text": "Was eating, as his onscreen wife Emily Blunt joked \"like, an almond every day,\" a bit nutty? Sure. But the Irish star really wanted to nail atomic bomb scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer's appearance. \"Oppenheimer had a very distinct physicality and silhouette, which I wanted to get right,\" he explained to The New York Times. \"I had to lose quite a bit of weight, and we worked with the costume and tailoring; he was very slim, almost emaciated, existed on martinis and cigarettes.\"\n\nThe British actor packed on more than 40 pounds for his Oscar-nominated performance as a beer-bellied con artist in 2013's American Hustle. He put on the same amount to play former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney in the 2018 movie Vice, which also earned him an Oscar nomination. The star dropped 70 pounds for the 2019 movie Ford v Ferrari, in which he plays slender race car driver Ken Miles. For the 2011 film The Fighter, which earned him his first Oscar, he lost about 30 pounds while gaining muscle.\n\nThe actress, who famously gained a reported 17 pounds to play the title role in Bridget Jones's Diary, did not have to change her physique to transform into Judy Garland for the 2019 film Judy, for which she won her first Oscar. You can thank the makeup and costume department for her transformation.\n\n\"Renée was extremely emotionally and artistically involved in Judy, the movie's costume designer, Jany Temime, who also worked on the Harry Potter films, told Vulture. \"It was her film. I think she really got into Judy's skin.\"\n\nZellweger told the outlet, \"Jany fit the costumes to Judy's posture. So the dresses didn't fit me unless I stood like I was supposed to stand. The zipper wouldn't go up.\"\n\nThe late actor received a posthumous Oscar in 2008 for his chilling and mesmerizing performance as The Joker in the second film in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. His look as the iconic villain differed greatly from those previously seen on past actors onscreen.\n\n\"What would it be if this guy slept in his makeup, this psychopath?\" makeup artist John Caglione Jr. told IGN. \"If he didn't spruce up his makeup for two or three weeks? He never changes his clothes It's those kinds of organic details that really helped.\"\n\nHe continued, \"You think of a clown's makeup and for the most part, they're pretty detailed with sharp lines. But this had to be the opposite of that.\"\n\nEver the chameleon, the 2014 Best Supporting Actor winner prepared to play a HIV-positive transgender woman by losing 40 pounds and only staying in character on set.\n\n\"I had done similar things with weight, but this was different,\" Leto told E! News in 2013. \"I think the role demanded that commitment…It was about how does that effect how I walk, how I talked, who I am, how I feel. You know, you feel very fragile and delicate and unsafe.\""
