        "text": "Joaquin Phoenix, who famously starred in hits Gladiator and Her, to name just two of his many starring roles, is a conundrum.\n\nWhile interviewing him I got the feeling that something unexpected was going to happen. I took time to frame my questions carefully. If I didn't phrase them correctly, I got the sense that verbal combat could ensue.\n\nI say \"feeling\", because it probably wouldn't. He's probably perfectly amiable - but his eyes had the power to unnerve me. Colourless glass beads that speak volumes, while his mouth opens with first responses, edited as he looks at me, brain ticking over, jet eyebrows raised, contrasting with almost transparent irises.\n\nWhen I read back over the conversation, I see that he's been sweet all along. Still, there's the illusion that at any moment he could be other than sweet, unpredictable.\n\n\"My feelings about the character are complex,\" he says.\n\n\"I hope that I can empathise and understand what's it like to be him, but there are other times when I think, you should take f**king responsibility as well.\n\n\"This is not somebody who is purely innocent even from the beginning. It's somebody who's a textbook narcissist. He demands that the world not only recognise him and want to hear his voice, but totally adore him too. I find those traits unbecoming, but that's what I liked about playing this character - there isn't an easy answer for any of the questions that the movie poses.\n\n\"I'm not in the camp of people who have total sympathy for him, those who feel that if somebody had just been nice to him everything would have been OK. I don't think that's the case.\"\n\nDespite the juicy role, Phoenix didn't jump at the chance to play Batman's nemesis. \"I've been struggling with decisions for the last few years,\" he says. \"I've been taking more time to make up my mind. It was a long process. Mostly, I wasn't certain that it was something I could pull off.\"\n\n\"Some of it is really that simple. There are some people that elicit the reaction: 'I don't think I could be around you longer than two weeks. How am I going to work with you?' So part of it is: do we like each other? Do we share the same sensibilities? Do we like the same kinds of films? Are we trying to say the same thing? And you want to challenge each other. Maybe that's what that underlying feeling encouraging me to be careful is all about,\" he says.\n\nPhoenix, who began his career calling himself Leaf, likes to challenge. It's not necessarily confrontational, but he will challenge you on things that others might let slide.\n\nHe elaborates: \"You don't want to be completely in step. It's good to have opposing energy that makes you push other people … and get pushed. I've been in a couple of situations where I didn't get along with the director.\n\n\"There was no struggle this time. I knew we were in sync the second time I met Todd. The first time was for 10 minutes when he gave me the script. The second time, we got together and talked, and I realised I really love this guy.\"\n\nHe confesses to sometimes being torn when it comes to taking on a role: \"Do I really want to go away and work, or should I hang out with family?\" Phoenix is engaged to actress Rooney Mara.\n\nIn this case, \"getting Phoenix to say yes took a couple of months\", says the director. \"He's done a lot of low-profile movies for the past few years because he prefers being under the radar and doing great work. He knew this wasn't going to be under the radar, so I think he was careful about committing.\"\n\nPhoenix debunks the idea of being affected negatively by the characters he portrays. \"Maybe that's true for others. When I hear other actors say, 'I had nightmares,' like, that sounds so cool. They were really committed. But I've got to be honest, I don't have that experience. Maybe it's because I've been doing this since I was eight years old.\n\n\"Honestly, I had more fun than I've ever had on any movie, making this. I've never laughed so much as I have working on this movie. Todd is the funniest guy.\"\n\nPhoenix lost 24kg for the role, choosing not to go on diet until the last minute and then restricting himself to an apple a day. Just one - and sometimes a salad without dressing. That could make anyone go a bit crazy.\n\nPhillips points out that Phoenix had some padding before his drastic weight loss. \"He was fat when we started - bulky. He needed to lose [7kg]. We wanted Arthur to look sickly; wolf-like, hungry. I kept saying, 'Start now', and he'd say 'That's not how I do it. I'll start, I'll start.' From June 1 to September 1 he lost all that weight. He went from [82kg to 58kg]. It was ridiculous.\"\n\nWhen the topic is raised with Phoenix he claims he doesn't remember his first meal after the gruelling diet. \"It probably was food in an airport, sadly,\" he says. He gives a lopsided grin. \"I think that I just ...\" His voice trails off. \"You get to a state where you eat a stalk of celery and can taste seven different flavours.\"\n\n• 'Joker' opened in cinemas in SA on October 4."
