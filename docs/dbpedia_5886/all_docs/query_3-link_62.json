        "text": "Phoenix and Mara, who met on the set of \"Her\" in 2013 and got engaged last year, have not confirmed the news. In fact, they have yet to even confirm the pregnancy, despite reports of the pregnancy being released in May.\n\nThis would be Phoenix and Mara's first child. The couple also starred together in 2018's \"Mary Magdelene.\"\n\nKossakovsky told the audience at the Zurich Film Festival that Phoenix and Mara had named the baby after Phoenix's late brother River.\n\nRiver Phoenix died of a drug overdose in 1993 aged just 23. He had a promising career ahead of him after starring roles in \"Stand By Me,\" \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,\" and \"My Own Private Idaho.\" He also earned an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor in 1988 for \"Running on Empty.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nJoaquin Phoenix won an Oscar earlier this year for \"Joker\" and included a tribute to River at the end of his speech. Phoenix said: \"When he was 17, my brother wrote this lyric, he said: 'Run to the rescue with love and peace will follow.'\"\n\nIn January, Phoenix opened up to Anderson Cooper on \"60 Minutes\" about River's death, and said his brother was the one who told him to get into acting. \"He didn't ask me â€” he told me. And I am indebted to him for that because acting has given me such an incredible life.\"\n\nPhoenix also said: \"I feel like in virtually every movie that I made, there was a connection to River in some way. And I think that we've all felt his presence and guidance in our lives in numerous ways.\"\n\nRead more:\n\n12 actors who don't watch the movies they've been in\n\nThe 31 best independent movies you can watch on Netflix right now"
