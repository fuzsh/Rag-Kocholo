        "text": "[music] This is Gus Van Sant. I’m the director of “Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot.” This is our character John Callahan played by Joaquin Phoenix. In the story, he’s had a catastrophic accident, and now he’s given an electric wheelchair. So now, this is the cure-all to his motion problems. I think in the screenplay there was suggestion that there would be, like, a series of shots that were related to his first time working a wheelchair. On the set, the day we shot it, we had gotten into the habit of very loosely interpreting the script. I think it was more we had a long lens, we had the shots in our head, we had by then decided to use the zoom lens a lot in the film. So we were like zooming in, zooming into wheels, zooming into the joystick, zooming into his face, zooming out again. But a lot of what’s going on is Joaquin, himself, wanted to act as if he’d never used the wheelchair before. So he was doing a lot of the revalatory parts himself, and we were basically just capturing it. We had a number of different things that we could do with the wheelchair. We could put the camera on the wheelchair, and we had a kind of rickshaw as well. And we had a skateboard and we had a slider and we had a spinner that could spin the camera around. And it was in a wheel that could make it go in a circle on the axis of its lens, so that it was sort of spinning on that axis. The revelation of a thing that can actually take you out of your confinement in the way that it does with motorized wheels was a big moment. [music]"
