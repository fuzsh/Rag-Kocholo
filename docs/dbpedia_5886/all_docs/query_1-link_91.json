        "text": "Finally, we can compare Joaquin Phoenix's Joker with Jared Leto's and Heath Ledger's takes on the wildest of DC Comics villains.\n\nBut that picture is not exactlyâ€¦ wild.\n\nOn Sunday, Todd Phillips , director of the yet-to-be-titled Joker movie, posted a picture of Phoenix on Instagram, with the caption \"Arthur\". Arthur is presumably the name of the Joker before he became the Joker.\n\nMeet Arthur:\n\nIn the comics, there's no definitive backstory for Batman's greatest villain. This origin story is written by Phillips (who directed the Hangover trilogy) with Scott Silver, a co-writer on 2010's The Fighter.\n\nThe story will be a character study as well as a cautionary tale of \"a man disregarded by society who becomes the ultimate supervillain,\" according to Deadline.\n\nThe cast confirmed so far includes Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Frances Conroy and Marc Maron. There was speculation Alec Baldwin had signed on for a role, but that has since been debunked by the actor himself.\n\nFor more, here are some set photos from New York, shared on Twitter by pop culture site Just Jared:\n\nWarner Bros. is working on another Joker movie starring Jared Leto, who took on the role for 2016's Suicide Squad. That film doesn't have a release date yet.\n\nThe yet-to-be-titled Joker movie starring Joaquin Phoenix is set to crash into theatres Oct. 4, 2019.\n\nFirst published Sept. 16 at 8:05 p.m. PT."
