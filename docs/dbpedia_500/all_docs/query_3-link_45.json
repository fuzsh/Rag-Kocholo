        "meta_description": "Action highlights U.S. whole-of-government approach to address fentanyl crisisWASHINGTON — Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated 28 individuals and entities involved with the international proliferation of illicit drugs, including a China-based network responsible for the manufacturing and distribution of ton quantities of fentanyl, methamphetamine, and MDMA precursors. Those designated by OFAC today are also involved in the global trafficking of xylazine and “nitazenes,” which are highly potent and often mixed with illicit fentanyl or other drugs.“Treasury is taking sweeping action with our colleagues in law enforcement to expose and disrupt a network responsible for manufacturing and distributing illicit drugs, including fentanyl and other substances that take thousands of American lives each year,” said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo. “Today’s action from OFAC and IRS-CI reflects how we will swiftly use all of our tools to counter the global threat posed by the illicit drug trade.”Treasury’s sanctions complement indictments issued today by the U.S. Attorneys Offices for the Southern District of Florida and the Middle District of Florida. For information on actions taken by the U.S. Department of Justice, please see this link.These designations, which target 12 entities and 13 individuals based in China and two entities and one individual based in Canada pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 14059, would not have been possible without the cooperation, support, and ongoing collaboration between Treasury’s OFAC, Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigations, and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and the Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency. These partnerships highlight the Biden-Harris Administration’s strengthened whole-of-government offensive to save lives by disrupting illicit fentanyl supply chains around the globe.This action follows a rapid increase in Treasury financial sanctions targeting the illicit fentanyl supply chain, including a recent action against China- and Mexico-based enablers of counterfeit pill production. Furthermore, this action demonstrates the importance of coordination amongst authorities in investigating precursor supply chains and disrupting financial flows of illicit drugs proceeds, as identified in the Financial Action Task Force’s 2022 report on Money Laundering from Fentanyl and Synthetic Opioids.         Hanhong Pharmaceutical Technology Co., LTD posted this listing to an online chemical marketplace selling the veterinary sedative xylazine, also known by the street name “tranq.”The networks targeted today have been involved in the trafficking of xylazine and “nitazenes” into the United States.Xylazine, or “tranq,” is a powerful sedative for veterinary use that is increasingly misused by narcotics traffickers who mix it with illicit fentanyl to produce a deadly mixture. According to a DEA public safety alert, fentanyl and xylazine mixtures are more potent than either drug alone, placing users at a higher risk of suffering a fatal drug overdose. Xylazine has also been coined the “zombie drug” because it can cause severe wounds in users, including necrosis — the rotting of human tissue — which may lead to amputation.Nitazenes are also increasingly found mixed with illicit fentanyl or other drugs in the United States. Nitazenes are synthetic, non-fentanyl opioids. Metonitazene, butonitazene, isotonitazene, and protonitazene are examples of nitazenes gaining prevalence in the United States. Nitazenes vary in potency with some being considerably more potent than fentanyl, which is already approximately 100 times more potent than morphine and 50 times more potent than heroin. Known for their lethality, nitazenes are not approved for medical use in the United States.  DISRUPTION OF CHINA-BASED ILLICIT DRUGS SYNDICATEDu ChanggenThe actors designated today comprise, or are otherwise affiliated with, a Chinese illicit drugs syndicate (hereafter, the “Syndicate”).

A member of the Syndicate previously under Wang Shucheng, Du Changgen (杜长根) has risen to prominence and currently maintains the greatest influence over the organization in its current state. Under Du Changgen’s leadership, the Syndicate is responsible for the manufacturing and distribution of ton quantities of nitazenes, fentanyl, methamphetamine, and MDMA precursors and various other illicit chemicals utilized to synthesize finished fentanyl, methamphetamine, and MDMA. The network is capable of synthesizing multi-thousand-kilogram quantities of the aforementioned substances, and Du Changgen and persons operating under him have been responsible for approximately 900 kilograms of seized fentanyl and methamphetamine precursors shipped to the United States and Mexico.As the leader of the Syndicate, Du Changgen oversees a large group of sales teams based in China who communicate with their co-conspirators via encrypted messaging. These groups of individuals send and receive funds through virtual currency, bank-wire transfers, and other financial transactions. Du Changgen himself has personally received virtual currency in exchange for shipments of fentanyl precursors. The Syndicate is the source of supply for dozens of narcotics traffickers in the United States, dark web vendors, virtual currency money launderers, and Mexico-based criminal organizations such as the Sinaloa Cartel and the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG).

In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC’s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons. U.S. persons may face civil or criminal penalties for violations of E.O. 14059.Today’s action is part of a whole-of-government effort to counter the global threat posed by the trafficking of illicit drugs into the United States that is causing the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans annually, as well as countless more non-fatal overdoses. This action demonstrates the Administration’s strengthened approach to saving lives by disrupting the trafficking of illicit fentanyl and its precursors into American communities. These efforts are part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s comprehensive, whole-of-government strategy to tackle the nation’s overdose epidemic, which goes after two key drivers of this crisis: untreated addiction and the drug trafficking profits that fuel it. Today’s action will help strengthen public safety by disrupting the illicit drug production and trafficking pipeline that profits by harming Americans. As a key part of the President’s Unity Agenda, the Administration has also made historic investments in critical public health interventions including research, prevention, treatment, and recovery support services.OFAC, in coordination with its U.S. Government partners and foreign counterparts, will continue to target and pursue accountability for foreign illicit drug actors. In addition, persons that engage in certain transactions with the individuals and entities designated today may themselves be exposed to sanctions or subject to an enforcement action. The power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC’s ability to designate and add persons to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List), but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. For information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to OFAC’s Frequently Asked Question 897. For detailed information on the process to submit a request for removal from an OFAC sanctions list, please click here.View more information, including virtual currency wallet addresses, on the individuals and entities designated today.###",

In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC’s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons. U.S. persons may face civil or criminal penalties for violations of E.O. 14059.\n\nToday’s action is part of a whole-of-government effort to counter the global threat posed by the trafficking of illicit drugs into the United States that is causing the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans annually, as well as countless more non-fatal overdoses. This action demonstrates the Administration’s strengthened approach to saving lives by disrupting the trafficking of illicit fentanyl and its precursors into American communities. These efforts are part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s comprehensive, whole-of-government strategy to tackle the nation’s overdose epidemic, which goes after two key drivers of this crisis: untreated addiction and the drug trafficking profits that fuel it. Today’s action will help strengthen public safety by disrupting the illicit drug production and trafficking pipeline that profits by harming Americans. As a key part of the President’s Unity Agenda, the Administration has also made historic investments in critical public health interventions including research, prevention, treatment, and recovery support services.\n\nOFAC, in coordination with its U.S. Government partners and foreign counterparts, will continue to target and pursue accountability for foreign illicit drug actors. In addition, persons that engage in certain transactions with the individuals and entities designated today may themselves be exposed to sanctions or subject to an enforcement action.\n\nThe power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC’s ability to designate and add persons to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List), but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. For information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to OFAC’s Frequently Asked Question 897. For detailed information on the process to submit a request for removal from an OFAC sanctions list, please click here.\n\nView more information, including virtual currency wallet addresses, on the individuals and entities designated today."
