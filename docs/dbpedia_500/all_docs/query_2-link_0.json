It has a total area of 12,486 km2 (4,821 sq mi) and administers 4 districts, 2 county-level cities and 12 counties. At the 2020 census, its population was 7,111,106 inhabitants. It borders Shijiazhuang and Hengshui in the north, Handan in the south, and the provinces of Shandong and Shanxi in the east and west respectively.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nXingtai is the oldest city in North China.[citation needed] The history of Xingtai can be traced back 3500 years ago. During the Shang dynasty, Xingtai functioned as a capital city. During the Zhou dynasty, the State of Xing – from which the present name derives – was founded in the city. During the Warring States period, the state of Zhao made Xingtai its provisional capital. The city was known as Xindu for most of the Qin dynasty, but after the 207 BC Battle of Julu (within present-day Pingxiang County, not today's Julu County), it became known as Xiangguo. During the Sixteen Kingdoms Period, when the Later Zhao was founded by Shi Le of the Jie, the capital was again at Xiangguo. During the Sui and Tang dynasties, the city was known as Xingzhou.\n\nSui, Tang and Song times saw the zenith of ceramics production in what was the most prolific ceramics center of northern China (rivaling the Yue ware from the South). The white ware and new technologies developed in the Xing kiln mark the transition from proto-porcelain to proper porcelain.[3] More than thirty kiln site have been excavated in different subdivisions of today's Xingtai City and a large high-tech museum have been established in Neiqiu County in 2017.[4][5][6]\n\nDuring the Yuan dynasty, Ming, and Qing dynasties, Xingtai was called Shunde (Shundefu) and functioned as a prefecture in China.\n\nGeography and climate\n\n[edit]\n\nXingtai has a continental, monsoon-influenced semi-arid climate (Köppen BSk).[7] It has hot, humid summers due to the East Asian monsoon, and generally cold, windy, very dry winters that reflect the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone; fall is similar to spring both in temperature and lack of rainfall. In the spring, there are large sandstorms blowing in from the Mongolian steppe, accompanied by rapidly warming, but generally dry, conditions. The annual rainfall, more than half of which falls in July and August alone, is highly variable and not reliable. In the city itself, this amount has averaged to a mere 496.5 mm (19.5 in) per annum.\n\nAir quality\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to a survey made by \"Global voices China\" in February 2013, 7 cities in Hebei including Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Handan, Langfang, Hengshui and Tangshan, were among China's 10 most polluted cities; Xingtai ranked 1st in the list and had the worst air quality.[11] In 2020, the improvement rates of Xingtai's comprehensive air quality index and PM2.5 average concentration ranked first in Hebei Province. The average annual concentration of PM2.5 has successfully withdrawn from the \"top ten\" in China.\n\nXingtai earthquake\n\n[edit]\n\nA major earthquake, known as the Xingtai earthquake, with magnitude 6.8 on the Richter scale and epicenter in Longyao County occurred in the early morning of March 8, 1966. It was followed by 5 earthquakes above magnitude 6 on the Richter scale that lasted until March 29, 1966. The strongest of these quakes had a magnitude of 7.2 and took place in the southeastern part of Ningjin County on March 22. The earthquake damage included 8,064 dead, 38,000 injured and more than 5 million destroyed houses.[12]\n\nAdministrative divisions\n\n[edit]\n\nMap Name Chinese Pinyin Population (2020) Area (km2) Xiangdu District 襄都区 Xiāngdū Qū 362,857 116 Xindu District 信都区 Xìndū Qū 798,770 1941 Renze District 任泽区 Rènzé Qū 342,869 431 Nanhe District 南和区 Nánhé Qū 350,384 405 Lincheng County 临城县 Línchéng Xiàn 199,793 797 Neiqiu County 内丘县 Nèiqiū Xiàn 260,000 788 Baixiang County 柏乡县 Bǎixiāng Xiàn 168,761 268 Longyao County 隆尧县 Lóngyáo Xiàn 480,447 749 Ningjin County 宁晋县 Níngjìn Xiàn 745,389 1,032 Julu County 巨鹿县 Jùlù Xiàn 346,007 631 Xinhe County 新河县 Xīnhé Xiàn 134,095 366 Guangzong County 广宗县 Guǎngzōng Xiàn 280,603 504 Pingxiang County 平乡县 Píngxiāng Xiàn 323,675 406 Wei County 威县 Wēi Xiàn 496,230 994 Qinghe County 清河县 Qīnghé Xiàn 421,582 500 Linxi County 临西县 Línxī Xiàn 326,968 542 Nangong City 南宫市 Nángōng Shì 396,718 861 Shahe City 沙河市 Shāhé Shì 431,746 859 Xingtai Economic Development Area 邢台经济开发区 Xíng Tái Jīng Jì Kāi Fā Qū 182,585 - Xingdong New Area 邢东新区 Xíng Dōng Xīn Qū 63,367 -\n\nXingtai Economic Development Area and Xingdong New Area belong to Xiangdu District.\n\nXingtai County - defunct\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nXingtai is the most important base for natural resources in North China, producing 20 million metric tonnes of coal annually.
