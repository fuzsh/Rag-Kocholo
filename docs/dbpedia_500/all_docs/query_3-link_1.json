        "text": "Xingtai, city, southwestern Hebei sheng (province), China. It is situated in a fertile plain at the foot of the Taihang Mountains, on the upper course of the Ziya River. It became a settlement at an early date. There were several settlements of the Shang dynasty (c. 1600–1046 bce) in the area, and the name of Xing (the source of the city’s name) appears on oracle bones found there. Since 1954 some two dozen such Shang sites have been found in the district, indicating both lengthy occupation and a relatively advanced urban complex.\n\nIn the early years of the Zhou dynasty (1046–256 bce), the site was the capital of the feudal state of Xing. After Xing transferred its capital farther east and was subsequently destroyed (mid-7th century bce), Xingtai became a part of the state of Jin and later of Zhao, and it was incorporated into the Qin empire on the fall of Zhao in 228 bce. In the civil war following the defeat of the Qin dynasty (206 bce), Xiangyu, one of the chief contenders for the empire, made one of his supporters the king of Changshan, with his seat at Xingtai, which at the time was named Xiangguo. During the ensuing Han dynasty (206 bce–220 ce), the area was divided among the surrounding commanderies and feudal kingdoms. In 319 it became the capital of the Hou (Later) Zhao dynasty, founded by Shi Le (reigned 319–333), but under his successor, Shi Hu, the capital was moved from Xingtai to Ye in 335. After the Sui dynasty (581–618) conquered China, the area was given the name of Xingzhou, which it retained until 1119, when it became Xinde prefecture. Under the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1911/12) dynasties, it became Shunde prefecture. The actual prefectural town has been called Xingtai since Song times (960–1126)."
