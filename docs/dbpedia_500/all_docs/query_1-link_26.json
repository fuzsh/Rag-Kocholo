        "text": "HONG KONG â€” Heavy rains this past week in northern China caused extensive flooding, overwhelming levees and killing at least 72 people in one province, with many others missing, state media reported.\n\nThe death toll in Xingtai, an industrial city in Hebei Province, rose sharply on Saturday, days after a wall of water descended on one village in the middle of the night with little or no warning, according to the Beijing News. In addition to the 25 people in Xingtai who were confirmed dead, 13 were missing, China National Radio reported on its official social media site.\n\nJingxing County, part of the provincial capital, Shijiazhuang, received more rain on Tuesday and Wednesday than in all of 2015, and flooding causing 26 deaths with 34 others missing, the official Xinhua news agency reported.\n\nIn both cities, the local government took days to make public the devastation and report the casualties. In Xingtai, the death toll on Saturday rose to 25 from nine in the span of several hours after first being reported on Friday evening, more than two days after the bulk of the rain and flooding.\n\nThe reports were from only two locations in Hebei, a densely populated province on the North China Plain that abuts Beijing. On Saturday, the website of the local Ministry of Civil Affairs listed 72 deaths, 78 people missing and more than 298,000 people displaced across the province. Hebei has a population of more than 73 million.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
