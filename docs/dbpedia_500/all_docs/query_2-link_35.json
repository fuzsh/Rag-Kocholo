It is a Guo Shouji-ng research center in China, and a base bo-th for national science popularization education and patriotism education.\n\nGuo Shoujing (1231-1316), also named Guo Ruosi, born in Xingtai, was an outstanding astronomer, mathematician, and expert of both water conservancy and apparatus making in the Yuan Dynasty. He had contributed a lot to the world scientific development with his over ten world-class scientific and technological achievements.\n\nHence, there had been two comm-emorative stamps of Guo Shoujing published by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications in the 1960s. A crater on the moon and the No. 2012 asteroid in the outer space were named after him by the International Astronomy Association in the 1970s in honor of his contributions to science.\n\nWith an area of 5,000 square meters, the museum shows the Ming and Qing dynasties\"construction styles.

Built during the Kaiyuan period in the Tang Dynasty with a long history of over 1,200 years, it was one of the origins of the Caodong sect of Buddhism. In the Five Dynasties, Kong Ben, a monk from India, translated Buddhist sutras into Chinese here in the Later Liang Dynasty. Being a temple of the imperial family in the Yuan Dynasty, it had been visited by Kublai himself twice.\n\nFacing the south, this 300-are temple looks very magnificent. According to the historical record, in its height, there were thousands of monks and pilgrims attending the lectures held by the abbot.\n\nMost parts of the temple have been well preserved such as the Maitreya Hall, the Pilu Hall, the Guanyin Hall and the Great Buddha's Hall, which are of high historic and academic value.\n\nTo be specific, the four dragon and phoenix stone pillars in the Guanyin Hall are 4.5 meters in height and 2.5 meters in girth. Coiling around them, the dragons and phoenixes look very lively. The patterns and characters inscribed on the over-eight-hundred-year-old Jinding Bell are still legible showing how well-developed the metallurgical and casting techniques were at that time.\n\nAccording to a legend, before it was tolled the first time, an old monk said to the others, You can not toll the bell until I am 5 kilometers away\"and then left. However, being overwhelmingly eager to toll it, the other monks began tolling it when he was only 1.5 kilometers away.So, as the legend goes the sound of the bell can not be able to be heard any farther away."
