Born: 7 June 1940

Real name: Thomas Jones Woodward

Jones was born in the village of Treforest which is near Pontypridd in Wales. As a youngster he enjoyed singing and would entertain at family gathers and weddings. He would also sing in the school choir but would be practically bedridden for 2 years when he contracted tuberculosis when he was 12. He would then work with a band called Tommy Scott & The Senators who would gain a following in Wales and even recorded some singles but failed to score any chart hits. Then Jones was spotted one night by Gordon Mills, a manager. Mills got him a contract with Decca records but his first release, ‘Chills And Fever’, didn’t do much. However, his second release, ‘It’s Not Unusual’ was a hit, going to number 1 in the UK and 10 in the US. To date he has seen 48 UK hits with 3 of them going to number 1. His 3rd number 1 was ‘Barry Islands In The Stream’, a Comic Relief charity song where he shared credits with Rob Brydon, Ruth Jones and Robin Gibb. With this number 1, he became the oldest person to top the UK charts being 68 years and 9 months old at the time. The record was subsequently beaten in 2020 when 99 year old Captain Tom Moore got to number 1 with his duet with Michael Ball, ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’. In the US he has seen 29 hits but has never managed to hit the top spot, just missing out with ‘She’s A Lady’ which peaked at 2.
