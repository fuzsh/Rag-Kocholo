        "text": "Sir Tom Jones is raring to go. “I’ve had the two shots,” he says, referring to the Covid vaccine. “I’m bulletproof now!” Grey-haired and grey-bearded, the 80-year-old Welsh superstar is in good spirits, talking via Zoom from his London penthouse flat overlooking the Thames, where he lives alone. After months of lockdown, he is itching to get back on stage. “That’s the thing that I’ve missed most,” he says. “I’m biding my time – but I don’t have that much time to bide. I don’t want to be 90 before I can get back on the road again!”\n\nA couple of years ago, Jones was hospitalised with a bacterial infection and recalls a doctor suggesting it might be time to slow down. “That’s like a red rag to a bull,” he roars. “Just give me a bunch of antibiotics to throw down my throat and get me back out there. Some people think you do it to make money. But I love to sing. I’m getting a bloody great kick out of it. To stop would be ludicrous. As long as I’ve got it, I want to use it!”\n\nRecently, Jones has been filming the latest, socially distanced series of The Voice, the ITV talent show on which he has served as a coach since 2012. When he’s required to sing, he’ll warm up to his own records. “It’s not as boring as scales,” he says. “Elvis Presley told me he used to warm up to [Jones’s 1968 hit] Delilah. He said, ‘I know if I can get those high notes, I’m ready.’ And if it’s good enough for Elvis…”\n\nNext month, Jones will release Surrounded by Time, the 40th album of his career, and his fourth in a row with Ethan Johns, the producer who has steered him away from his signature bombast towards more stripped-back, rootsy songs of real substance, with lean, atmospheric arrangements. “Ethan said, ‘I hear things in your voice that I don’t think have been explored yet’,” says Jones. The songs feel well suited to a man of his years, ranging from a brooding interpretation of Bob Dylan’s One More Cup of Coffee to a gospel reworking of the Waterboys’ This Is the Sea and a moving performance of I’m Growing Old, a wistful ballad by the late jazz composer Bobby Cole.\n\n“Bobby came to me in Vegas in the 1970s, and said, ‘I’ve got this song, and I think you’ve got the voice for it,’” Jones recalls. “I said ‘It’s great, but I’m only in my 30s. I’m not old enough to sing it yet!’ But I kept hold of that demo and thought: ‘Now’s the time.’ I think more about things as I get older, and I like songs that reflect that.”\n\nWith so many songs that address age and loss, Surrounded by Time has a valedictory feel; you could imagine it as the final album of an extraordinary career. “If it is, I won’t mind,” Jones says. Then he thinks again: “Well, I would mind, because that means I probably wouldn’t be around to sing any more!”\n\nIn conversation, Jones frequently refers back to his childhood among a sprawling coal-mining family in Pontypridd, south Wales. Back then, he was still known as Tommy Woodward, the boy who would burst into song at any given opportunity. “I had to get up on the table when I sang,” he tells me. “I was a show-off as a kid, I loved it.”\n\nWhen his first manager, Gordon Mills, took him to London in 1964, the record industry did not know what to make of Jones. “Everything was the Beatles and the Stones, skinny boys with lank hair, and here I am, a coal miner’s son with a busted nose and curly hair, singing rhythm and blues. They said, ‘You’re too macho, that’s not going to work any more.’ I said, ‘That’s the way I am!’ Then we got It’s Not Unusual, ripped the s--- out of it, and it worked!”\n\nThat 1965 hit, with its big, brassy sound, gave Jones his breakthrough and encouraged him to embrace bigger orchestrations. He worked with Burt Bacharach on the follow-up, What’s New Pussycat?, the theme for a Peter Sellers movie scripted by Woody Allen. “When I first heard it, I said to Burt, ‘Is this a joke?’ He said, ‘Well, it’s a crazy song, for a crazy movie, but if you sing it like you mean it, it’ll work.’ I said, ‘OK.’” Unprompted, Jones belts out the song’s opening line with a richness and volume that threatens to crack my computer screen.\n\n“The voice is still there, thank God.” When Jones started out he was a tenor; now he’s a baritone. “It’s a natural progression,” he says. “I used to be able to hit a high C, now it’s B flat. Time takes its toll.”\n\nJones’s brash style soon established him as a star in America, where he lived for more than 40 years. He only moved back to Britain after his wife, Linda, died of lung cancer in 2016. They had been childhood sweethearts, and married in 1957, when they were both 16. Their son, Mark Woodward – who works as Jones’s manager, and co-produced the new album – was born later that year. After Linda’s death, says Jones, “I had to get out of the house we had together and try to start again. She told me to come back to Britain, where the family is.\n\n“She would have loved this,” he adds, indicating the panorama beyond his window. “We always had a view, even in Pontypridd; those terraced houses, you were always overlooking something.”\n\nIt is in memory of Linda that Jones chose to open the new album with a stoic version of I Won’t Crumble with You If You Fall, a gospel number by Bernice Johnson Reagon. “We were in the hospital room in LA, and Linda said, ‘You’ve got to keep going.’ She was the most calm person in the room. I’m flapping, my son was trying to hold it together, and she was like, ‘I’ve got to leave, there’s nothing I can do about it, but you’ve got to carry on.’ I said, ‘I’ll try.’ She said, ‘You better!’ That’s why I did I Won’t Crumble. It said everything.”\n\nThe couple were married for 59 years, despite Jones’s notoriety as a philanderer. “Linda was always number one,” he says now. “We fell in love when we were kids, and we were always together, but she knew I wanted to be a singer, she knew what I was like, and she never got in my way. She said, ‘I want to live in a lovely house, and I want a lot of lovely things, and if I want to come somewhere, you better be there, and if I call, you better be on the other end.’ It was like that. She kept my feet on the ground.\n\n“I got a bit large once: we had a snooker room up in our house, and some New York friends came over, and I’m there with the champagne and cigars, giving it all that. She says, ‘Excuse me, you don’t really think you’re Tom Jones, do you?’ I said, ‘Yeah, well, of course I am!’ She said, ‘No, it’s Tommy Woodward I married, so stop all that.’ These fellas were p---ing themselves, saying, ‘I’ve never heard anyone talk to you like that.’ I said, ‘Well, it’s Linda. I can’t go against it, because she’s telling the truth.’ ”\n\nFor two years in the late 1960s, Jones had an affair with Mary Wilson, the Supremes singer who died last month. Wilson once claimed that Jones had broken her heart. “Mary wasn’t just a flash in the pan,” he says. “We became friends, and she got to know Linda. Getting old sucks, because you lose a lot of friends. Wales, to me now, is like a memory. If I go back, buildings have been knocked down, pubs and clubs are gone, the people I grew up with are not there any more. But I’ve got great memories.”\n\nSome of the greatest come from the years between 1969 and 1971 when Jones hosted his own television variety show. The guest list was extraordinary: he performed duets with everyone from Janis Joplin, Ella Fitzgerald, Dusty Springfield and Stevie Wonder to Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard. On YouTube you can watch a quite incredible clip of him singing a soulful vocal on Long Time Gone with Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, fresh from Woodstock in 1969.\n\n“I knew Graham Nash from the Hollies days, and we were talking in the parking lot outside the TV studio,” recalls Jones. “He said, ‘The boys didn’t particularly want to do a variety show, but they don’t know what you can do. So we’ll do our thing, and you just jump straight in.’ I said, ‘Sure. You pick it, I’ll sing it!’ You see that clip, Graham is laughing his head off. Those things are fantastic, when you do things people don’t expect.”\n\nBut, Jones says, of everyone he has sung with, nobody could match Aretha Franklin. “She’s so quiet in the rehearsal room, and all of a sudden we do the song and f--- me! The volume and projection that woman had. I thought, ‘This is tremendous, I don’t have to hold back anything!’”\n\nMore than 50 years later, the memory still makes him smile. “Sometimes I think, wow, did I really do that?”\n\nSurrounded by Time (Virgin EMI) is out next month"
