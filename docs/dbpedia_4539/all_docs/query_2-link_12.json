        "text": "(born 1940). A charismatic singer and performer, Tom Jones came to fame in the 1960s with such hits as “It’s Not Unusual” and “What’s New, Pussycat?” He went on to find success in a variety of pop music styles during a career that spanned more than five decades.\n\nThomas John Woodward was born in Pontypridd, Wales, on June 7, 1940. He began performing professionally in 1963 as Tommy Scott with the band the Senators, a local Welsh group. The following year he was discovered by Gordon Mills, who became his manager and gave him the stage name Tom Jones.\n\nJones had his breakthrough in 1965 with “It’s Not Unusual,” which became a major hit in the United Kingdom and in the United States. The string of hits that followed included the theme songs “What’s New Pussycat?” for the Woody Allen movie of the same name and “Thunderball” for the James Bond movie of the same name. He was awarded the 1966 Grammy for best new artist. In the late 1960s he won new fans by adopting a more-sophisticated tone, and he scored hits with his songs “Green, Green Grass of Home” (1966) and “Delilah” (1968).\n\nJones moved to the United States in the late 1960s. From 1969 to 1971 he hosted a television variety show, This Is Tom Jones. Jones established a strong following in Las Vegas beginning in the 1970s, performing at large hotels such as Caesars Palace and the Flamingo. His hits during the 1970s included “Daughter of Darkness,” “She’s a Lady,” “The Young New Mexican Puppeteer,” and “Say You’ll Stay Until Tomorrow.” When his long-time manager, Mills, died in 1986, Jones’s son took over and reshaped his father’s public image.\n\nJones returned to the limelight with his 1987 performance of Prince’s song “Kiss,” which he then recorded with the techno-pop band the Art of Noise. That song introduced Jones to a new audience and opened reinvigorated his career. He won critical acclaim with his pop-dance album The Lead and How to Swing It (1994) and its follow-up, Reload (1999), a collection of duets with contemporary musicians such as the Cranberries and Barenaked Ladies. In 2002 he and musician Wyclef Jean worked together on Jones’s album Mr. Jones. In 2006 Jones was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II."
