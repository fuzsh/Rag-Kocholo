        "text": "Tom Jones (Sir Thomas John Woodward), was born in Treforest, 7 June, 1940. His career has spanned for nearly 50 years, during which he has sold over 100 million records, and reached legendary status as a performer throughout the world.\n\n(Scroll down for latest Tom Jones news)\n\nThe singer rose from humble beginnings in Treforest, and his first band gained a reputation in South Wales after recording with pioneering producer, Joe Meek. Jones adopted his stage name whilst being managed by Gordon Mills, and in 1965, his first single, ‘It’s Not Unusual’ charted at number one in the UK.\n\nOn top of Tom Jones’ hugely successful recording career, he is a successful concert performer, and commands huge audiences in Las Vegas every year. During the late 60s and early 70s, Tom Jones hosted his own international television show, the programme was a variety show aired in America and the UK.\n\nJones has released music across a broad range of genres, but after a brief flirtation with country music in the 80s, he has more recently focused his attention on blues. In 2003 he released a rock and roll album with pianist, Jools Holland, entitled Tom Jones and Jools Holland . In February 2012, Jack White’s record label, Third Man Records, announced that they would be releasing a double A-side single featuring duets between White and Jones. The record was only available for physical purchase in one store, Spillers Records (Cardiff) – the world’s oldest record store – where Tom Jones bought records as a youth.\n\nJones has been married to his wife Melinda since 1957, when the singer was just 16-years-old. The couple remains together despite a number of Jones’ high-profile affairs throughout the years.\n\nTom Jones is a judge on BBC One’s new vocal talent show The Voice, in which judges are facing away from the singers, and judge the act purely on vocal talent alone."
