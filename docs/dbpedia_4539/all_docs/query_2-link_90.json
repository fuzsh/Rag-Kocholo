Also known as Sir Tom Jones, he was born Thomas John Woodward on June 7th, 1940 in Pontypridd, Glamorgan, South Wales. The image takes us back to a significant moment in Tom's career when he had just released his first solo single, \"Chills and Fever\" in August 1964. In this studio portrait taken on September 24th, 1964, we see a young Tom Jones confidently seated on a stool. Dressed immaculately in a crisp white shirt and trousers that perfectly complement his charismatic persona. His poised posture exudes an air of undeniable talent and star power. Little did anyone know at the time that this Welsh sensation would soon become a household name with his major hit \"It's Not Unusual\" in 1965. This breakthrough success paved the way for numerous chart-topping hits throughout the swinging sixties such as \"What's New Pussycat\" \"The Green Green Grass of Home\" and \"Delilah\". Carl Bruin skillfully captured this iconic moment from Tom Jones' early career through his lens. This print is not only a nostalgic trip down memory lane but also serves as a testament to the enduring legacy of one of Britain's most beloved entertainers.\n\nRate this comment thumb_up thumb_down"
