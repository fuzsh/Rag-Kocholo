        "text": "TOM Jones is back fighting fit after tackling a bout of illness in the summer.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the legendary crooner's health and whether he'll be resuming his coaching duties on The Voice this year...\n\nWill Tom Jones return to The Voice?\n\nSir Tom Jones, 78, will be returning to his famous red chair on The Voice this year.\n\nHe will be joining Will.I.Am, Jennifer Hudson and Olly Murs on the judging panel next month.\n\nTom will no doubt hope to replicate his success from last year after coaching winner Ruti Olajugbagbe to victory.\n\nAnd the crooner has his hands full as he'll also be setting off on a European tour next year.\n\nWhat's the latest update on his health?\n\nTom is back fighting fit after falling ill in the summer.\n\nAnd so robust is he feeling that he's even planning on juggling his judging duties on The Voice alongside a tour of Europe next June.\n\nThe 78-year-old was forced to cancel five shows in July due to a bacterial infection.\n\nIn a statement posted on Twitter at the time, Sir Tom said: \"I am so sorry for cancelling last night's show in Chichester, it's the worse feeling having to let down everyone who was coming as well as everyone who is involved in the event.\n\n\"I know many of you travel considerable distances and make plans with friends and family that take a lot of effort, and it is so disappointing when things don't go right.\"\n\nA previous statement shared on his social media page revealed that the singer \"has a bacterial infection for which he is being treated in hospital\".\n\n\"The condition is being well managed and we are hoping for a speedy recovery.\n\n\"He is extremely sorry and disappointed not to be able to perform tonight, and sincerely apologises for inconveniences caused to the audience and all those who are involved in the event.\"\n\nFans of the star were understandably gutted, with many commenting how they had been looking forward to the show for ages.\n\nLast September Tom cancelled his US tour with just five days to go due to a mystery illness.\n\nHow old is Tom Jones?\n\nTom was born in Treforest, Pontypridd, Glamorgan, Wales, on 7 June 1940 - which makes him 78.\n\nHis showbiz career spans six decades, from his emergence as a vocalist in the mid-1960s with a string of top hits and regular appearances in Las Vegas.\n\nHe became a coach on The Voice back in 2012, while it was still on the BBC. He was joined by will.i.am, Jessie J and Danny O'Donoghue. He mentored Leanne Mitchell to win the first series.\n\nHe returned to coach in 2013, 2014 and 2015.\n\nIn August 2015 it was announced that Jones' contract with the show would not be renewed and that he would be replaced by Boy George.\n\nThe pop superstar criticised BBC bosses for \"sub-standard behaviour\", having not consulted with him and informing him only 24 hours before the official announcement.\n\nHowever, he returned to the show last year when it began airing on ITV.\n\nTom Received a Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1966, an MTV Video Music Award in 1989, and two Brit Awards: Best British Male in 2000 and the Outstanding Contribution to Music award in 2003. He was awarded an OBE in 1999 and in 2006 he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for services to music."
