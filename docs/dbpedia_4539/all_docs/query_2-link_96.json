The Museum of Wisconsin Art recently presented a retrospective of his two-decade career, Here We Stand (2022). Jones’s works are in the collections of the National Museum of the American Indian, the Polaroid Corporation, the Chazen Museum of Art, the MacArthur Foundation, the Minneapolis Institute of Art, and the Museum of Contemporary Native Arts, among others.\n\nJones is co-author of the award-winning book, People of the Big Voice, Photographs of Ho-Chunk Families by Charles Van Schaick, 1879–1943, and a professor of Photography at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nBased in Prairie du Sac, Wisconsin, Jones was born in North Carolina and has lived in Florida, Minnesota, and Illinois."
