        "text": "Singer reveals brush with death during holiday swim.\n\nLegendary crooner Sir Tom Jones has revealed how the Lord came to his rescue when he got caught out by an ocean undertow in the 1960s.\n\nWhile on holiday in Acapulco, Mexico, Jones, now 80, decided to take a dip in the Pacific, but ended up in a hair-raising predicament.\n\nHe said: “I wandered off like a fool, and I look at the calm water and think it looks lovely out there. I go through the breakers and start swimming out, then somebody comes looking for me, standing on the beach and I look at them and the man was big! I thought, ‘This is it now.’”\n\nSpeaking to Alan Carr on his Life’s A Beach podcast, Tom explained how on that particular day he was wearing his cross necklace, which he usually takes off while swimming.\n\nHe said: “I always used to take my jewellery off and put it in my man bag, but for some reason I didn’t. I put my hand on my chest and still had this big cross and chain on.\n\n“I put my hand on it and said, ‘God, I’m desperate here. What do I do?’ I was going to give up. I thought I’d take a load of water in and say good night.\n\n“A voice came to me and said, ‘If you think you can swim, now is the time to prove it.'\""
