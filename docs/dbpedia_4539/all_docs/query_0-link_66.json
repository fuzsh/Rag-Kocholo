        "text": "The Old Bridge\n\nThe 140ft single-span bridge remains the town’s most famous landmark. In fact, Ponty’s name comes from ‘Pont-y-ty-pridd’, or ‘bridge of the earthen house’ in Welsh.\n\nPontypridd nightlife, according to students\n\nThere are a whole bunch of pubs and clubs in both Treforest and Pontypridd, giving plenty of options. It is also only 25 minutes by train to Cardiff, which has one of the most vibrant music and nightlife scenes in the UK. In Pontypridd, everything is fairly cheap as well due to its location in the Valleys. (Third year student, University of South Wales)\n\nTom Jones\n\nPop music legend and The Voice judge Tom Jones has melted millions of hearts around the world – he was born and bred down the road, in the village of Treforest.\n\nPontypridd nightlife, according to students\n\nCardiff is the more popular place to go. [It’s] 20 minutes by train, and a taxi ride back. It’s easy, and it isn’t too expensive – usually about £30 to get a taxi. Ponty has Club Ice, a Spoons that has a dancefloor on the weekends, and Skinny Dog. Ponty is a bit more relaxed than Cardiff. There are also some nice pubs closer to campus in Ponty – Randy Dragon is a great option. (Second year student, University of South Wales)\n\nPontypridd Victorian Lido\n\nLido Ponty, a Grade II listed lido, has been restored to its former glory and updated for the 21st Century visitor.\n\nStudent life in Ponytpridd\n\nLocal gems, tips, and things to do, as recommended by students.\n\nLow on cash\n\nJust go out for a hike! Walk up a hill, you’ll see some horses, sheep, pigs, etc. and you’ll see some amazing views! Watch the sunset on a nice day. (Third year student, University of South Wales)\n\nTreat yourself\n\nCatch a train down to Cardiff. Visit the St David's Centre for some shopping, or head over to Live Lounge for some drinks and music. (University of South Wales student)\n\nFriday night out\n\nFor drinking, the Tumble Inn Wetherspoons in Ponty is the place to go. [There aren't] any sort of live music [or] comedy places, but there [are] a lot in Cardiff, like Glee Club. (Third year student, University of South Wales)\n\nSunday chilling\n\nIf you have the money, I'd recommend catching a bus up to Brecon for a walk in the Beacons, as it is beautiful up there. If you're the arty type, [take] a sketchpad or a quality camera to capture the views. (University of South Wales student)\n\nWhen family visit\n\nCardiff is the best place for family activities. Being the capital of Wales, it's filled with variety. (University of South Wales student)\n\nFeeling cultural\n\nThere is a museum about the history of Pontypridd, however, it is better to go into Cardiff. (Third year student, University of South Wales)\n\nCatch up with mates\n\nHoffi Coffee is the go-to coffee shop – they do good paninis. (Third year student, University of South Wales)\n\nGrab a bite\n\nMy favourite restaurant has to be Barinis, I love the mixed grill, gammon, or the steak – they’re usually my go-to options. Lovely, affordable, and very quick to serve you. (Second year student, University of South Wales)\n\nGroggs\n\nThese small, clay rugby figures have been handmade here since the 1970s. Pop into the little red Broadway shop, and pick up a souvenir of your Ponty tenure.\n\nLiving in Pontypridd, according to students\n\nThe whole of Treforest is really close to campus, as well as train and bus routes. The only downside is that to get to a major supermarket, you either have to go up quite a steep hill for 25 minutes, or go all the way to the outskirts of Ponty. (Third year student, University of South Wales)\n\nCoed-Pen-Maen Common\n\nMy mate and I went to see the sunset, and have a picnic. Unfortunately it was quite cloudy, but it is very pretty up there, with walking paths and places to explore. You can see the entire valley from up there. (Cailin, second year student at University of South Wales)\n\nLiving in Pontypridd, according to students\n\nOur Treforest campus is based in the beautiful Welsh Valleys, where you'll be surrounded by picturesque views and only 20 minutes from Cardiff. (Lucy Fishley, Psychology, University of South Wales).\n\nLiving in Pontypridd\n\nHousing, travel, and budgeting tips.\n\nWhere you'll find students\n\nTreforest\n\nLocal transport\n\nMytravelpass discounted scheme funded by Welsh Government\n\n6–21 year-old residents in Wales can save 1/3 on bus fares"
