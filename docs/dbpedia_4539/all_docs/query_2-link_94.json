        "text": "Sir Tom Jones, the singer, who was born in Wales and now lives in Los Angeles, was recently driven through the Bronx, in the company of Mark and Donna Woodward, his son and his daughter-in-law, who are also his managers. The three of them had a half-plan to eat an Italian lunch on Arthur Avenue. Jones (born Woodward) was trying to remember the details of a restaurant, perhaps in that neighborhood, perhaps worth revisiting, to which he had once been taken by Rod Stewart.\n\n“A little slope, the road goes down,” Jones said. “I’ll know it when I see it.”\n\n“Exactly,” Woodward said, skeptically.\n\nJones is seventy-five; his son is sixteen years younger. They have been on the road together for more than forty years. As they looked for lunch, Woodward was gently mocking; Jones had the air of a man trying, with some success, to hold on to his dignity in the face of mild disrespect. He sat very still.\n\nIn “Over the Top and Back,” a new autobiography, Jones makes a pivot of the moment, in the mid-nineteen-eighties, when his son became his manager. Woodward was still in his twenties, but he had already been on the road with his father for more than a decade; he went on to guide Jones away from dinner-theatre hip-waggling, and the accompanying ritual of undergarments thrown onstage. Jones’s subsequent career—looser-fitting trousers; a hit version of Prince’s “Kiss”; the Bowery Ballroom—could be thought of as a son’s efforts to minimize the embarrassment of having Tom Jones as a father. Earlier that day, Woodward had referred to Lang Lang, the pianist, and mimed hands bouncing up into the air, while remarking on the effort required to resist the forces that pull a performer toward kitsch and self-parody. “You have to fight it every day,” Woodward said. “I do.”\n\nThey had spent part of the morning at WFUV, on the Fordham campus, where Jones had sung from a new album of rootsy American music. Now Woodward told his father that a studio employee there had pressed him into a discussion of the sound quality on Jones’s first album, released in 1965, which included “It’s Not Unusual,” his first hit. That conversation had turned a little “anoraky,” Woodward said, using a British slur against trivia obsessives, but Woodward agreed with the man that “the openness of that record is amazing.”\n\nHis father said nothing. Woodward, sitting directly behind, said, “On ‘Along Came Jones,’ the first one?”\n\n“Yep,” said Jones.\n\n“You with me on this?” Woodward asked.\n\n“Yes, yes,” Jones said. “My first album!”\n\n“O.K., I thought I’d lost you already,” Woodward said, laughing.\n\nThere was a pause. “Otis Redding told me that every track on there was a single—could have been a single,” Jones said.\n\n“That’s nice of him,” Woodward said. The car stopped in traffic. “You wearing that on ‘Charlie Rose’?”\n\nJones looked himself up and down: a blue jacket over a blue sweater, blue- jeans, blue suède shoes.\n\nHis son went on, “It’s the cameras—if you wear dark . . . ”\n\n“It’s not really dark,” Jones said slowly. “It’s blue.” The last word sounded very Welsh, and was stressed almost to the point of being sung.\n\nThe car stopped on Arthur Avenue. The Rod Stewart restaurant hadn’t revealed itself, and Woodward scoped out another. The family sat, ordered, then discussed the fact that, the night before, at a Barnes & Noble, Mark Woodward had sung with his father, in public, for the first time.\n\n“A bookstore doesn’t count, really,” Donna Woodward said.\n\n“He was there, and he knows the part,” Jones said, in the same spirit.\n\n“And I can sing? Maybe?” Woodward said.\n\n“Yes,” Jones said, fondly.\n\nJones—who was dropped this summer as a coach on the U.K. edition of “The Voice,” after four seasons, to make room for Boy George—said that he had recently telephoned Little Richard, in a Nashville hospital; Little Richard advised him to establish the Tom Jones Gospel Choir, with his son and his grandson, Alexander, a London accountant. Woodward asked his father if his teen-age taste for blues and gospel—a taste that Elvis Presley had found puzzling, geographically, when the men first met—was primarily connected to the fact that he had a voice suited to singing that music. No, Jones said; he could just as easily have been drawn to musical theatre. “Sisters, sisters,” he sang, as softly as he could manage.\n\nA tall man in late middle age, another diner, came to the table. “My mom and dad were big fans of yours,” he said to Jones. “I saw you play in Dubai. Unbelievable! The women—I’m not kidding—taking off their underwear and throwing them up onstage.”\n\n“Oh, dear,” Woodward said.\n\n“Like, a whole sex-bomb thing,” the man went on, looking at Woodward. “The way he moves. Unbelievable! You’ve got good genes.”\n\n“Thank you,” Woodward said.\n\nThe man went back to his table. “Marvellous,” Woodward said quietly. “Everything you want to hear before your avocado.” ♦"
