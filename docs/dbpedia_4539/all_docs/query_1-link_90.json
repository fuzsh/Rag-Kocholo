        "text": "Dancing with the Stars host Alfonso Ribeiro appeared as a guest Wednesday on The Jennifer Hudson Show, discussing The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air before Ribeiro joked that he believes singer Sir Tom Jones is Black.\n\nThe legendary Welsh singer has been a part of a long-standing rumor that he has some Black ancestry, as many have wondered about his lineage. In 2016, Larry King admitted to Jones on his show that he thought he was Black when they first met, and Jones acknowledged that many people do.\n\nThe singer, now 82, said in an interview in 2015, \"When I first came to America, people who had heard me sing on the radio would be surprised that I was white when they saw me. Because of my hair, a lot of Black people still tell me I'm just passing as white.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Ribeiro spoke with Jennifer Hudson on her show about the legendary singer, who guest appeared on the sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and sang the song \"It's Not Unusual\" with Ribeiro's character, Carlton Banks.\n\nRibeiro stated that he didn't really know Jones before the show.\n\n\"I grew up in the Bronx, I was born in Harlem...Tom wasn't very big in the neighborhood,\" Ribeiro joked. \"I feel like Tom got bigger in the neighborhood because I got to do that with him, playing Carlton. And so people then kind of learned who Tom Jones was...but Tom was such a wonderful guy, I mean, he came on set and had a blast, and he was really cool and wonderful to all of us and especially me. To be able to sing that song with him back then was very, very cool.\"\n\nAfter Hudson thanked Ribeiro for \"introducing us, our culture to that,\" Ribeiro added, \"I don't know if it's true, but I still think Tom Jones is Black.\"\n\nHe continued to joke, \"You don't see that hair? I know he's English, I know. Tom, come clean, dog, come clean.\"\n\nHudson said that when she was a judge on The Voice UK along with Jones, \"all my family who came to the show said the same thing.\"\n\n\"Look at that hair,\" Ribeiro joked again, \"That ain't no regular white dude hair, stop playing.\"\n\n\"We love you, Tom,\" Hudson laughed, the sentiment echoed by Ribeiro.\n\nMany online have long questioned Jones' lineage as well, with some videos joking that the \"What's New Pussycat\" singer should take a DNA test. One video on TikTok that jokes about Jones' race has amassed 1.4 million views at the time of publication.\n\nJones was born in Wales, in the U.K., in 1940. His father, a coal miner, was of English descent and his mother was of Welsh and English ancestry.\n\nNewsweek reached out to a representative for Jones for comment."
