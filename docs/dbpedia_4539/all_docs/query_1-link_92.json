        "text": "TOM JONES by Dean Jones (UK)\n\nWorld renowned Tom Jones Tribute Artist\n\nDean Jones comes from Mountain Ash which is in the same South Wales valley, and just a few miles up the road from where the real Sir Tom Jones came from and grew up, Pontypridd.\n\nHe has performed his Tom Jones Tribute shows throughout the UK and abroad in countries such as Cyprus, France, Germany, Denmark & Holland. He has appeared on Sky TV in the UK and Foxel TV in Australia. He recently completed a sell out 15-date theatre tour of Wales, as guest of comedian/singer & BBC Radio Wales presenter Owen Money.\n\nDean's Tom Jones tribute show has evolved from two amazing facts: Dean looks just like the famous Sir Tom Jones and sounds just like him too! And, coming from a Welsh heritage, has a great talent in music and singing."
