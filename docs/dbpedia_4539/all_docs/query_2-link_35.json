        "text": "Sir Thomas Jones Woodward (born June 7, 1940) is a Welsh singer. His career began with a string of top 10 hits in the 1960s and he has since toured regularly, with appearances in Las Vegas from 1967 to 2011. His voice has been described by AllMusic as a \"full-throated, robust baritone\". Jones's performing range has included pop, R&B, show tunes, country, dance, soul, and gospel. In 2008, the New York Times called him a \"musical shapeshifter [who could] slide from soulful rasp to pop croon, with a voice as husky as it was pretty\". He has sold over 100 million records, with 36 Top 40 hits in the UK and 19 in the US, including \"It's Not Unusual\", \"What's New Pussycat?\", the theme song for the James Bond film Thunderball (1965), \"Green, Green Grass of Home\", \"Delilah\", \"She's a Lady\", \"Sex Bomb\", and a cover of Prince's \"Kiss\".\n\nJones sang the titular theme song (arranged by The Flaming Lips) of the Duck Dodgers series and even voiced himself in the episode Talent Show A Go-Go, where Duck Dodgers steals his voice in order to win a talent show. Dodgers plays as a caricature of Jones, and in the talent show, he sings one of Jones' signature songs, It's Not Unusual."
