Initiate by \" ERA Jazzu \" meeting brothers Bartlomiej and Marcin Oles with one of most prominent saxophonist and modern jazz clarinetist - David Murray, it has has turned out to ten shot. Musicians have faced each other in Cracow, they have established program of common concert and they have played. But as! Listening to it unheard-of rags and we realize with some amazement thick work, that such notions as \" old jazz \" or \"nu jazz\" that meaning lose jazz with reference to really strong personality. Because here does not have tongue about fashion or unfashionable directions stagnant have fabricated strong interaction on stage of Cracow Japanese center of form between them so, that believe hard, that there was first meetings . It else, that Oles probably, times of polish rhythmical sections reconciling of fairest last really - next moves feel obliged not be surprised - previously. But it show that class Murray, it staggers usually.\n\n(Nuta.pl)\n\n*****\n\nAll musicians, though fame distinguish, perfectly knows as it belongs to play in modern jazz, so emerge very good album\". ( Jazz&Classics)\n\n*****\n\nFour compositions by Bartlomiej Oles one by Marcin Oles [beautiful, trans song \"Fair Play\"], famous song by David Murray \"Mbizo\" and on immortal \"Law Years\" by Ornette Coleman. Material bubbles energy is full of spontaneous all musicians plays unusually. In our hand hits document, where, together with alive respondent Cracow audience, we commune with mutual discovering these three musicians. We are witness of front solo parties, which neither by moment, isn't egoistic sound. About all of seven work incorporated on this disc is possible with reference say about fine musical interaction among artists , about estimate to partners play but first of all, about beautiful, sophisticated jazz. But it quite a lot already!\n\n(Jazz Forum)\n\n*****\n\nDavid Murray is of course one of the more important tenor saxophonists of his era - or make that any era. Judging by his extensive discography, he is ready to collaborate or engage in almost any musical project. Never one to rest on his many accomplishments, any recording with Murray is worth investigating. This release is no exception, although certainly it would not be the best place to begin one's Murray research. For this collaboration, Murray connects with two brothers, bassist Marcin and drummer Bartlomiej Brat Oles, during a special concert with \"Poland's finest rhythm section\". This live show was recorded in Cracow as part of a festival and, as the liners state, Murray was thoroughly on board with this partnership, despite the fact that there apparently wasn't much rehearsal time. As a result, many of the compositions present space for a blowing session of sorts, with modal vamps being the vehicle for the group's interaction. Fortunately, Murray and the brothers sound like they enjoy one another's company, with the brothers working as full partners whether out in front or in support mode. The trio plays seven compositions here, with four by drummer Bartlomiej, one from the bassist Marcin, one from Murray, and Ornette Coleman's \"Law Years\". The concert commences with \"Go Home\", Bartlomiej's modal piece focusing on buoyant groove set by Bartlomiej, with the tension rising as Murray draws upon the dark, spiritual vibes with trademark altissimo musings. It initially starts off tentatively. However, the musicians eventually land on their feet. Next up is \"Double Tone\", a feature for Murray's bass clarinet and bassist's Marcin hard swinging post Bop waves. \"Circles\" is meant as a feature for all three musicians, with Murray taking the band to the stratosphere, as the youngsters follow his lead. Both Murray's piece \"Mbizo\" and Ornette's \"Law Years\" capture the variable rhythms and sonic connection between the brothers that inspired Murray to participate. While this is certainly not essential Murray, it demonstrates his continuing vitality in interaction on an international level. The Oles brothers are worthy partners and do their part in an effort to make exciting and worthy music.\n\n(Jay Collins, Cadence)"
