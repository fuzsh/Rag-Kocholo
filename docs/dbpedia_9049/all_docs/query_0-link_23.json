        "text": "This site is devoted to the recorded output of David Murray and demonstrates both his extensive and varied music legacy.\n\nI first saw David Murray in concert when he appeared in my home town of Brisbane, Australia in 1991 with the World Saxophone Quartet. I have been a fan of his music since the mid 80s. When I first accessed the internet in October 1995 I was surprised not to find much material on David given that he is such a major figure in contemporary jazz so I set up this site to redress the imbalance.\n\nI would like my site to be as complete and accurate as possible in covering David's recorded musical legacy so any additions, corrections and suggestions are welcome. For the latest up to date news I recommend you check out the David Murray site on MySpace.\n\nI have been asked by some people to produce a critical discography but with the sheer volume of albums this is a bit daunting (anyway I don't own them all!). A new web site http://wallofsound.wordpress.com/david-murray/ is attempting to provide an analysis of David's complete recordings."
