        "text": "But for his namesake Deryck, the West Indian David Murray would surely have played many more than 19 Tests. He was a talented wicketkeeper and a capable batsman who made three Test fifties and a first-class double hundred, at Jamshedpur on the 1978-79 tour of India. He took over from Deryck Murray - they were not related - in 1980-81 and was briefly No. 1. But he had serious underlying drug problems and was almost sent home from Australia in 1975-76. In Australia six years later he played back-to-back Tests with a broken finger but reacted angrily to being dropped for the one-dayers that followed and did not play again. In 1983 he threw in his lot with the West Indies rebel tour of South Africa and received a life ban. He lived in Australia until 1991 when he returned to his native Bridgetown. He fell on hard times and became a drug addict.\n\nMartin Williamson"
