        "text": "About Dr. Murray\n\nPianist David Murray, an “effortlessly musical” performer (Arizona Republic), received a bachelor of music degree from Southwest Baptist University in 1993 and a master of music degree from the University of Kentucky in 1995. In 2002, he received a doctor of musical arts from Arizona State University, where he studied with Robert Hamilton before continuing his training with Stewart Gordon in Los Angeles.\n\nIn June 2003, Murray released his first collaborative recording, Blue: The Complete Cabaret Songs of William Bolcom and Arnold Weinstein, about which Opera News commented that “Mr. Murray aces Bolcom’s fiendishly difficult piano parts,” while BBC Music Magazine described the recording as “exemplary.” In 2005, he made his Carnegie Hall debut, a performance described as “first-rate” and “perfect” by the New York Concert Review. A second recording, Murray’s own arrangement for soprano and piano of Elvis Costello’s song cycle, The Juliet Letters, was released in 2006. His first recording for solo piano, C. P. E. Bach’s Württemberg Sonatas, Vol. 1, was released in May 2013.\n\nMurray previously served asa faculty member at the University of Kentucky, Arizona State University, Mesa Community College, and California Baptist University."
