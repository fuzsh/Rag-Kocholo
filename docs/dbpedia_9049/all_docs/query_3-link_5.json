        "text": "When it comes to baby name, picking a middle name is far easier than choosing a first name. You don't have to envision your child introducing themselves by this name day-in, day-out for every stage of their life. If they feel later on that the name doesn't fit them, they don't have to use it, or they can go by a middle initial. Or hey â€” if you're really stumped, you don't have to have a middle name at all.\n\nSince the pressure's off, there's a lot more room to be creative there. If you're looking for the perfect middle names for boys or middle names for girls, the world is your inspiration. These are the top middle names for boys for 2023. You can look to the trendy and unique celebrity baby names. You can try on the classic royal baby names that never seem to go out of style. You can be influenced by your favorite movies, TV shows, books and characters. If you were hesitant about using a first name to honor a relative or some other aspect of your culture, you can still bestow those honors in the middle name. And, by looking at the trends governing the most popular boy names of the year, you can see what's up-and-coming and what's unique."
