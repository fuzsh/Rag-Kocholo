        "text": "Both horse and rider were nervous.\n\nSo on a cool morning along a woodsy trail in Stillwater, charismatic theater phenom David Murray drew on what he knew. Singing a lilting number from \"Les Misérables,\" his buttery tenor soothed the mount, a majestic black stallion named El Dante.\n\nMurray, 29, is accustomed to winning over bigger audiences. He wowed capacity crowds at the Ritz Theater this fall with his heart-rending portrayal of Coalhouse Walker Jr., who dies in a hail of police gunfire in Theatre Latté Da's riveting \"Ragtime.\" He made a splash at small Yellow Tree Theatre in Osseo this spring as an empathetic black sergeant in \"Violet,\" the musical that brought him to the Twin Cities from New York.\n\nNow he is about to sing, waltz and hold court for 60,000 theatergoers expected to see him as the Prince in Children's Theatre Company's holiday revival of \"Cinderella,\" which opens Friday.\n\nThe show's director already finds Murray charming.\n\n\"We first fell in love with his beautiful voice, of course, but David has great emotional access, a wonderful comic ability, and is a joy to work with,\" said director Peter Brosius.\n\nAdapted by the late John B. Davidson from Charles Perrault's 17th-century retelling of the rags-to-royalty folk tale, CTC's pantomime take on \"Cinderella\" has been a signature production for the company since 1966. It has mounted the show 16 times — more than any other — and enthralled generations of youngsters, many dressed up in princess outfits.\n\nThe star is Traci Allen Shannon, who played Cinderella three years ago to wide acclaim. Both Cinderella and the Prince are African-American in a production marked by contrasts.\n\nAfter graduation, he threw himself in the cutthroat world of New York theater. His biggest role was in an off-Broadway production of the election-season comedy \"Vote for Me,\" playing the First Husband to a Hillary Clinton-esque character.\n\nBut Murray missed the Midwest and started checking audition notices for the Twin Cities. He tried out for Yellow Tree via Skype.\n\n\"When they met me in person, they were glad I wasn't crazy or a serial killer,\" he said, laughing.\n\n'You want to be in his corner'\n\nHis performance in \"Violet\" got him noticed by \"Ragtime\" director Peter Rothstein, who knows just about all the musical theater talent in town.\n\n\"David checks all the craft boxes for vocal power, range and technique to do a demanding role night after night,\" said Rothstein. \"He handles spoken text beautifully and has that easy charisma that can't be taught. But what sets him apart is that he exudes such dignity and honesty — you want to be in his corner.\"\n\nIn \"Ragtime,\" Murray acted opposite his \"Cinderella\" co-star. He is happy to be paired again with Shannon, a luminous singer in her own right."
