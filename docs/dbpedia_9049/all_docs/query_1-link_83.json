Are there ways in which the Bible gives us insights into treating mental illness, that go beyond what modern secular scholarship can provide?\n\nIn this episode of the Theology for the People Podcast, I speak with David Murray. David Murray holds a PhD from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and has pastored churches in Scotland and the USA. He is also a counselor, and the author of several books, including the latest, which he co-authored, A Christian’s Guide to Mental Illness: Answers to 30 Common Questions.\n\nIn our discussion, David talks about his own struggles with mental illness, and about how the Bible gives us the best possible framework for dealing with issues that are often both spiritual and physical in nature."
