        "text": "Allegany County is home to fourteen public elementary schools, four public middle schools, three public high schools, one technical school, and one alternative placement program. All twenty-two schools are staffed by highly qualified teachers. Every day, these schools and staff do amazing things for our students.\n\nEach year we would like to take the opportunity to highlight some of these accomplishments, programs, and more. Several schools will be \"featured\" on a weekly basis, and then their highlights will move into a folder under the Accolades section of our website for the public to view all year long.\n\nWe encourage you to take a moment to enjoy our weekly ACPS highlights and visit the archives to view an individual school spotlight to see what great things are happening in Allegany County Public Schools!"
