        "text": "Tag Archives: David Murray\n\nMing\n\nHappy birthday to saxophonist David Murray! This is one of my favorite tunes of his; it’s got a lovely melody, and David (as always) plays it with earnestness and what you might call a “muscular delicacy.”\n\nMing\n\nMurray’s Steps\n\nSaxophonist David Murray goes a step beyond the well-worn “Coltrane changes” in this deceptively difficult song. The constant barrage of unrelated major seventh chords makes it hard to solo using bebop cliches that rely on clear V-I resolutions, and the lack of a tonal focal point means it’s easy to lose your place in the form. This is compounded by the fact that Murray adds an extra bar to the A section to displace the harmonic rhythm and keep things off balance.\n\nMurray’s Steps\n\nMorning Song\n\nI haven’t played a live gig in almost a month, which is by far the longest drought I’ve had in my career as a professional musician. It’s been hard to go this long without being able to do the job I love, but one of the silver linings of this furlough is that I’ve been going to bed earlier and waking up earlier. When I’m gigging regularly I usually don’t get home until midnight or later, and then it’s another hour or two before I’m ready for bed, so waking up early and going for a walk in the morning sun is a rare luxury for me.\n\nMorning Song"
