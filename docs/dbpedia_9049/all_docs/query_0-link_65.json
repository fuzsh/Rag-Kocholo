        "text": "Description\n\n180g audiophile vinyl reissue of saxophonist David Murray 's 1988 LP ' Lucky Four' with re-mastering by Cicely Baston at Alchemy/Air Mastering.\n\n\"Lucky Four is a smooth and luscious quartet date with Murray in the company of longtime associate Dave Burrell, bassist Wilber Morris, and drummer Victor Lewis. With the exception of a short piece by his manager Kunle Mwanga, all of the pieces are by either Burrell or Morris, and most of them are gems.\" - Brian Olewnick\n\n\"This 1988 set represents Murray at his most accessible. From the opening Valley Talk, with its intensifying showers of tenor-sax notes over a sultry tango, through the bluesy saunter of Chazz to the novelty song for Jean Michel Basquiat that becomes a brooding blues, the music is strong, sensuous, and effortlessly masterly in the way its varied materials are juggled. It would make a fine Murray primer for newcomers.\" - John Fordham, The Guardian"
