        "text": "Photos courtesy of Orleans County Soil and Water Conservation District\n\nHOLLEY – The popular Holley Falls and Canal Park has many dead ash trees, including trees that have toppled.\n\nThe Orleans County Soil and Water Conservation District has been able to secure a $350,046 grant from the United States Forest Service to pay to clear out the dead trees.\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul last month announced the recipients of the Urban and Community Forest Grants. Soil and Water Conservation Districts applied on behalf of municipalities and communities that face environmental challenges due to climate change as well as economic disparities.\n\n“As many residents of the Village of Holley and throughout Orleans County visit the park for hiking, fishing, and picnicking, keeping the park safe for visitors as well as protecting this environmental resource remained a high priority for our organization,” said Katie Sommerfeldt, district manager for Soil & Water in Orleans County.\n\n“We are excited to take on new and challenging projects that will benefit the community we serve.”\n\nThe Village of Holley DPW will be doing the work over the next three years.

Bourke said law enforcement officers appreciated the support of the community as the job becomes more challenging with what Bourke said are “pro-criminal” laws.\n\nBourke is critical of state legislation that make it more difficult for judges to set bail for people who have been arrested and are a danger to the community.\n\nHe shared how the SWAT team arrested a drug dealer in Orleans County and that person was sitting back on their porch a few hours later, smoking a cigarette.\n\n“We’re not taking care of our citizens,” Bourke said about the legislation. “This should be about protecting people and quality of life.”\n\nJudges should be allowed to review a defendant’s criminal history and determine whether that person is a flight risk in setting bail, Bourke said.\n\nThe state’s “Raise the Age” law also means people can’t be prosecuted as an adult until they are 18, instead of 16.\n\nOther legislation, including discovery laws, have titled the balance towards criminals, Bourke and other speakers said during the rally.\n\n“We love you if you support the police and if you don’t support the police,” Bourke said. “We take care of everybody.”\n\nMany elected officials and those seeking public office welcomed the chance to speak at the rally, including from left: State Sen. Rob Ortt, Murray Town Supervisor Gerry Rightmyer and Kimberly DeRosa, a candidate for the 135th Assembly District on the east side of Monroe County.\n\nOrtt said the State Legislature needs more conservative members who will push back on “pro-criminal legislation” that he said is making our communities less safe and putting law enforcement officers in more danger.\n\nHe cited the examples of officers killed in New York City and Syracuse by people who would have been held in jail before the bail reform changes, which Ortt said has turned the state into “catch and release” program for criminals.\n\n“We need strong candidates who won’t be swayed,” Ortt said about having more Republicans in the Legislature.\n\nRightmyer, the Murray supervisor, said he is particularly angered by people who burn the American flag and then replace it with another country’s flag.\n\nDeRosa said the state laws have gone in the wrong direction with community safety.\n\n“Criminals are emboldened by policies that don’t give them any kind of consequence,” she said.\n\nCongresswoman Claudia Tenney said she would have loved to have ridden her motorcycle on the 50-mile trip but had five events on Sunday. She wore earrings that looked like handcuffs for the Back the Blue rally.\n\nShe said the bail reform has made law enforcement more dangerous. She cited the death of Rochester police officer Tony Mazurkiewicz, who was shot and killed on July 21, 2022 in an ambush.\n\nTenney urged the crowd of about 300 people to support candidates who stand by the Constitution, which she said emphasizes public safety and border security.\n\nAyesha Kreutz, left, and Peter Vazquez spoke at the rally. Kreutz is a member of the Protect Kids Coalition. That group opposes Proposition One on the back of the November ballot. Kreutz said it is presented as an Equal Rights Amendment but is a “Parent Replacement Act,” giving parents less say in how their children process gender identity and medical decisions.\n\nVazquez is a candidate for Monroe County clerk. He said he the country need to move past political party labels. He is focused on “God, country and family.”\n\nHe spoke against the progressive left and “the buffoon in the White House.”\n\nAssemblyman Steve Hawley railed against recently passed state legislation that he said put the communities at risk around the state.\n\n“We are absolutely appalled and dismayed at what law enforcement is facing from the people in Albany,” Hawley said. “Our society has lost its way. The police are our last line of defense.”\n\nRivera thanked the law enforcement officers for their service.\n\n“You get up every day serving us tirelessly and you don’t have to,” Rivera said.\n\nSadwick, a Navy veteran and business owner, said, “You will never see me sitting or kneeling against you.”\n\nVanBrederode said state legislators are out of touch with how police officers do their jobs.\n\nMonroe County Legislator Virginia McIntyre, an opera singer, sang the national anthem.\n\nPress Release, Holley Central School\n\nHOLLEY – Holley Central School is thrilled to introduce Mackenzie Swartz as the new assistant principal of Holley Elementary School. She will be formally appointed by the Holley Board of Education at the Aug. 19 meeting.\n\nBefore working at Holley, Swartz was a teacher on special assignment (TOSA) in the East Irondequoit School District, providing strategic instructional support for elementary teachers.\n\nShe previously taught first grade at Kendall Elementary School and second grade at Ivan Green Primary School in East Irondequoit, where she also served as Literacy Leader and Equity Facilitator. She received her bachelor’s degree in Childhood Education and her master’s degree in Literacy from Roberts Wesleyan University. Swartz received her School Building/District Leadership Certificate from SUNY Brockport.\n\nShe is very excited to join the Holley community and share her passion for elementary education.\n\n“I truly believe that I am a better person today because of all the students I have worked with,” Swartz said. “Elementary school is so special because you get to see students grow so much in their time with us. I am looking forward to learning from and with students here at Holley, and seeing all the unique qualities each student contributes to the school community. I know that this is an incredible community, and I am thankful for the opportunity to be joining the team.”\n\nThe district extends a very warm welcome to Swartz as she embarks on her journey at Holley.\n\n“Mackenzie brings valuable and unique elementary experiences to our building, and we look forward to learning from and growing with her,” said Tim Artessa, principal at Holley Elementary. “We couldn’t be more excited for Mackenzie to be joining our school community. Her enthusiasm for elementary education is going to be very well received by both our students and staff, and I truly believe that her impact will be immediate as she is ready to hit the ground running!”\n\nDaughter of Saint Gianna joins in grand opening celebration\n\nHOLLEY – The pregnancy outreach center opened last Thursday at the St. Mary’s Parish Ministry Center in Holley, and the daughter of a saint was there for the grand opening celebration.\n\nThe center is named for St. Gianna Beretta Molla, who was born in 1922 in Milan, Italy. As a young woman she became a pediatrician and wife. She and her husband, Pietro, had three children, and yet Gianna was able to balance the demands of motherhood, wife and doctor.\n\nIn 1961 she became pregnant with their 4th child, but learned early in the pregnancy that she had cancer. Gianna, herself a doctor, refused to take any steps that would place her child in danger. Accepting the risks that carrying her child to term meant for her, she insisted in the days prior to giving birth, “If you must decide between me and the child, do not hesitate: choose the child – I insist on it – save him.”\n\nOn April 21, 1962, Sr. Gianna gave birth to her daughter, Gianna Emanuela, and despite all efforts to treat St. Gianna, she passed away a week after giving birth. She was canonized a Saint by Pope St. John Paul II on May 16, 2004.\n\nThe daughter for whom she gave her life, Gianna Emanuela Molla, attended the dedication Mass and opening of the new center on July 11 in Holley.\n\nFather Mark Noonan, pastor of the Catholic churches in Orleans and eastern Niagara counties, heard the inspirational story of St. Gianna firsthand from the pope. Father Noonan was the celebrant for this special Mass last Thursday.\n\nThe St. Gianna Molla Pregnancy Outreach Center in Holley is the 8th center in the Diocese of Buffalo, Noonan said.\n\n“We are grateful to be able to serve families by providing material, emotional and spiritual support to mothers, fathers and families in need during and after pregnancy,” he said.\n\nKathy and Bob Schumacher are directors of the center. ONE Catholic plans to open a satellite office to meet with families at Holy Trinity Parish in Medina.\n\n“We are so incredibly blessed to have St. Gianna’s daughter be a living witness to the heroic virtue of her mother at our dedication and opening,” said Kathy Schumacher. “We hope to provide a caring and compassionate atmosphere to assist families from pregnancy through the first years of life.”\n\nHOLLEY – The Holley Board of Education appointed Tim Artessa to be the new principal of the Holley Elementary School. Artessa is no stranger to the students and staff. He has been the assistant principal the past eight years.\n\nHe succeeds Karri Schiavone, who is now Holley’s district superintendent.\n\nArtessa came to Holley eight years ago after working as a sixth grade teacher at Gates Chili Middle School for 13 years.\n\n“Holley is a great place,” Artessa said on Monday after the Board of Education meeting, when his appointment was finalized. “It feels like family here. There are great kids, a very supportive staff and great parents.”\n\nArtessa has previously worked as a summer school assistant principal for Monroe 2–Orleans BOCES. He has a bachelor’s degree in psychology and a master’s degree in elementary education from Nazareth College. He received his administrative certification from the Warner School of Education at the University of Rochester.\n\nSchiavone said Artessa will serve the district well as the elementary principal.\n\n“Tim has been an invaluable member of our administrative team, demonstrating exceptional dedication, leadership, and a deep commitment to the success and wellbeing of our students,” she said. “His devotion to the elementary school over the last eight years makes him uniquely qualified to lead our school into the future. I have full confidence in his ability to continue fostering an innovative, positive and supportive learning environment for all.”\n\nHolley will interview candidates to be the assistant principal this week. The school has about 500 students in grades prekindergarten to 6.\n\nArtessa said one priority will be reducing the number of students who are chronically absent, missing at least 18 days of school a year or 10 percent of the school days. This past year, 28 percent of students were chronically absent in the elementary school, with 24 percent in the middle school grades and 39 percent in the high school.\n\nSchiavone shared those statistics with the Board of Education on Monday. Artessa said the elementary school will be working with parents to improve attendance. Chronic absenteeism has been an issue for many districts around the country since the Covid pandemic in 2020, he said.\n\nThe elementary school also is adding a dedicated STEM classroom as part of a capital project this summer. That classroom in the space where there is a front atrium will allow students and teachers to do innovative learning projects, Artessa said.\n\nThe capital project also is adding air-conditioning to classrooms in kindergarten through grades 2 this summer, with most of the rest of the building to be done the following summer.\n\n“I absolutely adore the students here at Holley Elementary,” Artessa said. “We have made great strides under the building leadership of Ms. Schiavone, and I am committed to continuing that trend moving forward. I am very fortunate to be able to continue leading an amazing staff that shares in the understanding that our students deserve our very best every single day.”\n\nOrleans will get another chance to see second large barge carrying other half of bridge bound for Buffalo\n\nOrleans County will get another chance to see a tugboat pushing an enormous barge on the Erie Canal.\n\nThe first barge will complete its journey to Buffalo, likely today. Carver Companies from near Albany has a tugboat pushing two 195-foot-long barges along the canal. The barges are carrying four sections of a 266-foot-long pedestrian bridge for the Ralph Wilson Park Conservancy in Buffalo. The bridge was made in Italy.\n\nThe barges were traveling close together for most of the journey along the canal. But on Monday one stayed in Pittsford while the other made the trip from Rochester all the way to Gasport. Carver was planning to stop in Albion on Monday and then go back for the other barge from Pittsford.\n\nBut the captain decided to keep going, moving past Albion and going through Orleans County and stopping in Gasport. The crew worked in a downpour on Monday afternoon.\n\nToday the barge pushed by a tugboat reached Lockport around 7 a.m. and will keep moving west, expecting to reach the Tonawanda Canal Fest at 3 p.m.\n\nOnce the barge reaches the final destination in Buffalo, tugboat CMT Otter will go back to Pittsford and then make the journey through the rest of Monroe County, then Orleans, Niagara and to Buffalo in Erie County.\n\n“Good news is you will have two chances to see us!” Carver posted on its Facebook page on Monday night.\n\nPhotos by Tom Rivers\n\nHOLLEY/ALBION – A long barge nears the Keitel Road canal bridge in Albion around 2 p.m. today. Carver Companies is pushing a 195-foot-long barge with a tugboat.\n\nThe company started in Rochester today and headed west. The final destination, which could be in a few days, is in Buffalo for a 266-foot-long pedestrian bridge.\n\nCarver Companies has two barges for moving the bridge which is in four sections, with two sections on each barge. Carver is based in Coeymans, NY, near Albany.\n\nThe company planned to tie up the barge overnight in Albion, but now may go all the way through Orleans County and stop in Gasport. The second barge started the day in Pittsford.\n\nThe barge and tugboat passes under the Bennetts Corners Road canal bridge in Holley around noon.\n\nMany people have lined the canal to get a glimpse of the big barge. This kid was excited when the tug captain sounded the horn on the boat.\n\nThe trek with the long barge has been in the news a lot since the trip started in Albany 11 days ago.\n\nDawn Borchet, the Orleans County tourism director, gets photos of the barge as it approaches the Butts Road bridge in Albion.\n\nBorchet said the journey of the pedestrian bridge has put lots of limelight on the canal. She said crowds of people shows there is a lot of pride in the canal communities for the historic waterway.\n\nKevin Bedard of Holley gets a close photo of the barge and tug as it nears the Holley lift bridge.\n\n“It’s so cool,” Bedard said. “It’s once-in-a lifetime.”\n\nThe massive barge sneaks under the lift bridge in Holley while it is fully extended.\n\nThe barge heads under the Route 237 bridge in Holley after rounding a bend in the canal. The frequent turns, as well as locks, lift bridges and guard gates has made for a painstaking and often slow journey.\n\nThe vessel took it slow going through the guard gate next to the 237 overpass.\n\nThe barge is past the Route 237 bridge out in the open country with the Telegraph Road canal bridge next.\n\nThese people pedal fast on their bikes to stay with the barge and it heads west of Holley.\n\nThe barge passes the Densmore Road bridge in Albion and heads to the Keitel Road bridge around 1:45 p.m.\n\nThese two watch from the Keitel Road bridge as the barge gets closer to the Village of Albion. Many onlookers watched from the canal towpath or from the bridges as the barge worked its way west through Orleans County.\n\nTwo sections of the bridge that were made in Italy are shown on the barge.\n\nThe tug “Otter” moves the long barge. Otter is a 1,200-horsepower tug.\n\nDistricts give students celebratory sendoff during commencement\n\nProvided photos from the school districts\n\nBrian Bartalo, retiring superintendent from Holley Central School, gives the keynote address during commencement on June 29. Holley celebrated the graduation of 63 seniors.\n\nCaitlin Dobri delivers the valedictory address. Other student speakers included: Kayla Neale, salutatorian; and Layne Walker, the class president.\n\nGraduates move their tassels to signify completed high school. Students wore their red Holley Hawk robes and caps for the ceremony inside the school auditorium.\n\nAfter the ceremony students gathered in the gym to toss their graduation caps.\n\nKendall’s 57 graduates (and one honorary foreign exchange student) celebrate commencement on June 28 in the school auditorium.\n\nKendall’s student speakers includes salutatorian Louis Conte and valedictorian Hannah Brundage.\n\nConte shared about his competitive nature and how his high school experiences in athletics and other activities have fueled that competitiveness and need for perfection.\n\n“Every step is growth and advancement,” Conte said. “The way we handle the roadblocks that keep us from our goal of being perfect is what defines us and what needs to be embraced. It’s this mindset that needs to be embraced, not just by me, but by anyone who ever feels like they aren’t enough. Finding silver linings when experiencing failures is a mindset that takes practice. From all my years of playing sports, l’ve learned that practice does not make perfect; it makes progress.”\n\nValedictorian Hannah Brundage reflected on shared experiences and bonds among classmates. She recalled moments the senior class bonded over, including parking lot painting, Senior Breakfast, Commitment Day, “the pickle game” and other activities.\n\n“It’s moments like these that we truly connect through and allow up to pull together through the challenges that life throws at us,” she said. “None of us would be where we are without the people surrounding us, because we are greatly influenced by our surroundings. The people we love, the friends we hang out with – they are what get you past the hardships we all eventually encounter.”\n\nSocial Studies teacher Joseph Petrosino also addressed the graduates. He was chosen by the Class of 2024 to give this year’s commencement address.\n\nPetrosino gave a history lesson on education in Kendall, highlighting unwavering community support for education despite challenges faced. From the original two-room log cabin that housed school lessons, to the hearses pulled by horses that served as school buses.\n\n“The people of this area have never stopped supporting education and supporting the school,” Petrosino said. “When the school community is touched by tragedy, disaster or loss people come to support us both teacher and student alike.”\n\nHe urged students to find their purpose beyond a job, saying, “When you find it, you will know. You’ll work harder than ever before and won’t mind. You’ll feel compelled to do that thing even when you have a million other things to do. You will wake up at night with new ideas, and you will feel alive, working towards something good for the world.”\n\nThe Presentation of the Class of 2024 followed, with advisors Margaret Alloco and Elizabeth Erickson reading student bios and diplomas presented by principal Melissa Strelick and assistant principal Mark Driesel.\n\nThe group moves their tassels to signify the transition from students to graduates.\n\nLyndonville’s 38 students in the Class of 2024 toss their graduation caps to celebrate commencement on June 28. The ceremony was inside at the Stroyan Auditorium.\n\nKayli Miller accepts her diploma from superintendent Sharon Smith.

Schultz will be a senior, Jones will be a junior, and Aidan Kelley is an incoming sophomore. Gabe Linsday, the lead singer, graduated a week ago.\n\nThey have been playing together for about a year, doing school events. Friday was a chance to open for the Moon Hunters. Busch has played with that band as a founding member for about a decade.\n\nSchultz traces the formation to PSA to when he performed as a character, Ricky Hawkston, in the school’s music showcase in June 2022. “Hawkston” was picked for Holley’s mascot, the Hawks. Schultz expanded the band to “Ricky and the Shenanigans” who changed their name to Public Service Announcement.\n\nBusch taught the students rock and roll theory, and stayed after school to help them learn some classic rock songs. Busch ended up joining the band as the drummer.\n\nHe told the crowd at Hickory Ridge that he feels like he is living out his favorite movie, “School of Rock,” where actor Jack Black teaches students to write rock songs and perform in a high-octane band.\n\nSchultz said he is grateful Busch helped the band mesh together and took the students seriously as musicians who wanted to learn rock and roll.\n\n“This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” Schultz said about being in the band with his friends and their music teacher.\n\nThe students are all in the marching band led by Busch, and he would often stay after marching band practice to help them with their rock songs.\n\n“We wouldn’t be where we are without him,” Schultz said.\n\nMore than 100 people attended the opening concert by PSA at Hickory Ridge.\n\nPhotos by Tom Rivers\n\nHOLLEY – Nick Salvatore, lead singer for Clueless, belts out a rock song on Friday evening at Holley’s Concerts on the Canal series.\n\nMusicians will be performing on Friday evenings beginning at 6 p.m. through Aug. 23.\n\nThe lineup for the rest of the series includes:\n\nJuly 12: Brick Band\n\nJuly 19: Old Hippies\n\nJuly 26: Triple Play\n\nAugust 2: Michael Zelazny\n\nAugust 9: Feedback\n\nAugust 16: Ghost Riders\n\nAugust 23: Greg Stanton\n\nClueless performs at Holley Canal Park at 29 East Ave. There were about 75 people at the concert, including a few boaters.\n\nThe band includes, from left in front: Nick Salvatore, Gary Tarr and Robert Gallagher.
