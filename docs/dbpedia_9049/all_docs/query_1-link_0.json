        "text": "American jazz musician (born 1955)\n\nMusical artist\n\nDavid Keith Murray[1] (born February 19, 1955)[2] is an American jazz saxophonist and composer who performs mostly on tenor and bass clarinet. He has recorded prolifically for many record labels since the mid-1970s.[3] He lives in New York City.\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nMurray was born in Oakland, California, United States.[2] He attended Pomona College for two years as a member of the class of 1977, ultimately receiving an honorary degree in 2012.[4] He was initially influenced by free jazz musicians such as Albert Ayler, Ornette Coleman and Archie Shepp. He gradually evolved a more diverse style in his playing and compositions. Murray set himself apart from most tenor players of his generation by not taking John Coltrane as his model, choosing instead to incorporate elements of mainstream players Coleman Hawkins, Ben Webster and Paul Gonsalves into his mature style.[5] Despite this, he recorded a tribute to Coltrane, Octet Plays Trane, in 1999.\n\nMurray was a founding member of the World Saxophone Quartet with Oliver Lake, Julius Hemphill and Hamiet Bluiett.[6] He has recorded or performed with musicians such as Henry Threadgill, James Blood Ulmer, Olu Dara, Tani Tabbal, Butch Morris, Donal Fox, McCoy Tyner, Elvin Jones, Sunny Murray (no relation), Ed Blackwell, Johnny Dyani, Fred Hopkins, Don Pullen, Randy Weston and Steve McCall. David Murray's use of the circular breathing technique has enabled him to play astonishingly long phrases.[7]\n\nHis daughter Crystal Murray is a Franco-American R&B and electro singer and has published an album in 2022 as well as an EP and two singles with the French record label Because Music.[8]\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1980 David Murray was named Village Voice Musician of the Decade.\n\nMurray was honored with the Bird Award[9] in 1986.\n\nHe was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1989.[10]\n\nDavid Murray and his band earned a Grammy Award in 1989 in the Best Jazz Instrumental Group Performance category for Blues for Coltrane: A Tribute to John Coltrane.[11]\n\nIn 1991 he was honored with the Danish Jazzpar Prize.[12]\n\nNewsday named him Musician of the Year in 1993.[13]\n\nHe was given an honorary Doctorate Degree in Music, Pomona College in 2012\n\nHe was awarded a legacy grant by the California Arts Council in 2021\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: David Murray discography\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
