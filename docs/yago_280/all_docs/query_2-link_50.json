        "text": "John Culhane, a writer and film historian, is the author of a book on movie special effects to be published by Ballantine this fall. By John Culhane ack Lemmon, in his temporary dressing room in a gas station in Agoura, Calif., demonstrated how he would deliver his first speech to Walter Matthau in the film ''Buddy Buddy'' - if he could get away with it.\n\n''Matthau is a hit man who pulls into the gas station to use the men's room,'' said Lemmon. ''But I'm already there, on my way to try to reconcile with my wife, who has abandoned me for the head of a sex clinic. Matthau rattles the knob, he knocks. Finally, I come out and say, 'Sorry - I was throwing up. I have this nervous stomach.' ''\n\nFor a brief moment, Lemmon seemed about to encore his act. '' 'Tried everything. They say it's psychosomatic - because of my wife.' ''\n\nLemmon thought it over: ''I don't know if I can get away with almost getting sick again, but I'm going to try.'' Would he first ask Billy Wilder, at 75 still the dean of Hollywood's directors? ''You don't talk about acting - you do it,'' Lemmon said. ''Don't prepare the director by verbally giving him a mental image. He may not see your mental image the same way you do. Show him.''\n\nOn the first take of ''Buddy Buddy,'' Lemmon showed Wilder his sudden attack of nausea. Wilder spoke quietly to Lemmon afterward and that was that. (''Lemmon can act a bad stomach without that,'' said Wilder later. ''Less is more.'')\n\nOn the second take, Lemmon didn't put his handkerchief away as he walked back to his car - and Wilder realized that Lemmon had saved perhaps a second and a half by keeping it in his hand. (''We evolve the simplest scene we can,'' said Wilder afterward. ''The camera also sees Matthau, who is still looking at Lemmon, and Matthau is hung up there if Lemmon takes two seconds longer. So we'll have him keep the handkerchief in his hand.'' Why not a close-up of Lemmon, to release Matthau? ''Close-ups are trump cards,'' said Wilder. ''Don't play them too fast if it's not necessary.'')\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
