        "text": "Jack Lemmon, who has died aged 76, was the most successful tragi-comedian of his age, and twice an Oscar winner. He had one overriding ambition - to act - and confessed to being a workaholic. Indeed the 90s were the busiest decade of his life, with nearly 30 television and screen appearances.\n\nHe will best be remembered for his collaboration with his friend Walter Matthau in The Odd Couple (1968), and for seven movies directed by Billy Wilder, five of them with Matthau, including The Fortune Cookie (1966) and The Front Page (1974). He also paired memorably with Tony Curtis in Wilder's Some Like it Hot (1959).\n\nComedy dominated the early part of his career, and although he won his first Oscar, a supporting one, for his ebullient playing of Ensign Pulver in Mister Roberts (1955), the second came for his performance as the corrupt businessman in Save The Tiger (1973). Other major roles were in the ecological thriller The China Syndrome (1979), as an alcoholic in Days Of Wine And Roses (1962) and as the distraught father in the political film Missing (1982).\n\nDetails of his awards, prizes and nominations would fill the rest of this appreciation, but he was especially proud of the American Film Institute (AFI) lifetime achievement award that he received in 1988, and the honorary Golden Bear he won at the Berlin international film festival in 1996.\n\nAlthough Lemmon had to struggle for recognition early in his career, being born the only child of a wealthy Boston family cushioned him. Lemmon had the distinction of being born in a lift because his mother insisted on staying at the bridge table rather than go to hospital.\n\nAs a child he spent almost two of his first 12 years in hospital, but he was determined to become an actor. His father reluctantly allowed his son, after naval service and gaining a degree from Harvard, to head for New York and fame with just $300 in his pocket.\n\nNot surprisingly the money ran out before Lemmon achieved success, and he used his piano-playing talent to earn a living. But soon the heyday of live television gave him steady work, and he made hundreds of appearances between the late 40s and his big screen breakthrough. He also married in 1950, to Cynthia Stone, but later said he was too young and too busy to make a success of it; they were divorced in 1956.\n\nLemmon made it briefly on Broadway, but Hollywood - and a part opposite the great comedian Judy Holliday - proved irresistible. He followed this 1954 debut, It Should Happen To You, directed by George Cukor, with another Holliday vehicle, Phffft! (also 1954). A year later his break came in the film version of a Broadway hit, Mister Roberts.\n\nFrom then on he seldom stopped working, notching up more than 70 starring roles, plus stage appearances, narrations, television specials and cameos. He also directed one feature, Kotch (1971), starring Matthau, and, via his own company, Jalem, co-produced many of his own movies, as well as the highly successful Cool Hand Luke (1967), starring Paul Newman. Although not especially active politically, he produced a series of films on ecology, including The Slow Guillotine and Timetable For Disaster (1969-70).\n\nLemmon's relationship with Wilder, beginning with Some Like It Hot and The Apartment (1960), was the stuff that cinematic dreams are made of. In the former he and Curtis played out-of-work musicians who, after witnessing the St Valentine's Day Massacre, drag-up to join an all-girl band to avoid the gangsters. Lemmon claimed to have based his make-up and demeanour on his mother, whose humour was matched by her fondness for drink, to such an extent that she asked that her ashes be strewn behind her favourite bar.\n\nIn The Apartment he played C C Baxter, a young man who ingratiates himself with his bosses by letting them use his apartment for assignations. All goes well until one of them brings back the girl C C longs for. This biting satire gave Lemmon the type of role he was to reprise, perhaps too often: that of a likeable man pressured by circumstance.\n\nA couple of years later, in Blake Edwards's sombre Days Of Wine And Roses, he was again at the mercy of his superiors in a PR company. Social drinking leads to him and his wife (Lee Remick) becoming full-blown alcoholics. They attempt to retain normality, but destruction follows.\n\nArguably Edwards's best movie, it began a collaboration that led in 1965 to Lemmon and Curtis reuniting in The Great Race. Lemmon was more suited to the subsequent The Fortune Cookie, in which he took the weaker role, and Matthau gained an Oscar for his portrayal of the conniving brother-in-law. The duo also had great fun with The Odd Couple (1968). Sadly, they were to make The Odd Couple II 30 years later, a film that had none of the vivacity of the original.\n\nLemmon's second Oscar, for best actor, was for his intense performance as a businessman who resorts to arson to avoid bankruptcy. From an opening scene in Save The Tiger when he looks in the shaving mirror and laments the cost of maintaining his lifestyle, Lemmon displays vulnerability and arrogance, typical of his gallery of misfits.\n\nAlthough there had been duds along the way, Lemmon's screen career had been remarkably successful, and he was enormously popular with the public and his peers. He commanded $1m a film, plus a share of often substantial profits. But he was to give increasingly mannered performances in the next years, partly to compensate for weaker films - even from Wilder - including The Front Page and Buddy, Buddy (1981). He drank too much, and was fined for drink-driving in 1976. He gave up alcohol in the early 80s, and gradually cut out his huge cigarette consumption in favour of cigars, then later a comforting pipe.\n\nThe decade yielded him few decent movies. Only The China Syndrome proved a commercial and critical success. In 1979 Lemmon returned successfully to the stage in Tribute, playing a publicist who, discovering that he is terminally ill, tries toreconnect with his estranged wife and son. It was subsequently filmed, but despite plaudits, including a Silver Bear at Berlin in 1981, still seems intensely theatrical on screen. There were better movies to follow, though, notably Costa-Gavras's Missing, in which Lemmon is a father searching for his son, who has disappeared in Chile during the Pinochet coup. The film was critical of the regime - and of the United States' involvement - but Lemmon also saw it as a portrait of an ordinary family man in deep crisis.\n\nIn an effort to stretch himself Lemmon embarked on his most taxing stage role, playing James Tyrone in Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey Into Night. He starred on Broadway, on tour and - importantly for Lemmon - made his London debut in the piece, directed by Jonathan Miller. It was also filmed for television.\n\nAs the years progressed Lemmon became happy to take character roles, including the lacerating role in David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross (1992). His performance as the pitiful Shelley Levene was unequalled in his later career.\n\nLemmon's favourite pastimes were golf, pool and the piano, and he got to use the last in Robert Altman's The Player (1992). Altman subsequently cast him in Short Cuts (1993), and in the same year he received good reviews for a mini-series, A Life In The Theatre, and turned in a commercial hit with Matthau in Grumpy Old Men. They followed it with The Grass Harp (1995), an adaptation of a Truman Capote novel, directed by Matthau's son Charles. Their penultimate work together was Grumpier Old Men (1995).\n\nLemmon's last appearances were on a smaller scale. He hosted The Living Century, a movie about the lives of ordinary people. There was a second work about George Cukor, and, most appropriately, he appeared in the AFI's celebratory 100 Years, 100 Laughs - America's Funniest Movies.\n\nLemmon is survived by his wife, Felicia, their daughter Courtney, and his son Chris from his first marriage.\n\nBrian Baxter\n\nJohn Uhler Lemmon, actor, born February 8, 1925; died June 28, 2001"
