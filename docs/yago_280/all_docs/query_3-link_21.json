        "text": "Jack Lemmon is universally acknowledged as one of the accomplished actors of his time. This transcendent actor’s career spans 45 years and is strewn with nominations and awards—all of which are proof of his tremendous ability to reach out and touch audiences through his performances. Movie-goers from across the world recognize him as the comedian who can make them make them laugh till they cry or as the acting virtuoso who can move them to tears. Be it a desperate young man in high heels, a shift supervisor, a delusional dad, a journalist or just a grumpy old man, this American star consistently raised the bar for actors in Hollywood. He played the ordinary guy down and out on luck so many times that he inspired a successful salesman character on the hit TV show, ‘The Simpsons’. To many critics, he is the best comedian of all time; to acting coaches, the benchmark for hefty dramatic performances; to actors, a venerable source of inspiration; to the filmgoer, absolute magic. Despite an enormously successful career and a timeless acting legacy, this hard-working actor remained a down-to-earth gentleman and was much loved both, on-screen and off it. If you would like to learn more about this consummate actor, scroll further."
