        "text": "A visit to Richards however was not my reason for the aforementioned wandering downtown Peoria on the aforesaid Sunday evening in said late September. Truth be told, tonight a small group of friends and I are planning to take in a show at the Apollo.\n\nEver since I started contributing to this blog I’ve wanted to cover something at the Apollo—it’s one of my favorite places in town. The building’s character, its location, and its history are all just so perfect to me. They often still show classic films on the weekends and present other shows here, but it’s a bit difficult to keep track of the schedule of what’s going on there unless you have the time to walk by and peek in the windows. (Someone should get on that!) But this is finally the night! I’m here and on the bill tonight is a very special engagement.\n\n“A Twist of Lemmon” is a live one-man show about the life, times and memories of actor and Hollywood royalty Jack Lemmon as told by his son, actor and musician Chris Lemmon. And we had tickets for the final performance in its two week run! Because this was an unusually long engagement for a market like Peoria, and perhaps due to the odd performance time (Sunday evenings are typically uncommon for theatre), seats were actually readily available, and we had great ones right in the center and very close to the front.\n\nNinety minutes might not be very long, but it’s long enough that I should probably use the bathroom before it starts. I was highly amused by the tile work in the Apollo’s bathroom, because if you look closely...it’s all fake! It’s an elaborate stamp painting onto the walls! So I decided to capture it and even managed one of those infamous MBIP obligatory mirror shots in the process.\n\nFinally we are in the theatre, done up quite elegantly with just a baby grand, a single chair, a few easels and a screen which would help illustrate the story with old photos and clips. Once the announcements come on, the show will soon begin, so it’s time to put away the phone/camera, of course.\n\nAnd then for the next hour and a half or so, we all sat transfixed. Chris Lemmon came onstage to enthusiastic applause, gave a personable introduction setting the show up, and the next thing we knew, he assumed the more familiar persona of his father. That's when this show really started and I swear, Jack Lemmon returned and was standing right there in front of us, and just for us, at the Apollo Theatre on that Sunday evening in late September.\n\nWe heard him tell stories of working with legends such as James Cagney, Gregory Peck, Walter Matthau of course, and yes, even Marilyn Monroe. It’s important to note however, as Chris often does in his press for the show, that HE does not impersonate these people or tell the stories of these legends—it’s him as his father telling these tales in their voice.\n\nFrom the show it was revealed that Jack’s career came first and he was a relatively absentee father while Chris was growing up; they did not become close until many years later. Yet, despite their differences and bumps along the way, music was one thing they shared and always connected Chris and Jack and it played a big part in the show—the songs Chris played felt like familiar friends, because indeed many of them were-classics and standards pulled from films and that proverbial “Great American Song Book”.\n\nChris’s parents divorced when he was quite young, and by the end of the show it was clear that Jack always carried a torch for Chris’s mother and never stopped loving her. It was also quite evident that he had little love for his stepmother, Jack’s second wife, whom he blames for a large part of their complicated relationship.\n\nOf course, with the show having been written by Chris, one can expect that it’s all skewed a bit to favor his perspective, but as an artist that is his prerogative to give things the angle he wants. It’s important to note however that the show is NOT a dirty laundry, tell-all airing of grievances, and while it does touch upon the bumps their relationship had, it’s a very positive premise that focuses less on Jack’s absenteeism and most of all on the friendship they shared as adults.\n\nNot only that, but this additional 30 or so minutes practically served as an additional act to the show. A lot of it had to do with golf, and the time Jack and Chris spent golfing at Pebble Beach, which was a big part of their lives. To be honest I seem to shut down at the very mention of golf, but those stories got much more interesting once he started dropping names like Clint Eastwood and his good friend Andy Garcia into them. I really enjoyed hearing about his days growing up in Hollywood when he could claim people such as Marilyn Monroe and Peter Lawford as neighbors.\n\nHe kept claiming to be pretty exhausted after this run (this had been a two show day) and he’d soon be traveling back home as well, but it wasn’t evident in his dynamic way of storytelling. At one point, his energy was so great he leapt out of his seat to finish telling some chestnut, and his posture and mannerisms totally reminded me from this moment in The Apartment. Their likeness was at times, surreal. His parting words to everyone as the meeting wrapped up was “Go to the people you love, and tell them you love them, because you don’t know what you’ve got until it’s gone”.\n\nAnd then I got to meet him. We (very) briefly chatted about acting and grabbed a photo together but I was pretty much the last one to leave and I didn’t want to take up too much time. I then left still thinking about the show as I wandered back through downtown Peoria on that Sunday evening in late September."
