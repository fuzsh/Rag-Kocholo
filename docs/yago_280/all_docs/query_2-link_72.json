        "text": "Before every one of his performances, the late Jack Lemmon would take a deep breath and say, “It’s magic time.”\n\nIt’s a popular anecdote about the legendary, Academy Award-winning actor, and a ritual that has been resurrected by his son, Chris Lemmon, before the curtain rises on his one-man stage show, “Twist of Lemmon,” which will have a two-week run at the Apollo Theater beginning Wednesday.\n\nAn adaptation of Chris Lemmon’s memoir of the same title, “Twist” brings the father-son relationship off the page and onto the stage in an unexpected way: Chris portrays his father, who in turn talks to the audience about his son.\n\n“It’s kind of a mind screw, really,” Chris said.\n\nPart of that depiction entails the elder Lemmon’s crippling alcoholism and the strains it caused on the family — a version of the acting great unseen in even his most challenging roles on the silver screen. But “Twist of Lemmon” also possesses a whimsical touch in guiding the audience through Jack Lemmon’s career, a golden age of Hollywood and the iconic movie stars that defined the era. Gregory Peck, Marilyn Monroe, Shirley MacLaine and James Cagney all make cameo appearances during “Twist” by way of Chris’ homages.\n\n“In a one-person show, you have to create a whole world around you, and sustain that world throughout the 90 minutes, out of thin air,” Chris said.\n\nThe show has evolved from the initial memoir and almost has been rewritten in some ways. Adapting the story to a play had its troubles as Chris tinkered with it during a run at the Royal George Theatre in Chicago, back when the show was called “Jack Lemmon Returns.” Chris has an uncanny resemblance to his father, both in visage and in the sound of his voice. When Chris gets going on a topic, he echoes the excitable stammering cadence that infiltrated his father’s speech, one of the many little details in Jack Lemmon performances that made a character seem like an every man. Despite the similarities, Chris did rigorous research on his father, going back to watch all of his father’s film roles and read all the literature devoted to him. In order for the one-man show to work, he had to channel his father and inhabit him. A review from the Los Angeles Times observed that it’s “hard to believe it’s Chris and not Jack onstage.”\n\nThe two-week run at the intimate Apollo Theater will amount to a homecoming of sorts for Chris. His mother, Cynthia Stone, was the daughter of John Boyd Stone, the former CEO of First National Bank and a prominent figure of Peoria’s past. His mother’s story plays a part in “Twist of Lemmon” and Chris hopes some of his local family members will see his recollections of her.\n\nBut Chris hopes for something else, not simply from his family but from all of the audience. At 61 years old, he has crafted a decades-long career on his own as a pianist and actor. As much as the allure of the show is to see the closest incarnation to Jack Lemmon possible, the heart of the story is Chris. It’s the realization he had that transformed the work in progress of “Jack Lemmon Returns” to the fully realized “Twist of Lemmon.”\n\n“I did a lot of decent work in my time,” Lemmon said. “But there was never anything I could really point at and say, ‘If they stick me in a pine box tomorrow, I did that.’ And here, at this point in my career, to bring not just my writing but also my acting and music onstage, has just been so rewarding.”\n\nThe Lemmon doesn’t fall far from the tree, and when Chris imitates his father’s phrase — “It’s magic time” — before the curtain rises, it’ll be Chris’ own magic this time.\n\nThomas Bruch can be reached at 686-3262 or tbruch@pjstar.com.
