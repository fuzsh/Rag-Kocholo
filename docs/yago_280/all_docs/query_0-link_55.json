        "text": "Jack Lemmon, the brash young American Everyman who evolved into the screen's grumpiest old Everyman during a movie career that lasted a half century, died on Wednesday at a hospital in Los Angeles. He was 76 and lived in Beverly Hills.\n\nThe cause was complications from cancer, said a spokesman, Warren Cowan.\n\nThrough most of his more than 60 movies, Mr. Lemmon was the least glamorous and most approachable of movie stars -- the good-natured, ordinary guy next door with a slightly skewed moral compass. He was a master of sardonic comedy and could convey urban frustrations so deftly that audiences identified with him and thus were able to laugh at themselves.\n\nAs C. C. Baxter in ''The Apartment'' (1960), Billy Wilder's Academy Award-winning film, he created the definitive comic hero for an age of anxiety, an office worker so eager to win a promotion that he lends his apartment to his married bosses for weekly trysts with their secretaries. As a lecherous landlord in ''Under the Yum Yum Tree'' (1963), he rented apartments only to pretty and, he hoped, compliant women.\n\nAs Ensign Pulver in ''Mister Roberts'' (1955), a performance that gained him an Oscar for best supporting actor, he was a callow but likable wheeler-dealer. As a policeman turned pimp in Mr. Wilder's ''Irma la Douce'' (1963), he was so bewitched by a prostitute that he tricked her by becoming her lover in disguise. And in one of his most memorable roles, as a musician forced to dress up as a woman to escape gangsters in Mr. Wilder's ''Some Like It Hot'' (1959), he got engaged to another man (played by Joe E. Brown) because it was his only chance to marry a millionaire."
