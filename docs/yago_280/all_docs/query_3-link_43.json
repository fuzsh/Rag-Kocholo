        "text": "For the first time ever, the custom home of Actor Jack Lemmon has been listed for sale.\n\n30870 Broad Beach Road is offered at $13,450,000 and exclusively represented by Tony Mark and Russell Grether of The Mark.\n\nJack Lemmon (1925-2001) was one of the most popular movie actors of the second half of the last century. He was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won twice. Jack was a world-renowned talent in both comedies and dramas, starring in over 60 films including Some Like It Hot (for which he won the year’s Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor), The Apartment, Days of Wine and Roses, The Odd Couple, Glengarry Glen Ross, Mister Roberts, The China Syndrome, and many other box office hits.\n\nLocated on the eastern section of Malibu’s star-studded Broad Beach, this home has long been in the Lemmon family for decades and holds a special place in their hearts.\n\nJack’s daughter, Courtney Lemmon, remembers the home fondly, saying that “the house was designed and re-built with my father’s painstaking attention to every detail, in the late 80’s. He and my mother created a private sanctuary for us, and also a place to entertain friends in a most relaxed way.”\n\nDuring Jack Lemmon’s time on Broad Beach, the neighbors included frequent co-stars and good friends such as Walter Matthau, Frank Sinatra, and more.\n\n“There were countless dinners outside, poker games with the Sinatra’s from down the road, parties at the Wilder’s next door, family Thanksgivings with the Matthau’s, and many Fourth of July celebrations,” Courtney recounts. “My father even put a putting green on the dune to practice his golf swing (with biodegradable golf balls of course). The memories of growing up on Broad Beach are indelible and a deeply cherished part of my family’s story. This was our oasis to recharge, and reconnect. I hope that Broad Beach brings as much joy to the new owners as it did to us.”\n\nThe home features beautiful and intricate brick construction, a tribute to traditional building, while maintaining the casual elegance that Malibu is renowned for. Custom features include a two-bedroom beachfront home with ocean views, completely hand-carved interior woodwork, and a tiled saltwater pool with fountains in a large, walled garden. The detached guest studio has a spacious, tiled shower, fireplace, and french doors. A rooftop deck is perched overhead providing panoramic views out to sea and down the coast.\n\nThe eastern location on Broad Beach is unique to a select number of properties. These properties lie distanced from public access points and offer all of the joys of coastal living while remaining walking distance from the local market, coffee shops, restaurants, and more at Trancas Country Market."
