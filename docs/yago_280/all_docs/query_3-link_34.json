        "text": "Throughout his 47 years as an actor, he worked on 50 films, earned 8 Academy Awards nominations, and won the Oscar twice. He was named Best Supporting Actor in for his role of ‘Ensign Pulver’ in ‘Mister Roberts,’ and for Best Actor for ‘Save the Tiger’ in 1973. His career included two inspired collaborations – 10 films with Walter Matthau (one of his best friends) which included the ‘Grumpy Old Men’ series and with director Billy Wilder. He also gave memorable performances on television, including the 1997 remake of ‘Twelve Angry Men,’ ‘Inherit the Wind,’ and ‘Tuesdays with Morrie,’ for which he received an Emmy. He was married to actress Felicia Farr from 1962 until his death due to cancer. His grave is not marked with his full name or any dates, simply and humorously carved in the stone is essentially the film credit ‘Jack Lemmon in’ – but what he is ‘in’ is now the ground, at Westwood Memorial Park in Westwood California. Just two graves over from screenwriter, Director Billy Wilder with who he worked on 7 films, including AFI’s number one comedy movie of all time – ‘Some Like It Hot.’ (Actor Carroll O’Conner of ‘All in the Family’ fame is between the two) and not far from great friend Walter Matthau."
