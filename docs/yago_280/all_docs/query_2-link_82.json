        "text": "Jack Lemmon Returns @ The Rubicon Theatre\n\nReviewed 11 March, 2015 by Robert Roll\n\nIf you didn’t love Jack Lemmon before, scope this out. In its first full season, the fledgling Rubicon company lost a headline show days before its opening. A theatre staffer who had met the double Oscar-winner socially called Lemmon up on his gracious “if you ever need anything, just call” offer. A day later that call was returned personally by the actor. Nice guy, right?\n\nRubicon’s “replacement” show, Love Letters, debuted in 2001 starring Lemmon and his wife Felicia Farr. The powerhouse couple’s commitment led to subsequent performances by a mini-galaxy of Hollywood talent, and helped put the Gold Coast’s newest Equity playhouse solidly on the map. Love Letters would turn out to be Jack Lemmon’s final stage performance.\n\nFlash forward to 2015—Jack’s only son Chris received a phone call just a few days ago when another Rubicon production had to be re-scheduled. His one man show Jack Lemmon Returns has more than stepped in, it steps up the Rubicon playbook with humor, pathos and panache.\n\nWhat an amazing dynamic this show has. Grieving over his father’s death at the age of 76, Lemmon fils wrote a transformational book, A Twist of Lemmon, in which he processes the loss of a man who was at turns his show business dad, the man who left his mother Cynthia Stone when he was three years old, his piano teacher, companion on manly fishing expeditions and the Pebble Beach Pro Am Tour, and ultimately that sweetest gift a father can give to his son, a true best friend.\n\nHershey Felder’s script and direction infuses Jack Lemmon Returns with a depth and subtlety that rejects tabloid sensation and instead paints a universal story of father and son in the post-modern, pre-Kardashian world of celebrity life in the media fisheye.\n\nChris Lemmon bears a striking resemblance to his ever-youthful dad (down to the fifties haircut for the current run). This truly gifted actor/writer/musician is the only man on the planet who can channel the gestures, the nervous chuckles, the voice and body language of Jack Lemmon. No other actor will ever have access to the elemental nature of his subject.\n\nThe son begins his performance by asking the question “What happens if you’re this guy’s kid?”. He then launches into a tour de force of his father’s keystone moments, milestones and friendships. Lemmon meticulously channels his father’s wicked impersonations of Hollywood luminaries ranging from Walter Matthau to Jimmy Cagney, a scorchingly deadpan Neil Simon, as well as directors John Ford, Billy Wilder and the surprise topper—Hollywood’s lisping “women’s director” George Cukor.\n\nThere is music delivered at the keyboard by our classically-trained star, as well as some smooth Mancini tracks provided by Erik Carstensen’s sound design. Family photos and production stills projected on Andrew Wilder’s minimalist screenset move the story forward in an organic fashion. In a one-man show, this production scores on all counts by letting one man reveal his story.\n\nJack Lemmon Returns is a compelling reason for any theatre lover to make the hour’s drive to balmy Ventura. So go!\n\nJack Lemmon Returns\n\nRubicon Theatre Company\n\n1006 East Main Street\n\nVentura, CA 93001\n\n805-667-2900\n\nTicket Range: $44-54\n\nThursday March 12 8:00 p.m.\n\nSaturday March 14 2:00 p.m.\n\nSaturday March 14 8:00 p.m.\n\nSunday March 15 2:00 p.m.\n\nWednesday March 18 2:00 p.m\n\nWednesday March 18 7:00 p.m. Post-show Talkback\n\nThursday March 19 8:00 p.m.\n\nFriday March 20 8:00 p.m.\n\nSaturday March 21 2:00 p.m.\n\nSaturday March 21 8:00 p.m.\n\nSunday March 22 2:00 p.m.\n\nWednesday March 25 2:00 p.m.\n\nWednesday March 25 7:00 p.m. Post-show Talkback\n\nThursday March 26 8:00 p.m.\n\nFriday March 27 8:00 p.m.\n\nSaturday March 28 8:00 p.m."
