        "text": "“Here’s me with my father Jack Lemmon at the piano around 1960 when I was aged five or six. I believe it was shortly after this that he turned to me and said, ‘Kid, if you’re going to keep playing along with me, you’re gonna have to take some lessons.’ And that was the start of my career as a pianist.\n\nThe photo was taken at my mother’s beach house in Santa Monica, where she lived after she and my father got divorced.\n\nIt was comedian Harold Lloyd’s old place and even though he and my mother [actress Cynthia Stone] split up, my dad still came to see us on pretty much a daily basis, and the first thing he’d do was the thing he loved the most – sit down at the piano and play.\n\nBecause I adored and idolised him, I’d always sit next to him, and I think this picture sums up our whole parent-child relationship, which I described in my book about him.\n\nDad was loving yet competitive and caring yet judgmental. Every son has that need for their father’s approval, don’t they?\n\nI remember the exact moment I realised my dad was famous.\n\nI was in the school playground and some kid came running over and said, ‘You see that guy over there? He’s more famous than your father because he’s Jim West’ – meaning he was Robert Conrad from the TV show The Wild Wild West, which was huge at the time. I said, ‘Wait a minute! I didn’t know my father was famous – I just thought he was an actor.’\n\nHe was away a lot for work. The job always came first, but at least I got to go on location with him. I recall being very young, on the set of Some Like It Hot, staring at Marilyn Monroe.\n\nThen I went along to watch the filming of The Great Race, where Tony Curtis gave me fencing lessons. One lunchtime, the director Blake Edwards got each cast member their own golf cart and had them made up to look exactly like the classic cars they were driving in the film. It was great fun.\n\nLater on, when I became an actor myself, I was shooting the TV show Duet on the same lot where Dad was doing 12 Angry Men, and he loved popping over to watch me work.\n\nDad would also create adventures for us, one of which was taking me fly-fishing. Then, as we grew older and realised how much we enjoyed each other’s company and friendship, I decided to teach myself how to play golf because he loved it so much. In fact, we had a decade competing together in the Pebble Beach golf tournament.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In fact, I recall after a particular bender, him stumbling downstairs and telling me he’d contacted Alcoholics Anonymous – and I’m glad to say he never had another drink.\n\nI am now playing my father on stage, which I think he would have gotten a hoot out of. And the Lemmon doesn’t fall far from the tree because I’m definitely my father’s son. I have a few inches on him but I look like him and I have a lot of his mannerisms.\n\nMy favourite performance of his? That would have to be The Apartment because he always did his best to convince people comedy and drama could be seamlessly intertwined, and he does that so well in the film.\n\nMy one regret is that he didn’t get to spend more time with his grandchildren – Jonathan, 19, Chris Jr, 21, and Sydney, 25.\n\nWhen Sydney was younger, she burst into tears and said, ‘I feel the world knows my grandfather better than I do.’ That’s one of the reasons I wrote a book about him.”\n\nChris stars in Twist Of Lemmon at the St James Studio in London from June 1 to 18.
