        "text": "American actor and author (born 1954)\n\nChristopher Boyd Lemmon (born June 22, 1954)[1] is an American actor and author.\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nLemmon was born in Los Angeles, California, the son of actress Cynthia Stone and actor Jack Lemmon.[2] Lemmon attended the Verde Valley School in Sedona, Arizona.[3] With a talent for music, he was encouraged by his father to study piano. Lemmon considered playing piano professionally after having graduated from the California Institute of the Arts, with degrees in classical piano and composition, and in theater.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nHe appeared as an actor in numerous stage productions, including the west-coast tour of Barefoot in the Park, directed by Jerry Paris, the original West coast production of Shay by Anne Commire, and A. R. Gurney's Love Letters with Stephanie Zimbalist. He portrayed Richard Phillips in two situation comedies, Duet (1987) and Open House (1989), and also co-starred as Martin \"Bru\" Brubaker in the television series Thunder in Paradise alongside American professional wrestler Hulk Hogan. Lemmon is also a screenwriter and producer.[4] Algonquin Books published Lemmon's tribute to his father, titled A Twist of Lemmon (2006), which was re-released in 2008 as a paperback by Applause Theatre and Cinema Books.\n\nHe appeared in three films with his father: Airport '77 (1977), That's Life! (1986), and Dad (1989).\n\nLemmon adapted his tribute to his father, A Twist of Lemmon to the stage in 2015. The show, which Lemmon has performed all around the United States, follows the relationship between Lemmon and his father as seen through his father's eyes.[5]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nLemmon has been married to actress Gina Raymond since 1988. The couple reside in Connecticut and have three children.[2]\n\nHealth issues\n\n[edit]\n\nOn December 19, 2018, after an article was published several weeks prior in The San Diego Union-Tribune, Lemmon confirmed on Facebook that he had recently undergone a double-lung transplant due to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and was recovering.[6]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nAirport '77 (1977)\n\nJust Tell Me You Love Me (1980)\n\nThe Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood (1980)\n\nSeems Like Old Times (1980)\n\nC.O.D.
