        "text": "Acting legend Jack Lemmon is remembered through a one-man show starring his son, Chris Lemmon\n\n“A Twist of Lemmon” will be performed at the Bickford Theatre at the Morris Museum from August 19 through 30.\n\nLemmon based the script on his own memoir of the same name\n\nMORRISTOWN – “I know my father loved me, but he loved his work more.”\n\nMany adult children of workaholic parents can empathize with that sentiment. However, in this case, it carries a particular poignancy.\n\nThe speaker is Chris Lemmon. His father: Jack Lemmon, the two-time Oscar-winning actor whose “work” was bringing enjoyment to millions of people for close to 60 years.\n\nIn films such as “Some Like It Hot,” “The Apartment,” “The Odd Couple,” “The China Syndrome,” and “Grumpy Old Men,” Lemmon demonstrated extraordinary range. He was equally convincing at comedy as at drama.\n\nHe won Academy Awards for “Mr. Roberts” in 1955 and “Save the Tiger” in 1973. Lemmon remains one of only a handful of actors to have won Oscars in the supporting and lead categories.\n\nNow, 14 years after his father’s death, Chris Lemmon is giving the world a glimpse of the man behind the movies.\n\nSince January, he has been performing a one-man show called “A Twist of Lemmon,” in which he portrays his father, down to his vocal mannerisms.\n\nThe production will come to the Bickford Theatre at the Morris Museum in Morristown for 11 performances between Aug. 19 and 30.\n\nAdopting his famous father’s voice for the play was no problem. “The Lemmon doesn’t fall too far from the tree,” Chris Lemmon joked.\n\nMore seriously, he explained, “I had to go through my memories of him, with all his quirks and favorite phrases. I have to channel him.”\n\nSharing Hollywood glamour\n\nDuring the show, Lemmon recounts plenty of anecdotes about actors, actresses and celebrities, from Tony Curtis and Marilyn Monroe to Billy Wilder and Gregory Peck.\n\nHe devotes considerable time to Walter Matthau, who shared the screen with Jack Lemmon in nine movies. “Walt was a curmudgeon, but he was a wonderful curmudgeon,” Chris Lemmon said. “He was the brother my father never had.”\n\n“The crazy thing is that I do (impersonate) more than 50 characters, but it’s not me doing them,” he said. “It’s Pop doing them.”\n\nBut “A Twist of Lemmon” is more than just a checklist of Hollywood celebrities. Chris Lemmon feels it is primarily the story of a man and his son, the walls that kept them from being together, and the way they ultimately united.\n\nChris Lemmon was born in 1954 to Jack Lemmon’s first wife, Cynthia Stone. His parents divorced in 1956. But though Chris’ mother had custody, he frequently saw his father.\n\n“Yes, he was a wonderful father, but his career came first,” Chris Lemmon said. “We started as father and son but were torn apart. He had a fear of emotional commitment.”\n\nHowever, he added that those barriers came down well before the older Lemmon’s death in 2001 at age 76. “He was my very best friend,” Chris Lemmon said. “He was a magnificent man.”\n\nIn 2006, Chris Lemmon published “A Twist of Lemmon: A Tribute to My Father.” Gradually, he evolved the idea of turning the story into a one-man show. (The script also includes Lemmon performing some of his father’s favorite songs.)\n\n“This has always been a story about a father and a son,” he said. “It’s a universal story. But it’s also Jack Lemmon telling his life story as it affected his son.”\n\nThe script also touches on some of the darker aspects of his father’s life. “There’s a huge mea culpa at the end where he talks about his alcoholism,” he said.\n\n“I wanted to show the bumps in the road, but I also wanted to show the hugs” Chris Lemmon said. “Despite all the tough times, and all the stuff that kept us apart, he really loved me.”\n\nAn evolving story\n\n“A Twist of Lemmon” premiered this past January. Even in a few months, the script has evolved. “When I started, it was two hours and 20 minutes long,” he said. “It was hard to cut it down. A lot of babies bit the dust. But I’m certainly proud of it.”\n\nThe Bickford production marks the New Jersey premiere of “A Twist of Lemmon.” Eric Hafen, producing artist director of the Bickford, said it is a double pleasure for the theater to present Lemmon.\n\n“I’m a die-hard Jack Lemmon worshipper,” Hafen said. “There were so many colors to his performances. He could be serious, supercilious, funny. I have 100 percent respect for what he did as an actor.”\n\nNonetheless, Hafen added that he needed to approach “A Twist of Lemmon” professionally. “I had to divorce my love of Jack Lemmon from what this show is. I found that everyone has spoken very highly of the production.”\n\n“To me, this show shows that the Bickford is being looked at as a venue for new work,” Hafen said. “I would love to see the Bickford become a conduit for new plays, similar to the way the Paper Mill Playhouse has become a conduit for musicals.”\n\n“A Twist of Lemmon” is far from Chris Lemmon’s only acting credit. He has appeared in in more than 20 films and several TV series. However — unlike his father — he felt the need to balance family and work.\n\n“I took a hiatus in my career to raise my kids,” said Chris Lemmon, referring to his daughter Sydney and his sons Chris Jr. and Jonathan, who are in their late teens and 20s.\n\n“I didn’t want my kids to have I had — the empty chair at the end of the table where the father sits,” he said.\n\nNonetheless, as an actor, Chris Lemmon is in a position to appreciate Jack Lemmon’s versatility as a performer. “He did it so easily,” he said. “He made people think, ‘Oh, that doesn’t look so hard.’ ”\n\n“Pop never believed that comedy and drama had to be separate,” Chris Lemmon said. For that reason, he singles out “The Apartment,” the seriocomic 1960 film, as the first role in which Jack Lemmon seamlessly merged humor with pathos.\n\n“Pop was always an everyman,” Chris Lemmon said. “How do you describe it? He had that ‘it’ factor. And it wasn’t just onstage. He had it offstage, too.”\n\nChris Lemmon observed that audiences of various ages respond to “A Twist of Lemmon.” “I’ve had many young people say to me, ‘I didn’t know who any of these people were, but I identified with it.’ ”\n\n“This is not a torch song, and it’s not cabaret,” Chris Lemmon said. “I want people walk out of this feeling that they’ve had a personal discussion with a man who everyone adored. I want them to feel like they’ve had a cup of coffee with him.”\n\n“A TWIST OF LEMMON”\n\nWHAT: Chris Lemmon portrays his father, the Oscar-winning actor Jack Lemmon in this one-man show with music. The show consists of candid recollections of Lemmon’s 60-year career in film, his fellow actors, his friends, and his family.
