        "text": "Please see Part 1 of this series, which features multiple acting couples.\n\nThe joke in pop culture is that all marriages in Hollywood are brief and frequent.\n\nFor Valentine’s Day in 2013, I created a list of 56 actors and actresses who had long, successful marriages. The list was overwhelming, and I promised a follow-up post including more long marriages.\n\nWell five years later, I have a follow-up. This time I created a list that included nearly 60 actors. It was so long that I am only sharing 30 couples and will share more next year.\n\nYou can read the first 2013 post “In sickness and in health: Successful Hollywood marriages” here, which includes actors like Eva Marie Saint, Shirley Temple, James Stewart, Paul Newman/Joanne Woodward, and Joel McCrea/Francis Dee.\n\nMy definition of a successful Hollywood marriage is longer than 20 years and no divorce:\n\nRuby Dee and Ossie Davis (Married 1948 until his death in 2005) Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee met in 1945 when they both starred in the play “Jeb.” Throughout their marriage, the two performed together in 11 plays and five films. Outside of their art, they were activists together. Dee and Davis celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary in 1998 by releasing the book “With Ossie and Ruby: In This Life Together,” where they were discussed their support of open marriages and that “lies, not infidelity” ruin a marriage. The two had three children: Guy Davis, Nora Day and Hasna Muhammad.\n\nHume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy (Married 1942 until her death in 1994) The two met in 1940 and were married in 1942 after a two-year courtship. In a 1995 interview, Hume Cronyn said he first saw Tandy onstage in the play “The White Steed.” While it wasn’t love at first sight, he was “certainly impressed.” The two acted in several films and plays together over the years. In 1994, the couple was presented the first Tony Lifetime Achievement Award. They had two children: Christopher and Tandy. After Jessica’s 1994 death, Cronyn remarried in 1995 and passed away in 2003.\n\nCraig Stevens and Alexis Smith (Married 1944 until her death in 1993) Alexis Smith and Craig Stevens met in 1941 when they were both contract players at Warner Brothers and acting in films together, including “Steel Against the Sky.” The two were engaged in 1942 before Stevens went into the Army.

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer’s publicity department thought he was out of town and were using his pool to photograph Lewis. Powell introduced himself, and six weeks later the two were married, according to her 1997 obituary. Powell was 47 (and this was his third marriage) and Lewis was 21, and Hollywood assumed the marriage wouldn’t work, but the two were married until Powell’s death in 1980. Powell’s nickname for her was “Mousie.” In 1943, Diana Lewis retired from acting. “I’ve been in show business all my life, but my marriage is more important to me than anything else,” she said.

Joanna is now an interior decorator.\n\nEli Wallach and Anne Jackson (Married 1948 until his 2014 death) The two met in 1946 when they were both cast in a production of Tennessee Williams’s “This Property Is Condemned.” “Little did I know that I would spend the rest of my life with that red-head whose name I couldn’t remember,” Wallach wrote in his autobiography. They had a son and two daughters together. The two acted in films but preferred the stage. “For actors, movies are a means to an end,” Wallach said in a 1973 interview.

Mayer gave Haines an ultimatum: either he gave up his lifestyle and married a woman or his career was over. So Haines left his acting career, with his last film released in 1934. William and Jimmie were successful interior decorators from the 1930s until they retired in the 1970s. Some of their clients included Joan Crawford, Carole Lombard, Marion Davies, Ronald and Nancy Reagan, and George Cukor. William died in 1973 of lung cancer, and Jimmie was depressed after his death.

The two moved in together (it was taboo for unmarried people to live together at this time), and Paula signed a contract with MGM in 1960. The studio asked that the couple marry so that the unmarried couple wouldn’t be traveling together on promotional appearances. “I accepted it all to be with the girl I wanted to be with,” Benjamin said. The couple acted together on the TV show, “He & She” from 1967 to 1968. The couple also acted together in the films “Catch-22” (1970), “Saturday the 14th” (1981), and the Broadway play “The Norman Conquests” (1975). They are also one of the few married couples to host Saturday Night Live (SNL) together. The couple has two children, son, Ross Benjamin and daughter, Prentiss Benjamin. “When Paula was sick (she had a mental breakdown in 1965), people wondered why I didn’t leave her,” Richard said in a 1976 People interview. “And when I wasn’t working they wondered why she didn’t leave me. People all along have tried to come between us. It took a long time to figure out that it was their problem, not ours.”\n\nTheda Bara and Charles Brabin (Married in July 1921 until her death on April 7, 1955) Charles Brabin directed actress Theda Bara in the films “Kathleen Mavourneen”(1919) and “La belle Russe” (1919).

Theda Bara died from abdominal cancer in 1955, and Charles died two years later in 1957.\n\nSophia Loren and Carlo Ponti (Married 1966 until his death in 2007) Carlo first saw Sophia Loren when he was 38 at a beauty contest he was judging and invited her to take a screen test. She was 19, and he was still married when they began their love affair, and Ponti helped develop Loren’s career, insisting that she should learn English, so she wasn’t limited to Italian films. Ponti obtained a divorce in Mexico in 1957 so the two could be married. However, the divorce wasn’t legal in Italy, so their marriage was annulled in 1962. They remarried in 1966 and were married until Ponti died in 2007. Sophia wanted to be a mother but had a difficult time. The couple had two sons, Eduardo and Carlo Jr., and Sophia had bed rest during both pregnancies.\n\nRonald Reagan and Nancy Davis (Married 1952 until his death in 2004) Ronald Reagan started as a contract player with Warner Brothers in 1937 and was a lead and supporting character throughout the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s.

According to his book and Jane’s autobiography, the two found that they had a great deal in common. After meeting and starting a relationship in 1981, the two carried on a long-distance relationship from California to New York until Jane moved to New York City in 1982 to live with Dick.

They finally went out on a date a few weeks later and then were married in 1973. Later in 1973, they had their only child, a daughter named Natasha. In a 2016 interview, Caine joked that the secret to a good marriage is having separate bathrooms.
