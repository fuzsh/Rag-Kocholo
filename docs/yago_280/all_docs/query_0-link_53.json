        "text": "CHAMBERSBURG, Pa. — When Chris Lemmon steps onstage to perform “A Twist of Lemmon,” it’s like his father, Jack, is there, too.\n\nAmerican actor Jack Lemmon received two Academy Awards and was known for such films as “The Odd Couple,” “Some Like It Hot” and “Days of Wine and Roses,” along with a slew of other acting and music credits. He died in 2001 at the age of 76.\n\nBut to Chris Lemmon, whose mother was Cynthia Stone, Jack Lemmon was “Pop.”\n\nAnd on Sunday, Nov. 22, he’s bringing a little bit of his father to The Capitol Theatre in Chambersburg when he performs his one-man show based on his book of the same name.\n\n“A Twist of Lemmon” is about Chris’ relationship with his father. He said he knew he wanted to take the stories “to another level.”\n\n“I didn’t feel it would work as a screenplay or teleplay,” he said during a telephone interview from his Hartford, Conn., home. “I knew it really needed to be stage and it should be one man. And that’s what I did, but it was still doing it in my voice. ... I realized it could be more than that. I realized it could be theater, and the only way that could happen was if I’m playing a part. And that was that palm to your head moment: ‘Of course. I have to be Pop.’”\n\nLemmon, who is an actor, director, writer and musician, said that was “when the real work began.”\n\n“I dug and scratched and experimented within in various forms, and it just came into its own,” Lemmon said. “I knew it had to be Pop.”\n\nDuring an early staging at a theater in Chicago, Lemmon didn’t feel like he had the footing he wanted with the show.\n\n“But there was still something missing, and what that was was, ‘What does this all mean to Chris?’” he said. “I realized that literally 30,000 feet in the air. I was flying out to open two days later in Los Angeles. And I did the rewrite then, changed all the music around. I did a page-one rewrite and opened two days later.”\n\nThat’s when he said the show really came together.\n\n“We’ve been going 10 months straight since and we’re having a ball,” he said.\n\nPlayground enlightenment\n\nLemmon, 61, said he realized his father was famous when he was a kid.\n\nIn “A Twist of Lemmon,” he details that realization in the chapter called “Jack Lemmon’s Son.”\n\n“The one question I was asked most was, ‘How was it like being Jack Lemmon’s son?,’ which I said in the book was strange for any kid to answer,” he said.\n\nHe was attempting to do a pull-up in the school yard in fifth or sixth grade, and a kid came running up to him.\n\n“He said, ‘You see that kid over there? His father is more famous than your father because his father plays Jim West in “The Wild, Wild West,”’ Lemmon recalled. “I thought about it for a second and I said, ‘Sure, he’s more famous. He’s Jim West, isn’t he?’ And then, as the kid was running away, I thought to myself, ‘I didn’t know my father was famous. I thought he was just an actor.’”\n\nA relationship evolves\n\nLemmon said the nature of “A Twist of Lemmon” is about how their relationship grew over time.\n\n“Basically, we were father and son, but for a number of different reasons. He adored me and he was a wonderful father, but career always came first,” Lemmon said. “That was really true of a lot of actors back during that era, and it was true of him, self-admittingly. And for that — divorce, second marriage, the hammer lock of Hollywood, super fame — we were ripped apart. It’s really a deeply tragic story at its core. And we stayed that way for many years. But through a conscious decision on both our parts — his and mine — we chose to, for lack of a better word, take the high road and try to come back together.”\n\nTo repair and reinforce the relationship, Lemmon said his father created “a yearly adventure we would do together.” It started out with fly-fishing in Alaska.\n\n“In my late 20s, it was one of those weird things, we were looking at each other and saying, ‘You know, you’re a lot of fun to be with,’” he said. “So I thought maybe I’d take up golf because I knew how much he loved golf. I did. And we started playing golf together, and fortunately, my career started to take off, as well.”\n\nThe younger Lemmon was invited to the Pebble Beach (Calif.) Pro-Am Golf Tournament, where his father “struggled to make the cut and never did.”\n\n“We did a decade of that together. We had a ball together. Then, he got sick and passed away,” he said.\n\n“Twist of Lemmon” is really a love letter from Lemmon to his father.\n\n“It’s a deeply tragic story in its core, but it’s couched in this wonderful lore of the Golden Age of Hollywood, with all of these characters running around,” he said of the show. “All of the films that he did, I think I re-enact a dozen of them. The music — he loved music so much — so that’s an integral part.”\n\nAnd although Lemmon’s father was famous, “A Twist of Lemmon” is a story that is relatable to any parent-child relationship.\n\n“Even if you don’t know who these people I talk about are, it transcends it,” Lemmon said. “It’s unique in the aspect that it’s Jack and Chris Lemmon. But it’s a totally universal story. This could be about a coal miner and his son in Virginia or anywhere in the world. This is a universal story about a father and his son. We all have these things going on in our life. There is no such thing as a perfect relationship. It’s extremely identifiable in that aspect.”\n\nHe said it takes the audience a few minutes of watching the show to realize that’s really its heart, that it’s not an evening of him just telling stories and playing music.\n\n“This is a strictly scripted piece of theater, and that most perilous form of theater, the one-person show,” he said. “It’s sort of the circus high-wire act without any safety. Then, it dawns on them, ‘Oh, that’s what this is.’ It happens just about the same place, pretty much every show.”\n\nWhen it came to work, Lemmon said the most touching times he had with his father were connected to the stage. When his father came to see him in the original West Coast tour of “Barefoot in the Park,” Lemmon said his father was blown away.\n\nJack Lemmon felt that way again when Chris and Stephanie Zimbalist performed in “Love Letters.” Jack Lemmon later performed the same play.\n\nChris Lemmon said he performed at the Rubicon Theatre in Ventura, Calif., and over the dressing room was a photo of him and a photo of his father, who performed his last stage piece at the same theater.\n\n“I never really felt that I could point at something and I could say, ‘I did that,’ and I finally have,” he said. “To be able to bring all three things I like to do together — my acting, my writing and my music — and have them all under one roof. This is really my magnum opus. If they stick me in a pine box tomorrow, I can say, ‘I did that.’ My only regret in that department was gosh, I wish he was here to see it. But it wouldn’t have existed if he was still here.”\n\nA seat at the table\n\nLemmon, who is married and has two sons and a daughter, said fatherhood has taught him a lot about the show.\n\n“I made a knee-jerk reaction to my childhood and swore there would never be that empty chair at the end of the dinner table — the one where the father goes— for my children,” Lemmon said.\n\nSo Lemmon and his wife, Gina Raymond, decided to move the family to Glastonbury, Conn., where she grew up. Lemmon said he misses his friends, such as Andy Garcia, and knew he might be committing career suicide.\n\n“I’m proud to say, there was no divorce in my family. My wife and I are getting ready to celebrate our 29th anniversary,” he said. “And I’ve been here for every single meal. There wasn’t that empty chair at the dinner table for my three kids. Consequently, we had three kids who came up through the Glastonbury public-school system. All three of them are in college at the same time. This show better be a hit.”\n\nLemmon said he’s happy that he made family a priority.\n\n“You only get one shot,” he said.\n\nLemmon continues to be busy with other projects. He has a movie called “Aaron’s Light,” for which he is hoping to get funding. He intends to serve as director, producer and actor of the film, which deals with autism.\n\nHe said “A Twist of Lemmon” might be finding a home on a stage in New York or even London.\n\nWhen performing “Twist,” Lemmon said “every night is a joy.”\n\nHe said he hopes it will touch the audience.\n\n“I say it during my bows. Go to those people you love, hug them, tell them you love them because you don’t know what you got until it’s gone,” he said. “You might think you do, but trust me, you don’t. And that’s what this is all about. You can’t take with you the Ferraris, the Porsche, the big condos or the big Beverly Hills mansions. All you can take with you, if you’re lucky enough, is the memories and the love.”\n\nWHAT: \"A Twist of Lemmon\"\n\nWHEN: 3 p.m. Sunday, Nov. 22\n\nWhere: The Capitol Theatre, 159 S.
