        "text": "NEW YORK\n\n- President John F. Kennedy had just one critique when he saw photos of the actor set to play him in a World War II drama.\n\nThe year was 1963 and actor Cliff Robertson looked convincing in his costume for \"PT-109,\" the first film to portray a sitting president. Kennedy had favored Robertson for the role, but one detail was off.\n\nRobertson's hair was parted on the wrong side.\n\nThe actor dutifully trained his locks to part on the left and won praise for a role he'd remain proud of throughout his life.\n\nRobertson, who went on to win an Oscar for his portrayal of a mentally disabled man in \"Charly\", died of natural causes Saturday afternoon in Stony Brook, a day after his 88th birthday, according to Evelyn Christel, his secretary of 53 years.\n\nRobertson also gained attention for his second marriage to actress and heiress Dina Merrill, daughter of financier E.F. Hutton and Marjorie Merriweather Post, heiress to the Post cereal fortune and one of the world's richest women.\n\nHis triumph came in 1968 with his Academy Award performance in \"Charly,\" as a mentally disabled man who undergoes medical treatment that makes him a genius - until a poignant regression to his former state.\n\nRobertson had created a string of impressive performances in television and on Broadway, but always saw his role played in films by bigger names. His TV performances in \"Days of Wine and Roses\" and \"The Hustler,\" for example, were filmed with Jack Lemmon and Paul Newman, respectively. Robertson's role in Tennessee Williams' play \"Orpheus Descending\" was awarded to Marlon Brando in the movie.\n\nRobertson first appeared in the \"Charly\" story in a TV version, \"The Two Worlds of Charlie Gordon.\" Both were based on \"Flowers for Algernon,\" a short story that author Daniel Keyes later revised into a novel.\n\nIn 1977, Robertson made the headlines again, this time by blowing the whistle on a Hollywood financial scandal.\n\nHe had discovered that David Begelman, president of Columbia Pictures, had forged his signature on a $10,000 salary check, and he called the FBI and the Burbank and Beverly Hills police departments. Hollywood insiders were not happy with the ugly publicity.\n\nBegelman served time for embezzlement, but he returned to the film business. He committed suicide in 1995.\n\nRobertson said neither the studios nor the networks would hire him for four years.\n\nBorn Sept. 9, 1923, in La Jolla, Calif., Robertson was 2 when he was adopted by wealthy parents who named him Clifford Parker Robertson III. After his parents divorced and his mother died, he was reared by his maternal grandmother, whom he adored.\n\nRobertson studied briefly at Antioch College, majoring in journalism. Rejected by the services in World War II because of a weak eye, he served in the Merchant Marine.\n\nHe set his sights on New York theater, and like dozens of other future stars, profited from the advent of live television drama. Then he accepted a contract at Columbia Pictures.\n\nRobertson's first performance for Columbia, \"Picnic,\" was impressive, even though his screen pal, William Holden, stole the girl, Kim Novak. He followed with a tearjerker, \"Autumn Leaves,\" as Joan Crawford's young husband, then a musical, \"The Girl Most Likely\" with Jane Powell. In 1959, he endeared himself to \"Gidget\" fans as The Big Kahuna, the mature Malibu surf bum who takes Gidget under his wing.\n\nIn 1957, Robertson married Lemmon's ex-wife, Cynthia Stone, and they had a daughter, Stephanie, before splitting in 1960. In 1966, he married Merrill and they had a daughter, Heather. The couple divorced in 1989."
