        "text": "By Brett Johnson\n\nThe Rubicon Theatre Company in Ventura is, in the words of co-founder Karyl Lynn Burns, “making lemonade from Lemmons.”\n\nThe venerable and critically acclaimed Ventura company, now in its 17th season, pulled the 11th-hour plug on a scheduled production of “The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe.” That show was to star Rubicon regular Stephanie Zimbalist in the role that Lily Tomlin made famous, and was slated for a run that was to end March 29.\n\nBut that turned into what Burns called the “Mount Everest” of theater; the one-woman show features 11 different characters and some 600 different sound cues. Though they were working hard on it, time concerns weighed heavily against it.\n\n“We basically felt like it wasn’t ready yet,” explained Burns, who is also Rubicon’s producing artistic director. “We could only get to the top of Mount Whitney. And Stephanie has incredibly high standards.”\n\nSo now Burns and crew are turning to Lemmons, specifically the late actor Jack Lemmon and his son, Chris.\n\nChris will perform the one-man show “Jack Lemmon Returns,” described as an immensely personal and ultimately heartwarming look at his relationship with his two-time Oscar-winning father.\n\nIt is performed in a musical storytelling style with Chris often at the piano and sometimes standing onstage with a microphone, and is meant as a loving tribute told with respect and dignity. His performances, under the direction of Hershey Felder, will be accompanied by a montage of old photos, clips and the like.\n\n“I do a good Jack Lemmon,” Chris, whose physical resemblance to his dad has often been remarked upon, told the Los Angeles Daily News earlier this year. “But I really, honestly, don’t think it’s as much of an impersonation as it’s sort of a channeling thing. I really do feel, and hope, that he inhabits me for an hour-and-a-half onstage.”\n\n“Jack Lemmon Returns” opened Wednesday and will run through March 29, in basically the same “Search for Signs …” space on the Rubicon calendar. The only other time Rubicon shelved a production so close to an opening, Burns said, was in 2000 with “The Little Foxes,” when star Linda Purl pulled out for personal reasons.\n\nIn a way, it is a case of the elder Lemmon returning — the Rubicon, per Burns, is the site of his last stage performance. As the result of a chance seating next to Burns at a critics’ award show in Los Angeles years ago, Lemmon and his second wife, Felicia, agreed to do “Love Letters” at the Rubicon in 2000, in its second season.\n\n“He did it for us,” Burns recalled. “He knew at the time he had cancer. No one here knew he was sick. One time, there was three minutes in there onstage where he couldn’t speak; it was so emotional.”\n\nLemmon, one of the most beloved actors in Hollywood, died the next year. He was the star of such big films as “Some Like It Hot,” “The Apartment,” “Days of Wine and Roses,” “The China Syndrome,” “Save the Tiger” and “Mister Roberts.” Those last two were his Oscar wins; he was nominated eight times total.\n\nWhile he was here, Burns noted, Lemmon also helped christen the theater’s youth program and famously said, “I wish there were more Rubicons in this world.”\n\nChris Lemmon, his son from his marriage to actress Cynthia Stone, studied piano and played professionally, and also followed his famous father into acting. He appeared in three films with him — “Airport ’77,” “That’s Life!” and “Dad.”\n\nThough rife with warmth and laughs, “Jack Lemmon Returns” isn’t all fun. His father and Stone divorced when their son was 3 years old. Before marrying Felicia, the elder Lemmon led a bachelor lifestyle and had a drinking problem, per the storyline. Chris recalls that with all the good times.\n\n“I adored Dad, he really was my best friend,” he told The Daily News. “This is a story, in my humble opinion, that deserves to be told, a fairly tragic at its core father-son story that was unique yet, in very many ways, universal. There are going to be bumps in any road and it’s my duty as a storyteller to show those bumps as well. But there are no wire coat hangers in here; I have no bones to pick.”\n\nRefunds are available to those who purchased “Search for Signs …” tickets. They can also exchange them for “Jack Lemmon Returns” tickets, or get a voucher for another show later in the season."
