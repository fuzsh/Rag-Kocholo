        "text": "Clifford Parker Robertson III (September 9, 1923 – September 10, 2011) was an American actor with a film and television career that spanned half a century. Robertson portrayed a young John F. Kennedy in the 1963 film PT 109, and won the 1968 Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in the movie Charly. On television, he portrayed retired astronaut Buzz Aldrin in the 1976 adaptation of Aldrin's autobiographic Return to Earth, played a fictional character based on Director of Central Intelligence Richard Helms in the 1977 miniseries Washington: Behind Closed Doors, and portrayed Henry Ford in the 1987 Ford: The Man and the Machine. His last well-known film appearances were from 2002–2007 as Uncle Ben in the Spider-Man film trilogy.\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nRobertson was born in La Jolla, California ,[1][2][3]the son of Clifford Parker Robertson Jr. (1902–1968), and his first wife, Audrey Olga Robertson (née illingham; 1903–1925).[4][5] His Texas-born father was described as \"the idle heir to a tidy sum of ranching money\".[6] Robertson once said, \"[My father] was a very romantic figure – tall, handsome. He married four or five times, and between marriages he'd pop in to see me. He was a great raconteur, and he was always surrounded by psychopaths who let him pick up the tab. During the Great Depression, he tapped the trust for $500,000, and six months later he was back for more.\"[7]\n\nRobertson's parents divorced when he was one, and his mother died of peritonitis a year later in El Paso, Texas, at the age of 21.[1][7][8]He was raised by his maternal grandmother, Mary Eleanor \"Eleanora\" Willingham (néeSawyer, 1875–1957), in California, and rarely saw his father.[1][7][9] He graduated in 1941 from La Jolla High School,[10] where he was known as \"The Walking Phoenix\".[11]\n\nHe served in the U.S. Merchant Marine in World War II,[1] before attending Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, and dropping out to work as a journalist for a short time.[12][13]\n\nCareer[]\n\nRobertson studied at the Actors Studio, becoming a life member.[14] In the early 1950s he worked steadily on television, including a stint in the lead of Rod Brown of the Rocket Rangers (1953–54). He appeared in Broadway in Late Love (1953–54) and The Wisteria Tree(1955), the latter written by Joshua Logan.\n\nColumbia[]\n\nRobertson made his film debut in Picnic (1955), directed by Logan. Robertson played the role of William Holden's best friend - a part originated on stage by Paul Newman.\n\nThe film was a box office success and Robertson was promoted to Joan Crawford's co star in Autumn Leaves (1956), also at Columbia, playing her mentally unstable younger lover. This meant he had to pass up the chance to replace Ben Gazzara on Broadway in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.[15] However he did return to Broadway to appear in Orpheus Descending by Tennessee Williams, which only had a short run.\n\nRobertson went to RKO to make two movies: The Naked and the Dead (1958), an adaptation of the famous novel, co-starring Aldo Ray; and The Girl Most Likely (1958), a musical - the last film made by RKO Studios. Robertson received superb reviews for Days of Wine and Roses on TV with Piper Laurie.\n\nHe was in Columbia's Gidget (1959) appearing opposite Sandra Dee as the Big Kahuna. It was popular and led to two sequels, neither of which Robertson appeared in. Less successful was a war film at Columbia, Battle of the Coral Sea (1959).\n\nRobertson had better luck on TV, appearing in the excellent \"A Hundred Yards Over the Rim\" for The Twilight Zone. He was third lead in Paramount's All in a Night's Work (1961) and starred in Samuel Fuller's Underwater U.S.A. (1961) at Columbia.\n\nRobertson supported Esther Williams in The Big Show (1961). He had his first film hit since Gidget with Columbia's The Interns (1962). After supporting Debbie Reynolds in My Six Loves (1963), Robertson was President John F. Kennedy's personal choice to play him in 1963's PT 109.[16] The film was not a success at the box office.\n\nMore popular was Sunday in New York (1963), where Robertson supported Rod Taylor and Jane Fonda, and The Best Man where he was a ruthless presidential candidate.\n\nRobertson appeared in a popular war film 633 Squadron (1964) then supported Lana Turner in a melodrama, Love Has Many Faces (1965). In 1965 he said his contract with Columbia was for one film a year.[17]\n\nCharly[]\n\nFrustrated at the progress of his career, Robertson optioned the rights to a TV play he had appeared in, Flowers for Algernon. He hired William Goldman to write a script. Before Goldman completed his work, Robertson arranged for Goldman to be hired to Americanize the dialogue for Masquerade (1965), a spy spoof which Robertson starred in, replacing Rex Harrison.\n\nRobertson then made a war film, Up from the Beach (1965) for Fox and guest starred on that studio's TV show, Batman (1966). He co-starred with Harrison in The Honey Pot (1967) for Joseph Manckiewicz then was in another war movie, The Devil's Brigade (1968) with William Holden.\n\nRobertson disliked Goldman's Algernon script and replaced the writer with Stirling Silliphant for what became Charly (1968). The film was another box office success and Robertson won the 1968 Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of a mentally disabled man.\n\nStardom[]\n\nCharly was made by ABC Pictures who insisted Robert Aldrich use him in Too Late the Hero (1970), a war film with Michael Caine that disappointed at the box office.\n\nHe turned down roles in The Anderson Tapes, Straw Dogs (before Peckinpah was involved) and Dirty Harry.[18] Instead Robertson co-wrote, starred in and directed J. W. Coop (1972), another commercial disappointment despite excellent reviews.\n\nLooking back on his career he said \"nobody made more mediocre movies than I did. Nobody ever did such a wide variety of mediocrity.\"[18] In 1969, immediately after winning the Academy Award for Charly, Robertson, a lifelong aviation enthusiast, produced and directed an aviation film, “I Shot Down the Red Baron,” that featured World War one aerial combat, using Lynn Garrison’s Irish aviation facility. The comedic story-line portrayed the Red Baron as a gay guy. The aircraft featured garish paint schemes. The film was never completed, or released.\n\nHe was Cole Younger in The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid (1972) and played a pilot in Ace Eli and Rodger of the Skies (1973). He was in a thriller Man on a Swing (1974) and British drama Out of Season (1975).\n\nCareer decline[]\n\nRobertson returned to supporting parts in Three Days of the Condor (1975), a big hit. He did play the lead in Obsession (1976), a popular thriller from Brian De Palma and Paul Schrader, and Shoot (1976) a Canadian drama. He was one of several stars in Midway (1976).\n\nRobertson turned to television for Washington: Behind Closed Doors (1977) then had the lead in a thriller, Dominique (1978). He returned to directing for The Pilot (1980), also playing the title role, an alcoholic flyer. Robertson played Hugh Hefner in Star 80 (1980). He attempted to make Charly II in 1980 but it did not happen.[19]\n\nLater career[]\n\nFrom the 1980s onwards, Robertson was a predominantly character actor. He played villains in Class (1983) and Brainstorm (1983). He did have the lead in Shaker Run (1985) in New Zealand, and Dreams of Gold: The Mel Fisher Story (1986) on TV.\n\nFrom the 1980s onwards, Robertson was a predominantly character actor. He played villains in Class (1983) and Brainstorm (1983). He did have the lead in Shaker Run (1985) in New Zealand, and Dreams of Gold: The Mel Fisher Story (1986) on TV.\n\nHe was a villain in Malone (1987), did Dead Reckoning (1990) on TV and supported in Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken (1991), Wind (1991), Renaissance Man (1994) and John Carpenter's Escape from L.A. (1996).\n\nLate in his life Robertson's career had a resurgence. He appeared as Uncle Ben Parker in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man (2002), as well as in the sequels Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Spider-Man 3 (2007; his last acting role). He commented on his website: \"Since Spider-Man 1 and 2, I seem to have a whole new generation of fans. That in itself is a fine residual.\"[20] He also starred in and wrote 13th Child and appeared in the horror film Riding the Bullet (2004).\n\nIn 1989, he was a member of the jury at the 39th Berlin International Film Festival.[21]\n\nTelevision[]\n\nRobertson's early television appearances included a starring role in the live space opera Rod Brown of the Rocket Rangers (1953–1954), as well as recurring roles on Hallmark Hall of Fame (1952), Alcoa Theatre (1959), and Playhouse 90 (1958, 1960), The Outlaws (three episodes). Robertson also appeared as a special guest star on Wagon Train for one episode, portraying an Irish immigrant.\n\nIn 1958, Robertson portrayed Joe Clay in the first broadcast of Playhouse 90's Days of Wine and Roses (1958 TV drama) Days of Wine and Roses. In 1960, he was cast as Martinus Van Der Brig, a con man, in the episode \"End of a Dream\" of Riverboat.[22]\n\nOther appearances included, 1958 \"Wagon Train\", The Twilight Zone episodes \"A Hundred Yards Over the Rim\" (1961) and \"The Dummy\" (1962), followed by The Eleventh Hour in the 1963 episode, \"The Man Who Came Home Late\". He guest-starred on such television series as The Greatest Show on Earth, Breaking Point and ABC Stage 67. He had starring roles in episodes of both the 1960s and 1990s versions of The Outer Limits. He was awarded an Emmy for his leading role in a 1965 episode, \"The Game\" of Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre. He appeared twice as a guest-villain on ABC's Batman as the gunfighter \"Shame\" (1966 and 1968), the second time with his wife, Dina Merrill, as \"Calamity Jan\".\n\nIn 1976, he portrayed a retired Buzz Aldrin in an adaptation of Aldrin's autobiography Return to Earth. The next year, he portrayed a fictional Director of Central Intelligence (based on Richard Helms) in Washington: Behind Closed Doors, an adaptation of John Ehrlichman's roman a clef The Company, in turn based on the Watergate scandal. In 1987, he portrayed Henry Ford in Ford: The Man and The Machine. From 1983-84, he played Dr. Michael Ranson in Falcon Crest.\n\nYoung Eagles initiative[]\n\nA certified private pilot, he was a longtime member of the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA), working his way through the ranks in prominence and eventually co-founding the Young Eagles Program with EAA president Tom Poberezny. Robertson chaired the program from its 1992 inception to 1994 (succeeded by former test pilot Gen. Chuck Yeager). Along with educating youth around aviation, the initial goal of the Young Eagles was to fly one million children (many of them never having flown before) prior to the 100th Anniversary of Flight celebration on December 17, 2003. That goal was achieved on November 13, 2003. On July 28, 2016, the two millionth Young Eagle was flown by actor Harrison Ford.[23]\n\nColumbia Pictures scandal[]\n\nIn 1977, Robertson discovered that his signature had been forged on a $10,000 check payable to him, although it was for work he had not performed. He also learned that the forgery had been carried out by Columbia Pictures head David Begelman, and on reporting it he inadvertently triggered one of the biggest Hollywood scandals of the 1970s.[24] Begelman was charged with embezzlement, convicted, and later fired from Columbia. Despite pressure to remain quiet, Robertson and his wife Dina Merrill spoke to the press. As a result, Hollywood producers blacklisted him.[25]\n\nHe finally returned to studio film five years later, starring in Brainstorm (1983).[13][26] The story of the scandal is told in David McClintick's 1982 bestseller Indecent Exposure.\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nIn 1957, Robertson married actress Cynthia Stone, the former wife of actor Jack Lemmon. They had a daughter, Stephanie, before divorcing in 1959; he also had a stepson by this marriage, Chris Lemmon. In 1966, he married actress and Post Cereals heiress Dina Merrill, the former wife of Stanley M. Rumbough Jr.; they had a daughter, Heather (1969–2007), before divorcing.[1] By this marriage, he also had stepchildren Stanley Hutton Rumbough, David Post Rumbough, and Nedenia Colgate Rumbough. He resided in Water Mill, New York.[27]\n\nRobertson was a Democrat and supported Arizona congressman Morris K. Udall during the 1976 Democratic presidential primaries[28].\n\nAviation[]\n\nOne of Robertson's main hobbies was flying and, among other aircraft, he owned several de Havilland Tiger Moths, a Messerschmitt Bf 108, and a genuine World War II - era Mk.IX Supermarine Spitfire MK923.[29][30] His first plane ride was in a Lockheed Model 9 Orion. As a 13-year-old he would clean hangars for airplane rides. He met Paul Mantz, Art Scholl, and Charles Lindbergh while flying at local California airports.[31] His piloting skills helped him get the part as the squadron leader in the British war film 633 Squadron. He entered balloon races, including one in 1964 from the mainland to Catalina Island that ended with him being rescued from the Pacific Ocean.\n\nIn 1969, during the civil war conflict in Nigeria, Robertson helped organize an effort to fly food and medical supplies into the area. He also organized flights of supplies to the ravaged country of Ethiopia when it experienced famine in 1978.[29] Within the EAA, he founded the Cliff Robertson Work Experience in 1993, which offers youths the chance to work for flight and ground school instruction.[32]\n\nRobertson was flying a private Beechcraft Baron over New York City on the morning of September 11, 2001. He was directly above the World Trade Center climbing through 7,500 feet when the first Boeing 767 struck. He was instructed by air traffic control to land immediately at the nearest airport after a nationwide order to ground all civilian and commercial aircraft following the attacks.[33]\n\nDeath[]\n\nOn September 10, 2011, one day after his 88th birthday, Robertson died of natural causes in Stony Brook, New York.[34][35] His body was cremated, and a private funeral was held at St. Luke's Episcopal Church in East Hampton, New York.[36]\n\nGallery[]\n\nFilmography[]\n\nYear Film Role Notes 1955 Picnic Alan Benson 1956 Autumn Leaves Burt Hanson 1959 Gidget The Big Kahuna Battle of the Coral Sea Lt.
