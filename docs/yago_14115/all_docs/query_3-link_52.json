        "text": "Despite her Welsh background and fairytale life, the late Princess Lilian of Sweden was not a household name in the UK. She was also not the first commoner to marry royalty. The BBC looks at others, including the Duchess of Cambridge.\n\nFor centuries, royal families had sought \"equal marriages\" for the monarch and those in the line of succession but now it is not so unusual for princes and princesses to marry commoners.\n\nBorn Lilian Davies in Swansea in August 1915, the model was already married when she met Prince Bertil of Sweden in London in 1943. The couple fell in love but due to objections from the prince's father they only married 30 years later.\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge is now one of the most famous commoners to become part of a monarchy.\n\nThere was vast media interest in the duchess's background prior to her 2011 wedding to Prince William, second in line to the British throne.\n\nThe duchess had a distinctly middle-class background - she grew up in Bucklebury, in Berkshire, where her parents, Michael and Carole Middleton, run a mail-order business selling toys and games for children's parties. Her parents met while they were working for British Airways - he was a flight dispatcher and she was an air stewardess.\n\nThe eldest of three children, the duchess was educated at the exclusive Marlborough College in Wiltshire. She met Prince William while they were studying at St Andrews University in Fife.\n\nThe royal couple met in a Sydney bar - The Slip Inn - during the 2000 Summer Olympics. At the time, Australian Ms Donaldson was unaware of his royal status as heir to the throne.\n\nThey were married in May 2004 and have four children.\n\nBefore she became Crown Princess of Denmark, Ms Donaldson was an advertising executive-turned-estate agent.\n\nTasmania-born Ms Donaldson is the youngest daughter of John Donaldson, a maths professor and Henrietta Donaldson, who died in 1997. Her stepmother is British author Susan Moody, the principal nom de plume of Susan Elizabeth Horwood.\n\nWhen Letizia Ortiz Rocasolano married Prince Felipe in 2004, she become the first commoner in Spanish history to be in line to become queen.\n\nShe was a well-known TV presenter and the pair met when she was covering an oil slick along the Galicia shoreline in 2002.\n\nShe had worked as a journalist for ABC newspaper, the state news agency EFE and local channel CNN+.\n\nThey have two daughters together. She had been married previously but Spain's Catholic Church did not oppose her wedding to Prince Felipe because her first wedding was not held in a church.\n\nCrown Princess Victoria, heir to the throne, married her former fitness trainer Daniel Westling in 2010. Gym owner Mr Westling, now known as Prince Daniel, first met the princess in 2001.\n\nThey announced their engagement eight years later and they were married in 2010. The couple's daughter Estelle, second in line to the throne after her mother, was born in February 2012.\n\nOlof Daniel Westling grew up in a middle-class family in the village of Ockelbo in central Sweden. His mother worked as a clerk at the Swedish post office and his father was a manager at a municipal social services centre.\n\nQueen Rania of Jordan is one of the most visible first ladies in the Arab world, known for her glamour and charitable causes.\n\nShe met her future husband, who was a prince at that time, at a dinner party in January 1993.\n\nTwo months later, they announced their engagement. They now have four children.\n\nBefore her marriage, Queen Rania earned a degree in business administration from the American University in Cairo and worked for Citibank and Apple.\n\nA doctor's daughter, she was born in Kuwait in 1970 to a family of Palestinian origin.\n\nMichiko Shoda, the daughter of a prominent industrial and academic family, was the first commoner to marry into the Japanese imperial family in modern times.\n\nCrown Prince Akihito broke another tradition by choosing his bride himself.\n\nMs Shoda met the then heir to the throne at a tennis match in the summer of 1957. They married two years later and have three children.\n\nAn English Literature graduate, she also attended courses at Harvard and Oxford.\n\nHer husband ascended to the throne after the death of his father in 1989."
