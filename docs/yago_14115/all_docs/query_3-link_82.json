        "text": "By:Jaclyn Roth\n\nMarch 26 2021, Updated 1:40 p.m. ET\n\nAnd baby makes five! Princess Sofia of Sweden and her husband, Prince Carl Philip, have welcomed their third child — a baby boy on March 26.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nAccording to the Swedish Royal Court, the baby boy — whose name hasn't been revealed — was born at 11:19 a.m. at Danderyd Hospital in Stockholm, weighing in at 3220 grams and measured at 49 centimeters long.\n\nPrince Carl Philip was also present throughout the birth.\n\n\"We are so happy and grateful to be able to welcome our third son to our family. Princess Sofia and I, and his two big brothers, have all been longing for this day. And now we are looking forward to getting to know this new little member of our family,\" the dad-of-three — who shares Prince Alexander, 4, and Prince Gabriel, 3, with his wife — said in a statement.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nThe young tot will be seventh in line to the Swedish throne and the eighth grandchild for King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nIn December 2020, the couple shared the exciting news via Instagram. \"We are happy and excited and look forward to welcoming our third child,\" they captioned a black-and-white photo of themselves. \"A new little member of our family.\"\n\nFROM CHRISTMAS SERVICES TO TROOPING THE COLOUR: HOW THE ROYALS CELEBRATE THEIR INTRIGUING FAMILY TRADITIONS\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nThe pair have had a busy few months. In November 2020, they revealed they tested positive for COVID-19. \"They feel relatively well under the circumstances,\" Margareta Thorgren, the Royal Court’s Director of the Information and Press Department, said at the time.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nFortunately, they have since recovered and are now focused on spending time with their new bundle of joy.\n\nHowever, their new addition to the family will not have a proper title, since King Carl XVI Gustaf stripped his children of their HRH titles.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nHOME SWEET HOME! FROM BUCKINGHAM PALACE TO WINDSOR CASTLE — SEE MAGNIFICENT PHOTOS OF THE BRITISH ROYAL RESIDENCES\n\n\"His Majesty The King has decided on changes to The Royal House. The purpose of these changes is to establish which members of The Royal Family may be expected to perform official duties incumbent on the Head of State or related to the function of the Head of State,\" a statement from the palace, which was released in October 2019, read. \"His Majesty The King has decided that the children of Their Royal Highnesses Prince Carl Philip and Princess Sofia, and the children of Her Royal Highness Princess Madeleine and Mr. Christopher O'Neill will no longer be members of The Royal House.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nThe duo's youngest son will have the title of Prince, but his future spouse or children will not have a right to titles.\n\nThe baby will have the title of Prince, but the title is personal and any future spouses or children will not have a right to titles.\n\n\"Today, the King announced the decision that our children no longer hold the Royal Highness position. We see this as positive as Alexander and Gabriel will have freer choices in life,\" Prince Carl Philip wrote about the decision. \"They will retain their prince titles and their duchies, Södermanland and Dalarna, which we value and are proud of. Our family has strong connections to both landscapes and we maintain our commitment there.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Zara and Mike Tindall also welcomed their third child — a baby boy. Meanwhile, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are expecting their second child, a girl, who is due over the summer."
