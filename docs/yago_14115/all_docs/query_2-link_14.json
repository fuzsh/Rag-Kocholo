        "text": "Prince Axel was the second son of Prince Valdemar of Denmark and his wife, Princess Marie d’Orléans. Prince Axel became a military man, serving in the Navy, reaching Admiral in 1958, but also prospered as Chairman of the Board of the East Asiatic Company. He was extremely interested in flying, serving as director of SAS Airlines from 1946-58. During World War II he was known for his support of the Danish Underground Movement.\n\nPrince Axel became an IOC Member in March 1932 and served until May 1958. He was a member of the Executive Board from 1952-56. He missed only 6 of 25 IOC Sessions during his tenure and is best remembered for his role at the 1958 Tokyo Session in which he proposed that the Samaras Hymn should become the official hymn of the IOC, which it did. In 1963 Prince Axel was given the Olympic Diploma of Merit."
