        "text": "COPENHAGEN, Denmark, July 14 (AP) — Prince Axel of Denmark, an international businessman and a second cousin of King Frederik IX, died in a hospital here tonight. He was 75 years old.\n\nUntil retirement a few years ago Prince Axel was chairman of the board of the East Asiatic Company, a mammoth trading, shipping and industrial trust.\n\nPrince Axel played an active role in his country's life, first as skipper of one of the largest Danish liners and later as honorary board chairman of the Scandinavian Airlines System.\n\nEn route to the United States on one of his many visits to this country, he narrowly escaped death from drownig in a storm.\n\nIn September, 1918, the Prince and Franklin D. Roosevelt, then Assistant Secretary of the Navy, were on a British destroyer bound from Plymouth, England, to Brest, France, where they were to board a liner for the United States.\n\nA huge wave almost washed Mr. Roosevelt overboard, and when he recovered he found no sign of the Prince, who was finally discovered at the bottom of the after‐hatchway, under a load of crockery. A sailor who had been standing beside him was washed overboard and lost.\n\nThe Prince, one of the early fliers in his country, was keenly interested in sports. He pioneered motor sports in Denmark and headed the Royal Danish Automobile Club for 18 years.\n\nIn November, 1954, Prince Axel was on board a Scandinavian Airlines DC‐6B that flew from Copenhagen to Los Angeles over the Great Circle Arctic route on the first scheduled commercial flight across the polar regions. Another plane of the same line took off simultaneously, flying eastbound to Denmark over the same route.\n\nDuring the 1920's the Prince served as master of the 7,000ton Danish motorship Asia of the East Asiatic Company line. He later held the rank of admiral."
