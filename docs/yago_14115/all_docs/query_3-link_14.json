        "text": "Adrian. This strong name goes back centuries and is derived from the name of Roman emperor Hadrian, who had his army build a huge wall in Britain. The name has also been held by many popes.\n\nAlbert. Albert, meaning noble and bright, has been a prevalent name in many royal families. The name became popular more widely in the 19th century possibly because it was the name of Prince Albert, Queen Victoriaâs husband.\n\nAlexander. This is a royal name with lots of heritage. For example, this powerful royal name is shared by historical rulers such as Alexander the Great.\n\nAndrew. Many saints and Hungarian kings have held this name, which means manly in Greek. Andrew was one of the names of the British sovereign Edward VIII, (later called Prince Edward, Duke of Windsor, after his abdication) whose full name was Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David.\n\nArchie. Based on the German name Archibald, which is a combination of words meaning genuine and bold, this name has been used by many British noblemen.\n\nArthur. While itâs not certain whether King Arthur was a real person or simply a legend, the name Arthur certainly has a warrior-king ring to it.\n\nAugustus. Augustus was the first emperor of the Roman Empire and succeeded Julius Caesar. Three kings of Poland also had this powerful name, which means exalted in Latin.\n\nCarl. With German origins, the name Carl means free man. Many kings of Sweden have held this name. The English variant Charles is also a popular royal name, as is the Spanish variant of the name, Carlos.\n\nCharles. For a classic royal name why not take inspiration from a very popular and noble name like Charles. Two English kings held this name, which derives from the Germanic name Carl.\n\nChristian. Among the Danes, 10 kings have held this name, which is not only a royal favorite for boys but also a popular choice for baby girls, making it an appealing unisex name.\n\nChristopher. From a Greek name that means bearing Christ, Christopher has been the name of three kings of Denmark. It was also a very popular name in England, Wales, and the United States in the 20th century.\n\nDavid. The Hebrew name David means beloved and was the name of the second king of ancient Israel, who famously defeated Goliath as recounted in the Old Testament. Two Scottish kings also held this name, which was popular in Great Britain throughout the Middle Ages. The name still ranks as one of the most popular boy names in many countries.\n\nEdward. This name has been a classic throughout the history of English royals. In fact, eight English kings have held this name, which means rich guard.\n\nFelipe. Spainâs royal family has a lot of elegance and class, and this Spanish form of the name Philip has been used by six Spanish kings.\n\nFrederik. For a distinctly Danish royal name, you could go for Frederik, which means peaceful ruler. Nine kings of Denmark have held this name, as have kings of Sweden, Prussia, and Austria.\n\nGeorge. A name used quite often in the British royal family, George is of Greek origin and means farmer. Six kings of the United Kingdom have held the name George, which continues to be a popular royal baby name in several countries.\n\nHenry. Eight kings of England, seven kings of Germany, and four kings of France have held the name Henry, which means home ruler in German. The noble name has maintained its popularity over the years.\n\nJames. The most well-known James in royal circles is probably King James VI and I. He was originally the king of Scotland, but later became the first King of England and Ireland as well, forming the kingdom of Great Britain. If that isnât enough, he also authorized a famous translation of the Bible.\n\nJohn. The biblical name John has Latin, Greek, and Hebrew roots and means Yahweh (God) is gracious. Byzantine emperors were the first to popularize this name, after which it spread throughout the world with local variations.\n\nLeopold. In German, this name means people and bold, and this name was common among the royal houses of the Babenbergs and the Habsburgs. Two Holy Roman emperors bore this name as well, as did Queen Victoriaâs uncle, who was also the king of Belgium. Leopold easily shortens to Leo, which in Latin means lion.\n\nLouis. If youâre a Francophile at heart, why not consider Louis? The most famous Louis is probably King Louis XVI of France, who was the last king of France before the French Revolution ended Franceâs monarchy.\n\nMalcolm. If you are looking for a strong, unique, but less common royal name, consider Malcolm, which belonged to four kings of Scotland including the king who murdered Macbeth. Shakespeareâs tragic play is based on this legendary story.\n\nMichael. This Hebrew name continues to be a classic boyâs royal name that never seems to go out of style. Byzantine emperors as well as rulers of Russia, Romania, Portugal, and Poland have held this name over the years.\n\nMuhammad. In Arabic this name means praised or commendable. It was the name of the Prophet Muhammad, who founded the Islamic religion. Sultans of the Ottoman Empire and many African kings have held this dignified name.\n\nNicholas. Looking for some Russian royal inspiration? Consider the name Nicholas. It was the name of the last tsar of Russia, Nicholas II. The name means victory of the people.\n\nPhilip. Kings of Macedon, France, and Spain have held this traditional name, which means lover of horses in Greek.\n\nRichard. If you hope your son will have the heart of a lion, pick Richard as a name, after King Richard I of England, who was also known as Lion Heart. This is a strong royal name that means brave ruler.\n\nStephen. From the Greek word for crown or wreath, Stephen is a strong name that has been the moniker of multiple kings of England, Serbia, and Poland, among others. King Stephen was also the Hungarian nationâs first Christian king.\n\nUmberto. This elegant and dignified name is the Italian version of the name Humbert, which means bright warrior. Two kings of Italy have held this name, including the last reigning king of Italy before the monarchy was abolished in 1946.\n\nWilliam. This name means strong-willed warrior. If you want your son to have a royal name that has traditional roots yet also has a modern flavor, this could be the right choice for you. The name belonged to four previous kings of England.\n\nAlexandra. This is the feminine form of Alexander, and itâs a popular name that has charm and royal links in its own right. Danish, Russian, and Greek royals, including queens, princesses, and duchesses, have held this name.\n\nAlice. This name is the Old French short form for Adelaide, which means noble and kind. Many princesses have had this name, including Princess Alice of Battenburg, the mother of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. In Victorian times, the name became popular after Lewis Carrollâs Alice in Wonderland was published.\n\nAmina. Amina, also spelled Aminah, was the name of a 16th-century Nigerian princess who was known for her bravery and military prowess. Amina means safe one in Arabic. Amina was also the name of the Prophet Muhammadâs mother.\n\nAnastasia. This exquisite name of Greek origin means resurrection, and it famously belonged to the youngest daughter of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia.\n\nAnne. A simple and classic name that quite often makes top lists for baby girl names, Anne is a name that means gracious and merciful. Itâs quite a popular royal baby name, and itâs been used by queens of England, Denmark, Austria, and Greece.\n\nAstrid. From the Old Norse word for god and fair, Astrid has roots dating back to the time of Vikings. Queens of Sweden and Norway have held this regal name, so itâs a great choice if you would like a name with a Scandinavian ring to it.\n\nBeatrice. As the name of a twice queen of Hungary by marriage to King Matthias and later to Vladislaus II, Beatrice was known for introducing the Italian renaissance to Hungary. A name for those who always want to smile, Beatrice means bringer of joy.\n\nCaroline. Originating from the male name Charles, Caroline is a name with royal links to England, Italy, and Monaco.\n\nCatherine. Take inspiration from one of historyâs most famous monarchs, Catherine the Great, by picking this name. Although Catherine was born with the name Sophie, upon her conversion to the Orthodox religion, she took the name Catherine.\n\nCharlotte. Charlotte has been the name of countesses, princesses, and queens, including a queen of Jerusalem and Armenia, and a queen of Great Britain and Ireland. A diminutive of Charles, the name can be shortened to Lottie or Carlotta.\n\nChristina. The Latin female form of Christian, Christina has been the name of a saint as well as a Swedish queen who famously gave up her royal crown in order to convert to Roman Catholicism. Danish, Dutch, and Austrian princesses have also had this noble name.\n\nDiana. If you want your baby girl to have a name inspired by the peopleâs princess, pick Diana, a name that means divine. Diana, Princess of Wales, was the first wife of Charles, Prince of Wales, and is the mother of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex.\n\nElizabeth. This is the ultimate royal baby girl name, which in Hebrew means my God is abundant. Saints, empresses, and queens have had this name, including Empress Elisabeth of Austria and Queen Elizabeth I of England.\n\nGrace. For a royal name with a touch of old-world Hollywood charm, look no further than Grace. Grace Kelly transitioned from movie star to royal when she married Rainier III, Prince of Monaco, and became the Princess Consort of Monaco.\n\nHelena. The Latinized version of the Greek name Helene, which means torch, has been used by many Roman empresses as well as princesses. The regal name is prominent in Greek mythology, as the kidnapping of Helen of Troy led to the infamous Trojan War.\n\nIndira. This Sanskrit name means either beauty or splendid. Indira was the name of the Maharani (queen) of Cooch Behar and former princess of Baroda (a city presently known as Vadodara), who was well-known for her social grace, beauty, and worldliness.\n\nIsabella. Two Spanish queens, one of whom was responsible for financing Columbusâ journey, have borne this Latin variant of Elizabeth.
