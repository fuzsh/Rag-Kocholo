He has one daughter Madeleine Kogevinas. He is the grandfather of her four Ullens de Schooten children : Marie-Christine, Jean, Astrid, Sophie and her youngest Désirée Kogevinas.

So I´m quite sure one or more grandchildren of the swedish king would get one or more of these names. But I also see a trend among the young Royals to name their children a little bit less traditional...I doubt that the first son of Victoria will be named \"Carl\" or the first son of cp Frederik and cp Mary \"Christian\" or \"Frederik\". But I´m quite sure that they will/would have a traditonal part in the whole name of the child.\n\nMy guess was that cp Victoria would have named her daughter \"Ingrid\"...maybe the same thing with Frederik´s daughter (as tribute to the wonderul queen Ingrid)...but there´s already one princess \"Ingrid\" in this future reigning-generation...wonder if Victoria and Frederik were a little bit disappointed (?)\n\nNJRedDevils\n\nAristocracy\n\nJoined\n\nMay 22, 2004\n\nMessages\n\n130\n\nCity\n\nWPB\n\nCountry\n\nAustralia\n\nThanks Lena.. I was just wondering if Swedish Royals followed the tradition naming of their kids like other Royals follow.\n\nwhat i meant by heir is there children not actually to the throne... But Madeleine will be my Queen..."
