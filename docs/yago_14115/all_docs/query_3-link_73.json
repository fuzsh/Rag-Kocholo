        "text": "Female commoners, may I have your attention. Former reality star and saucy model Sofia Hellqvist has done the impossible by marrying an adorable Swedish Prince.\n\nTell your mother to forget about the doctors, lawyers and hedge fund jamokes. Your expectations just underwent a major upgrade, and now you won’t consider any man who doesn’t come with a title.\n\nHellqvist – who starred in the 2005 Swedish reality show, Paradise Hotel, posed for Slitz magazine, and reportedly made out with Jenna Jameson – met Prince Carl Philip at a club in 2010, and five years later they married inside the Chapel at Stockholm’s royal palace.\n\nUpon her marriage to Sweden’s third-in-line to the throne, Hellqvist became Her Royal Highness Princess Sofia of Sweden, Duchess of Värmland.\n\nThe wedding attendees included Carl Philip’s family – his parents, King Carl XVI Gustaf, Queen Silvia, and his two sisters – Crown Princess Victoria and her husband, Prince Daniel, and Princess Madeleine and her husband, Chris O’Neill, as well as their daughter, Princess Leonore, 16 months.\n\nVictoria and Daniel’s daughter, Princess Estelle, 3, served as a flower girl.\n\nOther guests included Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, Queen Margrethe of Denmark, Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit of Norway, The Earl and Countess of Wessex, Queen Maxima of the Netherlands, Queen Mathilde of Belgium, Princess Birgitta of Sweden, Princess Margaretha of Sweden, Princess Maria Christina of the Netherlands, Princess Takamado of Japan, Queen Sonja of Norway, Prince Joachim of Denmark, Princess Marie of Denmark, as well as members of Sofia’s family.\n\nQueen Maxima wore the Mellerio Ruby Parure to the ceremony.\n\nAccording to HRH Countess of Wessex blog, Sophie wore a gown by Czech designer, Taťána Kovaříková, gifted to Her Royal Highness during an official visit to Prague. Sophie wore what royal watchers have come to recognize as the Aquamarine Tiara, though to be made by royal jewelers Collins & Sons.\n\nThe ceremony was a mix of touching emotion and humor, when Carl Philip encountered the same problem as Prince William when trying to fit Sofia’s wedding band on her ring finger.\n\nSofia’s dressed was designed by Ida Sjöstedt, and the diamond and emerald tiara was a gift from her in-laws, the King and Queen of Sweden.\n\n<\n\nOne isn’t sure if there has ever been a tattoo visible on a royal bride, but there’s a first time for everything.\n\nThe palace later released official weddings photos:"
