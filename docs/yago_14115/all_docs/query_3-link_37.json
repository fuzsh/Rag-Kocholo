        "text": "(CBS/AP) Sweden's newborn princess, daughter of the Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel, and future monarch officially has a name: Estelle Silvia Ewa Mary.\n\nKing Carl XVI Gustaf announced his granddaughter's name, and said the baby girl, who was born Thursday, will receive the title Duchess of Ostergotland, a province in southeast Sweden.\n\nPictures: Sweden welcomes newborn princess\n\nPictures: Crown Princess Victoria\n\nAs Victoria's first-born child, she is second in line to the throne.\n\nEstelle, a name of French origin, is unusual in Sweden and took royal watchers by surprise, though it isn't unprecedented in the royal family, which has French roots. Estelle was the name of the American-born wife of the king's godfather, Count Folke Bernadotte, a U.N. mediator in the Israeli-Arab conflict who was assassinated in Jerusalem in 1948.\n\nSilvia is the name of Victoria's mother and Ewa is Daniel's mother's name.\n\nMary is not common in the Swedish royal family, but it's the name of Denmark's Australian-born crown princess.\n\nThe king didn't explain the reasoning behind the names.\n\n\"We have now been given a little Princess Estelle in Sweden and we are all, particularly me and the family, very, very happy and joyful for that,\" he said.\n\nVictoria and Daniel returned to their lakeside palace Thursday."
