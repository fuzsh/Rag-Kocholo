        "text": "As a continuation of my last post, Doing Business in The Middle East, I want to share a few other points to consider when working or engaging in a social setting with members of royalty in the Middle East. In this comprehensive caste system, it's important to be conscious of protocol one must follow while interacting with these royal family members.\n\nAt the Islamic Museum in Doha, Qatar during the welcome reception for Prince Charles with Sheikha Mayassa Al Thani, the daughter of the Amir, \"the father\"and Sheikha Moza of Qatar.\n\nAddressing Royals\n\nIn this region, there are many variations of royals between Sheiks, Sheikah's, Sultans, Kings, Princes and Princesses, and Amirs. Understanding this hierarchy is key when doing business\n\nIn the region. These royal families are vast in numbers. As an example, The House of Saud, the ruling family of Saudi Arabia, has thousands of members. It's helpful to understand the family trees, ranking, last names, tribe and region in which they reside. This can be quite confusing and takes time to understand -- not to mention, mastering the correct pronunciation of each name.\n\nIt's considered honorable when you personally take time to learn about these families and their history in the region. Regardless of your stance in this caste system, respect and proper use of terms is good for business.\n\nA Simple Guide\n\nA Sultan, such as the Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said of Oman is addressed as, \"Your Majesty\".\n\nA Prince is addressed as \"Your Royal Highness\" followed by his [position in government if he has one] followed by his name. Same for a Princess. Any child or male line grandchild of a monarch is considered a Prince or Princess. The spouse of a Prince is also a Princess, although she is not always \"Princess\" addressed as that, followed by Her First Name. The spouse of a princess is not always a prince.\n\nA Crown Prince (for which one is not determined in places like Oman) is \"Your Royal Highness\". There are exceptions, but in general you can distinguish between those who are royal and those who are not in Middle eastern Royalty simply by the letter preceding their name: H.H.: His Highness - i.e. he is royal. H.E.: His excellency - i.e. he is or has been a senior government appointee (like an ambassador or government minister, though often they can also be royals).\n\nSenior Government Minister: \"Your Excellency\".\n\nAn Ambassador: \"Your Excellency\"\n\nAll other Embassy staff of import: \"Counsellor\" followed by their name and office for formal written address [just not in the post address!], but usually Ms., Mrs., Mr... in person.\n\nSheikh (if not a government minister, ambassador, or prince): \"Sheikh\" followed by name. Is H.H or H.E than that would precede \"Sheikh\" than name.\n\nSheikha (if not a government minister, ambassador, or princess): \"Sheikha\" followed by name. If her husband is H.H than she would be addressed as \"Her Highness, Sheikha...\" followed by name. If her husband is H.E it doesn't carry to her.\n\nAlso, a Moroccan royal term of import of respect for a lady of respected family is \"Lalla\" which follows their titles. For example, \"Princess Lalla ...[name: Salma] of Morocco\".\n\nA Prime Minister is \"Your Excellency\" in most cases, while a former Prime Minister is \"Mr. [name] , the former President of [country].\" Some countries, Prime Ministers are awarded additional status, i.e. the UK, so the UK president, for life, will be \"Your Honorable\".\n\nAnd there is a special exception for the King of Saudi Arabia who has (self-bestowed) religious title instead of the usual Kingly greeting. He is called \"The Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques\".\n\nWhile engaging in business in this region, it's good to do your research and always show respect for the culture and history. It's actually quite fascinating."
