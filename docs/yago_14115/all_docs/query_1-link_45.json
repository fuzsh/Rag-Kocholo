        "text": "Prince Carl Bernadotte, who has died in Malaga aged 92, was once a contender for the hand of Princess Juliana (later Queen Juliana) of the Netherlands; later he pursued progressively less exalted consorts, marrying respectively an aristocrat, a builder's daughter and, finally, a domestic.\n\nA minor member of the Swedish Royal Family, he was nevertheless a grandson of the Kings of Sweden and Denmark, and an uncle to the Kings of Norway and Belgium. At birth he was fifth in line to the Swedish throne.\n\nA regular attender at Scandinavian royal weddings and funerals for many decades, Prince Carl's round face was to be seen peering out of every group photograph. At these occasions he wore the appropriate order (the Seraphim in Sweden, the Elephant in Denmark, and so on) and wandered about taking notes, which he sometimes published afterwards.\n\nAfter school, Carl learned Esperanto, and gained a degree in business. He served as an officer in two cavalry regiments, and was created Duke of Ostergotland, then began work as a clerk in a Swedish insurance company. There were the traditional princely incidents of motor accidents following erratic driving, and ensuing court fines. In 1933 he undertook a round-the-world voyage, during which one of his ports of call was the Netherlands.\n\nThe following year it was suggested that he might marry Princess Juliana, heir to the Dutch throne, partly due to a dearth of suitable Protestant princes not directly destined for a throne of their own.\n\nIn 1937 Prince Carl fell into disfavour with his uncle, King Gustav V, by taking as his bride a divorcee, the daughter of Count Eugene von Rosen, Master of Ceremonies at the Swedish Court. Countess Elsa von Rosen was some seven years his senior and already the mother of three children - her first husband was her cousin, Count Adolf von Rosen. She married Carl at Kvillinge Church, Friedem, on July 6 1937, in a ceremony attended by his parents and the Crown Princes and Crown Princesses of both Sweden and Norway - but not by King Gustav.\n\nThe laws surrounding marriage in the Royal House of Sweden were strict - and somewhat ironic, since the family descends from Jean Baptiste Bernadotte, a Gascon sergeant who became one of Napoleon's marshals and had taken the throne as recently as 1818. Several members of Carl's family - an uncle, a cousin and one of the sons of the future King Gustav VI Adolf, Prince Sigvard - had had to renounce their right to the throne because they married commoners.\n\nPrince Carl had to do the same, although the blow was lightened when he was created Prince Bernadotte by his widowed brother-in-law, King Leopold III of the Belgians. Carl and Elsa continued to live in Stockholm and had one daughter, Madeleine. They were to divorce in 1951.\n\nMeanwhile, the Prince acted as a trade ambassador in the Belgian Congo, taking time off to watch young elephants being hunted for zoos and the circus ring. In the 1940s and 1950s he acquired a reputation as a playboy, and was part of the Aristotle Onassis set.\n\nIn 1954 Prince Carl married Ann Larsson, 10 years his junior and the daughter of a successful Stockholm builder. Then, in 1957, there occurred a scandal known as \"The Huseby affair\". A rich spinster called Florence Stephens owned the large estate of Huseby at Smaland, in southern Sweden, and was said to be an illegitimate daughter of Oscar II. She took a liking to her putative nephew, Carl, and alerted him to her intention of bequeathing him Huseby.\n\nCarl set about ingratiating himself with the factor, a former horse coper called Berl Guttenberg. It emerged that the factor was embezzling money from Florence Stephens, and, following a police investigation, both he and Carl were put on trial. The factor was convicted, and, although Carl was acquitted, his name was so blackened in the Swedish press that he left Sweden for ever, settling in Spain. (Florence Stephens lived until 1979, and bequeathed her estate to the Swedish nation.)\n\nFollowing his divorce from Ann in 1961, Carl began a relationship with Kristine Rivelsrud, the daughter of an agricultural worker. Twenty-one years his junior, she was employed in a domestic capacity by his niece, Princess Ragnhild of Norway, and the Prince met her when he was a house guest. They married in 1978, in the Swedish Embassy at Rabat, Morocco, and lived latterly at the Villa Capricorno, overlooking the bay of Malaga. Here he constructed a special blacked-out room, into which he would retreat from the sun and light a roaring fire, pretending he was back in Sweden.\n\nHe remained a popular figure in the courts of Europe, though more respected in Norwegian royal circles than in the Swedish; his 90th birthday was celebrated in Oslo in the presence of many crowned heads. By this time the exacting laws surrounding the Swedish succession had been relaxed, and Sweden's king was married to a commoner who became Queen Silvia."
