        "text": "Prince Gustav and Princess Carina of Denmark have named their newborn daughter Princess Mafalda, it has been announced.\n\nGustav - who is Queen Margrethe's nephew - and Carina Axelsson, both 55, welcomed their second child earlier this month via surrogate, with a spokesperson now confirming they have named her Mafalda.\n\nIt's a highly personal and touching choice of name for the couple. While it's possible it could be a nod to Gustav's ancestor, Princess Mafalda of Savoy, who was imprisoned and died in a Nazi concentration camp during WWII, there could be another meaning for the Prince and Princess' poignant choice. The name means ‘mighty in battle’, with Mafalda's birth coming after the couple fought for 20 years to marry.\n\nThe couple spent almost two decades battling a strict inheritance rule set by the royal's grandfather Prince Gustav Albrecht, before finally marrying in a lavish ceremony in Germany in 2022.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nGustav reportedly met Carina, a model and author, in 2003, before she later moved into the Schloss Berleburg estate with him. While the couple quickly fell in love, they were prevented from marrying because of Carina's Swedish and Mexican heritage. A strict rule set by Prince Gustav Albrecht in the 1930s prevented relations from inheriting family property if they were to marry someone not of Protestant, noble, or Aryan descent.\n\nRead More\n\nRoyal baby joy! Princess Alexandra of Luxembourg welcomes her first child with her husband Nicolas Bagory and announces her beautiful name\n\nPrincess Alexandra and Nicolas recently celebrated their first wedding anniversary after tying the knot in France last year\n\nGustav's father Prince Richard was able to inherit property because Princess Benedikte of Denmark, the sister of Queen Margarethe, met the strict and controlling criteria. However, according to Town and Country, after Prince Richard died in 2017, Gustav faced a lengthy legal battle with his great uncle Prince Prince Ludwig-Ferdinand over the fortune.\n\nSpeaking to the Dorset Echo in 2019, Carine explained how she split her time between Germany and England, describing her home in Purbeck as a ‘writing bolthole.’\n\nBut the following year, German courts ruled Gustav met the conditions of the will and would inherit Berleburg Castle. The couple then married in front of a small group of 80 esteemed guests, including King Frederik and Queen Mary.\n\nThey welcomed their first baby, a son, in June last year, with a statement at the time detailing, 'Princess Carina & Prince Gustav are very happy & grateful for this opportunity & thanks everyone involved who has helped to find a legally legal path to follow.\n\n‘For the sake of the child, please refrain from further questions. Further information will be published in due course.’\n\nRead More\n\nBridgerton’s new leading man!

He sat down with Tatler.com to discuss how he kept the news secret, advice from his cast mates and the darker side of his love story. Book and show fans, be warned; spoilers are ahead\n\nThe couple named the royal baby Prince Gustav Albrecht of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg and celebrated with a family christening. King Frederik's eldest son, Prince Christian of Denmark, was named a godparent, alongside Princess Theodora of Greece, 40, actress Ellen Hillingsø, 56, Prince Franz-Albrecht, 40, Arabella Gaggero and Prince Carl-Anton.\n\nThe Palace announced earlier this year they have had their second royal baby via surrogate. Speaking to German media, a spokesperson confirmed, ‘ Their Highnesses, Prince Gustav and Princess Carina, have become parents for the second time. They have had a daughter. Everyone involved is doing well and is very happy. The child was born on Friday 26 April.’"
