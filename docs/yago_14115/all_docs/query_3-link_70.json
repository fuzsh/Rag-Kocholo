        "text": "Prince Carl Philip's wife went to the dark side with her latest choice of jewels for her wedding tiara\n\nPrincess Sofia of Sweden made another major change to her royal wedding tiara.\n\nThe Swedish princess, 39, sparkled at the April 23 state banquet at Stockholm Palace held in honor of the Finland state visit, sporting a new set of gems on her go-to tiara. According to royal fashion blog UFO No More, Princess Sofia debuted London blue topaz gemstones on her Palmette Tiara. The new jewels perfectly coordinated her navy blue ballgown by Oscar de la Renta, a dress that she previously wore to the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony in 2015, and marked the darkest stones to top the tiara yet.\n\nThe blue gems mark the seventh setting that Princess Sofia has worn on the Palmette Tiara. She received the diamond headpiece as a wedding present from her in-laws, King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia, when she married Prince Carl Philip in 2015 and wore it with emeralds on their wedding day.\n\nThrough the years, Sofia swapped the stones at the top of the palmettes with pearls, turquoise, lighter blue topaz and citrines. She's also worn it without additional jewels, underscoring the impressive versatility of the sparkler.\n\nRelated: Royal or Movie Star?

It’s been a frequent fixture in the princess’ royal rotation ever since, though she has also worn other tiaras from the Swedish royal vault since her wedding day.\n\nIn December 2023, the Duchess of Värmland shimmered in her Palmette Tiara twice in a row and styled the sparkler in two different ways. The Swedish royal wore the headpiece to the 2023 Nobel Prize Banquet at Stockholm City Hall in its emerald setting on Dec. 10 and switched it up by skipping the extra gems for the King's Nobel Dinner at the Royal Palace on Dec. 11.\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

The diplomatic dinner capped the first night of Finish President Alexander Stubb’s two-day state visit to Sweden, and Queen Silvia and Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden also donned tiaras.\n\nAs seen in a video shared on Instagram by the Swedish Royal House, the state banquet looked straight out of a Bridgerton bash. The Queen of Sweden shimmered in the statement-making Queen Sofia’s Tiara, while her eldest daughter Crown Princess Victoria, 46, wore the Boucheron Laurel Wreath Tiara.\n\n\"Thank you for an eventful day, @alexstubb,\" the court captioned the clip, which opened with a shot of Queen Silvia and President Stubb sharing a laugh together at dinner.\n\nThe Swedish Royal Court announced the incoming state visit from Finland in March, following his election in February, and said the event would celebrate the special relationship the two countries share.\n\n\"On 23–24 April 2024, the President of the Republic of Finland Alexander Stubb and his wife Suzanne Innes-Stubb will pay a state visit to Sweden at the invitation of HM The King. The President will be accompanied by a delegation of government and business representatives,\" the court said in a statement.\n\n\"The tradition of a newly elected Finnish president making their first state visit to Sweden reflects the special relationship that exists between Sweden and Finland. The state visit underlines the two countries’ close ties and affinity.\"\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
