        "text": "Princess Madeleine of Sweden and her husband Chris O'Neill welcomed their third child together on Friday, but they kept the baby girl's name secret. Today, however, the royal couple finally revealed her moniker: Princess Adrienne. But her full name is Adrienne Josephine Alice, Princess of Sweden and Duchess of Blekinge, according to People.\n\nThe mother of three shared a new photo of the infant at home with older siblings, four-year-old Princess Leonore and two-year-old Prince Nicolas. The little one is adorably asleep in a light pink onesie while her big brother and sister lean over to kiss her forehead.\n\n\"Leonore and Nicolas welcoming their little sister home ❤️,\" Princess Madeleine wrote on Instagram.\n\nAs cute as this family portrait is, it's not even the first photo the royal couple has shared of their newborn. That arrived on Friday, right after they announced Princess Adrienne's birth. The royals debuted a snapshot of the baby girl (sleeping, yet again) in a pink sweater, frilly white collar, and knit footie pajamas.\n\n\"We are delighted with the new addition to our family,\" said O’Neill in a statement released by the palace on Friday, People reports. \"Leonore and Nicolas have their long-awaited sibling—They can’t wait to meet their new baby sister.\"\n\nThanks to Princess Madeleine's new photo, we can finally see how the young Swedish royals feel about the newest member of their family. The royals are getting settled with the little princess in Stockholm, although they're actually based in London, People reports.\n\nPrincess Adrienne is 10th in line for the Swedish throne, following her two older siblings and mom, Princess Madeleine, who is seventh. The mother of three is King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden's third child. She follows her two older siblings, Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Carl Philip, and their children in line for the crown."
