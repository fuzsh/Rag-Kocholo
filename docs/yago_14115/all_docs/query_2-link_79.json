        "text": "There is a villa built for the Danish princess in Qingdao. The princess has never lived and has become a tourist attraction Qingdao Badaguan. It is one of the most beautiful urban areas in the country. This city faces the sea, and there are many different styles of small houses hidden in the green trees. It is called the Museum of Architecture of the World. Among the most representative small houses in the Eight Great Passes, the Princess House is famous. Located on the Juyongguan Road in Badaguan, the Princess House is a Danish-style villa with a pointed roof reminiscent of Danish fairy tales. The Princess House was built in the 1930s and has a history of about 90 years. It covers an area of nearly 1,000 square meters. Into the princess building, there are many scenes of Andersen's fairy tale. Princess House was built by Prince Axel of Denmark at the time for his wife Princess Margaret, but Princess Margaret did not come to Qingdao, but the Princess House was retained. This small building has three floors, and the dark green wall looks different. The louver from the top of Xiaoyang Building can overlook the sea. Before the construction of the princess building, Prince Axel took a cruise to Qingdao and was impressed by the beauty of Badaguan. The large balcony of the Princess House is unique and is best for taking pictures. The building is simple, fluid, sophisticated and lively. There are closets, wooden escalators, floors and wall skirts in the interior. The rooms are small and bright, and the living facilities are complete. There is a waiting room, a princess restaurant and a catering room on the first floor, a bedroom and a living room on the second floor, and a shoemaking workshop on the third floor. The Xiaoyang Building remains the same. There are many small houses like Ba Daguan. The most famous ones are Huashilou and Princess Building. In addition, there is a Spanish style pavilion next to the princess building. There is also a butterfly building not far away. It is also a tourist attraction open to the public."
