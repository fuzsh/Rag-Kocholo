In her role as UNDP Goodwill Ambassador, the Crown Princess will play a key role in increasing awareness and engagement for the Sustainable Development Goals and a sustainable future where no one is left behind.\n\n“It is a great honor to have been named Goodwill Ambassador for UNDP. It gives me additional opportunities to support the work for the Sustainable Development Goals. I look forward to immersing myself in UNDP's work to prevent many of the difficult challenges the world faces today that affect people all over the world.”\n\nThe Crown Princess’ devotion to environmental and climate-related issues led to the United Nation’s then Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointing the Crown Princess as one of 17 Advocates during 2016-2019 for the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. Since 2019, the Crown Princess is an SDG Advocate Emerita and from 2023 has the dual role UNDP Goodwill Ambassador for the SDGs.\n\nThe Crown Princess Victoria's Fund was founded in her name by the Swedish Radio Appeal in 1997 and, to mark their wedding in 2010, the Crown Princess and Prince Daniel established the Crown Princess Couple's Foundation, and later Generation Pep to promote inclusion, young people's health and wellbeing. The Crown Princess is also a patron of the Gundua foundation that runs a school and health center in Kenya.\n\nOver the years, the Crown Princess has participated in several high-level UN engagements, including the UN Ocean Conference in 2017 and 2022, the 2020 global launch of the Human Development Report, the UNDP Ocean Innovation Challenge and a study trip to UNDP in Kenya together with UNDP Goodwill Ambassador and Crown Prince Haakon of Norway in November 2022, to raise awareness for climate action, biodiversity and efforts to end poverty.\n\nGoodwill Ambassador in action"
