        "text": "1\n\nWho got married?\n\nRachel Meghan Markle, a.k.a. Meghan Markle, an American actress best known for playing Rachel Zane in the long-running legal-intrigue drama “Suits,” married Prince Henry Charles Albert David of Wales, a.k.a. Prince Harry. See all our royal wedding coverage here.\n\n2\n\nWhen, exactly?\n\nDays\n\nHours\n\nMinutes\n\nSeconds\n\nSaturday, May 19, 2018. The ceremony happened at noon local time (7 a.m. Eastern time) and lasted about an hour.\n\n3\n\nAnd where was it?\n\nBen Stansall/Getty Images\n\n×\n\nAt St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle.\n\n4\n\nIs that near Buckingham Palace?\n\nNope. Buckingham Palace is in London. Windsor Castle is in Windsor, a picturesque old town some 20 miles west of London. Windsor is also known for its proximity to Eton College, which is the boarding school Harry and William attended.\n\n5\n\nWere William and Kate married at Buckingham Palace?\n\nChris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nNope again. On April 29, 2011, William and Kate (which is what the British papers call her, even though her official name is Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge) were married at Westminster Abbey, a church that is in London and a 15-minute walk from Buckingham Palace.\n\n6\n\nCould I have gone to the wedding?\n\nSorry, but no, unless you were one of about 600 personal guests who got to sit in the chapel, or among the several thousand who were invited to stand on the grounds of Windsor Castle to watch the wedding party enter and leave. That group included members of the royal household, local school children and “regular” people who work for charities, community organizations and the like.\n\n7\n\nWhen did the invitations go out?\n\nOn March 22, invitations went out to about 600 guests. The ink was American, the card stock was English and the invitations were printed by Barnard and Westwood, if you’re into that sort of thing.\n\nVictoria Jones/AFP/Getty Images\n\n×\n\n8\n\nWhat if my invitation was lost in the mail?\n\nThe non-invitees were able to congregate around the town of Windsor with other eager to catch a glimpse of the couple.\n\n9\n\nHow can I watch the wedding?\n\nYou can watch the whole thing right here!\n\n10\n\nDo we know who any of the guests were?\n\nJustin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images\n\n×\n\nThere were a number of predictable attendees: Harry’s grandparents, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip; his father and stepmother, Prince Charles and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall; various cousins, like Zara and Peter Phillips and Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice; and of course his brother and sister-in-law, William and Catherine, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.\n\nSean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nThen, of course, there were members of royal families from other countries. They’re all on a big royal-family-wedding circuit, traveling around to one other’s ceremonies. And, since this is as much public celebration as private service, guests will include representatives from British charities, churches and armed forces; government officials, past and present; and dignitaries from other countries.\n\nAs for nonroyals, Harry has a posse of boisterous friends — Guy Pelly, Tom Inskip and Thomas van Straubenzee, among others.\n\nAnd there were celebrities: Serena Williams, Priyanka Chopra, Oprah, Victoria and David Beckham, Elton John, Amal and George Clooney and Carey Mulligan were among them.\n\n11\n\nWas Donald Trump invited to the royal wedding?\n\nNope!\n\n“It has been decided that an official list of political leaders — both U.K. and international — is not required for Prince Harry and Ms. Markle’s wedding,” Kensington Palace said in a statement. “Her Majesty’s Government was consulted on this decision, which was taken by The Royal Household.”\n\n12\n\nWhat about Harry’s pal Barack Obama?\n\nNo, not even him (or Michelle). See above.\n\nChris Jackson/Getty Images\n\n×\n\n13\n\nWas there a dress code for guests?\n\nYes! According to the invitations, men were supposed to wear uniforms, morning coats or “lounge suits,” by which they mean, essentially, business suits. Women were expected to wear “day dresses” — dresses that aren’t evening gowns — and hats. The hats are often highly amusing, resembling (depending on how you look at them) flying saucers, plant pots, teacups, hedges, bathing caps, Calder mobiles, frisbees, pyramids, fezzes — you name it. Here you can see some of the many hats from William and Kate’s wedding.\n\n14\n\nI’m not into fashion. What else can I get excited about?\n\nAll weddings are a-swirl with all manner of uninformed gossip about the guests: Who knows whom, why they are sitting in their particular spots, which ones slept with/dated/still pine for the bride or the groom. Even better, it will be a prime occasion to revisit the talk about the intrigues, allegiances and feuds within the royal family itself.\n\nAlso, there was always the chance that Prince Philip would say something completely inappropriate.\n\n15\n\nWho planned the royal wedding?\n\nThe couple made it clear that they were responsible for much of the overall tone of the day. That said, the Lord Chamberlain’s Office, which is the department of Buckingham Palace responsible for all public events — state visits, palace garden parties and the like — oversaw all the necessary logistical and ceremonial details. The office is comparable in many ways to that of the White House social secretary.\n\n16\n\nWho performed the ceremony?\n\nThe Right Rev. David Conner, also known as the dean of Windsor, is the spiritual head of St. George’s Chapel performed the service. The Most Rev. and Right Honorable Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, and the Most Rev. Michael Curry, the first African-American leader of the Episcopal Church, officiated the vows. Bishop Curry gave a powerful speech, citing Martin Luther King Jr. several times.\n\n17\n\nWho writes the vows for a royal wedding?\n\nRoyal weddings usually follow a rigid script of words and rituals based on the traditional Anglican wedding ceremony prescribed in the Book of Common Prayer.\n\n18\n\nLet’s back up. How did Harry and Meghan meet?\n\nThey say they met in London in July 2016, on a blind date organized by a mutual friend. A few weeks later, he whisked her off to Botswana, where they “camped out with each other under the stars,” Harry said afterward in an interview with the BBC (see below). They then had a few months of long-distance dating, visiting each other in Britain and in Toronto, where Meghan was filming “Suits.”\n\n19\n\nWhen did their relationship become public?\n\nThat November, Prince Harry’s office issued a statement identifying Meghan as his girlfriend and denouncing the racist and sexist undertones of some newspaper coverage and social media commentary. “Prince Harry is worried about Ms. Markle’s safety and is deeply disappointed that he has not been able to protect her,” the statement said.\n\n20\n\nI want to hear them tell their story in their own words.\n\nWatch this post-engagement interview with the BBC:\n\nBBC News\n\n21\n\nO.K., so tell me about Meghan Markle’s engagement ring.\n\nChris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nThe ring was designed by Harry himself and comprises a large central diamond from Botswana and some smaller diamonds that belonged to his late mother, Diana, the Princess of Wales.\n\nAs he explained: “The little diamonds [on] either side are from my mother’s jewelry collection, to make sure that she’s with us on this crazy journey together.”\n\n22\n\nDid Queen Elizabeth II need to give permission?\n\nYes. Anyone who is “one of six persons next in line of succession to the Crown” must receive the queen’s permission to get married, according to Section 3 of the Succession to the Crown Act.\n\n23\n\nSo did she sign off?\n\nYes. In mid-March, the queen issued her formal declaration of consent at a meeting of the Privy Council. It read as follows: “My lords, I declare My Consent to a Contract of Matrimony between My Most Dearly Beloved Grandson Prince Henry Charles Albert David of Wales and Rachel Meghan Markle, which Consent I am causing to be signified under the Great Seal and to be entered in the Books of the Privy Council.”\n\nAnd it wasn’t only the queen who approved. “The corgis took to you straight away,” Harry told Meghan in the BBC interview, referring to his grandmother’s beloved dogs. “For the last 33 years, I've been barked at. This one walks in and absolutely nothing. Just wagging tails.”\n\n24\n\nWhy was this wedding important?\n\nIt was not important. For one thing, Harry is currently only sixth in line for the throne, after the birth of Kate and William’s third child, Prince Louis Arthur Charles, on April 23. Barring the unlikely event that all the people ahead of him — the current monarch, Queen Elizabeth;\n\nPrince Charles;\n\nPrince William;\n\nand William’s two children, Prince George and\n\nPrincess Charlotte,\n\nas well as their third child, Prince Louis\n\n— are eliminated in some sort of “Kind Hearts and Coronets” scenario, he has no chance of ever being king. And to be honest, British monarchs have nothing like the kind of power that they used to.\n\n25\n\nSo why should we care?\n\nBecause Harry, being unconstrained by the responsibilities that burden his older brother, William, has recovered from some earlier lapses in judgment to bring a delightfully racy and joyously improvisational approach to his royal life. And because Meghan is so different from most royal brides-to-be: She is American, biracial (her mother is African-American and her father is white), divorced and 36, which makes her three years older than her Harry.\n\n26\n\nHow significant is the fact that Meghan is biracial?\n\nPeople of color are underrepresented in British politics and not represented at all in the royal family. Many have said they are thrilled to see someone like themselves in Meghan’s position.\n\nThe idea has resonated across the Atlantic, too, with #blackprincess gaining traction on Twitter and Instagram the day the engagement was announcement. (Meghan will probably be a duchess, not a princess, but it’s a matter of semantics.)\n\n27\n\nWould it be at all possible to surf this website without such cutting-edge art direction?\n\n28\n\nHow do Kate and Meghan get along?\n\nBy all accounts, the soon-to-be sisters-in-law get along just fine. They’re neighbors at Kensington Palace and have appeared happily together on several occasions since Meghan and Harry’s engagement was announced.\n\n29\n\nWhat’s this about them being neighbors?\n\nHarry and Meghan currently live in Nottingham Cottage, a (relatively) modest two-bedroom home on the grounds of Kensington Palace, in London.\n\n30\n\nWhat’s the difference between Kensington Palace and Buckingham Palace again?\n\nDaniel Leal-Olivas/Getty Images\n\nKensington Palace is a royal residence that is currently home to not just Harry and Meghan, but William, Kate and their children, as well as several other members of the royal family. Buckingham Palace is the home of Harry’s grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n31\n\nDid Meghan have a bachelorette party?\n\nIt’s rumored that she had a spa-themed “hen do” (that’s British for “bachelorette party”) at the Soho Farmhouse, which is a countryside arm of the members-only Soho House, in March.\n\n32\n\nDid she have bridesmaids?\n\nMeghan was accompanied by six bridesmaids and four page boys, ranging in age from 2 to 7. The bridesmaids were 3-year-old Princess Charlotte; 3-year-old Florence van Cutsem and 2-year-old Zalie Warren (both goddaughters of Prince Harry); 7-year-old Rylan Litt and 6-year-old Remi Litt (both goddaughters of Meghan); and 4-year-old Ivy Mulroney (daughter of the stylist Jessica Mulroney, Meghan’s close pal, and her husband Ben). The page boys were 4-year-old Prince George, 6-year-old Jasper Dyer (godson of Prince Harry), and 7-year-old twins Brian and John Mulroney (brothers to Ivy).\n\nMeghan did not have a maid of honor, because she is simply too popular and all her friends love her: “She has a very close-knit circle of friends and she didn’t want to choose one over another,” said the spokesman. When the Duchess of Cambridge had her younger sister Pippa Middleton as her maid of honor, that was more of an exception than a rule. Royal weddings rarely feature adult female bridesmaids.\n\n33\n\nWere Prince George and Princess Charlotte in the wedding?\n\nJustin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSee above! And Prince Louis Arthur Charles, born on April 23, did not participate.\n\n34\n\nDo Harry and Meghan want kids?\n\nSounds like it. In their post-engagement interview with the BBC, Prince Harry said, “Of course, one step at a time and hopefully we’ll start a family in the near future.”\n\n35\n\nWhat are Harry and Meghan’s new titles?\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex! It’s a title that has not been used in the royal family since 1843.\n\nNational Portrait Gallery of London\n\n36\n\nSo what name will be on Meghan’s driver’s license?\n\nBest guess is Rachel Meghan Mountbatten Windsor. Windsor is the last name adopted by the British royal family in 1917; King George V changed the name from the German “Saxe-Coburg and Gotha” to the English “Windsor” amid strong anti-German feeling during World War I. And Prince Philip distanced himself from his family’s ultra-German names — Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg — in the wake of World War II. That’s when he adopted the quasi-English surname “Mountbatten” from his mother’s side.\n\n37\n\nWho are Meghan’s parents?\n\nHer mother, Doria Loyce Ragland is a social worker and yoga instructor who lives in California. Her father, Thomas Markle, Sr., is a lighting director who worked in California for years but now lives in Mexico. The two divorced in 1988.\n\n38\n\nWhere is Meghan from?\n\nBorn and raised in Los Angeles, Meghan is a true California girl.\n\n39\n\nDoes Meghan have brothers or sisters?\n\nShe has two older paternal half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jr. In February, her 51-year-old half-brother told In Touch Weekly that he had contacted the palace for advice on dealing with the press after Meghan’s engagement was announced. He then claimed that his lawyer received a response from Meghan that said: “That’s distant family and I don’t know those people.” Odds are he’s not at the top of the guest list.\n\n40\n\nAnd who was Meghan’s first husband?\n\nHis name is Trevor Engelson, and Meghan dated him for seven years before marrying him on the beach in Jamaica in 2011. (A mere 100 guests attended that wedding; the marriage was over two years later.) After Meghan got engaged again, Mr. Engelson reportedly began work on a TV pilot about a divorcee who marries a prince. What are the odds?\n\n41\n\nAnd who has Harry dated?\n\nThe prince was known for his penchant for blondes until he met Meghan. For seven years he dated Chelsy Davy, a Zimbabwean lawyer turned jeweler. Then there was the aristocratic actress Cressida Bonas. Both attended the wedding. He also dated British singer Ellie Goulding.\n\n42\n\nWho designed Meghan Markle’s wedding dress?\n\nClare Waight Keller for Givenchy is the lucky winner.\n\nThe running favorite, at least according to the gossipy fashion industry, was the brand Ralph & Russo. Meghan chose a dress made by the London couture house for her official engagement portraits, and the brand is known for its over-the-top wedding dresses, which now account for around 30 percent of annual revenue. Beloved by Beyoncé, the Kardashians, Angelina Jolie and — last but not least! — Kylie Minogue, the brand was valued at more than $285 million in 2014 and introduced a sell-out range of accessories in 2015 and in 2016.\n\nvia Twitter\n\n×\n\n43\n\nWere there any other contenders?\n\nErdem Moralioglu, a Canadian-Turkish designer known for his romantic designs, was another rumored contender. Erdem commands a glittering A-list clientele, recently produced a sold-out H&M collaboration and already counts Meghan as a firm fan (in a Vanity Fair interview last year she mentioned him as “a designer I’ve been wearing for years”). Oh, and his most recent show, at London Fashion Week in February, was inspired by the tale of an American actress who marries an aristocrat. Sound familiar?\n\nAs a reminder, when Kate married William in 2011, she wore a spectacular dress with a nine-foot train designed by Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen, and a tiara borrowed from the actual queen. (The dress was said to have cost the paint-peeling sum of $434,000 to make.)\n\n44\n\nWhat did Harry wear?\n\nA “frockcoat uniform of the Blues and Royals” by Dege & Skinner. Read more about it here.\n\nHarry received the title of Captain General Royal Marines in 2017, which means he is ceremonial head of the Royal Marines (he took over the job from his grandpa, Prince Philip). More pertinently, he’s an officer in the Blues and Royals, part of the Army Air Corps, which is why he ended up wearing one of their uniforms. (Prince William wore a scarlet Irish Guards Mounted Officer’s uniform at his.)\n\n45\n\nWhat about the cake?\n\nBritish weddings usually feature fruitcakes.\n\nBarry Batchelor/Getty Images\n\nThrowing aside this strange and perverse custom, the couple decided to serve organic lemon elderflower cake that will be covered in buttercream icing and fresh flowers and is meant to “incorporate the bright flavours of spring.” It was made by the hip Violet bakery in the (even hipper) London borough of Hackney. The owner and baker, Claire Ptak, who was raised in California and believes in using seasonal, organic ingredients, said on Instagram that the couple “both share so many of the same values regarding food provenance, sustainability, seasonality and of course, flavour!”\n\n46\n\nAnd the flowers?\n\nOn March 31, it was announced that the couple had chosen white garden roses, peonies and foxgloves for their wedding day floral displays.\n\nThe bouquets, decorations and garlands will be designed by the florist Philippa Craddock, Kensington Palace said in a statement. Ms. Craddock is a favorite of the fashion world and has done floral arrangements for Jenny Packham’s runway show, a Star Wars after-party, Dior events and more.\n\nDominic Lipinski/AFP/Getty Images\n\n×\n\nThe displays will use flowers and foliage taken from the gardens of the royal palaces and Windsor Great Park, and reflect the wild and natural landscapes from which many of the plants will be picked from, and Ms. Craddock will work alongside a team of florists from St. George’s Chapel and Buckingham Palace.\n\n“Working with them has been an absolute pleasure,” Ms. Craddock said of the royal couple, calling the creative process, “highly collaborative, free-flowing, creative and fun.”\n\nThe presence of peonies was no major surprise: Meghan has previously said on social media that peonies make her “endlessly happy.” White roses meanwhile, were a favorite flower of Princess Diana.\n\n47\n\nWhat about the real party?\n\nThat came later Saturday night at Frogmore House. It was hosted by Prince Charles.\n\n48\n\nWhat about music at the wedding? And was there a band or a D.J. at the party?\n\nAccording to a statement from Kensington Palace on April 24: \"Prince Harry and Ms. Markle have taken a great deal of interest and care in choosing the music\" for their wedding ceremony.\n\nThere were well-known hymns and choral works performed by the St. George's Chapel choir and an orchestra, plus performances by the opera soprano Elin Manahan Thomas, trumpeter David Blackadder and rising star cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason, 19, who is the first black winner of the prestigious BBC Young Musician of the Year award.\n\nA Christian gospel group, the Kingdom Choir, was also at the ceremony and sang a rousing version of “Stand by Me.”\n\nThe nighttime reception at Frogmore House was private, but the Daily Mail reports that Elton John sang four tunes and there was indeed a DJ by the name of Sam Totolee who played house music.\n\nJohn Stillwell/Getty Images\n\n×\n\n49\n\nWho pays for royal weddings, anyway?\n\nThe Royal Family pays for the wedding itself — the service, the flowers, the music and the reception. The bride typically pays for her dress. The British public pays for security.\n\n50\n\nHow much do royal weddings cost?\n\nIf you have to ask, you can’t afford one.\n\n51\n\nFair enough. How much did William and Kate’s wedding cost?\n\nIt reportedly cost $34 million, of which\n\nwent to security — and was paid for by the British taxpayers. This amount is equal to:\n\n52\n\nWhat sort of things did Meghan do in preparation for marrying into the royal family?\n\nIn addition to the regular stuff — making official public appearances at various events; making small talk with people in crowds; dressing more conservatively and accessorizing her outfits with the kind of hats that young female royals seem required to wear in a way that is not ironic — Meghan opted to (or had to) convert to Anglicanism, the official religion in England, before marrying Harry.\n\n53\n\nWhat religion did she convert from?\n\nMeghan was already a Protestant, so it was not a huge stretch.\n\n54\n\nWill she become a British citizen?\n\nYes. And she’ll have to take a torturous citizenship test to do it.\n\n55\n\nIs Meghan giving up her career as an actress?\n\nYes. But, she says, “I don’t see it as giving anything up. I just see it as a change. It’s a new chapter,” saying to Harry “Now it’s time to work as a team with you.”\n\n56\n\nWhat will she do? What do royals actually do day-to-day?\n\nIn many ways, young royals are just like us: they drive cars, go to supermarkets, drop kids off at school and work out at the gym. But while some have day jobs — Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, for instance — it’s unlikely that Meghan will take on a 9-to-5 job after her marriage. There will be numerous public engagements to attend (exactly what kind will be clearer once she has outlined the causes and charities she plans to support), and you can expect a royal tour abroad with her new husband in the first year or two. Got to keep the fans happy, after all.\n\n57\n\nWhat are some other ways Meghan’s life will change post-wedding?\n\nFor one, she’ll have to get used to sitting in royal ranking order. At events attended by a large number of royal persons, members must enter in reverse order of who’s next in line to the throne, from most junior to most senior, with the queen last of all. Partners stay together, so Meghan and Harry will enter first, followed by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (William and Kate), the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall (Prince Charles and Camilla), and lastly Queen Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh (Prince Philip). Her Majesty will then be seated in the middle, with the family ordered around her.\n\nAlso, royals are not meant to make their political views public, at least on certain issues; don’t vote; and can’t run for office. So Meghan, long outspoken on many social issues, will have to be careful with how she uses her new platform.\n\n58\n\nIs it true that Harry and Meghan are distant cousins?\n\n59\n\nWhat are some reliable sources of information on this wedding? Besides this F.A.Q., of course.\n\n60\n\nWas there an official photographer?\n\nThere was! And his name is Alexi Lubomirski. You can see the official royal wedding photos here.\n\nBorn in England and raised in Botswana, Mr. Lubomirski took the couple’s official engagement portrait last year and is known for his glossy shots in magazines like Elle and Vogue. He also, incidentally, happens to be a dashing European prince. Between commissions, His Serene Highness Alexi Lubomirski of Poland found time to pen a book: “Princely Advice for a Happy Life,” published in 2015.\n\n61\n\nWas May 19 a public holiday in the U.K.?\n\nNo. There was a public holiday to celebrate the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011, but William is the future king. Harry is not. One special exception was made for the party-loving royal’s big day, though: The government announced that pubs, bars and other licensed premises can keep serving alcohol until 1 a.m., instead of the usual 11 p.m., on the nights of May 18 and May 19.\n\n62\n\nWhat about the honeymoon?\n\nWe may never know.\n\nBut rumors abound: Namibia was Travel and Leisure’s guess, while TMZ reported that the couple would stay in the private Outlook Cabin at the Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge in Alberta, Canada. (The resort’s website refers to the 6,000-square-foot cabin as “The Royal Retreat” because it has hosted members of the British royal family in the past; Harry’s grandmother Queen Elizabeth stayed there with Prince Philip in 2005. You can take a virtual tour of the six-bedroom premiseshere.)\n\nThere was also internet chatter about Ireland and Ashford Castle.\n\nOne place seemingly never on the list: Thailand. Too bad because ina 2013 video for the beauty subscription service Birchbox, Meghan stated that a meal she once had atChote Chitr in Bangkok (ranked No. 6,832 of 10,542 restaurants in Bangkok on TripAdvisor as of this writing) was “probably the best meal I ever had in my life.”\n\n63\n\nWhat do I get the royal who has everything?\n\nGet them the one thing they don’t have: nothing. In lieu of gifts, Meghan and Harry have asked those well-wishers eager to spend money on them to donate to charities. The couple have nominated seven organizations “reflecting their shared values.” On the royal family’s official website, guests and nonguests alike can find links to donate directly to the organizations. (In the lead-up to their wedding, William and Kate asked would-be gift givers to contribute to a general fund for 26 charities.)\n\nHere’s Meghan and Harry’s list:\n\nCHIVA (Children's H.I.V. Association): An organization that supports children and young people living with H.I.V. in U.K. and Ireland. Harry hosted members of CHIVA’s youth committee at Kensington Palace in October of 2016.\n\nCrisis: The U.K.’s national charity for homeless people. In January, Meghan and Harry’s nuptials became a source of local controversy when a politician in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead (the site of their wedding venue) called on police to “take immediate action” against homeless people living in the vicinity, in preparation for the May event. Crisis responded via written statement on April 1 criticizing the “criminalising of people simply because they are homeless.” On April 8, the couple named the charity to their list of recommended donation recipients.\n\nMyna Mahila Foundation: A health organization that aims to destigmatize menstruation, promote menstrual hygiene, and increase access to menstruation pads in India. Meghan visited the foundation headquarters in January of 2017; her experience there featured prominently in an op-ed about global perceptions of menstruation that she wrote for Time.com in March of that year.\n\nScotty's Little Soldiers: A military charity that offers support to children and young people whose parents died while serving in the British armed forces. In May of 2017, Harry hosted children from the organization at a garden party at Buckingham Palace, where he spun plates.\n\nStreetGames: A network of neighborhood sports projects that aims to bring organized sports to underserved communities. On the couple’s first official visit to Wales, Harry encouraged young StreetGames participants to ambush Meghan in what her fleeting look of panic suggested was an impromptu group hug.\n\nSurfers Against Sewage: A marine conservation charity in Cornwall, where Harry has been known to surf. Cowabunga, mate.\n\nThe Wilderness Foundation U.K.: A wildlife conservation charity with an emphasis on exposing young people to the outdoors. In September 2017, Harry traveled to Essex to observe an environmental education program run by the foundation, where he saw a woman throw water at a child (with the child’s permission).\n\n64\n\nWho was Harry’s best man?\n\nWilliam. Harry was William’s best man. No one’s best man: the actress Priyanka Chopra, who has publicly declared she is not Meghan’s maid of honor, although they are friends.\n\n65\n\nDo royals have wedding rehearsals?\n\nWilliam and Kate had multiple ones, right up until the night before their wedding.\n\n66\n\n“Will any corgis be in attendance?” — Joan Toth, United States\n\nAlmost certainly not. William and Kate didn’t have corgis at their wedding, nor did Charles at either of his. Even the corgi zealot Queen Elizabeth’s nuptials were dog-free, though Vanity Fair reported in a 2015 royal dog deep dive that one tagged along for her honeymoon.\n\nThis could be a heartbreaking situation for the corgis who, to hear Harry and Meghan tell it, would love to marry Meghan themselves. (See Question 23.)\n\nAnd there is the simple fact that there just aren’t that many of them in the royal household anymore: The Daily Mail reported that the queen’s last \"royal\" corgi (descended from a corgi owned by her father), Willow, died on April 15th, 2018 at age 14. The monarch still has two dachshund-corgi mixes (“dorgis” named Vulcan and Candy), and one corgi (Whisper) she adopted after the death of its owner.\n\nAnd anyway, how many dogs is your grandmother allowed to bring to your wedding?\n\n67\n\n“Is there any chance of Meghan Markle getting back on social media?” — Ankit Bera\n\nIt’s unlikely that Meghan will reactivate her old social media accounts in the near future. Currently, neither the queen nor members of Prince Charles’s immediate family publicly maintain individual accounts. Charles and Camilla’s official comings and goings are tracked by @ClarenceHouse on Twitter and Instagram. William, Kate and Harry are represented in the same spaces by @KensingtonRoyal, which has been incorporating Palace-sanctioned Meghan news into its feeds since the engagement was announced. (Unlike those three, Meghan does not appear in the @KensingtonRoyal avatars or descriptions on either platform, but perhaps that will change once the marriage is official.) The queen, Prince Philip and other members of the royal family are covered under @RoyalFamily on Twitter and @TheRoyalFamily on Instagram.\n\nIf you’d told King Henry VIII that one day the sixth in line to the British throne would be marrying a star of USA Network’s “Suits,” he probably would have had questions: Does this mean England and Scotland have been united into a single state? What does “USA” stand for? How are you using “star” in that sentence? But he certainly would not have asked about her public social media profiles. All of which is to say, anything is possible.\n\nPrior to publicly announcing her and Harry’s relationship, Meghan was an enthusiastic user of social media, and The Daily Mail reported that he followed her on Instagram under a pseudonymous private account. (Though she deleted her Instagram in January of 2018, traces of it exist online as photos hosted on other sites. Her Twitter account half-lives in the form of cached page screenshots.) It’s possible that the royal family’s social media strategy will eventually shift from staid collective representation to more personalized individual coverage. Some extended members of the family already maintain their own accounts; Harry’s aunt Sarah Ferguson’s Twitter feed (@SarahTheDuchess, not @Fergie) makes robust use of hashtags.\n\nIn the meantime, if you’d like to be directly responsible for Meghan’s social media presence, you might apply for a job in the royal household’s communications department. It recently sought an assistant “able to think on your feet” to begin work one month before Harry and Meghan’s wedding, at a starting salary of about $30,000.\n\n68\n\n“Will Miss Meghan Markle be changing her dress for Prince Charles's late-night reception? If so, which designers are being considered for this dress?” — Rafeal Briatico, Canada\n\nShe sure did. The Duchess of Sussex stepped out for her evening reception in a backless halter dress by Stella McCartney.\n\n69\n\n“On May 19, I will be arriving at Heathrow on a British Airways flight from the States at approximately 12:30 p.m. Will I be able to watch the wedding on the plane?” — Catherine K. Kuhlman, United States\n\nWhile some American airline companies now offer Wi-Fi on select transatlantic routes, British Airways has yet to jump on that bandwagon. So you may miss out on the first hourish of the wedding, unless you catch a favorable tailwind. (And, besides, the onboard reception can be seriously patchy at the best of times.) But fear not: There are sure to be endless televised reruns of key moments in the hours and weeks following the big day.\n\n70\n\n“Is the L.G.B.T.Q. community represented in the royal family?” — Debbie Lemieux\n\nAlthough rumors about the sexuality of certain British royal family members have circulated for centuries, the first of the lot to officially come out as gay was the queen's cousin, Ivor Mountbatten, in 2016. The royal family has also made efforts in recent years to show that Britain’s L.G.B.T.Q. community is not only accepted but supported by the monarchy. In 2016, Prince William became the first member of the royal family to appear on the cover of a gay magazine when he graced the pages of Attitude. And last year, in the Queen’s Speech, Her Majesty explicitly made reference to the community, saying, “My government will make further progress to tackle the gender pay gap and discrimination against people on the basis of their race, faith, gender, disability or sexual orientation.”\n\n71\n\n“Not clear, but will Meghan have an H.R.H. before her name?” — Richard Klein, United States\n\nYes. Once Harry and Meghan tie the knot, she will take his title (see Question 35) and his last name (Question 36), which is followed by an H.R.H. In her case, that stands for Her Royal Highness.\n\n72\n\n“Will Meghan wear anything from Princess Diana?” — Simone, Denmark\n\nAs explained in Question 21, Meghan’s engagement ring features a large central diamond flanked by two smaller stones that belonged to Princess Diana.\n\n73\n\n“What is going to happen with Rachel Zane in ‘Suits’?” — Carlos\n\nShe married Mike Ross in a two-hour season finale on April 25, and she’s never coming back.\n\n74\n\n“Are there particular colors that will be used at the reception?” — Barbara Bunce, United States\n\nUnlike the wedding ceremony, the receptions (one thrown by the queen, the other by Prince Charles) will not be televised, leaving the public to conjecture about the colors and shades of various items present.\n\nWilliam and Kate’s ceremony was pretty much white, and white, and white all over (though the groom wore a red tunic in the military dress of an Irish Guards officer). The most prominent splashes of color were the red, white and blue ribbons and bows bedecking the Aston Martin the couple drove to Prince Charles’s home following their official reception. The car’s back bumper was festooned with charmingly cheesy “C” and “W” balloons (for Catherine and William) in the striking color palette of black, magenta, orange, lime and sky blue. The vehicle was reportedly decorated by Prince Harry.\n\nChris Radburn/Getty Images\n\n×\n\n75\n\n“Will there be tea??” — Anne Armstrong, United States\n\n76\n\nWill Meghan wear any of the crowns owned or worn by the late Princess Diana?\n\nAnwar Hussein/Getty Images\n\nAlmost certainly. The Duchess of Cambridge often wears crowns and tiaras owned by her late mother-in-law, including the Cambridge Lover's Knot tiara, given to Princess Diana as a wedding gift from the queen. Once Meghan is married, it is highly likely that she too will receive access to the royal collection of jewels.\n\n77\n\n“How tall is Harry?” — Robert Littman, United States\n\nHe is 6-foot-1, or 1.86 meters tall. (William is a little over 6-foot-2, or 1.91 meters.)\n\n78\n\n“What if Prince Philip (or any important royal) dies between now and the wedding? — Patty DeVille, United States\n\nWell, luckily neither he nor any other royal did. But, if someone had: it is unlikely that there would be a state funeral or that a royal wedding would be postponed unless the queen or an heir to the throne (see the order of succession in Question 24) died; far too much work and planning goes into those event. That said, any royal’s passing would be mourned by the nation, and likely marked with the Union flag at half mast over Buckingham Palace. The queen’s death would be a different matter: The Guardian published a fascinating article last year about “Operation London Bridge” — the official plan in place for her passing.\n\n79\n\n“Will their children be No. 7, No. 8, etc. in line for the throne?” — Marcia Krause Bilyk, United States\n\nYes. Any children born to Prince Harry will bump his uncle Andrew — Charles’s brother, currently seventh in line for the throne, after Harry — further down the order of succession. And thanks to an amendment passed in 2011, elder daughters will not lose their positions to sons born later. (The change is already affecting William’s children; it’s why Princess Charlotte remains fourth in line to the throne after big brother George and Prince Louis slid in at No. 5.) Bear in mind that any children eventually born to George, Charlotte or Louis will knock Harry (and his kids) even further from the top spot.\n\n80\n\n“Where are the answers?” — Karen K. Cleaver\n\nClick on the questions, Karen!\n\n81\n\nWas this wedding intended to be fun?\n\nDepends on what you consider fun, really. The wedding service lasted an hour and wasn’t a barrel of laughs. Officially, however, the royal family enjoys fun. A statement about the wedding from a royal secretary said that “the crowds that have turned out in Nottingham, Cardiff, Brixton, Edinburgh, Birmingham, Belfast, Bath and elsewhere have given Ms. Markle a welcome to the United Kingdom marked by warmth, enthusiasm and a real sense of fun.” Sounds fun!\n\n82\n\nHad Meghan’s mother met the royal family prior to the wedding?\n\nMeghan’s mother, Doria Ragland, had met Harry; they were photographed together (with Meghan) at the 2017 Invictus Games in Toronto. Doria met the rest of the royal family, including the queen, the week of the wedding.\n\n83\n\nDid the ceremony include any tributes to Princess Diana?\n\nYes. Diana’s sister Lady Jane Fellowes performed a reading as part of the ceremony.\n\n84\n\nWhat was the parking situation in Windsor?\n\nThere was supposed to be room for 6,000 cars (or motorcycles) in a special “car parking area” in Windsor, but you drivers had to book their spot in advance. And pay £30! (A little over $40!!!)\n\n85\n\nWhat time did the wedding guests arrive?\n\nThemembers of the public invited inside the grounds of Windsor Castle to quasi-attend the wedding as a thank you for their community service will begin arriving around 9 a.m. They will not enter the chapel. The guests who are really, truly, actually invited will arrive from 9:30 a.m. to 11 a.m.\n\n86\n\nDid the royal family arrive at the same time as the regular guests?\n\nNo. They started arriving around 11:20 a.m. William and Harry arrived together by foot. Protocol dictates that the queen be the last member of the royal family to arrive, and she was.\n\n87\n\nWhen did Meghan get there?\n\nMeghan and her mom set out from the Cliveden House Hotel (where they stayed the night before) and she arrived right before the ceremony began at noon.\n\n88\n\nWhen did the unwashed masses get a glimpse of the married couple?\n\nPeople worldwide watched them transform from “those cool and technically single people, Harry and Meghan” into “that married couple” in real time on TV and online (see Question 9). The crowds gathered in Windsor got a look at the Duke and Duchess as they took a carriage ride through town.\n\n89\n\nWhat can you tell me about the fancy carriage they were in?\n\nHonestly too much. They were planning to ride in an open-topped Ascot Landau that dates back to the Victorian era. The Crown Equerry — that’s the British equivalent of … well, the United States doesn’t really have one … No. 1 Head Horse Guy, Accept No Substitutes? — describes the carriage as “wonderfully bright,” “small” and “lovely.” It’s black with red accents and, moving at top speed, would still be slower than the worst car you ever drove.\n\nHad it rained, the couple would have taken the Scottish State Coach, which is enclosed by glass windows.\n\n90\n\nDoes anyone living in 2018 really need more than one fancy carriage?\n\nNo, but the royal family owns dozens upon dozens upon dozens. Here’s a gilded one that weighs nearly four tons.\n\n91\n\nWho pulled the carriage?\n\nMilford Haven, Sir Basil, Storm and Tyrone.\n\n92\n\n“Why is it O.K. with the royal family that Prince Harry is marrying a divorced American when King Edward VIII had to abdicate when he married a divorced American, Wallis Simpson, in 1937?” — Jo Anne Dickerson, United States\n\nIt is true that divorce was once a deal-breaker for royal marriages (leaving aside Henry VIII). There’s no law against it, but as the head of the Church of England, a British monarch is expected to set, and enforce, high moral standards. The allergy to divorce lasted until fairly recently, thwarting the hopes and dreams not just of Edward VIII, but also of Princess Margaret, the queen’s late sister, who in 1955 was given the unsavory choice of giving up either her royal title and privileges, or the divorced man she loved. (She kept the privileges, gave up the divorced man, married someone else, and ended up divorcing him, anyway.) But no matter how upset Queen Elizabeth might be by divorce, she can’t escape the fact that three of her four children — Prince Charles, Prince Andrew and Princess Anne — all divorced their spouses. So this one falls into the \"times have changed, and we have changed with them,\" category.\n\n93\n\nWhat about Harry’s bachelor party?\n\nThe details of Harry's singledom send-off (called a “stag do” in Britain) are still unclear, but his elder brother clearly relished the prospect of some ritual humiliation. After being named best man in April (see Question 65), William told the press that “revenge is sweet.” Harry arranged William’s bachelor party back in 2011, held secretly at a country estate in Norfolk.\n\n94\n\n“Will there be a prenup?” — Mayowa Tomori, Nigeria\n\nIf there is one, you can be sure they won't release the details publicly! That said, neither Prince Charles nor Prince William had prenuptial agreements, and there are no examples of prenuptial agreements elsewhere in the British royal family. Chances are Harry won’t stray from that precedent. In fact, instances of royal families signing prenups remain relatively few and far between. One came in 2010, when Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden married her former fitness instructor, Daniel Westling. Lawyers acting for the princess ensured that all property, inheritance and gifts belonging to the royal household remained in her name alone.\n\n95\n\n“Will Meghan have to renounce her American citizenship after the wedding?” — Zackary Angeline, United States\n\nShe probably won’t have to, but she might want to. Shortly after Meghan and Harry’s engagement announcement, a spokesman for the royal family confirmed that Meghan intends to become a U.K. citizen (see Question 54), but will retain her U.S. citizenship at least while that yearslong process is underway. At the time, the spokesman declared it “too early to say” if Meghan would opt to hold onto her American citizenship after the process is complete.\n\nWhile the United States government officially “does not encourage” people to obtain dual citizenship (one reason mentioned on the state department’s travel website: “dual nationality may limit U.S. government efforts to assist nationals abroad”), pledging an oath of allegiance to Britain does not automatically invalidate Meghan’s natural-born American citizenship. To lose that, she’d either have to formally declare her intent to relinquish it (which involves some paperwork and a fee) or commit an act of treason against the United States of America (which might not gel with Meghan’s California-cool vibe). If she gives up her U.S. citizenship and later decides she wants to become a U.S. citizen again, she’ll have to go through the same application process as people who have never been American citizens.\n\nSo why might she consider giving it up entirely instead of retaining dual citizenship? For one thing, it would be a dramatic way of showing her new in-laws that she’s all in on this England idea. For another: taxes. Americans living abroad remain subject to U.S. tax laws, even if they have dual citizenship. As The Washington Post explained shortly after Harry and Meghan’s engagement, this technicality risks exposing the royal family’s notoriously private financial records to a wide audience in the form of IRS review or (illegal) leaks.\n\nA more direct parallel for Meghan is the Philadelphia-born actress Grace Kelly, who retained her U.S. citizenship when she became Princess of Monaco.\n\n96\n\nWill Meghan and Prince Harry’s future children have dual English and American citizenship? — Luna Maduro, The Netherlands\n\n“English” citizenship doesn’t technically exist; “British citizen” is the designation applied to individuals from England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Even if Meghan and Harry’s kids aren’t born in the United Kingdom, they’ll still be British citizens “by descent.” Assuming Meghan does not renounce her U.S. citizenship, they’ll also be U.S. citizens, regardless of where they’re born. They may choose to opt out of either citizenship as adults. (The U.S. government considers renunciation requests from minors as young as 16, but the state department website ominously notes that such requests are “afforded very careful consideration.” The British government accepts renunciation requests from individuals under 18 only if they are married.)\n\nPrince Albert II of Monaco, born a dual citizen of Monaco and the U.S. thanks to his American mother, Grace Kelly, renounced his U.S. citizenship at age 21 — perhaps in anticipation of his role as Monaco’s sovereign. (There’s a possibility Harry or Meghan’s child could one day become head of the British monarchy, but it’s unlikely. See Question 24 for more on that.)\n\n97\n\nCould a child of Harry and Meghan become president of the United States?\n\nYes, as long as:\n\n* Meghan does not renounce her U.S. citizenship before he or she is born.\n\n* The child lives as a resident of the United States for at least 14 years.\n\n* Legislators maintain the definition of “natural born citizen” (a term used in Article II of the Constitution, outlining requirements for presidential eligibility) as a person on whom citizenship was automatically conferred at birth, rather than adopting the more narrow definition occasionally proposed of a person who was born on American soil. (Obviously, in the unlikely event the would-be president is born on American soil, this part won’t be an issue.)\n\n98\n\nDid Sarah Ferguson attend the wedding?\n\nShe was! While the Duchess of York told Oprah she was not invited to her nephew William’s wedding (she booked a stay at a Thailand resort to avoid being in town during the festivities), Harry is said to be close with the Duchess’s daughter Eugenie, who announced her own engagement in January and, in April, moved next door to Harry and Meghan in Kensington Palace with her fiancé. Ferguson’s blanket exclusion from official royal events can be traced to her 1996 divorce from Prince Andrew, but since Harry and Meghan’s wedding is not a state occasion, they had a little leeway with the guest list.\n\n99\n\nWhat were the bobbies wearing in Windsor the day of the wedding?\n\nThames Valley Police\n\n100\n\nWhat were the bobbies be wearing … from behind?\n\nThames Valley Police\n\n101\n\nWhere did the couple stay the night before the wedding?\n\nThe couple kept things traditional and stayed in separate hotels the night before the wedding. Meghan stayed with her mother at Cliveden House Hotel, roughly nine miles from Windsor and the site of one of the biggest scandals in 20th century British politics. Harry stayed at Coworth Park in Ascot, with brother William on hand to allay any last minute nerves.\n\n102\n\nWhat’s the deal with Meghan’s dad, Thomas Markle?\n\nIn the end he did not give Meghan away or attend the wedding. On May 17, Meghan issued a statement saying “Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding. I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.”\n\nHere’s a little background on the drama that preceded the May 17 announcement:\n\nOn May 4, a Kensington Palace news release stated that Meghan’s divorced father, Thomas, who has yet to meet Prince Harry or any other members of the royal family, would walk his daughter down the aisle at her wedding.\n\nNine days later, on May 13, The Daily Mail published images and footage it identified as originating from closed-circuit security cameras that appeared to show Mr. Markle posing for fake-candid photos of himself for a British paparazzi photographer. The resulting pictures depicted Mr. Markle scrolling through Meghan and Harry’s official engagement photos on a desktop computer at an internet cafe, and were part of a series of recently published photos of Mr. Markle purporting to catch him going about his daily life unawares. Kensington Palace did not comment on the photos, or the accusations of staging.\n\nOn May 14, TMZ reported that Mr. Markle admitted to a TMZ representative that he had staged the photos. TMZ also wrote that Mr. Markle claimed to have suffered a heart attack six days prior, and that he informed the celebrity news agency of his intention to skip Meghan and Harry’s wedding.\n\nKensington Palace appeared to have been surprised by Mr. Markle’s remarks to TMZ, which were published at 6:35 p.m. London time. Reuters reported that a spokesman responded to initial requests for comment by stating “We have got nothing on this at the moment.”\n\nShortly before 9 p.m. local time on May 14, a spokesman for Kensington Palace released the following statement to reporters: “This is a deeply personal moment for Ms. Markle in the days before her wedding. She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr. Markle in this difficult situation.”\n\nOn Tuesday, May 15, the circumstances surrounding Thomas Markle’s participation in the wedding became even murkier when TMZ published a new story claiming Mr. Markle had changed his mind about not attending. In an update that might be characterized as frenetic, TMZ reported that Mr. Markle was currently re-hospitalized for chest pains, was asking his doctors to release him by Wednesday, had walked back his own criticism of his collaboration with the paparazzi, had missed a call from Meghan but received a text message expressing her love and concern, and had expressed a renewed desire to walk Meghan down the aisle. TMZ quoted him as saying both “I hate the idea of missing one of the greatest moments in history and walking my daughter down the aisle,” and “Of course I’d walk her down the aisle. This is a historic moment. I’d like to be a part of history.”\n\nAs for how his daughter’s future in-laws might be responding to his recent behavior, Mr. Markle reportedly said, “I don't think the Queen is thinking about what I'm doing.” Ha.\n\n103\n\nSo who walked Meghan down the aisle?\n\nPrince Charles!\n\n“Ms. Meghan Markle has asked His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales to accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St. George’s Chapel on her wedding day,” read a statement from Kensington Palace the day before the event.\n\nThere had been speculation that Meghan’s mother Doria would walk her down the aisle. Doria wdidill, however, accompany her daughter from the Cliveden House Hotel (where she and Meghan stayed on Friday night) to St. George’s Chapel on the wedding day.\n\n104\n\nBy the way, what else happened on May 19?\n\nThe F.A. Cup final, the most important soccer match of the year in Britain. It’s like holding the Academy Awards at the same time as the Super Bowl. #awkward\n\nEdited by Anya Strzemien and Bonnie Wertheim.

The F.A.Q. also misstated the length of the train on Kate Middleton's wedding gown. It was nine feet long, not 25. And, finally (forgive us!), the F.A.Q. misstated the branch of Christianity to which Meghan Markle is converting. It is Anglicanism, not Anglicism.\n\nMore on NYTimes.com\n\nAdvertisement"
