        "text": "As somebody with Swedish ancestry, I’ve increasingly found myself intrigued by Swedish history and cooking. While vintage shopping I was thrilled to stumble across The Princesses Cook Book, known as Princessornas Kokbok in Sweeden, first published in 1930. The author, Jenny Åkerström, dedicated the book to sisters Princess Margaret of Denmark, Crown Princess Martha of Norway and Crown Princess Astrid of Belgium. The princesses were students at Mrs. Åkerström’s cooking school in Stockholm and are said to have been the inspiration behind the famous green Princess Cake that is still popular in Sweden. A recipe for the cake appeared in the cookbook’s first edition, but unfortunately did not make it into the pages of the American version.\n\nThe Swedish princesses featured on the cover of the book were the daughters of Prince Carl of Sweden, the Duke of Vastergotland, and his wife, Princess Ingeborg of Denmark. They raised the girls with a strong sense of compassion for the sick, poor and less fortunate. In addition to cooking at Mrs. Åkerström’s school, they were also educated in nursing and childcare. The Duke and his wife urged their daughters to marry for love. Princess Martha married her first cousin, Crown Prince Olav of Norway, thus uniting two Scandinavian royal families. As the new Crown Princess of Norway, Martha put her education to use by becoming involved with charities. The public admired her devotion to both her country and her family. Princess Astrid went on to become Queen of Belgium after meeting and falling in love with King Leopold III. When they married, the Belgian people took to calling her the “snow queen” for her Scandinavian beauty. Astrid also became involved with charity, arranging donations for the unemployed during the depression in the 1930s. Princess Margaretha, the eldest of the three, became Princess of Denmark after her marriage to Prince Axel of Denmark. Like her sisters, Margaretha was well liked by the public and took part in charitable organizations.\n\nPhoto of the three Swedish princesses – Margareta, Märta and Astrid – 1910.

Consideration has been given both to the ordinary food preparation in the home and to more elaborate service. For this reason directions for simplifying or elaborating a recipe are in many instances added. To make the recipes practical and easy to follow the metric weights commonly used in Sweden, have been converted into American measurements.”\n\nI chose to make a recipe entitled Lamb Stew with Pears. The concept sounded intriguing and very “autumn” to me. When reading through the recipe, a few things caught my attention. The ingredients list “lamb breast,” a cut which I could not find at any of my local butchers. Instead I used lamb shoulder meat, which I’ve used in the past in stews with great success. As I perused the recipe, I felt that some of the methods might lend themselves to blandness… there was no searing of the meat, which sacrifices a lot of flavor. In essence, the ingredients are simply simmered together. The next recipe in the book, Lamb Stew with Rice, seemed to have a more flavorful preparation method. I decided to combine elements of the two recipes (seen below) to make a more flavorful Lamb Stew with Pears. There seemed to be far too many pears and potatoes for an average sized Dutch oven or heavy pot, so I cut those down a bit. I added an herb “bouquet” and sauteed onion/garlic to the mix, and I did end up searing the meat, which gave the stew lots of brown bits and a gorgeous aroma.\n\nThe result was a tender and really flavorful stew. I arranged the meat on a platter surrounded by pears and green beans. It made an impressive presentation… truly a dish fit for a Swedish princess.
