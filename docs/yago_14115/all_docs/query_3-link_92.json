        "text": "While King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia enjoyed a snow-covered break in Jämtland County, Sweden's future queen Crown Princess Victoria reportedly flew under the radar to a Spanish island with her family.\n\nThe royal, 46, and her husband, Prince Daniel, 50, and their two children, Princess Estelle, 12, and Prince Oscar, eight, spent the Easter break in Palma, Mallorca.\n\nAccording to HELLO!'s sister publication, HOLA! the family-of-four had lunch at the Mar de Nudos restaurant on Monday. The open-air venue, overlooking the marina, offers a fusion of Mediterranean and Japanese dishes.\n\nVictoria and Daniel are set to return to their royal duties on Monday 8 April when they will attend a diplomatic reception with the king and queen.\n\nTheir children, who attend Campus Manilla on Royal Djurgården in Stockholm, usually appear with their parents at major royal events throughout the year.\n\nEstelle and Oscar joined Victoria and Daniel on the Crown Princess' name day at the Royal Palace on 12 March.\n\nProud mum Victoria was seen putting her arm around her daughter Estelle during one sweet moment as the family watched the ceremony in the palace courtyard.\n\nLike Crown Princes Victoria, Estelle is a future queen of Sweden and she is the first female in Swedish history to be born with a right to inherit the crown that cannot be superseded by the birth of a male heir, as well as the first person in Swedish history to be born of a female heir apparent.\n\nVictoria's younger brother, Prince Carl Philip was heir to the throne for seven months until 1 January 1980 when the law of on order of succession came into effect. Crown Princess Victoria was two years old at the time and as the eldest child of King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia, she became heir apparent.\n\nThere has been much change around the Swedish monarchy in recent years with King Carl XVI Gustaf stripped five of his grandchildren of their royal titles to strictly associate Swedish royalty to the office of the head of state.\n\nAs of November 2019, Princess Madeleine's children Leonore, Nicolas and Adrienne, and Prince Carl Philip's sons, Alexander and Gabriel are no longer styled His/Her Royal Highness.\n\nPrince Carl Philip and Princess Sofia's third son, Prince Julian, was born in 2021 without royal status"
