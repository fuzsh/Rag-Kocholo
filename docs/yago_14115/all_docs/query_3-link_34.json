        "text": "Silvia (born Dec. 23, 1943, Heidelberg, Ger.) is the queen consort of Sweden (1976– ), wife of King Carl XVI Gustaf.\n\nSilvia was born in Heidelberg, Ger., to a Brazilian mother and German father. When she was three years old, her family moved to São Paulo, where she spent much of her childhood. After they returned to West Germany in 1957, Silvia completed her schooling, receiving a degree in Spanish in 1969 from the Munich School of Interpreting. Following graduation she worked at the Argentine consulate in Munich and served as hostess at the 1972 Olympic Games, where she met Carl Gustaf, who was then crown prince of Sweden. After a courtship spanning some four years—during which time Carl Gustaf was enthroned (1973)—the couple married on June 19, 1976. They had three children: Crown Princess Victoria (b. July 14, 1977), Prince Carl Philip (b. May 13, 1979), and Princess Madeleine (b. June 10, 1982)."
