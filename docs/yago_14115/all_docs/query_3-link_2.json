        "text": "Heir apparent to the Swedish throne (born 1977)\n\n\"Victoria of Sweden\" redirects here. For the 20th-century queen of Sweden, see Victoria of Baden.\n\nVictoria, Crown Princess of Sweden, Duchess of Västergötland (Victoria Ingrid Alice Désirée; born 14 July 1977) is the heir apparent to the Swedish throne, as the eldest child of King Carl XVI Gustaf. If she ascends to the throne as expected, she would be Sweden’s fourth queen regnant (after Margaret, Christina and Ulrika Eleonora) and the first since 1720. Her inheritance is secured by Sweden’s 1979 Act of Succession, the first law in Western Europe to adopt royal absolute primogeniture.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nVictoria was born on 14 July 1977 at 21:45 CET[1] at the Karolinska Hospital in Solna, Stockholm County, Sweden, and is the oldest child of King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia. She is a member of the House of Bernadotte. Born as a princess of Sweden, she was designated crown princess in 1979 (SFS 1979:932) ahead of her younger brother. Her place as first in the line of succession formally went into effect on 1 January 1980 with the parliamentary change to the Act of Succession that introduced absolute primogeniture.\n\nHer given name, Victoria Ingrid Alice Désirée, honours various relatives. Her first name comes primarily from her great-great-grandmother Victoria of Baden, queen consort of Sweden. Her other names honour her great-aunt Ingrid of Sweden; her maternal grandmother, Alice Soares de Toledo; her ancestor Désirée Clary, queen consort of Sweden; and her paternal aunt and godmother, Princess Désirée.\n\nShe was baptised at the Royal Palace Church on 27 September 1977. Her godparents were Crown Prince Harald of Norway (later king of Norway), her maternal uncle, Ralf Sommerlath, Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands (later queen of the Netherlands, 1980–2013), and her aunt Princess Désirée, Baroness Silfverschiöld. The Crown Princess was confirmed in the summer of 1992 at Räpplinge church on the island of Öland.[2]\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nVictoria studied for a year (1996–97) at the Catholic University of the West at Angers in France, and in the fall term of 1997 participated in a special program following the work of the Riksdag. From 1998 to 2000, Victoria resided in the United States, where she studied various subjects at Yale University.[3]\n\nIn May 1999, she was an intern at the Swedish Embassy in Washington, D.C. Victoria completed a study program at the Government Offices in 2001.[2] In 2003, Victoria's education continued with visits to Swedish businesses, a study and intern program in agriculture and forestry, as well as completion of the basic soldier training at SWEDINT (the Swedish Armed Forces International Centre).[4]\n\nIn 2006, Victoria enrolled in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs' Diplomat Program, running from September 2006 to June 2007. The program is a training program for young future diplomats and gives an insight to the ministry's work, Swedish foreign and security policies and Sweden's relations with the rest of the world.[2] In June 2009, she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Uppsala University.\n\nShe speaks Swedish, English, French and German.[5][6]\n\nIt has been announced that the Crown Princess will start doing officer training at the Swedish Defence University in late 2024. This training will take around 20 months to complete and has the goal of teaching the Crown Princess about military strategy and tactics, as well as preparing her for her future role as Head of State which includes representing the Armed Forces.[7]\n\nChange in status\n\n[edit]\n\nVictoria was made crown princess on 1 January 1980 by the 1979 amendment to the Act of Succession of 1810 (Successionsordningen). This constitutional amendment introduced absolute primogeniture, meaning that the throne would be inherited by the monarch's eldest child regardless of gender. King Carl XVI Gustaf objected to the reform after it occurred—not because he objected to women entering the line of succession, but because he was upset about his son being stripped of the crown prince status he had held since birth.[8]\n\nWhen she became heir, she also was made Duchess of Västergötland, one of the historical provinces of Sweden. Prior to this constitutional change, the heir apparent to the throne was her younger brother, Carl Philip. He is now fourth in line to the throne, behind Victoria and her children.\n\nPublic life\n\n[edit]\n\nVictoria's declaration of majority took place in the Hall of State at the Royal Palace of Stockholm on 14 July 1995. As of the day she turned 18, she became eligible to act as Head of State when the King is not in country. Victoria made her first public speech on this occasion promising allegiance to her father the King and to uphold the laws and constitution of Sweden. Located on the dais in the background was the same silver throne on which her father was seated at his enthronement, in actual use from 1650 and up until this ceremony.[9]\n\nAs heir apparent to the throne, Victoria is a working member of the Swedish Royal Family with her own agenda of official engagements. Victoria attends the regular Advisory Council on Foreign Affairs and the information councils with Government ministers headed by the King, and steps in as a temporary regent (Riksföreståndare) when needed.\n\nVictoria has made many official trips abroad as a representative of Sweden. Her first major official visit on her own was to Japan in 2001, where she promoted Swedish tourism, design, music, gastronomy and environmental sustainability during the \"Swedish Style\" event. That same year, Victoria also travelled to the West Coast of the United States, where she participated in the celebrations of the Nobel centenary.\n\nIn 2002, she paid official visits to United States, Spain, Uganda, Ethiopia, and Kosovo where she visited Camp Victoria. In 2003, she made official visits to Egypt and the United States. In early 2004, she paid an official visit to Saudi Arabia, as a part of a large official business delegation from Sweden, and in October 2004, she travelled to Hungary.\n\nCrown Princess Victoria was given her own household in October 2004.[10] It is headed by the Marshal of the Court, and serves to coordinate the official engagements of The Crown Princess.\n\nIn January 2005, Victoria made a long official visit to Australia, promoting Swedish style and businesses, and in April she visited Bangladesh and Sri Lanka to follow aid work and become informed about the work in the aftermath of the tsunami. In April 2005, Victoria made an official visit to Japan where she visited the Expo 2005 in Aichi, laid the foundation for a new IKEA store in Yokohama together with Princess Takamado and met with Emperor Akihito, Empress Michiko, Crown Prince Naruhito and Sayako Kuroda. In June 2005, Victoria travelled to Turkey on an official visit where she participated in the Swedish Business Seminar and Sweden Day celebrations in Ankara during a historic visit, which was organised by the Swedish Embassy in Ankara and Swedish Trade Council in Istanbul. Victoria also visited the historic sights such as the Blue Mosque, Topkapı Palace and Hagia Sophia. This was the first official Royal visit from Sweden to Turkey since 1934. In September 2005, she made an official visit to China.\n\nIn March 2006, Victoria made an official visit to Brazil where she followed the Volvo Ocean Race and visited projects supported by the World Childhood Foundation, such as the Abrigo Rainha Sílvia. In December, she paid a four-day official visit to Paris where she attended a French-Swedish soirée arranged by the Swedish Chamber of Commerce, the Swedish Trade Council and the Swedish Embassy, during which she also awarded the Prix d’Excellence 2006. The visit to Paris also included events with the Swedish Club in Paris, attendance at a church service in the Sofia Church (the Swedish church in Paris), a study visit to the OECD headquarters and meetings with the Secretary-General José Ángel Gurría, the Swedish Ambassador to the OECD, Gun-Britt Andersson, and other senior officials. She also attended a gala dinner hosted by La Fondation Pour L’Enfance at Versailles.\n\nShe is a member of the Honorary Board of the International Paralympic Committee.[11]\n\nIn 2011, it was announced that Victoria would continue working throughout her pregnancy. In 2012, she took her maternity leave one day prior to the birth of her daughter Estelle[12] and her husband Daniel revealed that he would take his paternity leave and switch parental roles with Victoria when Estelle began preschool.[13]\n\nIn January 2016, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon appointed the crown princess as a member of Sustainable Development Goals Advocates for Agenda 2030.[14] The crown princess is therefore one of 16 ambassadors in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Advocacy Group.[14] The group's task is to promote the UN's Sustainable Development Goals – Agenda 2030 – in various ways. The Crown Princess primarily works with issues concerning water and health.[14]\n\nWhen Social Democrat Magdalena Andersson was elected as Swedens first female prime minister in 2021, Victoria stated that it was “about time” and that Andersson would become an “important symbol”. [15]\n\nWhen Sweden became a member of NATO in 2024, the crown princess attended Sweden's flag-raising ceremony outside the NATO Headquarters in Brussels.[16]\n\nThe Crown Princess Victoria's Fund\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Crown Princess Victoria's Fund was set up in 1997 and is run as a part of Radiohjälpen, the fundraising branch of Sveriges Television and Sveriges Radio. The fund's aim is to provide support for leisure and recreational activities for children and young people with functional disabilities or chronic illnesses.\n\nThe Crown Princess Victoria Fund's means mainly derive from donations by the public, but large companies such as Arla Foods, Swedbank and AB Svenska Returpack are constant sponsor partners. Additional support comes from The Association of Swedish Bakers & Confectioners who every year arrange a national “princess cake week” during which the participating cafés and bakeries give 2.50 SEK per sold princess pastry and 10 SEK per sold princess cake to the fund.[17] The result of this fund-raising drive is usually presented to Victoria herself on her name day on 12 March every year; in 2007, the total amount was 200,000 SEK. Congratulatory and memorial cards are also issued by Radiohjälpen benefitting the fund, a simple way to pay respects and do a good deed in one act. In 2006, The Crown Princess Victoria Fund raised a total of 5.5 million SEK.[17]\n\nEvery year Victoria visits one or several clubs or projects that have been granted money. These visits are not announced via the official royal diary but kept private; instead Sveriges Television often accompanies her and airs short programs from these visits at some time during the year.[18]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nVictoria's first boyfriend was Daniel Collert. They socialised in the same circles, went to the same school and were already friends when their romance developed in the mid-1990s. When Victoria moved to the United States in 1998 to study and recover from her eating disorders, Collert moved with her and settled in New York.[19] In September 2000, Victoria's relationship with Collert was confirmed in an interview with her at Expo 2000.[20] The relationship ended in 2001.\n\nIn May 2002, Swedish newspaper Expressen reported that Victoria had a new boyfriend, her personal trainer at Master Training, Daniel Westling. When the news broke and the media turned its attention on him, it was obvious that he did not like being in the public eye. Once Westling was photographed crossing a street against a red light in order to avoid a camera.[21] In July 2002, Victoria and Westling were pictured kissing for the first time[22] at a birthday party for Caroline Kreuger, a close friend of Victoria's.\n\nIn a popular personal report called Tre dagar med Victoria, which profiled her work during a three-day period that aired on TV4 in December 2004, Victoria commented on criticism directed at Westling, \"Many unfair things are written. I understand that there is speculation, but some day justice will be done there, too.\" Victoria also gave her opinion that happiness is important, and that these days it is not so much about background and pedigree but about two people who have to live with each other. She said that if they are not happy and comfortable with each other, it is impossible to do a good job.[23]\n\nEngagement\n\n[edit]\n\nSwedish media often speculated about upcoming engagements and marriages for Victoria. On 24 February 2009, rumours that wedding plans were imminent became particularly intense preceding an information council between the King and Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt.[24] Under the terms of the Swedish Act of Succession, the Government, upon the request of the King, gives the final consent for a dynastic marriage of a prince or princess of Sweden. The prince or princess otherwise loses their right to the throne. Later that day, it was confirmed that permission had been granted and that Victoria would marry Westling in the summer of 2010. The wedding date was set in Stockholm Cathedral for 19 June 2010, the 34th anniversary of her parents' marriage.[25] Her engagement ring features a solitaire round brilliant-cut diamond mounted on white gold.[26]\n\nMarriage, motherhood and children\n\n[edit]\n\nThe wedding took place on 19 June 2010. Guests including royalty and ambassadors from various countries were invited to the wedding ceremony which took place at Stockholm Cathedral. After the wedding the newlyweds were driven through Stockholm in a coach and then rowed in the antique royal barge Vasaorden to the royal palace where the wedding banquet was held. On the evening before the wedding, there was a gala concert dedicated to the couple in the Stockholm Concert Hall.\n\nThe couple have two children:\n\nPrincess Estelle Silvia Ewa Mary, Duchess of Östergötland (born on 23 February 2012 in Karolinska University Hospital, Solna).[27][28]\n\nPrince Oscar Carl Olof, Duke of Skåne (born on 2 March 2016 in Karolinska University Hospital, Solna).[29][30]\n\nOften referred to as the \"Godmother of Europe\", Crown Princess Victoria is the godmother of eighteen children:[citation needed]\n\nVivien Sommerlath (born 1995), Crown Princess Victoria's cousin as the daughter of Queen Silvia's brother Jörg Sommerlath.[31]\n\nGiulia Sommerlath (born 1996), Crown Princess Victoria's cousin as the daughter of Queen Silvia's nephew Thomas Sommerlath.[31]\n\nPrince Constantine Alexios of Greece and Denmark (born 1998), son of Pavlos, Crown Prince of Greece and grandson of King Constantine II of Greece.[32]\n\nMadeleine von Dincklage (born 1999), daughter of Crown Princess Victoria's cousin Baroness Sybilla von Dincklage (née Ambler) and granddaughter of Princess Margaretha, Mrs. Ambler.[31]\n\nIan de Geer (born 2002), son of Crown Princess Victoria's cousin Baroness Christina-Louise Silfverschiöld and grandson of Princess Désirée, Baroness Silfverschiöld.[31]\n\nLeopold Sommerlath (born 2002), son of Crown Princess Victoria's cousin Patrick Sommerlath and grandson of Queen Silvia's brother Walther Sommerlath.[31]\n\nIan Persson (born 2003), son of Crown Princess Victoria's friends H&M CEO Karl-Johan Persson and Leonie Gillberg.\n\nCatharina-Amalia, Princess of Orange (born 2003), daughter of King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands and heir apparent to the throne of the Netherlands.[33]\n\nPrincess Ingrid Alexandra of Norway (born 2004), daughter of Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway and granddaughter of King Harald V of Norway.[34]\n\nChristian, Crown Prince of Denmark (born 2005), son of King Frederik X of Denmark and grandson of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark.[35]\n\nDiana Engsäll (born 2007), daughter of Crown Princess Victoria's friends Andrea Brodin and Niclas Engsäll.[36]\n\nWillem Dinkelspiel (born 2007), son of Crown Princess Victoria's friends Caroline and Peder Dinkelspiel.[37]\n\nPrincess Eléonore of Belgium (born 2008), daughter of King Philippe of Belgium and Crown Princess Victoria's fourth cousin.[38]\n\nChloé Nilsson (born 2008), daughter of Crown Princess Victoria's friends Caroline Kreuger and Jesper Nilsson.[31]\n\nPrincess Katharina of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (born 2014), daughter of Hubertus, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and granddaughter of Andreas, Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.[39]\n\nPrincess Leonore, Duchess of Gotland (born 2014), Crown Princess Victoria's niece as the daughter of Princess Madeleine, Duchess of Hälsingland and Gästrikland.[citation needed]\n\nDésirée Magnusson (born 2015), daughter of Crown Princess Victoria's cousin Gustaf Magnusson and granddaughter of Princess Christina, Mrs. Magnuson.[31]\n\nPrince Alexander, Duke of Södermanland (born 2016), Crown Princess Victoria's nephew as the son of Prince Carl Philip, Duke of Värmland.[40]\n\nHealth\n\n[edit]\n\nVictoria has dyslexia, as do her father King Carl XVI Gustaf and her brother Prince Carl Philip.[41][42]\n\nIn 1996, it was established that Victoria had anorexia; this was not confirmed until the next year.[43][44] Victoria had planned to study at Uppsala University, but after intense media speculation and public discussion when pictures of an evidently emaciated Victoria in sleeveless dresses at the Order of the Innocence's ball and the gala dinner for the incoming state visit from Austria surfaced in April 1997, the Royal Court decided to confirm her condition.\n\nAfter a press release from the Royal Court in November 1997 announced that Victoria had eating disorders, she moved to the United States where she received professional treatment and studied at Yale University.[44]\n\nIn June 1999, Victoria said, \"It was a really hard time. This kind of illness is hard, not only for the individual but also for the people close to him or her. Today I'm fine.\"[43]\n\nIn November 2002, the book Victoria, Victoria! came out, speaking further about her eating disorder. Victoria said: \"I felt like an accelerating train, going right down... during the whole period. I had eating disorders and was aware of it, my anguish was enormous. I really hated how I looked like, how I was... I, Victoria, didn't exist. It felt like everything in my life and around me was controlled by others. The one thing I could control was the food I put in me\". She further said that \"What happened cost and I was the one who stood for the payments. Now I'm feeling well and with the insights I've acquired through this I can hopefully help someone else\".[45]\n\nVictoria has prosopagnosia, which makes it difficult to recognize familiar faces.[46][47][48] In an interview in 2008, she called it a \"big drawback\" in her capacity as heir to the throne.[49]\n\nTitles, styles and honours\n\n[edit]\n\nTitles\n\n[edit]\n\n14 July 1977 – 31 December 1979: Her Royal Highness Princess Victoria of Sweden\n\n1 January 1980 – 9 January 1980: Her Royal Highness The Crown Princess of Sweden\n\n9 January 1980 – present: Her Royal Highness The Crown Princess of Sweden, Duchess of Västergötland\n\nHonours\n\n[edit]\n\nNational\n\n[edit]\n\nSweden:\n\nMember and Commander of the Royal Order of the Seraphim (LoKavKMO)\n\nMember of the Royal Family Decoration of King Carl XVI Gustaf (14 July 1995)[50]\n\nRecipient of the King Carl XVI Gustaf's Jubilee Commemorative Medal IV (15 September 2023)\n\nRecipient of the King Carl XVI Gustaf's Jubilee Commemorative Medal III (30 April 2016)[51]\n\nRecipient of the King Carl XVI Gustaf's Jubilee Commemorative Medal II (23 August 2013)[50]\n\nRecipient of the King Carl XVI Gustaf's Jubilee Commemorative Medal (30 April 1996)[50]\n\nSwedish National Defence College Commemorative Medal (Försvarshögskolans minnesmedalj) (9 January 2008)[50]\n\nSwedish Soldiers Homes Association Medal in Gold no 1 (Svenska Soldathemsförbundets medalj i guld, SSHFGM) (May 2021)[52]\n\nForeign\n\n[edit]\n\nAustria: Grand Decoration of Honour in Gold with Sash of the Order Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria[53]\n\nBelgium: Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold[54]\n\nBrazil: Grand Cross of the Order of the Southern Cross[55]\n\nBulgaria: Grand Cross of the Order of the Balkan Mountains[54]\n\nChile: Grand Cross of the Order of Merit[54]\n\nDenmark: Knight of the Order of the Elephant (14 July 1995)[56]\n\nEstonia:\n\nGrand Cross of the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana[57]\n\nGrand Cross of the Order of the White Star[58]\n\nFinland: Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of the White Rose[59]\n\nFrance:\n\nGrand Cross of the Order of National Merit[54]\n\nGrand Officer of the Order of the Legion of Honour (30 January 2024)[54][60]\n\nGermany: Grand Cross 1st Class of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany[54]\n\nGreece: Grand Cross of the Order of Honour[54]\n\nIceland: Grand Cross of the Order of the Falcon[61]\n\nItaly: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic[62][63]\n\nJapan: Grand Cordon of the Order of the Chrysanthemum[54]\n\nJordan: Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance[54]\n\nLatvia: Grand Officer of the Order of the Three Stars[54]\n\nLithuania: Commander Grand Cross of the Order of Grand Duke Gediminas[64]\n\nLuxembourg: Grand Cross of the Order of Adolphe of Nassau[54]\n\nMalaysia: Honorary Grand Commander of the Order of the Defender of the Realm[65][54]\n\nMonaco:\n\nKnight of the Order of Grimaldi[citation needed]\n\nRecipient of the Prince Albert II Investiture Medal\n\nNetherlands: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Netherlands Lion (11 October 2022)\n\nNorway: Grand Cross of the Order of St. Olav (1 July 1995)[66]\n\nRomania: Grand Cross of the Order of the Star of Romania[67][68][69]\n\nSouth Korea: Grand Gwanghwa Medal of the Order of Diplomatic Service Merit[54]\n\nSpain: Dame Grand Cross of the Royal Order of Isabella the Catholic (16 November 2021)[70]\n\nTunisia: Grand Officer of the Order of the Republic[54]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of current heirs apparent\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Royal Court's official biography in Swedish and English\n\nThe Royal Court's press release about the Diplomat Program Archived 24 June 2010 at the Wayback Machine\n\nRadiohjälpen's official website for Victoria Fund\n\nVideo on YouTube, Announcement of Victoria and Daniel Westling's engagement, 2009-02-24."
