        "text": "Princess Ingeborg of Denmark |Wedding gifts and royal jewels\n\nRoyal Marriage Presents | Princess Ingeborg of Denmark | Princess Charles of Sweden and Norway\n\nThe wedding of Princess Ingeborg of Denmark, second daughter of the Crown Prince, and Charles of Sweden and Norway to King Oscar of Sweden’s third son, and is a second cousin of the bride, whose mother, nee Princess Louise of Sweden, is the only daughter of the late King Charles XV. took place in the Christianborg Palace Church August 27th 1897.\n\nThe party drove from the Amalienborg Palace to the church and the bride looked of charming white satin and blazed with diamonds.\n\nA danish bride has no bridesmaids, unlike our English Princesses, who never wear more ornaments on their wedding day than string of pearls and stars to fasten their veils, the Danish Princess heaped the jewels, of which she bad given a bountiful share as gifts, until no more be added......\n\nThere was a brilliant assemblage of guests, which included the members of the Danish and Swedish Royal families, the Dowager Empress of Russia and the Princess of Wales.\n\nThe city was decorated with flags, and on leaving the church the bridge and bridegroom met with an enthusiastic reception from the people, who had assembled in large numbers.\n\nThe Empress Dowager Russia wore white mint and pearls. The Princess of wales in light flowered silk, with front, and diamonds. The Crown Princess of Denmark wore satin with diamonds, and the Crown Princess Sweden was in pale blue silk with pearls.\n\nQueen Louise wore heliotrope satin. The Grand Duchess Olga looked well in rose-coloured\n\nAfter the there was reception the Christian VII. followed at. five o’clock by a Royal family dinner in the Knights’ Hall.\n\nThe Empress sat at the right hand of King Christian, and the Princess of Wales at his left side, just opposite to the bride and bridegroom.\n\nThe newly married couple left the palace for the pier, where they embarked board the Danish Royal yacht which sailed early next morning for Luebeck.\n\nOn the night before the wedding the King and Queen of Denmark gave State banquet their own palace to 320 guests.\n\nThe presents were magnificent, including valuable jewellery, plate, china, pictures, old furniture, and all kinds of objects of art\n\nThe Prince and Princess Wales gave a diadem of diamonds and turquoises, and the\n\nDuke and Duchess of Cumberland sent a necklace (bracelets?) of diamonds and sapphires, which is much admired.\n\nA riviere of diamonds is seen on her bridal bodice as ornament.\n\nShe wore also a brooch of a fleur de lys in diamonds and a large pearl which was later inherit of her daughter Astrid Queen of Belgium and worne by Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxemburg - and picture on Princess Ingeborg>>\n\nThe bridal necklace of diamonds with dimond fringes, was a wedding gift and also wearable as head-ornament and aigrette. Princess Ragnhild wore a fringe necklace and earpendants, in her late days which reminds a lot of these jewel.\n\nThe danish newspaper noted the royal wedding gifts and presents:\n\nA large diamond brooch wich is also wearable as tiara from the danish King and Queen Luise, as well as a tiara of diamonds with a large emerald.\n\nA brooch of emeralds with brillants from Prince Christian, Prince Harald, Princess Louise, Princess Carl, Prince Gustav, Princess Dagmar und Prince Friederich of Schaumburg Lippe and Princess Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.\n\nA riviere of diamonds and five large diamonds wich are changeable to the necklace - from the Crown Princess and Crown Prince of Denmark.\n\nA Bracelet of gold with brillants and rubies from Crown Prince and Crown Princess of Sweden and Norway .\n\nA Bracelet of gold with brillants and sapphieres from Grand Duke Michael and Grand Duchess Olga.\n\nThe King of Siam send a hammered gold with rubies, from\n\nPrince Thira of Siam an antique watch with bow and loops of diamonds.\n\nPrincess Victoria of England presented a brooch of diamonds and pearls.\n\nPrince Valdemar and Princess Marie gives a jardiniere of silver.\n\nPrince Carl of Sweden-Norway, gives his bride a gold bracelet with pearls and sapphires. In the spring he has presented to his bride a diamond necklace and a necklace of pearls.\n\nA turquoise star tiara>> was probably - the wedding present to Princess Ingeborg of Denmark from her first cousin, Tsar Nikolaj II of Russia, when she married Prince Carl of Sweden and Norway in 1897, noted from Trond Norén Isaksen.\n\nPrincess Ingeborg was close to her Russian relatives and there were supposedly many letters from the last Tsar in the suitcases filled with her correspondence which were burned following her death.\n\nDuring her own lifetime Princess Ingeborg often lent her tiaras to female relatives, which explains why the star tiara was worn by Crown Princess Märtha for a dinner in the Norwegian Club in London in 1937 and for the 80th birthday of King Gustaf V of Sweden the following year.\n\nAfter Princess Ingeborg’s sudden death in 1958, this turqoise diamond star tiara was inherited by her eldest daughter, Princess Margaretha of Denmark. When she died in 1977 it became the property of her youngest daughter-in-law, Countess Ruth of Rosenborg.\n\nA few years ago Countess Ruth gave the tiara to her eldest son Axel’s wife, Countess Jutta of Rosenborg, with the intention that it shall in future be inherited by the eldest son in each generation to designate the line descending from the late Prince Axel of Denmark.\n\nThus one can expect its next wearer to be Sidsel Lykke Nielsen, the fiancée of Countess Jutta’s stepson Carl Johan.\n\nThe bride had a dowry of two and a-half million francs. The Crown Princess of Denmark inherited an immens fortune from her father, King Charles of Sweden, and her mother, Friderica Louise of the Netherlands, and it hat been greatly increased since her marriage in 1869 careful management.\n\nThe Princess Charles ....One of the dresses in Princess Ingeborg of Denmark's trousseau which accomplishes most in the matter of beauty is a yellowish-brown velvet tail-colour, really with embroideries of turquoise and silver, bordered by narrow edgings of sable.\n\nAnother, in the national colouring of blue and yellow, is most skilfully harmonised, the dull powder-blue miroir velvet of which it is made toning well with a pouched bodice of soft amber mousseline, over which an embroidered bolero of the velvet is worn.\n\nTrains of immense length are worn at the Swedish Court, and fashions may come or go, but the trailing drapery remains. Five yards in length of material is by no means an unusual allowance to drag after one on the floor, and the ensuing complications of chairs and tables must play quite a consider able part in excitements at the Court. Princess Ingeborg's bridal train is the shortest in her trousseau, and that is twelve feet in length. Most of the evening-gowns are fourteen feet from waist to the end of train.\n\nCherry-colour in shades of varying brightness is on the list of winter colours, and one of the Danish Princess's most striking gowns is a magnificent Lyons velvet in bright cerise, trimmed with heavy gold embroideries. The train of this really regal gown is fifteen feet long. But what a weight to carry-\n\nSources:The Sketch;Carlisle Patriot,Cheltenham Looker-On; Mid Sussex Times;Holstebro statsbiblioteket Denmark;\n\n::::::::::::::\n\nPrincess Ragnhild of Norway| Royal Boucheron Pearl and Diamond Loop Tiara|Circlet Diadem\n\nPrincess Ingeborg of Sweden | Royal Boucheron Pearl and Diamond Loop Tiara| Circlet Diadem\n\nPrincess Ingrid Alexandra of Norway | Royal Boucheron Loop Pearl and Diamond Tiara| Royal Jewel History ,Diadem Circlet\n\nPrincess Margarethe of Denmark |Prinzessin Margarethe von Dänemark| Royal Jewels Tiara\n\n>\n\nRoyal Jewels | Nassau Empire Schmuck von Prinzessin Astrid von Norwegen\n\nHerzogin Pauline von Nassau Empire Schmuck Parure | Duchess of Nassau Royal Jewels\n\nPrincess Astrid of Norway | Turquoise Stars | Queen Maud Jewels | Royal Turquoises\n\nTürkisschmuck von Königin Maud von Norwegen | Diadem, Halsband, Armband, Broschen, Choker, Sterne mit Türkisen besetzt\n\nRoyal Wedding Gifts and Jewel Present | Maud of Wales |Queen of Norway\n\nQueen Maud of Norway Royal Jewels | Coronation Jewellery\n\nPrincess Ingeborg | Princess Carl of Sweden and Norway | Fringe Necklace Tiara Diadem of Diamonds | Prinzessin Ingeborg Diamant Schmuck\n\nPrincess Ingeborg of Denmark | Royal Wedding Gifts and Jewel Presents\n\nNorwegen Schmuck des Königshauses\n\nSmaragd Tiara Prinzessin Ingeborg von Schweden | Grossherzogin Stephanie von Baden - Smaragd Halsband Tiara - Parure\n\neine weitere Tochter der Herzogin Pauline von Nassau:\n\nPrinzessin Helene von Nassau Schmuck | Fürstin zu Waldeck-Pyrmont | Familienschmuck\n\n::::::::::::::"
