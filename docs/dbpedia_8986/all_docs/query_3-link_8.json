        "text": "Jeff LaBar, guitarist for hair band Cinderella, has died, his son announced on social media Wednesday.\n\nSon Sebastian LaBar didn’t provide details or a cause of death: “So i just got the call … @jefflabar, my father, my hero, my idol, passed away today. I’m currently at a loss for words. I love you pop!”\n\nLaBar was 58. He’d joined Cinderella, formed in Philadelphia, in 1985. Others in the band are singer Tom Keifer, bassist Eric Brittingham and drummer Fred Coury.\n\nThose bandmates released a statement to several media outlets: “Heavy hearts cannot begin to describe the feeling of losing our brother Jeff. The bond between us over decades of creating music and touring the world is something that we as a band uniquely shared. Those memories with Jeff will be forever alive in our hearts. It’s unimaginable that one of our band brothers has left us. We’re sending his wife Debinique, his son Sebastian, family, and friends our deepest condolences.”\n\nThe band was hot in the 1980s-’90s during the heyday of glam rock, releasing four albums.\n\nFrom Rolling Stone: Their sophomore album, 1988′s “Long Cold Winter,” contained their biggest hit, “Don’t Know What You Got (Till It’s Gone).” The power ballad hit Number 12 on Billboard Hot 100. The LP tipped to frontman Tom Keifer’s penchant for blues rock, which continued to flavor their final two albums, 1990′s Heartbreak Station and 1994′s Still Climbing. In between, Keifer lost his voice due to vocal cord issues. Cinderella went on hiatus in 1995.\n\nMembers have had solo projects but haven’t played together as Cinderella in several years."
