Before long, Dan was wowing judges at school jazz competitions with not only his drum skills, but his work on guitar and piano. While still in high school, he won the prestigious Berklee College of Music “Outstanding Musicianship” award.\n\nAfter a long stint on the East coast doing session work and singing/performing with popular bands, Dan moved to Nashville in 1993 to focus more on his passion for writing and producing. Since the move, Dan has continued to perform live and do session work throughout Nashville including sessions on the famed “Music Row”. Once a student of vocal coach Don Lawrence (Mick Jagger, Billy Joel, Jon Bon Jovi, Bono, Christina Aguilera), Dan is best known in musician’s circles for his wide vocal range, production skills and melody driven pop songs.\n\nA gifted writer, Dan has written songs with Paul Taylor (Winger, Steve Perry, etc) and Trick Pony’s Keith Burns.
