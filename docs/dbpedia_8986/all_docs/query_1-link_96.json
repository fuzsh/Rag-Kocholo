        "text": "GREENSBURG -- You’d better believe Bret Michaels will twirl a Terrible Towel this Friday when he rocks the Palace Theatre.\n\n“Of course. Every time I play there, I bring it out on stage with me,” Michaels said.\n\nThe Butler native bleeds black and gold, as viewers of the NFL Network were reminded two weeks ago when his expert analysis popped up in an interview segment of “The NFL’s Top 100 Greatest.”\n\n“I talked about the Stillers,” Michaels said, in perfect Yinzer-ese.\n\nAlong with his favorite team’s yellow towel, Michaels will arm himself with acoustic and electric guitars in Greensburg as he and his band blast through a set of songs from his days spearheading glam-metal band Poison, along with some solo tunes.\n\nI change the arrangements of some songs to they start out acoustic but then kick into a big chorus,“ Michaels said.\n\nMichaels said he loves the Palace.\n\n“It’s such an amazing venue,” he said Wednesday in a phone interview. “We played there last year and called it our holiday show and had the best time ever. All my family and a bunch of friends were driving everyone crazy, cooking and talking in that backstage area.”\n\nHis backing band is similar from last year, including longtime guitarist Pete Evick.\n\n“He’s always in Guitar Player magazine,” Michaels said.\n\nThe bassist, Eric Brittingham, co-founded Poison’s glam-metal peers Cinderella. Rob Jozwiak plays keys, while the new drummer is Mike “Mad Dog” Bailey.\n\n“He hits it hard. A real monster on drums,” Michaels said.\n\n“They really know how to have fun on stage, as well as keeping the music sounding great. There’s so much energy. And we’re one of the last bands with no Pro Tools or click tracks. It’s just really live music.“\n\nSo whether romping through “Unskinny Bop,” the anthemic “Nothin’ But a Good Time” or power ballad “Every Rose Has Its Thorn,” Michaels and his bandmates will give their 100 percent, an ideal instilled in Michaels by his father, Wally, who worked for Armco Steel Corp. mill in Butler, and for a time at the company’s facility in Ambridge.\n\n“He taught me you want to have fun, but you have got to work hard to get it done,” Michaels said.\n\nThere’s a photo in Michaels’ autobiography “where I’m in my wood panel bedroom with a Terry Bradshaw poster over my right shoulder and a Jimmy Page poster over my left shoulder. Those were the only two posters my dad would allow me to put up on his freshly painted walls.”\n\nA military veteran, Wally Michaels died in early August at the age of 85, and his son is still reeling from the loss of a parent who felt more like a best friend.\n\n“I tell you, one of my most absolute toughest days, and so far every day has been tough, was after the Steelers-Chargers game (on Sept. 13), where I picked up the phone to call him and say, ’Hey, Dad, we got one today.’ It was surreal. I mean, I’m a have-fun-but-get-it-done kind of person, but I’m also a solutions guy, who looks to solve a problem. But this is one thing I simply can’t fix.”\n\nThough hard work can take your mind off things, and Michaels has been busy as ever, delivering a pregame concert on the eve of the Minnesota Vikings season home opener last month, then flying to Phoenix that same weekend to perform at halftime of the Arizona Cardinals game.\n\n“I’m working my way up to the Super Bowl halftime show,” Michaels said. “I figure in another 30 years, I might get a shot at it. That’ll be the dream.”\n\nWith his ambition and popularity, who knows, Michaels might make a fine special guest for the headliner of a Super Bowl’s halftime.\n\nHe did, after all, star in VH1’s high-rated reality show, \"Rock of Love with Bret Michaels.“ And in 2010, Michaels won the highest-rated season of NBC’s “Celebrity Apprentice.”\n\n“I’m still the only ’Apprentice” constant, in the celebrity version or regular version, who actually made a long-term deal,“ Michaels said.\n\nHis “Celebrity Apprentice” creation, Diet Snapple Trop-A-Rocka Tea, is still sold in stores, blending healthy green tea and black tea with low-calorie pear, cinnamon and mango flavors.\n\nIn the midst of winning the “Celebrity Apprentice” crown Michaels overcame a life-threatening illness, suffering a brain hemorrhage then being hospitalized again for what doctors called a warning stroke.\n\nThe reality show’s host, future President Donald Trump, told Michaels in the season finale “You've done an amazing job in every single way ... a little flaky, but that's OK. ... You've also proven ... to be very brave. I appreciate that.\"\n\nHas Michaels texted or tweeted Trump lately to give the president any advice?\n\n“I have not done that,” Michaels said. “But I have done a lot of work with St. Jude’s.”\n\n(Trump’s son, Eric Trump, launched a foundation that donated millions of dollars to the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, which later turned up in a New York attorney general investigation into alleged violations of federal tax rules and state laws about misleading donors.)\n\nMichaels has helped a number of charities over the years, donating his $250,000 “Celebrity Apprentice” prize to the American Diabetes Association, a cause he relates to having been diagnosed a Type 1 diabetic at the age of 6.\n\nThe now-56-year-old rocker also founded the Bret Michaels Life Rocks Foundation, a “dollar-in-dollar-out” charity with no administrators and no employees other than himself. Michaels funds the foundation with money raised at his concerts, pouring it directly back into the local community, either to diabetics, soldiers in need, or for disaster relief.\n\nHe’s thinking a portion of the revenue from the Palace show will be used for a camp for diabetic children he’s worked with before.\n\n“When they go to that camp, 99.9 percent of the time their whole attitude changes. It gives them a great feeling of hope,” Michaels said.\n\nIn 2014, Michaels raised money for his foundation by introducing at Pittsburgh’s Hard Rock Cafe a Nicoise Salad, his limited-time-only concoction of a grilled tuna filet on a bed of Bibb lettuce, mixed greens with green beans, grape tomatoes, hard-boiled egg, cannellini beans and radishes served with lemon Dijon dressing.\n\n“And it was delicious. Tasty and healthy,” Michaels said. “The perfect combination.”\n\nWhile at the Station Square Hard Rock, Michaels also donated to the restaurant chain’s memorabilia collection one of his two custom-made Pittsburgh Steelers Les Paul guitars.\n\n“The other one’s never going anywhere,” Michaels said.\n\nHe loves his Steelers.\n\n“It’ been said they’re not always the greatest, but just really great when they had to be. We all stumble and bumble in life, but then you pick yourself up. The Steelers always have picked me up. From the ’70s Super Bowl Steelers to watching Bettis and Big Ben. Jack Lambert, when he threw (Cliff) Harris to the ground after he patted (Roy) Gerela on the head. That willed the team to win (Super Bowl X).”\n\nMichaels proudly notes his oldest daughter, Raine, has shown an interest in sports broadcasting. Though she’s got a potentially more lucrative career going as a model. Raine made the 2019 Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, hailed as one of this year’s top rookies.\n\nMichaels collaborated with his youngest daughter, Jorja, on a new song “Unbroken” he expects to sing at his Greensburg show.\n\n“She goes to a school for music and was going through a tough time in her extremely young teenage years,” Michaels said. “She knows I’ve gone through a lot of adversity, so I said why don’t we write a song about this? But make the chorus positive and talking about being stronger than your adversity. A lot of people jumped on board once they heard it. It hits home with people.”\n\nReturning home Friday will hit Michaels with all sorts of feelings.\n\n“Please let everyone know I’m really proud of where I came from,” he said.\n\nTickets are $58 to $88 for the 8 p.m. show.\n\nThe music begins with Pittsburgh country band the Stickers, who have teamed with top-flight songwriters like Cole Swindell and David Lee Murphy and are cutting new music in Nashville produced by Tony Castle, who won a Grammy this past year for his work on Willie Nelson’s last record."
