        "text": "Paula Baker can’t remember a time when she wasn’t cooking with and for people she loves and cares about. Her earliest memories involve standing on a stool in her family’s kitchen, stirring batter, helping her dad make apple pies, or watching things bubble on the stove. These formative moments inevitably led her to earning a degree from The Culinary Institute of America and subsequent stints as sous-chef and executive chef at restaurants in Telluride, Philadelphia, and Boston. Paula and her husband moved to coastal Delaware in 2004 and she began work with the late restauranteur and philanthropist Matt Haley at SoDel Concepts.\n\nPaula’s path led to CBH when SoDel Concepts was asked to help revamp the menus of its summer camp program so that it would eliminate prepared foods and include more fresh produce. When Paula crossed the threshold of 1800 Bay Avenue for the first time, she was hooked. “I love cooking with and for kids,” she explains. “They’re so enthusiastic and fun. And I love introducing them to new foods – especially fresh fruits and vegetables.” Her temporary consulting gig at CBH quickly morphed into a permanent position.\n\nWhile Paula relies on the rigorous training she received at CIA and her years of professional experience to prepare healthy and delicious food for the children enrolled in the Margaret H. Rollins Child Development Center and who are part of the Youth Development Program, she also often returns to her formative years, when she first developed her love for cooking. Her grandmother’s recipes for sugar cookies and Jewish apple cake are bestowing their special kind of love on a new generation of young fans at CBH. And Paula is paying forward the gift her own family gave her, giving Rollins Center and YDP children the opportunity to stand by her side and develop a love for cooking and healthy foods. She has done this through Charlie Brown, Polar Express, and Harry Potter themed meals, annual gingerbread workshops, and foods that celebrate just about every holiday on the calendar. She has invited young people into the kitchen to roast pumpkin seeds, engage in “Cupcake Wars,” learn new skills, discover new foods, and consider possible future careers. She continues to do what she has always done — and what she was taught as a young girl – to cook with and for people she loves and cares about.\n\nIf you spend more than a few minutes with Kenna Chanoux, you’ll learn that she is all about hearing and learning from people’s stories. When her now-adult sons were young boys, Kenna volunteered at their cooperative pre-school and, in addition to enjoying spending time with her own sons in that setting, she found great joy in watching the stories of their classmates’ young lives unfold. She also started a new chapter in her own life.\n\nInspired by her experience as a volunteer teacher, Kenna returned to school and earned an Associate’s Degree in Early Childhood Education from Delaware Technical Community College and credentials in Infants and Toddlers, Preschool and Assessment & Curriculum through the Delaware Institute of Early Childhood Education. Kenna is also licensed as an Early Childhood Administrator through the Department of Education and the Office of Childcare Licensing. Kenna’s certifications include Training in Early Care and Education (TECE) 1 & 2, and The Child Development Associate (CDA) Credential™ (Infants & Toddlers). Prior to joining CBH in 2017, Kenna worked with two-year-olds and three-year-olds and taken on administrative roles in preschool settings.\n\nAt CBH, Kenna has continued to listen to children’s stories. “Each child has a different way to learn. I love to watch and figure out how each child learns best and adjust my approach to meet those needs.” The small size and personalized approach of the Margaret H. Rollins Center provide the flexibility that matches Kenna’s approach perfectly.\n\nWhen Kenna isn’t listening to the stories of the children at the Rollins Center and helping them write the next chapters, she connects with stories in other ways. She loves music with lyrics that tell compelling stories and road trips to places that tell the diverse stories of U.S. history. Most especially she enjoys watching the stories of her two grandchildren’s lives unfold and connect with hers.\n\nIt makes perfect sense that Armina Domingue has found her way to Children’s Beach House. A Licensed Master’s Social Worker with over two decades of clinical experience, Armina has the training and experience necessary to effectively and thoughtfully engage and support the children and families we serve. And with experience serving as a field instructor for master’s and undergraduate level social work interns, she brings a wealth of information and expertise to her collaborations with families, educators, and fellow social workers.\n\nAnd then there’s the whole ocean thing. Armina loves the ocean. Ocean images and ocean metaphors regularly pepper her conversations. When describing her attraction to a life of service, she recalls a folk tale she has heard in various forms. In the story, the main character is walking along a beach and happens upon a large crowd of people busily scooping up thousands of starfish that had washed ashore. The main character doesn’t know how the creatures had come to be stranded and doesn’t bother to ask. Nor does she dismiss the problem as someone else’s to solve or too large to manage. Instead, she simply helps. She scoops up handful after handful of the star-shaped creatures and gently tosses them into the safety of the ocean. “That’s how I view life,” Armina explains. “I want to do my part to make things better and safer one person at a time.”\n\nWhen describing her own temperament, Armina once again relies on an ocean image. Looking out her office window at the flat surface of Delaware Bay, she says, “I’m a pretty calm person. I don’t like to make waves.” That’s not to say Armina doesn’t make an impression. Much like the bay outside her window, Armina’s calm waters run deep. She’s thoughtful, intentional, and insightful in her interactions with families and colleagues alike. She’s astute at understanding complex problems, and eager to lend a hand in solving them – one starfish or one family at a time.\n\nJackie Donaldson sincerely believes “everyone should have the opportunity to live a happy and fulfilled life.” And, for as long as she can remember, she has wanted to help people realize that goal. This ambition developed naturally as Jackie benefitted from the caring interest of others when she was a child herself. Born and raised in Brooklyn, NY, Jackie had access to a range of mentoring programs as a child. She participated in the Big Brothers/Big Sisters program and attended summer enrichment camps. It was somewhat inevitable, then, that Jackie would pursue a degree in psychology at City University of New York, York College.\n\nJackie put that degree to work at The New York Foundling, a pillar in the network of social services in New York City since 1869. The New York Foundling’s philosophy mirrors that of Children’s Beach House. It trusts “in the power and potential of people,” and “deliberately invests in proven practices.” At The New York Foundling, Jackie worked as a case worker and family interventionist, providing therapy and support to families to reduce risks in home. She was selected by the organization’s executive director to work with the Pinkerton Foundation and State of NY to help create a youth work readiness program.\n\nJackie worked at the New York Foundling for more than four years before relocating to Delaware. Upon arriving in her new home, Jackie threw herself into the work of helping young people at the State of Delaware’s Division of Prevention & Behavioral Health Services where she worked as a Program Administrator.\n\nAs Director of CBH’s Youth Development Program (YDP), Jackie is putting her training, experience, and desire to help people live happy and fulfilled lives to work. Her primary responsibility is to oversee the Youth Development Program and the cadre of Family Engagement Coordinators across the state of Delaware. She is responsible for making sure the program adheres to the Positive Youth Development model, which helps young people identify and cultivate their innate skills and talents.\n\nWhen not at work, Jackie and her husband are busy helping their own two children identify and cultivate their own innate gifts. She especially likes to do that by spending time with her family out in nature or as they prepare and enjoy meals together at home.\n\nJonathan Freeman-Coppadge joined CBH in June 2022. Perhaps “joined” is not the right word. He re-joined CBH. Jonathan has been connected to Children’s Beach House since 2004, when he was a summer camp counselor during college. Over the years, as he completed his undergraduate degree, finished a master’s, and embarked on his career, Jonathan has stayed in touch with CBH and introduced several friends to our work. He also developed skills and a work history that prepared him to return to Lewes and begin this new chapter of his career.\n\nMost of Jonathan’s professional life has been spent in the classroom — first at Indian Creek School, then at Groton School and, most recently, at Severn School – where he has taught English, French, drama, and philosophy. He loves working with kids, hearing what interests and perplexes them, and finding ways to connect with them and broaden their worlds. He also loves helping other front-line youth workers and teachers do the same. While teaching English at Groton School and directing the school’s community engagement program, Jonathan also served as a dormitory parent. In that capacity, he enjoyed working with the senior prefects, helping them develop their leadership skills. Similarly, Jonathan volunteered for 15 years with the Hugh O’Brian Youth Leadership Seminar for high school sophomores, a program that proved to be a powerful turning point in his own life. As Camp Coordinator, he is looking forward to playing a similar role and empowering the camp counselors he will supervise.\n\nWhen reflecting upon his change of path from the classroom to the Beach House, Jonathan says that being a supporter and facilitator of front-line work has a multiplying effect that excites him. “I loved being in the classroom, but I could only have an impact on a certain number of kids. Stepping back gives me an opportunity to have a wider impact by empowering others who work with kids.”\n\nRich Garrett knows first-hand the power of human connections. With six brothers and sisters, he could hardly escape human connections. As a young child with speech delays, he relied on them. His siblings often stepped in to clarify his thoughts to others; and as an elementary school student, he relied on the guidance and support of speech therapists to successfully overcome those challenges. Rich happily reports that he hasn’t stopped talking since!\n\nRich’s interest in human connections led to a bachelor’s degree in psychology and certifications in mediation, mediation training, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).\n\nRich’s work life prior to joining CBH continued this journey and honed his skills. He served as Dean of Students at Williams Trade School in Media, PA, — a Quaker school founded to help “deserving young men” learn and develop practical skills — and as Executive Director of a community dispute settlement program and a nonprofit that offered school-based services to children. From the vantage point of all these positions, Rich saw how young people thrive when they are part of a supportive community and when the people around them, rather than seeing problems to be “fixed,” focus on, celebrate, and help them develop their natural gifts and talents.\n\nRich took advantage of the opportunity to bring this way of engaging and supporting young people to a new community when he became CBH’s third Executive Director in 2003. Since then, he has worked to make the Positive Youth Development Theory the centerpiece of CBH’s work. He has loved seeing the programs change and seeing their dramatic impact on kids’ lives, thanks to the long-term relationships they forge with one another and with CBH programs and staff.\n\nBarry loves words. He loves lining them up to form sentences that describe issues that concern him, and he loves describing the work of organizations that are working to address those problems. And, while he takes great joy in writing about the gifts, talents and stories of his colleagues who make all that good work happen, he is less thrilled about writing about himself.\n\nBarry is a relative newcomer to the staff of CBH, joining the staff in the spring of 2021, but he has been part of the Beach House family for many years. He served as fund raising consultant from 2012 through 2016, then as member of the Board of Trustees from 2018 through 2021.\n\nBarry has spent his entire professional career working in various capacities with and for nonprofit organizations, serving as executive director, development director, board member, consultant, and volunteer. As Executive Director of Green Spaces for DC, Barry developed public-private partnerships to create and improve publicly owned green spaces throughout Washington, DC. As Director of Development for Historic Sites for the National Trust for Historic Preservation, he oversaw the fundraising activities of the Trust’s 29 historic sites.\n\nBarry worked for many years in the fight against HIV/AIDS. On the national level, his fundraising work for AIDS Action Council/AIDS Action Foundation helped to support advocacy efforts that led to the passage of the Ryan White CARE Act and the HIV/AIDS provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act. As Executive Director of Northern Virginia AIDS Ministry, he oversaw the delivery of a range of supportive services for people living with HIV/AIDS.\n\nBarry has an undergraduate degree in philosophy, a master’s degree in public policy, and a certificate in landscape design.\n\nHe has served on several nonprofit boards, including Bridge Builders, Housing Opportunities for Women, One in Ten, Washington Area Community Investment Fund, Friends of Guest House, Churches Conference on Shelter & Housing, Roland Park Roads and Maintenance Corporation, and Among Friends.\n\nHe chaired the Town of Milton (DE) Planning and Zoning Commission, leading the historic town through the development of its most recent Comprehensive Plan. A member of the Rehoboth Beach Writer’s Guild, Barry has dabbled in non-fundraising writing and, after many rejections, has had two of his poems published.\n\nCBH prides itself on giving our kids what all kids need: safety, a sense of belonging, and the room to just be kids. Task #1, therefore, is to make sure our beach house — our facility on Delaware Bay, where kids come to be together and to learn — is safe, warm, and welcoming. Eric Krause is the man who makes that happen. Eric is a maker and a fixer to his core. Even as a child, he liked taking things apart and rebuilding them. He likes understanding how things work, how systems hang together. That led him first to study business, to understand those kinds of systems, and then on to technical college, to understand entirely different kinds of systems. After technical college, Eric spent seven years working for a mechanical contractor, building HVAC systems in large commercial buildings. This particular skill is hugely valued here at CBH, where the building has a high tech, environmentally-friendly HVAC system to keep campers, pre-school students, staff, and volunteers safe and comfortable. It’s not the only skill that Eric brings that we value, though. With 25,000 square feet of classrooms, dormitories, bathrooms, showers, common areas, and offices, and with three acres of land that includes a pool, playground, waterfront, gardens, and ropes course, Eric’s other skills with plumbing, carpentry, and electrical repair are put to good and frequent use. Thanks to Eric, Children’s Beach House is a safe, comfortable, and welcoming place for everyone who walks through its doors.\n\nWe often talk about having someone “in our corner.” For most people, that expression, which originated in the sport of boxing, is a shorthanded way of saying someone is on your side and supporting you. For Elisa Lopez, CBH’s family engagement coordinator serving the needs of families in Milton, the expression is not just a figure of speech. In her spare time, Elisa is a recreational boxer, therefore she knows from real-life experience how important good advice and steadfast support can be when it comes from a trusted ally who is literally in your corner.\n\nThat’s what she has striven to be at CBH since becoming CBH’s newest family engagement coordinator in February 2023. Family engagement coordinators are the primary points of contact for children and families enrolled in our Youth Development Program. They work with parents, caregivers, teachers, principals, educational specialists, and other youth-serving professionals to identify children who might benefit from CBH’s Youth Development Program. And, once they are enrolled, they help those children and families create a network of supportive relationships and needed services that help them thrive.\n\nHaving been born in the Dominican Republic and immigrated to the United States when she was 15 years old, and having degrees in human services and human behavior, Elisa is uniquely qualified to partner with and advocate for the children and families at H. O. Brittingham Elementary School, Milton Elementary School, and Mariner Middle School, many of whom come from homes in which Spanish is spoken. Recreational boxing, she says, also helps her in her work. She explains that, paradoxically, helping professions and boxing both require a good deal of emotional intelligence and an ability to understand the thoughts, strengths, intentions, and vulnerabilities of the people with whom you are engaging. Both require an understanding of the rules and limitations under which you are operating and an ability to be able to look toward the future and see the big picture while dealing with current pressures. Those qualities have already made Elisa a trusted supporter to our Milton families and a much-appreciated person to have in their corners.\n\nJustin Nixon can do just about anything. He was introduced to CBH when he participated in and won First Prize with one of his photographs in CBH’s Plein Air Coastal Delaware art competition in 2012. Two years later, he moved to Lewes from Baltimore and was hired to be CBH’s Office Manager, which made use of his formidable technology skills.\n\nSince then, Justin’s role has expanded and he became CBH’s Marketing Manager in 2017, and then became the Director of Marketing in 2024. An integral part of CBH advancement and communications team, Justin’s skills as a photographer and videographer can be seen here on the CBH website, on our Facebook and other social media posts, on CBH’s printed and electronic newsletters, and on just about any other piece of printed material that leaves Bay Avenue. Justin’s skill as a graphic designer can be seen in much of CBH’s marketing materials, CBH advertisements in local newspapers, and – most dazzlingly – in the invitations and decorations for CBH’s many special events – for which he is also responsible for much of the planning and organizing.\n\nBeyond his work as a photographer and designer, Justin enjoys anything active and outdoors — exploring the national parks, snowboarding, hiking, kayaking, and surfing. He also enjoys working in his garden, cooking what he grows, building furniture, landscape design, and painting.\n\nHappiness plays an important role in Enrique “Ricky” Quijada’s life. This pursuit of happiness\n\nwas a legacy of his upbringing in Venezuela, where his mother made her son’s happiness a\n\ncentral focus of her life. She also encouraged him to work hard to secure it himself. Ricky believes he also has a responsibility to help others find their own version of happiness.\n\nFor Ricky, the pursuit of his personal happiness first led him to professional baseball. He loved\n\nThe game and had a certain level of natural talent for it, but he knew that wasn’t enough for him to make it to professional baseball. So, he took his mother’s advice and worked. And worked. And worked. Ricky knew he had to work harder than his competitors, whose natural talent may have been greater, if he was to make it to the pros. And that effort worked. He was signed to a team when he was 18 and played professional baseball for two years in Venezuela.\n\nHe then turned his attention to the United States. “For baseball, the U.S. is the place to be,” he\n\nexplains. “That’s where it was invented.” So, Ricky tried out with a U. S. college scout,\n\ncompeted against hundreds of other Venezuelan players, and secured a college athletic\n\nscholarship in the U.S. After two years of playing college baseball and studying English at Delaware Technical Community College, Ricky changed course. As fun as baseball was, it didn’t satisfy his need to be of service. So, armed with his new English language skills, Ricky turned his focus to pursuing a degree in business management. “I thought that business management was wide open enough to give me skills that I could use in a wide range of fields,” he explains. “I wanted to develop the tools to help people. I also promised my mother that I would finish my degree. She said, if I was going to leave Venezuela, it had to be for something that was going to really change my life, that would help me be happy. For her, that was college.”\n\nThe acquisition of a college degree took hard work and dedication. To maintain his student\n\nVisa, Ricky had to take and pass at least four classes at a time. In order to pay tuition and\n\nsupport himself, he also had to work full-time. So, he threw himself into the simultaneous\n\ndemands of school and work at the Delaware Department of Motor Vehicles. And, in spite of\n\nhaving to balance enormous responsibilities and demanding schedules, Ricky achieved\n\nrecognized results in both places. At work he received several service awards, including one for kindness. At school he was named to the Dean’s List and the President’s List; The latter came with an invitation to The White House. “That was so exciting for me. I grew up Venezuela, moved to the United States and ended up being invited to The White House. That was amazing for me!”\n\nAfter earning his degree and shattering every stereotype about DMV employees over five years\n\nof employment, Ricky brought his desire to help people, his diverse management skills, and his\n\ninclination toward kindness to Children’s Beach House to become a family engagement\n\ncoordinator in our Milton program. “Life has to be something more than just going to work,” he\n\nsays. “You also need to care, to feel deeply, and to help people.”\n\nPat Tosi’s career has been spent using her talent with numbers to improve the lives of others – in all sorts of ways. Prior to joining Children’s Beach House in 2016, Pat served as CEO of Hope’s Door, an emergency shelter and counseling agency which offered safety and opportunities for new lives to victims of domestic violence in Dallas, Texas. As Acting CEO and President, Chief Operating Officer, and Chief Financial Officer of the Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, she led the organization to becoming the world’s largest nonprofit funder of breast cancer research. public education and community advocacy. And, as Owner/Founder, General Manager and Chief Financial Officer of The Vineyard Group, a home goods manufacturing and import company, Pat brought her keen sense of style into the homes of her customers while also giving back to her community through the proceeds of the company’s product sales.\n\nPat continues to use her mathematical mind to improve lives here at Children’s Beach House. As Vice President of Finance and Advancement, she spends her time between raising funds to support CBH’s work and properly accounting for and managing them. For her colleagues and the volunteers who work with her, Pat’s talents are most evident in the exuberant style, joy, and financial success of our fundraising events, and in the rigor, detail, and professionalism of the budgets and financial reports she prepares.\n\nPat’s fascination with numbers led to a bachelor’s degree in Accounting and Business Analytics and certifications in Organizational Leadership and Non-Profit Management from SMU.\n\nShe has served on several nonprofit boards, including DE Fund for Women, Texas Council on Family Violence, Metro Dallas Homeless Coalition, Bridge Breast Network, and Ursuline Academy Dallas, TX. Most recently, she was appointed by Governor John Carney to serve as a member of the Delaware Health Facilities Authority.\n\nPat takes great pride in knowing that together with a team of extraordinary staff, devoted volunteers and supportive community members, Children’s Beach House is making an important difference in the lives of some very special kids and their families.\n\nBarbi is literally the first person you want to see in an emergency. The daughter of a police office, she is also the third generation of her family to serve as a volunteer member of the Manquadale Fire Company in New Castle, DE. She graduated from the Delaware State Fire School, having completed her training as a fire fighter and emergency medical technician, and was one of the first women to be certified by the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians – a certification she has continued to maintain over the years.\n\nBarbi’s commitment to service has formed the basis of her professional life.\n\nShe built on her EMT training and began her career working with children at Nemours Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children in Wilmington, where she served as a patient care technician for 11 years. There she worked primarily on the respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders floor, helping newborns to 5-year-olds with cystic fibrosis, Crohn’s disease, and other chronic issues. When working on the post-op floor she served the needs of children with spina bifida and other genetic disorders following corrective surgeries.\n\nIn order to adjust her work schedule to match the schedules of her own school-age children and put her health and science training to further good work, Barbi took a position at Caravel Academy in Bear, DE, where she worked for 12 years. There she taught 5th grade health, 6th grade science, prepped labs for science classes, and served as a substitute teacher for the entire k-12 school.\n\nBarbi joined CBH in August 2021 as one of the Assistant Teachers in the 3- & 4-year-old preschool classrooms when she and her family relocated to Lewes in the midst of the COVID pandemic. While the needs here are (thankfully!) less critical than at A. I. du Pont Hospital, and our emergencies are (mercifully) fewer and much less scary than at Manquadale Fire Company, Barbi is equally needed here. Her dedication to service and her love of children are the perfect fit for CBH.\n\nNicole Van Matre loves kids. She has spent her entire professional career tending to their safety and well-being. Prior to joining Children’s Beach House in July 2022, Nicole spent several years living and working in Florida in various child-serving capacities. As a case manager with Life Share, she provided intensive support to children in the state’s foster care program. As mentor manager for Big Brothers/Big Sisters, she matched volunteer “bigs” to serve as mentors to lucky “littles.” And as an investigator at the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office of Child Protective Services, she investigated and intervened in reports of abuse and neglect.\n\nThe children Nicole loves most, of course, are her twin sons Mikey and Timmy and her daughter Charlotte. To make sure they could grow up surrounded by as much love and support as possible, Nicole and her husband moved to Delaware, where they would be close to her parents. Nicole continued her career of service to children at Children & Families First, an organization that helps children and families navigate and recover from adverse childhood experiences.\n\nNicole first came to CBH when she enrolled her twins in the Margaret H. Rollins Child Development Center. While looking for a pre-school for her boys, Nicole wanted a place that had a structured curriculum – which is exactly what she found in the Rollins Center. Her boys quickly settled in with their new teachers and friends, discovering that Children’s Beach House was a perfect fit for them. When Nicole learned that CBH was expanding its Youth Development Program and was in need of family engagement coordinators, she suspected that she might be a good fit here too.\n\nAnd she was right. Much like her twins, Nicole has quickly become an integral part of CBH. She has connected with families and kids currently enrolled in the Youth Development Program and is reaching out to prospective participants. She’s been busy planning events to bring the children and their families together and she’s looking forward to connecting with and working with them in the future, seeing them at monthly meetings, attending their sporting events and performances, collaborating with their teachers and learning specialists — and attending and celebrating their graduations. “Most of my professional life has had me involved in kids’ lives for short periods of time – usually for just a few months — and usually when they were in crisis. I’m looking forward to watching the CBH kids grow, learn, and develop over time — and see them launch successfully into the world.”\n\nWhile Erika’s education — a B.A. in Dance with a Minor in Women’s Studies – doesn’t make a career in early childhood education seem like an obvious choice, the story of her life makes it seem like it was inevitable.\n\nErika grew up dancing. Her life as a dance student eventually led to jobs in dance studios and teaching dance and art at summer camps in and near her hometown of Silver Spring, MD. These inevitably led Erika to positions in a variety of school settings after graduation. Her first job, as a one-on-one aide and PE and creative movement teacher, was at a school for children with special needs. She then moved to a Montessori school, where she once again taught PE and creative movement. From there, Erika moved to a play-based preschool in Washington, DC where she worked in a multi-age classroom. Throughout her career working in preschool classrooms, Erika has never stopped dancing. In addition to incorporating dance and creative movement into her preschool classroom, she has continued to teach dance and has helped to instill a love for the art in subsequent generations. Credentialed to be an assistant teacher, Erika started work at CBH in September 2021."
