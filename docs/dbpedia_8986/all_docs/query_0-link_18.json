        "text": "PENNSBURG – For the past two seasons Bruce Brittingham has been the heart and soul of the Perkiomen School football team, and in many ways equally so of the Panthers basketball squad.\n\nAs Perk School head football coach Tom Calvario pointed out, ‘We focused around Bruce. How Bruce went, the team went. From running the ball, catching the ball, special teams, tackling, blocking. Bruce meant the world to the team.’\n\nThe Wagner College football coaches obviously saw that exact quality in Brittingham and wanted him on their team – or teams even.\n\nBrittingham, a Trenton, N.J. native, signed a national letter of intent Wednesday to continue his academic and athletic career at Division Wagner College, which competes in the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly Division I-AA) where he’ll be on a full athletic scholarship. He will major in business.\n\nThe scholarship is for football, but Brittingham has been told he can also join the Seahawks’ basketball team as a walk-on.\n\nSince football is his first love anyway, Wagner was the perfect next step up for him.\n\nDelaware, Temple and Bucknell were also in the final mix, but Wagner’s offer was too tough to top.\n\n‘When I took my visit to Wagner, I felt a good vibe for the school,’ Brittingham said. ‘It was a great location for me, the coaches style of coaching was as great as I have seen. I went up to watch a game on an official visit, and the style of play Wagner runs fits me well. They run the ball a lot, I’m coming in as a running back or safety.\n\n‘I just felt like the way they run things there is a place where I can learn and get better as a player. The Wagner community is very small where I think I can grow as a person as well. The distance isn’t far from home. I always dreamed for my family to be able to come and watch me play college sports. It’s important to me.’\n\nStaten Island, where Wagner is located, is a relatively short drive from Trenton.\n\nBrittingham also liked Seahawks veteran head football coach Walt Hameline.\n\n‘From what I have seen, he can be hard at times, but he’s going to be a person who’s going to be there for you when you need help or when you’re in trouble,’ he said. ‘But he has no problem to let you know what you’re doing wrong and what you need to fix.’\n\nThe chance to play on both or either side of the ball was certainly a big draw.\n\n‘They recruited me as an athlete and said it depends on what they see, so they’re kind of undecided on what they want me to play,’ Brittingham said. ‘They said I can play defense as well as offense. Depending on how things turn out, I could be playing both.’\n\nAll that and a chance to also play basketball.\n\n‘It was definitely something they talked about,’ he said. ‘I’m not sure how it will work out, but I’m looking forward to it. I always wanted to play football and basketball and that was part of my decision as well. The basketball coach said he would allow me to be a walk-on. He was recruiting me, but he wasn’t able to offer me a scholarship due to my injury in the summer.’\n\nBrittingham broke his foot during the summer, keeping him from playing AAU basketball. He has healed perfectly. A couple of Wagner basketball coaches have come to watch him play and know he is his old self again this season.\n\nPanthers basketball standout Eric Fanning, Brittingham’s childhood friend who he helped bring into Perkiomen School, will be right there at Wagner with him after Fanning committed to the school on a full basketball scholarship in November.\n\n‘Eric going to Wagner didn’t really influence my decision,’ Brittingham said. ‘But being that we are friends, going to the same school as him is a plus.’\n\nBirrtingham pretty much carried the Panther football team on his broad shoulders last year, leading the team with 16 touchdowns. He carried 139 times for 554 yards and eight touchdowns and caught six passes for 165 yards and two touchdowns. He scored a combined eight touchdowns between punt and kickoff returns, and when he dropped back to punt but instead ran for a touchdown. Filling in at quarterback, he also completed nine passes for 122 yards and two touchdowns. He was equally fierce on defense.\n\nIn basketball, crested the 1,000-point career mark earlier this winter and is currently the second in career scoring at Perkiomen.\n\nHe credits Perkiomen School, where he transferred from Trenton Central High School his sophomore year, with making him the student-athlete he has grown into … and helping pave the way to Wagner.\n\n‘Perkiomen has played a great role in my success,’ he said. ‘When I arrived here I was a little under the radar in sports. My grades were decent, but they also helped me tremendously in the classroom. As I got older and used to how they do things here, my grades progressed each year. I got better as a student, better as an athlete, and as a person. It is student-athletes at Perkiomen, so I worked on both sides of that end to become the best student-athlete that I can be.’\n\nAnd he grew into a leader on the field and on the court.\n\n‘A very, very good leader,’ Calvario said. ‘He’s meant everything to the team. And this year his maturity took off to another degree, which impressed me beyond belief. Wagner is fortunate to have Bruce attend there. And Bruce is fortunate to have Wagner as a college to go to. It will be a great fit for him.’\n\nGet the latest sports scores on your phone. Text PTSPORTS to 22700. Standard text messaging and data rates apply.
