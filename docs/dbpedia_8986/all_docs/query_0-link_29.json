The JSD tapped Molly Yerkes to lead Harborview Elementary’s Tlingit Language, Culture and Literacy (TCLL) program, which expanded from K-5 to grades K-7 this year and will add grade 8 in 2025.\n\nYerkes, who has served as the principal of Dzantik'i Heeni Middle School since 2010, was named the Alaska Association of Secondary School Principals (AASSP) Principal of the Year for Southeast Alaska in 2024, an award she also won in 2020. AASSP sponsors regional and statewide Principal of The Year recognition awards to honor the educational leaders who play such a pivotal role in student success.\n\nShe will be an extraordinary asset to TCLL educators and students enrolled in the program, said SHI President Rosita Worl. “We were well aware of Molly’s accomplishments in the field of education, and we are thrilled to have her lead the TCLL program. Her philosophy includes integrating cultural knowledge and practices into education. We could not have asked for a better fit,” Worl said.\n\nYerkes, who holds three master’s degrees, also has a strong background in language acquisition, which is a good fit for TCLL, through which educators instruct students in the Tlingit language, Worl said.\n\nBio\n\nMolly Yerkes has been an educator in the Juneau School district for 25 years. During her tenure, she has been committed to building capacity not just at her school, but across the district. This leadership has contributed to expansion of arts education through the Margaret A. Cargill Artful Teaching grant, implementation of educator cohorts to effectively incorporate place-based learning in the classroom, and school leadership strategies that have demonstrated positive outcomes for student performance. Yerkes’ background is in English as a second language and language acquisition programs; this expertise in serving students from diverse backgrounds has informed her practice in school leadership, where she has developed staff capacity to serve students with a wide range of needs. Yerkes’ performance has been recognized at both the local and statewide level. She has twice been awarded Region V Principal of the Year by the Alaska Association of Secondary School Principals, both in 2020 and 2024, and she was awarded the prestigious Milken Education Award in 2011. Yerkes grew up in Juneau and has committed her career to ensuring that all Juneau students are provided the opportunity to achieve academic success.\n\nAbout TCLL\n\nThe Tlingit Culture, Language and Literacy Program (TCLL) is a place-based, culture-based “program within a school” where the Tlingit language and culture are integral to daily instruction and celebrated. TCLL in the Juneau School District (JSD) is one of three optional programs open to all students, along with Montessori Borealis School and the Juneau Community Charter School. TCLL was established by SHI and the JSD in 2000, and it proved so successful, the school district assumed funding for the program.A study in 2013 found that the incorporation of traditional tribal values of the Tlingit, Haida and Tsimshian directly contributes to Alaska Native student success and fosters an environment to grow leadership skills, self-confidence, and creativity. SHI’s goals are to build a thorough language immersive program within TCLL, increase teacher fluency in Tlingit language, and develop TCLL into an autonomous Optional Program in the JSD. In 2023, SHI secured funding from the Alaska Native Education Program to expand TCLL from K-5 to grades 6-8 by the 2024-2025 school year. The program has also received support from the Douglas Indian Association, Goldbelt Heritage Foundation, Hoonah Heritage Foundation and Tlingit & Haida Central Council. For more information, visit the TCLL website.\n\nSealaska Heritage Institute is a private nonprofit founded in 1980 to perpetuate and enhance Tlingit, Haida and Tsimshian cultures of Southeast Alaska. Its goal is to promote cultural diversity and cross-cultural understanding through public services and events. SHI also conducts social scientific and public policy research that promotes Alaska Native arts, cultures, history and education statewide. The institute is governed by a Board of Trustees and guided by a Council of Traditional Scholars, a Native Artist Committee and a Southeast Regional Language Committee.\n\nCONTACT: Kathy Dye, SHI Communications and Publications Deputy Director, 907.321.4636, kathy.dye@sealaska.com; Molly Yerkes, TCLL principal, molly.yerkes@juneauschools.org.\n\nPrincipal announcements for 2024-2025 school year\n\nElementary Schools\n\nAuke Bay Elementary School - Principal Billy Sarandria\n\nHarborview Elementary School - Principal Scott Jonsson\n\nKaxdigoowu Héen Elementary School - Principal Nate Creel\n\nMendenhall River Community School - Principal Eric Filardi\n\nSayéik: Gastineau Community School - Principal Stacy Diouf\n\nSít' Eetí Shaanáx - Glacier Valley Elementary School - Principal Dana Wyatt\n\nSecondary Schools\n\nThunder Mountain Middle Schoo\n\nPrincipal Shawn Arnold\n\nAssistant Principal Laura Scholes\n\nJuneau-Douglas High School: Yadaa.at Kalé\n\nPrincipal Paula Casperson\n\nAssistant Principal Kelly Stewart\n\nAssistant Principal Luke Gunkel\n\nYaakoosgé Daakahídi High School\n\nPrincipal John Paul\n\nOptional Programs\n\nHomeBRIDGE - Principal Corey Weiss\n\nJuneau Community Charter School - Principal Corey Weiss\n\nMontessori Borealis Public School - Principal John Paul\n\nTlingit Culture Language Literacy Program - Principal Molly Yerkes\n\nKristy Germain named new Director of Operations\n\nThe Juneau School District (JSD) is pleased to announce that Floyd Dryden Middle School (FDMS) Principal Kristy Germain has been chosen as the new JSD Director of Operations, starting in the 2024-25 school year. In this position, Germain will be a member of the Superintendent’s cabinet, and will be responsible for planning, coordinating, and directing essential functions of the school district including, Maintenance and Facilities, Operations, Information Technology, Community Schools, and RALLY.\n\nUnder the direction of the Superintendent, Germain will manage support staff, advise principals and supervisory staff, be a member of the School Board Facilities committee, and manage the school district risk program.\n\nSuperintendent Frank Hauser is excited to welcome Germain to the cabinet. “Ms. Germain brings a wealth of experience and leadership skills to the Director of Operations position,” Superintendent Hauser stated. “As the Director of Operations, Ms. Germain will have the opportunity to apply her skills and experiences across the broader JSD organization, benefiting all students, staff, and families in the district. We are excited to welcome her to this new role during this important time of transition in the district.”\n\nKristy Germain was born and raised in Juneau, and is a Juneau-Douglas High School: Yadaa.at Kalé (JDHS) graduate. She joined the Juneau School District as a teacher at Floyd Dryden in 2003. Germain went on to teach at JDHS before becoming Assistant Principal at the school in 2013.

Germain will officially begin the new position on July 1, 2024.\n\nMolly Yerkes is Region V Principal of The Year\n\nAASSP Region V Principal of The Year for 2024 is awarded to Juneau School District Principal Molly Yerkes\n\nDzantik'i Heeni Middle School Principal Molly Yerkes has been named Alaska Association of Secondary School Principals (AASSP) Region V Principal of the Year. Dzantik'i Heeni Middle School is in the Juneau School District, where she has served as an educator for 14 years.\n\nAASSP sponsors regional and statewide Principal of The Year recognition awards to honor the educational leaders who play such a pivotal role in student success. They may be nominated by anyone – students, staff, parents, district office staff or principal peers - with awards finalized by AASSP members in their region. Regional Principals of The Year are eligible to be in the running for the statewide Alaska Principal of The Year.\n\nFrank Hauser, Superintendent of the Juneau School District, said, \"Throughout her tenure, Principal Yerkes has been committed to building community and promoting high academic outcomes, while fostering a supportive environment that is student and staff focused.\"\n\nKasey Mow, a teacher at Dzantik'i Heeni Middle School shared that Principal Yerkes is a phenomenal leader who has the best interest of students and staff in mind. \"She has compassion for staff and students while insisting on a high level of rigor across areas that include cultural knowledge and practices in everyday learning.\"\n\nSuperintendent Hauser congratulated Principal Yerkes saying, \"This is a well-deserved recognition as the AASSP Region V Principal of the year.\"\n\nAttendance matters!\n\nThis school year, the Juneau School District is focused on improving student attendance and sharing information about the importance of regularly coming to school. You will see more communication on this topic in the coming months and may receive additional notifications about attendance from your child’s school. Our goal is to help all of our students value coming to school each day.\n\nStudent success is at the heart of our educational mission, and we are committed to ensuring positive conditions for learning and supporting increased attendance at schools. When students are present and engaged, they are able to fully participate in the learning process; develop meaningful relationships with their classmates, teachers, and staff; and build the foundation for future educational and academic successes.\n\nResearch shows that attendance has a huge impact on a student's academic success, as early as kindergarten. Students who are absent even one or two days each month can fall seriously behind. By 6th grade, absenteeism is one of the signs that a student may drop out of high school. By 9th grade, attendance is a better predictor of graduation rates than test scores.\n\nIt takes all of us—schools, parents, families, and the community—committing to a collective focus on attendance to help promote academic success, along with social and emotional wellbeing. We care about your child and strive to provide them a quality education in a caring, safe, and supportive environment. Please let us know if there is anything we can do to support your family or to assist in getting your child to school each day.\n\nRemember that when you miss school, we miss you!\n\nJanuary is high school choice month\n\nEighth graders in Juneau, can choose the high school that best matches their interests, no matter where they live. Bus transportation is provided across the district to both comprehensive high schools.\n\nIncoming freshmen are free to choose Juneau-Douglas High School: Yadaa.at Kalé (JDHS), Thunder Mountain High School (TMHS), or HomeBRIDGE (HB) correspondence program. The Juneau School District also offers an alternative high school option at Yaakoosgé Daakahídi High School (YDHS) which requires an application and interview. This program has additional requirements and may not be available to all freshmen. No matter which school you attend, all students can participate in competitive sports and activities. All Juneau School District high schools are accredited and issue a full diploma.\n\nHow do students choose a high school?\n\nFirst, plan to attend the High School Information events to find out about the unique programs of the different schools. A Zoom presentation will give an overview of the programs and an informational video is posted on the High School Choice page of the district website. Administrators from all schools will be at the zoom session to answer questions as you learn about all high schools.\n\nMonday, January 22nd - Zoom info session, 5pm (look for the link in the calendar block)\n\nWednesday, January 31th - School tours @ JDHS 5 - 6:30pm\n\nThursday, January 25th - School tours @ TMHS 5 - 6:30pm\n\nThen, complete a High School Choice Form. High School Choice Forms are available on the High School Choice Page.\n\nHigh School Choice Forms are due to middle school offices by February 16, 2024. Make sure a parent or guardian signs the form before returning it to the middle school. Students not returning forms are assigned a high school based on where they live.\n\nBoard approves naming of George Houston Gym at JDHS\n\nOn Tuesday, December 12, 2023, the Juneau School District Board of Education voted unanimously to officially name the Juneau-Douglas High School: Yadaa.at Kalé (JDHS) Gym “George Houston Gymnasium.”\n\nSuperintendent Frank Hauser and the Board of Education received the request from a broad group of community members after the passing of Coach George Houston in October. The idea received substantial community and school district support.\n\n“George Houston was an outstanding coach,” says Board of Education President Deedie Sorensen. “Over the decades, no one in Juneau has contributed as many hours toward keeping the Juneau-Douglas High School: Yadaa.at Kalé gym open and available for students,” she adds, “The naming of the gym in his honor is truly a fitting tribute to his skills, generosity and dedication.”\n\nCoach Houston was a 1969 JDHS graduate and member of the Alaska state championship Crimson Bear Basketball team. He went on to a thirty-two year career at the Juneau School District as a Physical Education teacher, assistant coach, and then head coach of the Juneau-Douglas Yadaa.at Kalé Crimson Bears basketball program. He led the Bears to ten conference titles and two back-to-back state championships, achieving a 278-85 win/loss record and three Alaska Coach of the Year honors. In 2017, he was inducted into the Alaska High School Hall of Fame. Houston also coached Team Alaska at the Arctic Winter Games.\n\nConsidered the consummate Crimson Bear, George Houston lived a life full of community service as a firefighter, teacher, coach, and mentor.\n\nBoard directs CBJ Law to engage with outside counsel regarding the ASAA student athlete restrictions\n\nOn August 31, 2023, a sanctioned discriminatory regulation change to 4 AAC 06.115 was enacted by the Alaska State Board of Education. In response to the newly imposed regulation change, the Alaska School Activities Association (ASAA) changed their bylaws, limiting student participation in activities and burdening school districts.\n\nBoth the regulation changes and ASAA’s bylaw changes have far-reaching effects, into families’ homes and lives. Under these new ASAA bylaws, parents cannot decline to answer questions in a new birth certificate examination without ramifications for their students, and schools cannot decline to monitor a student’s gender or check a student’s gender.\n\nThe Juneau Board of Education discussed some of the associated legal issues at its regular public meeting on October 24. Notably, students don’t shed their constitutional rights when they attend public school or play sports, and the Alaska Constitution has a strong right to privacy protection, which appears to conflict with the new State of Alaska regulation.\n\nJuneau Board of Education members take an oath of office to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of Alaska” and continue faithfully to discharge those duties.\n\nThe Juneau School District Board of Education has moved to direct CBJ Law to engage with outside counsel regarding the ASAA student athlete restrictions.\n\nTMHS Safety Update\n\nUPDATED with JPD press release:\n\nSubject: High School Student Detained on Assault Charge Date: 2023-11-1 From: Erann Kalwara - JPD PI Case or Incident: #2023-11140040\n\nSummary:\n\nOn November 14, 2023 at around 12:40 p.m., staff from Thunder Mountain High School notified the Juneau Police Department (JPD) that a student had a weapon at the school. The principal had immediately contacted the student, isolated him from others and the weapon was safely secured.\n\nFour JPD officers responded and investigated the event. It was determined that a 15 year-old male student had stolen a BB style handgun out of a vehicle and walked into school with it. The male was placed into custody and was transported to and detained at the Johnson Youth Center on two counts of Assault in the fourth degree, one count of Disorderly Conduct, one count of Criminal Trespass in the second degree and one count of Theft in the fourth degree.\n\nPrompt reporting and quick action helped resolve the situation today with minimal disruption. Because school staff were able to immediately locate the student and secure the weapon, it was not necessary to take emergency action, such as implement a school lockdown.\n\nJPD and the Juneau School District take these matters very seriously and we appreciate it when students, parents, staff and community members bring safety issues to our attention.\n\n--- Original notification message from JSD\n\nNovember 14, 2023 - During lunch today, Thunder Mountain High School (TMHS) administrators received reports of a student with what appeared to be a weapon on school property. The student was in close proximity to the administrators at the time of report, so Principal Arnold immediately contacted the student, secured the item and isolated the student. The Juneau Police Department (JPD) was notified and responded. The student was cooperative as administrators investigated the situation and worked with law enforcement. It was determined that the item was a replica weapon.\n\nPrompt reporting and quick action helped resolve the situation today with minimal disruption to the school day. Because the principal was able to immediately locate the student and secure the item, it was not necessary to take emergency action, such as lockdown. Classes were not disrupted and the school was safe during the investigation.\n\nThank you to those who reported, to the students and staff at TMHS for their cooperation, as well as to the JPD for the quick response and resolution of the incident.\n\nThe Juneau School District takes these matters seriously and appreciates it whenever our students, parents, staff and community members bring safety issues to our attention. Student safety is always our number one concern. If you see something, please say something.\n\nPublic Comment on adding Cross Country Skiing as a high school sport.\n\nThe Juneau School District is seeking comment on a proposal from the high schools to add Cross Country Skiing as a Juneau School District sponsored high school sport. View the proposal and analysis or visit www.juneauschools.org for more information.\n\nComments can be sent to JSD activities coordinator Luke.Gunkel@juneauschools.org or (907) 780-1908. The public comment period is open through Monday, November 6th.\n\nEarly Release Mondays for Elementary and Optional Programs\n\nUPDATE: The Board of Education met on July 11 and approved a schedule change for elementary schools and optional programs for the upcoming school year.\n\nThe Board of Education has decided on an early release of 30 minutes each Monday during the next school year for elementary students and students who attend optional programs. On early release Mondays elementary schools will get out at 2:00 pm and optional programs will end at 2:30 pm. Neighborhood elementary school bus routes will leave school 30 minutes early on these days.\n\nWhy is it important?\n\nThe adjusted schedule will allow teachers to participate in almost an hour of professional development and staff collaboration time on initiatives to improve individual student learning in every classroom. Academic subject cohorts, grade level teams, Professional Learning Communities, data teams, student support teams, and Multi-tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) groups can meet together for an hour each week during the school year. By providing regular time during the staff work day, the collaborative time is scheduled, consistent, and inclusive of all school employees.\n\nWhat will teachers and staff members do?\n\nTeachers will work on the new Alaska Reads Act, which requires universal reading screening three times a year, progress monitoring, parent notification of status, and individual learning plans that are communicated to parents. The Reads Act says that schools must communicate assessment results to parents within 15 days, and that schools communicate with parents no less than 10 times per year if their student is not proficient in reading. The school must also prepare individualized learning plans and meet with parents within 30 days of the assessment. If a student is not proficient in reading, the school must meet with parents after the winter assessment in order to determine if the student will be retained. Fulfilling these requirements will take time that is not currently built into staff work days or the yearly calendar.\n\nSchools and districts have been able to improve student success using a regular, common meeting time. It provides an equitable opportunity for all staff, regardless the site at which they work, to participate in collaborative study of student data, student grouping, response to instruction methods and techniques, and outline team plans for intervening with students.\n\nHow does this impact students?\n\nThe student day will be 30 minutes shorter on Mondays for elementary schools and optional programs. The district believes these 30 minutes will be recouped in higher quality and synchronized instruction overall and better implementation of new reading curriculum, better communication with parents, and additional training time in reading foundational skill teaching.\n\nNew Principal for TCLL\n\nThe Juneau School District (JSD) is pleased to announce that Eldri Westmoreland has been chosen as the first permanent principal for the Tlingit Culture, Language and Literacy (TCLL) program.\n\nTCLL is a place-based, cultural-based JSD optional program where the Tlingit language and culture are celebrated, respected, and integral to daily instruction of national standards.

Many of you have been along the full journey with us here in JSD and some of you are just joining us. Welcome to all our new families!\n\nWe are welcoming all 1-12 students on August 16th and Kindergarten students on August 19th. (Montessori Borealis kinders begin on August 16.) Pre-schoolers will start on August 23rd. If you have any questions, please feel free to call your child’s school or check this website for back to school information You can reach all school websites above.\n\nBelow are important details for you as we start the new school year–some reminders and some new information.\n\nMask Policy: The current mask policy reads:\n\nMasks, or similar facial coverings designed to mitigate COVID-19 transmission and are well-fitted covering the mouth and nose, are optional for all persons indoors in Juneau School District facilities.\n\nThe Superintendent has the authority to require face masks in certain situations, including but not limited to: people in contact with another person identified as “high risk” for severe disease shall wear a mask when indoors with that/those individuals(s) and people with exposure to someone with COVID-19 (i.e., close contacts) shall wear a mask per current CDC guidelines applicable for K-12 settings.\n\nIf masking is required in school settings, it will generally be implemented from individual close contacts to programs, to classrooms, to building-level based on circumstances.\n\nWhile not required, masks, both “surgical masks” and KN95 masks will be available at your school for students and visitors.\n\nRequired Student Testing: The weekly testing requirement for student activities is no longer in place. Testing may be required for activities travel if it is requested by the host community.\n\nCDC Guidance: The CDC has released new guidance for preventing the spread of COVID-19 in communities and schools. High levels of vaccine- and infection-induced immunity and availability of effective COVID-19 prevention and management tools have substantially reduced the risk for medically significant illness, hospitalization and death.\n\nCDC recommends that persons must understand their own risk, take steps to protect themselves and others with vaccines, therapeutics, and non pharmaceutical interventions when needed, receive testing and wear masks when exposed, receive testing if symptomatic, and isolate for ≥5 days if infected.\n\nQuarantine of exposed persons (close contacts) is no longer recommended, regardless of vaccination status. CDC recommends that instead of quarantining if you are exposed to COVID-19, you wear a high-quality mask for 10 days and get tested on day 5. Schools will not continue “test to stay” protocols. CDC recommends case investigation and contact tracing only in health care settings and certain high-risk congregate settings.\n\nPer CDC guidance, If someone tests positive for COVID-19, they should stay home for at least 5 days and isolate themselves from others. Wear a high-quality mask around others at home and in public.\n\nIf fever-free for 24 hours without the use of medication, and symptoms are improving, isolation may end after day 5.\n\nThere is no testing required prior to returning to school on Day 6.\n\nRegardless of when isolation ends, avoid being around people who are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19 until at least day 11.\n\nWear a high-quality mask through day 10.\n\nIt is recommended that if you are sick, stay home. We continue to ask that you keep your children home when they are sick to prevent the spread of all illnesses.\n\nI know that was a lot of information. Most importantly, we want to welcome you to the new year and let you know how excited we are to work together to support your child and provide a positive, productive learning environment for them.\n\nJSD Update: Resolved school safety concern\n\nJuneau School District (JSD) received a notice from the Juneau Police Department (JPD) of a reported school safety concern that has been resolved. The following information release is being issued by JPD. JSD appreciates the community cooperation to protect school safety\n\nOn 03/04/2023, JPD received a report from a business in the 8700 block of Glacier Highway, regarding a customer within the store who made some concerning comments to an employee, while shopping for firearm accessories. The employee told police that while they were helping the customer, the customer mentioned they had a messed up sense of humor and made a concerning comment about school shootings. The employee notified their management, who then called JPD\n\nWorking with the business, JPD was able to identify the man who made the comments, a 23-year-old Juneau resident. JPD notified the Juneau School District and coordinated responses through their Threat Assessment Team. JPD provided an additional presence at the schools on Monday, until the man could be contacted\n\nOn 03/06/2023, at about 10:30 a.m., JPD made contact with the person who was responsible for making the concerning comments. The man denied making the specific comment and said he was just joking around; he didn't mean for the comment to come across as a potential threat. Although the comments were concerning, they do not meet the elements of a criminal offense. The man was warned about making such comments in the future\n\nThe Juneau School District worked closely with JPD while this investigation was underway. In addition to the increased police presence, all schools implemented additional security measures as school started today. Information is being shared with staff and families.\n\nSCHOOL BOARD COMPLETES SUPERINTENDENT’S EVALUATION\n\nThe Board of Education has completed its annual evaluation of Juneau’s Superintendent of Schools, Dr. Bridget Weiss.

There were 13 children who ingested some floor sealant.\n\n2. In the initial calls to families, it seems that it was shared that it was “paint thinner.” This was inaccurate, and we aren’t sure why that was misstated.\n\n3. The actual item was floor sealant, and all 13 families were sent the fact sheet related to this chemical's health and safety impacts.\n\n4. We know that the chemical (in a large pouch inside a cardboard box with a nozzle) was stored in the wrong warehouse for over a year. The pallet holding these boxes was near milk sources that were appropriately stored at the warehouse. The chemicals were contained on a separate pallet, not mixed on the same pallet with any milk products.\n\n5. On the morning of June 14th, NANA employees picked up the sealant from the warehouse, mistaking it for milk. (the substance is white and “milky”) Once delivered to the school, the NANA staff served it without verifying what substance it was.\n\n6. The sealant was poured into cups because it appeared to be a multi-serving pouch, not individual servings.\n\n7. Poison Control was called immediately, and directions for monitoring the students were followed. Poison Control connects callers to a poison specialist who is a registered nurse or pharmacist. After a year of training, poison specialists sit for a national certifying exam to become CSPIs (Certified Specialists in Poison Information).\n\n8. The NANA delivery driver and server are no longer employed by NANA.\n\n9. Investigation of the incident has been done by a variety of agencies: Juneau Police Department, Department of Education and Early Development, Department of Health and Social Services Childcare Licensing, Department of Environmental Conservation, and OSHA. The NANA/NMS safety team conducted an incident review, including a product/event timeline, findings, and corrective action. JSD has reviewed communications and emergency preparedness protocols. DEC, DEED/CNP, OSHA, JPD conducted inspections/investigations.\n\n10. The JSD School Board has authorized the district to seek out another investigation entity to overlook each of these third-party reports and report back with additional information and/or recommendations for improvement of the corrective action plan.\n\n11. The JPD report is complete.\n\n12. There are no criminal charges being brought forward.\n\n13. Full June tuition was reimbursed to all families who had a child in the cafeteria when the sealant was served.\n\n14. The Safety Data Sheet for the specific chemical was shared with those families who had a child ingest some of the chemical. #4 on this data sheet specifically addresses ingestion.\n\nSeveral Corrective Action Steps have already been activated, and others are in process. This is not a complete list but a sample of changes and responses.\n\nIn place now:\n\n· Inventory: changed delivery, storage, rotation, and pick-up protocols, labeling of pallets and individual cases, and short-term and long-term inventory practice.\n\n· NANA retrained and is complying with their “taste/sip” protocol, where all food and drink (if not an individually sealed container) is tasted before serving.\n\n· All meals this summer are now being served in a “Grab and Go” style, ensuring all drinks will be in individually sealed containers.\n\n· New NMS training took place in June, and NMS/JSD food service training is scheduled in August for all school year staff.\n\nSome future Steps:\n\n· Secure a communication platform to be used by RALLY to increase the efficiency of parent communications. This will allow staff to send mass notifications to families, like the phone/text/email system that is in place during the school year. This will improve communications for all purposes, but especially in the case of an emergency.\n\n· All summer program facilitators (including RALLY) will be trained on emergency preparedness and response before the school year. This will be in addition to our safety training during the school year.\n\nWe are sincerely sorry that this incident occurred, specifically for our communications not being what they should have been. The Juneau School District has responded to this incident with focus and diligence. I have spoken to each family multiple times who had a child who ingested the chemical. However, if you are one of those families or anyone with a child at RALLY and have additional questions, please do not hesitate to reach out.\n\nJSD is doing this restorative work alongside NANA Management Services (NMS) and Yakobi Fisheries in coordination with all of the investigative departments since notification of the chemical ingestion incident on 6/14/22. Since the incident, NMS has provided additional oversight for NANA staff in Juneau with a rotation of safety officers, the president, vice president, area manager, general managers, and an additional assistant manager. JSD, NMS, and Yakobi have worked in coordination with the State of Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation Food Safety & Sanitation and Department of Education Child Nutrition Program to review protocols and procedures in regard to food and operational safety, warehouse delivery/receiving procedures, and additional procedures, monitoring, and reporting have been implemented as a result.\n\nWe are continuing to analyze our response and develop/implement corrective action steps to provide assurance that the chemical ingestion incident was an isolated event and that the gaps in procedures found during the investigation no longer exist. As we learn anything new, whether from our analysis or that of other investigations, we will continue to adapt our practices and those of NANA/NMS.\n\nAgain–do not hesitate to reach out if you have any follow-up questions. JSD is working with CBJ to cover costs associated with this incident, and those families directly involved will continue to get additional information.\n\nHR Director Announcement\n\nThe Juneau School District is pleased to announce that Lyle Melkerson has been chosen as the next Human Resources Director.\n\nMelkerson is currently the principal of McQueen School at Kivalina, Alaska in the Northwest Arctic Borough School District, where he has worked since 2013.

I have appreciated the dedication and thoughtfulness of our community, and the willingness of our staff to work creatively to support our students this year,” she says.\n\nSchools are opening four full days a week\n\nWe made it to April and things look great in our community! As we all start to emerge from this pandemic, increasing instruction time for our students and expanding in person attendance is an important step toward academic and social/emotional recovery.\n\nOn March 19, as staff and students headed to Spring Break, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated K–12 school guidance to reflect the latest science on physical distance between students in classrooms. CDC now recommends that, with universal masking, students should maintain a distance of at least three feet (rather than six feet) in classroom settings.\n\nCDC has updated its operational strategy to say that in elementary schools, all students should remain at least three feet apart in classrooms where mask use is universal — regardless of whether community transmission is low, moderate or high. As a result of this change in guidance, we are shifting our in person learning plan. One thing important to note is that while we are going to use three feet distancing as our guide, and rely on other mitigation measures as well, there are some occasions in the elementary classroom where students mingle in smaller groups or do activities that bring them closer together than 3 feet. Masks and maintaining a symptom free environment continue to be critical mitigation strategies that have proven effective in our schools.\n\nCDC continues to recommend at least six feet of distance: between adults in the school and between adults and students; in common areas; when masks can’t be worn, such as when eating; during activities when increased exhalation occurs, such as singing, shouting, band practice, sports, or exercise; and, in community settings outside of the classroom.\n\nWe have worked hard all year to keep you abreast of changes with plenty of time to plan. The timing of this new CDC guidance and our amazing community status in “green” provide us the opportunity to expand and we don’t want to delay.\n\nThis week, now that principals and staff are back following spring break, the district has been planning for elementary students to be in person 4 FULL days. This shift is possible earlier than initially planned, so we understand that both schools and families will need to rearrange their schedules. Our elementary principals and teachers are busy preparing for the transition. Some schools will be prepared to make the change a little earlier than others. Some families will be able to make the change a little earlier as well, so we all will be flexible for the next few weeks. Distance learning will also continue to be available until the end of the school year for students who are not coming in person.\n\nStarting Monday, April 5, the following elementary schools will be open for full day instruction on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday: Auke Bay, Riverbend, Montessori Borealis, Juneau Community Charter School, Mendenhall River and Sayéik: Gastineau. Wednesday will continue to be an independent learning day as we make this shift to four full days.\n\nHarborview Kindergarten and 1st grade students will start with four full days on Monday, April 5th. Updated school bus schedules are posted. Please communicate with your child’s teacher or principal if you have any questions or need extra time to adjust your family schedule. If you are a family in one of these schools and you aren’t ready to send your child full days, please contact your school. We can accommodate your child attending only 1/2 days next week as you had previously planned if needed.\n\nStarting Monday, April 12, Harborview 2nd - 5th grade students, all Tlingit Culture Language and Literacy (TCLL) students, and Sitʼ Eeti Shaanáx̱ Glacier Valley will return to full day instruction.\n\nMonday April 12, Middle School is going 4 full days from 2 and High School adds Mondays to in person attendance.\n\nThis is a quick change, but we are very excited to be making a move in this direction, increasing our in person learning time for kids!\n\nNew Leaders Chosen for Auke Bay and Harborview\n\nThe Juneau School District has completed a nationwide search for candidates for the principal positions at Auke Bay and Harborview Elementary Schools.
