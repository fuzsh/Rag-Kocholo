        "text": "Jeff Labar, who along with Tom Keifer gave Philadelphia hard-rockers Cinderella one of the ’80s’ best guitar-duos, has died. Labar was 58.\n\nCinderella disbanded around 2017. In a statement, the group’s surviving members - frontman Keifer, drummer Fred Coury and bassist Eric Brittingham - said:\n\n“Heavy hearts cannot begin to describe the feeling of losing our brother Jeff. The bond between us over decades of creating music and touring the world is something that we as a band uniquely shared. Those memories with Jeff will be forever alive in our hearts. It’s unimaginable that one of our band brothers has left us. We’re sending his wife Debinique, his son Sebastian, family, and friends our deepest condolences. Jeff’s memory and music will be with us forever. We all... band, family and management appreciate the overwhelming outpouring of love. Rest In Peace Jeff”.\n\nThe cause of Labar’s death was not disclosed.\n\nLaBar and Keifer’s guitar tangle powered Cinderella hits like “Shake Me,” “Nobody’s Fool,” “Gypsy Road” and “Shelter Me.” Although cover art for the group’s 1986 debut album “Night Songs” depicted the band in glitzy glam, their sound was much tougher, an amalgam of AC/DC, Aerosmith and Rolling Stones.\n\nMORE ON MUSIC\n\nShe’s got the beat: 15 female drummers we love\n\nA rising guitar-hero you need to know"
