        "text": "Clients trust Erik’s ability to offer practical, effective advice on the many labor and employment issues that arise in the workplace. He counsels employers of all sizes, from small businesses to Fortune 100 companies, often helping them draft and enforce employment contracts, restrictive covenants and other workplace agreements. He assists clients in the financial services, manufacturing and healthcare industries, among others.\n\nWhile Erik’s goal is to help his clients stay out of court, his substantial experience before state and federal courts and administrative agencies across the country has prepared him to vigorously defend their interests when litigation is necessary.\n\nWhether it is a workplace safety matter before OSHA, a traditional labor matter resulting in a grievance or unfair labor practice charge, or a sensitive internal investigation involving allegations of fraud or harassment, clients rely on Erik’s proven ability to guide them to positive resolutions.\n\nErik is Chair of Husch Blackwell’s Labor & Employment practice group.\n\n“I have worked with Erik extensively over the last few years, always with successful outcomes. I appreciate his practical and proactive approach to contentious employment matters, as well as his in-depth understanding of our unique industry. His guidance has not only resolved some complex issues, but also has helped us avoid issues that we otherwise might not have seen coming.”\n\nChief Human Capital Officer, Healthcare and Human Services Organization"
