        "text": "Hi… My name is Tyson Leslie\n\nI was born on September 7th, 1974… approximately.\n\nI say approximately because my birthday is just that: an approximation. There are no actual records as to what specific day, time, etc. that I was born. To my knowledge, my dad didn’t cut the cord. I probably wasn’t born in a hospital, and if I was, it was likely under some insane situation as illustrated in the play “Piece Of My Heart” by Samuel French. Watch that if you feel like balling your eyes out for a while. Especially if you were born in that country when I was born. Seeing what kind of insanity was going on around when and where I was born was almost too much for me. I didn’t take it too well.\n\nI came to the United States by way of Operation: Babylift.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia (which is always 100% true right?), “Operation Babylift was the name given to the mass evacuation of children from South Vietnam to the United States and other countries (including Australia, France, and Canada) at the end of the Vietnam War (see also the Fall of Saigon), on April 3–26, 1975. By the final American flight out of South Vietnam, over 10,300 infants and children had been evacuated, although the actual number has been variously reported.Along with Operation New Life, over 110,000 refugees were evacuated from South Vietnam at the end of the Vietnam War. Thousands of children were airlifted from Vietnam and adopted by families around the world.”\n\nFor more information about Operation: Baby-lift — check out this link\n\nhttp://www.adoptvietnam.org/adoption/babylift-index.htm\n\nThere's much to learn.\n\nIt probably looked like this\n\nOr this\n\nAnd when we got to our destination (mine was Colorado) it might have looked like this\n\nI was cared for until I was adopted by an agency known as FCVN (Families with Children adopted from Viet Nam — I guess FCVN is just easier to remember). You can read and learn a lot about them still to this day at http://www.fcvn.org/\n\nI was adopted by Paul and Donna Leslie when my name went from being Le Van Vinh to Tyson Leslie.\n\nI went home to a house on 19th Street in Greeley, Colorado where I lived most of my childhood through 7th grade. It looked like this.\n\nRecently I went back to visit that same house while on vacation. It now looks like this. The current owners were even nice enough to let me see the inside and how it’s changed over the years. It was one of the most amazing experiences of my life.\n\nIn 1988 shortly after our family moved to Kansas City, Missouri where I spent most of my teenage and adult years. Where I would start numerous bands, join numerous bands, and have seemingly endless wonderful musical opportunities.\n\nI would go on my first dates, fall madly in love with people that never really expressed the same sentiments back, but always ended up being my best friends (see Holly, Patricia, Sarah, etc. etc. etc…) or just thought I was incredibly creepy and demented (see Jennifer Jordan and Jennifer Waterfield — Jr. year — College)\n\nKansas City however was short-lived, as we would uproot and move to Wichita, Kansas from 1990 to 1991 mid-year through my very brief tenure at Hickman Mills, High School.\n\nHowever, in Kansas City, we had a radio station called Z-ROCK. We also had an incredible music scene in Kansas City that I followed religiously by way of a fanzine newspaper called “Banzai Magazine”.\n\nI even went on to write for Banzai from time to time doing album and concert reviews.\n\nAlso, Gregg Todt and Johnny Dare from Z-Rock would be the first people to ever feature my music on the radio ever. In 1991, my song “Under The Gun” was featured on their afternoon show.\n\nIt was during my brief time in Kansas City and continued through my move to Wichita, Kansas that my face was glued to the television every Saturday night for MTV’s Headbanger’s Ball.\n\nThis music spoke to me in such a way that it all redefined who I was and is paramount to making me the person I am today with regards to my love for that genre.\n\nWhile I still loved Michael Jackson, Billy Joel, and much of the pop music that inundated the airwaves of Shadoe Stevens’ America’s Top 40 (yes… I listed to Casey too, but by the time I’d moved to KC, Mr. Steven had taken over on Q104 before it came a country station).\n\nI’d attempt to “date” with some girls, and drank my first beers at parties in Kansas City. My best friends were Russ Ranck and I was head over heels for Holly Beal. But life was about to change quickly and drastically.\n\nMy dad got a job in Wichita, so we would move once again. But it was in Wichita where I would start developing some different musical roots that stay very strongly with me today. Wichita was into some HEAVY HEAVY music. Bands like Pantera, White Zombie, Sepultura, and Fear Factory were becoming the norm. But in Wichita, so were Napalm Death, Deicide, Cannibal Corpse, and thrash music was king.\n\nI would see numerous concerts in Wichita that involved “moshing”, “slam dancing”, and just getting a back case of rock neck. Bands like Overkill, Death Angel, Laaz Rockit, etc. all came to Wichita. And I went to every show that my parents would allow me to go to.\n\nI would also start my first “real” band… and by real I mean that we had gigs and played shows. We even wrote a couple of original tunes… well, I did anyway.\n\nWe were called “Donner & Blittzzen” (Thunder & Lightning y’all) — and we were terrible and not bad all at the same time.\n\nChris was a brilliant musician, particularly for his age. He and I were huge Slayer fans. We were huge Prong fans. But we were also huge Tesla and Beatles fans. So we started a band that performed all of that stuff. We would go from playing “Yellow Submarine” to “Spandex Enormity” by M.O.D.\n\nIt was a mess, and it was awesome. And we had a great time. I still have cassettes from that band, and it’s fun to listen to them in short bursts from time to time.\n\nWe played our school’s talent show and lost. We played a couple of real gigs for nobody but our parents and a few friends. And we played Slayer’s version of “In A Gadda Da Vida”… so there’s that.\n\nAlthough I liked lots of things about Wichita, my parents (especially my mother) did not. They were ready to get back to Kansas City… So in 1992, we moved to Overland Park, Kansas.\n\nI started going to school at Shawnee Mission South High School.\n\nI suddenly stopped getting into trouble at school all the time. I was challenged, I’d found friends that I really fit it with (but it took a while). I started a legitimate band that was gigging regularly and playing musically challenging songs called Alienation with a couple of Russian guys and my friend Eric and his friend John.\n\nPlay keyboards and guitar for one of my favorite singers of all time. Corey Taylor of Slipknot in his solo project The Junk Beer Kidnap Band.\n\nAnd I was fortunate enough to play in the finest Funk band in town (Simplexity) and the best 90’s cover band ever… 90 Minutes.\n\nI was a music teacher at a wonderful place called Music House School Of Music where I taught guitar, piano, and how to basically be in a band with other people.\n\nAnd all of this eventually led me to need a new place to learn, grow, and become a better musician, father, and human being.\n\n— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —\n\nI’m going to continue writing above, but for the sake of time, I’m fast-forwarding to now. 2016. The present.\n\nIn June of 2015, I made the decision to move from Kansas City after a friend convinced me that I should come and be a part of the things I’ve always dreamed of. (Thanks Rich!)\n\nI’m 41 years old now and living in Nashville, Tennessee. I have a beautiful girlfriend who may as well be my wife at this point, we’re just not legally married as of yet… and we’re not 100% sure yet if that’s something that we want to do. We have an awesome little man together named Nelson Stanton Leslie.\n\nI’m also divorced and have my other two incredibly wonderful kids, Nathan Alexander and Grace Emerson. They live primarily with their mother on a farm in Northern, Missouri.\n\nI’m currently working at a piano bar called The Big Bang and seeking touring and collaborative gigs here in Nashville that will both put me back on the road with a national act, and tap into my creative side with other creative people. I’m so ready to start writing music again, and I’m super excited to do so now that I’ve gotten moved into a house and will be able to channel my creativity, privately and with all the resources I need to utilize what I’m capable of doing.\n\nI’ve started to build a great genuine amount of friendships and associates with who I look forward to seeing and performing with every month.\n\nI’ve organized large jams and have shared the stage with some of my absolute heroes in our industry.\n\nThis addition to the story was added on 12.26.21:\n\nThe list of people who have performed in my Rare Hare shows is absolutely astonishing to me:\n\nAce Von Johnson — Faster Pussycat/L.A.
