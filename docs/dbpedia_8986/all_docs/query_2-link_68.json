        "text": "John Anthony Dangerfield was born in Linden, Virginia, on July 27, 1924. He was the fifth of eight children born to the late Anthony Thomas and Effie Hackley Dangerfield.\n\nJohn joined the US Army and served in the South Pacific during WWII. His military photograph is included in the publication African Americans of Fauquier County and is also on exhibit in the African American Museum of Fauquier County.\n\nJohn married the former Pearl Margretta Mitchell on August 7, 1948, at Mt. Nebo Baptist Church, Happy Creek, Va. His beloved daughter Toronda Dangerfield-Pittman was born from this loving union.\n\nJohn was a truck driver at American Viscose/Avtex for 42 years. After retiring at 65 years young, he began what was likely his most notable occupation. John started a career as a school crossing guard. He served the town’s children every morning in front of Ressie Jeffries Elementary School. In September 2011, at the young age of 87, Mayor Tim Darr and the Front Royal Town Council recognized him for 21 years of service. The Warren County Report did a feature article describing him as “a familiar and comforting presence.”\n\nJohn loved Mt. Morris Baptist Church. He joined under the Pastorate of Rev. William Gibbs and was baptized by the Rev. Philip Baltimore. His membership extended during the tenure of five pastors, including Rev. Ed White, Rev. Lindsay Greene, and the current Shepherd of the Flock, Rev. Ralph J. Williams. John sang in the choir, served on the usher board, and as a trustee for over 50 years. During his term on the board, renovations were made to the fellowship hall and the church parking lot.\n\nBeing the last surviving sibling in the Dangerfield family, he assumed the role of Patriarch. He provided a legacy of wisdom, knowledge, ancestral history, and, most importantly, love.\n\nJohn loved visiting Toronda for Thanksgiving dinners and spending time with “her babies”. After years of shoveling mountain-deep snow, John relocated to Richmond, where he resided with Toronda and her family. While there, she honored her father with an enormous 95th birthday celebration.\n\nJohn resided at the Sitter & Barfoot Veterans Care Center as his health required increased care. He always kept a song in his heart! He would serenade loved ones over the phone with hymns he learned through the years. John loved his visits from Chuckie and his phone conversations with Ida.\n\nOn April 24, 2024, John relocated yet again. This time, he made his final transition to a holy city where the streets were paved with gold. John went to see the King!\n\nJohn leaves to cherish his memory a daughter, Toronda Dangerfield-Pittman; two grandchildren, Airial Epes and Garry Callis, Jr.; three great-grandchildren, Aryanna, Makiyh, and Avani; and a sister-in-law, Chandell Mitchell. He was preceded in death by his wife, Pearl Mitchell Dangerfield. John shared very special relationships with Charles Kenner, who was like a son, and Ida Dowe, a life-long friend, as well as a host of beloved family and very dear friends.\n\nA Celebration of Life will be held on May 10, 2024, at the Mt. Morris Baptist Church. It is located at 5342 Leeds Manor Road, Hume, Virginia. Rev. Ralph J. Williams will officiate. The viewing will be at 10:00 a.m. and the Celebration of Life at 11:00 a.m.\n\nRita Ann Wood, 80, of Front Royal, Virginia, passed away on Tuesday, August 13, 2024, at Lynn Care Center.\n\nMs. Wood was born to the late William and Sarah Cruze Wood on October 11, 1943, in Rawlins, Wyoming. She was also preceded in death by her sister, Rebecca Armer, and brother, Sheldon Wood. She lived in Germany and traveled to many parts of Europe. She formerly worked for Project Hope in Berryville, Virginia, and Westminster Canterbury in Winchester, Virginia.
