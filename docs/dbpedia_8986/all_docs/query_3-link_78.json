        "text": "Hmm, animal print spandex, eyeliner out the wazoo and lbs of aqua net. Must be an 80's hair band or a Texas beauty pageant. The name Cinderella will not conjure up images of a pounding rock band so you better have some licks to back it up or you're already a parody.\n\nCinderella started in the early 80's though in 85 the guitarist and drummer left to start Britny Fox leaving singer Tom Keifer and bassist Eric Brittingham. Playing around the Philly area they were discovered by Bon Jovi, who does some BGV's on the album, recommended his A&R rep check them out and they were signed to Mercury/Polygram. Hey, at least Jovi recognised good music. Jeff Lebar was brought in on guitar and drummer Jim Drnac on drums but a session drummer was used on the first album and before it was over Fred Coury from the band London replaced Drnac.\n\nNight Songs was dropped in August of 86 and while not bringing anything earth shattering you could hear the quality of this band. Lumped into the Hair Metal catagory the mix of Keifer's vocals which have a sort of dirty blues sound and the solid musicianship of the band propelled them to triple platinum status. That and the ever present video of Nobody's Fool on MTV. While Cinderella may have borrowed heavily from the Stones blues sound with the style of Aerosmith's Steven Tyler they were no clones and while there are only hints here of what they would become songs like Somebody Save Me and Nothing for Nothing expand the typical pop metal sound of the day into something with more heart.\n\nA nice debut that with the push of it's label and MTV sold well and laid the groundwork for something special to come.\n\nVery good debut from a very underrated band. Yeah, they dressed like any other band of hair farmers but Cinderella could play rings around most of their competition.\n\nWhen \"Shake Me\" first started getting a lot of MTV play I was put off by their girly image at first but the more I heard the song, the more it wormed into my head, so eventually I bought the album and never regretted it.\n\nSome of my \"more metal than you\" friends back then gave me a lot of crap for listening to this band (probably due to their Bon Jovi connection, cuz as you all know, Bon Jovi was THE ENEMY OF TR00 METTLE 'n' all that) but I didn't care. In my book, a good band is a good band, no matter how funny they dress.\n\nI finally got around to upgrading this to CD earlier this year and I'm still enjoying it as much as I ever did. Simply a damn good hard rock record.\n\n_________________\n\n\"I am reluctant to get too deep into politics, and I don’t expect politicians to get too deep into music.\"\n\n- Paul Stanley\n\nHEY KIDS!

Besides being from my hometown, they were one of the earliest hair/glam bands I got into.\n\nWhile I was just a hair too young to appreciate this debut at the time of it's release, I quickly latched onto them when friends I hung out with described them as \"kind of a mix between AC/DC and Aerosmith\". As mentioned, I was just a little too young to catch them in their early club days, but had plenty of friends that saw them sweating it out in the local bars, honing their craft. We had our own little version of \"Heavy Metal Parking Lot\" in the lot of the Empire Rock Club, where JBJ discovered Cinderella. It was the place to be on the weekends. Everyone hung out there. You didn't even need to get into the club. Just hang out in the parking lot. Unfortunatley for me, I went to a catholic high school and had to keep short hair. I got no play whatsoever. Dudes uglier than a mule's ass would hook-up, just because they had long hair. Anyway, if you were an up-and-coming band in Philly in the mid-to-late 80's, if you didn't play at the Empire, you were sh*t.\n\nI remember heated aguments when Britney fox hit the scene. It even got to the point where you had to pick a side. You were either a Cinderella fan or a shipjumper to those scab posers in Britney Fox. You can see where my loyalty was.\n\nAnywho, Night Songs was a great debut from a band that I thought got better with each release, although they went with a much bluesier approach. They were never quite as \"metallic\" as they were on Night Songs. While I don't listen to much hair metal these days, I still spin this disc quite a bit when I'm feeling nostalgic.\n\nScary fun fact: Somewhere out there exists a pic of me and a couple of buddies re-creating the \"Night Songs\" pose in front of the downtown alleyway where the actual cover photo was supposedly taken.\n\n_________________\n\nI used to be with it, but then they changed what \"it\" was. Now what I'm with isn't it, and what's it seems weird and scary to me, and it'll happen to you, too.\n\nWho's to care if I grow my hair to the sky?\n\nIn 1988 Cinderella releases what many, including me, think of as their pinnacle album. Make no mistake, Cinderella is a blues band that rocks and rocks hard, incorporating the Stones/Aerosmith vibe again in spades but staying very much their own band. The album starts with one of those slow, twangy, cowboy intros but a little more then a minute into it Tom mutters, let's go boys and the music kicks into high gear and doesn't relent. Many say that GnR saved metal but if more had sounded like this then what would've needed saving?\n\nWith so many great songs it's hard to pick standout tracks but Gypsy Road may be the song that exempifys the Cinderella ethic and sound with Tom's gruff vocals soaring over a great riff and driving beat. Don't Know What You Got is a ballad but one done right and is their top charting song ever reaching number 12. Long Cold Winter is beefed up blues, slow and heavy and has some sweet guitar driving it.\n\nAn album that never gets old, it also reached 3mill in sales and had Cinderella at the top of their game. And it should be noted that Tom Keifer plays electric, acoustic and steel guitar on this album as well as some tasty harmonica.\n\nMy fave Cinderella album, hands down. They threw some people for a loop with the big time blues influence and moving away from the \"heavy metal\" sound, but to me it was more of a confirmation that these guys were not just another \"hair band.\"\n\nI saw Cinderella opening for Judas Priest's RAM IT DOWN tour while they were supporting this album... which was a rather odd combination, to say the least. Needless to say, they were not exactly welcomed by the Judas Priest crowd. I think I may have been the only person there who was excited to see BOTH bands, the audience was so merciless during Cinderella's set that I was hesitant to stand up and rock out cuz I was afraid someone would rip my head off and throw it at the stage. I still vividly remember the two drunk-as-skunks \"Heavy Metal Parking Lot\" rejects seated behind my brother and I who kept shouting things like \"F**KIN DIE, YOU HOMO AIDS VICTIM F*GGOTS!\" and so forth throughout Cinderella's set.. the memory of which, naturally, became very ironic about ten years later...wonder what those dudes thought of Halford's bombshell announcement in '98.\n\n...so anyway, where was I? Oh yeah, great record, there seriously is not a bad track on LONG COLD WINTER. Faves would be \"Gypsy Road\" and the title track (Tom Keifer channeling his inner Janis Joplin!) but it's all good and I still listen to this one pretty regularly all these years later.\n\nAnother memory I have attached to this album was the day I went out to buy it, shortly after its release...it was an EXTREMELY hot mid Summer day and the nearest record store was a couple of miles' hike from my house. I was a broke teenager with no car but I REALLY wanted to hear the album, so I hoofed it there and back, sweatin' my tuchas off the entire way. As I headed home from the record store with my prize in my hand, trying not to melt from the heat, I reflected that the band had a lot of balls releasing an album called \"Long Cold Winter\" in the middle of July.\n\n_________________\n\n\"I am reluctant to get too deep into politics, and I don’t expect politicians to get too deep into music.\"\n\n- Paul Stanley\n\nHEY KIDS! Check out my way-cool CD and movie reviews and other geeky nonsense on the HubPages Network: http://hubpages.com/@fatfreddyscat\n\nCinderella are quite unknown here in Germany, even though i think back then Long Cold Winter made it into the charts but it's really a band most people will say \"It's some kind of hair metal band, so what?\"\n\nI wrote reviews about their albums on my website and even got some hatemail because \"shitty bands don't deserve good ratings, you have no clue about music\" - at the same time a lot of people because of my reviews bought the albums and were surprised. They liked them and said \"Without your reviews, i would never have bought them\"\n\nWhich leads me also to the question: Would the band have been more popular with a better name? Cinderella does sound stupid and you either expect an all-female group or a female fronted band not a blues-based Hard Rock band.\n\nNight Songs does have a Glam Metal influence, i guess mostly because of Bon Jovi, they already changed on Long Cold Winter. Which i also think is their best album, with the most memorable songs. The first 4 songs from Bad Seamstress Blues/Fallin' Apart at the seams to The Last Mile are just awesome."
