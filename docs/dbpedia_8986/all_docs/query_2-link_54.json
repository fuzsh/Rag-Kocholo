        "text": "Maria Elena Durazo\n\nLegislator\n\nThe Senate Committee on Local Government will come to order. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for this meeting of the Senate Committee on Local Government. The Senate welcomes the public in person, and we are holding our Committee hearings in the O Street building.\n\nMaria Elena Durazo\n\nLegislator\n\nSo let's do give him a big birthday present and get out of here in half an hour. No, I'm just kidding. Just kidding. Where? We had 10 bills on today's agenda, none of which are, none of which are in consent, but we do have a few housekeeping notes.\n\nMaria Elena Durazo\n\nLegislator\n\nFile number six, AB 2433 by Assemblymember Quick Silva, has been pulled from today's hearing. File number 10, AB 2922 by Assemblymember Garcia, has also been pulled from today's hearing. That leaves us with eight bills for today's hearing. Assemblymember Berner has requested to go first, and I have granted her request. Do we have. Okay, we'll start as a Subcommitee since we do not have a quorum. So, Assembly Member Boerner, please come on up.\n\nDane Hutchings\n\nPerson\n\nThe Brown Act was enacted in 1953, and although it has been amended over the years, it does not acknowledge the level to which technology has advanced. More specifically, cybersecurity threats facing public agencies. While the Brown Act does allow for discussion to occur in closed session regarding specific security threats, it is silent on the general topic of cybersecurity.\n\nDane Hutchings\n\nPerson\n\n2715 is a modest amendment to closed session provisions in the Brown Act that will allow local agencies to protect sensitive information that could put at greater risk of cyber-attacks. I thank you once again for your time and considering of Carlsbad's request and urge your strong support of AB 2715.\n\nGinny LaRoe\n\nPerson\n\nSure. I'll be brief. Good morning, Chair and Members. I'm Ginny LaRoe with the First Amendment Coalition, a nonprofit here in California, and I want to thank the author and the staff and proponents for talking with us about this bill. Our position right now is opposed unless amended. And we only seek some very minor clarifications to the bill.\n\nGinny LaRoe\n\nPerson\n\nAnd because they've already worked to do what we think really gives some narrow and specific language that has the right balance for privacy and public access and accountability, we hope we can continue the conversation to get some minor clarifications that we think are important for the public when they see these agendas and these closed sessions. Thank you.\n\nAisha Wahab\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you. I just want to say thank you for bringing this forward. I worked in technology as well as being a local member of a city council. And one, and I just want to highlight this because it is important.\n\nAisha Wahab\n\nLegislator\n\nIn the Bay Area, which, you know, I represent the Silicon Valley, a number of smaller cities have been very much targeted, as well as colleges, and whether their entire infrastructure is taken over or shut down or anything.\n\nAisha Wahab\n\nLegislator\n\nAnd I will say just even competing for the best of, you know, IT and security and so forth is very difficult on school budgets as well as city councils and so forth, especially smaller cities. Also, some of the larger tech companies don't have a special liaison to these particular cities, right?\n\nAisha Wahab\n\nLegislator\n\nThey may have it for a large county, like Santa Clara County I represent, but they don't even have special liaisons to a city the size of Oakland, for example, right? This is incredibly problematic. I have talked about cybersecurity significantly and the needs for it.\n\nAisha Wahab\n\nLegislator\n\nI will also say that the reason why these conversations need to be taken place in closed session is because of the fact that you don't want to share your vulnerabilities, you know, to the larger public and to people who, you know, would like to see some damage done.\n\nAisha Wahab\n\nLegislator\n\nMore specifically, we've had this instance in my council in particular. We talked about it on the open dais, and, you know, they had to take away my commentary verbally from the videos. And that is, again, to protect the city as much as possible. That city, as well as a number of other cities, has been hacked.\n\nAisha Wahab\n\nLegislator\n\nAnd so, I think that this is a good preventative measure it allows for substantive conversation about vulnerabilities, about faulty areas, about needs of improvement, and so much more. So, I fully support this. I appreciate the work. I appreciate you bringing this attention. I will move the Bill as well. Thank you.\n\nKelly Seyarto\n\nLegislator\n\nIt's keeping. Actually. I guess that was wrong for me to say actually. You have a lot of good bills. How's that? You know, the Ralph M. Brown Act is an important act for government transparency and making sure that the public knows what's going on. But as technology moves forward, there are other things that need to be added in and protected by that, and this is one of them.\n\nKelly Seyarto\n\nLegislator\n\nJust like my colleague said, you don't need everybody to know what your vulnerabilities are so that they can run out and immediately attack your agency. And so, I'll be supporting as well, when we get enough. The only reason I decided to add on and talking is because I don't see another author here. Oh, yes, we do.\n\nTasha Boerner Horvath\n\nLegislator\n\nAt the appropriate time, I respectfully ask for your Iva. And thanks to both of the Members who spoke in favor. It is really important that we are. That council members and school board Members are able to be informed about what the vulnerabilities are in a deep way.\n\nBlanca Pacheco\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you. Good morning, Madam Chair and Senators. Today I present Assembly Bill 817. I want to start by thanking the Committee staff for their work on this Bill and today, I will be accepting most of the Committee amendments. AB 817 is a simple Bill that does just one main thing.\n\nMaria Elena Durazo\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you very much. Go ahead and we'll give you two minutes. You have a second witness as well? Yes. Okay, so two minutes each. Thank you very much. Welcome.\n\nJanie Whiteford\n\nPerson\n\nEither we must participate in person, or we can participate remotely and allow the public access to our homes, regardless of how compromising and potentially dangerous this could be. This does not meet the desired threshold of the Legislature's desired goals for equal access and equal opportunity in civic leadership.\n\nJanie Whiteford\n\nPerson\n\nCalifornia is a huge state, and most counties have a large geographic area, and members find it very difficult, if not impossible, to attend meetings. And these meetings do not meet because a quorum needs cannot be met due to the in person meeting requirement.\n\nJanie Whiteford\n\nPerson\n\nWe have a responsibility to allow more voices to be heard and for an equal opportunity for all to participate in advising our county officials. In Santa Clara County on my IHSS Advisory Committee, one of our members resigned because taking paratransit would take her 6 hours of time. Not feasible.\n\nJanie Whiteford\n\nPerson\n\nIn rural counties and very large areas such as San Bernardino, county, it can take a half day to get to a meeting site. It is the rare citizen who will do this and is an impossible bar to set for the public to have a voice.\n\nEthan Rarick\n\nPerson\n\nThank you Madam Chair and Members, I will be brief. My name is Ethan Rarick. I'm the Executive Director of the Little Hoover Commission. The Commission is an independent, bipartisan agency charged with making recommendations to the Legislature and the Governor for reform of state government.\n\nEthan Rarick\n\nPerson\n\nWe came to this issue because we met successfully using remote technology during the pandemic. Subsequently, we surveyed other agencies governed by the Bagley-Keene Act about their experiences meeting using remote technology. 95% said they experienced more public attendance. More than 90% said they had saved money due to reduced travel and facility rental costs.\n\nEthan Rarick\n\nPerson\n\nThat Bill affected the Bagley-Keene Act, as you know, and we were happy to see that Bill enacted, and we have recommended and support similar use for the Brown act. We believe this Bill will increase diversity and representation on public bodies around the state.\n\nAlyssa Silhi\n\nPerson\n\nGood morning. Alyssa still high on behalf of the California Association of Recreation and Park Districts, a proud co-sponsor in support. And also on behalf of the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority, the City Clerks Association of California, City of Belmont, City of Carlsbad, City of Foster City, City of Mountain View, City of Rancho Cucamonga, City of Santa Rosa, City of Redwood City, and Town of Hillsborough, also in support. Thank you.\n\nRichard White\n\nPerson\n\nGood morning. My name is Richard White. I chair the Advisory Council to the Napa Solano Area Agency on Aging with over 140,000 older adults. We met yesterday, so we were unable to submit a position letter on time, but we did meet, and we issued a statement in strong support of AB 817. So we encourage you to vote aye on this measure. Thank you.\n\nBrittney Barsotti\n\nPerson\n\nWe worked diligently with this committee on AB 2449 and have encouraged the author and others who are seeking more flexibility to work within that structure. If there are more categories of folks or sets of circumstances that need to be added so they have additional flexibility under just cause, we are more than open to that conversation.\n\nBrittney Barsotti\n\nPerson\n\nUnfortunately, there hasn't been any movement towards that. We have also offered to allow someone with a disability to count towards the in person quorum, like we did with SB 544, or if there's additional, like excessive travel or things of that or someone's immunocompromised. Right. Those are discussions that have come up over the last years.\n\nBrittney Barsotti\n\nPerson\n\nAnd if the author had accepted in person quorum requirement with certain caveats, then we would likely not still be opposed to those bill. Unfortunately, my understanding is that that is not the case, and it is unfortunate. Also, I'll note that essentially all of the Brown Act bills come up for renewal in January 1 of 2026.\n\nBrittney Barsotti\n\nPerson\n\nSo it sounds like we're going to be having this detailed conversation again next year. We are more than willing to work with supporters of this bill to make sure that the goals of diversity and inclusion are reached. So with that, unfortunately, respectfully remain opposed. And I'll be available to answer any questions as well.\n\nGinny LaRoe\n\nPerson\n\nWe believe that the broadest range of engaged and informed communities, the public, is essential to the health of our democracy. So we're opposed to AB 817 because we believe it will decrease government transparency and accountability and stifle civic engagement. A few examples. So these subsidiary bodies, they serve in an advisory capacity under this new definition that would be written into the Brown Act for the first time.\n\nGinny LaRoe\n\nPerson\n\nWe believe they are no deserving of the same level of public engagement, participation, and scrutiny that any other Brown Act body. That was the purpose of the Brown Act. So, for instance, in Vallejo, years of organizing and activism, including by families of those killed by police, has led to the formation of a police oversight and accountability commission. This is a place where members of impacted families who have faced police violence can show up and ask questions.\n\nGinny LaRoe\n\nPerson\n\nEven though this is an advisory body, it is important to the community. Another example, at a recent San Diego Budget Review Committee, a local activist implored people in the room to stand up if they believed that proposed budget cuts to equity programs were wrong. Instantly, the committee saw before them a room full of constituents there in solidarity, some wearing matching shirts, holding signs. A committee member was even moved to join them in the display. Teleconferencing simply wouldn't allow the community to send the same kind of message.\n\nGinny LaRoe\n\nPerson\n\nThat's why we have joined the news publishers, ACLU, and many others in asking that there always be an in person quorum in a singular physical location where the community can organize. And finally, I just want to share, newspapers around the state have weighed in opposing this and similar bills for several years, and a couple more editorials came out this week that I think really tap into the heart of the issue.\n\nGinny LaRoe\n\nPerson\n\nIn the Mercury News this week, the editorial board said this is another step down the slippery slope toward local government secrecy. It went on to say state lawmakers should be working to increase civic engagement for the people, increase public access to the policy process, and this would do just the opposite. In the LA Times, similar sentiments. And this is the point.\n\nAisha Wahab\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you. So I'm a big advocate of, obviously, using technology. I think I was one of the, the big people that pushed us to all get laptops and iPads and so forth in the Senate side, and we're not there yet here in the California State Legislature. And then on a local perspective, Covid obviously showed areas of need for improvement, ease of use, and so forth. My concern with a lot of these remote teleconferences, if you will, is the ability to chat privately with members, the ability to be able to share, like, oh, this happened, that happened.\n\nAisha Wahab\n\nLegislator\n\nI also think in person is incredibly important when it comes to the feeling in the room. Right. So, for example, on my City Council, we had a lot of issues regarding public safety, regarding, you know, a lot of issues that really affected vulnerable communities. And sometimes the feeling in the room is actually, you know, what can stir a difference of an opinion. With this and the subsidiary bodies in particular, you know, I have concerns about the per diem. Right. I think that that's important to address that. I don't believe if we've had a resolution to that. Would you be able to answer anything?\n\nBlanca Pacheco\n\nLegislator\n\nSure. So it wouldn't apply to City Council. So it wouldn't apply to councils. It wouldn't apply to planning commissioners because those are elected bodies who make... They're decision making bodies. They're not advisory bodies. So this bill would only apply to those non-decision making advisors...\n\nBlanca Pacheco\n\nLegislator\n\nCorrect. So in Downey, for instance, we have parks and rec, we have commissioners, we have public works committee members. We have, we also have a Green Task Force Committee. So it would apply to those committees because they're only advisory. And as to compensation, most of these don't get compensated, but some of these do.\n\nBlanca Pacheco\n\nLegislator\n\nAnd the witnesses that are here to testify, which the main witness, she drove 3 hours just to get here. And so it would help those individuals who are disabled as well. And as to the compensation, most of them do not get compensated, but some of them do. And so what we want to make sure is we also want to make sure that people are civically engaged, but as well, the minor compensation that they do receive, we want to make sure that they continue to receive that compensation.\n\nBlanca Pacheco\n\nLegislator\n\nSo we already allow this for decision making bodies at the state level. And so this bill would be, would only apply to local levels. Of course, it would apply statewide. But there is also a sunset. There is a sunset provision within this bill which would be July. I'm sorry, January 1. Is it January? July 1. 2026. And make sure. But it would be 2026.\n\nBlanca Pacheco\n\nLegislator\n\nI've taken seven out of the nine committee amendments. The two that were not taken had to do with the compensation and the in person quorum requirement. And the reason is because that's the whole purpose of this bill.\n\nMaria Elena Durazo\n\nLegislator\n\nOkay. Any comments? Okay. All right, well, thank you, Assembly Member Pacheco. We've been, for bringing this bill forward. I know it's. I know your purpose, and especially because of all the participation today was, you know, is to, you care about your community and everyone's ability to participate in local government.\n\nMaria Elena Durazo\n\nLegislator\n\nAnd yes, these bodies may only make recommendations, but they are often made up of community members in the City Council or Board of Supervisors appoint. They are often given power to develop recommendations that inform the future actions that our local governments take. So it is vital that the public can inform the recommendations these bodies make.\n\nMaria Elena Durazo\n\nLegislator\n\nI don't believe that you can as effectively do that on a computer screen instead of in person. But despite all the concerns and others that I laid out, I offered a path for your bill that balanced the public access with accommodations for members of these subsidiary bodies.\n\nMaria Elena Durazo\n\nLegislator\n\nAnd as you said, I appreciate that you agreed to certain amendments, like narrowing the kinds of subsidiary bodies that could use the flexibility. The remaining two points are that we suggested that members that receive compensation for their service would not participate on a subsidiary body receiving this additional flexibility.\n\nMaria Elena Durazo\n\nLegislator\n\nAnd second, we suggested requiring that a quorum of the subsidiary body participate in person so that the public can address the body directly. We recognize your goal that certain members, that those who have a disability may have a difficulty participating in person.\n\nMaria Elena Durazo\n\nLegislator\n\nSo in response to that concern, we offered to allow certain groups to count towards that in person requirement, even though they are participating remotely. And you were, this is, as you said, the part that you were unwilling to accept. I hope that. I was hoping that we could find a way to resolve these final issues, but we're not there yet.\n\nMaria Elena Durazo\n\nLegislator\n\nFor that reason, I will not be able to support your bill today. And I think, primarily, we have to remember that it's the Brown Act, the heart of the Brown Act, that we have to continue to protect, and that requires face to face participation. So with that, you can have your final closing remarks.\n\nBlanca Pacheco\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Madam Chair. And thank you, Senators, again, for this opportunity to present this important pill that would allow people to participate when, you know, if they're disabled or they're unable to attend these important advisory committees. This would allow participation from our members, more residents, and we've taken a number of amendments.\n\nBlanca Pacheco\n\nLegislator\n\nAnd again, this bill would merely mirror the Senate Bill, which was 544, which allows state bodies to be able to meet remotely. So it's the equivalent to SB 44, applies at the local level. And again, I want to thank you all for this opportunity and respectfully ask for your aye vote.\n\nRick Chavez Zbur\n\nLegislator\n\nMeeting these goals requires that governments at all levels partner in developing and implementing strategies to transition to a clean energy future, ensuring that EV charging and building electrification are available to those who are least able to access these, including lower-income communities, renters, and people who live in multifamily housing, and that transmission infrastructure is sufficient to support truck and vehicle delivery fleets and small businesses requires on the ground knowledge in our local communities.\n\nRick Chavez Zbur\n\nLegislator\n\nWe always say in the climate space that this is an all-hands-on-deck crisis that we're dealing with and we need all levels of government involved. AB 1176 embraces local decision-making and requires high-level planning and strategies at the local level to meet the electrification needs of our community residents, visitors, employees, and businesses.\n\nRick Chavez Zbur\n\nLegislator\n\nLastly, recent amendments. We took a number of amendments on the Assembly side to address the concerns of legal cities and many cities' jurisdictions. And then we took, on this side, recent amendments to limit this to jurisdictions with 75,000 residents or more to make sure that we're not imposing hardships on some of the smallest jurisdictions.\n\nMelissa Romero\n\nPerson\n\nOf course. Just want to thank Assembly Member Zbur for his leadership on this issue. Enviro Voters is here in strong support of AB 1176. We know that electrification is happening in our state, and our state has adopted ambitious climate goals that require drastic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions in all the different sectors.\n\nMelissa Romero\n\nPerson\n\nWe're happy to support AB 1176 because it promotes proactive measures to ensuring that our communities are prepared for those changes and know that they are coming. And this bill does not promote a one-size-fits-all all solution, but rather it leans into local governments and their municipalities to identify what those solutions are that work best for them.\n\nKelly Seyarto\n\nLegislator\n\nSo, the opposition brought up some points, and I think you can sum them up, sum what his concerns are. Is that what exactly does this plan, what are they supposed to plan in their general plan to electrify? Are you talking about new housing construction? Are you talking about existing housing and trying to retrofit everything.\n\nRick Chavez Zbur\n\nLegislator\n\nSo, it doesn't necessarily have to be in the general plan. So, part of the flexibility is that it can be in another plan. For example, the City of Oakland, the City of Santa Monica have actually voluntarily done these kinds of plans.\n\nRick Chavez Zbur\n\nLegislator\n\nIf you look at what they've done, what it does is it creates strategies for increasing electrification for both vehicle charging in their jurisdiction. So, they include policies, for example, that they would actually employ when they have discretionary decisions coming before them.\n\nRick Chavez Zbur\n\nLegislator\n\nThey think through whether or not, you know, how they're going to provide electric vehicle charging for people that actually live in apartment buildings. They plan out areas in the that when they get plan, when they get funding that they could provide on-street charging, they're thinking long term about providing the vehicle charging that their communities need.\n\nKelly Seyarto\n\nLegislator\n\nRight. And so local jurisdictions who want to do this are already doing it. My problem with some bills like this is when it starts out with, this bill requires cities and counties to do this, it puts them on a timeline that may not be attainable to them as opposed to others.\n\nKelly Seyarto\n\nLegislator\n\nAlso, you know, the whole effort with what I call a very unrealistic effort, instead of adjusting to something that we can actually achieve over a longer period of time, it translates into a very unaffordable future for everybody in California, including my kids. I'm tired of having to watch kids move out of the state. And this is part of it.\n\nKelly Seyarto\n\nLegislator\n\nThese type of bills that continue to raise costs for everybody. Increase, you know, when you're increasing work at the cities to do plans like this, and then those plans turn into mandates for people to spend more money on their existing homes, to get them out of their gas stoves and things like that.\n\nKelly Seyarto\n\nLegislator\n\nBecause all those houses, when you put everything into electrical, if you try to electrify all of these houses, whether you have 1950s or '40s or '60s stock homes, they have to be re real, the wiring has to be redone in order for them to be able to accept the amount of electricity that is going to be used in a household that is all electric.\n\nKelly Seyarto\n\nLegislator\n\nThere is a lot more to this than just saying, hey, make a plan. And I think it's up to the cities to determine when their community is ready and able to do this type of thing. And I don't think the state should be imposing these type of mandates on cities.\n\nKelly Seyarto\n\nLegislator\n\nSo, I will be opposing this bill, as I will a bunch of the other bills that come through that are going to continue to increase costs for Californians to the point where we're losing Californians that have the ability to help our tax base and we're losing our kids. Our kids can't afford anything here.\n\nKelly Seyarto\n\nLegislator\n\nSo, I think we need to lay off on some of this, and I think we need to let technology catch up and the market catch up, and that will help us do a smoother transition, because right now this is not a smooth transition. People are feeling it and they're sick and tired of it. Thank you.\n\nRick Chavez Zbur\n\nLegislator\n\nSo, first of all, this gives cities and towns great flexibility. The compliance deadline isn't until 2029. It's not a year or two out. It's many years out. So, you have great flexibility in doing that.\n\nRick Chavez Zbur\n\nLegislator\n\nI would sort of push back on the assertion that this is going to raise costs for consumers. I mean, one of the things that I think when you actually look at the move to electric vehicles is that I spend a lot less on my transportation needs with an electric vehicle than I would if a gas vehicle.\n\nRick Chavez Zbur\n\nLegislator\n\nAnd what this does do is it requires that local. First of all, it gives cities great flexibility in terms of how they do this at the local level. But second, it also makes sure that they're thinking about the fact that charging infrastructure should be available for everyone at all income levels wherever they live.\n\nRick Chavez Zbur\n\nLegislator\n\nAnd that's something that will not increase costs. It will reduce costs because if we have public charging stations in places where people can access them, they don't have to put them in, in their own jurisdictions. And it allows folks to basically think about when a shopping center goes in, thinking about putting chargers there.\n\nRick Chavez Zbur\n\nLegislator\n\nMost of those are going to probably be private, for-profit things that won't require a lot of costs. But if you're not thinking about those things, then, and we already have mandates that are in the law, we have mandates that we are going to be selling only electric vehicles by 2035.\n\nMaria Elena Durazo\n\nLegislator\n\nI know when she gets back, we're jumping on it. Just, I appreciate that the timeframe here is until 2029. I think that gives timing of it, but we do get through here a lot is another responsibility at the local level, and they're not exactly all coordinated. Right?\n\nMaria Elena Durazo\n\nLegislator\n\nSo, we don't know exactly what has become of the responsibilities at the local government level. So, on that side, I agree that we have to be careful how and what we expect.\n\nMaria Elena Durazo\n\nLegislator\n\nIf you could touch any more on that in terms of your efforts to not just pile on at the local level and make sure that they really truly have the ability, because we're talking about a lot of issues that come before them. Right? Housing requirements, climate requirements. There are all sorts of things.\n\nRick Chavez Zbur\n\nLegislator\n\nSo, one of the things we did in terms of the long compliance deadline was that we actually put that in so that jurisdictions can actually do this when they're doing other planning exercises, and they have. They can push those things in.\n\nRick Chavez Zbur\n\nLegislator\n\nWe did take many changes from cities and counties across the state in the Assembly side to make sure that there were not specific mandates, that these were guidelines, that they were ones that allowed local jurisdictions to fit what they were doing to their local needs.\n\nRick Chavez Zbur\n\nLegislator\n\nAnd that was, you know, in addition to raising this to 75,000, it was basically looking carefully and taking many, many amendments that they asked for in terms of the criterion on how these, on how these plans, you know, need to meet and actually showing them examples where some cities have actually already taken and done this voluntarily in the state.\n\nRebecca Bauer-Kahan\n\nLegislator\n\nAnd let me be clear, in some parts of our state, there is not enough access to reproductive healthcare, whether we're talking about prenatal care or STD or the like. And so for communities to come in and block clinics that will provide this critical health care is really a detriment to their own communities.\n\nAlena Chavez\n\nPerson\n\nThank you for the opportunity to provide testimony for this critical Bill when I was 17 years old, I had my first pregnancy scare. A senior in high school, I knew immediately that if I was truly pregnant, that I did not want to be feeling scared and alone. I looked up abortion near me on my family's desktop computer.\n\nAlena Chavez\n\nPerson\n\nI felt sick. When the results came up 49.4 miles away, a 54 minutes drive and a one and a half or an hour and a half minute bus ride. How could I possibly get there with no money, no car, and two amazing but overly involved parents?\n\nAlena Chavez\n\nPerson\n\nAs the weeks went by, I grew more and more scared and isolated myself from my family and friends. Luckily, I eventually started menstruating and it felt like the biggest weight was finally lifted off my shoulders. However, I was just one of the lucky ones.\n\nAlena Chavez\n\nPerson\n\nYou see, my hometown has one of the highest STI and the highest teen pregnancy rates in all of California. By the time I graduated high school, 15 of my peers were already parents, with many more walking across the stage to accept their diplomas. Why?\n\nAlena Chavez\n\nPerson\n\nI'm sure you're wondering by now where I'm from, and I'm proud to be from Visalia, California, the gateway to the sequoias. So that's why I'm here today, to show you how harmful a lack of reproductive healthcare was years ago for people in rural and medically underserved parts of the state. Unfortunately, however, not much has changed.\n\nAlena Chavez\n\nPerson\n\nIn fact, when a new clinic was trying to open up in Visalia, local opposition prevented clinic construction from beginning, leaving many vulnerable populations without access to care. And Visalia is not the only location this has happened in. This has been happening throughout the state, in more rural areas like Fontana, California, that are already healthcare access deserts.\n\nAlena Chavez\n\nPerson\n\nOkay, sorry. So that's why AB 2085 is needed now more than ever. AB 2085 expands healthcare access in California for our most vulnerable communities by creating a more streamlined process for clinic construction to address the difficulties many health centers have faced when opening new clinics. That's why I'm here asking for your aye vote. Thank you.\n\nMolly Robson\n\nPerson\n\nIt was a surprise when, after a year of planning, the City Council placed a temporary moratorium on any new buildings in the area. The council then placed another moratorium, this time for 10 months, which has now been determined to only impact the health center.\n\nMolly Robson\n\nPerson\n\nIn a post ops era, when millions of people have lost access to abortion and other reproductive health care in their home states, it is critical that in California, access is not impeded. The Fontana Health center, for example, would have provided an estimated 2000 medical visits per month and positively impacted the community, yet remains on hold.\n\nGreg Burt\n\nPerson\n\nWe believe this Bill undermines local control, infringes upon religious liberty, and unjustly gives special privileges to abortion facilities which California does not have a shortage of, while neglecting the needs for more prenatal and maternity care. This Bill would force municipalities to open abortion facilities as a right and permits lawsuits against those that don't comply.\n\nGreg Burt\n\nPerson\n\nThis overeat circumvents the local city councils that have the right to decide which businesses are permitted within their jurisdictions. Just as cities regulate local the location of tobacco in liquor stores or casinos, they should have the right to decide where abortion facilities go. Abortion is not just another healthcare service.\n\nGreg Burt\n\nPerson\n\nIt's like you don't want women to have babies in certain areas. We should be rejoicing at pregnancies, not treating unborn babies like a deadly disease that need abortion as a cure. Abortion is a violent answer that harms both the child and the mother. And Californians deserve better. Thank you very much.\n\nRebecca Bauer-Kahan\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you so much, Madam Chair. And I just want to say that as someone who has had three pregnancies, all of which I considered incredibly joyful, and I celebrated each and every one who was lucky to live in the Bay Area, where I had access to incredible prenatal care and needed it every single time, as every woman does.\n\nRebecca Bauer-Kahan\n\nLegislator\n\nI think that the opposition made my point for me about the lack of access to prenatal care across California. These community clinics do a lot more than provide access to abortion, and the blockage of them is harming our future and our communities. So with that, I respectfully ask for an aye vote.\n\nMaria Elena Durazo\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you. Thank you very much. Okay, the Bill has been moved by. But we. We can't. Can't accept it until we take the quorum. Yes. Okay, hold on, hold on. All right, you're lucky. We're gonna take quorum.\n\nMaria Elena Durazo\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Madam Chair. Leave that open for other Members. Okay, we will go back to. Oh, no, let's wait until. Should we wait for Senator Wuhab to vote on that? The other one. All right, let's go back and take a vote. We'll go back to. We need a motion. Motion on file item number nine.\n\nSteven Glazer\n\nLegislator\n\nAnd we'd like to recognize you to present. This is SB. This is AB 2593. No. Oh, it's Addis. I thought. Oops, boy, I apologize. Signals are getting crossed here all over the place. This is file item four. Is that correct? Assembly Bill 2302 by Assemblymember Addis. Chair Durazo, the floor is yours.\n\nMaria Elena Durazo\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you. Yes. On behalf of Assemblymember Addis, this Bill will clarify the number of meetings that Members of a local legislative body can participate in remotely for just cause or emergency circumstances. During the Covid-19 pandemic, local bodies found that allowing Members to attend meetings remotely was helpful when they had difficulties attending in person.\n\nMaria Elena Durazo\n\nLegislator\n\nIn 2022, AB 2449 allowed Members of legislative. Local legislative bodies to participate in meetings remotely under certain circumstances for a maximum of 20% of meetings a year. Current law does not specify whether multiple sessions of a legislative body on the same day should be classified as one meeting or two separate meetings.\n\nMaria Elena Durazo\n\nLegislator\n\nAnd it preserves the original intent of AB 2449 because it still equals about 20% of the legislative body meetings each year. It clarifies that the term meeting means any number of meetings of a legislative body that begin on the same calendar day. This will reduce confusion. Okay. Around existing law, and ensure that public servants will not receive any unfair penalties while attempting to follow the law in good faith and serve their communities. Witness today is Dave Fleishman, City Attorney for the City of Pismo beach.\n\nDave Fleishman\n\nPerson\n\nThank you, Mister Chair and Members of the Committee. My name is Dave Fleishman. I'm the City Attorney for the City of Pismo beach, and I'm also the past President of the City Attorneys Department of the League of California Cities. On behalf of the City of Pismo Beach, I'd like to express our steadfast support of AB 2302, which will give cities like Pismo Beach flexibility that was afforded to all other local governments during discussions around the Brown Act in 2022.\n\nDave Fleishman\n\nPerson\n\nI also want to thank Assemblymember Addis for her willingness to author the legislation. The City of Pismo Beach is a small coastal community on the central coast and prides itself on transparency and public participation. The City Council has always encouraged input from the residents, especially at City Council meetings.\n\nDave Fleishman\n\nPerson\n\nThis has led the city to conduct both its open and closed sessions of the City Council meetings as separate individual meetings with separate agendas to provide a more predictable timeline for the public to participate. These meetings are always held consecutively on the same evening, and thus this nuanced approach has served several cities well to maximize transparency.\n\nDave Fleishman\n\nPerson\n\nAs you know, new laws were adopted in 2022 that addressed virtual participation in City Council meetings, capping the number of meetings Members of the legislative body can participate in virtually. This language was negotiated with local governments with the understanding at the time that they would be applied uniformly across all public agencies.\n\nDave Fleishman\n\nPerson\n\nAB 2300 and two seeks to rectify the unintended consequence of these comprehensive bills from 2022 and restore flexibility and parity that was previously afforded to all local governments. We believe that this Bill is the right approach to addressing the problem and simply clarifies the intent from AB 2449 from Assemblymember Rubio in 2022.\n\nDave Fleishman\n\nPerson\n\nUnder interpretation of current law, our City Council Members in Pismo Beach can participate remotely only half the time than what was intended. In one instance, it resulted in our mayor opting to not attend one of the meetings to preserve his ability to appear remotely at a future meeting. Thank you for your consideration of AB 2302, and I'm happy to answer any questions the Committee may have.\n\nSteven Glazer\n\nLegislator\n\nGreat. Thank you. We're now going to turn to opposition. Are there main opposition witnesses here? Anybody here who wants to indicate their position in opposition? Alright. Seeing none, we'll bring it back to the Committee for questions or comments. Members, any questions or comments? Seeing none. Senator Durazo, would you like to close?\n\nJosh Hoover\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Madam Chair, Members. Appreciate the opportunity to present AB 2350 to you today. As a former school board member, we are just introducing this bill as a simple change to the Brown Act, essentially. Under current law, it is required in the event of emergency meeting to contact members of the press via telephone.\n\nJosh Hoover\n\nLegislator\n\nThis would simply allow an alternative to that, to contact members of the media via email for those members of the media that opt into that. We took some amendments in the Assembly to address concerns by the First Amendment Coalition, and I believe the bill now has no opposition. Would appreciate your aye vote. Thank you.\n\nMaria Elena Durazo\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you. Anyone else in support? Anyone in opposition? Okay, seeing none, questions, comments here on the motion? Thank you, Senator Wahab. Let's take the vote. Oh, closing remarks. I'm sorry.\n\nIsaac Bryan\n\nLegislator\n\nKeep it spicy. Good morning, Madam Chair and Senators. I'm proud to present AB 2684, a bill that would require city and counties to account for extreme heat in their local hazard mitigation plans or safety elements. First, I want to accept the committee's amendments and thank the committee staff for working so hard with me and my team.\n\nIsaac Bryan\n\nLegislator\n\nStrategic planning in response to extreme heat will allow our local jurisdictions to be as prepared as possible to protect our residents from extreme heat. Looking ahead to 2050, over 200 of our cities will be experiencing average temperatures surpassing 90 degrees fahrenheit. Or looking back to yesterday when it was 106 degrees here in Sacramento--I looked at my weather app and it called it 'sizzling sunshine.'\n\nIsaac Bryan\n\nLegislator\n\nThe reason it's important to plan for extreme heat in our local hazard mitigations plan is because it allows local jurisdictions to have access to FEMA dollars in case of emergency heat or extreme heat emergencies, which they currently don't have access to.\n\nIsaac Bryan\n\nLegislator\n\nRight now, the burden for these kinds of emergency crisis rests solely on those local jurisdictions and the state. By planning for these kinds of disasters, we open ourselves up to the ability to get outside resources from the federal government, which I think is critically important at a time like now where we're facing such an extreme budget deficit.\n\nMichael Jarrett\n\nPerson\n\nExtreme heat is growing in intensity--we can see that today--frequency, and duration, and our communities are not prepared. Extreme heat is responsible for more deaths than any other disaster in California. The Legislature has recognized the impact of extreme heat by establishing the Office of Planning and Research's Extreme Heat Community Resilience Program, a first-of-its-kind grant program to combat extreme heat in communities that need it the most, and by codifying the Extreme Heat Action Plan last year in Senator Caballero's SB 306.\n\nMichael Jarrett\n\nPerson\n\nClimate Resolve believes it is good government for every local government to plan for extreme heat. AB 2684 would open up new funding channels for local governments to plan and implement transformative and resilient infrastructure adapted to rising temperatures. We respectfully request your aye vote on AB 2684. Thank you for your time.\n\nRoger Dickinson\n\nPerson\n\nGood morning, Madam Chair and Members. I'm Roger Dickinson, Policy Director for CivicWell, formerly the Local Government Commission. Assembly Member Bryan has described the bill well, and we want to thank him for his leadership. Extreme heat is increasingly a major issue for communities across California as the impacts of climate change manifest themselves.\n\nRoger Dickinson\n\nPerson\n\nWe not only see cities and counties in the Central Valley and southeast California enduring growing numbers of episodes of extreme heat, but cities and counties elsewhere throughout the state are experiencing the same pattern. Extreme heat can cause profound consequences for public health, local economies, and the environment.\n\nRoger Dickinson\n\nPerson\n\nThose who are most vulnerable among us, older populations, children, and those with health conditions face the greatest risk. However, there are steps we can take to reduce the impacts of extreme heat, including applying cool surfaces and creating green spaces. We can improve energy efficiency and increase clean energy to reduce heat island effects.\n\nRoger Dickinson\n\nPerson\n\nAB 2684 will allow local communities to build on the state's Extreme Heat Action Plan and Extreme Heat and Communities Resilience Program through the Office of Planning and Research by incorporating extreme heat components in the safety element of their general plans. In so doing, communities can use hazard mitigation planning and funding to address extreme heat conditions.\n\nAngela Manetti\n\nPerson\n\nHi. Good morning, Madam Chair and Members. Angie Manetti, here. I'm testifying on behalf of the California Apartment Association. Just wanted to clarify our position is opposed unless amended. I know the analysis has us stated as opposition. We are simply asking that when local governments update their safety element to address extreme heat, that it's consistent with the law that was passed by this Legislature in 2002, AB 209.\n\nAngela Manetti\n\nPerson\n\nThat law required the Department of Housing and Community Development to submit by January 1st, 2025, recommendations to the Legislature, which were designed to ensure that residential dwelling units can maintain a safe indoor air temperature. We ask that the mandate in AB 2684 on local governments is consistent with the HCD recommendations.\n\nAngela Manetti\n\nPerson\n\nThose recommendations are intended to take into account methods for reducing indoor air temperatures, including but not limited to building and site electrical system limitations, cost barriers, electric utility capacity limitations, state and federal statutory requirements, and other relevant factors. The important considerations for heat mitigation will certainly be cost barriers for existing buildings and electrical utility capacity limits. We believe our requested amendment is reasonable and does not conflict with the goal of AB 2684. Thank you for your consideration of our comments.\n\nSteven Glazer\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you. Assemblyman Bryan, first let me just thank you for your leadership in this space. I think you're absolutely right. It's a big problem, and getting in front of it, certainly as it relates to trying to match it up with federal money, is the smart thing to do. The issue that I'm challenged on the bill is not about the goals, but really it's about how it's weaved into our existing requirements that are in law, and one of the things I note in this bill is that your effective date is not till 2028. Is that right?\n\nSteven Glazer\n\nLegislator\n\nYeah? So I'm wondering, the suggestion from the Apartment Association is that they're happy to have it adhere to these HCD regulations that are coming out next year, but nobody knows what they are, and I know it's your point of--I mean, the analysis raises the issue of definition as a challenge.\n\nSteven Glazer\n\nLegislator\n\nAnd you, I think, rightly, through staff have indicated that if you don't know what HCD is saying, how can we comply with it? Right? And so I think that's a fair, that's a fair point, too, yet we want to make sure that there's some consistent practices and policies that go forward to local governments. I know from my time in local government that these things are not, you know, it's not a light switch to turn on.\n\nSteven Glazer\n\nLegislator\n\nThere is a process, there's an expense that every local government has to go through to do these things, rightfully so, but want to make sure that if we're going to direct them to do it, that there's some consistency in, and so they know how to do it. And that would really be my question to you, given that the implementation date of 2028, even though I won't be around, you will, why not pause a day, why not pause a year on this worthy proposal to make sure that we're going to get it right?\n\nIsaac Bryan\n\nLegislator\n\nYeah, I think, unfortunately, our climate emergency isn't one of those things we can pause here. As I mentioned yesterday, 106 here in Sacramento. Every year we are not planning for urban heat is a year that we are failing our seniors, we are failing our vulnerable communities. We should have started this process a long time ago. It also is another year where an emergency could happen that we can't get outside aid for.\n\nIsaac Bryan\n\nLegislator\n\nEven giving it a 2028 headline gives local jurisdiction--we want to give them the flexibility to plan over time and over space, which is part of why not knowing what those recommendations from HCD are, boxing them in to recommendations that don't exist, I think, is unfair to our local jurisdictions. The needs of the Coachella Valley might be a little bit different than the needs of San Francisco, and so definitely want to maintain that flexibility.\n\nIsaac Bryan\n\nLegislator\n\nI appreciate the Apartment Association, and we've been in communication about this bill and others, and I think we will stay in communication because our goals are aligned and I think we'll find that right landing spot. I'm not sure if it's forcing local jurisdictions to adhere to recommendations that don't exist yet, but I will be here next year and in 2028 if the people will have me, and so this is an issue I plan to work on through many iterations.\n\nIsaac Bryan\n\nLegislator\n\nThis is just, I think, the first step to making sure that our local jurisdictions are prepared for what is happening, what's coming, and have the resources both locally and nationally to deal with these crises.\n\nSteven Glazer\n\nLegislator\n\nIf I could, in follow-up, again, I think our goals are aligned. I grew up here in Sacramento and 106 is not unusual. As I was growing up, I certainly had many of those days. But we are still in agreement about climate change and how this is a rising problem, so for sure. And I guess that's my pause. I still want to support your bill and what you're trying to do with it, it's just that--it just seems that this definition is critical to making sure there's consistency.\n\nSteven Glazer\n\nLegislator\n\nAnd the state has recognized in previous bills that this is a problem and there's requirements and the Governor's Action Plan is advancing. So it's not like this is a brand new--we're waking up and we see a problem. So you're trying to weave something into what is an existing action plan of the state, which is fine. It's just trying to make sure that we have clarity to local governments and that's just the pause that I guess makes me--want to support your bill--but has some concerns about making sure it can be, it can work well.\n\nIsaac Bryan\n\nLegislator\n\nYeah. Failing to prepare is preparing to fail. Our local jurisdictions have been failing our seniors and vulnerable communities by failing to prepare for extreme heat. It is getting hotter and we are doing all that we can to reverse that trend, but as we know, that trend is continuing.\n\nIsaac Bryan\n\nLegislator\n\nIt's important that jurisdictions plan for this and have the resources they need when they're hit with a crisis. And that's not just their resources or the state's resources, it's federal FEMA emergency resources. This bill takes us one step closer to having that reality, and I respectfully ask for your aye vote.\n\nMaria Elena Durazo\n\nLegislator\n\nOkay, we'll leave the vote open. We have one more--we have one more bill who is not here. Oh, there he is, walking through the grand entrance. And Assembly Member McCarty, we are ready for you. Good morning. You may begin when you're ready.\n\nKevin McCarty\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Madam Chair, for allowing me to present AB 2593. This is a district Bill and a bipartisan Bill that I'm authoring jointly with Assembly Members Hoover and Nguyen, focusing on having a better regional, coordinated approach to tackling homelessness in our county. It's a problem in all counties.\n\nKevin McCarty\n\nLegislator\n\nI will note this morning, they came out with our point in time count here in Sacramento. So the good news is there are fewer homeless in Sacramento, a decrease by 29%. It was over 8000. Now, 6500 ish. But the bad news is there's still 6500 people sleeping outdoors. And as we know, they say over half of them have mental health challenges.\n\nKevin McCarty\n\nLegislator\n\nSo what this leads us to really focus on and what our grand jury reported last year is a lack of coordination between the local jurisdictions, because at the end of the day, we are all in this together in our communities, and we're focusing that on the budget allocations to cities.\n\nKevin McCarty\n\nLegislator\n\nWe're saying we want counties to have regional plans to work on these issues together. So what this Bill would do, it would set up a joint powers authority, like many of you came from local governments as well. We have JPAs on wastewater, transportation.\n\nKevin McCarty\n\nLegislator\n\nThe library system in your county is ours here as well, but not one on the most pressing issue facing our community. This would set up a joint powers authority and a governance structure where the county and the cities within the County of Sacramento would work together and partner to focus on a regional plan.\n\nKevin McCarty\n\nLegislator\n\nThat's one of the amendments that we're taking here, but more importantly, just better coordination and pooling resources. So this GPA won't have a land use authority to cite these locations. It won't use other jurisdictions dollars, but it will make sure that they work together in partnership to tackle this critical issue for Sacramento.\n\nKevin McCarty\n\nLegislator\n\nSo with me today is April Ludwig, who's the CEO of Hope Cooperative, a local homeless organization making a difference here in Sacramento, and ask for her to testify and respectfully ask for your aye vote. Thank you.\n\nApril Ludwig\n\nPerson\n\nThank you. Good morning. So, my name is April Ludwig. I'm the CEO of Hope Cooperative. It's my honor to be here to support AB 2593. Our organization has continuously provided services here in the Sacramento region for 43 years. And in those services, we provide mental health services, those who are suffering or who have substance abuse challenges, as well as who are experiencing homelessness.\n\nApril Ludwig\n\nPerson\n\nAs we are looking at this joint powers of authority, what we're excited about is the opportunity to bring local jurisdictions together to support in, incredibly, thinking about a plan, a strategic plan as well.\n\nApril Ludwig\n\nPerson\n\nSo we want to make sure that we are, the JPA would be supporting homelessness with making sure that our leaders set goals, share resources, and most importantly, follow a regional strategic plan to address homelessness. Such a plan has already been approved and developed by Sacramento's continuum of care provider.\n\nApril Ludwig\n\nPerson\n\nSacramento's depths forward, but needs the accountability that a JPA or joint powers authority would provide. So we're incredibly supportive of that plan, specifically based on the services that we provide with the individuals we provide those services to. Thank you so kindly for considering this.\n\nBrian Dahle\n\nLegislator\n\nYes, Senator, I just have a question. I'm coming out of local government, and I think we have the ability to do jpas with other agencies without having to do legislation. Why is this? What can these agencies not do? And what's the requirement for the Bill?\n\nKevin McCarty\n\nLegislator\n\nYeah, we talked about that. There are some jpas, I know you have a little bit of Sacramento county as well, that were created by the Legislature statutorily. And so, you know, we just thought having the state create this would put more substance in it.\n\nKevin McCarty\n\nLegislator\n\nAnd we think, too, it's a really good tie in with what we're doing in the budget, because in the budget, we're saying more and more we want jurisdictions to work in partnership. So that was debated, but we are working with the jurisdictions. None of them oppose this measure, and it is all voluntary. All these jurisdictions would have the chance to opt in or, conversely, opt out as well.\n\nBrian Dahle\n\nLegislator\n\nSo just back to my basic question, though. I'm a support your Bill, but I'm trying to make sure that there's. They legally can do a JPA their own without having to do state legislation. All these interested parties can come together form a JPA right now.\n\nKevin McCarty\n\nLegislator\n\nYeah. Thank you for working with us. This is an issue in all of our communities, and hopefully this can be a model that can help Sacramento but can be utilized elsewhere in California. Thank you.\n\nMaria Elena Durazo\n\nLegislator\n\nWhat's the last item? All right, that's it. Close the roll n item nine. Yep. That's it. Thank you to all the individuals who participate in public testimony today. If you were not able to testify, please submit your comments or suggestions in writing to the Senate Local Government Committee.\n\nMaria Elena Durazo\n\nLegislator\n\nEveryone's participation comments are very important to us. We want to include you in the official records. Thank you, everyone, for your patience and cooperation. We've concluded the agenda. Happy birthday, Jonathan. And Senate Committee on Local Government is adjourned. Thank you. Thank you, everyone."
