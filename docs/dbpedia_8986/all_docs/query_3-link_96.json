        "text": "Photo by Bob DeHart\n\nWalking into a rehearsal studio at S.I.R.’s Nashville location on Cherry Avenue, Gene Simmons immediately put the other musicians in the room at ease.\n\n“He walks in and starts doing some crazy dance, like a hoedown dance,” recalls guitarist Philip Shouse, a Decatur native.\n\nShouse was there with other musicians Simmons, the iconic Kiss bassist, singer and songwriter, had tasked guitarist Ryan Cook with finding for Simmons’ new solo band.\n\nAt S.I.R., which stands for Studio Instrument Rentals and was founded in Los Angeles, Simmons and company rehearsed some covers. The Beatles’ version of R&B classic “Money.” A Wilson Pickett tune. Some more old-school R&B songs.\n\n\"We started playing,\" Shouse says, \"and after like a couple run-throughs you could kind of tell (Simmons is thinking), 'Oh, these guys can play, this is going to be fun.' We were done and I pretty much forced him to do two Kiss tunes. [Laughs]\"\n\nThey finished the rehearsal with makeup-era Kiss rockers “Parasite” and “Deuce.”\n\n“The first rehearsal was really cool, just how Gene came in and was just one of the guys in the band,” says Shouse, whose last name rhymes with “house.” “Wasn’t throwing his weight around. He wanted input – ‘How do you think we should end this?’ And he’s still that way. He’s fantastic.”\n\nSimmons released a self-titled solo debut album in 1978 - in a marketing masterstroke, the same day as Kiss’ other three original members, Paul Stanley, Ace Frehley and Peter Criss, also released solo debut LPs.\n\nBut he’d never done a solo tour before.\n\nNow, Shouse, Cook, guitarist Jeremy Asbrock and drummer Brent Fitz are backing Simmons on just such a trek. [Tour dates can be found on genesimmons.com.]\n\nIt’s quite a thrill for Shouse, a talented blond guitarist wielding encyclopedic ’70s-rock chops. As a youngster in Decatur, Shouse honed his lead guitar skills playing along to Kiss’ raucous, excellent 1975 “Alive!” double-LP. In Simmons' band, Shouse would soon get to also perform with Frehley - more on that in a bit.\n\nShouse now resides in Nashville. Since April 2013, he and Asbrock have hosted Thee Rock N' Roll Residency, which has grown into one of the Music City's hottest recurring jam sessions, held at the Mercy Lounge, address 1 Cannery Row.\n\nSurprise guests at Thee Residency have included the likes of shock-rock legend Alice Cooper, Cheap Trick singer Robin Zander, Deep Purple bassist Roger Glover, to name just a few.\n\nThee Rock N' Roll Residency is free to attend and held 8 p.m. most Tuesdays. With Shouse and Asbrock about to embark on a Gene Simmons Band tour, that schedule will change, so check facebook.com/theerocknrollresidency online for details. Thee Residency house band also includes Jarred Pope and either Judd Fuller or Cinderella's Eric Brittingham on bass.\n\nShouse also owns Mutt Merch, a company selling T-shirts for dogs and humans. The shirts are emblazoned with fun, music-themed designs such as Black Labbath, Grateful Dane and The Beagles, and made by Huntsville-based company Amplify, which also manufactures tees for Thee Rock N' Roll Residency.\n\nOn a recent afternoon, Shouse for a phone interview. Excerpts are below.\n\nBy Matt Wake | mwake@al.com\n\nPhoto by Nathan Cox\n\nPhil, how did the opportunity to be in Gene Simmons’ solo band come about?\n\nThe Gene gig came from Ryan Cook. Ryan has known Gene I think since the late-90s - he was in a band called Hair of the Dog that opened up some Kiss shows. Ryan is also in with Doc McGhee and Scott McGhee, Kiss’ management, just been around them for a while. And Ryan’s also in a band called The Big Rock Show that has played on, I think, all the Kiss Kruises. And on the last Kiss Kruise, Gene came to him with the idea, it was only I think five solo shows at the time, which turned into way more than that now, “Hey, I’ve got a handful of solo shows next year and can you put together a band for me?” And Ryan said, “Yeah, I’ve got the guys right now.” So that was it.\n\nWhat are some of your earliest memories of Kiss? How did you get connected to that band’s music?\n\nWell, I got into Kiss kind of late. I went to Austin High School, and my friend Brad he was a Kiss fanatic, had the pinball machine and all that stuff. He made me a mixtape. Pretty much the whole catalog, he picked some tunes from each era but he focused on the makeup era and opened up with some stuff from Kiss \"Alive!\" and I'd been taking guitar lessons for about a year. Couldn't really get the hang of anything lead-guitar-wise, and then heard Ace (Frehley, original Kiss guitarist) and heard that stuff and it just clicked. It all made sense. And I got it.\n\nOne of the things that I love about Ace Frehley’s playing on those Kiss albums is his guitar solos are kind of like a song within a song. Why were you drawn to his playing?\n\nI'd say the same thing you said. It's a good point. Those solos are as much a part of the song as the choruses. You can hum them and they hit me at that time because I could play them. I was learning the scales and patterns in my guitar lessons, and just thinking to myself, \"This sounds nothing like Eddie Van Halen. What am I doing?\" And then I heard (Ace) and it clicked – that's what I'm learning. I got so excited because I could actually play along. And so I learned every single note of all the Kiss \"Alive!\" record and I can probably still play it.\n\nWhen we’re with Gene the three of us divide up lead guitar duties - nobody’s lead and nobody’s rhythm. We really take pride in playing all those solos note for note. Because we know that the fans are wanting that. We want that. We’re not going to walk onstage and just jam on some Kiss tunes and make up our own solo. That’s the last thing we’d do. It’s blasphemy. We’re very, very careful to keep it true to the original.\n\nBesides Ace Frehley, who’s another Kiss guitarist whose playing you really enjoy?\n\nI really like Bruce Kulick’s playing on the “Revenge” album. That’s my favorite non-makeup album, and I love the songs and sound of that record. Bruce really played dirty and greasy on that record. I love it.\n\nOutside of Kiss, who are some of your other biggest guitar heroes?\n\nJoe Perry from Aerosmith. I was an Aerosmith fan when I was like probably 3 or 4 years old. They were my first favorite band and through my older brother Kevin had all their records. Eddie Van Halen. Billy Gibbons is a huge one. Michael Schenker. Ritchie Blackmore. Early Eric Clapton. Leslie West. Tony Iommi, huge influence.\n\nPhoto by Joan Morrison\n\nWhat are some distinctive Decatur-related musical memories, from your time growing up there?\n\nDecatur was the first place I had a band and actually played. In high school, I had a group called Excalibur and we played around a little bit, but then out of high school there was a group called Little Big Man, around in the early-90s, so we started playing together and we played all the time. We would rehearse, do any kind of gig that we could do. I’d moved to Decatur when I was 12 and just started playing guitar before I moved there. And so that’s really where I had my first rock band interaction was there. We moved to Alabama from Norfolk, Nebraska. My dad worked for Goodyear and got transferred.\n\nPhoto courtesy Everett Collection\n\nWhat were some of the earliest rock concerts you saw?\n\nWell, my first one ever was Aerosmith on the \"Pump\" tour, it was Joan Jett opening, at Von Braun (Center). And that was great. I was a freshman and it was the week of final exams and my parents still let me go. We got on the floor and I grew up pretty sheltered and that was the first time I'd smelled grass was at that show. \"What's that smell?\" [Laughs] And it always smells different at concerts for some reason. Doesn't it? It smells sweeter than anywhere else. Not saying I know, just that I've heard.\n\nWhy do you think been so much buzz around your Nashville jam session Thee Rock N’ Roll Residency?\n\nWhen you come to it, it isn’t like we’re putting on a concert. It’s like you’re going to a buddy’s house and his record collection is top notch, he has all the cool stuff. It’s a cool vibe and I think people like that. People like the special guests, they like they don’t know who’s showing up, because Robin Zander showed up out of the blue twice. There’s always surprises, we play the songs really well and it’s a lot of fun. It’s low key and casual, we’re with the audience and the audience is with us – it’s not a proper concert, it’s just a hang.\n\nPhoto by Nathan Cox\n\nSo Robin Zander from Cheap Trick just shows up? There’s no email, text, call or anything?\n\nNo, our buddy Greg Mangus who sings with us a lot on Tuesdays knows him and Greg would say a lot of times, \"The Cheap Trick guys are in town. They may show up.\" And then sure enough one week it was, \"Cheap Trick's here.\" Like, wow OK great! So we talked to him and he sang and then he came the next week and did the same thing, so now we know Robin and Daxx (Nielsen), the drummer in Cheap Trick, and we know some of the crew. We just played with them in Minnesota. They were on the same bill with Don Felder, when Ace came. [In September, Frehley sat-in with the Gene Simmons Band to perform four Kiss classics at a Hurricane Harvey benefit in St. Paul, Minn.]\n\nWhat was it like getting a chance to play guitar with Ace Frehley, whose recordings you’d played along to so much as a kid?\n\nI’ve gone back and watched some of the Ace Frehley footage and it’s still so weird. I didn’t take my eyes off him the entire time he was onstage. The entire band is Kiss fans like I am. We’re just absolutely insane. And Ace is one of the reasons that we all play guitar – one of the reasons. And so when he’s walking up the steps you can see us getting completely giddy and like laughing. And then high-five each other. Not Ace, but me and Jeremy and Ryan are all high-five-ing and hugging, like \"Can you believe this is happening?\"\n\nDid getting the chance to play with Ace in-person make you appreciate anything new about his guitar playing?\n\nI think it just amplified everything I liked about him. His feel. Hearing it not from a P.A., hearing it come out of a four-by-12 (amplifier speaker) cabinet that you're standing in front of, is a whole other thing. Hearing one of your heroes, the sound's coming out right there where you're standing.\n\nJust surreal. Like the first time that Derek (St. Holmes, the singer on many classic Ted Nugent recordings) came and played with us, we didn’t rehearse or anything so he showed up and he starts singing “What the Doctor Ordered” and hearing that voice come through the monitors, it’s like I’m 12 (expletive) years old. It’s just insane when you’re playing with those people. And then when they’re cool. Robin’s so cool and the guys in Deep Purple, Don (Airey, keyboardist) and Roger (Glover) are so amazing. It’s a bit surreal, but then you realize they’re just guys, they’re just musicians like I am.\n\nWhen these classic rock icons show up to jam at Thee Residency are they always playing their own songs? Or does, say, Robin Zander want to sing a Beatles song or whatever?\n\nOh yeah man, the first time Robin sang I told him, “Man, we know tons of Cheap Trick.” He’s like, “I don’t want to do any of that.” I said, “What do you want to do?” He said, “Do you know any AC/DC?” “We know the whole catalog. What do you want to play?” He said, “I want to play ‘Long Way to the Top’.” “You got it.” So we did “Long Way to the Top” and then we did “Hot Love” and “He’s a Whore.” [Laughs] So we hit him with some Cheap Trick. And the next time he came we did “Dead Flowers,” The Stones and I think we did a couple more Cheap Trick tunes too.\n\nPeter Baltes from Accept, he was playing Deep Purple with us. And when Lzzy Hale and Joe (Hottinger of Halestorm) come we always do covers. She’ll do some Dio (era) Black Sabbath with us, we’ve done some Judas Priest with her, we’ve done Aerosmith with her. Of course, doing Deep Purple songs with Roger Glover is pretty awesome, but I like when we do cover tunes with them too. It gives them something else to do too because they play those songs with their day job. It’s up to them.\n\nPhoto by Bob Dehart\n\nYou’ve had plenty of amazing special guests at Thee Rock N’ Roll Residency, but who’s a dream guest you haven’t had there yet?\n\nSteven Tyler. He lived in Nashville for a while and we have connections to him through a few different people. We didn't get him. [Laughs] And Billy Gibbons, I met him on Tuesday afternoon. He said he had a day off and was just going to come and chill, and I get it, so I think he may have been there on Tuesday but I didn't see him. I would love to have Billy Gibbons play with us. Oh my God.\n\nGene Simmons is such a larger-than-life rock figure with this intimidating stage presence. From working with him in his solo band, what’s something interesting about Gene fans might not expect?\n\nHe is absolutely hilarious. When you see pictures of (the solo band), we are smiling the entire time, laughing and that goes onstage and offstage with him. And one of the reasons I think these solo shows are so successful is that people are seeing a whole new side of Gene, because he’s that way to the crowd onstage. He’s not in makeup. He’s not in the dragon boots. He’s not stomping around breathing fire. He’s just Gene. And he’s very casual, he’s talking to the audience, he gets people onstage every show and they sing with him, they take selfies with him. It’s a laugh a minute with him. He’s like an old Jewish Catskills comedian with the one liners and stuff.\n\nKiss is one of those bands fortunate enough to have an entire setlist’s worth of hits and anthems they basically have to play. In Gene’s solo band, you’re doing some of those songs but you’re also playing deeper cuts hardcore Kiss fans love, like “Charisma,” “Radioactive” and “Domino.” Got a favorite from those type of tunes?\n\nMy proudest moment is I got “Ladies Room” added to the set for a couple shows. That’s my favorite one. Yeah that was kind of the band’s goal, was to throw some of those in and our first show was in Vancouver, it was a big corporate event so those weren’t going to fly that well, so we did some covers and some of the bigger Kiss hits. Then after that (Gene) asked us, “What are some cool Kiss tunes we need to do instead of the covers?” We were like, “Oh man we’re we go!” So we sent him a list of, you know, “Love ’Em Leave ’Em,” “Ladies Room,” “Charisma,” “Got Love for Sale” and all of those. The cool thing is, if you follow the setlists we play a different set show – not all different songs but there are one or two that are different every time. And I love that. He likes to keep changing it up, which I think’s great.\n\nWhat has Gene Simmons laid out for you in terms of how much touring he’s going to be doing with his solo band?\n\nWell, in two weeks we take off for Japan, South America and Mexico. That’s going to be huge. And we’re playing Bolivia and I didn’t know there was a country Kiss hadn’t been to, but they haven’t been to Bolivia and neither has any member of Kiss been to Bolivia. And so after that, we have a couple more shows for November and we’re already booked into 2018. There’s some cool announcements coming up, so it’s pretty exciting stuff.\n\nThere’s also this extensive Gene Simmons Vault Experience box set coming out. Rock fans are particularly excited to hear the “Love Gun” demos that have Alex and Eddie Van Halen playing on them. Have you heard the Van Halen tracks from the Simmons Vault yet?\n\nNo. I've been wanting to hear those for decades. We knew like in advance, he kind of told us they were going to be on there but he hasn't played us anything so we haven't heard any of it. I hope we get a Christmas bonus this year – a nice 38-pound gift on my doorstep.
