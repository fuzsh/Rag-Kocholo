        "text": "BLOOMSBURGâ€”Bloomsburg University tailback Franklyn Quiteh (Tobyhanna, Pocono Mountain West) has been named one of 24 candidates in the running for the 2010 Harlon Hill Trophy as the NCAA Division II College Football Player of the Year. The list of candidates was announced Thursday by the National Harlon Hill Award Committee and includes six players from each of Division II's four Super Regionals.\n\nQuiteh, a red-shirt freshman, came into the season third on the team's depth chart (fourth after the spring game), but due to injury and other circumstances took over the starting role a week before the start of the season. He leads all of NCAA Division II in rushing yards per game with 163.8 yards per game, while his total of 1,638 yards is the fourth best single season mark in school history. Quiteh, who has scored 18 touchdowns, has rushed for more than 100 yards in nine of 10 games with three games of 200 or more yards.\n\nIn a win over East Stroudsburg in early October he rushed for a career-high 246 yards, while also getting 223 against against Millersville and 218 versus Clarion. is averaging 6.4 yards per carry. Quiteh has been named the PSAC East Offensive Player of the Week four times this season, including this past week when he rushed for 194 yards and fourt touchdowns against Kutztown.\n\nBloomsburg is 9-1 on the season and ranked 11th in the AFCA poll and second in the NCAA Super Region One. The Huskies will play on the road at Mercyhurst on Saturday starting at noon for the PSAC championship.\n\nPlayers for the Harlon Hill Award are nominated and voted on by the sports information directors at the 148 NCAA Division II football-playing institutions. The 24 initial candidates will be placed on regional ballots and the top two players from each of the four NCAA regions will advance to the national ballot when regional voting concludes on November 19.\n\nThe winner of the 2010 award, which is presented by the National Harlon Hill Award Committee, will be announced at the 25th annual Harlon Hill Trophy Presentation Banquet on Friday, December 17 at the Florence Conference Center at 6:30 p.m. This year's Hill Trophy Banquet will also include the 12th induction into the Division II Football Hall of Fame, with Ken Sparks, Mel Tjeerdsma and Bobby Wallace becoming the first coaches to be inducted.\n\nThe NCAA Division II Championship Game is scheduled for December 18 at Florence's Braly Municipal Stadium at 10 a.m. The Hill Trophy is sponsored by the City of Florence, Ala., Florence-Lauderdale Tourism, Opti-Net, the Marriott Shoals Hotel and Spa and Herff Jones. There were 31 candidates initially nominated by the sports information directors at their respective schools and those nominations were then reviewed by the Hill Regional Advisory Committees, which trimmed the list of candidates.\n\nIn 1997 Bloomsburg's Irv Sigler won the Harlon Hill Award, while in 2005 Jamar Brittingham finished third in the balloting.\n\n2010 Harlon Hill Trophy Candidates\n\nSUPER REGIONAL 1 Pos.
