Inspired by the music culture of the 1970s, he set out to combine his love for music with his growing interest in photography.

The band's original lineup consisted of Tom Keifer on lead vocals and guitar, Eric Brittingham on bass, Jeff LaBar on guitar, and Fred Coury on drums. They were known for their bluesy, guitar-driven sound, and their energetic live performances.\n\nCinderella released their debut album, \"Night Songs,\" in 1986, which included hits like \"Shake Me\" and \"Nobody's Fool.\" The album was a commercial success, reaching #3 on the Billboard 200 chart and being certified triple platinum. The band's follow-up album, \"Long Cold Winter,\" was released in 1988 and featured the hit single \"Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone).\" The album also featured a more blues-influenced sound and showcased Keifer's exceptional vocal range.\n\nCinderella's third album, \"Heartbreak Station,\" was released in 1990 and continued the band's success. The album included hits like \"The More Things Change\" and the title track \"Heartbreak Station.\" However, the band's popularity began to wane as the 1990s progressed, and they released their final album, \"Still Climbing,\" in 1994.\n\nDespite their commercial decline, Cinderella remained a beloved band among their fans and continued to tour throughout the 2000s. However, the band's original lineup never reunited, and in 2017, Keifer released a solo album called \"The Way Life Goes.\"\n\nIn addition to their music, Cinderella was known for their distinctive image. The band's look was inspired by glam and heavy metal, with Keifer often wearing a top hat and scarf, and the rest of the band wearing leather and spandex. The band's music videos also featured the band in various glamorous and theatrical settings."
