        "text": "We've long been fortunate to have outstanding students come through The MFA Program at Washington University, and we're very proud of how much our MFA alumni have gone on to accomplish since graduating. In terms of publications and awards, just since 2008, our graduates have won both the highest national honor for a first book of fiction (the 2009 PEN/Hemingway Award) and one of the top national awards for a story collection (the 2009 Drue Heinz Literature Prize); in poetry, their full-length book manuscripts have won the 2009 FIELD Poetry Prize, the Many Voices Project (MVP) Competition, the 2011 Les Figues NOS Book Contest, the 2012 New Issues Poetry Prize, and a 2013 Brittingham Prize. One was also named one of Publisher Weekly's Five Best Poetry Books of 2008.\n\nWe're proud to offer this list of news and accomplishments, which will be regularly updated. However, we're sure the list is incomplete. We have little news from anyone who graduated before 1996, and we're certain there is plenty that we're not aware of concerning more recent graduates as well. We need your help. If you came through the MFA program, please write to let us know what you have pursued since graduating, whether it has to do with your writing or not. And for those already on this list, please do continue to update us.\n\nIn the once-great Midwestern city of Trude, ornate old buildings lie in ruins, shrouded in disappointment and nostalgia. Trude has become a place to \"lose yourself,\" as one tourist brochure puts it: a treacherous maze of convoluted shopping malls, barricaded libraries, and elitist assisted-living homes.\n\nOne night at Trude's opera house, the theater's most celebrated mezzo-soprano vanishes during rehearsal. When the police come up empty-handed, her husband, a disconsolate legal clerk named Sven Norberg, takes up the quest on his own. To uncover the secret of his wife's disappearance, Norberg must descend into Trude's underworld and confront the menacing and bizarre citizens of his hometown: rebellious librarians, shifty music critics, a cop known as the Oracle, and the minister of an apocalyptic church who has recruited Norberg's teenage son. Faced with the loss of everything he loves, Norberg's investigation leads him to the heart of the city and through the buildings of a possibly insane modernist architect named Bernhard, whose elaborate vision offers him an astonishing revelation.\n\nWritten with boundless intelligence and razor-sharp wit, THE FACADES is a comic and existential mystery that unfolds at the urgent pace of a thriller.\n\nIt's a beautiful day in Newport, Rhode Island, when Phoebe Stone arrives at the grand Cornwall Inn, dressed in a green dress and gold heels, carrying no bags and arriving alone. Mistaken by everyone in the lobby for one of the wedding guests, Phoebe is actually the only person at the Cornwall not attending the big event. She has dreamed of coming here for years, hoping to shuck oysters and take sunset sails with her husband. Instead, she's here alone, at rock bottom, determined to have one last indulgent splurge on herself. Meanwhile, the bride has meticulously planned every detail of the weekend, accounting for every possible disaster except for Phoebe and her unexpected plans. This makes it all the more surprising when the two women find themselves confiding in each other.\n\nIn Alison Espach’s The Wedding People, absurd humor and tender moments intertwine, offering a nuanced and resonant look at the winding paths we take to places we never imagined, and the chance encounters that can reroute our lives.\n\nConor O'Toole has never experienced anything like Cutters Neck, a gated community near Cape Cod. It's a sweet summer deal: in exchange for tennis lessons, he receives free lodging in a luxurious guest cottage, far from the cramped Yonkers apartment he shares with his diabetic mother.\n\nIn this oceanfront paradise, new clients are hard to come by, and Conor has bills to pay. When Catherine, a sharp-tongued divorcée, offers double his usual rate, he soon realizes she expects additional, off-court services for her money. Conor tumbles into a secret erotic affair unlike anything he's experienced before.\n\nDespite his steamy flings with a woman twice his age, he simultaneously finds himself falling for an artsy, outspoken girl he meets on the beach. With cautious, strategic planning, Conor somehow manages this tangled web—until he makes one final, irreversible mistake.\n\nA dark, explosive literary thriller that brilliantly skewers the elite, Teddy Wayne's unputdownable novel is cinematic, shocking, and a psychological masterpiece.\n\nIt's 1930, the midst of the Great Depression. After her mysterious role in a family tragedy, passionate, strong-willed Thea Atwell, age fifteen, is cast out of her Florida home and exiled to an equestrienne boarding school for Southern debutantes. High in the Blue Ridge Mountains, the school's complex social strata are ordered by money, beauty, and girls’ friendships. The Yonahlossee Riding Camp for Girls is a far cry from the free-roaming, dreamlike childhood Thea shared with her twin brother on their family’s citrus farm—a world now partially shattered. As Thea grapples with her responsibility for the events of the past year that led her here, she finds herself enmeshed in a new order, one that will change her sense of what is possible for herself, her family, and her country.\n\nWeaving provocatively between home and school, the narrative powerfully unfurls the true story behind Thea’s expulsion from her family. But it isn’t long before the mystery of her past is rivaled by the question of how it will shape her future. Part scandalous love story, part heartbreaking family drama, this is an immersive, transporting page-turner—a vivid, propulsive novel about sex, love, family, money, class, home, and horses, all set against the ominous threat of the Depression—and the major debut of an important new writer.\n\nFrom the acclaimed author of The Yonahlossee Riding Camp for Girls comes a tale of enduring female friendship—full of its intense struggles and delights—set against a backdrop of affluence, elegance, and high expectations.\n\nJoan Fortier personifies Texas glamour, reigning supreme over the 1950s Houston social scene. With her tall, blonde beauty and commanding presence, she captivates both the men who desire her and the women who envy her. Cece Buchanan, Joan's lifelong friend, is seen as either her loyal companion or her accomplice, depending on who you ask. But when Joan's reckless behavior intensifies during the summer they turn twenty-five, Cece feels compelled to rein her in, leading to a single, consequential decision.\n\nThe After Party offers a mesmerizing glimpse into the world of the rich and glamorous during a memorable era, revealing a friendship as passionate, exhilarating, consuming, and complex as any romance.\n\nStarting work at just fourteen, Lydia Paar has held an impressive array of jobs—twenty-seven in total—across twenty-five homes in eight states. This collection of essays delves into her efforts to navigate and redefine the lower-middle-class American experience across a variety of urban and rural settings. From the bustling streets of Portland to the barren deserts, from Army basic training to long-distance bus rides, and even to the somber St. Louis funeral homes, Paar's journey is one of seeking peace, connection, and freedom.\n\nEach essay examines the internal emotional labor involved in her journey: the work of love and friendship, learning, movement, maintenance, and faith in the potential for positive change. Traversing diverse interior and exterior landscapes, Paar reflects on subcultures, agendas, violence, alliances, and the interplay between the natural world and human endeavors. Ultimately, she contemplates how our attempts at transformation often lead to our own transformation."
