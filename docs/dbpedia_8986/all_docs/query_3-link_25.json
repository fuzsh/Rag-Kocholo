        "text": "BAY CITY, MI — It's been nearly 30 years since Cinderella's debut album, \"Night Songs,\" was released, but guitarist Jeff LaBar believes the time has come for the band to write another chapter.\n\nThe band, best known for it's smash \"Don't Know What You've Got (Til it's Gone),\" begins writing that new chapter this week with the start of a new tour that kicks off Thursday in Cleveland and comes to Bay City on Friday.\n\nThe band takes to the stage at Veterans Memorial Park as part of the annual Dow Bay City River Roar concert. Cinderella follows sets by L.A. Guns and Skid Row.\n\n\"We got a little late start this year,\" said LaBar during a phone interview last week. \"We're going to start getting our things together, tech rehearsals and stuff (and) get on a bus on the 20th.\n\n\"(We're going to) Be on the road for as long we can. I have dates up to August, but we're continuing to book shows but we'll probably work as much as we can until the end of the year.\"\n\nFor LaBar, the brotherhood of Cinderella is as strong as ever and that type of camaraderie is enough to crank up the hit machine — including \"Night Moves,\" \"Long Cold Winter,\" and \"Nobody's Fool\" — once again.\n\n\"No record, just touring,\" he said. \"We did a Monsters of Rock Cruise in February. We did a summer tour last year.\n\n\"Not many bands from our genre are still all original and the ones that are don't get along too well. They need to stay separated. The four of us all still ride in the same bus. Everybody that I know that are all original each need their own separate bus.\"\n\nBuilt in the 1980s, Cinderella remains LaBar, drummer Fred Coury, lead vocalist Tom Keifer and bassist Eric Brittingham.\n\n\"Fred has a studio in L.A. and just got married for the first time,\" LaBar said. \"He does a lot of commercial work, stuff for Disney, television and movie work. Tom has been working on a solo record for a while; also has an 8-year-old that keeps him busy. Eric has two babies, a 1- and a 2-year-old. He started a second family with his second wife. The other three of us are all on our second marriages.\"\n\nOnce based in Philadelphia, the band now calls Nashville home.\n\n\"It happened one by one, Fred moved first,\" said LaBar. \"He split out of Philly and moved to Nashville and bought Conway Twitty's old studio.\"\n\nKeifer arrived in Music City USA one year later and Brittingham followed two years after that.\n\n\"I was the last hold-out,\" said LaBar. \"By the time I got here in '04, I was waiting for my son to get older (and) Fred had already moved to L.A. He has a really successful studio out there now.\"\n\nNashville has become a hot-bed for '80s musicians according to LaBar.\n\n\"A lot of '80s band members live here. Some of my neighbors are like Mark Slaughter (Slaughter vocalist), Troy Luccketta (Tesla drummer), Kip Winger (Winger vocalist and bassist) and Paul Taylor from Winger who is going to tour with us and play keyboards. He's been one of my neighbors for years. The (rock) music business kind of moved here.\"\n\nWith nothing new recorded in nearly two decades, LaBar said he wants to get the ball rolling on writing some new tunes.\n\n\"Not as of yet,\" he stated. \"I think I'm going to start talking about that though. We still enjoy each others' company. We don't get together that often. We see each other every now and then. But we only tour for a few months in the summer time. So it's always fun for us to get back together.\"\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nWHO: L.A. Guns, Skid Row and Cinderella\n\nWHAT: Dow Bay City River Roar\n\nWHEN: Friday, June 22, doors at 5 pm\n\nWHERE: Bay City Veterans Memorial Park\n\nCOST: $25 (VIP SOLD OUT)"
