CINDERELLA bassist Eric Brittingham's side band, NAKED BEGGARS, have issued the following update:

"Hey just wanted to let everyone know that our show plans have changed for Saturday, April 19th!!!

The Bad News - If you were planning on coming to the Concord, NC show at Coyote’s on 4/19, we regret to inform you that show has been canceled by the club. Apparently the venue canceled us, booked another band for that night, and didn’t even let us know! Luckily, we became aware that this was happening from one of our friends before we actually showed up to play there!

The Good News - The April 19th Naked Party has officially been moved to Plum Krazy Too in Kernersville, NC (just outside Greensboro)!!! So mark your calendars, and come out and party with us at PKII’s next Saturday night!"
