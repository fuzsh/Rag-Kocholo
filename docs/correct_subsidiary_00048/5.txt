Intel Corp. today announced plans to acquire Shiva Corp. (Bedford, Mass., www.shiva.com ), a remote access and virtual private networking software company founded in 1985.

Under the merger agreement, Shiva will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel, and will operate as part of the Intel Networks Product division. Intel said it would maintain Shiva's entire product line, but that over time the products would be integrated into Intel's networking product line.
