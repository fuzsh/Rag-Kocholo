        "text": "Adaptec Inc. purchased the German storage vendor ICP Vortex Computersysteme GmbH on Wednesday from Intel Corp., continuing a streak of Adaptec acquisitions and Intel divestitures.\n\nFinancial terms of the deal were not disclosed. ICP Vortex, in Neckarsulm, Germany, makes controllers for RAID (redundant array of independent disks) storage products, such as hard drives based on the Serial ATA (advanced technology attachment), iSCSI (Internet small computer systems interface) or Fibre Channel standards.\n\nICP’s hardware and software products help administrators manage the flow of information between storage devices and servers. Intel bought the company in March 2001.\n\nAdaptec will add ICP’s products to its own line of storage products, it said in a press release. The Milpitas, Calif.-based company bought another storage vendor, Eurologic Systems, in March.\n\nIntel purchased a number of companies and businesses in different markets over the last few years, but has sold off some of those units and discontinued others as the company renews its focus on designing and manufacturing chips.\n\nThis year, Intel has sold its Trillium Digital Systems Inc. subsidiary, which makes telecommunications software, to Continuous Computing Corp. In 2002, Intel sold its LANDesk network management software, dissolved its Web hosting business, and offloaded subsidiary company Shiva Corp., a maker of virtual private network appliances."
