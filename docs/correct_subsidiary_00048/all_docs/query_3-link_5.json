        "text": "Industry\n\nSoftware\n\nLocation\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWebsite\n\nhttps://www.aidentified.com/\n\nStage\n\nSeries A\n\nWelcome to a fresh perspective on data analytics and customer engagement with Aidentified.\n\nLed by Founder and Chief Commercial Officer Darr Aley, along with Co-CEO and Founder Tom Aley, and Co-CEO Tom Rauker, this AI-powered platform revolutionizes how brands connect with clients and prospects by merging professional and household data for a complete 360Âº view.\n\nAidentifiedâs unique relationship-based prospecting, powered by AI and machine learning, draws from over 210 million consumer and 100 million professional U.S. profiles.\n\nThe platform provides essential insights into customer behaviors, real-time wealth events, and nuanced relationship mapping, enabling better decision-making across various industries.\n\nLet's hear from the co-founder of Aidentified.\n\nPlease Introduce Yourself and Tell Us About Your Startup?\n\nI'm Darr Aley, co-founder and Chief Commercial Officer at Aidentified. Iâm an entrepreneur who has been lucky to work with Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk in areas that include mergers and acquisitions, business development, strategy, and operations.\n\nI have started, invested, and/or joined companies in every stage of development (napkin to IPO) and seen them through to billions of dollars in exit value.\n\nIncluded in these were executive roles for Shiva (sold to Intel), Avatar (sold to DCA), Ziff-Davis Publishing (Softbank), Zip2 (Compaq), WhoWhere (Lycos), and Epylon (Accenture). Iâve spent the last twenty years building companies in the B2B and B2C data analytics segments.\n\nPrior to starting Aidentified with my brother Tom, we built and sold data analytics company, Generate (News Corp, 2008) and invested in Netprospex (D&B, 2015). Prior to Generate, I was at Amazon.com where I helped direct corporate development and M&A.\n\nOverview of Aidentified\n\nAidentified is a pioneering AI-powered platform founded by Darr Aley and his brother, Tom Aley, designed to transform the way businesses connect with potential clients and donors.\n\nThe platform merges AI with extensive data analytics, offering a unique combination of professional and household data to provide a comprehensive 360Âº view of clients and prospects. This enables a highly personalized approach to prospecting and customer engagement.\n\nUtilizing proprietary AI and machine learning technology, Aidentified accesses over 210 million consumer and 100 million professional profiles in the U.S., allowing brands to gain unparalleled insights into customer behaviors and relationships.\n\nThe platform is especially beneficial for sectors like wealth management, real estate, and higher education, where it streamlines the often cumbersome and costly processes of identifying and reaching out to potential leads.\n\nAidentifiedâs services are trusted by major organizations, including Four Seasons, Northwestern Mutual, and Merrill Lynch, reflecting its effectiveness in enhancing customer relationship management.\n\nThe platform not only helps identify the warmest paths for engagement but also provides real-time wealth events and detailed relationship mapping, which are critical for making informed business decisions.\n\nWith continuous improvements and expansions in data capabilities, Aidentified is set to keep advancing its technology to better serve its users, promising more refined and expansive relationship mapping and customer segmentation in the future.\n\nThis commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction underscores Aidentifiedâs role as a leader in the data enrichment and AI-driven prospecting space.\n\nWhat Problem(s) Does Your Startup Solve?\n\nMy brother Tom Aley and I founded the company as a way to streamline the costly and time-intensive process of identifying and reaching out to sales leads, prospective donors and potential customers for wealth managers, universities, real estate agents and others.\n\nOf note, Aidentified has customers at Four Seasons, Northwestern Mutual and Merrill Lynch, as well as a number of SMBs in the financial space to name a few.\n\nHow Did Your Startup Gain Its Initial Momentum? Share Successful Strategies or Future Plans.\n\nWe actually practiced what we preach and made personal connections with people from various parts of our lives. We pitched friends, family, colleagues and their connections as well. Aidentified was created to help people and organizations create more meaningful relationships.\n\nRight now, in sales and marketing, outbound communication follows a âspray and prayâ methodology. Aidentified's solution powers more relevant, targeted outreach enabling a cultural shift in how relationships are created, and how they work.\n\nMillions of profiles and billions of mapped connections discovered through AI and ML sourcing numerous public sites allow users to identify shared relationships to initiate a warm introduction.\n\nThatâs a long way of saying weâve used our platform to find and invest in qualified leads to build our business.\n\nWhat Were the Biggest Hurdles in Gaining Traction, and How Did You Overcome Them?\n\nYou need believers on your side, and you need them to tell everyone they know. You can have the worldâs greatest product, but you need users to vouch for you.\n\nOnce we started winning a few accounts, they saw immediate benefit to their business and started telling their friends and colleagues. It also helps that one of the largest industries we serve is wealth management.\n\nIn that industry, connections are everything. We consistently build our business through a network of happy customers who want to share that we are a bit of a âsecret weapon.â\n\nFrom your perspective, what's missing in the current startup environment?\n\nThe current startup environment hasnât changed much over the last few decades. Itâs often all about who you know and tapping personal connections.\n\nThat kind of culture is severely limiting and exclusionary for entrepreneurs who may not yet have connections in âhigh upâ places. Thatâs ultimately a disservice to all of us who could benefit from whatever idea that specific entrepreneur may have.\n\nWhat Hurdles Did You Encounter While Fundraising, and How Did You Tackle Them?\n\nFundraising is not for the faint of heart. The amount of candid (and sometimes harsh) feedback we received when we did our Series A was invaluable.\n\nA lot of it was sometimes hard to hear, but we made improvements in the technology and the company as a whole thanks to the feedback investors gave us.\n\nIt was a gift. I always advise fellow entrepreneurs to see the fundraising process as that: a gift. You have to be ready for people to essentially âcall your baby ugly,â but most of the time these folks know exactly what they are talking about and want to help.\n\nWhatâs Next for Your Startup? Any Exciting Developments on the Horizon?\n\nYes. We are constantly making tweaks and improvements to our platform to best serve our customers.Some examples include our AI mapped relationships.\n\nAidentified employs AI to visualize user connections with prospects and harness our clients' networks for referrals. In 2022, the company mapped 4 billion 1st-degree relationships and 100 million 2nd-degree relationships. Fast-forward to 2023, these numbers have surged to 16 billion 1st-degree connections and a staggering 400 billion 2nd-degree connections.\n\nWhile platforms like LinkedIn provide visibility into shared connections, for example, there is no other technology that identifies key personal and professional connections in the same capacity and scale as Aidentified.\n\nAdditionally, we have a wealth segmentation model that encompasses 210 million individuals across the United States, spanning from less than $100k to over $1 billion in wealth.\n\nIn 2022, we utilized three key attributes: inferred income, property value, and remaining share balances. In 2023, Aidentified elevated its segmentation capabilities by integrating multiple properties, age, career data, trigger events (such as IPOs, Investments Received, and Acquisitions), and IRS zip+4 tax information.\n\nTo that end, the amount of data we have collected to date is staggering: 100B+ mapped relationships; 210M+ consumer profiles; 100M+ professional profiles; and $20T+ in tracked wealth events.\n\nWhat Trends in Your Industry Are You Most Excited About or Concerned By?\n\nIâm most excited by the untapped potential in artificial intelligence. We really have only scratched the surface of what this particular technology is capable of. I think as long as we remain focused on how AI can best serve humans; to build, amplify and strengthen meaningful human relationships, AI will be an extraordinarily powerful and beneficial tool in the business space (and beyond!).\n\nIf You Could Go back and Give Yourself One Piece of Advice at the Start of Your Journey, What Would It Be?\n\nSolve a problem that you have in your personal or professional life. Build the solution. Thatâs exactly what Tom and I did with Aidentified. We worked to find a solution to the significant time and money prospecting takes.\n\nWe felt personally invested. We had skin in the game. That has made all the difference in getting Aidentified off the ground and serving a variety of really incredible customers.\n\nYour idea can change the world, let's make it a reality!\n\nIgnite Your Vision\n\nKick off your startup with our easy website tools.
