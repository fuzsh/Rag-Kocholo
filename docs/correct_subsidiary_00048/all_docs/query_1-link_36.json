        "text": "What was Intel thinking? Was a vision of a hyper-connected future -- powered by hyper-secure embedded microprocessors -- a big factor?\n\nLast month, Intel Corp.'s near-$8 billion acquisition of security specialist McAfee Inc. had industry watchers scratching their heads. Several weeks later, a lot of people still haven't stopped scratching.\n\n\"[P]eriodically, deals arise that so thoroughly contradict conventional wisdom that supporters and critics alike are shocked to their cores,\" writes industry veteran Charles King, a principal with consultancy PUND-IT, who describes Intel's acquisition of McAfee as \"just such a deal.\"\n\nIt isn't as though Intel Corp. were a stranger to security, or that a case can't be made for incorporating a bigger or more robust set of security features into its products.\n\nInstead of pulling the trigger on a tactical acquisition to shore up its semiconductor portfolio -- as Cisco Systems Inc. did earlier this year when it acquired Rohati Systems, a start-up that specialized in \"agentless transactionless\" network security gear -- Intel made a big strategic move.\n\nGartner Inc. research vice president Leslie Fiering sees it as just that. Fiering places the gambit in the context of McAfee's own M&A efforts that helped make the company especially attractive to Intel.\n\n\"Intel's announced acquisition of McAfee is not a one-off opportunistic deal. It is part of a larger strategy to enhance Intel's security capabilities as it follows other recent acquisitions of tenCube and Trust Digital,\" writes Fiering in a Gartner blog post. \"The goal is to collect and develop [intellectual property] that can go directly to silicon and bring security down to the hardware level. The embedded security will run outside the OS with a broad variety of software developer hooks. It is highly unlikely that Intel will make any of these proprietary or in any way specific to McAfee.\"\n\nStrange Bedfellows\n\nMcAfee is one of the biggest players in the business. It still markets its bread-and-butter antivirus products, but it' is also a player in endpoint security; intrusion detection and prevention (via its IntruCept appliances and host-based EnterCept technology); forensics and risk mitigation; network admission control; and many other consumer- and/or enterprise-oriented security disciplines, as its recent acquisitions of both tenCube and Trust Digital demonstrate.\n\nIntel's stake in security research has waxed and waned over time.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, it fielded its own client-oriented security and antivirus products (via its LANDesk brand); by the late-1990s, however, it had divested itself of its LANDesk security software. In the early 2000s, Microsoft introduced Data Execution Prevention (DEP) for x86 and IA-64 versions of its Windows XP (Service Pack 2) and Windows Server 2003 operating systems. DEP exploited hardware-level support in Intel's Pentium 4, Xeon, and Itanium microprocessors."
