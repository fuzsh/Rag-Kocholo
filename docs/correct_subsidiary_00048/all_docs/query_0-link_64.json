        "text": "Companies that waded deep into the red\n\nJul 20, 2016, 04:50:10 PM IST\n\n1/6\n\nCompanies that waded deep into the red\n\nText: Satya Kandala, ET Bureau\n\nS Kumars Nationwide, a company run by Nitin Kasliwal, has filed for bankruptcy. The company owes Rs 4,500 crore to 134 banks.\n\nHowever, the company which gained prominence for dressing some of the most influential people in the world, such as Barack Obama, isn’t the first big business name to file for bankruptcy.\n\nHere are a few others.\n\n2/6\n\nAmitabh Bachchan Corporation Limited\n\nEstablished in 1996, ABCL projected a turnover of Rs 20 billion by 2000. However, from producing films which also starred Amitabh Bachchan, to sponsoring the Miss World pageant, the company lost millions and was in a deep financial mess.\n\nIn 1999, ABCL approached BIFR ( Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction) to be rated as a sick company. Bachchan ultimately repaid the creditors thanks to his films and the success of Kaun Banega Crorepati.\n\n3/6\n\nLehman Brothers\n\nIt was the fourth-largest investment bank in the United States of America when it declared bankruptcy in 2008.\n\nThe company filed after citing debt of around $613 billion.\n\nThis resulted in a stock market crash, with the company’s shares falling up to 94 per cent, which ultimately added to the then ongoing global financial crisis.\n\nLehman Brothers is now a liquidating company.\n\n4/6\n\nSIVA group\n\nIndian businessman Chinnakannan Sivasankaran and his company SIVA group were declared bankrupt by the Supreme Court of Seychelles in 2014.\n\nThe group’s numerous creditors include BMIC, a Bahrain Telecom company.\n\n‘Sterling Siva’ (as Sivasankaran is popularly called) also filed for bankruptcy for his Finland-headquartered turbine venture in October 2013.\n\nThe serial entrepreneur had a 74 per cent stake in Aircel, which he sold to Maxis Corporation in 2006. He has recently invested in a Chennai-based taxi aggregator app.\n\n5/6\n\nMarvel Entertainment Group\n\nWith an increasing number of superhero movie releases each year and with most of them grossing millions of dollars, it’s hard to believe that almost twenty years ago in 1996, Marvel Comics’ parent group Marvel Entertainment Group filed for bankruptcy.\n\nA new corporation formed with the Toy Biz (toy division of Marvel Entertainment) and a plan to go into films with the creation of Marvel Studios, saved the company and made it the money-spinner it is today.\n\n6/6\n\nGeneral Motors\n\nThe American multinational company that is headquartered in Detroit was founded in 1908 as General Motors Corporation.\n\nA hundred years later in 2009, as one of the world’s largest automobile manufacturing companies, it filed for bankruptcy.\n\nWith the help of US Treasury and a government-led sale of the manufacturer and some of its subsidiaries, the company was restructured to form the General Motors Company, which has been reporting annual profits since 2010."
