        "text": "Synopsis\n\nChinnakannan Sivasankaran, chairman and founder of SIVA Group, emphasizes preventing heart attacks by managing APOB levels to avoid heart disease risks.\n\nHeartattack is one of the major cause of death in India but it is totally preventable, according to Chinnakannan Sivasankaran, the chairman and founder at SIVA Group.\n\nSivasankaran said this in a podcast interview with YouTuber Raj Shamani.\n\nSivasankaran said it is easy to predict heartattack. \"You just need to take your APOB...Keep it under 30-40. You will not get heartattack for 10 years.\"\n\nAPOB or Apolipoprotein is a type of protein found in the outer shell of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol particles, often referred to as “bad cholesterol.”\n\nAccording to National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) study, 32,457 individuals succumbed to heart attacks in 2022, a significant leap from the 28,413 deaths recorded in the preceding year. Earlier Global Burden of Disease Study claimed that heart disease is the leading cause of death among women in India, accounting for almost 18% of all female deaths.\n\nNCBI earlier said that cardiovascular disease such as ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular such as stroke account for 17.7 million deaths and are the leading cause. India accounts for one-fifth of these deaths worldwide especially in younger population.\n\n\"CVDs strike Indians a decade earlier than the western population.2 For us Indians, particular causes of concern in CVD are early age of onset, rapid progression and high mortality rate. Indians are known to have the highest coronary artery disease (CAD) rates, and the conventional risk factors fail to explain this increased risk,\" NCBI says in its website.\n\n\"Indians are liable to get hospitalized 2–4 times more frequently for complications of CAD, in comparison with other ethnic groups, and admission rates are 5–10 times higher for populations younger than 40 years. The prevalence of CAD in Indians living in India is 21.4% for diabetics and 11% for nondiabetics. The prevalence of CAD in rural parts of country is nearly half than that in urban population,\" NCBI added.\n\nMeanwhile, in the podcast, Sivasankaran also said that people who got Covid twice suffer from many side-effects including brain fog.\n\nHe went on to claim that 70 per cent Indians suffer from brain fog.\n\nBrain fog is defined as a condition in which the patient may face memory problems, such as lack of mental clarity and an inability to focus.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nWhy leading doctors and scientists pin hope on green jackfruit to fight fatty liver and cancer\n\nYoungsters are roaming around derivatives fire.
