        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO Intel Corp. said on Thursday it agreed to acquire networking chip maker Level One Communications Inc. for $2.2 billion in stock in a move to expand its fast-growing networking business. The acquisition marks Intel's largest in a string of recent deals focused on its networking business, which provides networking cards, motherboards and other equipment for homes and small to medium-sized businesses.\n\nIt also sells fast networking cards to large corporations. Sacramento, California-based Level One makes semiconductors used in high-speed telecommunications and data communications networks. The company develops so-called mixed signal chips, which combine analogue and digital technology for use in both local area networks and wide area networks. From a silicon point of view, we are very small (in networking) and we don't participate in those markets today and that is the purpose of this acquisition, said Mark Christensen, vice president and group manager of Intel's Network Communications Group, on a conference call.\n\nIntel has beefed up its networking business, in part through acquisitions that focus on the small to medium business arena. Just Monday, Intel closed a $185 million deal to buy Shiva Corp., which develops virtual private network equipment and remote access servers. This was the largest acquisition in our company's history and it is the foundation for our growth in this area, Christensen said.\n\nIf the cultures and the personalities and the vision had not been so closely aligned, I don't know if this deal would have happened. Ashok Kumar, a Piper Jaffray analyst, said that Intel was making networking a big focus because it realized that in order for customers to buy higher cost PCs with more processing power, they must have faster networking capabilities and the ability to get more kinds of data through the network.\n\nWhile the crown jewels continue to remain the microprocessors, they realize that without the additional bandwidth and broadband access to the client side, it is a hard sell to attract customers to the sweet spot of the computing market, Kumar said. It's a good strategic fit. Last July, Intel and Level One formed a pact to develop high-speed corporate local area networking technology.\n\nOur strategy is to be a major building block supplier in all aspects of this networking business, said Intel chief executive Craig Barrett, during a conference call. They also said they do not expect any regulatory hurdles in the deal. Level One chief executive Robert Pepper will join Intel as vice president of the company's Network Communications Group and general manager of the Level One components division.\n\nLevel One generated 1998 revenues of $263 million and had about 830 employees. It will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel. The company is a fabless semiconductor company, meaning that it does not manufacture its own chip designs, but contracts them out to other companies. That manufacturing strategy will stay in place after the deal is completed. Analysts said Level One's main competitors include networking chip makers Broadcom Corp. and PMC-Sierra Inc. (Reuter)"
