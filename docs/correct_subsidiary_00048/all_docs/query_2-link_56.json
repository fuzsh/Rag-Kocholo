        "text": "1. Intel: Building a Technology BrandByM.KrishnanSashidharan.SP.Vijaykumar\n\n2. The Intel Inside Campaign\n\n4. Value of Intel Inside Logo to consumersMarket Cap before branding was $1 billion. By 2003, after the campaign was implemented, it reached $5 billion. This growth of shareholder value illustrates the power of Intel’s branding strategy.In 1992, the first year of “Intel Inside” campaign, worldwide sales rose 63%. Awareness of the Intel logo amongst European PC purchasers grew from 24% at the start of “Intel Inside” campaign in 1991, to 94% by 1995 and in 2001\n\n5. StrengthsIntel found a way of taking away the mystery of the product, gaining the confidence of the end consumers that “Intel Inside” represented quality and reliabilityIt concentrated on increasing derived demandAdopted both push and pull strategyRelevant and simplified understanding of chips to customersAssociated Intel with processors, thus helping launch future chip launches\n\n7. WeaknessesIntel Inside theme made it difficult to diversify across other product lines apart from microprocessor without changing the themeConflict with Tier-1 OEMs\n\n8. Intel Inside Brand Equity Active Engagement\n\n9. Marcom Award, Grand MarquisResonanceTrust\n\n10. Self respect\n\n11. Tech Savvy\n\n12. Technology Leader\n\n13. Innovator\n\n15. Compatibility\n\n16. Speed\n\n17. CPU Brand\n\n19. Technology Driven\n\n20. Name of the CompanyPerformanceImagerySalience Co-operative Advertising with OEM’S\n\n21. Intel brand name linked with MicroprocessorsContinued use of PentiumIntel Pentium had garnered huge brand recognition through press, technical magazines and ads.Discontinuation of this theme would have meant drainage of efforts and resources put into building the brand PentiumAlso, introduction of processors happened every next year making it impractical to launch promotion campaign for every product\n\n22. What should AMD do?AMD cannot even imagine a campaign like that of Intel’sIntel has already established a name for itself in the customer’s mind through its campaign, so if AMD does something similar it would not prove to be as effective as Intel’s campaignAMD should focus on better value for money, increased efficacy and penetration into frugal markets as PC industry is stagnating\n\n23. Intel’s SegmentationIntel’s segmentation was based on performance which varied with price. Depending on it, the target market also differed.Having a technological product with its specifications upfront actually helps the customer appreciate the benefits and shortcomings at the time of purchase and prevents any dissatisfaction thereafter.It gives a wider coverage of the marketXeon performed poorly in comparison to Opteron and it definitely needs up gradation\n\n25. Was it the right move?At the time of the case study the sales and production of computer were stagnating, as PDA’s and cell phones were on the rise and it creates a great opportunity for Intel to use their brand equity from the computer market and translate that into the cell phone and PDA.A need to cut through the clutter of competitive activityMarketing with the help of Steve Jobs! Partner with giants in other industries. E.g. Google – Electricity, WiFi"
