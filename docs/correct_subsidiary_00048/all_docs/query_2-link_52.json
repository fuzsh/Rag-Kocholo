        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThe Shivas are viewed as the 'radical rebels' or the 'exotic spiritual gurus' who get standing ovation at corporate functions and economic forums.\n\nDevdutt Pattanaik\n\nHindu mythology speaks of the creator Brahma, preserver Vishnu and destroyer Shiva. Conventionally, we take it to mean someone who creates a business or organization, preserves it and destroys it. This makes Brahma an admirable figure (the entrepreneur?) while Shiva not a very pleasant one. Yet, there are no temples to Brahma in India. Yes, yes, there is one, or two, but nothing compared to the popularity of Vishnu and Shiva.\n\nThis is a classical case of categorical error. We are using a biblical template, where God is creator, to understand Hindu mythology. Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva refer to mental states and traditionally in Hinduism the Brahma mindset is frowned upon while Shiva and Vishnu are adored. In fact, understanding of this mindset enables us to appreciate what ails corporations today.\n\nTo understand Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, we need a framework, one that has desi roots. The Vedas provide this framework. It is ritual of yagna, where the process-owner (yajaman) invokes a beneficiary (devata) and gives (svaha) in order to receive (tathastu). One can say, yajaman is the investor, devata is the investee, svaha is the investment and tathastu is the return on investment. Yagna is thus an exchange, the characteristic feature of civilized human society. It has wrongly been translated as sacrifice by European Orientalists.\n\n> Brahma is a yajaman who performs the yagna, paying attention only to the tathastu more on returns than on investment.\n\n> Vishnu is a yajaman who is as much concerned about the svaha as he is about the tathastu.\n\n> Shiva is a yajaman who is not interested in the yagna at all as he has outgrown hunger and so does not need tathastu.\n\nThe yagna presupposes hunger. We want to satisfy our desires and so start a business or take up a job. We satisfy our desires (tathastu for yajaman) by satisfying someone else's desire first (svaha for devata).\n\nBrahma is unworthy of worship because he is more interested in his hunger than that of others; much like many of the shareholders of today's corporate world, who constantly seek unending growth and profit quarter by quarter, with increasing margins every year, at the cost of the larger good of society.\n\nBrahma mindset can be divided into two: Indra and Daksha Prajapati.\n\n> Indra is like a child, who constantly seeks self-gratification. His name is derived from 'indriyas' and he enjoys the pleasures of the world with a sense of entitlement. He sees himself as king of the world, hence, he is king of devas. These are the members of the privileged 'old money' club who are insecure about the 'new money' club of first-generation entrepreneurs.\n\n> Daksha is like a parent, who feels secure only when he is in control and telling people what they should do. He loves the institutional model of business where everyone is aligned by a single goal – creating shareholder value. He is the control freak, who rules by reward and fear and who loves to regulate. Shiva cuts his head off.\n\nShiva is the hermit, the monk, who rejects the ways of Brahma. For it does not bring peace of mind. It creates stress, restlessness, insecurity and a continuous sense of siege. He promotes renunciation and an end of all material aspirations. He seeks to outgrow hunger and succeeds. He withdraws and condemns.\n\nUnfortunately, the Shiva mindset cannot sustain society. Not everyone can outgrow hunger. Common folk love the satisfaction of desires. We love our things. We may not be greedy but we do have material aspirations. And so in the scriptures Shiva is encouraged to marry (a metaphor for social engagement) and transform into Shankara, the benevolent one, who is less eastern and more accommodating of the devata's hunger.\n\nVishnu understands the hunger of all stakeholders. He establishes culture so that everyone can enjoy material benefits. But while doing so, he constantly provokes people by displaying the inadequacy of material things and rules of the yagna. He makes people think beyond themselves. The yagna for Vishnu exists for the devata, not himself. He is merely a facilitator. As yajaman, he seeks to transform the devata into yajaman, preferably one who is also Vishnu.\n\nOf course, using the modern discourse, we can call Vishnu as the 'giver'. But the concept of unconditional giving or unconditional taking does not exist in Hindu mythology. Every action has a consequence. There are no 'final solutions' to problems; in fact, every solution comes with its own set of problems. This is karma, an idea missing in modern economic and political discourses that are 'solution-oriented'.\n\nIn many ways, modern management principles promote Indra and Daksha. The Shivas are viewed as the 'radical rebels' or the 'exotic spiritual gurus' who get standing ovation at corporate functions and economic forums. Vishnu remains ignored. The yajaman who grows by helping others grow, for whom business is much than about tathastu.\n\nDevdutt Pattanaik is the author of 'Business Sutra — a very Indian approach to management\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n4 reasons why MFs are stocking up on CreditAccess Grameen and other microfinance lenders\n\nOnce declared dead, Nifty Next 50 is up 70%.
