        "text": "This article delves into Wipro’s collaboration with Intel Foundry to enhance the design of AI chips\n\nWipro Limited, a leading IT company, has announced an expanded collaboration with Intel Foundry, the chip manufacturing arm of Intel Corporation, to accelerate innovation in artificial intelligence (AI) chip design. As a key Design Services and Alliance Partner, Wipro will collaborate with Intel Foundry to speed up the design and development of Intel’s most advanced process nodes, such as the Intel18A.\n\nThe global AI chip market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38 percent annually from 2023 to 2032. This collaboration between Wipro and Intel Foundry is designed to address the rising demand for AI chip manufacturing, especially in sectors such as automotive, industrial, and telecommunications. These sectors are looking to leverage AI-driven solutions to enhance their products and services, as well as to gain a competitive edge in the market.\n\nWipro has strong expertise in design services, spanning chip design, verification, physical design, and post-silicon validation. Wipro also has deep domain knowledge in AI, cloud, edge, and IoT technologies, which are essential for developing next-generation AI chips. Wipro will leverage these capabilities to help Intel Foundry’s customers design and develop high-performance, low-power, and cost-effective AI chips, using Intel’s cutting-edge process technologies.\n\nIntel Foundry is a new business unit within Intel that offers world-class foundry services to a diverse range of customers, including fabless chipmakers, integrated device manufacturers, system integrators, and original equipment manufacturers. Intel Foundry aims to provide access to Intel’s leading-edge process nodes, as well as its intellectual property portfolio, design enablement tools, and packaging solutions. Intel Foundry also plans to expand its global manufacturing footprint, with new fabs in Arizona, Ireland, and Israel.\n\nIntel Foundry’s collaboration with Wipro is part of its Intel Foundry Direct Connect program, which connects customers with qualified design service partners who can help them optimize their chip designs for Intel’s process technologies. Wipro is one of the first design service partners to join this program and demonstrate its readiness for Intel’s platforms.\n\nAtul Kapur, Vice President, and Business Head – HiTech, Wipro Limited, said, This new collaboration with Intel Foundry marks a significant step towards becoming a part of the semiconductor industry. This opens new options for Wipro while also supporting chip supply and manufacturing. Together with Intel, we will provide our clients with silicon devices that use established industry-standard processes and process technologies from Intel Foundry. We will be targeting new startup markets, particularly in the Gen AI field, to assist our clients in shortening their time to market.\n\nRahul Goyal, Vice President and General Manager of product and design Ecosystem Enablement, at Intel Foundry, said, we are delighted to have Wipro join us and demonstrate their readiness for our platforms at Intel Foundry Direct Connect. Wipro has a long history of delivering value across industries, and we are thrilled to collaborate with them for the benefit of our mutual worldwide clients.\n\nWipro is also investing US$1 billion in its AI360 ecosystem, which is a comprehensive suite of AI solutions and services for enterprises. The AI360 ecosystem complements Wipro’s ongoing collaboration with Intel in AI-driven chip manufacturing. This strategic investment, coupled with the partnership with Intel Foundry, aims to empower businesses to realize their growth objectives by harnessing the power of AI."
