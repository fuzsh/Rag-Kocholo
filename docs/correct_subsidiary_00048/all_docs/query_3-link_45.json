        "text": "Speaker: Krzysztof Gajos\n\nDate: 2015-12-03 12:00:00\n\nLocation: TSRB 132 (Ball Room)\n\nAbstract:\n\nKrzysztof will share results of two projects, both of which are a part of our larger effort to develop gic rather than social mechanisms for coordinating work, which enables productive use of even the smallest human contributions. Unlike conventional crowdsourcing, organic crowdsourcing leverages participants' intrinsic motivation to attract free, high quality contributions from knowledgeable participants.\n\nLabintheWild.org is a platform for conducting behavioral experiments with unpaid online volunteers. Volunteers from all over the world participate in LabintheWild studies in exchange for personalized feedback on their performance. Over the past three years, LabintheWild has attracted nearly 3 million distinct visitors from over 200 countries and resulted in over 1 million completed experimental sessions. We have validated this platform by demonstrating that results obtained on LabintheWild match those obtained in traditional laboratory settings. LabintheWild has made it possible for us to conduct research that would not have been feasible with traditional methods. Krzysztof will summarize the findings from several experiments conducted on LabintheWild and synthesize the emerging set of best practices for designing studies that attract intrinsically motivated participants and for ensuring validity of the data. Eneralizable mechanisms to engage intrinsically motivated online volunteers to collectively accomplish large tasks.\n\nThe Idea Hound project exemplifies our contributions to the largely unexplored area of \"organic\" crowdsourcing, an approach to human computation in which intrinsically motivated people contribute to algorithmically coordinated human computation workflows as a byproduct of performing activities that they find inherently valuable. In contrast to earlier peer production systems like Wikipedia, organic crowdsourcing relies on algorithm.\n\nBio:\n\nKrzysztof Gajos is an associate professor of Computer Science at the Harvard Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Krzysztof is broadly interested in intelligent interactive systems, a research area that bridges artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction. Recent projects pursued by his group contributed to diverse areas such as personalized adaptive user interfaces, systems for supporting collective creativity, organic crowdsourcing, large-scale experimentation in the wild, and learning technologies.\n\nPrior to arriving at Harvard, Krzysztof was a postdoctoral researcher at Microsoft Research. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Washington and his M.Eng. and B.Sc. degrees from MIT. In the Fall of 2005, he was visiting faculty at the Ashesi University in Accra, Ghana, where he taught Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. Krzysztof is a coeditor-in-chief of the ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems. He is a recipient of a Sloan Research Fellowship.\n\nSpeakers: Anders Sundaes Løvlie, Erik Grönvall, Anna Vallgårda\n\nDate:\n\n2015-10-15 12:00:00\n\nLocation:\n\nScheller College of Business - LeCraw Auditorium, Room 100\n\nAbstract:\n\nAs part of a collaborative workshop, Georgia Tech is hosting seven faculty members from Copenhagen IT University. These faculty have a wide range of research projects and interests including interaction and participatory design, videogames and new forms of play, cultural heritage, and material media. Three of the faculty will offer short presentations to indicate the breadth and depth of this work:\n\nPresenters:\n\nAnders Sundaes Løvlie -Playful Interfaces to Digital Cultural Heritage\n\nIn Europe, massive efforts have been made to digitize and make accessible online the large amount of cultural heritage objects on display in museums and other heritage institutions. While success is typically measured in the number of millions of objects that have been added to a database, few or none popular services for end-users have been created. This talk will take a brief look at the possibility of using playful design approaches to address this problem, based on a project proposal we are currently seeking funding for.\n\nAnders Sundnes Løvlie is Assistant Professor at ITU. His research focuses on communication design, locative media and online debate.\n\nErik Grönvall - Participation through design, use and the community\n\nThe way in which we involve diverse stakeholders in collaborative design processes (i.e. co-design) have changed drastically over the last 40 years. With the ‘third wave of HCI' we have moved both the design and use of technology out of the workplace and into peoples' everyday lives. As an effect, the use and appropriation of technology potentially involves more actors and distributed settings compared with a workplace scenario. The move from design to use within ‘third wave' co-design also emphasises participation (in society, the local community, etc) and how to design for participation. Using some recent and ongoing projects, this talk will briefly present aspects of participation, participatory design and co-design.\n\nErik Grönvall is an Associate Professor at ITU. His research foci are on Participatory Design and participation, physical computing and to understand the role of technology in everyday life (for example in out-of-clinic care).\n\nAnna Vallgårda - Giving form to computational things\n\nThe computer is no longer at the center of attention rather it is only one our of many materials which constitutes the computational things we use and design today. As a result what we design is not merely interfaces to well-known physical forms and forms of interaction. Instead interaction design has become a form-giving practice in which we have to deal with both physical form, temporal form, and the interaction gestalt. This talk will take a brief look at what the negotiations between the trinity of forms will entail in practice.\n\nAnna Vallgårda is an Associate Professor and Head of the IxD lab at ITU. Her research focuses on developing interaction design as a material practice through constructive design research.\n\nSpeaker: Yanni Loukissas\n\nDate: 2015-10-01 12:00:00\n\nLocation: TSRB 132 (Ball Room)\n\nAbstract:\n\nDespite their proliferation, data are surprisingly limited in scope. Even the largest data sets-promoted as ‘big data'-are merely aggregated indexes to what ethnographers call “local knowledge.” This talk calls attention to the myriad ways in which data are local: bounded by places, moments, communities and rituals. It asks, what are the implications of data provenance? Moreover, it offers a set of models for visualizing data in ways that highlight their specificity, rather than cleaning, filtering or effacing those characteristics. Making space for regional categories, historical terminology, place-based values and workplace errors can help us interpret data as an aggregate, rather than a monolithic source of information.\n\nConsider the following cases: NewsScape, an academic initiative based at UCLA, has accumulated video and transcripts for over three hundred thousand broadcast news programs from around the world; the Digital Public Library of America, a non-profit organization, has linked together millions of digitized resources from libraries, archives and museums; Zillow, an online real estate marketplace, has amassed sales data on more than one hundred million homes in the United States. Each of these endeavors draws together data from disparate locales, enabling panoramic views across distributed sites of collection. However, such vistas also evoke anxiety about the loss of cultural context for data and the material limits of its encoding. Though our capacity to amass diverse sources of data continues to expand, I argue that data can never fully transcend their traditional roles as tokens for more intimate forms of knowledge. This talk will offer insight into the heterogeneous structure of aggregated data sets, challenge dominant narratives around big data, and help audiences think about the varied ways and places in which data are made.\n\nBio:\n\nYanni Loukissas is an Assistant Professor of Digital Media in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication at Georgia Tech. His research draws together design and social studies of media technologies. Before coming to Georgia Tech, he was a lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, where he co-coordinated the Program in Art, Design and the Public Domain. He was also a principal at metaLAB, a research project of the Harvard Berkman Center for Internet and Society that explores digital futures for the arts and humanities. Additionally, he has taught at Cornell, MIT, and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts. Originally trained as an architect at Cornell University, he subsequently received a Master of Science and a PhD in Design and Computation at MIT. While at MIT, he worked with the Initiative on Technology and Self, the Media Lab, and the Center for Bits and Atoms. He also completed postdoctoral work at the MIT Program in Science, Technology and Society. He is the author of Co-Designers: Cultures of Computer Simulation in Architecture (Routledge, 2012).\n\nDate: 2015-04-16 12:00:00\n\nLocation: Centergy Building (Hodges Room, 3rd Fl) 75 5th Street, NW\n\nEach year, GVU provides seed grants, with support from IPaT, to research initiatives committed to building on our success in interdisciplinary research and innovation in the human experience of computing. These investments create a path for external funding as our research prospers.\n\n2014 - 2015 Research and Engagement Grants\n\nThe speakers for this Brown Bag session will discuss their respective research projects.\n\nTitle:\n\nAutism: in Numbers and Stories\n\nAbstract:\n\nAutism prevalence rates in the United States have more than doubled since 2000 (from 1 in 150 to 1 in 68 children being identified). Despite this trend as the nation's fastest growing developmental disability, many insurance providers, including Medicaid, do not cover autism services or early intervention services for autism.\n\nOur research project draws on policy research and human-­‐centered design research to build communication tools (“digital boundary objects”) that aid the public and legislators in understanding the negative economic impact of late intervention and providing an evidence base for the justification of passage and implementation of early intervention services in ASD. In this talk we will report on the website we developed incorporating qualitative stories of children and families with visualizations of latest evidence in autism policy research. This website is intended for policymakers to improve the continuum of care and interagency system of supports for children with autism. We foresee variations of these tools to be used by the public for raising awareness and enabling collective action.\n\nBios:\n\nNassim JafariNaimi is an Assistant Professor at the Digital Media program at Georgia Tech and the Director of the Design and Social Interaction Studio which she established in 2013. Nassim's research interest is in the ethical and political implications of design and its capacity to mediate social and collective interactions. Her research spans both theoretical inquiry and experimental design, situated at the intersection of Design, the Humanities, and Human Computer Interaction. She received her PhD in Design from Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nKimberley Roussin Isett earned a Ph.D. in Management with a specialization in organization theory from the University of Arizona (School of Public Administration and Policy, Eller College of Management) in 2001. Her work concentrates on institutional pressures and dynamics in implementing government services, with a particular interest in the delivery of services to vulnerable populations. To date, Dr. Isett has been awarded over $1m as a Principal Investigator. Grant and contract funded work has included an evaluation of New York City's HIV/AIDS Services Administration, a large eight state evaluation of the implementation of evidence-based practices in mental health (adult populations), and a four state study and evaluation of new models of service implementation in juvenile justice systems, focusing on the expansion and implementation of evidence based social services. She was recognized by the Academy of Management in both 2001 and 2002 for excellence in research by the Healthcare Management and Public and Nonprofit divisions, was awarded the “Best Article Award” in 2005 by the American Review of Public Administration, and participated in the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation's Mental Health Policy Research Network as a network associate. Isett has worked with elected officials and policymakers at all levels of government on a variety of issues through professional positions and consulting roles. She completed a National Institute of Mental Health sponsored post doctoral fellowship at the Cecil G. Sheps Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, under the mentorship of Joseph P. Morrissey.\n\nThis work is done in collaboration with Dr. Kim Isett (Public Policy), Loren Crawford (MS Public Policy, 2014), and Brighton Vino Jegarajan (MS HCI, 2015) and Binjie Sun (MS ID, 2015) supported in part by a GVU seed grant.\n\nTitle:\n\nSupporting Collaboration and Social Interaction in Motion-based Games for Autism\n\nAbstract:\n\nFor the past eight months, we have been working closely with teachers at the Lionheart School in Alpharetta to design and evaluate motion-based Kinect games that can encourage students with autism to better engage in collaborative game play. Our project is exploring different game interaction and feedback mechanisms to support collaborative actions among players, and documenting the extent to which such actions further facilitate social initiations and responses---such as looks, gestures, and verbal comments---between play partners. In this talk, I will describe preliminary quantitative and qualitative data that shows the impact of the game on student interactions, and I will summarize the lessons we have learned thus far, such as the role of peer play partners in facilitating collaborative game play.\n\nThis work is done in collaboration with co-PI Dr. Brian Magerko, MS CS student Arpita Bhattacharya, and CS undergraduate students Lauren Winston and Zack Littke-Smith, supported by a GVU seed grant.\n\nBio:\n\nDr. Agata Rozga is Research Scientist in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech, with a research focus on autism. Broadly defined, her research bridges computing and developmental psychology, with the goal of developing novel ways to capture and quantify behaviors relevant to studying autism, and to develop and evaluate technologies to support this population. Dr. Rozga founded and directs the Georgia Tech Child Study Lab which, among others, serves as the main data collection site for an NSF-funded Expeditions in Computing grant on Computational Behavioral Science: Modeling, Analysis, and Visualization of Social and Communicative Behavior. Dr. Rozga obtained a PhD in Developmental Psychology from UCLA in 2007, and completed a two-year postdoctoral fellowship through Georgia State University's Center for Behavior Neuroscience, before joining the School of Interactive Computing in 2010.\n\nTitle:\n\nMeeting the Challenge: The Path Towards a Consumer Wearable Computer\n\nAbstract:\n\nMeeting the Challenge: The Path Towards a Consumer Wearable Computer is a traveling exhibition on the history of wearable computing sponsored by GVU / IPAT / WCC / SID. We are cataloging this exhibition along with video content from experts discussing wearable technology and creating a rich electronic book. The E-Book version of the exhibition will be given away for free across multiple platforms and can also be used along with educational/curriculum materials as a STEM outreach tool for K-12. The goal is an e-book catalog of the exhibition which is not only informative, but also beautiful and inspirational.\n\nBio:\n\nClint Zeagler's diverse background in fashion, industrial design and textiles drives his research on electronic textiles and on-body interfaces with the Contextual Computing Group of the GVU center of Georgia Tech. As a Research Scientist for the Georgia Tech Interactive Media Technology Center and Instructor for the Georgia Tech School of Industrial Design he teaches courses on Wearable Product Design and an ID section of Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing (MUC). Recently he co-curated the traveling exhibition Meeting the Challenge: The Path Towards a Consumer Wearable Computer.\n\nTitle:\n\nMove Lab: A STEAM Community of Learners\n\nAbstract:\n\nStudies suggest that underrepresented populations in computing often do not perceive the identity of a computer scientist as aligning with their interests or value system. This often leads to rejection of opportunities to participate within the discipline. To engage diverse populations in computing disciplines, we must understand how we can support students in forming identities with computing that are personally relevant and meaningful. Our investigation centers around a community of African American females as they begin to form self-perceptions with computing and dance in a five day STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) workshop called the MoveLab. Within the workshop the students work with dance, choreography, computer science, and engineering leaders to create a technology enhanced dance performance. To understand how the students form self-perceptions around computing we look closely at the varying self-presentations of students and leaders in a community of learners. Throughout the workshop we observed students self-presentations that would support either forming or rejecting computing identities. We found that the diverse roles of participation, the trusting and engaging social environment, and the leaders modeling behaviors were essential to many of the girls as they began to form self-conceptions with computing. By looking closer at these aspects and the process through which the students begin to associate themselves with conceptions about computing, we believe we can uncover insights into how to better support underrepresented populations in creating computing cultures that are personally meaningful.\n\nBio:\n\nDr. Betsy DiSalvo is an Assistant Professor in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Institute of Technology. At Georgia Tech she leads the Culture and Technology (CAT) Lab, which focuses on research studying cultural values and how they impact technology use, learning, and production. Currently, the CAT Lab is exploring parents' use of technology for informal learning. In its first stages, this research is developing an understanding of how and why parents use or don't choose to use computers, mobile devices, and other technology for learning. DiSalvo is also the PI for an NSF funded project exploring how maker oriented learning approaches may increase transfer and reflection in undergraduate computer science courses and a exploring related projects that tie art and technology to increase learning across disciplines. DiSalvo's work has included the development of games and programs for the Carnegie Science Museum, the Children's Museum of Atlanta, the Children's Museum of Pittsburgh, Eyedrum Art Center and the Walker Art Center. DiSalvo received a Ph.D. in Human Centered Computing from Georgia Tech in 2012. Previous to coming to Georgia Tech she was a research scientist at the University of Pittsburgh Learning Research and Development Center.\n\nSpeaker: Mason Bretan, Deana Brown, Alexander Zook\n\nDate: 2015-04-09 12:00:00\n\nLocation: TSRB 132 (Ball Room)\n\nGVU Center Brown Bag Seminar: GVU Center Brown Bag Seminar Series: Foley Scholar Talk\n\nThe James D. Foley GVU Center Endowment provides graduate fellowships of $5,000. The scholarship is awarded on a merit basis for overall brilliance and potential impact of student research. The scholarship is made possible through the generous contributions of donors committed to supporting the GVU community's student scholars and their work.\n\nThe Foley Scholars were selected from a group of eight accomplished finalists, all showing tremendous potential and impact in shaping technology for a broad range of challenges in modern society.\n\nPresenter :\n\nMason Bretan\n\nTitle:\n\nMotion Planning for an Improvising Musical Robot\n\nAbstract:\n\nProprioception is the sense of one's own body and the physical effort necessary to complete an action. Embodied cognition is a theory stating that the processes and functions comprising the human mind are influenced by a person's physical body. These concepts are discussed in the context of robotic musicianship and a system that jointly optimizes for higher level musical parameters and physical constraints is described. The system demonstrates why bodies matter and how physical embodiment can influence a robot's perceptual and generative musical behaviors.\n\nBio:\n\nMason Bretan is a Ph.D. candidate in Music Technology and is part of Gil Weinberg's Robotic Musicianship group. His research focuses on human-robotic musical interaction, artificial intelligence, and music information retrieval. He designed the functionality for several projects including the marimba playing robot, Shimon, the robotic musical companion, Shimi, and the robotic drumming prosthesis for an amputee drummer. Bretan and his work have been featured in several news sources including the Washington Post, Mashable, and New Scientist.\n\nPresenter:\n\nDeana Brown\n\nTitle:\n\nRivrtran: Mediating Communication in Refugee Support Networks to Overcome Language Barriers\n\nAbstract:\n\nEvery year up to 70,000 refugees arrive in the United States for resettlement (UNHCR). The first three months of a refugee's arrival are the most critical as they will need to interact with well over 2 dozen individuals-doctors, case workers, teachers, mentors. These people are key to helping new refugees accomplish tasks that lead to self-sufficiency such as getting a social security number and driver's license, enrolling their children in school, acquiring medical coverage, opening a bank account, getting a job and so on. Many refugees however, arrive with low levels of literacy, unable to speak English and often speaking a lesser known language or local dialect for which professional interpreters are harder to acquire. To this end we developed Rivrtran, a simple Interactive Voice Response (IVR) application meant to support the exchange of asynchronous voice and text messages between new refugees and members of their support network. Rivrtran uses volunteer interpreters to provide culturally­sensitive translation support for the messages exchanged. In this talk I will discuss the design and development of Rivrtran and the most recent findings from the current deployment with new Burmese refugee families living in Atlanta and their American mentors.\n\nBio:\n\nDeana Brown is a PhD Candidate in Human-Centered Computing at Georgia Tech. Her research spans Human-Computer Interaction, Social Computing and Technologies and Emerging Markets. In 2014, Deana received numerous competitive awards for her work including the Intel PhD Fellowship, the Google Anita Borg Fellowship and the GVU Foley Scholarship. Deana has conducted research in Africa, the Caribbean, Europe and the United States. She most recently interned at Google UK (London) where she worked on improving multiple language search in select emerging markets and prior to that on the Google+ team in Mountain View, California. Deana holds a Masters in Information Technology (HCI) from the Rochester Institute of Technology and a Bachelors degree in Computer Science and Spanish (dual majors) from Lawrence University.\n\nPresenter:\n\nAlexander Zook\n\nTitle:\n\nImproving and Formalizing Game Design through Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning\n\nAbstract:\n\nGames are used for an ever-broadening array of purposes: educating, training, citizen science, and even data collection. Yet our ability to make games for these diverse purposes remains limited: game design and development practices are poorly understood and tools for making games are very limited. I will present research on artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques for supporting and automating game design and development practices. I will discuss this approach in the context of active learning to improve playtesting technologies, automated game generation, constraint solving for formal game mechanic modeling and generation, and general game playing for analyzing how design decisions shape the space of player behavior in a game. These tools enable new development practices while contributing formal, computational models of game design that lead to a future science of game design. Concluding the talk I will discuss the potential for this approach to enable new game designs and design practices through the next generation of intelligent game development technologies.\n\nBio:\n\nAlex Zook is a PhD candidate in Human-Centered Computing in the School of Interactive Computing. He researches technologies to improve game design and development and formally model game design through artificial intelligence and machine learning. Alex has been a recipient of Georgia Tech's Foley Scholarship, outstanding graduate research assistant award, and Presidential Fellowship, as well as the International Game Developers Association Game Developers Conference scholarship. Alex has published at diverse, high-impact venues including AAAI, CHI, the Foundations of Digital Games, and ACM Creativity & Cognition. He founded the Experimental AI in Games workshop and has co-chaired the Intelligent Narrative Technologies workshop and Workshop on the Global Game Jam. His work has been recognized with licensing by the Army Research Labs and an exemplary paper at FDG 2014. Alex received his BA in biology with a specialization in neuroscience from the University of Chicago and has interned as a data scientist at Blizzard Entertainment and Bioware.\n\nSpeaker: Jonah Bokaer\n\nDate: 2015-02-19 12:00:00\n\nLocation: TSRB 132 (Ball Room)\n\nJonah Bokaer, Georgia Tech Artist-In-Residence (2013-2015) will present a framework for student, faculty, and professional conversation around 21st century integration of choreography, digital media, and visual art.\n\nDesigned as an experiential dialogue with the Brown Bag participants, Bokaer will also discuss Why Patterns, and RECESS (on view at the Ferst Center on February 21), a collaboration between choreographer Jonah Bokaer and artist/architect Daniel Arsham is a constantly evolving and fluid dialogue between the two, exploring movement, representation, temporality, memory, and space.\n\nWhile never the same performance from venue to venue, each iteration of RECESS looks at the historical work of art, dance and architecture through the combined solo and collaborated work of Bokaer and Arsham. Through conversation, video, and performance, ideas and statements are built upon utilizing still and moving images of both artists' work, as well as each of them explicitly and implicitly performing for the audience. With measured movements, intentional ellipses, improvisational performativity, the artists seek to engage the audience into a deeper relationship than that of either a strict performance or lecture.\n\nEDUCATIONAL VALUE\n\nDuring the presentation, Bokaer and Arsham discuss the history of dance, concepts of art and architecture, notions of theatrical representation and performance, as well as the frisson that can come from the sometimes seamless, sometimes awkward, integration of the two. Utilizing a large video screen behind the stage, they reference their own work as examples of, or contrary to, artistic concepts that come up during the performance. By opening up the lecture to questions from the audience, RECESS can change at a moment's notice from exploring the human body's limitations within the context of computer image mapping to how the brain processes memory and where technology can recontextualize something as simple as looking at a wall.\n\nBecause of its interactivity with the audience and participants, RECESS has the potential to be limited only by the intervention of the viewers. The more playful, inquisitive, and engaged an audience is, Bokaer and Arsham's open-ended performance can grow into something that will resonate with both the audience and performers.\n\nBio:\n\nJonah Bokaer (Choreography & Performance) has been creating dances for stage, museum, gallery, and outdoor spaces throughout the world since 2002. He is the author of 34 choreographies, ten videos, three motion capture works, three interactive installations, two mobile applications, and one film. His work has been produced throughout theaters in Belgium, Canada, Cuba, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Holland, India, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, the U.K., and the U.S. Often created to accommodate museum spaces, Bokaer's dances have been performed in New York City at The New Museum, MoMA PS1, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, and Museum of Arts and Design. His dances and films have also been seen at the Asia Society Texas Center, MASS MoCA, Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami (Florida); the Musée d'Art Contemporain (Marseille, France); Carré d'Art (Nimes, France);; La Ferme du Buisson (Marne-La-Vallée, France); Palazzo delle Arti (Napoli, Italy); IVAM (Valencia, Spain); Kunst Halle Sankt Gallen (St. Gallen, Switzerland); MUDAM Luxembourg; La Triennale di Milano; and others.

Specifically, the presentation will provide an overview of safety from the eyes of a patient as they use the health care system. We will discuss errors in care and some of the causes of those errors. Through understanding the root cause of errors, systems of care can be designed to improve the care process. The role of the Federal Government in driving quality and safety will be discussed as it relates to financial penalties in the Medicare program. In order to accelerate growth and improvement a new model of care using public and private partnerships and how they may help transform the health environment of the future.

Comprehensive sex education is effective at assisting young people to make healthy decisions about sex and to adopt healthy sexual behaviors. Yet, for so many youth in Georgia medically accurate, age appropriate sex education is not available to them in their school systems. Less than 10 of the 180 school districts in Georgia provide comprehensive sex education.\n\nFor so many years professionals in the field of health education have been trying to get sex education in the school systems, but have run into road blocks related to policy, budgets, political will, and fear of controversy.\n\nWhile adults continue to argue over whether young people should have access to comprehensive sex education in schools, the billion dollar porn industry has made sexual content easily accessible to young people through technology. With the rapid change of technology and young people's access to it, now is the time the field of health education to abandon its 1970's model of sex education and begin to reach young people through the media they use most.\n\nIn this Brown Bag lunch seminar, Kim Nolte, President and CEO of Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power & Potential will discuss their current work in Georgia to institutionalize sex education in schools, their use of technology to reach young people and open a discussion for other ways to use technology to give young people the tools and skills they need to make healthy sexual decisions.\n\nBio:\n\nKim M.
