Please note that manuscripts not conforming to these guidelines may be returned.\n\nOnly manuscripts of sufficient quality that meet the aims and scope of Social Media + Society will be reviewed.\n\nAs part of the submission process you will be required to warrant that you are submitting your original work, that you have the rights in the work, that you are submitting the work for first publication in the Journal and that it is not being considered for publication elsewhere and has not already been published elsewhere, and that you have obtained and can supply all necessary permissions for the reproduction of any copyright works not owned by you.\n\n1. Open Access\n\nSocial Media + Society is an open access, peer-reviewed journal. Each article accepted by peer review is made freely available online immediately upon publication, is published under a Creative Commons license and will be hosted online in perpetuity. Publication costs of the journal are covered by the collection of Article Processing Charges which are paid by the funder, institution or author of each manuscript upon acceptance. There is no charge for submitting a paper to the journal.\n\nFor general information on open access at Sage please visit the Open Access page or view our Open Access FAQs.\n\nBack to top\n\n2. Article processing charge (APC)\n\nSocial Media + Society is an Open Access publication; all articles are freely available online immediately upon publication. All articles are rigorously peer-reviewed, and brought to publication as rapidly as possible. The costs of peer-review and production are covered by Article Processing Charges (APC) paid by the author/institution/funder upon acceptance of the manuscript.\n\nThe article processing charge (APC) for this journal is currently 1000 USD*.\n\nAuthors who do not have funding for open access publishing should request a waiver from the publisher once their Original Research Article is accepted after peer review.\n\nNote from the Editor on APCs\n\nHello world. We have started charging an Article Processing Charge (APC) for articles accepted for publication in Social Media and Society. All content already published will continue to be available open access and at no cost to authors or readers. All content submitted for publication up until November 1, 2018 will be exempt from the APC, should it be accepted for publication. Invited content (special issues, editorials, etc) will also be exempt. Waivers to the APC will be granted by the publishing team, with criteria that prioritize work by graduate students, junior faculty, and institutions and/or regions with limited resources. Funds generated by the APC are employed to provide editorial support for the journal. The journal has grown and requires greater maintenance. The estimated proceeds from the APCs are modest, and add up to what it roughly costs to compensate a part time Editorial Assistant for me. All other support for the journal, ranging from my ability to serve as its Editor to technical maintenance, web support and all that it takes to make content available open access indefinitely come from my home institution, the University of Illinois at Chicago, and Sage. I thank them both for their generosity. I also thank our Editorial Board, the members of which provided valuable guidance as we collectively discussed and arrived to this decision. We remain committed to the principles of accessibly and openly available scholarly work.\n\n*The article processing charge (APC) is payable upon acceptance after peer review and is subject to value added tax (VAT) where applicable. If the paying author/institution is based in the European Union, to comply with European law, VAT must be added to the APC. Providing a VAT registration number will allow an institution to avoid paying this tax, except for UK institutions. Payments can be made in GBP or USD.\n\nFor general information on open access at Sage please visit the Open Access page or view our Open Access FAQs.\n\nBack to top\n\n3. Article types\n\nThe journal publishes the following article types:\n\nOriginal research articles. Double-blind, double peer-reviewed articles. Social Media + Society welcomes publication of articles with graphics, visuals, audio and video supplements and interactive elements. The preferred word count for original research articles is 8,000 words.\n\nColloquia. External guest editors will be invited to convene debates and discussions to be published as a section or special issue.\n\nCommentaries. Shorter essays, think pieces and general commentary on topical issues, controversies and emerging questions for the field will be published by invitation.\n\nBookcasts. Rather than a book reviews section, authors and one interviewer will be invited to do a brief overview and review of relevant books in video format.\n\nBack to top\n\n4. Editorial policies\n\n4.1 Peer review policy\n\nSocial Media + Society utilizes a double-blind peer review process for original research articles in which the reviewer and author’s names and information are withheld from the other. All manuscripts are reviewed as rapidly as possible, while maintaining rigor. The journal’s policy is to have manuscripts reviewed by two expert reviewers. Reviewers make comments to the author and recommendations to Editor, who makes the final decision.\n\n4.2 Authorship\n\nArticles should only be submitted for consideration once the authorization of all contributing authors has been gathered. Those submitting articles should carefully check that all those whose work contributed to the article are acknowledged as contributing authors.\n\nThe list of authors should include all those who can legitimately claim authorship. This is all those who:\n\nhave made a substantial contribution to the concept and design, acquisition of data or analysis and interpretation of data\n\ndrafted the article or revised it critically for important intellectual content\n\napproved the version to be published.\n\nAuthors should meet the conditions of all of the points above. Each author should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for appropriate portions of the content.\n\nWhen a large, multicentre group has conducted the work, the group should identify the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript. These individuals should fully meet the criteria for authorship.\n\nAcquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research group alone does not constitute authorship, although all contributors who do not meet the criteria for authorship should be listed in the Acknowledgments section.\n\nAll authors are required to submit an Author Bio in the following format:\n\nFirst Name Last Name (Ph.D./M.A. University of X) is a professor/researcher/student of X at the University/Institution of X. His her research interests include x, y, z.\n\nPlease note that AI chatbots, for example ChatGPT, should not be listed as authors. For more information see the policy on Use of ChatGPT and generative AI tools.\n\n4.3 Acknowledgements\n\nAll contributors who do not meet the criteria for authorship should be listed in an Acknowledgements section. Examples of those who might be acknowledged include a person who provided purely technical help, or a department chair who provided only general support.\n\nPlease supply any personal acknowledgements separately to the main text to facilitate anonymous peer review.\n\n4.3.1 Third party submissions\n\nWhere an individual who is not listed as an author submits a manuscript on behalf of the author(s), a statement must be included in the Acknowledgements section of the manuscript and in the accompanying cover letter. The statements must:\n\nDisclose this type of editorial assistance – including the individual’s name, company and level of input\n\nIdentify any entities that paid for this assistance\n\nConfirm that the listed authors have authorized the submission of their manuscript via third party and approved any statements or declarations, e.g. conflicting interests, funding, etc.\n\nWhere appropriate, Sage reserves the right to deny consideration to manuscripts submitted by a third party rather than by the authors themselves.\n\n4.3.2 Writing assistance\n\nIndividuals who provided writing assistance, e.g. from a specialist communications company, do not qualify as authors and so should be included in the Acknowledgements section. Authors must disclose any writing assistance – including the individual’s name, company and level of input – and identify the entity that paid for this assistance. It is not necessary to disclose use of language polishing services.\n\n4.4 Funding\n\nSocial Media + Society requires all authors to acknowledge their funding in a consistent fashion under a separate heading. Please visit the Funding Acknowledgements page on the Sage Journal Author Gateway to confirm the format of the acknowledgment text in the event of funding, or state that: This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\n\n4.5 Declaration of conflicting interests\n\nIt is the policy of Social Media + Society to require a declaration of conflicting interests from all authors enabling a statement to be carried within the paginated pages of all published articles.\n\nPlease ensure that a ‘Declaration of Conflicting Interests’ statement is included at the end of your manuscript, after any acknowledgements and prior to the references. If no conflict exists, please state that ‘The Author(s) declare(s) that there is no conflict of interest’.\n\nFor guidance on conflict of interest statements, please see the ICMJE recommendations.\n\nBack to top\n\n5. Publishing policies\n\n5.1 Publication ethics\n\nSage is committed to upholding the integrity of the academic record.

Where an article, for example, is found to have plagiarized other work or included third-party copyright material without permission or with insufficient acknowledgement, or where the authorship of the article is contested, we reserve the right to take action including, but not limited to: publishing an erratum or corrigendum (correction); retracting the article; taking up the matter with the head of department or dean of the author's institution and/or relevant academic bodies or societies; or taking appropriate legal action.\n\n5.1.2 Prior publication\n\nIf material has been previously published, it is not generally acceptable for publication in a Sage journal. However, there are certain circumstances where previously published material can be considered for publication. Please refer to the guidance on the Sage Author Gateway or if in doubt, contact the Editor at the address given below.\n\n5.2 Contributor's publishing agreement\n\nBefore publication Sage requires the author as the rights holder to sign a Journal Contributor’s Publishing Agreement.

ORCID provides a unique and persistent digital identifier that distinguishes researchers from every other researcher, even those who share the same name, and, through integration in key research workflows such as manuscript and grant submission, supports automated linkages between researchers and their professional activities, ensuring that their work is recognized.\n\nThe collection of ORCID iDs from corresponding authors is now part of the submission process of this journal. If you already have an ORCID iD you will be asked to associate that to your submission during the online submission process. We also strongly encourage all co-authors to link their ORCID ID to their accounts in our online peer review platforms. It takes seconds to do: click the link when prompted, sign into your ORCID account and our systems are automatically updated. Your ORCID iD will become part of your accepted publication’s metadata, making your work attributable to you and only you. Your ORCID iD is published with your article so that fellow researchers reading your work can link to your ORCID profile and from there link to your other publications.\n\nIf you do not already have an ORCID iD please follow this link to create one or visit our ORCID homepage to learn more.\n\n7.2 Informtion required for completing your submission\n\nYou will be asked to provide contact details and academic affiliations for all co-authors via the submission system and identify who is to be the corresponding author.
