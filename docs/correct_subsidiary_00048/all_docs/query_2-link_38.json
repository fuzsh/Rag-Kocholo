        "text": "HYDERABAD: The state’s first intelligence chief B. Shivadhar Reddy, a 1994 batch IPS officer, who was once the blue-eyed boy of former chief minister K. Chandrashekar Rao, is likely to be the new Intel chief.\n\nDespite being a close confidant of Rao and among a handful of cops who had direct access to him, Shivadhar Reddy was unceremoniously removed from the post in September 2016.\n\nKnown to be a tough taskmaster and an ardent Telangana supporter, Reddy is known for executing operations meticulously.\n\nAmong the many such operations during his stint as the intel chief, he is credited with busting one of the most important ISIS modules in the country, which was taking shape in Hyderabad. This led to the arrest of three city-based youngsters.\n\nFurther, the encounter in Alair in which Viqaruddin and a few other terror suspects were killed, was executed under Reddy’s supervision.\n\nHe is also known for trapping the dreaded Maoist-turned-gangster Nayeemuddin, who was killed in an encounter at Shadnagar in August 2016.\n\nOne of the most important cases he handled was the cash for vote scam that shook both Telugu states. This operation foiled the attempts of former chief minister of Andhra Pradesh N. Chandrababu Naidu to lure a BRS MLA to vote in their favour in the MLC elections. New Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy was caught red-handed with Rs 50 lakh cash.\n\nSince his removal from the post, Shivadhar Reddy has been serving in an insignificant post. Currently serving as the additional DG, railways & road safety, he is most likely to be elevated to the intel post.\n\nEarlier he served as the Visakhapatnam police commissioner and as ACB director in the undivided Andhra Pradesh."
