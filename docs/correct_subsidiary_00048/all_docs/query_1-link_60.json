Tower Semi will need to indicate an investment partner according to experts, per the Scheme norms. Should the proposal gain governmental approval, it would mark the first instance of a top-10 global semiconductor company bringing genuine fabrication expertise to participate in India’s US$10 billion chip manufacturing initiative. The government is currently evaluating Tower’s proposal and aims to approve it before the implementation of the model code of conduct preceding this year’s general elections. A previous application under the scheme fell through as Intel Corp had been in the process of acquiring the Israeli firm, which ultimately did not materialize as it did not secure regulatory approval from China.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the matter, the government has received nine bids for the overhaul of its Semiconductor Laboratory (SCL) in Mohali, with companies such as the Tata Group, Tower Semiconductor, and Texas Instruments among the bidders.\n\nUS$1 billion has been earmarked by the government for the modernization of the 48-year old state-owned facility, which is India’s only chip manufacturing unit producing semiconductors for strategic and defense purposes, including applications for space exploration such as the Chandrayaan mission.\n\nOnce the government decides on the specific nodes for manufacturing, financial bids will be solicited from the interested companies. The selected firm may need to collaborate with a technology firm possessing licensing grade semiconductor technology.\n\nThe Tata Group is planning to set up a fab unit in Dholera; Tower intends to get into 65 and 40 nanometer fab production in India and had previously helped SCL set up its 180 nm chip plant; and Texas Instruments has significant chip R&D operations in India.\n\nHCL, the Indian IT sector conglomerate, is pursuing a joint venture (JV) with Taiwanese electronics manufacturing services giant Foxconn to set up a semiconductor Outsourced Assembly and Testing (OSAT) unit in India; Foxconn will have 40 percent equity for US$37.2 million. Specific information about the nature of the OSAT facility is as yet undisclosed. While HCL started out as a hardware company, its current focus lies predominantly in providing design services within the semiconductor domain. The strategic shift under the JV with Foxconn is expected to move the company higher up the value chain, per industry experts.\n\nOn January 18, India’s cabinet approved an initial pact signed between India and the European Union to boost cooperation in the semiconductor space. The MoU between India and the European Commission on Working Arrangements on semiconductor ecosystems, its supply chain, and innovation had been signed November 21, last year, under the framework of EU-India Trade and Technology Council (TTC).\n\nMicron Technology President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra has stated that Phase 1 of the company’s plant at Sanand, Gujarat, will become operational by early 2025. It will include 500,000 square feet of plant clean room space. He made the comments during the 2024 Vibrant Gujarat Summit. The “clean room” is typically expected to host the ATMP operation as it requires a near-zero dust and vibration environment. Micron Technology has already hired 200 people for the Sanand Plant, who are currently receiving training at facilities in Mohali and Malaysia. Upon completion of both phases, Micron expects to create 5,000 jobs in the state. Phase 2 is slated for the second half of the ongoing decade.\n\nAlso at the Vibrant Gujarat Summit, Jeffery Chun, the Global CEO of South Korea’s Simmtech, known for producing high-layer printed circuit boards (PCBs) for semiconductors, announced plans to make another colocation investment with Micron. Chun expressed readiness to invest in Gujarat, citing support from both Central and state governments, with the potential to generate thousands of jobs. More details are awaited.\n\nAt the 2024 Vibrant Gujarat Summit, which is being held between January 10-12 in the state capital of Gandhinagar, Tata Group Chairman N Chandrasekaran announced plans for the conglomerate to set up a large semiconductor fabrication plant in Dholera, Gujarat. Chandrasekaran said that the project is reportedly in its final stages of negotiations and operations would commence within the year.\n\nA report in the Economic Times says Israel’s chipmaker Tower Semiconductors has resubmitted a proposal to set up a semiconductor fabrication unit for 65 nm and 40 nm chips in India. However, the company is also facing legal action from its previous JV partner, Abu Dhabi-based Next Orbit Ventures, for submitting a fresh proposal with a new partner. There is speculation in the industry that Tower Semiconductors’ new partner in the latest proposal could be the BC Jindal group, a major manufacturer of packaging and labelling products.\n\nThe Taiwanese electronics manufacturing services giant, Foxconn, recently submitted an application to establish a semiconductor fabrication unit in India recently submitted an application to establish a semiconductor fabrication unit in India under the “modified scheme for setting up of semiconductor fabs in India”, said Rajeev Chandrasekhar, the Minister of State for Electronics and IT. Foxconn previously exited from a joint venture with the Vedanta Group, which had plans to set up a chip plant in Gujarat with an investment of around INR 1.5 trillion.\n\nIndia and the European Union signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on November 24 concerning semiconductors, aiming to foster a resilient supply chain and promote innovation. The agreement was formalized during a stock-taking call among the leaders of the EU-India Trade and Technology Council (TTC). Key points in the MoU include sharing experiences and information on semiconductors ecosystems, identifying areas for joint research and innovation, promoting skills development and workforce collaboration, and ensuring a fair competitive environment by exchanging information on publicly granted subsidies.\n\nHCL is holding active discussions with the Karnataka state government to set up an OSAT facility (chip packagng unit), per an Economic Times report. The company is planning to make an investment of about US$400 million to set up a “small-to-medium sized” facility. The government has offered land parcels near the Bengaluru international airport and Mysuru. State officials have indicated the comparative favorability of Mysuru due to its access to water resources. At this stage it appears the government will be open to more sops if the firm seeks tweaks to the incentives package. The HCL Group’s IT services arm, HCLTech, acquired Sankalp Semiconductor in 2019. Sankalp Semiconductor is based in Palo Alto, California and Hubli, India with offices in USA, India, Canada, Germany, Malaysia, Japan. It is a preferred semiconductor design service partner of top chip manufacturers, design foundries, and OEMs across the globe like TSMC.\n\nAs of the end of October 2023, the government has received a total of 45 applications under its INR 760 billion semiconductor and display manufacturing scheme.

Spanning across 93 acres in the Sanand GIDC-II industrial estate, the Assembly, Test, Marking, and Packaging (ATMP) facility aims to generate 5,000 direct job opportunities and is expected to be operational within 18 months. The facility’s primary focus will be the conversion of wafers into Ball Grid Array (BGA)-integrated circuit packages, memory modules, and solid-state drives. (US$1=INR 82.06).\n\nIn a statement, Vedanta Foxconn Semiconductors Limited (VFSL) announced that it has submitted a revised application to the central government, seeking incentives in accordance with the updated guidelines of the India Semiconductor Mission. Previously, VFSL had applied for incentives for manufacturing 28 nm chips. However, it has now modified its application to focus on producing 40 nm chips and receiving incentives in that specific category, according to a source. In May of this year, the IT ministry revised the guidelines for incentive applications, allowing applicants to apply once they possess production-grade technology or have formed partnerships with companies possessing such technology. VFSL is a joint venture between India’s Vedanta Group and Taiwan’s Foxconn group with a ratio of 67-33.\n\nFoxconn is reportedly approaching prominent Indian business houses to forge partnerships and advance its semiconductor manufacturing goals in India, according to sources cited by The Economic Times (June 27, 2023). Sources indicate that the year-old joint venture between Foxconn and the Vedanta Group may be encountering difficulties due to disagreements between the two partners. A senior Indian government official informed ET that the government has advised Foxconn to consider collaborating with a different partner. The concerns primarily revolve around the financial stability of the Vedanta Group.\n\nPer reporting in The Economic Times: Micron Technology will contribute US$825 million out of the total US$2.75 billion investment, while the remaining funds will come from the central government (50 percent) and the Gujarat state government (20 percent). The OSAT plant is planned to be established in Sanand, Gujarat, and is projected to commence operations in 2024. Although Micron is one of the leading makers of memory chips, such as DRAM, flash memory, and USB drives, it does not engage in actual chip manufacturing. According to Research and Markets, memory products contribute significantly to the semiconductor industry’s revenue, accounting for 35 percent of total chip sales. Micron intends to utilize the facility in India to cater to local demand and export to South Asian markets.\n\nIndia’s smartphone market is currently valued at US$30 billion and assembles 150 million phones daily. Apple has expressed its intentions to expand its sourcing efforts in India, while Google Pixel is reportedly considering shifting a portion of its device production to the country. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) anticipates that the electronics manufacturing sector in India will reach a value of US$300 billion by 2026. It is important to note that India heavily relies on chip imports for these electronic devices, and the projected import bill for chips alone is expected to reach approximately US$64 billion by 2026.\n\nOn June 22, Micron Technology, an American semiconductor manufacturer, revealed its plans to allocate a maximum of US$825 million for establishing a fresh chip assembly and testing facility in India. Micron stated that with backing from the Centre and the Gujarat government, the total investment in the factory will amount to US$2.75 billion. According to a media release on the company website: “Micron’s new facility will enable assembly and test manufacturing for both DRAM and NAND products and address demand from domestic and international markets. Phased construction of the new assembly and test facility in Gujarat is expected to begin in 2023. Phase 1, which will include 500,000 square feet of planned cleanroom space, will start to become operational in late 2024, and Micron will ramp capacity gradually over time in line with global demand trends. Micron expects Phase 2 of the project, which would include construction of a facility similar in scale to Phase 1, to start towards the second half of the decade.”\n\nPM Modi also met with Gary E. Dickerson, CEO, Applied Materials and invited the firm for the development of process technology and advanced packaging capabilities in India. Modi and Dickerson discussed potential of Applied Materials’ collaboration with academic institutions in India to create skilled workforce.\n\n“[Prime Minister Modi has] invited Micron Technology to boost semiconductor manufacturing in India,” according to an official statement issued by the external affairs ministry. Modi met with Mr. Sanjay Mehrotra, CEO of Micron on June 21, 2023 in Washington DC during his official visit to the country.\n\nReuters has reported June 20 that the Indian cabinet has given its approval to Micron’s US$2.7 billion investment plan to set up a semiconductor ATMP unit in Gujarat, the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The government’s approval came in just ahead of Modi’s first official state visit to the US.\n\nAccording to sources speaking to The Economic Times, Micron’s investment is intended for the establishment of an outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) unit, which will consist of a minimum of four assembly lines. This development will represent a significant milestone as it marks the central government’s first approval of an OSAT unit, also known as an assembly testing marking and packaging (ATMP) unit.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg’s sources, Micron Technology is currently engaged in talks to set up a semiconductor packaging facility in India, with an estimated value of at least US$1 billion. This strategic move aims to expand the company’s international presence amid increasing trade tensions between the United States and China.\n\nIt is speculated that Micron Technology might even invest up to US$2 billion in this project, and there are suggestions within the industry that an official announcement could be made during Prime Minister Modi’s official visit to the United States – June 20-24.\n\nThe progress of a proposed $3 billion semiconductor facility in India, led by chip consortium ISMC and involving Israeli chipmaker Tower as a technology partner, has been halted due to the ongoing acquisition of Tower by Intel.\n\nFurther, in the Vedanta-Foxconn JV, it appears that technology partner STMicroelectronics is reluctant to meet the Indian government’s requirements for it to have a stake in the JV partnership. According to reporting in the Economic Times, STMicro want India to become a more mature market before having more ‘skin in the game’ as it were.\n\nThe Modified Semicon India Programme will receive applications from June 1, 2023. The window for applicants is kept open till December 2024.\n\nIndia is now reportedly encouraging investment proposals for mature nodes of over 40nm – previous and fresh applicants to the India Semiconductor Mission scheme can apply again for incentives from June 1, 2023.\n\nReports in the media indicate that Vedanta-Foxconn will likely not get incentives [worth potentially billions of dollars] to make 28-nanometer chips as they have not met the criteria set by the Indian government.\n\nMike Young, a seasoned industry professional with 34 years of experience, has been selected by Vedanta to serve as the Senior Vice President in charge of the Project Management Office and Manufacturing Operations. Young brings a wealth of expertise, having previously held prominent positions such as CEO of Systems on Silicon Manufacturing Company (SSMC) in Singapore and CEO of X-FAB Sarawak in Malaysia. In his new capacity, Young will assume responsibility for supervising the implementation of manufacturing and operational procedures as Vedanta prepares to establish its inaugural semiconductor fab in India.\n\nBloomberg News reported on Wednesday, May 10, that India intends to reopen the application process for $10 billion worth of incentives and assistance aimed at promoting chip manufacturing. The decision to revisit the application process stems from the observation that previously announced projects have been experiencing significant delays. More details are awaited.\n\nA Counterpoint Research and the India Electronics & Semiconductor Association (IESA) report projects India’s semiconductor market to value about $64 billion by 2026, showing three-times growth from US$22.7 billion in 2019. Two-thirds of this market value will be created by the country’s telecom stack and industrial applications. Reporting in Outlook puts India’s semiconductor market on course to be worth US$80.3 billion by 2028.\n\nThe government is expected to greenlight the Vedanta-Foxconn (VSFL) bid, however, certain guarantees and information needs to be provided. VSFL have signed pacts with two companies for technology transfer, GlobalFoundries from the US and European chipmaker STMicroelectronics. The Indian government is reportedly seeking details of the technology transfer – with either of the two companies. India would also prefer if GlobalFoundries and STMicro were to buy stakes in the VSFL joint venture.\n\nThe central government will invest US$1.2 billion to modernize the 30-year old facility at the Semiconductor Laboratory (SCL) in Mohali (Punjab state) to achieve volume production and create profitable assets. The facility currently has the capability to produce 8-inch CMOS microchip wafers used mostly in the country’s strategic areas like the space program (Mangalyaan and the Mars Orbiter Mission). The government’s investment is part of the India Semiconductor Mission’s goal to modernize and commercialize the facility, although a timeline has not been provided by the government.\n\nThe government has earmarked INR 11-12 billion (approx. US$133.83 million-US$146 million) to support the country’s semiconductor design startups. The Semiconductor Design-Linked incentive scheme has so far onboarded 27 start-ups, per the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).\n\nThe Indian government is close to approving a US$1 billion investment proposal by Micron Technology to set up an ATMP facility in the country. Based in Idaho, USA, Micron Technology is the world’s fifth largest semiconductor company. The firm has 11 manufacturing sites across US, Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, and China.\n\nThe Vedanta-Foxconn JV have secured a technology partner who will provide them with access to high-volume manufacturing-grade technology. This is a prerequisite for project approval and semiconductor incentives. Details have not been made available but the government is currently looking at the documentation. Speaking to the media, semiconductor veteran David Reed and new CEO of Vedanta-Foxconn Semiconductors Limited said: “We do have now access to a manufacturable grade, high volume technology. We have access to all the documentation and design IP, and it can support industrial and especially automotive. We can’t go into details – who it is. But we’ve already started the transfer process.”\n\nIndia will announce the first semiconductor fab in a few weeks’ time – Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw told media on March 14. A Deloitte report estimates the Indian semiconductor market to reach US$55 billion by 2026, with over 60 percent of the market driven by the smartphones and wearables, automotive components, and computing and data storage industries. Vaishnaw has said that India’s smartphone exports will touch US$9.5 -10 billion in 2023.\n\nIn January this year, the US Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) and the India Electronics and Semiconductor Association (IESA) decided to form a private sector task force to strengthen bilateral collaboration in the global semiconductor ecosystem. This was the background to US Secretary of Commerce, Gina Raimondo, and India’s Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on establishing semiconductor supply chain and innovation partnership under the framework of the India – US Commercial Dialogue. Raimondo was in New Delhi between March 7 to 10 for the Dialogue.\n\nThe US presently has a ‘Chip 4’ alliance with the world’s top semiconductor makers – Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea. Meanwhile, in September 2021, India, Japan, and Australia announced plans to establish a semiconductor supply chain initiative “to secure access to semiconductors and their components”.\n\nThe Vedanta-Foxconn JV has finalized the Dholera Special Investment Region [near Ahmedabad city, Gujarat] as the location for their semiconductor and display manufacturing facility, a senior state government official confirmed to media on February 20, 2023.\n\nThe Economic Times is reporting [February 10, 2023] that India is expected to open a second round of applications for semiconductor chip manufacturing under the US$10 billion incentive package by mid-March. The Indian government is also said to be in “advanced talks” with four global chipmakers to set up fab here, including “New York-headquartered Global Foundries and a South Korean semiconductor firm”. A source close to the government said to ET that a lot of the large semiconductor firms like TSMC, Samsung, and Intel had already committed investments in other countries, meaning the Indian government had to be more patient and think long-term. It’s also why the government intends to speak with more firms. Further, given the nascent status of the local supply chain, the government would also need to be on listener mode, according to the source.\n\nMoreover, it appears that proposals by ISMC, IGSS Venture, and Rajesh Exports may not get final approvals for government incentives. For instance, ISMC is a JV between Israel’s TowerSemiconductor and Abu Dhabi-based Next Orbit Ventures. Their proposal – where TowerSemiconductor offered the requisite technology – was positively viewed; however, the Israeli firm is under acquisition by US-tech giant Intel, which hasn’t been completed. The government appears to have rejected the IGSS Venture and Rajesh Exports plans as not meeting the standards of the India Semiconductor Mission and lacking good technology partners. Interestingly, when the newspaper reached out to Singapore-based IGSS, they said they had not received official notification on the status of selection.\n\nCurrently, the central government is offering 50 percent subsidy on fab units and state governments offer 10-25 percent subsidy over and above the central grant – however, while the incentives are lucrative, applicants must meet technology standards.\n\nThe Economic Times is reporting that Foxconn and Vedanta are seeking to bring in European chipmaker STMicroelectronics as their technology partner in their proposed India manufacturing unit. The two companies announced their joint venture February 2021, with Foxconn as lead partner. Vedanta are reportedly seeking to onboard a CXO to head their semiconductor business.\n\nIn early November, it was reported by Economic Times that Reliance Industries and leading software firm, HCL, are “independently ‘evaluating’ deals to purchase a 30% equity stake each in the semiconductor wafer fab applicant ISMC Analog.”\n\nAt a Gujarat rally on November 23, PM Modi made a first formal announcement of the location of Vedanta and Foxconn’s proposed semiconductor manufacturing facility in Gujarat at Dholera, in the Bhavnagar neighborhood.\n\nISMC’s proposed US$3 billion semiconductor fab may begin construction in Karnataka by February 2023, as per media reports. It will be 4-5 years till ISMC’s plant becomes operational.\n\nThree sub-committees to vet proposals under the Indian Semiconductor Mission (ISM) have been set up by the government. The proposals will be evaluated on their financial viability, technical expertise, and the financial capabilities of their partners, among various considerations.\n\nIncluded in the first committee are members from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) and the Industrial Finance Corporation of India (IFCI). The second committee includes members from the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF). The third sub-committee has members from the 21-member ISM expert group and includes three domain experts. The ISM expert group is chaired by the Information Technology Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw.\n\nAs of reporting in the media on November 1, 2022, authorities are expected to approve the “first applications soon”. The following applications are awaiting official approval to set up semiconductor fab units – Vedanta-Foxconn, Next Orbit Ventures-Tower Semiconductor (now owned by Intel), and Rajesh Exports. The consortiums have applied for incentives under the US$10 billion ISM package.\n\nThe US deputy assistant secretary, South and Central Asia, Afreen Akhter, is leading a trade mission of semiconductors industry to India and has had meetings with India’s top government officials. The US intends to support India overcome challenges in the semiconductor supply chain and boost its local semiconductor manufacturing capacity. The US publicly seeking to strengthen its partnerships with “like-minded countries” like India and Taiwan. In a related context, in October, the US Department of Commerce implemented new export controls on advanced computing and semiconductors sold to China.\n\nThe government and the India Semiconductor Mission is likely to start approving proposals to set up electronic chip and display manufacturing plants in the country in the next 30-60 days / over the next couple of months, as per Minister of State for Electronics and IT Rajeev Chandrasekhar’s comments during a virtual address at the IESA Vision Summit held on October 12, 2022.\n\nThe Ministry of Electronics and IT has plans to spend US$1.25-US$1.30 billion to modernize and upgrade its semiconductor laboratory (SCL) in Mohali. This spending is also targeted at strengthening intellectual property rights in India’s semiconductor sector. The SCL has now invited bids for the lab upgrade; qualified bidders must have a commercial partner on board to produce fabrication of chips designed by the lab. The last date for submitting bids to the SCL’s request for proposal (RFP) is October 25, 2022. The SCL aims to be able to produce 28-nm chips after upgradation.\n\nThe government has approved modifications to the “Program for Development of Semiconductors and Display Manufacturing Ecosystem in India”, including fiscal support for project cost and capital expenditure. Following discussion with potential investors, it is expected that work on setting up the first semiconductor facility will commence soon. More details below.\n\nVedanta-Foxconn are set to finalize a location for their facility in the next few weeks. The consortium are reportedly seeking a 800-1000 acre land parcel that is also well connected with Ahmedabad. The Gujarat government, as of media reports on September 16, showing sites at Sanand and Mandal-Becharaji in Ahmedabad district, two locations near Vadodara in central Gujarat, Dholera, Himmatnagar, Jamnagar, and Kutch. The plant has to be located at a distance from national and state highways so to cut off any vibration from heavy traffic movement. Further, no other major industry should be located in its vicinity.\n\nVarious investor-technology consortiums like IGSS are asking the Indian government to make a final decision by October on approving incentives for applicants to the semiconductor manufacturing incentives program.\n\nVedanta and Foxconn, in a 60-40 joint venture, will be setting up India’s first semiconductor production plant, a display fab unit, and a semiconductor assembling and testing unit over 1000 acres in Ahmedabad, state of Gujarat. The plant will begin production in two years as Foxconn plays the role of technical partner while Vedanta provides financial backing. The investment is worth over INR 1.54 trillion (approx. US$20 billion) and semiconductor manufacturing will be carried out by the holding company, Volcan Investments Limited.\n\nInternational consortium ISMC (US$3 billion investment) and Singapore-based IGSS (investment worth INR 256 billion) will be setting up semiconductor plants in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, respectively.\n\nThe Indian government confirmed it has received proposals from five companies to establish electronic chip and display manufacturing plants with an investment of INR 1.53 trillion (approx. US$20.5 billion). Given the time-intensive decision-making process and international travel disruptions due to COVID-19, there is currently no firm deadline in place for companies submitting their applications to India’s semiconductor chip design and manufacturing scheme: Rajeev Chandrasekhar, minister of state for electronics and IT, speaking to The Economic Times. Initially, the first window for applications was until February 15.\n\nThe Ministry of Electronics and Information (MeitY) is seeking applications from 100 domestic companies, start-ups and MSMEs under its Design Linked Incentive (DLI) Scheme. The scheme has three components – Chip Design infrastructure support, Product Design Linked Incentive and Deployment Linked Incentive. C-DAC (Centre for Development of Advanced Computing), a scientific society operating under MeitY, will serve as the nodal agency for implementation of the DLI scheme. The DLI scheme aims to nurture at least 20 domestic companies involved in semiconductor design and facilitate them to achieve turnover of more than INR 15 billion in the next five years.
