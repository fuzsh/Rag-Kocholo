        "text": "Intel's John Miner says that ISPs Best Positioned to Lead Small, Medium-Sized Companies Into the Internet Economy\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif., Oct. 26, 1999 -- John Miner, vice president and general manager, Intel's Communications Products Group, stated in the opening keynote today at the ISPCON Expo Fall'99, that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) worldwide have a \"gigantic\" opportunity to lead the millions of small and medium-sized businesses moving into the Internet economy. Reiterating that all businesses will be e-businesses in the near future, Miner demonstrated several products Intel will be unveiling in the coming months that -- coupled with the company's communications offerings, new processors and online hosting services -- provide a full range of solutions for ISPs and their business customers.\n\n\"Our recently created ISP sales program is growing as we add more products, services and technologies that target ISPs and their business customers,\" said Miner. \"By adding to Intel's existing Internet building block portfolio, our strategy is to provide a full range of solutions to market 'to and through' ISPs, who are best positioned to enable the tens of millions of businesses planning to join the Internet economy.\"\n\nMiner's keynote included demonstrations of some soon-to-be-released products, including a new Web-caching infrastructure appliance and a multi-function network appliance targeted at small businesses. He also disclosed the immediate availability of an upgrade to the Intel®Express 550 Stackable Switch that aides transparent Web-caching.\n\nIn addition, Miner highlighted technology and products from three recent Intel acquisitions, Dialogic (computer telephony technology), IPivot (traffic management and commerce acceleration products), and Shiva (virtual private networks).\n\nWeb-Caching Technology\n\nMiner demonstrated Intel's Web-caching appliance, co-developed with Inktomi Corp., which will be available early next year. It is the first product to incorporate the newly announced Inktomi Traffic Server* Engine software into a turnkey appliance, combining the performance and efficiency of industry standard hardware with the flexibility of Inktomi's open platform running on standard operating systems.\n\n\"The combination of Intel Architecture and Inktomi Traffic Server Engine software delivers robust caching solutions for the entry and mid-level segments of the service provider market,\" said Paul Gauthier, chief technology officer and founder of Inktomi. \"The open standard appliance approach allows for the integration of intelligent network services, such as streaming media and content transformation, and the ability to take advantage of a worldwide network of installed Traffic Server systems.\"\n\nNew Appliance for Small Business\n\nIntel also demonstrated a new small business appliance expected to ship later this year. The product is a unique multi-function appliance that can be sold by ISPs and VARs to their small business customers. According to industry analyst Infonetics, six out of 10 ISPs plan to engage in the customer premise equipment resale business in 1999, and the majority of all multiple-PC small offices will have a local area network by the year 2002.\n\nThis \"network-in-a-box\" solution was developed specifically for the small business market, and provides an affordable on-ramp to the Internet economy. Intel plans to market this appliance with various operating systems, and include features like file, printer and Internet access sharing, file storage, and backup capabilities. This product is designed to help businesses increase productivity and profitability through collaboration and the sharing of resources.\n\nTransparent Caching with Intel Switch Products Intel has combined efforts with Skycache to provide ISP customers a software upgrade that adds transparent Web-caching capabilities to the Intel Express 550 Stackable Switch. The switch's caching function is transparent for the end-user, and will re-direct Layer4 traffic to cache servers, such as Intel's new Web-caching appliances. It provides faster response time and a reduction in bandwidth cost for ISPs. This free upgrade is available today on Intel's site at www.intel.com/network.\n\nA Large ISP Offering\n\nThese products add breadth to Intel's existing ISP portfolio. Intel's present ISP offerings include networking infrastructure products, such as hubs, switches and network appliances; Internet connectivity solutions, such as routers and remote access concentrators; and VPN gateways. Server products from Intel include server building blocks based on Pentium® III and Pentium III Xeon processors, with special form factors to address ISPs' growing server needs.\n\nLast summer, Intel began the Intel ISP Program, a \"sell to/sell through\" program that targets ISPs and ASPs (application service providers) with Intel server building blocks and networking products and complements other Intel sales channels. The program also helps ISPs who want to become value-added resellers. To assist in this transition, the program offers ISPs a variety of communication, sales and marketing tools, training, a dedicated ISP Web site, financial services such as equipment leasing, and product demo discount programs. More than 500 ISPs worldwide have joined the program since it was rolled out in July.\n\n* Other names and brands may be claimed as the property of others."
