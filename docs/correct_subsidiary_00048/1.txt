Intel Corporation has introduced the Intel Shiva LanRover VPN Express, a 50 simultaneous-tunnel, slim-profile, virtual private networking solution. The Intel Shiva LanRover VPN Express has been designed to provide small- and medium-size companies with a low-cost, full-featured VPN solution providing remote access, LAN-to-LAN, and extranet connectivity. For large companies looking for remote branch office connectivity, the Intel Shiva LanRover VPN Express offers an integrated client software license.

The Intel Shiva LanRover VPN Express provides businesses with many of the same benefits as the Intel Shiva LanRover VPN Gateway. These benefits include: access via private, encrypted tunnels over the Internet; elimination of long-distance toll charges and reduction of expensive leased-line charges; and guaranteed secure and reliable connections for remote workers, business partners and branch offices.

The Intel Shiva LanRover VPN Express supports standards-based IPsec tunneling, X.509 digital certificates, up to 168-bit encryption and automated key management in a single, high-performance solution. An optional integrated, serial interface and ICSA-certified firewall eliminate the need for a third party router or firewall products.

The Intel Shiva LanRover VPN Express supports Intel's Shiva Smart Tunneling for automated tunnel fail-over, scalability and load-balancing. Additionally, it is fully interoperable with both Intel Shiva Access Manager and the Intel Shiva Certificate Authority for integrated direct-dial and VPN authentication, authorization and accounting. The LanRover VPN Gateway Express is available immediately for $3,495 and includes 50 VPN client licenses.

Shiva is owned by Intel Network Systems Inc., formerly Shiva Corporation.
