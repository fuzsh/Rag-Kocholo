An unnamed man, nicknamed "Two-Bits", is a former drug dealer and an old friend of Jefferson Pierce. He mainly dealt Green Light all around Freeland.

Biography[]

Original multiverse[]

Early life[]

Two-Bits grew up around Jefferson Pierce, several years his junior.[1]

Criminal life[]

In 2018, Two-Bits hired Block to sell drugs for him.

Two-Bits was visited by Jefferson at Tanner's Taphouse, where he was told to stop selling the drugs by the latter. Two-Bits did not agree to him and replied that he has a family to look after. Jefferson later assaulted him as Black Lightning and left him unconscious.[1]

Sometime later, while selling DVDs on a street corner, Two-Bits spotted Lashawn selling Green Light to Neema Summers, who when consuming it showed extraordinary powers. Neema was shortly kidnapped by some A.S.A. agents a few minutes later. Two-Bits visited Jefferson the following day, informing him of Neema's kidnapping. Jefferson later visited Two-Bits as Black Lightning and stopped him from consuming drugs. Two-Bits claimed he had a license for it, but Jefferson asked him not to do it. He then proceeded to ask him to keep track of delivery trucks in Freeland.[2]

After the reported death of Peter Gambi, Two-Bits found Jefferson drinking in his bar and offered his condolences.[3]

The Freeland's resistance[]

When Chief Henderson gives a question and answer session about the assault on the police headquarters and offers a prize, Two Bits tosses a tomato at him. Henderson goes up against Two Bits at his bar, capturing him. Henderson takes Two Bits and Reverend Holt to an area and gives them video of Jefferson being beaten and uncovers that his need to unite with them - he's been driving the Resistance the entire time and Blackbird appears to go along with them.[4]

In the interim, the Resistance makes a play with Henderson and the Reverend trusting that a bomb will go off at a checkpoint so they can pass through, Black Lightning appears and defuses said bomb demolishing the arrangement.[5]

Anti-Monitor Crisis[]

During the Anti-Monitor Crisis, Two-Bits as well as everyone in the multiverse except for the seven Paragons, was killed in an antimatter wave by the Anti-Monitor on December 10, 2019,[6] only to be restored a month later, after the Paragons and the Spectre created a new universe.[7]

New multiverse[]

War for Freeland[]

Later, Latavious Johnson gets together with Devonte Jones as they keep on taking from the A.S.A. so they can offer weapons to the Resistance. They are additionally attempting to affirm Tobias Whale's area too.[8]

Two-Bits assisted Bill Henderson with escorting civilians to safety when they became surrounded by Markovian troopers; upon Bill's command, Two-Bits started shooting. Before they could be overwhelmed, Lala and Devonte arrived with a group of gun-wielding thugs who killed the troopers.[9]

One year later[]

A year after the War for Freeland, Two-Bits became a bartender; Jefferson had a booth in the bar and drank with a television nearby. Peter Gambi came into the bar and Two-Bits showed him where Jefferson was sitting as he attended another customer.[10]
