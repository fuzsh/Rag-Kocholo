        "text": "Two bits is an old slang term for 25 cents.\n\nIt’s based on the sense of the word bit that refers to one eighth of a U.S. dollar, or 12 ½ cents. However, monetary amounts counted in bits were only ever given in multiples of two, as in two bits and six bits. Two bits became an informal way of referring to the value of the 25-cent coin known as the quarter. It then came to be used in a general way meaning a small amount.\n\nIt’s still sometimes used this way, especially in negative statements, as in That piece of junk isn’t worth two bits or That job is like a vacation—I’d do it for two bits.\n\nIt is also the basis of the informal adjective two-bit, meaning inferior, cheap, worthless, or insignificant.\n\nTwo-bit is always used before the noun it describes. It’s perhaps most commonly used to negatively describe a person considered to be a small-time hack—someone who’s not good at what they do due to having a very low level of talent or skill. It’s especially used as an insult applied to people who have a high opinion of themselves to call them out as being far inferior in reality.\n\nDescribing something as two-bit means it’s low-quality. This is especially applied to products.\n\nExample: My dad likes to tell me stories about how he used to be able to buy a whole lunch for two bits—and get change!"
