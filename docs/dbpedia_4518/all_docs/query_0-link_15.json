Also, what would be some other phrases which would mean \"this person possesses worthless culture\" (I know it doesn't sound right in English).\n\nThanks!\n\nOnce upon a time, Spanish dollars, the forerunner of American dollars, were cut into eight pieces. These pieces were called \"bits\"\n\nTwo bits = 25c.\n\nTwo-bit is a common US expression meaning cheap, insignificant, mediocre, inferior.\n\nA two-bit thief, a two-bit cigar, a two-bit whore, two-bit culture.\n\nYou will occasionally see four-bit and six-bit in old texts.\n\nThere was a song years ago which mentioned a \"four-bit room\" = a room costing 50c."
