Transcript (English and Spanish Subtitles Available in Video, Click HERE for the Spanish Transcript)\n\nBy Raymond Malewitz, Oregon State University Associate Professor of American Literature\n\n4 December 2020\n\nAs our other video lessons on poetic meter, rhyme, alliteration, euphony, and cacophony make clear, poetry is a genre of sound as much as sense. The repetition of similar sounds at the ends of poetic lines are pleasing to our ears, and that’s one of the reasons why we enjoy rhymed poetry. The alternating stressed and unstressed patterns in poetic lines create a rhythm that propels a poem forward, and that’s one of the reasons why we enjoy metered poetry.\n\nToday, I want to discuss two more terms that help to create the soundscape of a poem: assonance and consonance. Both terms are associated with repetition—assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds and consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds—but these terms (as they are typically used) differ in 3 important ways from the patterning of rhyme.\n\nFirst: WHAT sounds are being repeated. Rhyme, as you may know, is the repetition of sounds at the end of a given pair of words, and these sounds usually combine vowels and consonants. For example, door rhymes with floor not only because of the r at the end, but also the long -o. “oor.”\n\nWhen we use the terms assonance and consonance, we’re calling attention to only one of these two kinds of sounds—either the consonants or the vowels. So why would we do that?\n\nTechnically, rhyme is a kind of assonance, but in practical terms, when we call something assonance, we often mean that only the vowel sound repeats between words. Along similar lines, when we call something consonance, we mean that only the consonant sounds repeat. Here’s a simple, silly example: “euphonous fish.” Both words in this phrase contain the repeating -f sound “euPHonous Fish,” but the vowel sounds, you’ll notice, aren’t the same. As such, we have consonance but not rhyme.\n\nSecond up: WHERE within the words are the sounds being repeated? With rhyming pairs, the common sound occurs at the end of each word. In the case of door and floor, the beginning sounds differ (d and fl) but the final sounds match (oor), creating the rhyme. With assonance and consonance, however, the recurring sound patterns can occur anywhere in the associated words—at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end. The phrase “euphonous fish” is an example of consonance because the -f sound repeats from word to word, even though the sound doesn’t necessarily repeat in the same spot in both words.\n\nFinally: WHERE does the repetition occur in a poem? In poetry, rhyming words usually occur at the end of poetic lines, creating complex patterns that knit lines (and indeed often entire poems) together. Instead of structuring the entirety of a poem or stanza, however, assonance and consonance usually show up irregularly in certain moments of a poem. In this way, assonance and consonance create temporary, ephemeral patterns in a given line or phrase that dissipate as quickly as they emerge.\n\nWhat sounds are being repeated? Where in the words are the sounds being repeated? And where in the poetic lines are the sounds being repeated? These three questions are a lot to keep track of, so let’s put it together with a simple example. Consider the following lines from Elizabeth Bishop’s poem “The Fish,” in which the speaker looks upon her catch. See if you can spot the consonance and assonance as I read:\n\nHe hung a grunting weight,\n\nBattered and venerable\n\nand homely. Here and there\n\nhis brown skin hung in strips\n\nlike ancient wallpaper,\n\nand its pattern of darker brown\n\nwas like wallpaper:\n\nshapes like full-blown roses\n\nstained and lost through age.\n\nHe was speckled with barnacles,\n\nfine rosettes of lime,\n\nand infested\n\nwith tiny white sea-lice,\n\nand underneath two or three\n\nrags of green weed hung down.\n\nAs you see, there isn’t any end-rhyme here, but the poem is undoubtedly musical. This is due in part to the consonance in the poem. Consider the opening line, which repeats the -ng sound with hung and grunting. Or the fourth line’s phrase “brown skin hung” n-n-n. Or the tenth line’s repetition of the hard -k sound “speckled with barnacles.” These repetitions AREN’T internal rhymes--the vowel sounds around the consonants aren’t always the same and this repetition doesn’t always occur at the ends of words—but they operate in a way similar to rhyme. They help Bishop convey the beauty as well as strangeness of this encounter with a fish.\n\nThere is also a bit of assonance in these lines. Consider the 13th line, in which Bishop’s speaker repeats a series of hard -i sounds, though again, not in a manner of internal rhyme: “tiny white sea-lice.” Or the alternation of hard -a and hard -o sounds in the lines:\n\n…wallpaper:\n\nshapes like full-blown roses\n\nstained and lost through age.\n\nAgain, there isn’t a regular pattern here. Instead, we’re given certain fragments of melodious or euphonious phrases that help us to structure the way we sound out the poem.\n\nLet me leave you with one final, complex example of consonance and assonance that will help you to distinguish these terms from rhyme. Here are the opening lines to Matthew Arnold’s 1867 poem “Dover Beach.”\n\nThe sea is calm tonight.\n\nThe tide is full, the moon lies fair\n\nUpon the straits; on the French coast the light\n\nGleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,\n\nGlimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.\n\nCome to the window, sweet is the night-air!\n\nOnly, from the long line of spray\n\nWhere the sea meets the moon-blanched land,\n\nListen! you hear the grating roar\n\nOf pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,\n\nAt their return, up the high strand,\n\nBegin, and cease, and then again begin,\n\nWith tremulous cadence slow, and bring\n\nThe eternal note of sadness in.\n\nIn these lines, the sound patterns of Arnold’s words mimic the waves of the sea as they crash against the beach. They do so because of rhyme, sure. We get rhymes between lines 2, 6, and 9 and we get a separate set of rhymes in lines 8 and 11 and in lines 10 and 12. We also get a CRAZY amount of internal rhyme in line 10: “Begin, and cease, and then begin again.”\n\nBut Arnold’s use of assonance and consonance also contributes to the noise of the sea. In the second line, a little sonic pattern is established in the repetition of -f sounds: “the tide is full, the moon lies fair.” Or, in the fourth line, a little pattern emerges in the repetition of “gleams and is gone”: the pattern emerging and then dissipating in the same way that the light emerges and then disappears.\n\nWe also get a bit of assonance packed in alongside the consonance. In line 8, for example, we get the repetition of the short-a and the -l sounds in “moon-blanched land.” This assonance, again, isn’t rhyme, but it performs the same function as rhyme, conveying the effect of the moon casting its light (and, here, its sound) upon the land.\n\nAs Arnold’s and Bishop’s sound experiments suggest, repetition in poetry is not always as regular or as simple as rhyme and meter. At certain moments, other, more subtle repetitions emerge to challenge and delight us as we sound out the poetry we love.\n\nWant to cite this?\n\nMLA Citation: Malewitz, Raymond. \"What are Assonance and Consonance?\" Oregon State Guide to English Literary Terms, 4 Dec. 2020, Oregon State University, liberalarts.oregonstate.edu/wlf/what-are-assonance-and-consonance.
