        "text": "When I am stuck on something I’m trying to write and have exhausted all the other options—ignoring the problem, staring blankly at the problem, moving the problem around to see if it’s less annoying in some other location, eating all the chocolate in the house—I eventually do what I should have done in the first place and go read some writer who is much better at this business than I am. The candidates are legion. But, from the whole long, idiosyncratic list of authors I regularly turn to for intellectual and aesthetic resuscitation, one of the most consistently useful is Norman Maclean.\n\nIf you know Maclean, it is likely because of his first work, “A River Runs Through It and Other Stories,” a triptych of tales—about, among other things, families, fly-fishing, love, death, and a time when virtually all hard work in this country was still done by hand—that was published to enormous acclaim and considerable astonishment when the author was seventy-three years old. For many years before that collection appeared, in 1976, Maclean had tried to write a book about the Battle of Little Bighorn. For all the years afterward, until his death, at eighty-seven, he worked on a book about a different tragedy on a hillside—a wildfire in Montana that killed twelve smoke jumpers and a forest ranger—which was published, posthumously, as “Young Men and Fire.”\n\nThat comes to two and a half books. Add to them a handful of lectures, essays, and sketches, most written or resurrected in the flurry of sudden, late-in-life fame, and you have Maclean’s entire literary output. You could read it all in a single day, yet it contains almost everything there is to know about what the English language can do. Are you trying to deploy a fact in a non-boring way? Consider this, on the geology of the Blackfoot River Valley: “The boulders on the flat were shaped by the last ice age only eighteen or twenty thousand years ago, but the red and green precambrian rocks beside the blue water were almost from the basement of the world and time.” Are you trying to find a new way to describe an old familiar thing? Consider this, on afternoon thunderstorms in the mountains: “By three-thirty or four, the lightning would be flexing itself on the distant ridges like a fancy prizefighter, skipping sideways, ducking, showing off but not hitting anything.” Are you trying to find a beginning for a story? Consider this, the opening line of “Young Men and Fire”: “In 1949 the Smokejumpers were not far from their origins as parachute jumpers turned stunt performers dropping from the wings of planes at county fairs just for the hell of it plus a few dollars, less hospital expenses.” That is a fly fisherman’s prose, spinning in glittering circles overhead before landing exactly where it must, for a story that is running headlong toward mortal danger.\n\nWhat We’re Reading\n\nDiscover notable new fiction and nonfiction.\n\nExamples like this abound, but you can’t capture Maclean’s brilliance just by quoting him. Much of what he did best was architectural, and the strength of his writing often comes from the soundness of his structures, large and small. A beguiling setup leads to a punch line, or to a gut punch; the oomph of a sentence derives from how perfectly it caps or how swiftly it topples the ones that came before. My copies of his books are filled with underlinings that sometimes run for pages on end before terminating in an exclamation point.\n\nMaybe you are nodding along vigorously as you read this, or maybe you have never heard of Maclean. His status has always been ambiguous—too celebrated to count as a cult favorite, too marginal to be a favorite over all—and his cultural standing peaked in the nineteen-nineties, after Robert Redford made the title story of “A River Runs Through It” into an Academy Award-winning movie starring Brad Pitt. But every once in a while someone who shares my smittenness emerges with another glimpse of the man: a personal reflection, a scholarly consideration, a new volume of collected works, even though there is never really any new work to be collected.\n\nThe latest addition to this narrow bookshelf is Rebecca McCarthy’s “Norman Maclean: A Life of Letters and Rivers” (Washington). Maclean was a friend of McCarthy’s family and a mentor to her when she was an undergraduate at the University of Chicago, where he taught for decades. That connection is sometimes illuminating but more often distracting; McCarthy’s book dwells too much on their interactions and on his academic career, at the expense of momentum and chronology. Still, as the first full-length biography of Maclean, it is long overdue, and not only because his fiction cleaves so closely to his life that the two are best considered side by side. Like every brilliant author, Maclean simultaneously seems inexplicable and demands explication—some attempt to answer the questions raised by his prose. One of those questions is practical, a matter of craft: How does he do this? But another is ontological: What kind of man could make this work?\n\nNorman Maclean was born in Clarinda, Iowa, two days before Christmas of 1902. His father, a Scotch Canadian from Nova Scotia, was a passionate angler and a Presbyterian minister. His mother, a schoolteacher before she married, was vivacious where her husband was reserved and affectionate where he tended toward dour.\n\nWhen Norman was six—by which time he had a younger brother, Paul—the family moved to Missoula, Montana. The state was barely older than the boy, and Missoula was still just a logging town, hewed out of a vast wilderness and home in the off-hours to single men and the services that spring up wherever they congregate. Saloons were plentiful; prostitution and gambling were practiced profligately. Bears sometimes wandered into the streets from the nearby mountains and drunken men sometimes did the reverse, freezing to death in the foothills when they overshot the edge of town. The entertainment options ran to rodeos and fights of every kind: dog on dog, badger on bulldog, man on man. Being underage did not exempt anyone from this combative culture, and neither did being the preacher’s son. “Some guys would try to beat the hell out of my brother and me, just to see what we would do,” Maclean said. Such guys assumed that Paul and Norman were obliged to exercise restraint because of their father. But the Reverend had no objection to brawls, so long as the boys won. Back home in Nova Scotia, his father and uncles had been known as “the fighting Macleans.”\n\nIn most respects, however, the town’s lawlessness stopped at the Macleans’ front door. Together with his family, Norman prayed on his knees after breakfast and dinner and went to church on Wednesday evenings and four times on Sundays. His father, in deference to his calling, didn’t swear—a genuine sacrifice, Maclean felt, for someone who, as a Scotsman, was “coded for profanity.” Virtue came more naturally to Maclean’s mother, a teetotaller and a member of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union. Even after Norman grew up and developed his own strong opinions about alcohol—gin-and-tonic post-tennis, wine with dinner, bourbon afterward—he never drank in front of his mother.\n\nThis moral contrast between home and town was one of two stark oppositions that shaped Maclean’s early years. The other pertained to his formal education. For years, his main teacher was his father, who was inspired by how successfully a fellow-Scotsman had homeschooled his own firstborn son: a boy named John Stuart Mill. After breakfast, the Reverend Maclean would read aloud from Wordsworth or Milton or the Bible; then came three hours of instruction, during which Norman was made to write an essay while his father worked on his sermons. After forty-five minutes, Norman was summoned to see the Reverend, who spent fifteen minutes criticizing the essay before sending the boy away with a mandate to make it shorter. Those same events occurred the next hour and the one after that—except that, at the end of the final hour, the essay was thrown in the trash.\n\nThe method was unconventional, the instructor was unforgiving, and the pupil sometimes spent nearly as much time crying as writing. “I cannot tell you,” Maclean later wrote, “how much of life 15 minutes can be when you are six, seven, eight, nine, or ten years old and alone with a red-headed Presbyterian minister and cannot answer one of his questions.” The saving grace of these mornings was that, when the time was up, Norman was free to grab a rifle or a fishing rod and head outdoors. About the only thing the two halves of his day had in common was the expectation that the boy would rely on his own resources and answer for his own behavior, which in the wilderness mostly just meant staying alive.\n\nThis era of Maclean’s life lasted until he was ten and a half, at which point a truant officer found him out hunting in the middle of the day and put an end to the experiment. Maclean went off to the Missoula public schools and then to Dartmouth, which he chose because he thought it would be easier to slip away to the woods there than it would be at Harvard. But he quickly grew to despise the affluent prep-school kids around him, whose only virtue, he felt, was how often and how expensively they lost to him at poker. He later spoke of only one close college friend, “the craziest guy I ever met,” an irreverent, word-mad classmate named Theodor Geisel: the future Dr. Seuss.\n\nHe also spoke of just one outstanding course—with Robert Frost. As a professor, Frost did not suffer fools, chiefly because he did not trouble himself to discover any; he began speaking when class started, took no questions, and walked out the moment he was done. For at least one student, raised on even sterner stuff, the method worked. It’s impossible not to hear something of Frost in Maclean, who became to Montana what the poet was to New England: a plainspoken chronicler of its customs, with a musing, conversational tone that masked an ironclad control over prosody. Maclean learned meter from his mother, who tapped his hand on the kitchen table while reading poetry aloud until he could tell anapests from iambs. That mastery is the invisible force tightening all the bolts on Maclean’s prose. “My ordinary style,” he once said, “is better than ordinary speech, but not so much you would notice it.”\n\nAside from these two wildly different literary eminences, Maclean cared little for Dartmouth and escaped it as often as he could to go back to the Montana woods. By then, he had been not just playing but working in those woods for many years, beginning at fourteen, when he took a job in the logging industry. Soon, he switched to the United States Forest Service, which he liked so much that he returned for summers during college and again after graduation, building trails and fighting fires and helping to pack horse-and-mule trains with enough supplies to sustain those activities. It took him a decade to give up on the idea of a career with the U.S.F.S., and all his life he wondered what kind of life that would have been. “I wanted to be a head packer,” he wrote, at the age of eighty-four, “and still do.”\n\nIt was while Maclean was back in Montana after college that he met Jessie Burns, a young woman from the two-street town of Wolf Creek. Maclean was captivated by her self-assurance and high spirits, and in 1929, after he had begun working as a graduate assistant at the University of Chicago, she joined him there. Two years later, they got married. But, while Norman was turning into an upstanding adult, the same could not be said of his younger brother. Even in early childhood, Paul had driven his parents to distraction; smart, charming, and sublimely indifferent to authority, he was, as McCarthy writes, “fond of flipping cards in the back pew while his father preached.” As an adult, he was handsome, secretive, and pugnacious, with a drinking problem, a gambling problem, and an ever-increasing debt in a not at all friendly local poker game. By 1937, McCarthy writes, the Reverend Maclean felt that Paul was “headed straight to hell if he stayed in Montana.” At their father’s urging, Norman persuaded his younger brother to join him in Chicago.\n\nScarcely more than a year later, on May 1, 1938, Paul took the woman he was dating to a White Sox game, followed by an evening on the town. Afterward, Paul escorted her home, then headed out alone into the night. He was found at sunrise, in an alley on the city’s South Side, with his head bashed in. He died later that day.\n\nMaclean accompanied his brother’s body on the long train ride back to Montana. He was awash in grief and guilt; not only had he encouraged his baby brother to move to Chicago—he had failed all his life to find a way to help him. He was also tormented by not knowing what had happened: whether Paul had been murdered for old gambling debts or new ones, or for some other reason that would never be known, or for no reason at all, a victim of random violence. No one was ever charged, let alone convicted, in the killing. Maclean and his mother learned to live with the uncertainty and the grief. But the Reverend, McCarthy suggests, died of it, felled by a stroke three years after his son was murdered.\n\nIt took four decades for the death of Paul Maclean to reveal itself as the catalyzing event of one of the more remarkable careers in American letters. In its immediate aftermath, Norman simply returned to Chicago and earned his Ph.D. He and Jessie had two children in quick succession—a daughter, Jean, and a son, John—and Maclean became a fixture at the university. He stayed through the Second World War (when he taught marksmanship and orienteering alongside English literature), through the upheaval of the nineteen-sixties, through five decades and four university presidents and countless trends in college education. Throughout it all, he himself had an unchanging understanding of his job: “A great teacher is a tough guy who cares very deeply about something that is hard to understand.”\n\nThe “tough guy” part came naturally to Maclean. Like his father before him, he was a formidable and unsparing critic, and anyone who fell short of his high standards—a student who turned in subpar work, a colleague whose career foundered, a friend whose marriage fell apart—could expect to face his undisguised disgust. “Sometimes the split was irreparable and he cast them out of the tribe forever,” McCarthy writes. “The Calvinist in him hated failure.” As a result, many people who knew Maclean feared him. Yet he was also widely beloved—especially by his female students, whose intellects he took seriously—and those who got his praise knew they had earned it.\n\nBut, if Maclean poured energy into teaching, he withheld it from scholarship: in his entire career, he published just two academic articles. “He ended the ‘publish or perish’ debate for himself with a rhetorical question,” his son wrote in a memoir. “ ‘Does the world need another article on lyric poetry?’ ” Deciding that it did not—and recognizing some very different need in himself—Maclean left campus every summer for a cabin on Seeley Lake, an hour northeast of Missoula. It was his Innisfree: “The only place in the world,” he once wrote to his wife, “where my troubled soul feels at peace.”\n\nFor a long, hard spell in Maclean’s later years, the troubles grew greater and the peace more elusive. Jessie, a lifelong smoker, was diagnosed at the age of forty-five with emphysema, which would eventually be compounded by esophageal cancer. Two years later, Maclean’s mother died. By the early nineteen-sixties, Maclean was suffering from his own health problems, which routinely landed him in the hospital. That’s where he was when, in 1968, friends came to his room to tell him that, elsewhere on the premises, Jessie had succumbed to cancer. After that, Maclean’s emotional health collapsed as well. Then one day, during a third stint in a psychiatric ward, he turned to his son-in-law, who was visiting, and said, “I’m sick of this shit.” He went home, returned to teaching, and began dating. In 1973, he retired from the university amid a shower of accolades. Then he settled down to finally do the work he had been training to do, knowingly or otherwise, since the age of six.\n\n“A River Runs Through It” contains three stories: the title novella plus two shorter tales, “USFS 1919: The Ranger, the Cook, and a Hole in the Sky” and “Logging and Pimping and ‘Your Pal, Jim.’ ” When Maclean finished a draft, he shared it with Allen Fitchen, an editor at the University of Chicago Press, who immediately recognized it as “a work of genius.” Fitchen wanted to publish it, but the mission of the press did not include fiction, and so, playing the role of an obliging colleague, he helped steer it to an editor at Knopf. That man reacted as Fitchen had hoped, dismissing the manuscript as “not a saleable book.” (Maclean, an epic holder of grudges, relished the occasion when, years later, Knopf came knocking. If it were the only publishing house left on the planet and he were the only author, he informed the unfortunate emissary, that would “be the end of the world of books.”)\n\nWhile Maclean fumed, Fitchen persuaded his colleagues at Chicago to publish the book. The initial print run was five thousand copies. To date, it has sold well over a million in English alone. “The usual channels of publicity and criticism had virtually nothing to do with it,” Wallace Stegner, a great admirer of the book, wrote. “Neither did literary fashion, for that, along with the orthodoxies of contemporary short story form, is simply ignored in these stories.” Maclean wrote entirely according to his own instincts, which, like so much of his life, had been shaped by the unlikely merger of two sources: the Western canon and that other Western tradition, in which men sat around campfires or on barstools swapping tall tales. Maclean spoke with equal admiration of Wordsworth and Rabelais and a master storyteller he once encountered in the woods, “the only one I ever heard who could tell a whole story with only two grammatical subjects”: “them sons-of-bitches” and “the rest of us bastards.” When the time came for him to commit his own fiction to print, he said, “I went back to my memory of Montana for my energy and to my years of teaching literature for the power lines to conduct it.”\n\nAgain and again, I myself return to his stories for energy. One reason is that they are very funny: in keeping with the tall-tale tradition, which favors brevity, action, and humor, Maclean was an excellent comic writer. “USFS 1919” contains a rare and perfect instance of what I can only call textual physical comedy—an entire fight scene viewed low down and prone, from the sawdust beneath a saloon table where the narrator has been knocked flat, leaving him to distinguish between the battling parties solely by their footwear. It also contains a different kind of battle, this one over the name of a tributary of the Clearwater River known to locals as Wet Ass Creek. The narrator takes delight in helping persuade a team of federal surveyors to submit the rightful name to the map-drafting office, but in the end the joke is on him. When the map is published, the name is rendered as a single word with a final “e”: “Wě-tä’-sē Creek, just as if its headwaters were on Beacon Hill.”\n\nYet, for all the humor in these tales, sorrow courses underneath them. Maclean is mourning, in part, a whole lost way of being. His setting is the Rocky Mountain West in the early twentieth century, a time and place when manual labor predominated (not by accident is the main character in each story a master of some physical task: logging, packing, fishing) and most people lived cheek by jowl with nature. He clearly loves that world, and yet—this is another reason I admire him—his writing is elegiac without ever being nostalgic. He understands, as Frost did, the human toll of living in constant proximity to axes and saws, livestock and wildlife, fires and floods, and he refuses to let the passage of time soften the experience. You will encounter, in his book, a shepherd who has worn his underwear for so long that his hair has grown through the fabric, such that when it must finally be removed swaths of his skin come off, too; you will encounter injured ranchers riding into two-bit towns in search of help, “holding their intestines in their hands.” “It was a world that was infinitely beautiful and very tough,” Maclean told Studs Terkel after the book came out, “and it’s hard at times to tell the toughness from the beauty.”\n\nStill, the most evident object of mourning in “A River Runs Through It” is not the world at large but Paul, whose death, lightly fictionalized, solemnizes the title story. That story, in turn, anchors the collection, partly because of its gravitas and partly because of its beauty. It is one of American literature’s truly great accounts of family breakdown, and one of its most unusual: the Gospel of Luke by way of Izaak Walton and Paul Bunyan.\n\nThe entire novella is structured, subtly, as a series of fishing lessons, though they are far more than that, as its famous opening sentence establishes: “In our family, there was no clear line between religion and fly fishing.” The fictional Reverend Maclean, like the real one, is a dedicated fly fisher, and he wants to pass the art on to his sons. Paul is a quick study—he soon becomes a better angler than his father, maybe a better angler than anyone—but the early days are rough going. The boys, being boys, just want to go out and start trying to catch fish, “omitting entirely anything difficult or technical in the way of preparation.” But the Reverend believes that people who don’t know how to fish should not be allowed to catch anything, “so my brother and I learned to cast Presbyterian-style, on a metronome.”\n\nThat lesson, on casting on a four-count beat, is the first one in the book, and it doubles as an introduction to the dynamics of the Maclean family. The instruction carries on from there: how to read the water, how to choose a fly, how to set a hook. It’s easy to miss the orderly way all this unfolds. It’s also easy to be indifferent to fishing and still adore the book, because in the meantime we are treated to the sometimes farcical tale of what happens when the upright Norman and the wayward but honorable Paul must take an insufferable brother-in-law fishing. We get a look, too, at the one-woman sex trade of a tiny Montana town and at the vicious anti-Native attitude prevalent throughout the state, which Paul and Norman both despise and Paul provokes by dating a Native woman. Neither that girlfriend nor the prostitute is what you would call a strong female role model, but they are both strong female characters, specific and plausible and tragic. (Maclean had no patience for the habit of confusing virtuousness with accuracy of depiction. His Custer manuscript contains a scathing line about how Sioux and Cheyenne women at the time of Little Bighorn “should not be sentimentalized into sweet Victorian types in extra good physical condition.”)\n\nAround the edges of all this, a lot of fish get away and a lot of fish get caught, but only when we are almost at the end of the story do we actually witness someone land one. That is the final lesson, delivered via a master class by Paul, who is catching the last of his limit after his father and brother have given up for the day. We watch him through their eyes, sitting on the riverbank partly jealous but mostly delighted as Paul reels in a monster fish, swims across the swift water carrying his rod and his catch, then comes charging jubilantly up the bank toward them: “He dripped all over us, like a young duck dog that in its joy forgets to shake itself before getting close.”\n\nOne page later, he is dead. In the book, the murder happens in Montana, a reflection of Maclean’s Aristotelian commitment to unity of place but perhaps also a way of exorcising guilt over inviting his brother to Chicago, of telling himself that Paul would have met the same fate anywhere. The question lurking beneath that change in setting—whether the younger Maclean was doomed from the beginning—is central to why the book works. What makes it heartbreaking is not just that Paul dies. It’s not even just that everyone loves him and no one knows how to help him. It’s that no one knows whether he can be helped: if he is desperate for assistance or determined to rebuff it; if it was always impossible or if the right act at the right moment might have saved him. At one point, Paul tells a story about driving mesmerized through the dark as a hare bounds along in the beam of his headlights. Then he crashes the car—allegedly because the hare turned and he did not, but more likely because the man, unlike the hare, had been drinking. Norman mulls it over, then concludes, “Since it was no great thing either way, I finally decided to forget it, and, as you see, I didn’t.”\n\nOf course he didn’t—for what is “A River Runs Through It” about but the impossibility of knowing, when you are chasing after some beautiful wild creature, whether you are frightening it or lighting its way or simply bearing witness while it does what it would be doing even if you were not there to see it. That is why, despite all its technical and topographical specificity, the book had such universal appeal. Maclean knew he had caught tragedy in his high beams, because readers wrote to tell him so again and again: “I have a brother just like that, and I can’t find anything to do that will help him.” Such readers loved Paul because they loved someone like Paul—a prodigal son or daughter or sister or brother, recognizable and precious to countless generations of siblings and parents whose hearts could never be free of worry and grief.\n\nThe “unsaleable book” not only sold; it almost won the Pulitzer Prize. It was the first choice of the 1977 fiction jury, but the Pulitzer board, murmuring that the nominees were “not as distinguished as we would have liked,” declined to award a prize that year. The resulting brouhaha was likely as good for sales as the prize would have been; over the years, similar snubs had been doled out to Ernest Hemingway, Eudora Welty, Saul Bellow, and Thomas Pynchon. Nonetheless, Maclean, who was not modest about his talents, was understandably displeased.\n\nHe was not, however, daunted. Although he was by then seventy-four years old, Maclean felt that as a writer he was just beginning. His interests were wide, but his grand theme was the problem of Paul: of young men whose violent deaths raised unanswerable questions. That had been the impulse behind his Little Bighorn project—enhanced, no doubt, by the fact that General Custer had fought side by side with a brother in that battle, and that the brother’s body had been hideously mutilated after death, while the General’s remained nearly pristine. When that book thwarted him, he turned to the 1949 wildfire at Mann Gulch, a place he had first visited when parts of the hillside were still smoldering. The resulting work of nonfiction is nearly as beautiful as “A River Runs Through It,” and similarly concerned with the question of inevitability—with whether all those barely-more-than-boys were doomed to burn to death in the canyon. Once again, Maclean knew the question was unanswerable. “There’s a lot of tragedy in the universe that has missing parts and comes to no conclusion,” he wrote, “including probably the tragedy that awaits you and me.”\n\nMaclean’s own tragedy came for him quietly, on the morning of August 2, 1990, as he sat down to breakfast in his Chicago apartment. He loved that city dearly; still, it was no place for him to spend eternity. His ashes were scattered in the Swan Range, the mountains overlooking Seeley Lake.\n\nThose ashes had long since turned into Montana by the time I first read Norman Maclean. I started with “Young Men and Fire,” and then moved on to “A River Runs Through It,” and then moved on to wishing Maclean had lived long enough to get around to earth and air. His great gift was for capturing our relationship to the elemental things: fire and water, mountains and rivers, death and love. I fell for his work right away, partly because I, too, am drawn to the beauty of wild places, but chiefly because he reminds me that language is also an elemental thing, that our connection to it is primal, and that the number of things that can be done with it is infinite. “A River Runs Through It” ends with a theological debate between the Reverend and the narrator about the place of rivers in the creation of the universe. The narrator regards them as fundamental, present even when all was void and God’s face moved upon the waters. But it is the Reverend who prevails: in the beginning was the word. ♦"
