        "text": "TEACHING\n\nAs part of your English Literature degree, your timetable will include a breakdown of your scheduled lessons with timeslots for you to be able to explore your independent research interests.\n\nYour classes will be based at our Peel Park Campus. Teaching and learning on the course can involve a range of methods and resources.\n\nLectures will deliver a formal method of teaching, with one lecturer addressing a large group of students from different courses, while tutorials offer an informal method of small-group teaching that is student-oriented and often student-led. Seminars are another informal teaching situation which tends to be a mixture of tutor-led and student-led discussion\n\nIn addition to these sessions, you will have access to interactive computer resources which are available for you to use during your studies. You will also take part in student-directed study, which is where projects and deadlines are assigned.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nYou will be assessed through a combination of exams and coursework such as essays, presentations, podcasts, blogs, or portfolios. Most modules incorporate some form of assessment at a relatively early stage of the course to allow you to identify your strengths and weaknesses prior to undertaking your final exam, essay or project.\n\nAs part of the core modules on this course, you will undertake three exams.\n\nAll of our English courses are delivered by the Salford School of Arts, Media, and Creative Technology. Our focus is to ensure that you have the skills you need to pursue your intellectual and career interests, and we encourage our students, past and present, to collaborate with each other and to achieve great things.\n\nEach year—through the Create Student Awards—our School rewards the incredible achievements and successes of our final year and postgraduate students.\n\nWhatever you choose to study with us, you will be mentored and supported by experts. And once you graduate, it will not end there. You will join a thriving alumni network across Greater Manchester and beyond, which means that you will be supported professionally and personally whenever you need it."
