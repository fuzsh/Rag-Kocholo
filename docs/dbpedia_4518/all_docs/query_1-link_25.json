        "meta_description": "Coinage is an integral part of a\r\ncountry’s culture and history, helping tell the story of the nation’s\r\nbeginnings. But of course, the minting of coins cannot happen before a country\r\nis appreciably organized. That was certainly true in early America.The first British\r\ncolonists arrived on the eastern shores of the New World in the 17th\r\ncentury, and brought with them familiar objects, ideals and customs – including\r\nthe English monetary system. As British subjects, they used the same basic\r\nunits of currency: pounds, shillings and pence. Although an ocean\r\nseparated the colonists from the British monarchy, they were not yet out from\r\nunder its manicured and bejeweled thumb. England you see, wanted to have its\r\ncrumpets – and eat them too — maintaining control by requiring that any\r\ncoinage must be shipped across the pond to pay for imported goods, but by also\r\nprohibiting the colonists from producing their own. This oversight became just\r\none of the many stepping stones laid on the path toward the Revolutionary War.Because of the Crown’s stinginess, colony-created paper currency and\r\nany foreign coinage to be had circulated throughout the original Thirteen\r\nColonies. Spanish pieces would begin to fill the void; silver deposits and\r\nminting operations in areas of the New World controlled by Spain made these\r\ncoins more accessible to the English settlers than their own native currency.The eight reales, or Spanish dollar was the largest of these silver\r\ncoins. Due to the scarcity of small denomination coins, to make change a\r\nSpanish dollar would sometimes be cut into eight triangular parts, with each\r\nwedge or “bit” the equivalent of one eighth of a dollar. The term “bit” was\r\nused by the English to refer to small denomination coinage, thus “two-bits”\r\nequaled a quarter dollar, “four-bits,” a half dollar; and so on. This practice\r\nalso earned the coin the legendary moniker, “piece of eight” long associated\r\nwith pirate’s plunder.As most citizens of the newly-independent United States of America were\r\nfamiliar with units of the eight real, Thomas Jefferson thought it wise to\r\nadopt a similar monetary system based upon the big silver coin.  It is believed that the U.S. dollar sign ($)\r\nwas an adaption of the Herculean pillars depicted on the reverse side of the\r\neight reales. Even after the U.S. Mint issued its own official dollar\r\ndenomination, this silver-laden coin remained legal-tender in America until\r\n1857 and circulated freely for many years beyond.Americans were not the only ones who\r\nappreciated these Spanish silver pieces. The\r\nconsistent silver content and availability of\r\nthe eight reales led to its global use,\r\nbecoming the first internationally recognized trade currency. Pieces of eight would\r\nlater cross oceans, carried by New England clipper ships to facilitate trade\r\nwith the Far East —  and so trusted was\r\nthis coin that many Asian merchants would refuse to accept any other form of\r\npayment. Surviving coins often bear the chop marks of those merchants from long\r\nago — a reminder of their exotic past. Today these big silver treasures are a favorite\r\nof collectors who appreciate history, numismatic value and silver content. As with\r\nmost collectibles, there are fewer and fewer available in the marketplace as\r\ntime goes on making now a great time to acquire&amp;nbsp;one of these coins for yourself.",
