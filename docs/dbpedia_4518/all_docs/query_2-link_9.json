        "text": "About the course\n\nThe English Language and Literature course at Oxford is one of the broadest in the country, giving you the chance to study writing in English from its origins in Anglo-Saxon England to the present.\n\nAs well as British literature, you can study works written in English from other parts of the world, and some originally written in other languages, allowing you to think about literature in English in multilingual and global contexts across time.\n\nThe course allows you a considerable degree of choice, both in developing your personal interests across core papers, and in choosing a topic for your dissertation and for a special option in your final year.\n\nOptions have included:\n\nLiterature and revolution\n\nPostcolonial literature\n\nWriting lives\n\nOld Norse\n\nTragedy\n\nFilm criticism.\n\nStudying literature at Oxford involves the development of sophisticated reading skills and of an ability to place literary texts in their wider intellectual and historical contexts. It also requires you to:\n\nconsider the critical processes by which you analyse and judge\n\nlearn about literary form and technique\n\nevaluate various approaches to literary criticism and theory\n\nstudy the development of the English language.\n\nThe Oxford English Faculty is the largest English department in Britain. Students are taught in tutorials by an active scholar in their field, many of whom also give lectures to all students in the English Faculty. You will therefore have the opportunity to learn from a wide range of specialist teachers.\n\nLibrary provision for English at Oxford is exceptionally good. All students have access to the Bodleian Library (with its extensive manuscript collection), the English Faculty Library, their own college libraries and a wide range of electronic resources.\n\nIn your first year, you will be introduced to the conceptual and technical tools used in the study of language and literature, and to a wide range of different critical approaches. At the same time, you will be doing tutorial work on early medieval literature, Victorian literature and literature from 1910 to the present.\n\nIn your second and third years, you will extend your study of English literary history in four more period papers ranging from late medieval literature to Romanticism. These papers are assessed by three-hour written examinations at the end of your third year. You will also produce:\n\na portfolio of three essays on Shakespeare, on topics of your choice\n\nan extended essay (or occasionally an examination) relating to a special options paper, chosen from a list of around 25 courses\n\nand an 8,000-word dissertation on a subject of your choice.\n\nSubmitted work will constitute almost half of the final assessment for most students.\n\nAlternatively, in the second and third years, you can choose to follow our specialist course in Medieval Literature and Language, with papers covering literature in English from 650-1550 along with the history of the English language up to 1800, with a further paper either on Shakespeare or on manuscript and print culture. Students on this course also take a special options paper and submit a dissertation on a topic of their choice.\n\nAstrophoria Foundation Year\n\nIf you’re interested in studying English but your personal or educational circumstances have meant you are unlikely to achieve the grades typically required for Oxford courses, then choosing to apply for English with a Foundation Year might be the course for you.\n\nVisit our Foundation Year course pages for more details.\n\nUnistats information\n\nDiscover Uni course data provides applicants with Unistats statistics about undergraduate life at Oxford for a particular undergraduate course.\n\nPlease select 'see course data' to view the full Unistats data for English Language and Literature.\n\nPlease note that there may be no data available if the number of course participants is very small.\n\nVisit the Studying at Oxford section of this page for a more general insight into what studying here is likely to be like.\n\nEnglish Language and Literature\n\nA typical week\n\nAlthough details of practice vary from college to college, most students will have one or two tutorials (usually two students and a tutor) and one or two classes (in groups of around 8 to 10) each week. A tutorial usually involves discussion of an essay, which you will have produced based on your own reading and research that week. You will normally be expected to produce between eight and twelve pieces of written work each term. Most students will also attend several lectures each week.\n\nTutorials are usually 2-3 students and a tutor. Class sizes may vary depending on the options you choose. In college, there would usually be 6-12 students and in the department there would usually be no more than 15 students. There might be specific circumstances in which some classes contain around 20 students.\n\nMost tutorials, classes, and lectures are delivered by staff who are tutors in their subject. Many are world-leading experts with years of experience in teaching and research. Some teaching may also be delivered by postgraduate students who are usually studying at doctoral level.\n\nTo find out more about how our teaching year is structured, visit our Academic Year page.\n\nCourse structure\n\nYear 1\n\nCourses\n\nAssessment\n\nFour papers are taken:\n\nIntroduction to English language and literature\n\nEarly medieval literature, 650–1350\n\nLiterature in English, 1830–1910\n\nLiterature in English, 1910–present day\n\nThree written papers form the First University Examination, together with a submitted portfolio of two essays for Introduction to English language and literature.
