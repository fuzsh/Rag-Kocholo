        "text": "Caballoschica may be correct, or not. Lack of background and context are the usual culprits.\n\nIf Gusvin had provided those, we might know, for example, if the quoted text comes from a technical software manual, in which case two bits has a different meaning than in general, colloquial conversation.\n\nThe amount of information in any particular message depends on the probability, P, of that message. The more probable the message, the less information it contains.\n\nThe less probable the message, the more information it contains.\n\nInformation content = log(1/P) = -log(P)\n\nUsing base 2 logs, this gives the information content in bits.\n\nIf a message is certain, it conveys no information whatsoever:\n\nlog (1) = 0\n\n1948 C. E. SHANNON in Bell Syst. Techn. Jrnl. July 380 The choice of a logarithmic base corresponds to the choice of a unit for measuring information. If the base 2 is used the resulting units may be called binary digits, or more briefly bits, a word suggested by J. W. Tukey.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that the example is using bit in this specialist sense, but as I learnt this xx years ago when a mere student and have never needed to refer to it since finals, I wanted to use it again."
