        "text": "Given two bit sequences as strings, write a function to return the addition of the two sequences. Bit strings can be of different lengths also. For example, if string 1 is “1100011” and second string 2 is “10”, then the function should return “1100101”.\n\nWe strongly recommend that you click here and practice it, before moving on to the solution.\n\nSince the sizes of two strings may be different, we first make the size of a smaller string equal to that of the bigger string by adding leading 0s. After making sizes the same, we one by one add bits from rightmost bit to leftmost bit. In every iteration, we need to sum 3 bits: 2 bits of 2 given strings and carry. The sum bit will be 1 if, either all of the 3 bits are set or one of them is set. So we can do XOR of all bits to find the sum bit. How to find carry – carry will be 1 if any of the two bits is set. So we can find carry by taking OR of all pairs. Following is step by step algorithm.\n\n1. Make them equal sized by adding 0s at the beginning of smaller string.\n\n2. Perform bit addition\n\n…..Boolean expression for adding 3 bits a, b, c\n\n…..Sum = a XOR b XOR c\n\n…..Carry = (a AND b) OR ( b AND c ) OR ( c AND a )\n\nFollowing is implementation of the above algorithm.\n\nOutput\n\nSum is 1100101\n\nTime Complexity: O(|str1|)\n\nAuxiliary Space: O(1)\n\nMethod – 2 (without adding extra zeros(0) in beginning of a small length string to make both strings with same length)\n\nAlgo :\n\nmake to pointer i,j and set i = str1.size() – 1 and j = str2.size() – 1\n\ntake initial carry as 0 ans ans string as empty (“”)\n\nwhile i>=0 or j>=0 or carry\n\nadd value of str1[i] and str2[j] in carry\n\nadd (carry%2) in resulting(answer string) string\n\nset carry = carry/2\n\nreturn ans\n\nOutput\n\nSum is 1100101\n\nTime Complexity: O(max(n,m)) (where, n = sizeof str1 & m = sizeof str2) Space Complexity: O(1)\n\nThis article is compiled by Ravi Chandra Enaganti."
