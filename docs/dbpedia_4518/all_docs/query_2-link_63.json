        "text": "We see work experience as a learning experience – a chance to dip your toe into the working world and see what publishing is like.\n\nAs part of our aims to make publishing more inclusive, we want to break down barriers to entering the industry. We offer places based on random selection, but are aware that not everyone can afford to take two weeks to gain unpaid work experience. By paying work experience, we hope that this opportunity will be open to even more people.\n\nPrior to joining, we ask all employees if there’s any adjustments they’ll need when they start. We’re members of the Business Disability Forum, and have access to support through Unum, occupational health, Employee Assistance Programme, and other specialist providers.\n\nWe can consider a broad range of adjustments, including physical adjustments (like furniture, equipment, or software) or non-physical adjustments (like altered work hours, communication preferences or more one-to-ones).\n\nYou might not know what barriers you face until you get to the office – that’s fine too. You can discuss the request with your manager at any time. We also use a tool called the Tailored Adjustment Plan, which can help structure a conversation with your manager about these adjustments.\n\nWe also have a brilliant internal network, AccessAbility, for those who identify as disabled, neurodiverse, or chronically ill, or who are currently coming to terms with a related identifier.\n\nIf you have any questions or want to ask about adjustments or alternative formats, you can contact us at [email protected] . Remember, you only need to share what you are comfortable to for us to support your adjustment request.\n\nOur mission to ‘make books for everyone because a book can change anyone’ is really important to us – and we know that to deliver this we need a range of perspectives. In some of our roles you may need to work closely with our products and be an avid reader, in others this will be less important. It really depends on what you’ll be doing with us! Your application answers will help us match you to a team that is right for you.\n\nYou don’t need to have ever worked in publishing or have any experience to apply to our paid work experience- they are completely open to all.\n\nWe removed our degree requirements in 2016 and you don’t need to be studying or have studied at university to be eligible. You will have to have Right to work within the UK for the two weeks you are on the programme.\n\nYes, you will need an NI number.\n\nIf you’re from the UK, you should automatically have received an NI number just before you turned 16. If you didn’t get one and you’re under 20, phone the National Insurance numbers helpline. If you’re over 20, you need to apply for a National Insurance number.\n\nYou should be able to find your NI number on your payslip, P60, or letters about tax, pensions and benefits. If you have a personal tax account you can also view it there and print a confirmation letter.\n\nIf you’re still unable to find it or are from outside of the UK, you can apply for one here – https://www.gov.uk/lost-national-insurance-number\n\nWork experience is a learning opportunity. It’s a chance to dip your toe into publishing and see what the working world is like. You’ll be shadowing the department and have the chance to try out a few tasks.\n\nEven though you’ll be paid, work experience isn’t a job – there’s no employment contract or selection process like a CV or interview. We offer places via random selection to ensure the opportunity is open to all.\n\nFor a job, internship or temp role, there will be some form of selection involving a combination of: CV and cover letter, competency questions via Applied, video interview with Hirevue, and/or an interview. There’ll also be a contract and a level of responsibility not expected for those on work experience.\n\nPayment for your placement is based on the number of hours it lasts. The amount you’re paid will therefore depend on the length of your placement. If for any reason your placement is less than the usual 2 weeks, the pay you receive will reflect this.\n\nIf you cannot complete the full placement, please let us know as soon as possible. Preferably on the Tuesday before you’re paid, as this will allow us to make the change. If we find out after then you’ll be paid too much and we will be in contact with you to arrange repayment.\n\nA P45 shows how much tax you’ve paid on your salary so far in the tax year, and will be given to you by your last employer. For those who don’t have a previous employer or who are currently working, you’ll have to complete a New Starter Checklist which we can provide for you.\n\nWe need you to provide us with this a week before your placement starts."
