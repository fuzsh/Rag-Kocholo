We partner with Bloomsbury Press on a book series, entitled Electronic Literature and publish open source anthologies of electronic literature called the Electronic Literature Collection, an open source knowledge base called the Electronic Literature Directory, and books and reports, including State of the Arts (2003), Acid-Free Bits (2004), Born-Again Bits (2005), Toward a Semantic Literary Web (2007), and Electronic Literature: What Is It? (2007). We oversee digital archives of prominent digital communities, Turbulence.org (US) and the trAce Online Writing Centre (UK) through the ELO’s Electronic Literature Archives project."
