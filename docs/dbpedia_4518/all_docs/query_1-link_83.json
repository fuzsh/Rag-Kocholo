        "text": "Problem Description\n\nIn the given problem, we have an array called bits, which consists of only the numbers 0 and 1 representing bits. These bits form characters according to certain rules. A single bit of 0 represents one character (one-bit character), and a sequence of two bits that are either 10 or 11 represents another character (two-bit character). The array ends with a 0, which might be a part of the last two-bit character or stand alone as a one-bit character. Our task is to determine if this final 0 is definitely the one-bit character, not part of a two-bit character, by returning true if it is, or false if it's not.\n\nIntuition\n\nTo solve this problem, we can iterate through the bits array and track what kind of character we're currently on. Since only a 1 can indicate the beginning of a two-bit character, each time we encounter a 1, we know the next bit belongs to the same character. Therefore, we can increment our position in the array by 2 in this case. If it's a 0, it must represent a one-bit character, so we only increment our position by 1.\n\nThe trick of the solution is to notice that weâ€™ll never need to skip over the final 0 bit, because it's given that the array ends with a 0. We iterate through the array until we reach the penultimate bit. If our final position falls exactly on the penultimate bit, it means that the last bit is a one-bit character as it's impossible for it to be consumed as part of a two-bit character.\n\nFrom this intuition, the solution emerges as a simple loop that controls the index based on the current bit value.\n\nTime and Space Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of the provided function isOneBitCharacter is O(n), where n is the length of the input list bits. This is because the function uses a while loop that iterates through the bits, incrementing the index i by either 1 or 2 each time based on the value of the current bit. In the worst-case scenario, each bit is a 0, and the loop iterates n times. In the best case, with alternating 1s and 0s, the function could potentially iterate n/2 times. However, since we only consider the upper bound, the loop is linear in nature with respect to the input size.\n\nThe space complexity of the function is O(1). This is because there are a fixed number of variables (i, n) that do not depend on the size of the input, and no additional data structures are used that would increase the amount of memory used as the input size increases.\n\nLearn more about how to find time and space complexity quickly using problem constraints."
