        "text": "There are many differences between British and American punctuation, spelling, and grammar. Neither version is more correct than the other; which version you should use just depends on who your primary audience is. Here are some of the most common differences between British and American academic English.\n\nPunctuation\n\nSingle vs. Double Quotation Marks\n\nBritish English uses single quotation marks to indicate quotations or dialogue.\n\nThe UWSC says, 'This is how British people do it.'\n\nWhen there is a quotation inside the quotation, British English uses double quotation marks for the nested quotation.\n\nThe UWSC says, 'This is how British people, as they say, \"do it\".'\n\nAmerican English flips that method, and uses double quotation marks to indicate quotations or dialogue, and single quotation marks for nested quotations.\n\nThe UWSC says, \"This is how American people, as they say, 'do it.'\"\n\nCommas and Periods Within Quotation Marks\n\nBritish English puts commas and periods (full stops) outside the quotation marks unless the quotation is also a complete sentence or the punctuation is part of the quotation.\n\nThe UWSC says that British people write it \"this way\".\n\nAmerican English puts commas and periods inside the quotation marks.\n\nThe UWSC says that American people write it \"this way.\"\n\nWhen it comes to other punctuation, both versions write it similarly. Colons and semicolons go outside quotation marks, and exclamation points and question marks depend on whether they're part of the quote or the sentence as a whole.\n\nDates\n\nBritish English writes dates in DD/MM/YY format.\n\n10/1/2019 means January 10, 2019.\n\nAmerican English writes dates in MM/DD/YY format.\n\n10/1/2019 means October 1, 2019.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nBritish English typically does not put a period after an abbreviation.\n\nDr, Mr, Mrs, Ms, and vs are all written without periods after them.\n\nAmerican English puts periods after abbreviations.\n\nDr., Mr., Mrs., Ms., and vs. all have periods after them.\n\nSpelling\n\nThere are certain patterns of words that British and American English tend to spell differently.\n\nGrammar\n\nCollective Nouns\n\nCollective nouns are singular nouns that refer to a group of people, like \"group\" or \"team.\"\n\nBritish English tends to default to using the plural verb forms for collective nouns.\n\nUNR's faculty are here to help you.\n\nAmerican English uses the singular verb form for collective nouns.\n\nUNR's faculty is here to help you.\n\nPast Tense Forms\n\nBritish and American English have some differences in how they might spell the past tense\n\nforms of some verbs.\n\nBritish English might use '-t' to end the past tense forms of verbs ending in 'l,' 'm,' or 'n.'\n\nBurnt, dreamt, learnt, spilt, spoilt\n\nAmerican English will use '-ed' for the past tense of pretty much all regular verbs.\n\nBurned, dreamed, learned, spilled, spoiled\n\nThere are other differences between British and American English, but these are some of the\n\ncommon ones that come up in academic writing.\n\nOxford International Education Group.
