Two-bit is an American term that has its roots in the days when the country was still only English colonies. We will examine the meaning of the term two-bit, where it came from and some examples of its use in sentences.

Two-bit is an adjective that describes something inferior, something cheap, something sub par. The term is derived from the noun two-bits, which is a monetary figure. In America, two-bits is slang for twenty-five cents, each “bit” being equal to twelve and a half cents. These “bits” are only referred to in terms of twos, such as two bits, four bits or six bits. The use of the term bit dates back to the 1700s when Spanish and Mexican coins circulated in the English colonies. These coins were the Spanish silver reales, eight of which made up the Spanish dollar which is also known as a piece of eight. Interestingly, America’s history concerning the Spanish dollar lives on in the fossil word, two-bit. Note that the term is hyphenated, two-bit is a closed compound word.
