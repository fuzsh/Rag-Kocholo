There's a book, Two-Bit Culture, but I can't find what it's about.

I'm actually looking for a phrase to mean "worthless culture," something that didn't take years and effort and interest to build, but was made up from quick references gathered from the Internet, and so forth.

In Romanian we have this "2-coin [something]" phrase which says the above.

Are there any similar phrases in English? Also, what would be some other phrases which would mean "this person possesses worthless culture" (I know it doesn't sound right in English).

Thanks!

Once upon a time, Spanish dollars, the forerunner of American dollars, were cut into eight pieces. These pieces were called "bits"

Two bits = 25c.

Two-bit is a common US expression meaning cheap, insignificant, mediocre, inferior.

A two-bit thief, a two-bit cigar, a two-bit whore, two-bit culture.

You will occasionally see four-bit and six-bit in old texts.

There was a song years ago which mentioned a "four-bit room" = a room costing 50c.
