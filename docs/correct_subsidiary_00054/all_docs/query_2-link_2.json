        "text": "December 2023\n\nHow Providing Race and Ethnicity Data Helps All Customers\n\nWe are continuously working to better understand how Social Security’s programs serve the public. Collecting race and ethnicity data for research and statistical purposes is one way for us to determine whether we are equitably serving the public. Your clients may voluntarily provide this information. It does not affect decisions on benefit applications.\n\nWhy does it matter if your clients provide race and ethnicity data?\n\nWhen your clients choose to provide race and ethnicity information, it lets us know:\n\nWho our benefit payments and programs are helping and who may be left out.\n\nWhat unintended barriers may impact benefits and services.\n\nWhere to expand outreach efforts.\n\nHow to increase awareness of eligibility for programs and benefits.\n\nIn other words, race and ethnicity data can help expand access to our programs, which is one of the objectives in our Equity Action Plan at blog.ssa.gov/social-securitys-equity-action-plan. Examples of how we use this information can be found on our Racial Equity Resources webpage at www.ssa.gov/policy/about/racial-equity-resources.html.\n\nCurrently, we collect race and ethnicity information on applications for new or replacement Social Security number (SSN) cards. These applications can be completed:\n\nOnline at www.ssa.gov/number-card.\n\nAt one of our local offices or card centers.\n\nSoon, parents may voluntarily provide this information when requesting their newborn’s SSN at the hospital. The option to provide this data will be available in participating states.\n\nWe encourage your clients to provide their race and ethnicity information on their or their child’s application for a new or replacement SSN card. This information will help us better serve our current and future customers.\n\nPlease share this information with your clients.\n\n5 Things to Know When a Child with Disabilities Turns 18\n\nWhen a child turns 18 years old, they legally become an adult. This is an important time for your clients to consider their financial future – especially if they need additional care into adulthood. Here are 5 things that you need to know to prepare for this milestone:\n\nHealth and welfare decision-making.\n\nChanges in SSI eligibility.\n\nEducation transitions.\n\nSupports for living arrangements.\n\nFinancial protections.\n\nFor more details, please encourage your clients to check out our blog at blog.ssa.gov/5-things-to-know-when-your-child-with-disabilities-turns-18.\n\nVisit Social Security Online This Holiday Season\n\nThe holiday season may give some of us a break from daily routines and the time to rest and relax. We want your clients to know that our online services are available to help them do business with us in an easy, convenient, and secure way. This season, encourage your clients to sign up for a personal my Social Security account.\n\nA free and secure my Social Security account is your clients’ online gateway to our services. Creating an account allows your clients to:\n\nCheck their Social Security Statement.\n\nGet proof of benefits.\n\nGet proof that they do not receive benefits.\n\nVerify their reported earnings.\n\nEstimate their future benefits and much more!\n\nWe are committed to protecting your clients’ personal information and benefits. That’s why we work with two credential service providers, Login.gov and ID.me to securely verify their identity to create their personal my Social Security account. We do this to protect their information.\n\nWhen your clients create their personal my Social Security account, keep in mind:\n\nThey must be a U.S. citizen, at least 18 years old, and have a Social Security number (SSN).\n\nThey must provide a valid email address and some additional information.\n\nThey will be redirected to our credential service provider’s website when they select “Sign in with Login.gov” or “Sign in with ID.me.”\n\nIf they have a foreign mailing address, they must register and sign in with ID.me to access my Social Security.\n\nOnce they create the credential, they will return to the secure my Social Security webpage for next steps.\n\nPlease have your clients visit www.ssa.gov/myaccount to see all they can do with a personal my Social Security account. We wish you and your clients a safe and happy holiday season.\n\nPlease share this information with your clients.\n\nSocial Security Cards Are Safer at Home\n\nScams to steal your clients’ personal information are at an all-time high. That’s why it remains critical that your clients safeguard important personal documents like their Social Security card.\n\nA Social Security card is not an identification document. In many situations, your clients only need to know their Social Security number (SSN). Please advise your clients that their physical card is not necessary for most business needs.\n\nDo your clients need evidence for work? There are several documents they can use instead of their card. These include:\n\nBirth Certificate.\n\nPermanent Resident Card or Alien Registration Receipt.\n\nEmployment Authorization Document.\n\nForm I-94 or Form I-94A.\n\nYour clients do not need to show their physical card to apply for certain benefits. Your clients can simply provide their SSN for benefits like:\n\nHousing.\n\nHealth insurance.\n\nFood assistance.\n\nYour clients should also know their physical card is not required as evidence for the Department of Motor Vehicles. The only state that requires a physical card is Pennsylvania. For all other states, other acceptable evidence includes:\n\nW-2 forms.\n\nForm SSA-1099.\n\nNon-SSA-1099 forms.\n\nPay stubs.\n\nKeeping their card at home reduces the risk of loss or theft – and helps your clients keep their information safe. To learn more about keeping their card and information safe, your clients can visit our Fraud Prevention and Reporting webpage at www.ssa.gov/fraud.\n\nHoliday Local Social Security Office Closings\n\nWe want you to know that our offices and phone lines will be closed to the public on December 25 and January 1. However, your clients can still access and use our automated telephone services or our online services every day during the holiday season.\n\nPlease visit www.ssa.gov/onlineservices for a list of our secure and convenient online services. A list of our automated telephone services is available on our Contact Social Security by Phone webpage at www.ssa.gov/agency/contact/phone.html.\n\nNovember 2023\n\nSSA Talks: Will Social Security Be There When I Retire?\n\nWill Social Security be there when I retire?\n\nThat’s the question we’re answering in the latest episode of our audio series, SSA Talks. Our Chief Actuary Steve Goss sheds light on our trust funds and how they relate to your clients’ future benefits.\n\nThe 12-minute episode includes a fact sheet and transcript. The fact sheet provides more information on the trust funds and how much protection our benefits offer.\n\nWe invite you and your clients to visit our SSA Talks page at www.ssa.gov/news/audio-series.html to listen and subscribe to receive alerts about future episodes! For more information and news about Social Security, please encourage your clients to check out our Communications Corner at www.ssa.gov/news.\n\nPlease share this episode with your clients.\n\nSocial Security Benefits Increase in 2024\n\nMore than 71 million Americans will see a 3.2% increase in their Social Security benefits and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments in 2024. On average, Social Security retirement benefits will increase by more than $50 per month starting in January.\n\nFederal benefit rates increase when the cost-of-living rises, as measured by the Department of Labor’s Consumer Price Index (CPI-W). The CPI-W rises when inflation increases, leading to a higher cost-of-living. This change means prices for goods and services, on average, are higher. The cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) helps to offset these costs.\n\nWe will mail COLA notices throughout the month of December to retirement, survivors, and disability beneficiaries, SSI recipients, and representative payees. But if your clients want to know their new benefit amount sooner, they can securely obtain their Social Security COLA notice online using the Message Center in their personal my Social Security account at www.ssa.gov/myaccount. Your clients can access this information in early December, prior to receiving the mailed notice. Benefit amounts will not be available before December. Since your clients will receive the COLA notice online or in the mail, they don’t need to contact us to get their new benefit amount.\n\nIf your clients prefer to access their COLA notice online and not receive the mailed notice, they can log in to their personal my Social Security account at www.ssa.gov/myaccount to opt out by changing their preferences in the Message Center. Your clients can update their preferences to opt out of the mailed COLA notice, and any other notices that are available online. Do your clients know they can receive a text or email alert when there is a new message waiting for them? That way, they always know when we have something important for them – like their COLA notice. If your clients don’t have an account yet, they must create one by November 14, 2023, to receive the 2024 COLA notice online.\n\n“Social Security and SSI benefits will increase in 2024, and this will help millions of people keep up with expenses,” said Kilolo Kijakazi, Acting Commissioner of Social Security.\n\nJanuary 2024 marks when other changes will happen based on the increase in the national average wage index. For example, the maximum amount of earnings subject to Social Security payroll tax in 2024 will be higher. The retirement earnings test exempt amount will also change in 2024. Learn more at www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/colafacts2024.pdf.\n\nHelp your clients be among the first to know! Encourage them to sign up for or log in to their personal my Social Security account today at www.ssa.gov/myaccount. They can choose email or text under “Message Center Preferences” to receive courtesy notifications.\n\nYour clients can find more information about the 2024 COLA at www.ssa.gov/cola. Please share this information with your clients.\n\nProtecting Your Clients’ Retirement Money\n\nAs we approach the holiday season, we have a great opportunity to educate your clients on how to avoid scams. This is particularly important for those planning their retirement to learn how to protect their hard-earned retirement money against scams and fraud.\n\nWe recently shared a guest post from the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Office of Investor Education and Advocacy. The article shared the SEC’s top online resources – along with helpful tips and links to help your clients protect themselves against scams and fraud.\n\nPlease share our blog post with your clients at blog.ssa.gov/protecting-your-retirement-money.\n\nSocial Security is Thankful for the Opportunity to Serve You\n\nThanksgiving is a time to reflect on our blessings and share memories with loved ones. We are thankful that we can help your clients learn about Social Security programs to assist them with life’s journey.\n\nWe are more than a retirement program. Our services help many families across this country. We are there for joyous moments like the birth of a child and issuing their first Social Security card. We are also there during times of hardship and tragedy, to provide disability, spouse, and survivors benefits. And we’re there to help your clients celebrate retirement, too.\n\nWe are available to serve your clients online, by phone, and in person in our local offices. Learn more at blog.ssa.gov/celebrating-88-years-of-social-security.\n\nPlease share this information with your clients and others you care about who need help.\n\nPrioritizing Mental Health for Our Veterans\n\nMental health is a critical aspect of overall well-being. Mental health issues can significantly impact a person’s quality of life by making it difficult to work, maintain relationships, and enjoy activities that they love. For our nation’s veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and other conditions, these effects can be even more pronounced.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) reports that approximately 20% of veterans who served in Iraq or Afghanistan experience PTSD or depression. Unfortunately, many veterans don’t seek help due to the perceived stigma surrounding mental health issues. They may worry that they’ll be seen as weak or that their military careers could be negatively affected. This often leads to veterans suffering in silence.\n\nOur benefits and services continue to help our nation’s veterans through tough times. If your clients’ mental health challenges are so severe that they’re unable to work, they may qualify for disability benefits.\n\nYour clients can learn more on our Disability Benefits page at www.ssa.gov/benefits/disability along with our blog at blog.ssa.gov/prioritizing-mental-health-for-our-veterans.\n\nPlease share this important information with your clients.\n\nOctober 2023\n\nSave Your Place in Line with Mobile Check-In Express!\n\nOur Mobile Check-In Express feature makes it easier for your clients to check in if they must visit an office.\n\nTo use Mobile Check-In Express, your clients can scan the QR code located at the local Social Security office they’re visiting. This will allow your clients to check in for:\n\nScheduled and non-scheduled appointments.\n\nServices—including requesting a replacement Social Security card, a benefit verification letter, proof of income, and more.\n\nFor Mobile Check-In Express to work, they must be at the Social Security office and have their mobile location services on. They should also make sure they’re using the latest version of their internet browser. The service is most compatible with Safari, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Firefox. Your clients will also want to:\n\nEnsure they are in the Social Security office when their ticket number is called.\n\nEnable their mobile notifications. This will:\n\nAllow them to receive their electronic ticket – so they’ll know their place in line.\n\nAlert them when we’re ready to help them.\n\nProvide them with their interview location information.\n\nInvite them to participate in our feedback survey.\n\nWe encourage your clients to use Mobile Check-In Express for any office visits.\n\nPlease share this information with your clients.\n\nSave The Date: October National Disability Forum\n\nWe will host the next virtual National Disability Forum (NDF) on Wednesday, October 18, 2023. The title is “Youth Transitioning to Adulthood and Preparing for an Age-18 Redetermination.” The event will take place using Microsoft Teams from 1:00 p.m. – 3:00 p.m. ET.\n\nFor more information about the NDF, we encourage you and your clients to visit our Advocates page at www.ssa.gov/news/advocates.html . You and your clients can email questions to OEA.Net.Post@ssa.gov.\n\nCelebrating 50 Years of the Rehabilitation Act\n\nThis year, we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. This law prohibits disability-related discrimination in programs that are run by federal agencies or receive federal funding. It also protects federal employees and contractors from discrimination.\n\nSection 503 of the Rehabilitation Act requires that federal contractors and subcontractors take affirmative action to recruit, hire, employ, promote, and retain qualified people with disabilities.\n\nSection 503 and Social Security’s Ticket to Work Program\n\nSection 503 provides job opportunities for qualified people with disabilities. Our Ticket to Work (Ticket) Program can help connect your clients with jobs.\n\nThe Ticket Program supports career development for people ages 18 through 64 who receive Social Security disability benefits or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and want to work. Through this free and voluntary program, participants can work with service providers to receive the supports and services they need to find and maintain employment. This allows them to move toward financial independence through work.\n\nOrganizations that provide employment-related services, like State Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) agencies and American Job Centers (AJCs) can help your clients find federal contractors and subcontractors. If they’re eligible for the Ticket Program, an Employment Network (EN) may also help.\n\nMany federal contractors and subcontractors look to State VR agencies, AJCs, and ENs to find qualified candidates with disabilities to fill open positions.\n\nTo learn more about the Ticket Program, your clients can visit www.choosework.ssa.gov or call the Ticket to Work Help Line at 1-866-968-7842 or 1-866-833-2967 (TTY), Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET. They can ask for a list of service providers or find providers on their own using the Ticket Program Find Help Tool found at www.choosework.ssa.gov/findhelp.\n\nYour clients can also learn more by registering for a free, online event at www.choosework.ssa.gov/wise or text TICKET to 474747 to receive Ticket Program texts. Standard messaging rates may apply, and they can opt out at any time.\n\nPlease share this information with your clients.\n\nNational Savings Day Reminds Us to Plan for the Future\n\nNational Savings Day is October 12. The day serves as an important reminder for your clients to plan for their financial future.\n\nSocial Security is a vital part of any financial plan. We have online tools to help your clients understand their potential Social Security benefits and how they fit into their financial future.\n\nYour clients should periodically review their Social Security Statement (Statement) using their personal my Social Security account at www.ssa.gov/myaccount. The Statement is an easy-to-read summary of the estimated benefits your clients and their families could receive, including potential retirement, disability, and survivors benefits.\n\nOur Plan for Retirement tool in your clients’ personal my Social Security account allows them to check various benefit estimate scenarios. Your clients can compare the effect different future earnings and retirement benefit start dates have on their future benefit amount.\n\nPlease let your clients know they can take steps to improve their financial knowledge by signing in to their personal my Social Security account.

These tools are the Benefits Screener and the Card Replacement Screener. The Benefit Screener helps your clients determine their eligibility for benefits and the Card Replacement Screener helps them request a replacement Social Security card. Let’s go over how your clients can use these tools.\n\nBenefits Screener\n\nYou can access the Benefits Screener tool at www.ssa.gov/prepare/check-eligibility-for-benefits to determine which benefits your clients may be eligible for, typically in 10 minutes or less! Whether they’re considering retirement, disability, survivor, or other types of benefits, this tool will guide them in the right direction.\n\nTo use the screener, your clients can select the “Start” button and answer a few questions about what’s going on in their life. Your clients will immediately get a response that tells them which benefits they may be eligible for based on their answers.\n\nCard Replacement Screener\n\nYour clients can access the Card Replacement Screener at www.ssa.gov/number-card/replace-card. Requesting a replacement Social Security card is free. In most situations, your clients do not need to present a physical card – just knowing their Social Security number is usually enough. But, if your clients need a physical Social Security card, they can use this screener to determine the best way to replace it.\n\nDepending on their situation, your clients may be able to request a replacement Social Security card without visiting a local office. If your clients can’t complete the process online and have to visit an office, they can save time by starting with the online application.\n\nSSA.gov continues to be a safe and secure way to conduct business with us online. The redesigned website—with its online tools—is the quickest, easiest, and most convenient way to begin.\n\nPlease share this information with your clients.\n\nCelebrating 88 Years of Social Security\n\nFor 88 years, Social Security has provided income protection to millions of retirees, people with disabilities, dependents, and families that lose a wage earner. This year, we will administer more than $1.3 trillion in benefits and payments to more than 70 million beneficiaries and cover 181 million workers and their families. In addition to paying benefits, we issue millions of Social Security numbers each year, maintain the wage records of workers, and more. The scope of what we do is enormous, and we are proud to serve the American people every day.\n\nTo better serve your clients, we have prioritized our online customer experience. Our website, SSA.gov, makes it easier for your clients to find what they need. More than 180 million people visit our website every year. Whether providing service in person or online, our goal is to help people understand what they may qualify for and transition them to an application process.\n\nYou and your clients can learn more on our blog at blog.ssa.gov/celebrating-88-years-of-social-security/ Please share this information with your clients.\n\nSocial Security Services for the Hispanic Community\n\nSocial Security strives to deliver great customer service and helpful information to everyone, including people who are more comfortable reading and speaking Spanish.\n\nOur Spanish-language website, www.segurosocial.gov, provides information about our programs and services.

People living with dementia are at an especially high risk of becoming victims. That’s why we’re committed to combatting fraud.\n\nAs their memory and other thinking skills decline, people with dementia may struggle to make financial decisions. They may not remember or report the abuse – or understand that someone is taking advantage of them. This abuse can occur anywhere – including at home or in care settings.\n\nVictims of fraud who are 80 years and older lose an average of $39,200 every year. Studies show that financial exploitation is the most common form of elder abuse. However, only a small fraction of these incidents are reported.\n\nYour clients can learn to recognize common signs of financial exploitation and abuse, including:\n\nUnopened bills.\n\nUnusual or large purchases.\n\nUtilities being shut off due to unpaid bills.\n\nMoney given to telemarketers or soliciting companies.\n\nUnexplained withdrawals from the person’s bank account.\n\nThere are also many simple things that caregivers can do to reduce the risk of financial abuse for people with dementia and similar conditions, like Alzheimer’s. Your clients can learn more by visiting our blog at blog.ssa.gov/minimizing-the-risk-of-scams-for-people-living-with-dementia.\n\nPlease share this information with your clients.\n\nDisability: Part of the Equity Equation\n\nPeople with disabilities play an important role in a diverse and inclusive workforce. We would like to tell your clients about Amy and her path to financial independence through work.\n\nMeet Amy\n\nAmy has a developmental disability that affects her speech, learning, and social interactions. When she was ready to find a path to financial independence through work, Amy turned to her State Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) agency for help. Amy’s VR counselor told her about Social Security’s Ticket to Work (Ticket) Program.\n\nThe Ticket Program supports career development for people with disabilities who want to work. Adults ages 18 through 64 who receive Social Security disability benefits or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) qualify for this free and voluntary program. Through the Ticket Program, service providers offer free employment support services.\n\nAmy had questions about how employment could affect her benefits. Her State VR counselor connected her with Full Circle Employment Solutions. Full Circle is an Employment Network with benefits counselors on staff who explained how working might affect her disability benefits.\n\nYour clients can read the rest of Amy’s story on our blog at blog.ssa.gov/disability-part-of-the-equity-equation. Please share this information with your clients.\n\nAugust 2023\n\nStates are Restarting Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program Renewals\n\nFor the past three years, people on Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) were not required to renew their coverage due to the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency. This exception was referred to as the ‘continuous enrollment condition’.\n\nThe continuous enrollment condition ended, so states have resumed eligibility reviews. To avoid a gap in coverage, people who have Medicaid or CHIP need to take action to renew their coverage.\n\nMake sure their state has their current mailing address, phone number, email, or other contact information.\n\nCheck the mail for a letter about their Medicaid or CHIP coverage.\n\nIf received, complete and return the renewal form to their state right away to help avoid a gap in coverage.\n\nVisit Medicaid.gov/renewals for more information or their state Medicaid office for help or to update their contact information.\n\nWe ask that you share this information with your clients to help raise awareness about renewing coverage.\n\nAre Your Clients Age 70 or Older and Not Yet Getting Social Security Retirement Benefits?\n\nRetirement is not one-size-fits-all. It can mean different things to different people. Perhaps your clients have not applied for Social Security retirement benefits because they're still working or are delaying applying so they can get the higher benefit. If your clients are age 70 or older, they should apply now for the benefits they’re owed. Your clients’ benefits will not increase if they continue to delay applying for them because they are 70 or older.\n\nDid you know that your clients can receive benefits even if they still work? For more information, they can check out our blog article at Are You Age 70 or Older and Not Yet Getting Your Social Security Retirement Benefits? (ssa.gov).\n\nPlease share this information with your clients.\n\nIf Your Clients Fall Victim to a Scam\n\nIf your client is a victim of a scam, they should never feel embarrassed. Anyone can become a victim of fraud. The important thing is to report the scam immediately. Advise your clients to:\n\nStop communications with the scammer.\n\nNotify financial institutions and protect their accounts.\n\nContact local law enforcement and file a police report.\n\nFile a complaint with the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) at www.ic3.gov and on the FTC website at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.\n\nReport Social Security-related scams to our Office of the Inspector General at oig.ssa.gov.\n\nRetain financial transaction information and records of all communications with the scammer.\n\nPlease share this information with your clients so they can help their friends, family, and community.\n\nFive Benefits You Can Apply for Using SSA.gov\n\nWe continue to make it easier for your clients to access our programs and benefits. Our website offers convenient ways to apply for benefits online.\n\nHere are 5 ways your clients can apply for benefits using ssa.gov.\n\nRetirement or Spouse's Benefits – If your client is at least 61 years and 9 months and wants their benefits to start in no more than 4 months, they can apply at www.ssa.gov/retirement.\n\nDisability Benefits – Your clients can use our online application, at www.ssa.gov/benefits/disability/, to apply for disability benefits if they:\n\nAre age 18 or older.\n\nAre not currently receiving benefits on their own Social Security record.\n\nAre unable to work because of a medical condition that is expected to last at least 12 months or result in death.\n\nHave not been denied disability benefits in the last 60 days.

SSI payments are also made to people age 65 and older without disabilities who meet the financial qualifications. If your clients meet certain requirements, they may begin the process online by letting us know they would like to apply for SSI at www.ssa.gov/ssi. If your client does not have access to the internet, they can call their local Social Security office to make an appointment to apply.\n\nMedicare – Medicare is a federal health insurance program for people aged 65 or older, some people younger than 65 who have disabilities, and people with end-stage renal disease or Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). If your client is not already receiving Social Security benefits, they should apply for Medicare 3 months before turning age 65 at www.ssa.gov/medicare.\n\nExtra Help with Medicare Prescription Drug Costs – Clients who need assistance with the cost of medications can apply for Extra Help at www.ssa.gov/medicare/part-d-extra-help.

Be sure to tell your clients about all they can do with us online at www.ssa.gov.\n\nRepresentative Payees Help Your Clients Manage Their Benefits\n\nSome people who receive monthly Social Security benefits or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments may need help managing their money. When we receive information that indicates your client needs help, we’ll work with them to find the most suitable representative payee to manage their benefits. A representative payee is someone who receives monthly benefit payment on behalf of anyone who can’t manage their benefits and must use the money to pay for their current needs. These include:\n\nFood.\n\nClothing.\n\nHousing and utilities.\n\nPersonal care items.\n\nMedical and dental expenses.\n\nRehabilitation expenses (if they have a disability).\n\nThe representative payee should be someone your client trusts, sees often, and who clearly understands their needs. Social service agencies, nursing homes, or other organizations are also qualified to be a representative payee.\n\nYou and your clients can find more information at www.ssa.gov/payee.\n\nFour Questions That Can Help Your Clients Plan for Retirement\n\nSocial Security benefits are part of the retirement plan of almost every American worker. If your client is among the many people covered under Social Security, they should know what their future benefit may be. These monthly payments will likely be an important part of their retirement income.\n\nOur retirement page at www.ssa.gov/retirement is a great place for your client to start mapping out a retirement plan. For example, has your client considered:\n\nWhen is the right time to start receiving retirement benefits?\n\nWhat documents they need to provide us for their retirement application?\n\nWhich factors may affect their retirement benefits?\n\nWhat they need to do after they apply for retirement benefits?\n\nYour client can use their personal my Social Security account at www.ssa.gov/myaccount to get an instant estimate of their future retirement benefits. They can also see the effects of starting retirement benefits at different ages.\n\nYour client may also be wondering about:\n\nBenefits for a spouse or children.\n\nHow work affects their benefits.\n\nMedicare.\n\nWhether they will have to pay taxes on their benefits.\n\nYour clients can learn more at www.ssa.gov/retirement. Please share this information with your clients to help them prepare for retirement.\n\nJuly 2023\n\nCelebrate Your Independence with Social Security\n\nEvery July, we take pride in celebrating our nation’s independence.

We provide products and services to help improve the lives of people with disabilities. Here are 5 ways we support the ADA:\n\nFinancial and Medical Benefits to People with Disabilities\n\nSocial Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) helps people with disabilities meet their basic needs and sustain a higher quality of life. We pay disability benefits to people who cannot work because they have a medical condition that is expected to last at least one year or result in death. Your clients can learn more at www.ssa.gov/benefits/disability. They can also check out our Faces and Facts of Disability webpage at www.ssa.gov/disabilityfacts which highlights the stories of people with disabilities and receiving benefits.\n\nCash assistance to People with Disabilities who have Limited Income\n\nThe Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program provides monthly payments to adults and children with a disability or blindness who have income and resources below specific financial limits. We also provide SSI payments to people who are at least 65 years old, without disability, and meet the financial qualifications. Your clients can learn more at www.ssa.gov/ssi.\n\nSupport for Children with Developmental and Behavioral Disabilities\n\nSSI provides financial support to families with children who have developmental and behavioral disabilities. Children under age 18 can get SSI if they meet our definition of disability and live in a household with limited income and resources. Your clients can learn more about SSI eligibility for children and how to apply for SSI at www.ssa.gov/benefits/disability/apply-child.html.\n\nHelping People with Disabilities Progress Toward Financial Independence\n\nOur Ticket to Work (Ticket) Program supports career development for people ages 18 to 64 who receive disability benefits and want to work. Our Ticket Program is a free and voluntary program with approved service providers who offer support and services to participants. Encourage your clients to check out our Ticket page at www.ssa.gov/work.\n\nAchieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Accounts\n\nWe look to build upon the promise of the ADA. That includes equal opportunity and full participation for people living with disabilities. ABLE accounts help bridge the gap by allowing eligible beneficiaries to save and become economically self-sufficient. For SSI determinations, we do not count up to $100,000 in an ABLE account. We invite your clients to learn more about how ABLE accounts can help on our blog at blog.ssa.gov/able-accounts-building-upon-the-promise-of-the-americans-with-disabilities-act.\n\nWe’re here to help your clients secure today and tomorrow.

We are committed to reducing barriers to ensure people eligible for our benefits receive them. We provide income security for the diverse populations we serve. This includes people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their families.\n\nMany parents and caretakers of children with disabilities lose work hours and income because of their children’s care needs. Supplemental Security Income (SSI) provides monthly financial support to low-income families with children who have developmental and behavioral disabilities. These include ASD – and physical impairments.\n\nChildren under age 18 can get SSI if they meet our definition of disability for children and live in a household with limited income and resources. We define a disability as:\n\nThe child must have a physical or mental condition(s) that very seriously limits the child’s activities.\n\nThe condition(s) must have lasted, or be expected to last, at least 1 year or result in death.\n\nYou can learn more about SSI eligibility for children and how to apply for SSI on our website at www.ssa.gov/benefits/disability/apply-child.html.\n\nWe also serve people with ASD who want to enter the workforce. Your clients may have questions about how ASD affects their employment options. They may also see their ASD as a barrier to employment. Employers have started to recognize that many people with ASD can bring a variety of skills and strengths to the workplace. We encourage your clients to learn more about our Ticket to Work program at choosework.ssa.gov.\n\nWe recognize the need to support, understand, accept, include, and empower those on the autism spectrum. Please share this information with your clients.\n\nSocial Security Administration Expands Outreach and Access for Supplemental Security Income\n\nSocial Security has expanded its outreach to people in critical need of financial help who may be eligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI). SSI provides monthly payments to adults age 65 and older or to other adults – and children – with a disability or blindness who have limited income and financial resources. SSI helps pay for basic needs like rent, food, clothing, and medicine.\n\nWe identified underserved communities in rural and urban areas across the country. We focused on areas with the greatest decline in SSI applications since the pandemic. Our outreach efforts targeted areas where the majority of people are living at or below the federal poverty threshold.\n\nYour clients who receive SSI may qualify for other financial help, including SNAP benefits (formerly known as food stamps), Medicaid, and discounted internet service through the Affordable Connectivity Program. Social Security beneficiaries may also be eligible for SSI.\n\nYour clients with limited income and financial resources should visit www.ssa.gov/ssi to learn more about SSI eligibility and request an appointment to apply. People without access to the internet can call our National 800 Number at 1-800-772-1213 to speak with a representative.\n\nWe encourage your clients to check our blog at blog.ssa.gov/social-security-administration-expands-outreach-and-access-for-supplemental-security-income to learn more.\n\nPlease share this information with your clients to spread the word about SSI.\n\nJune 2023\n\nHow We Serve Your Clients Who Have Limited English Proficiency\n\nWe strive to deliver great customer service and helpful information to everyone.

World Elder Abuse Awareness Day reminds us about the importance of staying in touch with older persons.\n\nElder abuse is the intentional mistreatment or harming of an older person. An older person is defined by the Social Security Act as someone over age 60. This abuse takes many forms – including physical and emotional abuse, neglect, sexual harm, and financial exploitation. More than 1 in 10 older adults experience some form of abuse each year. That number is likely much higher because elder abuse is often underreported – especially in underserved communities.\n\nAbuse victims typically show emotional and behavioral red flags, such as depression, unusual fear or anxiety, or intentional isolation. Many victims are abused by someone they know or trust. It’s important to look for unusual changes in behavior around:\n\nFamily members.\n\nStaff at inpatient facilities.\n\nHired or volunteer caregivers.\n\nPeople in positions of trust like doctors or financial advisors.\n\nYou can also help make a difference by checking in with older loved ones. Looking for warning signs of mistreatment is the first step to preventing abuse. Signs of physical abuse include bruises, burns, or other unexplained injuries.\n\nThere may also be signs of neglect like:\n\nPoor nutrition or hygiene.\n\nLack of necessary medical aids like glasses or medications that a caretaker should be providing.\n\nThere may also be indications of financial abuse. These may include:\n\nUnpaid rent.\n\nSudden changes to a will.\n\nUnusual changes in money management.\n\nLarge or unexplained financial transactions.\n\nMortgages despite sufficient financial resources.\n\nAllowing someone new to access bank accounts.\n\nIf you suspect that someone is a victim of elder abuse, don't ignore it! If you or someone you care about is in a life-threating situation, call 911. If you suspect that something isn't right – but nobody seems to be in immediate danger – contact:\n\nYour local Adult Protective Services.\n\nThe National Center on Elder Abuse at 1-855-500-3537 (ELDR).\n\nYou can also find additional local resources by searching the Eldercare Locator for your community.\n\nThis World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, take some time to call or visit with an older adult. Ask if they are okay and listen to what they tell you. Pay attention to signs of abuse or unusual behavior. Most of all, don’t be afraid to report instances of suspected abuse. Everyone deserves to be safe, regardless of age, and help is available.\n\nPlease share this information with your family and friends – and share it on social media.\n\nFraudsters Never Go on Vacation\n\nAlthough your clients may be enjoying the summer sun and fun, they should keep in mind that fraudsters don’t go on vacation.

Social Security Can Tell Them\n\nHave your clients ever wondered how much they earned during the year that they worked their first job? Or any other year they worked? They can find out by reviewing their Social Security earnings record.\n\nThe earnings record will show their income for each year worked and their progress toward future Social Security benefits. We keep track of their earnings so we can pay them the benefits they've earned over their lifetime. That's why it's important that they review their Social Security earnings record.\n\nIt's their employer's responsibility to provide accurate earnings information to us. However, they should still review their earnings history and inform us of any errors or omissions. We encourage your clients to learn more on our blog.\n\nPlease share this information with your clients.\n\nInternational Widows’ Day\n\nInternational Widows’ Day is recognized annually on June 23.

Families, friends, and communities pause to remember the many great sacrifices of our military and ensure their legacy lives on in the freedoms we all enjoy. We recognize these heroes who, in President Lincoln’s words, “gave the last full measure of devotion.”\n\nThe benefits we provide can help the families of deceased military service members, which may include your clients. For example, surviving spouses and their dependent children may be eligible for Social Security survivors benefits. Your clients can learn more about those benefits at www.ssa.gov/survivors.\n\nWe also offer support to our wounded warriors. Social Security benefits protect veterans when an injury prevents them from returning to active duty or performing other work. Wounded military service members can receive expedited processing of their Social Security disability claims. Do you have clients who are veterans with a 100% Permanent & Total compensation rating from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs? We will expedite their disability claim. Both the Department of Veteran Affairs and Social Security have disability programs. Your clients may qualify for disability benefits under one program but not the other, or they may qualify for both. Depending on your client’s situation, some of their family members, including dependent children or their spouse, may be eligible to receive Social Security benefits.\n\nWant more information?

The Trustees project the DI Trust Fund will not become depleted during the 75-year projection period.\n\nIn the 2023 Report to Congress, the Trustees also announced:\n\nThe asset reserves of the combined OASI and DI Trust Funds declined by $22 billion in 2022, to a total of $2.83 trillion.\n\nThe projected actuarial deficit over the 75-year long-range period is 3.61% of taxable payroll — higher than the 3.42% projected in last year’s report.\n\nThe full 2023 Trustees Report is available at www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR.\n\nUpdated COVID-19 Guidance on Masking\n\nEffective March 27, 2023, our mask requirements changed.

Social Security scams — where fraudsters pressure victims into making cash or gift card payments to fix alleged Social Security number problems or to avoid arrest – are an ongoing government imposter fraud scheme. For several years, Social Security impersonation scams have been one of the most common government imposter scams reported to the Federal Trade Commission. We’ve made concerted efforts to address this issue, through extensive outreach and investigative initiatives. These efforts have made a significant impact, reducing money reported lost to Social Security scams by 30 percent from 2021 to 2022.\n\n“I am proud of the work we have done to combat Social Security imposter scams and raise public awareness,” said Kilolo Kijakazi, Acting Commissioner of Social Security. “We will continue to use every tool at our disposal to protect the public and their critical benefits. We urge Americans to remain vigilant, do not give out personal information or money, and report any scam attempts.”\n\nScammers use sophisticated tactics to trick potential victims into disclosing personal and financial information. Typically, they use the five P’s – Pretend, Prize or Problem, Pressure, and Payment. For example, scammers pretend they are from Social Security in phone calls or emails and claim there is a problem with the person’s Social Security number. The scammer’s caller ID may be spoofed to look like a legitimate government number. Scammers may also send fake documents to pressure people into complying with demands for information or money. Other common tactics include citing “badge numbers” and using fraudulent Social Security letterhead to target individuals for payment or personal information.\n\nFor more information, your clients can read our press release at www.ssa.gov/news/press/releases/2023/#3-2023-1. They can also check out our Slam the Scam page at www.ssa.gov/scam.\n\nReady to Retire? Apply Online with Social Security\n\nIt’s never too early for your clients to start planning for retirement using our online tools. Encourage your clients to access their personal my Social Security account to get an estimate of their retirement benefits based on their earnings record. Once your clients have an account, they can use our Plan for Retirement tool, to see how their benefits can change at different ages. If your clients don’t have a personal my Social Security account, they can create one at www.ssa.gov/myaccount.\n\nYour clients can also use their personal my Social Security account to see their entire work history to be sure we have all their wages recorded correctly. We base their benefit amount on the earnings reported to us. If your clients find an error with their work history, refer them to this publication www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10081.pdf, to learn how they can correct their Social Security record.\n\nWhen your clients are ready to apply for Social Security retirement benefits, they can conveniently complete our online application in as little as 15 minutes at www.ssa.gov/retirement. We will contact your clients if we need any further information. Your clients can check the status of their application through their online account.\n\nYour clients can apply online for Social Security retirement benefits, or benefits as a spouse, if they:\n\nAre at least 61 years and nine months old.\n\nAre not currently receiving benefits on their own Social Security record.\n\nHave not already applied for retirement benefits.\n\nWant their benefits to start no later than four months in the future. (We cannot process their application if they apply for benefits more than four months in advance).\n\nFind more information about retirement benefits at www.ssa.gov/retirement.\n\nSave The Date – National Disability Forum\n\nWe will host the next virtual National Disability Forum (NDF) on Wednesday, April 19. The title is “Focusing on Aspects of Childhood Disability and Childhood SSI Part I.” You can participate using Microsoft Teams from 1:00 p.m. – 3:00 p.m. ET.\n\nFor more information about the NDF, we encourage you and your clients to visit our What’s New page at www.ssa.gov/thirdparty/groups/whatsnew.html. You and your clients can email questions to OEA.Net.Post@ssa.gov.\n\nHelp Your Clients Get Started Applying for SSI\n\nIf your clients want to apply for Supplemental Security Income (SSI), it’s best to start the process online at www.ssa.gov/ssi. The online process typically takes about five to ten minutes, and no documentation is required to start. We will need the following basic information about your client and, if applicable, the person they are helping:\n\nThe name, date of birth, Social Security number, mailing address, and phone number of the person interested in applying for SSI. We also offer the option to provide an email address.\n\nIf helping another person, we need the helper’s name and phone number. We also offer them the option to provide an email address.\n\nOnce your client completes this short process, we will schedule an appointment to help your client apply for SSI. We will send a confirmation with the appointment date and time by mail and email (if an email address is provided). In some cases, we may call your client to schedule the appointment.\n\nIf your client is unable to begin the process online, they may schedule an appointment by calling 1-800-772-1213 (TTY 1-800-325-0778) from 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. local time, Monday through Friday.

They can find the phone number for their local office at www.ssa.gov/locator.\n\nPlease share this information with your clients.\n\nMarch 2023\n\nHow We Protect Your Clients from Misleading Advertising and Communications\n\nWe work with our Office of the Inspector General (OIG) to protect your clients from scams that use Social Security as bait. Section 1140 of the Social Security Act allows OIG to impose severe penalties against anyone who engages in misleading Social Security-related advertising or imposter communications. Your clients can review Section 1140 at www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title11/1140.htm.\n\nFor example, the OIG may impose a penalty against anyone who:\n\nMails misleading solicitations that appear to be from or otherwise authorized by Social Security.\n\nOperates an imposter internet website or social media account designed to look as though it belongs to or is authorized by Social Security.\n\nSends emails or text messages or makes telephone calls claiming to be from Social Security.\n\nSells Social Security forms, applications, and publications without our written approval. All of these are available for free.\n\nCharges a fee for a service that we provide free of charge without providing a clearly visible notice that Social Security provides the service for free.\n\nIf your clients receive a misleading or suspicious Social Security-related advertisement or imposter communication, please let us know immediately. Your clients should try to capture as much information about the communication as they can. Here’s what your clients can do:\n\nFor suspicious websites or social media accounts, they can take a screenshot of the page. Have them note the website address or social media link – and how they came across it.\n\nFor emails and text messages, they can capture the entire message and any message links.\n\nFor U.S. mail solicitations, they can retain the complete communication, including the outside envelope and all inserts.\n\nFor telephone solicitations, they can note the caller identification phone number and any company name or call back number that the caller or recorded message provides.\n\nYour clients can help us stop misleading advertising and communications. We encourage them to report potential scams at oig.ssa.gov. Your clients can also call OIG’s fraud hotline at 1-800-269-0271 or send an email to OIG.1140@ssa.gov.\n\nThis information will help OIG locate the source of the suspicious solicitation or communication. Your clients can also check out our publication, What You Need to Know About Misleading Advertising, at www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10005.pdf.\n\nPlease share this information with your clients.\n\nYour Clients Can Plan for Their Future During Financial Literacy Month\n\nFinancial Literacy Month is focused on educating people about the importance of planning for a secure financial future. Every April, we like to remind the public that Social Security is a vital part of any financial plan. We have online tools to help your clients understand their potential Social Security benefits and how they fit into their financial future.\n\nYour clients should periodically review their Social Security Statement (Statement) using their personal my Social Security account at www.ssa.gov/myaccount. Your clients’ Statement is an easy-to-read summary of the estimated benefits they could receive, including potential retirement, disability, and survivors benefits.\n\nOur Plan for Retirement tool in your clients’ personal my Social Security account allows them to compare various benefit estimate scenarios. Your clients can compare the effect different future earnings and retirement benefit start dates have on their future benefit amount.\n\nPlease let your clients know they can take steps to improve their financial knowledge by exploring their personal my Social Security account. If they don’t have an account, they can easily create one at www.ssa.gov/myaccount.\n\nYour Clients Can Stay Informed with Social Security’s Top Five Social Media Pages\n\nWe strive to provide the public with accurate and helpful information.

This is an improvement over last year’s high scores of A+ and B.\n\n“An excellent model to follow is the Social Security Administration’s ‘Contact Us’ page, the only one to earn an A+,” the Center said in its key findings, “The web page is clear in its intended purpose to provide information readers seek,” the Center said. The page has clear and concise language and the reader is addressed directly,” it noted.\n\nThe Center also cited “excellent use of links, colors, fonts, sizing, bolding, bullets, and imagery to highlight important information.”\n\nIn addition, the Center recognized our Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Request page as an excellent model for other agencies. The 2022 Plain Language Report Card was released on January 10, 2023 at www.centerforplainlanguage.org/2022-federal-plain-language-report-card.\n\nTo learn more about Social Security’s plain language efforts, please visit our Plain Writing page at www.ssa.gov/agency/plain-language.\n\nSocial Security Celebrates Women’s History Month\n\nMarch is Women’s History Month. It is an opportunity to recognize and celebrate the achievements of women. Social Security provides vital benefits and financial protection for women.\n\nNearly 55% of the people receiving Social Security benefits are women. Today, more women work, pay Social Security taxes, and earn credit toward monthly retirement income than at any other time in our nation’s history.\n\nWomen also have longer average life expectancies than men and tend to live more years in retirement. This means women have a greater chance of exhausting other sources of income. It’s important for women to plan early and wisely for retirement.\n\nOur online booklet, Social Security: What Every Woman Should Know found at www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10127.pdf, provides detailed information about how life events can affect a woman’s Social Security retirement benefits. These events may include marriage, death of a spouse, divorce, self-employment, and other life or career changes.\n\nYour clients’ earnings history will determine future benefits, so we encourage them to verify that the information in their record is correct. Your clients can create a personal my Social Security account at www.ssa.gov/myaccount to review their full earnings history. They can also view their Social Security Statement using their personal my Social Security account, to get estimates of future benefits and other important planning information.\n\nIf your clients find an error in their earnings record, it is important to have it corrected so they receive the benefits they earned when they retire. Our publication, How to Correct Your Social Security Earnings Record at www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10081.pdf, provides details on how to make a correction.\n\nWe encourage your clients to learn about how Social Security benefits women at www.ssa.gov/people/women. Please share this information with your clients.\n\nFebruary 2023\n\nHelp Someone You Love Apply for Social Security and More\n\nSocial Security helps people in all stages of life.

This year’s theme is A Financially Confident You. Your clients can increase their financial confidence by building healthy saving habits and taking advantage of resources available to support their financial stability.\n\nAmerica Saves Week runs from February 27 through March 3. It’s a great opportunity for your clients to learn about good financial habits and assess their own saving status. It’s also a perfect time for them to create a plan, start saving, and begin their journey toward financial stability.\n\nPlanning and saving are key to a successful retirement. The earlier your clients start saving for retirement, the better off they will be in the future. People who have a plan are twice as likely to save effectively. We encourage your clients to pledge to save for America Saves Week at www.americasavesweek.org. Your clients can visit www.ssa.gov/retirement for useful information to help them plan for retirement.\n\nIt’s never too early to begin saving. Our webpage, www.ssa.gov/people/earlycareer, has resources that can help young workers secure their today and tomorrow. Please share our infographic, Anytime is the Right Time to Save for Your Future, that provides helpful information for your clients about saving at www.ssa.gov/benefits/assets/materials/retirement/EN-05-10549.pdf.\n\nThe sooner your clients start saving, the more their money can grow.\n\nSocial Security Launches Redesigned Website at SSA.gov\n\nDo your clients know about the redesigned SSA.gov? In December 2022, we updated our homepage with a new design to help your clients find what they need easily.\n\n“SSA.gov is visited by over 180 million people per year and it is one of our most important tools for providing efficient and equitable access to service,” said Kilolo Kijakazi, Acting Commissioner of the Social Security Administration, at the launch. “Whether providing service in person or online, our goal is to help people understand what they may qualify for and seamlessly transition them to an application process,” she said.\n\nNow, with improved self-service accessibility to online services, you might not have to call or visit an office to get what you need. This helps our staff focus on serving customers who need in-person assistance.\n\nThe redesign is intended to provide a clear path to the tasks your clients need to accomplish. Many of the most visited sections of SSA.gov are now live with a more user-friendly and task-based approach. New pages and improvements based on public feedback will continue to be unveiled in the coming months, as part of our ongoing efforts to improve how the public can do business with us.\n\nWhen you visit SSA.gov, you can use interactive tools to access a variety of services. To learn more, encourage your clients to visit our blog at https://blog.ssa.gov/social-security-launches-redesigned-website-at-ssa-gov.\n\nStay Healthy and Independent with Senior Nutrition Programs\n\nAre your clients eligible for Social Security retirement benefits or already receiving them? Did you know that your clients can also receive healthy meals and other nutrition services through the National Senior Nutrition Program? Local meal programs in communities across the country are waiting to serve them.\n\nAs we age, we have different needs, different ways we take care of our health, and different nutrients we need to get from our food. But we don’t always have enough healthy food or the desire to prepare or eat a meal. Whether your clients need more food, healthier food, someone to share a meal with, or just want to learn about good eating habits, a meal program can help.\n\nEvery day, senior nutrition programs serve almost one million meals to people age 60 and older. With home-delivered and group meal options, your clients can get the food they need in a way that works best for them. It can help your clients avoid missed meals – and save them time and money with less shopping and cooking.\n\nTo learn more about these local senior nutrition programs, your clients can visit our blog at https://blog.ssa.gov/stay-healthy-and-independent-with-the-senior-nutrition-program.\n\nGetting Two SSI Payments in One Month\n\nFor most months in the year, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients get their SSI payment on the first day of the month. But when the first day of the month falls on the weekend or a federal holiday, your clients receive their SSI payment on the last business day before the first day of the month. That means your clients may get two SSI payments in the same month.\n\nWe do this to avoid putting your clients at a financial disadvantage and make sure that they don’t have to wait beyond the first of the month to get their payment. It does not mean that your clients are receiving a duplicate payment in the previous month, so they do not need to contact us to report the second payment.\n\nHere’s how this will work in April 2023. April 1, 2023, falls on a Saturday, so we will issue your clients’ SSI payment for the month of April on March 31, 2023. In this example, your clients get two SSI payments in March.\n\nThe first March payment, on March 1, is their regularly scheduled payment for March. The second March payment, on March 31, 2023, is their SSI payment for the month of April.\n\nYour clients can also check out our Schedule of Social Security Benefit Payments for the current and upcoming calendar year at www.ssa.gov/pubs/calendar.htm.\n\nSecuring today and tomorrow starts with being informed. Please share this information with your clients.\n\nJanuary 2023\n\nThis New Year, Learn About Social Security Online\n\nSocial Security programs touch the lives of millions of people.

Check out our available resources at www.ssa.gov/onlineservices.\n\nPlease share this information with your clients.\n\nGeneral Enrollment Period for Medicare Part B\n\nIf your clients did not apply for Medicare Part B (medical insurance) within three months before or after turning age 65, they have another chance each year during the General Enrollment Period. This period runs from January 1 to March 31 every year. Coverage begins the first day of the month after they sign up.\n\nIf your clients don’t enroll in Part B when they’re first eligible for it, they may have to pay a late enrollment penalty while they have Part B coverage. A 10% monthly premium increase will be applied for each 12-month period they were eligible for Part B but did not sign up for it.\n\nEncourage your clients to visit our Medicare Benefits page at www.ssa.gov/benefits/medicare to learn more about Medicare. They may also read our publication at www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10043.pdf.\n\nPlease share this information with your clients.\n\nSocial Security’s Top 10 Webpages for 2023\n\nThere’s no better place for your clients to learn about Social Security programs and do business with us than on our redesigned website at SSA.gov.

The National Endowment for Financial Education (NEFE) conducts polls on key issues, like retirement savings, that affect a person’s financial past, present, and future.\n\nLifetime financial education can be a helpful tool in preparing for retirement.
