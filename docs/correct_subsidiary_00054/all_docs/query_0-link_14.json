He is considered one of the foremost Internet of Things (IoT) thinkers and has a new book, Digital Transformation 3.0: The New Business-to-Consumer Connections of The Internet of Things. Martin has been named #1 in Internet of Things Top 10 Influencers by IT Chronicles, an “IoT Thought Leaders to Watch,” and a \"Biggest Influencer in IT Consulting\" by Q-Employ. He hosts a worldwide podcast titled “The Voices of the Internet of Things with Chuck Martin,” where he converses with top executives from the companies driving the IoT. Martin is the author of numerous business books, including Net Future, Mobile Influence:The New Power of the Consumer, and The Third Screen. Chuck is the Editor of the MediaPost AI & IoT Daily, the largest AI and IoT daily publication in the world, and also writes the widely-read daily column “Connected Thinking,” sent to more than 100,000 subscribers each day.\n\nMartin has spent his career defining the future impacts of developing technology on business around the world. As a futurist and visionary, in 1998, Martin wrote in his worldwide bestseller Net Future the following: “Wearable computers will venture out of the labs into the workplace, disposable chips will allow appliances to communicate with each other, and more networked devices will connect to more networked devices.” Martin essentially predicted the coming arrival of the Internet of Things two decades ahead of time.\n\nAt the birth of the commercial Web, Martin was the founding publisher of Interactive Age, the first publication in history to launch in print and on the Web simultaneously. It was the first publication in history to run an interactive, online advertisement.\n\nAs head of Net Future Institute, a U.S.-based think tank that focuses on disruptive business strategies and marketing tactics for a networked world, Martin is on the forefront of research exploring the roles of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things and their impact on consumer behaviors.\n\nMartin is a former Vice President of IBM, where he ran a $1 billion global division responsible for business strategy solutions in the media industry, including publishers and advertising agencies.\n\nHe also has been Associate Publisher of Information Week, a magazine targeted to CIOs and information technology professionals and has been an adjunct professor at the Whittemore School of Business and Economics at the University of New Hampshire, where he taught Marketing Research.\n\nMartin has appeared on CNN, CNBC, Fox, Cheddar TV and ABC-TV’s News Now, and is a regular guest on business radio talk shows."
