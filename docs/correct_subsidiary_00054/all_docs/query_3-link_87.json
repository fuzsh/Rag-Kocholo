        "text": "George Herbert Walker School of Business & Technology website (external to catalog)\n\nMission\n\nTo prepare students for career success in an increasingly globally integrated business and technological economy utilizing a student-centered, real-world approach.\n\nVision\n\nTo be a leading institution of business and technology education by providing students with the academic and professional preparation needed to achieve upward career mobility.\n\nValues\n\nRespect - A culture of respect facilitates highly positive interactions between and among students, staff, faculty and other stakeholders.\n\nKnowledge - Knowledge allows us all, regardless of the role we serve, to maximize our capacity for achievement.\n\nPotential - Every individual has the potential to succeed.\n\nDiversity and Inclusion - Diversity in all its forms enriches the education experience--both in and out of the classroom.\n\nGlobal Perspectives - Students with global perspectives will be better prepared to serve the organizations and communities in which they live and work.\n\nSpecial Study Opportunities\n\nStudy Abroad\n\nStudents in the George Herbert Walker School of Business & Technology have opportunities to study abroad at one of Webster University's international campuses for a term, semester or longer. This is an excellent way for students to gain global exposure and study with faculty members and students from various parts of the world.\n\nInternships\n\nStudents can choose to participate in internships for academic credit. Internships are a great way to gain hands-on professional experience and expand upon knowledge gained in the classroom. Internship opportunities should be aligned with the student's major and career goals. Interested students should contact their department internship coordinator for additional information and requirements.\n\nSenior Thesis or Thesis Project\n\nCompleting a Senior Thesis or Thesis Project (MNGT 4970) is a research requirement for some majors and an elective option for other majors at an international campus. Students doing a thesis will invest significant time and energy in preparing primary and secondary research that will explore the existent body of knowledge of their field of study, or they will produce a significant project. Due to the faculty supervision requirement, online students may not pursue the senior thesis or project option.\n\nStudents doing a senior thesis or thesis project must have completed all core course requirements for their major, as well as any specific prerequisite course specified for the thesis course. A thesis may not be substituted for any core course or for any capstone course requirement for the student's field of study. Students should see their international campus academic director for the necessary guidelines and forms for pursuing this course. The thesis option is not available in all degree programs and majors and not in any online format. Further, the thesis option is only available for undergraduate degree-seeking students in the following international campuses: Austria, The Netherlands, and Switzerland.\n\nThe student registered for a senior thesis initially registers for a minimum of 3 credit hours and subsequently maintains a minimum enrollment of 2–3 credit hours until the thesis is completed. A maximum of 9 credit hours may be applied toward the undergraduate degree, with appropriate prior approvals. Credit for the thesis may be awarded in non-letter grade format (Credit/No Credit.)\n\nWalker Joint MBA Program\n\nFor any undergraduate degree student at Webster University who is considering the master of business administration degree, the Walker Joint MBA enables completion of the MBA in a shorter amount of time.\n\nStudents who have completed an ACBSP accredited undergraduate program at Webster within the past 10 years may waive 6 credit hours of electives, reducing the number of required courses to 30 credit hours. The degree can then be completed in as little as one calendar year.\n\nFor further information, please contact Academic Advising or the MBA program director.\n\nBusiness Department\n\nElizabeth Risik, chair\n\nMajors and Degrees\n\nBusiness Administration (BS)\n\nOptional emphasis areas:\n\nAccounting\n\nEconomics\n\nEntrepreneurship\n\nHuman Resource Management\n\nInternational Business\n\nMarketing\n\nSports and Entertainment Management\n\nCombined Degree Options:\n\nBusiness Administration (BS) with an emphasis in Accounting/Finance (MS)\n\nEconomics (BA)\n\nFinance (BS)\n\nMinors\n\nBusiness\n\nEconomics\n\nFinance\n\nDual Majors and Dual Degrees\n\nStudents who wish to dual major in business administration with an emphasis in accounting and finance may do so.
