He joined the Virgin Group as Group Public Relations Manager in 1987. Over the next several years he was responsible for presenting Virgin’s joint venture strategy, spent several months working in Japan and began to move into a more general management role. Will worked on the strategy to expand the brand into new areas such as financial services and telecoms.\n\nFrom 1995 onwards, Will became part of a team developing the Virgin branded venture capital model for global expansion. In 1997 he became a Director of Virgin Rail Group and in 2000, he was appointed Brand Development and Corporate Affairs Director for Virgin. In 2004 he became President of Virgin Galactic. In 2007 he took on that role in an executive part time capacity and became special advisor to Sir Richard Branson. He was also a trustee of the Virgin Unite social entrepreneurship and environmental not for profit foundation. He left Virgin at the start of 2011 but remains a consultant to Virgin Galactic.\n\nIn addition to his Virgin involvement, Will was appointed non-executive Chair of Next Fifteen Communications Group PLC, the global technology PR consultancy in January 2004 (he retired from that role in April 2011).\n\nIn 2009 he was appointed to the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) and in 2011 was appointed Chair of its Economic Impact Committee.\n\nHe is a member of the first Minister of Scotland’s “GlobalScot” business-mentoring network.\n\nWill also chaired the UK Industry Taskforce on Peak Oil and Energy Security (ITPOES) from 2007 – 2011 and remains a member of the taskforce.\n\nIn 2010 he joined the Board of the Scottish Exhibition + Conference Centre (SECC) in Glasgow and in 2014 he was appointed Chair.

He extended his role at Loewy following its acquisition by Writtle Holdings by joining the new Writtle company advisory board and taking on the Chair of the new group’s PR subsidiary, Speed Communications. Speed was sold to AIM listed Mission Marketing PLC in 2014 and as a result Will subsequently resigned as Chair.\n\nIn 2011 Will joined the Board of Stagecoach Group PLC, the global transport group and was Deputy Chair until 2020.\n\nHe has also held the role of the Chair of Transport Systems Catapult Ltd, a technology and innovation centre set up by the Technology Strategy Board of the British Government but resigned that after his three-year term was completed to avoid conflict with his enhanced Stagecoach role.\n\nFrom 2014 - 2020, Will was the non-executive Chair of The Scottish Gallery in Edinburgh.\n\nIn 2014, he joined Purplebricks Group PLC, a 24/7 online estate agency business in which he was a founder shareholder/director in 2012. In 2018 following the sale of a significant minority stake to Axel Springer Group, Will volunteered to resign from the Board of Purplebricks Group PLC but remains a shareholder.\n\nIn 2016, he became Chair of Clyde Space Ltd, the UK’s leading independent space satellite manufacturer. After chairing Clyde Space for a number of years he has helped organise its sale to ÅAC Microtec this year and was invited to join the Board of the Swedish holding company and is currently a Director of the newly named ÅAC Clyde Space AB.\n\nIn April 2017, Will was appointed as senior non-executive Director at GVC Holdings PLC, A FTSE 250 gaming and software company. Will had a significant impact on improving the governance of GVC and was involved in diversifying the Board. In 2018 the Company acquired Ladbrokes Coral, joined the FTSE 100 and took a strategic decision to expand further into the United States. Prior to the announcement of a joint venture with MGM in the USA, Will volunteered to resign to coincide with the appointment of a US Board Director.\n\nIn October 2017, Will joined the UK Government Scottish Business Task Force. A new body set up to help advise the UK government on industrial and economic policy in Scotland.\n\nIn July 2018, Will joined the Board of Good Energy PLC as Deputy Chair and in September 2018 he joined the Board of the Royal Air Force as a Non-Executive Director with rank equivalent of Air Vice-Marshall.\n\nIn September 2019, Will joined UKspace as President of the trade association which represents the UK space industry. In June 2021, Will joined Seraphim Space Investment Trust Fund PLC as Chair of the world’s first listed space technology investment fund.\n\nIn January 2020, Will became Chair of Craneware PLC, an Edinburgh based company which is engaged in the development, licensing and ongoing support of computer software for the United States healthcare industry.\n\nIn August 2021, Will becomes Chancellor of Edinburgh Napier University.\n\nIn addition to his business commitments, Will is a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society, The Marketing Society and Vice President of The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport and fundraises for various charities.\n\nHe holds the Royal Aeronautical Society's prestigious Geoffrey Pardoe Space Award for services to the space industry.\n\nHe describes his hobbies as everything that moves and he is a keen scuba diver, skier, shot, classic car restorer and hill walker.\n\nWill Whitehorn was born in Edinburgh and graduated with an Honours degree from the University in Aberdeen before spending his early career as a Helicopter Search and Rescue Crewman in The North Sea (British Airways Helicopters 1982-1984).\n\nHe then joined Thomas Cook as a graduate trainee before joining Virgin Group.
