        "text": "(TNS) â€” Houstonians whose homes were ravaged by Hurricane Beryl after it made landfall Monday morning should already be thinking about filing insurance claims for the damages sustained, according to the Texas Department of Insurance. And now those without full coverage can also apply for individual assistance from the federal government.\n\n\"You need to get your claim started as soon as possible,\" Insurance Commissioner Cassie Brown said in a statement, adding that the state agency could help anyone who runs into trouble contacting or understanding their provider. The state helpline for residents can be reached at 800-252-3439.\n\nWater damage claims are often trickier than those for falling trees or wind: most home and rental policies leave out flooding, though not all. For people who are covered or have separate flood insurance, the time pressure can be even greater. Federal flood policies mandate that damage claims should be filed within 60 days.\n\nOn Monday, the Federal Emergency Management Agency also said it \"stands ready to support\" those impacted by Beryl.\n\nBesides running the National Flood Insurance Program, FEMA's initial role in the region's Beryl recovery effort focused on emergency response and search-and-rescue operations. In some of the counties in which Beryl's impact was declared a major disaster, the federal agency also unlocked grants and loans to help individuals recover and repair home damages.\n\nActing Gov. Dan Patrick first requested individual assistance for residents in 15 counties hit hardest by the storm: Brazoria, Chambers, Galveston, Harris, Jackson, Jasper, Jefferson, Liberty, Matagorda, Montgomery, Orange, Polk, San Jacinto, Walker and Wharton. Fort Bend and Nacogdoches were later added to the list.\n\nOn Friday President Joe Biden approved the step, which follows a federal disaster declaration and preliminary damage assessment.\n\nResidents from the 17 approved counties can apply online for FEMA aid by entering their damage details on disasterassistance.gov.\n\nMeanwhile, officials with the Texas Division of Emergency Management have asked residents to submit online damage reports of home destruction through its Individual State of Texas Assessment Tool (iSTAT).\n\nInformation filed online \"helps officials connect impacted Texans with resources & services,\" the division said, and the new system's tallies supported the state effort to secure federal assistance from FEMA both for Hurricane Beryl and the May floods earlier this year.\n\nTexas Department of Insurance tips on filing a claim:\n\nâ€” Contact your insurance company or agent as soon as possible.\n\nâ€” Keep a list of everyone you talk to. Be ready to describe the damage.\n\nâ€” Make a list of damaged property. Take pictures or video. Don't throw away damaged items until you talk to your insurance company or adjuster.\n\nâ€” Try to protect your property from further damage. Cover broken windows and holes to keep out rain and prevent vandalism or theft.\n\nâ€” Ask about additional living expenses if you can't live in your home due to the damage or power outages. Your insurance may pay some of those expenses.\n\nâ€” Save proof you paid the deductible on your claim. State law makes it illegal for contractors or roofers to offer to waive a deductible or to promise a rebate for the amount.\n\nâ€” In addition to filing your insurance claim, be sure to tell the Texas Division of Emergency Management about the damage. This will help Texas to receive as many recovery funds as possible. Report damage at iSTAT Damage Surveys.\n\nFind these tips in English and Spanish on the state agency's website.\n\nÂ©2024 the Houston Chronicle. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC."
