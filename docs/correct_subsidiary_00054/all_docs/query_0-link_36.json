The project establishes a Paralysis Resource Center State Pilot program in Pennsylvania. The mission of the program is to improve the quality of life of Pennsylvanians of all ages living with paralysis and their caregivers by improving or increasing the services and supports offered by community-based disability organizations.\n\nThe State of Pennsylvania Paralysis Resource Center will provide grants of up to $25,000 to nonprofit, community organizations serving people with paralysis and their caregivers in Pennsylvania. Brad Dicianno, MD, who will lead the project, says that the program is meant to increase access or delivery of services to people living with paralysis; improve quality of life and community integration; and build partnerships among organizations within PA.\n\nSeveral other faculty at the University of Pittsburgh (Rory Cooper, PhD; Michael Boninger, MD; Gina McKernan, PhD; Lynn Worobey, PhD, DPT; and Amy Wagner, MD) and Magee Rehabilitation (Marci Ruediger, PT, MS) will assist Dr. Dicianno in carrying out the program.\n\nYear 1 Subgrantees:\n\nIM ABLE Foundation's mission is to remove obstacles that prevent people affected by disabilities from being physically active. The organization will purchase adaptive mountain handcycles. The handcycles will have upgraded electronic assistance to accommodate people who do not have the necessary arm strength to ride on their own. With these adaptive mountain handcycles, they will be able to offer new opportunities to individuals with a wide range of adaptive needs. The funds will also be used to cover maintenance and program costs. The organization expects to increase the total number of rides and riders per year and plans to add a shorter group ride once per week and a longer ride once or twice per month. IM Able Foundation is located in Eastern PA in Wyomissing.\n\nThe PRC funding supports an adaptive bicycle ride organized by the IM Able Foundation (Wyosmissing, PA):\n\nHarmarville Outreach Programs and Education (HOPE) Network is a non-profit community-based that provides education and adaptive sports and recreation programs and services to individuals with paralysis and their families, friends, and caregivers. The Juniors Adaptive Sports and Recreation program is part of the HOPE Network Healthsports Program and provides education and adaptive sports and recreation programming geared to children of all ages. The funding will enable the purchase of pediatric sports wheelchairs that are specifically designed to meet the needs and sizes of different wheelchair basketball players. The HOPE network expects that adding the new chairs will increase attendance and the number of new participants with paralysis and will improve fitness as measured by body fat analysis, strength, quickness and speed. The organization is located in western PA in Pittsburgh.\n\nPhotos of wheelchair basketball:\n\nThe Center for Independent Living of South Central Pennsylvania's mission is to help individuals live life independently. Funding will be used to carry out bi-monthly three-hour long sessions within the POWER (People, Opportunities, Wellness, Education and Resources) Program.

They will measure the number of unique participants that will use the equipment, activity duration and frequency of equipment use, and satisfaction with the new equipment. PCAS is located in eastern PA, in Philadelphia.\n\nThe Fighting Back Scholarship Program (FBSP) was created in 1989 to assist individuals who had survived life-changing illnesses or injuries and who were without the finances needed to participate in a rehabilitative exercise program. Recognizing that medical insurance usually runs out long before all rehabilitation needs are met, FBSP seeks to extend rehabilitation through individualized fitness programs and personal training. Fighting Back fitness training helps individuals develop and maintain mobility, strength, and increases confidence. It also provides a welcomed and necessary connection for individuals to a community and other people. Funding will be used to provide additional scholarships to individuals who are living with paralysis. These scholarships consist of one-to-one fitness training in one of two Fighting Back locations. Individuals and their family members/caregivers are welcomed. Sessions will be offered one time per week for over the course of a year (52 one-hour sessions). At the conclusion of the scholarship training period, individuals and their family/caregivers will be provided with specific recommendations for continued exercise at home or in the community.
