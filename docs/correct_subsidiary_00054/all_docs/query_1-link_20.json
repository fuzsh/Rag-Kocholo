        "text": "Eight, 10 people in suits, a circle of folding chairs, a chirpy HR rep with a clipboard. Each applicant telling her, one by one, in front of all the others, why heâs the right candidate for this $11-an-hour job as a bank teller.\n\nIt was 2010, and Scott had just graduated from college with a bachelorâs in economics, a minor in business and $30,000 in student debt. At some of the interviews he was by far the least qualified person in the room. The other applicants described their corporate jobs and listed off graduate degrees. Some looked like they were in their 50s. âOne time the HR rep told us she did these three times a week,â Scott says. âAnd I just knew I was never going to get a job.â\n\nAfter six months of applying and interviewing and never hearing back, Scott returned to his high school job at The Old Spaghetti Factory. After that he bounced aroundâselling suits at a Nordstrom outlet, cleaning carpets, waiting tablesâuntil he learned that city bus drivers earn $22 an hour and get full benefits. Heâs been doing that for a year now. Itâs the most money heâs ever made. He still lives at home, chipping in a few hundred bucks every month to help his mom pay the rent.\n\nIn theory, Scott could apply for banking jobs again. But his degree is almost eight years old and he has no relevant experience. He sometimes considers getting a masterâs, but that would mean walking away from his salary and benefits for two years and taking on another five digits of debtâjust to snag an entry-level position, at the age of 30, that would pay less than he makes driving a bus. At his current job, heâll be able to move out in six months. And pay off his student loans in 20 years.\n\nThere are millions of Scotts in the modern economy. âA lot of workers were just 18 at the wrong time,â says William Spriggs, an economics professor at Howard University and an assistant secretary for policy at the Department of Labor in the Obama administration. âEmployers didnât say, âOops, we missed a generation. In 2008 we werenât hiring graduates, letâs hire all the people we passed over.â No, they hired the class of 2012.â\n\nYou can even see this in the statistics, a divot from 2008 to 2012 where millions of jobs and billions in earnings should be. In 2007, more than 50 percent of college graduates had a job offer lined up. For the class of 2009, fewer than 20 percent of them did. According to a 2010 study, every 1 percent uptick in the unemployment rate the year you graduate college means a 6 to 8 percent drop in your starting salaryâa disadvantage that can linger for decades. The same study found that workers who graduated during the 1981 recession were still making less than their counterparts who graduated 10 years later. âEvery recession,â Spriggs says, âcreates these cohorts that never recover.â\n\nThe Class of Oh No\n\nHeaven help you if you graduated on the wrong side of the recession.\n\nâ07 gradâ09 grad\n\nOver 10 years, the typical â09 grad could earn up to0less than the typical â07 grad.\n\nBy now, those unlucky millennials who graduated at the wrong time have cascaded downward through the economy. Some estimates show that 48 percent of workers with bachelorâs degrees are employed in jobs for which theyâre overqualified. A university diploma has practically become a prerequisite for even the lowest-paying positions, just another piece of paper to flash in front of the hiring manager at Quiznos.\n\nBut the real victims of this credential inflation are the two-thirds of millennials who didnât go to college. Since 2010, the economy has added 11.6 million jobsâand 11.5 million of them have gone to workers with at least some college education. In 2016, young workers with a high school diploma had roughly triple the unemployment rate and three and a half times the poverty rate of college grads.\n\nOnce you start tracing these trends backward, the recession starts to look less like a temporary setback and more like a culmination. Over the last 40 years, as politicians and parents and perky magazine listicles have been telling us to study hard and build our personal brands, the entire economy has transformed beneath us.\n\nFor decades, most of the job growth in America has been in low-wage, low-skilled, temporary and short-term jobs. The United States simply produces fewer and fewer of the kinds of jobs our parents had. This explains why the rates of âunder-employmentâ among high school and college grads were rising steadily long before the recession. âThe way to think about it,â says Jacob Hacker, a Yale political scientist and author of The Great Risk Shift, âis that there are waves in the economy, but the tide has been going out for a long time.â\n\nThe decline of the job has its primary origins in the 1970s, with a million little changes the boomers barely noticed. The Federal Reserve cracked down on inflation. Companies started paying executives in stock options. Pension funds invested in riskier assets. The cumulative result was money pouring into the stock market like jet fuel. Between 1960 and 2013, the average time that investors held stocks before flipping them went from eight years to around four months. Over roughly the same period, the financial sector became a sarlacc pit encompassing around a quarter of all corporate profits and completely warping companiesâ incentives.\n\nThe pressure to deliver immediate returns became relentless. When stocks were long-term investments, shareholders let CEOs spend money on things like worker benefits because they contributed to the companyâs long-term health. Once investors lost the ability to look beyond the next earnings report, however, any move that didnât boost short-term profits was tantamount to treason.\n\nThe new paradigm took over corporate America. Private equity firms and commercial banks took corporations off the market, laid off or outsourced workers, then sold the businesses back to investors. In the 1980s alone, a quarter of the companies in the Fortune 500 were restructured. Companies were no longer single entities with responsibilities to their workers, retirees or communities.\n\nBusinesses applied the same chop-shop logic to their own operations. Executives came to see themselves as first and foremost in the shareholder-pleasing game. Higher staff salaries became luxuries to be slashed. Unions, the great negotiators of wages and benefits and the guarantors of severance pay, became enemy combatants. And eventually, employees themselves became liabilities. âCorporations decided that the fastest way to a higher stock price was hiring part-time workers, lowering wages and turning their existing employees into contractors,â says Rosemary Batt, a Cornell University economist.\n\nBoomer\n\nMillennial\n\nSource: National Center for Education Statistics. Calculations based on tuition for four-year public universities from 1973-1976 and 2003-2006.\n\nThirty years ago, she says, you could walk into any hotel in America and everyone in the building, from the cleaners to the security guards to the bartenders, was a direct hire, each worker on the same pay scale and enjoying the same benefits as everyone else. Today, theyâre almost all indirect hires, employees of random, anonymous contracting companies: Laundry Inc., Rent-A-Guard Inc., Watery Margarita Inc. In 2015, the Government Accountability Office estimated that 40 percent of American workers were employed under some sort of âcontingentâ arrangement like thisâfrom barbers to midwives to nuclear waste inspectors to symphony cellists. Since the downturn, the industry that has added the most jobs is not tech or retail or nursing. It is âtemporary help servicesââall the small, no-brand contractors who recruit workers and rent them out to bigger companies.\n\nThe effect of all this âdomestic outsourcingââand, letâs be honest, its actual purposeâis that workers get a lot less out of their jobs than they used to. One of Battâs papers found that employees lose up to 40 percent of their salary when theyâre âre-classifiedâ as contractors. In 2013, the city of Memphis reportedly cut wages from $15 an hour to $10 after it fired its school bus drivers and forced them to reapply through a staffing agency. Some Walmart âlumpers,â the warehouse workers who carry boxes from trucks to shelves, have to show up every morning but only get paid if thereâs enough work for them that day.\n\nâThis is whatâs really driving wage inequality,â says David Weil, the former head of the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor and the author of The Fissured Workplace. âBy shifting tasks to contractors, companies pay a price for a service rather than wages for work. That means they donât have to think about training, career advancement or benefit provision.â\n\nThis transformation is affecting the entire economy, but millennials are on its front lines. Where previous generations were able to amass years of solid experience and income in the old economy, many of us will spend our entire working lives intermittently employed in the new one. Weâll get less training and fewer opportunities to negotiate benefits through unions (which used to cover 1 in 3 workers and are now down to around 1 in 10). Plus, as Uber and its âgig economyâ ilk perfect their algorithms, weâll be increasingly at the mercy of companies that only want to pay us for the time weâre generating revenue and not a second more.\n\nBut the blame doesnât only fall on companies. Trade groups have responded to the dwindling number of secure jobs by digging a moat around the few that are left. Over the last 30 years, theyâve successfully lobbied state governments to require occupational licenses for dozens of jobs that never used to need them. It makes sense: The harder it is to become a plumber, the fewer plumbers there will be and the more each of them can charge. Nearly a third of American workers now need some kind of state license to do their jobs, compared to less than 5 percent in 1950. In most other developed countries, you donât need official permission to cut hair or pour drinks. Here, those jobs can require up to $20,000 in schooling and 2,100 hours of instruction and unpaid practice.\n\nIn sum, nearly every path to a stable income now demands tens of thousands of dollars before you get your first paycheck or have any idea whether youâve chosen the right career path. âI was literally paying to work,â says Elena, a 29-year-old dietician in Texas. (Iâve changed the names of some of the people in this story because they don't want to get fired.) As part of her masterâs degree, she was required to do a yearlong âinternshipâ in a hospital. It was supposed to be training, but she says she worked the same hours and did the same tasks as paid staffers. âI took out an extra $20,000 in student loans to pay tuition for the year I was working for free,â she says.\n\nAll of these trendsâthe cost of education, the rise of contracting, the barriers to skilled occupationsâadd up to an economy that has deliberately shifted the risk of economic recession and industry disruption away from companies and onto individuals. For our parents, a job was a guarantee of a secure adulthood. For us, it is a gamble. And if we suffer a setback along the way, thereâs so little to keep us from sliding into disaster.\n\nBecoming poor is not an event. It is a process.\n\nLike a plane crash, poverty is rarely caused by one thing going wrong. Usually, it is a series of misfortunesâa job loss, then a car accident, then an evictionâthat interact and compound.\n\nI heard the most acute description of how this happens from Anirudh Krishna, a Duke University professor who has, over the last 15 years, interviewed more than 1,000 people who fell into poverty and escaped it. He started in India and Kenya, but eventually, his grad students talked him into doing the same thing in North Carolina. The mechanism, he discovered, was the same.\n\nWe often think of poverty in America as a pool, a fixed portion of the population that remains destitute for years. In fact, Krishna says, poverty is more like a lake, with streams flowing steadily in and out all the time. âThe number of people in danger of becoming poor is far larger than the number of people who are actually poor,â he says.\n\nWeâre all living in a state of permanent volatility. Between 1970 and 2002, the probability that a working-age American would unexpectedly lose at least half her family income more than doubled. And the danger is particularly severe for young people. In the 1970s, when the boomers were our age, young workers had a 24 percent chance of falling below the poverty line. By the 1990s, that had risen to 37 percent. And the numbers only seem to be getting worse. From 1979 to 2014, the poverty rate among young workers with only a high school diploma more than tripled, to 22 percent. âMillennials feel like they can lose everything at any time,â Hacker says. âAnd, increasingly, they can.â\n\nHereâs what that downward slide looks like. Gabriel is 19 years old and lives in a small town in Oregon. He plays the piano and, until recently, was saving up to study music at an arts college. Last summer he was working at a health supplement company. It wasnât the most glamorous job, lugging boxes and blending ingredients, but he made $12.50 an hour and he hoped he could step up to a better position if he proved himself.\n\nThen his sister got into a car accident, T-boned turning into their driveway. âShe couldnât walk; she couldnât think,â Gabriel says. His mom wasn't able to take a day off without risking losing her job, so Gabriel called his boss and left a message saying he had to miss work for a day to get his sister home from the hospital.\n\nBoomer\n\nMillennial\n\nSource: âThe changing equation: Building for retirement in a low return world,â BlackRock, October 2016. Percentages based on average returns from 1978-2016 for boomers and projected returns from 2016 onward for millennials.\n\nThe next day, his temp agency called: He was fired. Though Gabriel says no one had told him, the company had a three-strikes policy for unplanned absences. He had already missed one day for a cold and another for a staph infection, so this was it. A former colleague told him that his absences meant he was unlikely to get a job there again.\n\nSo now Gabriel works at Taco Time and lives in a trailer with his mom and his sisters. Most of his paycheck goes to gas and groceries because his momâs income is disappearing into the familyâs medical bills. He still wants to go to college. But since he can barely keep his head above water, heâs set his sights on an electricianâs apprenticeship program offered by a local nonprofit. âI donât understand why itâs so hard to do something with your life,â he tells me.\n\nThe answer is brutally simple. In an economy where wages are precarious and the safety net has been hacked into ribbons, one piece of bad luck can easily become a years-long struggle to get back to normal.\n\nOver the last four decades, there has been a profound shift in the relationship between the government and its citizens. In The Age of Responsibility, Yascha Mounk, a political theorist, writes that before the 1980s, the idea of âresponsibilityâ was understood as something each American owed to the people around them, a national project to keep the most vulnerable from falling below basic subsistence. Even Richard Nixon, not exactly known for lifting up the downtrodden, proposed a national welfare benefit and a version of a guaranteed income. But under Ronald Reagan and then Bill Clinton, the meaning of âresponsibilityâ changed. It became individualized, a duty to earn the benefits your country offered you.\n\nFor more stories that stay with you, subscribe to our email.\n\nSince 1996, the percentage of poor families receiving cash assistance from the government has fallen from 68 percent to 23 percent. No state provides cash benefits that add up to the poverty line. Eligibility criteria have been surgically tightened, often with requirements that are counterproductive to actually escaping poverty. Take Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, which ostensibly supports poor families with children. Its predecessor (with a different acronym) had the goal of helping parents of kids under 7, usually through simple cash payments. These days, those benefits are explicitly geared toward getting mothers away from their children and into the workforce as soon as possible. A few states require women to enroll in training or start applying for jobs the day after they give birth.\n\nThe list goes on. Housing assistance, for many people the difference between losing a job and losing everything, has been slashed into oblivion. (To pick just one example, in 2014 Baltimore had 75,000 applicants for 1,500 rental vouchers.) Food stamps, the closest thing to universal benefits we have left, provide, on average, $1.40 per meal.\n\nIn what seems like some kind of perverse joke, nearly every form of welfare now available to young people is attached to traditional employment. Unemployment benefits and workersâ compensation are limited to employees. The only major expansions of welfare since 1980 have been to the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit, both of which pay wages back to workers who have already collected them.\n\nBack when we had decent jobs and strong unions, it (kind of) made sense to provide things like health care and retirement savings through employer benefits. But now, for freelancers and temps and short-term contractorsâi.e., usâthose benefits might as well be Monopoly money. Forty-one percent of working millennials arenât even eligible for retirement plans through their companies.\n\nAnd then thereâs health care.\n\nIn 1980, 4 out of 5 employees got health insurance through their jobs. Now, just over half of them do. Millennials can stay on our parentsâ plans until we turn 26. But the cohort right afterward, 26- to 34-year-olds, has the highest uninsured rate in the country and millennialsâalarminglyâhave more collective medical debt than the boomers. Even Obamacare, one of the few expansions of the safety net since man walked on the moon, still leaves us out in the open. Millennials who can afford to buy plans on the exchanges face premiums (next year mine will be $388 a month), deductibles ($850) and out-of-pocket limits ($5,000) that, for many young people, are too high to absorb without help. And of the events that precipitate the spiral into poverty, according to Krishna, an injury or illness is the most common trigger.\n\nâAll of us are one life event away from losing everything,â says Ashley Lauber, a bankruptcy lawyer in Seattle and an Old Millennial like me. For most of her clients under 35, she says, the slide toward bankruptcy starts with a car accident or a medical bill. âYou canât afford your deductible, so you go to Moneytree and take out a loan for a few hundred bucks. Then you miss your payments and the collectors start calling you at work, telling your boss you canât pay. Then he gets sick of it and he fires you and it all gets worse.â For a lot of her millennial clients, Lauber says, the difference between escaping debt and going bankrupt comes down to the only safety net they haveâtheir parents.\n\nWhenever Tyrone moves into a new apartment, he lies down naked on his living room floor.\n\nItâs a ritual, a reminder of the years he spent without a floor underneath him or a ceiling above. He was homeless for four years in Georgia: sleeping on benches, biking to interviews in the heat, arriving an hour early so he wouldnât be sweaty for the handshake. When he finally got a job, his co-workers found out that he washed himself in gas station bathrooms and made him so miserable he quit. âThey said I âsmelled homeless,ââ he says.\n\nTyrone moved to Seattle six years ago, when he was 23, because heâd heard the minimum wage there was almost double what he made in Atlanta. He got a job at a grocery store and slept in a shelter while he saved. Since then, his income has gone up, but heâs been pushed farther and farther from the city. First stop was subsidized housing in Kirkland, 20 minutes east across the lake. Then a rented house in Tacoma, 45 minutes south, sharing a bedroom with his girlfriend and, eventually, a son. The breakup is why heâs now in Lakewood, even farther south, in a one-bedroom right next to a freeway entrance.\n\nAnd itâs already such a strain. Tyrone earns $17 an hour as a security guard at a building site, his highest wage ever. But heâs a contractor (of course), so he doesnât get sick leave or health insurance. His rent is $1,100 a month. Itâs more than he can afford, but he could only find one building that would let him move in without paying the full deposit in advance.\n\nSince rent is due on the 1st and he gets paid on the 7th, his landlord adds a $100 late fee to each monthâs bill. After that and the car paymentsâitâs a two-hour bus ride from the suburb where he lives to the suburb where he worksâhe has $200 left over every month for food. The first time we met, it was the 27th of the month and Tyrone told me his account was already zeroed out. He had pawned his skateboard the previous night for gas money.\n\nDespite the acres of news pages dedicated to the narrative that millennials refuse to grow up, there are twice as many young people like Tyroneâliving on their own and earning less than $30,000 per yearâas there are millennials living with their parents. The crisis of our generation cannot be separated from the crisis of affordable housing.\n\nMore people are renting homes than at any time since the late 1960s. But in the 40 years leading up to the recession, rents increased at more than twice the rate of incomes. Between 2001 and 2014, the number of âseverely burdenedâ rentersâhouseholds spending over half their incomes on rentâgrew by more than 50 percent. Rather unsurprisingly, as housing prices have exploded, the number of 30- to 34-year-olds who own homes has plummeted.\n\nFalling homeownership rates, on their own, arenât necessarily a catastrophe. But our country has contrived an entire âGame of Lifeâ sequence that hinges on being able to buy a home. You rent for a while to save up for a down payment, then you buy a starter home with your partner, then you move into a larger place and raise a family. Once you pay off the mortgage, your house is either an asset to sell or a cheap place to live in retirement. Fin.\n\nThis worked well when rents were low enough to save and homes were cheap enough to buy. In one of the most infuriating conversations I had for this article, my father breezily informed me that he bought his first house at 29. It was 1973, he had just moved to Seattle and his job as a university professor paid him (adjusted for inflation) around $76,000 a year. The house cost $124,000 â again, in todayâs dollars. I am six years older now than my dad was then. I earn less than he did and the median home price in Seattle is around $730,000. My fatherâs first house cost him 20 months of his salary. My first house will cost more than 10 years of mine.\n\nThe most striking thing about the problems of millennials is how intertwined and self-reinforcing and everywhere they are.\n\nOver the eight months I spent reporting this story, I spent a few evenings at a youth homeless shelter and met unpaid interns and gig-economy bike messengers saving for their first month of rent. During the days I interviewed people like Josh, a 33-year-old affordable housing developer who mentioned that his mother struggles to make ends meet as a contractor in a profession that used to be reliable government work. Every Thanksgiving, she reminds him that her retirement plan is a â401(j)ââJ for Josh.\n\nFixing what has been done to us is going to take more than tinkering. Even if economic growth picks up and unemployment continues to fall, weâre still on a track toward ever more insecurity for young people. The âLeave It To Beaverâ workforce, in which everyone has the same job from graduation until gold watch, is not coming back. Any attempt to recreate the economic conditions the boomers had is just sending lifeboats to a whirlpool.\n\nBut still, there is already a foot-long list of overdue federal policy changes that would at least begin to fortify our future and reknit the safety net. Even amid the awfulness of our political moment, we can start to build a platform to rally around. Raise the minimum wage and tie it to inflation. Roll back anti-union laws to give workers more leverage against companies that treat them as if theyâre disposable. Tilt the tax code away from the wealthy. Right now, rich people can write off mortgage interest on their second home and expenses related to being a landlord or (I'm not kidding) owning a racehorse. The rest of us canât even deduct student loans or the cost of getting an occupational license.\n\nSome of the trendiest Big Policy Fixes these days are efforts to rebuild government services from the ground up. The ur-example is the Universal Basic Income, a no-questions-asked monthly cash payment to every single American. The idea is to establish a level of basic subsistence below which no one in a civilized country should be allowed to fall. The venture capital firm Y Combinator is planning a pilot program that would give $1,000 each month to 1,000 low- and middle-income participants. And while, yes, itâs inspiring that a pro-poor policy idea has won the support of D.C. wonks and Ayn Rand tech bros alike, itâs worth noting that existing programs like food stamps, TANF, public housing and government-subsidized day care are not inherently ineffective. They have been intentionally made so. It would be nice if the people excited by the shiny new programs would expend a little effort defending and expanding the ones we already have.\n\nBut theyâre right about one thing: Weâre going to need government structures that respond to the way we work now. âPortable benefits,â an idea thatâs been bouncing around for years, attempts to break down the zero-sum distinction between full-time employees who get government-backed worker protections and independent contractors who get nothing. The way to solve this, when you think about it, is ridiculously simple: Attach benefits to work instead of jobs. The existing proposals vary, but the good ones are based on the same principle: For every hour you work, your boss chips in to a fund that pays out when you get sick, pregnant, old or fired. The fund follows you from job to job, and companies have to contribute to it whether you work there a day, a month or a year.\n\nSeriously, you should sign up. It doesnât cost anything.\n\nSmall-scale versions of this idea have been offsetting the inherent insecurity of the gig economy since long before we called it that. Some construction workers have an âhour bankâ that fills up when theyâre working and provides benefits even when theyâre between jobs. Hollywood actors and technical staff have health and pension plans that follow them from movie to movie. In both cases, the benefits are negotiated by unions, but they donât have to be. Since 1962, California has offered âelective coverageâ insurance that allows independent contractors to file for payouts if their kids get sick or if they get injured on the job. âThe offloading of risks onto workers and families was not a natural occurrence,â says Hacker, the Yale political scientist. âIt was a deliberate effort. And we can roll it back the same way.â\n\nAnother no-brainer experiment is to expand jobs programs. As decent opportunities have dwindled and wage inequality has soared, the governmentâs message to the poorest citizens has remained exactly the same: Youâre not trying hard enough. But at the same time, the government has not actually attempted to give people jobs on a large scale since the 1970s.\n\nBecause most of us grew up in a world without them, jobs programs can sound overly ambitious or suspiciously Leninist. In fact, theyâre neither. In 2010, as part of the stimulus, Mississippi launched a program that simply reimbursed employers for the wages they paid to eligible new hiresâ100 percent at first, then tapering down to 25 percent. The initiative primarily reached low-income mothers and the long-term unemployed. Nearly half of the recipients were under 30.\n\nThe results were impressive. For the average participant, the subsidized wages lasted only 13 weeks. Yet the year after the program ended, long-term unemployed workers were still earning nearly nine times more than they had the previous year. Either they kept the jobs they got through the subsidies or the experience helped them find something new. Plus, the program was a bargain. Subsidizing more than 3,000 jobs cost $22 million, which existing businesses doled out to workers who werenât required to get special training. It wasnât an isolated success, either. A Georgetown Center on Poverty and Inequality review of 15 jobs programs from the past four decades concluded that they were âa proven, promising, and underutilized tool for lifting up disadvantaged workers.â The review found that subsidizing employment raised wages and reduced long-term unemployment. Children of the participants even did better at school.\n\nBut before I get carried away listing urgent and obvious solutions for the plight of millennials, letâs pause for a bit of reality: Who are we kidding? Donald Trump, Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell are not interested in our innovative proposals to lift up the systemically disadvantaged. Their entire political agenda, from the Scrooge McDuck tax reform bill to the ongoing assassination attempt on Obamacare, is explicitly designed to turbocharge the forces that are causing this misery. Federally speaking, things are only going to get worse.\n\nWhich is why, for now, we need to take the fight to where we can win it.\n\nOver the last decade, states and cities have made remarkable progress adapting to the new economy. Minimum-wage hikes have been passed by voters in nine states, even dark red rectangles like Nebraska and South Dakota. Following a long campaign by the Working Families Party and other activist organizations, eight states and the District of Columbia have instituted guaranteed sick leave. Bills to combat exploitative scheduling practices have been introduced in more than a dozen state legislatures. San Francisco now gives retail and fast-food workers the right to learn their schedules two weeks in advance and get compensated for sudden shift changes. Local initiatives are popular, effective and our best hope of preventing the countryâs slide into âMad Maxâ-style individualism.\n\nThe court system, the only branch of our government currently functioning, offers other encouraging avenues. Class-action lawsuits and state and federal investigations have resulted in a wave of judgments against companies that âmisclassifyâ their workers as contractors. FedEx, which requires some of its drivers to buy their own trucks and then work as independent contractors, recently reached a $227 million settlement with more than 12,000 plaintiffs in 19 states. In 2014, a startup called Hello AlfredâUber for chores, basicallyâannounced that it would rely exclusively on direct hires instead of â1099s.â Part of the reason, its CEO told Fast Company, was that the legal and financial risk of relying on contractors had gotten too high. A tsunami of similar lawsuits over working conditions and wage theft would be enough to force the same calculation onto every CEO in America.\n\nSource: Bankrate Money Pulse survey, July 2015. Percentage is for young adults ages 18-29.\n\nAnd then thereâs housing, where the potentialâand necessityâof local action is obvious. This doesnât just mean showing up to city council hearings to drown out the NIMBYs (though letâs definitely do that). It also means ensuring that the entire system for approving new construction doesnât prioritize homeowners at the expense of everyone else. Right now, permitting processes examine, in excruciating detail, how one new building will affect rents, noise, traffic, parking, shadows and squirrel populations. But they never investigate the consequences of not building anythingârising prices, displaced renters, low-wage workers commuting hours from outside the sprawl.\n\nSome cities are finally acknowledging this reality. Portland and Denver have sped up approvals and streamlined permitting. In 2016, Seattleâs mayor announced that the city would cut ties with its mostly old, mostly white, very NIMBY district councils and establish a âcommunity involvement commission.â The name is terrible, obviously, but the mandate is groundbreaking: Include renters, the poor, ethnic minoritiesâand everyone else unable to attend a consultation at 2 p.m. on a Wednesdayâin construction decisions. For decades, politicians have been terrified of making the slightest twitch that might upset homeowners. But with renters now outnumbering owners in nine of Americaâs 11 largest cities, we have the potential to be a powerful political constituency.\n\nThe same logic could be applied to our entire generation. In 2018, there will be more millennials than boomers in the voting-age population. The problem, as youâve already heard a million times, is that we donât vote enough. Only 49 percent of Americans ages 18 to 35 turned out to vote in the last presidential election, compared to about 70 percent of boomers and Greatests. (Itâs lower in midterm elections and positively dire in primaries.)\n\nBut like everything about millennials, once you dig into the numbers you find a more complicated story. Youth turnout is low, sure, but not universally. In 2012, it ranged from 68 percent in Mississippi (!) to 24 percent in West Virginia. And across the country, younger Americans who are registered to vote show up at the polls nearly as often as older Americans.\n\nThe fact is, itâs simply harder for us to vote. Consider that nearly half of millennials are minorities and that voter suppression efforts are laser-focused on blacks and Latinos. Or that the states with the simplest registration procedures have youth turnout rates significantly higher than the national average. (In Oregon itâs automatic, in Idaho you can do it the same day you vote and in North Dakota you donât have to register at all.) Adopting voting rights as a causeâforcing politicians to listen to us like they do to the boomersâis the only way weâre ever going to get a shot at creating our own New Deal.\n\nOr, as Shaun Scott, the author of Millennials and the Moments That Made Us, told me, âWe can either do politics or we can have politics done to us.â\n\nAnd thatâs exactly it. The boomer-benefiting system weâve inherited was not inevitable and it is not irreversible. There is still a choice here. For the generations ahead of us, it is whether to pass down some of the opportunities they enjoyed in their youth or to continue hoarding them. Since 1989, the median wealth of families headed by someone over 62 has increased 40 percent. The median wealth of families headed by someone under 40 has decreased by 28 percent. Boomers, it's up to you: Do you want your children to have decent jobs and places to live and a non-Dickensian old age? Or do you want lower taxes and more parking?\n\nThen thereâs our responsibility. Weâre used to feeling helpless because for most of our lives weâve been subject to huge forces beyond our control. But pretty soon, weâll actually be in charge. And the question, as we age into power, is whether our children will one day write the same article about us. We can let our economic infrastructure keep disintegrating and wait to see if the rising seas get us before our social contract dies. Or we can build an equitable future that reflects our values and our demographics and all the chances we wish we'd had. Maybe that sounds naÃ¯ve, and maybe it is. But I think we're entitled to it."
