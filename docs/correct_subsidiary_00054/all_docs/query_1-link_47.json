        "text": "Students Previously Enrolled in FBISD and Returning\n\nStudents who were previously withdrawn and are re-enrolling into the same or a different FBISD school must provide updated residential information as proof of residence in FBISD. They will need to complete the New Student Online Enrollment (NSOE) process. Parents/guardians should provide proof of prior enrollment (report cards, progress report grades, a course schedule, or enrollment verification) as proof. This information will enable school officials to determine the correct elementary grade level and/or offer accurate courses for secondary students.\n\nStudents Currently Enrolled and Returning from DAEP/JJAEP/non-FBISD Facility\n\nStudents returning under these circumstances are currently FBISD students and do not need to complete the NSOE steps. These FBISD students would need to “transfer” back from Ferndell, JJAEP, or any non-FBISD facility to successfully return to their home campus. Students housed at another facility for disciplinary reasons should contact the FBISD Student Affairs Department to ensure accurate re-entry into their home campus."
