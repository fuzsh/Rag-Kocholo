        "text": "Rapid technological changes, urbanization, demographic shifts and climate change have impacted families in profound ways, a senior United Nations official told the Commission for Social Development today during a panel discussion marking 30 years since the General Assembly established the International Year of the Family.\n\n“Now is the time to ensure that no family […] is left behind in a rapidly digitalizing world,” said Maria-Francesca Spatolisano, Assistant Secretary-General for Policy Coordination and Inter-Agency Affairs, United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Over the past decades, technology has impacted work-life balance, worker productivity and access to education. The growing digital divide has intensified the challenges faced by vulnerable families and current inequities in access to technologies, she pointed out, noting that knowledge gaps exacerbate existing disparities in income, education, employment and access to housing and health services.\n\nCommencing the high-level panel discussion, Bahira Trask, Professor of Human Development & Family Sciences, University of Delaware, said that, by mid-century, two thirds of the world's population will be living in urban areas, with 90 per cent of the increase concentrated in Asia and Africa. Highlighting the link between urbanization and migration, she said that urban infrastructure must prepare for climate change driven migration.\n\n“All demographic events occur in families,” said Zitha Mokomane, Professor and Head of the Department of Sociology, University of Pretoria, adding that due to a universal decline in both the mortality and fertility rates, the world population reached 8 billion people. Accordingly, she called for human-right-based fertility policies, underlining the need to address high levels of adolescent fertility in affected regions and strengthen publicly funded reproductive health and social care.\n\nHumankind is in the tertiary phase of the Information Age, said Susan Walker, Associate Professor Emeritus of Family Social Science, University of Minnesota. Highlighting the value of information and communications technology (ICT) to family life and human development, she said that they strengthen families’ cohesion through communication and the maintenance of intergenerational relationships. Technology also plays a crucial role in successful integration of migrant families. Yet, she also identified threats through exposure, security and privacy breaches, including bullying and exposure to harmful images and online predators.\n\nIn the afternoon, the Commission heard from Heba Hagrass, Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, who underscored that “digital transformation is not neutral” — it can be a tool for inclusion and growth, and it can entrench inequality, exclusion and discrimination. For persons with disabilities, digital transformation can bolster availability of assistive devices, inclusive education, access to employment and health care. Nevertheless, lesser digital presence of persons with disabilities will lead to further exclusion. To close the disability digital divide, she called for targeted investments in digital public infrastructure.\n\nTurning to artificial intelligence, Julia Stoyanovich, Director of the Centre for Responsible AI at New York University, said that, in the not-too-distant future, “AI should become synonymous with responsible AI.” Detailing its many uses, including in medical imaging where it compares favourably with the best pathologist, she nevertheless emphasized that “decisionmaker readiness” is crucial. On the use of the morally questionable criminal sentencing tool “COMPAS” in several states of the United States, she emphasized the importance of human agency and stated: “We cannot outsource the work of being human to a machine”.\n\nOpening Remarks\n\nMARIA-FRANCESCA SPATOLISANO, Assistant Secretary-General for Policy Coordination and Inter-Agency Affairs, United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, underlined the importance of marking successive anniversaries of the International Year of the Family as a means of addressing the challenges faced by families in a rapidly changing world. Highlighting the Department’s focus on digital technologies, urbanization, demographic shifts and climate change, she said that several megatrends will largely determine the shape of the world’s future. Over the past decades, rapid technological changes have impacted families in profound ways, especially in terms of work-life balance, worker productivity, and access to education and communication technologies. Yet, the growing digital divide has intensified the challenges faced by vulnerable families and current inequities in access to technologies — resulting in knowledge gaps that exacerbate existing gaps and disparities in income, education, employment and access to housing and health services. “Now is the time to ensure that no family and no individual is left behind in a rapidly digitalizing world,” she asserted.\n\nAs family-related migration is an important component of overall migration, migration policy analysis must incorporate a family perspective, she said. Moreover, families should be seen as essential for the integration of migrants into new societies, making policies to facilitate family reunification and social protection for migrants critical for successful integration. Migration, in turn, fuels rapid urbanization, which can improve the lives of individuals and families when it is a deliberate, sustainable process. When well-planned and competently managed, cities can lift families out of poverty and contribute to social cohesion, she said, stressing that all families need adequate, affordable housing. Noting the impact of climate change on patterns of migration and urbanization, she called for greater investment in mitigation aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and in adaptation focused on helping families adjust to the changing environment. Highlighting the impact of demographic changes on family structures, she said demographic transformations need to be acknowledged and anchored in policies based on intergenerational solidarity.\n\nPanel 1\n\nIn the morning, the Commission held a high-level panel discussion on the thirtieth anniversary of the International Year of the Family, moderated by John Wilmoth, Officer-in-Charge, Division for Inclusive Social Development, Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Panellists included: Linton Mchunu, Acting Director-General of the National Department of Social Development of South Africa; Bahira Trask, Professor of Human Development & Family Sciences, University of Delaware; Zitha Mokomane, Professor and Head of the Department of Sociology, University of Pretoria; and Susan Walker, Associate Professor Emeritus of Family Social Science, University of Minnesota.\n\nMs. TRASK said that by mid-century, two thirds of the world's population will be living in urban areas, with 90 per cent of the increase concentrated in Asia and Africa. Urbanization is defined differently in different parts of the world, she acknowledged, noting that it can be defined by population density, built areas, commuting density or simply by the number of people not working in the agricultural economy. Highlighting Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 on sustainable cities and communities, she said it focuses on making cities inclusive, safe, and resilient. If well-planned, cities can lead to greater equity, social inclusion and quality of life. Urbanization is also closely linked with migration, she added, noting that the ability to decide where to live is a key element of human freedom. In order to maximize the opportunities provided by urbanization, States must invest in affordable and safe housing, reliable transportation, pedestrian-friendly streetscapes and green spaces. Further, urban infrastructure must prepare for climate change-driven migration, she said.\n\nMs. MOKOMANE said that on 15 November last year, the world population reportedly reached 8 billion people. This was due to a universal decline in the mortality rate as well as declines in fertility rates. “All demographic events occur in families,” she said, stressing that having a child, losing a parent or spouse, and moving to new locations are all family experiences. Individuals rely on family members to care for them if they become ill and people move into and out of the labour force to fulfil family responsibilities. High fertility can strain family budgets while lower fertility is linked to increased women’s labour market participation. At the same time, high fertility can be a form of safety net and enable old-age support, while lower fertility can weaken emotional and physical support, she said. The international community must consider human-right-based fertility policies, put in place interventions to address high levels of adolescent fertility in affected regions and strengthen publicly funded reproductive health and social care, she stressed.\n\nMs. WALKER, identifying different functions of today’s smartphones — including communication, entertainment and navigation — said “daily life can be done with the phone, on demand”. Humankind is in the tertiary phase of the Information Age, she said, highlighting the importance of technology in family life. In the last 25 years, nearly ubiquitous Internet use and smartphone ownership in most continents has impacted individuals, families and wider structures. Information and communications technology (ICT) has reduced space and time barriers and offered efficiencies and additional tools for communication, productivity and learning. Research to date supports the value of ICT to family life and human development. Yet, it also identifies threats through exposure, security and privacy breaches, heightening challenges especially to those living in high-risk conditions. Further research avenues will identify processes and actual impacts and strategies to best support families. In this context, she stressed the importance of equity, noting that not all people have access to the same technology.\n\nTime shapes people’s understanding of technology, she said, noting that the phones used in 2004 were talking devices, providing mobility. Today, people can do everything on their phone. Spotlighting areas of concern, she said ICT can impact sleep, lead to distraction from learning and socialization, obesity, bullying as well as exposure to harmful images and online predators. However, such technologies also offer opportunities for learning and engagement, boosting creativity, collaboration, connectivity and identity development. ICT is a topic that many parents feel insecure about, she pointed out, noting that, for many, use escalated after they were adults. And while technology helps families be cohesive through communication and the maintenance of intergenerational relationships, it is also a potential source of conflict. Technology is also crucial for families during migration, she observed, adding the successful integration of migrants requires that their technological integration is as important as the social, political and economic integration.\n\nMr. MCHUNU recalled that this year, South Africa commemorates 30 years of democracy, following the end of Apartheid. The country’s democratic Government institutionalized various policies aimed to transform the society, primarily family institutions. In its efforts to create a fair and equal society, South Africa continues to take stock of the social and economic context when developing social policies and progress. Detailing the demographic trends in his country, he said that the extended family household prevails and life expectancy is on the rise. South Africa is among countries with the highest level of inequality in the world, including in terms of income distribution and regional disparities. Family institutions have gone through significant changes, he said, spotlighting challenges that families have encountered, including poverty due to unemployment and landlessness, HIV/AIDS, the COVID-19 pandemic, absentee fathers, crime and substance abuse. Poverty and unemployment continue to place enormous stress on families.\n\nThe care-burden is carried predominantly by women, significantly affecting their ability to engage in paid work on a full-time basis, he pointed out. Further, he voiced concern over high rates of gender-based and sexual violence in the country. South Africa’s Government is putting families at the centre of development through access to shelters, clean water, sanitation, energy and housing. The public health-care sector is State-funded, servicing the majority of the population. In terms of food security, the Government has established more than 200 community nutritional centres to allow poor families to access nutritious food. He also spotlighted the national climate change response policy which is essential to climate change mitigation. To address the negative impact of new technologies, he emphasized the crucial need to create regulatory frameworks to protect children, establish guidelines on where and when technology can be used, and increase pressure on digital service providers to speed up the removal of child sex material from digital platforms.\n\nIn the ensuing interactive dialogue, the representative of Türkiye underscored the need to empower the family against the negative effects of climate change and digitalization. His Government focuses its efforts on providing assistance to families, intended to expand aid systems; a preventive approach; and offer family-oriented education, he noted.\n\nThe representative of Iran condemned the crimes and the genocide committed against the Palestinian families in Gaza. Family is the most important social institution, she said, noting her country’s youth protection law to ensure the welfare and health of the family. Iran is further implementing a national plan of sustainable family-oriented employment. However, she cautioned that new types of families are deviating from the natural healthy style of life and reproduction.\n\nAlso spotlighting the suffering of the Palestinian people, the representative of Cuba stated: “our actions should be more acute”. Underlining the need to take into account the realities in each country, she said sustainability must be achieved in the long run. In this regard, she drew attention to the debt burden which exacerbates the struggle of developing countries. Also, unilateral coercive measures imposed on some developing countries — including Cuba — negatively impact families, she pointed out.\n\nThe representative of the Russian Federation noted his Government’s support for family-oriented policies, recalling that, in 2016, it created a strategy to improve family well-being. The support for families is directly linked to achieving gender equality and the rights of children. Is it impossible to achieve the SDGs without taking into account the important role of family, he pointed out, asking how the UN can create family policies within its efforts to achieve sustainable development.\n\nThe representative of Egypt, highlighting family’s key role in social development, said that the family is entitled to protection by both the society and the State. Recognizing the intergenerational continuum, she said families and societies face multiple challenges. At the national level, Egypt is implementing a family-development plan premised on digitalization and awareness-raising, addressing, inter alia, education and the empowerment of rural communities.\n\nResponding to questions and comments, Ms. TRUSK underscored that the only way to ensure the realization of the SDGs is to focus on family programmes in a comprehensive manner, including housing, transportation, education and climate change. To this end, she highlighted the importance of solutions coming from businesses and Governments, education opportunities for young people and after-school programmes for children and adolescents. Only comprehensive family-based policies will help move the agenda forward, she added.\n\nMs. MOKOMANE, noting that “everything needs to be context-specific”, stressed that 75 per cent of Africa’s population works in the informal sector, which creates challenges for families. She also emphasized the importance of finding solutions for work-family balance.\n\nMs. WALKER, turning to digital access safety, called for a coordinated approach and recommended that different agencies talk to each other to understand the value of technology for families. She also stressed that big technical companies must be held accountable. While they are putting money into innovation, they must put equal efforts to ensure the safety of screens that children are looking at. Relatedly, she voiced support for the efforts made by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) to provide a more ethical framework.\n\nMr. MCHUNU said that the protection of human rights of individuals serves to strengthen families. Responding to Iran’s delegate, he recognized the role that families play in the society and noted that there are various forms of families, including single-parent households. To the question posed by Cuba, he highlighted the negative impact of sanctions on families and advocated for alternative responses by the international community. He also expressed solidarity with the people of Palestine and sounded alarm over the destruction of families witnessed in Gaza.\n\nPanel 2\n\nIn the afternoon, the Commission held a panel discussion on “The Influence of Digital Transformation on Inclusive Growth and Development: A Path to Realizing Social Justice”, moderated by Cynthia Samuel-Olonjuwon, Special Representative and Director of the Office for the United Nations of the International Labour Organization (ILO). The panellists included: Gabriel Bastos, Secretary of State for Social Security of the Ministry of Labour, Solidarity and Social Security of Portugal; Heba Hagrass, Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; Ursula Wynhoven, Head of United Nations Affairs Division, International Telecommunications Union (ITU); Aida Opoku-Mensah, Managing Director of Centric Digital Ghana; [SH1] and Julia Stoyanovich, Director of the Centre for Responsible AI at New York University.\n\nMr. BASTOS said that solidarity is not only a moral imperative but also an economic investment. Emerging technologies are a crucial enabler to strengthen social protection, he said, highlighting their use in his country during the COVID-19 pandemic. That was also an opportunity to reinvent social protection, reduce bureaucracy and offer innovative digital services. For instance, parents in Portugal will receive their child allowance automatically, eliminating the need for families to fill out claim forms in-person. His Government is also putting in place a single social benefit that will automatically consolidate all the different benefits a person receives. Describing how Portugal is regulating and dignifying domestic work, he said digital technology can improve the availability of decent work. The Portuguese welfare state is based on social equity and inclusion, he said, and his country has been working towards building a cohesive society since gaining independence on 25 April, 50 years ago.\n\nMs. HAGRASS said that, like other technological revolutions in the past, the expansion of digital technologies is transformative for societies and economies. However, digital transformation is not neutral — it can be a tool for inclusion and growth, and it can entrench inequality, exclusion and discrimination. She highlighted the potential of digital transformation for persons with disabilities, including through innovation and availability of assistive devices, inclusive education, access to employment, health care, personalized support systems, and access to information and communication tools. Therefore, policymakers must make intentional efforts to ensure that the unfolding digital transformation is disability inclusive. “Our world is increasingly shaped by what we consume electronically,” she pointed out, adding that the needs of those with less digital presence — including persons with disabilities — will be disregarded leading to more exclusion and discrimination. “The digital gap, in terms of access and affordability of high-speed internet and digital devices and digital skills should not be underestimated,” she cautioned.\n\nAccordingly, she called for targeted investments in digital public infrastructure and in closing the disability digital divide. Further, effective policy and regulation are key. The rapid expansion in digital innovation and technology has not been met with an adequate regulatory response to ensure that digital space is inclusive, safe and free of discrimination. Public institutions need to rapidly invest in building capacity to assess and respond to risks brought by digital technologies, she underlined, adding that persons with disabilities must be directly included so that the effects of digital transformation on their lives are integrated when designing policies and regulations. If persons with disabilities find digital technology inaccessible and unaffordable, they will be locked out of employment opportunities, which, in turn, will increase the risk of being left further behind, she warned.\n\nMs. WYNHOVEN, stressing that digital connectivity has a real impact on national economies, said a 10 per cent increase in mobile broadband penetration increases gross domestic product (GDP) by slightly over 2 per cent. Around 2.6 billion people have never experienced the digital world, she noted, adding that universal and meaningful connectivity is the possibility for everyone to enjoy a safe and productive online experience at an affordable cost. Digital technologies are key to a growing number of jobs and digital entrepreneurs can tap into global markets without even crossing national borders. And for refugees, connectivity enables them to keep in touch with their families and communities, she added, also acknowledging concerns relating to privacy, cybersecurity, harmful content, and the outsize power of large companies. Every country must provide its citizens with as broad an access to the means of communication as possible, she said, adding that this in line with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the ITU’s Constitution.\n\nMs. OPUKU-MENSAH said digital transformation is the heart of the “fourth industrial revolution”, adding that this is not only about artificial intelligence (AI) but also the Internet of things, biotechnology and robotics. Vast amounts of data can be analysed in real time, she said, adding that this has tremendous implications for digital health care and smart manufacturing. The advent of remote work and collaboration is not just the impact of COVID-19 but part of the digital transformation that is under way. How can Africa maximize the opportunities presented by this, she asked, noting that technologies such as mobile banking can help the continent leapfrog over some infrastructural lacks.\n\nNoting that e-commerce, precision agriculture and remote health care are growing in the continent, she said digital transformation is accelerating faster there than anywhere else, possibly because the current infrastructural deficit means “the little that is added has tremendous impact” compared to elsewhere. “From Cape to Cairo” the opportunities are enormous, but so are the challenges. Human rights issues such as privacy and ethical principles are critical, she said, advocating for open and multi-stakeholder communication for developing clear regulatory standards. Stressing the need for inclusive policies and awareness-raising, she said this is in tandem with the attainment of SDGs.\n\nMs. STOYANOVICH highlighted the phrase “responsible AI” adding that in the not too distant future, “AI should become synonymous with responsible AI.” Defining AI as a system in which algorithms use data to make decisions on humans’ behalf or help humans make decisions, she pointed to its many uses, from smart vacuums such as the Roomba to game systems. Medical imaging uses cutting edge AI tools, she said, noting that AI compares favourably with the best pathologist. But to put these systems to best use, “decisionmaker readiness” is crucial — the people using the AI must know when to use their judgement.\n\nPointing to the pitfalls of AI, she noted that “humans are notoriously bad at hiring” and cited a study that examined race in the labour market by sending fictitious resumes to help-wanted ads in Boston and Chicago newspapers. White names receive 50 per cent more call-backs for interviews. Unfortunately AI rarely helps reduce bias in hiring and often amplifies it, she said. Also pointing to the use of the morally questionable criminal sentencing tool called COMPAS which is used in several states of the United States, she said that people must have agency and control over AI. “We cannot outsource the work of being human to a machine,” she said.\n\nInteractive Dialogue\n\nAfter the panel discussion, delegates and members of civil society took the floor to share lessons learned from national experiences of increasing digital connectivity. Many highlighted the importance of digital literacy skills and asked how to ensure that technology is in alignment with human rights. They also raised urgent concerns, including the exposure to disinformation as well as mental health costs, especially among youth.\n\nResponding, Ms. STOYANOVICH drew attention to a comic book on AI, adding that art and graphic novels have a role to play in digital literary building. She also called for an international conversation about the carbon emissions produced by the AI industry.\n\nMs. OPOKU-MENSAH, noting that the automation process will displace low-income workers, said that trade unions need to be vocal about this. That is a human rights and freedom of expression issue, she said. There’s also the right to development, she said, adding that it is affected by internet shutdowns.\n\nMs. WYNHOVEN stressed that websites must be accessible for everyone — this calls for standards for accessible technology. Governments should procure technologies that are accessible, she added, also noting that lack of digital skills is why people don’t use the Internet even when they have connectivity. She highlighted an initiative to connect all the schools around the world to the Internet.\n\nMs. HAGRASS said that technology companies hold all the threads in their hands and must heed the voices of affected people. They need to know that “we expect them to make a revolution for humanity”, she said.\n\nMr. BASTOS said that the international community must cooperate in ensuring that technology has a positive impact on humanity. Portugal is actively working on this within the Community of Portuguese Language Countries, he said."
