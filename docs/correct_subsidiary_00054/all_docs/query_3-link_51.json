        "text": "Exciting and Rigorous Teaching and Learning\n\nWhen RPS provides our students with access to rigorous coursework and engages them with exciting teaching and learning, the sky's the limit. High-quality curricula, a passion for learning and engaging instruction are a few of the key components of our strategic plan that will be the foundation for teaching and learning at RPS.\n\npriority one\n\nSkilled and Supported Staff\n\nEvery child deserves to have a highly-qualified teacher from the start of the school year until the end of the year. Our goal is twofold: fill every teacher vacancy with a well compensated and talented teacher who leads their classrooms with love.\n\npriority two\n\nSafe and Loving School Cultures\n\nIn order to have safe and loving school cultures, every student needs to feel loved and affirmed for who they are. Our goal is to provide our students with the support they need to be successful. This isnâ€™t limited to only instructional support but mental, physical, and emotional support as well.\n\npriority three\n\nDeep Partnership with Families and Community\n\nRPS will only be successful and improve learning outcomes for students through deep partnerships with families and the community. RPS has to acknowledge the many reasons why some families and educators can remain separate from each other, and put building meaningful relationships with our families and communities at the center.\n\npriority four\n\nModern Systems and Infrastructure\n\nRPS aims to modernize our systems and infrastructure because it plays an essential role in solving access problems of students to the school system and improves student performance. With strong infrastructure, our students can focus on learning and not be held back by the systems in place.\n\npriority five"
