        "text": "Championship-contending NBA teams can handle only so much drama.\n\nTeams on the level below that — and let’s be charitable and put the Mavericks in that group — can afford even less tension in the ranks.\n\nWhich brings us to Samuel Dalembert. When he was late for workouts not once, but twice, it sent off some alarms through the organization. Maybe not public alarms, but management knew it had to make the right decisions to deal with it, sending a message to players that conduct like that wasn’t going to be tolerated, but also not being so harsh that Dalembert retreated into a shell.\n\nA couple weeks on the other side of Dalembert’s second tardy, the 6-11 center has started to regain a bit of trust from his coaches. And his teammates, although they were more prone to sticking behind the big man.\n\nWhen things happen like Dalembert’s double dip of oversleeping for practice, does it mean trust has to be re-earned?\n\n“It does,” said Jae Crowder. “But at the same time, he needs you more than anybody else at times like that.\n\n“He’s getting hammered by the media. He’s getting hammered by the coaches. And as a teammate you just want to be there for him. He’s doing what he has to do and he needs us. We have to trust him. We’ve seen flashes lately of what he can do.”\n\nIndeed, Dalembert had two solid games — albeit while playing short minutes — on the two-game trip to San Antonio and New Orleans. Then in the rematch against the Pelicans Saturday, he had nine rebounds in 23 minutes.\n\nThese are steps in the right direction. Everybody in the organization wants Dalembert to regain the form he had earlier in the season, when he was averaging about nine points and eight rebounds while playing about half the time. That was before he was late for shootaround on Nov. 18. He was lifted as the starter against Philadelphia that night.\n\nThen he was benched completely for being late to a weightlifting session before the home loss to New York.\n\n“It’s good to have him back playing this way,” coach Rick Carlisle said. “Our guys are supportive. People make mistakes. We’re all about second chances and getting it right. He’s doing his part, and we need him.”\n\nAnd as for the trust factor?\n\n“Listen, trust and respect universally have to be earned. And he’s earned a lot back here the last couple games,” Carlisle said.\n\nIt’s notable that Dalembert was suspended for a game in February when he was late for a practice while playing in Milwaukee. So the trend is there. The Mavericks, according to owner Mark Cuban, are trying to deal with it in a proactive manner.\n\n“Everybody’s got something,” Cuban said. “So we try to provide the support services that each individual needs, whether it’s diet, someone to talk to, an alarm clock, whatever it may be. It’s not limited to one person.”\n\nDalembert, a 12-year veteran, is with his fifth team in the last five seasons. He said he has trouble sleeping at nights but is taking steps to try to address that problem.\n\n“I didn’t have any problem with my teammates,” Dalembert said. “Nobody’s perfect. I’m not a lazy person in practice. I think the level of trust was always there from my teammates. I just wanted to get back to where I could help them. That was the problem. I’m always ready when they call my name. I’m going to go out and play hard.”\n\nAs Dirk Nowitzki said of Dalembert: “You just got to be a little more professional and show up on time, like everybody else has to. But I still like what he brings to the team. His length and his ability to jump, none of the other guys got. When he’s active and defends and rebounds, that makes us a different team.”\n\nOf that, there is no doubt. When Dalembert gets eight or more rebounds, the Mavericks are 7-2. That makes them 15-14 when he gets seven or fewer boards.\n\nSo does Dalembert realize just how critical his production on the glass is?\n\n“Oh yeah, of course,” Cuban said. “I’ve said it to him. Sam and I talk, so it’s not like it’s a secret. I told him I think he’s All-Star-caliber when he’s laying it out there. And I don’t think it’s even for a lack of trying. I just think sometimes he’s in sync and sometimes he’s not.”\n\nCuban added that the Mavericks have not invested in extra personnel to make sure Dalembert is picked up or at least awakened in time to make workout sessions.\n\n“It’s not like he’s missed 30 practices,” Cuban said. “He’s been late for two. We’ll do what we need to do. If we get what we got out of him [recently], everybody will be happy. [But] there’s no slack, regardless of who it is. We have alternative measures in the event those are necessary that are more punitive.”"
