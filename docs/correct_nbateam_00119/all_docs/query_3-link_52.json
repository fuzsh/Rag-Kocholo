        "text": "On the eve of both Christmas and the start of the 2011-12 NBA season, Jeremy Lin ’10 received some coal from the Houston Rockets.\n\nAccording to the Houston Chronicle, Lin was released on Saturday night to make room for big man and nine-year NBA veteran Samuel Dalembert. The team made the official announcement regarding Dalembert early this morning, just hours before flying to Orlando for its first regular-season game of the year.\n\nThe past three weeks have had many turns for Lin. On Dec. 9 the Golden State Warriors waived the Harvard alum following a rookie season in which he appeared in 29 games, averaging 2.6 points, 1.4 assists, and 1.2 rebounds, and 1.1 steals during his time on the court.\n\nOnly two days following his release from the Warriors, the Rockets claimed the second-year guard off of waivers. In his two pre-season games with Houston last week, Lin notched a total of six points, one rebound, and one assist in eight minutes of playing time.\n\nThe Rockets are set to make the official announcement of Lin’s release later today.\n\nOver a month after Penn State began its search to replace the legendary Joe Paterno, the post remains vacant.\n\nOne name that has continued to come up in rumors surrounding the position is Harvard coach Tim Murphy, mentioned as an ideal candidate because of on-field success and a clean track record. Murphy became the winningest coach in Harvard football history this season and earned his sixth Ivy title.\n\nBut with rumors continuing to circulate, Murphy has adamantly denied any contact with the search committee throughout the process, a claim corroborated by Russ Rose, the Penn State women’s volleyball coach and one of the six members of the search committee.\n\n(Continued)\n\nIn light of a Yale University investigation over the accuracy of football coach Tom Williams’ resume, the three-year Bulldog coach resigned Wednesday, finishing his career at the school with a 16-14 record.\n\nIn the weeks leading up the The Game—which for the fifth-straight year, Harvard won, 45-7—Yale quarterback Patrick Witt garnered national attention for having to decide between a final interview for the Rhodes Scholarship and playing in the annual Harvard-Yale contest. As the storyline unfolded, Williams remarked that he faced a similar dilemma in having to choose between his own final interview for the Rhodes and NFL tryouts on the same day.\n\n(Continued)"
