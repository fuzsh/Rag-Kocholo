        "text": "Renowned actor Samuel L. Jackson was born on December 21, 1948, in Washington D.C., USA. Raised by his mother in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Jackson's early life was a far cry from the glamorous world of cinema. He attended Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia, where he actively participated in co-curricular activities, particularly theater. It was during his time at college, he developed an interest in acting, a spark that would soon ignite into a full-blown passion. Jackson's acting career began with minor roles in films and television series during the 1970s and 1980s. His breakthrough came in 1991 when he portrayed a crack addict in Spike Lee's film, Jungle Fever, a performance that won him critical acclaim and a special jury prize at the Cannes Film Festival. This role paved the way for his collaboration with Quentin Tarantino, which resulted in some of his most memorable performances in movies such as Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown. The former earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Despite his success, Jackson's journey was not without hurdles. He battled and overcame drug addiction, demonstrating resilience that has come to define his persona both on and off-screen. He has also lent his voice to animated films, video games, and audiobooks, further broadening his artistic repertoire. With over 150 film credits to his name, Samuel L. Jackson is an enduring figure in Hollywood, celebrated for his compelling performances and relentless dedication to his craft.\n\nSam Elliott, with his cowboy looks and deep resonating voice, has etched a remarkable niche in the world of Hollywood. Born on August 9, 1944, in Sacramento, California, Elliott showed an early interest in acting which led him to move to Los Angeles after graduating from Clark College in Vancouver, Washington. He started his career playing minor roles on television before making his film debut in the classic western Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. However, it was his role in the film Lifeguard that first brought him significant recognition. Elliott's distinctive persona and acting prowess have made him a beloved figure in the film industry. His most notable performances include Mask, Road House, Tombstone, and the TV series The Ranch. Leveraging his unique voice, Elliot has also been a regular feature for voice-over work in commercials and films such as The Big Lebowski, where he served as the narrator. He received his first Academy Award nomination for A Star Is Born, where he played the older brother of Bradley Cooper's character. Off-screen, Sam Elliott is known for his enduring marriage to actress Katharine Ross, whom he met while filming the horror movie The Legacy. They have one daughter, Cleo Rose Elliott, who is a musician. Despite his success, Elliott remains humble and grounded, often attributing his achievements to luck and timing rather than talent alone. His dedication to his craft, along with his distinctive style, has solidified his place in Hollywood as a truly iconic actor.\n\nSamuel Adams (September 27 [O.S. September 16] 1722 â€“ October 2, 1803) was an American statesman, political philosopher, and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was a politician in colonial Massachusetts, a leader of the movement that became the American Revolution, and one of the architects of the principles of American republicanism that shaped the political culture of the United States. He was a second cousin to his fellow Founding Father, President John Adams. Adams was born in Boston, brought up in a religious and politically active family. A graduate of Harvard College, he was an unsuccessful businessman and tax collector before concentrating on politics. He was an influential official of the Massachusetts House of Representatives and the Boston Town Meeting in the 1760s, and he became a part of a movement opposed to the British Parliament's efforts to tax the British American colonies without their consent. His 1768 Massachusetts Circular Letter calling for colonial non-cooperation prompted the occupation of Boston by British soldiers, eventually resulting in the Boston Massacre of 1770. Adams and his colleagues devised a committee of correspondence system in 1772 to help coordinate resistance to what he saw as the British government's attempts to violate the British Constitution at the expense of the colonies, which linked like-minded Patriots throughout the Thirteen Colonies. Continued resistance to British policy resulted in the 1773 Boston Tea Party and the coming of the American Revolution. Parliament passed the Coercive Acts in 1774, at which time Adams attended the Continental Congress in Philadelphia which was convened to coordinate a colonial response. He helped guide Congress towards issuing the Continental Association in 1774 and the Declaration of Independence in 1776, and he helped draft the Articles of Confederation and the Massachusetts Constitution. Adams returned to Massachusetts after the American Revolution, where he served in the state senate and was eventually elected governor. Samuel Adams later became a controversial figure in American history. Accounts written in the 19th century praised him as someone who had been steering his fellow colonists towards independence long before the outbreak of the Revolutionary War. This view gave way to negative assessments of Adams in the first half of the 20th century, in which he was portrayed as a master of propaganda who provoked mob violence to achieve his goals. Both of these interpretations have been challenged by some modern scholars, who argue that these traditional depictions of Adams are myths contradicted by the historical record.\n\nSam Heughan (; born 30 April 1980) is a Scottish actor, best known for his acclaimed role as Jamie Fraser in the Starz series Outlander, for which he has received four nominations for the Saturn Awards, and a nomination for the Critics Choice Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series. He was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Most Promising Performer in 2003, for his performance in the play Outlying Islands, performed at the Royal Court Theatre Upstairs. Heughan received an honorary doctorate \"in recognition for his outstanding contribution to acting and charitable endeavors\" from the University of Stirling in June 2019. His second honorary doctorate in recognition of his artistic success and his charitable work was bestowed by the University of Glasgow in July 2019."
