At the arrival of the police initially, Dalembert's wife and cousin said that all was well. Thereafter they finally recognized that Samuel was angry violently after learning that his wife had told him she was going to Orlando with their two children. He would then violently push her and put his hand around the throat of his cousin, who wanted to intervene.\n\nDalembert was arrested for assault and battery and released later.\n\nRecall that Dalembert left Haiti for Montreal as a teenager, played for the Philadelphia 76ers (NBA), the Sacramento Kings (2010 - Dec. 2011), Houston Rockets (Dec. 2011 - 2012), Milwaukee Bucks (2012 - 2013), the Dallas Mavericks (2013 - 2014), the New York Knicks (2014 - Jan. 2015) and again the Dallas Mavericks (Jul. 2015-) during his career .\n\nSee also :\n\nhttps://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-6588-haiti-sports-samuel-dalembert-keeps-his-promise.html\n\nhttps://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-3143-haiti-sports-martelly-met-samuel-dalembert.html\n\nBF/ HaitiLibre"
