        "text": "There were many difficult practices for the 76ers during a 55-loss season, but for Sam Dalembert, the toughest came on Jan. 13. That day, Dalembert didn't know whether family members in his native Haiti were alive or dead after the catastrophic 7.0-magnitude earthquake that hit the day before.\n\nDalembert pressed on during that practice and afterward spoke to reporters about not hearing from his father and other family members.\n\nIn the weeks following the devastating earthquake that tore apart Haiti, particularly Port-au-Prince, where Dalembert lived for 14 years, the 6-11 center relentlessly worked the phones and his computer trying to find ways to provide help.\n\nFor his tireless efforts, Dalembert yesterday was awarded the 2009-10 J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award, presented annually by the Professional Basketball Writers Association. He is the first Sixer honored since Dikembe Mutombo in 2001. Julius Erving was honored in 1983.\n\n\"What Samuel has done should be a model for all professional athletes,\" said Doug Smith, of the Toronto Star, president of the PBWA. \"He saw a crying need for help and worked tirelessly to give whatever aid he could while spurring others to act and contribute as well.\"\n\nDalembert made his first visit to Haiti less than a week after the earthquake, his second during the All-Star break in mid-February. After his second visit, he brought home a half-brother and half-sister to live with him.\n\nDalembert donated $100,000 to UNICEF and has met with Haitian President Rene Preval and President Obama about relief efforts. The Samuel Dalembert Foundation teamed with UNICEF, the Red Cross and Feed the Children to assist efforts in Haiti, where an estimated 250,000 people died in the quake.\n\n\"The devastation that I saw, no one should have to endure,\" Dalembert said in the days following his first visit. \"I feel especially bad for the children. Many of them are living on the street, not knowing where their parents are or if they're still alive.\"\n\nAs Dalembert spoke then, tears streamed down his cheeks. The emotions are still as strong. After coach Eddie Jordan's firing last week, Dalembert spoke of getting back to Haiti as much as possible during the offseason. *\n\nFor more Sixers coverage, read the\n\nDaily News' Sixers blog, Sixerville, at"
