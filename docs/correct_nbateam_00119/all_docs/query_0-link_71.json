        "text": "Many people think of different qualities when they think of a hero. When I think of a hero I think of someone that is brave, strong, courageous, etc. A hero can be many different things. There are a lot different types of heroes too. My hero is a sports athlete. He is in the NBA and is the starting center for the Philadelphia 76ers. He inspires and motivates many people, including me, to play the game of basketball. My hero is Samuel Dalembert.\n\nSamuel Dalembert was born and raised in Haiti. He was raised by his grandmother but he did not know that. Sammy had been informed that his grandmother was his biological mom. As he got older his grandmother started showing him pictures of his real mom. Dalembert was just 14 when he first met his parents. They moved to Montreal when he was just a young boy. Sammy said that after he met his parents, nothing really changed. He still would call his grandma mom. But aside from reuniting with his parents in Montreal, another important thing began in his life. Montreal is where Sammy first started playing organized basketball.\n\nSamuel Dalembert was just 13 years old when he first touched a basketball. When he was a young child his favorite sport was soccer. It was much too expensive, so Sam got a board and a crooked wire to play basketball. He was a very talented soccer player but as he got older, he knew basketball was his sport. Sammy attended St. Patrick’s High School in Elizabeth New jersey. After high school Sammy went on to play at Seton Hall. Eventually, he was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers and now is a dominating 6' 11\" starting center.\n\nAfter reading the book, A Hero’s Trail, I learned many different things about heroes like Samuel Dalembert. I learned there are different types and I would put him under a hero within. He is not just a basketball hero; he also is honorary commissioner of the Sixers’ La Liga del Barrio. This is a program for young kids to get the chance he never had. He wished he could learn the game of basketball at a younger age but now he is giving kids an opportunity he never had. All of Dalembert’s teammates always call him a leader and a hero too. Sammy also overcame many challenges in his younger years. His grandmother raised him, so he never had a father to idolize. Also, he lived in a very poor country and faced poverty. Samuel has overcome so much to achieve success which is why he is a hero within.\n\nOverall, there are many different types of heroes. Some people think heroes are just celebrities and famous people but this is not always the case. A hero can be anyone who is, anywhere, and at anytime. The reason why I like Samuel Dalembert as a hero is because he is never looking down on anyone. The only time he looks down on someone is when he is helping them up. This guy has great character and anyone would love to have a guy like him on there basketball team."
