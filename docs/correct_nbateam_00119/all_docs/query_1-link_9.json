        "text": "LM Otero/Associated Press\n\nFormer NBA big man Samuel Dalembert is reportedly facing battery charges, per the Associated Press (h/t USA Today).\n\nOn Monday, the AP cited a Boca Raton, Florida, police report that stated authorities responded to a 911 call from Dalembert’s house Sunday. The charges came “after authorities say he hit his girlfriend and her cousin.”\n\nAccording to the AP, Dalembert’s girlfriend and cousin told the police nothing was wrong at first before the cousin later alleged that \"Dalembert pushed the girlfriend down and then choked the cousin when he tried to intervene.”\n\nThe AP noted Dalembert was not pleased with his girlfriend’s decision to take their two children to Orlando. He was released from jail following his arrest.\n\nDalembert entered the NBA in 2001 as a first-round pick out of Seton Hall. He played for the Philadelphia 76ers until 2010 before spending one season each with the Sacramento Kings, Houston Rockets, Milwaukee Bucks, Dallas Mavericks and New York Knicks."
