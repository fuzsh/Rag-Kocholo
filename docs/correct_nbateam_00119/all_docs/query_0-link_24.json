        "text": "ORLANDO -- Another star was born Monday night at the TD Waterhouse Centre.\n\nThe Magic (9-29) have brought a lot of stars to life this season, all of them on opposing teams. This time is was Samuel Dalembert, a 22-year-old center who started only because Derrick Coleman was out with a left knee sprain.\n\nDalembert put up career highs of 15 points and 11 rebounds before fouling out with 1:49 remaining. He also contributed three blocks, including a rejection of Tracy McGrady's slam attempt that essentially clinched the Philadelphia 76ers' 87-82 victory before a crowd of 15,474.\n\nThe 76ers (18-20) won the nationally televised game in spite of missing their last 10 shots. Their last field goal came on a short baseline jumper by Dalembert with 7:31 left.\n\n\"I thought we held our own defensively in this game,\" said Magic coach Johnny Davis. \"But we didn't have enough tonight offensively to win the basketball game.\"\n\nMcGrady won an individual scoring duel with NBA scoring leader Allen Iverson, but it was a hollow victory. In fact, it was ugly. McGrady's game-high 32 points came on 13-for-30 shooting and he missed all nine of his three-point shots. Iverson shot 9for-29 and got got seven of his 26 points at the foul line.\n\nRookie Keith Bogans scored a career-high 20 points for the Magic, who shot 36 percent in losing for the seventh time in eight games. They scored only 32 points in the second half.\n\nLee Nailon, who scored 11 points in the fourth quarter of a victory over Washington on Friday, didn't play. Davis explained that he wanted to use the bigger Drew Gooden and Juwan Howard against Philly's smaller lineup.\n\nThe Magic were down by six points with three minutes left when McGrady slipped down the lane and wound up a big dunk. The 6-foot-11 Dalembert went up with him and blocked it cleanly, and John Salmons got the rebounds for the 76ers.\n\nWith the 76ers missing everything at the other end, the Magic eventually trimmed the lead to two. But by then there were only 18.8 seconds left. Eric Snow's two free throws with 13.4 seconds left put the game away.\n\n\"I don't count it as an ugly win. I just count it as a win,\" said Snow. \"We just tried to keep them from getting second-chance points. We tried to make them take tougher shots.\"\n\nThe 76ers grabbed an 11-point lead even while Iverson was missing his first seven shots. Dalembert and Thomas combined for 13 rebounds in the first quarter, six more than the Magic.\n\nBut after Iverson opened the second quarter with a basket, Philadelphia went cold. The Magic erased the lead with a 10-0 run, then moved ahead, 42-36, on Tyronn Lue's transition jumper with 3:38 left in the first half.\n\nThe 76ers took command with 11 straight points in the third quarter, none of them by Iverson.\n\nThe Magic play at New York Wednesday night, then play Boston at home Friday night."
