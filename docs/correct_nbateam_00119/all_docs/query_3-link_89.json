        "text": "It was the year 1716, and I was ready to acquire more pieces o’eight. I was in Jamaica with one of my shipmates, Charles Vane. We both were getting low on pieces o’eight so we decided that we were going to do some plundering. We had chosen to raid a spanish salvage camp because we thought that they would have enough pieces o’eight to quench our desire. Charles Vane and I entered the camp. We were very wary of spanish soldiers. At first there was no sign of anyone, until...out of nowhere sounds of gunshots came from all sides. Charles Vane and I conjured our pistols, and were ready to fight. Soldiers appeared from around corners and shot at us. However, we could shoot every soldier we saw. We had killed about twenty spanish soldiers, …show more content…\n\nThey could keep their lives, and we would take as many of their pieces o’eight as we want. The spanish soldiers agreed, but they wouldn’t show us where there pieces o’eight were hidden. It would’ve been in their best interest if they would’ve just told us where it was hidden. Charles Vane and I requested they leave so that we could search for the pieces o’eight in private. The soldiers allowed this and left the building. We turned the place inside out and came up with absolutely nothing. I was sullen, and grim. Charles Vane, however, believed that the spanish stash had to be hidden somewhere in that building. He was incredulous to the fact that there was nothing left to uncover. Right before we were about to leave empty handed, I spotted something under the bed. I tried to pull it out, but it seemed to be glued to the floor. I called Charles Vane over and he helps me pull out the chest. The reason why I couldn’t move it by myself, was because the chest was so full of goods that it was too heavy for one grown man to lift. We knocked the lock off with the back of Charles Vane’s pistol, and slowly opened the top of the chest. When I saw the pieces o’eight glistening in the light, mirth came over me like a wave upon shore. Charles Vane was so flabbergasted at how many pieces o’eight they had that his jaw"
