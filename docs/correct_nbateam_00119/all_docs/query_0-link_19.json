        "text": "The Kings made it clear how they feel about Dalembert when they elected not to deal the nine-year veteran before February’s deadline. There was interest from teams looking for a veteran big man or looking for financial relief after the season since Dalembert is in the last year of his contract. It was quite a change for Dalembert, who wasn’t sure where he fit in earlier this season. He now speaks about the Kings needing to improve and play good basketball as the season winds down, despite their 17-52 record, but he’s understandably noncommittal about next season. “I just want to let everything play out,” Dalembert said. “See what’s happening and see what’s going on. You never know what’s going to happen.”\n\n“I try not to think about it,” said Dalembert of the offseason that also is up in the air with a new Collective Bargaining Agreement needing to be settled. “I’m still looking at the rest of the games we have and looking to win as many games as possible. “But overall it is a concern, not knowing where you’re going to be, but I’ll just leave my agent with that headache. If that happens [going back to Philadelphia], you know, there was no bridge breaking or anything like that. If it were to happen, it’s not something that I would say it would be a bad decision. I talk to [Elton Brand] a lot. He will text me and I will call him and talk about the games we’ve played. If they lose I might call and say, ‘Hey, what’s the problem?’ But they have a chance to call me a lot on that, too.”\n\nA number of veteran teams have expressed interest in Kings big man Samuel Dalembert — either via a trade before today’s 3 p.m. trade deadline or via waivers if Dalembert gets bought out by the Kings after the deadline. Don’t count on either happening. Sources say the Kings have rebuffed a number of trade offers for Dalembert and have no intention of buying him out after the deadline."
