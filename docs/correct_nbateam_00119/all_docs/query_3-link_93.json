        "text": "AUBURN HILLS, Mich. — Over the past few days Rasheed Wallace has taken some heat from various sources over his antics near the end of Game 1 when he poked his head in the Sixers’ huddle.\n\nSpeaking for the first time since Sunday’s game, Wallace blamed the media for blowing it out of proportion.\n\n“That’s things I’ve been doing my whole career,” he said. “If I do something friendly like that it’s a big deal. But if I rave, rant and cuss then, ‘Oh, that’s normal.'”\n\nAnd it is. The Sixers, the offended party if you will, were OK with it.\n\n“I didn’t even make a big deal out of him being in the huddle,” guard Andre Miller said. “I wasn’t really paying attention, but it makes the game fun to me by so many things that he does. It’s not a distraction for our team. It’s all fun. He definitely makes the game fun and he knows when to turn it on and turn it off.”\n\nMagic Johnson didn’t see it that way.\n\n“I never toyed with anybody I played against in the playoffs,” he said on TNT after Sunday’s game, referring to the huddle incident. “I had a chip on my shoulder, I was moody, cranky, I was crazy. You wouldn’t see me playing around with anyone.”\n\nCharles Barkley had criticized Wallace earlier in the broadcast saying he could be the best player in the league if he was more focused.\n\nSixers coach Maurice Cheeks, who coached Wallace for two-and-a-half seasons in Portland, disagreed with Barkley.\n\n“He was great for me,” Cheeks said. “He played as well as I’ve seen any guy play for long stretches of time. There’s a lot of guys who have a lot of talent in the league and someone always says he could be the best player.\n\n“I think Rasheed is the player he’s capable of being. He can post the ball. He can shoot the perimeter as well as any big guy, and that’s what makes him such a tough (player to) guard. He can go down on the block. He can come out and set a screen. And then he can pop. He has a lot of dimensions to his game.”\n\nOne of those dimensions is a desire to be just one of the guys rather than the star of a team.\n\n“If you run X amount of plays for him, he’ll find a way to get the ball to someone else,” Cheeks said. “It’s not a bad thing. You would like a lot of guys to be that way. You always talk about guys being selfish. Now we have a guy who has the talent to be the star and he likes helping other people out.”\n\nWallace’s reasoning for that is simple.\n\n“I think you can get more done with five individuals than one individual,” he said. “If you’ve got one guy you know is gonna get the ball in crunch time it’s easier to defend him, but if you’ve got five guys who can get the ball in crunch time it’s harder.”\n\nA team like the Pistons, who thrive because they have five players who can hurt you at any time. Sunday night was Wallace’s turn as he exploited the one-on-one matchup with Samuel Dalembert to the tune of 24 points, nine rebounds and seven blocks.\n\nIt don’t matter to me,” he said of the single coverage. “Either way I’m gonna do one of two things, either score or, if I see one of my teammates has position on their defender, throw them the ball. Play basic basketball, try not to do nothing fancy, just basic basketball, A-B-C.”\n\nThat’s one reason other players love to be on the court with him.\n\n“He’s a team guy,” Cheeks said. “If you ask anyone who’s been on his team you will see that guys love playing with him because he’ll get a technical foul, not because someone didn’t call a foul for him but about someone else.”\n\nWallace also appears to be fairly loyal — he lists himself as a Flyers and Phillies fan, although not the Eagles, who he calls the Pigeons — and to this day has a good relationship with Cheeks.\n\nHe also said Cheeks deserved to be Coach of the Year.\n\n“No one gave them a chance,” Wallace said. “Ever since they made that blockbuster trade with A.I. everyone wrote the Sixers off. Me as a Sixers fan I’m happy for them. Me knowing Mo personally, I think he’s done a tremendous job of getting them back here to the playoffs, not only just barely getting in but as the seventh seed and could have got a sixth seed.\n\n“No one gave them a chance and he’s got those guys working hard right now. He had my vote for Coach of the Year.”\n\nIn Wednesday’s playoff action …\n\nAUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) — Rasheed Wallace had another good game against the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nUnlike the series opener, a few Detroit Pistons starters helped him out.\n\nWallace scored 11 of his 16 points in the first quarter and Detroit went on to beat Philadelphia 105-88 in Game 2 on Wednesday night to even the first-round series.\n\nThe Pistons had four scorers in double figures as it took a 17-point lead, while the 76ers had only Andre Miller, who scored 11 of his 14 points in the first half.\n\nIn their 90-86 Game 1 loss, the Pistons blew a 15-point they built midway through the third quarter.\n\nDetroit refused to let the young Sixers rally again."
