        "text": "It took some time and some patience, but the Dallas Mavericks finally got their center. Before Wednesday’s summer league game against the Los Angeles Clippers, owner Mark Cuban said his team had come to terms with free- agent center Samuel Dalembert on a multi-year contract. The 6-foot-11, 250-pound Dalembert helps salvage a summer in which the Mavs lost out on Dwight Howard, and also made overtures to Andrew Bynum. “It’s not ‘signed’ signed,” Cuban said of the contract with Dalembert. “But it’s agreed upon.”\n\nThe Knicks are interested in one of the best centers still available in free agency, Samuel Dalembert, according to a player source. On Friday, the first day of the NBA summer league at UNLV’s Cox Pavilion, Knicks GM Glen Grunwald and Dalembert’s agent, Marc Cornstein, were spotted chatting."
