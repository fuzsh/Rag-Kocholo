Talent developer. Program changer. Patrick Devaney, Sr. '12, was appointed as the 15th head coach in New Jersey City University women's basketball history in June 2018. At the time, he took over a team that went 0-21 in 2017-18. My how things have changed. In just five years, Devaney has turned the Gothic Knights into one of the most feared NCAA Division III programs in the region. In his second season, Devaney led Jersey City to its first berth into the New Jersey Athletic Conference (NJAC) Tournament since 1988-89. NJCU then secured its first NJAC Tournament win in program history. In 2020-21, the Green and Gold ran off three straight victories to claim the program's first NJAC Championship in history. In 2021-22, the Gothic Knights simply ran it back and claimed their second consecutive NJAC Title, as well as the program's first-ever trip to the NCAA Division III Women's Basketball Championship. In 2022-23, the Green and Gold had the most NJAC wins in program history (14) and captured the program's first-ever NJAC Regular-Season Title en route to a third straight berth in the conference tournament championship game.\n\nDevaney has established a culture through hard work and by challenging his players with the best competition he can find. In fact, in four of his first five seasons, he has scheduled two-time national champion and nationally-ranked ranked Amherst, a school most others are afraid to face. NJCU hosted the Mammoths in New Jersey in 2018-19 and 2022-23 and headed to Massachusetts in 2019-20 and 2021-22. His willingness to play anyone, anywhere, anytime also saw eventual-national championship Christopher Newport come to the JMAC in 2023, as well as another national championship-caliber opponent —Tufts. He also continually schedules Division I opponents for preseason exhibitions and regular-season games.\n\n2022-23: After a slow start to the season, which saw NJCU begin at 2-7 overall, the Gothic Knights finished the regular-season with 12 victories over 14 games — with one of those losses coming out of conference against eventual national champion CNU — en route to the #1 seed in the NJAC Tournament, as well as the first Regular-Season Conference Championship in program history. NJCU reached the championship game for the third consecutive season before falling in the final. The team then proceeded to qualify for the ECAC Tournament for the second time in program history (first since 1988-89) and finish as the championship runner-up.\n\nIndividually, standout point guard Damaris Rodriguez had one of the greatest statistical seasons in the history of Division III, finishing as the eventual scoring champion with 24.3 points per game. Rodriguez, who earned All-America honors from D3hoops.com and the WBCA, was also fourth in the nation with 6.4 assists per game. She was also selected as the NJAC Player of the Year, the ECAC Player of the Year, as well as All-Met DIII Player of the Year (for the second time) among many other accolades. She enters 2023-24 with 1,358 points and still has two years of NCAA eligibility remaining.\n\n2021-22: With a target squarely painted on the backs of the Gothic Knights, NJCU was no longer in a position to surprise anyone with a championship run. However, despite injuries and other set backs throughout the season, Devaney guided his team to a 9-9 campaign in NJAC play en route to securing the #6 seed in the NJAC tournament – the Gothic Knights’ third-straight berth to the league tournament. He started off the season by scheduling Division I Saint Peter’s University in a season-opening scrimmage and battled then-#9 Tufts and then-#10 Amherst on the road during the season in extremely tight matchups.\n\nOnce the postseason began, NJCU drew #3 seed Montclair State and – despite falling behind by as many as 10 points – came back to win the quarterfinal game in buzzer-beating fashion on the road, 68-67, on February 22, 2022. In the semifinal round, the Gothic Knights controlled the game throughout and defeated #2 Rowan on the road, 83-79, on February 24, 2022. For the first time in program history, NJCU earned the right to host the NJAC Championship game, which was against #8-seed TCNJ at the JMAC on February 26, 2022. In a defensive battle, the Gothic Knights topped the Lions, 58-52, to claim their second straight NJAC Title and earn the program’s first-ever berth to the NCAA Division III Women’s Basketball Championship.\n\nIndividual, co-captains then-sophomore Damaris Rodriguez and then-junior Laney Fox led the squad with a multitude of awards. Rodriguez was a Preseason D3hoops.com All-America selection and finished the year as a First Team selection by D3hoops.com (All-Region), All-Met, All-ECAC and All-NJAC. She was also named the recipient of NJCU’s Individual Performance of the Year and Most Outstanding Female Athlete of the Year. Fox was a Second Team All-NJAC selection, was named NJCU’s Female Newcomer of the Year and was a two-time weekly honoree by both the MBWA and NJAC.\n\n2020-21: This was a season filled with challenges, however Devaney did not let that effect his program – if anything, the Gothic Knights thrived under his direction. Jersey City faced only NJAC opponents during this season and kicked it off with the best start in program history, winning its first six games to start 6-0. After a couple of tough losses to Montclair State – which would stick in the back of the minds of Devaney and all his players – NJCU earned its second straight berth to the NJAC Tournament, this time as the #3 seed.\n\nThe Gothic Knights hosted the program’s first-ever home NJAC Tournament game, topping William Paterson, 68-60, on March 5, 2021, at the JMAC. NJCU then upset #2-seeded TCNJ on the road in the semifinal, 73-63, on March 12, 2021, to advance further than any team in program history – the NJAC Championship game. After some delays, Jersey City got its third and final match-up with top-seeded Montclair State on the road. Fueled by two tough regular-season losses, the Gothic Knights did the unimaginable – they took down the Red Hawks, 64-60, for the first time ever on the road to win the first NJAC Title in NJCU women’s basketball history!\n\nThe postseason was filled with mass amounts of awards as Devaney himself was named Coach of the Year by the NJAC, the Metropolitan Basketball Writers Association (All-Met Division III Coach of the Year) and D3hoops.com All-Atlantic/Mid-Atlantic Region Coach of the Year. Additionally, then-freshman and captain Rodriguez was selected to the NJAC First Team as well as the conference’s Rookie of the Year. She was also a First Team selection by both the MBWA and D3hoops.com All-Region and was named Player of the Year and Rookie of the Year, respectively. Rodriguez was also named NJCU’s Female Newcomer and Most Outstanding Athlete of the Year. Joining her on the All-NJAC team was fellow First Team selection senior Dayjah Anderson and Second Team honoree, then-freshman Nahjeemah Holmes.\n\n2019-20: Devaney guided the Gothic Knights to their first NJAC Tournament appearance in 31 years. Qualifying alone wasn’t enough. Devaney led NJCU to its first-ever NJAC Tournament victory on February 22, 2020 when it upended Kean on the road in the Quarterfinals, 59-58, before falling in the semifinals. Two years removed from 0-21, Devaney was runner-up for NJAC Coach of the Year honors. Overall, the Knights went 9-9 in the NJAC, including a school record 6-3 NJAC regular season road mark—not including the playoff road victory—and 13-14 overall, including a loss to the then-#1 ranked team in the country (Amherst). NJCU accomplished this despite a roster that was not at full strength due to injuries and other factors. The previous single-season record for NJAC road wins was three.\n\nIn his second season, then-junior transfers Anderson and Ayanna Lewis were each voted Honorable Mention All-NJAC and Anderson was a two-time NJAC Player of the Week selection. Devaney added 11 additional players to the roster prior to the 2019-20 season, including then-freshman Sarah Edmond, who was a two-time NJAC Rookie of the Week selection.\n\n2018-19: In his first season, despite starting in the summer with limited time to recruit, he was able to land two prized transfers from Kean in twin sisters Marajiah and Miesha Bacon. Marajiah Bacon was named First Team All-NJAC, First Team All-Met and Second Team D3hoops.com All-Region. A three-time NJAC Player of the Week and two-time D3hoops.com National Team of the Week selection, she finished her career as the all-time leading scorer in the history of the NJAC with 2,161 points—30th in Division III history. Marajiah scored a single-game school record 46 points against Pratt in January 10, 2019, and notched two triple-doubles that year, becoming the first Gothic Knight with more than one triple double ever. She was named NJCU’s first-ever Most Outstanding Female Athlete of the Year, first-ever Female Newcomer of the Year and first-ever winner of the Individual Performance of the Year. Her sister Miesha was named NJAC Player of the Week and to the D3hoops.com National Team of the Week for the first time in her career.\n\nWhat They’re Saying at NJCU | Coach Pat Devaney, Sr.\n\n“I really believe his hunger and desire, his loyalty and commitment to the school and to the athletic department, was what separated him from the other candidates. He was a feisty player who often played for me injured. He’s a local guy, a great recruiter and I think he’s going to do a great job bringing talent in and bringing good student-athletes in. I’m looking forward to working with him.”\n\n• Marc Brown, NJCU head men’s basketball coach/hiring committee chair\n\n“It is with great excitement that we announce Pat Devaney as the next leader of the NJCU women’s basketball program. During the interview process, Pat emerged from a deep pool of talent. His passion for the sport of basketball and for using it as a tool to impact the lives of student-athletes, his deep-rooted love for NJCU and his enthusiasm to shift the culture of the women’s basketball program were all evident. Pat has a deep knowledge of NJCU, the NJAC and New Jersey basketball, and is a strong recruiter with a clear vision for the future of the program. Pat is a shining example of how NJCU athletics can forever transform the lives of its student-athletes. We welcome him back to the NJCU family.”\n\n• Shawn Tucker, then-NJCU Associate Vice President/Director of Athletics\n\n“Pat Devaney is a NJCU success story. We are committed as an institution to transform lives and Pat’s appointment as our new women’s basketball coach speaks to NJCU’s ability to empower individuals to become leaders. His passion for our University and the sport of basketball will serve our student-athletes well and I anticipate a revival of our women’s basketball program under his leadership.”\n\n• Dr. Sue Henderson, NJCU President\n\nVice Chair of NCAA Board of Governors\n\nChair of Division III Presidents Council\n\nDevaney, a former men’s basketball student-athlete and women’s basketball assistant coach, took over a program that had fallen upon hard times and in year one began building the Gothic Knights back up. On December 10, 2018, he led NJCU to a come-from-behind win over Saint Elizabeth to snap a 42-game losing streak over three seasons. On January 5, 2019, Devaney’s team upended Stockton, 68-67, to halt a 58-game conference losing streak and beat Stockton for the first time in Jersey City in 20 years.\n\n“It has been a dream of mine to be the head coach at my alma mater,” Devaney stated. “I would like to thank our athletic director Shawn Tucker, and the search committee, for believing in me and my vision for the program. NJCU deserves a women’s basketball program that will represent the University proudly, both on and off the court, and we will accomplish that while providing meaningful experiences to our student-athletes, enhancing their skills and values in life through basketball.”\n\nDevaney served as the program’s assistant coach for three seasons from 2012-15. He proved to be a strong recruiter, highlighted by the addition of Bria Smith, who was named the first Gothic Knight since 1994 voted NJAC Rookie of the Year and was named the 2014 D3hoops.com Atlantic Region Rookie of the Year. Smith later was tabbed one of the 10 best freshmen in NCAA Division III with selection to the Women's DIII News national All-Freshman Team. A year later, Smith was voted First Team All-NJAC.\n\nIn August 2013, Devaney founded the Rising Stars Basketball Academy and has served as its head skills coach. Among the athletes he customized instruction programs for were 35 who went on to play college basketball. He also trained more than a dozen professional basketball players.\n\nPrior to NJCU, he served as an assistant boys’ basketball coach for powerhouse St. Patrick’s High School in Elizabeth, NJ—now called The Patrick School.\n\nDevaney added: “As a basketball coach, my priority is to develop a program that will ultimately lead to the personal and athletic growth of each student-athlete and overall improved performance of the team. I will foster the growth of my student-athletes, molding a group of individuals to communicate, to be responsible and to hold themselves accountable. I am a coach because of my love and passion for the game. I believe in nurturing their dreams to be the best on and off the court. Above all, I am a teacher of the game of basketball and of life skills.”\n\nMore recently, Devaney has also coached on the AAU level, guiding the 6th Borough Girls 16U program since April 2017. His introduction to coaching came in 2011-12 when he coached a seventh grade AAU team, the Jersey City Heat. He previously was a counselor at the Atlantic Cape Basketball Camp in Williamstown, NJ from 2000-03 and has worked with the Jersey City Boys and Girls Club and Bayonne PAL camps.\n\nWhile previously at NJCU as an assistant basketball coach, Devaney also served two years as the school’s head men’s and women’s cross country coach from 2013-14.\n\nDevaney, a 2012 graduate of NJCU with a degree in Criminal Justice, was a highly decorated high school basketball player, before his collegiate career was derailed by a serious elbow injury suffered in a 2007 summer league game that later required two surgeries. He transferred to NJCU midway through the 2007-08 season and played in 45 games over two and a half seasons for current men’s head coach Marc Brown, completing his career in 2009-10. Devaney began his collegiate career at Union County College (2004-05), where he was voted First Team All-NJCAA and was a team captain under Coach Jim Catalano. He ranked in the top 50 in the nation in assists. He later attended Richard Stockton College (now Stockton University) and Hudson County Community College, where he was on the Dean’s List, before NJCU became home.\n\nA productive reserve point guard for the Gothic Knights, Brown described him as “a true point guard who can run a team, a great ball-handler and a real leader on the floor.”\n\nA 2003 graduate of St. Augustine Prep in Richland, N.J. (Atlantic County), where he played his final two seasons for Coach Paul Rodio, Devaney helped lead the Hermits to the 2002 Parochial South A state championship, defeating Camden Catholic High School 50-45. He was ranked among the Top 100 high school players in the United States in 2003, and No. 25 among players in New Jersey and New York, averaging 16 points and seven assists per game. A First Team All-Cape May and Atlantic County (CAL) and Third Team All-State selection, he was selected to play in the prestigious Eastern Invitational Camp Top 20 All-Star game.\n\nAt St. Augustine, he was a high school teammate of former Washington Wizards player and 2012 British Olympian Pops Mensah-Bonsu, who played for six NBA teams and internationally. Devaney also played against such New Jersey and New York high school standouts as Dajuan Wagner, Sebastian Telfair, Eddie Griffin, Ben Gordon and Sam Dalembert—all of whom made the NBA.\n\nDevaney played his first two seasons of prep basketball at Marist High School in Bayonne, N.J. for Coach Chris Chevannes. There, he helped the Royal Knights win the 2000 Hudson County championship—defeating Dickinson in the final—and a state title.\n\nPerhaps his most notable AAU honors was an invitation to play in the 2000 Adidas ABCD Camp. Devaney also played for the Playaz Basketball Club, one of the top AAU teams in the country.\n\nDevaney, 40, resides in Bayonne, N.J. with his wife, Kelly, and their three sons: PJ (5), DJ (3) and JJ (2).\n\nOverall Conference Year W L W L Postseason 2018-19 5 20 2 16 2019-20 13 14 9 9 NJAC Tournament (Semifinals) 2020-21 9 2 6 2 NJAC Tournament (Champions) 2021-22 13 10 9 9 NJAC Tournament (Champions)\n\nNCAA Tournament (First Round) 2022-23 17 12 14 4 NJAC Regular-Season Championships\n\nNJAC Tournament (Runner-Up)\n\nECAC Championship (Runner-Up) Overall 40 46 26 36\n\nWHAT COACHES and PLAYERS ARE SAYING ABOUT PAT DEVANEY, Sr.\n\n\"Patrick Devaney, a former player of mine at Marist High School in 1998, was truly exception. His passion for the game was unmatched, especially during an era when basketball was played in a more conservative manner. Patrick's style of play was ahead of its time, showcasing his dynamic abilities that would have undoubtedly made him a superstar in today's game. It comes as no surprise that in 2018, he was named head women's coach of NJCU. Patrick continues to approach coaching with the same dynamism, intelligence and unwavering passion that defined his playing career.\"\n\n—Coach Chris Chavannes, former Marist High School Head Coach\n\nHead Coach, The Patrick School\n\n\"Pat Devaney is a proven winner. As a player, he had the ability to make the people around him better. He also had the ability to make the crucial play at the critical time. The bigger the game, the better he performed. As a coach, Pat strives to get the best out of his players, and he approaches his daily duties as a coach with the same intensity as he did in his playing days.\"\n\n—Coach Jack Hladik, former Bayonne High School Head Coach\n\n“I've known Pat since he was in the 9th grade. He would attend my camps each summer and one thing was clear—he loved to play and he loved to work on his ball handling and basketball skills. Pat was the kid who was constantly on the court and always talking basketball; it has always been his passion. Pat has played on some very good high school teams and played under accomplished high school and AAU coaches. Also, he has one of the highest basketball IQs, that I have ever been around. He has played at a very high level and I think all of these experiences in basketball has given him great insight and knowledge of the game. His hard work on the court paid off, as he was ranked one of the top 100 players in the country. He was highly recruited by big time Division I programs and won numerous championships. It has been a privilege to train and coach him, and be apart of his growth into the coaching world.”\n\n—Rich Marcucci, Atlantic Cape Camp founder, co-Owner of Adrenaline Sports and Director of Scotland Sports Institute (Prep School)\n\n“I coached Pat his freshman year at Union County College. We recruited him from Murray State College in Tishomingo, Oklahoma. Pat was a point guard that just controlled the floor and demanded the best from his teammates. He made coaching that much easier, as he was a coach on the floor. We called him the “floor general”. He was a player who made everyone's job easier and made the team around him better. He played a huge part in being the catalyst to our championship run. He had amazing ball handle, unlimited shooting range, great court vision, and was as tough as they come. I have been coaching 20-plus years and he will go down as one of my best point guards. As a coach, I know he will be successful just because he is a leader, and can teach the game. He also has a high basketball IQ that is very rare now a days.”\n\n—Jim Catalano, Former Coach at NJIT and Union County College\n\n“Pat's basketball training was really intense and not of the norm. He knew all the weak parts of my game like ball handling and we got right to business. He has drills that many other trainers and coaches do not implement or have in their arsenal. The drills are very challenging, and pushes you to your limits. As a coach, he has all the tools to develop skills and make players better.”\n\n—Dominic Cheeks, former St. Anthony's High School McDonald's All-American and Villanova University star; current professional basketball player in the National Basketball League (NBL) in Australia\n\n“Pat was a coach on the floor, who made everyone around him better. But, what I liked the best about him was his attitude, and his approach to the game. I loved coaching him! I believe he has all the tools to be a great coach, and be very successful in this profession.”\n\n—Paul Rodio, Head Coach, St. Augustine Prep; All-Time Winningest Coach in South Jersey (900+ wins)\n\n“He was one of my favorite players to coach in my 30-year career. He played with great passion and energy and left it all out on the court. I often tell my current teams about Pat, using him as an example of how they should play every day. As a coach, I can only imagine the kind of success he will have. I believe the sky is the limit for him.”\n\n—Louis Abbattista, former St. Augustine Prep Assistant Coach and current Camden County College Head Men's Basketball Coach"
