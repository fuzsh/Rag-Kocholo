        "text": "The girlfriend, who has 8- and 1-year-old children with Dalembert, and her cousin initially told police nothing was wrong but later admitted “they did not want Dalembert to know they called 911 because they were scared what he might do to them,” the report said. Dalembert became upset after finding out that his girlfriend was leaving for Orlando with their two children.\n\nStoryline: Samuel Dalembert Arrest\n\nThe woman had an abrasion on her chin, a swollen lip, a small bruise on her forehead and an abrasion to her left shoulder, the report said. She told police that Dalembert has been “drinking excessively” and “not acting like his normal self” recently. The woman’s cousin said he had to intervene to keep Dalembert from striking her, the report said. Dalembert then allegedly attacked the 26-year-old man, grabbing him by the neck and putting him in a choke hold, throwing him to the ground and head-butting him, the report said."
