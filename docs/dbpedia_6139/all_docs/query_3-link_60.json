        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\nFor Jorge de Sá a escrita é a minha primeira morada de silêncio a segunda irrompe do corpo movendo-se por trás das palavras —Al Berto, O medo, 25 [writing is my ﬁrst home of silence the second bursts from the body, moving behind the words] Poet Al Berto (the pseudonym of Alberto Raposo Pidwell Tavares) is a foundational ﬁgure in the emergence of a “queer” literature in Portugal. Al Berto’s poetic work is the product of a “literary series” in which a gay male subjectivity has traditionally appeared as a marginalized and invisible ﬁgure in its diﬀerence vis-à-vis mainstream culture.1 However, the notion of “queer” implies not only a marginalized gay subjectivity, but also a way of being in the world, which, by virtue of its diﬀerence, is capable of adopting a critical stance in relationship to mainstream culture (see Jagose). Thus, my appropriation of the term queer will have political implications for the analysis of Portuguese literature, where canonical criticism has completely ignored the subject of homosexuality. This essay aims to advance some theoretical hypotheses regarding the possibility of culturally translating the term queer for Portugal and Brazil, establish the place of Al Berto’s poetry within the realm of Portuguese literature, and analyze various paradigmatic poems by Al Berto, C H A P T E R F O U R T E E N Al Berto, In Memoriam The Luso Queer Principle Mário César Lugarinho Translated by Fernando Arenas and Leonardo Mendes 276 as they reﬂect the passage from a “gay” to a “queer” sensibility and their implications for the understanding of Portuguese culture. To Become: Gay Poetry in Portugal It is necessary to use the labels gay and queer when discussing the contours of Portuguese poetry throughout the twentieth century. However, it is also necessary to establish the diﬀerentiating nuances between these two terms. Thus, we must distinguish between an earlier gay male poetry that thematizes the desire between a male subject and a male object and a more contemporary queer poetry based on the identity of a subject who politically revindicates his or her diﬀerence, as well as place, in history. Between these two discursive poles regarding homosexuality in the West, there is a path traversed by poets who developed a most singular craft of disguising and unveiling identity when encountering the other. Fernando Pessoa and Mário de Sá-Carneiro, together with António Botto, are considered the ﬁrst Portuguese poets in the twentieth century to discuss homosexuality.2 In Pessoa and Sá-Carneiro we ﬁnd the male subject’s dislocation to unusual places within poetic discourse, in a free association of endless signifying possibilities as he attempts to linguistically deﬁne himself. In the case of Pessoa, this poetic practice results in the creation of “heteronyms” (or literary personalities), which entails a discursive dynamic where multiple meanings ﬂourish and crisscross. Yet, within this complex ontological and semiotic web, we can still surmise a few governing principles for the purposes of interpretation. In the poetry of heteronym Álvaro de Campos, for instance, we ﬁnd some of the most explicit examples of a nascent gay poetic discourse.3 For example , in “Passagem das Horas” (Time’s passage) we see: Os braços de todos os atletas apertaram-me subitamente feminino E só de pensar nisso desmaiei em músculos supostos (Pessoa 1993: 224) [The arms of every athlete have squeezed my suddenly female self, And the mere thought made me faint in imagined muscles] (Pessoa 1998: 147) Fui todos os ascetas, todos os posto-de-parte, todos os como que esquecidos. E todos os pederastas—absolutamente todos (não faltou nenhum). Al Berto, In Memoriam 277 [167.71.63.233] Project MUSE (2024-08-29 11:37 GMT) Rendez-vous a vermelho e negro no fundo-inferno da minha alma! (Freddie eu chamava-te Baby, porque tu eras louro branco eu amava-te, Quantas imperatrizes por reinar e princesas destronadas tu foste para mim!) (Pessoa 1993: 224) [I was every ascetic, every outcast, every forgotten man, And every pederast—absolutely every last one of them. Black and red rendezvous in the hell of my soul’s depths! (Freddie, whom I called Baby, because you were blond, fair, and I loved you, How many future empresses and dethroned princesses you were to me!] (Pessoa 1998: 147–48) In this poem, we observe a stream of consciousness that reﬂects the poet’s dismemberment.
