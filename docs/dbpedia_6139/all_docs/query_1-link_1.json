        "text": "Mário de Sá-Carneiro (born May 19, 1890, Lisbon, Port.—died April 26, 1916, Paris, France) was a poet and novelist, one of the most original and complex figures of the Portuguese Modernist movement.\n\nSá-Carneiro studied in Paris at the Sorbonne. His first poems, Dispersão (“Dispersion”), were written in Paris and published in 1914. In the same year he published a novel, A Confissão de Lúcio (Lúcio’s Confession), and back in Portugal he launched the revue Orpheu in 1915 in collaboration with Fernando Pessoa, the greatest literary figure of the generation and a long-time friend and mentor to Sá-Carneiro. Returning to Paris, Sá-Carneiro suffered a moral and financial crisis, abandoned his studies, quarreled with his father, and gave himself up to the life of a literary bohemian. The crisis came to a head in 1916 when he committed suicide. Before his death, he sent his unpublished poems to Pessoa, and these appeared in 1937 under the title Indicios de Oiro (“Traces of Gold”)."
