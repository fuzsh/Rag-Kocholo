        "text": "Sa-Carneiro, Mario de.\n\nSa-Carneiro, Mario de (b. May 19, 1890, Lisbon, Port.--d. April 26, 1916, Paris, Fr.)\n\nPoet and novelist, one of the most original and complex figures of the Portuguese modernist movement.\n\nSa-Carneiro studied in Paris at the Sorbonne. His first poems, Dispersao (\"Dispersion\"), were written in Paris and published in 1914. In the same year he published a novel, A confissao de Lucio (\"The Confession of Lucio\"). Back in Portugal he launched the revue Orpheu in 1915 in collaboration with Fernando Pessoa, the greatest literary figure of the generation and a longtime friend and mentor. Returning to Paris, Sa-Carneiro suffered a moral and financial crisis and eventually committed suicide. Before his death, he sent his unpublished poems to Pessoa, and these appeared in 1937 under the title Indicios de oiro (\"Traces of Gold\")."
