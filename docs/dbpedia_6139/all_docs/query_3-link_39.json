        "text": "April 2, 2018\n\nThe Ambiguity of a Suicide is a fictional story about Mario’s suicide. Fernando Pessoa seeks answers about his friend’s choice of death. While he pursues answers with investigators, this story then takes a different and interesting turn. The three characters start an adventure traveling in order to find out why Pessoa poisoned himself.\n\nThis is the second book I have read by this author. The Ambiguity of Imagination resembled a very dissimilar and interesting tale yet, this story made all the difference with its unsuspected descriptiveness and principle characters.\n\nThere was a certain rhythmic quality to the work which stood out for me. I believe the author has potential to create really good work. I had some concerns when I realized that the story was translated. In most cases, the essence and foundation of the story are lost in translated works. However, that disconnection did not occur with this work.\n\nThe author creates works that are not necessarily trending in the mainstream of things and that, I think, makes his book stand out and differ from the rest.\n\nI recommend this book to fiction readers."
