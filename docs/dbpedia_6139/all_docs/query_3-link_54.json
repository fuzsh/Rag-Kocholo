        "text": "IV\n\nThis afternoon the thunder rolled\n\nDown the slopes of the sky\n\nLike an enormous boulder . . .\n\nLike someone at a high window\n\nShaking out a table cloth,\n\nAnd the crumbs, falling together,\n\nMake a little noise as they fall,\n\nThe rain rained down from the sky\n\nBlackening the roads . . .\n\nWhen the lightning made the air tremble\n\nAnd everything shook\n\nLike a mighty head saying No,\n\nI don’t know why—I wasn’t afraid—\n\nI started praying to Saint Barbara\n\nAs if I were someone’s aged aunt . . .\n\nAh, because praying to Saint Barbara\n\nWould make me feel even simpler\n\nThan I think I am . . .\n\nWould make me feel familiar and homely,\n\nHaving spent my life\n\nTranquilly, listening to the kettle boil,\n\nAnd having parents older than me.\n\nAnd doing so as if I had flowered like that.\n\nI felt like someone who could believe in Saint Barbara . . .\n\nAh, to be able to believe in Saint Barbara!\n\n(Will anyone who believes there is a Saint Barbara\n\nThink she’s an actual person and visible\n\nOr what will he think exactly?)\n\n(How artificial! What do\n\nThe flowers, the trees, the flocks know\n\nOf Saint Barbara? . . . The branch of a tree,\n\nIf it could think, would never\n\nInvent saints or angels . . .\n\nIt might think that the sun\n\nGives light and that a thunderstorm\n\nIs a sudden loud noise\n\nThat begins with a flash . . .\n\nAh, how the simplest of men\n\nAre sick and confused and stupid\n\nCompared with the clear simplicity\n\nAnd sheer health in existing\n\nOf the trees and the plants!)\n\nAnd thinking all this,\n\nI again felt less happy . . .\n\nFelt somber and sallow and gloomy\n\nLike a day when all day the thunder threatens\n\nBut still hasn’t arrived by nightfall . . .\n\nIX\n\nI am a keeper of sheep.\n\nThe sheep are my thoughts\n\nAnd my thoughts are all sensations.\n\nI think with my eyes and my ears\n\nAnd with my hands and feet\n\nAnd with my nose and mouth.\n\nTo think a flower is to see it and smell it\n\nAnd to eat a fruit is to know its meaning.\n\nThat’s why on a warm day\n\nI feel sad because I enjoy it so much,\n\nAnd stretching out on the grass,\n\nAnd closing my hot eyes,\n\nI feel my whole body lying stretched out on reality,\n\nI know the truth and I am happy.\n\nXIII\n\nLightly, lightly, very lightly,\n\nA very light wind passes,\n\nThen departs, still very lightly.\n\nAnd I don’t know what I’m thinking\n\nNor do I try to know.\n\nXX\n\nThe Tejo is more beautiful than the river that runs through my village,\n\nBut the Tejo is not more beautiful than the river that runs through my village\n\nBecause the Tejo is not the river that runs through my village.\n\nBig ships sail the Tejo\n\nAnd on it still sails, at least\n\nIn the eyes of those who see in all things what isn’t there,\n\nThe memory of the caravels.\n\nThe Tejo comes down from Spain\n\nAnd the Tejo enters the sea in Portugal.\n\nEveryone knows that.\n\nBut very few know the name of the river in my village\n\nAnd where it goes\n\nAnd where it comes from.\n\nAnd because of that, because it belongs to fewer people,\n\nIt is freer and bigger the river in my village.\n\nThe Tejo leads out into the world.\n\nBeyond lie the Americas\n\nAnd the fortunes of those who find them.\n\nNo one has ever thought about what lies beyond\n\nThe river in my village.\n\nThe river in my village doesn’t provoke any thoughts.\n\nAnyone who stands next to it is simply there.\n\nXLIX\n\nI go inside, and shut the window.\n\nThey bring the lamp and bid me goodnight,\n\nAnd my contented voice bids them goodnight too.\n\nIf only my life could always be this:\n\nThe day full of sun or bright with rain,\n\nOr else stormy as if it were the end of the world,\n\nThe gentle evening, passing groups of people\n\nObserved with interest from my window.\n\nA last friendly glance at the tranquil trees,\n\nAnd then, with the window shut, the lamp lit,\n\nWithout reading anything, or thinking anything, or sleeping,\n\nFeeling life flow through me like a river along its riverbed,\n\nAnd there, outside, a great silence like a sleeping god.\n\ntranslated from the Portuguese by Margaret Jull Costa and Patricio Ferrari"
