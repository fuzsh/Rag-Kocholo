But am I the same Me who lived here, and returned here,\n\nAnd who returned here again, and again,\n\nAnd who returned here again?\n\nOr are we, all the Mes that I or they were here,\n\nJust a series of stories-cum-beings linked by a thread of memory,\n\nA series of dreams of me dreamed by someone outside of me?\n\nAgain I see you,\n\nWith my more distant heart, with my less-than-mine soul.\n\nAgain I see you—Lisbon and the Tejo and everything—\n\nA random passerby in you and in me,\n\nA foreigner here as everywhere,\n\nAs incidental in my life as in my soul,\n\nA phantom wandering rooms of recollections,\n\nTo the sounds of the mice gnawing and the floorboards creaking\n\nIn the accursed castle of having to live...\n\nAgain I see you,\n\nA shadow that passes through other shadows, and shines\n\nFor a moment in a gloomy, unfamiliar light,\n\nThen enters the night like the wake of a ship disappearing\n\nOff over waters that can no longer be heard..."
