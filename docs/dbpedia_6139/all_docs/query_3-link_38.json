        "text": "Sorry about the lack of post last week. As we mentioned on Facebook, our modem broke rendering us internet-less and our Book Beacon writer was away sick for a short while during the week. But here we are with a new writer to recommend this time one from Portugal, Mario de Sá-Carneiro.\n\nPortuguese literature is interesting because despite being part of Europe, Portugal’s place on the far side of Spain, facing away from the rest of Europe and towards Atlantic, gives it an air of isolation and slight obscurity. Although many renowned Portuguese writers such as Fernando Pessoa or José Maria de Eça de Queirós were part of movements and styles that were in vogue in Europe during their time, they were more inclined to experimentation than their contemporaries at the center of Europe. This is especially true in the case of de Sá-Carneiro.\n\nDe Sá-Carneiro was a poet and fiction writer born in Lisbon in 1890. From a young age he absorbed himself in literature, writing poetry and translating works by Goethe and Victor Hugo, before enrolling in law at the University of Coimbra in 1911. While studying he met and became close friends with Pessoa, who introduced de Sá-Carneiro to a clique of like-minded writers and artists in Lisbon. Together they formed a literay journal Orpheau, which published experimental and subversive modernist-style writing and art.\n\nAfter a short while at Coimbra, he moved to Paris and enrolled at the Sorbonne University where he ignored his studies and immersed himself in the art and theater scene. However, this new life fell apart for de Sá-Carniero before too long. World War One broke out over Europe and France was invaded in late August 1914. Financial difficulties plagued de Sá-Carneiro and Orpheau, which was subsequently abandoned after two issues, and he soon found himself falling into a spiral of depression. Shortly thereafter, overcome by fears of insanity, he sent his last, unpublished poems to Pessoa and killed himself by swallowing strychnine on 26 April 1916 at the age of just 25.\n\nThroughout his time in Lisbon and Paris, de Sá-Carneiro was a prolific poet and author. His work delves into themes of madness and sickness, and sometimes has a strong homosexual undercurrent. The writing style is somewhere between the realism of the mid to late nineteenth century, popularised by authors such as Gustave Flaubert, Emile Zola and Eça de Queirós, and the surrealism which swept across Europe only a few years after de Sá-Carneiro’s death. Lucio’s Confession, which was published in 1914, deals with these themes and his see-saw between realism and surrealism.\n\nThis short novel begins with the narrator, known simply as Lucio, speaking of his many years in prison and his attempt to finally piece together the crime of which he accepted guilt for, despite never really being sure of whether he committed it. As the novel progresses, Lucio meets and develops a friendship with a young poet Ricardo de Loureiro and falls in love with his wife Marta. However, reality starts losing its grip, and Lucio struggles to tell Ricardo and Marta apart, confusing his feelings for Marta as they blur into the same person and fade in and out of Lucio’s mind. Lucio’s Confession is an intense read as Lucio slips further and further into madness and suffers from the same insecurities and anxieties that plagued de Sá-Carneiro:\n\n“Besides, as I remarked earlier, my pains, anxieties and obsessions were intermittent, they came and went, just as during times of social unrest, daily life goes on amidst the canon shot and the shooting in the squares, so I went on with my intellectual life in the midst of my torment. That is precisely why up until then I had succeeded in hiding from everyone the tribulations of my soul.”\n\nUnfortunately, very little by de Sá-Carneiro has been translated into English. Dedalus, a publisher which specializes in unusual European fiction, publishes two works by him: Lucio’s Confession and The Great Shadow and Other Stories, as well as some more of his writing in an anthology called The Dedalus Book of Portuguese Fantasy. However, he has many more works published in Portuguese, including a collection of 12 novels Céu Em Fogo and a poetry collection Dispersão. I’m hoping that these will be translated into English sometime in the near future.\n\nThat’s all for this week. Regrettably there won’t be a Book Beacon next week, as I’m going away for Easter. But we’ll see you again hopefully the week after next. Remember, if you can think of an under-appreciated writer we could write about let us know, and we’ll look them up x"
