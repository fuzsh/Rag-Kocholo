Gagauzia Bashkan Irina Vlah sent a letter to Moldovan Speaker of the Parliament Andrian Candu and Prime Minister Pavel Filip with a proposal to lower tariffs on natural gas for the population.

The document says that the purchasing price on the Russian blue fuel fell by 21% over the last time, while the US dollar exchange rate fell 19% against the Moldovan leu.

In her opinion, the republic’s Parliament should initiate the re-calculation of gas tariffs for ultimate consumers inasmuch as the expenditures on heating in winter is an important component of life support for most citizens.

Vlah informed the Speaker and the Premier that recently the society and the Gagauz people are permanently raising the issue about the unreasonably high tariffs on natural gas.

Bashkan reminded to the officials that the agency responsible for tariffs – the National Energy Regulatory Agency (ANRE), is accountable to the Moldovan Parliament.

“The last change of tariffs in Moldova took place two years ago. Back then, they were based on the cost of purchasing 1 thousand cubic meters of gas for US$190 at the exchange rate of 21 leu per US$1. Today, the purchasing price for the same amount of gas is US$150, while the US dollar exchange rate is 17 lei. It is obvious that now there are all the conditions to re-calculate downwards the price on natural gas for consumers”, Vlah wrote in her letter.

According to her, this may become a stimulus for improving the country citizens’ wellbeing and the socio-economic situation.
