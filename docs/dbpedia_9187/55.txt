The Governor of the National Bank (NBM), Octavian Armasu has called the Moldovan leu “a symbol of sovereignty and an element of Moldovans' identity.” He said this at a solemn event on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the introduction of the national currency of the Republic of Moldova - Moldovan leu into circulation.

"The efforts of successive NBM executives and the entire team of the bank have made a decisive contribution to the transformation of the financial sector into a stable, efficient and sustainable sector, fulfilling the commitments undertaken within the framework of the Moldova-EU Association Agreement. The NBM is distinguished by its outstanding team and unwavering commitment to its core objective," Isarescu emphasized.
