The NBM is distinguished by its outstanding team and unwavering commitment to its core objective,\" Isarescu emphasized.\n\nOn the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the introduction of the Moldovan leu into circulation, the NBM was congratulated by high-ranking representatives of the International Monetary Fund - Paul Hilbers, Executive Director of the IMF, Mark Horton, Deputy Director of the IMF's European Department, who arrived in Chisinau at the invitation of the NBM leadership."
