        "text": "People\n\nAbout 50 percent of the people are native Moldovans, who are ethnically related to the Romanians. More ethnic Moldovans inhabit the center and north of the republic rather than the south, and they account for about four fifths of all rural inhabitants. As recent newcomers to the cities, they represent only one third of all urban inhabitants. The two other major ethnic groups, Ukrainians and Russians, are mostly city dwellers who settled in Moldova after World War II. Bulgarians and the Gagauz are also present in Moldova in significant numbers. The Gagauz are a rural people of Turkic ancestry who have lived in the Bugeac Plain area of southern Moldova since the late 18th century. That area, referred to as Gagauzia, is recognized by the Moldovan government as an autonomous region.\n\nBecause of its rich soils and intensive development, Moldova supports a higher density of population than any surrounding nation. The majority of the people live in villages that are generally large and mostly supplied with electricity. Transportation facilities are well established. Air transport links Moldova with other parts of Eastern Europe. Chișinău (also known as Kishinev, its Russian name), the capital city, is the largest industrial center of the nation and a major railway, air, and motor transport center. Other prominent cities are Tiraspol, Bălți (Beltsy), and Tighina (Bendery).\n\nHistorically, the majority of the people in Moldova have been affiliated with the Eastern Orthodox religion. Most of those belonging to the Eastern Orthodox church are either Romanian Orthodox or Russian Orthodox. The collapse of the atheistic Soviet Union was followed by a general revival of organized religion in Moldova.\n\nTen years of schooling is compulsory for children. Due in large part to educational reforms made during the Soviet era, more than 98 percent of the people 15 years of age and over can read and write. There are several institutions of higher learning, including a state university. Numerous scientific and research centers mainly serve such fields as horticulture and grape and grain cultivation.\n\nEconomy\n\nDuring the communist era a diversified industry was established in Moldova, agriculture was modernized, and transport and the building industry were overhauled. Following independence, the government began the gradual transformation from a command economy (centrally planned) to a market economy, establishing a program to privatize many state enterprises.\n\nUntil Moldova declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, there were several hundred collective and state farms. There was no large-scale private farming during the Soviet period, but collective farmers did have small plots for their own use. Private land ownership, consisting primarily of small holdings, was initiated in 1990. The amount of privately owned land grew slowly, but the rate increased after the advent of a government program of large-scale privatization in 1995. Conversely, collective farms (engaged mainly in cultivation of grain crops and mixed farming) and state farms (usually specializing in the cultivation and processing of a particular crop) began to diminish in importance.\n\nMost agriculture is devoted to grape cultivation and fruit and vegetable farming. Grapes and sunflower seeds are important industrial crops. Other agricultural products are grains, sugar beets, potatoes, meat, milk, and wool. Dairying and cattle breeding account for a large portion of the agricultural output, followed by the raising of pigs.\n\nMajor food-processing industries are wine making, sugar refining, oil pressing, butter and cheese making, meatpacking, and fruit canning. Light industries include the production of furs, knitwear, and silk fabrics. Moldova also produces oils from roses, lavender, sage, and mint. Mineral wealth includes deposits of gypsum, clays, and sand.\n\nThe country’s chief imports are coal, iron, heavy steel, machine tools, motor vehicles, fertilizers, petroleum products, paper, tea, and cotton thread. Historically, its major export items have been fruits, grapes, wine, sugar, tobacco, essential oils, silk fabrics, knitted goods, refrigerators, and washing machines.\n\nIt was estimated by the International Monetary Fund that Moldova’s economy had shrunk by as much as 60 percent between 1991 and the turn of the 21st century. Still heavily dependent on Russia for trade, Moldova’s economy was severely affected by the August 1998 financial crisis in Russia. In 2001 Moldova was accepted into the World Trade Organization (WTO). As a member of the WTO, Moldova increased its chances to develop more trading partners.\n\nGovernment and History\n\nOn July 28, 1994, the Moldovan parliament ratified a new constitution in order to replace the Soviet constitution in place since the late 1970s. Describing the republic as a “sovereign, independent” state in which “justice and political pluralism” are guaranteed, this constitution formally established a unicameral parliament comprising 104 members who are directly elected for four-year terms. The president, who is directly elected for a five-year term, serves as the head of state and the commander in chief of the armed forces. The president shares executive power with the Council of Ministers (cabinet), which is led by the prime minister. The prime minister is designated by the president but must be approved by the parliament. The council is responsible for implementing the domestic and foreign policy of the state.\n\nBessarabia—the name often given to the region of historic Moldavia between the Dniester and Prut rivers—was part of Scythia in the 1st millennium bc. As part of Dacia, it later came under the control of the Roman Empire. Lying on one of the principal land routes into Europe, Bessarabia was invaded by successive waves of barbarians, and the area had many rulers. Gradually, under varying influences, the Vlach (or Romanian) nationality developed.\n\nBessarabia’s development depended on the rise of the principalities of Moldavia and Walachia, which soon expanded to include the surrounding territory. The southern area, which originally fell into the Walachian sphere, probably took its name from the Basarab Dynasty. The whole province became part of Moldavia in the 15th century but was soon conquered by the invading Turks.\n\nBeginning with Peter I (commonly known as Peter the Great), Russia expanded toward the Danube River delta. The Russians occupied Moldavia five times between 1711 and 1812 and finally secured Bessarabia—approximately half of historic Moldavia—from Turkey in the Treaty of Bucharest (1812).\n\nUnder imperial Russian rule, Bessarabia fell within the so-called Pale of Settlement, a large geographical area of Eastern Europe to which the Jewish population of the empire was confined by order of the czar. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Jewish towns of the Pale suffered frequent massacres by local mobs of non-Jews. These massacres were commonly referred to as pogroms. One of the most notorious of these occurred in Kishinev on Easter Day, 1903. For two days, mobs—acting with the support of local officials—killed, looted, raped, and destroyed without hindrance from police or soldiers. When troops were finally called out and the mob dispersed, 45 Jews had been killed; nearly 600 had been wounded, and 1,500 Jewish homes had been pillaged. Those responsible for inciting the pogrom were not punished. Two years later, another pogrom shook the city. The incident inspired massive emigration by those Jews who could afford to leave the country. (See also pogrom; Pale of Settlement, Jewish.)\n\nAfter more than a century under Russia’s administration, Bessarabia was united with Romania in 1918, but the newly created Soviet Union contested Romania’s rule and in 1924 established a small Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic within Ukraine. The Soviet Union reasserted its claims to Bessarabia after signing a nonaggression pact with Nazi Germany in 1939. In 1940 the Soviet Union pressed Romania to give up Bessarabia and merged much of it with Moldavia into a new Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic.\n\nBy mid-1990 the weakening of the Communist Party in the Soviet Union allowed the Moldavian parliament to declare sovereignty of the republic’s laws over those of the central government. On August 23, 1991, the Communist Party was outlawed and all party property was seized by the people. On August 27, by parliamentary vote, Moldavia was declared independent. The country’s new name, Moldova, was taken from the native language of the region. Former Communist president Mircea Snegur became the first elected president of the new nation.\n\nAs a further act of national sovereignty, the Moldovan language—which is similar to Romanian except for differences in phonetics and vocabulary—replaced Russian as the official language of Moldova. The new government also authorized a return to the Latin alphabet from the Cyrillic. In November 1993 the Moldovan currency was established—the leu (plural lei) consists of 100 bani.\n\nMoldova joined the newly formed Commonwealth of Independent States in December 1991. It quit in August 1993, alleging Russian attempts at dominance of the organization, but rejoined in April 1994. Shortly after joining the Commonwealth of Independent States in 1991, Moldova also became a member of the United Nations.\n\nSince independence a variety of political parties have emerged, most of them based on ethnicity and advocacy of independence or unification with either Romania or Russia. A national referendum on Moldova’s status as an independent country was held on March 6, 1994, with a large turnout of eligible voters. More than 95 percent voted in favor of continued independence.\n\nThe Transnistria region, located along the Ukrainian border, has a large ethnic Russian and Ukrainian population. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, the region sought independence from the rest of Moldova. In 1997, representatives of the Transnistria region signed a provisional agreement with the Moldovan government. The agreement declared that the country would remain unified. In exchange for remaining a part of Moldova, the Transnistria region was granted greater autonomy.\n\nOn July 5, 2000, the Parliament voted overwhelmingly to make Moldova into a parliamentary republic. This marked a defeat for President Petru Lucinschi, who wanted to strengthen the presidential system. In 2001 the Communist Party leader Vladimir Voronin was elected to succeed him as president."
