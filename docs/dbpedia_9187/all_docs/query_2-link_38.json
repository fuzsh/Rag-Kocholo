We aim to simplify your currency exchange experience.\n\nAlternatively, visit our Manor FX bureau near Heathrow for a personal service while still enjoying our great rates.\n\nCan you buy Moldovan leu in the UK?\n\nAs an exotic currency, it’s not as readily available as more common currencies.

Especially for immediate expenses like transport or small purchases when you arrive in Moldova.\n\nWhat’s the best currency to take to Moldova?\n\nThe best currency for your Moldovan trip is undoubtedly the Moldovan leu.\n\nYou could also carry a small amount of euros or US dollars.

Each denomination has a different colour and size, making it easy to distinguish them.\n\nThe designs on the banknotes feature prominent Moldovan historical figures, cultural symbols, and architectural landmarks. The 1 leu note often depicts a historical figure on the front and cultural or architectural imagery on the back.\n\nMoldovan banknotes have security features to prevent counterfeiting. These features may include watermarks, security threads, see-through registers, and special inks that change colour when tilted. The higher the denomination, the more complex the security features tend to be.\n\nThe banknotes are user-friendly. They include features that aid in distinguishing denominations for those with visual impairments.\n\nCoins in Moldova\n\nIn Moldova, coins are also an integral part of the currency system alongside the banknotes.\n\nThe coins are denominated in Moldovan lei (singular: leu) and bani (singular: ban)\n\nCommonly used coin denominations include 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 bani. There are also 1 leu and 2 lei coins, with 100 bani making up 1 leu.\n\nMoldovan coins typically feature the national coat of arms, symbols of Moldovan culture, or important historical figures. The design varies with each denomination, often including elements that reflect Moldova’s heritage and national identity.\n\nThe size and material of the coins vary by denomination. Generally, the coin’s value correlates with its size — higher denominations are usually larger.\n\nCoins are great for smaller transactions. You’ll use them to buy things from local markets, pay for public transport, or make small purchases in shops and cafes.\n\nLike banknotes, Moldovan coins often have features that make them distinguishable by touch, which is helpful for visually impaired individuals.\n\nHave you got leftover Moldovan coins? Our sister company, Leftover Currency, can exchange them back to pounds for you.\n\nMoldova’s currency import and export regulations\n\nImport regulations:\n\nThere aren’t any restrictions on the amount of foreign or domestic currency you can bring into Moldova. If you are carrying an amount equivalent to or exceeding 10,000 euros (or its equivalent), you must declare it.\n\nExport regulations:\n\nWhen leaving Moldova, you can take the equivalent of 10,000 euros out without declaring it.\n\nIf you’re exporting more than 10,000 euros, you must declare it. You’ll need to prove that the money was either legally imported into Moldova, withdrawn from a bank account in Moldova, or legally acquired during your stay in the country.\n\nOrdering Moldovan leu online\n\nWith Manor FX, you can conveniently exchange your GBP to Moldovan leu online.
