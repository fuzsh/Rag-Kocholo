This is the opinion of the dealers of the foreign exchange market, with whom the Infotag correspondent spoke on Wednesday morning.\n\n“A noticeable strengthening of the leu against the US dollar is due to the fact that in a situation where there are practically no buyers of dollars, the regulator does not enter the market, which contributes to the strengthening of the national currency,” said a dealer of one of the banks.\n\nHe pointed out that the exchange rate trend of the leu-dollar currency pair in the coming days can change its movement only in the presence of large transactions with the purchase of dollars worth several tens of millions.\n\nDealers name three important factors that can change the situation associated with the strengthening of the Moldovan leu: the demand for the currency, the different ratio of the euro-dollar pair, and the interventions with purchases of the NBM currency.\n\nThe interlocutors of the agency say that the current exchange rate ratio of MDL to the single European currency at the level of 19.50 MDL: 1 euro fairly reflects the situation in the economy, where 70% of calculations are carried out in euros.\n\nInfotag's dossier: As of Wednesday, July 23, the NBM set the official exchange rate of the lei against the US dollar and euro - 16.9884 MDL: US $1 and 19.4364 MDL: 1 euro, slightly increasing the leu rate against the dollar and euro."
