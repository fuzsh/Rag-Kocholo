        "text": "Everything is stable and good on the currency market of Moldova - this is how currency dealers commented on Monday morning on the exchange rate situation of Moldovan lei against the main currency pair - euro and U.S. dollar. During a telephone interview with the correspondent of \"INFOTAG\", dealers of commercial banks drew attention to the fact that exchange rates are regulated by supply and demand, and therefore there is no need for the regulator's intervention in the situation.\n\n\"There is no pressure on the exchange rate of the national currency, the turnover in the market is average, demand and supply of currencies meet in such a position of the exchange rate trend, which fully suits the National Bank, and for this reason its dealers do not come out with interventions in the market,\" said one of the interlocutors of the agency.\n\nWhen asked to predict the development of the situation in the near future, some dealers expressed confidence that the exchange rate ratios in the market will remain approximately the same, as it suits the regulator.\n\n\"In the year of presidential elections, it is important that the situation on the Moldovan currency market remains stable and predictable. Therefore, most likely, the exchange rate of Moldovan leu against dollar will remain in the range with the upper value of 18 MDL:$1 and the lower value of 17,50 MDL:$1, while for euro the rate will fluctuate in the range of 19,10-19,50 MDL:1 euro\", - currency dealers believe.\n\nOn Monday, May 20, the NBM set the following official lei exchange rates: 17.7412:1 U.S.D. and 19.12262:1 euro, slightly strengthening the lei against the dollar-euro currency pair."
