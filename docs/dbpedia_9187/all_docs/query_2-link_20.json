        "text": "Order Code 95-403 F\n\nUpdated June 26, 2001\n\nCRS Report for Congress\n\nReceived through the CRS Web\n\nMoldova: Basic Facts\n\nSteven Woehrel\n\nSpecialist in European Affairs\n\nForeign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division\n\nSummary\n\nThis short report provides information and analysis on Moldova, including its\n\nhistory, political and economic situation, foreign policy, and U.S. policy toward\n\nMoldova. This report will be updated as events warrant.\n\nHistory\n\nMoldova at a Glance\n\nMoldova is a part of the area\n\nLand Area: 33,371 sq. km., about the size of\n\nknown historically as Bessarabia,\n\nMaryland.\n\ngeographically delineated by the Prut\n\nRiver on the west, the Dniestr River\n\nPopulation: 4.4 million (2000 estimate)\n\non the north and east, the Black Sea\n\non the southeast, and the Kiliya\n\nGross Domestic Product (GDP): $1.41 billion\n\n(Chilia) arm of the Danube delta on\n\nin 2000.\n\nthe south. The Republic of Moldova\n\napproximately coincides with the\n\nEthnic Composition: 64.5% Moldovan,\n\neastern half of the Romanian\n\n13.8% Ukrainian, 12.8% Russian, 3.5%\n\nprincipality of Moldavia (1359-\n\nGagauz (Turkic-speaking Orthodox Christians),\n\n1859). In 1812 it was ceded to\n\n2.0% Bulgarian (1989 census).\n\nRussia by the Ottoman Empire.\n\nMost of this area remained under\n\nPolitical Leaders: President: Vladimir\n\nRussian control until 1918. At that\n\nVoronin; Prime Minister: Vasile Tarlev;\n\ntime the whole of Bessarabia became\n\nForeign Minister: Nicolae Chernomaz;\n\npart of Romania. This reintegration\n\nParliament Chairman: Yevgenia Ostapchuk\n\nwith Romania was never recognized\n\nby the Soviet Union which, in\n\nSources: 2000 CIA Factbook, Economist\n\nOctober 1924, established the\n\nIntelligence Unit, International Monetary Fund\n\nMoldavian Autonomous Soviet\n\nSocialist Republic (ASSR) on the\n\neast bank of the Dniestr (in Ukraine).\n\nCongressional Research Service Ë The Library of Congress\n\nCRS-2\n\nBessarabia was among the territories assigned to the Soviet Union under the terms\n\nof the secret Soviet-German nonaggression pact of 1939. The Soviet Union forced\n\nRomania to cede Bessarabia in June 1940, and, in August, assigned one-third of the area\n\nto Ukraine, merging the remainder with the Moldavian ASSR to form a new Moldavian\n\nSoviet Socialist Republic (SSR). In the wake of Germanyâs July 1941 attack on the USSR,\n\nthe Soviet Union once again lost the bulk of Bessarabia to Romania, with the exception\n\nof the territory east of the Dniestr. Romanian occupation forces committed large-scale\n\natrocities against the local population, especially Jews and Gypsies. The territory was\n\nrecaptured by Soviet troops in 1944 and the Moldavian SSR reestablished. Reincorporation\n\ninto the Soviet Union entailed rigorous Russification, the imposition of the Cyrillic alphabet,\n\nlarge-scale immigration of Russians and Ukrainians as well as isolation from Romania.\n\nMoldova declared its sovereignty on June 23, 1990. Following the failed August 1991 coup\n\nin Moscow, Moldova declared its independence on August 27, 1991.\n\nConflict between\n\nMoldovan forces and those\n\nof the \"Dniestr Republic\" (a\n\nseparatist entity proclaimed\n\nby ethnic Russian local\n\nofficials in 1990) erupted in\n\nMarch 1992. Over 150\n\npeople died in the violence.\n\nA cease-fire was declared in\n\nJuly 1992 which provided for\n\nRussian and Moldovan\n\npeacekeepers to patrol a\n\n\"security zone\" between the\n\ntwo regions. Although a\n\ncessation of hostilities was\n\nachieved, the core issue of\n\nthe degree of autonomy to be\n\naccorded the Dniestr region\n\nremains difficult.\n\nThe Gagauz minority,\n\nwhich had also proclaimed its\n\nSource: Map from MagellanÂ© adapted by CRS\n\nown republic in 1990, did not\n\nresort to the use of force, choosing, instead, to hold extensive discussions with Moldovan\n\nauthorities about the future of the region. On July 28, 1994, the Moldovan Parliament\n\nadopted an organic law, negotiated with Gagauz officials, establishing a ânational-territorial\n\nautonomous unitâ for the Gagauz. The region has its own elected legislative and executive\n\nauthorities and will be entitled to secession from Moldova in the case of Moldovaâs\n\nreunification with Romania.\n\nPolitical Situation\n\nMoldova is a parliamentary democracy that has held largely free and fair elections since\n\nachieving independence in 1991. In the most recent parliamentary elections on February\n\n25, 2001, the Communist Party of Moldova won a decisive victory, the first such victory\n\nby a communist party in the countries of the former Soviet Union since that countryâs\n\nCRS-3\n\nbreakup in 1991. The CPM holds 71seats in the 101-seat parliament. An alliance of small\n\ncenter-right groups headed by outgoing Prime Minister Dumitru Braghis won 19 seats and\n\nthe nationalist and pro-Romanian Christian Democratic Popular Party won 11 seats.\n\nAnalysts attributed the CPMâs success to public frustration with political gridlock,\n\ncorruption and low living standards under preceding center-right governments.\n\nOn April 4, 2001, the new parliament elected CPM leader Vladimir Voronin as\n\nPresident. The formal powers of the Presidency are weak (ironically due to a successful\n\nCPM-led effort in parliament in 2000 to reduce them), but as CPM leader Voronin is in\n\nfact the most powerful political figure in the country. On April 19, the parliament approved\n\na new government led by businessman Vasile Tarlev, who is a political neophyte and not\n\na CPM member. The CPM has billed Tarlevâs government as a non-partisan government\n\nof experts; only two of its members are members of the CPM, while six are from the\n\nprevious, center-right reformist government. Nevertheless, the government is entirely\n\ndependent on the CPM for support.\n\nLike its predecessors, the new leadership in Moldova faces the thorny issue of the\n\nstatus of the âDniestr Republic.â Dniestr leaders want a confederated structure for\n\nMoldova, under which Dniestr would be an independent state. They demand control over\n\nforeign affairs, internal security and defense. Moldovan authorities are willing to give\n\nDniestr an autonomous âspecial statusâ within Moldova that would devolve significant\n\npowers to the region, but not ones that would relinquish Moldovaâs sovereignty there.\n\nThe causes of the conflict over Dniestr are complex, involving ethnic and ideological\n\nfactors, as well as maneuvering for power and wealth among elite groups. Ethnic Russians\n\nand Ukrainians together make up 54% of Dniestrâs population of about 650,000, while\n\nMoldovans are the single largest ethnic group, at 39%. Until recently, pro-Western,\n\nmoderate nationalist governments in Chisinau faced nominally leftist, Soviet-style, pro-\n\nRussia forces in Dniestr. However, many Moldovan analysts are convinced that the key\n\nfactor obstructing a settlement is the personal interests of the leaders of Dniestr regime,\n\nincluding Dniestr âPresidentâ Igor Smirnov, who they claim is heavily supported by\n\norganized crime groups. Early efforts by President Voronin to reach agreement with the\n\nDniestr leaders have failed, despite the fact that CPMâs views on many issues appear to\n\nbe closer to those of the Dniestr leadership than those of the previous center-right\n\ngovernments had been.\n\nEconomy\n\nMoldova is one of the poorest countries in Europe. According to the World Bank,\n\nits per capita Gross National Product was $410 in 1999, which is also the average for\n\ncountries the Bank terms âlow income countries.â Per capita GNP for Europe and Central\n\nAsia averages $2150. Moldovaâs main natural resource is its rich soil. Agriculture,\n\nespecially fruit, wine and tobacco, plays an important role in Moldovaâs economy. Most\n\nof Moldova's industry is located in the Dniestr republic, and is not counted in Moldovan\n\ngovernment statistics. Moldova has had mixed success in economic reform. After\n\nindependence, output declined sharply and inflation soared, but Moldova pursued an IMF-\n\nsupported program of tough fiscal and monetary policies. It succeeded in achieving a\n\nmeasure of macroeconomic stability, including the stabilization of Moldovaâs national\n\ncurrency, the leu. However, Moldovaâs small economy is highly vulnerable to external\n\nshocks, and Moldova suffered a severe setback during the 1998 Russian economic crisis.\n\nCRS-4\n\nIt has since staged a partial recovery, due in part to a government effort to cut spending\n\nand accelerate reforms.\n\nMoldova has privatized its small and medium-sized business sector, and unlike other\n\ncountries in the region, it has had remarkable success in privatizing agricultural land.\n\nHowever, the sale of large firms has been more difficult. Foreign investment in Moldova\n\nis low; cumulative foreign direct investment since independence through 1999 amounted\n\nto only $339 million. The situation improved in 2000, with the sale of Moldovan energy\n\ndistributors to the Spanish firm Union Fenosa. A key test of the intentions of the new\n\ngovernment will be whether it interferes with Union Fenosaâs efforts to make the energy\n\nsector profitable, and whether Moldova will privatize the rest of the energy sector, as well\n\nas its telecommunications sector. Another key test will be how (or whether) it privatizes\n\nthe key tobacco and wine industries. Some of the CPMâs strongest support comes from\n\nthe directors of these sectors.\n\nThe Moldovan government has acknowledged that its room for maneuver over such\n\nissues as increasing government spending or slowing privatization is limited. Given the\n\ncountryâs poverty and its weak financial situation, Moldova is heavily dependent upon loans\n\nfrom the IMF, World Bank and other international financial institutions. In December 2000,\n\nthe IMF approved a $142 million Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility loan for Moldova.\n\nThe IMF suspended disbursements of the loan in May 2001, waiting to see whether the\n\nCPM-supported government will continue economic reforms. The resumption of IMF\n\nfunding is critical if Moldova is achieve a critically necessary rescheduling of its substantial\n\nforeign debt burden. In April 2001, Moldova owed over $1.3 billion, over 100% of the\n\ncountryâs GDP. Moldova joined the World Trade Organization in June 2001.\n\nForeign Policy\n\nAccording to the Moldovan constitution, Moldovan foreign policy is based on\n\nneutrality. Perhaps Moldovaâs most important foreign policy relationship is with Russia.\n\nMost of Moldovaâs exports go to Russia, and over 90% of its energy imports come from\n\nRussia. Moldova has accumulated large debts to Russian energy firms. It has ceded control\n\nof its natural gas distribution system to the Russian energy giant Gazprom to pay part of\n\nthe debt.\n\nRelations with Russia are complicated by the continued presence of about 2,500\n\nRussian troops in the Dniestr Republic, as well as huge stockpiles of weapons and\n\nammunition. (This figure does not include several hundred Russian troops deployed in the\n\nsecurity zone between the Dniestr Republic and the rest of Moldova with the Moldovan\n\ngovernment's consent.) Since Moldovaâs independence, Russia has repeatedly failed to\n\nhonor commitments it has made to withdraw its forces from Moldova.\n\nAt the November 1999 Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)\n\nsummit in Istanbul, Russia pledged to complete the withdrawal of its troops from Moldova\n\nby the end of 2002. Both Moldovan and Russian officials agree that the huge stocks of\n\nmunitions in Dniestr must be removed or destroyed before the Russian troops pull out, in\n\norder to prevent the weapons from falling into the hands of criminals, terrorists and\n\nundesirable groups. However, Russian officials say that they cannot withdraw the munitions\n\nwithout the permission of the Dniestr authorities, who claim that the weaponry is their\n\nâproperty.â As a result, the OSCE has noted that very little progress has been made toward\n\nCRS-5\n\nthe implementation of Russiaâs pledge to withdraw its troops from Moldova. One positive\n\ndevelopment was the conclusion of an agreement in May 2001 between the OSCE and\n\nRussia on OSCE monitoring and assistance for the troop withdrawal, including the use of\n\nan OSCE trust fund to help dispose of the Russian munitions.\n\nRussia officially supports the view, held by the rest of the international community,\n\nthat Moldova should remain a single, sovereign state. Russia formally rejects Dniestrâs\n\ndemands for recognition as an independent state in confederation with Moldova. An OSCE\n\nmission in Moldova is charged with helping to solve the Dniestr issue, as well as supporting\n\nthe Russian troop withdrawal from Moldova. However, some Moldovans charge that\n\nRussia has in reality backed the Dniestr leadership in order to retain political leverage over\n\nMoldova, while publicly supporting OSCE efforts to avoid international pressure over the\n\nissue. Russian leaders have at times attempted to tie the withdrawal of Russian troops to\n\nthe resolution of Dniestrâs status.\n\nMoldova is a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). However,\n\nuntil the CPMâs victory in 2001, Moldova resisted Russia's desire for closer integration\n\nwithin the CIS under Russia's leadership, declaring that it would not participate in political\n\nand/or military integration within the CIS. Moldova participates in a loose group of former\n\nSoviet republics known as GUUAM, after the initial letter of each member â Georgia,\n\nUkraine, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Moldova. GUUAM countries have tried to enhance\n\ncooperation between membership of the group to enhance their independence and to ward\n\nof Russian efforts to dominate them. After his election in April 2001, President Voronin\n\nhas stressed the need for Moldova to seek closer ties with Russia, including by eventually\n\njoining the Russia-Belarus Union. However, some observers question whether Voronin\n\nwill be able to fulfill this pledge, given the difficulties the Russia-Belarus Union is having\n\nat present. President Voronin has said that Moldova will continue to participate in the\n\nGUUAM group, but warned that it sees the group as a forum for economic issues, not\n\npolitical ones.\n\nMoldovan officials stress that they wish to expand ties with Western countries.\n\nMoldova does not seek NATO membership, but favors cooperation with NATO, and\n\nparticipates in Partnership for Peace (PFP) exercises. In February 2001, NATO announced\n\nthe establishment of a PFP trust fund to help Moldova destroy the large stockpile of anti-\n\npersonnel mines on its territory, as required by the Ottawa Convention on the elimination\n\nof these weapons. On November 28, 1994, Moldova signed an agreement for partnership\n\nand cooperation with the European Union (EU), which provides for cooperation in a wide\n\nvariety of spheres, and holds out the possibility of an eventual free trade agreement. From\n\n1991 until 1999, Moldova received 70 million Euros ($60.4 million) in EU aid for political\n\nand economic reform. Moldova has also received EU humanitarian aid, as well as assistance\n\nfor food security and poverty reduction and balance of payment support. Moldova joined\n\nthe Stability Pact for Southeastern Europe in June 2001.\n\nOne of the most sensitive issues in the republicâs foreign relations is relations with\n\nRomania. The question has implications for the identity of the country. Most Romanians\n\nconsider Moldovans in fact to be Romanians, and support the eventual unification of the\n\ntwo countries. Although most independent experts consider the \"Moldovan language\"\n\nto be Romanian, the issue is a matter of political controversy in Moldova. Those favoring\n\nthe term \"Moldovan\" tend to favor Moldova's independence or close ties with Russia, while\n\nthose favoring \"Romanian\" tend to favor union with Romania. The Christian Democratic\n\nCRS-6\n\nPopular Party (which has only 11 seats in parliament) and a few other right-of-center groups\n\nfavor unification with Romania, but the CPM-led government and the overwhelming\n\nmajority of Moldovans oppose it. In a 1994 referendum, over 90% of Moldovans rejected\n\nunification with Romania.\n\nU.S. Policy\n\nFrom FY 1992 through FY 2000, the United States obligated $422.26 million in aid\n\nto Moldova. Moldova will receive an estimated $47.7 million in U.S. aid in FY 2001. The\n\nAdministration has requested $48.23 million in aid for Moldova for FY 2002. Of this\n\namount, $43.7 million of FY 2001 funds and $44 million of FY 2002 is in Freedom Support\n\nAct assistance for political and economic reform. U.S. aid is aimed at supporting\n\nindependent media and non-governmental organizations in Moldova, as well as fostering\n\nexchanges. U.S. economic aid has played a key role in Moldovaâs successful land reform\n\nprogram. U.S. aid has also played an important role in energy sector privatization. The\n\nUnited States also provides humanitarian aid in the form of food and medicine to particularly\n\nvulnerable parts of Moldovaâs impoverished population.\n\nThe United States has also provided security assistance to Moldova, including Excess\n\nDefense Articles. The United States provided $1.225 million in Foreign Military Financing\n\nin FY 2000, and will provide an estimated $1.493 million in FY 2001. The Administration\n\nhas requested $1.8 million in FMF for Moldova in FY 2002. Moldova received $0.717\n\nmillion in IMET military training aid in FY 2000, and is expected to receive $0.6 million\n\nin FY 2001. The Administration has requested $0.85 million in IMET for Moldova in FY\n\n2002. U.S. security assistance is used to help Moldova participate in Partnership for Peace\n\nexercises, and develop its peacekeeping capacity and interoperability with NATO.\n\nThe United States has provided Moldova with help in preventing the proliferation of\n\ntechnologies of mass destruction. In October 1997, the United States purchased 21 MiG-29\n\nfighters (14 of them nuclear-capable) from Moldova, using Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat\n\nReduction funds, after Moldova informed U.S. officials that Iran was one of several\n\ncountries interested in buying the aircraft. Secretary of Defense William Cohen said the\n\ndeal marked an improvement in U.S.-Moldovan ties. The United States has also provided\n\naid to help Moldova fight organized crime, including trafficking in women and children,\n\nwhich is a severe problem in Moldova.\n\nThe United States has supported Moldovaâs efforts to bolster its sovereignty and in-\n\ndependence by securing the withdrawal of Russian forces from Moldova and negotiating\n\na settlement of the Dniestr issue consistent with Moldova's territorial integrity. The United\n\nStates has contributed funding to an OSCE trust fund to assist the withdrawal of Russian\n\ntroops from Moldova by assisting in the destruction of the huge store of munitions in\n\nDniestr. On September 26, 1996, the House passed H.Con.Res. 145, which called on\n\nRussia to withdraw its troops from Moldova, by a vote of 425-0."
