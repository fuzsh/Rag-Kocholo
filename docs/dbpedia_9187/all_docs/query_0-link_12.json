        "text": "Not to be confused with the neighbouring Romanian region of Moldavia.\n\nMoldova is a small, landlocked country nestled between Romania and Ukraine.\n\nRegions\n\n[edit]\n\nMoldova\n\nArea controlled by the Moldovan Government.\n\nTransnistria\n\nAn unrecognized but sovereign and independent territory. Its Soviet-style monuments and statues draw visitors interested in getting a glimpse of life in the old Soviet Union.\n\nCities\n\n[edit]\n\n— the capital is a nice city to go and visit for some days, and to walk around in\n\n— the second largest city, features a pedestrian zone around the central square and a historic city centre\n\n— known as the \"Romani (Gypsy) capital of Moldova\", also boasts the Soroca fort built by Stephen the Great in 1499\n\n— a border town to Romania with a bridge over the Prut river designed by architect Gustave Eiffel\n\n— the capital of the territory of Gagauzia, known for wine specific to the southern part of the country\n\n— historically the site of many battles, now known for its spas\n\n— fortified since the 6th century BC, also famous for its monastery\n\nOther destinations\n\n[edit]\n\n, an autonomous region within Moldova.\n\n— Moldova's only national park\n\nUnderstand\n\n[edit]\n\nOne of the smallest states of the former USSR, Moldova has been part of two historical empires: the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire. For several centuries, the country was under Ottoman influence but that all changed during the 1800s when the Russians took control of it. In the years to follow, Moldova became a part of the Russian Empire and later on, the Soviet Union, before declaring independence in the 1990s. Its fertile soils led to Moldova being dubbed \"the garden\" of the Soviet Union.\n\nMoldova one of the least visited countries on the planet. You are likely to attract intrigued looks from locals curious of what you are doing in the country.\n\nSince independence, Moldova has faced numerous difficulties, especially inter-ethnic conflict. Inter-ethnic tensions led to the creation of the proclaimed Transnistria Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any UN member country. Economic links have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure in political negotiations.\n\nSimilar to Switzerland, Moldova is committed to neutrality, and has decent relations with virtually every country in the world.\n\nDespite Moldova's vast political and economic problems, Moldovans try to be happy and make the most of their situation.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nContinental cold and snowy winters, mild springs and autumns, and warm to hot summers.\n\nTerrain\n\n[edit]\n\nLandlocked. Rolling steppe, gradual slope south towards the Black Sea. Well endowed with various sedimentary rocks and minerals including sand, gravel, gypsum, and limestone. Natural hazards: experiences landslides (57 cases in 1998) due to extensive soil erosion from poor farming methods\n\nThe lowest point is the Dniester River at 2 m and the highest point is Bălănești Hill at 430 m.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nCapital Chișinău Currency Moldovan leu (MDL) Population 2.6 million (2022) Electricity 220 volt / 50 hertz (Europlug, Schuko) Country code +373 Time zone UTC+02:00 Emergencies 112 Driving side right\n\nIt was a principality under the suzerainty (protection) of the Ottoman Empire, then part of the Russian Empire after 1811, then part of Romania after World War I. Moldova was forcefully incorporated into the Soviet Union during World War II.\n\nIndependence Day — 27 August 1991 (from Soviet Union)\n\nConstitution — new constitution adopted 28 July 1994; replaces old Soviet constitution of 1979\n\nAlthough independent from the Soviet Union since 1991, Russian forces have remained on Moldovan territory east of the Dniester River supporting the Slavic population, mostly Ukrainians and Russians, who have proclaimed the breakaway republic of Transnistria.\n\nThe poorest nation in Europe, Moldova became the first former Soviet state to elect a communist government and president in 2001. Despite subsequent losses, the Communist Party remains powerful in local politics.\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nGeographically located at the crossroads of Latin, Slavic and other cultures, Moldova has enriched its own culture by adopting and maintaining some of the traditions of its neighbours and of other influences.\n\nMoldova has a distinct culture, but has heavy influences from Russia, Romania and Ukraine. These influences are most visible in the cuisine in Moldova. While Moldova has its own culinary style, including Mamaliga, Zeama, Placinta and other traditional dishes, a lot of the food eaten or sold here originated from Russia or Romania.\n\nMoldovan music has a distinctive flair, but is what you might expect in eastern Europe. There are a lot of accordions, and the traditional costumes and dances are similar to Romanian traditional ones.\n\nMaps\n\n[edit]\n\nMoldova is one of the least visited countries in Europe, so tourist information desks are still very rare. You can't depend only on the usual online maps, especially if you need to find an address in a rural area. Probably the best online map of Moldova is found at map.md\n\nIn some kiosks you can buy a two-sided map called \"Republic of Moldova: Topographical map, 1:200 000\" (Республика Молдова: Топографическая карта, 1:200 000, ISBN 9789664970621 which is based on older Soviet military maps. You can download these in advance and print them, or you can browse them in many apps.\n\nVisitor information\n\n[edit]\n\nExperience Moldova tourism information\n\nGet in\n\n[edit]\n\nEntry requirements\n\n[edit]\n\nCitizens of Canada, CIS countries, the EU, Japan, Norway, Switzerland, UK and the US do not need a visa to enter Moldova and can stay in the country for up to 90 days within a six-month period without registration. Citizens of other countries must either obtain a visa in the nearest Moldovan embassy or alternatively could obtain a visa on arrival in Chișinău airport and on some land border crossings provided that an officially endorsed invitation letter from Moldova is obtained beforehand.\n\nBy entering into Moldova via Ukraine, you may be crossing Transnistria. Some buses from Odesa go through Tiraspol, while others go around, exchanging the two border crossings with more time on the road. Transnistria is an unrecognised state in the east of Moldova bordering Ukraine, which broke off from the country after a war in 1992. There are generally few issues for Westerners in crossing Transnistrian borders by bus, although foreign travellers have experienced problems in the past. There is, however, a small chance that foreign tourists may be asked to pay bribes, although the buses which travel between Ukraine, Transnistria and the rest of Moldova usually handle negotiations at the border well, collecting passports and negotiating with Transnistrian authorities. Also, there is no Moldovan border check between Transnistria and the rest of Moldova as Moldova does not recognise Transnistria as a state, so you might have some explaining to do when you try to leave Moldova without an entrance stamp.\n\nBy plane\n\n[edit]\n\nNote: As a result of the war in Ukraine, flights to Moldova may be suspended, particularly if conflict erupts in Transnistria or neighboring areas of Ukraine. Flights to Russia and Ukraine remain suspended. (Information last updated 17 Apr 2022)\n\nThe main international airport is (RMO IATA).\n\nAirlines that serve several destinations from Chisinau are Wizz Air, HiSky and Fly One\n\nNearby airports are in Iași (IAS IATA) and Bacău (BCM IATA).\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nPossibly the cheapest way to get into the country is to take the overnight train. There are daily trains from Romania.\n\nThe train from Bucharest leaves at 19:20 and arrives at about 08:10 and the train from Chișinău leaves at 17:20 arriving at 06:19 in Bucharest check the complete timetables here:\n\nBucharest - Chișinău[dead link]\n\nChișinău - Bucharest[dead link]\n\nA ticket in a 2nd class, 4-berth sleeper is 593 Moldovan lei (~€28), or 685 Moldovan lei in a 1st class, 2-berth sleeper (2018). Since flights into Bucharest may be cheaper than those into Moldova, this may be an option if you have the time. It is now possible to buy tickets online[dead link] up to two weeks before departure (website in Romanian/Russian only). Just show your printout to the conductor when boarding. At the border crossing the carriages are lifted individually onto larger gauge wheels to fit Moldovan tracks. Crossing the border from Ukraine is smoother, as both countries use the same track gauge.\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen coming by car use a border crossing with a (non-stop) visa issuing office. You will have to pay a small road tax at the border. A person driving a car which is not registered in their own name must carry a letter of authority from the registered owner.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are regular buses connecting Chișinău with Bucharest, Kyiv and most major Romanian and Ukrainian cities. There are 5-6 buses per day to and from Bucharest. Due to a longer stay at the border the trip takes around 10 hours. There is a basic toilet at the border, however most coaches do not make any other stops. You will also be able to travel to most European cities by bus with Moldovan bus companies. When coming by bus one should be sure to use a frontier with a (non-stop) visa issuing office.\n\nKyiv, 2 daily, 250 lei, 12 hours\n\nMoscow, 4 daily, 700 lei, 30 hours\n\nOdesa, 20 daily, 90 lei, 5 hours\n\nSevastopol, daily, 430 lei, 18 hours\n\nBrasov, 5 daily, 200 lei, 12 hours\n\nBy boat\n\n[edit]\n\nAlthough the country is landlocked, there is a ferry service between Giurgiulești in Moldova and Istanbul, Turkey, plying the river Danube to reach the Black Sea. They leave Giurgiulesti every Monday and arrive at Istanbul the following Wednesday. It's not certain if this ferry service is only limited to the high season.\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nMoldova is small enough to be explored very quickly. For example, a long walk to Chișinău from Bolhrad − even though that sounds highly impractical − will take you about 34 hours.\n\nThe most reliable way of getting around the country is by bus. Buses can get you to most parts of the country. You can find information about long-distance bus services in Moldova on the Autogari website, for example. This site contains information on bus stations in Moldova, timetables and routes between cities.\n\nChișinău is the main transportation hub for the country. The three bus stations serve every city and town in Moldova. The fastest form of transport are small minibuses which seat around 15 people. Larger buses are also used and are marginally safer, because they travel at slower speeds.\n\nIn Chișinău there is a state run trolleybus system which includes many new vehicles. Fare is 6 lei; a conductor collects fares and issues tickets. There is also a 'bus service which operates with fewer routes.\n\nMinibuses (rutiere in Moldovan Romanian; marshrutki in Russian) are available in most cities. They are privately operated and are called by requesting the vehicle to stop, however can often be very crowded. Drivers should be paid on boarding (3 lei in Chișinău), however some insist on sitting down first and passing the money to the person in front of them to pass to the driver, so don't be alarmed if people behind you start handing you money.\n\nTalk\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Romanian phrasebook\n\nThe official language of the country is Romanian. Since 2023, it has been the state language of the country.\n\nRussian is widely spoken in the country, both as a first and second language. If you don't know any Romanian, communicating in Russian should be no problem.\n\nGagauz, a Turkic language, is a language of Gagauzia. It is closely related to Azerbaijani, Turkish, and Turkmen. If you know either of those three languages, you shouldn't have a problem picking up Gagauz.\n\nUkrainian is spoken by the Ukrainian minority and in parts of Transnistria.\n\nEnglish has been taught in Moldova since the 1990s, but few people speak it well enough to have a full conversation. Therefore, knowledge of Romanian and/or Russian is useful to get around the country independently.\n\nLanguage can be a sensitive issue in this country, and the name of the native language is a source of endless political controversy. Some refer to Romanian as Romanian (limba română), while some refer to the same language as Moldovan (limba moldovenească), and others prefer to speak Russian.\n\nSee\n\n[edit]\n\nMuseums\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are several museums in central Chișinău, including the Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography, the Museum of Natural History and the National Museum of Fine Arts.\n\nWine\n\n[edit]\n\nMoldova is famous for its wines, and high-quality wines at inexpensive prices are Moldova’s main tourist attraction.\n\n- With over 200 kilometres (125 miles) of underground roadways, Mileștii Mici is registered in the Guinness World Records as the biggest wine collection in the world. It may be easier to book a tour through a travel agency as one must provide a car for the tour. +373 22 382 333.\n\n- Moldova's second largest wine cellar has over 120 kilometres (75 miles) of underground roads. 15 minutes drive from Chișinău, it is a favourite of tourists. +373 22-277 378.\n\n- One of the oldest wineries in Moldova, Purcari wine has been drunk by Russian Emperor Nicolai II and his first cousin, the British King George V.\n\nBrănești - A smaller and reasonably priced wine cellar. It lies close to Orheiul Vechi Monastery which makes it perfect for combining a monastery tour with wine tasting.\n\nMonasteries\n\n[edit]\n\n- Moldova's best known sight is a 13th-century Cave Monastery located about a half-hour drive from Chișinău. Just up the road is a tourist centre with a small museum, restaurant and hotel. Call ahead to make sure it's open at +373 235 34 242. The cost to enter the complex is 20 lei or 15 if you are a student, but none of the locals seem to bother to stop to pay. Six marshrutka services run between Chișinău central bus station and the tourist complex every day. In the vicinity are huge cliffs that contain another six complexes of interlocking caves. It is strongly advised to explore them with an experienced guide. The remains of a Turkish bath house is also just off the river.\n\n- One of Moldova’s most prominent monasteries only 40 km (25 miles) from Chișinău. Buses run hourly in the morning from Calea Ieşilor in the Sculeni part of Chișinău.\n\n(or Tighina in Romanian) - Another fortification is The Fortress of Bender, however it is being used as a military training ground and is off limits. The best views are from the bridge going towards Tiraspol.\n\n- Rock monastery situated by Nistru river in mid-eastern Moldova.\n\nDo\n\n[edit]\n\nVisit wine cellars\n\nBuy\n\n[edit]\n\nMoney\n\n[edit]\n\nThe leu (plural: lei) is the currency of Moldova (ISO 4217 code MDL) . Like the Romanian leu, the Moldovan leu is subdivided into 100 bani (singular: ban). The name of the currency originates in Romania, and means \"lion\".\n\nVisit at least one piața to see the Soviet memorabilia, but be careful as sellers may charge foreigners much higher prices than locals.\n\nBanknotes are in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1,000 lei. Coins come in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 bani, 1, 2, 5 and 10 lei.\n\nShopping\n\n[edit]\n\nLocal wine is of superb quality and cheap in comparison to other countries, but for political reasons is mostly unknown in Western Europe.\n\nTipping\n\n[edit]\n\nMoldovans are not accustomed to tipping.\n\nEat\n\n[edit]\n\nChișinău is a good place for gourmands. There are a lot of good places to eat all over Chișinău.\n\nCheap, tasty food that is very popular with the locals is served in most places. For better service and more diverse food, there are a lot of small restaurants and cafés. Good restaurants have prices comparable to those elsewhere in Europe. For a quick lunch, fast food and pizza shops are recommended; these can be found at nearly every corner. For groceries, there are small shops all over. Some are even in front of apartment blocks just a few steps away from the entrances. For harder-to-find items, go to the supermarkets. For fresh fruits and vegetables, markets are a great place to shop. Most of the products are local, but there are a lot of sellers who to sell imported stuff, mostly oranges, bananas and other tropical fruits and vegetables. Meat and meat products are best purchased from supermarkets or shops. The quality is much better than from the market, and the prices aren't much higher.\n\nWhile in Moldova, make sure you try at least some of the traditional dishes: Mămăligă, plăcintă and sarmale are essential for a complete experience during your visit to Moldova. For the full experience these should be accompanied by homemade wine.\n\nDrink\n\n[edit]\n\nMoldova has a long tradition of local wine. The reds are especially popular throughout the country. Most Moldovan villagers grow their own grapes and press their own wine, and many standard rural households will press thousands of litres per year.\n\nThe nightlife of Chișinău is also quite spectacular compared to what could be expected. It is the host of many clubs and bars that are equal in every aspect to many other places throughout Eastern Europe.\n\nSleep\n\n[edit]\n\nAccommodation in Chișinău is surprisingly expensive and there is no shortage of €100 a night options. Most hotel prices are listed in euros but some are listed in US dollars.\n\nMany smaller towns will have a Soviet relic hotel complete with service with a frown. Rates will be high for what you're getting. In many places it's possible to pay about €10 to stay in a local's house. This is an informal arrangement and can only be organized by talking to people upon arrival but it is well worth considering if you want to get out into the countryside.\n\nHostels. Hostelling is still in its infancy in Moldova, but there are a few nice hostels to be found in Chișinău. Amongst others Chișinău Hostel and Central Youth Hostel. Prices range from US$10–20.\n\nApartments. Many people in Chișinău rent out apartments. The location and quality can vary. Many are also not very modern. You may want to use a booking company as it may be hard to find people who speak English. Price €20–50.\n\nLearn\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile none are internationally accredited, there are universities in Chișinău, Bălți and Cahul.\n\nWork\n\n[edit]\n\nThe unemployment rate in Moldova is one of the highest in Europe. In addition, salaries are very low. Many Moldovans go to work overseas.\n\nFor foreigners, it may be interesting to work in highly qualified industries, where, nevertheless, salaries are not as high as in most of Europe, although it is easy to get a work visa or work permit. The minimum wage here is about €125, and the average salary is €250-300.\n\nGood doctors (especially dentists), IT specialists, economists, teachers of English, Spanish, Italian, French, Portuguese, German, Polish, Turkish are especially appreciated here. To teach languages, you must know Romanian or Russian.\n\nStay safe\n\n[edit]\n\nWARNING: Due to the war in Ukraine, do not travel to areas near the Moldovan-Ukrainian border and Transnistria. For more information on how to protect yourself while in a war zone, see war zone safety. (Information last updated 05 Nov 2023)\n\nVisitors to Moldova for business or romance should be aware of the potential risk of scams, particularly if first contact was made on the Internet. See International financial scams[dead link] and Russian Internet dating schemes[dead link] .\n\nCorrupt police and border guards may try to extort bribe money but 'normal' crime rates are low. Locals are generally very friendly and will go to great lengths to provide hospitality to foreigners. You can expect a lengthy, and inevitably boozy, meal to be offered to you just in your honour.\n\nConservative dress must be worn at religious sites. Shorts are forbidden and women must cover their heads inside monasteries and churches.\n\nWhile bribery and police corruption are still problems in Moldova, the situation is improving. It is still advised that tourists have the number of their embassy and the contact information of where they are staying. Foreigners are also required to have their passports on them at all times. There is however usually no one checking this in any normal setting.\n\nAlcohol consumption can also be a problem. Running into drunks especially at night is common. Most are friendly; they often come off as aggressive and will invade your personal space. This can be scary the first couple of times. Politely walking away normally works. People coming from a country where less alcohol is consumed can find themselves becoming the drunks.\n\nStay healthy\n\n[edit]\n\nVery few healthcare facilities are on par with Western standards, and accessibility may be hindered if you're not proficient in Romanian and/or Russian.\n\nIn the event of a serious medical emergency, it is strongly recommended that you make every effort to seek medical care elsewhere. Neighbouring Romania may have better healthcare facilities than neighbouring Ukraine.\n\nThe US Embassy in Moldova maintains a list of facilities that provide services in English. Refer to for more information.\n\nThe heavy use of agricultural chemicals, including banned pesticides such as DDT, has contaminated soil and groundwater. If you are concerned, water for drinking, cooking and oral hygiene should be taken from a known safe source, as ordinary water treatment, including boiling, does not remove such chemical contamination.\n\nRespect\n\n[edit]\n\nTourists are likely to attract stares from the locals. Do not be alarmed or surprised; this doesn't indicate hostility, but rather, curiosity. This may cause some to treat you as a \"walking wallet\" or someone who is \"wealthy\". If you feel like you are about to be scammed by someone, simply ignore them or tell them to go away. Don't feel the need to be polite with scammers; nobody should put up with such behavior.\n\nWomen\n\n[edit]\n\nWomen are widely respected in Moldovan society, perhaps more so than any other country in Europe. There are many female mayors in Moldova and there are many women who have high positions in the government, including the president since 2020.\n\nAs is the case throughout the former USSR, women are traditionally treated with chivalry in Moldova. Women should not be surprised or alarmed if their male Moldovan friends take the initiative to pay the bills at a restaurant, open every door in front of them, and/or help them carry items or objects. Men should understand that these nuances will be expected by Moldovan women.\n\nIn rural areas, it is a social taboo for women to smoke or drink alcohol.\n\nSensitive issues\n\n[edit]\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nMoldovan political discourse tends to be polarizing. Moldovans are divided into three opposing camps − those who favor closer ties with the European Union, those who favor closer ties with Russia, and those who want Moldova to be committed to neutrality.\n\nYou should be mindful of discussing the following political subjects:\n\nThe possibility of Romania and Moldova unifying is a sensitive issue in certain circles, especially among pro-Russian Moldovans.\n\nAvoid bringing up the Transnistria conflict; it can be a very sensitive topic of discussion and many Moldovans are opposed to Transnistrian independence.\n\nMoldova's relationship with Russia is a complex topic of conversation; while some in Gagauzia and Transnistria have favorable opinions of Russia, some pro-European Moldovans, especially supporters of the Sandu administration, do not have positive opinions of the Russian government. Some Moldovans feel that Russia hasn't done enough to acknowledge the role the Soviets played in causing a mass famine in the country during the mid-1940s.\n\nThe possibility of Moldova joining the European Union is a highly sensitive issue among pro-Russian Moldovans. Avoid bringing it up in front of people in Gagauzia and Transnistria.\n\nIdentity can be a highly sensitive issue in Moldova; most identify as \"Moldovan\", while some identify as \"Romanian\" (common among pro-European and unionist Moldovans). This also applies to language as well; even though Romanian is the official language of Moldova, some refer to it as \"Moldovan\". The foolproof method is to ask someone what they identify as, if they're comfortable discussing it, that is.\n\nThis country travel guide to Moldova is an outline and may need more content. It has a template, but there is not enough information present. If there are Cities and Other destinations listed, they may not all be at usable status or there may not be a valid regional structure and a \"Get in\" section describing all of the typical ways to get here.
