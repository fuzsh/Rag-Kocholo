        "text": "Moldova Moldova officially the Republic of Moldova (Romanian: Republica Moldova), is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe. It is bordered by Romania to the west and Ukraine to the north, east, and south. The region is situated on the Moldavian Plateau in the south eastern part of the East European Plain.\n\nMoldova's landscape can be described as rolling steppe with a gradual slope in south towards the Black Sea. The highest elevation in the country is a hill named Bălănești with an altitude of 430 m. With an area of 33,850 km² Moldova is somewhat larger than Belgium, or slightly larger than the U.S. state of Maryland. The capital and largest city is Chișinău (Chisinau). 1940-1990: [former city name: Kishinev (Kishinyov)] and 27 Mar 1944 - 24 Aug 1944: Kagul [Cahul].\n\nMost of the Moldovan territory was a part of the Principality of Moldavia from the 14th century until 1812, when it was ceded to the Russian Empire by the Ottoman Empire (to which Moldavia was a vassal state) and became known as Bessarabia. In 1856, southern Bessarabia was returned to Moldavia, which three years later united with Wallachia to form Romania, but Russian rule was restored over the whole of the region in 1878. During the 1917 Russian Revolution, Bessarabia briefly became an autonomous state within the Russian Republic, known as the Moldavian Democratic Republic. In February 1918, the Moldavian Democratic Republic declared independence and then integrated into Romania later that year following a vote of its assembly. The decision was disputed by Soviet Russia, which in 1924 established, within the Ukrainian SSR, a Moldavian autonomous republic (MASSR) on partially Moldovan-inhabited territories to the east of Bessarabia. In 1940, as a consequence of the MolotovRibbentrop Pact, Romania was compelled to cede Bessarabia to the Soviet Union, leading to the creation of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (Moldavian SSR), which included the greater part of Bessarabia and the westernmost strip of the former MASSR (east of the Dniester River).\n\nOn 27 August 1991, as the dissolution of the Soviet Union was underway, the Moldavian SSR declared independence and took the name Moldova. The constitution of Moldova was adopted in 1994. The strip of the Moldovan territory on the east bank of the Dniester has been under the de facto control of the breakaway government of Transnistria since 1990.\n\nDue to a decrease in industrial and agricultural output following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the service sector has grown to dominate Moldova's economy and is over 60% of the nation's GDP. Its economy is the poorest in Europe in per capita terms and has the lowest Human Development Index in the continent.\n\nMoldova is a parliamentary republic with a president as head of state and a prime minister as head of government. It is a member state of the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC).\n\nSpoken languages are Moldovan (Romanian), recognized regional languages are Ukrainian, Russian, and Gagauz (a Turkic language).\n\nMoldova's major rivers are the Dniester (Nistru) the Răut, a tributary of Dniester, and the Prut rive, which forms Moldova's border with Romania. Territorial Disputes: Moldova and Ukraine operate joint customs posts to monitor the transit of people and commodities through Moldova's break-away Transnistria region, which remains under the auspices of an Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)-mandated peacekeeping mission comprised of Moldovan, Transnistrian, Russian, and Ukrainian troops. 28 May 1812 Annexed by Russia; the term \"Bessarabia\" (Bessarabiya)\n\nappears for the first time to designate the former\n\nEastern half of Moldavia.\n\n11 May 1818 Establishment of the Bessarabian oblast - for the\n\nfirst time the territory of Bessarabia is\n\norganized as a separate political entity (with local\n\nautonomy until 12 Mar 1828) under special By-laws\n\n[Ustav])(subordinated to the Governorate-general\n\nof Novorossiya and Bessarabia 12 May 1822-1874).\n\n30 Mar 1856 Following the Crimean war, Russia is forced to cede\n\nthe South-western corner of Bugeac (Ismail, Cahul\n\nand Bolgrad counties) back to the Principality of\n\nMoldavia.\n\n28 Oct 1873 Reorganized as Bessarabian guberniya (governorate).\n\n13 Jul 1878 Counties of Ismail, Cahul and Bolgrad returned to\n\nRussia.\n\n15 Dec 1917 Declaration of republic is passed by the National\n\nDiet (nominally in federation with Russia);\n\nMoldavian Democratic Republic.\n\n14 Jan 1918 - 26 Jan 1918 Bolshevik Romanian Front Committee (\"Rumcherod\")\n\nunits take power in Kishinev (under Ukraine).\n\n26 Jan 1918 Romania occupies Kishinyov (Kishinev) (by Mar 1918\n\nall of Moldova).\n\n06 Feb 1918 Declaration of independence is passed.\n\n09 Apr 1918 Incorporation into Romania as Bessarabia\n\n(autonomous until 10 Dec 1918).\n\n23 Apr 1918 Royal decree on unification of 22 Apr 1918 is\n\npromulgated in Romania.\n\n01 Jan 1920 Parliamentary act of unification is promulgated in\n\nRomania (passed by parliament on 29 Dec 1919, and\n\nsigned by the king on 31 Dec 1919).\n\n20 Oct 1920 Romanian annexation internationally recognized.\n\n11 Oct 1924 Moldavian A.S.S.R. established within the\n\nUkrainian S.S.R. by the Soviet Union.\n\n28 Jun 1940 - 02 Aug 1940 Bessarabia occupied by Soviet Union.\n\n02 Aug 1940 Annexed by the Soviet Union as Moldavian Soviet\n\nSocialist Republic formed from the Moldavian\n\nA.S.S.R. and (formerly Romanian) Bessarabia.\n\n02 Jul 1941 Romanian invasion begins.\n\n16 Jul 1941 - 31 Jul 1941 Bessarabia occupied and annexation by Romania.\n\n01 Aug 1941 - 24 Aug 1944 Incorporated into Romania as Bessarabia\n\n(Basarabie) governorate.\n\n24 Aug 1944 Re-incorporation into the Soviet Union\n\n(recognized by Romania on 15 Sep 1947).\n\n01 Sep 1989 Moldovan/Romanian is made the state language.\n\n05 Jun 1990 Soviet Socialist Republic of Moldova\n\n23 Jun 1990 Declaration of state sovereignty.\n\n02 Sep 1990 Transnistria declares independence from Moldova\n\n(not recognized).\n\n06 Nov 1990 Moldova Flag adopted.\n\n23 May 1991 Republic of Moldova\n\n27 Aug 1991 Independence declared.\n\n26 Dec 1991 Independence effective (dissolution of U.S.S.R.).\n\n02 Mar 1992 Admitted to the United Nations.\n\n06 Mar 1994 Referendum rejects union with Romania by 97.9%.\n\n07 Jun 1994 National Anthem \"Limba Noastră\" (Our Language) adopted.\n\n29 Jul 1994 Constitution.\n\nMOLDOVA\n\nThe Cimmerians.........................................c. 2000 -

Currency changeover was done on 02 August 1993: One Russian Ruble (RUR) = One Moldovan Ruble Cupon (MDR). It replaced the Soviet ruble at par and was replaced by the leu at a rate of 1 leu = 1000 cupon. Notes issued included 50, 200, 1000, and 5000 cupon. No coins were issued. The leu (sign: L; ISO 4217 code: MDL) is the currency of Moldova. Like the Romanian leu, the Moldovan leu (plural: lei) is subdivided into 100 bani (singular: ban). The name of the currency originates from a Romanian word which means \"lion\".\n\nBetween 1918 and 1940 and again between 1941 and 1944, when Moldova was part of Romania, the Romanian leu was used in what was then the eastern part of the broader Romanian region of Moldavia (Moldova in Romanian). The Moldovan leu was established on 29 November 1993, following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the creation of the independent republic of Moldova. It replaced the temporary cupon currency at a rate of 1 leu = 1000 cupon. Since 1996 several commemorative coins for collectors have been issued.\n\nIn Transnistria, an unrecognized state claimed in whole by Moldova, the Transnistrian ruble is used instead. The currency is not honoured by Moldova or any other state. A first series of mostly small aluminum coins entered circulation in November 1993. A second series consisting of larger denomination coins was issued in 2018. Most Moldovan coins are minted at the Monetăria Statului in Romania. 1992 On 29 November 1993, the National Bank of Moldova (NBM) issued its first coins of 1, 5, 25 and 50 bani and 1 and 5 lei.\n\nKM#5 / Schön# 7 Leu.

According to Gheorghe Vrabie, the author of the coat of arms, the eagle symbolizes the Latin origin of the people. The chest of the eagle is protected by a shield that bears the traditional arms of Moldavia: an aurochs' head with a star between its horns. It also contains two lozenges (the ears), a five-petaled flower and a moon in a crescent phase. Everything on the shield has one of the three traditional colours: red, yellow, blue. The coat of arms appears in the centre of the flag of Moldova. It was adopted on 13 July 1990.\n\nConstantin Dumitrescu is a famous Romanian medalist sculptor. Constantin Dumitrescu was born in Bucharest on 15 May 1950. His uncle, Ion Dumitrana, who was an engraver at the Stamp Factory, advised him to join to the State Mint in August 1965. In the beginning at the mint, he was the disciple of the engraver Haralambie Ionescu, known through the beautiful Romanian coins on which he engraved the effigies of the last two kings of Romania.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Constantin studied at the School of Arts, under the guidance of sculptor Gheorghe Adoc. Constantin Dumitrescu is passionate about making portraits. He made a lot of medals, which he portrayed Romanian personalities: Mihai Eminescu , Ion Creangă , Veronica Micle, etc. Many times, he also collaborated with other Romanian artists in the engraving projects with Nicolaie Pascu Goia, D. Zamfirescu, Gheorghe Adoc, Kruch and others.\n\nIn 1974, he made a very important contribution in engraving of the first Romanian medal, of \"proof \" quality, which was dedicated to Ioan Vodă cel Complit.\n\nAfter 1989, he realized the projects of the Romanian coins with nominal values ​​of 5, 20, 50 and 1,000 lei. In 1994, he realized projects, not finalized by authorities, of bimetallic coins with nominal values ​​of 250 and 500 lei. In 2000, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of Mihai Eminescu, through the Decree of the President of Romania Emil Constantinescu, the medalist sculptor Constantin Dumitrescu was decorated with the commemorative medal Mihai Eminescu.
