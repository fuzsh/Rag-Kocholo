It enjoys a favorable climate and good farmland but has no major mineral deposits. As a result, the economy depends heavily on agriculture, featuring fruits, vegetables, wine, and tobacco. Moldova must import almost all of its energy supplies from Russia. Energy shortages contributed to sharp production declines after the breakup of the Soviet Union in december 1991. As part of an ambitious reform effort after independence, Moldova introduced a convertible currency, freed prices, stopped issuing preferential credits to state enterprises, backed steady land privatization, removed export controls, and freed interest rates.\n\nThe government entered into agreements with the World Bank and the IMF to promote growth and reduce poverty. The economy returned to positive growth of 2.1% in 2000, 6.1% in 2001, 7.2% in 2002, 6.3% in 2003, and 6.8% in 2004. Further reforms will come slowly because of strong political forces backing government controls. The economy remains vulnerable to higher fuel prices, poor agricultural weather, and the skepticism of foreign investors.\n\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $8.581 billion (2004 est.)\n\nGDP-real growth rate: 6.8% (2004 est.)\n\nGDP-per capita: purchasing power parity - $1,900 (2004 est.)\n\nGDP-composition by sector:\n\nAgriculture: 22.4%\n\nIndustry: 24.8%\n\nServices: 52.8% (2004 est.)\n\nLabor force: 1.36 million (2004 est.)\n\nLabor force-by occupation: agriculture 40%, industry 14%, services 46% (1998)\n\nUnemployment rate: 8% (roughly 25% of working age Moldovans are employed abroad) (2002 est.)\n\nPopulation below poverty line: 80% (2001 est.)\n\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\n\nLowest 10%: 2.2%\n\nHighest 10%: 30.7% (1997)\n\nDistribution of family income-Gini index: 40.6 (1997)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 11.5% (2004 est.)\n\nInvestment (gross fixed): 17.1% of GDP (2004 est.)\n\nBudget:\n\nRevenues: $648.1 million\n\nExpenditures: $634.8 million, including capital expenditures of NA (2004 est.)\n\nPublic debt: 63.4% of GDP (2004 est.)\n\nAgriculture-products: vegetables, fruits, wine, grain, sugar beets, sunflower seed, tobacco; beef, milk\n\nIndustries: food processing, agricultural machinery, foundry equipment, refrigerators and freezers, washing machines, hosiery, sugar, vegetable oil, shoes, textiles\n\nIndustrial production growth rate: 17% (2003 est.)\n\nElectricity-production: 3.876 billion kWh (2002)\n\nElectricity-consumption: 4.605 billion kWh (2002)\n\nElectricity-exports: 0 kWh (2002)\n\nElectricity-imports: 1 billion kWh (2002)\n\nOil-production: 0 bbl/day (2001 est.)\n\nOil-consumption: 24,000 bbl/day (2001 est.)\n\nOil-exports: NA\n\nOil-imports: NA\n\nNatural gas-production: 0 cu m (2001 est.)\n\nNatural gas-consumption: 2.05 billion cu m (2001 est.)\n\nNatural gas-exports: 0 cu m (2001 est.)\n\nNatural gas-imports: 2.05 billion cu m (2001 est.)\n\nCurrent account balance: $-148.4 million (2004 est.)\n\nExports: $1.03 billion f.o.b.
