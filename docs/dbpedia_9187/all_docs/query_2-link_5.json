About one-tenth of the land is used to cultivate permanent crops (those that are planted once but will not be replanted after each annual harvest). Agriculture has been highly mechanized, and almost all agricultural jobs are performed by machines. Virtually all landowners have access to electricity, and chemical pesticides and mineral fertilizers are widely used. Most Moldovan farmers dedicate large shares of land for export crops.\n\nThere was no large-scale private farming during the Soviet period, but collective farmers did have small plots for their own use. Private land ownership, consisting primarily of small holdings, was initiated in 1990. The amount of privately owned land grew slowly at first but proliferated after the advent of a government program of large-scale privatization in 1995. Conversely, collective farms (engaged mainly in cultivation of grain crops and mixed farming) and state farms (usually specializing in the cultivation and processing of a particular crop) began to diminish in importance. By the early 21st century, those who tended to privately owned farms outnumbered those who worked on collective and state farms 10 to 1.\n\nSince 1940 the area used for vegetables, orchards, berries, and vineyards has undergone significant expansion. Viticulture, fruit and vegetable growing, and other specialized farming activities are particularly important, constituting about one-fourth of the commodity output of arable farming. Grapes are Moldova’s most important industrial crop, with the largest vineyards found in the southern and central regions. Most orchards are situated in northern and southeastern Moldova. Sunflower seeds, another significant crop, are grown throughout the republic, though the southeastern regions have the largest plantations. Sugar beets, a relatively new crop in Moldova, are cultivated in the north. Moldova also is a major tobacco grower. Vegetables are grown mainly in the southeast. The chief grain crops are winter wheat and corn (maize). Wheat is used for the republic’s own needs, and corn is exported as a seed crop. Most of the grain is grown in the north. Sheep and cattle breeding also are important, as is pig farming.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nWhich Country Is Larger By Area? Quiz\n\nHigh rates of deforestation have greatly affected Moldova’s forestry sector. About two-thirds of the country’s forests are designated for wood supply, while the rest is protected in national nature reserves. Still, there is a shortage of forest resources, and Moldova has to import some wood from Russia. Wood in Moldova is mainly used for energy—more than one-half of the timber felled from the country’s forests is used for fuel. The remainder of the wood supply is used for construction, the production of furniture and other consumer goods, and packaging. All forests are owned by the state.\n\nThe main types of fish found in Moldova’s lakes and rivers are bream, carp, roach, catfish, pike, and perch. The country’s fish production decreased in the mid-1990s; thereafter, most fish-processing companies were privatized, and the amount of fish imported greatly exceeded the local catch. Dozens of foreign-owned companies are active in the importing, processing, and canning of fish. After 1991 aquaculture was largely privatized, with pond ownership being transferred to local municipal authorities, who began leasing the ponds for private fish farming.\n\nResources and power\n\nMoldova’s greatest resources are its fertile soil and its climate, both of which contribute to the agricultural potential of the country. Other natural resources include limited quantities of lignite, found in the southern part of the country, and phosphorite and gypsum, which are found throughout Moldova. Deposits of natural gas also have been discovered in the southern part of the country.\n\nThermoelectric power plants are located in Chișinău, Băīți, and Tiraspol, and there are hydroelectric stations in Dubăsari and Camenca (Kamenka), on the Dniester River. The republic provides electricity to the southern regions of Ukraine and also to Bulgaria through a transmission line.\n\nManufacturing\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union, Moldova lost a large part of its manufacturing sector. This was due in part to the economic shock of the transition to a market economy and Moldova’s separation from the integrated economy of the Soviet Union and Soviet bloc. Moreover, the bulk of the country’s industry is located in the breakaway region of Transdniestria, though, owing to Transdniestria’s isolation from the rest of the country, manufacturing in the region has failed to live up to its potential.\n\nThe industrial sector of Moldova’s economy is concentrated mainly on food processing, with the machine-building, power-engineering, consumer-goods, and building-materials industries still undergoing development.\n\nThe food industry has numerous branches; sugar refining, wine making, canning, and oil pressing, as well as the production of essential oils, are especially significant. Moldova is an important exporter of wine, champagne, and brandy. For local needs the republic has flour and other mills and well-developed meat, dairy, and confectionery industries.\n\nMachine building, established in the mid-1950s and centred on Chișinău, Bălți, Tiraspol, and Tighina, has remained important. Tractors made in Moldova are specially equipped for use in orchards and vineyards. Light industry includes the production of furs at Bălți, garments and knitwear at Chișinău and Tiraspol, footwear at Chișinău, and silk fabrics at Tighina. Building materials produced in Moldova include brick, limestone, tile, cement, slate, and concrete blocks. Râbnița is the leading centre of this industry.\n\nFinance\n\nThe National Bank of Moldova began issuing its own currency, the Moldovan leu, in 1993. By the mid-1990s Moldova had stabilized the leu, brought inflation under control, and balanced the national budget. Transdniestria has its own currency, the ruble, and its own central bank.\n\nServices\n\nThe services sector accounts for about one-third of Moldova’s gross domestic product. Most of the retail sector is located in the capital. Tourism (especially rural tourism) has grown since the 1990s. Local culture in Moldovan villages, traditional festivals, and the country’s many monasteries are of particular interest to international visitors; however, owing to its lack of hotels and its poor transportation infrastructure, the country is not always able to adequately accommodate visitors.\n\nLabour and taxation\n\nThe pressures of inflation and the economic downturn that followed independence resulted in widespread unemployment and underemployment. As a result, average Moldovans have had to struggle to provide for their families. In many parts of the country, especially in the rural areas, the necessities of life are procured by barter rather than by purchase. Individual farmers tend to deliver their own goods to food stores.\n\nA taxation system was created in Moldova in 1992 to facilitate the transition from a planned economy to a market economy. It was reformed in 1996 to improve the collection process. There are two levels of tax collection in Moldova—national and local. National taxes include an income tax, a value-added tax (VAT), excise taxes, property taxes, and customs and road duties. Local taxes are collected on land, property, and use of natural resources.\n\nTrade\n\nPrior to 1991 Moldova traded almost exclusively within the Soviet Union. Today the states of the former Soviet Union remain important markets for Moldova, whose main trading partners are Russia, Ukraine, Romania, and Belarus, as well as Germany and Italy. In 2014 Moldova concluded an association agreement with the European Union that strengthened economic and political ties with the EU. Foodstuffs, beverages (notably wine), and tobacco products make up the bulk of Moldova’s exports, followed by apparel and agricultural goods. Moldova’s main imports are mineral products (notably petroleum products), machinery, chemical products, and textiles for reexport.\n\nTransportation and telecommunications\n\nRailway and motor transport are the basis of the republic’s transport system. The railway network includes two main lines—one linking Tiraspol, Chișinău, and Ungheni and the other linking Tiraspol and Reni. Incoming freight includes coal, petroleum products, iron and nonferrous metals, timber, mineral fertilizers, and machines and equipment. Motor transport generally carries freight inside Moldova, over a road network that is nearly all paved but generally needing repair. River transport is of local importance, and air transportation links Moldova with other countries. The republic’s main airport is in Chișinău.\n\nTelecommunications are regulated by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The industry was privatized in 1997; nevertheless, Moldova has one of the lowest numbers of cellular phone and Internet users of all the former countries of the Soviet Union."
