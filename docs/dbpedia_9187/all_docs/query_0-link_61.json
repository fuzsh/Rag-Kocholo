        "text": "Geography\n\nMoldova is a landlocked country in southeastern Europe near the Black Sea. The land has a total area of 33,850 km² (13,070 mi²). This land area is approximately 135% of the area of Maryland. Moldova is thus the 20th smallest country in Europe and ranked 140th in the world. Only slightly less than half of all residents (43%) live within cities.\n\nMoldova is comparatively low at an average elevation of 139 meters above sea level. The highest elevation in the country (Dealul Bălănești) is 430 meters. There is no access to the open sea. There are direct national borders with the two neighboring countries Romania and Ukraine. The distance between New York City and the Capital Chisinau is about 7,650 km (4,753 mi)."
