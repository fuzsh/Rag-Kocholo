Marilyn Monroe married Arthur Miller on June 29th, 1956. The marriage lasted five years. Once the 400 pressmen had gone away, the couple sneaked off to the Westchester County Court House in nearby White Plains, where they were married by Judge Seymour Rabinowitz shortly before 7.30 pm in a ceremony that lasted all of four minutes. The bride was thirty years old to the grooms forty.
