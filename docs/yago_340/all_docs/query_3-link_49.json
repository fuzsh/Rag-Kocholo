        "text": "Historic Marilyn Monroe worn colorful floral garden motif needlepoint purse complete with detailed letters of provenance from Joe DiMaggio's niece herself. In her handwritten documentation she explains, \"She had it on her where she got married to my uncle Joe DiMaggio. Upon her passing, I received it from Joe. I have had it all these years. Marilyn was my friend for eleven years.\" If you look at any photos of Marilyn Monroe on the day of the wedding, she is not carrying a purse. This is because she would almost always have someone hold her belongings as she made entrances. In fact, it is very hard to ever find a picture of Marilyn carrying a purse at any event. As you know, women always had a purse with them, especially in this era to hold their lipstick, mirror and female essentials. Here is a rare opportunity to own a true piece of Old Hollywood celebrity history with letters of provenance. Though the purse has some minor wear around the frame, as shown, the key element is that it is THE purse used on their wedding day. The marriage lasted a total of 274 days and ended with a divorce in October 1954. While their marriage might have flamed out, the embers of DiMaggio's love for Monroe continued to burn. DiMaggio famously sent roses to her Los Angeles grave several times a week for more than 20 years until his death in 1999.\n\nMeasurements\n\n6 in. (H)\n\n9 in. (W)"
