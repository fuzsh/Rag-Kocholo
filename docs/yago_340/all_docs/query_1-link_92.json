        "text": "This is the venue of one of the most ill-fated celebrity weddings ever.\n\nThe four-bedroom home in Waccabuc, upstate New York, was owned by Kay Brown, the manager of Marilyn Monroe. In 1956, Monroe married Arthur Miller there.\n\nMonroe almost refused to go through with the wedding, and the couple were chased by the press wherever they went.\n\nThey married in a civil ceremony, and then held a Jewish service at Brown’s house. Writer George Axelrod gave a witty speech wishing that their children would have Miller’s looks and Monroe’s brains.\n\nThe marriage dissolved after five years. Monroe read in Miller’s diary that he regretted their union; he was embarrassed by her and feared his creativity would be threatened by this “dependent, unpredictable” woman. Monroe described Miller as a “peaceful monster”, and later started taking barbiturates. Miller turned to another woman, and they divorced in 1961.\n\nWhat remains today is a French-style house overlooking a fishing lake, which sits across from the 16th hole of the Waccabuc Country Club. There are original features such as parquet floors, French doors, leaded windows and fireplaces, but with modern touches such as glass walls.\n\nThe garden has a crescent-shaped terrace leading to a large pool with a summer kitchen and cabana."
