        "text": "Every cowboy hat turned her way, as Marilyn Monroe brought star power and her sultry ways to saloons in the Western movie, River of No Return in 1954. But before the boots and Hollywood limelight, many doubted she’d make it in Tinsel Town.\n\nMonroe was born Norma Jean Mortenson on June 1, 1926, in Los Angeles, California. Monroe had humble beginnings, spending the majority of her childhood living in 12 foster homes and an orphanage. To avoid becoming a ward of the state, she married her first husband, James Dougherty, at age 16. When Dougherty enlisted in the military during World War II, Monroe began working in a factory which led to one of her first big breaks: she met a photographer who began her career as a pinup model. By 1946, she had appeared on 33 magazine covers and in numerous publications and advertisements. It was during this time that she dyed her hair blonde and straightened it.\n\nIn June 1946, she signed a six-month contract with 20th Century Fox. She and Ben Lyon, an executive at 20th Century Fox, chose her new stage name, Marilyn Monroe. Lyon was reminded of the Broadway star Marilyn Miller, and Monroe was her mother’s maiden name. As her Hollywood chapter began, Monroe divorced her husband Dougherty in September 1946, as he wasn’t supportive of her new career.\n\nMonroe soon landed parts in Dangerous Years! (1947) and Scudda Hoo, Scudda Hay! (1948). By 1951, her star began taking fast flight. She signed with Columbia Pictures that year, and had supporting roles in three movies that received success at the box office: As Young As You Feel, Love Nest, and Let’s Make it Legal. She began receiving thousands of letters and fan mail every week. Her private life began grabbing the public’s attention as she dated actors and other men in the spotlight. In 1952, she began dating retired baseball legend Joe DiMaggio, who was one of the biggest stars in sports at the time.\n\nBy 1953, Monroe was cemented as a major sex symbol and bankable Hollywood Actress. Her film Niagara (1953) established her sultry iconic look of arched brows, pale makeup, shiny red lips, and a beauty mark. Her films, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) and How to Marry a Millionaire (1953) achieved box office success. She followed this success with her marriage to Joe DiMaggio in 1954.\n\nLater in 1954, Monroe starred in the Western film River of No Return, set in the Northwest. Monroe played a dance hall singer who was taking care of a young boy until his father, played by Robert Mitchum, returned to town. In the film, Monroe experiences numerous adventures outdoors with them that were far different from singing in heels in saloons for Cowboys. The film received moderate success and praise for its beautiful scenes in the river and mountains.\n\nMonroe followed up River of No Return with 1955’s The Seven Year Itch. This film includes the now iconic scene of Monroe standing over a subway grate with the wind blowing up her white dress. It’s reported that more than 2,000 spectators watched Monroe and the production for hours as they filmed the scene. In 1955, her marriage to Joe DiMaggio ended, in part because he purportedly was not pleased with the subway grate scene.\n\nIn 1956, Monroe married her third husband, playwright Arthur Miller. After production wrapped on the 1956 film, The Prince and the Showgirl, Monroe took a year and a half off from filming to focus on family. During this time, she experienced health problems and a miscarriage. and was also hospitalized due to pharmaceutical drug overdose."
