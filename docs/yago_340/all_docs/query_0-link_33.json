        "text": "James Dougherty ​(1942-1946)\n\nMarilyn Monroe‘s first marriage was before she became a superstar, and it wasn’t a happy union. Monroe recounted to Express that she actually married her first husband James Dougherty ​due to an ultimatum. She said her foster home mother arranged it. “She and her husband were going to West Virginia and they were gonna put me in a home, you know like I had been before, or I could marry this boy who was 21 at the time. So I married.” Monroe was only 16 she tied the knot.\n\nHowever, their union lasted four years, with it soon fell apart soon after he joined the Merchant Marines. Because he left for that, she began modeling, and he ended up telling People in 1976, “If I hadn’t gone into the Merchant Marines during World War II, she would still be Mrs. Dougherty today.”\n\nThey officially divorced in 1946.\n\nElia Kazan (1947)\n\nDespite introducing Marilyn Monroe to her third husband, Elia Kazan said he “was not sorry” about having a brief affair with Monroe while he was married. In unearthed letters per People, he said, “I’m not sorry about it. I’m not ashamed at all, not a damn bit, of having been attracted to her. She is nothing like what she appears to be now, or even appears to have turned into now. She was a little stray cat when I knew her.”\n\nJerry Lewis (1949)\n\nFormer My Friend Irma co-stars Jerry Lewis and Marilyn Monroe had a lot of rumors flying around as well, with fans wondering if the two had something going on. Lewis somewhat confirmed they had a brief relationship in a 2011 interview with GQ, saying, “I’m telling you what I know. Never! And the only reason I know is because I did. Okay? She needed that [sexual] contact to be sure it was real.” He added that the affair was “long,” saying “I was crippled for a month. And I thought Marlene Dietrich was great!”\n\nMilton Berle (1948)\n\nMilton Berle and Marilyn met on the set of Ladies of the Chorus in 1948 (and worked together again in 1960 for Let’s Make Love) and he confirmed the two had an affair on set while he was dating Adele Jergens. In his self-titled autobiography, he said, “Marilyn was on the climb in Hollywood, but there was nothing cheap about her. She wasn’t one of the starlets around town that you put one meal into and threw into the sack. Maybe she didn’t know exactly who she was, but she knew she was worth something. She had respect for herself. Marilyn was a lady.”\n\n'Milton Berle: An Autobiography'\n\n$9.99\n\non Amazon.com\n\nJoe DiMaggio (1952-1954)\n\nOne of the most iconic and toxic Hollywood romances of the golden age was undeniably Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe. They met back in 1952 through a friend of DiMaggio’s, hitting it off soon after. Per Donald Spoto’s book Marilyn Monroe: The Biography, Monroe said, “I expected a flashy New York sports type, and instead, I met this reserved guy who didn’t make a pass at me right away. He treated me like something special.”\n\nThey dated for two years before tying the knot in San Francisco in 1954 and honeymooning in Japan. However, their love was a rocky one and marital bliss didn’t last long. Only nine months later, they divorced, which shocked fans everywhere.\n\nDiMaggio was uncomfortable with Monroe’s sex symbol status, wanting her to be a more motherly figure and become a stay-at-home wife. But Monroe wanted both a family and a career. The “last straw” was her iconic white dress scene in The Seven Year Itch, which she recalled, per Biography, “[DiMaggio] said … exposing my legs and thighs, even my crotch — that was the last straw.”\n\nAccording to The New York Times, they remained friends until her death, which he handled funeral arrangements for. Along with that, he sent roses to her grave three times a week for over two decades.\n\nArthur Miller (1955-1961)\n\nSo Marilyn Monroe and Arthur Miller met in 1950, before she even met Joe DiMaggio. They met through their mutual friend Elia Kazan (who later confirmed he and Monroe had a brief affair!) Despite Miller being married, the two fell for each other quickly and started an affair, marrying soon after his divorce in 1956.\n\n“We’re so congenial, This is the first time I’ve been really in love. Arthur is a serious man, but he has a wonderful sense of humour. We laugh and joke a lot. I’m mad about him,” she said in 1956, per Daily Star.\n\nBut their relationship began to fall apart while filming The Misfits, with him being a harsh director. She noted in her diary, saying per Vanity Fair, “I still feel hopeless. I think I hate it here because there is no love here anymore…” And soon after, they divorced in Aug 1962 after five years of marriage."
