        "text": "Most of my celebrity encounters have been impromptu. This next one is planned. I was told a week ago that Arthur Miller is coming to my classroom. Most of us who have grown up reading or seeing his plays know that he’s our version of Shakespeare. Only he had quite the celebrity life. The A in A-List Celebrity begins and ends with Arthur Miller.\n\nHe was married to Marilyn Monroe, the most glamorous woman of her time, and even today, but oh so sad a figure. As a student, I would rather not say anything to the man. He’s a literary giant, and frankly, I put him on the highest pedestal. I’m not alone. As I like to think, “There’s The Holy Bible, and Death of a Salesman. God wrote one.”\n\n1982—NYU School of Dramatic Writing\n\nArthur Miller is coming to my school tomorrow to discuss stuff, and I’m invited to sit in. My teacher says Miller will be here to talk about his new script, “Playing for Time.”\n\nHere are the rules:\n\n• Rule number one, don’t bring up Marilyn Monroe.\n\n• Do not ask about Marilyn and her relationship to Miller. He’s always\n\nremained quiet about her. But, if you need to know, perhaps this will\n\nappease you.\n\nAnd so, one of the divas in the class, rises, and gives us all a tutorial on Marilyn Monroe. He knows her very well, and if given the choice, would choose to be her over Arthur, with full knowledge that he was blowing his tuition.\n\n• Marilyn and Arthur were married for five years.\n\n• He thought it was a big mistake from the get go.\n\n• He wasn’t like her other men who beat the shit out of her. He was\n\nmore passive aggressive, leaving a note behind that she found that\n\nsaid he made a terrible mistake marrying her.\n\n• She knew the relationship was ill fated, but she tried, oh how she\n\ntried.\n\nHe’s talking more about himself now, but that’s okay.He’s kind of fun, and is actually pretty crazy about me.\n\n• She loved him.\n\n• She needed his approval.\n\n• She wanted his baby, and tried twice, but lost the baby each time.\n\n• She converted to Judaism for him.\n\n• She was the perfect housewife.\n\n• She cooked for him. For instance, we know all about her Motzah ball\n\nsoup. But now I have new news: Marilyn made pasta for Arthur fresh.\n\nShe made it from scratch.\n\nNo!\n\n• So don’t ask if she would lay the strips down on the back of a\n\nchair for him, wait for it to dry for him, and served it with a real\n\nsauce for him. She did, she did, she did!\n\nI raise my hand.\n\n“I don’t know about you, but I come from a Ronzoni out of the box or Chef Boyardee out of the can family.”\n\n“Didn’t we all?” says the diva. He continues: she started with a square sheet that looked like a curtain, and then put it through a slicer, and yes, the curtain matched the rug-so-to –speak, and now I’m yearning.\n\nFunny diva. So don’t ask Arthur about Marilyn. “Graff, do you hear me?”\n\n“I’ve got a girlfriend, buddy.”\n\n“I bet she’s no Marilyn. Pow!”\n\nMy girlfriend ordered out, and if we cooked, she made me clean up if I wanted her later. A real Princess, oy.\n\nArthur was coming with a lady, Linda Yellen, the producer of “Playing for Time,” and so who knows if he’s doing her. So, please read the script that you’re supposed to read. Then, there’s rule number two. Yes, rule number two, do not talk about Death of a Salesman. The diva rises once more.\n\n• The play is old. We’re new. He’s coming here to get some new blood.\n\n• The play has been performed a million times. He’s been asked ten\n\nmillion questions about it.\n\n• There is absolutely nothing we can offer that will bring anything new\n\nto the conversation.\n\n• Just bury your thoughts about the characters.\n\nIf you want to discuss the sexual undertones between Willy Loman and\n\nBiff Loman you can make an appointment with one of your advisors, or\n\nyour therapist. Graff, you hear me?\n\nI told him again, “I have a girlfriend, man.” You gotta love this guy.\n\nThe next evening, we’re all bunched into a classroom. The guys who want to be just like Arthur Miller when they get out of school, and the ones who think they’re Marilyn Monroe, are all upfront. I’m way in the back. There’s a knock on the door. The teacher opens it. Arthur Miller enters.\n\nI observe Marilyn’s husband, the author of Death of a Salesman, so many years later, and I can report that he looks good. The man is in his sixties, tall, and thin, but sturdy, very sturdy, not the type of person who requires a woman’s care.\n\nLinda Yellen, his producer, is by his side, not an unattractive woman. Miller smiles at us. It’s genuine. Then he peers out, breathes into his big, black glasses. No Ben Franklin spectacles for this old dude: the larger the lens, the more to note, dissect, and store in his big brain.\n\nHe begins speaking to us by wondering aloud about his past, what life would have been like if he never had written. ‘All I wanted to do was play baseball. Really, until I was nineteen, it’s all I thought about. I was no different than you guys or half the people you know. Writing sort of just found me.”\n\nThen Linda Yellen offers up the script that some of us read, “Playing for Time,” the play about the concentration camp.\n\nMiller says, “This story, I found. I was always interested in the Holocaust, and had written a lot about it in my time. But when I discovered this story, I felt it would be a great play. Overall, this was a painful subject to write about.” I raise my hand. I just want to know the truth. “Mr. Miller, if writing is painful, how do you keep going?”\n\nMy teacher smiles at me, he likes that one. The eyes of the divas turn towards me through the slits of their lids. Miller says, “I knew my subject. I did a lot of research before I sat down to write. If I can recommend anything to a young writer, it’s this. Do the research.”\n\n“So with all the research done, do you know what is going to happen before it happens?” I ask him. My teacher looks like a mother who’s given birth to a healthy baby. Such joy, something he created, all by himself. “Well, I was driven by the musician’s moral dilemma,” says Miller.\n\nPlaying for Time is the story of musicians who played festive music in the concentration camps as Jews marched unknowingly to their deaths in the gas chambers. Miller says, “If the musicians continue to play, they live, if they stop, then what? What would you do? You see, you can never truly know how it’s going to work out in the end, and trust me, I speak from years of experience of writing, but you just have to keep trying. It’s like a mar…” and he stopped, as if she just sort of…\n\n,\n\n…went pow, man, she just popped in, and tell me how difficult that still was for him.the muscles in our chest cavity rose up, and then down again, as we waited for him to break, to possibly crack the surface of the unthinkable, to ask about the unspeakable Marilyn.\n\nThen my magical diva, makes a huge mistake and breaks the second rule. I guess he was just sick over how Arthur was making eyes at me. He wasn’t, of course, but you know how it is:\n\n“In Death of a Salesman we already know that the ending of the play, it’s in the title, so tell me how were you able to keep going?” My teacher put his finger to his mouth to shush.\n\nAnother diva says, “We can’t talk about that,” and suddenly the room is silent. “We can’t talk about Death of a Salesman,” he says it again just to hear his own voice. I will say this,” says Arthur. I will say this about “Death of a Salesman.”\n\nThe desperate diva then sits up and turns red from gloating. “Death of a Salesman is not just popular here. It’s all over. There are universal truths about it that resonate everywhere. Actually, the play is being performed in China right now.”\n\nThen, a million hands go up, and that is the last damn thing that Arthur wants to see and now he’s stuck answering questions about his masterpiece that he’s answered ten million times, and he looks bored to tears. I look at my teacher with my hands out spread in front of me with don’t blame me.\n\nMiller says, “One thing you can say about Death of a Salesman, one thing that may never happen again, it’s the only American play ever produced in communist China,” he says triumphantly. I can tell that Miller is wrapping this thing up. So, I walk by his chair, thank him and hit the bathroom. I wait down the hall for Miller and Yellen. When they exit, they’re not accompanied by a student or teacher. It’s just them and me. Actually, it’s not. Magical diva is hiding in the background, but I don’t say anything and risk losing Miller.\n\n“Thank you, Mister Miller for coming.”\n\n“I hope I didn’t bore you.”\n\n“I wasn’t bored. Death of a Salesman in China, wow.”\n\nAnd when I saw his face look at me, express some joy around my “wow” I became Stardumb. You know that feeling when you meet a star that you respect so much, and want to feel approved of in some way, and never, ever, want the moment to end.\n\nAnd, so the thoughts of what to say next roll around my head…Death of a Salesman…the Chinese production though…what do you say, what do you say, how do you translate a name like Biff Loman into Chinese? That’s it!\n\n“Mr. Miller, I was wondering, in the Chinese production, did you change his name to…Beef Lo Mein?”\n\nI have to say he liked it. Linda had more important fish to fry, and my possessive diva who appeared out of nowhere, stood in the hall with his hands on his hips, just shaking his head with disbelief.\n\n“Matt, I heard that, if this gets back to the administration, I really pity you. You realize they work very hard to get a person like Arthur Miller to come to our school. This is not your chance to be clever.”\n\nThen, he moves closer to me, like he’s tried a thousand times before, “Let me tell you something, sweetheart. One night, Arthur will go to sleep, and dream of Marilyn leaning over the dinner table, and preparing him a fresh pasta dish, and you know what it will be on that plate? Your stupid Lo Mein dish.”\n\n“Dude, you know the difference is between you and me. I like mine in the box. You like yours in the can.”\n\nPow, yourself."
