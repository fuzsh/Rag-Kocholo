Now, the picturesque, French country style house is on the market, currently asking $1.68 million.\n\nThe listing, held by Houlihan Lawrence broker Susan Stillman, does not shy away from what is likely the home’s most famous feature, and declares it has the “incredible provenance of hosting the well-publicized celebrity wedding of Marilyn Monroe to playwright Arthur Miller.” But the 4,291-square-foot home does have plenty of other lovely attributes, aside from being the site of the ultimately doomed marriage.\n\nThe four-bedroom, 5.5-bathroom gated home has many original details, including parquet floors, French doors, leaded windows and European-style fireplaces. The living room is surrounded by walls of glass that lead to the terrace exit, and the master suite is separated for privacy, while a first-floor guest suite has its own side entrance.\n\nThe actress and the playwright’s wedding party was held on the lawn; surely they appreciated the “sought-after privacy” the 4.16-acre property provides from the many gardens, trees and greenery, per the listing. There’s a pool, pool house, summer kitchen and cabana in the backyard, and the home also comes with lake rights on Lake Maccabuc."
