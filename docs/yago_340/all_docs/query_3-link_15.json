        "text": "She was the dream of millions of men around the world. The characters she played in the movies eventually found their happiness. But the Hollywood diva's off-screen life didn't turn out so well: she said \"I do\" three times, but never found true love in marriage. Below we tell you about the main men in Marilyn Monroe's life who succeeded in walking her down the aisle.\n\nMarilyn and James Dougherty\n\nMonroe's first marriage took place before she became famous. But it was not for love: when the mother of a 16-year-old girl was once again taken away for treatment in a mental hospital, Norma (the very name Marilyn was given at birth) decided to get married, just to not be back in the orphanage. The candidate was a neighborhood boy, James Daugherty, who had long been paying attention to her. The wedding took place on June 19, 1942, in Los Angeles. The look of the future movie star reflected the style of the 40s: long pinned sleeves, maxi length, straight silhouette, lace inserts and floral fleur-de-lis on her head. From the outside, it seemed that their union was perfect. In reality, Norma saw her husband as a father and called him \"daddy\". Things fell apart when Dougherty was stationed overseas as part of the merchant marine. In 1946, the girl filed for divorce. Subsequently, she repeatedly called that marriage boring.\n\nMarilyn and Joe DiMaggio\n\nAfter her divorce, Monroe concentrated on her career and soon found herself entering celebrity circles. There she met sports star Joe Di Maggio and they fell in love at first sight. A few years later, on January 14, 1954, the couple got married at San Francisco City Hall. For the ceremony, the Hollywood diva chose quite an unusual outfit - a dark chocolate suit with a skirt and an ermine white collar. Di Maggio wore a wide black suit - such a look would be relevant for modern grooms.\n\nUnfortunately, even in this marriage, the Hollywood main blonde has not found her happiness. Tired of the excessive attention of her husband and focusing on her career, nine months after the wedding, she filed for divorce. But even after that, Joe didn't give up trying to get Marilyn back. According to several sources, the couple wanted to remarry in August 1962, but it was not to be: Marilyn died that month. The athlete was heartbroken and could not forget his beloved: from the time of her funeral until his own death, he delivered fresh roses to her grave twice a week.\n\nMarilyn and Arthur Miller\n\nThe third and last celebrity husband was the playwright Arthur Miller, a man of the arts who wrote several scandalous pieces. He was the opposite of a life-loving Marilyn, but that did not prevent the strongest attraction that arose between them. In 1956, a man proposed to her. Friends dissuaded the actress from marriage because the reputation of the writer was questionable: he was suspected of working with the Communists, and the government with the press began to actively watch him. But Monroe was adamant. Moreover, she publicly defended her man, risking her career.\n\nFor the sake of her husband, who wanted the celebration to take place in the Jewish tradition, the Hollywood diva converted to Judaism. The wedding took place on June 29, 1956, in New York at the home of the groom's agent. Monroe appeared in a custom-made outfit designed by Norman Norellom and John Moore. It was a delicate light beige midi dress made of a thin fabric, the main detail of which was the semitransparent pinned sleeves. The outfit was completed with graceful gloves and a fluffy short veil. The engagement rings were engraved with the inscription \"Now is forever.\" However, the marriage did not last long: six years later, the couple filed for divorce. Even though their relationship began with exceptional love, later, the writer did not hesitate to criticize the actress in every way in his interviews."
