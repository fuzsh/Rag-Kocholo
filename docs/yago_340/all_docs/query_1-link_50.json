        "text": "Marilyn Monroe is one of Hollywood’s most iconic stars, loved for her beauty and impeccable comic timing.\n\nThis year marks the 60th anniversary of Monroe’s “probable suicide” at the age of 36, bringing a period of renewed interest in the tragic superstar.\n\nMonroe’s story has been retold in Andrew Dominik’s new film, Blonde, starring Ana de Armas, which takes on Joyce Carol Oates’s lengthy novel.\n\nHere’s what you need to know.\n\nMarilyn Monroe’s husbands\n\nMonroe married three times, the first in 1942 to James Dougherty, a 21-year-old factory worker, when she was just 16.\n\nThe marriage helped her avoid being placed in an orphanage, as her mother’s deteriorating mental health meant she could longer able to care for her. Monroe dropped out of high school and became a housewife.\n\nBy 1944, her career had picked up after she was noticed by a photographer and began modelling. Two years later, Monroe signed a contract with the Blue Book Model agency and 20th Century Fox, which stipulated that she must be unmarried. The couple soon divorced.\n\nMonroe’s second, short-lived, marriage was to New York Yankees outfielder, Joe DiMaggio. The pair met in 1952, tying the knot two years later. Monroe created a media storm by wearing a black suit to the occasion instead of a white wedding dress.\n\nDiMaggio was jealous, controlling and physically abusive throughout their relationship. Monroe filed for divorce nine months later, citing “mental cruelty”.\n\nMonroe’s final marriage was to Arthur Miller, whose play Death of a Salesman won the 1949 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. After Monroe finalised her divorce from DiMaggio, Miller left his own wife, marrying the actress in 1956.\n\nTheir contrasting lifestyles and personal troubles put strain on the marriage. Monroe suffered several miscarriages, while Miller was accused of being a communist sympathiser at the height of Cold War. The couple separated in 1960, divorcing a year later.\n\nBlonde\n\nOffering her take on Blonde, i‘s film critic, Christina Newland, wrote: “Ana de Armas is excellent, in both her mimicry of Marilyn and in telegraphing the anguish of those stoplight eyes and breathy speech patterns; it’s a shame her vulnerability and talent cannot overcome the sheer ridiculousness of the way her character is conceived.”\n\nThe scathing review continued: “Rarely have I seen a film with such a helpless, near-constantly weeping victim at its centre that isn’t set in the middle of a warzone. Vanishingly little of Marilyn’s screen career appears in the film but for her watching herself in some of her key moments – the star-making turn in noir Niagara; the “Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend” sequence – and none is seen with any capacity for joy, for lightness.\n\n“Everything in Blonde is a wound, everything another chink in Marilyn’s glossy armour, until she becomes incapable of tolerating it any longer. To Dominik, the central fact of Marilyn’s life is that she died, in part by her own hand, at 36. That’s it. No vivacity, no choice, just tragedy. Nothing more to see here, folks.”"
