        "text": "Marilyn Monroe's life is the focus of Netflix's controversial new movie Blonde*—*which is more like an interpretation of the movie star's life. Based on a novel by Joyce Carol Oates, the film is a mostly fictional account that mixes real life and fantasy.\n\nOf course, some of the biographical elements in the movie are based on fact—including her relationships with high-profile men like baseball star Joe DiMaggio, playwright Arthur Miller, and a president. But then again, are they? The details of those relationships have been shrouded in conflicting reports and rumors over the years. There's even speculation around the possible involvement by a prominent family in her untimely death.\n\nSo let's take a look at what we do know. Follow the twists and turns of Marilyn Monroe's love life below.\n\nJoe DiMaggio (1952–1954)\n\nFrom the outside Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio were a match made in heaven. But after 274 days of marriage, the couple called it quits and the reports of their time together sounds like the true definition of tumultuous.\n\nThe relationship started in 1952 after DiMaggio, a recently retired baseball legend who won nine World Series during his 13 years with the New York Yankees, asked a friend to set him up on a date with Monroe, then a rising Hollywood star, because he was intrigued by a photo of Monroe posing sexily in a baseball outfit. They had dinner at an Italian restaurant on Sunset Boulevard, where DiMaggio reportedly barely even spoke.\n\nAccording to Marilyn Monroe: The Biography, published in 1993, this intrigued Monroe, who said, “I expected a flashy New York sports type and instead I met this reserved guy who didn’t make a pass at me right away.”\n\nThey married at San Francisco’s City Hall in January 1954. But with only nine months of marriage under their belt, the pair divorced after it was reported that DiMaggio was jealous of Monroe’s professional role choices and obligations. According to Joe and Marilyn: Legends in Love, DiMaggio had also become abusive by this point.\n\nTheir marriage ended with Monroe citing “mental cruelty,” but they seemed to have remained good friends until Monroe’s death. Eight years after their split, Monroe died of an overdose and DiMaggio arranged the funeral. He also continued to send roses to her crypt three times a week over the next 20 years.\n\nAccording to John and Rock Positano, authors of the biography Dinner With DiMaggio: Memories of an American Hero, DiMaggio once said, “I’ll go to my grave regretting and blaming myself for what happened to her.” He recounted a moment when “Sinatra told me later that ‘Marilyn loved me anyway, to the end.’”\n\nArthur Miller (1955–1961)\n\nMiller and Monroe got together in 1956 as she filmed Bus Stop and he was in the midst of divorcing his wife. However, the beginning of their relationship was plagued with criticisms thanks to Miller being accused of communist affiliations and the public knowledge of their affair.\n\nAccording to John and Rock Positano, Monroe was intrigued by Miller because of his respectful treatment of her and his stature as a renowned playwright. As when she married DiMaggio, Monroe opted for a courthouse wedding to Miller. According to The New York Times, the ceremony lasted less than five minutes with two witnesses and no paparazzi. Afterward, they hosted a small reception with 25 guests at Miller’s agent’s Westchester County home.\n\nShortly after their nuptials, the pair traveled to England for the 1957 film The Prince and the Showgirl. During this time the newlyweds experienced marital troubles because Monroe found notes Miller wrote about their marriage expressing disappointment and embarrassment in her. This hurt her deeply because she idealized Miller.\n\nWhile there were happy times in their marriage, including a moment when Miller dedicated a collection of his plays to Monroe, ultimately, they divorced in 1961.\n\nFrank Sinatra (1961)\n\nWhether or not Marilyn Monroe and Frank Sinatra had a physical relationship is debated by friends of the singer and biographers alike. But all can agree that Sinatra felt protective of her and that the two were very close.\n\nTony Oppedisano, Sinatra’s longtime friend and the coauthor of Sinatra and Me: In the Wee Small Hours, said that “Sinatra felt she was a fragile girl who had been exploited by a lot of people.” According to Oppedisano’s recount of their relationship, this is part of the reason Sinatra never made a move on Monroe, even though he was attracted to her.\n\nHowever, in 1997, J. Randall Taraborrelli wrote that the pair began an alleged affair in 1954 in his book Sinatra: The Man Behind the Myth. He claims that Sinatra proposed to Monroe weeks before her death “in an effort to save her from herself.” His protective nature toward Monroe is a common theme throughout differing accounts of the nature of their relationship.\n\nJFK (1961–1962)\n\nWhile never confirmed, Marilyn Monroe’s alleged relationship with President John F. Kennedy is one of the most talked-about affairs in history.\n\nMonroe and JFK were first introduced in 1954 by Peter Lawford, JFK’s brother-in-law. According to biographer James Spada, “When Kennedy tired of her, he passed her off to his brother” in 1962. However, biographer Donald Soto claims there are only select confirmed occasions when Monroe and JFK were together. Between October 1961 and August 1962, he writes, the pair met four times.\n\nExcluding Monroe's infamous performance of “Happy Birthday, Mr. President,” which ignited—and continues to ignite—assumptions that the pair had an affair, their relationship remained private due to JFK’s marriage to first lady Jackie Kennedy.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to her death, it was reported that she was threatening to hold a press conference to expose her relationship with President Kennedy and his brother U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. A Netflix documentary released earlier this year, The Mystery of Marilyn Monroe: The Unheard Tapes, shared new insights into her death, including her impregnation by one of the Kennedy brothers. A few days before she died, she called a close friend to tell them about her plan to marry Bobby Kennedy.\n\nSince her death, there has been countless conspiracy theories claiming the Kennedy family was involved in her death. While that has not been proved, it further fuels the mystery that was Monroe's life."
