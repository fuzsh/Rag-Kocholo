        "text": "Netflix dropped its new movie, Blonde, this week, giving viewers a fictionalized \"inside look\" at famed starlet Marilyn Monroe's private life. And while the film is getting a lot of buzz for its steamy scenes, a lot of the depictions of her love life are only hazily based on truth (no, she wasn't in a throuple!).\n\nWhile Marilyn Monroe was well-known for her blonde locks, sultry smile, savvy business maneuvers, and infectious smile, a lot of attention has been paid to her long list of boyfriends and husbands. During her short life, the star was married three different times, with each marriage ending in divorce. Marilyn was also linked to lots of steamy love affairsâ€”some real and others concocted by the public imagination.\n\nHere's everything to know about Marilyn's husbands and boyfriends.\n\nShe married James Dougherty in 1942.\n\nWhen Marilyn was just 16, she married her first husband, 21-year-old James Dougherty. The two would only remain married until 1946. Dougherty was actually her next-door neighbor and a police officer with the LAPD, per Today.\n\nThings fell apart when he joined the Merchant Marines and she started modeling, per People.\n\nDoughtery wrote a book about his life with Marilyn in 1997 called, To Norma Jeane with Love.\n\nShe married Joe DiMaggio in 1954.\n\nMarilyn's second husband, former Yankees baseball star Joe DiMaggio, arrived on scene after Marilyn had already seen great success with two of her best-known works, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and How To Marry a Millionaire, per Today. The two met when Marilyn was still only 25 and DiMaggio was 37. They got married at city hall in San Francisco.\n\nThe couple's marriage only lasted nine months, with Marilyn filing for divorce in 1954, according to People.\n\nShe married her final husband, Arthur Miller, in 1956.\n\nMarilyn's third and final marriage to playwright Arthur Miller lasted until 1961. The two met in the early 1950s but didn't get together until both had divorced their partners, per People.\n\nWhen they got married in a little court house in White Plains, New York, Marilyn was 30 and Miller was 40, Today reported. Marilyn was pregnant at least three times during their marriage, but she miscarried each time, and they never had any children. She died shortly after their divorce at the age of 36.\n\nMarilyn had a lot of boyfriends over the years, too.\n\nIn between her three marriages, the famous blonde bombshell also dated (or was linked to) several famous men, from directors, to other actors, singers, and celebrities. The list included:\n\nElia Kazan\n\nCharlie \"Cass\" Chaplin, Jr.\n\nMilton Berle\n\nMarlon Brando\n\nFrank Sinatra\n\nOf course, there's also the famous rumors that Marilyn had a secret affair with President John F. Kennedy and his brother, Robert F. Kennedy, but that's never been confirmed.\n\nYou Might Also Like"
