        "text": "DiMaggio, for his part, had changed his behavior around Marilyn in their later “just friends” years, trying to win her back, being less possessive and more attentive. And there was speculation they had become a better pair. In fact, shortly before her death there was one report that Joe had proposed re-marriage (on August 1, 1962), and that she had accepted, with a small private ceremony planned at her Brentwood residence for August 8th, 1962 – which turned out to be the day of her funeral. DiMaggio, however, never got over her. He dated other women occasionally, but never remarried. He lived the remainder of his years in the glow of his baseball celebrity and its related business opportunities. He became a TV pitchman for Mr. Coffee coffee-makers, and in 1968 was burnished into popular music with the famous line “where have you gone Joe DiMaggio” from the No. 1 Simon & Garfunkel hit song, “Mrs. Robinson.” Joe DiMaggio died of lung cancer on March 8, 1999. He was 84 years old.\n\nMedia, Books, Film\n\nThe Joe DiMaggio / Marilyn Monroe story, however, did not end with either Marilyn’s death in 1962 or DiMaggio’s passing in 1999. The publishing world and the media kept their story alive, in one form or another, for decades. Of course, it has been “the Marilyn Monroe story” that is the primary driver of the media’s continued fascination — with DiMaggio as one part of her story. Still, it is the Monroe travail that has been center stage; told and re-told and spun with all manner of twists and turns, and fueled in later years with conspiracy theories about her death. In any case, the parade of magazine stories, books, films, and on-line lore about Marilyn Monroe is seemingly never ending – some by friends who knew her, business associates, fellow actors and directors, celebrity writers, photographers, documentary film producers and more. All have kept her story going in one form or another for more than 70 years and counting.\n\nA sampling of some of these various works, mostly books, is offered here with cover art in the columns at right (click on images for Amazon.com pages). Others appear in the “Sources” section at the end of this story. This sampling, however, is just that, as hundreds of books alone, have been written about Monroe.\n\nAmong early reporting, for example, was an August 7, 1964 Life magazine feature story by Claire Boothe Luce (wife of publisher Henry Luce), “Marilyn Monroe: What Really Killed Her,” with Marilyn on the cover.\n\nIn 1966, a documentary film titled, The Legend of Marilyn Monroe, appeared, chronicling her life and career, narrated by John Huston, also reissued in later years. By the late 1960s, other books followed: in 1967, Marilyn: An Untold Story by Norman Rosten came out and in 1969, Norma Jean: The life of Marilyn Monroe by Fred Lawrence Guiles was published.\n\nIn August 1972, Ms. Magazine story ran with the title, “Ten Years Later: The Real Marilyn Monroe: The Woman Who Died Too Soon.” In 1973, Norman Mailer’s Marilyn: A Biography (paperback edition shown), sparked controversy with its final chapter that claimed Monroe was murdered by agents of the FBI and CIA who resented her affair with Robert F. Kennedy. Mailer’s wasn’t the first conspiracy offering about her death, as a number of others would follow.\n\nIn 1977, one of the first books focused on the “Joe & Marilyn” story appeared with Robin Moore and Gene Shoor’s book, Marilyn & Joe DiMaggio. Sportswriter Roger Kahn’s book, Joe & Marilyn: A Memory of Love, published by William Morrow (269 pp.) appeared later in 1986 (paperback edition shown at right).\n\nA decade after her death, in mid October 1972, Newsweek ran a cover with a Marilyn Monroe photo, casting her as a nostalgia figure with a banner that read: “Yearning for The Fifties: The Good Old Days.” Ten years later, in July 1982, at the 20th anniversary of her death, McCall’s magazine put her on the cover along with story taglines: “What She Feared The Most,” and “What She’d Look Like Today.” Life magazine, also commemorating her 20-year passing, put Monroe on its August 1982 cover with story tagline: “The Unseen Marilyn: Never Published Photographs – 20 Years After Her Death.”\n\nIn 1985, Anthony Summers’ book, Goddess: The Secret Lives of Marilyn Monroe, was published. Based on over 600 interviews it became a New York Times bestseller. Its later paperback version is shown at right.\n\nIn May 1993, Donald Spoto’s Marilyn Monroe: The Biography, was published by Harper Collins, coming in just under 700 pages and is among the most read Monroe biographies.\n\nMeanwhile, in fiction, Joyce Carol Oates published Blonde, her best-selling 2000 historical novel about Monroe that was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. In May 2001, the popular novel was adapted into a CBS TV mini-series of the same name with Australian actress Poppy Montgomery cast as Monroe in the lead role. Another film version of Blonde, also based on the Joyce Carol Oates novel, is scheduled for release by Netflix in 2022. Oates’ novel, meanwhile, was reissued in April 2020 in a 20th anniversary edition.\n\nAfter the death of Joe DiMaggio in 1999, there was Richard Ben Cramer’s best-selling, Joe DiMaggio: The Hero’s Life, published in 2000 by Simon & Schuster. It included quite a bit of Marilyn Monroe narrative.\n\nIn September 2006, a Marilyn Monroe autobiography appeared with the tile, My Story, written with Bent Hecht and illustrated with Milton Greene photographs.\n\nIn the Sunday supplement world, meanwhile, the July 28th, 2008 edition of Parade magazine ran a cover story entitled, “The Marilyn You Don’t Know” by Liz Smith.\n\nIn August 2009, J. Randy Tarabor-relli’s The Secret Life of Marilyn Monroe (576 pp.) was published, becoming a New York Times bestseller.\n\nA year later, in October 2010, Monroe’s Fragments: Poems, Intimate Notes, Letters (from her estate) was published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux, edited by Bernard Comment. This book had a popular following and was positively received by many readers.\n\nIn March 2011, Jerome Charyn’s book, Joe DiMaggio: The Long Vigil, was published by Yale University Press (192 pp).\n\nMy Week with Marilyn is a 2011 film drama starring Michelle Williams as Monroe, along with Kenneth Branagh, Dominic Cooper, Julia Ormond, Emma Watson, Judi Dench and others, based on two books by Colin Clark depicting the making of the 1957 film, The Prince and the Showgirl. Released in November 2011 in the U.S. and UK, the film received generally positive reviews, while Williams and Branagh were nominated for Academy Awards.\n\nIn July 2012, Lois Banner’s Marilyn: The Passion and the Paradox was published by Bloomsbury USA (528 pp). Banner is one of the founders of the field of women’s history.\n\nIn November 2012, HBO aired the documentary film, “Love, Marilyn,” which is performed through the readings of Monroe’s personal diaries and letters by more than 20 actors and others – Elizabeth Banks, Ellen Burstyn, Glenn Close, Viola Davis, etc – exploring her life and personal thoughts. “…[T]his slick documentary,” said one New York Times review, “is also a respectful love letter to Monroe…”\n\nIn May 2015, “The Secret Life of Marilyn Monroe” aired as a made-for-TV drama miniseries on the Lifetime channel. Based on J. Randy Taraborrelli’s 2009 bestseller of the same name (listed earlier above), the film starred Kelli Garner, Susan Sarandon, Emily Watson, and others.\n\nAmong books by various photographers featuring still photos of Monroe is David Wills’ 2015 book, Marilyn In the Flash: Her Love Affair With The Press, 1945-1962, published by Dey Street Books (256 pp). There are at least 80 other photographers who did work with Monroe, some with their own books.\n\nA 2005 PBS American Masters documentary, “Marilyn Monroe: Still Life,” claims she was the most photographed person in history.\n\nOver the years since her death, a number of popular magazines – Time, Life, Newsweek, Playboy and others – have run various special collections or anniversary editions on Monroe. In April 2016, Vanity Fair turned out one of these special editions for her 90th birthday, “Marilyn Monroe: The Movies, The Myths, The Men.”\n\nIn May 2018, Michelle Morgan’s book, The Girl: Marilyn Monroe, The Seven Year Itch, and the Birth of an Unlikely Feminist was published by Running Press (320 pp). And in August of that year, Charles Casillo’s book, Marilyn Monroe: The Private Life of a Public Icon (368 pp), was published by St. Martin’s Press.\n\nAgain, the above listing of books, films, and documentaries on Marilyn Monroe — and others appearing below in “Sources” — is only offered as an historic sampling, and does not comprise a complete list. As this is written in early 2022, a four-part CNN documentary, Reframed: Marilyn Monroe, has appeared, and with the 60th anniversary of her death in August 2022, there will likely be more Monroe offerings to come.\n\nIn any case, Marilyn Monroe has left a legacy in popular culture that few can top. The American Film Institute named her the sixth greatest female screen legend in American film history, and the Smithsonian included her on its list of “100 Most Significant Americans of All Time.”\n\nVariety and VH1 list her in the top ten of 20th century pop culture icons. She has also influenced a range of artists and entertainers, from Andy Warhol to Madonna.\n\nA valuable business asset in life and in death, she has appeared in ads for Chanel, Mercedes-Benz, and Absolut Vodka, among others.\n\nIn 2011, Forbes magazine listed her as the third highest-earning dead celebrity, with an income at that time of $27 million. She also appeared on the same Forbes list, 2018-thru-2020.\n\nWikipedia’s page, “Marilyn Monroe in Pop-ular Culture,” offers an extensive listing of her influence across film, photography, art, music, theater, and more. There are also a number of fan clubs and websites about her.\n\nYet, despite her cultural renown, Marilyn Monroe was a tortured soul for much of her short life, dealing with a series of troubled relationships and sizeable insecurities while trying to make her way in the often exploitive world of Hollywood entertainment.\n\nOf related possible interest at this website are the following stories: “The Jack Pack, Pt. 2,” mostly about JFK and Rat Pack celebrities, but also includes a section on Marilyn Monroe; “Candle in Wind,” a 1973 hit song by Elton John about Monroe; and the “Rosie The Riveter” story, with sidebar, “Marilyn ‘Rosie’ Monroe,” exploring her time in WWII factory where she was discovered by photographer David Conover.\n\nThanks for visiting — and if you like what you find here, please make a donation to help support the research, writing, and continued publication of this website.
