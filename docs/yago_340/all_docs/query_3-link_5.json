        "text": "Marilyn Monroe’s shortest and perhaps most highly-publicized marriage was to baseball player Joe DiMaggio. It was front page news when the couple tied the knot on Jan. 14, 1954, but they would only be married for nine months before Monroe filed for divorce.\n\nThroughout their relationship, DiMaggio was jealous, controlling and alleged physically abusive. A publicity stunt intended to promote “The Seven Year Itch” led to the dissolution of their marriage. In the now iconic scene, Monroe stands over a subway grate as the skirt of her dress blows in the air. It was filmed in front of a crowd on Lexington Avenue in New York, causing DiMaggio to spiral into a fit of rage.\n\nDespite their tumultuous marriage, Monroe and DiMaggio remained friends until her death. He helped her recover after multiple surgeries and DiMaggio even picked his ex-wife up from a psychiatric clinic after she was hospitalized for depression. There were briefly rumors of a reunion between the couple, though she went on to marry playwright Arthur Miller.\n\nHere, we take a look at their wedding day and marriage through the years."
