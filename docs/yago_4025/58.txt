Emilio Estevez, director and co-star with his brother Charlie Sheen of the Showtime movie Rated X, has purchased a newly built home on slightly more than an acre in Malibu for about-$2 million.

Estevez also just sold his former oceanfront home nearby for about $3-million.

Rated X premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January. The film is based on the true story of brothers Jim and Artie Mitchell, who became pornography kings (Behind the Green Door, 1971) and destroyed themselves in the process.

Estevez co-starred with former Wings TV star Steven Weber in the movie Late Last Night, released earlier this year.

Estevez, 38, was part of the 1980s' Brat Pack, a group of young Hollywood stars. His father is actor Martin Sheen, who plays the president of the United States in the hit NBC series The West Wing.

Estevez previously starred in such movies as Young Guns (1988), Young Guns II (1990) and The Mighty Ducks (1992). He appeared in the movie Mission: Impossible (1996).

He also directed, produced and starred in the movie The War at Home (1996), about a troubled veteran who returns home to a troubled family.

Estevez's new home is Spanish in style and has four bedrooms, a breakfast room, a guest house, a courtyard, a patio with a fountain and a barbecue; a pool, a spa and gardens. The gated home, described as having Old World charm, also has a brick drive.
