        "text": "I have been an avid fan of both Ramón (Martin Sheen) and Emilio Estévez since I was a young child. The two are men of great skill and projects who are, in my opinion, the best father and son team in the film industry. The two have captivated fans across the world for years and have most recently teamed together to create the great heartfelt film, The Way. The film, currently in theaters widely since October 7, 2011, has gained me a further appreciate for family, friends and the perfect stranger.\n\nNot only have the two given fans a country-wide bus tour that recently ended, Emilio has personally attended two chats with his many fans, both of which I have been a part of, asking the first question on the latter phone chat. The two hours he spent with fans, just last night, were a great inspiration to them as fans and Emilio treated each other as if they were the best of friends, showing each other that they see the average human being and not a notable man.\n\nI, myself had the chance and honor to meet both Ramón and Emilio just last month on the 13th. The two were very generous and gratuitous to me and treated me with trust and as if I were their best friend. As the experience was one of a more personal nature, I’d rather keep the details to a minimum, but they were kind to all fans they came into contact with and I spent most of the time conversing normal topics with them and not asking for autographs.\n\nEmilio discussed his newest project, one that will take place in and be filmed in Ohio entitled Johnny Longshot. He also expressed his intentions for further fan chats, but personally, I advise that if you attend them, to treat him as a normal human being and not a celebrity. Many fans tend to forget these things when around people they admire and he seems to appreciate being treated as such."
