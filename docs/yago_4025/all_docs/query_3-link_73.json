The series explores the most intimate human dimensions of the greatest cataclysm in history — a worldwide catastrophe that touched the lives of every family on every street in every town in America — and demonstrates that in extraordinary times, there are no ordinary lives.\n\nThe film honors the bravery, endurance, and sacrifice of the generation of Americans who lived through what will always be known simply as The War."
