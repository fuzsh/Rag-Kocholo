        "text": "When Emilio Estevez’s Mighty Ducks character, Gordon Bombay, exited the ice rink in the third Mighty Ducks movie 25 years ago, Estevez followed suit—exiting the mainstream Hollywood acting arena. Earlier that year, Estevez had made a memorable cameo in Mission: Impossible’s opening sequence—playing an IMF tech expert who meets a grisly demise in an elevator shaft while Tom Cruise does his slick spy thing in a tuxedo.\n\n“It was like, okay, I need to rebrand myself,” Estevez recently told Vanity Fair, citing that moment as what made him realize he’d veered away from what drew him to Hollywood in the first place. “I didn’t get into this business to be rich or famous. I got into this business because I love moviemaking.” Following the reportedly $80 million Tom Cruise franchise flick, the actor went full indie.\n\nNow, though, he’s charting a return to the mainstream via The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers, premiering on Disney+ Friday. Before the show’s debut, the actor spent a long phone call with Vanity Fair reflecting on his career and the misguided perception that he—the son of Martin Sheen and brother of Charlie Sheen—is some kind of Hollywood royalty. Estevez never took his father’s stage surname—because he figured he hadn’t earned it—and is currently living happily in Cincinnati. During our call, he also got real about his career misses—“I’ve done some forgettable shit too…. There’s no avoiding it”—and the difficulty he had transitioning back to Disney fare after decades mired in gritty indies.\n\nVanity Fair: My friend Laura lives in Cincinnati and brings you up in conversations as proof of how cool the city is.\n\nEmilio Estevez: It’s so cool! I love being able to tell people in L.A. or New York, either come visit us to see what the hell is going on, or please stay away. One or the other. But I think when they get there, their minds are blown at everything that’s going on in Cincy—between the breweries and the restaurants and the historical preservation of the architecture. It’s a really magical city. I call it the Paris of the Midwest. I didn’t coin that, but that’s how I feel about it.\n\nWhat brought you back to Cincinnati?\n\nSo my mom was born in Cincy, my dad is from Dayton. I was on a national tour with my film The Way; our last stop was in Cincy and Kristen Schlotman, who runs the Film Commission, said, “Hey, you should stick around and see what Cincy has to offer.” And I did. That began the love affair back in 2010. And in the last 10 years, the city has just exploded.\n\nThere’s a ton of innovation. And you think about the corporations that are headquartered in Cincinnati! You’ve got Kroger…You’ve got Procter & Gamble. You’ve got Cintas. There are a lot of economic reasons to be there. Cost of living is just, it’s like, ‘Oh, my God, it’s affordable!\"\n\nYou’re returning to another one of your roots with The Mighty Ducks reboot—25 years after your last film with the franchise, when you traded mainstream acting roles for indie filmmaking.\n\nIt has come full circle to a certain extent. Independent filmmaking was a choice. Nobody put a gun to my head and said, “You have to do this.” But it’s very costly—financially, yes. But emotionally and spiritually it can be devastating. Especially if you make a film that doesn’t wow the critics or get the audience, which I’ve experienced both…. Or you find yourself holding the door open for audiences in the theater as they are walking out of your film.\n\nWait, I need to hear this story.\n\nI was at the premiere of Rated X at Sundance, and I stood in the back of the theater after introducing the film. I held the door open for people who were walking out. They didn’t recognize me until they got right next to me. They were certainly less embarrassed than I was for holding the door open for them to leave.\n\nDo you remember what they were saying about the movie?\n\nNo. I think I probably blocked that out. A few years after that I’m at the Venice Film Festival for Bobby, which was in competition, and we get this seven-minute standing ovation, which at the time was the longest standing ovation in the history of the festival. And then we go on to get nominated for a Golden Globe for best picture. The highs and the lows are so extreme.\n\nThat’s a pretty wild fluctuation.\n\nI was telling a friend of mine recently about an experience that I had while we were shooting The Breakfast Club in Chicago. A small cult movie I did called Repo Man came out, and Siskel and Ebert argued on television about the merits of the film. Roger Ebert loved it and Gene Siskel hated it. And on air Gene said, “Well, I’m going to see it a second time because I missed everything you’re talking about, Roger.”\n\nSo, that weekend I took Judd Nelson and Anthony Michael Hall to see Repo Man, and there were maybe six people in the theater. Gene Siskel sat right behind us. And I think somewhere through the course of the film, he got up and walked out. So he wasn’t going to change his mind.\n\nDid he know it was you in front of him?\n\nNo, he didn’t know it was me. I looked back and realized it was him behind us. I said, “We better laugh really loud at the funny parts.” But, yeah, we couldn’t sway him [laughs].\n\nWere you aware that these wild highs and lows were par for the course in Hollywood after watching your father’s career? Or was it something you had to experience on your own?\n\nI’ve watched my father go through it. You know, he would do a film and have wild expectations—this was going to be the movie that was going to change his career and change the way people felt about him. And of course it never was the one you thought it was going to be.\n\nAnd then the movie you don’t think will hit is the one that redefines him. Apocalypse Now was the movie that almost killed him—and that’s probably the film that he’ll be remembered for the most. [Martin Sheen has spoken about his struggle with alcoholism, which arguably climaxed during Francis Ford Coppola’s famously intense film shoot.]\n\nDo you look back on any project specifically and think, “Why did I do that?”\n\nOh, God, yeah. I’m not speaking out of class because he knows it’s a terrible movie, but Stephen King often talks about his one directorial experience on Maximum Overdrive, which I was in. The few times that I’ve connected with him over the years, he’s like, “Can you forgive me for that?”\n\nI think at one point my mom said, “Why’d you do that movie?” I said, “I wanted to work with Stephen King.” And she said, “Couldn’t you have helped him paint his house?”\n\nHave there been roles you’ve missed out on that have haunted you?\n\nEvery actor will tell you, sure…[but] so much of it is luck and timing. And you know, when you start out as a young actor, you don’t fully understand that there’s probably already an offer out to somebody and they’re just waiting for him to say yes or no. Like for instance, I auditioned for Sixteen Candles.\n\nOh, really?\n\nI killed the audition. I mean, I thought I wowed John Hughes and wowed the room. They were all laughing. I nailed this. And I was skipping down the hall at Universal Studios when I left and I thought, You know, I’m going to be in this movie. And the casting director ran out and he’s like, “Hey, listen, man…”\n\nIt was literally one of those heartbreak moments where he just puts his arm over my shoulder and he’s like, “Look, Emil, this ain’t going to happen.” I’m like, “What do you mean? I killed it!” He’s like, “Yeah. It’s just not going to happen.”\n\nWhich role were you auditioning for?\n\nMichael Schoeffling’s part. [Schoeffling played Molly Ringwald’s love interest, Jake Ryan.] The strapping handsome guy with that chiseled jaw. Obviously, when you see the movie, it makes sense [I didn’t get the part]. I’m more of a ham-and-egger. I’m scrappy. I’ve never been that guy.\n\nHollywood has undergone a seismic shift with #MeToo and Time’s Up. People have begun revisiting John Hughes movies especially and seeing them through a new lens—with Molly Ringwald and Ally Sheedy speaking about some of the story points in the Brat Pack movies that bothered them. Are you going back and looking at these films through a new lens too?\n\nIf I don’t have to look at my movies, I don’t. You know what I mean? I know Molly was very vocal in taking another look at Breakfast Club. I think that every piece of art, whether it’s a film or a song or a painting, is a victim of its own time. It’s sort of preserved in amber, if you will. And so, are we going to smash all of that amber and ask the question, “What were we thinking?” Well, what we were thinking, in that moment, wasn’t questioned. So I think you have to look at it in a different way—it’s less about the movie and more about the minds behind the making of those films and what were they thinking.\n\nAs someone who has been in Hollywood for decades, has it been interesting for you to watch this whole reckoning unfold within and around the industry?\n\nOf course. A lot of people give my dad more credit than he deserves in terms of how I look at the world. My worldview was shaped more through my mom than my father. And she has always instilled in me as a filmmaker and as a writer the importance of strong female characters. She’ll say things just off the cuff that oftentimes become dialogue in my movies.\n\nOh, really?\n\nLike for instance, there’s a scene in Bobby where Sharon Stone is doing Demi Moore’s hair. Demi’s character is drunk and Sharon, she’s a fan, but she’s also doing her hair. There’s this moment when Demi talks about aging. She says, “I wake up one morning and think when did I get that flat ass?” That was something that my mom said.\n\nTell me a little bit more about your mom and her personality.\n\nWell, she was born in Cincinnati to a single mom in a home for unwed mothers. Her mom was a bit of a hell-raiser and didn’t really want to be a mom, so she drove her across the border to Kentucky, dropped her off with her grandparents, and said, “You raise her.” They did up until my mom was about six years old. Then her mother showed up and said, “Okay, Janet, you’re coming with me now.” And my mom said, “Who the hell are you?” For the next 70 years, [she] refused to call her mom.\n\nIn a lot of the independent films that I’ve made, whether it’s Bobby or The Public, there is a shared trauma that the characters have and experience—whether it’s generational, it’s childhood trauma, or whether it’s the trauma that is systemic through racism or homelessness or any combination of that, plus addiction. Trauma is a big part of where I dwell. And I think my mom’s life has informed a lot of that.\n\nThat’s very different from the Hollywood royalty you’re portrayed as being.\n\nNone of us walk the earth pain-free. None of us walk the earth without some measure of trauma. It’s really about how willing you are to acknowledge it. So for me, this notion of Hollywood royalty…I’ve been fortunate enough to sit in a room at a couple of parties where my dad and Al Pacino talk about their lives together struggling in New York as young hungry actors. You couldn’t believe that these two men have arrived now at this place where we all think they’ve been this whole time.\n\nObviously there’s a certain privilege that I’ve enjoyed because my dad is who he is, and did the work and moved us all to California. I acknowledge all of that. But I reject the Hollywood royalty aspect of it because I’ve just never felt like royalty. My dad always said, “This is a job that you’ve chosen. No one held a gun to your head. Do it well and move on to the next one.”\n\nLooping back to your return to The Mighty Ducks—given everything that has happened in the world in the last few years, I feel like the world needs a kind of familiar comfort and good-feeling entertainment. Did that play into your decision to revisit the franchise?\n\nHere’s what’s interesting. Coming out of the independent world where I was making movies that I felt had to be socially relevant and had to be meaningful, I jumped into doing the Ducks. It’s set in the Twin Cities, Minneapolis/St. Paul. We started filming the year and in the same city that George Floyd was murdered. And yet here we were making five hours of television, and we don’t mention it.\n\nSo I pushed back at the producers and at the studio. I said, “You know, guys, we have to acknowledge this. We’re in the middle of a pandemic.” I got on my soapbox and I cried out that I can’t play a character who’s complaining about owning a million-dollar piece of real estate in downtown Minneapolis when the city’s on fire around us. And the pushback was, “This is a show that people need that doesn’t remind them of what’s happening in the world right now. That is the Disney brand. We’re not going to acknowledge the virus; we’re not going to acknowledge the systemic racism; we are going to be comfort food as we shoot these episodes.”\n\nHow tough of a pill was that for you to swallow, realizing that the Mighty Ducks didn’t want to get into those issues?\n\nI got in a huge argument with the showrunners about it. I said, “Look, you’ve got to check your own privilege here. We have an obligation as artists, as storytellers to speak to the times that we’re living in.” And there was pushback.\n\nDid that argument change your feelings on or commitment to the reboot?\n\nNo. I understood it. There’s a lot at stake financially in doing a show like this and committing to five hours of content…. So, obviously this interview got a lot darker and deeper probably than either of us were expecting.\n\nIt’s a dark time. What are you hoping people take from reboot?\n\nI think if we can be a little bit of a silver lining and solace in what’s been a very, very dark year…It’s difficult to shoot a show during COVID. Masks on, masks off, no community on set…. There wasn’t an opportunity to socialize or sit on set and tell stories because once the scene wrapped, you were escorted off to your trailer and basically in isolation. For any show that was filming during COVID, you’re creating a world which is completely artificial. You’re celebrating and you’re yelling and you’re in an arena and there’s sports being played and you’re hugging at the victories—and last year, none of that happened.\n\nAnd in the middle of all that, when Tom Cruise’s moment happened on the set of Mission: Impossible—[I] thought, You know what? He's absolutely right.\n\nOh, really?\n\nOne hundred percent right. Oh, yeah. I agreed with every word that came out of his mouth. Every expletive. And what you could hear in his voice was, I think, the fact that it was absolutely vital to adhere to the protocols. Not just in our industry, but all of the service industries that exist as a result of the film industry operating properly.\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair\n\n— Woody Allen, Dylan Farrow, and the Long, Uphill Road to a Reckoning\n\n— The Fall of Armie Hammer: A Family Saga of Sex, Money, Drugs, and Betrayal\n\n— Justice League: The Shocking, Heartbreaking True Story of the #SnyderCut\n\n— Jimmy Kimmel Breaks Down in Emotional Interview With Ady Barkan\n\n— Sharon Stone on How Basic Instinct Nearly Broke Her, Before Making Her a Star\n\n— Oscar Nomination Snubs and Surprises: Delroy Lindo, Aaron Sorkin Strike Out\n\n— Raya and the Last Dragon’s Kelly Marie Tran Believes Her Disney Princess Is Gay\n\n— From the Archive: Who Stole the Oscars?\n\n— Not a subscriber?
