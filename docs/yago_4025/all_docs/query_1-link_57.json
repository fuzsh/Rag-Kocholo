        "text": "Being on point for the re-release of Emilio Estevez's film \"The Way\" has been deeply rewarding, yet at the same time it has been a very delicate and complicated dance between mainstream media, evangelical and catholic PR firms, as well as internal efforts to maintain the filmmaker's vision and goals. I am so proud of where we've gotten, and where we are headed with this film and its imminent sequel. This theatrical re-release includes special bonus content from our friend, travel icon #RickSteves. When I cold-emailed Rick's \"generic email\" in March, I never thought I'd hear back. But, when the phone rang 24-hours later with Rick on the other end, I knew we'd come up with a special partnership, and additive content for \"The Way.\" “The Way is one of seven films I have directed to date and the movie is perhaps the best known and most loved of my efforts as a filmmaker. The Way, has become a legacy project for me. Inspired by my son, Taylor, starring my father Martin and dedicated to my Spanish grandfather Francisco Estevez, born a mere fifty miles from Santiago de Compostela in 1898. I have never created a motion picture that has had more of an impact on so many people around the world. Coming out of the pandemic, The Way is more timely now than when we originally embarked on this journey 12 years ago. People are emerging from isolation and are yearning to gather and travel again. I believe The Way is the film we need at a time when we need it the most.\" - Writer/Director Emilio Estevez See \"The Way\" in theaters one-day-only on May 16! https://lnkd.in/gRSs7jSt"
