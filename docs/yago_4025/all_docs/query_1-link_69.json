And we’re here today to talk about a few things among which are my favorite movies, The Shawshank Redemption, Apocalypse Now, Pulp Fiction and No Country for Old Men. We’re also going to talk about The Way, which is a film that I have coming back out in theaters across the United States. It’s a re-release, which is unusual in and of itself. I’m pleased to be here and thank you for joining us.\n\nGEMMA Hello and welcome to the Letterboxd Show. I’m Gemma. Mitchell is also here and we have some important business to take care of today. Let me read this Letterboxd review of The Breakfast Club by Cody Cannon, who writes, “The world needs an Emilio Estevez comeback.” Well, Cody Emilio never actually went away. The star of one of Mitchell’s favorite films of all time, Repo Man, is right here, right now on the Letterboxd Show.\n\nMITCHELL It is true. Emilio is here to take us through his four favorites, which he just told us about. A quartet of major heavy hitters, Apocalypse Now, The Shawshank Redemption, No Country for Old Men and Pulp Fiction, and will be diving more into his 2010 film The Way which is being re released in theaters from Fathom Events one day only on May 16th. So tie up your shoelaces nice and tight because we’re taking a walk with Emilio. Thank you so much Emilio, for hanging out with us today. How are you doing?\n\nEMILIO I’m doing very well, Mitchell. Thank you so much for having me back on the show. Now you know I was just introduced to Letterboxd at the Sun Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago. They pointed this camera and they said, “Talk about your four favorite movies and this is Letterboxd.” I was like, “Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second.” That’s not something that... It’s like asking what your four favorite books are or your favorite meals. It’s not an easy thing to answer. And so I did my best. I think I picked four pictures that are probably a lot of people’s favorite. However, I think I did pretty well given the scope and the time of which I was given to come up with that.\n\nGEMMA It’s a beautiful thing and we will get into The Way a little later in the show, but it’s a beautiful thing that Letterboxd started in 2011, The Way came out in 2010. So this particular film of yours and our platform for film lovers have been having a life together. And since Letterboxd came out, there have been beautiful reviews of The Way landing on our platform like this one from Lexi, “I love the Camino De Santiago and Grumpy Martin Sheen.” I mean, this is what you’ve been missing out on up until three weeks ago. I’m just saying.\n\nEMILIO No, this is wonderful. So thank you.\n\nGEMMA Let’s get the fangirling out of The Way early because I don’t think my nerves can take it if we don’t just sort of clear the air and I’m lost for words to be in your company. So I’m going to dig into-\n\nEMILIO Oh, please.\n\nGEMMA ...Letterboxd, to help me express a few things about your ongoing legacy and still very living legacy in filmmaking from the Big Large on Letterboxd, a review of Young Guns, “Can I be as hot as Emilio Estevez?”\n\nEMILIO Good lord. I don’t even know what to say to that. I was just like, “Yeah.”\n\nGEMMA See? Speechless.\n\nEMILIO I was [inaudible 00:03:25], okay.\n\nGEMMA Repo Man, Thotty Without Organs. Fascinating Letterboxd handle writes, “Emilio Estevez is so fucking hot.” Yeah, sorry, I promise I’ll stop. Here’s one more. A review of The Public, which you wrote and directed from Michael Vasquez.\n\nEMILIO And I’m also naked in, so if they say that about me, this will be the one that they don’t say, guys.\n\nGEMMA Okay, here we go. Here we go.\n\nEMILIO Look at that.\n\nGEMMA Are you ready for it?\n\nEMILIO He should have have done more sit-ups.\n\nGEMMA Micheal Vasquez does not mention nudity. “Emilio Estevez’s heart is in the right place.”\n\nEMILIO All right. Yes, it’s inside of my chest where I’d like to keep for at least the next, I don’t know, 30 years, 40 years. I think I might have that.\n\nMITCHELL To get my fangirling out of The Way quickly, gemma did mention the Repo Man is one of my all-time favorite films. But what I wanted... What I was curious Emilio for you, because Repo Man is... The four films that you’ve brought to us, your four faves, are all heavy, heavy hitters. They’re all four of them in the top 100 highest rated films on Letterboxd of all time.\n\nRepo Man though is, it’s very highly rated, but it’s also taken a little bit of time to get there. It is the definition of a cult classic. I discovered it in my mid-twenties. And I was curious for you, because it is a very particular kind of movie, when you get kind of stopped on the street for somebody to ask you about Repo Man, can you recognize immediately when someone’s coming up to you, if this person is going to be a Repo Man fan versus somebody who’s going to ask you about The Mighty Ducks or The Breakfast Club?\n\nEMILIO Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. If you were to approach me on the street and you would say, “Oh man, I loved you in…” I would almost be able to say, Repo Man, just from-\n\nMITCHELL I give off the Repo Man vibes.\n\nEMILIO Yes, you give off the Repo Man vibe. Definitely give off the Repo Man vibe. I can-\n\nMITCHELL I’m going to take that as a compliment.\n\nGEMMA Confirmed, confirmed.\n\nEMILIO No, no, it is a compliment. It is a compliment. And what’s interesting, I’m always surprised when I get it wrong. When I get it wrong it’s always about The Way. I immediately know that’s a Maximum Overdrive guy, or that’s a Young Guns guy, and they’ll come in and it’s like, “I love The Way. The Way, it’s like it changed my life.” It’s like, “Dude, really? Really? You’re a Maximum Overdrive guy. You’re not a Way guy.” Stop it.\n\nGEMMA It’s like The Way is the new Shantaram.\n\nEMILIO You’re a Young Guns guy. Tell me you’re a Young Guns guy. No way. You’re not that deep. You don’t look deep.\n\nGEMMA I love it. I love it. Fangirling.\n\nEMILIO Madness, madness.\n\nGEMMA Okay, we’re going to get you to do some fangirling now because-\n\nEMILIO Uh-oh.\n\nGEMMA ...Harry Dean Stanton. I loved him in Repo Man. I have to say I loved him more, and I know you went in this film, but your mates are, in Pretty in Pink. He was the best 80s dad as Andy’s dad in Pretty in Pink. But—\n\nEMILIO Yes.\n\nGEMMA ...you got to spend your days riding around with him in Repo Man. Can we just tell us about Harry?\n\nEMILIO Harry is, he was, he took no prisoners and he always demanded your attention on set. And if he felt like you were not being authentic or if he felt like you were full of it, he would call you out in front of everyone. He didn’t care, whether it was me or the director or whomever. And so the only person he didn’t give a hard time to was Robby Müller, our extraordinary cinematographer who is the gentlest man and obviously had worked with Herzog. He’s one of the most incredible DPs and Harry had a soft spot for Robby and he never gave him any shit. Can we say shit on the show?\n\nGEMMA Yeah. Look-\n\nMITCHELL You can say whatever you want, man.\n\nGEMMA Someone made me say Emilio Estevez is fucking hot. You can say shit. I mean, come on.\n\nEMILIO All right, very well. So working with Harry was just... And again, I was 20 years old, I think I was just turned 20 on that film, so I was real... Of course, I’d been on a lot of film sets, but now here I was working with Harry, working with Alex Cox in this wild movie that on the page, it never made a whole lot of sense. It was just like, okay, we’ll do this, and then there’s this scene. And yet it was all connected by the lattice work of coincidence, as you know.\n\nMITCHELL And there’s a lot of reviews of Repo Man that mentioned your earring in it as a very distinctive look. And going through more Letterboxd reviews that mention your name, Gemma pulled out a very important question that we have for you, which is, “What is your favorite of all of your movie hairdos? Your Young Guns sideburns or your Stakeout porn ’stache?”\n\nEMILIO I like the Stakeout porn ’stache. I think that was a good look for sure. And in fact, we did a very lamentable sequel to that and the only funny moment in the sequel was there’s a scene between Richard Dreyfus and Rosie O’Donnell, and when he says it or she says that I need to shave my mustache so I look younger like their son. And so I push back and I say to Rosie, I said, “I’ve had this mustache for 10 years. How long have you had yours?” It was so funny we couldn’t get through it. We could not get through the scene. We were laughing so hard.\n\nSo yes, I’m partial to the porn ’stache guy, mustache, but I also like the Repo Man do because it was, talk about an effortless haircut and there was no grooming. You just got out of the shower and there it was.\n\nGEMMA Oh man.\n\nEMILIO And that was, I think, the shortest my hair has ever been, with the exception of a movie I did called Rated X, where Charlie and I actually shaved our heads. So that was actually the shortest haircut I’ve ever had.\n\nMITCHELL Yeah, I mean, that’s very easy to maintain. I’ve done the shaved head a look a few times, and it’s very... You wake up a lot more refreshed with a shaved head.\n\nEMILIO Yes.\n\nGEMMA We need to get into your four favorites now that we’ve got the fangirling out of the way, although there’ll be more, I’m sure. Here’s a fun Letterboxd fact. All four of your picks are on a popular Letterboxd list entitled, “I’m sixteen and this is the greatest movie ever made.” So, no shade, tell us what you were like at sixteen-years-old. What were you up to? What movie were you making? And in fact, this is the segue into Apocalypse Now because you’d not long come off actually being in the Philippines with your dad getting pulled out of quicksand by a too young Laurence Fishburne.\n\nEMILIO That’s right, that’s right. You know what’s interesting, when I was a kid, when I was in my teens, you think about the movies that were made at the time, they were a-list movies. You had Raging Bull. There was Ordinary People, there was *The Godfather*s, all of these, the studios really cared about the movies they made. And every movie was an event, every movie was special, and every movie was handled in a way that made you want to go see it.\n\nSo for me, going to the movies was a very personal experience, not because I just grew up on film sets and I knew obviously behind the scenes, I knew how the sausage was made. Yet still, I’ve found sitting in a theater with an audience of strangers and being transported to a different time, a different place was still a magical thing.\n\nSo even though I knew that there was someone behind the curtain, I still allowed myself to be transported. I was still caught up in the magic. When we were in the Philippines shooting Apocalypse Now I was 14 years old, I knew that Francis was making something special. I knew that he was looking at an enormous canvas in the same way that on the set of Badlands when I was 10 and watching Terrence Malick work, it was like I knew that these were painters, they were painting. You have to imagine what it was like during the Renaissance and watching these masters work and painting these extraordinary canvases. You have to imagine that on the set with Terrence Malick, on the set with Coppola, you were in the presence of a master. And so everything after that sort of was kind of a letdown.\n\nI’d go, “Well, where are the explosions?” No, it was... So in many ways I was spoiled by being on those sets, by being in the presence of directors like that. But the experience of being in the Philippines and being on that set, and I don’t know if you guys know this, but I actually worked on the film. I was an extra in the Do Lung Bridge sequence.\n\nGEMMA You’re a messenger boy.\n\nEMILIO I was a messenger boy, and I was on an M60 machine gun which was bigger than I was. Gio Coppola and I, Francis’ son, we were in this scene together, but I didn’t tell anybody in the crew that I was connected to the star of the film. And so Jerry Ziesmer, the AD, said, “Well, now you’re just treating me like another extra?” And he says, “You know, you’ll be here and when Martin Sheen runs past you, you’re going to scream for a medic.\" I said, \"Okay, that’s great.” And again, these were giant set pieces, so if you got your line wrong or if you got the timing wrong, a reset was going to be hours. So I said, “Hold on Jerry, let me get this straight. When my dad runs past me—” and he says, “Wait a minute, who’s your dad?”\n\nI said, “Martin.” He says, “What the hell are you doing here?” And I said, “I’m in the shot. The messenger boy.” You could see his brain just trying to get around that. It was like, it was like just nothing. It just didn’t add up for him. So we did the shot and then I hit the cue and it was up. And then Francis cut it out of the... So, anyway.\n\nMITCHELL What a shame. What a shame. I’m sure it was a great performance.\n\nEMILIO I’m sure it was not.\n\nMITCHELL Speaking to-\n\nEMILIO I’m almost sure that Francis probably saw the footage and said, \"Who’s this child?\"\n\nMITCHELL No, no, no. He said it was too good, it’s going to distract from the rest of the movie if we leave it in here.\n\nGEMMA [inaudible 00:14:33] share with his father, we have this.\n\nMITCHELL Well, speaking of seeing how the sausage gets made, we’re curious, having Apocalypse Now as one of your four favorite films of all time, is that partly because you were literally part of the madness? Or is it because even if you had nothing to do with the film, if you weren’t on the set, you would go sit in a theater and watch it and just be overcome by the greatness that you’re seeing on screen in front of you.\n\nEMILIO No, indeed. And when the film opened, you had to buy tickets. And the same thing with The Deer Hunter, you had to buy your tickets in advance, like you were going to a concert. And there was a place to watch it, a theater in Los Angeles called the Cinerama Dome.\n\nGEMMA Yes, the Cinerama.\n\nEMILIO And when the film came out, I bought my tickets in advance and I waited in line and the line would be around the block and I would do this week after week after week, I’d buy my tickets, I’d wait in line, I’d go to the Dome because I couldn’t believe it. It was a version without credits so they handed out flyers, which were the credit list. Was the version that also, that they didn’t blow up the Kurtz compound at the end. But I kept taking my friends that knew that I had left the states and they knew that I was on location, but I wanted them to understand what it was like over there and the madness, because I’d told them the stories, I’d written letters.\n\nIt was impossible to call people because it would take three hours to make a phone call from the Philippines to the United States. So you’d put the call in and then you’d go to sleep and then they’d wake you up, “Hey, we’ve got your connection.” So that’s how long it would take to stay in touch and to actually have a conversation with someone. So it was a lot of letters, and I was explaining the madness. So now the movie’s out and I’m taking this friend and that friend, and, “You have to see this. You have to understand what was going on.” And it was spectacle.\n\nWhen you think about how important the movie is, it exists on a level of importance on so many different levels. And most of all, it’s because it’s about our failed policy, not only in Vietnam, but around the world and the blowback from that, which we’re still experiencing over and over and over again. It was about this folly, this American imperialism, this war machine, and an effort to suppress and subjugate people in a foreign land with our military might in our aggression and our Americanism.\n\nThe movie’s even more important now than when it was released because when you think about it, we were only out of the conflict a few years when we were shooting it. And then when it came out, Vietnam had just ended officially in ’75. So it wasn’t that long after the conflict had ended when here are these tons of movies coming home and The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now and on and on. But it was about our failed attempts at inflicting our morality which was so immoral.\n\nGEMMA And not just on Vietnam because it’s based on Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, which is set in the late 18th century about a different colonial incursion.\n\nEMILIO That’s right.\n\nGEMMA And so we’re not just talking about one war.\n\nEMILIO That’s right.\n\nGEMMA We’re talking about hundreds of years of colonial incursion. And I think-\n\nEMILIO That’s right.\n\nGEMMA ...when I was watching it, I felt like I was watching a Republican presidential campaign, this kind of shadowy, this mission never existed, but we are choosing you to be the guy to depose the other guy.\n\nEMILIO That’s right.\n\nGEMMA Then it’s just absolute razing of lands and then you get to the top of the river and then suddenly you are the guy. And I couldn’t stop thinking about that. I just feel like I’m watching Republicans take the House and then fuck it all the pieces.\n\nEMILIO Well it’s The Odyssey, isn’t it? That film is really The Odyssey and it’s, here’s the mission. And Robert Duvall’s character is the cyclops and the Playboy bunnies are the sirens. Ultimately they are similar tropes, just told in a different way. Speaking of different way, my film The Way is not dissimilar in that you have a journey, and we don’t have Colonel Kurtz, but we have Santiago de Compostela, which is a little more gentle than ultimately what Willard finds at the end of his journey, but it’s still a journey. And how well you remember The Way, I don’t know, but we have our own cyclops in El Ramon, who is this mad man, and we have our own siren with the big hotel in Leon.\n\nGEMMA But you do something so beautifully different with The Way when I was watching it and thinking about how it mirrors Apocalypse Now or any other journey based film, your father Martin plays Tom, who’s a bereaved father walking the Santiago de Compostela.\n\nEMILIO De Compostela, yes. Santiago de Compostela.\n\nGEMMA Yeah. So he’s walking out, he’s an American, he’s never really traveled. He’s sitting there with his guidebook. He’s convinced that he knows the right way to ask for a snack. He just doesn’t. And I love the way that you make light of the sort of ignorance, I guess, the ignorance of the American going into another place. And on top of that, you introduced the Basque, you introduce the Gypsies. So you are also paying attention to the indigenous Spaniards that they meet along the way. You’re not just going, “American in Spain. And Spain is an amorphous single population.”\n\nEMILIO No and that was very intentional. In fact, when we were shooting in the Basque region, there were some lines in the script that the government and Nevada objected to. And I said, “Look man, this is reality.” They said, “Yeah, but if you’re going to get our support, you have to change this.” So I was up, we had a 7:00 AM call, I was up till 3:00 in the morning with my son trying to figure out who lived there. I said, “What is it going to take? Under Franco, haven’t these people suffered enough censorship? This is just another example of that. I’m not saying anything in the script that’s untrue.”\n\nAnd he said, “I know, but is there a way?” So we ended up changing one word and that satisfied them. And it was so unremarkable, the word, that I can’t even remember it now as I’m talking about. It was just so foolish, so silly and yet we made the change and we showed them, we made the change and all was forgiven. But now ironically, across all of Nevada are these plaques that are set in steel and they’re photos of me, of Martin, the cast, the rest of the crew. It says, “This is where The Way is filmed.” Check out here, here’s where The Way is filmed all across that part of the Camino. So it’s like, “You’re welcome. You’re welcome.” You wanted to censor me. And now you’re welcome.\n\nMITCHELL Apocalypse Now too is one of those first instances of you being on the set. You mentioned Badlands as well, being on the set with your dad, who you work with so beautifully in The Way. He gives a tremendous performance in The Way.\n\nEMILIO Thank you. Yes, he does.\n\nMITCHELL Obvious Apocalypse Now, the production behind it has been well documented. The documentaries out there, people know that was such a brutal set, a tough one. Your dad’s heart attack, like people having nervous breakdowns on set. And I’m curious, as you said, you’re watching the work of Masters like Malick and Francis Ford Coppola in Apocalypse Now and you’re being in awe of seeing these artists do their thing, but you’re seeing at the same top your dad crumbling under the weight of this performance that he’s having to give. Does that make you afraid to get into acting? Does that make you inspired seeing your dad literally putting his body and his mind on the line for the art that he’s doing here?\n\nEMILIO I think it was inspiring to me as a young man watching the lengths at which filmmakers and actors will go to put something down on film and immortalize it. And I think that, I like to say that some people will talk about, “Well, my work is important, but it’s really, my family is more important than that. And I’m telling my family is more important than that. And the work isn’t…” Hang on. How many obituaries have we all read? Where does it start with the family? Never. It never... Family’s at the bottom. He is survived by, she is survived by, they are survived by.\n\nBefore they get to “they are survived by,” it’s about the work, it’s about the accomplishments, it’s about all of the things, all of those markers before they get to “they are survived by.” So on one hand, you could push back and you say, “Well, was that piece of art worth giving your life for?” And in some instances, if you’re talking about Freejack, no. If you’re talking about\n\nGEMMA Stakeout. Stakeout.\n\nMITCHELL [inaudible 00:24:25] Freejack defenders.\n\nEMILIO No, no, no, no, no.\n\nMITCHELL Kind of a fun movie though. Let’s be honest.\n\nEMILIO This interview is over, but don’t-\n\nGEMMA Mitchell, you’re fired. Sorry. I’m sorry.\n\nEMILIO You’re fired.\n\nMITCHELL I’ll see you guys later. I’m going to go watch Free Jack again.\n\nEMILIO Not worth your life. If you’re talking about Apocalypse, you’re talking about certain things that are going to outlive you, that are going to be at the top of your obituary right after your name, then maybe yes, maybe it is worth it. And then yeah, other part of the argument is, well, they’re not going to bury you with all of your movies, but they’re not going to bury you with your money, your movies. They’re also not going to bury you with any other member of your family.\n\nGEMMA I’ve read in prep for this, we’ve both read quite a few interviews with you and one thing that keeps coming through to me and that you’ve just raised again, is your devotion to work, your dedication to work. And it’s really interesting, especially sort of post, well, we’re not even post pandemic, we’re still in it.\n\nEMILIO Sure.\n\nGEMMA This sort of focus on work-life balance and the importance of mental health and all of these things. And yet, when I saw Moonage Daydream, the beautiful Bowie film by Brett Morgan, the line that stuck with me out of that was that Bowie loved work. He didn’t want things to be perfect, he just wanted to do good work. And I’ve just been really appreciating reading about people who like their work, because we spend a lot of our time doing work. And it does take us away from our families, or in your case, luckily include your family. So I guess I wanted to hear about your philosophy a bit on work. I actually wanted to ask you what the secret to living a good life is. And I suspect in your case it involves good work.\n\nEMILIO Being proud of your work. There’s a wonderful book by an author named John Fante, who wrote a book that was turned into a movie that Colin Farrell was in called Ask the Dust. And he was an LA based writer. He lived down in downtown and he was an Italian American second generation. And he wrote a book called The Brotherhood of the Great. And in the book there are scenes where the father, who’s a bricklayer, takes his son around the town and he says, “You see that building? I laid those bricks.” They walk a little further. “You see that building? I laid those bricks and the buildings are still standing. You see The Way the brick work is? I’m proud of that.” And the son starts to realize that yes, his father may be a disaster personally and a bad husband to his mother and yet the work stance, the work is there and he’s proud of it.\n\nAnd that part of the book has always been something for me where I latched onto because at the end of the day, those buildings like your obit, all of our obits, they’re going to be reflective of what we leave behind. What is your legacy? What are you proud of? I’m proud of that brick building. I’m proud of this. I’m proud of The Way.\n\nYou guys talk to a lot of directors and actors and we all have a lot of shit on our resumes. We do. It’s just the nature of the business. You’re not going to be proud of everything you do. There’s going to be some buildings that fall down maybe in the next earthquake. But at the end of the day, if you have a couple of films that cross generations, if you could be in one Outsiders or The Breakfast Club, if you can find yourself in a movie like The Way or having made it, and these are those movies, what we’re going to talk about with some of these others, that when they come on screen and you’re flipping channels and you stop on them and you can’t stop watching them.\n\nAnd that is the measure of a movie for me where I one time missed a flight to New York because I started watching Das Boot and I was like, “I can’t stop watching this movie.” And they were like, “Well, your plane and here it’s going” And I was like, “I’m going to miss that flight. I’m going to miss that plane.” And I did. I actually missed the plane.\n\nGEMMA I think half our audience would be listening right now thinking the same thing. Hey, look, speaking of brick buildings and geological knowledge and tiny pickaxes, we do need to move on to your second of your four favorites. Cause we’re fast running out of time, but it’s all good. Let’s go [The Shawshank Redemption], let’s get into it. Let’s get into the pickability of that wall in that cell.\n\nNo, it’s Frank Darabont’s 1994, based on a Stephen King novella, which he sold him the rights for $5,000. And King never cashed the check. He framed it. He gave it back to Frank Darabont who said, “I knew you could do this.” He wrote the script in eight weeks, two weeks after submitting it to Castle Rock Entertainment he had 25 million bucks to make it. Can only dream of that turnaround now. Shout out to film exec Liz Glotzer for threatening to quit if Castle Rock didn’t stump up. And then it had a very soft opening, 16 million box office because Pulp Fiction, one of your other four favorites and Forrest Gump were just storming the cinemas. But it went on to get seven Oscar noms and is now one of those films that people will miss a flight for.\n\nEMILIO They’ll miss their flight for, yes, indeed. And they shot it here in Ohio, matter of fact. It was an abandoned prison that they shot the film in. So it’s got Ohio roots just like I do. And it is one of those movies that you cannot stop watching. And it is really, the construct of the film, it’s absolutely flawless. The performances are off the charts extraordinary. Morgan and Tim, and I mean, the entire cast. It’s flawless. If you look at Die Hard as that perfect action movie in terms of all the notes in it, this is that perfect prison movie if there could be such a thing. It’s that you feel like you’re in there with these guys, you feel like you’re incarcerated with them. And when Tim is liberated at the end, you are with him. It is immersive in so many ways. And I love the show and how well it’s shot. It’s so beautifully shot.\n\nMITCHELL Yeah. One thing that I find really interesting with [The Shawshank Redemption] over the years, because it is a prison movie and they don’t tame around any of the edges of being in prison. It’s a really difficult movie to watch in some scenes, but it is a comfort movie for so many people, including myself. I have a Letterboxd list of my comfort movies, it’s on there. Last year when I got one of my vaccine shots, I needed a movie to make me feel better because I was feeling kind of down. I put on [The Shawshank Redemption] to make me feel good. And I’m curious, Emilio, what do you think it is that even with some of those hard edges of [The Shawshank Redemption], the fact that there is really difficult prison subject matter in there, it is still a movie that people go to for comfort.\n\nEMILIO I have a bit of a personal connection to it. My brother had read the script before it went into production and he said, “I think I’ve just read the best script I’ve ever read in my life.”\n\nMITCHELL Wow.\n\nGEMMA Wow.\n\nEMILIO At the time. So it was very difficult for me to watch it and not remember that conversation that I had with him. It’s just so human and these are the movies that I connect to. Again, I appreciate Marvel movies, I appreciate movies that take place in outer space, but I live in this world. We all do. We live on this planet. And we’re still trying, and we still haven’t, figured out life on earth yet. And we may never, but I think that for me as a filmmaker, [The Shawshank Redemption] addresses that it is about the human condition and it addresses the need for human contact and community.\n\nAnd we find these guys, like The Way, these people find community on pilgrimage on the Camino along a 500 mile path, these men find this community in prison, which is under the most horrible circumstances, but they still find community. And so I just tuck into the humanity that the movie really embraces. And that for me is one of the reasons why it’s in my top. I don’t care if every 16 year old chose the same damn movies. I don’t care. Maybe that’s exactly who I am. Maybe I’m 16 in my heart. So there 16 year old.\n\nGEMMA You’re a film bro through and through. I mean, it’s the classic story of hope, but it’s also a story about how art... As a filmmaker, I think you must appreciate how art and books can free the mind as evidenced through the library storyline and the fact that they all sit down and watch Gilda halfway through the film. But also that a film reel comes in handy for fighting off the rapey sisters in a prison.\n\nEMILIO Yes.\n\nGEMMA Quite good. Film is powerful. Film can literally save a life\n\nEMILIO No, indeed. Indeed. And I’m going to keep going back to The Way, but over the years, the letters that we get, whether it’s snail mail or DMs or emails or people reaching out to us on the Facebook page saying that your movie has changed my life. And again, to be able to have that on my resume, it makes all the Freejacks and the *Maximum Overdrive*s go away.\n\nGEMMA Kind of.\n\nMITCHELL We don’t need that to go away, Emilio.\n\nGEMMA Stakeout two, Stakeout two.\n\nEMILIO I’ve reached out to IMDb, by the way. And I said, “You know, I was never in that movie.” I tried [inaudible 00:34:58] Can I just delete that? I wasn’t in the movie. I wasn’t in it. I don’t care what you saw. I was not in that film. I swear.\n\nGEMMA We’ll talk to a few people. Hey, if you were in prison for 40 years, and heaven forbid, either of you, who would you have as a poster on your wall to cover up your sneaky spoiler breakout plan?\n\nEMILIO Probably Mr. T. I don’t know. It’s the first thing-\n\nMITCHELL Wow, for inspiration.\n\nGEMMA Love it.\n\nEMILIO Yeah. Mr. T. Mr. T. [inaudible 00:35:29]\n\nGEMMA Suffers no fools.\n\nEMILIO I pity the fool. I pity the fool who pulled the poster down. I pity the fool.\n\nGEMMA What about you, Mitchell?\n\nMITCHELL I mean, I think Emilio Estevez, right? It’s got to be.\n\nGEMMA With the porn ’stache in Stakeout. There it is.\n\nMITCHELL Why not? With the porn ’stache. I wanted to ask, talk about IMDB removing credits, looking through Letterboxd reviews, a lot of people are bewildered when they discovered that you’re in Mission: Impossible. And I was curious because it’s an uncredited appearance in Mission: Impossible. And I was curious kind of how that came about. Was it The Outsiders connection with Tom Cruise and what that was for you getting to work with him again so many years after working with him on The Outsiders?\n\nEMILIO So the way that it was framed by Tom on Mission was we are going to put all of these recognizable faces in the movie, in the opening, and then we’re going to kill them all. And they’ll all be uncredited, but the audience will recognize them from their previous work. But it will really create an element of peril for Ethan. And he’s the only survivor from when the team gets wiped out. So I said, “Sure, I’m on board. I want to be a part of this.” And then we got there and they asked me and they said, “Do you still want to be unaccredited?” And I sort of assumed that everyone else who’s going to do the same thing. So I was like, “Yes, of course. I want to be accredited.” And then the movie comes out, it’s got a 75 million opening weekend and people are asking the very same thing you guys are. It’s like, “Why are you uncredited?” I was like, “Well, because I thought everyone else was.”\n\nGEMMA You were not in the WhatsApp chat when they all agreed to get the credit.\n\nEMILIO I wasn’t. No. And that’s actually the truth of it. And it’s funny now in retrospect, I still got residuals, so that’s a good thing.\n\nGEMMA Okay, phew. Very quickly, I was just thinking about residuals and thinking about the business and a few things you’ve said along the way in this conversation. And there’s no specific anniversary for the film coming out in theaters now, it’s that you have managed to get it back. What was that journey?\n\nEMILIO That’s right.\n\nGEMMA Talk us through the CliffsNotes of the dark side of the business.\n\nEMILIO Well, the dark side of this whole endeavor, first of all, the fact that it got made is a miracle, that it got released as an even larger miracle. And then it has had this sort of slow burn for the last several years and then it kind of disappeared. And people would write to him and say, well, why can’t I find it on DVD and why is it not on... And lo and behold, it was part of a bundle of movies. There were a thousand pictures that ended up in part of a lawsuit and in bankruptcy, and then they ended up in this motion to abandon rights in a courtroom in Delaware. And a judge finally decided, we’re going to abandon these. There’s a motion to abandon. And The Way was on that list. So I got this call from a boutique distributor who said, Emilio, I may be able to help you rescue your film.\n\nAnd I thought, well, let’s take a shot at that. So this has been a couple of years getting the movie out of this movie jail and getting it back out into being able for people to access it and make it accessible again. And so I’d never expected it would be out in theaters again. All I thought was we’d print up some more DVDs, we would get it back out on streaming platforms. And then lo and behold, Fathom Events comes to us and says, “Hey, we realize the movie is, it’s not normally what we do. However, we also understand that the movie is not accessible. And so we believe that there is an audience there.” So great.\n\nSo now we’re back out on almost a thousand theaters nationwide, which is three times the scope of our initial release in 2012 or 2011. And so for us, this has just been this re-discovery. We incorporated Rick Steves, the travel icon you’re aware of. So Rick Steves is now part of this new re release, and it’s just been this amazing journey to be on to watch people not only discover the movie for the first time, but rediscover it and post Covid. Again, it’s that movie that feels more relevant now than it did when we first released it.\n\nGEMMA My mom walked the Camino pre Covid.\n\nEMILIO I’ll be darned.\n\nGEMMA She watched your film in the parador while she was on the Camino.\n\nEMILIO Oh my gosh. Wow.\n\nGEMMA So that happened.\n\nEMILIO Wow.\n\nGEMMA My mom would not be able to walk the Camino now, but what she did do yesterday was sit with me and watch your film again.\n\nEMILIO Wow.\n\nGEMMA I just got a bone to pick with you. I’m on SSRIs. I don’t cry in movies these days. I’m on the happy pills. But holy shit, two minutes in and Torin on Letterboxd writes, “Mum started crying Less than two minutes in.” That was me. I mean, Letterboxd review after Letterboxd review is talking about just how well you play those opening minutes. What does it look like on paper? How did you get there? How did you do that? And then how did you do that with your dad?\n\nEMILIO So the opening five minutes of the movie destroyed me. Even I’ve seen it, I don’t know how many hundreds of times, I’ve seen it not only in the cutting room and I’ve seen it standing in the wings after introducing the film or in the back during our numerous screenings when we were basically taking the film on a cross-country tour. But those first few minutes destroy me every single time. And it was sort of, those scenes in the beginning were written as scenes, but I had to get the audience to Santiago in an economical way. And so I had to transport them and explain the movie visually and where it begins, where it ends. So we had this wonderful artist, cartographer, actually draw by hand. He drew the map, we filmed it. The editor, Carol Littleton had done the Camino and had a full passport. We got her passport. I filmed that.\n\nWe then strung it all together with shots that I had taken our very first scout. So I had taken a little Panasonic, early days with a memory card. Again, I didn’t know what the hell I was doing. I rented a camera. I got a 64 memory bit card, plugged it in. And all of these locations we went to, I just set the camera down on this little six inch tripod and I filmed. I filmed here and I filmed there and I filmed up here and I put them all together, Carol Littleton’s passport, the shots that I had taken, the few scenes that were actual scenes. And it created this collage that takes us from Ventura, California all the way to St. Jean Pied de Port as seamlessly as I could, given our resources. But it’s so effective by the time he lands there and you understand the journey, you understand what he’s... You understand the grief.\n\nAnd it still kills me every time. It just absolutely destroys me. I’m really proud of that opening sequence. And so thank you for bringing that up. I still look at it now, and I think, “Where did that idea come from? How did that come together?” Because it’s elegantly done as well. And again, I’ve always looked at this, our crew, how we did this thing, as kind of scrappy. We didn’t see ourselves as painting this elegant painting on this enormous piece and enormous canvas. It was always like, we’re down in the mud, we’re scrapper. And so to open the film in an elegant way like that is still, for me, a surprise and very emotional.\n\nMITCHELL When I was watching some interviews with your dad too, about The Way he mentioned a few times that you are the only director he’s ever worked with who says like, “Action please. Cut, please. And maybe try another one, please.” I wanted to ask you if you could tell us a little bit about wanting to lead with kindness and politeness both on a set and in your day-to-day life.\n\nEMILIO I think it’s important to acknowledge the crew because it is a community effort. Sounds silly to say it takes a village-\n\nMITCHELL Not silly at all.\n\nEMILIO ...but it does take a village to make a movie and to acknowledge that there are guys that are carrying cables and boxes and making sure your shot is in focus. We shot this on super 16, so you can see there’s a lot of shots that are super grainy.\n\nGEMMA Yeah, it’s gorgeous.\n\nEMILIO Again, the thing about the movie is because of our budget, because of our limitations, we weren’t able to go back and shoot anything. When we left the location, we were done. We had to move on. Something was out of focus, if we missed a shot, there was no going back to get it. So my leading with kindness as a director is just the acknowledgement of there are guys that are doing much more difficult tasks on a picture than I am. I think it’s just important to acknowledge that.\n\nGEMMA Speaking of people doing much more difficult jobs than any of us right now, the French Crust needs to open and-\n\nMITCHELL They do.\n\nGEMMA And they’ve got work to do. So give us the plug for why Letterboxd members, if there’s anyone out there in the world who still has not yet seen No Country for Old Men or Pulp Fiction, why do they need to add them to their watch lists according to Emilio Estevez?\n\nEMILIO So I would say tuck into No Country for Old Men, because I think I’ve figured out the end of the movie and why. And I think if you can... Again, I don’t want to spoil it for anyone, but it’s... Talk about a journey. I dig the film. I love the way it’s shot. I think it’s for my money it’s the best picture that the Cohen Brothers have made just in terms of where it takes you emotionally and it’s just so outrageous and wonderfully violent in ways that you just don’t expect.\n\nAnd yeah, I think Josh is, again, he was a absolute revelation in that role. He’s a neighbor of mine and I see him frequently, and I just think that that he’s just extraordinary in that film. But yeah, I dig that.\n\nPulp Fiction because of how it landed and when it landed, talk about taking audience by surprise. And again, as somebody who grew up on film sets and you believe you can see the next thing coming, you can anticipate the next move that the director’s going to make, the next scene, this movie, Quentin, just basically said, whatever you thought was coming next, ain’t. Whatever you thought was going to be, it ain’t. We’re going to take you on this journey and you’re going to see a movie that quite frankly, it really has nothing to compare it to. And he did that quite brilliantly.\n\nSo he’s a guy I’d love to work with someday because I think he forces his actors out of their comfort zone. And I think when an actor is put in that position, they are better because they don’t get away with their bullshit. They don’t get away with what my mom calls “bits and faces.” She says, “Oh, your dad’s getting away with his bits and faces again.” It’s like, yeah, because it’s comfortable. But when you work with the director who says, “That’s bullshit. No, we’re not having that.” And Quentin is that guy who brings the best out of his actors and he takes his time to do that. And so I admire him for that.\n\nGEMMA Mother’s Day is coming up when this episode goes to air, and you mentioned your mother, and we’ve talked a lot about your father, we’ve talked about your brother. I just want to say that Mitchell and I both noticed in our research that your mom is the backbone of your family. She’s the key to all of this, right?\n\nEMILIO Shout out to Janet Templeton Sheen. She’s an amazing woman. I just wrote a piece for the Washington Post about immersive travel, and she has mentioned in it more than my father is frankly, because she understood immersive travel. She understood how important it was if we were going to move to the Philippines for Apocalypse Now or to Mexico for Catch-22 or to Rome for The Cassandra Crossing, that it was important that we dig into a community, that we learn about the culture, that we learn some of the language if possible, but that her idea of travel was immersive in a way that it was also inclusive.\n\nSo she was well ahead of the curve in terms of inclusivity and really making sure that we weren’t looked at as the ugly Americans who just sort of came into town, that we embraced a community and we embraced the city or a small village in a way that we would want to be embraced. And so I credit her with really getting us through some of the most difficult times, including in the Philippines. In many ways, she saved my dad’s life.\n\nMITCHELL Well, to wrap us up, to take us back to the Philippines, you’ve given us so much joy through your work over these many decades. If you could go back to 14, 15, 16 year old Emilio and tell him anything right now for a final question, what would you go back and say to that young Emilio Estevez?\n\nEMILIO Work harder.\n\nMITCHELL Wow.\n\nEMILIO Work harder.\n\nMITCHELL Keep working, man.\n\nEMILIO Work harder and don’t do Freejack.\n\nMITCHELL You and me are going to have a talk. You and me are going to get back together a little bit after we’ll have a breakdown.\n\nEMILIO We’re going to get back together over Freejack. Don’t do Freejack.\n\nGEMMA Just a table for two at the French Crust, please. Table for two, Mitchell and Emilio have got to have words.\n\nEMILIO We’ll see you with the French Crust.\n\nMITCHELL Our guest today was Emilio Estevez. The Way is his film about the Camino de Santiago and it will be in cinemas for one day only, May 16th from Fathom Events and on streaming services somewhere down the track. Thanks to our crew, Jack for the facts. Our editorial producer Brian Formo, our booker Sophie Shin, Sam for the art, Moniker for the theme music, and the wonderful as always, our best friend, our good pal Slim for tightening up all the pauses and our many, many, many ramblings. And none of Emilio’s. He never rambled.\n\nGEMMA He never rambled, not once. Speaking of Slim and rambling, we have another podcast Weekend Watch List featuring Slim Mitchell and Mia Vicino, who explore the latest releases in theaters and on streaming and shuffle their watch lists for randomized movie fun I think you call it. You call it fun.\n\nMITCHELL I think it’s fun. We have a little bit of fun.\n\nGEMMA Somewhere.\n\nMITCHELL We’ll get you on there. We’ll get you on there.\n\nGEMMA Yeah, promises, promises. Please, please consider leaving us a review on Apple Podcasts about why I should be on Weekend Watch List as it helps us keep our shows going. You can always drop us a line at . We love mail. We’d love to know what you think of our chat with Emilio. The Letterboxd Show is a Tapedeck Production. Buen Camino.\n\n[Tapedeck bumper plays] This is a Tapedeck podcast."
