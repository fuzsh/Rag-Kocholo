        "text": "Actor / Filmmaker\n\nPlace Of Birth:\n\nNew York City, New York\n\nBest Known As:\n\nThe Martin Sheen son who was in Breakfast Club and Repo Man\n\nEmilio Estevez is an American actor known mostly for his \"Brat Pack\" movie roles in the 1980s -- and as the son of actor Martin Sheen and the older brother of actor Charlie Sheen. Estevez grew up in New York and southern California, while his dad was becoming a movie star in films such as Badlands (1973) and Apocalypse Now (1979). Emilio jumped into the business as a teenager, and began appearing in TV shows just out of high school. His early movie appearances included the film versions of S.E. Hinton's books Tex and The Outsiders (1982 and '83, respectively), and the modern cult classic Repo Man (1984). Throughout the 1980s Estevez was a bankable young star, from Brat Pack movies such as The Breakfast Club (1985), St. Elmo's Fire (1985) and Young Guns (1988), to solid mainstream comedies such as Stakeout (1987) and Men at Work (1989). Estevez then had box office success in the early 1990s, with The Mighty Ducks (1992) and its sequels, but he had already turned his attention to making movies from behind the camera. He has since directed numerous television shows and feature films, including the movies Bobby (2006) and The Way (2010, starring Martin Sheen). Beyond the cinema, Estevez is known as an avid wine grower and beginning vintner in southern California, producing under the name Casa Dumetz.\n\nExtra Credit:\n\nEmilio Estevez was married to Paula Abdul from 1992 to 1994.\n\n3 Good Links\n\n2011 New York Times profile of the Estevez winery\n\nFilmbug's profile and filmography\n\nOld fans die hard\n\nSee also:"
