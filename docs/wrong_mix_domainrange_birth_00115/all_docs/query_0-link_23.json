Saturday, January 19, 2019 at Fayette Baptist Church in Somerville with Dr. Steve Harper, Mr. Harper’s brother, officiating. Personal remarks were given by Pastor Drew Murphy and Marc Gross. Interment will follow in the Fayette County Memorial Park Cemetery on Highway 64. Arrangements were provided by Peebles Fayette County Funeral Homes & Cremation Center – West Chapel at Oakland.\n\nMichael was born July 30, 1961 in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of Shirley Whitfield Harper Jackson and the late John Wesley Harper.

He was an all-around athlete and while golfing on the Fair Oaks Golf Course in Oakland, he hit his first hole-in-one on hole number 3 one month after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.
