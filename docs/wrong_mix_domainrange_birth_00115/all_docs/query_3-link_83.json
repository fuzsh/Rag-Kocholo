        "text": "Bragg Creek - Bragg Creek resident and the former Prime Minister, Steven Harper, was recently given the highest provincial honour after being inducted into The Alberta Order of Excellence.\n\nThe Alberta Order of Excellence is the highest honour that the province can bestow on a citizen and takes precedence over any other provincial honour and award.\n\nThis year, Harper is one of eight new inductees as one of the Order’s members whose contributions have formed and continue to advance the province’s history and place in Canada, and throughout the world.\n\nHarper served as Canada’s 22nd prime minister from 2006 to 2015. He is also credited for taking the divided right and uniting them under the modern Conservative Party of Canada.\n\nIn his time, he won three consecutive national elections and led Canada through a decade of complex geopolitical, economic, and security challenges.\n\nThough his government, Harper abolished the long gun registry, reduced the GST from seven to five percent, lowered corporate and small-business tax rates, introduced the Tax-Free Savings Account, alongside making record investments in healthcare, education, and infrastructure, all while leaving the federal government with a balanced budget."
