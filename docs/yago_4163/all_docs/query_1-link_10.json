        "text": "Pathe in France has unveiled a brand new official trailer for the epic 7 hour complete restoration of cinema classic Napol√©on, better known as Abel Gance's Napol√©on. Everyone who studies cinema knows about this film - it's widely considered one of the greatest historical epics in all of cinema history. This most recent restoration brings together the \"Grande Version\" - the Napoleonic epic of Abel Gance in its new & definitive version. Here's the full intro: \"After 16 years of an unprecedented collective adventure in the history of La Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise, the public is finally invited to come and judge a film that no one has ever seen since 1927. An exemplary reconstruction led by Georges Mourier, and featuring a new score due to the talent of Simon Cloquet-Lafollye, recorded by musicians from the Radio France orchestras.\" Starring Albert Dieudonn√© as the French icon Napol√©on Bonaparte, this latest version was screened at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival and it will play in French cinemas this month. No US release is set as far as we know yet. The $3 million restoration took more than a decade to finish. Described as \"a mixture of detective work, digital wizardry, and extraordinary dedication,\" the new restoration utilizes Gance‚Äôs production notes & recovered footage, creating a new HD \"print that promises to maintain the 'soul & feel' of the celluloid original.\" Enjoy.\n\nHere's the new trailer (+ poster) for the 4K restoration of Abel Gance's original Napol√©on, from YouTube:\n\nOfficial synopsis via Cannes as a proper introduction: \"From his beginnings at the Ecole Militaire de Brienne (1783) to the start of the Italian Campaign (1796), Napoleon vu par Abel Gance is conceived as a picture book in which the historical figures of the time (Bonaparte, Danton, Robespierre, Marat, Jos√©phine de Beauharnais, Charlotte Corday, etc.) stand side by side with fictional characters (Tristan Fleury and his daughter Violine), as well as the numerous extras who symbolize the people and the army. Brienne, the Club des Cordeliers, Corsica, the siege of Toulon, the Convention, the Paris of the Revolution and the Terror, and Italy are all places that mark Napoleon‚Äôs ascent to the heights of glory and power.\" Reconstructed and restored by the Cin√©math√®que fran√ßaise, with the support of the CNC (French Ministry of Culture), under the direction of Georges Mourier, with the √âclair Classics/L‚ÄôImage Retrouv√©e laboratory. Musical setting by Simon Cloquet-Lafollye, performed by Benjamin Bernheim, tenor, the Orchestre National de France, the Orchestre Philharmonique and the Ch≈ìur de Radio France, conducted by Fabien Gabel. üá´üá∑ üìΩ"
