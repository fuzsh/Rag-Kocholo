This event means very much to me. I have carefully followed the elaboration of this review of my work. I didn't attend the birth of the child, but I enjoyed watching the child grow up; nearly day by day. In the beginning I was enchanted by the thought of being the central figure of this story. Little by little, I discovered a new aspect of the question. It can't really be called a story, because everything in it is true. It is an homage to fraternal affection. The Romans built beautiful monuments, temples and arches of triumph dedicated to the memory of an emperor. With Sesonske's book I have my arch of triumph. Jean Renoir December 1977\n\nPreface I first saw Jean Renoir in 1951. He had been invited to introduce Grand Illusion to a small audience at UCLA, where I was then a student. 1 had seen Grand Illusion once before, but no other Renoir film, and I knew nothing about Jean Renoir except that he was a son of the painter. He appeared: a rather heavy, florid man, informally dressed, with a decided French accent, who spoke with great charm and vivacity about the making of the film. At the conclusion of his remarks he said, \"I have not seen Grand Illusion for many years, and I have never seen it with subtitles. It will be interesting to see again.\" And he sat at the back of the lecture hall as the projection began. I was greatly impressed by the film, as I had been before. In the final scene the escaping prisoners, Marechal and Rosenthal, agree to separate if they encounter a German patrol, so they say farewell before attempting the last leg of their escape. They embrace and Jean Gabin, as Marechal, says, \"Au revoir, sale juif.\" The subtitle accompanying this passage read \"Goodbye, old pal.\" They walk away across the snow and as they recede into tiny black dots the film ends. But just then a great roar arose at the back of the lecture hall and as the lights went on a red-faced man charged down the aisle like an enraged bull, shouting, \"Wait a minute! You have not seen the picture!\" So we waited while Jean Renoir explained that though the word \"Jew\" never appeared in the English subtitles, it was in the dialogue as part of a major theme of the film. He had been charming before; now he was intense, angry at the stupidity of the subtitles, concerned that we should \"see\" the picture without the restrictions imposed by timorous Hollywood magnates on American films. I had been delighted by his first appearance; I think that I have loved him ever since this second unscheduled address. In 1968 I was a professor of philosophy at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and teaching, improbably, a seminar on the films of Jean Renoir. I had by then, of course, seen many more Renoir films, and in the preceding year I had spent hours talking to Jean Renoir about them. When I\n\nasked him to talk to my students he agreed immediately, so I drove to Beverly Hills late one morning, then came back to Santa Barbara with Jean and his wife, Dido. There might have been a simpler method of getting him to our campus, but this way I could spend several more hours with him. As I had expected, my students found him patient, amusing, illuminating, wholly unpretentious. He talked about the works he had done and the work he then hoped to do, displaying in his warmth and tolerance, his humanity and irony, qualities we had found in his films. Later that night I drove him back to Beverly Hills. The coastal fog and the foul Los Angeles air left a thick patina on my little car, and as we drove down Sunset Boulevard at midnight Jean said, \"Now Alex, before you go back to Santa Barbara you must clean your windshield. It's dangerous that way.\" I said yes, 1 would. But when I stopped at the door of his house he said, \"Wait. I'm going to clean your windshield.\" I protested: it had been a long day; I knew he was tired; I could very well do it myself. But he hurried across the drive, limping a little as he had for fifty years, returned with a wet rag and then, with more care and patience than the boy at the corner gas station, washed my windshield very thoroughly before saying goodnight and going in to bed. I tell these two stories in hope that they will explain why I have written this book. There are other, perhaps more logical, reasons, of course. Renoir's films are among the major achievements of this youngest art form. Still, until quite recently they were little known in this country and almost completely ignored by film historians writing in English, despite their originality in both form and content and their influence on the development of cinema. Jean Renoir worked at this art for over forty-five years. One constant in this long career was that in both style and theme his films were genuinely his, rather than performances executed in accord with the fashions of the moment. This individuality and originality has had its cost in the indifference or even hostility the public has displayed to many Renoir films on their first appearance and the consequent difficulty he had in having his projects financed. But it has also made his works more impervious to the passage of time and changes of fashion than most films and has led to such anomalies as the headline in the Paris Le Monde in 1968 on the occasion of a retrospective showing of Renoir films at the Venice Biennale: \"The youngest filmmaker in Venice: Jean Renoir.\" Or the headline in the Los Angeles Free Press the same year: \"37-year-old film premieres,\" hailing the discovery of Boudu Saved from Drowning by Paul Schräder and the Los Angeles hippie community. Hence it seemed to me that this body of work, one of the great artistic accomplishments of our century, deserved to be treated with the care and thoroughness we readily accord to painters or novelists. Still, if these films had been directed by some other, very different, man, I am not at\n\nχ\n\nPreface\n\nall sure that I would have undertaken the years of happy labor that have gone into this study. I have attempted to write clearly and accurately about the films, and to resist the temptation to try to say everything possible about any one of them. Hence I hope that anyone reading this and then seeing a Renoir film will find there much more than I have been able to suggest. I have only sketched out Renoir's place in the history of cinema, for though the overall shape of this history may be clear, the relevant details of the relationship between works and between workers remain obscure—at least to me. Memories are fallible; many films have been lost or remain unseen, and such observed similarities as that between Monte Blue's performance in The Marriage Circle (Lubitsch, 1924) and that of Georges Hugon in Renoir's Nana (1926) do not seem sufficient to warrant any claim of influence. I have not often offered overall evaluations of any film, though it should be obvious that I believe all of them interesting and several of them masterpieces. For most of these films I have tried to show how the cinematic forms that constitute Renoir's style in this period work to enhance, strengthen, sometimes even create the dramatic substance of the film or to convey a comment or point of view on the characters, their situation, or the world they inhabit. This often involves long and somewhat technical descriptions of particular scenes or shots; for I believe these discussions can be effective only if the reader is able to visualize the scene. I know of no other verbal way to show clearly the relation between form and content in cinema. The photographs accompanying my text are, almost without exception, frame enlargements taken directly from the films rather than the production stills that illustrate most books on cinema. Thus, their photographic quality may sometimes seem inferior; at times I have had rather worn prints to work with. But this is a small price to pay for the great advantage of having illustrations which present the actual images that Renoir arranged and shot. They are, of course, mere photographs and hence lack an essential element of cinema: movement. Still, I have sought to select and order them so they do more than merely illustrate particular scenes from a film. If I have succeeded, the photographs will convey something of the overall look of each film and the development and evolution of Renoir's style. For a few films I have also tried to provide some sense of the superb performances Renoir has drawn from some of his actors. The photographs are intended as an integral part of the text; I presume that the reader will examine them with at least as much care as he does the words I have written. For these frames are themselves representative of the work of Jean Renoir; my words, even if or when illuminating, are still external to this work. The early stages of my work on this book coincided, not accidentally, with the planning and presentation of the great Renoir retrospective early in\n\nPreface\n\nxi\n\n1969 at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art—the first nearly complete exhibition of the films of Jean Renoir anywhere in the world outside of Paris, and the seminal event in the subsequent new recognition of Renoir in this country. Since then similar programs have been presented in New York, London, and elsewhere. His reputation, almost nonexistent except to a few foreign-film devotees, has grown in the United States since 1965 to approach the esteem he has long enjoyed in France. The culmination of this belated recognition came with a Special Academy Award in 1975. In recent years half a dozen books on Jean Renoir have appeared in this country, some translated from French, some written in English. Most of these offer a survey of his whole career and do not include an extended analysis of any one film. They vary considerably in both insight and accuracy, but neither individually nor collectively do they constitute the sort of intense and detailed analysis that I offer here. I am not dismayed that my work can no longer pretend to introduce the films of Jean Renoir to Americans, as I once thought it might; it is now possible to see them for yourselves. Sixteen-millimeter-film distributors now list almost all of Renoir's French films in their catalogues. La Chienne, after forty-five years, has had a successful run in big-city theatres. Even Tire au flanc and Nuit du carrefour may not be far behind. Jean Renoir died on February 12, 1979. Though his last film was completed in 1969, these were not years of idleness. He wrote an autobiography and three short novels, and spent the weekend before he died impatiently waiting to begin work on a new book. He was buried in Burgundy, in Essoyes, the village from which his mother and Gabrielle had come so many years ago and where now, in the village cemetery, Pierre-August and Aline, Pierre, Claude, and Jean Renoir have all found their final rest.

Still, with the later My Life and My Films (1974), it remains the primary source of our knowledge of the early life of Jean Renoir. By 1894 the revolution in painting had been half-achieved. Manet was dead and highly respected; Van Gogh was dead and still unknown. Impressionist painting had gained recognition but the young intransigents who had become the impressionists were no longer a group. Renoir's period of poverty and obscurity had ended. He could afford an apartment and a studio in Paris, a house in Essoyes, the village in Burgundy from which Aline Charigot had come. He had not yet felt any twinge of the arthritis that would cripple him. Each day, as long as the light was good, he hummed happily in front of his canvas. Jean Renoir was born into a house full of movement, of warmth, of love —a house where the floors were never waxed because \"a child might slip and bark his knee.\" A house full of women: Mme. Renoir, Mme. Mathieu, various models who seemed to be part of the household and who might be found posing nude in the attic studio or peeling vegetables in the kitchen. And Gabrielle, \"my beloved Bibon, who for me was the criterion of everything that was good.\" 1 Gabrielle Renard: fifteen years old in the summer of 1894 when she came\n\nto Paris from Essoyes to live with her cousin Aline and help with the preparations for the new baby. She stayed to become Renoir's best-known model, but also companion, pack-horse, and font of worldly wisdom for Jean Renoir. \"The world in those days was divided for me into two parts. My mother was the tiresome part, the person who ordered me to eat up my dinner, to go to the lavatory, to have a bath in the sort of zinc tub which served for our morning ablutions. And Bibon was for fun, walks in the park, games in the sand-heap, above all piggy-back rides, something my mother absolutely refused to do, whereas Gabrielle was never happier than when bowed down under the weight of my small body.\" 2 Gabrielle and Jean roamed through the maquis, a sort of wasteland of brambles, rosebushes, and nondescript dwellings that bordered the rue Girardon. They ran up and down the rue Lepic, becoming such a familiar sight in the neighborhood that they began to appear in Le Rire in the drawings of Renoir's friend Faivre. Gabrielle gave young Jean his first glimpse of the cinema, at the Dufayel department store in 1897—a venture about which Jean writes, \"Scarcely had we taken our seats than the room was plunged in darkness. A terrifying machine shot out a fearsome beam of light piercing the obscurity, and a series of incomprehensible pictures appeared on the screen, accompanied by the sound of a piano at one end and at the other end a sort of hammering that came from the machine. I yelled in my usual fashion and had to be taken out. I never thought that the staccato rhythm of the Maltese cross was later to become for me the sweetest of music.\"3 His introduction to the theatre was less traumatic, coming first at the puppet show, the Tuileries Guignol, and a few years later extending to Sunday matinees at the melodramas of the Theatre Montmartre, with Gabrielle, of course—beginning a lifelong engagement with that false world which often reveals the true. In a long lifetime measured in friendships rather than events, no one ever held a firmer or warmer place in the heart of Jean Renoir than did Gabrielle. The two were parted at the time of World War I, when Gabrielle married the American painter Conrad Slade. Decades later, their lives rejoined in California, where Gabrielle spent her last years close to Jean, pouring forth those memories that played such a large role in Jean's writing of Renoir. In the last paragraph of My Life and My Films, written when he was nearly eighty, Jean says of Gabrielle, \"Certainly it was she who influenced me most of all. To her I owe Guignol and the Theatre Montmartre. She taught me to realize that the very unreality of those entertainments was a reason for examining real life. She taught me to see the face behind the mask, and the fraud behind the flourishes. She taught me to detest the cliche.\"4 Perhaps nothing more clearly reveals the depth of his attachment than the final\n\n2\n\nJEAN RENOIR\n\nwords of My Life and M y Films, which Jean once thought of using as the title of this autobiography: \"Wait for me, Gabrielle.\" In the Renoir household everyone served as a model. Eventually Jean would appear in over a hundred of his father's canvases, most of them painted before that summer day in 1901 when the long red curls that Jean hated, but his father called \"Real gold,\" were finally cut in preparation for Jean's being sent to the Sainte-Croix school after the birth of his younger brother Claude. Jean was baptized in Saint-Pierre-de-Montmartre,\n\na twelfth-century\n\nchurch now dwarfed by its neighbor Sacre-Coeur, then half-built. Over the years the family moved from rue Girardon to rue de La Rochefoucauld, rue Caulaincourt and, finally, in 1912, Boulevard Rochechouart—a series of addresses that form a rough circle around the home where Jean would live while he made many of his films, an apartment on the Avenue Frochot, a quiet tree-lined street protected from the noise and vulgarity of the modern Place Pigalle by the thickness of a billboard and a wall. But Montmartre was not the whole world for young Jean Renoir. Soon the accents of the peasants of the Midi and the wine-growers of Burgundy became as familiar to him as that of the art dealers of Paris. Each summer the family went to Essoyes, the village of his mother and Gabrielle. In the winter they travelled south to Grasse, Magagnosc, Le Cannet, Nice, finally settling in Cagnes, where they spent more and more time as Pierre-Auguste Renoir's health declined. In 1907 Renoir bought the little farm called Les Collettes in order to save the magnificent olive trees that the whole world would see, in 1959, in Le Dejeuner\n\nsur\n\nI'herbe.\n\nJean went to school, of course, but occasionally wandered away and came home, less tired from the walk than from the school he had fled, which made his father think he was probably most suited for manual work. At the school of Sainte-Marie de Monceau he had a second, more pleasant, encounter with cinema during Sunday afternoon projections in the parlor, from which he most remembers a comedian called Automaboul, the film being, perhaps, Melies' Automaboulisme\n\net autorite.\n\nLater Jean went to\n\nschool in Nice, then to the University of Aix, in Aix-en-Provence, studying philosophy and mathematics. Meanwhile his older brother, Pierre, had won a prize at the Conservatoire de Paris in 1907—the same year in which a Renoir canvas sold for 26,000 francs—and had begun his career as an actor. He appeared in his first film role in 1911, in La Digue, the first film directed by Abel Gance, but he had small regard for French cinema. As a child Jean Renoir had dreamed of being a Napoleonic grenadier; his great joy had been to play with the toy soldiers he called \"soltats t' l'Empire.\" In 1913, out of college, uncertain about a career, he acted out a mem-\n\nPrologue\n\n3\n\nJean Renoir, circa 1920.\n\nory of this childhood dream by enlisting in the cavalry, intending to become an officer. A year later the outbreak of World War I found him a sergeant in the First Cavalry Regiment at Vincennes, but by early 1915 he had quit the cavalry and gone to the front as a sublieutenant in the Sixth Battalion of the Alpine Infantry. Pierre had already been severely wounded early in the war; he would never fully recover the use of his right arm. \"In April 1915\" Jean wrote, \"a Bavarian sharpshooter did me the favor of putting a bullet through my leg.\"5 It did not seem a favor at the time; the wound became infected and only the intervention of his mother saved his leg and, probably, his life. That mission accomplished, Mme. Renoir returned to Cagnes, tired and ill, and died late in June. When he was able to walk on crutches, Jean was transferred to a Paris hospital. His father had come from Cagnes to live at the apartment on the boulevard Rochechouart, and here these two cripples came to know each other. Renoir painted; Jean watched. They talked about the war and about Renoir's life, and Jean began that discovery of his father he would describe so well forty years later in Renoir. Once recovered, Jean returned to the war, but now in an airplane, first as an observer, then as a pilot of a reconnaisance plane. Injured again in a\n\nJEAN RENOIR\n\nlanding accident, he spent the last months of the war stationed in Paris, now sharing the boulevard Rochechouart apartment with Pierre, who had returned to his acting career. In these periods of Paris during the war, Jean's passion for cinema grew. He was excited by The Mysteries of New York. A friend returned from leave with news of the \"revelation of Chariot\" and, as soon as possible, Jean hastened to his first glimpse of Charlie Chaplin. He became, he says, \"a fanatical cinema fan.\" But when the war ended he returned to Cagnes, to Les Collettes, to live with his father and Claude, who had begun to make ceramics. The gloom that had invaded Les Collettes with the death of Mme. Renoir had been dispelled by the arrival of a young, vivacious new model from Nice, with redgold hair: Andree Heuschling, called Dedee, who posed for many of Renoir's canvases from 1917 to 1919. Jean learned the craft of ceramics and did what he could to ease the last year of his father's life. A few weeks after Renoir died, Jean and Dedee were married. With Claude they stayed at Les Collettes working at ceramics. Alain Renoir was born in 1922. When Claude was called to military service, Jean decided to move nearer to Paris. He bought a villa in Marlotte, a village near the forest of Fontainebleau, where his father had painted with Monet, Bazille, Sisley, Pissarro, in the days when they were young intransigents. In Marlotte, Jean built a kiln and resumed his craft of ceramics. Cezanne's son, Paul, soon joined him in Marlotte, moving to the property that would later be the setting for La Fille de l'eau. Paris and the cinema were near. Perhaps silver images filled the mind of Jean Renoir, but his hands were still shaping clay.\n\nPrologue\n\n5\n\nFirst Films:\n\nCatherine and La Fille de l'eau\n\n1924\n\nEvery artist begins with a\n\npastiche. —Paul\n\nGaugin\n\nFor French film-makers, the end of World War I opened a period of ferment and renewal. France had been pre-eminent in world cinema before 1910, riding a wave of experiment and exploration launched by the Lumiere brothers and George Melies. But then, much of the inventive genius in the art seemed to locate anew in the United States, while French films faltered. After the war Louis Delluc issued an appeal for a truly French cinema devoted neither to recording stage drama nor to imitating the products of other nations. For many French intellectuals the early works of Abel Gance, Germaine Dulac, Marcel L'Herbier, and Jean Epstein seemed a superb response to this plea, recovering for France a place in the first rank of cinema production. But not for young Jean Renoir, who professed to love only American films and scorned the French works he saw. Hence, despite the fascination of film, Renoir continued to work at ceramics until 1924. This career, undertaken more by chance than choice or design, required a combination of craftsmanship and artistry that he loved, and he was not without talent in the art. Yet he abandoned it without regret, once the path to his true metier seemed open. Fifteen years later Jean Renoir wrote:\n\nThe period after the war was something of a golden age for film lovers. This was the great period of American films. The important theaters despised them, preferring pretentious stupidities clumsily played by out-of-date actors or, indeed, the altogether ridiculous Italian films. American films played in little halls, very cheap. They gave us two or three at a showing, and the program changed twice a week. There were several months when I went to the movies three times a day, which meant that by the time I went to bed I had absorbed seven or eight films, fifty by the end of a week and around two hundred in a month. The idea of working in cinema never occurred to me. It seemed impossible to me that anything worthwhile could be made in France. These American films that I loved so much, these admirable actors whose play enraptured me; weren't they despised and often even unknown to most of our critics? And I, who dreamed timidly of walking in their footsteps without hope of equaling them, how could I imagine having the least chance in this country of mine where everything is done by routine. As for going to America, I could never have had the self-assurance to consider that Utopian project. One day, at the Colisee, I saw Le Brasier ardent, directed and played by Mosjoukine and produced by the courageous Alexander Kamenka of Albatross Films. The audience howled and hooted, shocked by this spectacle so different from their usual pablum. I was ravished. At last, I had before my eyes a good film produced in France. Of course, it was made by some Russians, but at Montreuil, in a French environment, under our climate; the film was shown in a good movie-house—without success, but it was shown. I decided to abandon my metier of ceramics and try to make films.1 No doubt other factors entered this decision. Among Jean Renoir's circle of friends many had a passionate interest in cinema, and several, including Jean's older brother Pierre, had already worked in film. Still, seeing Le Brasier ardent today, one can easily understand how it precipitated Renoir's move from ceramist to cineaste. Mosjoukine's film is visually alive and exciting, constructed by cinematic means with little dependence on theater. The story may be incredible, the characters absurd, and the style inconsistent, but such apparent flaws may become a source of renewal in art and great delight for the viewer. And Le Brasier ardent moves with a lively pace from a disturbing dream to the plight of the detective hero falling in love with the wife whose fidelity he has been hired to investigate. The action unfolds in fantastic or expressionistic sets, interspersed with a few realistic exteriors, using very rapid montage at times and some of those filmic tricks that Renoir then loved. One can well imagine how its combination of burlesque and drama delighted him. Stirred by Le Brasier ardent to declare at last his own choice of profession and having the resources of a considerable inheritance, Renoir, with his\n\n8\n\nJEAN RENOIR\n\nlongtime friend Pierre Lestringuez, began to plan a film. Jean and Dedee imagined her as a new Gloria Swanson or Mae Murray. Jean and Lestringuez talked of stories and settings, and of Albert Dieudonne, an actor who had played his first film role in 1908 and who, they thought, was very familiar with the technical aspects of film-making. Renoir devised a story, perhaps vaguely inspired by that Diary of a Chambermaid which would become the source of a Renoir film in 1946, and engaged Dieudonne as director, entering the film world himself in the guise of producer and scenarist. But given his ambition and ebullience this was hardly enough; he became an actor as well, then began to meddle in the directing of the film. A rumor spread that Renoir had collaborated in directing Catherine, provoking Dieudonne to issue a public statement: \"I am the sole director of a screenplay which I composed following an outline imagined by M. Jean Renoir . . . with my collaboration. In addition M. Jean Renoir has financed the film and has been my student. I shall see by his future productions if I have reason to be satisfied.\" 2 Renoir did not publicly dispute this claim, but when I recently asked if he had directed any of Catherine he replied, \"Of course—but I had an agreement with Dieudonne that he would get credit as director.\" Still, their disagreement grew until the production ended in a lawsuit, whose details Renoir professed not to remember. When completed, Catherine made not a ripple in the ocean of films. Renoir recently wrote, \"It was a total failure . . . never shown in any cinema.\" 3 And Catherine Hessling, years after the production, remarked, \"Catherine, that ought to be hidden from sight. . . . But what an idea to make that, above all with that Dieudonne, who was not a very reliable sort.\"'1 In fact the film was shown, but not until 1927, when Dieudonne re-edited Catherine and released it as Une Vie sans joie. Distributed by Pierre Braunberger, it played in Paris and London. Every description of Catherine that I have seen is quite inaccurate. Renoir's wife, nee Andree Heuschling, did become Catherine Hessling and play the title role, but Albert Dieudonne does not play the male lead and Catherine is not pursued by a villain. Catherine's misfortunes stem mostly from the activities of a group of society women who closely resemble the sanctimonious matrons in Griffith's Intolerance. Dieudonne plays Maurice Laisne, who dies just after he falls in love with Catherine during the carnival in Nice, before the film is half over—a role no larger than that played by Jean Renoir, who provides comic relief as a monocled and hypocritical subprefect. There are several passages of rapid cutting, some rather ineptly handled avant-garde techniques, and a climactic chase after a runaway streetcar along the line that then ran between Grasse and Nice. The finished film is uneven and rather mediocre. However, given Renoir's professed timidity, we may suspect that just such a dubious project was the\n\nFirst Films\n\n9\n\npath he had to take, an experience necessary to encourage him to dare direct a film himself, without further hesitation. For on the whole the making of Catherine had been a pleasant adventure involving work within a group of friends. Undismayed by the outcome of their first cinematic fling, these friends soon planned a second one, this time without Dieudonne. This was to be La Fille de l'eau, devised and written by Renoir and Lestringuez, with Renoir becoming set designer, as well as director. Again Catherine Hessling played the title role, but now with Jean's dog as companion for the first half of the film. Their child, young Alain Renoir, has a sunlit moment before the camera, and Pierre Renoir makes a menacingly satanic appearance. Much of the film was shot in Marlotte, in the village cafe, Le Bon Coin, and on Cezanne's property, La Nicotiere, where Jean Renoir constructed a village around the existing buildings. Thus, though La Fille de l'eau has little resemblance to his later works, the manner of its making was already that which would characterize Renoir productions. Almost every Renoir film has been undertaken as a work shared among friends, created in a spirit of cameraderie and informality with the usual sharp distinctions of function and hierarchical lines often becoming very blurred in the process. But this informality, which allows everyone to contribute ideas as well as energy and to feel a part of the creative process, has never weakened Renoir's authority nor smudged the stamp of his personality on his films. There is no doubt that a Renoir film is a Renoir film, but this personal expression has never been achieved by insistence on a rigid hierarchy on the set. Rather, the relation between this director and the actors, writers, artists, and technicians whom he often called his accomplices was best identified by Renoir himself when he described his role as that of \"le meneur de jeu,\" a phrase which applies to the ringmaster of a circus, the leader of a game, and also the ringleader of an intrigue or conspiracy. Narrative and Characterization Jean Renoir frequently remarked that in order to make a film he had to have a story to tell, and for over fifty years he worked tirelessly and endlessly devising and adapting stories, writing and rewriting the scripts for the films he made and for others that were never realized. But he also said that once you have the story it isn't very important. I believe he meant by this that, essential as it is, the narrative element in a film serves primarily as a framework of continuity within which the more important tasks of the filmmaker can be accomplished. This attitude toward narrative developed in the course of Renoir's career, as did his idea of what these more important tasks are; yet it applies strikingly to the narrative of La Fille de l'eau. As in many films of the period, the story is melodramatic and hardly credible,\n\nJEAN RENOIR\n\nmaking no effort to present either background or motivation for the characters or even any adequately developed setting for its series of events. The story does not establish a coherent world within which the characters act; rather it merely introduces them, then there follows a series of dramatic or comic interactions loosely connected by transitional scenes that often leave both spatial and temporal continuity quite obscure. But this matters little; for all real interest lies in the individual sequences and the glimpses of innocence and terror, delirium and dream, offered there. The story merely provides some plausibility to the order of these sequences, and finally, in its happy ending, a sort of closure to the emotional ups and downs that have ensued. The heroine, Virginia (Catherine Hessling), a lonely and very innocent young girl, lives with her father and her uncle Jeff (Pierre Lestringuez) on a barge slowly towed through the canals of France. Her father accidentally drowns and Jeff, introduced as a brute, quickly loses the barge through his debauchery. Virginia is saved from Jeff's evil advances only by the intervention of a passing stranger. She flees with her dog and is befriended by a young poacher, Ferret (Maurice Touze), who lives with his gypsy mother in a caravan near the village where the very respectable Raynal family have their happy home. Virginia becomes a servant to Gypsy Kate and is introduced by Ferret to a life of minor crime. This idyll persists until a growing enmity between Ferret and a fatuous farmer, Justin Crepoix (Pierre Champagne), culminates in Ferret's setting fire to Justin's haystack. Ferret flees with Gypsy Kate and Virginia's dog, not waiting for Virginia to return from fetching water. Drunk and angry, Justin and his friends burn up the caravan and threaten Virginia as they force her to watch the flames. She finally runs blindly through the night, falls over the edge of a quarry, and becomes delirious. The next morning Georges Raynal (Harold Livingston), who once earlier had saved Virginia and Ferret from Justin's wrath, attempts to help her, but she is too wild and terrified to allow anyone near. That night Virginia dreams of being menaced by Jeff and Justin and rescued by Georges, who carries her off on a white horse across the tree tops. While she dreams, Georges finds her asleep and carries her to the nearby miller's house, where kindness and care open a new life for her. But the brutish Jeff reappears and frightens her into giving him money entrusted to her to pay Georges's saddler. Georges discovers that the bill has not been paid and rides sadly away. Virginia, stricken, resolves that she must tell Georges everything. She meets Jeff again instead; but Georges overhears them and a fight ends with Jeff knocked into the canal. Georges and Virginia embrace and set out into the sunset on a visit to Algeria. When shown in England, La Fille de l'eau was given the title Whirlpool of Fate. While hardly an accurate rendering of the French, this seems a more appropriate title. The childish heroine moves through the film passive and\n\nFirst Films\n\n11\n\nuncomprehending, almost never taking any part in the initiation or determination of events. She is whirled through life by accident, chance, the whim or decision of others—by fate. And though she begins as a mariner's daughter, nothing in the film establishes any real connection between Virginia and the water of the French title. For those who know how water appears as element and symbol and vehicle of beauty in later Renoir films, it seems sublimely appropriate that his first film should have been entitled La Fille de l'eau and that the first images in this film should be of water sparkling in long perspective, reflecting tree-lined banks. But, though visible in many shots in La Fille de l'eau, water, in fact, has little significance in the film. Not until eight years later in Boudu sauve des eaux did Jean Renoir find his true child of the water. All this is not to say that La Fille de l'eau was a failure. In 1924 depth and subtlety of characterization or meaning were seldom sought or achieved in film. And Jean Renoir had then no concern for these qualities in his work. In fact, silent film was not very receptive to efforts at genuine characterization, and many successful films made no such attempt. Characters were one-dimensional, pure good or evil, sheer innocence or deceit: stereotypes of some familiar social class, idealizations or caricatures of some single human trait. The characters of La Fille de l'eau fit this tradition: Georges is merely good and kind; Jeff a sheer brute. Minor characters function simply to fill a conventional melodramatic role. That Renoir explicitly disavowed any realization beyond this can be seen in his treatment of Jeff, the villain of the film. Jeff abuses Virginia for no reason at all; he wholly destroys the security of her life on the barge and threatens her new life in the village almost as soon as she has accepted it. Yet no genuinely villainous characteristics are conveyed by Pierre Lestringuez, and any possibility for such is denied by Renoir's juxtaposition of a ludicrous scene of Jeff in the village bar with the somber, dramatically lit night scene of the search for the body of Virginia's father. Though such inconsistency undermines effective characterization, it does not hamper Pierre Lestringuez' success in the conventional melodramatic role of villain. Readily identified by the mere sequence of events in the narrative, this role requires for its realization only that Jeff appear truly menacing in his few scenes of conflict with Virginia. As in all melodrama, the mark of achievement is intensity of expression at given moments, rather than integrated overall characterization. In the one role where something more might have been expected, that of Virginia, la fille de l'eau, Catherine Hessling's portrayal endows the heroine only with youthful vitality and charm and a naive innocence that persists through all the traumas of her life. In 1938 George Franju wrote, \"Catherine Hessling, with her beautiful blind eyes, her birdlike walk, resembles one of these strange little gypsies of whom one does not know whether to say she is a fairy or a streetwalker.\"5 In La Fille de l'eau, with her physical maturity\n\nJEAN RENOIR\n\nmasked by costumes and childish gestures, the childlike side of this actress dominates the performance at the expense of both character and credibility. Virginia accepts the abrupt transition from barge to gypsy caravan, with its life of petty thievery, and then to helper in an honest bourgeois home with equal willingness and lack of comprehension. Her response to Georges's love seems to differ little from her earlier acceptance of Ferret's companionship. Within the story, Virginia does acquire some maturity. She accepts responsibility for her action and realizes that she must openly acknowledge Jeff's existence and her relationship to him. But Hessling's performance does nothing to make visible this growth; it is not her acting, but editing and the use of titles that indicate the change. Given Hessling's portrayal of the girl, only the accident of Georges's overhearing Jeff and Virginia seems to keep Virginia from fleeing again. Catherine Hessling's success in the role lies neither in any attempted characterization nor in any sustained portrayal of action, but rather in the striking images that successively convey Virginia's immediate subjective response to the blows that fall. The characters of La Fille de l'eau are not lifeless puppets or mere types; they do have individuality. But Renoir achieves this by adding quirks to readily identifiable types, rather than by any real presentation of character. Thus, the Raynals are given identity by the attachment of the person to an object: M. Raynal's car, Georges's horse. Justin's individuation lies in his readiness to anger and bluster. But for his main character, Virginia, Renoir does not add quirks, rather he shapes the whole film to give expression to her reaction to the whirlpool of fate. Treatment: Style and Form With the later recognition of Jean Renoir, critics began to view his early films with an eye largely for intimations of the future Renoir. Thus, writers ascribe to La Fille de l'eau an \"impressionistic vision of nature\" or \"rustic realism\"; they note a concern with food and drink or the relation of classes, while dismissing those scenes that Renoir must have considered his best in 1924 as \"demodee\" (old-fashioned) or not nearly as moving as the farms, the bistro on the corner, the old walls and paths. There are, of course, similarities between La Fille de l'eau and later Renoir films, but on the whole this first film little resembles Renoir's mature work. The strongest evocation of a later Renoir occurs in the opening sequence of seven unhurried shots that introduce Virginia in her life on the barge. The very first image, sunlit water reflecting tree-lined banks in the long perspective of the canal, remains a surprisingly fresh and vivid glimpse of nature. And the mastery Renoir later developed in creating visual rhythms by combining camera movement with the movement of objects within the action-space of the film seems already present, as he achieves the felt rhythm of this sequence by movement rather\n\nFirst Films\n\nthan cutting. The essentially dynamic composition of several of these first shots adds force to the flow of movement; the receding perspectives of canal bank and barge activating diagonal lines of force in deep space which overpower the horizontals and verticals that otherwise dominate the frame. A half-dozen later Renoir films are suggested here, as well as Vigo's L'Atalante, which must surely have been influenced by these shots. But this early promise ends abruptly with the title introducing an almost totally static second sequence, and it is never really renewed in the film despite an occasional shot affirming the reality of nature or the beauty of things. One suspects that the rhythm and dynamism of the first sequence was more a function of the setting of barge and canal than a deliberate choice. But, if one watches La Fille de 1'eau as film rather than foreshadowing, its most interesting parts remain those that most interested French audiences in 1925, the night scenes of the burning haystack and caravan, and Virginia's delirium and dream. What one notes most, perhaps, is unevenness. For La Fille de l'eau is indeed a pastiche, a collection of unassimilated elements borrowed from the films Renoir had admired in the Paris movie halls. Here and there one sees reflections of Griffith and Chaplin, Lillian Gish and Mae Murray. But the dominant influence is that of the Russian emig^s who had made Le Brasier ardent. From them Renoir borrows, not so much specific images, gestures, or characters, as the style of editing that dictates much of the form of La Fille de l'eau and also a willingness to mix both genres and visual styles without apparent concern for the consistency of the resulting film. This taste for mixing styles and genres persisted throughout Renoir's career. As he mastered the techniques of film he began to concoct this mixture so skillfully that it became one of the major elements in what has been called Renoir's \"naturalism.\" He perceived life itself as just such a mixture, and he learned to contrive the mixture so well that in later films the flow from burlesque to moments of great dramatic intensity seems as natural as life itself. Rather than merely borrow from the Russians, Renoir found in Le Brasier ardent an expression of one of his own basic attitudes. But in La Fille de l'eau the joining of styles was awkwardly managed; the joints show, and the great differences in tone destroy the unity of the film, leaving an impression more of a collection of related fragments than of a cohesive whole. The Russian style of editing, on the contrary, was handled smoothly by Renoir, but proved only very temporary in his career. A rather rapid montage is the essence of this style, with almost every change in point of view accomplished by cutting rather than camera movement. Both rhythm and action are conveyed primarily through editing, rather than being contained within the shots. This mode of editing carves the action of the film into a large number of fragments of very short duration, with frequent changes of\n\nJEAN RENOIR\n\ncamera angle and distance and frequent repetition of the same setup within a sequence. The rapidity of cutting in La Fille de l'eau is indicated by the fact that in its hour and forty minutes the film contains about 775 shots and 75 titles. Not many shots last more than ten seconds; often those that do are interrupted by titles. In each major action sequence the cutting pace accelerates with the mounting action; this acceleration reaching its peak in the scene of Virginia's delirium, at whose climax Renoir puts seventeen shots on the screen in just a fraction over three seconds. This was the most rapid sequence of images Renoir was ever to compose; La Fille de l'eau as a whole is the most rapidly cut of all Renoir films. For though it worked well in this film and is familiar as the style of many silent film classics, Renoir found such editing not really suited to his temperament nor his developing sense of how a film should be made. He soon began moving toward the very different mode of editing characteristic of his films of the thirties. However, he does make good use of the Russian style in La Fille de l'eau. The film's most powerful moments, the scenes of the burning of the caravan and Virginia's delirium, depend heavily on rapid cutting for their effect. Other factors help, of course: dramatic lighting with stark contrasts of light and dark, and a recurrence of shots with very dynamic composition marked by strong diagonals. The impact of these dynamic shots gains by their contrast with the static composition that predominates through most of the film. The night setting also heightens the power of these scenes. Renoir had already discovered that by shooting his characters against a black background he could destroy the visual action-space that usually provides orientation for the film viewer. Here the threatening figures have no spatial location but simply loom out of darkness, intensifying our identification with Virginia's terror. But, essentially, pace and rhythm give impact to these scenes. The cutting is rapid throughout, quickening in the fire sequence from shots of 2 Vi-3 seconds (40-50 frames) to shots of IV2 seconds (22-26 frames), finally to 1 second shots (16-18 frames)—though not, of course, as regularly and mechanically as this sounds. With shots this short, very little action can be contained within a shot and still remain comprehensible and coherent. Hence, most of our sense of violent action in this sequence comes from the form of the film rather than from what is actually shown. Cutting rhythm is crucial. But this rapid rhythm of cutting has a counterpoint in a slower rhythm of images; for here, as in the preceding scene of the burning haystack, Renoir gives both clarity and rhythm to his film by grouping shots around central, repeated images. Two recurring images, of the burning caravan and of Virginia cowering before it, join with the brisk cutting to give a complex rhythm to this sequence. The delirium sequence is even faster in pace, beginning with shots seven frames in length and ending in the crescendo of seventeen three-frame shots. All in all, Renoir combines thirty-one shots in just over twelve seconds, in-\n\nFirst Films\n\neluding the two thirty-six-frame shots of Virginia that punctuate the giddy flow of her delirious hallucinations. The remarkable thing about this scene is that it remains completely comprehensible throughout, with every image clear despite the pace. Unlike Eisenstein, who carefully coordinated the composition of successive shots to keep the viewer from being bewildered by his rapid montage, Renoir accomplishes this clarity by building the sequence completely of familiar images, repeating frames from shots used in the fire sequence, then repeating these again within the delirium scene. Having seen each image before, the viewer grasps it immediately; three frames (one-fifth of a second) suffice for comprehension. The result has great impact; a very dramatic scene of extremely fast pace, but totally without confusion. Interestingly, though we recognize each image as a repetition, we do not apprehend the sequence as a flashback. Perhaps the rapidity of cutting accounts for this; each image is merely an image, without motion or action. And perhaps these are necessary to give us a sense of reference to the past. Without them we perceive these images as Virginia's present hallucinations, not as memories or thoughts of the past. Despite the force of these scenes, that portion of La Fille de l'eau which most excited audiences in 1925 was Virginia's dream. Though the film was not a great commercial success, its dream sequence was shown separately by Jean Tedesco at the Vieux Colombier, hailed as avant-garde cinema, then reproduced and widely shown in France as an independent short film. Here Renoir does not rely on especially fast cutting, but rather on the photographic tricks that delighted him then. First, a double exposure in which the dream Virginia, clothed in flowing white gown, detaches herself from the real Virginia, still asleep in the rain. Thereafter, Renoir employs slow motion, accelerated motion, reverse motion, uses miniatures to confuse the scale, tips his camera on its side to give the impression of gravity-defying actions. Finally, he photographed his actors on a white horse running on a treadmill against a dead black background in order to achieve the effect of a ride through the treetops. Through all this Virginia moves with unshaken serenity: \"The protagonist is an evanescent female figure who appears and disappears across dream forests, who attends impassively to the most strange and incredible things (the passage of a monster across a metaphysical gallery, the resurrection of a hanged man while the cord around his neck changes to a serpent) . . . like a pretty and idiotic little animal.\"6 Jacques Brunius called this sequence one of the few true objectifications of a dream on the screen;7 it does have a dreamlike quality compounded of incongruity, the suspension of the ordinary laws of nature, the jumbling of familiar objects and strange backgrounds, the trancelike state of Virginia, and, above all, a slow flowing movement whose continuity and apparent inexorability set this sequence off from the rest of the film. Techniques dominate these scenes. Understandably, perhaps, for Jean\n\nJEAN RENOIR\n\nVirginia (Catherine Hessling) dreams of Jeff (Pierre Lestringuez), Justin (Pierre Champagne), and Georges (Harold Lewingston).\n\nRenoir began his new career with a consuming interest in the craftsman's side of film-making. Then, as now, he professed disdain for the \"artist\" who overflowed with emotion and imagination but had no concern for the manual skills required to construct a real object. The willingness with which Renoir became a student of the mechanics of film is reflected in these remarks, written in 1938: \"The sole benefit which I derived from my first naive works was rather good knowledge of the techniques of the camera, lighting, decor,\n\nFirst Films\n\n17\n\nand, above all, of trick pictures.\"8 Of these techniques, the most superficial and the most easily learned were the tricks that abound in La Fille de l'eau. But elsewhere in this film another basic Renoir attitude finds its first expression. While the characters of La Fille de l'eau are shallow and undeveloped, the surroundings in which they move—the barge, the village, the canal—have a convincing authenticity. And these surroundings contain the action rather than merely providing a setting for it. A full integration of character and environment was to become a mark of the mature Renoir films. This integration was not achieved in La Fille de l'eau, where neither characters nor environment are whole—but there was at least a hint of the direction to be taken, a direction that Renoir himself was soon to recognize explicitly.\n\nJEAN RENOIR\n\n2 Nana\n\n1926 From the time that I started working in cinema there have been two things I hoped to do: to make films free from the sentimentality that filled the movies I saw, and to destroy the cliches that pervade both films and life. Ί n ' ' lonn Kotirtir r\n\nThe completion of La Fille de l'eau must have assured Jean Renoir of the correctness of his choice of career and greatly strengthened his confidence as a film-maker. While this first film did not revolutionize French cinema, nor make any money, it was shown and seen and praised in reviews. Buoyed by this modest success and inspired by a chance viewing of von Stroheim's Foolish Wives, Renoir began planning a much more ambitious work. He always acknowledged the general influence of Chaplin, Griffith and Stiller on his early films, but the impact of von Stroheim was more direct and striking. In 1938 Renoir wrote: It was enormous luck which, in 1924, led me into a hall where a film of Eric von Stroheim's was being projected. The film, Foolish Wives, astounded me. I must have seen it at least ten times. Burning with admiration, I understood how I had gone astray until then. Ceasing my foolish accusation of the public's supposed lack of understanding, I glimpsed the possibility of making contact with the public by the projection of authentic subjects in the tradition of French realism. I started to look around me and, amazed, I discovered many things purely French quite capable of transposition to the screen. I be-\n\ngan to ascertain that the gesture of a laundress, of a woman combing her hair before a mirror, of a street-merchant in front of his cart, often had an incomparable plastic value. I made again a sort of study of French gesture across the paintings of my father and the artists of his generation. Then, strengthened by my new acquisitions, I made my first film worth the trouble of discussing, Nana, after Zola's novel. 1 Renoir has often remarked on his tendency to be influenced by others, to change course as a result of someone else's work or views. Like others, I had assumed that von Stroheim's influence had been to turn Renoir toward naturalism or realism. But Nana is less naturalistic, more stylized, than La Fille de l'eau. Foolish Wives is certainly not a naturalistic film, and while it follows the practice of \"realism\" in modern literature by stressing the sordid aspects of human affairs, von Stroheim indulges a taste for the bizarre and grotesque that goes well beyond what might sensibly be termed realistic. After seeing Foolish Wives recently, I asked Renoir what had so excited him in it, remarking that the film hardly seemed to me to be realistic. \"Of course not,\" he replied, then explained that he had discovered in Foolish Wives the possibility of creating within a film a world that might differ greatly from reality but still would be experienced as having a wholeness and coherence like that of the world we live in. This prospect, of creating a world with the feel of authenticity, in which characters might have the solidity of life, had set him to observing closely the details of the life around him; for he sensed that the basis for coherence of the world within a film must be veracity of detail. I suspect that another discovery Renoir made in his repeated viewings of Foolish Wives was the possibility of a visual style quite different from that he had sought to create in La Fille de l'eau—a different pattern of constructing and editing action, more continuous, less fragmented. It was not, of course, that Renoir had never seen such a style before, but rather, having now made a film, he saw films in a new light. As he himself remarked about his diminishing taste for American films, \"Then, having become a goldsmith myself, I began to discover flaws in the metal.\" Narrative and Treatment Emile Zola's novel of the rise and fall of a great courtesan, before whose rampant sexuality men became willing slaves, strips bare the upper levels of Parisian society during the Second Empire, revealing lust, deceit, cruelty, hypocrisy, and pretension as the reality underneath the surface glamour and decorum. Zola's heroine, Nana, destroys, corrupts, and humiliates the men who surround her, driven by forces she neither controls nor understands—forces vaguely related by Zola to the sordid squalor of the degraded generations from which she sprang.\n\nJEAN RENOIR\n\nJean Renoir while shooting Nana, 1926.\n\nAs a vehicle for the screen, the novel presents difficulties both in scope and detail. Dozens of characters swarm through its pages, many of them never clearly emerging from the clusters in which they always appear. Such details as Nana's narcissistic adoration of her own nude body, caressing and admiring herself before a mirror while Count Muffat looks on, were beyond the limits of even French cinema in 1926. But Renoir, in his first attempt at transposing a literary work into film, already displays the attitude that marks such efforts throughout his career: he seeks to make a film, not to film a novel. In an interview he explained, \"It was necessary either to reproduce the novel completely, with its innumerable characters, or to condense the subject, conserving only the principal persons while still not misrepresenting the character of the work. It is the latter path that I have taken.\" 2 Having made this choice, Renoir cuts freely through the novel, eliminating most of the first half and building his film around Nana's moments in the theater and her affairs with three men: Muffat, Vandeuvres, and Georges Hugon. The unending stream of men that flows through Nana's bedroom has disappeared, as have all of the ugly details of Nana's career as a whore and most of the bores whose empty chatter fills the Countess Muffat's Tuesdays. With these go most of Zola's social criticism, except by implication; taken by itself, the film presents the portrait of a destructive woman much more than of a degenerate society. The film moves swiftly from a rather comic introduction to a series of disasters: Nana (Catherine Hessling) triumphs as Venus on the stage of Bordenave's (Pierre Lestringuez) theatre, displaying more sex appeal than tal-\n\nNana\n\n21\n\nent. After the performance, the cynical Bordenave brings Count Muffat (Werner Krauss), chamberlain to the emperor, to Nana's dressing room. Nana, half-dressed, postures from behind a screen; Muffat, stiff and formal, \"embarrassed to be seen for the first time in his life in the dressing room of an actress,\" appears transfixed, but recovers sufficiently to perform his first service for Nana, bringing her a comb when her servant fails to respond to her request. With theatrical ambitions that far outrun her talent, Nana covets the leading role in Bordenave's new production. But the actors respond with laughter and catcalls to her announced desire for the part. This derision leads Nana to persuade Muffat to buy the role for her; but on opening night \"La Petite Duchesse\" is a flop. When Muffat brings Count Vandeuvres (Jean Angelo) and his young nephew Georges Hugon (Raymond G ^ r i n ) backstage, they find Nana in the midst of a tantrum. Georges immediately falls in love with Nana. Nana abandons the stage to exploit her true talent, sex. Muffat installs her in a luxurious townhouse, while Georges follows her about like a faithful dog as she squanders Muffat's fortune. Vandeuvres calls to rebuke Nana for corrupting Georges, but quickly becomes an aspiring lover himself. At the race track Vandeuvre plots to fix a race and make the fortune he knows it will take to persuade Nana to leave Muffat. But a mistake leads to exposure and ruin for Vandeuvres. Scorned by Nana, he warns Muffat of \"the golden fly that poisons everything it touches.\" But Muffat continues up the stairs. Nana, amused when Muffat enters her bedroom resplendent in his chamberlain's costume, then makes him bark like a dog, sit up, roll over, play dead, as her servants watch with ill-concealed disgust. Georges, who has himself been refused by Nana and has overheard her treatment of both Vandeuvres and Muffat, stabs himself with a pair of scissors and falls to the floor in Nana's wardrobe, disrupting her game of humiliating Muffat. Vandeuvres locks himself in with his horses, drinks poison, and sets fire to the stable. When Nana grows distraught over these events, her \"comrades from the theatre\" come to console her. They chatter gaily and persuade Nana to accompany them to the Bal Mabille. Muffat, faithful through every degradation, comes to comfort the grieving Nana but finds her insolent servants banqueting instead. They laugh at his reproaches, tell him Madame has gone to the dance hall. At the Bal Mabille, Nana sits glumly, then gulps drink after drink and joins the chorus to dance a wild can-can. Muffat finds her and admonishes her for living only for pleasure. She cries, \"Do you think this amuses me?\" and drives him away. Finally she has a convulsion and is carried off by her theatre friends. As Nana lies ill, Muffat sits dejectedly on a bench amid falling leaves outside of her house, watching as her servants abandon her, stealing all they\n\nJEAN RENOIR\n\ncan carry. A doctor comes from Nana's room and identifies her ailment as smallpox. The theatre group cringes in fright, but Muffat stolidly climbs the stairs once more, to have Nana die in his arms seeing visions of Georges and Vandeuvres. Characterization In his novel Zola describes Nana's performance in the third act of Blond Venus in these terms: Scarcely was Diana alone, when Venus appeared. A shiver of delight ran through the house. Nana was nude. With a cool audacity, sure of the sovereign power of her flesh, she stepped forth in her nakedness . . . There was no applause, and no longer any laughter. Men leaned forward with serious faces, features sharp, mouths pinched and parched. It seemed as if a wind had passed, a soft, soft wind, heavy with secret menace. Suddenly, in the saucy child the woman stood revealed, full of restless suggestion) bringing with her the delirium of sex, opening the gates of an unknown world of desire. Nana still smiled, but bitterly now; the smile of a devourer of men . . . A wave of lust had flowed from her as from some excited animal; its influence spreading, spreading until it possessed the whole audience. Then her slightest movement flickered the flame of desire; with her little finger she ruled over men's flesh . . . her sexual nature strong enough to destroy the whole throng of adorers and yet sustain no injury. 3 Sex incarnate, Zola's Nana is a goddess, or, as Muffat suspects, the devil. Incapable of fidelity, with an insatiable appetite for men and luxury, she uses sex as a weapon, a tool, a commodity. Still, the men she devours afford her neither fulfillment nor joy. By turns good-natured, cruel, vulgar, generous, grasping, impetuous, submissive, arrogant, Nana retains a sort of innocence in her inability to recognize or accept responsibility. At last, in the novel, she becomes an almost impersonal destructive force, laying waste to all of Paris. Renoir's film does not accord Nana the same scope of destructiveness. But the very first shot of Nana announces the great distance between this character and the pure and innocent heroine of La Fille de l'eau. The camera angles upward at Bordenave and Nana in the flies of the theatre, preparing for Nana's descent to the stage as Venus. As Bordenave adjusts the rope, Nana's gestures uncover her leg from toe to thigh. This flash of flesh sets the tone for Hessling's performance, but the erotic promise of this first shot remains unfulfilled. Nana cunningly uses her body to attract and control the men who may gratify her whims; the willingness with which they undergo almost any degradation at her hands testifies to the power of the sexual spell she weaves. Yet sexuality seems not at all the key to Hessling's performance; her postures, gestures, movements are feminine, but seldom truly erotic.\n\nNana\n\nThis Nana, created by Jean Renoir and Catherine Hessling, becomes neither goddess nor devil, never seems the sheer elemental force of nature that Zole's heroine does. Renoir's Nana may be heartless, coy, tearful, domineering, petulant, sulky or disdainful; but her predominant characteristic seems sheer willfulness, an almost compulsive determination to impose her will on others, to satisfy her slightest desire at no matter whose cost. Yet, even in her most cruel and destructive moments—or when most seductive, if one can judge by the reactions of the men in the film—a sort of childishness pervades the character. In Nana's actions one glimpses a little girl playing at being a woman, simultaneously confident of the power of her gesture and yet innocent of any harm, because it is only play. Unless we perceive this childishness as a central element in Nana's character, Catherine Hessling's acting in the role must appear ludicrous or totally inept. Every gesture seems exaggerated to the point of destroying credibility, the whole performance greatly overdone. And since no other actor in the film plays in the same excessive style, Hessling's performance cannot be dismissed as merely the sort of overacting demanded by the conventions of silent films. However, if one sees that Nana (not Catherine Hessling!) often acts like a little girl pretending to be a woman, this complicates the character but renders the performance understandable. If we accept this childishness as integral to the character of Nana, the coherence and seriousness of the film can be maintained, the excesses of the performance understood. A child playing at being an adult overdoes every gesture. Little boys pretending to be men adopt an exaggeratedly masculine stance, speak in an excessively gruff voice. But Nana is not a child, hence the very ambiguous sexuality of the role. Gestures that would be erotic change their character when overdone. In a child this becomes comic. But in the film a woman's body performs the gestures, not a child's; hence the duality of much of the performance, on the edge of both comedy and sexuality. Mae West often overacts in a similar way, yet her voice and her remarks maintain the sexuality of the character while rendering the gestures comic. She seems both genuinely comic and sexual, whereas in Catherine Hessling's performance comedy often seems out of place and sexuality rarely attained. But Nana is not a bedroom comedy, and Nana not a simply, honest whore. Rather, a consistent performance by Catherine Hessling gives rise to a shifting perception of the character portrayed. At first, the combination of childishness, comedy and sex gives Nana a certain charm. She is sprightly, coy, a young actress flustered at the unexpected appearance of a count in her dressing room, and putting on an act to cover her self-consciousness. But the childishness continues where comedy becomes inappropriate; when Nana persists in the same arch gestures while destroying the men who pursue her, she becomes repulsive. When Muffat grovels on the floor under her\n\nJEAN RENOIR\n\nfeet, we feel more repelled by the mindless cruelty of Nana's gay and playful commands than we are disturbed by the humiliation of this once-proud man. Ultimately, she becomes pathetic, destroying herself as senselessly as she did others. When, at the Bal Mabille, she cried to Muffat, \"Do you think this amuses me?\" the sincerity of this cry points up the falsity of her every other moment. For no gesture or action of Nana's seems genuine or spontaneous; all are posed, acted. Like the protagonist of Dostoyevsky's \"Notes from Underground,\" Nana seems constantly in need of the presence of another person whose reactions will affirm her own reality and power. Every move appears as a contrived production presented to this other, rather than as a natural expression. When none of her admirers is present, Nana's servants provide the audience she requires. She becomes pathetic when we discover that her actions are not contrived to deceive or impress another, but are a necessity welling up from her own insecurity—they are as genuine as she can be! For many viewers this outline of the character of Nana will seem much clearer than what they find in the film. The performance does get in the way. But my unwillingness to dismiss Hessling's acting as ludicrous stems from my confidence that this performance does embody Jean Renoir's conception of the role. When I remarked once that Hessling's performance seemed quite unlike any other in the film, Renoir responded, \"Well, you know at that time Catherine Hessling was my wife. Perhaps I was able to influence her a little more than the others.\" The character differs considerably from Zola's Nana, but the basic childishness of the characterization is suggested in the novel. I suspect that Renoir found this childishness in Catherine Hessling and built the role upon it. Thus conceived, this character falls short of full achievement in Renoir's Nana; one must work it out, rather than just find it on the screen. Nevertheless, Nana marks a significant moment in Renoir's career, for she is the first edition of a series of women who will live in Renoir films, the later ones more completely, more subtly, more deeply embodying characteristics Renoir sought to bring to life here. The willful destroyer, the little girl playing at womanhood, the performer whose life lies in the creation of a spectacle— from La Chietine to Elena et les hommes, a dozen characters have their beginning in Nana, though all of them are more complex and more human than she. The male characters in Nana are less puzzling and less interesting. Renoir had learned from von Stroheim that a consistent performance, sustained throughout, could give life to the people in a film, however unreal the characters might be. For Nana he appears to have formed a conception of each character and worked out a mode of acting, a transcription in gesture, movement, and facial expression, that would fit or embody the character. Each of these modes tends toward stylization. Understandably, for styliza-\n\nNana\n\nCount Muffat (Werner Krauss) meets Nana (Catherine Hessling) With Bordenave (Pierre Lestringuez), Zoe (Valeska Gert), and Frangois (Harbacher).\n\ntion assures the consistency of the performance, and, beyond that, the \"proper\" style should also assure correctness of characterization and the lack of sentimentality that Renoir sought. In Nana he achieves these goals; yet the result is an almost total disaccord of acting styles that hampers our acceptance of any real interaction between the characters. Catherine Hessling plays Nana with restless mobility; her movements do not flow but seem to oppose each other, tend to start and stop. She gestures broadly but jerkily, almost like a mechanical toy. Her expression, always intense, is also always ready to change. The rhythm of her performance is ragged and un-\n\nJEAN RENOIR\n\neven, surging and subsiding. In contrast, Werner Krauss as Count Muffat seems almost immobile; his style is heavy and slow, his movements ponderous, inexorable. Merely raising his eyes from the floor to meet the glance of another seems to require great effort. Krauss never smiles, seldom gestures except defensively; his most effective change of expression is to open his unblinking, agonized eyes a bit wider. The character conveyed by this style has both strength and weakness: Count Muffat is stolid, humorless, sure of his own being but also unsure of his actions and totally unable to resist any of Nana's whims. His most typi-\n\nNana\n\n27\n\ncal positions are to stand erect, solid, motionless, but with eyes averted downward; or to walk slowly forward, unblinking, as if to meet his apportioned doom. 4 Krauss's enormous gravity makes Hessling's effusive performance seem even more excessive and tends to diminish the impact of Nana's cruelty. From his first encounter with Nana, Krauss plays Muffat as a man destined by fate for degradation. His need for self-abasement seems so great that we can hardly blame Nana for gratifying it. In the novel Muffat seems hopelessly ensnared in his adoration of Nana, but also aware that the sinfulness of this liaison cries out for punishment. In the film the religious side of Muffat's character has disappeared, but the very consistency of Krauss's ponderous performance finally gives Muffat an unexpected power and stature. Unlike Emil Janning's Professor Rath in The Blue Angel, Muffat transcends his humiliation in the final scenes of Nana. Debased and rejected, scorned even by the servants, Muffat still waits patiently, climbs the great stairway again, at the same pace, with the same expression; becoming an image of faithfulness—steadfast, noble, selfless far beyond both the deserts of Nana's caprice and the reach of her sting. The role of Georges Hugon, played by Raymond Guerin, is stylized in the direction of hesitance and self-effacement, a style that emphasizes the weakness of the character. Georges always appears to be cringing toward the background or to be on the verge of an action he doesn't quite dare to perform. He always walks behind others, with drooping posture, never quite standing erect. His gestures are timid in advancing, quick in retreat—limp, as compared to the crisp gestures of Nana. Each of these three styles, as adopted by Hessling, Krauss, and Guerin, respectively, provides a core for the characterization, a set of basic traits that persist in the character through a variety of situations and actions. Thus, the stylization assures both continuity and identity for the character. Problems arise, however, when characters meet. Here the puzzle is: how could Nana, whom men adore, possibly be attracted at all by these two, both totally lacking in the vitality with which she crackles and without any overt virility to which her flamboyant femininity might respond? With the third of the men in Nana's life, Vandeuvres, the problem is reversed. Jean Angelo plays Vandeuvres in a nearly naturalistic manner, supple, graceful, with a slight overemphasis of gesture that functions only to affirm the gestures rather than becoming a pattern of stylization. Handsome, alert, poised, Vandeuvres views the world with an ironic eye which seems to cut through the illusions that envelop Muffat and Georges. He is easily the most attractive and masculine of the trio, and we can readily understand Nana's interest in him. But—how could this man disgrace himself for her? We can, I think, understand how the falsity and childishness of Nana could be fascinating to both Georges and Muffat, who in different ways are childish too. But Vandeuvres—worldly and clear-eyed . . . ?\n\nJEAN RENOIR\n\nIf we simply accept the lines of attraction as they occur in the film, the fall of Muffat and Georges seems inevitable; they cannot help being overwhelmed by Nana. But even granting Vandeuvres' love for Nana, his actions surprise us. Here again, one sees the advantages of stylization: without it Vandeuvres' character seems to fall apart. Thus, the characterizations in Nana cannot really be said to succeed, for their conjunction tends to demolish them. Nevertheless, the film is a considerable achievement. In one leap Renoir had gone from the simplicity of La Fille de l'eau to this vast international production, and at the same time he had undertaken that most difficult of tasks in silent film, to make a work whose substance was characterization and whose characters had some degree of depth and complexity. With the characters basically drawn from Zola, Renoir perceived that stylization was the path to endowing them with life and depth. But given the absence of speech and its individuating value, he may also have felt that stylization would diminish individuality in his persons, leaving, alas, only types, however alive they might be. This, perhaps, led to the adoption of a multiplicity of styles, based on the hope that in this way the people in the film might take on life while remaining distinct individuals. Unfortunately, the experiment does not quite succeed; the clashing styles tend to destroy each other. But in this failure lies the germ of later success. The mixture of divergent acting styles to achieve individuality works brilliantly in later Renoir films—think of von Stroheim, Fresnay, Gabin, Dalio, and Carette in Grand Illusion. There, of course, sound plays an essential role. But there, too, we find acting styles rather than the stylization of characters; the style being in the service of the person portrayed rather than providing his basic structure. After the commercial failure of Nana, Renoir never again attempted a serious silent film whose core was character-study. Only when his actors could talk did he return to this problem and make it central in his work. Style and Form Faced with the nineteenth-century urban setting of Zola's novel, Renoir and his designer, Claude Autant-Lara, conceived sets and costumes whose stylization contributes to the coherence of the film and helps create that world within the film that Renoir now sought. 5 And, of at least equal importance, Renoir began in Nana to develop the style of shooting his scenes that made these elements of decor a dramatic rather than merely an incidental aspect of the film. In La Fille de l'eau the dominant tone of the design had been simplicity. Shot mostly in natural exteriors, the film had used just a few, small interior settings, and the costumes indicated only differences of class and age, not individuality. However, though the space of the canal, village, and sur-\n\nNana\n\nFrom theatre to townhouse. Nana and Bordenave, Fauchery (Claude Autant-Lara), RoseMignon (Jacqueline Ford), Count Muff at, Count de Vandeuvres (Jean Angelo), Georges Hugon (Raymond Guerin-Catelain).\n\nrounding countryside is never clearly delineated, there is a sense of spatial openness and freedom in the film, with the action moving through fifteen or twenty different locations. In details of form, though Renoir's editing of La Fille de l'eau had been rather avant-garde, the pattern of camera setups was largely conventional. Most scenes begin with an establishing long shot, followed by full and medium shots, then close-ups, with the camera nearly always level and rarely moving. Overall, La Fille de l'eau consists predominantly of three-quarter and full shots, long shots occurring where the scope of the action requires them for clarity, with medium to big close-ups for\n\nJEAN RENOIR\n\ndramatic intensity and to pick out details of the action. Where two or three characters appear in the same shot, they tend to be in the same plane, the same distance from the camera. In Nana much of this begins to change. Rather than natural locations, Renoir worked almost entirely on immense sets with decor and costumes designed to become expressive elements in the film. Costumes reflect character as well as status: Muff at usually dresses in somber black; Vandeuvres wears a white suit when he is most hopeful of winning Nana; and the neutral gray of Georges's clothes help him fade invisibly into the background in Nana's\n\nNana\n\n31\n\nvast rooms. The two occasions when Muffet departs from his sober dress are significant. When he appears at the theatre wearing a checkerboard cape, the wildness of this attire matches the madness of the action he then undertakes in buying the role of La Petite Duchesse for Nana. And he glistens in his gold-embellished chamberlain's uniform when Nana forces him to play dead dog, the glitter of the gold reflecting the depth of his degradation. The major actions of Nana occur in only four locations: the race track and three large interiors—the theatre, then Nana's town house, and, more briefly, the Bal Mabille. These interiors, though very distinct, share the quality of being vast but confined spaces of indeterminate shape and dimensions, each visually quite complex, though in different ways. The spatial coherence that this similarity creates in the film sustains the feeling of melancholy grandeur left by the oppressive, cavernous spaces of Nana's town house in the latter two-thirds of the film. These huge, luxuriously decorated rooms, with monumental stairway, towering draped walls, and ornate mosaic floors, engulf and imprison the people in the film, as Nana engulfs the men who seek her love. However vast they may be, these spaces offer no breath of freedom; they are designed and photographed to appear closed, however remote the point of closure. In the interior sets one feels the influence of German expressionist cinema, as, of course, in the acting of Werner Krauss. Beyond these surface matters, Renoir's style had begun to change; rather, he had begun to form a style of his own. Over much of the film the cutting remains fairly rapid, though never matching the pace of La Fille de l'eau. Parts of Renoir's first film had been edited in a manner close to that Eisenstein would adopt, where the sharp contrast between successive images produces a shock at each cut; in Nana editing tends to follow the action quietly. With much less motion created by editing, and more action and motion within the shots, cutting more frequently coincides with movement and becomes invisible. Given some general slowing of pace—Nana runs about twenty-five minutes longer than La Fille de l'eau and contains about twentyfive fewer shots—the hand of the editor has become much less apparent. More significantly, early in Nana one finds the first Renoir shot sustained long enough to include the whole of an action, a scene with Fauchery and Countess Muffat, filmed in a single shot of over seven hundred frames (forty-five seconds). In the edited film this shot is interrupted by an insert after five hundred frames and even then seems rather static after the flow of images that preceded it. But, two sequences later, as Nana persuades Muffat to secure the role of La Petite Duchesse for her, Renoir films the central action of the scene in a single shot of over eight hundred frames. His camera remains motionless, but now Renoir creates enough movement in depth within the action-space of the film to keep the shot alive for its whole fifty seconds. Here, for the first time, two elements of what will become Renoir's\n\nJEAN RENOIR\n\nmature camera style have been combined: a shot of long duration with rhythmic motion in depth within the shot. Though there are even fewer shots in Nana than in La Fille de l'eau which use a moving camera, in these few a new rationale is apparent. Camera movement suddenly has a dramatic or formal significance, rather than being merely a way to follow the action. The first camera movement in Nana occurs about a quarter of the way through the film. After her failure in acting an honest woman, Nana storms angrily down a corridor of the theatre to her dressing room, the camera traveling along the corridor following her. Then Renoir repeats exactly the same camera movement, but slowly, in the very next shot, as Muffat, Georges, and Vandeuvres come from the theatre to see Nana. Though both shots could have been filmed with a fixed camera, Renoir instead discovered a formal means to make a dramatic point. Formally, the shots are alike except for the speed of the camera movement, but this difference underlines both Nana's fury and the funereal march of her hesitant swains. After this event Nana quits the theatre; the following scene finds her established in her luxurious town house. But instead of a conventional establishing shot of this new location, Renoir devised a very different opening for the scene. The shot begins with an iris close-up of an ornate cupid carved on the headboard of Nana's bed. As the iris opens, the camera tilts down to the bed, then slowly tracks back, revealing the immense bed as packages fall on it; continues back the length of the enormous room, disclosing Nana and Georges by the bed, laden with packages; finally, the camera takes in the whole rich and bizarre decor, with the actors dwarfed in the vast space of the hangar in which the set was built. This camera movement is reversed with great effect at the end of the film. Nana, with smallpox, clutches Muffat in fear of death, the two small figures lost at one end of the huge bed. The camera travels slowly forward to medium shot; in this room its movement seems as inexorable as the death that Nana awaits. Such shots indicate how fast Renoir was learning film techniques, as do the greatly increased variation of camera angles and a new freedom in relation to conventional scene construction. A growing dynamism of frame design or composition also appears. He now begins to divide the frame with horizontals or arrange his actors in depth and photograph them in compositions whose basic structure resembles that of his father's paintings. The tricks that flourished in La Fille de l'eau have completely disappeared in Nana. This, with the unobtrusive editing, led one French critic to write of Renoir's \"disdain for technique.\" Such remarks are far afield; Renoir was extremely interested in technique at this time and just beginning to acquire that mastery of technique which marks his later work. Despite his own words, Renoir has never disdained technique, but with Nana he had begun to feel that it should be subordinated to the needs of drama and expression\n\nNana\n\nin the film. He had taken his first steps toward his films of the thirties, where great technical originality and virtuosity become wholly unobtrusive in the finished film. Noel Burch, in his Theory of Film Practice, calls Nana \"a key film in the development of cinematic language\" because of its systematic use of offscreen space, claiming that it \"marks the first structural use of it.\" Nana does exploit the possibilities of off-screen space, perhaps even more than Burch's discussion suggests, but I have not stressed this formal aspect of the film because it was not an innovation in Nana, nor, I believe, an especially influential element in the film. I do not claim to know what film marks the first such use, but a very conscious and systematic structural use of offscreen space occurs in D. W. Griffith's The Lonedale Operator, made in 1911, where one can find examples to match almost all of those Burch cites from Nana. Though the first awareness of off-screen space in cinema probably dates from 1896, when the Lumiere cameraman Promio first set his camera in a moving gondola in Venice, I suspect that Griffith, much more than Renoir, should be credited with the discovery and exploration of offscreen space. After all, the existence of such space is a presupposition of the famous Griffith last-minute rescue. Uneven and awkward in spots, Nana was still a great advance for Renoir. Influences are apparent, but rather than copying others, Renoir now could assimilate what he found and incorporate it into a coherent, finished work which clearly displays the marks of his mind and hand. This is evident not only in the first appearance of forms and elements of style that he would later develop, but more obviously in the importance in Nana of several themes that Renoir would explore throughout his career: First, the question of class or caste, which appears in many Renoir films in the interaction between servants and masters. Here, the most frivolous and destructive of Nana's antics occur with the servants, Zoe and Francis, as silent witnesses. The worlds of servant and master remain separate, but the servants both despise and imitate their masters, as is clear in the climactic scene when Muffat interrupts the servant's banquet. Second, the question of how people meet, the context of their encounters and how, within the encounter, they create a relationship that may endure. Renoir handles Nana's meetings with Muffat, Georges, and Vandeuvres each in a different way. For the first he cuts between Nana, Muffat, Zoe, and Francis, with Nana and Muffat never appearing in the same frame until the end of the sequence, when Muffat brings Nana her comb. When Nana meets Georges, Renoir constructs a little hesitant ballet of movement in the corridor of the theatre. In her encounter with Vandeuvres, he indulges his taste for mixing genres, injecting a burlesque bit of business into a scene that began with Vandeuvres irate and Nana defensive and feigning tears. Taken in by Nana's fake tears, Vandeuvres puts his hand over hers to comfort her. She responds and very\n\nJEAN RENOIR\n\nquickly they are launched on the old comic routine of piling on hands. But instead of letting this destroy the scene, as it might, Renoir converts it into an instrument to both forward and express the changing relation between Nana and Vandeuvres. As their spontaneous gestures become the first movements in a comedy routine, Vandeuvres and Nana both recognize this and turn their gestures into a game they play together. By the time it is over, they are allies instead of antagonists. The scene ends with Nana kissing Vandeuvres passionately just as Muffat appears outside. A third enduring Renoir interest which finds its first expression in Nana is his love of the theatre and his desire to incorporate elements from the theatre into film. Not merely a desire to make films based on theatrical sources, though he had done that, and certainly not to film theatrical performances, Renoir's wish has been to contain, within a film, action of or from the theatre and do this in a wholly cinematic way while still not vitiating the air of spectacle that pervades the theatre. From Nana on, Renoir begins to include in his films not only characters living their lives, but also performers, characters who within their lives give performances that are deliberately devised, rehearsed and presented to an audience. He explores the relation between life and performance, the way in which one's life enters into the performance or the way in which the acts that shape or express one's life tend to become performances. Though it begins with Nana, this interest of Renoir's was not to be fully indulged until the 1950s, with The Golden Coach and French Can-Can. In Nana, Renoir uses the opening sequence in the theatre for two purposes beyond that of mere introduction: as a light-comedy overture to a film that will steadily darken, and to provide evidence that all of Nana's life is a performance. The device used here, of allowing us to see that a character's actions and movements do not change even though conditions radically alter, is one Renoir would use again. Near the end of Nana he stages another spectacle, the dance at the Bal Mabille, which now looks so much like a preview of the finale of French Can-Can, nearly thirty years later. In Nana, as in the later film, he effectively combines very long shots, with the dancers far off, seen through a smoky atmosphere across scores of spectators in the foreground, and close-in shots that capture first the rhythm and spirit of the dance and then the hysteria that has seized Nana at this moment. And here occurs the first enactment of a major Renoir theme: a character turns to art, a spectacle, a performance, as a refuge from, and sometimes even a solution to, life's problems. For Nana the performance that has been her life now has failed; at the Bal Mabille she attempts to lose herself, her personality, her life as an individual, within the spectacle, the dance— and perhaps she succeeds for a brief moment. She is the first of many Renoir characters for whom, at crucial moments, some sort of performance seems the only hopeful act—it is a recurrent note in his work. La Fille de l'eau and\n\nNana\n\nDegradation and death, separated by a spectacle, the dance at the Bal Mabille.\n\nthe little match girl have only dreams with which to confront their unbearable reality, but for Renoir art, spectacle, some sort of immersion in the play of a role becomes the central way. Camilla in The Golden Coach and Nini in French Can-Can are merely the most obvious cases; in retrospect, Batala in Le Crime de Μ. Lange may appear the greatest performer of them all. Nana played on the Paris boulevards for several weeks and had some suc-\n\n36\n\nJEAN RENOIR\n\ncess in Germany. But though some critics recognized its power and originality, this serious period film, devoid of both the sentimentality of French commercial cinema and the flashy techniques of the avant-garde, never really touched the public as Renoir had dreamed it would. With its great cost, the film was, as Renoir remarked, a commercial disaster, with Renoir himself suffering much of the loss. 6\n\nNana\n\n3 Charleston and Marquitta 1927 Then I was just learning how to make films. And when you don't know anything at all, you learn a lot very fast. —Jean Renoir Jean Renoir's rapid education during the production of Nana was supplemented by the film's commercial failure, which very quickly taught him about the cinema business and the hazards of being an independent. But by then he was wholly committed to his life in film and had no thought of changing careers again; having no other alternative, he turned to commercial films.1 For the rest of the silent film period his major works were financed by others and produced without the freedom he had hitherto enjoyed. But before surrendering to commerce, Jean Renoir had one more little fling: Charleston. In 1932 Renoir told a journalist, \"I have made only two films, Nana and La Chienne—the rest were for sport or commerce.\"2 Charleston was clearly for sport, an expression of Renoir's interest in American jazz—a film as freely improvised as the music it was to celebrate. Perhaps his intensive labor on Nana had created a need for a very different sort of experience, a reaffirmation that film-making could be joy as well as work. As if to cleanse his soul, Renoir made a film as far from Nana as possible—short, simple, and jubilant. Using three actors, a single set with one tiny unadorned interior, and each actor wearing a single costume totally inappropriate to the\n\nsetting, Renoir shot in three days a wholly fantastic little film full of the tricks that still intrigued him even though they had had no place in Nana. There have been several mysteries about Charleston. French sources list its original length as 1,200 meters, which would be over an hour in running time. But Renoir remembered it, uncertainly, as only one reel. The only extant prints are those at the Cinematheque Frangaise, which run about twenty minutes and have neither title nor credits. No one seems ever to have seen a longer version, and there appear to be no reviews from its reputed 1927 release. Henri Langlois speculated that the Cinematheque print was made up just of rushes from Renoir's shooting, while the film itself has disappeared. Everything written about Charleston seems to refer to the Cinematheque print, or one just like it. Seeing this print, one cannot imagine how it could have gone on for forty minutes more without becoming either intolerable or quite another film. Faced with these facts, I have tried to unearth the truth about Charleston. As nearly as Renoir could reconstruct it, it appears thus: Charleston was shot with film stock left over from the production of Nana. In addition to Catherine Hessling and Johnny Huggins, Andre Cerf appears in the role of Hessling's simian companion. The film was never completed; after three days the dancer, Johnny Huggins, was unable to continue. The one-reel film put together from the unfinished shooting may have been shown at the Vieux Colombier, but probably nowhere else. Clement Doucet was to have written music to accompany the film, but since the film was never completed, the music was never written. During the shooting, records of Charleston music were played to accompany the dance. The Cinematheque print, then, seems to be all there ever was of Charleston, it having been kept, undistributed, by Renoir until he gave it to the Cinematheque. I suspect that the information that the film was 1,200 feet in length was once erroneously printed as 1,200 meters. And in film criticism, as elsewhere, once a factual error is in print it tends to persist forever. Whatever the truth may be, all we know of Charleston is this twentyminute version. The story is simple: European civilization has been destroyed; Europe lies covered with ice. A black explorer (Johnny Huggins) comes from Africa to rediscover this terra incognita. Finding the ruins of Paris, he lands his spherical flying machine in the deserted city atop a Morris column. But inside the column dwells the last living human in Paris (Catherine Hessling), whose only companion has been an ape. When the explorer lowers a rope ladder and descends to the street, she peeks out from her column, emerges and attempts to be friendly.
