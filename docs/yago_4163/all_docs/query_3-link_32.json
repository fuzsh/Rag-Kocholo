        "text": "I was extremely lucky to see one of the most elusive great films — Abel Gance’s stunning “Napoleon” (1927) — for the first time Friday at a press screening held by the San Francisco Silent Film Festival at the magnificent at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, Calif. Anyone who manages to catch the four public performances there this weekend and next — the first in North America in 30 years — is in store for the experience of a lifetime.\n\nI’ve long regretted missing the four performances of a four-hour version of “Napoleon” presented by Francis Ford Coppola — with a score composed and conducted by his father Carmine — at Radio City Music Hall in 1981. Nor did I see it when it was briefly available on VHS and Laserdisc in the 1980s, hoping for another chance to see this silent on the big screen with live orchestral accompaniment.\n\nIt was worth the very long wait to see the amazing 5 1/2 hour version (with three intermissions, including a dinner break) restored by Kevin Brownlow that’s being presented in Oakland with a different, rousing score composed by and conducted by the great Carl Davis.\n\nThough it’s done on a much more epic scale, the film “Napoleon” reminded me most of was “Citizen Kane” — Gance uses techniques not much associated with silent film, like a hand-held camera, multiple superimpositions, split split screen, rapid-fire editing and flashbacks to rivet the audience’s attention and bring history to vivid life.\n\nThere’s not a dull spot in those 5 1/2 hours of bravura filmmaking — Brownlow, whose devoted his life to the restoration since the 1960s, is still trying to track down a bit of missing footage — which opens with the teenage Napoleon (Vladimir Roudenko, perhaps the most intense juvenile performer Ive ever seen) as an outcast schoolboy leading a snowball fight and ends with the adult General Napoleon (Albert Dieudonne, a commanding screen presence) rallying the French army in Italy (Gance had unrealized plans for five more films that would have covered Napoleon’s entire life).\n\n“Napoleon” evokes an astounding range of moods, juxtaposing the Reign of Terror with its subject’s first great military victory at the siege of Toulon as a young lieutenant. Gance deploys a vast, excellent cast as covers the intrigues of the French Revolution, then shifts moods as he portrays Napoleon’s courtship of Josephine (Gina Manes) in a comic style worthy of Lubitsch.\n\nI was so overwhelmed by “Napoleon” that I’m reluctant to write a full review until I’ve seen it again. Unfortunately, there are no plans to tour with this version of “Napoleon” or to even show it in New York because of complicated legal and financial issues. Probably no venue in New York other than Radio City has a proscenium large enough to accommodate the three-panel, 90-foot-long Polyvision screen deployed for the film’s famous climax, which presents one, two or three images projected simultaneously (a large orchestra pit is also needed).\n\nThere are apparently longstanding issues between Brownlow and Coppola, the American rights holder — who reportedly cut the 1981 presentations and speeded up their projection screens so the film wouldn’t run more than four hours, incurring overtime charges for the orchestra at Radio City. Some sort of temporary truce was struck to allow the Oakland presentations. There are reports that Coppola has plans for a new digital restoration, but that may be years away.\n\nBrownlow’s latest restoration of “Napoleon” — a photochemical one on 35mm film, using period-appropriate dye techniques that enhance the viewing experience — was last presented in London in 2004, and there are rumors it will be showing there again late in 2013.\n\nIn the meantime, there are tickets available for next weekend in Oakland, and it’s worth begging, borrowing and/or stealing to partake of — no hype here, honest — the film experience of a lifetime. You certainly couldn’t ask for a better venue than the Paramount, a 3000-seat gilded art deco masterpiece, the ideal setting for a masterpiece like “Napoleon.”"
