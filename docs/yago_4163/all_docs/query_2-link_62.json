        "text": "La Digue belongs to the group of islands around Praslin. The distance between the second largest and the fourth largest Seychelles island is only 7 kilometres, while La Digue is situated between Mahé is a good 40 kilometres away. There is no runway for airplanes, so that one is dependent on ships or helicopters. Those who arrive by ferry will land at the landing stage at La Passe at the west coast of the Island.\n\nThe approximately 3,000 inhabitants of La Digue are proud that life on their small island follows an even more leisurely rhythm than on the \"big\" islands. You are still mainly on foot or by bicycle. In the meantime, one meets more and more often cars (which need a special permit) and the ox carts are only a tourist attraction, but also as a visitor one clearly feels the calmness. Almost all settlements and accommodations are located in the western half of the almost ten square kilometres large island, while the east is \"wild\" and largely unspoilt.\n\nLa Digue is undoubtedly one of the most famous islands in the world, even if not everyone knows its name, because the granite cliffs at the Anse Source d'Argent (in the southwest of the island) offer a photo motif that is unique in the world and appears again and again in advertising, fashion magazines and even in major Hollywood productions. Depending on the product or film plot being advertised, the beach is often \"moved\" to the Pacific or the Caribbean, but in reality these huge granite blocks, which are rounded by wind and waves, can only be found on La Digue.\n\nIn order to get to the Anse Source d'Argent, one passes L'Union Estate, where one has to pay an entrance fee, but among other things, one can also visit an old copra mill. There are also some tortoises to see, a coconut palm plantation, a colonial presidential villa and an old cemetery where some of the first settlers are buried. This is also where the helicopter lands when you arrive or depart this way.\n\nBeautiful beaches can also be found at Anse Coco and at Grand' Anse and Petit' Anse. These beaches are located on the south-eastern side of the island and can be reached on foot by walking a little further around the island from the Anse Source d'Argent. At low tide, you can wade through the water to some extent, but you have to be careful that the tide might cut off this way back. It is possible to walk around the island. For such an approximately 10 km long tour, which does not exclusively lead over paved and well recognizable paths, one must estimate at least four hours.\n\nIn the interior of the island, one can climb the inselberg Nid d'Aigle (\"Eagle's Nest\"), if only to get a good overview of the island world from a height of approximately 333 metres above sea level. La Digue is also the home of the extremely rare Paradise Flycatcher, a small bird that \"owns\" its own nature reserve in the centre of the island, which bears its Creole name (vev = widow) and where two small, very rare species of marsh turtles can also be found."
