        "text": "Ethnicity, commonly understood to be a form of group identity based on shared cultural traits, emerged as a central problem for sociocultural anthropology in the 1960s. The publication of Clifford Geertz's \"The Integrative Revolution\" (Geertz 1963) and Fredrick Barth's Ethnic Groups and Boundaries (Barth 1969) sparked a foundational debate in anthropology between primordial and situational theories of ethnicity. Primordial theories emphasized the continued significance of premodern cultural traits to explain group attachment to their ethnic identity in contrast to situational theories that viewed ethnicity as relational and dynamic, a consequence of social interaction between groups. This debate continues to inform subsequent anthropological studies of ethnicity even as they carve out new theoretical terrain. The largely irresolvable debate persists because each resonates at different registers. The primordialists point to the explosion of ethnic sentiments and movements in the contemporary world as evidence to support their claim that ethnic identity is derived from affective ties that stem from the facts of birth or the givens of blood, race, language, and custom. The situationalists, on the other hand, point to the emergence of new ethnic groups demanding recognition and the incidence of individuals purposefully changing identities to suit their interests as evidence in support of their claim that ethnic identity is based on instrumental manipulation of culture, motivated by collective political and economic interests. While the two perspectives are not necessarily antithetical, they diverge significantly in their theorizing of culture in relation to society and the extent of individual agency in cultural continuity and change. There is also disagreement regarding the ontology of ethnicity, with primordialists leaning toward essentialist con-ceptualizations that naturalize ethnicity while situationalists foreground its provisional and contingent character. The voluminous anthropological literature that has since emerged on the subject emphasizes a range of contexts in which to locate and theorize ethnic identity. Significant contributions include theories that situate ethnicity in relation to modernity, nation-states, politics of recognition, neoliberal regimes, globalization and its attendant patterns of consumption, and class and global inequalities. Studies foregrounding contexts , in turn, point to the centrality of history-specifically colonial and postcolonial histories. Historically oriented postcolonial theorists argue that the racial and cultural classification of humans has been integral to the exercise of power by colonizers and postcolonial elites, by naturalizing difference in hierarchical terms. Widening the frame contextually and historically beyond the immediate ethnic unit thus called on anthropologists to clarify the relation between ethnicity and other forms of organizing human The International Encyclopedia of Anthropology.
