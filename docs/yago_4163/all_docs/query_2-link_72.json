        "text": "The Seychelles in the western Indian Ocean want to secure more Bollywood film shoots with the launch of a new direct flight route to Mumbai. Flights by Air Seychelles will leave Mumbai for the archipelago four times a week.\n\nStrong access links are a good way to boost production by making it easier for producers and talent to physically get to a filming location. In 2014, Abu Dhabi made a similar move by launching a direct flight route to Los Angeles, in a bid to attract more Hollywood producers.\n\nThe Seychelles are perfect for those looking for small romantic hotels and a relaxed atmosphere for their productions.\n\nThe sea and underwater worlds are a huge draw for filmmakers as well as the famous granite stones, exotic beaches and jetties. There are also ultra-modern private houses which are often available for shoots.\n\nOverall, filmmakers can enjoy a wonderfully safe and friendly shooting environment."
