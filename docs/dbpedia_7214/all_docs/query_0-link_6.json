        "text": "In 1998, Blade came out, and the film was one of the first legitimately good comic books movies in a very long time--even if parts of it feel like dated rave scenes. After that, we saw Spider-Man, X-Men, and so many more. It was the cusp of the golden age of superhero movies. However, in order to get there, a lot of stinkers had to be released.\n\nDuring the '90s, film studios were buying the rights to comic books left and right, and while these films were trying to find their footing, a lot of bad ones got released. Even if studios tried to utilize big name stars to push out a superhero flick, it didn't matter unless the story was good. Unfortunately, at this point in time, comic book movies hadn't found their footing just yet.\n\nSo going through the history of cinema, we present to you the 11 worst comic book movies of the 1990s. Sure, they may be a lot of fun to watch now, but none of these movies are really considered to be great by anyone. So sit back, relax, and check out some of the worst Hollywood had to offer before the MCU became a thing.\n\nCheck them all out below, in no particular order. Ok, that's a lie. It's alphabetical order.\n\nApparently, 1997 was a bad year for comic book movies, as you'll see on this list. The fourth movie in the Batman series, which was started by Tim Burton and ended by Joel Schumacher--was a bit of a mess, as it was the exact opposite of look and tone set by Burton at that point. Taking plays moreso from the 1966 Batman series rather than Burton's creation, the last movie features George Clooney as Batman, Chris O'Donnell as Robin, Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl, Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze, Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy, and Jeep Swenson as Bane. Batman and Robin is a really bad movie, but astonishingly, it's a lot of fun to watch currently. It's mindless, silly, and fun. I mean, we have a whole other gallery dedicated solely to Arnie's ice puns from the movie.\n\nThis is a little bit of a bonus because it was never released theatrically. The infamous Roger Corman Fantastic Four movie--which he executive produced--was in itself an interesting story as it was made in order to keep the film rights for the FF. The documentary Doomed!: The Untold Story of Roger Corman's The Fantastic Four covers this extensively. Corman's film used to be something you picked up from a bootlegger at your local comic convention, and it's bad. It's oh so bad. But it's kinda endearing to see what this group did with little money, knowing the film was never supposed to see the light of day.\n\nWhile the first two TMNT movies are iconic and woven into the cultural fabric of the early-90ss and early-90s, the third movie in the series misses the mark in a massive way. It doesn't feature a familiar villain for fans to latch onto and the general plot doesn't differ much from the first two movies. Sure, time travel is involved, but without raising the bar--story wise--this run of TMNT live-action movies fizzled and died here. Also, the turtle costumes have never looked worse. The one thing it has in its favor is the return of Corey Feldman as the voice of Donatello."
