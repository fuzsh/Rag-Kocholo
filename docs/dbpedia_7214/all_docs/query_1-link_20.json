        "text": "Don’t overlook the extras either, because the Tank Girl Collector’s Edition has plenty of them. On the disc, fans will find an interview with Doug Jones, a video essay by Alexandra Heller-Nicholas, an interview with director Rachel Talalay, an interview with lead Lori Petty, an interview with production designer Catherine Hardwicke, a making-of featurette, and a theatrical trailer. You can also watch the film with audio commentary from Talalay and Petty.\n\nTank Girl takes place in a post-apocalyptic version of Australia that is ravaged by drought. The film follows Tank Girl as she fights the corporation known as Water & Power. Others who joined the battle against Water & Power were Watts’ Jet Girl and human-kangaroo hybrids known as the Rippers.\n\nTank Girl has a pretty wild concept, but the film is a joy to watch. The fantastic soundtrack was put together by Courtney Love, and the production design and prosthetics for the Rippers really bring the world to life. The film has also been praised for its feminist themes since its release.\n\nDespite being undeniably cool and dripping with style, Tank Girl just wasn’t able to become a commercial success. The film only made around $6 million back of its $25 million budget, making it an undeniable financial flop. The reviews from critics were also pretty mixed at the time, and comic creators Martin and Hewlett have since said the film was a bit of a “sore point” for them.\n\nDirector Rachel Talalay has also mentioned that the studio interfered significantly with the story and screenplay, causing some of the negative reception from critics. Despite all this, fans have latched on to Tank Girl over the years, and its following is as strong as ever. In fact, there’s a reboot of the film with Margot Robbie producing, though there haven’t been many updates since production was delayed due to the pandemic.\n\nHopefully, we’ll see Margot Robbie get the Tank Girl reboot underway soon. If not, we’ll always have the original. If you want the Collector’s Edition for yourself, make sure to place a pre-order for its April 17 release.\n\nSource: Umbrella Home Entertainment"
