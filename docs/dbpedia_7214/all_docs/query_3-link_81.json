This list will only focus on the aesthetic of the film so if the films do not feature any grunge rock in it's soundtrack or have alternative clothing it will still be allowed on the list my focus is mostly on the look and feel of the movie, here is my list enjoy PS some of these can be quite mature so watch at your own risk.",
