        "text": "When your social media is dominated by all facets of fashion, every month or so you’ll hear about a supposed TikTok trend with a name that stops your scroll. Last year there was the frazzled Englishwoman, 2020 had cottagecore, and, reaching into the very distant past (2019), there were VSCO girls. These names are silly, by design; fun to talk about; and imply a visually cohesive world that goes beyond individual trendy items. You may run out of things to say about a camel-hair coat, but the old-money aesthetic provides endless commentary.\n\nIt’s easy to dismiss it all as noise because these trends often just repackage existing aesthetics and looks: It’s not minimalism, it’s stealth wealth. It’s not sporty, it’s blokette. The -cores, aesthetics, and microtrends of 2023 are most fun to remember as a group—the class of 2023, if you will. And together they show certain themes.\n\nClass anxiety, clearly, made its way into our wardrobes this year, with stealth wealth, quiet luxury, and old-money aesthetic all becoming recognizable buzzwords that actually affected sales numbers. Girlhood became a broader cultural trend, exemplified by girl math (internal calculations like “if I pay for something with cash, it’s free”) and girl dinner (a thrown-together snack plate in lieu of a proper meal). Fashion matched this youthful, femme-forward energy with vanilla girl, tomato-girl summer, bimbocore, and Barbiecore. Escapism is also inherent in the year’s trends. Two—Europecore and tomato-girl summer—tried to capture the spirit of a luxurious vacation. A headscarf to wear à la Grace Kelly is cheaper than a flight to Cannes, after all.\n\nMany of these follow a similar life cycle: A term pops off on TikTok, fashion commentators and journalists write about it, it becomes the buzzword of the moment, and then, invariably, mentioning the term in earnest becomes kind of cringe. And so, below, explore and (re)discover the online fashion trends that defined 2023.\n\nStealth Wealth, a.k.a. Quiet Luxury\n\nDefinition: Logo-less, quality, expensive clothing that’s imagined as a kind of camouflage for the rich. The prime example is Succession protagonist Kendall Roy’s $525 Loro Piana baseball cap—you wouldn’t know how expensive it is just by looking at the plain black hat, but it’s a status symbol regardless. The two terms are used interchangeably, but quiet luxury is more frequently searched. A stealth-wealth wardrobe is filled with neutral, business-casual clothing. Think slacks, cashmere sweaters, and demure necklines and hemlines. Despite the name, one of the appeals of quiet luxury is that it’s an achievable look at many different price points. Your black blazer could be $3,190 from The Row or $60 from Zara. If you know, you know—but most people don’t know. This trend really took off this spring with the trifecta of Gwyneth Paltrow’s ski trial, the final season of Succession, and Sofia Richie’s wedding to Elliot Grainge, which each put a different kind of luxury in the zeitgeist. However, people started to point out that this was not exactly how the ultrarich really dressed, or at least not all of them. Obvious classism aside, it’s also been accused of being boring.\n\nDefinition: A more obvious version of stealth wealth, the old-money aesthetic is a fantastical imagination of what rich people wear in private: white wool, custom Chanel and Ralph Lauren, silly little hats and vests. It’s as if you’re meeting Tom and Daisy Buchanan’s great-grandchildren. Old-money aesthetic is not complete without the requisite world-building: the yacht, the Dom Pérignon, the Lake Como backdrop. But the clothes themselves are, again, simple: white and beige separates, collars, loafers, blazers. It’s also a mindset of investing in your wardrobe, with quality pieces. Sofia Richie has single-handedly led the trend without ever mentioning it by name. Searches for the term peaked following her April nuptials. The bride wore three custom Chanel outfits throughout the wedding weekend, held at Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc in the South of France. It was obviously opulent, but everything was tasteful, which is why it’s more old money than stealth wealth.\n\nDefinition: All things pearlescent, beachy, shimmery. It’s not quite nautical—you won’t find Breton stripes or sailor pants here. This is more ethereal, geared toward a siren. Nobody did it better than Halle Bailey at the world premiere of The Little Mermaid, in which she played Ariel. Her shiny blue Valdrin Sahiti gown with a ruffled, seashell-like bust personified the trend. Dua Lipa, who made her film debut as Mermaid Barbie, also embodied the look on- and offscreen. At the LA Barbie premiere of the movie, Lipa wore a sparkly fishnet custom Bottega Veneta tank dress that captured the spirit of the trend. Because mermaidcore is not really relaxed: It’s glamorous, extra. Mermaidcore is about putting blue eyeshadow and pearls on your face, wearing your most fish-scale-like sequins.\n\nPeak: Halle Bailey’s The Little Mermaid press tour in May 2023\n\nPatron saint: Bailey, Versace spring 1992 and spring 2021, Dua Lipa as Mermaid Barbie\n\nHow real is it?: It’s surprisingly real. The celebrity examples are all from red carpets, but many brands designed into the trend, from Givenchy to Loewe to Versace. The look was further endorsed at New York Fashion Week, where it was a beauty trend.\n\nBalletcore\n\nDefinition: One of the more ridiculous names on this list, tomato-girl summer is about dressing like a woman who eats copious amounts of fresh tomatoes (and pasta, red wine, Aperol, and olives) without getting a single speck of red on her white linen ensemble, rather than someone who dresses like a tomato. It’s an irreverent, youthful rebranding of la dolce vita—a bit more fun, a bit more relaxed. It’s a headscarf, a fitted dress, a slip skirt, bold prints, and, yes, the color red.\n\nPeak: Late June and early July 2023, when everyone and their mother (except you) jetted off to Italy\n\nPatron saint: Hailey Bieber, this specific Lisa Says Gah dress, Sophia Loren\n\nHow real is it?: A summer fling in every regard, it did not last or make a considerable impact. But it was still fun.\n\nEuropecore\n\nDefinition: What Americans wanted to wear to fit in on their European vacations, real or imagined. Generally marked by feminine dresses, linen, bikinis, and full skirts, but anything vaguely European will do. Like tomato-girl summer, one did not have to actually be in Europe to participate in the trend: Instead, it’s a way to bring a carefree, yacht-lounging, pizza-eating attitude to your everyday life via your wardrobe.\n\nPeak: August 2023, when everyone was on or dreaming of far-flung vacations\n\nPatron saint: Grace Kelly on a yacht\n\nHow real is it?: With 3.3 million views under the hashtag on TikTok and a Target edit on the trend, it was a major aesthetic of the summer but not of the year. Peaked quickly and sharply on Google Trends and never recovered.\n\nSuccubus Chic\n\nDefinition: Ever wanted to ride your horse on the beach? Or at least look like you could ride a horse on the beach? Coastal cowgirl—a bohemian approach to westernwear—is the answer to that. It’s cowboy boots, a bikini, a flirty little dress, a straw hat, fringe. It’s also one of the aesthetics that lends itself to world-building: You can complete the look with coastal-cowgirl interiors or bachelorette parties. It’s related to coastal grandmother, which was a trend in summer 2022, but replaces linen pants with jean cutoffs, Birkenstocks with cowboy boots, and sweaters with bikini tops. Still, it has a carefree attitude that you only really find in people who spend considerable time in nature. Barn sold separately.\n\nPeak: April 2023\n\nPatron saint: Anyone in a bikini and cowboy boots\n\nHow real is it?: 213.5M views on TikTok, with derivations like coastal cowgirl fashion (9M views), coastalcowgirlcore (4M), and coastalcowgirl decor (773.9K views). It was a genuine TikTok trend that fit into the yearslong affinity for Americana.\n\nVanilla Girl\n\nDefinition: Coquette is the French word for flirtatious, and the coquette aesthetic lives up to the name. Think miniskirts, bows, pink puff sleeves, delicate white broderie anglaise tops. Yes, it sounds a lot like balletcore, cottagecore, angelcore, and the Japanese Lolita aesthetic that’s been around since the 1990s. There is no shortage of trends that repackage hyperfemininity. Though it is heavily inspired by Victorian and Rococo fashion, a true coquette look is entirely modern. The lace, bows, pearls, and corsets are tempered by short hemlines, sneakers, and Ultraviolence vinyls. However, in early December 2023, the aesthetic got its very own ironic TikTok trend. Scored to Lana del Rey, users put thin pink bows on ice cubes, macaroni and cheese, vapes—anything really—to make it as dainty and sweet as a coquette. Of course, the trend includes a Lana del Rey song playing in the background."
