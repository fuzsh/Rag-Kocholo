        "text": "This post is updated regularly as movies leave and enter Netflix. *New additions are indicated with an asterisk.\n\nWith hundreds of films from around the world on the streaming giant that changed the game, how does one even know what to watch when they fire up their Netflix? Start here! We’ve gone through the many films available on the platform and pared down the selection to 30 must-see titles, including acclaimed dramas, action films, comedies, horror flicks, and even stuff for the whole family, with Netflix Originals peppered in throughout, alongside its licensed films. No algorithm nonsense here: Our picks represent the personal favorites of seasoned movie critics, and they’re updated every week and month to include or remove films that join or depart from the streaming service. This list represents the best of Netflix’s movie offerings, and it starts with a new rotating critic’s pick of the week.\n\nThis Week’s Critic’s Pick\n\nBack to the Future\n\nYear: 1985\n\nRuntime: 1h 56m\n\nDirector: Robert Zemeckis\n\nRobert Zemeckis directed all three movies in one of the most beloved trilogies of all time. The story of a teen who goes back in time turned Michael J. Fox into a household name and still serves as the template for how to do this kind of family/sci-fi adventure. The two sequels may not be as good but they’re better than you remember. And all three are on Netflix.\n\nHow We Pick Our Films\n\nCritic Brian Tallerico watches and writes about movies and TV every day. To curate this list, he dives into Netflix’s catalogue to surface acclaimed, surprising, or otherwise noteworthy titles — using his taste and a lifetime of cinema study as his guide, instead of whatever the algorithm happens to be pushing. After triple-checking to make sure they’re still available, he watches each, organizes them by category, then writes his recommendation. We highlight more than just Oscar winners or popcorn flicks: These films present interesting ideas, made an impact on cinema, and changed our culture. Read on to find something to watch.\n\nDrama\n\nAftersun\n\nYear: 2022\n\nRuntime: 1h 41m\n\nDirector: Charlotte Wells\n\nWhat a beautiful movie this is, one of the best of the 2020s so far and it’s nowhere else for streaming subscribers. Paul Mescal earned an Oscar nomination for his work as the father of an 11-year-old girl, played by the wonderful Frankie Corio. Aftersun is actually a memory piece, a drama about that moment in life when you realize your parents are human too. It’s gorgeous.\n\nCarol\n\nYear: 2015\n\nRuntime: 1h 58m\n\nDirector: Todd Haynes\n\nCate Blanchett and Rooney Mara star in Todd Haynes’ poignant and heartbreaking drama about a love affair between two women at a time when that wasn’t allowed. It’s a beautifully made film with phenomenal performances from the entire cast, especially the two leads. You won’t forget it.\n\nDark Waters\n\nYear: 2019\n\nRuntime: 2h 7m\n\nDirector: Todd Haynes\n\nDark Waters will make you angry. Mark Ruffalo stars in this true story from director Todd Haynes, known for more formally ambitious stuff but able to nail the old-fashioned outrage needed for this one. Based on a New York Times article, the movie details an investigation into the DuPont corporation’s poisoning of a small town with chemicals in the drinking water. Ruffalo is great, and so are Anne Hathaway, Tim Robbins, and especially the great Bill Camp.\n\nGlengarry Glen Ross\n\nYear: 1992\n\nRuntime: 1h 40m\n\nDirector: James Foley\n\nFor a long time, it felt like David Mamet’s Pulitzer Prize-winning 1984 masterpiece was unfilmable, but Foley, working with the playwright as screenwriter, figured it out, assembling one of the best ensembles of the ‘90s to do so. Alec Baldwin notoriously steals his one scene, but the entire cast here is a stunner, especially Al Pacino (who was Oscar-nominated), Alan Arkin, and Jack Lemmon.\n\n*The Inspection\n\nYear: 2022\n\nRuntime: 1h 34m\n\nDirector: Elegance Bratton\n\nJeremy Pope gives a nuanced performance as Ellis French in this underrated and underseen drama. Ellis has long struggled with his homosexuality, something of which his mother doesn’t approve. He runs all the way to the Marine Corps to try to hide from it, discovering himself at boot camp. Golden Globe nominee Pope is great, but this is a true ensemble piece with excellent supporting turns from Bokeem Woodbine, Gabrielle Union, and especially Raul Castillo.\n\n*The Long Game\n\nYear: 2023\n\nRuntime: 1h 52m\n\nDirector: Julio Quintana\n\nIf you’re looking for an old-fashioned, effective sports drama, look no further than this modest adaptation of the book Mustang Miracle, about a Mexican-American golf group who became the Texas state champions in 1957. Dennis Quaid is the draw as the irascible coach, but it’s the young cast who makes this work, along with solid, tender direction from Julio Quintana. It’s an easy, heartwarming watch.\n\nMay December\n\nYear: 2023\n\nRuntime: 1h 57m\n\nDirector: Todd Haynes\n\nJulianne Moore and Natalie Portman star in the latest from Carol and Far from Heaven director Todd Haynes, a stunning character study of an actress who discovers that some people are impossible to figure out. Portman plays a star who tries to get under the skin of Moore’s character, a woman who raped a child when she was a teacher, and later married that young man. Charles Melton is phenomenal as the now-grown victim, stuck in perpetual adolescence.\n\nThe Nest\n\nYear: 2020\n\nRuntime: 1h 47m\n\nDirector: Sean Durkin\n\nA victim of the pandemic, this was one of the best films of 2020. Carrie Coon and Jude Law star as a married couple with two kids who move from New York City to London in the 1980s and watch as the divides in their union start to widen. A great character study amplified by Durkin’s sharp visual language, this is a fantastic domestic drama, and the best movie on this list that you probably haven’t seen.\n\nThe Power of the Dog\n\nYear: 2021\n\nRuntime: 2h 6m\n\nDirector: Jane Campion\n\nThe film that finally won an Oscar for Jane Campion for directing is one of the most acclaimed in the history of the streaming giant. Campion helmed this adaptation of the novel of the same name by Thomas Savage, the story of a vicious landowner (Benedict Cumberbatch) who torments the new wife (Kirsten Dunst) of his brother (Jesse Plemons). A drama that plays like a thriller, this gorgeously rendered period piece unpacks themes of toxic masculinity and manipulation in a way that makes it impossible to turn away.\n\n*The Teachers’ Lounge\n\nYear: 2023\n\nRuntime: 1h 38m\n\nDirector: Ilker Catak\n\nOne of the best films of 2023, this Oscar nominee is about a teacher (the phenomenal Leonie Benesch) who ends up in a cycle of blame and confusion after a series of thefts. When she suspects that it may be a fellow teacher who is doing the stealing, things spiral out of control in this single-setting drama that plays like a thriller. Owing a great deal to Michel Haneke’s dissections of power, it’s a smart, fantastic piece of filmmaking.\n\nhttps://www.netflix.com/title/81725559\n\nAction\n\n1917\n\nYear: 2019\n\nRuntime: 1h 59m\n\nDirector: Sam Mendes\n\nThis Oscar winner doesn’t land on streaming services very often, so take this chance while you can. Sam Mendes directs a visceral recounting of a personal story told to him by his grandfather about his time in World War I, allowing the harrowing journey of a British soldier (George MacKay) to unfold in one unforgettable, unbroken shot.\n\nBaby Driver\n\nYear: 2017\n\nRuntime: 1h 53m\n\nDirector: Edgar Wright\n\nIt’s a little harder to watch this movie now given the allegations against some of its cast members, but it’s still a remarkably well-made piece of action filmmaking, the kinetically unforgettable story of a getaway driver who knows all the best tunes. Ansel Elgort, Jamie Foxx, and Lily James may be the stars of this movie, but it’s Wright’s showmanship that really steals the spotlight.\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once\n\nYear: 2022\n\nRuntime: 2h 19m\n\nDirectors: The Daniels\n\nAfter a brief stint on Amazon Prime, this is the first Netflix drop for the 2023 Best Picture winner, a movie that defies categorization as it tells a story of alternate realities and butt plugs. A film that debuted at SXSW, this daring piece of work built an audience through 2022 until it won multiple Oscars, including Best Picture and Director. It’s like nothing else. Anywhere.\n\nGodzilla Minus One\n\nYear: 2023\n\nRuntime: 2h 5m\n\nDirector: Takashi Yamazaki\n\nNetflix stunned people when they stealthily dropped this worldwide hit on their service, making a movie that wasn’t even on VOD finally available at home. The winner of the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, Godzilla Minus One is a masterful blend of action and social commentary, considered by many to be among the best in this generations-spanning franchise.\n\nThe Hateful Eight\n\nYear: 2015\n\nRuntime: 2h 47m\n\nDirector: Quentin Tarantino\n\nDebate among yourselves if this should be on the movie or TV list, but it’s still basically the same venture that was released in theaters, only slightly re-edited by Quentin Tarantino into episodes, so we say it’s a movie (and both versions of the film are now on Netflix). And it’s an underrated one, overshadowed by the way it deals with race and gender when it was released. Almost a decade later, it looks almost prescient about how divided the country would become, and it contains some of the best performances in QT’s entire filmography.\n\nThe Killer\n\nYear: 2023\n\nRuntime: 1h 59m\n\nDirector: David Fincher\n\nMichael Fassbender gives his best performance in years as an icy hired assassin who struggles to hold things together when a job goes horribly wrong. It’s a movie about a self-proclaimed perfectionist who is constantly defying his own voiceover, a great film that’s alternately hysterical and thrilling. One of the best of 2023.\n\n*The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\n\nYear: 2015\n\nRuntime: 1h 56m\n\nDirector: Guy Ritchie\n\nThis loose adaptation of the ‘60s TV show looked like it was going to be a major summer blockbuster, but it kind of ended up a box office bomb, killing a potential franchise before it really began. In part because of that fate, it’s developed a loyal cult following, people who adore its undeniably cool blend of action and a few of the most beautiful people in the world. With the recent success of Guy Ritchie’s The Gentlemen on Netflix, it’s a perfect time to chase that experience with this superior film.\n\nMiami Vice\n\nYear: 2006\n\nRuntime: 2h 12m\n\nDirector: Michael Mann\n\nJust over 20 years after the premiere of the hit series that introduced the world to Crockett and Tubbs, Michael Mann returned to Florida for this stylized adaptation starring Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx. Divisive on its release because it’s not exactly a traditional blockbuster, Miami Vice has developed a loyal following over the years for its gorgeous cinematography and intoxicating style.\n\nOldboy\n\nYear: 2003\n\nRuntime: 2h\n\nDirector: Park Chan-wook\n\nIt’s hard to explain to people how this movie moved through the film-loving world before Film Twitter was a thing. Recently restored for its 20th anniversary, Oldboy has now been dropped on Netflix again, and it’s lost none of its searing power. It’s the tale of a man who is kidnapped, and its genius is that it’s not a whodunit as much as a whydunit, forcing viewers and protagonists to wonder about a truly grisly motive until the final unforgettable act.\n\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\n\nYear: 2023\n\nRuntime: 2h 20m\n\nDirector: Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers, Justin K. Thompson\n\nWhat a gift to Netflix subscribers for this to already be on the service, mere weeks after playing in theaters and landing on Blu-ray. This is how you do a big-budget blockbuster sequel, developing the themes of the first movie and setting up the stake for what now appears will be one of the best trilogies in superhero history. Packed with so much detail and creativity, it’s a film Netflix subscribers will want to watch over and over again. Do so while you still can.\n\nSpider-Man 2\n\nYear: 2004\n\nRuntime: 2h 7m\n\nDirector: Sam Raimi\n\nMost superhero movies on streaming services are the exclusive property now of Disney+ given their ownership of the MCU, but Sony superhero films are allowed to escape the clutches every now and then and find their way to other streaming services. Right now, all three films from Sam Raimi are on Netflix. The second film is easily still the best, but they’re all worth a rewatch (yes, even the third one).\n\nComedy\n\nHit Man\n\nYear: 2024\n\nRuntime: 1h 55m\n\nDirector: Richard Linklater\n\nFuture superstar Glen Powell co-wrote and stars in this comedic gem that reminds one that movies can still be made for adults. With echoes of noir and the kind of sexy romantic dramedies that don’t get made much anymore, this is the story of an undercover cop named Gary (Powell) who talks a desperate young woman (Adria Arjona) out of having her husband murdered, setting in motion an unpredictable, funny, riveting series of events. This is one of the best films of 2024.\n\nMonty Python and the Holy Grail\n\nYear: 1975\n\nRuntime: 1h 29m\n\nDirector: Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones\n\nDuring a hiatus between the third and fourth seasons of Monty Python’s Family Circus, the gang of mega-talented comedians decided to make movie history. Inspired by the King Arthur legend, Holy Grail is a timeless comedy, the rare kind of film that will still be making people laugh hundreds of years from now. And while the Monty Python boys were already famous, this film took them to another level, cementing their place in movie history.\n\nPineapple Express\n\nYear: 2008\n\nRuntime: 1h 52m\n\nDirector: David Gordon Green\n\nSeth Rogen gives one of his best performances as Dale Denton, an average guy who just wants to get high. He visits his dealer (played perfectly by James Franco) on the wrong night as the pair cross paths with hitmen and a police officer on the wrong side of the law. This is an incredibly funny movie, and you don’t need to be high to love it.\n\nHorror\n\nThe Babadook\n\nYear: 2014\n\nRuntime: 1h 33m\n\nDirector: Jennifer Kent\n\nOne of the best horror films of the 2010s has not been widely available for streaming subscribers so take the chance to watch it again while it’s on Netflix. Jennifer Kent’s directorial debut centers on a mother (Essie Davis) who struggles to raise her problem child alone after the death of her husband. Oh, and there’s also a real monster in the boy’s room.\n\nGerald’s Game\n\nYear: 2017\n\nRuntime: 1h 43m\n\nDirector: Mike Flanagan\n\nBefore he helmed The Haunting of Hill House, Mike Flanagan co-wrote and directed one of the best Netflix Original horror films in this adaptation of Stephen King’s 1992 novel of the same name. Carla Gugino is phenomenal as a woman who gets handcuffed to her bed by her toxic husband…and then he has a heart attack. As she tries to figure out how she will survive, she accesses the trauma of her past.\n\nFor Kids & Family\n\n*Monster House\n\nYear: 2006\n\nRuntime: 1h 30m\n\nDirector: Gil Kenan\n\nEveryone had a house in their neighborhood that the kids avoided, and Gil Kenan turned that shared fear into a clever and action-packed animated film about a creepy mansion that literally comes to life and tries to eat people. Using a motion-capture technique instead of pure CGI, this is a visually dated film, but the storytelling is funny, feeling almost like an early influence on Stranger Things in the way it channels ‘80s influences like Steven Spielberg.\n\nGuillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio\n\nYear: 2022\n\nRuntime: 1h 56m\n\nDirector: Guillermo del Toro, Mark Gustafson\n\nThe Oscar-winning director took his visionary skills to stop-motion animation with this instant classic, a retelling of the beloved fairy tale about the wooden boy who longed to be real. With spectacular voice work, this version reimagines Pinocchio during the period before World War II, allowing del Toro to explore his themes of innocence and violence again. It’s a deeply personal, beautiful film.\n\nWendell & Wild\n\nYear: 2022\n\nRuntime: 1h 46m\n\nDirector: Henry Selick\n\nThe director of A Nightmare Before Christmas and Coraline finally returned this year with this clever and twisted tale co-written by Oscar winner Jordan Peele. The comedian also co-stars as one of the title characters, the literal demons for a girl who blames herself for the death of her parents. Selick is a master of stop-motion animation and this project allows him to stretch his visual prowess in new, gross ways. It’s a new Halloween classic (that can be watched any time, of course!)\n\nIf you subscribe to a service through our links, Vulture may earn an affiliate commission."
