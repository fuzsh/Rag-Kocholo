        "text": "The commercialised male gaze has facilitated a postfeminist culture in which women continue to be moulded into scopophilic pleasures and now willingly participate in presenting themselves as such, out of a self-proclaimed right to reclaim their sexualities. This thesis explores the way in which contemporary action heroines are visually represented by deconstructing three filmic examples of contemporary action films. The iconographic figures of the action babe heroine, the superheroine and the contemporary femme fatale are depicted in the blockbusters; Tomb Raider (2018), Wonder Woman (2017) and Red Sparrow (2018). As major adaptations of literary texts and video games, the movies serve as modernised representations of visual spectacles. Close textual analysis traces the evolution of the iconographic figures from their initial appearances in source materials through to their current iterations, as presented in the aforementioned films. The evolution of heroine representation is conte...\n\nThis paper addresses the aesthetic and semiotic issues of dress, agency and desire as they are articulated around the figure of the female gun-slinger in action-driven genres. It explores the problems that this complex figure presents for feminist critics, in relation to the fetishisation of the female action figure, the potential for readings of cooption or resistance embodied in the transvestite heroine, and the celebration of cinematic violence. It also explores a number of strategies whereby film-makers and narratives contrive to contain the transgressive potential of the female gun-slinger. With particular reference to Salt (Phillip Noyce 2010), it highlights issues of transformation, performance and identity, focusing on the operation of costume as an ‘alternative discourse’ within the text. It considers the limitations and potential of the contemporary action heroine as an empowering female figure within popular culture.\n\nAction movie has established itself as one of the leading movie genres which has been present in the film industry for a long time. However, action movie genre has been characterized as male-oriented. This study aims to reveal the issue of patriarchal society and women&#39;s position represented in action movie entitled Taken , directed by Pierre Morel. Research problems in this study are related to: (a) how is the superiority of men depicted in the movie, and (b) how is women represented as the secondary subject. To analyze the movie, this study used the theory of Simone de Beauvoir especially in her book, The Second Sex. The result of this study showed that Taken movie reproduce the stereotype of action movie genre as male-oriented and women is considered as the secondary subject. Keywords: Taken, Action Movie Genre, Patriarchal Society, Secondary Subject, Simone de Beauvoir.\n\nThe construction of femininity is discussed in this paper through female characters as portrayed both in Disney princesses films and the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). How these femininities contribute to the collective imaginary help us understand how society has evolved to some extent, but maybe not as much as we would like to think."
