        "text": "From W.O. Bentley, who founded Bentley Motors in 1919, to the current team of over 4,000 dedicated employees, the company’s extraordinary cars have always been designed and built by exceptional people using only the finest of materials. They have always been driven by exceptional people, too. From the passionate Bentley Boys and Girls who raced the cars in the 1920s, encouraging W.O. Bentley to achieve ever greater feats of engineering, to the visionary Bentley owners of today, Bentley drivers help to shape the world around them.\n\nAs a brand we are also constantly looking forwards, and in this section you will find our technological innovations and future vision for Bentley. And now we are going further, towards a more sustainable future. In 2020 Bentley Motors launched the ‘Beyond100’ Manifesto, which outlines our intention to become the most sustainable luxury Automotive brand in the world.\n\nThe unique relationship between those who create the cars and those who drive them has helped create an enthralling story unlike any other. Explore the stories below to find out more.\n\nBy the 1930s, Bentley’s Derby-built ‘silent sports cars’ had become lower and sleeker. So in 1933, artist Charles Sykes, the designer of the Rolls-Royce Spirit of Ecstasy, was commissioned to create a new mascot. Sykes designed a single wing with a forward-leaning ‘B’ in the Art Deco style, with facets that allowed the ‘B’ to read correctly when viewed from either side. However, the single wing wasn’t popular, so the design was altered to feature a pair of wings. An alternative rearward-leaning Flying B was also available for MR and MX series overdrive Bentleys, to signify their sporting character. Owners had to remember to twist these mascots sideways before opening the bonnet, or risk denting the bodywork.\n\nW.O. Bentley’s reputation as an engineer was forged before WWI when the French-made DFP in which he competed achieved a number of class wins in races and hillclimbs. W.O. was one of the first engineers to realise the performance advantages of aluminium as a piston material; this gave him a competitive advantage when racing the DFP and led to his wartime commission to design the Bentley Rotary 1 and 2 fighter aircraft engines. Discharged in 1919, Captain W.O. Bentley M.B.E set about creating the car that he’d been dreaming of throughout the long years of war. His experience of aircraft engines and their imperative for power with endurance had given him an excellent grounding; he was also influenced by two pre-war engine designs, the 1914 Grand Prix Mercedes and the 1913 Coupe de l’Auto Peugeot. Bentley’s 3 Litre monobloc engine featured four valves per cylinder, twin spark plugs, twin magnetos and made extensive use of aluminium and magnesium; an advanced specification for 1920, particularly for a road-going car. Like every Bentley since, the 3 Litre engine developed generous amounts of torque from low rpm, was durable, strong and capable of high performance. EXP 1 received a glowing test drive report in The Autocar from pioneer motoring journalist SCH ‘Sammy’ Davis: “For the man who wants a true sporting type of light-bodied car for use on a Continental tour – where speed limits are not meant to be observed – the 3 Litre Bentley is undoubtedly the car par excellence.” Meanwhile its stablemate EXP 2 made its debut at the 1919 Olympia Motor Show, though due to the late arrival of some engine components it was a static display model.\n\nThe Blower’s finest hour arrived in the 1930 French Grand Prix at Pau; amid a field of Bugatti Grand Prix cars, Birkin wrestled the huge Bentley to a heroic 2nd place. At a start line weight of over 2 tonnes, Birkin’s Blower was almost certainly the heaviest car ever entered in a grand prix, a roadgoing tourer among purpose-built racing cars. Another of Birkin’s Blower Bentleys, registration UU 5871, was converted to a single seater with faired-in radiator for racing on the banked circuit at Brooklands. With the engine now delivering 240bhp, Birkin recorded a lap record at Brooklands of 137.96mph in March 1932, his car often airborne due to the poor quality of the concrete banking. In the words of engineer and automotive historian Laurence Pomeroy, “the spectacular feats of driving by Birkin, and the magnificent and imposing appearance of these cars, have contributed to give them a heroic and legendary fame.”\n\nW.O. Bentley believed that the best way to increase power was to increase capacity, as opposed to Tim Birkin’s faith in supercharging. He therefore developed a new, larger engine to succeed the 4½ Litre. With a bore of 100 mm and a stroke of 140 mm, his new straight six had a capacity of almost 6.6 litres. In base form, with a single Smiths five-jet carburettor, twin magnetos and a compression ratio of 4.4:1, the 6½ Litre delivered 147 bhp at 3500 rpm. 362 examples were built at Bentley’s factory in Cricklewood, North London, on a variety of chassis of different lengths depending on the body style requirements of individual customers.\n\nFor many years it was believed that the Bentley Speed Six in which Woolf Barnato beat the Blue Train was a two-door coupé bodied by the coachbuilders Gurney Nutting. Certainly, the Bentley chairman did own the car; and it was the Gurney Nutting coupé that contemporary artist Terence Cuneo depicted in his famous painting of the duel. But recently Bruce McCaw, current owner of the Gurney Nutting Speed Six, uncovered evidence that it may not have been finished until after the date of the drive. Some historians believe that Barnato, who owned a stable of Bentleys, raced the Blue Train in his Mulliner-bodied four-door Speed Six saloon, not the Gurney Nutting coupé. To put the controversy to bed, Seattle-based collector McCaw traced the chassis and engine of Barnato’s Mulliner-bodied Speed Six, and also located the bodywork on a different Bentley chassis. He reunited the chassis with its original bodywork and showed the restored Mulliner Speed Six alongside his Gurney Nutting Speed Six at the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance in August 2003. Bruce McCaw accepts that it was probably the Mulliner-bodied saloon that raced the Blue Train, although definitive proof may never be uncovered. But the Gurney Nutting Coupé is still widely known as the Blue Train Coupé, and it remains one of the most iconic car designs in Bentley history.\n\nThe first production 8 Litre was delivered to the music hall star ‘Gentleman’ Jack Buchanan in October 1930. W.O. took the second car, chassis YF 5002, as his personal car, commissioning H.J. Mulliner to build a saloon body on the 12-foot short-wheelbase chassis. Originally registered GK 706, this car was W.O.’s personal transport from October 1930 for the next two years. He drove it for thousands of miles in Britain and Europe, and recalled travelling from Dieppe to Cannes, ‘…in the day, without having to switch on the lights, cruising at around 85mph for hour after hour’. For a present, his wife commissioned a painting by celebrated artist Ray Nockolds showing her back-seat view of W.O. at the wheel.\n\nThe first Mark V prototypes were warmly received by the Board of Directors and a series of Mark V Bentleys were prepared for long-distance testing in continental Europe during 1938. The company also commissioned an aerodynamic version called the Corniche; it was designed by Georges Paulin, creator of the influential Embiricos Bentley, and bodied by Carosserie Vanvooren in France. Unfortunately this ‘missing link’ between pre-war Embiricos and post-war Continental was badly damaged in a crash on 7th August 1939 in France; the chassis was returned to Derby while the entire body was removed and repaired at a local coachworks. The repaired body was later waiting on the dockside at Dieppe when it was caught in a bombing raid and completely destroyed. Another one-off prototype was an eight-cylinder version of the Mark V, nicknamed the ‘Scalded Cat’ due to its electrifying performance.\n\nUsing the R-Type chassis as a base, Evernden and Blatchley designed a grand tourer in the Bentley tradition, using aerodynamics and lightweight construction to create a vehicle capable of running for long periods at high speed across Continental Europe. It became an icon of its era; beautifully crafted, fast and exclusive. Mechanically, the standard 4,566cc, six-cylinder in-line engine was gently tuned, raising the power from 140 to 153bhp, with a higher final drive ratio to take advantage of the lighter, more aerodynamic body. Coachbuilders H.J. Mulliner were tasked with creating the new, streamlined Bentley coupé. To save weight, the bodywork was made in aluminium, as were the window frames, the windscreen surround and the backlight. Even the seat frames and bumpers were aluminium. To pare weight to a minimum, a radio was considered superfluous. Weight was the critical factor; tyres that could carry a two-ton motor car at speeds of over 115mph didn’t exist in 1950. Evernden calculated that if the new grand tourer were to cruise at 100mph or more, it would have to weigh a maximum of 34 cwt (around 1750 kilograms). Even so, this combination of weight and speed was right on the limit for the specified Dunlop Medium Distance Track tyres. All the hard work paid off. In September 1951, at the Montlhèry track near Paris, the sleek new Bentley averaged 118.75 mph over five laps, with a best lap speed just under 120mph.\n\nUp to this point the prototype - OLG 490, nicknamed Olga – was a semi-official project. Some on the Board of Directors felt it was ‘too sporty’ for a company that also made Rolls-Royce limousines. But with the help of allies within the company and its overseas dealerships, Evernden persuaded The Board that a market existed for a coachbuilt Bentley grand tourer. As he had hoped, orders came in from all over the world, even at the immense price of £6,928 including UK purchase tax. To put this in context, in 1952 Britain the average annual salary was £468, and the average house cost £1891. Many owners specified extras, which had an impact upon the weight of some models produced during the R-Type Continental’s three years of production. A bigger bore engine with a capacity of 4,887cc maintained the performance, with a practical top speed of around 115mph and easy cruising at 100mph. Later production cars also differed from ‘Olga’ in having a lower roofline, a one-piece windscreen and revised wing line. By the time production ended in 1955, 208 R-Type Continentals had been built. All but 15 of them were bodied by H.J. Mulliner.\n\nThe open road. The open skies. The Azure. Originally launched in 1995, and subsequently followed by the second generation in 2006, the Azure is a convertible that was unmatched, in its time, in performance and potency and one that is truly evocative. In every sense a Bentley, with perfect interior refinement and a flowing silhouette. This is a car that takes a mere 25 seconds for its roof to glide away revealing the freedom of the heavens. A computer-controlled four-speed automatic gearbox brings a smoother shift and more interaction to the driving experience translating the power of the 6.75 Litre twin turbocharged, V8 engine into effortless propulsion. The Azure was not only a luxury car but also a serious performance car, accelerating from 0-60mph in 5.6 seconds (0-100km/h in 5.9 seconds), with a top speed of 171 mph (274km/h) available on demand.\n\nLuxury and power is an intoxicating mix; one which the Azure had so naturally perfected. Next came the Azure T. All the elegance, fluid lines and hand craftsmanship of the Azure, but with a new potency that made it more desirable than ever. A sporting pedigree that can be traced back to a celebrated era of Bentley design reflected in its muscular, imposing stance. Yet this was an unquestionably contemporary car; a luxurious British masterpiece in the finest tradition. From its distinctive, confident presence through to the sophisticated styling of the interior creating a pure luxury open-top experience for four companions. The Azure T bestowed a sense of freedom; the infinite space of the sky matched by the indescribable feeling of the wave of torque. 1000Nm (738 lb-ft) released by the iconic 6.5 Litre twin-turbocharged V8 engine. Now with the heightened potential of 500bhp (373kW) and the sheer exhilaration of reaching 60mph in just 5.2 seconds (0-100km/h in just 5.5 seconds), with a top speed of 179 mph (288 km/h). A formidable force, perfectly balanced to assure and inspire.\n\nArnage R since its introduction in 2002, has been an unrivalled example of the Grand Touring philosophy, making every journey a unique experience of power, luxury and control. This is a place where two very different worlds are perfectly united. Tradition and technology in absolute harmony. From the flawless leather of the seats to the computer-controlled six-speed gear box, driver and passengers sit in an environment of stunning aesthetics and fingertip control. An oasis from which to savour every nuance of the twin-turbocharged 6.75 Litre V8 engine, with 400bhp at your command. A 0-60mph time of 5.9 seconds (0-100km/h in 6.3 seconds) and a top speed of 155mph (249km/h) waiting to be relished.\n\nLaunched in 2001, the Arnage RL is the culmination of world-class coachbuilding that spans generations. It is a car that takes personalisation to a new level, where the vehicle is a canvas on which you can paint your vision. With its extended wheelbase, 2 inches (50mm) to the front and 8 inches (200mm) to the rear compartment, the RL retains the classic Arnage profile whilst offering even more palatial comfort for the passengers. But make no mistake; this is a car to drive. The turbocharged 6.75 Litre V8 engine, harnessed by a highly engaging sixspeed automatic gearbox, makes this an experience impossible to miss. The Arnage RL gave its owners the opportunity to realise virtually anything imaginable - all designed and handcrafted by the most skilled automotive artisans in the world. These are people who understand not only the heritage of Bentley, but also the pleasures of luxury in a contemporary world. From fashioners of burnished walnut and fine hides to the audio experts who can turn the interior of a Bentley into a concert hall, to specialists who can bring the cinema or television to the rear seat.\n\nFrom its debut in 1998 the Arnage conveyed an air of sophisticated understatement as the four-door flagship of the Bentley range. Over the next decade the car experienced a period of constant refinement to its body, design, chassis and powertrain to maintain its class-leading position in the high luxury market. To celebrate 10 years of the Arnage, 50 years of its mighty V8 engine and 90 years of the marque, Bentley Motors launched Bentley Arnage Final Series. This model featured a unique specification, combining the performance of the 500 bhp Arnage T with the refinement of the Arnage R and design elements from the Brooklands coupé, for the ultimate expression of British luxury and effortless power in a four-door saloon – a grand finale, for the grandest of Bentleys, in an exclusive run of only 150 cars."
