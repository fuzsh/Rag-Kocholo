        "text": "PRESALE - Kurious - Majician (Rhymesayers)\n\nRed and Yellow Vinyl LP £24.49 Add to basket\n\nEstimated Shipping Date: 20th September 2024\n\nBy his early 20s, Kurious was already an in-demand voice on the mic. His 1994 major label debut album, A Constipated Monkey, is a classic of its style, marked by heavy beats and nimble rhymes that are razor-sharp yet frequently hilarious. Despite being hailed as one of hip-hop's most compelling lyricists, he didn't release another solo IP for the rest of that decade, but he continued to be sought after. Rap fans the world over know him for his verse on \"?,\" one of the standout songs from his longtime friend and collaborator MF DOOM's heralded Operation:Doomsday.\n\nAs he prepares for the release of his new album, Majician-the nickname his peers blessed him with a generation agoKurious is well on his way to establishing the legacy he's long deserved. The LP, which was executive produced by MF DOOM before his passing, is a mesmerizing blend of technical wizardry and personal introspection. Take \"Eye of Horus,\" where the pulsing drums convey an urgency that borders on panic; Kurious weaves a complex tapestry of history and insight, but does so while ducking through and under each pocket in the beat.\n\nProduced in its entirety by Mono En Stereo, Majician is filled with songs like \"Eye of Horus,\" which dance on the line between confession and confrontation. \"Separation Anxiety\" is a personal bloodletting in the form of lyrical exercise; \"Par For the Course,\" which features the elusive Mr. Fantastik, makes drum breaks from the early Reagan era sound totally revitalized. Through the radical amount of work Kurious put into the writing and recording of this material, he's removed all ambiguity from the question of whether he can stand as one of the premier MCs of his time.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1. Unknown Species 2. Untainted 3. Tis The Season 4. Eye of Horus 5. 1984 6.Teach & Forgive 7. Separation Anxiety 8. Cow's Eye 9. Bacalao Opera 10. Majical Journey 11. Barry Gibb 12. Par For The Course feat. Mr. Fantastik 13. Open feat. Homeboy Sandman 14. Majic Interlude 15. Come Back\n\nPRESALE - Sun Ra - Lanquidity (25th Anniversary) (Strut Records)\n\nReissue Vinyl LP £27.49 Add to basket\n\nEstimated Shipping Date: 27th September 2024\n\nStrut proudly presents a special edition, deluxe repress of Sun Ras classic Lanquidity, for the 25th anniversary of the label. Housed in a tip-on sleeve with OBI strip, this new special editions features an A2 poster including a rare Veryl Oakland photograph of Sun Ra in his home, as well as liner notes by Tom Buchler (Philly Jazz), Michael Ray and Danny Ray Thompson (Sun Ra Arkestra) and Bob Blank. Originally released in 1978 on Philly Jazz, Lanquidity was recorded overnight at Bob Banks Blank Tapes studio on 17th July 1978 following a performance on Saturday Night Live. Most critics felt that it was more of a fusion-inspired record, explains Michael Ray. As the name suggests, the album is liquid and languid. Bob Blank adds, Musically, it was very ad hoc and freeform. There were horn charts but most tracks came out of improvised jams. Sun Ra just did his thing.\n\nThe album 'Lanquidity' consists of five smooth tracks from the Sun Ra discography. It begins gently with 'Lanquidity,' a spontaneous composition by Sun Ra described by Danny Ray Thompson as reminiscent of an Ancient Egyptian Stargazing Ceremony, plotting the stars and planets. 'Where Pathways Meet' follows, featuring Sun Ra's funky interpretation of an Egyptian march, evoking the image of Pharaoh rallying his troops. 'Thats How I Feel' maintains a relaxed groove, featuring reflective trumpet lines from Eddie Gale and solos by John Gilmore and Marshall Allen, with Allen's oboe described as reminiscent of snake-charming. 'Twin Stars Of Thence' dances around Richard Williams' celebrated elastic bassline, while the haunting closer, 'There Are Other Worlds (They Have Not Told You Of),' epitomizes \"space music,\" described by poet Mama Nzinga as 'The essence of light. Spirit takes a ride inside the deep dark space of just being.' Start to finish, Lanquidity remains an effortless, psychedelic pleasure and one of the strongest in the Ra 70's discography.\n\nThis new deluxe LP edition of Lanquidity features the widely distributed version of the album originally released on Philly Jazz and reflects the albums original packaging with a metallic foil / magenta sleeve, housed in a tip-on sleeve with OBI strip and featuring both liner notes and a limited edition poster, to celebrate 25 years of Strut records.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\nSide A:\n\nA1. Lanquidity A2. Where Pathways Meet A3. Thats How I Feel\n\nSide B: B1. Twin Stars Of Thence B2. There Are Other Worlds (They Have Not Told You Of)\n\nPRESALE - Kelly Finnigan - A Lover Was Born (Colemine Records)\n\nVinyl LP £24.49 Add to basket\n\nBlue Vinyl LP £24.49 Add to basket\n\nCD £11.99 Add to basket\n\nCassette £11.49 Add to basket\n\nEstimated Shipping Date: 18th October 2024\n\nA Lover Was Born is a testimony that these deep cut grooves are not resigned to nostalgia, instead, they are at the burning heart of longing and hope.\n\nThe journey Finnigan takes listeners on over Lovers eleven tracks echo the state of motion and growth since his solo debut, The Tales People Tell (2019). These two records bookend a prolific period of output, including a pair of Monophonics albums, a Christmas album, a mixtape, and a full slate of producing other artists (The Ironsides, Alanna Royale, the Sextones). Theres nothing like making records, says Finnigan. It feels like thats my purpose  the reason I was put on this earth.\n\nWritten in California, Ohio, and Staten Island, Kelly Finnigan collaborated with old friends in and outside the studio. I enjoy working alone but its not how you want to make a record almost everybody I brought in for this album Ive worked with, toured with or spent a great deal of time with. Max and Joe Ramey (The Ironsides), Jimmy James (Parlor Greens), Sergio Rios (Orgone), Joey Crispiano (Dap Kings) and Jay Mumford (aka J-Zone) all contribute to the overall sound of A Lover Was Born.\n\nDramatic influences like Isaac Hayes (check out the piano on Be Your Own Shelter) and Jerry Ragovoy are chopped and folded into Northern Soul uptempo numbers to create stompers like Get a Hold of Yourself or Chosen Few.\n\nFinnigans take on Deep Soul is captured brilliantly on Walk Away from Me and Love (Your Pain Goes Deep), while Boom Bap pervades on hard hitters His Love Aint Real & Cold World. Slower songs such as Let Me Count the Reasons, the emotional All Thats Left, and the soul-stirring album closer Count Me Out show the honest and tender side that has become Finnigans calling card.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\nProve My Love | Be Your Own Shelter | Cold World | His Love Ain't Real | Get A Hold Of Yourself | All That's Left | Love (Your Pain Goes Deep) | Let Me Count the Reasons | Chosen Few | Walk Away from Me | Count Me Out\n\nPRESALE - Homer - Ensatina (Big Crown Records)\n\nVinyl LP £22.49 Add to basket\n\nOrange Vinyl LP £23.49 Add to basket\n\nCD £11.99 Add to basket\n\nCassette £9.49 Add to basket\n\nEstimated Shipping Date: 15th November 2024\n\nHomer Steinweiss has an incredibly storied career in music that started when he was just a teenager. He's drummed for nearly every \"retro soul\" group that mattered and his distinctive stickwork helped blend the raw-but-receptive soul sound back into the mainstream via the likes of Amy Winehouse & Sharon Jones. Hes now one of the most in demand drummers in the world, playing with Jonas Brothers, Clairo, Solange, Adele, and Bruno Mars to name a few. With his debut solo release Ensatina, Homer is stepping to the forefront as both musician and producer. His new record is a re ection of who he is now and a testament to how struggle often brings about a needed change.\n\nIn 2020 Homer had to reckon with considerable emotional turbulence; at the same time that his band Holy Hive broke up, a personal relationship of 20+ years fell apart putting Homer in an uncertain place mentally. The fallout was signi cant enough for him to seek professional help. \"I was going through these super manic highs and then very depressive lows,\" Homer describes. \"And being in all that, it's just so tough to imagine that the other side is there, that it'll be ok.\" But, with time, professional help, and support from friends and family, Homer made it through and has been forever changed. This album is a product of that period of his life.\n\nThe first song from these sessions, Now That Its Over perfectly sums up Homers triumph through those tough times. It's a song of changing perspective and contemplation with haunting vocals from Hether and Flikka. \"Paul (Castelluzzo aka, Hether), as a friend, saw me through these highs and lows,\" Homer points out. \"I only had the one line, 'Now that it's over, I'm alright,' but he felt that lyric so much that he wrote all these sections and lyrics and basically completed the song. It was like he was writing to me.\"\n\nHether also features on album standouts Deep Sea, a modern love song, Start Select, a juxtaposition of inspiration and melancholy, and Forever and Ever and Ever and Ever which is an incredible contemporary take on the B side soul ballad. Homer uses his innate gift for bringing seemingly opposing energies together on Racecar Driver, pairing the vocals of Hether & long time friend and collaborator KIRBY to make a genre challenging banger. KIRBY also graces the album opener Rollin, an airy, warm-weather invoking song that her raspy voice perfectly compliments. He puts his drumming front and center on So Get Up!, a bottom heavy infectious track that MINOVAs vocals turn into an instant hit that is sure to smash speakers. On Wishing Well & Hide It Behind the Light Im Shining Through Homer is joined by girl named GOLDEN, whos unique voice effortlessly fi nds the pocket in each tune. The man on trumpet, and fellow Big Crown label mate Dave Guy, puts his incomparable playing on the album closer Goldie which Homer says is the part of the movie where the credits roll.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\nSide A:\n\nRollin feat. KIRBY | Camera feat. girl named GOLDEN | Deep Sea feat. Hether | Now That Its Over feat. Hether & Flikka | Racecar Driver feat. KIRBY, Hether, and girl named GOLDEN | So Get Up! feat.

While the first installment of King Of The Mischievous South was performed from the perspective of his Raven Miyagi persona, a name bestowed upon him by Raider Klan founder SpaceGhostPurrp, Volume 2 finds Curry operating under his Big Ultra persona -- an elevated version of Raven Miyagi that is bragadocious and revels in the success that Curry has seen over the last decade of his career. Creating King Of The Mischievous South Volume 2 has been a goal of Curry's for some time, though his earliest attempts to do so ultimately morphed into other projects, namely his 2016 album Imperial and 2020's 13LOOD 1N + 13LOOD OUT.\n\nIt wasn't until he stopped overly attempting to create Volume 2 that its songs started to emerge naturally.? Given the project's sound, which pays homage to the great musical heritages of the South -- from Memphis to Houston and Curry's own South Florida -- its features include the region's greats, both old and new, as well as others whose style is indebted to the South's musical legacy. Features include fellow former Raider Klan member Key Nyata, Memphis stalwarts Juicy J and Project Pat, Texas' Maxo Kream, That Mexican OT and Mike Dimes, North Carolinas TiaCorine, Atlanta's 2 Chainz and Kenny Mason and South Florida's Ski Mask The Slump God and PlayThatBoiZay, as well as ASAP Ferg and ASAP Rocky, among others\n\nTrack Listing:\n\nKotms II Intro (feat Kingpin Skinny Pimp) | Ultra Shxt (feat Key Nyata) | Set It (feat Maxo Kream) | Hot One (feat Tiacorine & Asap Ferg) | Black Flag Freestyle (feat Mexican OT) | Headcrack Interlude (feat Kingpin Skinny Pimp) | G'z Up (feat 2 Chainz & Mike Dimes) | Lunatic Interlude | Sked (Featn Kenny Mason & Project Pat) | Choose Wisely Interlude (feat Kingpin Skinny Pimp) | Cole Pimp (feat Ty Dolla Sign & Juicy J) | Wishlist (feat Armani White) | Hit The Floor (feat Ski Mask Slump God) | Hoodlumz (feat Asap Rocky & Playthatboizay) | Kotms II Outro (feat Kingpin Skinny Pimp)\n\nPRESALE - Leon Bridges - Leon (Sony)\n\nVinyl LP £21.49 Add to basket\n\nMarbled Vinyl LP £24.49 Add to basket\n\nCD £12.49 Add to basket\n\nEstimated Shipping Date: 4th October 2024\n\nLeon is the highly anticipated fourth album from Grammy Award-winning recording artist, songwriter, and producer Leon Bridges. With 13 tracks featuring Leons signature storytelling and a unique blend of organic genre alchemy, Leon is his most poignant, powerful, and personal work to date. He takes fans on a trip through the heart of Ft. Worth he knows best, the things he holds dear, and the people and places that shaped him. Featuring production by Ian Fitchuk (Beyonce, Noah Kahan), Daniel Tashian (Kacey Musgraves), and Tyler Johnson (Harry Styles, Miley Cyrus), Leon describes the album as somewhat of a self-portrait Im excited to share these stories about my home, about nostalgia, about my upbringing, about where Im from, with all of you. I hope this music brings you back to your roots and your journey.\n\nQuote Frome Leon: Leon has been a long-time coming. I started writing pieces of it as far back as Gold-Diggers Sound. They didnt fit what I was trying to do with that album and I tried moving on. But I couldnt shake them because theyre part of me. And, if Im honest, also because I think this is some of my most excellent work yet.In many ways, Leon has been in the works since my childhood. This record is about simpler days. Its about time spent in my beloved Fort Worth and the experiences that made me the man I am today. Its soulful music in the truest sense - its imbued with my soul.Im excited to share these stories about my home, about nostalgia, about my upbringing, about where Im from, with all of you.

There are the weighty drums, a crooning guitar, and a beautiful voice singing about unrequited love and the complications inherent in affairs of the heart. But then there is something undeniably different about Thee Marloes and their music, something new and distinct. And while you may be acquainted with soul music, you've probably never heard it from Surabaya, Indonesia the place they call home.\n\nThee Marloes are Natassya Sianturi singing and playing keys, Tommy Satwick on drums, and Sinatrya (\"Raka\") Dharaka on guitar and handling production. Their sound has the universal appeal of soul, jazz, and pop, but with a distinct approach attributable to their local culture and global influence. The world's introduction to Thee Marloes' debut album Perak, started with Midnight Hotline the scorching A side to their debut 7 on Big Crown. A punchy dance-floor number with an infectious chorus, vibey piano, and jazzy guitar licks.\n\nPerak is a journey from the heart of Surabaya into the spirit of the soul sound. It's about creating a space where none existed, and doing it because you love it. You can tell that Thee Marloes enjoy making their music, from the process of writing and recording, to performing in front of crowds. \"We want to share what we live,\" Natassya tells us. No matter what language you speak or culture you come from, Thee Marloes music and energy is so charming that we will all be keeping it close to the turntable for years to come.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\nSide A: I Know | Logika | Summer | Midnight Hotline | Beri Cinta Waktu | True Love |\n\nSide B: Mungkin Saja | Not Today | Over | No One Else | Nona | Thank You |\n\nJUST IN - Joe Armon-Jones - Ceasefire (Aquarii Records)\n\nVinyl LP £19.49 Add to basket\n\nJoe Armon-Jones returns with Ceasefire, the second in a series of dub releases on his own Aquarii label, following the release of Wrong Side of Town, featuring Hak Baker, earlier this year.\n\nThis time Joe teams up with legendary reggae deejay Ranking Joe, as well as saxophonist and fellow Ezra Collective band member James Mollison.\n\nCeasefire is an uncompromising call for peace at a time of heightened global conflict. Joe Armon- Jones says, We wrote this song back in 2020 motivated by people who make money off the blood of innocent people. Ranking Joe here is calling for a Ceasefire, not just for the Israeli occupiers but for all those around the globe who would kill another human being, as such an act is despicable and never tolerated.\n\nAs well as Ranking Joe and James Mollison, Ceasefire features Black Midis Morgan Simpson on drums, Nubiyan Twist bassist Luke Wynter, and Mark Mollison guitarist for Loyle Carner and Celeste.\n\nProduced and mixed by Joe Armon-Jones with additional vocal mixing by Prince Fatty, mastered by Noah Priddle, and released via Armon-Jones own imprint Aquarii Records\n\nTrack list:\n\n1.Ceasefire (feat.

Starting with an evocative cover it was clear to fans that this album wasnt all about a party. Deep messages abound in the songs here, such as the nearly 10-minute workout Im Paying Taxes, But What Am I Buying.\n\nSocial messages aside, Fred and his assembled JBs were a party-moving funk machine at heart, as heard on If You Dont Get It The First Time, Back Up And Try It Again Party and the laid-back groove of Same Beat (with prototypical sampling of Jesse Jackson exhorting an audience to chant I am / Somebody). Nestled among these raise-your-fist classics is one of the most experimental funk cuts ever made: Blow Your Head, known to relatively modern listeners as the backbone of Public Enemys Public Enemy #1 (from 1987). Other tracks have been sampled by EPMD, Run-DMC, De La Soul, Digable Planets, and Ice-T among others.\n\nGet On Down pays reverent tribute to this classic by pressing it on 150-gram vinyl, housed in a 1970s style Stoughton jacket in an 8-gauge custom polybag emblazoned with an embossed People Records logo.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\nA1 Damn Right I'm Somebody A2 Blow Your Head A3 I'm Payin' Taxes, What Am I Buyin'?\n\nB1 Same Beat (Part 1) B2 If You Don't Get It The First Time, Back Up & Try It Again, Party B3 Make Me What You Want Me To Be B4 Going To Get A Thrill B5 You Sure Love To Ball\n\nPRESALE - Ngozi Family - 99% Confusion (Now-Again)\n\nReissue Vinyl LP £25.99 Add to basket\n\nEstimated Shipping Date: 13th September 2024\n\nA late period hard-rock, proto-punk entry in Zambian guitarist and bandleader Paul Ngozis extensive catalog.

Released under license from the Estate of Paul Nyirongo.\n\nZambia's Zamrock movement that exploded in the 1970s ... provided young musicians access to European and American music, and created a unique sound. At its root, Zamrock melded fuzz-toned psychedelia, chugging garage rock and roiling funk with a broad mix of African cadences and beats.... enlivening a scene that included bands like Musi O Tunya, Amanaz and the Ngozi Family.  The New York Times\n\nZamrock was a bona-fide rock scene, with albums released through independent labels based in Zambia. This music scene was complete, encompassing the genres of rock, acid folk, fusion, Afro-beat, South African jazz and traditional Zambian melodies. It quickly became a uniquely Zambian movement, befitting of its name. WITCH, Paul Ngozi and Amanaz sound nothing like other rock music from the African continent or elsewhere.\n\nNow-Again has been reissuing the essential records from the Zamrock scene since 2010. 99% Confusion (1977) is part of an extensive campaign centered around Paul Ngozi and his band.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\nSide 1 - 1.

Leading into the 80's, Bambaataa had found acclaim for releasing countless genre-defining tracks, infusing Hip Hop and Electronic elements into a sound that would influence other artists for years to come.\n\nWith the groundbreaking release of Soulsonic Force assisted, \"Planet Rock,\" in 1982, Afrika Bambaataa forever cemented his place in the history books as one of the most revered and innovative artists of his time. Since its release, \"Planet Rock\" has gone on to be recognized as one of the earliest Hip Hop hits and remains one of the genres most pioneering recordings. A long- time favourite amongst break-dancers, DJ's and music lovers alike, \"Planet Rock\" was ranked by Rolling Stone magazine at #240 on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, and has received Gold certification by the RIAA. Originally released in 1986 as a collection of previous singles, this highly sought after record has long since been out of production, until now.

Each LP will come with their own personally signed photo from Pale Jay. Several collaborations with up and coming artists are set to follow this release. Artist has over 3 million monthly listeners and 63k followers on Spotify. Admittedly, I'm not a great salesperson when it comes to running our little label. I do my best not to give into hyperbole or build something up too intensely if someone has not heard a new artist yet. I prefer to simply present the music and let the listener decide how they feel about it. However, we live in an age when the \"story\" put together by publicists, labels, and managers are often the driving force of an artist's ascension into the zeitgeist. And for me, that's always felt rather artificial, even when the narrative is genuine. But every once in a while, a project comes along that takes on a life of its own. And I can say without a doubt that the growth of Pale Jay's reach since we first started working with him has little to do with conjured narratives or clever marketing, but more to do with how the music makes the listener feel.\n\nIt's that simple. In fact, Jay is so enigmatic and without a narrative that the mere absence of a story has become the story. Who is he? Where is he from? What's next? Some questions are better left unanswered in my opinion, my friend. Including the question, \"Why does this music make me feel so much?\" You're better off just sitting back, disconnecting, and letting Low End Love Songs by Pale Jay wrap you up. Enjoy and spread the good word. Terry Cole (Colemine) Low End Love Songs, more so than previous releases, is a diary in form of song. I knew I just had to wait for the songs to be ready to be picked, like ripe fruit from a tree. Each tune encapsulates a distinct moment in my life, with music serving as my means of processing complex and sometimes conflicting emotions. In this album, I depart from loop-based song structures towards more intricate and lush compositions. Latin influences permeate the music, adding new layers of rhythms and textures to my soul-music roots.\n\nTracklist:\n\nTracks: 1. The Simple Days 2. Quadris De Ouro 3. Baby 4. Branch By Branch 5.

His decades-long career of beat-making has also included works for MF DOOM, Brother Ali, Murs, Rav, Sage Francis and a dozen others. Raised in a military family, his nomadic upbringing exposed him to many diverse influences and, coupled with his father's love for collecting records, laid the groundwork for his deep appreciation for all sorts of music. Ant's latest endeavor, Collection of Sounds, is a four-volume series of instrumental works showcasing the breadth and depth of his musical expertise.\n\nThe Collection of Sounds series offers a window into Ant's creative journey, reflecting his evolution as an artist over the years. Drawing from a vast vault of unreleased material, he's exhumed cross sections of his catalogue with surgical precision, organizing songs by sound rather than mere chronology. Volume 1 is at times so intimate as to border on claustrophobia, like the creeping \"Bar One,\" or the haunted twinkling of I Was Always a Collector,\" while other tracks are expansive enough to fill entire venues, like the forebodingly airy \"4-Track Beyond Beat 1996.\"\n\nTrack Listing:\n\nSide 1\n\n1.

(Blue Note Blue Vinyl Series)\n\nReissue Blue Vinyl LP £25.99 Add to basket\n\nEstimated Shipping Date: 13th September 2024\n\nBy the time he recorded GO! in 1962, Dexter Gordon had already lived several lifetimes in jazz. He was among the first to adapt the language of bebop to the tenor saxophone in the 1940s, but after a decade in which personal troubles limited his output, he signed with Blue Note in 1961 and began a run of essential albums that marked a rebirth for the tenor giant. Featuring a quartet with Sonny Clark on piano, Butch Warren on bass, and Billy Higgins on drums, GO! was a showcase of Gordons limitless creativity on hard-swinging numbers like his great tune Cheese Cake and a sure-footed version of Love for Sale, as well as his peerless artistry on ballads as evidenced on stunning takes of the standards I Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out to Dry and Where Are You.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\nSide A - Cheese Cake | I Guess Ill Hang My Tears Out To Dry | Second Balcony Jump\n\nSide B - Love For Sale | Where Are You? | Three OClock In The Morning\n\nPRESALE - Skinshape - Another Side Of Skinshape (Lewis Recordings)\n\nVinyl LP £24.99 Add to basket\n\nSigned Vinyl LP £24.99 Add to basket\n\nCD £12.99 Add to basket\n\nSigned CD £12.99 Add to basket\n\nEstimated Shipping Date: 27th September 2024\n\nSkinshape (aka Will Dorey) today announces details of his forthcoming ninth studio album titled Another Side Of Skinshape, out on the 27th September via Lewis Recordings. As the album title suggests, Doreys latest body of work is somewhat unlike anything in his prior discography. However, there is always a consistent Skinshape thread which pulsates throughout all of his music - a kind of sonic dreamscape which echoes a mystical nostalgia for a sun dappled afternoon.\n\nTaking inspiration from childhood memories, Ethiopian rhythms, and even calls to prayer, Another Side Of Skinshape gained access to the most esoteric corners of Doreys mind. Whilst Its About Time and Ananda display a slightly more synthesised palette than we typically hear of a Skinshape tune, singles Stornoway and Lady Sun (which features the hazy soul vocals of West Londons Hollie Cook) replicate the same lifeblood heard on albums Nostalgia, or Craterellus Tubaeformis.\n\nSpeaking on the album, Dorey says Some songs pay homage to the 90s whilst others the 60s and 70s. Yet you may not perceive all of these in the form that they are presented. In any case I hope that the album is enjoyable and will fit casually into the flow of your day.\n\nWhilst making this album, Dorey experimented with various keyboards and drum machines, which are at times layered over the excellent drumming of Thomas Blunt, who played live onto tape. Blunt is well versed in the Skinshape vernacular, also being part of Doreys live band. Indeed, Another Side Of Skinshape is due for release just before a run of UK and US live dates, which will be the first time the band has ever hit the open road.\n\nDorey is a former member of the band Palace, has played Glastonbury, Maida Vale, Shepherds Bush Empire, to name a few. Skinshapes I Didnt Know has streamed over 50 million times. He is proudly from Swanage, Dorest.\n\nTracklist:\n\nStornoway | Mulatu Of Ethiopia| Can You Play Me A Song? | Lady Sun (feat.

So, when Pedro visited Europe in the summer of 2023, Skinshape invited him to its London studio. Together, magic effortlessly unfolded.\n\nPedro sets the rhythm, while Skinshape sets the grain. With Skinshape weaving in basslines and other arrangements around Mizutani's mesmerizing guitar playing, the collaboration was a breeze. The two musicians understood each other in the blink of an eye.\n\nTogether, they crafted a true homage to bossa nova. Without overshadowing Mizutani's style, Skinshape brought out his full musicality. It was a seamless symbiosis. The duo created a one-of-a-kind work. In the spirit of the Afrobeats movement, one could even describe it as \"bossa-pop,\" maintaining the essence of the genre while incorporating British aesthetic elements under Skinshape's discerning ear. A sprinkling of shimmering bells here, kicks dipped in reverb there, and jazzy basslines for that extra touch of groove. As for Pedro Mizutani, he excelled in delicacy as always and did not lose altitude, soaring to even greater heights.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. Eu Pensei\n\n2. Chorar Na Beira Do Mar\n\n3.

But as great as those two powerhouse singers were, Lyn Collins was the strongest hitmaker of that funky JB era. Her strong voice and commanding stage presence - which earned her the nicknames The Female Preacher and Mama Feelgood - quickly proved to be a potent addition to the People Records universe. In the spring of 1972 her second single, the driving and ridiculously funky Think (About It) hit the R&B music world like a ton of bricks. As fans young and old know, thanks to its timeless, relentless groove and powerful vocals, Think gained a powerful second life in the 1980s thanks to the hip-hop generation, fueling the platinum smash It Takes Two, by Rob Base & DJ E-Z Rock in 1988 and additionally sampled by dozens of hip-hop and dance music artists up to the present day.\n\nBut Collins was far from a one hit wonder: she was as vocally adept on ballads as she was with full-blown funk. She proves this throughout her debut album, which was released in 1972 on James Browns new People Records - the imprint's second full-length release. To wit, aside from the title smash: a powerful and emotional cover of Bill Withers \"Aint No Sunshine\"; the socially progressive \"Womens Lib\"; the Gamble & Huff-penned \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" (originally done by Jerry Butler); and even a daring, muscular take on the song Fly Me To The Moon, made famous by, among others, Frank Sinatra. Throughout Think (About It), Collins shows that she was a vocal force to be reckoned with. Backed by a James Brown assembled musical crew that included Pee Wee Ellis, Fred Wesley and, of course, James Brown himself, the platter was bound to impress and succeed. And that it did.\n\nTracklist:\n\nA1.Think (About It) A2. Just Wont Do Right A3. Wheels Of Life A4. Aint No Sunshine A5. Things Got To Get Better\n\nB1. Never Gonna Give You Up B2.

On May 21, 1996, Too $hort released his 10th studio album Gettin' It with the lead single of the same name featuring Parliament Funkadelic. Retirement was more of a hiatus as Too $hort got back in the game in 1999 with the appropriately named album Can't Stay Away. If Gettin' It was going to be Too $hort's last album, he was going off on a high note by earning his 6th Platinum record.\n\nIn addition to having Parliament Funkadelic contribute to two songs, Ant Banks and Shorty B are back with their laid-back Bay Area funk along with some G-Funk contributions by Colin Wolfe, L.A.

KRS-One took to the mic and continued to write socially conscious raps resulting in the hard-hitting 1992 album Sex And Violence which would be the fifth and final studio album under the Boogie Down Productions name. Produced by KRS-One, Pal Joey, Kenny Parker, D-Square, and Prince Paul, the album explores the darkest sides of the American urban landscape and psyche, with KRS as narrator, detailing all sides of the matrix.\n\nWhile singles like the alarming drum-driven \"Duck Down\" and the funky-as-hell \"We In There\" got most of the attention in 92, the deeper sequence reveals plenty of additional gems: the history lesson of the dark and dusty \"Drug Dealer\"; \"Ruff Ruff\", with scowling MC favorite Freddie Foxxx (aka Bumpy Knuckles); the grooving \"Questions and Answers,\" and the frantic record industry track \"How Not To Get Jerked.\" The album kicks off with an intro skit featuring KRS-One as a DJ in panic needing vinyl which at the time was a dying format while cassettes and CDs became the dominant format. Thirty-two years later vinyl DJs and Hip-Hop vinyl collectors no longer need to panic.\n\nTrack list:\n\nA1. The Original Way (feat. Freddie Foxxx) A2. Duck Down A3. Drug Dealer A4.

With album sales over 220 million records worldwide, including albums, singles, and other formats, it is hard to argue that Eminem isn't the voice of this generation in Hip-Hop.\n\nAs he turns 50, Eminem revisits and critiques his notorious alter ego, presenting Slim Shady as a relic of toxic masculinity and outdated rage. The album's first half channels Shady's provocative style, while the latter part reflects a more mature and contemplative Eminem.\n\nThe production strikes a balance between modern sensibilities and nostalgic nods to earlier works, offering some of the best beats and hooks Eminem's had in years. Guest features, including JID and Big Sean, complement his intense delivery, enhancing the album's impact. While the content remains provocative, it effectively engages with its themes, providing a nuanced critique of both Eminem's past and the current cultural landscape. Fans of his earlier work will find much to appreciate here, though it may not break new ground. Overall, Guilty Conscience 2 is a compelling chapter in Eminems storied career.\n\nTrack list:\n\n1.

The circle became complete when by chance the LA mastering legends Becker Mastering (Doja Cat, Tyler The Creator, Harry Styles) happened upon the unreleased music when mixing engineer Mike visited their studio and asked to hear his latest work.\n\nThe EPs duration serves as a metaphor for a single day, as it spans over approximately the duration of 24 minutes, each representing an hour of the day. Ambient soundscapes are heard in-between each track, all moments captured at corresponding parts of the day on Rollos handheld microphone which he poises from his window.\n\nTrack list:\n\nIntro (Out My Window) | Venus On A Flower | Papaya | Its All Beautiful Rain | Little Bird | Sun Goes Down Behind Your House | Someones Gonna Break My Little Heart Tonight | Outro (Beautiful Rain, Part 2)\n\nPRESALE - Doug Carn Trio - Doug Carn Trio (Real Gone Records)\n\nVinyl LP £35.99 Add to basket\n\nEstimated Shipping Date: 13th September 2024\n\nKeyboardist/composer Doug Carn was the biggest star on the legendary Black Jazz Records label, with four releases to his credit (all reissued by Real Gone Music), and remains a touchstone for spiritual jazz fans and musicians alike.\n\nBut very, very few folks have heard his debut record, cut for the venerable Savoy label back in 1969. In fact, it's so rare that we couldn't even find a copy to use for artwork, so, with Doug's help, we enlisted his daughter Eroniffa Ibrahim to create illustrations for our reissue based on the original cover photos. But you know what we did find? That's right the original master tapes! So, not only is this the first LP reissue for The Doug Carn Trio, but it's an all-analog edition to boot, pressed at Gotta Groove Records with their proprietary Groove Coated stampers to minimize high-frequency loss with each successive pressing.\n\nAnd, we've added an insert with liner notes by Aaron Cohen based on an exclusive interview with the man himself. As for the music, it's a tight organ trio set that starts cooking right from the get-go with a groovin' cover of Gus Cannon's \"Walk Right In,\" which became a folk hit for The Rooftop Singers. Carn's fluid, forward-thinking playing anticipates Larry Young's future keyboard forays, and originals like \"Butter from the Duck\" and \"Yna Yna's Delight\" presage the compositional prowess he flashed on the Black Jazz releases (note: that's Don Hales on guitar, not Gary Starling as credited on the original record).\n\nThe opening salvo from a scintillating career, finally available again!\n\nTrack list:\n\n1. Walk Right In\n\n2. Butter from the Duck\n\n3. My One and Only Love\n\n4. Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child\n\n5. Free Blues\n\n6. Yna Ynas Delight\n\nPRESALE - Candido - Dancin N Brancin' (Real Gone Records)\n\nVinyl LP £32.49 Add to basket\n\nEstimated Shipping Date: 13th September 2024\n\nAs the man who basically brought the conga into the modern age with his innovative multi percussion set-ups and tuneable congas, and as a former member of Dizzy Gillespie and Stan Kenton's bands, Cándido Camero Guerra a.k.a. Candido already had a long and storied career when he cut Dancin' and Prancin' for the Salsoul label in 1979 at the age of 58.\n\nSo, you might have been excused at the time for assuming this was just another case of an old-timer trying to cash in on the disco craze, right? But you would have been very, very wrong the record was pure brilliance, as the infusion of Candido's Latin conga beats into the disco-fied 4 x 4 syncopated rhythm proved irresistible, revolutionizing the sound of underground disco while pointing the way to the house music to come. Indeed, both \"Jingo\" (an unstoppable version of the Olatunji classic) and \"Thousand Finger Man\" are still DJ favourites. Speaking of DJs, we're putting this one out on black vinyl, perfect for cueing up and spinning. A must have for any dance music library!\n\nTrack list:\n\n1. Dancin and Prancin\n\n2. Jingo\n\n3.

Michels provides his bottom-heavy, soul-tinged production for Black Thought who gives us some of the more personal and transparent verses we've ever heard from him. Michels and Black Thought have been in each other's orbit for a while now. The two ­first met in the 2000s when Thought was fi­rst getting familiar with the contemporary soul scene. \"Out of that whole world, Menahan Street Band was probably my favorite,\" recalling the funk and soul group Michels was a founding member of back in 2007.\n\nFast forward a few years and musicians from that collective Dave Guy on trumpet and Ian Hendrickson-Smith on sax are now full time players with The Roots. This connection eventually led Leon and Thought to doing a few fundraising events around NYC and Philly together. \"Before long, Black Thought was coming around the studio and would jam with us from time to time,\" Michels explains. \"Then, fast forward to 2020 and COVID lockdowns, he just hit me up out of the blue, wanting me to send him stuff to write to. We both were looking to stay busy.\"\n\nBeing that Black Thought is the co-founder and emcee for, hands down, the best live-band group in hip-hop. Michels took a decidedly different approach to this project and instead of sending recorded tracks of live compositions, he pulled out the sampler and sampled himself and some records from his collection. \"I'm a big fan of soul music,\" as if Michels has to remind us. \"And part of hip-hop's appeal to me has always been the sample-based production\" For Glorious Game, Michels would make wholly composed and recorded soul songs in his studio, sample himself, then chop and/or loop up his sounds and create instrumentals for Black Thought.\n\nOn some tracks he took a more traditional hip-hop approach, starting from samples of other peoples music but then adding live instrumentation on top. But for the most part, it's him reinterpreting his own compositions into something new. The result is an organic feel of loop-based tracks that breathe and fluctuate enough for Black Thought to flex on.\n\nTracklisting:\n\nSide A:\n\nGrateful (Instrumental) | Glorious Game (Instrumental) | Im Still Somehow (Instrumental) | Hollow Way (Instrumental) | Protocol (Instrumental) | The Weather (Instrumental)\n\nSide B:\n\nThat Girl (Instrumental) | I Would Never (Instrumental) | Alone (Instrumental) | Miracle (Instrumental) | Glorious Game (Reprise) (Instrumental) | Alter Ego feat.

Is it jazz? Sure, the London-born saxophonist, composer and bandleader grew up studying the genre under the noted pianist Nikki Yeoh at Camden Music. But it isnt until you listen to albums like 2020s Source and 2024s Odyssey that you hear broader creativity shining through: Its jazz, classical, dub, R&B and whatever else Garcia wants to convey. It all comes from a place of exploration and self-study, of wanting to do all the things across all disciplines while ignoring arbitrary boxes that dont.\n\nGarcias sophomore album Odyssey, out in September 2024 via Concord Jazz, is a majestic feat on which she blends orchestral arrangements with R&B, jazz, broken beat and dub, resulting in a grand, nuanced record that feels airy and celestial without sacricing the groove. Its a deeply personal oering about her trek to falling back in love with musical composition over the past four years.\n\nSource, her 2020 debut album, was released via Concord Jazz to massive critical acclaim, an NPR Tiny Desk (Home) Concert, a Pitchfork Best New Music review and a Rolling Stone Album of the Month mention. In a prole, The New York Times called Source a sweeping set of jazz with Afro-Caribbean inuences that funnels a lifes worth of experiences into an hourlong listen. Also upon release, the album entered the UK charts in the Top 30, and she was just one of three artists selected to perform live at Glastonburys 2020 Experience, which aired on the BBC to thousands of viewers. Source was also nominated for the Mercury Prize, a prestigious award given to the best albums from the UK or Ireland.\n\nIn 2022, Garcia toured the US in support of Khruangbin, performing in sold-out venues including Radio City Music Hall in New York, the Ryman in Nashville and the Met in Philadelphia. She then headlined her own tour in the UK and US, performing at various festivals including Glastonbury, Love Supreme, Pickathon and Newport Jazz.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1.

Lead single 7th Heaven opens the album with an anthemic energy as Daves horn lines soar over thundering drums, ethereal vocals, and dancing piano. Keeping the energy high, Footwork is a Latin inspired number that is sure to soundtrack many a dance floor from SoHo to Harlem. The synth intro of Pinky Ring cleanses your palate for the mood shift when the track drops. Deep bass tones underline the impeccable drumming and Dave effortlessly finds the pocket wasting no notes as the verses and choruses trade off.\n\nThe record leans into spiritual jazz vibes on Diamond Encore with a dark and deep almost Axelrodish rhythm track then picks the energy back up with the stomper Still Standing. Dave Wants You has a bop all its own with an unorthodox drum pattern that Dave anchors with his trumpet hits. The otherworldly arrangement of Drony Boy puts the production on a pedestal. The first intro almost serves as an intermission on the album while the second intro sets up the neck snapping track that is about to drop. A menacing guitar signals the builds and the whole thing is juxtaposed by Daves beautiful trumpet riffs. Quesodillas & Green Door begin the autumn of the album with their mellow & intimate energy and Rubys Rubies, the albums closer is the perfect ending to the journey.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n7th Heaven | Footwork | Ill Follow You | Morning Glory | Pinky Ring | Diamond Encore | Still Standing | Dave Wants You | Drony Boy | Quesodillas | The Green Door | Rubys Rubies\n\nPRESALE - Galliano - Halfway Somewhere (Brownswood)\n\nPreorder Gatefold Vinyl LP £25.99 Add to basket\n\nPreorder Blue Gatefold Vinyl LP £28.99 Add to basket\n\nPreorder CD £11.49 Add to basket\n\nEstimated Shipping Date: 30th August 2024\n\nAlmost three decades on from their last release, Acid Jazz forefathers Galliano are back with news of their new LP Halfway Somewhere which is being released on Gilles Petersons Brownswood Recordings on 30 August.\n\nBorn out of Londons underground clubs and warehouse parties of the mid to late eighties, with the debut single on the Acid Jazz label in 1988, Galliano came out of a culture that spanned music, dance, fashion, art, design, and the written word.\n\nWhen they arrived as the first act on Gilles Petersons Talkin Loud label in 1990 with Welcome to the Story (produced by Chris Bangs who invented the term Acid Jazz) dressed in Gabicci sweaters, beads and skullcaps they captured a scene built on re-invention. We were all playing around with what we could get our hands on whether that was a seventies book on Jamaican style or old Last Poets and Watts Prophets records, says Gallagher. Wed been recycling things for a few years but suddenly everything had coalesced and youve got an amalgam that seemed quite solid.\n\nFor their first album since 1997, Rob Gallagher and his partner, vocalist Valerie Etienne, are joined by Galliano stalwarts Ernie McKone on bass, Crispin Taylor on drums, and Ski Oakenfull on keys (with guests including saxophonist Jason Yarde and percussionist Crispin Spry Robinson).\n\nWhere the old Galliano recycled records they heard at clubs, today they are responding to the kaleidoscopic global jazz scene - from Total Refreshment Centre in London to International Anthem in Chicago. More than forty years since they came together, Galliano are still only Halfway Somewhere, but listening to the album they are obviously having fun getting there. I think the stars have to be aligned when you redo things, says Gallagher. Coming at it from this door is very different to the door we came into back then. But once it's existing it is something. But Im still not sure what that something is.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\nA1. Brownswood Rockers / Golden Shovel (Somebody Elses Idea) A2.

The 13 minute remix on the A-side is by Danny Krivit & Tony Smith with editing duties performed by Tony Morgan. As ever with Arthur, the music is almost impossible to describe: is it Disco? Garage House? Avant Garde? None of these tags do full justice to its sheer majesty. You best just listen. Stretching out the original with some unbelievably great percussive elements, until we're in a deeply spiritual, otherworldly realm, it's just too beautiful for words. As many have claimed,\n\nit's the prototype for EVERYTHING. The \"Ponytail Club Mix (Part 1 & 2)\", produced by Tony Morgan in the mid-90s, is in a more up-tempo style, with vocals higher in the mix, the BPM upped to 120 and the addition of a housey 4/4 kick drum. A 14 minute epic, you could say this is a more straight ahead \"club-friendly\" mix (but can things ever be that straightforward with Arthur?!) It also has some really interesting vocal parts not used in the other versions, including some vocals from guest poet Allen Ginsberg.\n\nThese remixes are part of the same original project that also produced the Another Thought album so it seems only right that they have a sleeve that matches.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\nSide A: In The Light Of The Miracle\n\nSide B: In The Light Of The Miracle - Ponytail Club Mix (Parts 1 & 2)"
