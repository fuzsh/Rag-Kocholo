We measured a signature of mental representations of rhythm in 39 participant groups in 15 countries, spanning urban societies and Indigenous populations. Listeners reproduced random ‘seed’ rhythms; their reproductions were fed back as the stimulus (as in the game of ‘telephone’), such that their biases (the prior) could be estimated from the distribution of reproductions. Every tested group showed a sparse prior with peaks at integer-ratio rhythms. However, the importance of different integer ratios varied across groups, often reflecting local musical practices. Our results suggest a common feature of music cognition: discrete rhythm ‘categories’ at small-integer ratios. These discrete representations plausibly stabilize musical systems in the face of cultural transmission but interact with culture-specific traditions to yield the diversity that is evident when mental representations are probed across many cultures. Measuring rhythm priors in 39 participant groups from 15 countries, the authors find that properties of rhythm representations are common across cultures, while variation from place to place related to local musical traditions exists.",

        "text": "We tested 39 participant groups, spanning five continents and 15 countries (Fig. 3a; see Extended Data Table 1 for a summary of each group’s demographics). The groups were chosen primarily to provide a strong test of (1) potential universality by comparing groups with diverse musical experiences and (2) the role of musical experience in shaping mental representations. We thus included groups ranging from industrialized to small-scale societies, as well as groups of musicians and dancers from some non-Western societies. We also selected groups whose musical traditions were known to have distinct rhythmic characteristics to test whether any cross-cultural variability in mental representations could be explained by exposure to local musical styles. Where possible, we tested multiple groups from the same country that differed in the nature of their presumptive musical exposure. We also tested both university students and online participants in a number of countries. Compared with the other participant groups in the same countries, university students and online participants had musical experience that was more like that of typical Western participants; these participant groups were intended to assess the potential effects of exposure to Western/globalized music on mental representations of rhythm, and thus the consequences of reliance on student and online participants in cross-cultural research37,41. We chose participant groups on the basis of these criteria in conjunction with practical constraints (we tested more groups in some countries than in others primarily due to constraints of testing time and access to particular populations).\n\nThe key questions we sought to answer were (1) whether all groups would exhibit discrete rhythm categories; (2) whether any discrete categories would consistently occur at small-integer-ratio rhythms; (3) how rhythm categories would vary across groups, if at all; and (4) whether any cross-cultural variation would be related to musical or other demographic characteristics of the group.\n\nAll groups exhibit priors with discrete modes\n\nThe measured priors are shown in Fig. 3b. Their most obvious feature is that they are non-uniform, being dominated in all cases by a set of relatively discrete modes that form local maxima in two dimensions. This need not have been the case—some or all priors could have been uniform or could have exhibited one-dimensional ridges rather than discrete two-dimensional modes. We substantiated this observation quantitatively in two ways. First, we found that in all 39 groups, 33% of the bins in the triangular rhythm space contained at least 61% of the rhythm reproductions in the fifth iteration (mean, 70.1%; range, 61.8–81.7%), suggesting that most of the probability mass is concentrated in a small portion of the space. The odds of this happening by chance are very low (P < 0.001 for points randomly positioned in the rhythm triangle, via bootstrapping). Second, the peak of the distribution in all 39 groups was at least five times larger than the uniform density (the ratio of the peak to the uniform ranged from 5.3 to 13.1, with a mean of 8.8; this ratio was significantly greater than would be expected by chance; P < 0.001 for all groups, via bootstrapping), suggesting that all distributions were far from uniform and very ‘peaky’. Although some groups have modes that are elongated more in one direction than another, all modes had clear peaks (evident in cross-sectional plots of the densities shown in Extended Data Fig. 1).\n\nAll groups exhibit modes at small-integer-ratio rhythms\n\nVisual inspection of the modes suggests that they fall on small-integer-ratio rhythms (the red crosses superimposed on Fig. 3b). To quantify the extent to which this was the case, we computed the average distance between each fifth-iteration reproduction by all participants in a given group and the closest small-integer-ratio rhythm. This measure should be small for priors with modes that are perfectly centred on small-integer ratios. We compared this measure to a null distribution obtained by computing the average minimum distance from a random set of points. All groups produced priors that were closer to small-integer ratios than would be expected by chance (P < 0.001 in all cases, via bootstrapping, Bonferroni-corrected; Fig. 4a). Given the diversity of the participant groups, this result suggests that small-integer-ratio rhythm categories are a widespread feature of human mental representations. This conclusion is further supported by two other measures of the overlap of the priors with small-integer ratios (including one where the null distribution was derived from random points constrained to be spaced similarly to the integer ratios; Methods). We obtained similar results in 13 groups who performed the same experiment at a faster tempo (pattern duration of 1,000 ms compared with 2,000 ms in the main experiment; Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1). In all 13 cases, the priors were again closer to small-integer ratios than would be expected by chance (P < 0.001 in all groups, via bootstrapping; Extended Data Fig. 2b).\n\nWe also found that some of the rhythm categories were systematically biased away from the closest small-integer ratio. Of the 22 analysed small-integer ratios, 9 had corresponding modes (estimated with a Gaussian mixture model) that were slightly but significantly biased away from the integer ratio (Fig. 4b). These biases were present cross-culturally and were similar to those previously observed in US participants. Specifically, the short intervals in the categories 1:2:3 and 2:1:3 (and their cyclic permutations) were consistently lengthened relative to the medium intervals, causing the rhythms to shift slightly towards the centre of the rhythm space (isochrony). This lengthening of the short element is characteristic of rhythm performance studied in European musicians42. A similar bias was present for 2:2:3 (and its cyclic permutations). This result suggests that some specific deviations from small-integer ratios are also a widespread feature of mental representations of rhythm.\n\nAnother feature of the data that is common across cultures is the tendency for the response distributions to be symmetric across cyclic permutations (Fig. 3). For example, the modes at 1:1:2, 1:2:1 and 2:1:1 are about equally prominent for a given participant group. However, there was reason to think that the most frequently occurring permutations would be those where the long interval occurs at the end43,44,45, because if this configuration is played cyclically, the long interval provides a gap that helps the pattern to group according to Gestalt principles43. When we compared the frequency of each cyclic permutation in each participant group, we in fact found a consistent trend in this direction: the permutation with the long interval at the end occurred more frequently in 31 of 39 groups (Extended Data Fig. 3). Similarly, in 33 of 39 groups, participants placed their first tap immediately after the long interval, suggesting that most participants in most groups tended to hear this onset as the ‘beginning’ of the pattern. See Extended Data Fig. 3 (and ‘Cyclic permutations and an analysis of symmetry’ in Methods) for further analysis.\n\nRhythm priors vary cross-culturally\n\nDespite the consistent presence of discrete modes that tend to overlap small-integer ratios, the measured priors varied across groups. To examine the dominant dimensions of variation, we performed multidimensional scaling46 on the measured priors. Two dimensions of variation captured considerable variance (85.9% of the variance in the intergroup distances measured by Jensen–Shannon divergence) and are shown here to facilitate visualization.\n\nFigure 5a shows the measured priors for each group arranged according to their positions in this space. The four groups lying at the ‘corners’ of the multidimensional scaling space provide a snapshot of the variation across groups, along with features that consistently appear (Fig. 5a, insets). All groups show modes at isochrony (1:1:1) and 1:1:2. However, the presence of other small-integer rhythms varies. We quantified the prominence of different integer-ratio rhythms as the weights on individual components of a Gaussian mixture model fitted to the data (with each component constrained to be unambiguously associated with a different integer ratio; see Extended Data Fig. 4 for the weights of components for all groups). The presence or absence of a mode at the 3:3:2 rhythm is a major source of variation, accounting for the horizontal dimension of the multidimensional scaling space (position along this dimension was highly correlated with the weight on the 3:3:2 category; r37 = 0.90; P < 0.001; 95% confidence interval (CI), (0.81, 0.94); Fig. 5b). The first dimension was also correlated with a reduction in the weight of the ‘simpler’ categories, including isochrony (1:1:1: r37 = −0.46; P = 0.028; 95% CI, (−0.67, −0.16); 1:1:2: r37 = −0.64; P < 0.001; 95% CI, (−0.8, −0.41); 2:2:1: r37 = −0.61; P < 0.001; 95% CI, (−0.77, −0.36)). The second multidimensional scaling dimension is less obviously interpretable but also correlated significantly with two of the small-integer-ratio rhythms (1:2:3: r37 = 0.56; P = 0.001; 95% CI, (0.3, 0.75); 1:3:2: r37 = 0.62; P < 0.0001; 95% CI, (0.38, 0.78); Extended Data Fig. 5), and it thus can be seen as partially embodying the strength of 6/8 rhythms. The groups at the corners also exhibit variation in the presence of 2:2:1, such that all possible combinations of modes at 2:2:1 and 3:3:2 occur: the Tsimane’ non-musicians from Bolivia show neither of these two modes, the San musicians from Botswana show both, the dancers from Mali show 3:3:2 but not 2:2:1 and the non-musicians from China show 2:2:1 but not 3:3:2. We also analysed the data using principal component analysis; the first two components captured variation along the same modes highlighted by the multidimensional scaling analysis (Extended Data Fig. 6).\n\nThe US and UK participant groups were all positioned close to the centre of the multidimensional scaling space. One speculative possibility is that this position reflects the widespread influence of Western music around the world, with different cultures having incorporated its influence in different ways.\n\nCross-cultural variation is less evident in university students\n\nThe positioning of the groups in the multidimensional scaling space (Fig. 5a) also suggests that the priors in university students and online participants from countries around the world are relatively similar to each other and to the priors of US participants. To quantify this effect in students, we first measured the distance (Jensen–Shannon divergence) between the estimated priors for pairs of student groups in different countries and compared it to that for pairs of non-student groups (from the same countries from which the student groups were drawn). This comparison revealed that the distance between student groups was significantly smaller than that between non-student groups (P = 0.004, permutation test; Cohen’s d = 1.06; difference of mean distances, 0.039; 95% CI, (0.03, 0.05); Fig. 6a). This result indicates that student participants underrepresent cross-cultural diversity. This conclusion is supported by the self-reported music listening habits of the participants, which are notably more similar between the student groups than between the corresponding non-student groups from the same countries (Fig. 6b,c and Supplementary Table 2).\n\nCross-cultural variation is less evident in online participants\n\nWe conducted an analogous analysis in online participants and obtained a similar result (smaller intergroup distances than for non-online groups; P = 0.03, permutation test; Cohen’s d = 1.46; difference of mean distances, 0.047; 95% CI, (0.02, 0.07); Fig. 6d). This result indicates that online participants also underrepresent cross-cultural diversity. As with the student groups, this conclusion is supported by self-reported music listening habits, which are more similar between the online groups than between non-online groups from the same countries (Fig. 6e,f and Supplementary Table 2).\n\nStudents and online participants resemble US participants\n\nTo quantify the similarity of student and online groups to US participants, we measured the average distance (again using Jensen–Shannon divergence as the distance measure) between priors of either student or online groups to the prior of the US student group (taken as a representative group of US participants). We then compared these two average distances to those between the US group and random sets of groups of the same size (who were not students or online participants). Student and online groups were significantly closer to US participants than were the other groups (students: P < 0.001; Cohen’s d = 2.7; difference of mean distances, 0.027; 95% CI, (0.009, 0.05); online: P = 0.014; Cohen’s d = 1.86; difference of mean distances, 0.032; 95% CI, (0.002, 0.07); via bootstrapped Jensen–Shannon divergence, as described in ‘Analysis of student and online groups’ in Methods).\n\nWhile the online participants spanned a wide range of ages, student participants tended to be younger than other groups (Extended Data Table 1). To control for possible effects of age, we repeated both analyses, restricting participants to the age range of 20–40 (Methods). The pairwise distance between student and online groups was still significantly smaller than that between non-student and non-online groups (students: P < 0.001; Cohen’s d = 1.66; difference in means, 0.069; 95% CI, (0.05, 0.08); online: P < 0.001; Cohen’s d = 2.78; difference in means, 0.081; 95% CI, (0.05, 0.1); via bootstrapping). So was the distance between the US student group and other student and online groups when compared with that between the US student group and non-student/non-online groups (students: P < 0.001; Cohen’s d = 3.33; mean difference, 0.058; 95% CI, (0.03, 0.09); online: P < 0.001; Cohen’s d = 1.88; mean difference, 0.055; 95% CI, (0.02, 0.1); via bootstrapping). In addition, we compared priors of younger (under 35) and older (over 35) online participants and found no significant differences in each of the three tested locations (via bootstrapped Jensen–Shannon divergence; US online group: P = 0.09; Cohen’s d = 0.66; mean difference in distance, 0.02; 95% CI, (−0.03, 0.06); India online group: P = 0.11; Cohen’s d = 1.4; mean difference in distance, −0.007; 95% CI, (−0.07, 0.05); Brazil online group: P = 0.4; Cohen’s d = 0.32; mean difference in distance, −0.002; 95% CI, (−0.09, 0.1)).\n\nThese findings suggest that certain lifestyle factors associated with student and online participants (plausibly including socio-economic status or access to global media and internet) involve exposure to globalized culture that is sufficient to produce mental representations of rhythm that are similar to those of US residents. As a consequence, student and online participants (the populations typically studied in psychology, neuroscience and music cognition37,41,47,48) underrepresent global variability in music perception37.\n\nCulture-specific variation can be linked to the music in a group\n\nWhat underlies the observed variation across groups? In principle, variation could be due to any of the many factors that varied across groups, including non-musical factors such as the rhythms prominent in spoken language or in environmental sounds. But in several cases, variation in rhythm priors had obvious links to rhythms prominent in local musical systems. For instance, the mode at the 2:2:3 rhythm was pronounced in groups that have this rhythm in their local musical tradition49,50,51: traditional musicians in Turkey, Botswana and Bulgaria (Fig. 7a,b). As shown in Fig. 7c, the weights assigned to the 2:2:3 rhythm in a Gaussian mixture model fit to the prior of each group were substantially higher in these groups than in most other groups (P = 0.003, via a one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Cohen’s d = 2.17; mean difference in weight, 0.011; 95% CI, (0.003, 0.02)). This result is consistent with previous developmental work showing differences in sensitivity to the 2:2:3 rhythm in US and Turkish adults52, but not infants53, suggesting that sensitivity to the rhythm may be lost without exposure.\n\nThe 3:3:2 rhythm can also be related to specific musical systems—in this case, those of African and Afro-diasporic music. In particular, it features prominently in many sub-Saharan musical styles54,55, is popular in Afro-Cuban and Latin music (where it is referred to as ‘tresillo’), and is characteristic of many Afro-diasporic traditions from Cuba, Brazil, Uruguay and North America56,57,58,59, among others (Fig. 7d,e). In the priors estimated from the experiment, the 3:3:2 mode was strongest in dancers from the Sagele village in Mali (Figs. 5b and 7e). We recorded a representative corpus of their musical repertoire and found that 46% of the excerpts recorded in the corpus featured a prominent 3:3:2 pattern (see Methods for additional details). We similarly found strong 3:3:2 weights in all other groups of musicians and dancers from African and Afro-diaspora traditions (musicians from Botswana, Mali, Uruguay and Brazil, and both US and UK jazz musicians; Fig. 7f; significantly higher weights for this mode when compared with the other participant groups, P < 0.001, via a one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Cohen’s d = 2.60; mean difference in weight, 0.043; 95% CI, (0.035, 0.051)).\n\nPerceptual modes can occur at moderately complex integer-ratio rhythms\n\nAnother example of an idiosyncratic feature that can be linked to a musical system is the mode at 7:2:3 evident in drummers in Mali (Fig. 7g). This rhythm is noteworthy because it is defined by a relatively complex integer ratio. We took several steps to establish that this rhythm is prominent in the local musical tradition (see ‘Analysis of specific modes’ in Methods). First, we observed that some participants recognized the rhythm during the experiment session. They identified it as ‘Maraka’, which is a popular local piece of dance music that uses a 7:2:3 rhythmic pattern (Fig. 7h). To validate this recognition of the rhythm in the musician groups we tested, we conducted post-experiment interviews after the end of the main experimental session with the help of an ethnographer team member (R.P.). We estimated the empirical modes of the distribution, synthesized stimuli corresponding to the mode near 7:2:3 and asked participants to identify it. The Malian drummer participants repeatedly identified the pattern as ‘Maraka’.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 7i, the 7:2:3 mode was stronger in the three groups from Mali than in all other groups (P = 0.005, via a one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test; d.f. = 37; Cohen’s d = 2.33; mean difference in weight, 0.0082; 95% CI, (0.007, 0.01)). This result suggests that even relatively complex rhythms can form perceptual categories but that they are strongly dependent on musical experience within cultural environments where the corresponding rhythm prevails.\n\nCulture-specific rhythm priors predict categorical perception\n\nTo test whether the rhythm ‘categories’ (modes) in the measured priors could predict perceptual categorization, we simulated categorization judgements with a Bayesian model based on a Gaussian mixture model fit to the estimated priors from each group (in which each mixture component corresponds to a rhythm category). We then compared the results to previously published categorization judgements by Western musicians of rhythms at different points within the rhythm triangle9. Because the category choices were defined by musical notation, this experiment was possible only in Western musicians. The results of the experiment can be expressed as a set of regions that are associated with each musically notated rhythm (Extended Data Fig. 7a). The categories predicted by priors measured in US participant groups generally provided good matches to the experimentally obtained category boundaries of Western musicians (Extended Data Fig. 7b, left). By contrast, the category boundaries for the non-Western groups we tested provided worse matches (Extended Data Fig. 7b, right). We quantitatively assessed the match between the categories predicted by a group’s prior and those measured in Western musicians via the average of the distances over all points in the triangle between the categories assigned by the model and the majority category in the Desain and Honing experiment (see ‘Category predictions from rhythm priors’ in Methods). As shown in Extended Data Fig. 7c, when evaluated in this way, both the non-Western non-musician groups and the non-Western musician and dancer groups that we tested produced significantly worse matches than the Western groups (here defined as student, Western musician and US groups) via Wilcoxon rank-sum tests (non-Western non-musicians: P = 0.021; Cohen’s d = 1.2; difference of mean distances, 0.01; 95% CI, (0.0035, 0.015); non-Western musician and dancer groups: P = 0.003; Cohen’s d = 1.2; difference of mean distances, 0.015; 95% CI, (0.0062, 0.023)). This result is consistent with the idea that the prior measured by our iterated tapping experiment reflects a perceptual representation and so can predict purely perceptual judgements. The result also shows that the cross-cultural variation in the measured priors has the expected consequences for perceptual category predictions (in this case, worse predictions of Western musicians’ categories for groups whose musical experience presumptively deviates substantially from that of Western musicians).\n\nMusicianship does not obviously alter rhythm priors\n\nWe previously found that rhythm priors were similar for musicians and non-musicians in Boston, USA26, suggesting that priors are driven by ‘passive’ exposure to music rather than explicit training or practice. We replicated this finding here in multiple other groups of musicians who play Western music and corresponding groups of non-musician students with exposure to Western music (in South Korea, Japan and the United States). In each case there was no significant difference between priors derived from splits of the data within and across groups, as evaluated by bootstrapping the Jensen–Shannon divergence using the procedure described in the Methods section ‘Significant distance between two groups’ (South Korea: P = 0.17; Cohen’s d = 1.1; mean difference between across- and within-group distance, 0.03; 95% CI, (−0.01, 0.07); Japan: P = 0.051; Cohen’s d = 1.1; mean difference between across- and within-group distance, 0.03; 95% CI, (−0.02, 0.08); United States: P = 0.56; Cohen’s d = 0.64; mean difference between across- and within-group distance, 0.02; 95% CI, (−0.03, 0.07)). For the sake of brevity, here and elsewhere we classify and refer to participants as ‘musicians’ or ‘non-musicians’ (Methods), cognizant that the Western concept of musicianship may not fully apply to other societies and that there can be a continuum of levels of participation in musical activities. We nonetheless found that years of self-reported musical experience differed between groups classified as ‘musicians’ or ‘non-musicians’ (Extended Data Fig. 8a); pairwise comparisons between musician and non-musician groups in the same country were statistically significant in all cases (Extended Data Fig. 8b; P < 0.001 in all cases via one-sided Wilcoxon tests; Cohen’s d ranged between 1.65 and 4.27; the difference between median years of experience ranged from 6 to 37 years).\n\nWe did find multiple cases where musicians and non-musicians in the same country exhibited distinct priors, but these all seem explainable by differences in musical exposure. Specifically, local musician groups in Mali and Uruguay differed from other groups in those countries (again assessed using bootstrapped Jensen–Shannon divergence, comparing across- and within-group distance; MA-LM versus MA-DA: P = 0.002; Cohen’s d = 1.8; mean difference in distance, 0.04; 95% CI, (0.0006, 0.07); MA-LM versus MA-ST: P = 0.018; Cohen’s d = 2.6; mean difference in distance, 0.07; 95% CI, (0.02, 0.1); UY-LM versus UY-ST: P = 0.036; Cohen’s d = 2.3; mean difference in distance, 0.06; 95% CI, (0.01, 0.1)), presumably because they have internalized different types of music in the cultural milieu of the tradition they specialize in (Fig. 6b,c,e,f). We thus have no reason to suppose that musicianship per se qualitatively alters mental representations of rhythm. The signature properties of discrete modes at small-integer ratios are clearly evident in both musicians and non-musicians.\n\nMusicianship improves tapping precision\n\nStrong effects of musicianship were, by contrast, evident in the variability of tapped reproductions, standardly used as a measure of tapping precision3 (Fig. 8a). We compared tapping variability (quantified as the standard deviation of the asynchrony between stimulus and response3) between 21 pairs of musician and non-musician groups in the same country. Tapping variability was lower in musicians than in non-musicians (Fig. 8b) in 20 of the 21 pairs (P < 0.001 via a binomial test). This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05) in 15 of the 21 individual pairs via one-sided Wilcoxon tests. For these 15 pairs, Cohen’s d ranged between 1.08 and 2.36; the difference in median variability ranged between 5.41 ms and 23.69 ms. These results are consistent with a large literature in Western musicians showing perceptual and production advantages in musical tasks60,61,62,63, including tapping to a beat3, but they provide evidence that these musicianship advantages are present cross-culturally. The results support a distinction between musicians and non-musicians that extends beyond North America and Western Europe27,64. Despite these musicianship effects, we saw that every participant group exhibited a tendency to tap slightly before the beat, quantified as a negative mean stimulus–response asynchrony (Fig. 8c)3,65. This negative mean asynchrony has long been noted as a feature of tapping in Western participants3; our responses suggest that it is present across cultures.\n\nNo evidence that language influences rhythm priors\n\nIt is natural to wonder whether the prior on rhythm might be influenced by experiential factors outside of music, most obviously spoken language. Speech has been argued to influence rhythm perception66,67,68, but most recent evidence indicates segregation of speech and music analysis in the brain69. Several findings from our study suggest that language does not strongly influence rhythm representations.\n\nFirst, we observed clear examples of groups who speak the same language but whose rhythm priors were quite different. The clearest example is the three groups in Mali (local musicians, dancers and students). All three groups speak a nearly identical set of languages but have obviously distinct rhythm priors (via bootstrapped Jensen–Shannon divergence; MA-LM and MA-ST: P = 0.012; Cohen’s d = 2.6; mean difference between across- and within-group distance, 0.07; 95% CI, (0.02, 0.1); MA-LM and MA-DA: P = 0.009; Cohen’s d = 1.8; mean difference in distance, 0.04; 95% CI, (0.0006, 0.07); MA-ST and MA-DA: P < 0.001; Cohen’s d = 4.5; mean difference in distance, 0.1; 95% CI, (0.08, 0.2)). Specifically, both the local musicians and dancers in Mali had significantly higher weights on the 3:3:2 rhythms than did Malian students (via bootstrapped Gaussian mixture model fits as described in the Methods section ‘Category weight for the 3:3:2 rhythm’; MA-ST and MA-LM: P = 0.003; Cohen’s d = 5.3; mean weight difference, 0.064; 95% CI, (0.039, 0.087); MA-ST and MA-DA: P < 0.001; Cohen’s d = 6.7; mean weight difference, 0.087; 95% CI, (0.061, 0.11); see Extended Data Fig. 9a for the category weights). We found a similar result for comparisons of students and local musicians in Uruguay (distinct rhythm priors as evaluated by bootstrapped Jensen–Shannon divergence; P = 0.013; Cohen’s d = 2.2; mean difference in distance, 0.06; 95% CI, (0.01, 0.1); the weight on the 3:3:2 rhythm again differed between groups, P < 0.001; Cohen’s d = 3.1; mean weight difference, 0.04; 95% CI, (0.014, 0.065); see Extended Data Fig. 9b for the category weights). An analogous result was evident in Turkey, where local musicians had significantly higher weights on the 2:2:3 rhythm, which is associated with Balkan and Turkish music, compared with Turkish students (Extended Data Fig. 9c; P = 0.001; Cohen’s d = 3; mean weight difference, 0.02; 95% CI, (0.0071, 0.033); the priors themselves were also again significantly different as evaluated by bootstrapped Jensen–Shannon divergence; P = 0.02; Cohen’s d = 1.3; mean difference in distance, 0.02; 95% CI, (−0.008, 0.05)).\n\nSecond, we observed several examples of similar rhythm priors despite distinct spoken language experience. Both university students and Western-trained musicians in Japan and South Korea exhibited priors that were not obviously different from those of US participants (Extended Data Fig. 9d–f; no significant difference in either case as evaluated by bootstrapped Jensen–Shannon divergence: Japanese students and US students: P = 0.77; Cohen’s d = 0.47; mean difference in distance, 0.01; 95% CI, (−0.03, 0.05); Japanese Western musicians and US Western musicians: P = 0.11; Cohen’s d = 1.1; mean difference in distance, 0.02; 95% CI, (−0.02, 0.06); South Korean students and US students: P = 0.25; Cohen’s d = 1.3; mean difference in distance, 0.04; 95% CI, (−0.01, 0.1); South Korean Western musicians and US musicians: P = 0.44; Cohen’s d = 0.92; mean difference in distance, 0.02; 95% CI, (−0.02, 0.07)). Although the student groups in these countries undoubtedly had some exposure to English, it was not their native language. We cannot exclude the possibility that language could in some cases have some influence on rhythm representations, but our study provides no evidence for such influences.\n\nProcedure\n\nInformed consent\n\nAll participants provided informed consent in accordance with the Ethics Council of the Max Planck Society (protocols 2017_12 and 2020_11), the Columbia University Institutional Review Board (protocol IRB-AAAR3726), the University of Western Ontario Health Science Research Ethics Board (protocol 108477), the KAIST Institutional Review Board (protocol IRB-KH2017-15), Durham University (Music Department Ethics Committee, February 2018), the Bogazici University Social Sciences Human Research Ethics Committee (protocol SBB-EAK 2017/1) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Committee on the Use of Humans as Experimental Subjects (protocol 1209005242R006). All participants received compensation for their involvement, the amount of which was consistent with the minimum wage regulations of their respective countries. We obtained verbal consent to publish images of participants and musicians.\n\nOverview of procedure\n\nThe experiment measured iterated reproduction (sometimes referred to as serial reproduction or iterated learning38,39) of rhythms. The participants were instructed to synchronize their finger tapping to a repeating auditory stimulus presented over headphones. In previous work26 we found that synchronization to an ongoing rhythm produced similar results to an alternative task in which participants heard a pattern and then tapped a reproduction from memory. However, we found empirically that synchronization was easier to explain to participants and for this reason opted to use it for this cross-cultural study. They first completed a short training session (about 10 minutes long) familiarizing them with the apparatus and task (described below). The main experiment consisted of a series of trials, each of which contained five iterations.\n\nOn each trial we sampled a random seed uniformly from the triangular rhythm space, corresponding to a three-interval rhythm (s1, s2, s3). We then generated a sequence of clicks from the seed by repeating the three-interval seed pattern ten times. After a few clicks (typically a bit more than one cycle), participants began to synchronize to the click sequence (‘paced’ tapping). A MATLAB script (MATLAB 2018a) extracted response onsets from an audio recording of the participant’s taps (see ‘Onset extraction’ below). We averaged the inter-response intervals across the ten repetitions, obtaining an average three-interval response (r1, r2, r3). Taps were not always detected at every stimulus onset, both because participants sometimes failed to produce a tap in response to a stimulus click, and because produced taps were not detected with 100% reliability. We thus allowed some missing taps within each repeated three-interval pattern but required there to be ‘enough’ taps to estimate an average response. Specifically, we required that each of the three stimulus onsets within the pattern be associated with a tap onset in at least three of the ten repetitions. To obtain the average response, we replaced missing taps with the corresponding average onset time for the taps that were detected. We further required that the response (r1, r2, r3) was not situated far beyond the region we defined for human-producible rhythms (defined as not containing an interval shorter than 285 ms).\n\nIf the iteration satisfied these two criteria, we set the seed pattern for the subsequent iteration to the response pattern: (s1, s2, s3) ← (r1, r2, r3). If the iteration was invalid, the data from that iteration were omitted from analysis and the seed remained unchanged. We repeated this process five times. If there were three invalid iterations within a trial, the trial was stopped, and a new trial with a new seed was started (such failed trials typically were due to a rhythm being too difficult for a participant to reproduce, and this procedure was intended to minimize a participant’s frustration). For trials with two or fewer invalid iterations, the nth iteration was analysed as the nth iteration even if the iteration that preceded it was invalid. There was a fixed interval of approximately 4 s between iterations within a trial and a fixed interval of approximately 9 s between trials (both varied by up to 200 ms in either direction due to slight variation in computer systems across sites).\n\nThe number of trials that could be run in an experimental session varied depending on the location and is reported in Supplementary Table 2. In 13 locations we also performed an additional experiment with a faster tempo (a pattern duration of 1,000 ms). This additional experiment was always performed after the main experiment (with a pattern duration of 2,000 ms). The demographic information for this experiment is provided in Supplementary Tables 1 and 3.\n\nApparatus\n\nData were collected with between one and four computerized stations for each testing location. Each station included a computer, a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 USB sound card, two sets of Sennheiser HD 280 Pro headphones and a tapping sensor (Fig. 2). This design is identical to that reported in the paper by Jacoby and McDermott that introduced the experiment paradigm26. Each sensor contained a microphone embedded in sound isolation materials and covered with a soft cloth to muffle impact sounds as much as possible. Instructions for constructing the sensor are provided in the supplementary Open Science Framework (OSF) repository. The microphone in each sensor was highly sensitive, and light touches generated bursts of noise that were recorded by the microphone. The sound card simultaneously recorded the microphone output and the audio stimulus played out by the participant’s headphones, so that the latency of the response recording relative to the stimulus was nearly eliminated (less than 1 ms). The specification of the hardware and instructions for building the sensor are provided in the OSF repository associated with this paper (see ‘Data availability’).\n\nStimuli\n\nThe stimulus on each trial was a rhythmic pattern composed of short percussive sounds (bursts of white noise) 65 ms long with an attack time of 5 ms (linear ramp) and decaying gradually over the remaining 60 ms, with the envelope hand-designed to mimic common percussion instruments (the decay amplitude decreased exponentially to 10% of the maximum over the first 55 ms, then decayed exponentially at a faster rate in the next 5 ms and was then truncated). These patterns contained ten repetitions of a particular three-interval rhythm. The stimuli were identical to those used in Jacoby and McDermott26. Software to replicate the experiment and sound material can be found in the OSF repository associated with this paper (see ‘Data availability’).\n\nThree-interval rhythms\n\nEach stimulus was defined by a pattern of three intervals (s1, s2, s3) constrained such that the overall pattern duration was 2,000 ms: s = s1 + s2 + s3 = 2,000. In addition, to avoid rhythms that were too fast for humans to reproduce, we constrained the initial seeds so that the smallest interval was larger than 300 ms (s1, s2, s3 > 300). We then repeated the interval pattern ten times, thereby forming a sequence of 30 intervals {S}1≤i≤30 = (s1, s2, s3, s1, s2, s3, s1, …, s3). From this sequence, we created a sequence of 31 onsets ({O}0≤t≤30) with intervals corresponding to S. The 31 onsets (‘clicks’) were defined with respect to the initial onset \\({O}_{0},{O}_{t}={O}_{0}+{\\sum }_{1\\le i\\le t}{s}_{i}\\) for 1 ≤ t ≤ 30.\n\nProjection to the rhythm triangle\n\nWe mapped a three-interval rhythm with inter-onset intervals (s1, s2, s3) to a point in a triangular rhythm space spanning all linear combinations of three extremal rhythms: \\(\\frac{{s}_{1}}{s}\\,{\\vec{P}}_{1}+\\frac{{s}_{2}}{s}{\\vec{P}}_{2}+\\frac{{s}_{3}}{s}{\\vec{P}}_{3}\\), where s = s1 + s2 + s3, and where \\({\\vec{P}}_{i}\\) are the vertices of the triangle (a simplex) (Fig. 1b; see also refs. 9,26). For visualization, we used an equilateral triangle, with \\({\\vec{P}}_{1}=\\left(\\mathrm{0,0}\\right),{\\vec{{P}}}_{2}=\\left(\\mathrm{1,0}\\right),{\\vec{P}}_{3}=\\left({\\frac{1}{2}},{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}\\right)\\). Note that since the initial seed intervals satisfied the constraint that (s1, s2, s3) > 300 ms, the initial seeds were located within an inner triangular region with vertices \\(\\left(\\,\\frac{3}{2}{f},\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}{f}\\,\\right),\\) \\(\\left(1-\\frac{3}{2}{f},\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}{f}\\;\\right),\\left(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(1-2f)\\;\\right)\\), where f = 300/2,000 = 0.15 (Fig. 1b, inner region).\n\nOnset extraction\n\nWe processed the microphone recording from each trial in non-overlapping windows of 15 s, detecting all samples exceeding a relative threshold of 1.45% of the maximal power of the recorded waveform in the window. This threshold was slightly more sensitive than the 2.25% threshold used in Jacoby and McDermott26; this change was made to accommodate a small number of participants (less than 3%) who tended to produce very light taps. In most cases, onsets were detected with minimal errors (as evaluated by comparing the detected onsets to what was audible from listening to example trials). We nevertheless took several steps to ensure that the detected onsets corresponded to actual taps. First, we discarded onsets that were too close to one another (less than 80 ms apart), as humans generally cannot produce two taps in such close proximity (see Repp3 for a justification of this threshold). Second, we discarded responses that were too far from any stimulus click, regarding them as errors. Here we took into account an important characteristic of human tapping known as ‘negative mean asynchrony’—namely, that tapping in time to a beat tends to be biased compared with the beat onset (typically occurring before the beat)3. We first matched each onset to its closest stimulus click and computed the mean asynchrony m as the average difference between a response and its corresponding stimulus click. We then excluded all events such that |(OR − m) − OS| > 150 ms where OS and OR are the stimulus and response onsets, respectively (namely, a window of 300 ms centred around the perceptual centre defined by the mean asynchrony) from further analysis. In addition, for the analysis, we included only points inside the triangle (see below). This resulted in 99,189 of 2,418,284 tapped responses being excluded from the main experiment (4.1%).\n\nApart from the change in the detection threshold mentioned above, this procedure was identical to the one reported by Jacoby and McDermott26. The code for the procedure is provided in the OSF repository associated with this project.\n\nProcedure for the experimental session\n\nThe participants were asked to position the sensor in a comfortable way (see the OSF repository for the full instructions). In most cases, participants preferred to sit on a chair, positioning the sensor on their lap and using their entire hand or one finger for tapping. However, we allowed for different postures in different groups. For example, some participants in Mali preferred to sit on the floor with their legs stretched out in front of them. In all cases, the participants were encouraged to change posture or switch hands if they were fatigued; however, they were not permitted to tap with two hands simultaneously or to tap with two alternating fingers. In cases where participants nevertheless tried to do so, the experimenter would stop the experiment and repeat the instructions. The experiment was conducted using a fixed set of steps:\n\n(1)\n\nThe first step of the experiment was to ask the participant to tap ‘a steady beat’ at any tempo that they liked. The idea of this task was to familiarize the participant with the sensor, as well as to characterize the spontaneous motor tempo of the participants103. This task was generally easy for participants, but the concept of ‘steady beat’ varied slightly across participant groups. For some participants in Mali and Uruguay, a ‘steady beat’ was a non-isochronous rhythmic pattern rather than an isochronous beat. In cases where participants continued to tap a rhythmic pattern rather than an isochronous beat, the experimenter repeated the instruction. In some cases, participants did not change their behaviour according to the repeated instructions and continued to tap a non-isochronous pattern; in these cases, we did not stop the experiment again and instead proceeded to the next step and recorded their performance as is.\n\n(2)\n\nThe participants were then asked to ‘tap faster’.\n\n(3)\n\nNext, the participants were instructed to tap ‘as fast as they can’ for a couple of seconds. This step aimed to test that the participant did not have any severe motor constraint that would limit them in performing the task. After the participant tapped for about 3–6 s, the experimenter thanked the participant and stopped their tapping to avoid fatigue.\n\n(4)\n\nThe next step was to familiarize the participant with the stimulus. The experimenter played a few isochronous clicks with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of 800 ms over the headphones and asked the participant to report if the sound was too loud or too soft. The level of the sound was then adjusted until the participant felt that the sound was at a comfortable level.\n\n(5)\n\nThe participants were then instructed to tap along to an isochronous beat (with an ISI of 800 ms). This step could be repeated multiple times until the experimenter felt that the participant understood the task and was able to provide a synchronized response. Note that this was not easy for all participants—for example, some participants naturally tapped in antiphase (‘off-beat’; halfway in between the beat). In case of difficulties, the experimenter would first check that this was not caused by the participant’s posture, in which case the experimenter would suggest that the participant change their position to enable easier tapping. In other cases, the experimenter would demonstrate synchronous tapping to the participant. These additional steps allowed nearly all participants to successfully perform isochronous synchronous tapping. The rare participants who could not successfully perform isochronous tapping in this setting did not continue to the main experiment.\n\n(6)\n\nWe then performed an isochronous tapping task at the same rate as in the familiarization phase (ISI = 800 ms) in which the participants tapped to a sequence of 56 clicks lasting 44 s.\n\n(7)\n\nWe next performed an additional isochronous tapping task at a faster rate (ISI = 600 ms) with 75 clicks lasting 45 s.\n\n(8)\n\nFinally, we performed a tempo-changing tapping task in which the ISI alternated between 546 and 654 ms every 8–13 clicks (chosen pseudorandomly), with a total of 74 clicks lasting 45 s (the exact tapping sequence, identical for all participants, can be found in the OSF repository).\n\n(9)\n\nIn the next step of the experiment, the participants were told that they would now tap a rhythm. The experimenter emphasized that, as before, the participant needed to ‘tap once for every click that they hear’. The participants were given five trials of random three-interval rhythms (each with five iterations) to get them familiarized with the task. The experimenter provided feedback to the participant only if they were performing the task in a qualitatively incorrect way, such as tapping on the off-beats or omitting a beat.\n\n(10)\n\nThe participants performed 10–30 trials (mean, 22.0; s.d., 6.6) of the tapping experiment (each containing five iterations, where each iteration contained ten repetitions of the three-interval pattern, as described above). Due to the long duration, the participants were informed that they could ask for a short break at any time, and the experimenter included additional breaks at various times during the experiment.\n\n(11)\n\nThe participants answered a set of demographic questions (see the OSF repository for the full list) during one of the breaks and/or at the beginning or end of the experiment.\n\n(12)\n\nIn some locations, we performed an additional experiment after the completion of the main experiment, in which we repeated the main experiment with an overall pattern duration of 1,000 ms.\n\nProcedures for replicability across sites\n\nTesting stations were created by local research team members according to a set of specifications (see the OSF repository) or created according to the same specifications by N.J. and sent to teams in different locations. A written procedure describing the process of hardware preparation, software installation, task instruction and participant training was delivered to each group (see the OSF repository for the details). The task instructions were translated into local languages. The experimenters were either highly fluent in the local language or accompanied by a translator who was a native speaker. In most locations, the data collection team included an anthropologist or an ethnomusicologist with an expert understanding of the local culture, social groups and music. To ensure that the same procedures were used across sites, all teams were walked through the procedures by N.J., either directly or via video conferencing. Pilot data were collected and analysed at each site, and N.J. inspected the quality of the data before the collection of additional data. To assist this process, the MATLAB script generated images with a small file size (about 150 KB) that summarized the main statistics of data collection (the validity of the trial, the mean and standard deviation of tapping asynchrony (indicative of tapping accuracy) and plots showing the microphone recording levels). The same script also generated small binary files (about 4 KB) with summaries of the data (onset times for stimuli and responses). These files were sent to N.J. via low-bandwidth internet from remote data collection sites, which assisted in troubleshooting technical and data collection errors.\n\nTesting conditions\n\nExperiments in the United States (Boston and New York City) were run in sound-attenuating booths. Elsewhere, where possible, the experiments were run indoors in rooms without other activities (Brazil, Uruguay, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Bulgaria, Turkey, the Bamako site in Mali, India, South Korea and Japan). When run outdoors, the experimenter chose a location away from community activities that was relatively free of distractions and noise (Bolivia, the Sagele site in Mali, Botswana, Namibia and China).\n\nDemographic questionnaires\n\nWe employed a demographic questionnaire to characterize musical experience, dance experience and basic demographic information (age, gender, education and spoken languages). We used a baseline demographic questionnaire (see the OSF repository) that was translated and adapted to different languages and participant groups by the researchers. There was some customization of the questions based on their relevance to the local culture. In each location, we consulted with ethnographers and translators regarding the relevance and translations of each demographic item.\n\nOnline measurement of tapped responses\n\nTo run the experiment online, we used REPP104, a software package for measuring sensorimotor synchronization in online experiments that works efficiently using hardware and software available to most online participants. To achieve temporal accuracy superior to that obtained by a web browser (which would have been inadequate for our experiment105,106), the software plays the audio stimulus through the participant’s laptop speakers and records the original signal simultaneously with the participant’s responses (which they supply by tapping on the laptop case) using the built-in laptop microphone. The resulting recording is then analysed to extract the participant’s taps. The method has been validated in a series of calibration and behavioural experiments104, and it achieves high temporal accuracy (latency and jitter within 2 ms on average). In addition, the method has been shown to provide results that are consistent with those obtained in a laboratory set-up (for example, for isochronous tapping, the lab–online correlation for the tapping precision of individual participants was measured to be r19 = 0.94; P < 0.001; 95% CI, (0.85, 0.98); see Experiment 2 in ref. 104).\n\nTo measure stimulus-coordinated tapping by online participants, we made some modifications to the original paradigm. One set of differences involved the stimulus. First, because the recorded audio contains both the stimulus and the response, we filtered the stimulus with a high-pass filter (cut-off frequency of 1,000 Hz) to avoid overlap with the frequency range typically occupied by tapping responses (80–500 Hz). Next, we added three custom audio ‘markers’ with known temporal locations at the beginning and end of each stimulus (six in total). These markers enabled us to unambiguously identify the positions of the stimulus onsets in the recorded audio and facilitated precise measurement of participants’ asynchronies. The markers were designed to be robustly detected across a variety of hardware and software set-ups, including cases of noise-cancellation technologies and ambient room noise. The marker sounds were generated from 15 ms bursts of bandpass-filtered white noise in the range of 200–340 Hz, to which we applied linear ramps at the onset and offset (2 ms long). We chose very short intervals between the markers (280 ms for the first interval and 230 ms for the second) to avoid participants confusing the markers with the repeated rhythm (the rhythm pulses and the markers also differed substantially in timbre due to the different frequency ranges).\n\nA second set of differences involved the response recording. The online experiments used free-field recording whereby the audio stimulus is played through the laptop speakers and simultaneously recorded along with the participant’s tapping response using the built-in laptop microphone. This returns an audio file where both the audio stimulus and participant tapping are superimposed. To separate this recording into the different components of the stimulus and response, we used bandpass filters. Since most of the energy in the tapping signal occurs at low frequencies, filtering the recording around the tapping range (80–500 Hz) isolated the tapping response with a high degree of efficacy. We were also able to isolate the markers by filtering in their frequency range (200–340 Hz). In addition, we applied a filter in the 100–170 Hz range, the output of which was used for calibration. Because the markers had no energy in this range, this helped determine the noise level in the recording, which we used to adaptively set the marker detection thresholds. This allowed us to reliably estimate the marker locations even with very noisy or low-quality recordings, as characterize some laptop models and brands.\n\nThe detected stimulus markers were used to estimate and compensate for the latency of the recording and to estimate the jitter in the recording. This enabled us to monitor the timing accuracy of each individual trial, crucial to ensuring that timing accuracy remained high in all trials. See Experiment 1 in Anglada-Tort et al.104 for the full details of the calibration experiments and their validation.\n\nAfter the online-specific pre-processing to isolate the tapped response and compensate for the recording latency, we used the same pipeline as in the main experiment to align the tap onsets and perform the tapping analysis.\n\nOnline iterated reproduction procedure\n\nTo meet the challenges of online data collection, such as poor control over participants’ hardware and software and a higher risk of fraudulent responders, we made two minor changes to the iterated reproduction procedure.\n\n(1)\n\nIn the online version of the experiment, the analysis of the recording could take a few seconds to complete (for example, from uploading the audio recording, performing the signal processing and synthesizing the new stimulus). To avoid unnecessary wait times, we did not run consecutive iterated reproductions of the same rhythm seed, as in the laboratory. Instead, we ran six ‘chains’ of iterated reproductions in parallel. On each trial of the online experiment, the participants performed a single iteration of a chain (that is, tapping to a single ten-repetition rhythm—either a seed rhythm or the result of the reproduction from the preceding iteration of the chain). Each trial was randomly assigned to one of the chains that was not used for the previous trial. Each participant completed all six chains during an experimental block. In Jacoby and McDermott (Experiment 4)26, we showed that the results of this parallel chain procedure do not differ substantially from those of the original paradigm, where the iterations from different chains are not intermixed.\n\n(2)\n\nThe change in trial order also necessitated a change in the failing criteria: if participants failed a trial, they repeated the trial with a maximum of ten possible additional attempts, but these repeated trials were randomly drawn from the six chains (the ten allowed failed trials were tallied globally within the block). In those cases where this limit was exceeded, the experiment was terminated.\n\nIn addition, the following seven modifications were made to the overall procedure to ensure that the online participants met the technical requirements for the online experiment and were able to provide good tapping data consistently throughout the experiment. The different steps in this procedure have been extensively piloted and optimized to ensure high data quality when collecting tapping data in online settings104.\n\n(1)\n\nFirst, the participants were instructed that the experiment could only be performed using the laptop speakers and that they should unplug any headphones/earphones or disconnect any wireless devices. They were also instructed to remain in a quiet environment.\n\n(2)\n\nThe participants were then asked to set the volume of their speakers to a level that was sufficiently high to be detected by the microphone. A sound meter was used to visually indicate when the level was appropriate.\n\n(3)\n\nAfter the volume test, the participants completed a short recording test to detect hardware and software that did not meet the technical requirements of the experiment, such as malfunctioning speakers or microphones. The recording test played a test stimulus with six marker sounds. The markers were recorded with the laptop’s microphone and analysed using our signal processing pipeline. During the playback, the participants were supposed to remain silent. There were a total of three such test recording trials, and we provided feedback after the first trial based on the recording quality: if the markers were not recorded (for example, this could occur if the participant forgot to unplug their headphones), we reminded the participants that they needed to unplug any headphones. If, despite these reminders, marker sounds could not be detected in two of the three trials, the participant was excluded from the experiment. Note that this process also serves as a basic test of task compliance, as the participants must follow the instructions (for example, accept the enabling of the microphone in the browser, unplug any headphones or wireless devices and adjust the volume of the computer) to pass the test. Participants who did not satisfy the technical conditions or who abandoned the experiment at this stage were excluded (747 of 1,303). This relatively high percentage of participants that did not satisfy the technical inclusion criteria is consistent with previous online tapping experiments104.\n\n(4)\n\nParticipants who passed the recording test were then directed to a tapping calibration test. Here, the participants were asked to tap on the surface of their laptops with their index finger to test whether the microphone could detect their taps, using a sound meter to visually provide feedback. In cases where the signal was too low, the participants were asked to tap on different locations of the laptop or to try to tap harder.\n\n(5)\n\nNext, the participants performed a practice phase to acquaint themselves with the main tapping task. The practice phase consisted of four trials using the stimulus sampling procedure of the main experiment (for example, three-interval rhythms randomly sampled from the triangular simplex with a fixed duration of 2,000 ms and repeated ten times). In the first two trials, we provided feedback to the participants based on their recording quality and tapping performance. We used the remaining two trials to exclude participants who were still unable to provide good tapping data, as assessed by failing in one or more of these two trials. A trial was considered a failure if we could not detect all marker sounds, or if the detected markers were displaced relative to each other by more than 15 ms, or if the percentage of detected taps (that is, the number of detected tapping onsets out of the total number of stimulus onsets) was less than 50% or more than 200%. Note that none of these criteria involve participants’ accuracy in replicating the target rhythm; they only reflect whether the signal could be correctly recorded and processed, and whether the participants produced a minimally/maximally acceptable number of tapping responses. An additional 358 participants were excluded on this basis.\n\n(6)\n\nParticipants who passed the practice phase were then able to start the main tapping task, which used the same procedure described for the in-person experiments except for the modifications mentioned above.\n\n(7)\n\nAs mentioned above, a main difference between the in-person and online experiments was that the latter consisted of shorter and more flexible experimental sessions. Namely, the experiment was divided in different blocks of six chains per block. After completing one block, the participants could decide whether to continue with the next block or to instead end the experiment. There was a maximum of three blocks per session (18 chains). The motivation behind this design choice was to keep online experimental sessions engaging and short, always allowing the participants to decide whether to complete more trials or not.\n\nAfter completing the first block, the participants answered the same set of demographic questions used in the in-person experiments. We excluded participants who abandoned the experiment prior to its completion or who did not complete the full demographic questionnaire that we administered at the end of the experiment (67 additional participants were excluded on this basis). In total, 131 online participants completed the full experiment and were analysed.\n\nParticipants\n\nWe tested 39 participant groups spanning five continents and 15 countries (Extended Data Table 1). Overall, we recruited 923 participants (792 were run face-to-face and 131 online) who completed a total of 20,287 trials (seeds) and 2,319,095 individual taps.\n\nCriteria for group selection\n\nParticipant groups were chosen to provide a strong test of any potentially universal features of the results. We included groups from both industrialized and non-industrialized societies, as well as groups of local musicians from some non-Western societies (who performed different types of non-Western music). We also tested groups of musicians and dancers where possible, as these populations would be expected to have substantial exposure to particular musical styles. In addition, we tested university students in a number of countries to assess potential effects of exposure to Western culture, which we presumed would be correlated with university attendance. The groups tested were also determined in part by practical constraints (testing time and access to particular populations). Age and gender could not be fully equalized across groups. For example, Malian professional jembe drummers and Uruguayan candombe drummers (the populations recruited for MA-LM and UY-LM) are both relatively small groups—less than 50 individuals—composed of highly skilled professionals, and were predominantly male. In both cases, only one participant in each group was female. The substantial experience required for membership in these groups also resulted in these participants being older (Mali: mean age, 40.5 years; s.d., 11.9; Uruguay: mean age, 45.5 years; s.d., 12.8). At the other extreme, dancers in the Sagele village in Mali (MA-DA) were predominantly female.\n\nSample sizes\n\nWe conducted a power analysis using data from US participants collected for a previous publication26. The approach was to try to collect enough trials that the test–retest reliability of the estimated prior for a group was likely to be relatively high (with the goal of having enough data that the results of the experiment would be similar in a hypothetical future replication). The test–retest reliability was estimated using the split-half reliability of our previously collected data following Spearman–Brown correction107. We simulated different amounts of data by subsampling the number of trials used to estimate the prior (resampling without replacement). We found that 250 trials produced a test–retest reliability greater than 0.8, and we thus targeted this number for the sample size of each group. In practice, we often ran more trials if circumstances permitted (between 261 and 948 trials and therefore up to 3.8× the target number of trials; Supplementary Table 2). The only exceptions were the two groups in Botswana, for whom we did not reach this recruitment target because of practical constraints on testing time (170 and 127 trials for the San and Etsha groups, respectively; abbreviated as BO.SA and BO.EA). However, the post hoc reliability of the data collected for these groups was not far below our target value (0.75 and 0.67 for BO.SA and BO.EA, respectively). The post hoc reliabilities of all other groups were high, meeting or exceeding the predicted value of 0.8 (ranging from 0.8 to 0.96; mean, 0.9; s.d., 0.03).\n\nDefinition of group types\n\nStudents (ST)\n\nWe defined students as members of local universities in either undergraduate or graduate programmes.\n\nMusicians (WM and LM)\n\nFor brevity, we used the term ‘musicians’ to describe participants with relatively extensive musical experience, acknowledging that musicianship is a concept that changes from place to place47. On the basis of previous work, we defined recruiting criteria that generalize more broadly for different cultural contexts27: (1) professionalism—‘Do you make most or part of your living from music, or did you in the past?’, (2) training—‘Did you undergo music training (such as an apprenticeship or formal study)?’ and (3) public playing—‘Do you perform in public?’ In some locations (the United States, Uruguay, the United Kingdom, Bulgaria, Turkey, Mali and Namibia), all musicians satisfied all criteria, while in other locations (Brazil, Sweden, Botswana, India, Korea and Japan), we also included people who satisfied the last two criteria but not the first one. For all participants, we recorded self-reported years of regularly playing an instrument or singing, as is common in music cognition literature (Supplementary Table 2). We recruited both musicians who play Western classical music (WM) and musicians who play a local musical style that is not Western classical music (LM). We note that for the local musician groups, the nature of the local musical style varied somewhat from group to group; in some cases (most notably for the US.NY-LM group, who played jazz) the musical style was one that had spread globally.\n\nDancers (DA)\n\nIn Bulgaria, we recruited dancers who were members of the same professional ensembles from which we recruited the musician groups. In Mali, we recruited group members of a local recreational dance association that promotes events featuring traditional dance and music.\n\nNon-musicians (NM)\n\nNon-musicians were people who did not satisfy any of the inclusion criteria for the other groups. Their self-reported years of musical experience were substantially less than those of the musician groups in all cases (Supplementary Table 2).\n\nOnline (OL)\n\nOnline participants were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Their geographical location was determined by the Amazon qualification system and verified with IP geo-location. We tested participants from the 3 countries of the 15 from which the other participant groups were drawn with substantial Mechanical Turk worker pools (the United States, Brazil and India)108.\n\nRecruiting locations\n\nBasic demographic information for each participant group is provided in Extended Data Table 1. Supplementary Table 2 provides additional information about each group including the number of languages spoken, the languages spoken, years of self-reported musical experience, instruments played and favourite artists or musical genres. We report demographic variables that we were able to reliably measure, and we note that these are not the only variables that varied across groups and that might influence the results. These factors were all based on self-report questionnaires, except the literacy level within the group, which was estimated by the experimenters. Here we provide additional information about each group, ordered according to their geographical location.\n\nUnited States: Boston—students and Western classical musicians (US.BO-ST and US.BO-WM)\n\nThe Boston student participants were students from local universities, recruited using the MIT Brain and Cognitive Sciences Department participant mailing list and through additional online advertisement. All participants were residents of the Boston area, a metropolitan region of New England with over eight million inhabitants. The musician group was recruited from the same departmental mailing list as well as via a social media ad targeting conservatory students from the Boston area. All participants in this musician group had formal training in music. Some of them were professional musicians. Most participants in the musician group played Western classical music, though some also played other styles such as pop and jazz. There was some overlap between these groups and the US participant group in a previous publication26; the groups were not identical due to different exclusion criteria in the two studies.\n\nUnited States: New York City—non-musicians, Western classical musicians and jazz musicians (US.NY-NM, US.NY-WM and US.NY-LM)\n\nNew York participants were recruited by word of mouth, campus advertisements at Columbia University and online advertisements. The participants were residents of the New York City metropolitan area, a densely populated region in the United States with over 18.8 million people. We recruited three groups: non-musicians, musicians specializing in Western classical music (the WM group) and jazz musicians (the LM group). Both musician groups were a mix of music students and professional musicians. All musicians had formal education and training in music.\n\nBolivia: Tsimane’—non-musicians (BO.TS-NM)\n\nTsimane’ are an Indigenous people of lowland Bolivia, comprising about 19,000 individuals who live in about 130 small villages mostly along river basins (including the Maniqui River), located in the department of Beni (a subdivision of Bolivia). They subsist mostly on farming, fishing and hunting. Tsimane’ have traditional music, familiarity with which varies across individuals. As reported by Riester109, their traditional songs have characteristic rhythmic patterns. The most common such pattern reported by Riester can be written in ratios as 1:1:2. Traditional Tsimane’ musical culture also once included shamanic practices with drum playing, but these practices are no longer in use110. The region containing Tsimane’ communities is undergoing rapid modernization due to a push by the Bolivian government and non-government organizations to provide services to the Indigenous peoples. Radio usage is now fairly common, and villages near the local town of San Borja tend to have electricity. During the mid-1950s, Protestant missionaries from the United States settled permanently along the river Maniqui to proselytize Tsimane’, setting up the first rural schools for them and teaching them church hymns111. More recently, evangelism has spread Christianity within and across many villages. Thus, in addition to their knowledge of traditional music, nowadays most Tsimane’ villagers are somewhat familiar with religious Christian hymns. These hymns are monophonic and sung in Tsimane’. They are similar to traditional Tsimane’ music in relying on small intervals and a narrow vocal range and are sometimes accompanied by other instruments played by community members. Group singing appears to be rare, irrespective of whether the material is traditional songs or hymns. For the present study, we recruited participants in three Tsimane’ villages. Upon arriving at each village, we used a horn or a bell to initiate a community meeting where we introduced the researchers and registered participants for experiment sessions. Two of the villages (Mara and Moseruna) were a two-day walk or a three-hour car ride from San Borja, along a road that was accessible only to high-clearance vehicles and motorcycles if recent weather had been dry. The other village (Yaranda) was located along the Maniqui River and accessible only by a one-day trip on a motorized canoe. All three villages have relatively little communal church singing. The participants had varied musical experience, but none regarded music as a profession. None of the participants had formal training in music. Two participants reported regularly playing an instrument, and 34 participants reported playing an instrument at least once.\n\nBolivia: San Borja—non-musicians (BO.SB-NM)\n\nSan Borja is a small town in the Bolivian department of Beni in the Amazon basin with over 20,000 residents. At the time of data collection, San Borja could be reached by car during dry months of the year but was accessible only by small planes during much of the rainy season. Participants were recruited by word of mouth and had resided for most of their life in San Borja. The participants had not received formal education in music.\n\nBolivia: Santa Cruz de la Sierra—non-musicians (BO.SC-NM)\n\nSanta Cruz de la Sierra is the largest city in Bolivia, with a population of over 1.8 million people. Participants were recruited using an online advertisement and word of mouth. All participants had been born and raised in the Bolivian department of Santa Cruz, and they resided in the city at the time of the experiment. The participants had not received formal education in music.\n\nBolivia: La Paz—students and non-musicians (BO.LP-ST and BO.LP-NM)\n\nLa Paz is the third-largest city in Bolivia, with a population of over 0.9 million people, located in the Andes. We recruited the student group from local universities. Most student participants were recruited by a student who was a research assistant. For the non-musician group, we recruited blue-collar workers employed by a hotel and their relatives. These participants were mostly from El Alto, a city adjacent to La Paz (with a population of about one million people), and many of them were Indigenous (Aymara or Quechua). Many participants reported experience with traditional music and dance in childhood or as adults. The participants had not received formal education in music.\n\nBrazil—local musicians (BR-LM)\n\nWe recruited percussionists in the Recife metropolitan area, a city in Pernambuco, part of Northeast Brazil. The population of the Recife metropolitan area is over four million people. The percussionists practice a local style of music that is part of the Maracatu-nação (translation from Portuguese: ‘nation maracatu’) cultural tradition. This region-specific tradition, usually perceived as Afro-Brazilian, involves religion, music, song, dance and elaborate costumes. Its history is disputed but is most often linked to the colonial coronations of queens and kings among enslaved Africans in Brazil (in the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries). However, the earliest descriptions date only from the beginning of the twentieth century112,113. The music is performed by community-based groups in the slums of the metropolitan area of Recife termed maracatus-nação, approximately 30 of which are currently active. These groups include a costumed dance group and a large percussion ensemble. The groups perform in parades that take place primarily during Carnival. The percussionists we recruited either grew up within one of these community groups or had participated in one for at least several years. The participants had not received formal education in music in a university or conservatory but received substantial training as described above.\n\nUruguay—students and local musicians (UY-ST and UY-LM)\n\nParticipants in Uruguay were all recruited in Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, with a population of over 1.3 million people. The musicians were performers of Uruguayan candombe drumming59,114. All participants were born and raised in neighbourhoods with a strong tradition of candombe drumming and were ‘native players’, having acquired their competence in the style by direct transmission. The majority of the participants were outstanding players, regarded as master drummers by the community. As a rule, the participants did not have formal musical training in a conservatory or university, although a few of them had some basic knowledge of music theory and could play instruments other than the drum (such as keyboards and bass). However, they had all had substantial practical training in drumming since childhood. The participants were recruited by L.J. and M.R., who are local experts in this musical style and are familiar with the local musicians. The students were members of the local university with no formal musical training but with passive exposure to music, including Uruguayan candombe drumming. They were recruited by two research assistants by word of mouth.\n\nUnited Kingdom—students and jazz musicians (UK-ST and UK-LM)\n\nTwo groups of participants were recruited in North East England and Scotland, an area of the United Kingdom with over eight million people. Most participants were recruited from Durham, a county in England with over 500,000 people. The first group consisted of students from Durham University. The second group consisted of instrumental jazz musicians, comprising a mix of professional musicians and students currently studying music at university (the students were recruited from Durham University and the University of Edinburgh). All participants in this group reported that they perform jazz in public and earn money from performing, and all had formal training in music in a university and/or conservatory. These participants played a range of instruments (including piano, saxophone, guitar, trumpet, drums and double bass), and most reported performing in a range of different sub-genres and groups, most commonly big bands and smaller ensembles (such as trios) playing jazz standards. Some participants reported liking or performing musical traditions from other cultures, including Latin and Balkan-influenced music.\n\nSweden—local musicians (SE-LM)\n\nThe recruitment of musicians in Stockholm (the largest metropolitan area in Sweden, with over 2.4 million people) focused on students and teachers of folk music performance at the Royal College of Music, and on dance students at the School of Dance and Circus at the Stockholm University of the Arts, as the latter also had extensive experience playing music. Among the latter group, we required the participants’ focus to be Swedish folk dance. Of the 22 recruited participants from the Stockholm area, 9 considered themselves mainly as dancers and 13 mainly as musicians, and 1 participant identified as a dancer and musician to the same degree. In addition, 72% of the participants reported making money from performing music or dance, and all but 4 reported performing in public. Independent of this self-categorization, all participants asserted that they dance and have experience with either instrumental or vocal music making.\n\nBulgaria—local musicians and dancers (BG-LM and BG-DA)\n\nThe recruitment of musicians and dancers in Bulgaria focused on members of a type of professional folk ensemble that developed once the country adopted a communist system of government after the Second World War115,116. These ensembles typically consist of an orchestra of folk instruments, a women’s choir and a dance troupe, and they give stage performances of arranged and newly composed Bulgarian folk music and elaborately choreographed folk dances. Most performers in these ensembles have studied folk music performance or choreography in the Bulgarian conservatory system. Some of the dancers who participated in the study belonged to professional or semi-professional dance troupes that perform Bulgarian folk dances with recorded rather than live music. We recruited participants in three Bulgarian cities: Pleven (a city with approximately 90,000 people), Plovdiv (a city with approximately 343,000 people) and Sofia (the capital of Bulgaria and the largest metropolitan area, with over 1.2 million people). The participants were members of the ensembles in these cities and were contacted with permission from the ensemble directors.\n\nTurkey—students and local musicians (TR-ST and TR-LM)\n\nThe group of Turkish student participants was recruited from Istanbul Technical University Turkish Music State Conservatory and Bogazici University. The Istanbul metropolitan area has over 15.8 million people. The musician participant group was recruited from the cities of Izmir and Istanbul and included professional musicians who had studied at institutes or conservatories for traditional Turkish music, such as Istanbul Technical University Turkish Music State Conservatory. These musicians were experienced in Turkish folk music or dance through formal training or extensive practice in groups or ensembles. They had experience in various sub-genres of Turkish music, ranging from Aegean to Black Sea regions, also including Sufi music. The musicians were involved in ensembles performing traditional, religious, classical or modern Turkish music, as well as Western music with Eastern influences.\n\nMali—students, local musicians and dancers (MA-ST, MA-LM and MA-DA)\n\nThe group of Malian university students was recruited in the capital city of Bamako and comprised both BA- and MA-level students as well as recent graduates of the University of Bamako. Bamako is the capital of Mali and the largest metropolitan area in the country, with a population of over two million people. Students were recruited by N.D. by word of mouth. The musician group was also recruited in Bamako. Their main performance work occurred at local music and dance events, primarily wedding celebrations, but they also worked in the national and international scenes of staged folk dance and percussion music117. Most musicians did not have training in music from a university or conservatory but instead had substantial training via traditional, practice-based apprenticeships. By contrast, Malian dancers were not active as specialized musicians (and did not have formal education in music or dance) but regularly danced at wedding celebrations in which professional musicians performed, and thus were highly familiar with local styles of music. Only one of the participants reported receiving money from playing or dancing. R.P. (who has more than 30 years of experience working with Malian musicians) recruited the musicians with the help of a research assistant. The dancer participants were recruited on the basis of their membership in a local dance organization in the peasant village of Sagele, approximately 75 km southwest of Bamako. Sagele has a population of approximately 5,000 people.\n\nBotswana: San—local musicians (BW.SA-LM)\n\nThe San musician group was recruited in D’Kar, a village ~640 km northwest of Gabarone (the capital of Botswana), with a population of about 1,700 people. The participants were either members of a local organization that performed traditional songs and dances of the San culture (primarily for nearby events or for tourists) or local residents with substantial musical experience (at least ten years of self-reported musical experience) but no formal musical training in a university or conservatory.\n\nBotswana: Etsha—local musicians (BW.EA-LM)\n\nThe second Botswanan group was recruited in Etsha, a group of villages ~320 km north of D’kar, with a population of about 10,000 people. The participants were members of two groups who performed traditional songs, or local residents with substantial musical experience (more than seven self-reported years of musical experience). The participants came from two closely related Okavango Delta region subcultures: Hambukushu and Bayei. Although the Hambukushu and Bayei are culturally distinct, their geographic proximity means they are each exposed to each other’s music, with far less exposure to the music of the San. The participants had no formal musical training from a university or conservatory.\n\nNamibia—non-musicians and local musicians (NM-NM and NM-LM)\n\nParticipants in Namibia were recruited from a small local Damara community (population ~500) in the Spitzkoppe region via word of mouth during the week prior to the start of the study. Recruitment and data collection occurred with help from two local research assistants, who also acted as translators. The musician group was drawn from two active musical groups, both of whom had extensive experience with traditional music of the region: a ‘cultural singing group’ (who frequently practice and perform |ais (old traditional folk songs and dances), in addition to other styles of performance) and a ‘youth choir’ (who typically rehearse and perform elob mis, a form of gospel music, sung in Khoekhoegowab (the local language), English and Afrikaans). Both groups perform at local and regional community events (such as weddings, funerals and an annual Damara traditional festival). The singing group intermittently performs for visiting tourists, and the youth choir also performs weekly in church. The first group typically earns money in exchange for these performances, though most members would not be construed as professional performers and did not have formal training from a university or a conservatory. The non-musician participants were members of the local community who were not part of either group. Although almost all participants reported engaging in some form of singing (for example, joining in at weddings or other community events, or simply while listening to the radio), these non-musician participants did not regularly practice or perform with any group, and many had limited or no knowledge of old traditional song lyrics and dances.\n\nIndia—non-musicians and local musicians (IN-NM and IN-LM)\n\nIn India, the experiment was conducted at I.I.T. Bombay in the city of Mumbai (a city with over 20.9 million people). The non-musicians all worked or studied at I.I.T. Bombay and had not had any musical training or substantial exposure to Indian classical music. We classified the group as non-musicians rather than students because only a minority (6 of 15) were students. Most of the musician participants were professional musicians living in the city, but a few were students at I.I.T. Bombay. Most of them were trained in the North Indian (Hindustani) form of art music. Formal training typically involves taking one-on-one lessons from a teacher (the appointed guru) and performing in public concerts. Some of the musician participants were primarily vocalists but also played an instrument, and about half of them were tabla (percussion) players who accompanied vocalists in concerts. All but three musicians reported currently playing in public concerts, and 64% reported at least sometimes receiving money from playing.\n\nSouth Korea—students, Western classical musicians and local musicians (KR-ST, KR-WM and KR-LM)\n\nThe Korean student participant group was recruited from Chungnam National University in Daejeon, a metropolitan area containing over 1.4 million people. The Western musician group consisted of students from the Department of Music at Chungnam National University. These participants had been exposed to both Western music and K-pop music via mass media. The local musician group comprised students studying traditional Korean instruments in the Department of Korean Music at Jeonbuk National University located in Jeonju, a metropolitan area containing over 651,000 people. These participants had trained on Korean traditional instruments for many years but also had extensive exposure to both Western and K-pop music.\n\nJapan—students, Western classical musicians and local musicians (JP-ST, JP-WM and JP-LM)\n\nIn Japan, the student and Western musician groups were recruited from Keio University Shonan Fujisawa Campus in Fujisawa, Kanagawa, near Tokyo. Tokyo is the capital of Japan and the metropolitan area with the largest population (over 37.2 million people). Participants in the student group had no formal musical training. The Western musician group had formal music training in Western instruments. The local musician group was recruited from Tokyo University of the Arts (Japan’s leading music conservatory). They all played at public events, and 73% received money for playing music. We recruited students studying traditional Japanese instruments (shamisen, koto, shakuhachi or hayashi instruments from the noh ensemble) in the Department of Traditional Japanese Music. These students had to train on these instruments for many years to qualify for acceptance into the department and can be considered ‘bi-musical’118 in that they had extensive exposure to both popular Western and traditional Japanese musical systems. All Japanese participants had extensive passive exposure to both Western music and Western-influenced Japanese popular music via radio, TV and other media. All Japanese participants were recruited from Tokyo and its surrounding cities.\n\nChina—non-musicians (CN-NM)\n\nParticipants in China were recruited from a cluster of Dong minority villages in the Guizhou Province in southwestern China. The Guizhou Province contains approximately 38.5 million people, and the Dong villages each have approximately 500 to 2,000 people. Singing features prominently in many village activities, but the most famous and distinctive tradition of Dong song is Dage, or Big Song, recognized by UNESCO in 2009 on their list of humanity’s Intangible Cultural Heritage. There is wide participation throughout the villages in learning and performing Dage, a genre of two-part group polyphonic singing, occasionally metred, where words are central and pitch height and contour carefully follow the lyrics119. Dage is performed informally within people’s homes and more formally within the drum-towers found in many villages119. The participants had no formal musical training from a university or conservatory.\n\nOnline participants from the United States, Brazil and India (US-OL, BR-OL and IN-OL)\n\nAll online participants were recruited using Amazon Mechanical Turk. In the online advertisement, we required the participants to meet the following five criteria: they had to (1) be at least 18 years old, (2) speak English, (3) use a laptop to complete the experiment (no desktop computers allowed), (4) use an up-to-date Google Chrome browser (due to compatibility with the technology) and (5) sit in a quiet environment, to ensure that their tapping could be recorded precisely. To test participants from the United States, India and Brazil, we used Amazon Mechanical Turk’s qualification system, which allows researchers to recruit participants registered in each location. To ensure that the participants were undertaking the experiment from the registered location, we only included participants whose registered location matched their IP-based geo-location, which we verified using the service ipinfo.io. We estimate that the Mechanical Turk participant pool in the United States has a few thousand unique active participants per week. In India and Brazil, we estimate that the number of unique active participants is about 500 and 200, respectively.\n\nAnalysis\n\nSmall-integer ratios\n\nFollowing Jacoby and McDermott26, we considered ‘small-integer-ratio rhythms’ to be those with ratios composed of the integers 1, 2 and 3 that fell within the rhythm triangle. This results in the following 22 unique ratios: Ω22 = {1:1:1, 1:1:2, 1:2:1, 2:1:1, 1:2:2, 2:1:2, 2:2:1, 1:1:3, 1:3:1, 3:1:1, 1:2:3, 2:3:1, 3:1:2, 1:3:2, 2:1:3, 3:2:1, 2:2:3, 2:3:2, 3:2:2, 2:3:3, 3:2:3, 3:3:2}. We also grouped together categories that are equivalent under cyclic permutation, resulting in eight categories: Ω8 = {111, 112, 122, 113, 123, 223, 233, 132}.\n\nKernel density estimates of the prior\n\nThe experiment consisted of a number of trials, each of which consisted of iterated reproduction of a random seed rhythm. We estimated a participant’s prior using the data from the fifth and final iteration of each trial, having demonstrated in Jacoby and McDermott26 that five iterations are sufficient for the iterative procedure to converge to the prior (Supplementary Figs. 1, 2 and 7 in Jacoby and McDermott; see Supplementary Fig. 2 of this paper for analyses of convergence in each group)26. Before this analysis, we excluded points outside the inner triangular region defined earlier that was intended to correspond to the region of human-producible rhythms (with vertices \\(\\left(\\,\\frac{3}{2}{f},\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}{f}\\,\\right),\\left(1-\\frac{3}{2}{f},\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}{f}\\;\\right),\\left(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(1-2f)\\;\\right)\\), where f = 300/2,000). The prior was then estimated by adding together Gaussian kernels, with mean μi and covariance Σi empirically computed from the repetitions of the rhythm within the fifth iteration (there were up to ten repetitions depending on the number that the participant correctly produced during the fifth iteration; for repetitions that had missing taps, the missing tap(s) was replaced by the mean onset of the successfully produced taps at that stimulus position). Since this covariance matrix is estimated on the basis of small numbers of samples, we added a regularization term: \\({\\varSigma }_{i}^{{\\prime} }={\\varSigma }_{i}+\\gamma I\\), where I is the identity matrix, and γ = 15 ms (we slightly increased this value compared with the γ = 10 ms of Jacoby and McDermott26 since some participant groups had lower numbers of correctly reproduced repetitions). We averaged these kernels (\\({G}_{i}\\left(x\\right) \\sim {\\mathrm{N}}({\\mu }_{i},{\\varSigma }_{i}^{{\\prime} })\\), one per trial) across all completed trials within a participant group, obtaining a distribution \\(P(x)=\\frac{1}{N}{\\sum }_{i=1}^{N}{G}_{i}\\left(x\\right)\\) over the triangle. For statistical analyses, we represented these distributions in bins spanning 0.006 in each dimension of the triangle (that is, 12 ms given the 2,000 ms pattern duration). To generate high-resolution images for the paper figures, we used bins of size 0.003 in each dimension. Supplementary Figs. 3–9 show high-resolution kernel density estimates for all groups.\n\nNormalizing density compared with uniform distribution\n\nAs described above, the random seeds were constrained to have the smallest interval exceed 15% of the pattern duration (300 ms), corresponding to a smaller triangular region within the full rhythm triangle. We defined the uniform distribution over this smaller region as U. To avoid working with small numbers, we pointwise-normalized the kernel density estimate P with respect to U—namely, P′(x) = P(x)/U(x). We note that in all images depicting kernel density estimates, the density was clipped at a value of 5 (relative to uniform) to preserve the dynamic range for details at low density values. In the OSF repository associated with this project, we included images with less clipping (relative density of 10).\n\nJensen–Shannon divergence\n\nTo compare distances between distributions, we used the Jensen–Shannon divergence. The Jensen–Shannon divergence of two distributions P and Q is defined as\n\n$${\\mathrm{JSD}}(P,Q)=\\frac{1}{2}{D}_{{\\mathrm{KL}}}\\left(P,M\\,\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}{D}_{{\\mathrm{KL}}}\\left(Q,M\\,\\right)$$\n\nwhere \\(M=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(P+Q\\right)\\) and \\({D}_{{\\mathrm{KL}}}\\left(P,Q\\right)=\\displaystyle\\int_{x} P(x)\\ \\log_2\\left(\\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\\right)\\ {\\mathrm{d}} \\ \\!x\\).\n\nGaussian mixture model fits\n\nTo measure the relative weight of each category in a group’s prior, we used a Gaussian mixture model in which the mean of each mixture component was constrained to be close to a small-integer-ratio rhythm. This constraint aided interpretability by removing the degeneracy in the correspondence between mixture components and the modes of the data distribution, guaranteeing that each mode was associated with the same category across groups, while allowing the mixture components to deviate from exact integer ratios as dictated by the data. We imposed additional constraints on the standard Gaussian mixture model fitting procedure of the model to ensure that the mapping of mixture components to integer ratios was fixed across groups, to avoid artefacts associated with small sample size and to avoid uninterpretable overlap between the modes.\n\nWe define a Gaussian mixture model with category centres {μi}i=1…K, covariance matrices {Ci}i=1…K and weights {wi}i=1…K as follows:\n\n$$Q(x)=\\sum _{i}\\frac{{w}_{i}}{2\\pi \\sqrt{{\\rm{|}}{C}_{k}{\\rm{|}}}}\\exp \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}{\\left(x-{\\mu }_{i}\\right)}^{{\\mathrm{T}}}{C}_{k}^{-1}(x-{\\mu }_{i})\\right)\\,$$\n\nTo fit the model, we used a modified expectation–maximization algorithm120. We initialized the algorithm by assigning the mixture components to the small-integer-ratio rhythms within Ω22. We then proceeded by alternating between the expectation and maximization steps. After each maximization step, we applied the following additional constraints:\n\n(1)\n\nMode identity: to guarantee that each mode was associated with the same category across groups, we required that \\({\\|{\\mu }_{i}-{\\mu }_{i}^{0}\\|}_{2} < {\\frac{1}{2}d}_{\\min }\\), where \\({\\mu }_{i}^{0}\\) is the ith category in Ω22 and where dmin is the minimal distance between categories in Ω22. This constraint permits the modes to deviate substantially from integer ratios to faithfully represent bias in the data, but not so much that the correspondence with integer ratios is lost.\n\n(2)\n\nOverlap: to avoid overlap between the modes, we required that the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix λ1 and λ2 satisfy the constraint that \\(\\left|{{\\lambda }}_{i}\\right| < {d}_{\\min }\\).\n\n(3)\n\nAdditional constraints on the overlap between the modes: we also required that λ1 and λ2 be limited by \\(A < \\frac{{\\lambda }_{i}}{{\\lambda }_{1}+{\\lambda }_{2}} < 1-A\\), where A is a constant. We fixed A = 1/5, which intuitively corresponds to a constraint on the aspect ratio of the ellipsoid defined by the covariance matrix.\n\nWe applied these constraints after the maximization step. We applied constraint 1 by projecting the μi resulting from maximization step to the closest point in Euclidean distance that satisfied constraint 1. Similarly, we applied constraints 2 and 3 on the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix by truncating them so they satisfied both constraints:\n\n$${\\lambda' }_{i}=\\min\\left({\\lambda }_{i},{\\frac{1}{2}d}_{\\min }\\right)$$\n\n$${\\lambda^{\\prime\\prime}}_{i}=\\min{\\left(\\max\\left({\\lambda^{\\prime}}_{i},A({\\lambda^{\\prime}}_{1}+{\\lambda^{\\prime}}_{2})\\right),(1-A)({\\lambda^{\\prime}}_{1}+{\\lambda^{\\prime}}_{2})\\right)}$$\n\nWe then iterated these steps until convergence (using a convergence threshold of 1 × 10−6). The result was an estimate of {μi}i=1…K, {Ci}i=1…K and {wi}i=1…K. We emphasize that these constraints do not place strong limits on the locations of the modes, which are free to exhibit biases, or on the category boundaries, which need not be located symmetrically between modes. The constraints merely serve to enable us to label the modes in a consistent way. A Gaussian mixture model fit in this way to each group’s data explained most of the kernel density variability (91% on average, ranging from 80.6% to 97.5% depending on the group).\n\nThis procedure is different from the one reported in Jacoby and McDermott26, where we performed a numeric constraint optimization with the MATLAB fmincon function on the Kullback–Leibler divergence of the kernel density estimate defined by the model and the kernel density estimate of the data. Other than this difference, we had similar constraints on the optimization. The 2017 procedure provided comparable results but was slower than the method used here. Considering the large amount of data in this project, we considered the efficient expectation–maximization method to be preferable to direct optimization.\n\nGaussian mixture model with 7:2:3 category\n\nIn the case of Malian drummers and dancers, we added additional rhythm categories at 2:3:7, 7:2:3 and 3:7:2 (Figs. 5 and 7g–i). We denote this by Ω25 = Ω22∪{2:3:7,7:2:3,3:7:2} and used it instead of Ω22 for the Gaussian mixture model estimate. In all other respects, the analysis was identical to that in the previous section (Gaussian mixture model fit with Ω22).\n\nAverage category weights\n\nIn all cases, we fitted the Gaussian mixture to the categories (Ω22, except for Fig. 7g–i, where we used Ω25). In some cases, we wanted to display or analyse the results ignoring cyclic permutations of the same category (for example, 2:2:3, 2:3:2 and 3:2:2 would be mapped to the"
