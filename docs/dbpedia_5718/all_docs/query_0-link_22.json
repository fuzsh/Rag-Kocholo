        "text": "London rapper DC has just released a single called ‘Neighbourhood’ today and it’s absolutely golden. This confident South East Londoner is definitely one to watch.\n\nIn my time running The Sound Sniffer, I haven’t really featured many rap artists. Last summer, we featured a track called The Wedding by a young unsigned, Romford based rapper, Average J. That’s been about it in terms of rap on here recently. I stumbled across this new DC single a couple of hours ago and totally fell in love. The piano based beat, the smooth vocal tone and the poignancy of the lyrics on Neighbourhood set it apart. I’ve come across plenty of tunes in this style, sure, but this one is universally appealing. The whole package just works.\n\nThe tune was released earlier today and a well produced video accompanies it too. It’s clear lots of work and dedication has gone into this project. I wouldn’t be a huge expert on London’s rap scene and the artists that are big right now. However, I do respect a good tune when I find one and Neighbourhood by DC is the best tune I’ve come across this week. I didn’t think I’d be falling in love with a rap tune today. It has happened and it feels good.\n\nSome words to describe it – Powerful / Honest / Impactful\n\nPlease check out my recent interviews with LANKS / CALLUM PITT / QUINN CHRISTOPHERSON / BILLY NOMATES / OLLIE CHANIN\n\nAbout ‘The Sound Sniffer’\n\nThe Sound Sniffer is a music blog which is still only a baby – Founded and run by Kevin Coakley in early 2019. He is a music writer and ghostwriter. ‘The Sound Sniffer’ also runs showcases in London since Oct 2019. The showcases are picked from artists we find in our submissions inbox."
