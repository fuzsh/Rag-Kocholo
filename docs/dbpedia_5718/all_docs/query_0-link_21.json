        "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI watched a documentary called 'Hip Hop Evolution' on Netflix and I found it very interesting. I liked how it showed the beginning of the movement that evolved into what we, or at least I, know as hip hop. But as every documentary out there, I'm sure a lot of stuff was not in it.\n\nI listen to a lot of music, mainly rock from the 60s to the 90s and some hip hop. I know my rock, the classics, the seminal bands, you name it, but the thing is, watching that documentary made me realize that the oldest hip hop I listen is N.W.A., Ice-T, and then I go to Dre, Pac, you know the usual suspects, and mainly 90s stuff.\n\nSo, ERA, what would you recommend to someone interested in listening to the real classics, the OGs, the artists that were the foundation? If I could find your recommendations on Spotify it would be amazing :)\n\nWell if you like rock, alot of def jams work and instrumentation is based on rock due to rick rubins productions.\n\nRun DMC, kool moe dee, public enemy, krs one, ll cool J, beastie boys, eric b and rakim, big daddy kane, epmd\n\nAlot of these artists first albums are influential. Although how much they hold up is subjective from song to song. Certain song writing structures can be poor, and the lack of hooks is sometimes quite noticeable ( most songs use a sample as the hook). Sometimes beats can be slightly lackluster due to simplicity, and im not a huge fan of the rock influence myself.\n\nGo into with an open minded, but dont have 90's level of expectations.\n\nEdit : forgot about slick rick. Also some albums do have random moments where they just let the dj play a song, or they decide to end a decent track by having a 4 minute ending to a song where the dj just scratches\n\nGrandmaster Flowers (precedes Grandmaster Flash)\n\nGrandmaster Flowers (Jonathon Cameron Flowers) was a DJ from Brooklyn, New York. One of the earliest DJs to mix records together in sequence,[1] Flowers was known as one of the earliest pioneers of hip hop. Flowers was involved in the disco and funk scene and used to hold block parties. Flowers is cited as having a \"formative influence\" on hip hop DJs[2]such as Grandmaster Flash[3] and Afrika Bambaataa in the early 1970s. In 1969, Grandmaster Flowers opened for James Brown at Yankee Stadium. Although an inspiration to many of hip hop's early greats - he is highly respected by those he influenced - Flowers himself never attained the heights of his successors in hip hop culture. As he found himself being overtaken by the younger up-and-coming DJs at the end of the 1970s, Flowers struggled with a life of hardship and dependence on hard drugs. He died in 1992.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmaster_Flowers\n\nThis is the oldest record I've rocked with, from 1983:\n\nChrist what a hottake. The Chronic and Doggystyle alone are worth more than half those people's lives Lol. Your comment also completely erases Biggie.\n\n:)\n\nI'll give you Rakim he was doing his thing but most of the 80's stuff was pretty boo boo in hindsight. It's cool though cuz they was just building at the time perfecting the shit.\n\nEarly 90's had that hardcore era I could care less about, the best album from 90-93 imo is Whut The Album from Redman outside of that ion care. 93-96 was cool but that was the time instrumentals were mad boring loops I could care less about, made a lot of the music boring to me there were some exceptions tho, west side was killin it back then. 97-00' was when rap was going on a grander scale and was when shit was gettin really good and the early 2000's really set it off.\n\nK-Rob Vs. Rammellzee - Beap Bop\n\nWhether directly or indirectly, the single has been described as a blueprint for the \"apocalyptic, witty, and experimental\" style of many modern hip hop artists, such as Antipop Consortium and El-P.[12] The track has even been thought to provide a stylistic basis for more famous groups, such as Cypress Hill and Beastie Boys,[7] with the latter going so far as to sample it at least twice: for the chorus on \"B-Boys Makin' with the Freak Freak\" (which takes its title from a line in \"Beat Bop\") from Ill Communication and on \"Jimmy James\" from Check Your Head.[13] Influential British DJ Tim Westwood is known to have been a big fan of the track.[14] It has been cited as one of the essential records of old school hip hop, alongside more popular tracks like \"Rapper's Delight\" and \"The Message\", with one writer calling it \"the Ulysses of rap music\".[3]\n\nFamed street artist Jean-Michel Basquiat produced the track.\n\nRoxanne Shante - Roxanne's Revenge\n\nIn 1984, Shante was a 14-year-old amateur rapper living in the Queensbridge housing projects. She started rhyming at age 10 and quickly became known around the neighborhood. MCs would travel from other projects to battle her.\n\nThat year, while walking to the laundromat, she was approached by neighbor and record producer Marley Marl. He asked her to rhyme over a beat. Shante recorded a track in his living room.\n\n\"Then I went and finished my laundry,\" Shante, now 48, tells The Post. She had no idea she'd just made hip-hop history.\n\nThe song she recorded that day became known as \"Roxanne's Revenge,\" and it would launch what is perhaps the first hip-hop beef, a now-venerable genre.\n\nThe song served as a response to \"Roxanne, Roxanne,\" a wildly popular track from Brooklyn-based rappers UTFO. The song was about a girl who's \"all stuck up\" and refuses the members' advances.\n\nThe sentiment — \"the fact that being a female in the industry and knowing about how [men] heckle you and try to talk to you when you walk past,\" Shante says — rubbed her the wrong way.\n\n\"When Marley Marl asked me to do something on top of [the beat from] 'Roxanne, Roxanne,' I just jumped into the character,\" Shante says. (She was born Lolita Shante Gooden but changed her name to Roxanne Shante after the song.)\n\nShe freestyled the whole thing in a single take — more than four minutes of rhymes eviscerating UTFO and explaining why Roxanne would never date them.\n\nhttps://nypost.com/2018/03/22/how-a-14-year-old-started-the-worlds-first-rap-beef/\n\nI think if you're going to do diggin in the crates for foundational hip hop artist you'd be remiss in not also listening to the genres that became the foundation for the sound of hip hop. Funk and blues, specifically. I think you should absolutely start with James Brown, particularly Funky Drummer, performed by James Brown and Clyde Stubblefield.\n\nThe rhythm pattern on \"Funky Drummer\" is cited as one of the world's top most sampled drum segments and has backed hip hop songs for 30 years. Rediscovered by Hank Shocklee of The Bombsquad while they were creating mixes for Public Enemy in the early 1980s, it has since been used by hip-hop groups and rappers including Run-D.M.C., N.W.A, LL Cool J, and Boogie Down Productions. Starting with Bell Biv DeVoe's \"Poison,\" new jack swing artists have sampled a snare unit on loop.[8] As of 2018, the drum break has been sampled in more than 1,400 other songs.[9]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funky_Drummer\n\nIf Hip Hop took a dna test, Cylde Stubblefield would be the father for his improvised drum break at 5:20.\n\nThere are a lot of post in this thread to ignore and dismiss out of hand however,\n\nSchoolly D - P.S.K. 1985\n\nT La Rock - It's Yours 1984\n\nFrom the late 80's definitely Critical Beatdown by Ultramagnetic MC's and 3 Feet High and Rising by De La Soul.\n\nI think if you're going to do diggin in the crates for foundational hip hop artist you'd be remiss in not also listening to the genres that became the foundation for the sound of hip hop.

Illmatic is the Ocarina of Time of hip-hop but for this particular discussion nor it or Nas are relevant.\n\nAlso, I feel like much of the era(s) before the 90's is becoming lost in the annals. I mean, I want to say everyone knows Nas on forward generally, to where he's in most older millenial's top 5, along with Biggie, Pac, etc.. I remember the days when the consensus top 5 was always something like Rakim, KRS, LL, G Rap, Kane...\n\nThose dudes really had direct influences on the Nas's and them with rhyme styles that still sounded fresh through that next era.\n\nAlso, I feel like much of the era(s) before the 90's is becoming lost in the annals.

So in my generation ( late Gen-X), that top 5 you listed is indicative of coast to coast radio, MTV and magazines. I'm just starting to learn about all the influences of old skool philly hip hop.\n\nAlso, January 2019 a selected panel will try and nail down the Top 30 emcees all time in what's being called\n\n\"The Great MC Debate\"\n\n\"A panel of 10 will bring a list of their Top 40 emcees all time. We will then begin the process of elimination. We will say a name and if all 10 people have that name on the list it goes on the board. Once we get to the first name that is not unanimous, the debate will begin\"\n\nI don't have all the details yet but it will be live streamed and will have a diverse enough group in age and taste that we don't end up with a regional bias.

I should've continued my post to say that even that \"antiquated\" top 5 comes from a later and more well known era. I'm not sure how much interest young cats gnerally have in the earliest eras at this point (though seeing a thread like this gives me hope) but it always seemed serious heads were those who delved as far back as they could. Then again it was easier when there was less to delve through.\n\nAlso, January 2019 a selected panel will try and nail down the Top 30 emcees all time in what's being called\n\n\"The Great MC Debate\"\n\n\"A panel of 10 will bring a list of their Top 40 emcees all time.
