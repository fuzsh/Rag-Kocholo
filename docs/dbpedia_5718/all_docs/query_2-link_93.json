Here, amid the rough edges of the city writhing under constant change, she found a space where nature's unyielding persistence collided beautifully with the relentless decay of time. Adopting an outsider's point of view, Emily's creations - sculptures and oil paintings - have an archaic charm to them, her palette plays between shadows and intensely vibrant, off-primary hues, creating a mesmerizing spectrum that ignites her intuitive strokes.\n\nEmbracing and celebrating imperfection, Emily's works exude an authentic, raw visual narrative that encourages observers to celebrate the beauty of irregularity. At the core of Emily's artistry lies a feeling of abandonment: decay resonating with purity and beauty. Her experiences of living in Scotland, Canada, and Mexico have imbued her work with a global perspective that appreciates overlooked beauty. Currently, Emily calls Richmond, Virginia, her home, a city that mirrors her fascination with nature and decay, a testament to the lifelong appreciation of forgotten spaces.\n\nThe visual texture and intricate processes behind Emily's work breathe a palpable sense of freedom into each finished piece. Like an alluring pathway veiled in the deep hues of the forest by the roadside, her work invites viewers into a realm of solitary, unfettered imagination. It's there, hidden in the whirl of colors and forms, where true freedom of imagination comes to life.\n\nEVB works out of a warehouse in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nExhibit runs July 20 - August 24\n\nOpening / DJs: Saturday July 20, 5-9pm\n\nClosing / performances by Tire x Silver, Alma Laprida, Model Home: Saturday August 24, 7-10pm\n\nOpen during all events, or email us to schedule a different time to view\n\nCaron: “My love for film photography is rooted in its ability to capture life's nuances. There's something about the grainy texture, and the nostalgia of it all that speaks to me. It's a medium that requires patience, attention to detail, and a willingness to take risks – qualities that resonate deeply with my own creative process. As a person of color, I'm committed to capturing the untold stories of Baltimore's hardcore scene – a community that's often marginalized and overlooked. My photographs are a testament to the resilience and beauty of these individuals who embody the spirit of rebellion and nonconformity. From underground music venues to DIY spaces, I seek out alternative spaces that showcase raw energy and creativity.”\n\nNick: “Sentient Lines is about how music is more than just sound but a feeling, a sentient being, and a connecting line through us all. I was blessed to have sat next to Logan when she wrote the poem that has served as the lodestar for this gallery. I believe this line represents Caron and I’s work the best: ‘He drifts through fields and empty homes, skips through crossroads and crowded streets, wafts around campfires, and eventually settles in the soul, laying claim to flesh and bone.’”\n\nLogan: “Sentient Lines tells the story of the living and breathing spirit of music, who travels through the contrasting rural and urban, touching the souls and lives of everything and everyone. Music slams the senses, causing the bubbling breath of emotion creating the ultimate line of connection through all of us. Regardless of time or space, the soul of music will always live on.”\n\nTuesday August 13 * 7pm * $10-25 * TICKETS\n\n“When I get to play music in front of people, I get to access something softer than on my most regular days. I get to move and squeeze and put intention where it would normally feel locked up. If I want to, I can move slower or not say much at all. I can yell with the people next to me. I hope that listeners also feel invited to access sides of them that they might feel are inappropriate in their daily lives. FRIGERATOR formed in Denton, Texas and is a ensemble that first helped me feel this way about music. In its current form, it consists of myself, Keith Butler Jr, Zach Dixon, Sarah Marie Hughes, Abe Mamet, Jamie Sandel, and Nelson Dougherty.” - Will Tober\n\nWashington DC-based ¡FIASCO! was first assembled in 2016 building a unique repertoire of sounds and materials rooted in droning folk songs, jittery hip-hop grooves, grunge, and punk rock. ¡FIASCO! was signed to Unit Records in 2023 and released their Unit debut Anger Artist in January 2024.\n\nCutting Ceremony is a new improvised music trio.

Tracy Lisk (she/her), a percussionist who mainly performs on drum set, based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Ms. Lisk’s history as a painter and background in Brazilian percussion inform the substance of her improvisations which contain references to rhythmic structures while maintaining a fluid, suspended continuity. Abe Mamet (he/him), a French horn player from Denver, Colorado and living in Mt. Rainier, MD. Abe's main artistic motive as a composer and instrumentalist is to use considered composition and rigorously practiced improvisation to more honestly ground himself, his fellow musicians, and his audiences within the spaces they occupy daily.\n\nWednesday August 14 * doors at 6:30 * $15-25 * TICKETS\n\nYer Flowers are a Knoxville-based band of punks making country and rock n roll music that doesn’t spare the grit and flare. They create a fresh, fun, and bold sound that’s as colored by history as it is rooted in this moment, scoring lyricism which reveals a fractured existence that can only mend by leaning into the tears…and the arms of a hot date. A band for the good and the bad times, they’re a growth of budding flora fed by the same river that baptized Dolly—a sensual journey of becoming that’d behoove ya to tag along for!\n\nKevin Knight is a Leesburg, Virginia native, singer/songwriter, multi instrumentalist, and independent producer. The genre of Knight’s music is a fickle fox to chase. “Somewhere between folk storytelling, yet rooted in grunge, psychedelic fuzz rock, R&B, American primitive/drone, and even elements of black metal.

In live performances he focuses exclusively on improvisation with a home-made analog synthesizer and harpsichord. His synthesizer playing is highly gestural and responsive, pushing the technical aspects of synthesis to extreme dynamics from gentle to explosive, minimal to chaotic, bass rumble to thin buzz. His harpsichord music uses mathematical and/or experimental tunings to spin webs and streams of dissonant and complex melodies, tone clusters, and intense barrages of sound.\n\nSarah Hughes is a performing and visual artist currently living in Washington, DC. Hughes’ music is intuitive and genre-liberated while displaying an unquestionable command of her instrument and musical vocabulary.

To reach for possibilities beyond our materialistic society.\n\nMonday September 2 * 7pm * $15-25 * TICKETS\n\nKen Vandermark (USA): tenor saxophone & clarinet\n\nPNL (Norway): drums & percussion\n\nThe high impact duo of PNL (drums) and Ken Vandermark (reeds) has been working together for more than two decades, touring in Europe, the United States, Japan, and Brazil, and releasing 11 albums of critically acclaimed, wide ranging improvised music throughout that period. Though they have both worked in many other exceptional groups - such as the Peter Brötzmann Chicago Tentet and Lean Left (with Terrie Hessels and Andy Moor of The Ex) - they have continued to return to their duo for more than 20 years because it remains crucial to their creative output.\n\nPNL and Vandermark began this collaboration when they recorded their initial album,Dual Pleasure, for the label Smalltownsupersound, in 2002. Shortly afterward, they performed their first concert at the Molde International Jazz Festival. Since then, they've performed on an international basis every year. Their approach to the duo context is ferocious in its intensity, combining extreme rhythmic velocity with formal deconstruction and re-assembly, with the freedom to use any genre as a resource at any time. In many ways, PNL and Vandermark are more open in this setting than with any of their other playing situations, creating a unique approach to improvised music that is riveting in its ideas and execution.\n\nWednesday September 4 * 7pm * $10-20 * TICKETS\n\nPaige Alice Naylor is a Chicago-based experimental vocalist and musician touring work from her latest album, The Unearthing, released by Chicago label Monastral.

Their debut album Greatest Hits is a journey through songs penned by Obomsawin that explore decay and delicate moments – cradled by Abrego’s worldbuilding and evocative guitar playing. The band’s first single “There, There” premiered on the hit FX series Reservation Dogs in 2023, and the album, released the following January, has quickly won over audiences across Indian Country and the US.\n\nAllison Burik is a saxophonist, clarinetist, improviser, and composer based in Tio’tia:ke/Montreal, Quebec.

Accompanied by New York pianist Russ Lossing and drummer Billy Mintz, SB presents a series of themes based on this dynamic of emptiness, in a melodic, highly colorful music full of contrasts that links the abstract, lyrical chamber jazz of Jimmy Giuffre, with its sense of improvisation, and a harmonic vocabulary drawn from various sources of 20th-century art music, both European and American.\n\nCutting Ceremony is a new improvised music trio. Pete Dennis (they/he), a musician, improviser, composer, visual artist, and teacher. Living in West Philadelphia, Dennis is inspired by their beautiful community and the future.

Tracy Lisk (she/her), a percussionist who mainly performs on drum set, based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Ms. Lisk’s history as a painter and background in Brazilian percussion inform the substance of her improvisations which contain references to rhythmic structures while maintaining a fluid, suspended continuity. Abe Mamet (he/him), a French horn player from Denver, Colorado and living in Mt. Rainier, MD. Abe's main artistic motive as a composer and instrumentalist is to use considered composition and rigorously practiced improvisation to more honestly ground himself, his fellow musicians, and his audiences within the spaces they occupy daily.\n\nMonday October 7 * 7pm * $15 * TICKETS\n\nUniversal Light is an idea. It's a musical process. It's Mike Gangloff on fiddle, Jesse Sheppard on guitar, and Kaily Schenker on cello. Mike blends improvisation, original melodic composition, and a deep grounding in traditional Appalachian music. Over a slew of albums and tours, Elkhorn has ventured into countless psychedelic spaces, anchored by the churn of Jesse's acoustic 12-string guitar. As Solar Hex, Kaily mixes solo cello improvisation with keening vocal laments accompanied by harmonium.\n\nPergola is the work of Baltimore-based fingerstyle guitarist Todd Shelar. His music is influenced by American Primitive Guitar players, impressionism, minimalism, Renaissance through modern classical guitar and various folk music traditions. For Pergola’s Rhizome set, he'll be celebrating the release of his latest record of solo acoustic guitar instrumentals titled “Moon Glows The Same.”\n\nJon Camp is a fingerstyle guitarist and composer from the DC region.

The duo emerged virtually over the pandemic, where they began to develop and conceive of their first album, Bach en Bandoneón. This concept became a reality in December 2021, when it was recorded over a weekend in the Iglesia de la Congregación Evangélica Alemana de Buenos Aires in Argentina. The album consists of their own arrangements of selected works from J.S. Bach’s Well-Tempered Clavier Bk I and Bk II, and includes their own compositions in homage to Bach.\n\nThursday October 17 * 7pm * $15-20 * TICKETS\n\nChuck Johnson is a California-based composer, producer, and musician. He approaches his work with an ear towards finding faults and instabilities that might reveal latent beauty, with a focus on pedal steel guitar, experimental electronics, alternate tuning systems, and composing for film and television. Recordings of his work have been published by Western Vinyl, VDSQ, Thrill Jockey, Temporary Residence, Kompakt, Ghostly, and Three Lobed Recordings.\n\nAmadou Kouyate (DC) is the 150th generation of the Kouyate lineage and has studied and performed Manding music since the age of three years old. Amadou is a dynamic djembe and koutiro drummer. He also plays the 21-string kora, which he learned first with his father, Djimo Kouyate and other master Diali -- oral historians/musicians -- of Manding tradition in West Africa.\n\nSaturday October 26 * 7pm * $15 * TICKETS\n\nAdeline Hotel (NYC) - https://adelinehotel.bandcamp.com/album/hot-fruit\n\n\"One pleasure of following Dan Knishkowy’s music as Adeline Hotel in recent years is the way each album suggests something new, building on what came before, rather than making a drastic break. A record of folk songs (2020’s Solid Love) led to a set of solo guitar explorations (2021’s Good Timing) led to a suite of piano-led chamber music (The Cherries Are Speaking, 2021’s second Adeline album). Hot Fruit, his latest, continues that gradual trajectory while opening the widest new territory in his discography yet. While its jazzy and orchestral acoustic-guitar-led instrumentals may have surface-level precedent in canonical albums by Jim O’Rourke and more recent ones by William Tyler or Marisa Anderson, they ultimately operate on a wavelength all their own.\n\nNaima Bock\n\n\"Most of the writing of Naima Bock’s second album, Below A Massive Dark Land (out 27 September via Sub Pop), was a solitary affair. It may not sound it – it’s made up of strong, purposeful arrangements with a huge host of musicians; filled with cradling space and warm light. This will also come as a surprise to anyone who has seen Naima perform in the time since the release of her 2022 debut Giant Palm, undoubtedly a communal experience.\n\nWith a band of ten, three, or even just solo, when Naima plays there’s a rare bond between the musicians on stage and the audience. In their interview with her, The Quietus declared “after every song the applause and cheering is immense, so immense in fact that it seems to be coming from a different place than the usual formalities of a live show, a link between performer and artist forged somewhere deeper and more personal.”"
