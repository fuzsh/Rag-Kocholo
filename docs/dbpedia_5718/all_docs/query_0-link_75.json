        "text": "SEATTLE — It was a bright summer day here, but inside Shabazz Palaces’ studio, located in the Old Rainier Brewery building, it was dark as midnight. There were no windows, the walls were painted black, and the womblike interior was broken up only by a leopard-print rug. “Hip-hop should only take place at night,” said Palaceer Lazaro (real name: Ishmael Butler), 45, the mastermind of Shabazz Palaces, the eccentric experimental hip-hop act. “The parties, this, everything.”\n\nThat attitude could help explain the mysterious twilight sound of the band’s second full-length album, “Lese Majesty,” newly out on Sub Pop. The music is alternately languid and jarring, with melodies mutating or disappearing and Mr. Butler’s cryptic sci-fi raps often receding into the fabric. Almost everything about Shabazz Palaces seems slightly off-kilter, including their live performances, which have involved surrealistic masks and talk-show style interviews with the audience.\n\nWhile outsiders might think the city’s hip-hop scene revolves around the ubiquitous white rapper Macklemore, the reality is more idiosyncratic and diverse. Shabazz Palaces are part of Black Constellation, a collective of visual artists (Maikoiyo Alley-Barnes, Nicholas Galanin and Nep Sidhu, who creates their stage clothing), fashion designers and musicians, including the rapper OCnotes and the avant-R&B duo THEESatisfaction, who host a series of parties called Black Weirdo in Seattle, Toronto, New York and Minneapolis.\n\n“The world still doesn’t recognize that there is vibrant black culture here, because Seattle is thought of as such a white city,” said Riz Rollins, 60, a longtime D.J. for the city’s public radio station KEXP.\n\nDressed in an Eric André T-shirt, camouflage shorts and knee-high fuchsia and black socks, Mr. Butler was joined by the instrumentalist and producer Tendai Maraire, 40, the other half of the act. While Mr. Maraire agrees that the local hip-hop scene is diverse, “there’s no real hip-hop station at all in Seattle,” he said. “To get hip-hop, you’ve got to really search for it.”\n\nStill, the city has enough of a scene that the local blog 206up.com published a Top 10 list of Seattle hip-hop records in 2013, which included artists like the Physics, Nacho Picasso and the young M.C. Porter Ray, who is also signed to Sub Pop.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
