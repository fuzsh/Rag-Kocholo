        "text": "You are reading the page dedicated to the album. You may have been wanting to read about the song with the same name.\n\n\"Wiped Out!\" is the second studio album by American alternative band The Neighbourhood. It was released on October 30, 2015 by Columbia Records. In late 2020, the song \"Daddy Issues\" from the album went viral on the video sharing platform TikTok, along with \"Sweater Weather\", a song from the band's first studio album I Love You.\n\nThe album was certifed gold by the RIAA on March 23, 2021.\n\nCritical Reception[]\n\nThe album received mixed reviews among critics, Exclaim! writer Ryan B. Patrick called the album \"a see what sticks\" effort. \"it's slick and polished, but hits varying levels of satisfaction throughout\". Natasha West, from DIY called Wiped Out! \"a message of heartbreak, hope and heartfelt honesty\", adding \"having successfully mixed pop, rock and hip-hop together, it seems like they have finally defined their sound as a band\". Mojo Magazine stated, \"The LA quintet still sound like 16-year-old boys... Musically, though, their slick soulful pop-R&B is far more refined\". For Matt Collar, from AllMusic states that \"doesn't hurt that cuts like \"Cry Baby\" \"Daddy Issues\" and \"Greetings from Califournia\" counteract the band's somewhat downtempo vibe with catchy melodies and light, dance-oriented beats. As the black & white album cover illustration of a palm tree on a beach implies, this is surf music for street goths and beach bums with bad attitudes\".\n\nKenneth Partridge, from Billboard made reviews stating, \"The subtler, less stylized Wiped Out! keeps the palm-trees-at-twilight feel, but the sound is more hazy R&B than rock\". David Turner from Rolling Stone, also stated, \"the warmth of \"Sweater Weather\" and the rest of the Neighbourhood's debut album is gone on Wiped Out!, replaced by a ponderous kind of cool\". Uncut published a review calling the album \"a stylistic and conceptual vacuum.\"\n\nProfessional Ratings Aggregate scores Source Rating AnyDecentMusic? 5.5/10 Metacritic 53/100 Review scores Source Rating AllMusic 3/5 Billboard 3/5 DIY 3/5 Exclaim! 7/10 Mojo 3/5 Pitchfork 4.7/10 Rolling Stone 2.5/5 Uncut 3/10\n\nSingles[]\n\nPromotion[]\n\nThe following videos were made to promote two of the album's singles, R.I.P. 2 My Youth and Daddy Issues.\n\nArtwork[]\n\nTrack List[]\n\nNo. Title Writer(s) Producer(s) Length 1. \"A Moment of Silence\" Zach Abels, Jeremy Freedman, Brandon Fried, Mikey Margott, Jesse Rutherford 0:30 2. \"Prey\" Justyn Pilbrow, Fried, Rutherford 4e 4:42 3. \"Cry Baby\" Pilbrow, Rutherford 4e & Justyn Pilbrow 3:55 4. \"Wiped Out!\" Pilbrow, Rutherford 4e & Justyn Pilbrow 6:13 5. \"The Beach\" Fried, Pilbrow​, Rutherford 4e & Justyn Pilbrow 4:15 6. \"Daddy Issues\" Fried, Pilbrow, Rutherford 4e & Justyn Pilbrow 4:20 7. \"Baby Came Home 2 / Valentines\" Pilbrow, Fried 4e 6:30 8. \"Greetings From Califournia\" Fried, Pilbrow 4e & Justyn Pilbrow 4:04 9. \"Ferrari\" Fried, Pilbrow, Rutherford 4e & Justyn Pilbrow 3:04 10. \"Single\" Fried, Pilbrow, Rutherford 4e 4:22 11. \"R.I.P. 2 My Youth\" Pilbrow, Rutherford 4e, Justyn Pilbrow & benny blanco 3:25 Total length: 45:23"
