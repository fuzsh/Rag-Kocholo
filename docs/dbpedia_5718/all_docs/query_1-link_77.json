Grammy-winning music producer 9th Wonder is a member of the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame and a professor at NCCU and Duke University. The history runs deep, all the way back to 1968 when Durham-born Pigmeat Markham released what might just be the first rap song. Hillside High School alumna Rapsody has earned Grammy nominations in recent years and Kane Smego, DJ Skaz Digga and others boast ties to the Bull City.\n\nAward-Winning Icons\n\nBetween Grammy nominees, Hall of Famers, and legends in their own right, there are truly too many influential Durham musicians to try and name them all, but that's the point.

Here are our recommendations for how to do just that."
