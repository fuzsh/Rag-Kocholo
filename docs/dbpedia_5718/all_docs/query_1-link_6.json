        "text": "When I had more free time, I posted each day and it never grew weary. New post time!\n\nA warm welcome to you – music lover – if you are new to One Track At A Time, where we broaden our horizons by streaming songs of all styles and sizes. I am Jacob Braybrooke and it was previously my pleasure to write up about a different piece of music every day, but adult responsibilities are now in the way. Fear not, as I still have a small slab of leisure to post something special. Today, I am going to tell you about an excellent new release by a North Carolina-based electronic producer who goes by the name of Machinedrum. This is one of many monikers used by Travis Stewart, who fell in love with IDM and Glitch Hop sounds in the 2000’s. Syndrome and TStewart are two of his other aliases. He is also 1/2 of Sepalcure, 1/2 of JETS and 1/2 of Dream Continuum alongside Om Unit. His list of production credits and guest features are second to none – having worked with (*deep breath*) Flohio, Tkay Maidza, Freddie Gibbs, Sub Focus, Dawn Richard, Mykki Blanco and more. ‘3FOR82’ is his new LP out on Ninja Tune (The home of acts like Bicep, Yaeji and Park Hye Jin). Themed around childhood, Stewart made a unique request to his collaborators by asking them to write their segments as if they were writing to their younger selves. Some of his beats on the 12-track drum ‘n’ bass adventure were even lifted from some of his oldest teenager experiments, resulting in a low-quality fizz that artfully acknowledges the insecurities and inexperience that comes with being younger. One of the most ballsy experiments is the Hip Hop-oriented track ‘Weary’. Let’s give that record a spin below.\n\nStewart’s follow-up LP to 2020’s critically acclaimed album ‘A View Of U’ was crafted during a pilgrimage to Joshua Tree (a national park in California) and it finds him tapping into his network to recruit eclectic artists like Tinashe, Duckwrth, Topaz Jones, Deem Spencer and Aja Monet into his ranks as guest vocalists on the record. He explains, “I’ve been to Joshua Tree many times and I’ve always felt a great sense of clarity every time I visit“, in a press statement, adding, “and I knew that I should, at some point in my life, go out there to work on something creatively” to further establish the central theme of reconnecting with adolescence and harnessing nostalgia into your adult brand on the album. ‘Weary‘, which features rapper Mick Jenkins and Jamaican-born producer Jesse Boykins III as collaborators, is the perfect example of using childhood influences to kick a boost to a present product because it sounds so reminiscent of melodic and sample-driven 90’s Hip Hop records by artists such as The Jungle Brothers and Missy Elliot while maintaining a soft, futuristic Glitch element. A chopped drum beat kicks us off, reminiscent of a heavy Bhangra beat, before an arrangement containing a stretched vocal sample and a propulsive bass riff elevates the tension to another level. Fast and politically charged lyrics encouraging healing for people of disadvantaged, crime-ridden backgrounds are relentlessly recited at this stage, before a more soulful assortment of tender strings add a more hopeful element in the next verse. The chorus is more akin to a Thundercat or Blood Orange track due to the soulful vocal delivery by Boykins, but the momentum of the Hip Hop backing beat is still prominent due to the pace at which the framework of the melodic bass and the sharp drum rhythms are exposed. The sequencing by Machinedrum is, perhaps, the star of the show in this jam because the chopped element of the drums and samples add a specific seethe to proceedings. The slightly wonky rhythms veer noticeably into Hyper-Pop and Trap territory due to their irregular shaping, but the contorting production style keeps the foot on the gas for the connective tissue of Hip-Hop and Neo-Soul combined with electronic sounds. It all feels consistent enough, overall, without feeling too breezy as to dilute the aggressive edge of its impact. To conclude, ‘Weary‘ is a deeper cut on the album that you might read less coverage pushing as opposed to singles like ‘Rise’, but its a tough textbook example of twisting various elements of your production to meet your own needs while keeping your sound identifiable. A master of bending influences to his will, Machinedrum thrives in bringing the 90’s through the doors to modern clubs and encouraging you to make the past count by bridging the self-doubt of those times into a more motivated future.\n\nThat’s all for today! I want to say an enormous thank you for spending your time and attention with me. I will be back in a few days time with another new post regarding a Lo-Fi and Instrumental Rock singer-songwriter from an artist based in Brooklyn who has been releasing various projects throughout 2024 to celebrate his 20th anniversary of his music career since 2004. He was the founder of the Bad Channels Records label.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/OneTrackAtATime/\n\nTwitter: https://www.facebook.com/OneTrackAtATime/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jbraybrookerecords/\n\nEclectic & Electric (Radio Show): https://www.mixcloud.com/jacob-braybrooke/\n\nGood Morning to you! This is Jacob Braybrooke, and the time has come for me to give a shout-out to the Broolyn Ballers and each of the readers from elsewhere as we get prepared for yet another daily track on the blog, since it’s always my day-to-day pleasure to write up about a different piece of music every day! A self-described “Psychedelic Soul Savant” who was born in North-East India, now based between New York and Sydney, moved to New Zealand and Australia to spend his formative years there, later living in monasteries in Thailand and washed-out apartments in London, Jitwam is the co-founder of Chalo, an ambitious creative project alongside Dhruva Balram that supports up-and-coming Indian, Pakistani and Kashmiri artists, with a full-length self-titled album being released via The Jazz Diaries in 2020 that had its proceeds donated to the Human Rights Law Network and the Zindagi Trust. As a solo artist, however, he’s released a string of EP’s and a few albums, with 2019’s ‘Honeycomb’ serving as his latest LP. Jitwam has also collaborated with numerous artists including Dam Swindle, Mike Bloom and renowned Broken Beat maestro Kaidi Tatham. Other career highlights include his placements on Moodyman’s DJ-Kicks compilation series, embarking on a national NTS Radio tour in India, touring across the US and Europe, and opening a show for the acclaimed Funk virtuoso Roy Ayers with his full live backing band. His brand new single – ‘Brooklyn Ballers’ – is a one-off release from what I gather, but it offers an energetic ode to his passion for (just) one of the area’s that he has lived in throughout his eventful lifetime. Give it a spin below.\n\n“Brooklyn Ballers is a homage to the city in all its hustle and bustle“, Jitwam explains about the far-reaching notes of the track which are delivered below the soulful and radiant instrumentation, adding, “The magic in the air, that can make dreams come true and can turn your fears into your worst nightmares“, in his own single’s product description on the Bleep website. The opening reminds me of one of Skule Toyama or Night Tempo’s modern Chillwave records, where the summer atmosphere shines right through thanks to the raucous sampled guitar hook that induce the nostalgia of the 70’s Disco-Rock era, before the track soon evolves into more of a Detroit House style of record with additional elements of Hip-Hop and World Fusion music. The lead vocals have a spoken, but catchy and rhythmic, delivery to them where subtle nods to Guns ‘N’ Roses ‘Paradise City’ and Joe Smooth’s ‘Promised Land’ creep in due to the lyrics and the key song structure. A myriad of styles, including Psychedelic Soul and Vaporwave, make their way into the instrumental-driven sections of the track. Jitwam melds together the Gospel-esque backing vocals, some Madlib-style sampling and some Maribou State-style cues of World-Funk and Dub into the mix too to finalise the package, which plays out as a chilled soundtrack to his simple love for the location and a very deep, percussive groover that acts as an ode to some of New York’s most respected producers. The area’s energy is almost embodied by the Jazz inflections and the Detroit House influences, creating a laid back shuffle that gradually builds and draws upon various elements to expand it beyond the original state. A chef’s kiss.\n\nThat’s all for now! Thank you for checking out my latest blog post, and I’ll be ready to take you through a new entry of ‘New Album Release Fridays’ tomorrow as we take a quick preview of one of the weekend’s new and notable album releases. The record in question comes from the Prog-Jazz and Electronica sides of the Alternative Music spectrum by a duo made up of two members from The Comet Is Coming. The duo’s drummer has also toured with Sons Of Kemet, Melt Yourself Down, and Yussef Kamal.\n\nConnect with One Track At A Time:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/OneTrackAtATime/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/OneTrackAtATim1?fbclid=IwAR2demHDssZESnHDMi6gzTGNZJvdS42Ot930CA9Rttw7n4CJ5nvB8VJbWxE\n\nGood Morning to you! This is Jacob Braybrooke, and it’s time to walk in the light of a potential future star for yet another daily track on the blog, because it’s always my day-to-day pleasure to write up about a different piece of music every day! Making music is central to the coming-of-age story of the 24-year-old rapper, songwriter and producer Junior – whose real name is James Watkinson – who grew up recording a bunch of self-produced work while growing up in a summer cabin, being influenced by his surroundings to pen music about his career aspirations. Although he cites one moment where he got up on stage with Pharrell Williams as an adolescent fan as a definitive one in his career, Junior is becoming one of the best new kids on the block within the UK’s independent Hip-Hop and Grime music scenes for himself. He hails from a self-described “sleepy town” in Bedfordshire, located just outside of London, and his key influences include Jay Z, 90’s R&B and the supporting work of SBTV (An organisation based in London who promote emerging artists through their platform). ‘Lone Way Home’ is a fantastic new single by Junior, which was recently played by Tom Ravenscroft during a recent episode of The New Music Fix on BBC Radio 6 Music.\n\n“I look at music as a way to summarize my life, treating every release like a chapter of a book, starting with my first project, ‘Adolescence’ to my most recent, ‘When A Flower Blooms'”, Junior explains about the statement of intent that he intends to fearlessly communicate on the fresh single, explaining, “On a journey to find my own sound and become who I am meant to be, I have had to walk a long way home”, in a press statement. The wonky soundscape of the track is clearly noticeable from the offset, with a Chill Hop-oriented backing beat comprised of fluctuating Synths and a hazy, psychedelic inverted guitar hook that feels playful and, all the while, Junior uses sharp percussion and a gently cinematic range of Hip-Hop instrumentals to ground himself and think carefully about his songwriting for the material. Vocally, his flow is not too unfamiliar to fans of Eminem or Mac Miller, where he matches a smooth and melodic flow to the offbeat tune of the quirky Hip-Hop backdrop. Lyrics like “From a small town/Breaking walls down, you can guarantee I’m a find way” talk about his ambitions to live an adventurous career despite a less than ideal living situation for his desires and wishes. His songwriting manages to feel intimate, while drawing and expansive. The result is a track that feels equally anthemic as it does personal, with his fresh percussion and his confessional style of lyricism standing out in a Hip-Hop world plagued by Meme-targeting commercialism. There’s no auto-tune here in that sense, but there’s simply an inspiring ballad about taking a leap of faith regarding your next big step in your career and, for Junior personally, revealing your ambitions when the Hip-Hop world takes a hold of you. It gets his personality as an open-minded and well-mannered rapper across nicely, while also establishing some relatable themes for his audience that takes influence from the mildly differing styles of Hip-Hop across the spectrum. This is a great showcase for Junior’s abilities to write, produce and record his own music all at once. This could be a star of the future.\n\nThat brings me to the bottom of the page for another morning! Thank you for reading all about what I had to say about Junior today, and I will be back tomorrow to go ‘retro’ with a new entry of our weekly ‘Way Back Wednesdays’ feature on the blog. We will be revisiting a classic 80’s Arabic Pop/Dance track by a Cairo-based musician who is largely seen as the godfather of Al Jeel Music throughout Egypt and Libya. In 2011, he condemned the actions of Muammar Gadaffi – his native country’s then-leader, against the Libyan population and issued a plea to the fellow Egyptians to help them.\n\nConnect with One Track At A Time:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/OneTrackAtATime/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/OneTrackAtATim1?fbclid=IwAR2demHDssZESnHDMi6gzTGNZJvdS42Ot930CA9Rttw7n4CJ5nvB8VJbWxE\n\nGood Morning to you! This is Jacob Braybrooke, and it’s time to tune our ears to the more club-oriented gears of one of the modern day’s most progressive poets for ‘New Album Release Fridays’ with yet another daily track on the blog, because it’s always my day-to-day pleasure to write up about a different piece of music every day! An album about letting go and falling instead of anxiety into surrender, ‘The Line Is A Curve’ has been shaping up to be absolutely ace. This is the newest album from Kae Tempest, a poet from Westminster who has become a prominent name on BBC Radio 6 Music’s playlist throughout the 2010’s. Tempest came out as non-binary in 2020, shedding their former name of “Kate Tempest” and embracing the pronouns of they/them. Since becoming active in 2012, Tempest has been nominated for the Mercury Prize twice and they were nominated for ‘Best Female Solo Artist’ at the BRIT Awards in 2018. Outside of their music, Tempest is also a Sunday Times best-selling author and they won the ‘Breakthrough Author’ award at the Books Are My Bag Readers Awards in 2017. ‘The Line Is A Curve’ looks to repeat the success of these projects, and the BRIT School alumni mastered the record at Abbey Road Studios. It was produced by Dan Carey, which will become fairly obvious to you in a moment, executive produced by Rick Rubin and mixed by Christian Wright. The LP features guest contributions from artists like Lianne La Havas, Fontaines DC’s Grian Chatten, Confucius MC and more. The cover photograph was shot by Wolfgang Tillmans, who worked on Frank Ocean’s ‘Blonde’. Speaking about the collaborative process of the album in an interview for NME, Tempest says, “For me, this album is about increasing resilience and raising your threshold for tolerance and acceptance and it’s a very beautiful album, because so many people involved in making it are people that I’ve known and loved for a very long time”, and it is out today via Fiction Records. ‘More Pressure’ isn’t the latest pre-release single from the new record, but I chose to write about it because I feel it is a track that really showcases how Tempest can stretch that voice beyond traditional Spoken Word genre boundaries. It features a verse by Kevin Abstract – who you might also know from their music in Brockhampton. Give it a spin.\n\n“Throughout the duration of my creative life, I have been hungry for the spotlight and desperately uncomfortable in it. For the last couple of records, I wanted to disappear completely from the album covers, the videos, the front-facing aspects of this industry”, Tempest tells Brooklyn Vegan, later elaborating, “But this time around, I understand it differently. I want people to feel welcomed into this record, by me, the person who made it, and I have to let go of some of my airier concerns. I feel more grounded in what I’m trying to do, who I am as an artist and as a person and what I have to offer”, about their decision to include an image of themselves on the LP’s cover artwork for the first time. This sense of progression and comfort is replicated by ‘More Pressure’, which is anchored by abstract lyrics like “More pressure, more release, your eyes, your cheeks, your features crease” that communicate ideas of taking the weight of the world away from your shoulders and believing in your own body for reassurance. Lyrics like “One step forwards, two steps backwards/One soul’s epiphany, another soul’s madness” hits you with a more virtuosic nature, as Tempest talks about reach and distance through reflection, resulting in a sense of unsullied intimacy that is delivered in Tempest’s emotive space between music and speech. Abstract, as the featured credit, adds more intimacy to the final verse and trends towards a Hip-Hop direction, as the Synth beats become more liberating behind here. Speaking of the instrumentation, it feels interesting in not being a far cry from Sinead O’Brien’s ‘Kid Stuff’, a cracking tune by the Irish Post-Punk poet, in the similar sense of how the Dance-Rock influences come together through the insulating Synth rhythms. Instead of reaching out as most club-driven music does, however, Tempest looks inward to gain cues for the lyrics and reflect on the weight and stress in a relatively personal way. It certainly feels like some of Kae’s most accessible work, but the almost Disco-tempo melodies and the spacious bass lines still make their vocals stand out amongst the typically mainstream variety of modern music. Ultimately, ‘More Pressure’ is a strong showing that pin-points how Tempest can stretch their voice in fascinating ways to meet their own needs with the more rhythmic structure of the track and the idiosyncratic Dance influences that are still of Tempest’s heavy and reflective mood in prior releases, but the flow is simply much groovier and so it really stands out whenever you hear it on the radio. It is a really euphoric release of tension.\n\nThat brings us to the end of another daily post! Thank you for giving a moment out of your day to support the blog, and I will be back tomorrow to review some more new music from a recent favourite on the site. This Brighton-formed indie rock band were listed among the Top 40 New Artists of 2018 by The Guardian and their previous studio album – ‘Every Bad’ – was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 2020. It also appeared on year-end best lists by Under The Radar, Stereogum, Paste and Pitchfork.\n\nConnect with One Track At A Time:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/OneTrackAtATime/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/OneTrackAtATim1?fbclid=IwAR2demHDssZESnHDMi6gzTGNZJvdS42Ot930CA9Rttw7n4CJ5nvB8VJbWxE\n\nGood Morning to you! This is Jacob Braybrooke, and if you haven’t had your breakfast yet, it’s time to get your fill as we go retro with a 00’s British Dub/Hip-Hop classic as we go retro for ‘Way Back Wednesdays’ on the blog, where we revisit some of the seminal sounds of the past, because it’s always my day-to-day pleasure to write up about a different piece of music every day! Widely considered to be a reference to ‘Doctor Who’ with the intentionally similar melody to the sci-fi phenomenon’s main theme track, ‘Witness (1 Hope)’, released in 2001 by the Stockwell-born rapper and producer Roots Manuva, is a quintessential tribute to British cultural roots that was a stark contrast to the influences of Hip-Hop from the US that was prominent in most other UK hip-hop releases at that point. Infusing the track with Dancehall and Psych-Funk elements, Manuva garnered widespread acclaim for his diverse production and amusing lyricism with the UK Top 45 track. Manuva has since been described as “one of the most influential artists in British music history” by Vice as recently as 2016, having produced several well-acclaimed albums like 2008’s ‘Slime & Reason’, 2002’s ‘Dub Come Save Me’ and, in the case of today’s track, 2001’s ‘Run Come Save Me’. He has also collaborated with an extensive list of other artists including Charli 2na, Gorillaz, Fun Lovin’ Criminals, Beth Orton, DJ Shadow, Jamie Cullum, Leftfield, Nightmares On Wax and The Cinematic Orchestra throughout the years. Released on Big Dada in 2001, Manuva’s album breakthrough ‘Run Come Save Me’ earned him a MOBO Award for ‘Best Hip Hop Act’ of that same year. Q also listed the record as one of the best 50 albums of 2001, as Manuva was showered with praise from critics for his individual approach to contemporary Hip-Hop at the time and the uniquely British edge to his songwriting. These days, Roots Manuva is still fairly active. His latest album release was 2015’s ‘Bleeds’ and he headlined the Lounge On The Farm festival in Canterbury, Kent in 2019. Let’s remember the video for ‘Witness (One Hope)’ below.\n\nThe Mat Kirby-directed music video that you have just seen – which features Roots Manuva taking part in a sports day at his previous primary school that he truly attended in real life – is a bizzare piece, but it also gained similar acclaim from critics for it’s humorous scenes and original plot. Sports Day is also something that may mean nothing to schools from other countries, and so it really fits the vibe of his track’s point, in a weirdly fitting way. The track starts off with the aforementioned bass line that squelches and crackles to the tune of self-aware lyrics like “I sit here contented with this cheese on toast” and “We drown ten pints of bitter” that reference unquestionably British themes. The low-fidelity bassline has a downbeat, low-end pummeling quality and pulsating, throbbing rhythms that has a low-budget, DIY sense of production to it. On the Reggae front, there’s a fusion of organic Funk and heavy Dancehall going on here, with rickety and makeshift Dub sounds that Manuva claims was composed in protest to the poor quality of the sound systems being used in British night-clubs in the early 00’s, and the deliberate mimicry of the ‘Doctor Who’ theme track is another audacious jab at British popular culture while complementing the Spoken Word delivery of his half-rapped vocals. On the lyrical front, he uses sharp refrains like “I feel the pain of a third world famine, We count them blessings and keep jamming” to draw from diverse imagery of his Jamaican roots, and he’s never afraid to anglicize these ideas for wider accessibility while seeming self-conscious about it. Ultimately, ‘Witness (1 Hope)’ still holds up today as a wonderfully bizzare take on British-Jamaican male experiences and seeking identity in a multi-cultural environment, where the Dub influences feel as sharp as they are lovingly unsullied by the idea of perfection. The lyrics are still unique and innovative, while the track and video still pack an effective punch because of how amusing and engaging they both feel. It was wildly different to anything else at the time and it’s a track that, while holds an influence other modern DIY-style Hip-Hop tracks, also feels impossible to truly duplicate in the same way again. The most relatable element is how we all had to just survive Sports Day. Brilliant, and only he could get away with it.\n\nThat brings me to the end of another throwback post and, as always, thank you very much for supporting the site today. I’ll be back tomorrow, as we head across the shores to the US to review a recent single by a Brooklyn-based indie rock trio who will be performing at The Junction in Cambridge on March 30th. They have supported names like Pixies, Wolf Alice and Cherry Glazerr and they have released material on labels like Fat Possum Records and Mom + Pop Music. They gained the attention of critics with their sets at South By Southwest & CMJ Music Marathon in the mid-2010’s.\n\nConnect with One Track At A Time:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/OneTrackAtATime/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/OneTrackAtATim1?fbclid=IwAR2demHDssZESnHDMi6gzTGNZJvdS42Ot930CA9Rttw7n4CJ5nvB8VJbWxE\n\nGood Morning to you! This is Jacob Braybrooke, and the time has arrived for me to take you on a ride in my musical DeLorean as we pay a small tribute to one of the seminal sounds of the past for ‘Way Back Wednesdays’ on the blog, which fits my theme of writing up about a different piece of music every day! Comprised of MC’s Charli 2na (Charles Stewart), Akii (Dante Givens), Courtenay Henderson (Soup aka Zaakir), Marc 7 (Marc Stuart) and DJ’s/Producer’s Cut Chemist (Lucas McFadden) and DJ Nu-Mark (Mark Potsic) – Jurassic 5 were actually a six-piece crew who came out the Los Angeles venue of Good Life and they were trailblazers on the global hip-hop scene, both critically and commercially, throughout the late-1990’s and the 2000’s. They were very much known for being old school and proud of it, with their lyrics mixing braggadocio rhymes with simple tributes to the art form of Hip-Hop and street poetry itself. There were no over-produced auto-tune melodies, no blatant money-waving, obvious misogyny, no outrageous grand-standing and just a sprinkling of swearing – but they simply packed out live sets throughout the UK and the US by encouraging a live crowd to get on their feet and interact with them, with most of their success coming directly from good word-of-mouth and a mixture of sought-after EP releases, to start off with, that were initially only available through Import in the UK. They had hits including ‘What’s Golden?, ‘The Influence’ and ‘Quality Control’ that made the likes of Charli 2na and Cut Chemist household names. Their highest-charting single in the UK is ‘Concrete Schoolyard’, which reached #35 and it was taken from their debut self-titled album released in 1998, but it also appeared on the self-titled EP release from a year prior. The Jurassic 5 logo’s that you can find on the front cover of the EP and the album were designed by Charli 2na himself, and NME named the album as their 9th best from 1998. Let’s play on the ‘Concrete Schoolyard’ below.\n\nAlthough they offered something fresh to many listeners of all backgrounds, Jurassic 5 decided to call it ‘Quits’ in 2007 shortly after releasing their fourth studio album – ‘Feedback’ – citing creative differences as the reason, yet they returned to the stage and recorded some new material for a reunion during 2013 and 2014, and each member of the band has continued to release new music individually. As for ‘Concrete Schoolyard’, the core ethos of their message was “Let’s take it back to the concrete streets/Original beats from real live MC’s” as they aimed to provide their freshest Hip-Hop sound yet. At the time, Hip-Hop was decidedly either Dance Pop-oriented or Grunge-influenced in terms of visceral production, and so Jurassic 5 naturally decided to keep it simply by incorporating thick and floating Piano chords into their backing beats on ‘Concrete Schoolyard’ with a kick drum beat that makes the soundscape feel warm, but making for a slower tempo than a typical Hip-Hop release where elements of Soul and Baroque can peek in. It is melodic enough, however, with a final breakdown that increases the danceability of the recording. Refrains like “Playground tactics/No rabbit-in-the-hand tricks/Just that classic rap S**t from Jurassic” also provide a clear sense of clarity as the Alternative Hip-Hop collective make it their mission statement to disregard sleight of hand tricks or conform to pre-conceptual trends and place a larger emphasis on their influences instead. In conclusion, on ‘Concrete Schoolyard’ – which was reportedly recorded with Dave Matthews of all artists – Jurassic 5 were admittedly good and they were a much-needed breath of fresh air. There was no tropes and no tricks, just good old-fashioned MC’s with a solid sense of slight satire which was a clean cut above the rest.\n\nThat’s all for now! Thank you lots for checking out the blog that I’ve been working on today, and I’ll see you again later as we break down some more brand new music. Tomorrow, we’ll be listening to the album announcement track from a brand new artist who is based in London but originally hails from Calabar, Nigeria. He does a lot of interesting things with Afrobeat and his 2020 EP ‘Which Way Is Forward?’ landed a spot on my Top 5 EP’s list of that year, and he’s recently collaborated with Little Simz.\n\nConnect with One Track At A Time:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/OneTrackAtATime/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/OneTrackAtATim1?fbclid=IwAR2demHDssZESnHDMi6gzTGNZJvdS42Ot930CA9Rttw7n4CJ5nvB8VJbWxE\n\nGood Morning to you! You’re tuned into One Track At A Time and you are reading the words of Jacob Braybrooke, and I’m here to present yet another daily track to your eardrums on the blog, since it’s always my day-to-day pleasure to write up about a different piece of music every day! One voice that you need to hear right now is the husky vocals of Eddington Again, a multi-instrumentalist and producer who fans of Yves Tumor or Alfa Mist are likely going to get a little kick out of. Currently based in Berlin, but native to Los Angeles, Eddington Again’s music typically dabbles in sound collage elements with Post-Rock and Noise-Rock influences to form a crescendo of Experimental Rock soundscapes which tackle a diversity of personal and intimate themes courageously. Eddington began their musical career as a crucial figure in LA’s queer underground, and they have cited. Bloc Party, SZA, Santigold and Sampha as a handful of their biggest influences. In addition to this, they have performed alongside Flume, Charli XCX and Dam Funk on the live touring circuit. Support has also poured in from i-D Magazine, Mixmag and Boiler Room 4:3 over the years since Eddington first surfaced in 2015 as an emerging artist. One of their strongest singles is ‘Petrify’, which was recently featured on an episode of BBC Radio 6 Music’s ‘The New Music Fix’ curated by Tom Ravenscroft – the son of the late-great BBC Radio 1 host John Peel. It arrives via Friends Of The New – a division of Majestic Casual. Let’s check it out below.\n\n‘Petrify’ was accompanied by a cinematic music video that was directed by fellow LA-native artist 011668, a close friend of Eddington’s back home, and Eddington brings context to the single by stating, “Petrify is a story based on experiences dealing with fragility in lovers and the people closest to me”, in a press note, explaining, “Not having a place to fully be transparent about my past, gifts and heightened awareness leading me to dwell and cultivate my power alone in the dark”, in their own words. Starting off with a dark tone, Eddington pulls us into their haunting flood of emotions with “I don’t wanna petrify you, I just want to tell you my secret” with a half-spoken and half-rapped delivery that is paired to a driving, but ethereal, guitar sample and a percussive drum work-out that is played on a loop continuously, conveying the disorientation that Eddington feels when they expose others to their own fragility. Shuffling hi-hats and a snappy, stuttering Snare pick up the nervous energy of Eddington’s voice that leaps and bounds around a hazy Baritone vocal that floats between reverb-drenched guitar strums to the motion of soulful R&B beats that complement his vocals with a mix of tender emotion and a sense of danger. The abstract visuals of the attached music video are compelling too, but there’s a great mix of straight to-the-point lyrics and a brisk pace to the instrumentation that make the emotive layers feel convincing, with Eddington’s vocals eventually breaking into a lovesick croon as the sonic production becomes more energized and the rhythm becomes a floating mix of underground dance influences and light Hip-Hop intricacies. Overall, ‘Petrify’ represents Experimental Pop at it’s most effective, with the track showcasing the knack for emotive lyrics that Eddington has and a very unique fusion of influences that bound together to create an intimate, gripping single.\n\nThank you for checking out my latest post on the blog, and please feel free to join me again tomorrow as we take an in-depth look at one of the weekend’s hottest new album releases by sampling a single from it and, this time, we’re listening to a single that was recently promoted by KEXP’s Song Of The Day podcast. The album itself comes from a bold Danish film composer who once headlined the Orange Stage at Roskilde Festival in front of 60,000 people with a set design created by Henrik Vibskov.\n\nConnect with One Track At A Time:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/OneTrackAtATime/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/OneTrackAtATim1?fbclid=IwAR2demHDssZESnHDMi6gzTGNZJvdS42Ot930CA9Rttw7n4CJ5nvB8VJbWxE\n\nGood Morning to you! You’re tuned in to One Track At A Time with your regular writer Jacob Braybrooke, and you are right on time for yet another daily track on the blog, given that it’s always my day-to-day pleasure to write up about a different piece of music every day! We finally move into February shortly, as we complete our various ‘First Month Of The Year’ challenges, but one of the albums that really seemed to strike a chord with critics and audiences alike in January was ‘SICK’, the new 10-track mixtape-style LP offering by Chicago-born and Los Angeles-based Hip Hop artist Earl Sweatshirt, who began his rap career as Sly Tendencies in 2008 and later joined the alternative Hip-Hop collective Odd Futures – led by Tyler, The Creator – to cause a name change in 2009. ‘SICK’ had an enigmatic promotional campaign heading in to release, despite a few singles being unveiled prior to release, and it has garnered an impressive score of 86/100 on Metacritic. Kitty Empire wrote that it was “a musically rich reset” in her four-star review for The Guardian, while a perfect review by Marcus Shorter for Consequence In Sound hails it up with “The rapping is impeccable, and the project doesn’t overstay its welcome” in his rave assessment. Sweatshirt has also recently performed a single taken off the ‘SICK’ LP – ‘2010’ – live on ‘The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon’ in the US, and so the appeal of the record isn’t incredibly far outside of the mainstream. One of the singles – ‘Tabula Rasa’ – features the critically acclaimed New York-based duo of Armand Hammer (ELUCID & Billy Woods) who wax poetic lyrics while politely taking their turn above the ethereal Piano melody and some fragmented sampling that create a dense backdrop for their individual truths to lethargically spit over their collective public manifesto. It also comes with a uniquely unpolished music video that finds the three producers make their Lo-Fi magic happen in the recording studio, or – in the case of Woods – grilling some ribs, by the look of it.\n\n“Sick is my humble offering of 10 songs recorded in the wake of the worldwide coronavirus pandemic and its subsequent lockdowns”, Earl Sweatshirt tells the music press, explaining, “Before the virus, I had been working on an album I named after a book I used to read with my mother (‘The People Could Fly’). Once the lockdowns hit, people couldn’t fly anymore. A wise man said art imitates life. People were sick. The People were angry and isolated and restless. I leaned into the chaos ’cause it was apparent that it wasn’t going anywhere. These songs are what happened when I would come up for air”, in his press release for the ‘SICK’ record. In the case of ‘Tabula Rasa’, it is vital to note that this Latin phrase roughly translates to ‘Blank Slate’ in English, and so it is believable that Sweatshirt and his two partners are rapping about how we are all born without any mental knowledge on the ambiguous minimalist rap jam, with the two outfits trading sequences like “This game of telephone massive/I do what I have to with the fragments” that each convey feelings of urgency and calming processes as the rappers reflect on how the dread of the Covid-19 pandemic affected their lyrical musings of truth as the remedy for the problems that arise. Challenging lyrics like “I have to write to find balance” and “I watch re-runs in the dark, fingers and lips glistening” also simplify the matters of mental health issues and how we find our humanity through mundane tasks that we still enjoy doing, like how “I made chicken late night in my boxers/Burning up the kitchen” nearly ends the final verse on a slightly witty note and how the small details of this action convey something more profound about how we treat ourselves to small luxuries when we’re all alone to remind ourselves of how important that we are. While there’s a lot that we could discuss lyrically, the instrumentation is noticeably more restrained and subdued. The sampling is psychedelic and smart, with mere teasers of voice clips and broken-sounding Vinyl cracks that briefly divert the groove away from the scattered, soulful sample of a 70’s Jazz Club performance setting, giving off the effect that we’re listening to a broken record as the audience. The intricate wordplay is the emphasis of the beat, with the three rappers creating some subtle verses with an interchanged dynamic between the three of them where lessons of finding wisdom and ruminating upon remedies with a grit-laced but positively weighty sense of resolution. Overall, while this is a challenging listen, at first, because the structure is created by a few straightforward stream-of-consciousness rap verses instead of a melodic series of hooks, Sweatshirt still manages to pull off a richly rewarding feel with the cerebral style of production because it feels personal and laidback, and he works towards achieving this dense balance of wordsmith lyricism and minimalist instrumentals by leaning into a hypnotic delivery, rather than simply acting as a purveyor of clear tone.\n\nThat’s all that I currently have lined up for you today, and thank you very much for taking the time to look at an interesting piece of new art with me today. I’ll be back tomorrow to bring some music from 2021 back to your attention, and it comes from a London-born singer-songwriter, DJ, radio presenter, model and actress who has run a popular monthly night called ‘Soul Box’ in East London with fashion photographer Dean Chalkley and the British DJ Eddie Piller, who is the founder of Acid Jazz Records.\n\nConnect with One Track At A Time:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/OneTrackAtATime/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/OneTrackAtATim1?fbclid=IwAR2demHDssZESnHDMi6gzTGNZJvdS42Ot930CA9Rttw7n4CJ5nvB8VJbWxE\n\nGood Morning to you! This is Jacob Braybrooke, and the time has come for us to take a break away from the new year of new music releases by revisiting a small sample of the seminal sounds of the past as we go ‘Way Back’ for Wednesday on yet another daily track on the blog, given that it is my day-to-day pleasure to write up about a different piece of music every day! A late-1990’s and early 00’s Alternative Rock group who have been remembered as “The self-destructive pop saboteurs who did it all wrong in all the right ways” by James McMahon, a writer for NME, in 2018 – The Beta Band are the rare case of a band that were, perhaps, a little misunderstood by the contemporary critics of their heyday, and they have only really been seen as highly influential in more modern times. Known for their experimental blend of Folktronica, Trip Hop, Plunderphonics, Psychedelic Rock and Progressive Pop, The Beta Band were praised by Oasis and Radiohead, eventually opening up for their live shows in 2001 and went on to build a healthy cult status with audiences alike. In 2001, in a very strange coincidence, both The Beta Band and Sheffield-based indie pop duo I, Monster decided to add a vocoder and some beats to The Gunter Hallam’s Choir’s ‘Daydream’ to form their own sample-based tracks of ‘Squares’ and ‘Daydream In Blue’, respectively, and the tracks melodies seem similar enough at first glance as to listeners being confused between the two but, upon a further inspection, ‘Squares’ has a more edgy, nightmarish feel in comparison to I, Monster’s more commercially successful adaptation of the 60’s piece. It was taken from The Beta Band’s sophomore album – ‘Hot Shots II’ – which was included in the 2010 edition of the book ‘1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die’ and it also reached #13 on the UK Albums Chart and it was co-produced by Colin Emmanuel. Let’s revisit the music video below.\n\nThe Beta Band’s music was memorably featured in a scene of the 2000 Romantic Comedy/Drama hybrid movie ‘High Fidelity’ that was based on the Nick Horny-authored novel of the same title. In an iconic clip from the film, a record store owner portrayed by John Cusack states “I will now sell five copies of The Three EP’s by The Beta Band” and he dances around to a full minute or so of ‘Dry The Rain’, a scene that exposed the cult Scottish group to a wide range of new listeners, especially in the US and internationally, and so there’s a fun slice of trivia for you. Back to the task at hand, we start with the immediately familiar lyrics of “I’ve seen the demons, but they didn’t make a sound” and “They tried to reach me, but I lay upon the ground” that get repeated later on, with Steve Mason sounding positively forlorn as he murmurs about seeing darkness trying to control him. You get the sense right away that things are off, with a very glitched Hip-Hop beat meandering and playing with the pitch of the melodies by itself, and a traditional beat only forms barely until the iconic String loop of the sampled track bursts through. The iconic lyrics of “Daydream, I fell asleep beneath the flowers” and “I saw miles and miles of squares, where’s the feeling there?” are met with Faust-like towered Drum backing beats and a neat Kosmiche guitar solo in the final half, forming an ankle-deep Electronica groove that is disorienting textually, almost as if Mason is simply wending through a humid fog but he is neither cynical or clueless. ‘Squares’ by The Beta Band and, also, ‘Daydream In Blue’ by I-Monster have two nearly identical hooks, but while ‘Daydream In Blue’ came and went a little more after it’s initial impact on pop culture, this revision of the sampled track by The Beta Band feels remembered more often, and I think that it has stuck simply because of a better use of sampling. ‘Daydream In Blue’ was memorable for adding a vocoder and a beat-driven style to the track, but that was largely it. However, ‘Squares’ just has more depth to it when you read between the lines. It features the usual hallmarks of The Beta Band in terms of it’s Radiohead-like experimental rock approach, but it also feels more minimalist in it’s light blending of R&B, Hauntology and Hip-Hop elements that are small, but stand out. The darkly psychedelic sounds feel like they’re playing off what you’ve heard before to give it a more nightmarish context that comes with the alienated fear of an awful acid trip. The risk pays off, and we get a half-remembered track that feels strong for this effect.\n\nThat’s all for today! Thank you for being the companion to my Doctor Who with our throwback post today, and I’ll be back tomorrow with some more music, of the fresh variety, that you’re hopefully going to enjoy. We’re looking at a recent single from the London-born DJ and Writer Chris Menist, who began the project of Awkward Corners when he was living in Islamabad. His releases have since spanned record labels like Boomkat, and early recordings were made with local artists from Thailand & Pakistan.\n\nConnect with One Track At A Time:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/OneTrackAtATime/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/OneTrackAtATim1?fbclid=IwAR2demHDssZESnHDMi6gzTGNZJvdS42Ot930CA9Rttw7n4CJ5nvB8VJbWxE\n\nGood Morning to you! You are tuned into the text of Jacob Braybrooke, as we ready ourselves for yet another daily track on the blog, since it’s always been my day-to-day pleasure to write up about a different piece of music every day! Music you may have missed from last year headlines the page today, and it comes your way from an Ottawa-based Canadian experimental electronic dance music duo known for blending Ethnotronica, Moombahton, Reggae and the ‘Brostep’ term of post 2000’s Dubstep with elements of First Nations music, particularly known for their vocal chanting and high-speed drumming – and their name is The Halluci Nation. It wasn’t always that way, however, as the band used to be titled A Tribe Called RED, a homage to the legendary Hip-Hop group A Tribe Called Quest. Last year, however, they decided to scrap their old alias in light of “as we move into this next phase of our evolution, we also find it necessary to remember our past”, in their own words. Now a duo comprised of Tim Hill and Ethren Thomas, their name is a phrase borrowed from activist/artist John Trundell to “describe the vast global community of people who remember at their core what it means to be human”, in Trundell’s quote. The group describe their own style of music as a “Stadium Pow-Wow” sound, which is a style of contemporary club music for urban First Nations (A society of Canadian indigenous people who are classified distinctly from the Metis and Inuit groups). My first experience with The Halluci Nation was hearing their stellar third album, ‘We Are The Halluci Nation’, released in 2016. The follow-up, ‘One More Saturday Night’, was self-released last July, which finds the duo collaborating with the likes of Black Bear, The Beat and Northern Voice – some of which they have frequently recorded material with before. The band’s latest album pays tribute to the Electric Pow-Wow gatherings at Ontario’s Babylon nightclub the group ran between 2007 and 2017. Hear more about their change of identity below and skip to 1:05 to hear the new track ‘It’s Over’ below.\n\n“We wanted to pay homage to the Electric Pow Wow and wrap that whole decade of the experience up and close the cycle, and in doing so give direct co-ordinates of where the future was headed. In a nutshell, that’s what this album is about”, says co-founder Ehren “Bear Witness” Thomas in a press release, explaining, “We just wanted to make a party record, as well, one that people could dance to while still having the strong message we are known for”, about the planning and recording behind the record. Going for a more psychedelic take on their older material, Hill and Thomas combine stretched samples of vocal chants performed by Chippewa Travellers with EDM-inflicted Dubstep to explore the memories of the club nights that brought their Canadian community of indigenous people together back in the 2000’s, but the ferocious pace of the brisk Drums also imply a regret concerning the abrupt disbandment of the Babylon nightclub’s scenes. Some fragmented Synth effects are sprinkled throughout the song that evokes the vibrant nostalgia and anti-colonialism surrounding the club nights. Meanwhile, the driving melodies of the instrumentation are there to remind you that it is a positive dance record, as their signature style of moulding Septia-toned vocals from Chippewa Travellers together with visceral drum and bass melodies that set things into motion with a commanding Bassline, while the trickling Trap snares and the some declarative EDM drums that gradually incorporate reverb-drenched Dub and righteous vocal chants into the equation. ‘It’s Over’ suffers from repetition a little, but it does a fantastic job of spreading the message that forms the emotive core of the album that breathes new life into a memory or dream that settler colonialism and its extractive violence have attempted to erase, and ‘It’s Over’ provides a club-heavy but contemplative moment that gives the affirmations and goals of The Halluci Nation a reasonable amount of space to take root, as the band continue to cement themselves as one that needs to exist to serve the social purpose.\n\nI have previously shined a small spotlight on The Halluci Nation before their rebranding, with a detailed post about another track that aims to get more indigenous people represented in the media. Find out more about ‘The OG’ here: https://onetrackatatime.home.blog/2020/01/13/todays-track-a-tribe-called-red-feat-black-bear-the-og/\n\nThat’s everything I’ve got lined up for you today! I’m still working on my year-end Albums list of 2021 and it is coming soon. In the meantime, thanks for checking out my latest post, and I’ll be back tomorrow to get you re-acquainted with a Grammy-nominated Texas-born Jazz artist and a Houston trio who host the ‘AirKhruang’ radio show on Facebook Live and NTS Radio. They will be releasing a direct sequel to their earlier collaborative EP ‘Texas Sun’ on 18th February through the Dead Oceans label.\n\nConnect with One Track At A Time:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/OneTrackAtATime/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/OneTrackAtATim1?fbclid=IwAR2demHDssZESnHDMi6gzTGNZJvdS42Ot930CA9Rttw7n4CJ5nvB8VJbWxE"
