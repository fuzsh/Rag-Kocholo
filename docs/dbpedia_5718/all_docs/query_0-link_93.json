Thereâs something for everyone, including activities for kids.\n\nWhat to Bring? Youâll be âcamping outâ in neighborhood front lawns for 30-40 minutes at a time, so bring chairs or a blanket to sit on. If you want to see as many bands as possible, a bike is a great idea.\n\nWhat to Eat & Drink? Larchmere Blvd. and Shaker Square have many restaurants to choose from. There will also be vendors and a food court for additional food options. Youâre welcome to bring food, but please pick up any trash you may create.\n\nWhere to Go for Info? Be sure to pick up a printed schedule and map for the day, buy t-shirts and learn about the neighborhood at our info tent located at the corner of E 127th Street and Larchmere. Restrooms available here.\n\nVolunteer at PorchFest\n\nHow can I help? PorchFest would love for you to get involved! You can sign up to volunteer the day of the event or help plan the event by joining a committee.\n\nPerform at PorchFest\n\nCan I play at Larchmere PorchFest? PorchFest is run by volunteers and we consider as many bands as we are capable of reviewing. Our goal is to feature a broad range of musical genres and artists at a local level.\n\nPlease Be Respectful\n\nWe ask that all who attend PorchFest are respectful to one another."
