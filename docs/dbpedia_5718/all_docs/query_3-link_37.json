The album features a range of styles, from the hardcore East Coast sound of “Hypnotize” to the smooth R&B of “Mo Money Mo Problems.” The album succeeded commercially, solidifying Biggie as one of the greatest rappers ever.\n\n“Life After Death” was released weeks after Biggie Smalls was tragically murdered in a drive-by shooting in Los Angeles.\n\nThe album’s lyrics shed light on Biggie’s life growing up in Brooklyn and his rise to fame as a rapper. For example, in “Somebody’s Gotta Die,” Biggie raps about a violent altercation he witnessed as a child. Also, in “My Downfall,” he reflects on his struggles with the law and the pressures of the music industry.\n\nOther tracks, such as “Niggas Bleed” and “I Got a Story to Tell,” weave cinematic tales of drug deals gone wrong and steamy affairs with married women, respectively. “I Got a Story to Tell” also includes one of our favorite Utah Jazz references in hip-hop. “I Including an affair with a wife of a former New York Knick.\n\nDespite its often dark subject matter, “Life After Death” is notable for its playful humor and irreverent spirit.

The album features Madlib’s eclectic and off-kilter beats and DOOM’s intricate and dense rhymes, making it a landmark in underground hip-hop.\n\nThe creation of “Madvillainy” was a unique collaborative effort between MF DOOM and Madlib. The two exchanged music back and forth as they worked on the album. According to MF DOOM, the collaboration began when Madlib sent him a beat tape with over 40 instrumentals. MF DOOM immediately began writing rhymes over the beats. The two artists then started sending tracks back and forth, with Madlib sending DOOM beats and DOOM sending back finished verses and songs.\n\nThis collaborative process allowed the two artists to work independently and experiment with different sounds and ideas. As a result, Madlib’s production on the album includes obscure samples and unconventional drum patterns. At the same time, MF DOOM’s rhymes are dense and intricate, full of complex wordplay and vivid imagery. The resulting album is a masterpiece of experimental hip-hop, with its unique blend of abstract beats and complex lyricism.\n\nMadlib and MF DOOM’s collaborative album “Madvillainy” is often cited as a pioneering work in the lo-fi hip-hop genre, emphasizing low-fidelity or “imperfect” sound quality as a stylistic choice. The lo-fi aesthetic has become increasingly popular in recent years, with countless artists drawing inspiration from Madlib and MF DOOM’s work on “Madvillainy.”\n\nOne of the defining characteristics of the lo-fi sound is the use of samples and field recordings that are deliberately distorted or degraded, often to create a vintage or nostalgic feel. The production on “Madvillainy” incorporates these elements heavily, with Madlib often sampling obscure jazz and funk records, distorting them heavily to create a gritty, rough-edged sound. MF DOOM’s rhymes, meanwhile, often use unconventional flows and obscure references, adding to the album’s peculiar feel.\n\nThe influence of “Madvillainy” on the lo-fi beat aesthetic can be seen in the work of countless producers and artists who have incorporated similar elements into their own music. This album truly represents what makes a classic hip-hop album. Sadly, MF DOOM passed away in 2020.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMarch has released some of the most influential and groundbreaking hip-hop and R&B albums ever. From the pioneering sounds of Run-D.M.C. to the introspective lyricism of Gang Starr, these albums have helped to shape and define the genres and continue to inspire and influence new generations of artists."
