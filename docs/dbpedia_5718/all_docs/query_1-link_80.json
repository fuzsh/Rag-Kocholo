        "text": "Whether by chance or by an intrinsic joining of tenets, the fusion of the samurai ethos and hip-hop culture has become a remarkable revelation of music meeting the mythical. Though seemingly miles apart and historically divided, these aspects of culture have recently become intertwined through art and craft. Musical artists such as Wu-Tang Clan and sensei RZA have voiced how their experience with samurai culture has informed their artistic endeavours. Beloved animes such as Shinichirō Watanabe’s Samurai Champloo have explored the fusion of hip-hop and samurai to a fundamental extent - chiefly through late music producer Nujabes, and Fat Jon’s, acclaimed soundtrack. While experimental hip-hop producer, Flying Lotus is set to provide the music for Netflix’s upcoming Yasuke animation; a series based on the historical African samurai.\n\nBlending urban street attitudes with the historical mythos of the revered Japanese warriors; the explosion of samurai meeting hip-hop is rapidly becoming its own subgenre of film and anime. A cultural collision of seemingly the utmost disparity, yet, one that fuses passionately, and produces impressive feats of kickass content.\n\nThere is an incredible appetite to create newfound art through the coalescence of these cultures while recognising that their origins are arguably poles apart; hip-hop being the great culmination of innovation and artistry in Black communities in America, in the 1970s, and samurai being the legendary Japanese warriors of old. Filmmaker Jim Jarmusch explores this fusion in a modern setting, enlisting the help of RZA to imbue his urban samurai story, Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai with a musical, streetwise, flair. With beats of hip-hop, rap and traditional Japanese instruments, RZA’s soundtrack seamlessly fuses aspects of Black culture in urban America with that of Japanese samurai. Moreover, in Takashi Okazaki’s cult manga-turned-anime Afro Samurai, we witness a Black samurai seeking vengeance for the death of his father, in a techno-Orientalist world, where again the product is informed by a hip-hop soundtrack [by RZA]. This fusion of music, inherently Black and rooted in 20th century New York, with centuries-old Japanese history is one of unexpected cohesion and unprecedented success.\n\nRZA excels at creating a resonant sound to accompany Afro’s journey to the top, the tenacity it takes to get there and the sacrifices he must make along the way. In an interview with Medium in 2018, RZA illuminates that “Forces in the world will tell you you’re a victim — of your family, your race, your past, your history. Don’t believe them. They don’t know you. Look inside and find your true self. Even if your body is going through hell, your mind doesn’t have to be”. Listening to the Afro Samurai soundtrack feels like listening to a grand epithet of this very idea; a concept album in which a broken hero, who desires power in a world where power can get you killed at any moment, suffers through loss and derailment but eventually ends up on top. In a sense, it could even be argued that RZA’s journey to stardom reflects that of Afro’s quest for justice. As a musician and rapper who emerged from a life of petty crime on the streets of Brooklyn, New York, and would later go on to dominate the burgeoning world of hip-hop in the 90s; the Wu-Tang Clan founder’s sentiment arguably adds a thematic layer to Afro’s quest and journey from helplessness to power. You could conceivably exchange the music for a story about gang wars on the streets of Brooklyn and it’d still work thematically. RZA’s essential soundtrack is an endlessly cool feat of musical mastery and one that excels even more so in the sequel movie; imbuing a tonal consistency and thematic resonance to the overall mania of the world of Afro Samurai.\n\nWhen discussing the fusion of samurai ethos with that of hip-hop culture, it becomes duly apparent the notable impact in which the former has, and continues to have, on the latter, and vice versa. It seems that the Black-led genre of music lends itself to samurai just as the latter has, in part, inspired the former. With Ghost Dog, RZA’s soundtrack works in tandem with the urban landscapes of Jarmusch’s modern samurai film. In Champloo, Nujabes and co. establish a turntable flow to bring the exceedingly historical samurai story firmly into the contemporary. In Afro Samurai, RZA masters both, producing and curating a pertinent mix of beats that both modernise and revolutionise the dominant structures of samurai film, while dissecting anime and Japanese history concurrently.\n\nYet, in order to fully explore this incredible fusion of cultures, its historical inspirations must come under inspection. For example, as mentioned, hip-hop - a musical revelation that finds its roots in the blues, soul music, as well as the urban atmospheres of The Bronx, New York City - is an inherently a Black creation. Formed in the underground scene as a result of low-income families being unable to afford traditional musical instruments, and thus, using what they could - music records and turntables - to create newfound beats from generally sampled material and innovative vigour. Hip-hop came from the underground, and like many of its samurai-fused stories, rocketed to the top of popular culture and became a mainstream art form that everybody and their mothers consume.\n\nAs a historical figure who, as a slave, was brought to the shores of Japan over 500 years ago, leaving his Portuguese masters to enlist with Oda Nobunaga - a powerful 16th Century Japanese feudal lord - and later achieving the status of samurai warrior; Yasuke is arguably an inspiration for many of the aforementioned works. While centuries apart from the creation of hip-hop, Yasuke’s legacy is one of liberation, determination, skill and loyalty. Sound familiar? His tale - while relatively unknown in the larger scope of samurai legend - feels like the groundwork for films such as Ghost Dog and the manga/anime of Afro Samurai. Whether purposeful or not, Yasuke, who fought alongside Nobunaga in many important battles, seems to be a great influence on many tales of samurai ethos meeting Black cultures. And with a prospective anime series from Netflix about the historical figure, which is set to feature the venerable Lakeith Stanfield as the legendary warrior, as well as a soundtrack from experimental hip-hop producer, Flying Lotus, Yasuke’s legacy continues to influence creators thusly.\n\nHowever, in researching Yasuke and the significant influence his life and legacy has had and continues to have, on the world of music, film and animation, we realised that our passion could only stretch so far. As a mysterious and largely undocumented figure of history, we realised that to explore this subject to a greater extent would mean bringing in a more experienced voice on the matter. Which is where Elias Williams comes in.\n\nHey Elias, how’s it going?\n\nHey Simon, not too bad, all things considered.\n\nElias is an up-and-coming filmmaker, currently studying for his Masters in History at the University of Bristol.\n\nHow’s lockdown treating you?\n\nCan’t complain, I’ve been hunkering down in Oxford for the time being, saving on rent and working with Timon on a new film.\n\nAlong with his brother and collaborator, Timon, Elias has written and directed a selection of short films, including the self-aware satire, Best Short Film Ever.\n\nSo, you’ve been able to stay productive even under the strain of Covid-19?\n\nYeah, well mostly. From about May to June, we were able to put together a feature piece, about 70 pages long. We ended up shooting in September, quite locally actually, with friends and collaborators. It’s basically a coming of age drama, based in Oxford, about some of the funny stuff that we used to get up to when we were younger. It’s been fun.\n\nSo, let’s talk about Samurai Blood. In your own words, how would you describe the film?\n\nSamurai Blood is essentially my graduate film. It’s the film that I made for my undergraduate filmmaking course at UWE (University of the West of England). It’s a project that I was very passionate about and wanted to tell for a while. And as my final year loomed, things began to fall into place and I realised I had to make it before finishing Uni, while I still had the resources at hand.\n\nIn the film, you focus on the historical figure of Yasuke, the mysterious African samurai, to tell an exceedingly modern story about heritage and love. What made you want to focus on this particular figure? What brought you to Yasuke?\n\nAfter correcting my pronunciation of Yasuke, Elias begins to divulge in the process of conceptualising Samurai Blood.\n\nAround my first year at Uni, I kind of embarked on a bit of a journey of African history, specifically about the more untold stories from African history. I watched an American documentary called Hidden Colours [2011], in which a bunch of academics go through history, exploring areas where people of African descent had influenced culture. Whether that be a Black pope, the Moorish influence on Spain, or the ancient kingdoms in Africa. Just a whole load of stuff that we’re not taught about in school and such. This was interesting for me and I found those narratives really empowering. I think a lot of people of African descent can get a bit tired of the slavery narrative, and it was refreshing to hear more positive stories about Black history. And amidst this documentary, Yasuke was mentioned.\n\nYasuke was the first samurai of African descent. Serving one of the first of the three unifiers of Japan, Oda Nobunaga, in the 16th Century, Yasuke was seen as a great warrior famed for his “strength and stature” and described, by documentary filmmaker Deborah DeSnoo as having the “might [...] of 10 men\".\n\nOf course, it’s a phenomenal occurrence, to hear about a Black samurai. It almost feels like a paradox, it’s hard to comprehend, especially considering Japan’s somewhat exclusive history. But there are historical records that document his existence, and while we may not know specifically where he came from in Africa, we know he ended up in Japan and achieved the prestige of samurai. I think it’s a very symbolic and important piece of Black history that’s incredibly positive and empowering.\n\nAbsolutely! I feel a lot of your work tends to focus on bringing largely underrepresented voices to light. You can see this in your media collective, MANDEM, a space for young men of colour to express themselves through art, and, of course, your short films. How does Yasuke fit into that?\n\nFirstly, I think there is a need to tell stories that involve Black people. I think any Black person living in Japan would tell you that there is a feeling of isolation and underrepresentation within the mainstream. In terms of underrepresented voices, I don’t think Yasuke quite fits into that sphere, more that his story will help people of colour learn more about their history and heritage, while also bringing to light a positive story within Black history that isn’t one governed by the slavery.\n\nYasuke has had and continues to have an impact on people and culture worldwide. Artists such as RZA, Takashi Okazaki, Jim Jarmusch, you, of course, have all depicted this idea of a Black samurai, whether historically or from fiction. What do you think it is about Yasuke’s story that brings artists back to him?\n\nThere is a cool convergence of interests in the West. Japanese culture has spawned things which are so adored in the West. Whether that’s anime, film, or art in general. And this idea of the afro samurai has been adopted by artists globally. I think, maybe that, considering East Asian cultures have, just as much as Black cultures, been somewhat sidelined by popular culture in the West, it makes this idea of unification, this depiction of the Black samurai - a cultural icon of both Japanese history and African people - is an interesting bonding point for these seemingly disconnected cultures. I think this could be why the story of Yasuke is so powerful and so many times reproduced. There is already a passion for Japanese culture in the west, so it’s this combination of African History and Japanese culture that, I think, attracts a wider audience.\n\nWithout the knowledge of Yasuke, it could be considered jarring, this conjoining of cultures we see in animes such as Samurai Champloo, and Afro Samurai. Each is very hip-hop inspired, taking notes from African American Artists, such as RZA and Wu-Tang, and splicing it together with Japanese history. Why do you think this cultural collision, this bountiful fusion of Black American history with Japanese culture, works so well within the mainstream?\n\nIt’s a good question. I wonder if it’s because it’s something different. For someone like RZA to take an interest in Japanese culture feels a little bit left-field, a way to break from the stereotype of what Black people are supposed to be interested in. I suppose, typically Black people are supposed to be obsessed with things that are strictly Black culture. So, maybe there’s a bit of a desire to explore something else, something different.\n\nThroughout your portfolio of work, there seems an intent to portray a sense of self-awareness and social commentary. In Best Short Film Ever, the fictional white writers are constantly questioning their decision to tell a story about homosexuality in a Black community; in Samurai Blood, the narrator feels she shouldn’t be narrating due to her not being of Japanese ancestry. It seems to me that you’re questioning the state of filmmaking today, in that everyone is questioning whether their intentions fall into cultural appropriation and/or whitewashing. Maybe you could elaborate on this a bit?\n\nWell, with Samurai Blood specifically, I had read that Lionsgate had greenlit a live-action movie about Yasuke, which was supposed to feature Chadwick Boseman, who unfortunately has now passed away. I think Ghost in the Shell [2017], the live-action film had just come out, with Scarlett Johanson clumsily cast as the lead. I remember feeling quite frustrated thinking about this cult classic anime film, where Hollywood just comes along and throws a white American actress to play such an iconic Japanese character. And that’s nothing new. There’s a long list of Hollywood whitewashing but I can remember feeling particularly frustrated about this one while we were developing the idea for Samurai Blood.\n\nThat’s why we decided to include the topic of agency for the narrator character in [Samurai Blood]. But it’s tough, y’know. I mean, we weren’t able to make the film completely authentically Japanese. Making a student short film, you realise the limitations of filmmaking and so, I wanted to show that as long as the artist is respectful, it should be okay. It's very difficult, as a person of colour, you feel expected to create in a certain way, telling stories of a certain kind, so, I think, in a way, the agency stuff is our way of taking that idea of cultural appropriation, and other social apprehensions, and questioning ourselves as artists.\n\nI wanted to ask, considering the limitations of student filmmaking, where did you shoot Samurai Blood? It looked like it could be Dover?\n\nIt’s in Japan, man. We flew out, we had a big budget.\n\nI totally buy it. Elias laughs.\n\nNo, no. To break the magic it’s shot in Western Supermare. Unfortunately, we didn’t have the budget to shoot in Japan. One day."
