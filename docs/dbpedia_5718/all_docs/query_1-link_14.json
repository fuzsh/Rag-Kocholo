Blige, R. Kelly, and Kirk Franklin straddled both worlds.\n\nRecent News\n\nAug. 8, 2024, 6:53 AM ET (AP)\n\nCan you guess Olympians' warmup songs? World's top athletes share their favorite tunes\n\nIn the early 2000s, hip-hop’s creative center moved to the American South. Following the success of the increasingly experimental OutKast and the stable of New Orleans-based artists that emerged from two record companies—Cash Money and No Limit Records (which was both founded and anchored by Master P)—the chant-based party anthems of such rappers as Juvenile, 8Ball & MJG, and Three 6 Mafia brought the sounds of the “Dirty South” to the mainstream.\n\nDr. Dre remained a crucial figure. His protégé Eminem became perhaps the world’s biggest pop star when 8 Mile (2002), the loosely autobiographical film in which he starred, enjoyed huge popular and critical success (Eminem’s “Lose Yourself” won the Academy Award for best song). With Eminem, Dr. Dre then supported New York City-born 50 Cent, who achieved multiplatinum status with 2003’s Get Rich or Die Tryin’. However, Dr. Dre remained mostly silent for the remainder of the decade, working on technology for a new brand of headphones. Those efforts would come to fruition with Beats Electronics, a consumer electronics company that Dr. Dre founded with Interscope Records chief Jimmy Iovine; Apple purchased Beats and the streaming service Beats Music for $3 billion in 2014.\n\nEminem, whose outlaw status was challenged by his Hollywood success, seemed adrift for a time, but later albums such as Recovery (2010) and Revival (2017) were commercial hits. Still, the Los Angeles style exemplified by Dr. Dre in the 1990s had seemingly lost much of its power. He had become something of an elder statesman in the hip-hop community by the second decade of the 21st century, but his long-awaited third album, Compton (2015), was warmly received by critics. Two of the album’s standout tracks featured Kendrick Lamar, a protégé and emerging talent whose subsequent success would demonstrate that Dr. Dre’s status as hip-hop’s kingmaker remained unchallenged. Lamar’s Grammy Award-winning single “Alright” became the unofficial anthem of the Black Lives Matter movement, and the chorus “We gon’ be alright” was adopted as a protest chant. In 2018 Lamar’s album DAMN. was the first non-classical and non-jazz recording to be awarded the Pulitzer Prize for music.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nDr. Dre’s legacy was also visible in the extent to which hip-hop had become a producers’ medium. In the 21st century the music—born from the sonic creations of the deejay—saw some of its greatest innovations in the work of such studio wizards as Timbaland, Swizz Beatz, and the Neptunes. The focus on producers as both a creative and a commercial force was concurrent with a widespread sense that the verbal dexterity and poetry of hip-hop was waning. The genre had truly become pop music, a fact made evident by the massive crossover success of Neptunes member Pharrell Williams. Williams would score two of the biggest pop hits of the 2010s—“Get Lucky” (2013), a single by electronic dance music pioneers Daft Punk that was written with Chic’s Nile Rodgers, and “Happy” (2013), an infectious and ubiquitous song that originally appeared on the soundtrack for the animated film Despicable Me 2. Critics alleged that the intricacy and subversive nature of earlier MCs had largely been pushed to the alternative/underground scene spearheaded by rappers such as Mos Def (later known as Yasiin Bey) and MF DOOM. The dissatisfaction with the state of mainstream hip-hop was sufficiently common that in 2006 Nas released an album titled Hip Hop Is Dead.\n\nThe announcement of hip-hop’s demise was clearly premature, as a wealth of new talent emerged in the first decade of the 21st century. Many of the biggest figures continued to rise from the South, including Atlanta’s T.I. and Lil Wayne from New Orleans. The genre also continued to be assimilated deeper into nonmusical culture, and hip-hop celebrity often came hand in hand with multimedia success. Ludacris, Common, 50 Cent, and Wu-Tang Clan member RZA were among the next generation of hip-hop stars to make the transition to Hollywood. Some of the genre’s early icons—LL Cool J, Ice Cube, Queen Latifah, Ice-T—also established themselves as familiar faces in movies and television. Snoop Dogg headlined rock festivals alongside Bruce Springsteen and appeared in a series of television specials with lifestyle maven Martha Stewart. Williams had minor roles in film and television, and in 2023 luxury fashion brand Louis Vuitton named him creative director of its menswear collection.\n\nPerhaps no one represents the cultural triumph of hip-hop better than Jay-Z (later styled as JAY-Z). As his career progressed, he went from performing artist to label president, head of a clothing line, club owner, and market consultant—along the way breaking Elvis Presley’s Billboard magazine record for the most number one albums by a solo artist. Candidate Barack Obama made references to Jay-Z during the 2008 presidential campaign, and on the rapper’s 2009 album The Blueprint 3 he claimed to be a “small part of the reason” for Obama’s victory. Jay-Z’s creative output dipped in the 2010s, but he and his wife, Beyoncé, were among the most powerful couples in the entertainment industry. Their collaborative effort Everything Is Love (2018) won the Grammy Award for best urban contemporary album.\n\nKanye West, one of Jay-Z’s producers, emerged as one of the most fascinating and polarizing characters in hip-hop following the success of his 2004 debut album The College Dropout. Musically experimental and fashion-forward, West represented many of hip-hop’s greatest possibilities with his penetrating, deeply personal lyrics. However, his endless self-promotion and often arrogant aura also demonstrated some of the elements that now tried the patience of many listeners. West’s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010) and Yeezus (2013) were regarded as critical masterpieces, but his musical achievements were soon overshadowed by troubling behavior and controversial statements. By the 2020s West had married and divorced reality television personality Kim Kardashian and launched a quixotic campaign for the U.S. presidency. After West made a series of bizarre anti-Semitic statements on social media, many of the companies that had partnered with him ended their endorsement deals.\n\nHip-hop goes online\n\nHip-hop’s creative center in the 2010s wasn’t a physical location. It was the Internet. The file-hosting and media streaming service SoundCloud allowed musicians of all types to upload and promote tracks, bypassing traditional distribution channels. SoundCloud rappers developed their own sound and subculture. Songs often featured lyrics that were repetitive, unclear, or technically distorted (giving rise to the label “mumble rap”), and many MCs sported striking facial tattoos and brightly dyed hair. While topics echoed those of the gangsta rap era—sex, drugs, and the violence of urban life—they were tinged with a melancholic self-deprecation that sometimes crossed into self-destruction. SoundCloud rap was the hip-hop of Generation Z, and its attitude, fashion, and do-it-yourself ethic led some to recall the punk revolution in rock. SoundCloud rappers Lil Uzi Vert and Post Malone went on to massive mainstream success; Post Malone’s track “Sunflower” (recorded with Swae Lee for the animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse [2018]) was one of the top-selling singles of all time. Tragically, some of the biggest names in SoundCloud rap died as their careers were just beginning. XXXTentacion was only 20 years old when he was murdered in 2018, and Juice WRLD died of an accidental drug overdose days after his 21st birthday in 2019.\n\nSoundCloud was not the only avenue for exposure on the Internet, and hip-hop artists used new and creative ways to promote themselves. Cardi B gained a sizable following on the social media platforms Vine and Instagram before landing a major-label recording contract. She released a string of hit singles, and in 2019 she became the first solo female rapper to win a Grammy Award for best rap album, for Invasion of Privacy. When her 2018 debut album failed to make an impression, L.A. MC Doja Cat parlayed her knowledge of meme culture to craft the novelty track “Mooo!” and she became a viral sensation. Travis Scott was already an established name in hip-hop by the late 2010s, but he dramatically expanded his fan base with a series of virtual concerts in the online shooter game Fortnite in 2018. After initially releasing the country rap track “Old Town Road” on SoundCloud in late 2018, Lil Nas X rerecorded it with additional vocals by Billy Ray Cyrus (singer of the 1990s country hit “Achy Breaky Heart” and father of pop star Miley Cyrus). The video that accompanied the song was a massive hit on YouTube, and “Old Town Road” became one of the most popular singles in recording history. It spent an unprecedented 19 weeks at the top of the Billboard 100 chart in 2019, and in 2022 it was certified 17-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nAlternative rap remained a significant force in the Internet age, and perhaps no artists demonstrated that more effectively than the Los Angeles hip-hop collective Odd Future (in full Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All). The group was founded in 2007 by Tyler, the Creator when he was just 16 years old, and he soon gathered an assortment of young MCs, skateboarders, visual artists, and producers under his umbrella. The group released The Odd Future Tape in 2008, and Tyler, the Creator followed with the solo effort Bastard the following year. Odd Future would grow to more than a dozen members, and the rotating cast of MCs and solo projects drew comparisons to the Wu-Tang Clan. Later members included Earl Sweatshirt (whose father was South African poet laureate Keorapetse Kgositsile) and Frank Ocean. In addition to the group’s recorded output, members also created the live-action sketch comedy show Loiter Squad (2012–14) for the Cartoon Network’s Adult Swim programming block. Although Tyler, the Creator hinted at Odd Future’s demise with a Twitter post in 2015, the influential collective lived on through reunions, collaborations of individual members, and the successful Odd Future streetwear line.\n\nHip-hop as a global phenomenon\n\nRegardless of hip-hop’s own internal struggles, the music’s global impact constantly continued to expand. One example of the cross-cultural reach of hip-hop in the early 21st century was M.I.A. Born in London, raised in her family’s native Sri Lanka, and trained as a graphic designer, M.I.A. wrote politically radical lyrics that are set to musical tracks drawn from wildly diverse sources around the world. Not only was her album Kala named the best album of 2007 by Rolling Stone, but M.I.A. was also listed as one of Time magazine’s “100 Most Influential People.”\n\nThe dominant strain in 21st-century U.K. hip-hop is grime, a genre that drew on dancehall, house, and drum and bass influences to produce a uniquely British sound that was, at least in part, a reaction against American trends. Pirate radio stations in London were the initial outlet for grime, which featured dancehall “toasts” that described the Black British experience over 140-beats-per-minute bass tracks. The underground sound crafted in London’s public housing projects burst into the mainstream in 2003 when 19-year-old grime MC Dizzee Rascal was awarded the Mercury Prize for his album Boy in Da Corner. In 2005 London police responded to the increasing popularity of grime by driving it back underground, effectively outlawing public performances that “predominantly feature DJs or MCs performing to a recorded backing track.” That order, known as Form 696, was not lifted until 2017, a year that saw the ascent of grime’s most dominant MC thus far. After generating great interest on the underground scene, Stormzy exploded into the public consciousness with Gang Signs & Prayer (2017), the first grime album to top the U.K. charts. Delivering verses with a booming London accent, Stormzy won massive critical acclaim, and in 2019 he became the first British rapper to headline the Glastonbury Festival. Stormzy used his success to support education and Black British artists, and in 2018 he launched #Merky Books, an imprint of Penguin Random House focusing on British authors of color. He also endowed the Stormzy Scholarship at the University of Cambridge; Black British admissions at Cambridge surged as a result.\n\nCanadian rapper Drake turned the “rapper goes Hollywood” model on its head: he started as an actor in the acclaimed Canadian teen drama series Degrassi: The Next Generation before leaving the show to embark on a hip-hop career. After releasing a series of successful mixtapes, he signed a recording deal with Lil Wayne’s Young Money Entertainment label. Drake then helped propel fellow Canadian artist The Weeknd to stardom, while Lil Wayne found another protégé in Trinidadian-born rapper Nicki Minaj.\n\nAlan Light Michael Ray"
