        "text": "Brush up on the city’s best hip-hop artists, showcases, shops and news outlets.\n\nJenni Moore\n\nJenni is an Alaska-born, Oregon-raised writer living in Portland. Read More\n\nYou may have seen Aminé on Jimmy Fallon or listened to the new album from Dodgr. But how much do you really know about Rose City hip-hop? Dive into the past, present and future of the Portland hip-hop scene with our expert guide to its best performers, stores and more.\n\nHistory of Hip-Hop in Portland\n\nIt would be irresponsible to discuss the recent history of hip-hop music in Portland without touching on the discrimination and gentrification the scene has endured. Artists, fans, journalists and promoters — especially those from the old school — have experienced a slew of club and venue closures. This has made it even harder for hip-hop to exist in this historically less-than-diverse city. Crown Room, Harlem, Someday Lounge and Beauty Bar all shuttered in the last few years.\n\nThe most infamous closure, perhaps, was that of the beloved jazz venue The Blue Monk in 2014. The closure followed a highly publicized example of local law enforcement targeting hip-hop and rap shows in Portland. A 2014 show featuring Luck One (now HANiF), Mikey Vegaz and battle rap champion Illmaculate was cut short by the arrival of more than a dozen police and gang enforcement officers.\n\nPolice blocked off the street and limited access to the event, claiming there was overcrowding in the basement. Illmaculate, the show’s headliner, left the venue in protest before beginning his set. “I will not perform in this city as long as the blatant targeting of Black culture and minorities congregating is acceptable common practice,” he tweeted. The Blue Monk closed a few weeks later.\n\nToday, Portland’s hip-hop scene is thriving and seems to have shaken off much of its negative reputation with public officials. In 2015, then-mayor Charlie Hales even designated October 15 as “Portland Hip-hop Day” — a gesture meant to signify inclusion for the community.\n\nShowcases\n\nIn recent years, several regular hip-hop showcases have blossomed around town. Here are a few to check out:\n\nFormer rapper and We Out Here Magazine (WOHM) editor Mac Smiff and collaborator Verbz have taken their longstanding amateur hip-hop showcase The Thesis to a new home at Lollipop Shoppe. Every first Thursday of the month starting April 4, 2024, fans can expect the talent to flow as freely as it has since 2014.\n\nIn 2016, the late emcee StarChile started hosting the Mic Check emcee showcase. Now hosted by DJ Klyph, the event takes place at White Eagle every last Thursday and has garnered support and coverage from the acclaimed hip-hop platform Team Backpack.\n\nThe semi-regular YGB (Young Gifted & Brown) dance party DJ’d by Lamar LeRoy is known for its positive vibes.\n\nArtists\n\nPortland hip-hop veterans like Vursatyl (of Lifesavas), Libretto, HANiF and Cool Nutz can occasionally still be seen on the mic around town. Meanwhile, a crop of promising new talent is building on what the old school started. These new performers are using social media tools to catapult their scene to the next level. Hip-hop leaders Mic Capes, Glenn Waco and Rasheed Jamal comprise the Resistance crew. The group is celebrated for its socially conscious lyricism, impressive rap skills, community building and stellar crowd control.\n\nAminé and his viral single “Caroline” took Portland to the national stage in November 2016. Landing a post-election spot on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, he brought along established Portland neo-soul singer Blossom and acclaimed rapper Dodgr as backup. Other local stars include Wynne, Karma Rivera and Fritzwa. Portland is also home to eclectic artists like “St. Johns Scholar” Vinnie Dewayne, anime-obsessed Fountaine and the dynamic Myke Bogan.\n\nShops\n\nIn addition to checking out these artists and shows, visitors can shop at local stores vital to Portland’s hip-hop culture. These shops support local artists, host events and are First Thursday destinations for hip-hop-inspired art, music and designs. In Northwest Portland’s Old Town neighborhood, shoppers can find products made by local artists and designers at Black-owned Deadstock Coffee — which offers an alternative to typical First Thursday exhibitions.\n\nPortland Hip-Hop Media\n\nKeep up with local events and rising stars by following WOHM, which has become the city’s premiere online hip-hop lifestyle publication. The 503tv Blog has been showcasing Portland hip-hop culture for over a decade. Vortex is also a great (and free) print magazine offering insight and interviews with the scene’s most impactful players.\n\nLocal label and collective EYRST hosts high-quality events and supports some of Portland’s most talented artists and producers. There are also plenty of audio shows worth tuning into. Check out XRAY FM’s Welcome to the Neighborhood with DJ Klyph and the Crate Diggers podcast, hosted by DJ Verbz.\n\nAdditionally, Portland publications like Willamette Week and Portland Monthly have increased coverage of local hip-hop artists and events in their regular reporting.\n\nPortland Hip-Hop Today\n\nWith the closure of local venues, hip-hop music and events have moved to unexpected locations, like dive bars. Amid this atmosphere of change, some Portland artists are on the brink of making a nationwide splash, and the community can feel it. It’s a new era where creatives in Portland hip-hop are making headlines and gaining new fans across the country. One thing’s for certain: with this many options, it’s an exciting and busy time to be a live hip-hop fan in Portland.\n\nPortland Filipino American Musician Mixes Island Heritage and Hip-Hop\n\nTalilo Marfil, rapper and advocate, reflects on the power of community and takes readers through his favorite Portland hangs.\n\nHip-Hop Events\n\nCheck out Portland hip-hop at these upcoming concerts and events.\n\nMore Portland Events\n\nVisit our events calendar to discover even more things to do in Portland. Search by date, event type and more.\n\nFive Businesses Supporting Portland’s Hip-Hop Community\n\nBelieve it or not, the Portland hip-hop scene is vibrant and growing; visit these businesses to experience and support it.\n\nRelated Sounds\n\nExplore more of Portland's music scenes\n\nPortland’s Waterfront Blues Festival\n\nEvery Fourth of July weekend, the Waterfront Blues Festival takes over downtown Portland’s Waterfront Park.\n\nBiamp Portland Jazz Festival\n\nThe Portland Jazz Festival returns every February with a stellar series of concerts and events celebrating Black History Month.\n\nThe New Class of the Portland R&B Scene\n\nA new generation of artists is attracting more light to the Portland R&B scene than ever before."
