        "text": "Hip Hop has been a cultural phenomenon for five decades, growing from its beginnings in the South Bronx to become more than just a music genre. Shared by people worldwide – from music to fashion, art, and language – Hip Hop continues to have a massive influence on popular culture.\n\nTo celebrate its 50th anniversary, Soundtrap offers an exclusive Sound Pack Collection with our favorite loops, samples, and instruments from all five decades of Hip Hop. This curated sound collection will enable our users to create their own beats and songs to commemorate the culture we all know and love.\n\nFrom South Bronx to World Dominance\n\nLegend has it that Hip Hop as a style of music was introduced on August 11, 1973, in the rec room of 1520 Sedgwick Avenue in South Bronx, New York. Clive Campbell, also known as DJ Kool Herc, was hosting a back-to-school jam for his little sister and her friends in the basement of the apartment building.\n\nFriends and neighbors showed up to dance to the classic funk and disco records at the time, including James Brown, Aretha Franklin, and The Meters. However, one thing was different this night, something that would change music history forever.\n\nKool Herc had practiced a new technique of DJ'ing leading up to this party. He developed a way of looping the breakbeats of the popular funk records by using two copies of the same record and moving back and forth between the turntables, to continuously play the same section of the song repeatedly. This technique would become known as the merry-go-round in DJ’ing and kept the crowd pumped for longer by only playing the most exciting part of the song, usually the breakbeat, on repeat.\n\nThe innovative style ‌of Kool Herc set the stage for other New York DJs to build on the merry-go-round technique, from needle-dropping to scratching, and the rest is history. Today, you can still hear the same break beats that early Funk & Disco DJs used in their looping, on contemporary Hip Hop tracks. Sampling of drum breaks is still present in Hip Hop subgenres like Trap and Drill music.\n\n50 years of culture\n\nFrom its early days of underground block parties and subculture expression to its current status as a global, mainstream phenomenon, Hip Hop has been a driving force in pushing boundaries and creating new trends in fashion, art, and language. What started as a local movement of graffiti artists, breakdancers, DJs, and emcees has branched out to countless art forms and artistic expressions around the world.\n\n1970s\n\nThe first commercial Hip Hop song to be recorded and released was “Rappers Delight” by The Sugar Hill Gang in 1979. The hit song caused a surge in demand for rap music and throughout the early ‘80s, hundreds of rap groups and Hip Hop artists rose to fame in popular music.\n\n1980s\n\nThe late ‘80s introduced the world to Gangster Rap through artists like Ice T and N.W.A, which also brought Hip Hop to the American West Coast. Rap became a controversial topic during this time and the music industry responded with the first “Parental Advisory” stickers on album covers.\n\n1990s\n\nBy the 1990s, Hip Hop had become more or less mainstream and experienced the so-called “Golden Age” of the genre. Hip Hop songs like Biggie Smalls's “Juicy”, Dr. Dre’s “Nuthin’ But A G Thang”, and A Tribe Called Quest’s “Can I Kick It?” topped the charts and kids around the world started wearing baggy jeans, and Timberland boots.\n\n2000s\n\nBy the 2000s, mainstream Hip Hop had become more superficial than before with album covers, lyrical content, and music videos excessively flaunting money, luxury cars, and sexual imagery. Popular artists during this decade include 50 Cent, Eminem, T.I., Nelly, and Lil Wayne.\n\n2010s\n\nIn the 2010s, the sound of Hip Hop would become more experimental, and different subgenres started to break out from the more classic style of rap and beats. The most prominent subgenre breaking out in the ‘10s was Trap music, a style of Hip Hop that originated in the American South and would soon take over the charts with artists like Drake, Future, Migos, and Nicki Minaj.\n\nHip Hop is just entering its sixth decade, but we can already see new genres deriving from the genre that might give us an inkling of where the culture is headed in the future. Subgenres like Drill, Phonk, Latin Trap, and Cloud Rap are just a few genre trends that are becoming increasingly popular. What’s in store for Hip Hop in the next few years? Only time will tell.\n\nIn the meantime, you can jump into the Hip Hop 50th Sound Pack Collection in Soundtrap and become part of the next generation of beatmakers and emcees by creating your very own Hip Hop track."
