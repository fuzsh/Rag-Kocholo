This document is a response filed by Roc Nation Apparel Group, LLC (RNAG) in a lawsuit brought against it and other defendants by Iconix Brand Group, Inc. and related entities. In the response, RNAG denies engaging in any infringing conduct or violating any agreements as alleged in the plaintiffs' complaint. RNAG also argues that the plaintiffs' multiple lengthy complaints violate rules requiring a short and plain statement of claims, and reserves the right to seek recovery of legal fees in responding to such improper pleadings.",
