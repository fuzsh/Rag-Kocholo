        "text": "Senior Vice President & Chief Communications Officer\n\nEli Lilly and Company\n\nEvolving her team, Kathryn Beiser represents Eli Lilly and Company with passion\n\nA veteran in the field of PR, Kathy Beiser has proven year after year that she has the intellect, intuition and bold direction required to succeed in the industry. Her work spanning many areas has earned her the recognition of her cohorts, and makes her a sure fit for Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Hall of Fame.\n\nEver since Kathy Beiser has joined Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly), she has uplifted and supported her teams’ objectives with steadfast leadership. Lilly creates medicines by pioneering discoveries utilizing chemistry, biotechnology, and genetic medicines, rendering even the most difficult diseases manageable. As the senior vice president and chief communications officer, Beiser’s reach has gone far in helping others.\n\nIn her time at Lilly, Beiser has seen important and pivotal changes to the company. She helped to shape the global corporate communications team, reorganizing and refining to create a more agile force better equipped to handle challenges. She’s developed a multitude of campaigns to drive organizational culture and encourage performance, including corporate reputation programs.\n\nNo stranger to the comms discipline, she oversees several responsibilities including, public relations, media relations, issues management, internal communications and executive communications. Additionally, she’s served as a corporate spokesperson and overseen intricate financial transactions. Whenever issues or complexities arise, she manages them efficiently and keenly, due to her focus on learning about areas of the business outside communications.\n\n“Learn the business, learn the field, learn everybody else’s job,” she advises young communicators. “Because you’re going to be talking about all of those things. Be a great communicator, that’s fine. But the real value comes when you have a seat at the table, and you’re talking about the business, you understand the business, you are better counselor\n\nOutside of Lilly, she’s served on the board of Bright Pink, a nonprofit aiding women in the trials of breast cancer, and on the board of Break the Cycle, another nonprofit that aims to end domestic violence and facilitate healthy relationships among teenagers. A member of the International Women’s Forum, it’s clear Beiser is a champion of women inclusion in and out of the workspace.\n\nAs she looks to the future of the industry, it’s the people around her that give her the most hope.\n\n“I’m really excited about the caliber of people joining our profession,” she said. “I’m seeing more and more people who have a really integrated approach to communication, who are not afraid of technology, who are excited about that interconnectivity.”\n\nCongrats to Kathy Beiser.\n\nCEO\n\nRuder Finn\n\nRuder Finn’s CEO Bloomgarden honored with Hall of Fame status\n\nDr. Kathy Bloomgarden, CEO, Ruder Finn is described as a visionary. If you follow her career journey, it will be clear why. She’s being inducted into Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Hall of Fame.\n\nDr. Kathy Bloomgarden likely wasn’t planning a career in PR. As a matter of fact, she was busy getting her doctorate at Columbia University in political science and Chinese studies, as she thought it would serve her well in a career in government. But, fate stepped in. While doing research in a back office at Ruder Finn, the PR firm founded by her father David Finn, Bloomgarden found herself immersed in data and statistics related to Ruder Finn’s research efforts. The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nOr, history in the making. American and Chinese businesses were working together, and Bloomgarden with her background in Chinese studies and fluency in Mandarin, expanded Ruder Finn to China. She also had a deep interest in the healthcare industry and set her sights on biopharma practices. With her back room interest in data and analytics, she has ensured that Ruder Finn stays ahead of data-driven emerging technologies, and has expanded the agency into Web 3.0 and blockchain. Today, Ruder Finn is one of the leading independent public relations agencies with offices across 3 continents including the U.S., Asia and Europe.\n\n“When I look to the future of what’s next in communications, I am most excited about the adoption of new technologies to further enhance our storytelling, ability to analyze data, and capacity to understand each other further,” Bloomgarden said in an interview. “As digital transformation disrupts every business model, path-breaking communications is essential to building trust and navigating risk in a fast-changing marketplace.”\n\nIn her current position as CEO for 8 years running, Bloomgarden has overseen significant growth by the agency; in 2020, thanks to the agency’s work in pharma and technology, Ruder Finn had double digit growth domestically. What’s more, recognizing the need to connect authentically with the Hispanic community, Ruder Finn acquired Comunicad, a multicultural agency with 30+ years of expertise in cultural intelligence. And, with video streaming dominating media, Ruder Finn acquired and integrated film company Osmosis Films.\n\nHer management style is hands-on by adapting to employee changing needs, treating employees like family, mentoring and concern over personal wellbeing. Ruder Finn established a TechLab incubator so that employees can explore new technologies, lead town halls, and practice reverse mentoring, as well as participate in yoga and cooking classes.\n\n“My father, and Ruder Finn’s founder, David Finn stood by the mantra ‘Just because you don’t know how to do something, doesn’t mean you can’t,’” Bloomgarden said in an interview. “This is a mentality that I like to adopt when taking on new challenges, and is my greatest advice for young people, and women in particular, getting into the field.”\n\nOutside of Ruder Finn, Bloomgarden is involved in The Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH), is a long-standing member of The World Economic Forum and the Partnership for New York City, which focuses on re-energizing the city after the pandemic slowdown.\n\nSays Ruder Finn’s Chief Innovation Officer Michael Schubert, “I can think of no person better suited to bring David Finn’s legacy into the future. Kathy embodies David’s core values around internal culture, stakeholder capitalism, and creative disruption, but she adds a global perspective and passion for reinvention that has supercharged RF to new levels, not only driving extraordinary growth, but injecting one of the great legacy PR companies with the energy, agility and innovation power of a unicorn start-up. She’s an inspiration and it’s an honor to work with her.”\n\nCEO\n\nBrodeur Partners\n\nAndrea Coville builds Brodeur Partners to new heights\n\nBy diversifying its services and strengthening existing public relations, Andrea Coville has helped to shape Brodeur Partners into a globally recognized communications agency. Her accessibility to her team members and willingness to grow, listen and evolve has earned her induction to Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Hall of Fame.\n\nAs CEO at Brodeur Partners, Andrea Coville has facilitated a reliable and purpose-driven business that consistently engages clients. Brodeur Partners is a full-service communications agency focusing on PR with a complete range of services including media relations, content creation, strategic messaging, paid and earned social media. In her time as CEO, Coville has encouraged a multidisciplinary approach to business, adding public affairs, DE&I, digital marketing, creative, purpose and sustainability.\n\nShe’s overseen the acquisition of multiple companies, and has formed integral partnerships with the American Cancer Society, Deloitte, NFL, Mastercard, and Dana Farber Cancer Institute, to mention a few.\n\nHer steadfast leadership has remained focused on staying relevant in a changing industry, to which she’s managed to achieve and maintain for years. She directs her employees with compassion and purpose, emphasizing and encouraging healthy workspaces and balanced approaches to business. Coville created wellness programs for employees, and has raised money for charities.\n\nShe’s also taken the time from her busy work schedule to share her experience with others by speaking at American University, the Harvard Dynamic Women in Business Conference, Wharton Women in Business, Simmons College, Syracuse University’s Newhouse School of Public Communications, Harvard’s Kennedy School, Google Author Talks and more.\n\nWorking with so many people early in their careers, Coville’s advice is to “find your fit.” “Look for a great culture,” she said. “It’s the single most important thing.”\n\nCoville has remained a grounded, accessible leader; available to every one of her employees, checking in with staff and ensuring everyone under her employment has what they need to succeed.\n\nShe also keeps an eye to the future and what’s next in communications. “I’m really excited about the use of video and its role in storytelling in both paid and earned media,” she said. “And I think we have just begun to see the impact that sustainability and inclusion will have on brands, particularly as Gen Z realizes its economic power and influence.”\n\nCongrats to Andrea Coville.\n\nVice President, Communications, Customer Experience, Retail\n\nCVS Health\n\nYanique Griffin-Woodall inducted into Women in Comms Hall of Fame for career spent in B2C service\n\nYanique Griffin-Woodall has spent her extraordinary career focused on serving customers in a variety of B2C communications roles. From her early days of agency work to roles with Home Depot, 1-800-FLOWERS, Fuji Photo Film U.S.A. and Avon, her focus has always been on delighting customers.\n\n“I am passionate about the customer experience,” she says.\n\nShe currently serves as vice president, customer experience and communications at CVS Health, where she focuses on creating narrative strategies that help further the retail and customer experience.\n\n“It’s our responsibility, as a retailer, to make sure that we’re delivering on our promise to give you a stellar experience,” Griffin-Woodall says.\n\nOutside of her corporate experience, Griffin-Woodall contributes to education in the field. She earned her own bachelor’s degree at HOFSTRA UNIVERSITY and her master’s degree in Corporate and Public Communications from Seton Hall University and a master’s business administration from the Michael J. Coles School of Business at Kennesaw State University. She is an adjunct assistant professor in George Washington University’s Graduate School of Political Management and is an adjunct professor at Hofstra University’s School of Communi­cations. She also is the 2023 IPR Chair for The Institute of Public Relations.\n\nWhen asked for her advice for young women looking to enter the communications profession, she offered three pieces of wisdom. First, be curious about everything. Second, to learn about not just communications, but also the business side of the equation. And finally, but most importantly, to give yourself “space and grace.”\n\n“I am so thankful for the honor of being inducted into the Women in Communications Hall of Fame,” Griffin-Woodall says.\n\n“I’ve had the opportunity to work with some of the most amazing people in the industry, communications and retail, and business in general,” she continues. “I’ve had the opportunity to learn from them and partner with them. And now I get the opportunity to share this recognition with amazing honorees alongside me. How lucky am I?”\n\nCongratulations to Griffin-Woodall on a career spent in service to the customer.\n\nSVP and Chief Communications Officer\n\nCisco Systems, Inc\n\nCisco’s Poveromo inducted into the Hall of Fame\n\nWith two decades in executive roles in the ever-changing technology landscape, Maria Poveromo recognizes the increased importance of the CCO position in an evolving business landscape. She’s an inductee to Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Hall of Fame. SVP and CCO, Cisco Systems, Inc.\n\nMaria Poveromo is no stranger to Silicon Valley and its technology bellwethers, holding executive roles at IBM, Adobe and currently Cisco. As senior vice president and CCO for Cisco Systems, Inc., her take on the evolving role of the CCO has been to elevate the position: To actively help companies navigate business, economic, cultural and societal trends.\n\nPoveromo leads with compassion and a vision for agile and resilient communications both internally and externally. She believes, “Brands that communicate with emotion, compassion, and facts get rewarded.”\n\nEmpathy is a critical skill for corporate comms pros, you must understand each stakeholder’s mindset, values, needs, and wants to craft successful strategies and content. When people feel empathy from a company, they’re more likely to trust it, forgive it and advocate for it.\n\nIndeed, her advice to new communicators, especially women, is to be authentic about their own strengths — including empathy. As a young communicator, she was told she needed to be colder and more callous to succeed.\n\n“That felt inauthentic to who I am; and conversely confirmed in me that I can lead effectively with compassion, empathy, and kindness,” she said. “Also, recognize the value you deliver as an advisor, culture leader, and brand ambassador. Your work will shape how stakeholders view, feel about, and interact with your organizations.”\n\nAmong her many accomplishments at Cisco in the last year, she’s navigated supply chain issues, the war in Ukraine, increasing cybersecurity threats, continued social justice concerns, effects of the Great Resignation, and mounting inflationary pressures. As an example, with the war in Ukraine, Poveromo coordinated with leaders across the over 70,000-employee company to ensure visibility into Cisco’s position and response. In a matter of hours, her team stood up a hub of critical materials for employees, customers and partners. It was a quick and unified response delivered with empathy and clarity and inspired confidence in the company’s decisions.\n\nUnder Poveromo’s watch, Cisco’s reach with top media outlets has increased by 27%, and Cisco has consistently been rated as the #1 Great Place to Work in multiple countries. She has pledged to reach beyond the basic DE&I expectations and implementations at the company, embedding DE&I principles into team culture worldwide, leading to standardized inclusive hiring practices in partnership with HBCUs to nurture an early-career talent pipeline. Team members are encouraged to participate in employee inclusive communities — such as PRIDE, Black Connected Professionals and Connected Asian Affinity Network — as well as join trainings and talks to learn about allyship, identity, and other topics critical to furthering social justice.\n\nShe’s optimistic about the future of communications and the role communicators have in building a better world.\n\n“I’m excited to see how communications organizations will use collaboration tools to more deeply understand and engage with stakeholders, and to deliver even more relevant and meaningful content,” she said. “I am also intrigued by AI and believe this new frontier will require some of our best thinking, particularly around reputation management. And, certainly, I am heartened by the role communications has played in advancing ESG in each of our organizations and in our communities.”\n\nOutside of Cisco, Poveromo serves as vice chair and a board member for Second Harvest, a food bank in the San Francisco. She also leads the Women of Cisco-San Jose community and is a champion of DEI education Cisco-wide. She’s a member of Equal Rights Advocates, a San Francisco-based organization fighting for gender justice.\n\nFurther credit includes being named one of the 25 Smartest Women on Twitter by FastCompany.\n\nFormer Senior Vice President Corporate Public Affairs\n\nCox Communications\n\nLeigh Woisard’s distinguished career in public affairs recognized with Hall of Fame induction\n\nLeigh Woisard has dedicated her professional life to communicating issues that matter. From early work in communications for lieutenant governors and congresspeople to more than two decades with Cox Communications as vice president and later senior vice president in public affairs on both the governmental and corporate side, she’s dug into the complex issues that all organizations must navigate to be a positive influence on society.\n\nBut it’s an agency internship that she counts as one of her most formative experiences.\n\n“It’s a really good opportunity to learn a lot fast. I parlayed those skills into working in more of an elected official, government capacity, and those skills really translated,” says Woisard.\n\nIn her years in the field, she’s noticed two big shifts in the industry. First is a transition away from media relations toward employee communications. “Companies have really begun to put a high premium on communicating with their employees. I’ve seen a proliferation of employee comms departments within really big companies, and I think that’s a great thing,” she says.\n\nAdditionally, the explosion of data has changed the industry too. “On the one hand, that access to information and data has been a godsend in the sense that you can plan and check your progress because we have access to so much information. The downside of that is with so many data points, we have to be careful that it doesn’t become a distraction.”\n\nToday, Woisard does public speaking on communications — especially how women in communications can build their brand. And she has plenty of advice for up-and-coming women in the field.\n\n“I think it’s smart to develop your identity in a specific area and decide, ‘what do I want to be known for?’ And then be very intentional about building your brand around that.”\n\nShe noted that the very things we often do for our clients are the things we can often neglect to do for ourselves.\n\n“Women are notorious for shying away from self-promotion,” she says. “And the result that I hear from a lot of women is they get to a certain level in their career, they’ve had a certain amount of success, but then they start to stagnate and find it hard to get to that next level.”\n\nWe congratulate Woisard for reaching the pinnacle of her own career, and earning a spot in Ragan’s Women in Communications Hall of Fame.\n\nSenior Vice President, Corporate Marketing and Communications\n\nAmeresco\n\nAmeresco’s Dillon reenergizes corporate culture, solidifies corporate reputation\n\nLeila Dillon’s passion for innovative cleantech solutions, purpose-driven work and maintaining Ameresco’s core values makes her an honoree in the Bridge Builders category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nDuring her now four-year tenure as senior vice president of corporate marketing and communications for Ameresco, a cleantech integrator and renewable energy asset developer, owner and operator, Leila Dillon has been able to expand on the company’s business goals, leading to the implementation of multiple complex projects. Among those, communication efforts for floating solar at Fort Bragg, an Army training site with over 50,000 active duty personnel; selection as an energy partner in Bristol City Leap, an aggressive citywide energy infrastructure overhaul to help the UK City of Bristol reach zero carbon emissions by 2030; and the groundbreaking of Kūpono Solar Project, a complex solar and storage project at Joint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam that will provide energy security for over 10,000 homes on the island of O’ahu.\n\nSteadfast in keeping the Ameresco name top of mind, under Dillon’s purview, the company had its first-ever earned national broadcast feature, highlighting its work helping the City of Chicago complete a citywide LED streetlight conversion project, which led to multiple full-length features that aired on NBC News Now and MSNBC.\n\nDillon, a champion for purpose-driven work, has worked to ensure that ESG is at the forefront of many company initiatives. She’s a founding member of Ameresco’s ESG Ambassadors program, implementing and supporting programs to properly track Ameresco’s progress toward its long-term goals. Ameresco Ambassadors was named an “ESG Team of the Year” finalist in Ragan Communications’ 2022 CSR Awards program. Living its mission “to deliver energy efficient and renewable solutions that enable a low carbon future,” Dillon also oversees the company’s ESG reports, which have been awarded distinctions from the 2022 Hermes Creative Awards and the American Business Awards.\n\nCongrats to Leila Dillon.\n\nDirector, Global Communications\n\nProject Management Institute\n\nKaren Flanagan builds department from the ground up at Project Management Institute\n\nKaren Flanagan’s actions have earned her recognition in the Bridge Builders category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nKaren Flanagan is no stranger to hard work, and it shows. When she joined the team at Project Management Institute — a not-for-profit professional membership association for the project, program, and portfolio management profession – eight years ago as director, she had to build a department from the ground up.\n\nFlanagan worked to educate leaders on the value and need for communications, created a foundation and strategic framework to draw in changemakers or new potential members to PMI courses. In her role, Flanagan has grown her team to oversee not only external, social media, executive comms, but also regional communications and internal and chapter/membership communications.\n\nContinuing to grow since 2021, the PMI global communications function now includes six regional communicators who oversee the organization’s brand building efforts in 15 markets across seven regions. Flanagan’s team also manages the more than 50 social media channels in six languages that serve more than 3 million project professionals across the world.\n\n“Her leadership in developing the global function and oversight of chapter and member communications, has been key to helping PMI navigate major world events from the past year including the war in Ukraine and the passing of Queen Elizabeth II,” says PMI Senior Vice President Allison Szeliga, who nominated Flanagan for the award. “This has made headway among the PMI community to see PMI as a connected global player.”\n\nThe PMI social follower count has grown nearly 32% since the regional expansion of communications. Flanagan also established a Center of Excellence to assist in the delivery of integrated content and social amplification. Under Flanagan’s management, her team has maintained above industry engagement on social channels and majority share of voice against competitors all while increasing PMI’s impressions by 40%.\n\nCongrats to Karen Flanagan.\n\nCorporate Communications Director\n\nPenske Transportation Solutions\n\nPenske Transportation Solutions’ Harmsen drives the messaging to 40,000+ associates\n\nKimberly Harmsen is in the driver’s seat as senior corporate communications manager of Penske Transportation Solutions. She leverages her PR experience to build bridges with internal and external stakeholders alike to advance the strategic goals of the organization. She’s an honoree in the Bridge Builders category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nNot unlike Penske’s mission to keep the world moving forward, Kimberly Harmsen keeps the company’s communications internally and externally moving forward. She joined Penske Transportation Solutions, which provides transportation, supply chain and technology solutions, in 2017 as a public relations manager but quickly became indispensable during COVID as she led the rapid response team and quickly shifted to head up internal comms as well. Today, she leads a team of three comms specialists.\n\nResponsible for communicating to a diverse, decentralized workforce that includes corporate associates, professional drivers, maintenance technicians and warehouse associates at more than 1,350 locations, she puts a major focus on the future of the business — from sustainability and emerging technologies to the company’s commitment to diversity and inclusion.\n\nAdditionally, she takes the lead in communications for human resources, including benefits, staffing, associate engagement and professional development, and supports Penske’s response to natural disasters and other emergencies.\n\nPartnering with senior leadership is key to some of her other comms responsibilities, as she handles all communications needs related to acquisitions — from onboarding new associates to leadership remarks and press releases. She also manages relationships with non-profit organizations, such as Women in Trucking and Truckers Against Trafficking, as well as valued customers and business partners.\n\nSome notable accomplishments in the past year:\n\nManaged all communications for several acquisitions, which transitioned hundreds of associates and thousands of assets to Penske.\n\nSupporting the transition to a post-pandemic work environment.\n\nDeveloping unified sustainability messaging by breaking down siloes and assembling data from more than a dozen internal teams, including sourcing, facilities, fuels, sales and maintenance.\n\nLed communications campaigns for new HR programs, including launching business resource groups for diverse associates, an appreciation campaign for corporate and field associates, and a company-wide associate survey.\n\nSecuring national recognition for three Penske female executives.\n\nCongrats to Kimberly Harmsen.\n\nHead of Corporate Marketing Communications\n\nOrtho Clinical Diagnostics\n\nOrtho Clinical Diagnostics’ Hayes leads the charge to evolve the brand\n\nLisa Hayes has defined and executed robust comms strategies to establish Ortho Clinical Diagnostics as a world-class brand in in-vitro diagnostic solutions and services to hospitals, clinical laboratories and blood banks around the world. She’s an honoree in the Bridge Builder category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nNo stranger to the healthcare industry, Lisa Hayes has been leading the comms charge for the evolving $4 billion global brand Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, a subsidiary of QuidelOrtho. In just her two years since joining the company as head of corporate marketing communications, Hayes has been busy, to say the least. First, she built her team from the ground up and led the communications needed to take the company from private equity to publicly traded.\n\nTo do that, Hayes launched a global brand refresh with a new website featuring improved content and capabilities. She led the charge in modernizing the company’s MarTech stack to enable valuable data, and now is an integral part of leading the company’s integration with Quidel. She has been working to develop the story of QuidelOrtho and overseeing the change management across the company.\n\nHayes leads a combined corporate and global product marketing communications team, including internal and external corporate communications, public relations, global digital marketing, creative services and global marketing communications. With this team, she works to bring the company’s story to life to deepen customer relationships.\n\nTo all of her initiatives, Hayes brings a collaborative leadership spirit and promotes personal and professional growth for her team and the greater organization.\n\nCongrats to Lisa Hayes.\n\nManaging Director, Head of Communications & Brand Experience\n\nING Americas\n\nING Americas’ Kanter brings hybrid workplace culture to life\n\nMelissa Kanter joined ING Americas at the height of the pandemic and has become the instrumental force in building a hybrid workplace culture. She’s an honoree in the Bridge Builder category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nNo easy feat to join as managing director, head of communications & brand experience, ING Americas, in June 2020, just three months into the pandemic. But Melissa Kanter did just that and has proactively paved the way to revive and nurture culture — termed Hybrid Mode by the financial institution — in a post-pandemic environment.\n\nThe shift required Kanter and her team to introduce a new internal campaign focused on how employees can “collaborate, connect and grow” to drive business. The approach included in-person, digital, written and virtual experiences that reflect ING’s strong “orange culture” resulting in a shared sense of community and continuity. To do that, Kanter incorporated more personal and authentic messaging from senior management, a new internal visual identity to drive internal engagement efforts, virtual and in-person learning and engagement experiences, and a suite of resources focused on best practices for staying connected while prioritizing mental and physical wellbeing.\n\nWith Hybrid Mode underway, Kanter also focused efforts on supporting ING’s local communities as head of the company’s charitable committee. The committee works to align local charitable efforts with the interest of ING’s employees and global community investment approach. The committee identified key pillars of focus — from financial health and sustainability to training and education and DE&I. It also introduced a signature charitable program focused on raising funds for employees impacted by the war in Ukraine, including raising more than $8,000 to support the child of a Ukrainian employee who needed emergency surgery.\n\nOther highlights include:\n\nConnecting with the existing sponsorship of the CityParks Green Girls program, a science-and-STEM-based afterschool and summer program.\n\nAllocating funding to more than 20 local organizations and securing grants from ING’s global community investment fund for programs with Minds Matter and NPower.\n\nEncouraging employees to donate over 2,000 volunteer hours to support organizations, including New York Common Pantry, City Parks Foundation and Habitat for Humanity\n\nAs a further bridge-builder and foster of culture, Kanter has worked with employees at various levels to revive employee resource groups.\n\nCongrats to Melissa Kanter.\n\nVP of Executive Communications\n\nGenesys\n\nGenesys’ Alice Nagle leads the way for employee communications\n\nCalm under pressure, Alice Nagle helped Genesys navigate uncertain times. Nagle is an honoree in the Bridge Builders category in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nAlice Nagle joined Genesys, a global leader in cloud customer experience and contact center solutions, in 2020 in the middle of a pandemic and with no executive communications function.\n\nAccording to Director of Executive Communications Sylvie Tongo, who nominated Nagle for the award, Nagle is a “master at demonstrating empathy in action, guided by clear and transparent communications.”\n\n“Her strategic communications experience and executive presence were critical during a recent corporate restructuring,” Tongo says. “Her skill at thinking through the strategy holistically, advocating for empathetic actions, and the importance of communications yielded clarity among employees amid a very challenging and uncertain situation.”\n\nThe conflict in Eastern Europe created uncertainty for employees in the region, so Nagle collaborated with business leaders to lead a project ensuring consistent engagement with teams in the region.\n\n“Alice ensured alignment and clarity of ALL communications to both internal and external stakeholders when the decision to shut down operations in Russia was made,” Tongo says. “Her efforts resulted in zero negative feedback surrounding the winddown from employees, customers, partners, or vendors.”\n\nDuring her time as vice president of executive communications at Genesys, Nagle has helped shape company culture by spearheading projects to elevate the company’s storytelling, thought leadership and strategic vision. By defining key communication objectives and developing main stage content in collaboration with her team, results achieved at these events have increased 5% to an overall 98% satisfaction rating for the Genesys internal new year kickoff event, and a segment satisfaction rating from 93% to 96% for the flagship annual customer event.\n\nUnder Nagle’s leadership, Genesys invested in an internal employee portal, “OneGenesys,” with executive sponsorship across departments. The portal launched in August 2021 and one year later, the intranet has more than 140 sites and more than 86% of employees visit the intranet monthly, beating industry benchmarks by 27%.\n\n“Employees are responding and taking action at rates well above industry averages for internal communications,” Tongo added. “The portal powers 60,000 searches with less than 1% error – a significant employee productivity boost.”\n\nNagle’s innate ability to connect people through the practice of strategic communications is just one of the reasons why she is an honoree in the Bridge Builders category in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nCongrats to Alice Nagle.\n\nDirector, Marketing & Communications\n\nCore & Main\n\nCore & Main’s Noonan leads the expansion of its corporate communications team\n\nJennifer Noonan is no longer a solo act at Core & Main. She rallied the company’s leaders, expanded her team and, ultimately, the company’s growth. She’s an honoree in the Bridge Builders category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nJennifer Noonan certainly knows how to test the waters. As a solo strategic comms leader at Core & Main, a specialized distributor of water, wastewater, storm drainage and fire protection products, when she began in 2017, she charted a course to success by building out a team internally and externally. Today, her team has more than doubled in size, handling both marketing and communications for over 4,000 associates, 300 branches and $5 billion in revenue.\n\nTo do that, she first had to establish trust with top leaders to build a solid brand, vision and mission for the company, and now making sure that the brand, vision and mission are consistent in everything the company communicates internally and externally.\n\nGrowth at Core & Main has been achieved organically and through acquisitions. Noonan has supported the integration of new teams and new associates into the Core & Main culture.\n\nAdditionally, Noonan has established a great relationship with both the functional/support teams as well as the “boots on the ground,” which Core & Main calls “the field.” Meeting people where they have been as important to Noonan as being in the boardroom. This was especially crucial during COVID, connecting safety and human resources policy and procedures and safety measures.\n\nNoonan did the same most recently with a national sales and leadership meeting that assembled the comms team and representatives of all parts of the business to ensure the experiences, presentations, and rewards were meaningful to all involved.\n\nCongrats to Jennifer Noonan.\n\nVice President Program Communications and Partnerships\n\nKimmel Cultural Campus\n\nLeslie Patterson-Tyler’s focus positions Kimmel Cultural Campus as partner in performing arts, community\n\nLeslie Patterson-Tyler’s actions earn recognition in the Bridge Builders category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nCalled a “natural to this position,” Leslie Patterson-Tyler, vice president of program communications and partnerships on the Kimmel Cultural Campus has her finger on the pulse of Philadelphia as she leads comms for one of the region’s most impactful performing arts center.\n\nIn her role, Patterson-Tyler led a season-long partnership with Taller Puertorriqueño, Inc. – a community-based cultural organization known as The Cultural Heart of Latino Philadelphia –with a toy drive, artwork display and donation. She also facilitated a partnership renewal this fall.\n\nPatterson-Tyler’s relationships have helped grow the Kimmel’s annual holiday celebration and, in the fall of 2021, her team produced its yearly promotional video differently with a changed message to specifically encourage church populations as it was safe to return to the campus post COVID-closure.\n\nThis spring, Patterson-Tyler led planning of an annual Soulful ‘Thank You’ luncheon for pastors and directors. Through relationships created during this event, Kimmel has continued to foster relationships within the church community by acting as a yearly supporter of Wawa Welcome America Gospel on Independence. Patterson-Tyler also is an active member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. and thus facilitates events with local sororities as well.\n\nThese are just some of the highlights that led to Patterson-Tyler’s nomination.\n\nKudos to Leslie Patterson-Tyler.\n\nChief Marketing Officer\n\nMedia.Monks\n\nKate Richling, Media.Monks’ first CMO, brings marketing teams together with a common goal\n\nKate Richling’s efforts earn her a nod in the Bridge Builders category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nSince the Media.Monks brand launch last year, Chief Marketing Officer Kate Richling has helped integrate more than a dozen companies under a single name, a unitary structure, disrupting the traditional agency landscape. In her role, Richling manages marketing, PR, awards, and internal communications across 31 S4Capital markets. Media.Monks is the digital-first operating brand of S4Capital plc.\n\nIn 2022, the company added three brands and 2,000+ staff, and achieved 198 shortlists and 223 award wins. Under Richling’s lead, Media.Monks has earned recognition across all its offerings including AdExchanger’s Top 50 Programmatic Power Players, Webby’s Production Company of the Year, Campaign’s Social Media Agency of the Year and placement on Adweek’s Fastest Growing lists. Media.Monks also was featured in two Forrester Waves for the first time.\n\n“Kate leads her team in translating the perspectives of our 9,000-plus “Monks” into a single narrative for a global audience, empowering our diverse staff with a voice in the brand,” says Chief Growth Officer Joe Olsen, who nominated Richling for the award. “She values her team being in constant communication with the full spectrum of leaders across the organization, including staff at even the most recent of mergers, to start paving the way for their brand integration.”\n\nDuring her time with Media.Monks, Richling has brought marketing teams together and merged different marketing styles into one including functioning as a newsroom and interviewing a wide spectrum of stakeholders across the company.\n\nCongratulations to Kate Richling.\n\nUS Head of Internal Communications\n\nSpecialist Staffing Group\n\nArmentia Snyder-Anderson facilitates positive change at Specialist Staffing Group\n\nArmentia Snyder-Anderson’s actions have earned her recognition in the Bridge Builders category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nArmentia Snyder-Anderson knows firsthand the benefits of having an organizational culture committed to connectedness and collaboration.\n\nAs a member of the U.S. senior leadership team at Specialist Staffing Group, Snyder-Anderson has been a catalyst for positive change in the business by implementing a communications structure aligned with the company’s global priorities. Snyder-Anderson leads the U.S. internal communications function for Specialist Staffing Group, the U.S. arm of international STEM recruiting firm SThree Plc.\n\n“She is a leader and asset to any team, and her upbeat personality fits into and helps improve company culture,” says Specialist Staffing Group President Sunny Ackerman, who nominated Snyder-Anderson for the award. “Armentia is motivated by people, which is why she’s committed to connecting with every level of the business and creating a workplace where all feel valued. From our CEO to the desk level employee, to a colleague in Texas to a peer in Munich, Armentia’s spirit is magnetic.”\n\nBy leveraging relationships within the company’s global network of 40 office locations across 15 countries, all from the Chicago office, Snyder-Anderson has been able to advance the organizational strategy. With nearly 20 years of experience in public relations and internal communications, she has artfully built trust and relationships with employees throughout North America, Europe and Asia, according to Ackerman.\n\nTo accomplish these goals, Snyder-Anderson orchestrates monthly town halls (with an 86% attendance rate on average) hosted by regional leaders and the president to address employee questions, concerns and other topics. Survey feedback shows continuous employee satisfaction as a result.\n\n“Whether Armentia is leading communications efforts for a crisis situation, partnering with colleagues on an integrated marketing campaign, working with brand partners, or assisting the executive leadership team, she always provides valuable insights,” Ackerman adds. “She has gone above and beyond to give support and direction to help maintain the positive image of the enterprise.”\n\nKudos to Armentia Snyder-Anderson.\n\nSenior Manager, Global Public Affairs\n\nIntuit\n\nIntuit’s Sonko forges key small business alliances in public affairs\n\nMbessin Sonko has established herself as a trusted advisor, and Intuit as a leading figure in the small business policy space. She is an honoree in the Bridge Builders category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nA trusted advisor to key stakeholders, Mbessin Sonko, Intuit’s senior manager, global public affairs, knows that making deep connections is key. And she’s done that and more … elevating Intuit as a leading figure in the small business policy space.\n\nThrough Intuit’s partnership with the Small Business Roundtable, Sonko organized and managed an inaugural virtual global summit called Entrepreneurship Exchange 2021 (EX21). The event brought together policy leaders and key voices across the industry to discuss how to empower Intuit’s small business customers. Deemed a success with over 5,000 views, it paved the way for future Entrepreneurship Exchange events and elevated Intuit’s profile as a thought leader.\n\nTo do so, Sonko coordinated clear, constant, effective communications across all teams from Intuit to the EX21 stakeholders … bridge building. She led the development of all content and prep for panels, programs, and creative assets, working with Intuit’s QuickBooks team to ensure that every bit of branding was on-point. Sonko also formed connections with EX21’s speakers and sponsors, leading to greater participation and interest from other corporate sponsors like Visa and Meta.\n\nIn her role, Sonko consistently keeps her audience in mind, crafting messages with the perfect amount of context and detail. As a bridge builder, she continues to foster key partnerships to advance Intuit’s mission and create spaces for entrepreneurs to collaborate. She is, according to Intuit, “a shining example of what it means to be a true advocate and ally for small businesses.”\n\nCongrats to Mbessin Sonko.\n\nSenior Vice President Corporate Communications, Scientific Stature Services and Community Affairs\n\nRTI International\n\nRTI International’s Kami Spangenberg drives global scientific and research impact\n\nKami Spangenberg leads initiatives that share nonprofit research institute RTI International’s mission to improve the human condition by turning knowledge into practice. She’s a Bridge Builder honoree in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nIt seems apropos that Kami Spangenberg would be among the honorees in the Bridge Builder category. Among her accomplishments, RTI’s senior vice president of Corporate Communications, Scientific Stature Services and Community Affairs, launched a new digital experience on the RTI intranet aptly named “The Bridge,” which links staff to the impact of the institute’s global work, fostering greater connections across hybrid work experiences and equipping staff to be brand ambassadors. The site launched as Spangenberg and her team helped the institute fully reopen its facilities and implement initiatives to continue providing staff a great place to work.\n\nShe has led her team in achieving increased engagement on RTI.org among target accounts and clients, in publishing more than 1,000 important pieces of scientific literature, and in creating and pitching approximately 150 news announcements and press releases to international, national, local and trade publications.\n\nBridging internal and external stakeholders, Spangenberg facilitated RTI’s CEO transition by implementing a communication plan that included staff engagement through messages, meetings and events, and an executive thought leadership engagement strategy — media training, message development and media interviews. As part of her crisis communications and issues response portfolio, Kami also led the development of a social issues response framework and guidance for the institute, to help guide executive leadership decision-making. Last year overall, under Kami’s direction, RTI donated approximately $1M USD to nonprofits worldwide through Community Affairs, which has grown from two to seven key programs annually. She also serves as executive sponsor of RTI’s VALoR employee resource group serving Veterans and allies.\n\nCongrats to Kami Spangenberg.\n\nManager of Science Communications\n\nIdaho National Laboratory\n\nIdaho National Laboratory’s Nicole Stricker manages teams, delivers unified messaging\n\nAs she works to further the INL’s mission to a secure clean energy future, Nicole Stricker is recognized in the Bridge Builders category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nAs the science communications manager for Idaho National Laboratory, Nicole Stricker coordinates all research-based communication activity – both internal and external. The lab employs more than 5,400 researchers and support staff and has a $1.8 billion operating budget.\n\nStricker bridges efforts between separate research directorates in order for the lab to effectively communicate its research impact within the organization and to communities and stakeholders. Her work ensures that her two-dozen-plus team members work together on all communication activities, managing crossover efforts and delivering unified messaging.\n\nIn her role, Stricker also helps to make often complicated science concepts understandable by bridging the gaps between the lab and the public. This can most notably be seen in INL’s online presence. Over the last year, Stricker’s team efforts have resulted in 16.7 million social media impressions (a 33% increase over the previous year) as well as an 18% increase in followers, crossing 100,000 across all platforms.\n\nUnder her leadership, INL has received national coverage from various media outlets such as The Washington Post, CNBC and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nStricker also created an employee messaging resource on the value of nuclear energy (“Let’s Talk Nuclear”) in order to bridge communication gaps between laboratory researchers and the community.\n\nAfter the Netflix miniseries “Meltdown: Three Mile Island” hit the streaming service in 2022, Stricker organized a team to hold employee and public outreach Q&A panels to discuss the accident and cleanup. That same year Stricker also coordinated with a production team filming a four-part nuclear energy series for the “Tomorrow’s World Today” program on the Discovery and Learning channels.\n\nCongrats to Nicole Stricker.\n\nSenior Director of Communications\n\nBlank Rome LLP\n\nCollaboration internally and externally is key for Blank Rome’s Tavella\n\nKate Tavella forges relationships with internal and external stakeholders to launch new initiatives at Blank Rome LLP. She’s an honoree in the Bridge Builders category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nKate Tavella may not live by every letter of the law … but she has good reason. To build a communications strategy at the Am Law 100 ranked Blank Rome firm, with 14 offices and more than 600 attorneys and principals, you sometimes have to stretch the limitations. As senior director of communications, Tavella is called upon by the firm’s leadership, attorneys, and administrative professionals to strategize and implement communications plans — from firm policies to lateral onboarding, client initiatives, community engagement and event planning. Recognizing her strategic PR insight, attorneys bring Tavella into the conversation to navigate crisis situations and advise on communications … and promote big wins. She also manages the firm’s relationship with its external PR agency and other vendors, ensuring their efforts are aligned with the firm’s strategic business plan.\n\n“Kate [Tavella] is an integral member of our Blank Rome family. She has shepherded our firm — and its leadership — through major milestones during her tenure,” said Grant S. Palmer, Blank Rome’s managing partner and CEO. “She is an authentic communicator who understands the importance of remaining genuine when promoting our firm and sharing our stories with media, our clients, and the legal industry. Kate is a highly valued member of our firm.”\n\nAmong those milestones:\n\nSpearheading communications and programming for the firm’s first in-person All-Attorney Retreat in over a decade.\n\nProgram development for the firm’s annual Women’s Leadership Summit, bringing together the firm’s women attorneys, top clients and women industry leaders for networking and professional growth initiatives.\n\nAn integral member of Blank Rome’s Covid-19 Taskforce, formed in March 2020, to navigate the pandemic for both the firm’s professionals and clients.\n\nIn 2019, when Grant Palmer took over as Blank Rome’s managing partner and CEO, Tavella guided the firm’s communications strategy, securing coverage in key legal publications and ensuring a smooth leadership transition.\n\nLed the comms strategy and integration of 100+ attorneys from Dickstein Shapiro when they joined Blank Rome in 2016, the firm’s largest transaction in its 75-year history. She managed the needs of internal teams, clients and reporters, ultimately securing coverage in national and regional legal media markets.\n\nSays Chief Business Development and Marketing Officer James Stapleton, “After 35 years of leading marketing efforts at seven major professional services firms, I can honestly say Kate is the finest communications leader I have ever met. Her ability to coax the best communications from the broadest variety of people is exceptional.”\n\nCongrats to Kate Tavella.\n\nChief Operating Officer, Director of Client Services\n\nFrench West Vaughan\n\nFrench/West/Vaughan’s Natalie K. Best supports community giving personally and professionally\n\nFor Natalie Best, community giving is a way of life. Best’s actions have earned her a nod in the Community Givers category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nLeading by example, Natalie K. Best not only plays a major role in the growth of French/West/Vaughan — a full-service, integrated agency encompassing PR, public affairs, social media marketing, influencer marketing, advertising, and film/video production services – she also takes pride in charitable actions both professionally and personally. She often dedicates her personal time for the betterment of the industry, her alma mater, and for causes she is passionate about such as growing opportunities for women in business.\n\nAs the COO, director of client services at FWV, Best oversees areas such as new business development, agency hiring and internship programs, client relations and growth, and agency acquisitions. She also serves as the senior representative with industry organizations and as FWV’s most active senior leader as far as community relations activity locally, nationally and within the industry.\n\nBest also co-founded the Triangle Chapter of The Giving Party that has brought professional women ‘together-for-good’ on the past 10 post-Thanksgiving Thursdays, raising more than $500,000 for small local charities in the area.\n\n“I have never seen more of a Community Giver in my life than Natalie,” says FWV President David Gwyn, who nominated Best for the award. “What really separates Natalie from her peers, and something that certainly makes her the inspirational leader she is at FWV and our industry, is her hard work, passion and dedication to giving back to her community and to those institutions that shaped who she is today both professionally and personally.”\n\nKudos to Natalie Best.\n\nCEO + Founder\n\nEvolveMKD\n\nCEO Megan Driscoll makes philanthropic efforts a priority at EvolveMKD\n\nEvolveMKD reaches $1 million donation milestone thanks to CEO Megan Driscoll’s charitable mission. Driscoll’s actions garnered her recognition in the Community Givers category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nEver since the company’s beginnings, EvolveMKD CEO and founder Megan Driscoll has made it a mission to give back to the community. As a result, the public relations and digital marketing agency donates at least 10% of annual profits to programs that support women, children and teens.\n\nIn 2020 following the BLM movement, the donations began to include organizations supporting people of color, with the agency donating to a different group each week. This resulted in more than 35 individual donations to such organizations.\n\nDriscoll also encourages her employees to use their PTO to seek out events or participate in individual volunteerism.\n\nAs another push to support the community, EvolveMKD began quarterly agency-wide service days in 2022 where the whole team is invited to volunteer at area nonprofits such as Harlem Grown, Safe Horizons, God’s Love We Deliver and Project Glimmer.\n\nAnother way EvolveMKD supports the community is through a yearly employee-giving program where each employee can select a nonprofit for the agency to donate $1,000 on their behalf. As a result of all these charitable programs, EvolveMKD has reached more than $1 million in total donations since its foundation.\n\nKudos to Megan Driscoll.\n\nVice President - Public Relations\n\nPremier Inc.\n\nCalm in crisis, Amanda Forster’s efforts bring company growth\n\nWith her team, Amanda Forster established Premier, Inc as a go-to resource and leader across national, trade and broadcast outlets. Amanda Forster is an honoree in the Crisis Navigators category in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nIn her role as vice president of public relations, Amanda Forster is no stranger to dealing with crisis. Like many companies, communications efforts at healthcare improvement company Premier, Inc have been impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, potential railroad strikes, and the Ukraine/Russian war.\n\nUnder Forster’s leadership, Premier worked to secure opportunities that would establish the company as a go-to resource and leader across national, trade and broadcast outlets. With breaking news coverage, views to Premier’s blog have increased exponentially.\n\nForster’s team verified claims about product availability and utilized data and experts to forecast trends – not just comment on news reactively – creating a lasting impact on the healthcare and supply chain industries.\n\n“Forster’s team has delivered insights on best practices, creating healthy markets for goods and services, and improving the health of the communities Premier serves by communicating timely, accurate updates to customers, members, policymakers, and media grounded in the data and insights the team uncovers,” says Noah Zachary, senior director of public relations at Premier, Inc, who nominated Forster for the award.\n\nOver the last year, Forster worked with Premier’s leadership to elevate company voices around key issues during critical times to influence change with Premier. These efforts resulted in a renewed interest in ensuring domestic manufacturing of critical healthcare supplies, and more forward-looking plans of action across healthcare providers, suppliers and distributors regarding supply chain needs.\n\n“Forster fosters an encouraging environment for those within the company to feel safe coming forward with ideas, questions or concerns in relation to national events,” Zachary adds. “No matter how major the news is, she works with the team to ensure their internal stakeholders’ needs come first.”\n\nKudos to Amanda Forster.\n\nExecutive Director of Strategic Engagement and Crisis Communication\n\nDallas ISD\n\nDallas ISD’s Robyn Harris track record shows she’s a master crisis communicator\n\nIn a time when school safety is a top priority, Robyn Harris stepped up to the challenge. This is why Harris has earned recognition in the Crisis Navigator category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nThroughout her eight-year tenure as executive director of strategic engagement and crisis communication at Dallas Independent School District (ISD), Robyn Harris has helped shape the district’s reputation as a trusted source in moments of crisis. Examples of challenges she has helped navigate include the district’s decision to contest the governor’s mask mandate ban, the destruction of three campuses by a tornado, and an Ebola outbreak.\n\nIn August 2022, Harris also took on the challenge to spearhead efforts to communicate Dallas ISD’s Comprehensive Safety and Security Plan. She helped craft the plan and organized a press conference that all major local media outlets attended. With the recent Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas, fresh in everyone’s minds, reporters didn’t shy away from asking tough questions and Harris rose to the occasion by setting parameters, directing questions, and ensuring the media received factual information.\n\nHarris also helped improve crisis protocols to address the need for immediate and accurate school safety communication. This protocol includes gathering information from school leadership and crafting bilingual messages to distribute to stakeholders. Since October of 2021, Harris has overseen the creation of more than 225 letters that provided vital information to families.\n\n“As a guiding force in the communications department, Harris leads with one quote in mind when a crisis arises: ‘those in power MUST empower,’” says Caren Rodriguez, director of news and information at Dallas ISD, who nominated Harris for the award. “By leading with empathy, she empowers her team to make the best and most necessary decisions – even when tensions are high and information is fluid.”\n\nKudos to Robyn Harris.\n\nCommunication Director\n\nProvidence\n\nProvidence’s Beth Hegde battles misinformation during pandemic\n\nBeth Hegde is the go-to comms person in times of crisis. She is recognized in the Crisis Navigator category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nWhenever a crisis arises, one of the first calls made by hospital leaders is to Beth Hegde. In her role as communication director for all Providence hospitals and clinics in Eastern Washington, she is key to a strategic, intelligent and compassionate response, according to coworkers.\n\nWith more than two decades of public relations experience, Hegde has earned the role of communication director at Providence, a not-for-profit Catholic health care ministry in Washington. She manages a team of four public relations professionals who oversee internal communication, media relations, advertising, sponsorship and events, and social media.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, Hedge secured coverage with The New York Times, PBS NewsHour, CNN, as well as other local, regional and national outlets.\n\n“Through every crisis, Beth looks for learning opportunities for her team. She imparts wisdom and encouragement as she shapes the next generation of public relations leaders,” says Communication Manager Ariana Lake.\n\nWhen the region showed some of the lowest vaccination rates in the state, Hegde paved the way for a TV reporter to visit the hospital’s intensive care unit showing the toll of COVID-19. The resulting story garnered an Emmy nomination and national recognition.\n\nDuring one of the largest COVID-19 patient surges, Hegde proposed the Project Portrait to honor caregivers. The project included 1,200 photos of 457 caregivers from across Providence hospitals and clinics culminating with a permanent display and presentation covered by all the local news outlets.\n\nHegde also supported ideas to reshape Providence’s social media strategy in an effort to battle misinformation during the pandemic. Within one year, comments across three social channels increased 160.5% and engagement increased by 33 percent.\n\nHegde often shares her experience across the industry, most recently as the keynote and organizer for a multi-county PIO emergency management training.\n\n“Whether it’s a protesting family, or managing a multi-year health care crisis, Beth can do it all,” adds Lake. “She is a servant leader with an unwavering commitment to better her workplace, the community, and the public relations profession.”\n\nCongratulations to Beth Hegde.\n\nChief Marketing & Communications Officer\n\nBaptist Health South Florida\n\nChristine Kotler leverages Baptist Health South Florida’s reputation to bring COVID-19 awareness to the public. Her actions have earned her a nod in the Crisis Navigator category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nAs the chief marketing and communications officer at Baptist Health, the largest not‐for‐profit healthcare system in the South Florida region, Christine Kotler brings crisis leadership, as well as oversees all system‐wide branding, marketing, communications, media relations, social media, reputation management, digital and direct marketing, content marketing, and brand activation for the $5B organization.\n\nIn 2021, health care providers continued to deal with surges of sick patients, along with a fatigued and impatient community wanting to get back to normal life with COVID-19 entering its second year. In an effort to battle mixed messages from the mainstream media and online regarding the safety and efficacy of the vaccine, Kotler and her team developed a new outreach program that combined elements of public information, crisis communication and brand building. Baptist Health clinicians and frontline staff shared their experiences in the fight against COVID across multiple platforms while Kotler’s personal philosophy of “we’re all in this together” was infused into all internal and external COVID messaging.\n\nIn just one year, Baptist Health’s blog in English and Spanish gained 6.6 million page views and Baptist HealthTalk podcasts took an in-depth look at developing COVID topics. Electronic press kits that demonstrated the severity of the crisis were made available to regional and national media partners. Internally, an information campaign achieved a 99 percent vaccination rate among employees.\n\nCongratulations to Christine Kotler.\n\nDirector of Media Relations\n\nClearwater Marine Aquarium\n\nKelsy Long brings grace under pressure at Clearwater Marine Aquarium\n\nKelsy Long’s decision to share a famed dolphin’s illness journey and death is the first of its kind in the industry. Long’s actions have earned her recognition in the Crisis Navigators category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nWhile there is typically guarded privacy surrounding information regarding an animal’s illness in the zoo and aquarium industry, Clearwater Marine Aquarium’s Kelsy Long knew it was in the best interest of CMA to equate its communication strategy around famed dolphin Winter to that of any beloved human celebrity.\n\nIn her role as director of media relations, Long takes on all challenges thrown her way including vocalizing the organizations efforts to save manatees and critically endangered North Atlantic right whales and sea turtles, as well as promoting the aquarium as a tourist destination.\n\nClearwater Marine Aquarium, a marine life hospital and 501 C3 organization, is best known for rescued resident dolphin Winter, who lost her tail after becoming entangled in a crab trap. Her journey became a worldwide phenomenon featured in books and films such as “Dolphin Tale.” When Winter passed away in November 2021, shortly after her 16th birthday due to an intestinal abnormality, CMA followed a policy of transparency and decided to share Winter’s health journey with the public under Long’s leadership.\n\n“Kelsy’s attention to every detail during such a difficult time was unparalleled,” says Allison Garrett, communications specialist, NOAA Fisheries/U.S. Department of Commerce. “It takes a true communications professional to respond to and tell this story while dealing with the overwhelming sadness felt throughout her organization and the community.”\n\nLong prepared all talking points for the various audience types, arranged media outreach, coordinated onsite press conferences, worked with colleagues to set up memorials, and prepare media assets. Due to her efforts, the organization was commended for the decision to bring people along.\n\nKudos to Kelsy Long.\n\nSr. Manager, Corporate Communications, Issues & Crisis\n\nThe Home Depot\n\nHome Depot’s Margaret Smith prepares communications response after fire\n\nIn a crisis, Home Depot’s Margaret Smith is frequently the first one called. Smith’s accomplishments have earned her recognition in the Crisis Navigator category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nAs the senior manager of corporate communications, issues, and crisis at Home Depot, a global home improvement retailer, Margaret Smith is often the first person to get a call when a crisis arises.\n\nIn the spring of 2022, Smith received one such call when a California Home Depot store was on fire. The building was quickly evacuated and as the store continued to burn, Smith rallied partners to develop a simple yet effective strategy to handle the influx of media interest while keeping Home Depot associates and their concerns top of mind. The story was covered by every outlet in California and various top-tier national outlets, including Nightly News, CNN, Fox News, and CBS News. This resulted in thousands of news stories with more than 40% impacted by Smith and her messaging.\n\nWith Smith leading the PR response, a communications program was formed in the aftermath of the fire. She prepared messaging for HR leaders to share with displaced store associates, a CEO communication, and messaging for Home Depot government relations to share with city leaders and elected officials. Smith coordinated with teams across the company on the communications response.\n\nSmith also utilized internal social media to keep associates from the impacted store connected and able to receive timely updates from Home Depot leadership. A call to action for all Home Depot associates to send messages of encouragement to the displaced associates also was created, resulting in more than 500 messages collected across the country.\n\n“She brings a sense of calm to every sensitive issue, and she’s one of the safest pair of hands in the business,” says Home Depot Senior Manager of Public Relations & Corporate Communications Christina Cornell, who nominated Smith for the award. “Across Home Depot’s more than 2,300 stores, Margaret has earned a reputation among store managers as the person to call when you need help, because you know she’ll have your back, and she’ll deliver beyond expectations.”\n\nThis is just one example of Smith’s experience put into action.\n\nCongrats to Margaret Smith.\n\nManaging Partner\n\nIdentity\n\nAndrea Trapani drove Identity Marketing & Public Relations forward\n\nAndrea Trapani guided the Identity team through the Oakland school shooting crisis.

She also provided oversight for the development of six robust media and social media monitoring reports delivered in the week immediately following the shooting, with analysis of national sentiment and coverage of emerging topics and trends to help further support her counsel to the prosecutor and her office.\n\nOver the last year, Trapani established a new ongoing client relationship with a global hotel management company that includes managing an average of a dozen crisis situations each month with a focus on ensuring ultimate safety and wellbeing for guests and associates. Trapani provides support to hotel general managers for a variety of crisis situations occurring around the country, including managing media outreach, drafting statements on behalf of hotels, and providing recommendations for crisis management tailored to each unique situation.\n\nCongrats to Andrea Trapani.\n\nVice President\n\nDCG\n\nChelsea Radler’s data analysis skills prove knowledge is power at DCG\n\nDCG’s Chelsea Radler’s actions have earned her recognition in the Data Divas category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nChelsea Radler understands the importance of data.\n\nAs vice president at DCG Communications, a specialized communications consultancy focused on developing influential communications programs to help clients build brands and enhance their reputations, Radler doesn’t believe research should sit around gathering dust.\n\nOver the past year, Radler has designed, overseen and executed more than 30 research and evaluation projects on behalf of the U.S. Department of State.

Just the word can make people yawn. But data in Chelsea Radler’s hands is magical,” says DCG Director Karen Bell, who nominated Radler for the award.\n\nTo maximize data’s real-world impact, she mines it for key messages and lessons learned – connecting dots between themes and across projects. This knowledge becomes the most powerful tool in a communicator’s toolkit, forming the basis of strategic communications plans, new ways to segment audiences, and messaging frameworks that achieve the client’s mission. Her data insights are acted on at the highest levels in government.\n\nThis past fall, Radler managed a five-country project of 20 focus groups to collect public opinion data and inform how the United States can best communicate its shared values and priorities in Asia. Radler also moderated dozens of focus groups and interviews with public diplomacy practitioners that informed internal communications efforts and technology priorities.\n\nLast summer, Radler led the coordination of nearly 100 policy-centric focus groups in eight countries. The project required adapting methodology to local contexts and COVID-19 protocols to maintain safe and rigorous fieldwork. Her analysis will be used to inform messaging on climate change and democracy around the world.\n\nRadler also is known to share her expertise with others through mentoring a global team of more than 10 researchers. In addition, Radler has contributed to manuals on audience analysis and led trainings on using projective techniques in focus group moderation.\n\n“Chelsea makes sure her data is responsibly sourced, strategic, and actionable,” Bell adds. “Because of Chelsea’s efforts to incorporate more data into federal communication, knowledge is power.”\n\nCongrats to Chelsea Radler.\n\nSVP, Head of Innovation\n\nThe Bliss Group\n\nSally Slater’s insights make The Bliss Group a forward-thinking organization\n\nThe Bliss Group’s Sally Slater harnesses passion and creativity to identify organizational improvements.

At Ally, we’re intentionally conversational – we bend the traditional rules of corporate communications, evoke pop culture references, and create content – even when tackling difficult topics, like systemic racism – that’s approachable. It’s all reflective of the culture of inclusion we fiercely protect.”\n\nIn her role as executive director of corporate communications, Comstock leads the development and execution of Ally’s internal communication strategy and is the voice of the enterprise.

The effort resulted in DEI-focused features in AB InBev’s newsroom, the company’s weekly On Tap Newsletter and a leadership DEI training program.\n\nBut there’s more.

With her team, she secured key influencers like former U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro to appear alongside real-life home buyers and sellers in the film. The documentary sought to avoid coming across as a CENTURY 21 commercial, but as a piece of content that told a story of American life.\n\nPassionate about diversity, equity and inclusion, and as a Latina herself, Siegel has worked to develop, execute and promote CENTURY 21’s Empowering Latinas program, which awarded 121 Latina entrepreneurs with funding to secure their real estate licenses and provided support and mentorship to set them on a path towards success.\n\nThe program was initially launched in 2018 as a local market effort, but working closely with her team, Siegel was able to elevate the program to a national level in the past year. Speaking with many of the winners let Siegel see for herself the positive impact the program has had on their lives and how it helped them build generational wealth and provide crucial opportunities to Hispanic communities.\n\nOn top of her day-to-day role, Siegel leads the corporate team in community service work.\n\nCongrats to Erin Siegel.\n\nManager, Org Change and Engagement\n\nOntario Northland\n\nRenée Baker leads the charge in change management at Ontario Northland\n\nThe company’s first employee engagement survey was an overwhelming success, followed by action to show the company’s commitment. Baker is a Dynamic Do-er in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nWhen Ontario Northland, a 120-year-old transportation provider in northern Ontario, wanted to conduct its first ever employee engagement survey, Renée Baker was tasked with developing the communications approach. Leaders and executives there depend on Baker, manager of organizational change and engagement, to distill and translate opportunities, challenges and initiatives into clear, straightforward messages, so the assignment was right in her wheelhouse.\n\nWithin weeks, Baker developed a communication strategy and brand for the inaugural ON Voice employee engagement survey, which received a record response rate of 73% — a huge accomplishment considering 80% of the workforce are non-desk workers, spread across several locations and thousands of miles.\n\nOntario Northland now had the opportunity to not only listen to and understand its employees’ needs, but to act on the information and show employees that their voices matter. To turn insight into action, Baker and her team used the results from the survey as a foundation to engage employees across all levels the organization.\n\nConnecting across a dispersed workforce was a challenge, especially due to the Ontario Northland landscape and the nature of its demanding and often unpredictable work. Baker included interactive workshops, focus groups, 1:1 conversations, surveys and lunch-and-learns, all customized to stakeholder preferences and delivered across multiple channels (virtual, face-to-face, print).\n\nBaker’s portfolio was recently expanded to include the development of enterprise-wide change management competencies. Her implementation of strategies, methodologies, processes and tools have helped break down silos and embody new ways of working together.\n\nCongrats to Renée Baker.\n\nManager, Communications\n\nApplebee's Grill + Bar\n\nBatista juggles a variety of roles to keep Applebee’s on the radar\n\nAllegra Batista is in charge of an internal newsletter, video content and social media campaigns for the casual dining brand. Her achievements have made her a Dynamic Do-er in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nAs the communications manager for Applebee’s Bar + Grill, Allegra Batista wears many hats. One of her key tasks is collaborating with franchise partners and internal teams (from operations to leadership) to create and distribute the weekly internal newsletter “Core News,” distributed to 600 people each week; she’s responsible for ensuring its timely delivery stuffed with news, updates and information about the Applebee’s brand.\n\nBut there’s more: In addition to the weekly newsletter, Batista also is in charge of Team Member video content, which showcases the people who make Applebee’s what it is. Since February 2022, she’s traveled to seven states capturing content at 12 different Applebee’s locations.\n\nOn top of that, Batista is charged with growing brand awareness for Applebee’s on social media. The social space was a growth opportunity for the brand, especially among the Gen Z audience, so Batista led agency partners in creative content campaigns that have achieved an average engagement rate of 9% and more than 9.5 million social media impressions.\n\nTo position Applebee’s as a player on social media, Batista worked with agency teams to create a 360-campaign featuring the make-out song of the summer, “Taste My Face,” which dropped with the first-ever datable music video on National Wing Day and National Lipstick Day. The earned approach was designed to connect Applebee’s with its existing and newer audiences, and to help singles navigate the pandemic’s side effects on dating, from the halt of in-person dating to the fear of starting out again after months away from the dating scene.\n\nThe campaign drew more than 3.4 billion earned impressions, including mentions on The Today Show, Jimmy Fallon and the Drew Barrymore show. Additionally, Applebee’s saw a 5% increase in share of voice, 2.6 times more social brand mentions and eight times more brand engagements. Batista’s approach not only garnered a large number of impressions but reshaped the way Applebee’s appeals to its guests.\n\nCongrats to Allegra Batista.\n\nSenior Director, Global Communications, Culture and Brand Partnerships\n\nBacardi - PATRÓN Tequila\n\nMore buzz for the brand: Allie Bostwick boosted PATRÓN Tequila with collaboration\n\nEnlisting top F1 racers, streetwear designers and music stars helped raise visibility and coverage for PATRÓN. Bostwick’s success has made her an honoree as a Dynamic Do-er in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nAllie Bostwick started her career with PATRÓN Tequila as director of public relations in 2019. Now senior director, global communications, culture and brand partnerships, Bostwick has transformed PATRÓN from just a tequila to one of the most buzzed-about brands in culture, music, sports, entertainment and fashion.\n\nAmong her recent achievements, Bostwick brought PATRÓN into the world of Formula 1 racing. With the popularity of F1 rising, she established several first-time collaborations for PATRÓN, starting by partnering with Mexican racing icon Sergio “Checo” Perez. From there, Bostwick secured a partnership with F1 Paddock Club™, establishing PATRÓN as the first-ever exclusive tequila partner of the F1 trackside experience.\n\nIn addition, at the United States Grand Prix in Austin, PATRÓN won the No. 1 share of voice for earned media and social media, receiving multiple pieces of headline coverage from top-tier media, generating more than 500 million impressions for the brand and further solidifying PATRÓN as the most talked-about tequila brand against its competitors.\n\nBostwick also led two brand collaborations with famed streetwear designer John Geiger, both of which sold out in minutes. The first, centered around National Tequila Day 2021, featured a limited-edition streetwear collection inspired by PATRÓN Tequila’s annual Mexican Heritage Tin. A second collaboration, with the designer for Cinco de Mayo 2022, featured limited-edition PATRÓN x John Geiger GF-01 sneakers inspired by the brand’s agave fields in Mexico. The campaign won PATRÓN the No. 1 share of voice during this cultural holiday, gaining more than 75 pieces of coverage that generated more than 1.2 billion impressions for the brand.\n\nMost recently, Bostwick led PATRÓN Tequila’s newest and most prestigious product launch to date — PATRÓN EL ALTO. Under Bostwick’s leadership, PATRÓN brought together music legends and innovators like Missy Elliott and Hit-Boy to launch PATRÓN EL ALTO. She spearheaded all aspects of the marketing launch, including the national launch event and securing a partnership that brought Missy Elliot back to the stage for her first live performance in three years.\n\nTo date, PATRÓN EL ALTO has garnered 87 placements and 887 million impressions.\n\nCongrats to Allie Bostwick.\n\nExecutive Director of Communications\n\nBally Sports\n\nBurak leads the biggest transition in her company’s history: a full rebrand\n\nWhen B"
