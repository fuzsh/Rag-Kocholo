        "text": "The client.\n\nRoc Nation is one of the premier full-service entertainment companies in the world. Led by Jay-Z, the company represents some of the most recognizable stars in sports and entertainment, including Rihanna, Shakira, J. Cole, Big Sean, Yoenis Cespedes, Kevin Durant and Dez Bryant. Their presence is felt throughout popular culture and fashion. In less than 5 years, the company’s fashion brand, Paper Planes, has made an impact everywhere from the stoops of Brooklyn to the runways of Paris Fashion Week.\n\nThe challenge.\n\nRoc Nation came to Digital Impulse looking for help with Paper Planes, the company’s Emory Jones-led fashion brand. After years of making do with dated technology, the Planes site was in need of both front and backend help. The design no longer represented the look and feel of the brand, and the company’s growth was slowed by an ecommerce system no longer adequate for the demands of the business.\n\nThe solution.\n\nWe partnered with Roc Nation to refresh the front-end style of the site, and transition Planes from an antiquated ecommerce platform onto Shopify Plus. Along the way, we reconfigured the company’s online processing and fulfillment, fraud detection, and overhauled the structure of their entire product catalog.\n\nThe big transition.\n\nOur technology team partnered with Planes product managers to make the ecommerce platform switch as seamless as possible. After extensive research, we identified Shopify Plus as the best fit for Planes. Digital Impulse worked with Planes’ vendor to manage SKU exports from the current system and into Shopify, setting up processing and fulfillment as well as optimizing all front-end product information."
