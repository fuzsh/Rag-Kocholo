        "text": "Take a look inside the museum-worthy offices of rapper and record executive Jay-Z’s entertainment agency, Roc Nation.\n\nBy Rachel Gallaher\n\nLobby at Roc Nation's New York headquarters. Image by Eric Laignel.\n\nRivaling the many surrounding art galleries and museums in the New York’s tony Chelsea neighborhood, the new Roc Nation offices—home to much of founder and rapper Jay-Z’s personal art collection—are as innovative and statement-making as the music that comes out on the label. With sleek and masculine details that serve as a background to display art, the offices, designed by architect Jeffrey Beers, founder and CEO of award-winning design studio Jeffrey Beers International, features vibrant album covers, an array of artist photographs, athlete Jerseys and paraphernalia, and pieces from Paper Planes, Roc Nation’s apparel brand. Given the challenge of designing four floors of space and a rooftop terrace, Beers approached the project wanting to capture the creative spirit of Roc Nation, but also allow executives freedom to express themselves through the art and décor in their individual offices.\n\nPrivate reception area on the 6th floor of the Roc Nation offices.

To highlight it, we ensured the offices and corridors looked and feel liked a gallery space.” To achieve this look Beers employed the repeated use of key materials including the industrial-leaning buffed concrete and black metal, as well as walnut wood, “for contrast and warmth.”\n\nArchitect Jeffrey Beers used an Italian glass office system for a sleek, sophisticated look. Image by Eric Laignel.\n\nIndividual offices run along long corridors and are framed with glass walls and black metal detailing—the glass walls help workers feel connected even when their office doors are shut and help to bring as much natural light into the interior spaces as possible. “The Italian glass system used ensures the glass is flushed to the metal frame as well as gives a reflective effect,” Beers notes, “while sidelights between offices ensure the corridors are light-filled and feel wide.”\n\nAn executive office designed by Jeffrey Beers.

The social media lounge (exactly what it sounds like) features a large bank of monitors and faux-leather paneling flanking sleek curved sofas in a royal-blue hue.\n\nThe social media theater at the Roc Nation offices.

Intended primarily for social media, it is also fully customizable and can act as a shared working space, office theater, and more.”\n\nThe rooftop terraces double as an outdoor workspace on warm-weather days.
