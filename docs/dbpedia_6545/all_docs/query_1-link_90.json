        "text": "Roc Nation has spearheaded plenty of philanthropic initiatives in the past, and Jay-Z’s company’s latest campaign hones in on improving youth education for students in Philadelphia.\n\nThe Roc announced an initiative on Friday (June 7) that will assist students with about $300 million in scholarships. The funding will give underprivileged kids in grades K-12 the opportunity to attend prestigious private schools and various educational institutions across Philly.\n\nRoc Nation will look to spread awareness by hosting events running daily from June 10 to June 21 throughout the greater Philadelphia area. Those in attendance will have the chance to learn more about the PASS program (Pennsylvania Award for Student Success), which is also known as Senate Bill 757.\n\n“We have enjoyed such a special connection with Philadelphians, so we’ve made it our mission to invest in the long-term success of the city’s changemakers,” said Roc Nation Managing Director of Philanthropy Dania Diaz in a statement. “Impact starts with the students and with awareness. We want to empower the youth and families with the knowledge to pursue their scholastic dreams, make their voices heard and become the leaders of tomorrow.”\n\nScholarship amounts for students vary depending on their age group and education level. Half-day kindergarteners will receive $2,500, K-8th graders get $5,000, while high schoolers can secure $10,000. Special needs children of any age will be eligible to collect $15,000 in scholarship funding. For a student to be able to receive a scholarship, their family cannot make more than 250 percent of the federal poverty threshold, which currently sits at $75,000 for families of four.\n\nHov and Roc Nation are no strangers to uplifting and connecting with the Philadelphia community throughout the years. The Roc previously hosted the annual Made In America festival on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, and the REFORM Alliance has assisted in passing legislation to help citizens on parole or probation in Pennsylvania.\n\nFind the Roc Nation information schedule for the program below."
