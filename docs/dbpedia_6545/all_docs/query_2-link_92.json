        "text": "Roc Nation has secured a “transformative” multi-year deal with Versace, according to Complex. The deal entails event sponsorships in addition to scholarship sponsorships for the Roc Nation School of Music, Sports & Entertainment. The duo is coming together for other “cause-focused initiatives” as well.\n\n“Central to both Versace and Roc Nation is human capital and a commitment to creative empowerment, celebrating individuality and fueling positive change,” Roc Nation wrote in a press statement, according to the outlet. “Championing artists across music, entertainment, and broader cultural landscapes will be underscored through the partnership.”\n\nThe outlet notes that the multi-year partnership began on Feb. 9 as Versace sponsored the Roc Nation Sports 2024 Super Bowl event.\n\nPrior to teaming up with Versace, Roc Nation has been spearheading initiatives that boost empowerment. As previously reported by AFROTECH, the company has partnered with Reform Alliance to help New York residents who are single parents, formerly incarcerated, veterans, and members of poverty alleviation and workforce development. In 2021, the collaboration involved a job fair that offered access to thousands of job opportunities as well as an array of resources such as interview preparation, grooming services, and professional attire.\n\n“The Team Roc New York Job Fair is a real opportunity for socio-economic mobility for New Yorkers – those who want to work, yet have not had the exposure or connections to the right-fit jobs, or to the support services that can strengthen their prospects for employment,” Dania Diaz, Team Roc managing director, shared in a press release. “It is also a chance for us to work together – public, private, nonprofit sectors – to address the state’s labor shortages in a meaningful way.”"
