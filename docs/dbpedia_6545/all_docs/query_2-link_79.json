For those unaware Jay-Z is a rapper turned billionaire mogul who is married to the absolutely amazing Beyonce Gizelle Knowles-Carter.\n\nNotably Skylar Diggins-Smith has been with them for years hence the higher profile\n\nThis is huge for the Lady Vols because it connects us more to The Black Culture which is something that is missing. We have black women playing on this squad so signing with a management group like this should help her attain deals more directly in line with who she is, where she comes from, and connects with people from those communities. It may sound strange to some but growing her fanbase within the black community will also help her to cement legacy. We’ve seen what happens with a Sylvia Fowles who had very little fanfare as she retired in comparison to Sue in the same year and that comes from marketing and branding. Syl shoulda been long regarded as one of the best centers of all time same as Sue has been for her entire career. This is imo one of THE BEST moves someone could make and I’m happy we finally have a LV who was able to do it.\n\nAlso, while OMD is amazing they aren’t totally in tune with the culture and so there are things that kinda fall by the wayside on what the black fans would find dope with regards to apparel. If they step that up like Playa Society does with the Gamecocks they’d see a huge increase in support for sure. I’ve long said, give me a LV sweatsuit because the hoodie is cute af but a full sweat suit?\n\nThis is huge. RocNation as in Jay-Z RocNation.

Jordan's later stuff does too. It might be worth reaching out to Alumni Hall who owns Orange Mountain Designs to express some of the wants. If enough of us do that, it could make a difference.\n\nI've attached Rickea's latest NIL shirt from the Vol Shop (1st attachment) and OMD's latest (2nd attachment).\n\nRickea also has her own line at www.rickeajackson.com.\n\nAttachments\n\nScreenshot_20230808_142155_Chrome.jpg\n\nScreenshot_20230808_142224_Google.jpg"
