        "text": "Cameron Brink\n\nOne of the most recognizable and influential athletes in the world, Cameron Brink is the newest member of the Los Angeles Sparks, having been selected #2 overall in the 2024 WNBA Draft. A Champion on the floor and a budding entrepreneur off the court, Cameron is an accomplished basketball player, businesswoman, and advocate for girls and women.\n\nIn High School, Cameron was named a McDonald's All-American, Jordan Brand Classic All-American, and Gatorade Oregon Player of the Year twice. While at Stanford, Cameron was a force since she stepped foot in Maples Pavilion: she won an NCAA Championship, was twice named Pac-12 Player of the Year, and amassed three Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year awards. She also holds the Stanford record for blocked shots. Cameron's achievements have extended to international competition as well, where she has earned multiple gold medals with USA Basketball, winning the 2019 FIBA Under-19 and Under-18 World Cups, and recently won MVP and a gold medal at the FIBA World Cup in Vienna in 2023.\n\nIn addition to her on-court prowess, Cameron was at the forefront of recently enacted legislation allowing student-athletes to market their Name, Image, and Likeness. She used this opportunity and unique platform to raise awareness on mental health and combined her on-court leadership skills to help empower young girls through various philanthropic efforts. Her partnerships include Optimum Nutrition, Urban Decay, Olipop, Sally Hansen, Legal Zoom, SKIMS, Bumble, and many more. Recently, she signed a record-breaking shoe and apparel deal with New Balance, becoming the first female basketball athlete to ever be signed by the company.\n\nCameron has also made a conscious effort to make a difference as a role model and mentor, hosting an annual basketball camp for young girls called Next22, with a goal of helping these campers develop the necessary on-court and off-court skills to achieve their individual goals in life.\n\nCameron was born in Princeton, New Jersey and raised in Beaverton, Oregon.\n\nKevin Durant\n\nKevin Durant is a 14-year NBA veteran and forward for the Phoenix Suns. He is a 2x NBA Champion and Finals MVP, having also won an NBA MVP Award, four NBA scoring titles, two Olympic gold medals, two NBA All-Star Game MVP Awards, 13x NBA All-Star, and an NBA Rookie of the Year Award. He is also included in the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.\n\nOff the court, Durant is co-founder of Thirty Five Ventures (35V) alongside his business partner Rich Kleiman. Founded in 2016, 35V incorporates the duo’s business entities across sports, tech, media, philanthropy, and more.\n\n35V’s portfolio includes Boardroom, a media network covering the business of sports, entertainment, and culture; ownership stakes in emerging and undervalued teams sports properties, including Athletes Unlimited, Gotham FC, Philadelphia Union, Premier Lacrosse League, and Major League Pickleball; film and TV projects including the Academy Award-winning Two Distant Strangers (Netflix), the critically acclaimed scripted series SWAGGER (Apple TV+) and documentary NYC Point Gods (Showtime.) The company’s investment portfolio also includes 100+ early stage investments.\n\nThe Durant Family Foundation’s signature programs include Build It and They Will Ball, a global basketball court renovation project with 28 courts completed to date, and The Durant Center, a 10-year, 10-million dollar program in partnership with College Track that helps low-income and underserved students enroll and graduate from college. Durant received the season-long NBA Cares Community Assist and ESPN Muhammad Ali Sports Humanitarian awards in 2018.\n\nRob Manfred\n\nRobert D. Manfred, Jr. was elected as the 10th Commissioner in the history of Major League Baseball on August 14, 2014 by vote of the 30 Major League Clubs. He officially became the sport’s leader on January 25, 2015. On July 26, 2023, Club owners again re-elected Manfred to another term through January 25, 2029.\n\nSince Manfred began as Commissioner, two labor agreements have continued MLB’s streak of uninterrupted play on the field since 1995, an unprecedented span of at least 31 consecutive seasons. In a landmark transaction in 2017, The Walt Disney Company acquired a 75% stake in BAMTech, a leading technology platform and video streaming company created by MLB. In 2022, the sport’s revamped joint Competition Committee approved a series of historic changes to rules, which followed several years of fan polling and experimentation in the Minor Leagues. The fan-driven steps that debuted in 2023 have dramatically improved pace of play, increased action and allowed for increased athleticism on the field. The average time of a nine-inning game in 2023 (2:40) decreased by 24 minutes from 2022 and 30 minutes since 2021, and MLB had its most stolen bases in a season since 1987. The 2023 season produced a +9.6% boost in attendance over 2022, the sport’s best year-over-year increase since 1993.\n\nManfred has overseen the development of closer relationships with youth baseball and softball organizations and has allocated new resources toward improving MLB’s presence in the amateur ranks. Under his leadership in 2015, MLB launched its signature PLAY BALL youth engagement program, which has resulted in meaningful increases in baseball and softball participation, per the Sports & Fitness Industry Association (SFIA). Baseball and softball again combined to be the most participated sport in the United States among kids ages 6 to 12 with more than 6.5 million participants. In the first five years after the start of PLAY BALL, casual participation in baseball increased by nearly 90%.\n\nManfred has prioritized sustaining the game’s international growth, including through global events like the 2023 World Baseball Classic. In 2016, MLB returned to Cuba for the first time since 1999 as the Tampa Bay Rays played an historic exhibition game vs. the Cuban National Team on March 22nd at Estadio Latinoamericano in Havana, jointly attended by President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raúl Castro. In 2018, MLB staged regular season games in Puerto Rico and Mexico. In 2019, MLB opened its regular season in Japan, played multiple series in Mexico, and held an historic June series in London, which were the sport’s first games ever played in Europe. MLB has also taken the game to non-traditional domestic locations with groundbreaking events in recent seasons at Fort Bragg, North Carolina; in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, home of the Little League World Series; and in Omaha, Nebraska, home of the NCAA’s Men’s College World Series. In August 2021 and again in August 2022, MLB held a regular season game at the famed Field of Dreams site in Iowa, celebrating the beloved baseball film. The 2021 White Sox-Yankees contest was MLB’s most-watched regular season game since 1998. In 2024, MLB played its first-ever regular season games in South Korea with a season-opening series and, the day after Juneteenth, held a tribute to the Negro Leagues by playing a game at Birmingham, Alabama’s legendary Rickwood Field, where Willie Mays played as a teenager.\n\nIn 2020, Manfred oversaw the successful completion of a season impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, prioritizing health and safety in its operations and creativity on and off the field. MLB became the first sports league to start and finish a season during a pandemic, doing so in its home markets as a powerful visual example to fans of a responsible return to the workplace. The 2020 season included a streak of 59 consecutive days without a positive test among players; a positivity rate of 0.05% among Major League players and staff; and a schedule with 99.8% of its 900 games played, missing only two games that had no Postseason ramifications.\n\nPrior to being elected Commissioner, Manfred had served as MLB’s Chief Operating Officer since 2013, managing the Commissioner’s Office in New York on behalf of Commissioner Allan H. (Bud) Selig. From 1998-2013, Manfred served as Executive Vice President, overseeing labor relations, economics and league affairs and directing all collective bargaining with the MLBPA. Competitive balance has been a hallmark of MLB the last two decades, as there have been 15 different World Series Champions in the last 22 seasons, the most variety of champions in professional sports during that span. In addition, no Club has repeated as a World Champion since 2000, an active streak that is the longest in the history of not only MLB, but all professional sports. Manfred also represented MLB on all upgrades to the game’s Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program, the toughest in American professional sports.\n\nUnder Manfred’s leadership, MLB has formed core partnerships with Boys & Girls Clubs of America, the Jackie Robinson Foundation and Stand Up To Cancer. In 2020, Manfred corrected a longtime mistake in the game’s history by conferring Major League status on the Negro Leagues, allowing future generations to more easily learn about this pivotal chapter and its meaning to the sport. Manfred has served as a member of the Board of Directors of the Sports Lawyers Association and the Partnership for Clean Competition. He currently serves on the Board of DREAM, a nonprofit that uses the power of teams to inspire youth to recognize their potential. In April 2016, Manfred received the Judge William B. Groat Award from his alma mater, honoring outstanding professional achievement and service to Cornell’s ILR. In November 2017, Manfred received the Jacob K. Javits Lifetime Achievement Award from the Greater New York Chapter of the ALS Association for MLB’s efforts against Lou Gehrig’s Disease. In 2021, Manfred established MLB’s new annual Lou Gehrig Day to continue the game’s support in the fight against ALS.\n\nManfred is a 1980 graduate of the School of Industrial and Labor Relations (ILR) at Cornell University. In 1983, he received his law degree magna cum laude from Harvard Law School, where he was an articles editor of the Harvard Law Review. Manfred was a part of the Labor and Employment Law Section of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, LLP, and became a partner in the firm in 1992.\n\nManfred, a native of Rome, New York who was born in 1958, has been married to his wife Colleen since 1982. The New York residents have four adult children.\n\nRich Paul\n\nRich Paul is the CEO and founder of KLUTCH Sports Group, the powerhouse agency representing some of the biggest athletes across major professional sports. Paul founded KLUTCH Sports in 2012 in his hometown of Cleveland, Ohio, where he forged a unique and personal approach to representing top NBA talent – putting athletes first and empowering them to build careers and brands on and off the court.\n\nIn 2019, KLUTCH Sports partnered with United Talent Agency (UTA). Paul serves as UTA’s Co-Head of Sports and is an agency partner, and was appointed to UTA’s Board of Directors in 2020. In 2019, Paul was named GQ’s “PowerBroker of the Year” and “The King Maker” on the cover of Sports Illustrated. In 2021, TIME recognized KLUTCH Sports on its first-ever list of TIME100 Most Influential Companies, and Variety recently named Paul to their “Variety500” list of the most influential business leaders shaping the global media industry. Paul is also credited with driving the reversal of the so-called “Rich Paul Rule,” which would have banned agents without a college degree from representing NCAA student athletes.\n\nIn 2021, Paul and three former Nike executives formed a company called ADOPT, a creative agency focused on sport, wellness, nutrition, tech and other consumer facing products. Paul joined the Board of Trustees of LACMA and the Board of Directors of Designer Brands Inc. in 2022 and the Board of Directors of Live Nation in 2023. Paul is also a minority partner of The SpringHill Company.\n\nIn 2023, Paul also became a New York Times best-selling author with the release of his memoir, Lucky Me.\n\nMatt King\n\nAs the Chief Executive Officer at Fanatics Betting & Gaming, Matt is responsible for navigating Fanatics’ entrance into the online sports gambling and iGaming businesses. He brings decades of industry experience and has a proven track record of providing safeguards for consumers and upholding responsible gaming initiatives.\n\nPrior to Fanatics, he was Chief Executive Officer of FanDuel, spearheading the company’s growth into one of the most respected global Daily Fantasy Sports and gambling brands. Under Matt’s leadership, FanDuel’s revenue grew from $120 million seven years ago to nearly $2 billion.

Matt also spent 11 years at KKR Capstone where he held various positions focused on creating new business and improving the performance of its portfolio companies.\n\nMarie Donoghue\n\nMarie Donoghue is the Chief Business & Growth Officer on the executive leadership team at DraftKings. Donoghue joined DraftKings in January 2024 to drive corporate innovation and expansion, focusing on discovering new, sustainable growth opportunities that align with DraftKings’ commitment to excellence in product and customer experience.

Before Amazon, she was Executive Vice President of Global Business & Content Strategy at ESPN, where she managed business affairs, business development, partnerships, ESPN Films and the creation of several award-winning digital properties.\n\nDonoghue studied economics at Columbia University, where she also attended law school and obtained her JD.\n\nChristian Genetski\n\nChristian serves as President of FanDuel Group, and is responsible for business development, partnership, corporate strategy, and the company’s government affairs efforts.\n\nPreviously FanDuel’s Chief Legal Officer, Genetski has played a historic role working with legislators, regulators and industry counterparts across the United States to unlock sports betting in the U.S., build the regulatory framework operators follow, and do so in a manner that positioned FanDuel for success. Genetski navigated the company and the Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) industry through a series of existential regulatory challenges, driving an effort that ultimately legalized and regulated DFS in more than 20 states to build a bridge for the company’s entry into sports betting and i-gaming following the repeal of PASPA by the United States Supreme Court in 2018. Genetski’s tenure is also highlighted by his leadership in securing FanDuel’s market access footprint, including ground-breaking market access partnerships with professional sports franchises, as well as the official partnerships the company enjoys with the NBA, NFL, NHL and PGA TOUR.\n\nPrior to joining FanDuel, Genetski was Senior Vice President and General Counsel of the Electronic Software Association (ESA), the U.S. trade group for the video game industry, a partner in AmLaw 50 law firms, and a co-founder of his own boutique firm.

He holds a B.A. from Birmingham-Southern College and earned his J.D. from the Vanderbilt University School of Law.\n\nChristian is a big D.C. sports fan of the Nationals, Capitals and Wizards, but his first sports love is the Alabama Crimson Tide.\n\nGrant Hill\n\nOne of the most accomplished NBA and college players of his generation, Grant Hill was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame as a first-ballot member of the 2018 class.
