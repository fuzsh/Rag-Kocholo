        "text": "Roc Nation and Versace have a new partnership to enhance both brands. According to Complex, the luxury fashion house and music label have combined their interests for a multiyear deal. Together, the companies will focus on event sponsorships as well as “cause-focused initiatives,” such as providing scholarships for the Roc Nation School of Music, Sports & Entertainment.\n\n“Central to both Versace and Roc Nation is human capital and a commitment to creative empowerment, celebrating individuality and fuelling positive change,” details a press release per Complex. “Championing artists across music, entertainment, and broader cultural landscapes will be underscored through the partnership.\n\nThe partnership will initiate with Versace sponsoring the Roc Nation Sports 2024 Super Bowl event.\n\nKicking off at Super Bowl LVIII continues Roc Nation’s presence in the NFL. The two entities began a partnership in 2019, with JAY-Z and Roc Nation becoming the Live Music Entertainment Strategist for halftime show performances. The role has earned the “Song Cry” rapper multiple Emmy Awards.\n\n“We don’t want people to come in and necessarily agree with us; we want people to come in and tell us what we can do better,” detailed NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell at the time. “I think that’s a core element of our relationship between the two organizations, and with Jay and I personally.”\n\nSince the deal, performers at the big game have included Shakira, Jennifer Lopez, The Weeknd, Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, Mary J. Blige, Kendrick Lamar, Eminem, and Rihanna. This year, Usher is set to bring an R&B showcase as the headlining act."
