        "text": "“Jay-Z is back home.”\n\nSo touted an email announcing a new global partnership between Roc Nation, the full-service entertainment company founded by the rapper-turned-mogul, and Universal Music Group. Previously aligned with Sony Music, the multi-year deal is effective immediately.\n\nAlthough financial terms were not disclosed, a release revealed that the Roc Nation music label will operate as a standalone label within the UMG family. As part of the agreement, forthcoming albums from Jay-Z, Rihanna and others will be sold worldwide via UMG.\n\nPHOTOS: Grammys 2013: Inside the Industry’s Biggest Bashes\n\nSaid UMG chairman and CEO Lucian Grainge, who in February was named Billboard’s most powerful person in music: “In just five years, Roc Nation has established itself as one of the most successful brands in music with a reputation for developing some of today¹s most influential and popular talent. Not only does this agreement provide a dynamic platform for Roc Nation’s exciting emerging artists, it extends our relationship with the extraordinary Rihanna and represents a homecoming for Jay-Z — a brilliant artist and entrepreneur, who has been a creative cornerstone of our company.”\n\nJay-Z praised the executive for orchestrating “a new age deal — being able to continue to operate as an independent label with the strength, power and reach of the best major. … It feels good to be home.”\n\nINFOGRAPHIC: Rihanna’s ‘777’ Plane Tour: How the Disastrous Publicity Stunt Spawned Album Sales\n\nThe rapper also recently announced a new partnership with CAA Sports, management company Roc Nation sports, which will represent athletes. Its first signing: the Yankees’ Robinson Cano. Recent additions to Roc Nation’s music management roster include Kylie Minogue, Timbaland and M.I.A.\n\nUniversal Music Group is a fully owned subsidiary of Vivendi. Shares of the company were down a tenth of a percent to 16.21 EUR in early morning trading."
