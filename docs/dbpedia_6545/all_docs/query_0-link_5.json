This document is a court filing that contains an answer and counterclaim from defendant Roc Nation Apparel Group (RNAG) in response to a first amended complaint from plaintiffs Iconix Brand Group and related entities. RNAG denies engaging in any infringing conduct or violating any agreements. All exploitation of the ROC NATION brand by RNAG was pursuant to an agreement with plaintiffs, so RNAG denies the claims against it as baseless. The court has jurisdiction over the Lanham Act claims and supplemental jurisdiction over related state law claims. RNAG does business in the district but denies shipping or selling any infringing goods.",
