A picture of the Bank of America Plaza.

The Bank of America Plaza in Dallas, Texas is the tallest skyscraper in Dallas. Standing at a structural height of 281 meters (921 feet), it is also the third tallest building in Texas and the 18th tallest building in the United States. The building contains 72 stories of office space. Construction was begun in 1983 and finished in 1985.

The building is located at 901 Main Street in downtown Dallas, Texas.

The building's structure is accented at night by green argon lighting that outlines all of the building's edges (see picture below). It was one of the first buildings in the United States to receive the Energy Star award for electrical efficiency.

The building was originally called the Main Center, and then NationsBank Plaza, before being renamed the Bank of America Plaza in 1998. It was the only tower built out of an original four-tower plan, one of which was to be the same height (a twin tower). It was designed by the architectural firms JPJ Architects Inc and HLM Design.
