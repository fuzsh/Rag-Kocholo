        "text": "Bank of America Plaza is the tallest building in the Dallas skyline at an impressive 72 stories and 1.9 million square feet. Located in the Central Business District (CBD), it is home to a wide array of the regionâ€™s most prestigious businesses.\n\nThe building had an existing thermal storage system when Texas AirSystems was approached to conduct a chiller changeout. With 2.1 million gallons of thermal storage used to cool the building during the day, Texas AirSystems recommended a York system that allowed for more tonnage out of each machine than the original system's design. This increased efficiency allows for a quicker chiller shutdown at night, keeping overall operating costs down and saving its tenants over $600,000 a year."
