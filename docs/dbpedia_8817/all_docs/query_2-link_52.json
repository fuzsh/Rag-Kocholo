        "text": "Verification Method\n\nUL’s Healthy Buildings Verification Mark for Indoor Air demonstrates that indoor spaces provide healthy indoor air quality (IAQ). It shows a commitment by building owners and managers to create and maintain indoor environments that support tenant health, well-being and comfort, backed by UL’s globally recognized expertise in IAQ and building health. These buildings meet rigorous performance criteria and have policies and plans in place for continual advancement of IAQ. To achieve the UL Healthy Buildings Verification Mark, spaces underwent a desktop audit and on-site visits that include visual inspections and performance testing to evaluate a range of building conditions. The program includes an annual comprehensive assessment coupled with surveillance at the mid-year point. The IAQ testing requirements verify that the building air meets rigorous standards. These standards are aligned with industry-recognized, third-party organizations such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), among others. All laboratory testing and analysis methodologies are informed by the EPA Compendium of Methods, ASTM D5197 and TO-17 for air sampling, and EPA methods."
