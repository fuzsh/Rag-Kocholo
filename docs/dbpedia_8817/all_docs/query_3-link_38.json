        "text": "Construction has started on what will be the tallest office building in Dallas’ Uptown district.\n\nThe 30-story high-rise called Parkside Uptown is being built overlooking Klyde Warren Park and will house Bank of America’s Dallas offices when it opens in 2027.\n\n“This is another demonstration of our commitment to North Texas,” said Jennifer Chandler, Bank of America’s Dallas president. “We are incredibly excited to break ground on this beautiful building that will prominently display the Bank of America brand.”\n\nAbout 1,000 Bank of America workers housed in the bank’s namesake 72-story skyscraper on Main Street will be moving to the new tower. The bank will take up about half of the project.\n\n“This will give us the opportunity to take many of our teammates under one roof, which will better serve our clients,” Chandler said. “Just look at where we are — the walkability, the culture, the excitement of Klyde Warren Park is right outside our doorstep.”\n\nThe bank will occupy about 238,000 square feet in the building, which is a project of Pacific Elm Properties, developer KDC and property owner Miyama USA Texas.\n\nThe building is being designed by New York-based architect Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates, working with Dallas-based Corgan and OJB Landscape Architecture.\n\nPacific Elm Properties — headed by investor Tom Dundon and CEO Jonas Woods — joined the project KDC first announced back in 2020.\n\n“This would not be happening today if not for the team that came together,” Woods said. He said the new high-rise will be “one of the true icons and trophy office towers in Dallas.”\n\nThe building will include a 12th-floor “sky lobby and lounge,” outdoor terraces on four floors and ground-level retail spaces.\n\nSteve VanAmburgh, CEO of KDC, said his firm has been working with Bank of America on the project for about 20 months and only recently got it across the finish line.\n\n“The capital markets are really difficult right now,” VanAmburgh said. “This wouldn’t be happening without the bank, Jonas Woods and Tom Dundon making this project a reality.”\n\nVanAmburgh said the ground level of the building is designed as almost an extension of the park. “It looks like the building was made to sit here,” he said.\n\nKDC is North Texas’ most experienced corporate office developer, having built major campuses for companies including Toyota, JPMorgan Chase, State Farm Insurance, Citigroup, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas and Liberty Mutual Insurance.\n\nThe property firm is developing an almost $500 million campus in Irving for Wells Fargo.\n\nBank of America will be the second major downtown Dallas bank to recently shift its offices to a site on Klyde Warren Park. Chase recently moved its main office from Ross Avenue to Hunt Consolidated’s building at Woodall Rodgers Freeway and Akard Street.\n\nBank of America occupies about a half million square feet of offices in the Bank of America Plaza — Dallas’ tallest skyscraper at 901 Main St."
