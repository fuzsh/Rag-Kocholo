But those fortunate enough to be traversing downtown in the predawn hours Wednesday morning were treated to a brief preview.\n\nThe lights, as you see in the picture above, are no longer green, at least not permanently. The old argon tubes have been replaced with modern LEDs as part of a multimillion-dollar renovation of the tower, and the LEDs can be programmed to change color.\n\nChicago-based Metopolis Investment Holdings hasn't revealed its plans for the new lights, whether it intends to keep them mostly green or turn them into some trippy Omni-style light parade. We're hoping for the former.\n\nAnd here's a video:\n\nBOA LED Test Pattern #2 from onlinealias on Vimeo."
