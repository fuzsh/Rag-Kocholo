        "text": "Height1024 feetFloors55Year1992Architects\n\nKevin Roche\n\nAbout Bank of America Plaza\n\nThe Bank of America Plaza is a skyscraper located in the SoNo district of Atlanta, Georgia. Standing 1,023 ft (311.8 m), it ranks as the 36th tallest building in the world. When it first opened, it was the 9th tallest building in the world, and 6th tallest building in the USA. It is also the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere outside of Chicago and New York City, Georgia's tallest building, and the tallest building in any U.S. state capital. It has 55 stories of office space and was completed in 1992, when it was called the NationsBank Building. Originally intended to be the headquarters for C&S/Sovran Bank, it became NCNB/NationsBank's property following the 1991 merger of C&S/Sovran and NCNB. The Bank of America Plaza was the last American skyscraper built to be one of the ten tallest in the world (in the 14 years since its construction all new entries onto the top ten list have been in Asia). Currently, the largest tenant is the law firm of Troutman Sanders LLP.\n\nRead More at Wikipedia\n\nSee Also"
