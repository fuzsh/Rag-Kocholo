Kane Russell Coleman Logan PC has relocated its Dallas headquarters to a completely renovated multi-floor space containing approximately 45,000 square feet in Bank of America Plaza. Located at 901 Main Street, Bank of America Plaza is one of the most iconic buildings in downtown Dallas, well-known as the tallest building in Dallas and the most recognizable silhouette on the skyline. KRCL has operated for the last 26 years in Thanksgiving Tower. The new space at BOA Plaza provides the firm’s attorneys and staff with cutting-edge work areas designed to facilitate efficiency and communication while providing the Firm with the additional space it needs to accommodate its current and future growth plans. KRCL moved into the new premises on August 23, 2019.

“This move represents an exciting development for our Firm,” said Raymond Kane, Co-Founder of the Firm and Director of the Real Estate Group. “With an eye towards the future, this completely modernized space and cutting-edge amenities are critical to support our continued growth. Our move to Bank of America Plaza enables us to maintain our commitment to the Dallas CBD, and provides our attorneys, staff and clients with covered parking at above-market parking ratios, dining, wellness and other high-quality amenities available only in buildings with significantly higher rental rates. Our move to BOA Plaza not only permits us to continue to provide our services at a competitive cost advantage, but to match or exceed the amenities offered by much more expensive buildings. The other compelling attractions of Bank of America Plaza are a superior building infrastructure and related management practices, which are essential features for long term tenants like KRCL."
