The University of East Anglia’s Creative Writing MA Prose programme is the UK’s longest-running. Its alumni include well-established authors such as Ian McEwan, Kazuo Ishiguro, Rose Tremain, John Boyne and Tracy Chevalier, as well as up-and-coming names like D.W. Wilson and Naomi Alderman, who feature on the shortlists of major prizes.

This collection comprises work by the latest set to graduate from the course. These thirty-one new writers are the most international to date, coming from countries as diverse as Nigeria, Malaysia, Australia, and South Africa. Their work will immerse you in thirty-one different worlds, some more gently than others. Explore the prison pits of Ancient Greece, or swim with mermaids in Singapore. Chase a dying star at the end of the world, then witness a body being rolled into a ditch. Experience grief, love, loss and indulge in a spot of cannibalism while you're at it.

With a foreword by Anjali Joseph and an introduction by the course’s co-convenors Jean McNeil and Henry Sutton, this year's anthology shows how the UEA continues to shape the landscape of British literary fiction.
