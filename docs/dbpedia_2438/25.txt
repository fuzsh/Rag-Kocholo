Novelist Rose Tremain has been appointed chancellor of the University of East Anglia (UEA) in Norwich.

Ms Tremain, 69, is the first writer, the first woman and the first UEA graduate to take on the role.

The appointment is for a three-year term and follows the death last year of Sir Brandon Gough.

Ms Tremain, whose novels include Restoration, Music and Silence and The Road Home, will be installed as chancellor at a ceremony on 7 June.

She has had a close association with the university for almost five decades.

She studied English as an undergraduate from 1964 to 1967 as part of the UEA's second intake.
