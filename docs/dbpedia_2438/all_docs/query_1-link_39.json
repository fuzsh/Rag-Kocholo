        "text": "The University of East Anglia is an internationally renowned university providing top quality academic, social and cultural facilities to over 15,000 students from over 100 countries around the globe. We are ranked in the top 1% of universities in the world and proudly placed in the Top 20 institutions in the UK (18th Times Good University Guide 2015-16). UEA is also one of the best universities for student experience, consistently in the Top 10 for student satisfaction (Times Higher Education Student Experience Survey 2015).\n\nUEA is a brilliantly placed institution that encourages its students to discover new possibilities through world-leading teaching and research. Our students are intelligent, ambitious and curious with an overriding desire to make a positive impact on the world. We encourage our students to try out new ideas and learn by experience, rather than following a predetermined format.\n\nWe are famous for our innovative approach and the changes we seek to make in the world around us, and our students are exposed to breakthrough thinking at every turn. Our students have a direct impact on the global stage, from monitoring the world trade in wildlife, improving the lives of those in West Africa threatened by climate change, to our long list of award-winning alumni, who have found success in diverse careers at the United Nations, Nasa, BBC, Virgin and many more.\n\nOur campus is located in a lush, green area of Norwich, England’s first UNESCO City of Literature. Great discoveries happen here at UEA: from understanding what happens when Earth becomes uninhabitable in 1.75 billion years in the future, to tackling climate change through the prevention of major global health challenges. We also have great strength in the Humanities, with international literary success stories such as author and our Chancellor Rose Tremain, Costa First Novel Prize winner Emma Healey and Man Booker Prize winners among our Creative Writing alumni.\n\nWe’ve been partnered with FutureLearn from the very start, as we are committed to enhancing digital learning by providing learners across the world with high quality courses and unique access to our academic community. So, if you want to change the world with your degree, make an impact in your industry and reach your full potential - the University of East Anglia is a brilliant next step."
