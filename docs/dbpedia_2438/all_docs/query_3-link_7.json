        "text": "Norwich has long teemed with writers - including me and my husband, writes Rachel Hore\n\nMost of this autumn's novels seem to have been published on 14 September, and two of them were my new book, The Hidden Years, and my husband's, Flame Music by DJ Taylor. This seemed a fine excuse for our publishers, Simon & Schuster and Mensch, to stage a joint launch at Waterstones, Norwich. Among friends who came were publishers, staff from the National Centre for Writing and people connected to the University of East Anglia's Creative Writing MA, several journalists, and local authors of many genres.\n\nStar-studded literary assemblies of this kind are not unusual in Norwich. We are a UNESCO City of Literature, steeped in literary culture and immensely supportive of our writers.\n\nTonight (18 September) there will be an even bigger party at Dragon Hall, a restored mediaeval merchant's house and home to the National Centre for Writing, where we gather to celebrate an inventive new Norwich literary endeavour. Over the summer, a mysterious series of beautiful benches have appeared around the city, made of stone, wood and metal. All of them are designed around the shape of a book, some volumes lined up as though on a shelf, others in haphazard piles, perhaps waiting to be read. One rests on its spine, its open pages ready to sit on. The names of well-known authors associated with Norwich, or titles of their books, are engraved on them, including Philip Pullman and Sarah Perry, Andrew Cowan and WG Sebald.\n\nSpread across sites in the eight districts of Norwich, they form an upmarket tourist trail, informing the curious about the history and literary heritage of the city during a walk in the open air. This original example of public art is part of a Europe-funded \"Experience\" project, managed by Norfolk County Council as a new and more sustainable approach to local tourism. Rest on the benches and learn about literature!\n\nNorwich has been a literary city for over 900 years. From Mother Julian, whose Revelations of Divine Love was written from her anchorite's cell, and mediaeval poet Meir ben Elijah, to Sir Thomas Browne, Anna Sewell and Harriet Martineau, and contemporary authors such as Stephen Fry, Sarah Hall and Rose Tremain, to name but a few, the city has long teemed with writers.\n\nThe university ranks a host of famous names among its alumni including Kazuo Ishiguro, Ian McEwan, Louise Doughty, Christy Watson and Tracy Chevalier, and attracts visiting professors of the calibre of Margaret Atwood, Ali Smith and Ian Rankin.\n\nIt's not just writers. Norwich's earliest printer was Anthony de Solempne, a 16th-century Dutch refugee. Today the city's publishers include Galley Beggar, the UEA's Boilerplate Press, and non-fiction imprint Propolis, run by bookseller Henry Layte. Bookshops abound. Independents such as Jarrold's, the Book Hive, City Books and children's bookseller Bookbugs and Dragon Tales thrive alongside Waterstones and WH Smith.\n\nNorwich became the first English UNESCO City of Literature in 2012 - the others in the UK are now Edinburgh, Nottingham, Manchester and Exeter. Its status as a City of Refuge contributed to its bid. This has historically been a city of incomers, who've contributed to the city's wealth and prosperity, something we now recognize and celebrate. It's home to the British Centre of Literary Translation, and we welcome writers from abroad.\n\nTo me as an author it's no mystery why Norwich is a city of stories, a natural home for literature. You have only to wander through the quiet, cobbled cathedral close down to the river, or to prowl the flagstoned cloisters beneath the soaring gothic spire of the cathedral, or to lose yourself in the city's winding mediaeval lanes to feel that the past is still there, just out of reach. You only have to lift a veil and there it is.\n\nIf you loiter on the steps in front of the war memorial gardens and the pair of bronze lions that guard City Hall, with the colourful canopies of the covered market spread out before you, you'll see enough local characters and hear enough flavoursome conversation to fill a writer's notebook. A stone's throw away looms the stunning contemporary glass and metal Forum, home to the BBC and the Millennium Central Library. Norfolk is one of the few counties to maintain its libraries well. In many a Norwich pub or coffee shop or wine bar you're likely to meet writers tapping on their laptops or gossiping about their craft.\n\nIt's often remarked that every day in Norwich there's likely to be a literary event happening somewhere - a poetry mic night, a book launch or a creative writing class. Come and pick a bench and join us!"
