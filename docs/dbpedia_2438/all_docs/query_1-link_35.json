        "text": "We recently looked at Philip Pullman’s The Firework-Maker’s Daughter, and some of the ways in which volcanoes might be portrayed in literature. Mount Merapi was featured in quite a fantastical sense: it was home to Razvani the Fire-Fiend, who granted a young girl the secrets of firework-making. This time, we are taking a different approach to volcanoes in literature, looking at the ways in which volcanoes can be portrayed realistically whilst still remaining a literary device. We are turning to Journey to the Volcano: a story featuring Mount Etna in Sicily, written by the UEA’s current chancellor, Rose Tremain.\n\nGeorge’s parents are separated. His father is English, and his mother is Sicilian; she moved to England with George’s father and insists on calling her son “Giorgio”. One day, George’s mother arrives at his school and steals him away to Sicily. His grandmother, Violetta, doesn’t have long to live, and his mother wants the whole (Sicilian) side of the family to be together for when the time comes. George must adapt to his new life in Sicily where everything about the culture is strange to him, and live in the shadow of Mt. Etna, which rumbles continuously in the distance…\n\nMt. Etna is not home to any Fire-Fiends to help George in his situation, but nevertheless, the volcano still interacts with the story in a number of interesting ways. Upon arriving, it is quite clear that the Sicilian way of life is entirely unfamiliar to George. The volcano helps to illustrate that the environment is just as hostile to George as his Sicilian family seems to be.\n\n“It was still early morning, but the sun was fierce. A pebble hit George in the shoulder. It had been thrown at him by Fabio. He ignored it. Guido jumped down from his rock and laughed. […] Smoke from the fire now rose way above the rock walls of the den. It was like a tiny imitation of the smoke that came from the volcano a few miles above them.”\n\nTowards the end of the story, the Mt. Etna erupts. In spite of the eruption being described in a literary sense, as opposed to a scientific account, the novel is scientifically accurate and records the cultural impact of such an eruption perfectly.\n\n“A slight earth tremor had been felt here. Cracks had appeared in some of the buildings. People were loading their possessions into cars and onto carts and barrows. The place wasn’t safe, they said. The buildings could fall. Another earthquake could follow.”\n\nHowever, the eruption is not simply present in the story for excitement. Mount Etna forces George and his Sicilian family to band together in order to escape the lava flows. Upon witnessing the eruption on television, George’s father makes an attempt to fly to Sicily and reconcile with George’s mother. In this sense, the eruption acts as a plot device- it forces aspects of the story that were previously at odds or in conflict to come together and move forward. Much like The Firework-Maker’s Daughter, the volcano in this story enables the protagonist to come to some form of character-building realisation. However, this time the volcano is not inhabited by any mythological creatures, nor does it interact with the characters directly. It is not even a respect for the volcano that allows George and his family to reconcile, but rather the dangerous situation that they are thrown into by its activity.\n\nRose Tremain’s Journey to the Volcano was published in 1985 by Hamish Hamilton Ltd.\n\nYou may have noticed that we have a new look for our blog, twitter and Facebook. It was designed to tie in with the celebrations for the 50th anniversary of UEA. If you turn it upside down, what do you see? It looks suspiciously like a big top tent to us…\n\nIn real volcano news, there was some activity at Mount Merapi, the volcano we’ve chosen to build a replica of. It started spewing ash up to 1 km into the air, leading to some villagers around the volcano evacuating their homes. According to a local geologist and lecturer, this wasn’t an eruption, just the movement of volcanic material from the peak of the volcano – a common process where the volcano’s lava dome partially collapses, releasing ash and other materials. Nonetheless, this just highlights how active Mount Merapi is, and also how the lives of many people living in that region are affected by it.\n\nWe’ve made some more progress with our volcano build. We’ve got some GIS data for the volcano, and from this, we’re extracting the height contours every 200 m. Using this data, we’ll make templates for the workshop to cut out of wood, and we’ve these pieces we’ll build a volcano frame. Then we’ll cover the frame with other materials to make it look just like Mount Merapi.\n\nOne of the things we still have to work out is how much vertical exaggeration we want for our volcano. Landscape features look very flat when built to scale, so it is common for the height to be exaggerated by factors of around 2 to 2.5. But we don’t want too much exaggeration, then the volcano would look silly – we just need to figure out exactly how big we can (and want) to make this volcano!\n\nFollow us on twitter and Facebook for more updates!\n\nThis year the University of East Anglia celebrates 50 splendid years. As part of the celebrations we are holding a Festival weekend on the 28th and 29th of September and on the evening of the 28th we will erupt the volcano.\n\nA group of us have been lucky enough to receive funding to do this from the Alumni UEA Annual Fund.\n\nWhy have a volcano at a Birthday Party ?\n\nVolcanoes have the ability to inspire and amaze. They are the perfect interdisciplinary mix of science and (natural) art as befits a university that has founded itself on making connections. Plus, everyone likes their birthday parties to go with a bang!\n\nMaking volcanoes erupt with fireworks has previous as well; there was a short-lived fad(*) in the 18th century to recreate some of the excitement of the Italian volcanoes like Etna and Stromboli for those who couldn’t afford ‘The Grand Tour.’ (or just wanted to relive its ‘best bits’ without the benefit of youtube). One of these has recently been re-created by some German firework experts but we want to make it erupt accurately, and more violently– our volcano needs to look close to the real thing. Our other goal is to involve as many people and topics as possible (just like the university) and to be the most talked about thing at the party, even if they do invite Coldplay again.\n\nTo help us out, we are delighted to have found a proper firework maker, Edwin Samkin from EventFX Ltd. He is no ordinary firework maker but a pyrotechnician, and a pyrotechnician who specialises in all sorts of effects that might come in handy in making a volcano erupt. Like the Olympic effects? Then you might love the things that erupt from Norfolk’s Firework Volcano…\n\nOver the next few months, we’ve just got a few ground rules\n\n(1) We need to build a volcano that is exactly like a real volcano. This means we will need to choose one and make a scale model.\n\n(2) We’d like to produce a range of effects but mainly those that are reasonably true to the volcano’s behaviour.\n\n(3) We want to use the volcano to develop some interesting outreach activities that engage children across a range of subjects from science to art.\n\n(4) We have a good number of volcanologists at UEA but we want to engage researchers and undergraduates from as many different disciplines from across the university as possible: for example volcanoes appear in mythology, books and films; destroy ecosystems and change the climate. Can we draw them in?\n\nLots of challenges ahead, lots of fun to be had. Stay tuned and hang onto your seats!\n\n(*) I first heard about this from Adrian Teal when he was researching his Gin Lane Gazette."
