        "text": "Celebrating Norwich’s rich history of literature just became even more interesting as eight benches are nestled around the city for you to find… Introducing the Norwich Book Benches!\n\nAll eight of these benches are inspired by books and authors from the local area, which is also represented in their appearance. And they’re truly gorgeous. Some are open, as if marking the place you want to pick up next; some are piles of books with engravings depicting famous authors from our county; others are books waiting to be chosen from a shelf; one is resting on its spine, with open pages to sit on.\n\nTo see them all as part of a trail takes around 1 hour 15 minutes, is about 5.7km long (around 7000 steps), and is fully accessible. It’s a lovely way to spend an afternoon walk while stopping off at shops, cafés, and restaurants. Plus, it means you might just discover a new favourite!\n\nIt is not a surprise that the theme of books was chosen for the benches, as Norwich is a UNESCO City of Literature and our #CityofStories has been a literary city for over 900 years. Our city has birthed a thriving community of authors, poets, historians, novelists, and story tellers, as well as the National Centre for Writing at Dragon Hall, King Street, Norwich, where people come together to share, learn, and collaborate.\n\nThe benches made from stone have an extra special dimension as they have been engraved with book titles or authors who have either lived in or relate to Norwich, or whose literature has been set in Norfolk. The works have been chosen to include a wide range of genres, interests and reading enthusiasts.\n\nWalking around the benches can start at any point, however the trail map suggests starting at Gentleman’s Walk, a stopping place that is often frequented by visitors to Norwich Market, grabbing some street food or a coffee and watching the hustle and bustle of the city passing by. Made from wood and metal, this pair of benches sits on its spine and where you sit and unwind on the open pages.\n\nFrom here, you can work your way around the market, enjoying the sights of Guildhall, City Hall, The Forum and St Peter Mancroft – which are all beautifully picturesque.\n\nArriving at the entrance of St Stephen’s Church on Rampant Horse Street, you can find our second pair of benches made of wood and representing a shelf of books with a curved back, designed in sympathy with the curved flint wall behind.\n\nHead down the street and around our flagship Marks and Spencer store, and turn right, you will find Surrey Street on the left, a street that is home to Aviva and Marble Hall (well worth a peek when you are passing). Past the bus station and to the top of the street you will find our most contemporary bench made of metal and finished in a range of eight colours, each representing a district of Norwich.\n\nAfter walking past the blue plaque celebrating Pablo Fanque, who was born in Norwich in 1810 and the first man of colour to own a circus in Great Britain, head beyond John Lewis and down to Rose Lane, while soaking up the most perfect view of Norwich Castle and the Castle Gardens – with Norwich Cathedral in the background – turning right down Rouen Road.\n\nThis is where you find the next bench, this time made of stone and featuring a range of authors and titles whose books have been engraved into the stone, quarried from the United Kingdom, designed, and created by Ryan James.\n\nThe six books mentioned on this bench are:\n\nLumen by Tiffany Atkinson, a UEA professor and poet with some poems set in Norwich.

Since her passing in 2021, her good friend Mattho Mandersloot has continued translating much of her work to be enjoyed.\n\nFrom here, you walk past the Julian of Norwich church and past the National Centre for Writing, before crossing the river Wensum and arriving at the Riverside complex. On the water’s edge, you can find another beautiful stone bench, where you don’t have to wait long to see canoes, paddleboards and rowing boats passing by!\n\nWalk along the river towards Norwich Rail Station and drop down through The Compleat Angler pub terrace and down a few steps (For a non-step alternative route, please follow Prince of Wales Road and turn right via St Faiths Lane to The Close).\n\nAlong this stretch of river, you’ll come across Pulls Ferry, the gateway to the Cathedral Close. Follow this up towards the Cathedral and you can break your trail journey by taking some time to enjoy the largest monastic Cloisters in the country, and spend some time exploring this gorgeous historical landmark.\n\nWalking around the East End of the Cathedral, you exit The Close and turn left along Bishopsgate. This route takes you past the iconic Adam and Eve pub, which claims to be the oldest in the city, with the earliest record going back to 1249. Past the law courts you come across St Martin-at-Palace Plain and the largest of our benches.\n\nThis double fronted bench hosts a stack of stone books in the shelf at the back and features an incredible 25 titles with four covers, which are:\n\nUkawsaw Gronniosaw / James Albert: Gronniosaw was the first published black author in Britain.
