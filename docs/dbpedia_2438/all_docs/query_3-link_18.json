        "text": "UEA alumna Rose Tremain has been appointed as the University’s new Chancellor, succeeding Sir Brandon Gough, who died last year. Rose (pictured) was mong the earliest students to study at UEA, graduating with a BA in English in 1967. During her degree she was taught by both Angus Wilson and Malcolm Bradbury, and later returned to the university to teach alongside Bradbury on the Creative Writing MA between 1989 and 1995. She was awarded an honorary\n\ndoctorate in 2000 and was made a CBE in the Queen’s Birthday Honours of 2007. Her first novel ‘Sadler’s Birthday’ was published in 1976, and she has since published eleven more novels, four collections of short stories, one book for children and plays for radio and television. She won both the Whitbread Novel of the Year Award for ‘Music and Silence’ in 1999 and the Orange Prize for ‘The Road Home’ in 2007. She will be the first writer, the first woman, and the first UEA\n\ngraduate to take on the role of Chancellor."
