But some of the protagonists also share a feeling of anxiety that there is something wrong or missing in their lives which they must confront. The title story, Wildtrack, and Peerless both tackle the question of how we find meaning in a secular life, while in A shooting season the main character belives she has found a safe haven, free from interventions of any kind, but then the past makes an appearance. In Strawberry jam a young girl with a vivid imagination spies on her neighbours with disturbing results. These stories display Rose Tremain's storytelling gifts at their most beguiling.\"--Publisher's dust jacket.\n\nSubject Terms:\n\nEast Anglia (England) -- Fiction.English fiction.Short stories, English.\n\nForm/Genre:\n\nShort stories.\n\nBook jackets.\n\nLivres d'artistes.\n\nContributors:\n\nFisher, Jeff, 1952- ill.\n\nFull Circle Editions, publisher.\n\nExport:\n\nXML\n\nIntroduction\n\nPeerless\n\nStrawberry Jam\n\nA shooting season\n\nWildtrack."
