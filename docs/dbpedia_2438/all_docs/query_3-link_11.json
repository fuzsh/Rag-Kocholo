        "text": "The University of East Anglia (abbreviated as UEA) is a research-intensive public university located in the city of Norwich, England.[9] Established in 1963, today the university comprises 4 faculties and 28 schools of study.[10] Situated to the south-west of the city of Norwich the university campus is approximately Template:Convert/LoffAoffDbSoffNa in size. In 2012 the University was named the 10th best university in the world under 50 years old, and 3rd within the United Kingdom.[11] In national league tables the university has most recently been ranked 17th in the UK by The Times and Sunday Times, 17th by The Guardian and 20th by The Complete University Guide.[12][13][14] The university also ranked 1st for student satisfaction by the Times Higher Education magazine in 2013.[15] The university celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2013.[16]\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe university opened in October 1963, not on its present campus, but in the \"University Village\" on the other side of Earlham Road, a collection of prefabricated structures designed for 1200 students, laid out by the local architectural firm Feilden and Mawson. There were no residences. The Vice-Chancellor and administration were based in nearby Earlham Hall.[17]\n\nIn 1961, the first vice-chancellor, Frank Thistlethwaite, had approached Denys Lasdun, an adherent of the \"New Brutalist\" trend in architecture, who was at that time building Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, to produce designs for the permanent campus.[17] The site chosen was on the western edge of the city, on the south side of Earlham Road. The land, formerly part of the Earlham Hall estate was at that time occupied by a golf course.[18] Lasdun unveiled a model and an outline plan at a press conference in April 1963, but it took another year to produce detailed plans, which diverged considerably from the model. The first buildings did not open until late 1966.\n\nLasdun put all the teaching and research functions into the \"teaching wall\", a single block 460 metres long following the contour of the site. Alongside this he built a walkway, giving access to the various entrances of the wall, with access roads beneath. Attached to the other, southern, side of the walkway he added the groups of terraced residences that became known as \"Ziggurats\". In 1968, Lasdun was replaced as architect by Bernard Feilden, who completed the teaching wall and library, and created an arena-shaped square as a social space of a kind not envisioned in his predecessor's plans.[17] Many of the original buildings now have Grade II* listed status, reflecting the importance of the architecture and the history of the campus.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, extraction of gravel in the valley of the River Yare, which runs to the south of the campus, resulted in the university acquiring its own lake or \"Broad\" as it is often referred to. At more or less the same time, the gift of a collection of tribal art and 20th-century painting and sculpture, by artists such as Francis Bacon and Henry Moore, from Sir Robert and Lady Lisa Sainsbury resulted in the construction of the striking Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts at the western end of the main teaching wall, one of the first major works of architect Lord Foster.\n\nIn 2005 the university, in partnership with the University of Essex, and with the support of Suffolk County Council, the East of England Development Agency, Ipswich Borough Council, Suffolk College, and the Learning and Skills Council, secured £15 million funding from the Higher Education Funding Council for England for the creation of a new campus in the Waterfront area of Ipswich, called University Campus Suffolk or UCS.[19] The campus opened in September 2007.[19]\n\nIn November 2009, computer servers at the Climatic Research Unit (a research institute within the University) were hacked, and the stolen information made public. Over 1,000 emails, 2,000 documents, and source code were released. Because the Climate Research Unit is a major repository for data regarding man-made global warming their release directly prior to the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference attracted international attention and led to calls for an inquiry.[20] As a result, no fewer than eight investigations were launched in the both the UK and US, but none found evidence of fraud or scientific misconduct.[21]\n\nCampus[]\n\nFeatures of the UEA campus include Earlham Hall, childhood home of Elizabeth Fry which is now home to Norwich Law School; the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts at the western end of the main teaching wall designed by Lord Foster to house the art collection of Sir Robert and Lady Lisa Sainsbury; and \"Sportspark\", a multi-sports facilities built in 2001 thanks to a £14.5 million grant from Sport England Lottery Fund.[22]\n\nOther features include the large university lake or \"broad\" at the southern edge of campus and \"The Square\", a central outdoor meeting place flanked by concrete steps.\n\nAccommodation the university campus includes eight en-suite residences; Constable Terrace, Nelson Court, and Britten, Pasto, Colman, Victory, Kett and Browne Houses. The residences are named after Horatio Nelson, John Constable, Benjamin Britten, Jeremiah Colman, Horatio Nelson's ship Template:HMS, Robert Kett, Sir Thomas Browne and the Paston family who wrote the Paston Letters. The university offers en-suite accommodation at the University Village, located next to the university campus. There are four non en-suite residences on campus; Norfolk and Suffolk Terraces, and Orwell and Wolfson Close. The university manages Mary Chapman Court, a hall of residence in Norwich city centre.[23]\n\nFacilities on campus include the \"Union Pub and Bar\", a concert and disco venue called \"The LCR\", a canteen called \"The Campus Kitchen\", a cafe/coffee shop called \"The Blend\", a bar/coffee shop called \"The Hive\", a graduate bar called the \"Graduate Students Club\" and \"The Street\" with a 24-hour launderette, the Union Shop, a coffee shop called \"Cafe Direct\", a branch of Barclays, and a Waterstones book shop. Most of these are situated in the centre of the campus, next to The Square.\n\nThe campus is linked to the city centre and railway station by frequent buses, operated by First, via Unthank Road or Earlham Road. First also operate frequent buses from the campus to the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital and to Bowthorpe.\n\nAcademic profile[]\n\nAdmissions[]\n\nIn 2013 the ratio of applications to acceptances was 6.7 to 1. 71.6% of graduating students achieved First-class honours or Upper second-class honours.[24] In 2011 the proportion of students admitted to the University from independent schools was 14%.[25]\n\nFaculties and schools[]\n\nThe University offers over 300 courses it its four Faculties, which contain 23 Schools of Study.:[5]\n\nFaculty of Arts and Humanities\n\nAmerican Studies\n\nArt History and World Art Studies\n\nFilm, Television and Media\n\nHistory\n\nLanguage and Communication Studies\n\nLiterature, Drama and Creative Writing\n\nMusic\n\nPhilosophy\n\nPolitical, Social and International Studies\n\nFaculty of Medicine and Health Sciences\n\nNorwich Medical School\n\nNursing Sciences\n\nRehabilitation Sciences\n\nFaculty of Science\n\nActuarial Sciences\n\nBiological Sciences\n\nChemistry\n\nComputing Sciences\n\nEngineering\n\nEnvironmental Sciences\n\nMathematics\n\nNatural Sciences\n\nPharmacy\n\nFaculty of Social Sciences\n\nEconomics\n\nEducation and Lifelong Learning\n\nInternational Development\n\nNorwich Law School\n\nNorwich Business School\n\nPsychology\n\nSocial Work\n\nRankings and reputation[]\n\nTemplate:Infobox UK university rankings The results of the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE), published on 8 December 2008, showed that over 50% of the University's research activity was deemed to be \"world leading\" or \"internationally excellent\", with 87% in total being of \"international standing\".[26] The university's research in the domains of American and Anglophone Area Studies, Communication, Cultural and Media Studies, and in Development Studies placed its respective Schools within the top three nationally.[27][28][29] The university also has the highest percentage of national world leading research in History of Art, Design and Architecture;[30] in Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences and in Pharmacy, the university places in the top ten nationally.[31][32]\n\nThe postgraduate Master of Arts in Creative Writing, founded by Sir Malcolm Bradbury and Sir Angus Wilson in 1970, is regarded as the most respected in the United Kingdom, and admission to the programme is competitive.[33] The course has gone on to produce a number of distinguished authors, including Ian McEwan, Kazuo Ishiguro, Anne Enright, Tash Aw, Andrew Miller, Owen Sheers, Tracy Chevalier, Trezza Azzopardi, Panos Karnezis, and Suzannah Dunn. The German émigré novelist W. G. Sebald also taught in the School of Literature and Creative Writing, and founded the British Centre for Literary Translation, until his death in a car accident in 2001.[34] Experimental novelist Alan Burns was the University's first writer-in-residence.[35]\n\nThe Climatic Research Unit, founded in 1972 by Hubert Lamb in the School of Environmental Sciences[36] has been an early centre of work for climate change research. Publications include the recent study on anthropogenic polar warming. The School was also stated to be \"the strongest in the world\" by the Chief Scientific Adviser to the UK Government, Sir David King during a lecture at the John Innes Centre in 2005.[37]\n\nUEA Literary Festival[]\n\nThe University hosted its inaugural literary in 1991 and has welcomed a host of notable speakers including Madeleine Albright, Martin Amis, Martin Bell, Alan Bennett, Cherie Blair, Melvyn Bragg, Eleanor Catton, Richard Dawkins, Alain de Botton, Sebastian Faulks, Niall Ferguson, Stephen Fry, Frank Gardner, Richard E.
