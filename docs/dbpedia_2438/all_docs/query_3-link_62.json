However, we believe we have a long-list which is diverse and of an enormously high quality, reaching across a variety of genres and countries.\n\n“It is a list which encompasses some great novels – comedies and literary thrillers, as well as more elegiac, lyrical fiction, by Bosnian-American, British, Israeli, Palestinian and German authors.\n\n“There is also a rich selection of innovative non-fiction - World War Two histories told from a German viewpoint, or told from the perspective of the Jewish victims of the Holocaust; powerful accounts of post-war Polish attitudes to Jews; as well as definitive biographies and compelling historical memoirs.\n\n\"Many of the themes and histories covered are live issues which will connect directly with the concerns of the present-day reader.”\n\nThe 2017 prize winner will be announced on February 23 at JW3 during an event at to mark 40 years of the JQ Wingate Prize.
