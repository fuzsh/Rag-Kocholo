        "text": "The University of East Anglia’s Creative Writing MA Prose programme is the UK’s longest-running. Its alumni include well-established authors such as Ian McEwan, Kazuo Ishiguro, Rose Tremain, John Boyne and Tracy Chevalier, as well as up-and-coming names like D.W. Wilson and Naomi Alderman, who feature on the shortlists of major prizes.\n\nThis collection comprises work by the latest set to graduate from the course. These thirty-one new writers are the most international to date, coming from countries as diverse as Nigeria, Malaysia, Australia, and South Africa. Their work will immerse you in thirty-one different worlds, some more gently than others. Explore the prison pits of Ancient Greece, or swim with mermaids in Singapore. Chase a dying star at the end of the world, then witness a body being rolled into a ditch. Experience grief, love, loss and indulge in a spot of cannibalism while you're at it.\n\nWith a foreword by Anjali Joseph and an introduction by the course’s co-convenors Jean McNeil and Henry Sutton, this year's anthology shows how the UEA continues to shape the landscape of British literary fiction."
