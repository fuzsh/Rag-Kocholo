        "text": "I am a travel writer and after graduation I travelled and wrote because I couldn’t think of anything else in the world I’d rather do. The travelling probably came first, because as soon as I finished university I went off backpacking around the world for a couple of years and a lot of that time I spent in Central and South America. And as a result of that when I got back I just thought I’d loved it so much, I’d had such an amazing time there, I thought I’d try to extend that good time by selling my services, so to speak, to various travel publications to see if they would be interested in my experiences, thoughts or anecdotes from my travels. That turned out to be the case, they were interested, and as a result I became a travel writer and that has been my career, pretty much since, with the exception of the last five or six years when I’ve spent more time writing novels. So I now brand myself as a novelist first and a travel writer second, but I still do both, although the fiction writing is what I care about most of all. The travel writing was a way of buying myself the necessary time to write books. That is what I’ve always cared about since I was a kid. I studied Creative Writing at UEA, and so really I was one of the lucky ones, because since I was five or six years old I’ve always known what I most wanted to do, what I most cared about, was writing novels.\n\nI spent a lot of time travelling in Central and South America, and I’m actually off to Peru and Ecuador tomorrow to write about that for a travel publication called Lonely Planet, writing the updates to both guidebooks. But I do a lot of writing for various publications, mainly on Latin American, because the great thing and the terrible thing about travel writing is that once you have travelled somewhere you tend to be pigeon-holed as a specialist in that region, and given work only in that region. Travel writing doesn’t necessarily give you the golden ticket to go off travelling to exactly wherever you want, but it comes fairly close! I’ve been lucky enough to combine places where I’ve been sent for work with places where I’ve just wanted to go. If you juggle your schedule correctly, you can always find time to do everything you’ve ever wanted to do and be paid for a fair chunk of it in this line of work, so that’s quite cool.\n\nI do speak Spanish and that is the only language I need to use really for my work. So they obviously speak Spanish all the way from the south of the States all the way down to the tip of Argentina, so any country within that region is likely to be one of the countries that I’m going to be sent to. It’s mainly the Andean countries like Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru, they’re my main specialities travel writing wise. It was travel writing which inspired the premise for my first novel as well. That was called “Roebuck” and it is based on the true story of the adventures of this Englishman who gets marooned on the coast of South America in the sixteenth century and ends up actually living with a cannibalistic tribe for the next ten years. And he survives, of course because he’s narrating, he survives being eaten by the tribe and he becomes almost a friend to them, and a leader to them, and he incites them to rebel against the Portuguese who at the time in Brazil are oppressing the indigenous tribes. So he winds up leading them in a rather exciting, but ultimately flawed and failed and tragic rebellion against the Portuguese. That is an example of how sometimes travel writing can lead on elsewhere.\n\nThis book which I’ve just written, Song Castle is a novel set in the twelfth century. It’s based around the very first Eisteddfod which is a very important cultural festival in Wales. It’s actually the oldest competitive festival of song and poetry in Europe. My book essentially documents the very first such festival in the twelfth century. It’s like a twelfth century Eurovision in some ways, that is how me and my publisher have been marketing it (!), but basically it’s about the journey of a group of bards travelling from across the known world to participate in this festival of song in the west of Wales in 1176, and it’s about the adventures they get up to on the way. It’s a very lovely, very exciting rollicking adventure and it’s available through my publishers, Urbane Publications.\n\nThe process of putting a novel together for me works in two ways. When I am away travelling I always carry a notebook – I’m writing little bits and pieces in that. For me, although it doesn’t sound quite like the dream of the writer being able to write anywhere, I like my own space. I like a nice, old desk with all my notes and my nice view of the Welsh hills. I like one place in which to work and whilst I like travelling and go all around the world doing that, I find most of my inspiration comes when I’m collating my thoughts back at the end of the trip and having some time to process them. When you’re travelling one of the things that you definitely find is that it’s all happening so quickly, so much is going on, that you don’t necessarily have the time to totally process it. It’s only afterwards really that you do. So I like being in one place to do my writing and that is where, or that is when, most of my inspiration comes I would say. So it’s the combination of having those beautiful, amazing experiences somewhere and then having one place afterwards where you can process what’s happened. At the time I studied my degree in English Literature major with Creative Writing minor, and at the time that I did it, in 1999 to 2002, UEA was, far and away, the best and only place doing this course. So I felt immensely lucky to be on it for a start. I think we all were, all ten of us on that creative writing course, we’re still all really good friends as we’ve stayed in touch and we kind of bonded: we were all enthused about doing the course and we became very good friends with our teachers at the time, too. We had some absolutely great teachers on that course, people like Paul Magrs on the creative writing minor and then on the literature side people like Vic Sage, just really great people who taught us perhaps that writing wasn’t just a pipedream. To be surrounded by other people that had being a writer as one of their dreams or aspirations or ambitions, it’s a really beautiful thing. For example I wrote stories as a kid and everyone always thought that “oh Luke, he’s off writing one of his stories again., it’s all very nice but it’s not reality, sooner or later he’s going to have to pull up his socks and do something sensible…”, so it was really amazing to be amongst other writers that genuinely shared an ambition to write, not just as a pastime but professionally. That very fact definitely was encouraging in itself. And of course a degree also teaches you the science of writing, it teaches you how to formulate ideas. I mean if you’re writing an essay every other week you start to pick up sooner or later pretty much how to formulate and set down in words any idea and that’s taught me a lot, whether I’m writing an article on the best mountains to climb in Peru or whether I’m writing historic fiction, that same premise applies and I think that was something which UEA helped to develop.\n\nTo succeed as a writer you need determination. To keep trying is the key and if you want to be a writer I think the main thing that you need to hone as a skill, more than writing, is your ability to withstand rejection. Rejection can be very hurtful because obviously a lot of the time you’re writing from the heart, you’re baring your soul so to speak and when an editor or an agent is then saying “sorry that’s not what we like, that’s not good enough, that doesn’t work for me”’, that can be really upsetting. So you have to develop this really thick skin and also you have to really believe in what you’ve written and keep plugging away. It’s a bit of a cliché but it’s true, I mean I spent years in my twenties, hopelessly broke and not necessarily getting success straight away and then when I was about twenty-six I got my first book published, a travel book, and that gave me a lot of encouragement because up until then you maybe think you have some talent, or you maybe think you can write well but it’s a relief to get that recognition. Recognition is important for me and I think most writers would agree that however wonderful it may be to put words down on paper or on a computer screen, it’s nothing if they’re not recognised. The recognition is kind of key. It’s like all art really, there has to be a degree of recognition or otherwise it’s like a tree falling in the forest if no-one sees or hears the tree fall. So it’s nice to have some recognition definitely.\n\nI’m always willing to attract new fans to my writing. I think it’s funny how your expectations change, nothing is ever satisfying enough as the writer. As soon as you’ve got one novel published then you want your next one to be the Booker prize winner and probably if I ever won the Booker prize, which is obviously some way off anyway, I’d probably have another ambition. You’re always wanting to get up to the next level as soon as you’ve achieved something but it’s important also to sit back sometimes and I force myself to do this and say ‘well you’ve done some of the things in your life that you really wanted to do.’ One of those things is speaking about fiction to an audience, and whether that is a group of students or, as I was doing the other day, talking to a bunch of fairly old people who were real history enthusiasts in the town where my new novel that’s just been published, “Song Castle”, is set, that was really wonderful as well. Each time there’s different aspects of what you’re talking about that an audience will latch on to. So in the talk I just mentioned the other day this group of people were very interested in the historical accuracy of my book so I got a grilling about that in the question session afterwards, but sometimes when it’s a younger audience they’re just as interested in how you got to where you got to, so to speak, in your career. So there’s always different things that different audiences will pick up on and be interested in. So it’s good to then go into any particular talk or discussion that you might be doing with an open mind, rather than a fixed agenda, because you never know what actually your audience is going to be enthusiastic about. You may get a random question from a member of the audience which you really didn’t expect, for example I got some really crazy ones recently and sometimes you don’t always know the answers. The most rewarding aspect of my work is engaging with the audience through whatever means, whether that is by doing a talk or through writing the article that you know a particular audience wants to read or whether it’s reaching out to lovers of historic fiction that are enthused about something that I’ve been writing about on that front. But also I think variety, like today I’m having a chat about UEA which is really nice because it takes me back, it was a formative part of my life. I love Norwich: it was a great place to hang out. And then tomorrow I’m going to South America. I’ve just got back from the US and so there’s a lot of variety, no two days are the same and that’s nice as well. Mainly I guess, since I was about four or five years old and I’d start to be writing these little stories, I’ve managed to make telling stories of whatever kind my life really. And that’s all I do, I don’t do anything else. I just write stories.\n\nI still do a lot of travel writing because it tends to pay the bills more than fiction writing. Until you get to that J.K. Rowling stage you’re not necessarily able to make a career solely from fiction writing, and that’s an important piece of advice to any audience of want-to-be-writers: to always have something else going on, because you could be waiting a great number of years for that big break with fiction writing and even then, when you’re published and you’ve got a couple of books behind you, it gives you some money from royalties but it’s not necessarily what most people would call enough as a sizeable salary. It’s good to have some else going on, a few other things ticking over and that’s basically what I’ve tried to create with my career, opening up a window to always the time to write what I truly care about, which I don’t think a normal 9.00 to 5.00 job would give me. I don’t think I could do a 9.00 to 5.00 job anyway: I wouldn’t be able to work within those restrictive parameters. When I was at UEA, Norwich was such a great place to hang out. I grew up in a small village in Somerset so for me coming to Norwich was like coming to the big city. It was my first experience of a fairly big city which sounds funny because it’s small and provincial and quirky in many ways but it for me at the time, one of the most cosmopolitan, fun, amazing, huge, diverse places I could imagine being. I think one’s impressions of the city do change after one’s left it, but when I was in Norwich there were pubs, so many great pubs, like the Rose Tavern and the Alley Tavern, which were the two pubs I lived quite close to, they were such great places, you’d always meet these fantastic characters. And there was a really good arts scene which was quite interesting for a city of Norwich’s size, not just on the campus but also in the city itself. I love the setting of Norwich, I like hiking so we’d often go on really lovely hikes, out to the Broads and to the coast, like around Sheringham, and Holkham particularly is such a beautiful place. It was just everything really. And the campus too, I just love the Brutalist concrete walkways and the lake, and the LCR, just everything about it. Another good thing about the university of course was I was very lucky to get the chance to see quite famous writers like Rose Tremain, Kazuo Ishiguro, very famous novelists like that would regularly come in to talk to us and that was incredible.\n\nI would definitely recommend studying at UEA. My best friends now are people that I was on the Creative Writing course with and there is that connection of a shared passion. There are all these people coming from all over the country to study, for example Creative Writing, and that does something to you, it bonds you together and I think a place like UEA is brilliant for that. It was particularly amazing for me to put me in touch with other people who loved writing, it wasn’t just for those three years. People like Yannick Hill who is now also at a similar point to me, getting novels out there, getting them recognised. There were people on the MA, like Tash Aw, they’re now doing very well for themselves. It was so exciting to be amongst all these people who were trying to make it in a profession which most people would brand you crazy for even attempting to make it in and to be around all these people who had this idea of just writing books, there’s something beautiful about that and that is something I’d never forget. What I also like about UEA was that it was very much a proper campus university, it wasn’t one of these scattered universities. Everything was very much in one place and there was a sense of community about that. I was living in Wolfson Close at the time and you could just walk a couple of minutes one way and you could be there with all your friends, and a couple of minutes more and you’re already in the centre of the campus where there was a lot of stuff going on. It became like your own little world and that was a great thing. I would certainly never want to take that experience back. It was great, it was a fundamental part of my life, and how I got to be who I am."
