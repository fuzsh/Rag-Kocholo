        "text": "I don't make lists of books I've read but I'm sure I've read this one.\n\nHe travels to the Uk on a coach and is befriended by a woman who keeps in contact. He has a child back in his hometown, his mother also features in it. He works as a pot washer.\n\nAm I right ? If so yes a strange read. Read as a book group read.\n\nYes! I read it, also as a bookclub read, about 10 years ago.\n\nI thought exactly the same about the rape and thought wtf have I just read, esp when the author still expects you to have sympathy with Lev.\n\nWhen it came to discussing the book, I was the only one who seemed concerned about that scene; everyone else just brushed it aside . I'd like to think these days I'd be slightly more persuasive as to why I thought it was \"wrong\".\n\nThe main character even refers to it as \"almost rape\" when he talks to his friend about it later on!\n\nMakes it even weirder that no-one else in the group seemed to have a problem with it.\n\nI wonder with the #me too generation it might be read differently these days? Not that I'm excusing what is clearly a horrific scene of course.\n\nYes I think so. It's written really graphically as well, in kind of a tittilating way. And straight after I think were meant to feel sorry for him?! Makes me not want to read anything else by the author that's for sure.\n\nOh and the paedophile play is this weird chapter where he goes to see a play and it's about a man who orders a blowup sex doll of his young daughter and ends the play having sex with it!\n\nI read this a few years ago and loved it. I do think when a character novel like it is boiled down to aspects of the plot, it's just too reductive. A novel is saying exactly those words in that order. You can't generalise. The 'almost rape' scene is awful but I think it's really interesting to find yourself as a reader still - though in a more complex way - rooting for the character after it. It's brave to go there as a writer. I don't think he raped her but maybe if I read it now I'd have a different opinion. It forces you to consider the subject of rape in a way nothing else could.\n\nIt's not that rags to riches either - he works hard, he's talented and careful, his success is hard earned and hardly fantastical - seemed plausible to me.\n\nFor me anyway, good novels capture complexity of life, what being alive can mean. Not full of absolutes and characters that never do anything wrong...\n\nSorry am knackered and probably making no sense... rambling. But The Road Home is a fucking amazing novel.\n\nThe 'almost rape' scene is awful but I think it's really interesting to find yourself as a reader still - though in a more complex way - rooting for the character after it.

I'm struggling to know how anyone could sympathise with him at this point."
