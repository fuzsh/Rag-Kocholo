        "text": "Life begins at 40, according to the title of Walter Pitkin's 1930s self-help tome, but Schopenhauer's more stately observation that \"the first 40 years of life give us the text; the next 30 supply the commentary\" captures the somewhat more sober, reflective tone of Body of Work, a new anthology marking the 40th anniversary of the University of East Anglia's creative writing programme, the first and most renowned in the country. Edited by Giles Foden, the new book is a companion of sorts to Class Work, published in 1996 to coincide with the programme's 25th anniversary, but whereas the previous volume was essentially a collection of early stories by the programme's alumni, Body of Work gathers essays and poems reflecting on the programme's history and the experiences of its students.\n\nIllustrious figures are well represented, from the dearly departed founders and guiding eminences (Malcolm Bradbury, Angus Wilson, Angela Carter, Lorna Sage and WG Sebald) to the distinguished alumni (Ian McEwan, Kazuo Ishiguro, Rose Tremain and Anne Enright, to name just a few). But while many of the names are familiar, there's a refreshing intimacy and frankness in their depictions. Luke Williams's recollection of Sebald, say, wearing two watches, one on each wrist, is a detail as beguilingly mysterious as one could wish of that enigmatic author. There's widespread affection for Bradbury – known because of his pallor as \"Talcy Malcy\" – even if he appears, by contemporary standards, a less than model teacher. McEwan, the programme's first student, describes only \"minimal guidance\" comprising brief and occasional meetings, some at the local pub, yet was clearly stirred by Bradbury's \"intensely radiated assumption that there was nothing quite so exciting or essential as the writing of fiction\". Carter is also vividly recalled here, by among others Anne Enright, who writes of her with a stark admiration all the more candid for her mordant acknowledgement that \"the posture of the writer talking about great and previous writers is both grovelling and self-aggrandising\".\n\nIt's neither in Enright's case, thankfully, or in the book as a whole, even if there's the occasional back-slapping echo of the festschrift in these 50 or more pieces. That very multitude, though, speaks to one of the abiding themes of the book: the value of a writing community. Time and again the writers in these pages salute the support of their teachers and fellow writers. As Clive Sinclair remarks of Bradbury, his \"great gift was to enable you to believe in yourself\".\n\nThere are other recurring notes. The book is speckled with acute writerly insights across a range of disciplines, forms and genres: Antoinette Moses on idiolect, Andrew Cowan, the programme's current director, on translation, and Toby Litt making a typically insightful and spiky case for sensibility. There are also a number of wry reflections on the life of the writer, the tone of which are typified by Nam Le's entry: \"My failed novel\". These pieces, by turns realistic, resigned, and philosophical, bring to mind perhaps the single best writerly observation I know, Flaubert's notion that \"talent is long patience\".\n\nThe repeated acknowledgement of difficulty, and the recurring recollections of the past, and those passed, give the volume as a whole a somewhat mournful aspect. Whereas Class Work seemed to look forward (the early work of the programme's alumni implicitly invited readers to fill in their future careers), Body of Work occasionally feels bogged down in the past. That sense of \"stuckness\" is perhaps most apparent in the persistence of that old chestnut, whether creative writing can be taught. Foden, on the first page of his elegant, wide-ranging introduction, characterises the naysayers: \"Having failed by middle age to produce any substantial literary work themselves, they are like those people who, arriving late and breathless at a bus stop, shake their fists at the departing bus.\" A dig at the middle-aged is perhaps a tad risky in a book celebrating a 40th anniversary, but what's striking is that despite Foden's droll dismissal, a defensive note is struck repeatedly, sometimes in passing, sometimes at length (Bernardine Evaristo makes a particularly plangent case). As Adam Mars-Jones notes mischievously (in an essay refreshingly titled \"Why Shouldn't We?\"), \"Only sex education seems to cause more unease in British hearts and minds than the teaching of creative writing.\"\n\nThe reiteration of these arguments – in the midst of a book celebrating a remarkably successful programme and rife with examples of valuable craft and life lessons – is somewhat disconcerting, especially when one considers that Bradbury himself, reflecting on the founding of the programme, noted \"the degree of suspicion in which creative writing had come to be held in Britain. It was generally regarded as a dangerous American invention, like the vacuum cleaner and the hula hoop – and certainly not one that had a place in the literature department of a British university\". It may be, of course, that 40 years is not a long time in the life of an academic discipline or institution – that rather than entering middle age, the teaching of creative writing is still in its formative years. The US experience, which is a little longer – the University of Iowa's creative writing programme, the first and most prestigious in the US, dates back to 1936 – perhaps offers hope about any lingering academic resistance to the teaching of creative writing. The widespread expansion of writing programmes there has resulted in a generation of younger academics, trained in institutions where creative writing was a normal part of the curriculum, for whom the old antagonisms no longer pertain.\n\nWe might look forward in Britain, then, to a time when the arguments marshalled here might qualify as mere preaching to the choir – if it weren't for the suspicion that the choir, itself, might be part of the problem. Academic objections may recede, but what's implied in these pages is that writers themselves are prone to an enduring scepticism about the teaching of their own subject (consider, say, Will Self's pungent insistence that \"there aren't any rules [of writing], or if there are, they're for deadheads who want to be taught naturalism by some berk in the Fens\".)\n\nThe tendency for writers to question what they're teaching may be construed as humility (Foden pre-emptively notes that he's not an academic and most writers suffer a mild case of imposter syndrome in the halls of academe), but equally it may denote an outsiderly arrogance (writers identify themselves first as practitioners, only secondarily as teachers). Such a stance also hints that writer/teachers remain in thrall to the romantic idea of creation. The logic runs something like this: writers are special, therefore I must be special to be a writer. That status entitles me to teach, but I can't teach someone else that very specialness, because if I were to impart it, even if it could be imparted, I would, by definition, be less special myself. Oddly, and even while increasing numbers of writers and teachers of writing come up through writing programmes, we – and I include myself here – may be the ones most lastingly dubious about our own discipline, taking refuge behind Toby Litt's credo \"that creative writing couldn't be taught, but that it could be learned\".\n\nWriting students, it's often noted, are prone to Bloom's anxiety of influence. Reading between the lines of this anthology, one suspects their teachers are suffering from an equally insidious anxiety of transmission.\n\nPeter Ho Davies is a fiction writer and former director of the creative writing programme at the University of Michigan"
