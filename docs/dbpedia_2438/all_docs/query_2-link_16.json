        "text": "Reading Rose Tremain’s stories is like sipping a Campari and soda in the bar of an elegant hotel that manages to be up to the minute without being a slave to fashion: the Carlyle, the Algonquin, the Plaza before it was turned into condos.\n\nThere is a bracing acerbity to her voice, and a refusal to reduce the important human experiences to simple categories. Everything is less or more than it seems — itself, its opposite and something in between. Marriage can be a hideous entrapment or a paradisal enclosed garden or an updated form of prostitution. Sex doesn’t bring happiness, unless it does. Mothers can’t bear to be parted from their children or would do almost anything to get away from them. Even the housekeeper in Daphne du Maurier’s “Rebecca” is not a monster but a victim.\n\nTremain is unafraid of large subjects and larger-than-life characters. Folded into this collection are two tales centering on famous authors. “The Jester of Astapovo” revisits Tolstoy’s famous flight from his wife, but from the point of view of the stationmaster who must accommodate the dying genius. Far be it from me to spoil the surprise of “The Housekeeper,” but let’s just say that the servant du Maurier turns into Mrs. Danvers is a hapless Polish refugee who could never be played by Judith Anderson. Du Maurier is the writer as monster, both thief and betrayer, coolly stealing a life in the service of literature . . . or at least a book.\n\nThe notion of writing as toxic activity is treated with a sly bitterness in the title story, “The American Lover.” In the first few paragraphs, Tremain deftly introduces Beth and her dire situation. “Sometimes, she hears voices on the landing — people arriving or departing — and then the long sigh of the elevator descending. She wishes there were no people, no elevator, no pain. She stares at the old-fashioned room. She stares at her crutches, propped up against a wing chair. In a few months’ time, she is going to be 30.” Note the progression of the three causes of Beth’s present distress: “people, elevator, pain.” What is the relationship of the elevator to “people” and “pain”? Is the order of distress ascending or descending? Or both? Or doesn’t it matter? And what does it all have to do with the crutches?\n\nBeth was ruined by sex — sexual passion, sexual obsession — with a man she knows to be rather ordinary, even as she drowns in the wave of his power over her. This story gives a resounding smack in the face to the idea that writing is therapeutic. Beth has been destroyed twice, once by the actual love affair and once by writing a novel about it, which, rather than freeing her, forces her to relive the experience, only this time more intensely.\n\nTwo of the tenderest stories in the collection take place beside bodies of water, as if that element were capable of cleansing the dark accretions of ordinary life on land. “Man in the Water” was, Tremain notes, “inspired by the picture ‘Yarmouth Beach and Jetty’ by Norwich School artist Joseph Stannard (1797-1830).” Tremain has written a number of novels set in the 17th century. Their lightness of touch steers them far from the dangerous shoals of the periwig-and-whalebone-corset school of historical fiction. This lightness suffuses the eerie “Man in the Water,” part domestic tragicomedy, part magic realism. A widowed father, a fisherman, is entirely dependent on his daughter, Jenny, to “keep house,” by which he means keep him and his son from savagery and squalor. The plot has two strands: Jenny’s vision of a drowning man, whom no one else sees, and her father’s anxiety that she will be lured away by a lighthouse keeper with dreams of earning a fortune in the West Indies. Trying to prepare for the worst, the father asks his daughter to teach him how to cook and clean, with comical results. At the end, Jenny assures her father that she will stay with him, but insists on the value and truthfulness of her vision of the drowning man. “ ‘I saw a man in the water, Pa!’ she cries. ‘And you can ask me and ask me till the end of time: I saw a man in the water.’ ”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
