        "text": "Creative Writing programmes in universities now offer both an education for and employment to literary writers. This papers asks how literary writers apprehend their relatively recently institutionalised position, as university staff and students. The concept of 'patronage', it is argued, offers a useful way into reflecting upon such academic institutionalisation. The argument is presented in three parts. The first outlines some of the conceptual nuances of patronage. The second examines the oft made claim that universities extend patronage to literary writers by enabling employment as Creative Writing staff. The third part engages with a question: what precisely does a student expect to gain from a Creative Writing programme and what does the degree validate? It is suggested that Creative Writing programmes are designed principally to offer supportive patronage, with a promise-but without guarantees-of entry into a financial patronage system. A brief conclusion considers the bearing of these arguments on Creative Writing as a school subject.\n\nOver the last decade several Australian broadsheet newspapers have run numerous articles on the state of literary publishing, providing a rare opportunity for academic debate to enter the public arena. According to the reported commentary of novelists, publishers and academics, it would seem the literary field is caught between two contradictory currents: although the economic viability of Australian literary titles appears under pressure, there is booming demand for university courses in creative writing. This casual linkage has enabled a range of speculations on the possibly 'perverse' market relations between writing programs and the publishing industry. Has consumer demand for Australian literary authors shifted from the bookshop to the arts faculty? A recent quip by Frank Moorhouse would suggest so: 'Now the joke goes that when someone says they're a writer, the next question is, \" where do you teach? \" ' (10). While concerns about the impact of globalisation on Australian literary publishing are often reported with a significant amount of hyperbole, they have also received some evidence-based support. In his analysis of the publishing trends of large publishing houses, Mark Davis has suggested that a 'literary paradigm of Australian publishing' has been in decline since around 2000; and this account has received qualified support from David Carter's analysis of a more comprehensive dataset of literary fiction titles published between 1990 and 2006 (although for a longer historical perspective, see Bode). While it may be simply too early to know how significant these developments are, the perception of a decline has nevertheless rendered the current popularity of creative writing courses conspicuous, with commentators engaged in some heady accusations and imaginative defences. Some authors have accused creative writing courses of flooding the desks of publishers with bad manuscripts, while journalists and some academics have claimed that writing programs are little more than an 'academic racket' in student fees and a clandestine form of state subsidy for literary writers (e.g. Neill; Pryor; King). It has also been claimed, from both celebratory and despondent perspectives, that creative writing is gradually displacing literary studies as students are now more interested in the production rather than history or interpretation of writing (Muecke). For some creative writing lecturers it has been a short step from here to the promotion of new economy rhetoric on the rise of a 'creative class' and the benefits of creativity for an innovation economy (Dale). At stake in these debates are two sets of concerns. The first is signaled by the figure of 'student demand'. In the post-Dawkins era, discussions about student demand operate less as neutral indicators of the shifting\n\nThe University of Iowa’s graduate Writers’ Workshop is ‘often considered the best MFA program in the country’ (Heimbach, 2021). However, despite Iowa providing the ‘founding model’ (Wandor, 2012, p. 51) for creative writing study, Menand (2009) discusses the premise’s scepticism, ‘that creative writing is something that can be taught’, and quotes the school themselves: ‘the fact that the Workshop can claim as alumni nationally and internationally prominent poets, novelists, and short story writers is, we believe, more the result of what they brought here than of what they gained from us’ (The University of Iowa, 2022). It is also interesting to consider how, as Laurillard (2012) discusses, for many years the university teaching pedagogy had been that of ‘imparting knowledge’, which ‘has usually been only a partially successful teaching activity’ (p. 11). If research is the ‘careful study of a subject, especially in order to discover new facts or information about it’ (Oxford Learner’s Dictionary, 2022), then creative writing students in higher education might learn as much, if not more, from their own research, as from lecturers/tutors.\n\nThis chapter offers a reading of The Australian Curriculum: English against recent empirical data gathered in exemplary creative writing classrooms in secondary schools in western Sydney . I argue that despite gaps and silences, and despite an apparent skewing away from the 'creative', skilled and confident English teachers are still able to create spaces and interpretations of the new curriculum that invite innovative, aesthetic and affective writing practices and pedagogies. I begin by theorising the 'creative' and 'creative writing pedagogies' and situating these within broader historical, philosophical and pedagogical contexts. In this section I consider perceived problems with 'creative' pedagogies and outline responses to these. In the second section of the chapter I focus on a sample of the resources included with The Australian Curriculum: English with a particular focus on assessment. I suggest that the student work samples supplied with the curriculum reflect impoverished views of the capacities of the writing teacher and of the student writer, and of writing pedagogies in English. I suggest that difficulties in reading The Australian Curriculum in terms of its assessment imperatives are exacerbated as explicit connections have not yet been made with NAPLAN and the Reporting framework of MySchool, although all three initiatives are the work of ACARA. The third section of the chapter presents a 'creative writing lesson' in a western Sydney comprehensive secondary school. Here I discuss the exemplary characteristics of the lesson, explore the teacher's articulation of her creative writing pedagogy and the rich assessment tasks she devises for her students and consider these in relation to the possibilities and limitations of The Australian Curriculum: English. Finally, I conclude that English teachers need not take up the mandated curriculum in reductive ways, noting that educational policies including mandated curriculum on a national scale are inherently unstable and necessarily contested, negotiated and adapted in local sites of practice – states, systems, schools and classrooms."
