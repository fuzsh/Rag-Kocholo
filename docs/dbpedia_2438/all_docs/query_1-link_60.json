        "text": "My DS has just been offered an Erasmus Year in UEA. He is studying English Literature, not in the UK. He applied here as from the prospectus it has a very good creative writing program which he is interested in. He has also been offered a place at a well ranked University in the US but the English Department there does not seem to be as strong creatively which as I say is his main interest. Obviously he can also stay where he is which is a very well known University (Red brick Equivalent)\n\nAnyone have an experience of English Lit, specifically creative writing in UAE.\n\nAlso what Norwich like as a university city?\n\nThanks"
