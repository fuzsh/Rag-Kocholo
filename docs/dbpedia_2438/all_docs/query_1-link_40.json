        "text": "Suffragettes Heritage Project\n\nStanislava Dikova and Annie Kelly (Consortium for Humanities and the Arts South-East England (CHASE) placements) started on 8 May. They have been working to a tight deadline, selecting, describing and digitising materials from the suffragette archive (Kenney Papers) for a creative writing workshop and other community engagement workshops taking place within Norfolk Library service, as well as digitising materials which are soon to be loaned for an exhibition in Oldham.\n\nEvents\n\nGraham Linehan (Father Ted, IT Crowd …) held two scriptwriting seminars on 18 May – ‘Creating Ideas’ and ‘Writing Comedy’. These were held in the Enterprise Centre and hosted by the British Archive for Contemporary Writing (BACW) & Dr Brett Mills (Art, Media & American Studies). 25 students attended.\n\n‘Genuine & hilarious screenwriter imparting knowledge & experience.’\n\n‘Brilliant insights into the industry, charismatic delivery.’\n\n‘Excellent mix of self-reference and contemporary examples from elsewhere.’\n\nGeneral\n\nThe Academic and Research Libraries Group (ARLG) Eastern visited on 22 May for a general introduction to the BACW.\n\nDoris Lessing Archive\n\nA visiting postgraduate student researching ‘Gender, Culture and Social Change in the Fiction of Margaret Drabble’ has visited to read the correspondence between Lessing and her friend Drabble.\n\nKenney Papers (suffragettes)\n\nNorwich based ‘Art at Work’ visited our suffragette archives as part of an art and wellbeing community project funded for Suffragette 100 celebrations. They had the opportunity to see a display of archive material and were especially drawn to the 1917 Russian diary. This documents a three-month government sponsored trip made by Jessie Kenney and Emmeline Pankhurst as part of an effort to gain the support of Russian women in the war. The unpublished manuscript was prepared under the title The Price of Liberty.\n\nNaomi Alderman Archive\n\nMA students of Contemporary Fiction are visiting individually to study the first draft of The Power, winner of the 2017 Baileys Women’s Prize for Fiction.\n\nPritchard Papers\n\nA writer has visited over two days to work on the finalisation of a publication on Lawn Road Flats, the modernist building designed by Wells Coates and opened in 1934.\n\nUEA Collection\n\nArchitectural consultants have visited to research some of UEA’s iconic buildings. They are assisting Estates in developing a buildings conservation strategy.\n\nWe have been trying to find a 1973 article which apparently appeared in the UEA student magazine Twice on dyeing the fountain in the Square pink. Whilst we have found a news cutting on the adding of soap powder, we have yet to find the ‘pink’ article.\n\nZuckerman Archive\n\nA UEA academic is consulting bombing survey reports and papers on the WWII bombing of Pantelleria and mainland Italy. The island was invaded by Allied forces on 11 June 1943 under the code name of Operation Corkscrew.\n\nSpecial Collections\n\nThere were 20 enquiries; and a visit from a MA Art History class studying the works of Peter Henry Emerson – Wild life on a tidal water: the adventures of a houseboat and her crew (1890); and Marsh leaves from the Norfolk broad-land (1898).\n\nEach year the UEA Students’ Union hosts a week-long festival of events encouraging students to ‘Do Something Different’, try something new, build knowledge and experience, meet new friends and have fun along the way. A wide range of extra-curricular activities are submitted to the programme, there’s something for everyone. By the end of the week (19-23 Feb) it is hoped that as many as possible will be able to say “I did different.”\n\nThis tradition is very much in keeping with the spirit of UEA when ‘Do different’ was adopted as the fledgling university’s motto in 1963. ‘Do different’ can be seen embedded in the foot of our coat of arms, along with three gold crowns symbolising the ancient kingdom of East Anglia, an angel holding an open book to indicate a place of learning and Norwich Castle at its centre.\n\nChoosing a motto proved more controversial than deciding on the design of a coat of arms. The last thing Frank Thistlethwaite (founding Vice-Chancellor) wanted for a mid-twentieth century university was yet another late Victorian Latin tag. He was encouraged in this by medieval historian and friend Michael Maclagan. “Heraldry, [Maclagan] said, ever since it first evolved had been characterised by an element of pageant, of theatre, indeed of kitsch. Mottos should be bold and simple and were often in the vernacular.”\n\nEver since Thistlethwaite had come to Norwich he had enjoyed the Norfolk dialect saying ‘in Norfolk we du different’. He used the phrase as the theme in an early speech and won praise from the Eastern Evening News which ran with a headline ‘Du Different a Virtue’. The expression is based on the independent spirit of East Anglians who prefer the course of action they feel to be right to that which is conventional. When encouraged by the dean of BIO, Thomas Bennet-Clark, Thistlethwaite jumped at the chance to adopt it, though after going through the College of Arms mill it emerged as ‘Do different’.\n\nIt was found to be a contentious choice, some thinking it was making fun at the Norfolk dialect. Others praised it for expressing the independent nature of the local character. UEA’s attempt to produce a motto which broke with tradition, yet aimed to please, won it instant recognition for living up to its motto from the outset.\n\nThe rightness of the choice, as Thistlethwaite pointed out many decades later, has been proven over time, a motto not only remembered but quoted; and in this week of ‘Do Something Different’, brought into play.\n\nReferences:\n\nThistlethwaite, Frank. Origins: a personal reminiscence of UEA’s foundation.\n\nUEA Collection/SMI (student’s correspondence, 1963-1966)].\n\nAn Unboxed blog from Isabel Hassan, School of Literature, Drama and Creative Writing at the University of East Anglia.\n\nIn 1965 Cecil Beaton was approached by Vice-Chancellor Frank Thistlethwaite to design the academic dress for the new University of East Anglia’s first graduation. Beaton introduced the use of indigo blue gowns at UEA, whereas other universities up and down the country had mostly opted for the traditional black.\n\nCecil Beaton was, amongst other things, an Academy Award-winning stage and costume designer for films and the theatre. Prior to designing the UEA graduation gowns, he had worked on Broadway designing costumes.\n\nBeaton thought that the graduation gowns needed to be more theatrical; if you had worked hard to get a degree, you should be able to dress up and flaunt yourself a little on the day you receive that degree.\n\nThe cost of Beaton’s indigo blue graduation gown was £2 in 1966, increasing to £4 in 1970. Current university students may think this is affordable, but £4 in 1970 would today be worth £43.26 which is only slightly cheaper than the current £50 cost for UEA students. However, in 1970 “only 20 of the 2,500 students there [at UEA] have thought it worth paying £4 for the dark-blue gowns.”\n\nOne aspect of Beaton’s design which did not catch on was his suggestion for novel graduation caps. According to Nicholas Groves’ The Academical Dress of UEA, Beaton wanted to “abandon the traditional square cap (mortar-board) [ . . . ] and to invent a special hat for bachelors, and another for masters.” This hat was more rounded in shape and was called the ‘Dan Dare’ (pictured). The design was a result of Beaton’s desire to make the entire graduation look more theatrical. However, Groves admits that “they proved unable to withstand popular opinion, and have been replaced by the traditional square.”\n\nAlthough the Dan Dare may not have prevailed, the indigo-blue graduation gowns have. This is interesting considering that UEA students in 1970 did not think the indigo-blue gowns were worth paying for, and now they are almost iconic at UEA.\n\n2017 will see another year of UEA students graduate in these blue gowns from 17th – 21st July.\n\nNotes\n\n1. A major problem of the indigo gowns was that, over the years, the cloth used grew gradually lighter in colour, until by the mid-1990s it was almost air-force blue. It has since returned to a darker shade (Nicholas Groves. The Academical Dress of the University of East Anglia, 2005).\n\n2. The undergraduates were given a short knee-length cape rather than a gown, with slits for the passage of the arms. The colour is recorded as smokey blue (Michael Sanderson. The History of the University of East Anglia, 2002) and as indigo (Groves, ibid).\n\nThis summer the Library is undergoing yet another makeover. Around 180 new and varied study spaces will be created, mainly on Floor 01. This has been made possible as over two miles of open-access rolling stack shelving will be introduced on Floor 02 (just alongside the Archives). Once the dust has settled and the stock re-shuffled, there’ll be more light, more colour and an improved layout on Floor 01. The Archives also stands to re-gain over 250 metres of shelving in its climate-controlled store.\n\nKeeping up with ever increasing student numbers and changing methods of study is an ongoing challenge for a Library which was built almost 50 years ago. The Plan was for a University which would contain three thousand students in ten years with the possibility of expansion to six thousand thereafter. In 2017 we now have over 16,000 students, all requiring to be connected to a device or screen of some sort or other.\n\nEach of the six floors has had its turn for re-design, a splash of colour, more comfortable seating, with better access to computers and technical facilities. We’ve introduced individual and group study rooms and even a small cinema. In short, we have grown and we have improved, more than once or twice. Let’s take a look back.\n\nMilestones:\n\nApril 1963\n\nArchitects Denys Lasdun and Partners publish a Development Plan for the University.\n\n13 February 1968\n\n‘Topping out’ of the Library building by Frank Thistlethwaite (Vice-Chancellor).\n\n25 October 1968\n\nOfficial opening by Lord Franks (Chancellor) as Library Phase I is completed.\n\nJuly 1974\n\nCompletion of Library Phase II (Architects Feilden & Mawson). The original block doubles in size to form a near square and extends southwards. The two halves join to form one seamless building and it comes as a surprise that it is by two different architects but with Denys Lasdun’s design.\n\nHow we looked in the sixties and seventies\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\n9 April 2001\n\nOpening of the LaRC (Learning and Resources Centre), Floor 02.\n\nJune 2005\n\nFloor 0 refurbishment. The Reception and Helpdesks are amalgamated and positioned near the entrance.\n\n8 March 2006\n\nOfficial opening of the extension and Archives. The ‘extension’ on the east side transforms the rather square looking building into a dogleg. It offers smooth access between the old and new parts on all floors; this part of the Library is light and airy with extensive glazing and solar shading. Its cedar and stone cladding offers a break from the severe grey concrete.\n\nThe new Archives reading rooms, office and climate-controlled store (Floor 02) are opened by Rose Tremain (who later is appointed Chancellor). [Architects: Shepheard Epstein Hunter; construction by Kier Eastern].\n\n27 October 2010\n\nOpening of refurbished Floor 0 and the Silent Reading Room on Floor 1.\n\nSeptember 2012\n\nOpening of the Silent Reading Room on Floor 02.\n\n2014\n\nOpening of large Postgraduate Study Rooms on Floors 2 and 3.\n\nJune – September 2017\n\nRefurbishment of Floors 01 and 02."
