He is a visiting lecturer at West Dean College, Lancaster University, Goldsmiths University and Faber Academy.\n\nMick is also teaching short courses at the West Dean London Bloomsbury campus. (Please see the link in the Short Courses toolbar on the website)\n\nDescribe your approach to teaching\n\nI try and expose my students to a wide range of texts and ideas and want them to feel able to take risks without fear of embarrassment.\n\nWhat inspires your own work?\n\nMy fiction tends to be about characters on the periphery. My ideas come from overheard conversation, newspaper articles, the radio. The problem is finding the time to turn them into novels.\n\nBooks\n\nThe Underground Man, novel (Picador, 1997)\n\nFive Boys, novel (Faber and Faber, 2001)\n\nTen Sorry Tales, short stories (Faber and Faber, 2005)\n\nBears of England, novella (Faber and Faber, 2009)\n\nThe Widow’s Tale, novel (Faber and Faber, 2010)\n\nJunior Science, e-book, short stories (Faber and Faber, 2011)\n\nYuki chan in Bronte Country, novel (Faber and Faber, 2016)\n\nElla May Does it Her Way, children’s book (Quarto, 2019)\n\nPrizes & nominations"
