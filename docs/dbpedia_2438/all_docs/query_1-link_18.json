        "text": "UEA MARSHALL SCHOLARSHIPS\n\nThis Scholarship is for Graduate Study in any subject at either Masters or Doctoral level at the University of East Anglia and will be for up to two years (with a possibility of a third year for doctoral studies). If awarded a UEA Marshall Scholarship candidates would be expected to study at the University of East Anglia.\n\nThe following Information has been provided by the University of East Anglia.\n\nFast Facts\n\nThe University introduced the UK’s first School of Environmental Sciences in 1967, which is still considered one of “the strongest in the world”. The esteemed ENDS report identified the School of Environmental Science as one of the most influential environmental organisations over the last thirty years.\n\nUEA launched the UK’s first MA in Creative Writing in 1970. Many well-known writers have graduated from or taught on our prestigious creative writing course, including Rose Tremain, Angela Carter, Ian McEwan, Andrew Motion, Tracy Chevalier and Nobel Laureate Kazuo Ishiguro. UEA presents two annual International Literary Festivals, bringing well known authors to campus for special readings and lectures.\n\nThe University also houses the Sainsbury Centre, one of the most prominent university art galleries in Britain, and a major national centre for the study and presentation of art. Our students are able to study a wider range of artistic cultures, periods and forms than in any other art history department in the UK.\n\nIn the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF) assessment, more than 80 per cent of the University's research activity was deemed to be 'world leading' or 'internationally excellent', placing it in the Top 10 in the UK based on quality of research output. Academic fortitudes include Social Work and Social Policy, International Development, Art History and American Studies. UEA also has strong programs in Nutrition, English, Chemistry and Environmental Sciences. The University of East Anglia (UEA) has been awarded a gold ranking in the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF).\n\nThe University is also part of the Norwich Research Park, one of Europe’s leading centres for research and development with expertise in plants, microbes, food, health, the environment, and information systems, and which comprises one of the most significant concentrations of ‘most highly cited research’ in the UK. The Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, walking distance from campus, provides opportunities for practical application in all aspects of biomedical research and the teaching and training of health care professionals.\n\nLife In\n\nOur 320-acre campus provides teaching, research and accommodation within a few minutes’ walk of any location. The 460-metre long ‘teaching wall’ designed by Sir Denys Lasdun forms the central original focus of teaching and research. New facilities have been thoughtfully incorporated into the campus structure – including the Climatic Research Unit and the Enterprise Centre, a multi-million pound development and Britain’s greenest building. Our new £30 million state-of-the-art teaching and learning building is currently being built on campus and is due to open in July 2019. The 7150m2 four-storey space will include three floors of flexible science teaching laboratories, allowing both large and small practical teaching across science subjects, including Environmental Sciences, Computing, Biology, Physics, Engineering and Chemistry and Pharmacy.\n\nSporting, cultural and social facilities, including one of the largest sports complexes in the UK – the SportsPark – and the world-famous Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts. Both are located on campus and available to students. Campus and its grounds are open to the public and the site is visited by thousands each year who enjoy the beauty of the parkland, forest and waterways, including the River Yare and the campus lake, The Broad.\n\nThe campus has over 3,500 self-catering student rooms (including one postgraduate only option), a range of eateries, including pubs and nightclubs, medical services, and banking and shopping outlets.\n\nA UNESCO World City of Literature and home to the Norwich Writers’ Centre, the city of Norwich offers an excellent British experience. Once the capital of the East Anglia region, Norwich boasts a wealth of historic and social charm as well as award-winning entertainment venues. Norwich is one of the safest cities in the UK and hosts an amazing number of cultural, artistic and musical events each year, including the Norwich Beer Festival, the Norfolk & Norwich Festival, and the Norwich Food & Drink Festival.\n\nWith an international airport and half-hourly trains to central London, Norwich is well-connected to Europe by excellent road, rail and air links. Overall, UEA is an outstanding choice for postgraduate students!"
