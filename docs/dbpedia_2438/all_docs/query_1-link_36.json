        "text": "“What is the difference between God and Malcolm Bradbury?” a student once wrote on a lavatory wall at the University of East Anglia. “None. Both are said to be everywhere yet are hard to see.”\n\nWhatever comment that student was passing on the author and critic’s apparently casual teaching practices, the point about Bradbury’s influence remains every bit as true, 23 years after his death. The creative-writing MA he established during the 1970s at UEA remains the gold standard of its type, the first of its kind in the UK and with an alumni list that reads like a roll call of late- 20th-century British and Irish literary talent: Rose Tremain, Ian McEwan, Kazuo Ishiguro, Anne Enright, Paul Murray, Diana Evans. If success can be measured in prizes, then the three Bookers, seven Costas, two Women’s Prizes and one Nobel won by UEA graduates are hard to beat. Certainly, it’s hard to think of another institution or person in the past 50 years that has had a greater influence on what we, as a nation, read and write.\n\nThe news that the UEA’s current debts of £30 million threaten Bradbury’s legacy has therefore been met with understandable dismay. McEwan has called the subsequent decision that, of the proposed 36 redundancies in the academic staff, 31 will come from the Faculty of Arts and Humanities, as “gross bureaucratic folly”. The university says it “anticipates very few redundancies” from the creative-writing course, but that hasn’t reassured the 750 signatories, including current and former students, behind a letter of protest published in The Times.\n\nArts and humanities degrees are under siege across the board, of course, as cash strapped institutions (and government funding decisions) prioritise Stem subjects and vocational courses. Even so, the diminishing of UEA’s writing MA – a course of global reputation, whose tutors have included Angela Carter and the critic Lorna Sage – feels like a major shift in the weather: a threat to the idea of the novel as an artform honed through expertise.\n\nBefore Bradbury set up the UEA creative-writing MA in 1971, there was no such thing as a creative-writing degree in the UK. The feeling, both in academia and the wider culture beyond, had been that writing was something one did by oneself, possibly in a garret, using God-given talent alone. The literary imagination was innate, and not something that could be cultivated or, perish the thought, bought. Bradbury, however, was always an outsider to mainstream thinking, and in the decidedly non-Oxbridge, non-metropolitan wilds of Norwich, he was keen to create, as the academic Lise Jaillant has pointed out, “a literary powerhouse... as a reaction against existing models of literary success”.\n\nRejecting what he regarded as the “British custom of amateurish isolationism”, Bradbury modelled his creative-writing course on the prestigious Iowa Writers’ Workshop, established in 1936, in which a dozen or so students would gather on a regular basis to critique each other’s work. From the beginning, the emphasis at UEA was on reading, on rewriting one’s own work, and on using the literature of the past as a guide to best practice. He was well aware that the concept would be met with profound scepticism. The course, he later said, “was generally regarded as a dangerous American invention, like the vacuum cleaner and the hula hoop, and certainly not one that had a place in the literature department of a British university.”\n\nThese days, 96 British universities offer more than 400 creative-writing courses between them, and that’s before one counts up the proliferating online courses variously run by established authors, teachers, private institutions, publishers (including the in-house Faber Academy, set up in 2008) – not to mention complete unknowns. Many of the best use the workshop method, in which a piece of work is deconstructed and discussed in front of its author, but some follow a conservatoire approach of one-to-one tuition. Their shared aim is to teach their students good writing, but also, invariably, how to get published, which is not always the same thing.\n\nStill, those who incorporate vision with rigour have the potential to become literary movements in their own right. The Dublin-based Stinging Fly, which as a magazine launched the careers of Sally Rooney, Nicole Flattery and Kevin Barry, now offers writer workshops and is one of the most powerful literary forces in Ireland today.\n\nIn America, MFA creative-writing degrees are so ingrained in the culture that they have literally shaped the country’s postwar literary imagination: prominent graduates include Jay McInerney and David Foster Wallace. There, it’s practically a prerequisite to becoming a novelist in the first place: some publishers won’t look at the work of an author without one.\n\nBradbury, meanwhile, regarded his UEA degree as having almost single-handedly changed the shape of the British literary landscape. While chairman of the Booker Prize in 1981, he gave a speech arguing that UEA writers such as McEwan and Angela Carter “have shifted the novel away from the median realism and provincialism that was so influential in the 1950s, towards largeness, moral strangeness, fantasy and grotesquerie”.\n\nOf course, criticism of these courses has raged for as long as they have existed. Some people accuse them of now producing interchangeable writers and “cookie-cutter prose”. Because nearly all involve fees, they are also accused of elitism and prioritising the white-middle-class experience, although with many courses now promoting diversity and inclusion, that’s no longer so much the case.\n\nMost profoundly, they are accused of legitimising a culture of prescribed ideas and expectations, in which students of variable talent assume that merely by completing a course that tells them how to write, they can become a writer; that they legitimise the delusion that everyone has a novel in them somewhere, and thus enlarge the dreary sea of mediocrity churned out by today’s self-publishing industry.\n\nYet the truth is that the best creative-writing courses increasingly do the job that the editors in our publishing houses used to do: selecting the best and shuffling out the rest. Unlike publishing houses, they also place an emphasis on old-fashioned technique, rather than on the ideology of the day. They embody a paradox: that writing can be taught, but that only the most talented can become writers.\n\nThe truth of that is in the pudding. Fiction needs visionaries such as Bradbury to push it towards the large, the strange, the fantastical and the grotesque – and to find and cultivate our best writers. It would be an irony of the most absurd, depressing sort if the institution that made modern British fiction a force to be reckoned with on the world stage is the very one now threatening to diminish its reputation."
