        "text": "Media Reviews\n\n\"Tremain renders this untamed area with haunting prose, but the affecting sense of dread she builds makes her tale at times unrelentingly grim.\" - Publishers Weekly\n\n\"No Tremain novel is like any other. This one is much darker but no less compelling than the celebrated The Road Home.\" - Library Journal\n\n\"Tremain's intimate knowledge of the Cévenol is evident throughout Trespass. She evokes the coolness of the old dark house, its thick stone walls and high ceilings, reminiscent of a church roof.\" - The Guardian (UK)\n\n\"If a sense of strain is to be found in this novel, it is in its multiplicity of narrative threads....Add to them the emotional baggage of Veronica and Kittys uneasy relationship, and of little Melodie, and the whole enterprise sometimes seems to risk foundering. It doesnt, of course. Tremain steers her story towards its redemptive conclusion so deftly it seems churlish to feel that something less poised might have been more moving.\" - The Telegraph (UK)\n\n\"[B]oth vivid and wonderfully compressed, the eye that is cast over proceedings unblinking. There is no striving for effect; such imagery as is deployed is perfectly judged, the story- telling is stripped down to its purest form, and the command of the material is total. The novel is only 250 pages long, but it packs an enormous punch  the work of a writer at the top of her game.\" - The Independent (UK)\n\n\"Trespass is full of such particular insights but in the end, imagination seems squandered on a routine plot.\" - The Times (UK)"
