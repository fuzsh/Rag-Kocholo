        "text": "This exhibition opens at the Victoria and Albert Museum on 15 July 2017. ‘Featuring groundbreaking pieces by Alvar Aalto, Marcel Breuer and Charles and Ray Eames, alongside an incredible range of objects from planes to skateboards, this exhibition tells the story of how this often-overlooked material made the modern world.’\n\nOn display from UEA Archives are printed designs showing plywood profiles for railway carriages. These were produced by Estonian furniture maker A.M. Luther Ltd, circa 193? They form part of the Pritchard Papers, an archive rich in the history and development of the use of plywood in furniture making.\n\nPlywood in the Pritchard Papers\n\nJack Pritchard began producing plywood furniture from 1933. The first products were modular shelf units designed by Wells Coates and manufactured by Venesta (Pritchard’s then employer). Venesta was a useful introduction to the industry, with its factories in Estonia, Latvia and Finland. A couple of years later Pritchard set up Isokon Furniture Company. They marketed the designs of other companies such as Finmar and PEL, and with the arrival of European designers Marcel Breuer and Walter Gropius expanded their own range of furniture with a particular emphasis on plywood. Marcel Breuer’s Long Chair was a resounding success and is still manufactured today by Isokon Plus.\n\nOther noteworthy items include Egon Riss’ Penguin Donkey book-case and Bottleship, both re-designed after the War by Ernest Race; and Breuer’s nesting tables.\n\nPritchard not only worked with plywood but he also surrounded himself with it at home. He and his wife Molly built the iconic Lawn Road Flats in Hampstead, London. A block of flats built for minimalist living, complete with built-in wardrobes, modular shelf units, nifty partitions, and a love of all things light and portable which facilitated an unencumbered lifestyle. Plywood did all of this. The Isokon flats are now grade I listed and include a gallery celebrating the buildings’ history, including the history of its members’ only Isobar restaurant.\n\nA search for ‘plywood’ in the catalogue delivers over 200 results. It includes patents; details of the supply of furniture and raw products; customer orders; sales; correspondence; and Pritchard’s 1939 lecture ‘Design in Plywood’. Here he highlights the qualities of plywood, and the opportunities which arise when making full use of its “natural whippiness and springiness”, most evident in a new area of development involving the creation of built-up timber. He refers to Breuer’s Long Chair as being the greatest achievement in the use of plywood to date.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nPhotographs: Pritchard Papers, University of East Anglia.\n\nPritchard Papers and online guide\n\nIsokon Gallery\n\nMarcel Breuer Digital Archive\n\nPlywood exhibition at the V&A\n\nIf you would like to know more about the collection please contact archives@uea.ac.uk\n\nBridget Gillies\n\nIn June, Archives staff settled into the Silent Reading Room just along the corridor and we expect to be here for several weeks. Refurbishment work continues on Floor 02 and the builders have gone to great lengths in safeguarding our equipment and the collections, even installing temporary walls and doors.\n\nBACW\n\nUEA students have been consulting Tash Aw’s Archive and Doris Lessing’s correspondence.\n\n10 PhD students of creative writing, literature, history, languages and linguistics attended our joint British Archive for Contemporary Writing and East Anglian Film Archives workshop at the CHASE Encounters Conference held at UEA on 29 and 30 June.The workshop highlighted the opportunities and challenges of using film and literary Archive material for research and teaching, as well as the day to day role of the Archivist and the future challenge for archives in managing born digital material.Students were provided with hands on access to copies of unique archive material to help simulate the process of independent archive research. This provoked some interesting discussion, particularly amongst creative writers who were prompted to consider their own archive material.\n\nKenney Papers (Suffragettes)\n\n• We are preparing materials for an external exhibition to be held in 2018/19.\n\n• The collection is being used by a writer as the basis for her work of fiction.\n\nPritchard Papers\n\nOne user is researching for a book on Lawn Road Flats and artists of the 1930s; another is writing a book on art, design and science.\n\nOther enquiries related to the Pritchard family tree; and to Walter Gropius’ farewell dinner guest list from 1937.\n\nRoger Deakin\n\nUsers are reminded that the BBC recording of Cigarette on the Waveney is publicly available online (a tranquil documentary of Deakin’s trip down the River Waveney in a white canoe). For UEA members, his recordings of The House and The Garden are available on Box of Broadcasts.\n\nUEA Collection\n\nMalcolm Bradbury’s large magazine and newspaper archive has been accessed by a visiting academic in LDC (School of Literature, Drama and Creative Writing).\n\nZuckerman Archive\n\nThe collection has been accessed for the correspondence of Lord Zuckerman, Lord Mountbatten and Margaret Thatcher; and for architectural drawings of German and Italian buildings held within WWII bombing reports.\n\nSpecial Collections\n\nA valuable addition to the collection has been a limited facsimile edition of Robert Rauschenberg‘s 34 illustrations after Dante’s Inferno. Produced by New York’s Museum of Modern Art and presented in a grey clothbound clamshell box, it includes the trade publication. Rauschenberg’s series of drawings from 1958–60 are each reproduced at actual size on individual sheets; a drawing for each Canto of Dante’s poem. A copy of the trade publication is on order for the Library’s open shelves.\n\nThere were 12 enquiries for Special Collections.\n\nThis summer the Library is undergoing yet another makeover. Around 180 new and varied study spaces will be created, mainly on Floor 01. This has been made possible as over two miles of open-access rolling stack shelving will be introduced on Floor 02 (just alongside the Archives). Once the dust has settled and the stock re-shuffled, there’ll be more light, more colour and an improved layout on Floor 01. The Archives also stands to re-gain over 250 metres of shelving in its climate-controlled store.\n\nKeeping up with ever increasing student numbers and changing methods of study is an ongoing challenge for a Library which was built almost 50 years ago. The Plan was for a University which would contain three thousand students in ten years with the possibility of expansion to six thousand thereafter. In 2017 we now have over 16,000 students, all requiring to be connected to a device or screen of some sort or other.\n\nEach of the six floors has had its turn for re-design, a splash of colour, more comfortable seating, with better access to computers and technical facilities. We’ve introduced individual and group study rooms and even a small cinema. In short, we have grown and we have improved, more than once or twice. Let’s take a look back.\n\nMilestones:\n\nApril 1963\n\nArchitects Denys Lasdun and Partners publish a Development Plan for the University.\n\n13 February 1968\n\n‘Topping out’ of the Library building by Frank Thistlethwaite (Vice-Chancellor).\n\n25 October 1968\n\nOfficial opening by Lord Franks (Chancellor) as Library Phase I is completed.\n\nJuly 1974\n\nCompletion of Library Phase II (Architects Feilden & Mawson). The original block doubles in size to form a near square and extends southwards. The two halves join to form one seamless building and it comes as a surprise that it is by two different architects but with Denys Lasdun’s design.\n\nHow we looked in the sixties and seventies\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\n9 April 2001\n\nOpening of the LaRC (Learning and Resources Centre), Floor 02.\n\nJune 2005\n\nFloor 0 refurbishment. The Reception and Helpdesks are amalgamated and positioned near the entrance.\n\n8 March 2006\n\nOfficial opening of the extension and Archives. The ‘extension’ on the east side transforms the rather square looking building into a dogleg. It offers smooth access between the old and new parts on all floors; this part of the Library is light and airy with extensive glazing and solar shading. Its cedar and stone cladding offers a break from the severe grey concrete.\n\nThe new Archives reading rooms, office and climate-controlled store (Floor 02) are opened by Rose Tremain (who later is appointed Chancellor). [Architects: Shepheard Epstein Hunter; construction by Kier Eastern].\n\n27 October 2010\n\nOpening of refurbished Floor 0 and the Silent Reading Room on Floor 1.\n\nSeptember 2012\n\nOpening of the Silent Reading Room on Floor 02.\n\n2014\n\nOpening of large Postgraduate Study Rooms on Floors 2 and 3.\n\nJune – September 2017\n\nRefurbishment of Floors 01 and 02.\n\nUEA literature student, Melina Spanoudi, revisits an archived interview with Kazuo Ishiguro as part of the British Archive for Contemporary Writing’s Unboxed project.\n\nKazuo Ishiguro applied to the University of East Anglia in 1979, following a long year of social work in London. The MA in Creative Writing began in autumn, leaving the entire summer free for him to panic. He did so briefly, before beginning to write seriously for the first time. Ten years later, he won the Man Booker Prize for his novel The Remains of the Day.\n\nReturning to UEA during the Literary Festival of 1999, in an interview with award winning academic, novelist and biographer, Christopher Bigsby, Ishiguro is asked whether writing can be taught. Put plainly, his answer is no. Ishiguro believes that a writer cannot be crafted: rather, they are sculpted, refined in their involvement with the creative process of writing within an academic environment. Through sharing first drafts, exposing themselves and others to criticism, embarrassment and acclaim, the writer is given the opportunity to realize where they must stand when choosing to write.\n\nHowever, the initial choice to write remains a personal matter. Any creation which is forced to extend itself beyond the boundaries of personal innovation is of no genuine value; you cannot fake a writer more than you can fake a text.\n\nIshiguro remarks: ‘You can certainly produce someone who can write more competently. But I would be rather more sceptical about the possibility of their producing anything of artistic worth.’\n\nThe process between writing and identifying as a writer is unique to each individual; However, what happens when you embark on a degree which expects you to be a writer before you have begun to write?\n\nWith little writing experience, sporadically noting descriptive fragments mirroring the semi-autobiographical style of Kerouac, Ishiguro’s journey to becoming a writer invites us to question whether he adopted the identity of ‘writer’ during the course of his degree in Creative Writing. Ishiguro explains that he discovered the space he required to explore his individual style of writing at the UEA. The learning atmosphere fostered through the flexible teaching methods adopted by his tutors, Malcom Bradbury and Angela Carter, enabled him to create, unaided and uninterrupted.\n\nHe describes his year at the UEA to Bigsby: ‘That was when I really started to write. So it was very fundamental. Before I went to East Anglia I had written very little indeed, certainly nothing I would count today as proper writing.’\n\nIshiguro dates the beginning of his first novel, A Pale View of Hills, in 1979/80, during the year he was studying at the UEA. He notes that most of his time studying Creative Writing was spent writing that novel. Although his first book resembled a form of a semi-autobiographical work, his later novels are informed by the awareness of his ability to create outside the context of his own life.\n\nHe explains: ‘Somewhere along the way I discovered that I could write better, more effectively, if I changed the setting and put the whole thing at a greater distance.’\n\nSomewhere along the way, perhaps at UEA, Ishiguro became one of the greatest writers of our time. His journey at the university reminds students of Literature, Drama and Creative Writing that we are not taught how to become writers, but of the ways which enable us to discover our most humane and distinctive narrative voices.\n\nQuotations reproduced with the kind permission of the author.

This all changed when Sir Malcolm Bradbury and Sir Angus Wilson founded a Creative Writing MA at the University of East Anglia, the very first of its kind in the UK. If you head down to floor 02, right in the depths of UEA’s library, you will find the British Archive for Contemporary Writing, home to an extensive collection on the history of the Creative Writing MA and the life of its founder, Sir Malcolm Bradbury.\n\nOne of the many hidden gems within the archive is an image of some of the first students on the Creative Writing MA course, under the supervision of Sir Malcolm Bradbury. The enthusiasm and essence of UEA as a hub for literature and creative writing is further captured in an image from The Guardian’s picture archive. The students in the picture are smiling to one another as they take part in what appears to have been some form of seminar or discussion about their writing. They are under the watchful eye of Sir Malcolm Bradbury, who was then both the course director and a lecturer. These students were amongst the earliest to be offered the opportunity to complete an MA in creative writing, which at the time concentrated primarily on prose.\n\nSince the picture was taken, the MA has branched out to include courses in poetry, scriptwriting, life writing and crime fiction. However, its world-renowned reputation remains unchanged, with notable graduates including Booker Prize winners Kazuo Ishiguro, Ian McEwan and Anne Enright.\n\nThe founder of the programme, Sir Malcolm Bradbury, led a prolific writing career in his own right. He wrote numerous short stories, television plays and series, literary criticism and novels, many of which were inspired by his experiences of academia, including ‘The History Man’, which was published in 1975.\n\nWithin the archive at UEA are scripts, newspapers, magazine cuttings and other revealing materials, documenting the lifetime of Sir Malcolm Bradbury in terms of both his writing career and his involvement in the creative writing MA at UEA.\n\nThroughout his lifetime, Bradbury was known to have encouraged young, aspiring authors, especially during his time as a lecturer, reader and professor at UEA and he has left behind a lasting legacy for UEA’s creative writing students. He was recognised for his efforts by being made a CBE in 1991 and knighted in 2000 for his outstanding contribution to Literature.\n\nFor further information about Sir Malcolm Bradbury or the history of the creative writing MA at UEA the following links may be of use:\n\nhttps://portal.uea.ac.uk/library/archives/bacw/bradbury\n\nhttp://www.malcolmbradbury.com/index.html\n\nhttps://www.uea.ac.uk/literature/creative-writing/about-uea-creative-writing\n\nA quieter month in terms of footfall in the Archives as our teaching sessions ended for the semester and most students headed off for the Easter break.\n\nBritish Archive for Contemporary Writing (general)\n\nDr Jos Smith has been appointed as Academic Director of BACW. From 1 Sep 2017, he will gradually take over the role from Professor Chris Bigsby, who will step down in 2018.\n\nCharlie Higson\n\nThe listing of this collection is now available to read on-line.\n\n‘Bollock Street’! This is the first title that we’ve been asked to retrieve from the stacks for a reader. A sketch on the Argyle Street squats which existed in Norwich in the 1980s, this unperformed piece was written by Higson and Paul Whitehouse.\n\nDoris Lessing\n\nOne area of interest has been Lessing’s contribution to contemporary women’s literature.\n\nPritchard Papers\n\nThere’s been ongoing research and interest into the artists, designers and architects of the thirties, including Maxwell Fry, Marcel Breuer, Henry Moore, Ben Nicholson, John Piper and Sir Nikolaus Pevsner.\n\nRoger Deakin\n\nUEA and the Writers’ Centre Norwich held a celebratory symposium on 30 April to mark Deakin’s life and his contribution to conservation and nature writing. Around 80 attended the event; an afternoon of poetry, wild writing, memoirs and personal recollections. Symposium programme.\n\nA small exhibition showing the writing process of Waterlog and Wildwood was included at the event at Dragon Hall and this has now moved to the UEA Library Foyer.\n\nUEA Collection\n\nStaff and alumni have been looking at early prospectuses, congregation DVDs, and ways to further the gig archive.\n\nSpecial Collections\n\n12 enquiries.\n\nAn Unboxed blog, from Martha Griffiths, first year student of American and English Literature at the University of East Anglia.\n\nAmongst the 110 love letters held in the Whitehorn collection at the British Archive for Contemporary Writing from Doris Lessing to her wartime lover, perhaps one gives us a greater insight into her young life, and the society she grew up in. It was written to John R. M. Whitehorn, an RAF serviceman and intimate confidante and is dated sometime around January 1945.\n\nThis letter perfectly captures Lessing’s determination to make her own choices and express herself and her emotions towards others. It describes her relationship with both her husband and the other men that she met, mostly through Communist Party meetings. Not only is she writing to a long-term lover about her husband, but she also describes the “platonic amour” she has met recently. To many, this flirtation may come as a surprise or appear scandalous but, as she would come to say in later interviews, it was just something one did in those times.\n\nShe even joined the Communist Party out of boredom, a feeling shared by many of the RAF soldiers she met there. There is genuine affection in the note towards Whitehorn, but Lessing makes it clear that it would be an unfortunate man who attempted to interfere with her choices.\n\nThis was a woman to be reckoned with; she was totally self-aware and comfortably content to make her own choices. Lessing’s works are known for pushing boundaries and she lived her life to the same beat, whilst aware of her husband’s discomfort with her social life she was not willing to give in to the pull of domesticity.\n\nThe Doris Lessing Archive, held within UEA’s British Archive for Contemporary Writing, is an invaluable source with letters from one of the most influential female authors of the twentieth century. Her eloquence and her passion cannot mask what a formidable opponent she was if ever obstructed\n\nUnboxed\n\nOnce again we’re grateful to our students for offering such insights into our collections. Their blog posts include ‘Men can be feminists: Lord Pethick-Lawrence writes about the suffragettes’ (Kenney Papers) and ‘Terry Pratchett on magic and realism’ (UEA Literary Festival).\n\nTeaching\n\n54 students and tutors attended teaching sessions this month in the Archives:\n\nMA Contemporary Fiction.

Some very relevant material was found on Watt’s short but significant time at UEA, 1962-1964. Watt was later Professor of English at the University of Stanford, Calif. [Photo: Frank Thistlethwaite Archive].\n\nSpecial Collections\n\nEight requests.\n\nA guest blog from the students of Heinz-Berggruen-Gymnasium in Berlin, Charlottenburg who visited the WG Sebald Audiovisual collection at the British Archive for Contemporary Writing last Summer (just days after the Brexit referendum).\n\nThank you UEA!\n\nThis summer we are leaving school. This means also looking back on eight years at Heinz-Berggruen-Gymnasium in Berlin, Charlottenburg.\n\nOne unforgettable memory is our trip to England last June (2016).\n\nDuring that school trip we also went to UEA because we wanted to find out more about W.G. Sebald, a well known German author who had lived in England most of his time and had taught at UEA.\n\nOur visit to UEA was and still is an unforgettable experience.\n\nUndoubtedly, for people who are interested in literature visiting the University of East Anglia in Norwich is a great opportunity to gain knowledge in a very comfortable and personal way.\n\nWe were especially lucky as Professor Jon Cook offered to speak to us about Sebald.\n\nWhen Professor Cook read from Sebald’s books and added stories from his personal encounters and his cooperation with Sebald we could all feel the power of this exceptional author.\n\nThat way we not only gained insight into Sebald’s work but also got to know what he must have been like in private life.\n\nWe were all particularly moved when Professor Jon Cook pointed out how devastated he was on the news of Sebald’s death and how UEA had lost a creative spirit.\n\nWe also went to the archive where we were introduced to visual and audio material, which added greatly to our impressions of Sebald’s work and life in Norwich.\n\nOn top of that Professor Cook’s explanations regarding the Brexit referendum impressed us deeply and they are as fresh today, March 29, 2017, as they were last summer.\n\nIn the end we left Norwich deeply impressed and enriched because we had spent a morning sensing the invigorating power of creativity and reason.\n\nWe would therefore like to thank Professor Cook and his staff, who introduced us to the audio and visual material, once again for making this possible.\n\nThank you!\n\nStudents from Heinz-Berggruen-Gymnasium, Berlin."
