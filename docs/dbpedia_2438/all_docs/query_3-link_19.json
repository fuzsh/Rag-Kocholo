        "text": "We’re delighted to have Martyn Bedford here to share more about his latest novel TWENTY QUESTIONS FOR GLORIA.\n\nMartyn, what was your inspiration for writing TWENTY QUESTIONS FOR GLORIA?\n\nFor all three of my YA novels, the inspiration has come from my own experience of being a teenager – way back in the days when mammoths still roamed the land. Twenty Questions for Gloria arose out of my recollection of being 15 years old and wishing to leave childhood behind and be more independent, more adventurous, more free-spirited . . . but feeling frustrated by all of the restrictions you face as an adolescent. Teachers and parents rule your lives to a large extent, at a time when you want to push the boundaries and discover your own capabilities and limitations. There’s a whole world – a whole future – out there, just beyond your grasp. That’s Gloria’s situation in this novel. Through her, I got the chance to go off on the kind adventure I’d always wanted to, at her age, but never had the courage or audacity to do.\n\nWhat book or books would most resonate with readers who love your book–or visa versa?\n\nA review in the American School Library Journal compared Twenty Questions for Gloria to Eleanor & Park, by Rainbow Rowell – a comparison which I was very pleased with (and flattered by), because I loved that novel. Both stories are centred on a troubled romance between two misfits, so I guess there is a similarity that would appeal to readers who like love’s journey to be a bumpy ride with dark edges.\n\nWhat do you hope readers will take away from TWENTY QUESTIONS FOR GLORIA?\n\nAt first, and for a long time, Gloria sees Uman as the catalyst for change in her life, without realising that the real catalyst for change is inside her. Sometimes we need someone, or something, to ignite the spark within us and Uman is that spark for her. But I very much didn’t want this to be a clichéd tale about a girl who needs a boy to solve her problems. Gloria’s ‘journey’ is that Uman jolts her out of a rut but, with or without him, she has to find her own way forward from there. So, if the novel has a message, it’s this: Learn how to be the hero/heroine of your own story.\n\nHow long or hard was your road to publication? How many books did you write before this one, and how many never got published?\n\nI’d dabbled with writing fiction since my teens but started writing seriously in my mid-20s. Over the next seven years, I wrote two full-length novels for adults, neither of which got published – I received around 40 rejection letters. Then, in my early 30s, I took a masters degree in Creative Writing at university, where I started working on my third novel, called Acts of Revision. It became my first published book, although even this one was turned down by four of the five literary agents I sent it to, and five of the seven publishers who my agent pitched it to. But, at the age of 36, I was finally a published novelist! I wrote four more novels for adults before turning to writing for teenagers. The agent for my adult novels doesn’t handle young adult fiction but a colleague in the same agency does, so he passed my first YA novel, Flip, to her . . . and, luckily, she really liked it. That novel went to auction, with seven UK publishers and four U.S. publishers bidding for it.\n\nHave you had a chance to read TWENTY QUESTIONS FOR GLORIA yet? Do you draw from your own experience as a teenager when writing YA? Do you write as much as you can, as regularly as you can? Share your thoughts about the interview in the comments!\n\nHappy reading,\n\nJocelyn, Shelly, Martina, Anisaa, Sam, Erin, Susan, Lindsey, Sarah, and Kristin"
