        "text": "This story is part of our new Hip-Hop: ’73 Till Infinity series, a celebration of the genre’s 50th anniversary.\n\nIs there any rapper that epitomizes the “American Dream” more than Jay-Z? I mean the guy went from being a drug dealer in Brooklyn to becoming one of the most popular, successful, and respected rappers of all time. His style, flow, and persona have influenced countless rappers to follow in his footsteps. But none of them can do it like Hov.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThroughout his career fans have had a peek into Jay-Z the person, rapper, husband, businessman, and friend.\n\nHere is the evolution of Jay-Z.\n\nWith no record deal to speak of, Jay-Z and his friends Damon “Dame” Dash and Karem “Biggs” Burke started Roc-A-Fella Records as an independent label in 1995. A year late, they signed a distribution deal with Priority Records and Jay released his debut album Reasonable Doubt in 1996. While at the time the album do okay, it is considered by many, one of Jay-Z’s best albums and one of the best rap albums of all time.\n\nIn 1997, Roc-A-Fella signed a new distribution deal with Def Jam, where Jay-Z released his next three albums: In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 in 1997, Vol. 2… Hard Knock Life in 1998 and Vol. 3… Life and Times of S. Carter in 1999. All three of those albums included hit records that raised the popularity of Jay-Z as one of the biggest rappers in the country.\n\nAdvertised as his final album before retiring, Jay-Z released The Black Album in 2003. Like Michael Jordan, we all know now that Jay did not stay retired for long and eventually returned to music. He even held a concert called the “retirement party” at Madison Square Garden. A year later, Jay-Z became president of Def Jam Records, leading his former business partners Dame Dash and Biggs to sell their remaining interests in Roc-A-Fella Records."
