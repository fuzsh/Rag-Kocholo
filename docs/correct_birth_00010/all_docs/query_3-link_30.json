        "text": "Blue Ivy, who?\n\nJay-Z and Beyoncé initially had a different name picked out for their now-11-year-old daughter.\n\nThe rapper, 53, told Gayle King on the second part of his “CBS Mornings” interview Friday that the preteen was “supposed to be Brooklyn.”\n\nThe moniker, notably, would have referenced the New York City borough where Jay-Z was born and raised.\n\nHowever, the record producer and the “Drunk In Love” singer, 42, called the little one “Blueberry” while she was in the womb.\n\n“You know, it was like a nickname,” he recalled. “It was just natural. We just took the berry off and called her Blue.”\n\nThe songwriters’ eldest child was born in January 2012, with the couple trademarking Blue Ivy’s name the following year.\n\nTwins Sir and Rumi, now 6, joined the family in June 2017, but Jay-Z and Beyoncé have yet to share the inspiration behind the siblings’ monikers.\n\nAlthough the “Bonnie & Clyde” collaborators have kept their youngest children primarily out of the spotlight, Blue appears to be following her parents’ famous footsteps.\n\nShe made headlines earlier this year for joining her mom onstage and showing off her dance moves during Queen Bey’s “Renaissance” tour.\n\n“She wanted to do it,” Jay-Z recalled. “We was like, ‘OK, if this is something you wanna do, you can’t just go out there. You gotta go work with the dancers and go work.'”\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nHe praised Blue, who was “born into a life she didn’t ask for,” for “work[ing] every day” before performing for thousands of fans.\n\nJay-Z noted that Blue now looks to him for fashion advice despite previously not considering him cool.\n\n“She used to be frontin’ on me a little bit,” the Roc Nation creator said. “But [now] I catch her. I catch her in the corner, you know? Now she asks me, you know, if this is cool, if her sneakers [are cool].”"
