        "text": "Happy Hova Day!\n\nHip-hop superstar Jay-Z’s birthday would take on new meaning in the Big Apple if new City Council legislation passes.\n\n“The global phenomenon that is Jay-Z – born Shawn Carter – is widely known as an artist, mogul, husband and father, wealth builder and supporter of economic development and community causes,” Councilwoman Farah Louis (D-Brooklyn) fawned while introducing her resolution earlier this month.\n\n“Dec. 4 as Jay-Z Day announces to the world how this Brooklyn son can be all things . . . Establishing an annual celebration to recognize a homegrown hero while proclaiming our municipal support is fitting.”\n\nThe 54-year-old “Hard Knock Life” singer, who grew up in Bedford-Stuyvesant’s Marcy Houses, has truly backed up his legendary line: “I’m not a businessman, I’m a business, man.”\n\nHe parlayed his musical talents into the urban clothing line Rocawear, the upscale sports bar chain 40/40 Club, and the Roc Nation Sports agency.\n\nHe famously also served as the public face of the Nets during their move from New Jersey to Brooklyn, typically showing up to games with his equally famous songstress wife Beyoncé.\n\nJay-Z owned a small stake in both the Nets and Brooklyn’s Barclays Center but sold it in 2013 so that Roc Nation could represent NBA players.\n\nReps for Jay-Z did not return messages."
