        "text": "For Jay-Z, there's nothing like watching 11-year-old daughter Blue Ivy Carter perform on Beyoncé's Renaissance Tour.\n\n\"What makes me super proud and, like, I still get goosebumps (is) just seeing her walk on stage – just because Blue's been born into this world that she didn't ask (for). She's been born into a life she didn't ask for,\" Jay-Z told Gayle King in a recent interview in New York.\n\nHe went on, \"Since she was born, she's been in, like, scrutiny and (the) public eye and everyone having an opinion of, even a little girl, how she keeps her hair. So for her, to be on that stage and reclaim her power, and the song is called 'My Power,' you can't write a better script.\"\n\nIn the primetime special \"Jay-Z & Gayle King: Brooklyn’s Own,\" which aired Tuesday night, the hip-hop legend and music mogul shared more details about family life with the Carters.\n\nJay-Z reveals how 'nervous' and 'frightened' Blue Ivy was to perform onstage in CBS primetime special\n\nThough Blue Ivy seems to be in her element dancing for stadiums full of fans across the world, her dad knows better. \"I know her, so I know how nervous she was. I know how frightened she was\" performing in front of 80,000 people, Jay-Z said.\n\nAnd she put in the work, too.\n\n\"She wanted to do it the first night, and we was like, OK, if this is something you wanna do, you can't just go out there,\" he said. \"You gotta go work with the dancers and go work. And she worked every day and (I) watched her work hard.\"\n\nThe hourlong special comprised footage from \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King’s interview with Jay-Z at the Brooklyn Public Library, which aired last month.\n\nTheir conversation was wide-ranging and included topics such as his music and business career path, his criminal justice reform work and a tour of the library's \"The Book of HOV\" exhibit.\n\nJay-Z wants to cut his hair – but his family won't let him\n\nSomething that his and Beyoncé's kids – Blue Ivy, Rumi and Sir Carter – have a strong opinion about, he said, is his hair. Though he believes he looks best with a Caesar cut, his whole family prefers his current look with freeform dreadlocks.\n\n\"Rumi was the last one to sell me out,\" he told King. As he was preparing to cut his hair, Blue begged, \"No, dad, you can't cut your hair! It's part of who you are!\"\n\n\"So they're fighting over this,\" Jay-Z said.\n\nDelving more into life as a father in the portion of his interview with King that aired in October, Jay-Z mulled over whether his kids would say he's a \"cool dad.\"\n\n\"Blue, she be frontin' on me a little bit, but I catch her,\" he said. \"Now, she asks me if this is cool, her sneakers or whatever she's wearing now.\"\n\nBlue would sometimes be embarrassed of her Grammy-award-winning father, he said.\n\n\"There was a time where she was like 'Dad!'\" he said, mimicking her by covering his face. \"I was like, 'I'm cool. I don't know what you're saying.'\"\n\nOur critic's Renaissance Tour review: Beyoncé raises – and clears – her own ambitious bar\n\nJay-Z weighs in: Take $500,000 or have lunch with him?\n\nThe music mogul also weighed in on the infamous online debate on whether to take $500,000 or have lunch with Jay-Z.\n\nThe rapper's advice? Take the money. Any wisdom one could get over a meal with the business mogul is available in his lyrics, he said.\n\n\"I wouldn't tell you to cut a bad deal. Like, take the $500,000, go buy some albums, and listen to the albums,\" he said. \"It's all there. If you piece it together and really listen to the music for the words, well, what it is, it's all there.\n\n\"You've got all that in the music for $10.99,\" he told King.\n\nJay-Z also discussed Reform Alliance, the nonprofit he shares with investors like Robert Kraft and Meek Mill.\n\n\"The idea of taking that platform and reproducing it for others or doing something like Reform ... I think I derive the most joy from that,\" he said.\n\nThe \"Empire State of Mind\" rapper and entrepreneur also told King that what matters most to him is \"helping out\" his culture and other people of color. \"Being a beacon and helping out my culture, people of color, I pull the most satisfaction from that,\" he said.\n\n'Feeling loved is the most important': Jay-Z shares rare reflection on parenting, family life\n\n'The Book of Hov' exhibit at Brooklyn Public Library pays homage to Jay-Z's career\n\nBorn Shawn Carter and raised in Brooklyn's Marcy Projects, Jay-Z's company, Roc Nation, teamed up with the Brooklyn Public Library this summer to put on \"The Book of HOV\" and also offer 13 library cards that pay homage to his \"iconic career, unprecedented cultural contributions and illustrious legacy.\"\n\nThe exhibit, which opened July 14 and is free to the public during the library's hours, is a \"tribute to Carter's global impact as a musician, entrepreneur, philanthropist and disruptor,\" according to a July press release. Originally slated to run until October, the exhibit will now run until Dec. 4, Jay-Z's birthday, according to BPL's website.\n\nThe exhibition includes \"iconic artifacts, awards, rare photos, legendary magazine covers and more that span 27 years since Carter released his illustrious debut album, 'Reasonable Doubt,' in 1996,\" according to a press release.\n\nIn addition, \"the goal of the entire display is to showcase an enlightening and educational look into Carter's ascension from the Marcy Projects in Brooklyn, N.Y. to an international phenomenon.\"\n\nAs well as a replica of Baseline Studios, where Jay-Z recorded albums such as \"The Blueprint\" and \"The Black Album,\" the installation also includes highlights from his entrepreneurial and philanthropic efforts."
