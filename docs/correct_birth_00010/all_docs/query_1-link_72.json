The price? $190 million — the largest sum in California history.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyoncé came from humble beginnings in Houston.\n\nBeyoncé's rise to stardom began in a modest, middle-class neighborhood within Houston's Third Ward district.\n\n2414 Rosedale Street has three bedrooms and three bathrooms over 8,640 square feet, according to the listing from 2019.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, the Knowles family purchased the home in 1982, not long after Beyoncé was born, and moved out when she was about 5 years old.\n\nIn 2019, the home was listed for sale for about $500,000. Because Texas is a non-disclosure state, it's unclear how much it sold for.\n\nBeyoncé was spotted taking photos of the home in September 2023 during the Houston stop of her Renaissance World Tour, the AP reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe couple is linked to a Tribeca penthouse, where they married in 2008.\n\nIn September 2004, Jay-Z, who voiced his aspirations for success in his hit rap song 'Big Pimpin', made one of his first big real-estate purchases.\n\nThe native New Yorker, who was about 34 at the time, spent $6.85 million on a penthouse at 195 Hudson Street in the downtown Manhattan neighborhood of Tribeca.\n\nAccording to Architectural Digest, the 8,000-square-foot apartment has an additional 3,000 square feet of outdoor terrace. It's in a 27-unit building that was converted from a 1929 brick warehouse in 1999, according to real-estate listings site StreetEasy.\n\nIn 2008, he and Beyoncé held an intimate wedding ceremony at the penthouse, with only 40 people in attendance. Architectural Digest reported in 2024 that the couple is believed to still own the home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyoncé and Jay-Z are also linked to a home in New Orleans that used to be a church.\n\nLouisiana is where Beyoncé's mother — fashion designer Tina Knowles — was born and raised.\n\nIn 2015, multiple news outlets reported that the couple purchased a Spanish Baroque-style mansion in New Orleans' Garden District. The house on Harmony Street, locally known as La Casa de Castille, was listed for $2.6 million at the time of its purchase, but the exact sales purchase price remains a mystery due to Louisiana's non-disclosure policy.\n\nNOLA.com outlined how the church became a residence: In the 1920s, Westminster Presbyterian Church built it, and 38 members of the Ku Klux Klan allegedly attended its groundbreaking ceremony. Following years of vacancy, dancer Harvey Hysell transformed it into a ballet theater in 1977. Finally, in the early 2000s, it was purchased and extensively renovated.\n\nAccording to the old Zillow listing, it still has 16-foot ceilings and stained-glass windows. The 13,300-square-foot, three-story property, made up of a main residence and three separate apartments, has a total of seven bedrooms, eight bathrooms, and a rooftop garden.\n\nIn 2021, a fire affected the property, and it was listed for sale shortly after at $3.5 million, later increased to $4.45 million, TMZ reported. However, it was later taken off the market, according to Architectural Digest.\n\nWhen looking on Google Maps' Street View, La Casa de Castille is blurred, suggesting that it is indeed owned by the notoriously private couple.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyoncé and Jay-Z own a home in the Hamptons, a historically posh vacation destination for New Yorkers.\n\nBeyoncé and Jay-Z clearly have a New York state of mind when it comes to real estate.\n\nIn addition to the Tribeca penthouse and a midtown Manhattan condo — which Beyoncé owned prior to their marriage and sold in 2017 for $10 million — they have rented and owned several homes in the Hamptons.\n\nIn 2012, the year their daughter Blue Ivy was born, they leased a 31,000-square-foot summer-vacation home in Bridgehampton for $400,000 a month.\n\nBeyond the standard luxuries expected in such properties, such as a bar, a pool, and a tennis court, that mansion also featured a bowling alley, rock climbing wall, and skateboard half-pipe, according to Architectural Digest.\n\nIn 2017, the couple purchased the Pond House in East Hampton for a staggering $26 million.\n\nLocated at 81 Briar Patch Road, the 12,000-square-foot mansion with seven bedrooms, seven bathrooms, and a separate cottage was designed by architect Stanford White, whose work includes the arch in Washington Square Park.\n\nThe couple's waterfront property sits across from Georgica Pond and a 17-acre meadow preserve, offering unparalleled privacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2023, Beyoncé and Jay-Z bought the most expensive home in California history.\n\nIn 2023, Beyoncé and Jay-Z purchased a 40,000-square-foot mansion in Malibu's exclusive Paradise Cove neighborhood, which some have dubbed \"Billionaires' Beach,\" for a staggering $190 million.\n\nThe sale set a record for the most expensive property transaction in California and was also the largest residential sale nationwide that year.\n\nThe estate's record-breaking price tag is attributed in part to its high-pedigree design and extensive array of amenities.\n\nAccording to Architectural Digest, it took the previous owners, art collectors Bill Bell and his wife Maria Bell, a decade and a half to complete the building.\n\nSpanning over 8 acres, the compound is designed in a Japanese minimalist style, which its architect Tadao Ando is known for.\n\nAccording to E! News, the main residence has 8 bedrooms and 11 bathrooms, while its living room features custom-made fixtures imported from Italy. Outside, there are four separate pools, a bar, and a private helipad.\n\nRead next\n\nBeyonce Real Estate\n\nAdvertisement"
