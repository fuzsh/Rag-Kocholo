        "text": "The rumor mill has been silenced: Beyoncé actually was pregnant, and the baby was not born last week. Instead, hip-hop power couple Beyoncé and Jay-Z welcomed a baby girl, reportedly named Blue Ivy Carter, Saturday night at New York City’s Lenox Hill Hospital.\n\nAccording to E! News, Beyoncé gave birth via scheduled C-section, though many sources noted that Bey’s baby came more than a month before her expected February due date. The New York Daily News notes that Jay-Z and Beyoncé tried to tightly control their babeyoncé’s arrival, renting out an entire floor of Lenox Hill Hospital on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, taping over security cameras and forcing employees to turn in their cell phones.\n\n(LIST: Top 10 Wacky Celebrity Baby Names)\n\nMost certainly, photos of little Blue Ivy Carter are sure to garner millions, as the baby has been anxiously expected since the moment Beyoncé announced her pregnancy – not-so-subtly displaying her baby bump on stage at the MTV Video Music Awards in August. Since then, fans have speculated widely about the first Carter offspring, predicting names, genders and shower gifts – and breaking Twitter records while doing so. But it turned out to be the couple’s close friends who gave away the tiny details of the tiny one. Kelly Rowland hinted in recent weeks that the baby would be a girl.\n\nAnd upon confirmation from Jay-Z to his friends, the celebrity congratulations to the proud new parents came flooding in. Russell Simmons and Gwyneth Paltrow, among others, tweeted gleefully, but it was Rihanna who put it best:\n\n[tweet https://twitter.com/rihanna/status/155896457487073281%5D\n\nIndeed, we should expect no shortage of spoiling for baby Blue Ivy. Suri Cruise, watch out: you might be getting a run for your money."
