        "text": "As the opening chords of \"Holy Grail\" rang out across Vanderbilt Stadium Thursday night, a four-story, football-field-wide video screen suddenly split apart.\n\nThere, in the center, stood music's most powerful couple — Beyonce and Jay-Z — hand-in-hand, basking in a fair amount of pandemonium.\n\nA few years ago, it was a sight some might not have expected to see.\n\nFor one thing, this was Nashville — where, until Thursday night, no rapper had ever headlined a stadium concert. And for another, the artists in question were a couple whose relationship hit an infamously rocky patch in recent years. But the Carters, of course, came out the other side intact, and with two critically hailed albums in tow.\n\nOn her acclaimed 2016 opus “Lemonade,” Beyonce exposed her husband’s infidelity and chronicled her road to forgiveness.\n\nA year later, Jay-Z admitted his faults and let his guard down on “4:44,” proclaiming, “you can’t heal what you never reveal.”\n\nNow, in 2018, their \"On The Run II\" tour seems to be about celebrating their survival, reveling in their chemistry and embracing their roles as aspirational figures. And it all makes for a staggering spectacle.\n\nThe space in the middle of that video screen also housed a four-story, 4X5 grid of boxes, each one occupied by guitarists, horn players, percussionists, even multiple contortionists(!) like a musical \"Hollywood Squares.\"\n\nBeyonce and Jay-Z each had their own field-long catwalk to travel down throughout the show (often trailed by an incredible crew of dancers). For the final stretch, a piece of center stage essentially lifted off, spewing fog underneath as it rolled along a track to the other end of the field.\n\nRelated: Beyonce reveals twins were born via emergency C-section in Sept. Vogue story\n\nThrow in the best evening of weather Nashville's seen all summer, and it all seemed to light a fire under this crowd, which both performers took note of.\n\n\"Oh, y’all crazy out here,\" Jay-Z said after the audience shouted along to his \"F***withmeyouknowigotit\"\n\n\"This is why they call it Music City, huh?\"\n\nHe and his wife tore through more than 40 songs in Nashville, taking turns and tag-teaming on one another's hits. There was next to no dead air in the 2½ hour set, as one high-energy tune gave way to another, from \"Drunk In Love\" to \"Dirt Off Your Shoulder,\" \"Big Pimpin\" and \"Countdown.\"\n\nSurprisingly, it ended up getting just a little exhausting — enough so that when Beyonce sat down at the edge of the catwalk to belt her early ballad, \"Resentment,\" it earned one of the most prolonged cheers of the night.\n\nThe best moments, in fact, were the ones these two shared. Their collaborative hits \"Crazy in Love,\" \"Deja Vu,\" and their new joint album \"Everything is Love\" all work especially in concert, and are only bolstered by the fact that both of them still seem to derive a lot of joy from watching the other do their thing.\n\nThe crowd, in turn, couldn't get enough of watching them interact — both on video (with home movie footage of them with their three children, including their rarely seen twins) and on stage, like the well-timed embrace that came with the penultimate song, \"Young Forever.\"\n\nThe show was just the third concert to be held at Vanderbilt Stadium this decade, following U2 in 2011 and Luke Bryan in 2015.\n\nIn recent years, most Nashville stadium concerts have taken place at The Tennessee Titans' Nissan Stadium — but that venue has been claimed for the week, as crews continue to set up for Taylor Swift's massive \"Reputation\" concert on Saturday.\n\nThe pair’s presence was felt well beyond the walls of the stadium — West End isn’t an area terribly suited to host a stadium concert, with scant parking to be found on side streets and small lots. The garage next door to the stadium was charging $40 per car, while businesses from Wendy’s to Barnes & Noble stood close guard over their parking spaces.\n\n\"We love it here in Nashville,\" Beyonce told fans just before they spilled back into the street. \"Very happy to be back...The energy, it lifted us up.\""
