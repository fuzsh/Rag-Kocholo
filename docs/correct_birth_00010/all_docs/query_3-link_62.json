        "text": "Perhaps the ultimate A-list power couple, Beyoncé and Jay-Z have a reported net worth of over $2.6 billion (£2bn). The talented duo has accumulated an eye-watering number of awards between them during their chart-topping music careers, as well as a roster of successful businesses.\n\nWith some serious cash in their wallets, it's no surprise that they've picked up some pretty incredible real estate along the way too. They broke the record by purchasing the most expensive property in California in May 2023, costing them an eye-watering $200 million (£157m). But they probably haven't had much time to settle in over the past year...Click or scroll on to take a closer look at their remarkable lives and homes...\n\nBeyoncé has been breaking some records of her own on her Renaissance World Tour, which came to a close in October 2023. The superstar’s ninth concert tour pulled in $579 million (£456m), say reports, making it the highest-grossing tour by a female artist in history, and the seventh highest-grossing tour overall.\n\nAnd as if that wasn’t remarkable enough, Beyoncé delighted fans by getting her 11-year-old daughter Blue Ivy to join her on stage at several of the tour’s concerts. She’s rocking some spangled camouflage with her mum for this show in Atlanta!\n\nTapping into her Texas upbringing, she became the first black woman to reach the US No 1 spot with a country song with her single 'Texas Hold ‘Em', topping both the Hot Country Songs chart and the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs List, reports The Guardian.\n\nHer first country album Cowboy Carter meanwhile, pays tribute to her husband Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Corey Carter, and even includes a cover version of Dolly Parton’s iconic hit 'Jolene'. All that AND she's launched her first haircare brand Cécred.\n\nMeanwhile husband Jay-Z has been making his own headlines. The rapper attended the 2024 Super Bowl in 2024 with his daughters Blue Ivy and Rumi, but his role goes way beyond that of mere spectator, say reports. In fact, the star’s company Roc Nation produces the Super Bowl’s halftime show, and won an Emmy in 2022.\n\nJay-Z owns a host of other companies and sold his own liquor brand, luxury cognac D’Usse to Bacardi for $750 million (£589m) in 2023. No wonder he and Bey were able to buy the some of the most valuable real estate in California.\n\nAccording to Forbes, the A-list couple snapped up their new home in May 2023 for the staggering price tag of $200 million (£157m). The most expensive home ever sold in California, it's also the second-most expensive property deal in US history.\n\nYet, remarkably, the pair may have secured themselves something of a discount. While the home was never strictly on the open market, rumour has it the seller was originally asking $295 million (£230m) for the architectural gem.\n\nImages of the home are hard to come by, but these shots of the Brutalist mega-mansion's grounds from Pacific Pervious Concrete, who carried out work on the residence in 2015, offer a glimpse inside the fortified compound.\n\nPerched on the edge of a bluff in Malibu, the home has unimpeded views of the glittering Pacific Ocean, no doubt a key motivator behind its sky-high sale price. The 40,000-square-foot residence sprawls across eight acres, featuring direct access to one of Malibu’s most picturesque beaches, as well as a vast swimming pool.\n\nThe mansion’s location isn’t its only selling point. The iconic structure is one of the few American residences designed by the revered Japanese architect Tadao Ando. The home is steeped in his signature concrete monolithic style and includes an ornamental reflecting pool, a feature that has become one of the architect’s calling cards.\n\nKnown as the Bell House, the residence was commissioned by Bill and Maria Bell in the late 1990s and took over 15 years to complete. The couple are among the world’s most prolific art collectors, and the house was commissioned in part to house their large modern art collection, which includes works by the likes of Andy Warhol and Damien Hirst, say reports.\n\nOver the years, the mansion has drawn both praise and criticism from the public, with some deeming it an inspired work of art, and others drawing comparisons with a James Bond villain’s lair.\n\nWhatever side of the line you fall on, there's no denying that the structure's scale is impressive. From exposed block concrete walls to swathes of glass and crisp modernist lines, it's one of California's most spectacular Brutalist residences.\n\nPictured here is an expansive terrace that overlooks the mansion's beautifully manicured lawns and the ocean beyond.\n\nThe home's upkeep has been meticulous over the years. This image was taken following the installation of some 22,500 square feet of polished concrete across the grounds.\n\nDespite the residence's rare architectural heritage, it isn't the only Ando masterpiece in the area. Back in 2021, embattled rapper Kanye West purchased another Malibu residence designed by the famed architect, which shares similar characteristics to Beyoncé and Jay-Z's new home, albeit on a smaller scale.\n\nHaving tied the knot in 2008, the famous duo have built up a star-studded property portfolio over the years, including opulent homes in Los Angeles, Malibu, the Hamptons and New York City.\n\nFollowing the birth of twins Sir and Rumi in 2017, the Carter family, including daughter Blue Ivy, who was born in 2012, currently reside in an $88 million (£69m) mega-mansion in Bel Air.\n\nThe couple have come a long way from where they started. Photographed at the 66th Grammy Awards in February 2024, Beyoncé has won 32 Grammys across her remarkable career, more than any other artist.\n\nShe may never have won the prestigious album of the year prize, flagged up by her husband at the ceremony, but she remains the indisputable Queen of Music. So, let’s retrace their property journey and take a tour of some of their amazing houses…\n\nFor Beyoncé Giselle Knowles, born 4 September 1981, it all started in this charming brick house in Houston, Texas. Records suggest that the Knowles family purchased the home in 1986 and lived here until Beyoncé was five years old.\n\nIn 2018, it landed on the real estate market with Keller Williams for $500,000 (£393k), giving keen fans a glimpse into the property where the singer spent her early years. At Chrsitmas 2023 it suffered damage in a fire according to The Guardian but its current owners are safe and it will be renovated.\n\nOffering three bedrooms, two bathrooms and large airy living spaces, the home certainly looks like it was a comfortable place to grow up.\n\nWhile we're sure the house has changed a lot since Bey lived here, it's not hard to imagine the budding singer entertaining family and friends in this elegant sitting room.\n\nConstructed in 1946, the celebrity childhood home encompasses 2,938 square feet and has a quaint backyard. Luxury touches include original hardwood floors, a media room and a large master suite with a raised bed platform.\n\nIt was in Houston that the legendary girl group Destiny's Child was formed in 1990 when Knowles was just nine years old. Managed by the star's father, they were originally known as Girl's Tyme and would go on to release five successful albums before eventually going their separate ways.\n\nIt's clear that Bey still has a lot of affection for her old stomping ground and the place where her music career kicked off. In 2016, the Queen herself visited her old neighbourhood, sharing a snap with her loyal Instagram followers.\n\nThe following year, she returned to take part in volunteer work to help local families affected by Hurricane Harvey, proving that the songstress still holds Houston close to her heart.\n\nIn the 2009 hit 'Empire State of Mind', Jay-Z immortalised his former Brooklyn apartment. In the song, the iconic musician sings: \"Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street. Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons whippin' pastry.\"\n\nWith these words, Jay-Z made the property as legendary as he is. It's thought that the rapper lived in apartment 10C at 560 State Street for some years before he got his big break.\n\nRevamped since Jay-Z's days here, the apartment is modern and bright thanks to a thorough refurbishment in 2005. The rapper and native New Yorker, born Shawn Corey Carter, reportedly moved into the 1900s-era building in the late 1990s, around the same time that he founded music label Roc-A-Fella Records with two friends.\n\nIt's been on and off the market a few times since he left and was listed in 2023 for $1.4 million (£1.1m).\n\nSpanning just over 1,000 square feet, the sleek space has two bedrooms and an open-plan living area with a small kitchenette and plenty of space for a lounge and dining zone. The home's biggest selling points, however, are its elegant hardwood floors and airy 10-foot ceilings.\n\nSpeaking to Seventeen in 2008, Beyoncé revealed that the notoriously private couple started dating in the early 2000s when she was 19, so it's conceivable that Queen Bey herself may have even spent time here.\n\nHowever, Jay is adamant that the place wasn't quite so nice when he lived there. In 2012, the musician visited his former apartment and took to the roof to soak up the view.\n\nHis trip down memory lane was captured by Ron Howard in the 2013 documentary Made in America, excerpts of which were shared on YouTube. The rapper revealed that the building was once seen as an undesirable place to live, though its fortunes have clearly since changed.\n\nHaving released her first solo album, Dangerously in Love, in 2003, Bey purchased a condo in Manhattan for $5 million (£3.9m) in 2005, the same year that Destiny's Child called it quits.\n\nIn the sought-after One Beacon Court skyscraper between Lexington and Third Avenue, the high-altitude home is perched on the 44th floor. The 2,669-square-foot corner apartment benefits from mesmerising views across Central Park and the towering landscape of New York City.\n\nWhen she snapped up the condo, Bey had already racked up an incredible nine Grammy Award wins, so no doubt was in need of extra space to display her accolades. Spacious and filled with natural light, the home boasts floor-to-ceiling windows, towering 11-foot ceilings and state-of-the-art smart home systems.\n\nEvery room has been finished immaculately thanks to Parisian interior designer Jacques Grange, from the solid panel doors to the contemporary mouldings and recessed lighting.\n\nDuring her time here, Bey would also have had access to private courtyard parking, a 24-hour doorman, personalised concierge service, a fitness centre and a valet.\n\nIt's hardly surprising then that Beyoncé held on to the condo for quite some time, only parting with it in 2017, when she placed the home on the market for $10 million (£7.9m). Unsurprisingly, it sold in just 11 days for the full asking price.\n\nJay-Z's next New York City real estate purchase in 2004, the year the pair made their red carpet debut together at the MTV VMAs, would turn out to be a pretty important place for the guarded pair.\n\nThe plush Tribeca penthouse at 195 Hudson Street served as Beyoncé and Jay-Z's intimate wedding venue when they tied the knot in 2008. A small affair with only close friends and family, phones were reportedly banned to ensure the couple's special day was kept private.\n\nA year before their nuptials in 2007, Jay-Z began renting this 76th-floor penthouse in the Time Warner Center on New York's Upper West Side.\n\nHis music career was hitting stratospheric heights, with six Grammy Awards under his belt, including two for 'Crazy in Love', his collaboration with Beyoncé.\n\nHe leased the apartment for a number of years at a rumoured cost of $40,000 (£32k) per month, before it was sold by Douglas Elliman Real Estate for a mind-boggling $31 million (£24.1m).\n\nThe master suite is a striking space for unwinding, thanks to its king-sized bed, living area and ensuite bathroom.\n\nThe apartment also offers a stylish office with stunning river views, and a spacious kitchen with a dining zone and marble finishes.\n\nYet once he was married, Jay-Z decided it was time to purchase something a little more family-friendly...\n\nAfter renting a Miami Beach compound following their wedding, Beyoncé and Jay-Z are rumoured to have made a rather unusual purchase in 2015, three years after the birth of their daughter, Blue Ivy.\n\nThe unusual property, which can be found in the Garden District of New Orleans, went on the market in September 2013 and sat there until the Carters placed their bid. According to city records, Sugarcane Park LLC, a limited company linked to Beyoncé's mother, acquired the home for just $100 (£79).\n\nOriginally listed for just shy of $3.5 million (£2.7m), there was an unusual price increase in August 2021 by $1 million (£788k), until it was mysteriously removed from the market months later in October.\n\nAccording to reports, the property is still thought to be owned by the couple and is valued at around $2.3 million (£1.8m).\n\nThe Carters decided to expand their family, as well as their property portfolio in 2017. Hunting for the perfect place to spend her pregnancy, Beyoncé settled on a jaw-dropping coastal villa on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, known as La Villa Contenta.\n\nBey and Jay-Z rented the residence throughout the summer, when they welcomed their twins, Rumi and Sir, into the world, forking out a reported $400,000 (£314k) a month for the privilege.\n\nThe home's Romanesque pool pavilion is otherworldly. With classical friezes, hand-painted murals, dramatic chandeliers, onyx panelling and archways adorned with glistening seashells, it's the perfect spot for a soak.\n\nThe property was most recently listed for $54.5 million (£43m) with Christies International Real Estate and is available to rent for $200,000 (£157k) a month. Now that's a bargain compared to what Beyoncé and Jay-Z are said to have paid.\n\nIn 2014, the couple began searching for a permanent home but found the process surprisingly hard, despite their big budget.\n\nBey and Jay tried to snap up a handful of different properties but lost out each time. After struggling to purchase a house of their own, they began renting this spectacular mansion for a reported $200,000 (£158k) a month.\n\nEverywhere you look you'll find jaw-dropping living spaces, decorated with earthy colours, floor-to-ceiling glass and soaring 20-foot ceilings.\n\nThere's an infinity pool, a wine cellar, two libraries, a catering kitchen, a 75-foot-long art gallery, a home theatre and a tennis court.\n\nThe mega-mansion also happens to be a short walk away from the Playboy Mansion and even featured in the 1998 movie, The Big Lebowski.\n\nBeyoncé and Jay-Z are said to have used the property as their base when not on tour, but in May 2014 the house hit the market for a cool $45 million (£35.5m).\n\nAt the time, it was one of the most expensive houses for sale in all of Los Angeles and when it sold in 2015, the family were reportedly given just 60 days to find somewhere else to live.\n\nExpansive patios, numerous sunbathing decks and four swimming pools help make up the home's almost two-acre garden.\n\nThe sale of the 30,000-square-foot residence was among LA’s most expensive property transactions of 2017. According to the Los Angeles Times, the couple took out a $52.8 million (£41.5m) mortgage to buy the pad, which equates to $252,000 (£198k) a month in repayments, over a 30-year period.\n\nBack in 2019, an investigation by the Los Angeles Times also found that the couple were paying $1 million (£786k) per year in property taxes on the Bel Air mansion.\n\nNot that the King and Queen of music need to worry. They are the richest celebrity couple in the world. So it's no surprise that their estate also includes a full basketball court, a spa, and standalone staff quarters, as well as a secure garage for up to 15 vehicles.\n\nOffering a total of seven bedrooms, the home's master suite is the perfect sanctuary and features an antique French stone fireplace, his-and-hers dressing rooms and bathrooms, walk-in closets and a private terrace.\n\nThere’s also a screening room, playroom and three-car garage. Outside, you’ll find an infinity-edged pool, a wraparound terrace with an outdoor kitchen and a detached 1,800-square-foot guesthouse.\n\nThe sprawling celebrity holiday home, which spans 12,000 square feet, is clearly a favourite of Beyoncé's, as not long after buying the property, she took to Instagram to show off the family's new digs. Pictured here on the mansion's deck, we have a feeling it'll be a much-loved family holiday retreat for years to come.\n\nIn 2020, Beyoncé released a musical film and visual album entitled Black Is King in collaboration with Disney+.\n\nFor the project, the singer decided to rent a property that would do her music justice. For the job, she chose the Beverly House, a landmark Hollywood property, which has appeared in iconic films including the Godfather and The Bodyguard, and which can be found just three blocks away from Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Mediterranean Revival-style mansion was built in 1926 and boasts 50,000 square feet of inside space.\n\nEvery single room is overflowing with mesmerising design details, such as dramatic arched ceilings, decorative panelled walls and gilded furnishings. So it's no real wonder that Bey chose the pad as the backdrop for her visual album.\n\nThe spectacular spread features 18 bedrooms, 29 bathrooms, a two-storey library, two screening rooms, a commercial-grade kitchen, a billiard room with a hand-carved stone fireplace and a formal living room finished with a painted ceiling.\n\nThere's also an 82-foot-long hallway, which can be spotted in numerous scenes in the visual album. Elsewhere, there's an Olympic-sized swimming pool and a floodlit tennis court.\n\nThe pad is one of America's most expensive homes.\n\nIn 2016, it made waves when it hit the market for a cool $195 million (£155m). After struggling to find a buyer, the property was relisted in 2020 for $125 million (£99m), before eventually selling at auction in October 2021 at a reduced price of $63.1 million (£49m).\n\nIf you've dreamt of decorating your home like Beyoncé and Jay-Z but only have a fraction of their billion-dollar budget, you might be in luck.\n\nAs reported by TMZ, several items from the iconic couple's former rental home in Holmby Hills came up for sale on eBay in 2023. The man behind Eric’s Architectural Salvage LA came by the items after the house was reportedly sold for over $55 million (£43.5m) and completely renovated in 2017, which is when these treasures fell into his lap.\n\nThe most unusual item up for grabs was this rather elegant bidet. The white porcelain bathroom fixture featured Sherle Wagner hardware, which often comes gold-plated. The seller was quick to point out that he wasn't sure if these particular knobs were coated in the precious metal, but believed it was \"highly possible.\" If so, it would more than justify the $2,400 (£1.9k) price.\n\nOther lots included light fixtures, windows still in their frames and a pair of arched French doors.\n\nThe items all came from this home in LA's exclusive Holmby Hills neighbourhood, which Beyoncé and Jay-Z rented in 2015 after they were given a month's notice to leave the home they were renting previously.\n\nIt was once the home of former Dodgers owners, Frank and Jamie McCourt, who sold it in 2014 for $45 million (£35.7m). The new owners rented it out to music's most powerful couple for a year and sold it shortly after they moved out.\n\nA magnificent mansion it may have been, but it proved just a pit-stop on the power couple's spectacular property race to the top.\n\nThe pair have gone on to bigger and better things since and we can't wait to see where they gravitate next!\n\nLoved this?
