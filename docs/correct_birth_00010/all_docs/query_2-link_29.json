        "text": "Shawn Corey Carter (born December 4, 1969), professionally known as Jay-Z, is an American rapper, record producer, and entrepreneur. He is regarded as one of the most influential hip-hop artists.[1]\n\nLil Wayne has expressed admiration for Jay-Z. He even has a tattoo of \"Lucky Me\" on his neck, naming it to be his \"favorite song of all,\" along with a verse tattooed on his leg.[2]\n\nBackground[]\n\nIn 2004, Wayne was in a bidding war between record labels, where he was offered a deal from Def Jam, Jay-Z being president at the time. Wayne decided to resign to Cash Money Records, explaining to MTV News, \"It was very very tough. But you know, I'm a loyal dude, I stick with the fam. But I hope we can do something in the future with my fam and his fam.\" Jay recalled this moment to The Breakfast Club, \"The truth is after I had a meeting with Wayne—I had a relationship with Baby, when I used to go to New Orleans I would meet up with him. So, I felt it was only right to call him. I called him out of respect like 'Yo, I was talking to Wayne. Just to let you know. Boom boom boom.'\"\n\nIn 2006, there was talk of who was the king of hip hop between the two artists. Wayne told Complex, \"I'm better than [Jay-Z]. I don't like what he's saying about how he had to come back because hip-hop's dead and we need him. What the fuck do you mean? If anything it's reborn, so he's probably having a problem with that. You left on a good note, and all of the artists were saying, 'Yo, this is Jay's house. He's the best.' Now he comes back and still thinks it's his house. It's not your house anymore, and I'm better than you.\" He later apologized for his comments the following year in a XXL cover story, saying, \"I wanna apologize to Jay and his family and friends, because I was asked that question and they put it in there like I was just feeling like, 'Oh, you know what, n***a? I'm better than Jay!' They came at me like, 'So you say you're the best. Can you say that you're better than everybody? Would you say you're better than Jay?' I was like, 'Yeah, n***a, I'm better than everybody!' But I'd like to throw that apology out there 'cause of whatever trouble I caused, I ain't want that to happen.\"\n\nJay-Z used his guest feature on T.I.'s \"Watch What You Say to Me\" (July 2007) to retort, 'I hear you baiting me lately, I been doing my best just to stay hater free, still watch what you say to me / Sooner or later I take you up on your offer and put you all in your place like I'm replacing your father / You talking to the author the architect of The Blueprint / My DNA in your music, motherfucka you stupid?' Despite these incidents, the two collaborated on \"Hello Brooklyn 2.0\" (November 2007). Wayne told MTV News, \"Everybody in the world knows how I feel about Jay… he's the king, utmost respect.\" The two worked on the song \"Mr. Carter\" for Wayne's mixtape, Tha Carter III (June 2008).\n\nIn October 2009, Birdman claimed Wayne was richer than Jay, declaring, \"I don't think [Jay Z] is the number one emcee in no kind of way. Wayne's the best. He do the most and he make the most money. I don't think no n***a in the business make more money than us. How can you be the best if you don't make the most money? Lyrically, come on man, be for real, can't nobody fuck with Wayne… If you number one and you ain't getting no money it don't mean nothing.\"\n\nDespite this, on The Blueprint 3's \"A Star Is Born,\" Jay gave a shout-out: 'Wayne's scorching, I'll applaud him / If he keeps going, pass the torch to him.' Due to Birdman's statement, Jay fired back on \"H.A.M.\" (January 2011), 'I'm like, really half-a-billy n***a, really?' / You got baby money.\" Wayne told MTV in March 2011, \"I wouldn't make it a competition, because actually, the subject that he's talking about in that line, I can't box with the god. I'd be the first one to tell you that, given my wit, and the type of person that I am, I'd capitalize and I'd play off of it.\"\n\nNevertheless, Wayne took shots in defense of Birdman at Jay-Z on \"It's Good\": 'Talkin' 'bout Baby money? / I got your baby money / Kidnap your bitch get that how much you love your lady money / I know you fake, n***a / Pressure breaks, n***a / I'll take you out, that's a date n***a.' He explained to Vibe, \"I know there won't be any repercussions behind what I did. I know for a fact music is about perception. You can't do anything but perceive what you hear. I know that for a fact. So I can't ever be upset about someone's reaction. I'm not going to say I don't know what would happen before I even say [something on record]. I do know what will happen. I'm aware of it. But it is what it is.\" Jay noted of the diss, \"That's sport. That's rap music. Nothing is going to change. Only thing that changes is the participants.\"[3]\n\nIn July 2013, Jay returned in \"Good Luck with That Bruh,\" 'Wanna kidnap wifey? Good luck with that bruh/You must gonna hide your whole family, what you think we wearing black for?'\n\nOn June 3, 2015, it was announced of Wayne being made co-owner of music streaming service Tidal. He would go on to say in 2017 that he was \"part of the Roc Nation family.\"[4]\n\nDiscography[]\n\nSong Year Album \"Hello Brooklyn 2.0\"\n\n(Jay-Z featuring Lil Wayne) 2007 American Gangster \"Swagga Like Us\"\n\n(Jay-Z and T.I. featuring Kanye West and Lil Wayne) 2008 Paper Trail \"Mr. Carter\"\n\n(Lil Wayne featuring Jay-Z) Tha Carter III \"God Did\"\n\n(DJ Khaled featuring Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, Jay-Z, John Legend and Fridayy) 2022 God Did\n\nOther credits\n\nSong Year Artist Contribution Album \"This Shit Right Here\"\n\n(Swizz Beatz featuring Lil Wayne) 2023 Swizz Beatz Writer Hip Hop 50, Vol. 2\n\nGallery[]"
