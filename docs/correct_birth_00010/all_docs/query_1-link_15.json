        "text": "(born 1969). American rapper and entrepreneur JAY - was one of the most influential figures in hip-hop in the 1990s and early 21st century. In 2008 he married popular recording star Beyoncé. The union made them one of the top-earning couples in the entertainment industry.\n\nShawn Corey Carter was born on December 4, 1969, in Brooklyn, New York. He grew up in Brooklyn’s often dangerous Marcy Projects, where he was raised mainly by his mother. His firsthand experience with illicit drug dealing influenced his lyrics when he began rapping under the stage name Jazzy, soon shortened to Jay-Z. This name may also have been derived from the nearness of the J and Z subway lines to the Marcy Projects. Jay-Z and two friends founded their own company, Roc-a-Fella Records, to release his debut album, Reasonable Doubt (1996). It climbed the Billboard charts, reaching number 23 on the pop chart and number 3 on the rhythm-and-blues chart.\n\nA string of successful albums followed at a rate of at least one per year through 2003. Vol. 2: Hard Knock Life (1998) not only was the first of Jay-Z’s releases to top the Billboard 200 album sales chart but also won a Grammy Award for best rap album. In 2001 Jay-Z pleaded guilty to assault relating to a 1999 nightclub stabbing and received three years’ probation. In 2003, with the release of The Black Album, Jay-Z announced his retirement as a performer. In 2004 he assumed the presidency of Def Jam Recordings, making him one of the most highly placed African American executives in the recording industry at the time.\n\nAfter his retirement from performing, Jay-Z stayed remarkably active in music. He collaborated with the rock group Linkin Park in 2004 and appeared as a guest vocalist on the recordings of numerous other artists, including Kanye West and Beyoncé. Jay-Z developed a large portfolio of business ventures and investments, including Roc-a-Fella Films and a clothing line. He also had a stake in the New Jersey Nets of the National Basketball Association (NBA), which he later helped to relocate to Brooklyn. Jay-Z formally returned to recording in 2006 with Kingdom Come. In December 2007 he stepped down as Def Jam president shortly after releasing the album American Gangster.\n\nJay-Z proved that he remained one of rap’s most bankable acts when he embarked on a highly successful tour with singer Mary J. Blige in 2008. The following year he won a Grammy Award for best rap performance for “Swagga Like Us,” a collaboration with T.I., West, and Lil Wayne. That September Jay-Z released The Blueprint 3, which featured guest vocals from Alicia Keys and production by West and Timbaland. The album continued to generate Grammy-winning singles for more than a year. “Run This Town,” a collaboration with Rihanna and West, and “D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune)” were honored in 2010, and “Empire State of Mind,” a collaboration with Keys, and “On to the Next One” scored wins in 2011. Jay-Z continued his streak of Grammy success in 2012, winning best rap performance for “Otis,” a single from Watch the Throne (2011), an ambitious and highly regarded collaboration with West. The following year Jay-Z won three additional Grammy Awards. These were best rap performance and best rap song for “N****s in Paris,” and, along with West and featuring Frank Ocean and the Dream, best rap/sung collaboration for “No Church in the Wild.” In 2010 Jay-Z published a memoir, Decoded.\n\nJay Z—having dropped the hyphen from his name—returned in 2013 with the album Magna Carta Holy Grail, on which he reflects on his massive wealth and fame. Although the recording was greeted with mostly lukewarm reviews, it became his 13th release to reach the number one spot on the Billboard 200. It also produced two Grammy wins: one for best rap/sung collaboration for “Holy Grail” and another for best music video for “Suit & Tie.” He received two more Grammys a year later for his collaboration on Beyoncé’s song “Drunk in Love.”\n\nIn 2017 JAY-Z (having capitalized the letters and reinstated the hyphen in his name) released his 13th studio solo album, 4:44. It was, in part, a response to Beyoncé’s Lemonade (2016), on which she accused her husband of adultery. He admitted to infidelity on various tracks and also addressed racism and politics. The couple’s albums were both released exclusively on TIDAL—a subscription-based music streaming service that JAY-Z had acquired in 2015. Also in 2017 JAY-Z became the first rapper to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2018 he and Beyoncé unveiled the collaborative album Everything Is Love, for which they won the Grammy for best urban contemporary album."
