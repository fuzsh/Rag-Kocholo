        "text": "Shawn Corey Carter, universally known as Jay-Z, was born on December 4, 1969, in Brooklyn, New York. Raised primarily by his mother in the Marcy Projects, a housing complex notorious for its challenging environment, Jay-Z's early life was steeped in experiences that would later become recurring themes in his music. His initial foray into the music industry was under the stage name Jazzy, which was eventually shortened to Jay-Z, possibly inspired by the J and Z subway lines near his childhood home.\n\nIn 1996, Jay-Z co-founded Roc-A-Fella Records with Damon Dash and Kareem Burke to release his debut album, \"Reasonable Doubt.\" The album was a commercial success, selling over a million copies in the United States alone. This marked the beginning of an illustrious career that would make him one of the most influential figures in hip-hop and beyond.\n\nJay-Z's subsequent albums, including \"Vol. 2: Hard Knock Life\" (1998) and \"The Blueprint\" (2001), not only topped the charts but also won him critical acclaim and several Grammy Awards. Despite facing legal issues related to a 1999 nightclub stabbing, his career trajectory remained largely unaffected. In 2003, he released \"The Black Album\" and announced his retirement as a performer, only to return to music shortly thereafter.\n\nIn 2004, Jay-Z took on an executive role, becoming the president of Def Jam Recordings. During his tenure, he played a pivotal role in the careers of artists like Rihanna and Ne-Yo. However, he stepped down in 2007 to focus on his own label, Roc Nation, founded in 2008. The label quickly expanded into a full-service entertainment conglomerate, managing artists, athletes, and even venturing into film and television production.\n\nJay-Z's personal life also saw significant milestones during this period. He married BeyoncÃ© Knowles in 2008, and the couple has since become a symbol of both romantic and professional partnership. His business ventures diversified further, including a clothing line, a film production company, and a stake in the Brooklyn Nets NBA team.\n\nMusically, Jay-Z continued to evolve. His 2009 album \"The Blueprint 3\" featured hits like \"Empire State of Mind,\" a tribute to New York City featuring Alicia Keys. His collaboration with Kanye West, \"Watch the Throne\" (2011), was both a commercial and critical success. In 2013, he released \"Magna Carta Holy Grail,\" an album that delved into the complexities of fame and wealth. Despite mixed reviews, it topped the charts and added two more Grammys to his collection.\n\nIn 2017, Jay-Z released \"4:44,\" an album that stood out for its emotional depth and candidness, addressing issues ranging from infidelity to social justice. The album was exclusive to TIDAL, a streaming service Jay-Z acquired in 2015, further showcasing his business acumen.\n\nAs of 2023, Jay-Z's net worth is estimated at $2.5 billion, making him the wealthiest musical artist in the world. His influence extends beyond music and business; he is a cultural icon who has made significant contributions to social justice and philanthropy."
