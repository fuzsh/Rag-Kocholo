        "text": "Guest Introduction\n\nThis post is a guest article written by Paul Martin.Â Paul is an English teacher whoâs from New York and is currently based in Buenos Aires. A music lover, he tries to incorporate music from all different genres into his lesson plans. He teaches with Listen & Learn, which offersÂ English courses in New York,Â in addition to other foreign-language classes all over the world. You can check out hisÂ Facebook pageÂ or email him atÂ paul@listenandlearn.orgÂ for more information.\n\nNow take it away, Paul!\n\nIntroduction\n\nEmpire State of Mind is a single from Jay-Zs 2009 album The Blueprint 3, which was a collaboration (something done together) Jay-Z and singer-songwriter Alicia Keys. The song is a tribute (something that shows respect or affection) to New York City, where both Jay-Z and Alicia Keys are from. New York states nickname is The Empire State, and state of mind is a synonym for attitude or mood. Therefore, Empire State of Mind means New York attitude. The song deals with some of the positive and negative aspects of living in New York, and is filled with useful vocabulary and New York-themed slang.\n\nNow youâre in New York!\n\nConcrete jungles where dreams are made of.\n\nThereâs nothing you canât do!\n\nNew York Slang and Vocabulary\n\nIn Empire State of Mind, Jay-Z and Alicia Keys make many references to various places in New York City. If youre interested in slang from many different cities in the United States, check out this American slang map.\n\nBrooklyn â Brooklyn is one of the five boroughs of New York, where Jay-Z was born.\n\nTribeca â Tribeca is a neighborhood in New York where Jay-Z currently lives. The word Tribeca means Triangle Below Canal Street, which refers to its location within New York.\n\n(Frank) Sinatra â Jay-Z makes a reference to Frank Sinatra, who recorded the wildly popular song New York, New York in 1977.\n\nHarlem â Harlem is a historically and culturally important neighborhood in Manhattan. Itâs the birthplace of the Harlem Renaissance, an artistic and musical movement that gave rise to famous musicians such as Billie Holiday and Louis Armstrong.\n\nThe Knicks and The Nets â Jay-Z makes reference to the New York Knicks and the Brooklyn Nets, which are two professional New York-based basketball teams.\n\nYankees â The Yankees are one of New Yorks two major-league baseball teams (the other is The Mets).\n\nyellow/gypsy/dollar cab â A cab is a casual term for a taxi. In New York, yellow cabs are official, legal taxis. Gypsy cabs are illegal, unlicensed taxis. Dollar cabs refer to a certain type of illegal taxi that operates in Brooklyn at night.\n\nLabor Day Parade â The Labor Day Parade takes place in Crown Heights, Brooklyn every year.\n\nStatue of Liberty â One of New Yorks most famous landmarks, the Statue of Liberty was completed in 1886.\n\nWorld Trade â The World Trade Center is another one of New Yorks most famous landmarks, which was destroyed in 2001.\n\nThe city that never sleeps â New York is often called the the city that never sleeps, referring to the fact that there are always people awake and doing things, even late into the night.\n\nOther Useful Words and Phrases\n\nto make it â If someone makes it, they have achieved fame or success. When Jay-Z says that he made it here, it means that he achieved success in New York.\n\nmost definitely â Most definitely is an adverbial expression that signals intensity. For example, if you strongly agree with something, you can say that you most definitely agree.\n\nLets hear it for + noun â When Alicia Keys says Lets hear it for New York!, shes speaking in praise of New York, and asking for applause. Its a way of saying, Lets cheer and applaud New York.\n\nbrand new â If something is brand new, its not just new, its completely new. A brand-new car, for example, is one that has just been produced.\n\nIts a pity â If you say that something is a pity, it means that it has caused you sadness or disappointment. For example, if you cant see a Jay-Z concert because tickets are too expensive, you can say, Its a pity that Jay-Z tickets cost so much.\n\nto step out of bounds â Literally, to step out of bounds is used in sports, and means to step outside the area where a game is played. However, you can also use the expression to describe situations in which somebody is behaving inappropriately. For example, a teacher might warn you that cheating on a test is out of bounds and will result in a failing grade.\n\nact like + noun/sentence â The phrasal verb act like can mean two things: behave or pretend, depending on context. For example, if your brother is acting like an idiot, hes behaving stupidly. If your friend is acting like he doesnt understand, shes pretending that he doesnt understand something, even though she does. As you can see in the previous examples, act like can be followed by either a noun or a sentence.\n\naddicted to + noun â If youre addicted to something, youre unable to stop using it. It usually refers to harmful substances like drugs.\n\nWriting Task\n\nJay-Z and Alicia Keys are from New York. Weve heard their song, so now, lets hear it for wherever youre from!
