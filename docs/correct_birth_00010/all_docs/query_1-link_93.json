This page is provided for informational purposes and reflects information available in public USPTO records.\n\nUpdated:\n\nJuly 17, 2024\n\nShawn Carter, better known by his stage name Jay Z, is an American rapper and businessman.\n\nBorn and raised in Brooklyn, New York, Jay Z spent much of his early life making music and freestyling alongside a number of famous rappers. From brief appearances in Jaz-O recordings to cameos on stage with Big Daddy Kane in the early 1990s, Jay Z was involved in the local rap community well before he released his own music.\n\nIn 1995, Jay Z founded Roc-A-Fella Records with Damon “Dame” Dash and Kareem “Biggs” Burke. Under this independent label, Jay Z dropped his debut album Reasonable Doubt the following year. The success of his first release propelled his career in the music industry and led him to become one of the best-selling musicians of all-time.\n\nIn addition, his creation of Roc-A-Fella Records was just one of many business ventures to come. Jay Z now owns 40/40 Club, Rocawear, Tidal and he provided funding for Roc Nation in its start-up days. In June 2019, Jay Z became the first hip-hop billionaire.\n\nWith a large collection of music and companies, Jay Z naturally has an extensive IP portfolio. One of his most interesting trademark registrations is for a specific color of blue, “JAY Z BLUE.” Through his company SC Branding, he also owns trademarks for cigars, charitable services, fragrances and more. In total, Jay Z has 41 live trademark filings with the USPTO.\n\nPlease note: While we make every effort to ensure that the information provided is accurate and up-to-date, we cannot be held responsible for its accuracy or completeness.
