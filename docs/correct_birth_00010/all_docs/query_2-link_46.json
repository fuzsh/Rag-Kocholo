        "text": "Shawn Corey Carter (born December 4, 1969), known professionally as Jay-Z (often stylized as JAY-Z), is an American rapper, songwriter, producer, entrepreneur and record executive. Considered among the best rappers of all time, he is regarded as one of the world's most significant cultural icons and has been a global figure in popular culture for over two decades.\n\nWhy He's Got 99 Problems, But His Music Ain't One\n\nHis voice and flows are awesome.\n\nHis songs deal with heavy subject matter, such as gangs.\n\nHis production is great.\n\nHis song \"Takeover\" is an example of how a diss track is made well.\n\nHe has classic albums such as Reasonable Doubt, Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life, The Blueprint, The Black Album, American Gangster and 4:44.\n\nHe is a great lyricist with good use of wordplay and entendres.\n\nHis duo with Kanye West, The Throne, is pretty good.\n\nHe does really well on features.\n\nHe is a huge inspiration to a lot of rappers (such as J. Cole, Lil Wayne and Kanye West).\n\nHe helped raise the profiles of amazing artists like Kanye West, Rihanna and Beanie Sigel.\n\nHis output in the past few years is still solid, such as his album 4:44.\n\nSome of his songs have great storytelling.\n\nHe is considered to be one of the greatest rappers of all time.\n\nHe has his own very unique and cool style.\n\nAlong with Diddy, Jay-Z pledged $1 million to the American Red Cross's relief effort after Hurricane Katrina.\n\nJay-Z has previously stated in a song that \"the greatest form of giving is anonymous to anonymous\" and, in 2013, it was revealed by author Dream Hampton, who co-wrote Jay-Z's book Decoded, that he quietly established a trust fund for Sean Bell's children.\n\nJay-Z has donated money to bailing out protestors arrested during activism against police brutality.\n\nIn March 2020, Jay-Z donated $1 million through the Shawn Carter Foundation for relief during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York, and in April 2020 donated, along with Meek Mill, over 100,000 masks to U.S. prisons to protect inmates from COVID-19.\n\nHis collaboration EP with Linkin Park, Collision Course\n\nBad Qualities\n\nHe was convicted for assault and received a three-year probation sentence after stabbing a record executive in the stomach despite having witnesses and videotapes proving otherwise.\n\nHe had an affair while he was married to Beyoncé which was the basis for her album Lemonade. Thankfully, they patched up and he even made an album in response to the affair titled 4:44.\n\nHe complained that white men are so privileged in the United States while being with David Letterman.\n\nHe had the infamous line \".38 revolve like the sun around the Earth\" on \"It’s Hot (Some Like It Hot)\".\n\nLike Beyoncé, he allowed Amy Schumer to make a parody of \"Formation\" (a black power anthem).\n\nHe released a bad diss track called D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune) in which he calls people who use Auto-Tune lazy and stagnate Hip hop as a whole which is not true. Thankfully, he corrected himself and states that it is not necessarily a bad thing and even stated that there are many artists (like T-Pain, Lil Wayne and Kanye West) who use Auto-Tune greatly.\n\nHe is infamous for being a horrible singer.\n\nDiscography\n\nSolo albums\n\nReasonable Doubt (1996)\n\nIn My Lifetime, Vol.1 (1997)\n\nVol. 2... Hard Knock Life (1998)\n\nVol.3... Life and Times of S. Carter (1999)\n\nThe Dynasty: Roc La Familia (2000)\n\nThe Blueprint (2001)\n\nThe Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse (2002)\n\nThe Black Album (2003)\n\nKingdom Come (2006)\n\nAmerican Gangster (2007)\n\nThe Blueprint 3 (2009)\n\nMagna Carta... Holy Grail (2013)\n\n4:44 (2017)\n\nCollaborative albums"
