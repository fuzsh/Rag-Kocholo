He has more businesses than one can count and—perhaps we’ve buried the lead here—he’s husband to the Queen, herself: Beyonce.\n\nBut while we could go on and on about the recent Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, instead, here, we’ll just dive into his Top 15 songs. They’re all bangers, as the kids say, so turn up your stereo.\n\n15. “Can’t Knock The Hustle”\n\n14. “99 Problems”\n\n13. “Hard Knock Life”\n\n12. “Lucifer”\n\n11. “Big Pimpin'”\n\n10. “Izzo”\n\n9. “Feelin’ It”\n\n8. “Onto The Next One”\n\n7. “Song Cry”\n\n6. “’03 Bonnie & Clyde”\n\n5. “Jigga What, Jigga Who”\n\n4. “Dead Presidents”\n\n3. “The Story Of OJ”\n\n2. “Dirt Off Your Shoulder”\n\n1. “Empire State Of Mind”\n\nPhoto: PRNewsfoto/Moët Hennessy"
