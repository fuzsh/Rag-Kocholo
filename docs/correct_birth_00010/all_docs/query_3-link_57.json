        "text": "NEW YORK (WABC) -- A new bill could soon reintroduce December 4th as \"Jay-Z Day\" in the Big Apple.\n\nNew York City Councilmembers introduced a legislation earlier this month to recognize the Brooklyn-born MC and mogul's birthday as its own official day in New York City.\n\nAccording to the resolution, the bill would celebrate the \"Book of HOV\" subject's \"legendary status as a masterful MC and lyricist and as an innovative entrepreneur.\"\n\nThe Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee, who coined the iconic line, \"I'm not a businessman, I'm a business, man,\" recently took over his home borough over the summer with the record-setting \"Book of HOV\" exhibit at Brooklyn Public Library.\n\nAccording to the library, the career-spanning tribute brought in more than 600,000 visitors -- a 74% increase in the Central Library branch's attendance.\n\nLimited-edition library cards exclusively available across Brooklyn Public Library branches sparked a whopping increase in memberships in addition to thousands of attendees.\n\nThe library also had nearly 11,000 patrons during the exhibit's final day, which fittingly fell on Jay-Z's birthday.\n\n----------\n\n* Get Eyewitness News Delivered\n\n* More New York City news\n\n* Send us a news tip\n\n* Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts\n\n* Follow us on YouTube\n\nSubmit a tip or story idea to Eyewitness News"
