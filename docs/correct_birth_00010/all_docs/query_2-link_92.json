        "text": "JAY-Z could potentially have his birthdate become an official holiday in New York City. According to ABC 7 New York, legislation has been introduced by New York City Council members to have Dec. 4, the birthdate of the rapper and mogul, known as “JAY-Z Day” in light of his cultural and societal contributions.\n\n“The global phenomenon that is JAY-Z—born Shawn Carter—is widely known as an artist, mogul, husband and father, wealth builder, and supporter of economic development and community causes,” Councilwoman Farah Louis said of the Brooklyn native.\n\n“Dec. 4 as JAY-Z Day announces to the world how this Brooklyn son can be all things, including loved by his community. In the spirit of celebrating Hip-Hop’s 50th anniversary, establishing an annual celebration to recognize a homegrown hero while proclaiming our municipal support is fitting.”\n\nThe proposal, which was made by Louis and other Councilmembers, has been sent to the Committee on Cultural Affairs, Libraries, and International Intergroup Relations. The resolution will be reviewed during the New York City Council’s 2024 session, which is scheduled to begin on Jan. 3."
