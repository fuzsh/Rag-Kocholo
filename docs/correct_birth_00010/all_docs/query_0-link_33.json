        "text": "Sean Corey Carter was born December 4, 1969. Jay-Z grew up in a Brooklyn neighborhood where there was a lot of drugs. He used rap as an escape and appeared on Yo! MTV Raps in 1989.\n\nAfter selling millions of records with his own Roc-A-Fella label, Jay-Z created a clothing line. He married popular singer and actress Beyoncé Knowles in 2008.\n\nJay-Z's early life\n\nRapper Jay-Z was born in Brooklyn (New York). “He was the last of my four children,” Jay-Z’s mother later recalled, “the only one who didn’t hurt me when I gave birth to him, and that’s why I realized that he was a special child.” Father (Adnes Reeves) left the family when Jay-Z was only 11 years old. The young rapper was raised by his mother (Gloria Carter).\n\nDuring a difficult youth, detailed in many of his autobiographical songs, Sean Carter dealt drugs and played with various weapons. He attended Eli Whitney High School in Brooklyn, where he was a classmate of rap legend Notious B.I.G.\n\nAs Jay-Z later recalled his childhood in one of his songs \"December 4\": \"I went to school, got good grades, could act like a decent guy. But I had demons deep inside that could be awakened by a collision.\"\n\nHip hop glory Jay-Z\n\nCarter took up rapping at a very young age, escaping the drugs, violence, and poverty that surrounded him at the Marcy Projects.\n\nIn 1989, he joined rapper Jaz-O, a senior artist who served as a mentor, to record The Originators. Thanks to her, the couple appeared on an episode of Yo! MTV Raps. It was at this point that Sean Carter adopted the nickname Jay-Z, which was both a tribute to Jaz-O, a play on Carter's childhood nickname Jazzy, and a reference to the J/Z subway station near his home in Brooklyn.\n\nDespite having a stage name, Jay-Z remained anonymous until he and two friends, Damon Dash and Kareem Burke, formed Roc-A-Fella Records in 1996. In June of the same year, Jay-Z released his debut album, Reasonable Doubt.\n\nAlthough the record peaked at No. 23 on the Billboard charts, it is now considered a classic hip hop album with songs such as Can't Knock the Hustle featuring Mary J. Blige and Brooklyn's Finest. Collaboration with Notorious BIG was organized by Jay-Z.\n\nTwo years later, Jay-Z achieved even more success with 1998 Vol. 2…Hard Knock Life. The title track was the most popular single, earning Jay-Z his first Grammy nomination. Hard Knock Life marked the beginning of a prolific period in which the singer became the biggest name in hip-hop.\n\nOver the years, the rapper has released numerous albums and singles. His most popular songs are Can I Get A…, Big Pimpin, I Just Wanna Love U, Izzo (HOVA) and 03 Bonnie & Clyde. As well as a single with future bride Beyoncé Knowles.\n\nJay-Z's best-known album from this period was The Blueprint (2001), which later made many music critics' lists of the best albums of the decade.\n\nFrom rapper Jay-Z to businessmen\n\nIn 2003, the artist rocked the hip-hop world. He released The Black Album. And announced that this would be his last solo album before retiring.\n\nAsked to explain his sudden departure from rap, Jay-Z said that he once drew inspiration from trying to outshine other famous MCs. But he just got bored because of the lack of competition. “The game is not hot,” he said. “I love it when someone makes a hot album and then you have to make an even hotter album. I like it. But now it’s not like that, it’s not hot.”\n\nDuring a hiatus from rap, the artist turned his attention to the music side of the business by becoming president of Def Jam Recordings. As the head of Def Jam, he signed popular projects: Rihanna, Ne-Yo and Young Jeezy. He also helped make the transition for Kanye West. But his reign on the venerable hip-hop label hasn't been smooth. Jay-Z stepped down as president of Def Jam in 2007.\n\nThe artist's other ongoing business projects include the popular urban clothing line Rocawear and Roc-A-Fella. He also owns the upscale sports bar 40/40 Club, located in New York and Atlantic City, and co-owns the New Jersey Nets basketball franchise. As Jay-Z once said about his business empire: \"I'm not a businessman - I'm a business myself, dude.\"\n\nReturn of Jay Z\n\nIn 2006, Jay-Z stopped making music, releasing a new album, Kingdom Come. He soon released two more albums: American Gangster in 2007 and Blueprint 3 in 2010.\n\nThis trio of later albums marked a departure from Jay-Z's early sound, incorporating rock and soul. And offering mature themes as a response to Hurricane Katrina; the election of Barack Obama in 2008; the dangers of fame and fortune. Jay-Z talks about trying to adapt his music to fit his middle age.\n\n“There are not many people in rap who have reached the age of majority, because he is only 30 years old,” he said. “As more people come of age, we hope that the topics will become broader and then the audience will increase.”\n\nIn 2008, Jay-Z signed a $150 million deal with concert promotion company Live Nation. This super deal created a joint venture between Roc Nation (an entertainment company that handled aspects of the artists' careers). In addition to Jay-Z, Roc Nation manages Willow Smith and J. Cole.\n\nThe artist has proven to have both commercial and critical resilience. He teamed up with another well-known representative of the rap king, Kanye West, in 2011 on Watch the Throne. The album turned out to be a triple hit, topping the rap, R&B and pop charts in August.\n\nThe song Otis, which samples the late Otis Redding, received several Grammy nominations. The recording was also nominated for Best Rap Album.\n\nTwo years after releasing an album with West, both rappers released solo albums within weeks of the album's release date. West's album Yeezus (2013) was praised for its innovation. While his mentor Jay-Z's album received less favorable reviews. Rappers Magna Carta's 12th studio album Holy Grail (2013) was regarded as worthy. But failed to live up to the reputation of hip-hop.\n\nJay Z's personal life\n\nVery concerned about his personal life, Jay-Z did not publicly discuss his relationship with his girlfriend, popular singer and actress Beyoncé Knowles for years.\n\nThe couple was able to shield the press from their small wedding, which took place on April 4, 2008 in New York. Only about 40 people attended the celebration at Jay-Z's penthouse apartment. Including actress Gwyneth Paltrow and former Destiny's Child members Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams.\n\nAfter starting a family, Jay-Z and Beyonce became the subject of numerous pregnancy rumors. Over time, they had a daughter named Blue Ivy Carter (January 7, 2012). Concerned about privacy and security, the couple rented part of New York's Lenox Hill Hospital and hired extra security guards.\n\nShortly after the birth of his daughter, Jay-Z released a song in her honor on his website. In Glory, he shared the joy of fatherhood and spoke about the fact that Beyoncé had previously had a miscarriage. Jay-Z and Beyonce also posted a message with the song saying \"we're in heaven\" and \"giving birth to Blue was the best experience of our lives.\""
