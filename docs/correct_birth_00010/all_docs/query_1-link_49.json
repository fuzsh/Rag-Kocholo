        "text": "Born Shawn Corey Carter on April 12, 1969, Jay-Z grew up in Marcy Projects, Brooklyn, a drug-infested area. It was only his mother, Gloria Carter, who raised him after his father left him and his siblings. He lived a difficult life on the streets of New York as he grew up.\n\nWhen he briefly attended Eli Whitney High School with fellow rappers Notorious B.I.G and Busta Rhymes, he researched his rap potential. In 1996, Jay-Z, Damon Dash and Kareem âOriginal Flavorâ Burke co-founded an independent label named Roc-a-Fella Records alongside his partners in his early party, âBiggsâ Roc-a-Fella eventually folded into Def Jam Videos.\n\nIt was possible to recognize Jay-Z as a guy who could do almost anything. He had an important part in Def Jam as the President and CEO at the beginning of his career as an artist and a businessman. âI was forced to be an artist and a CEO from the beginning, so I was forced to be like a businessman because when I was trying to get a record deal, it was so hard to get a record deal on my own that it was either give up or create my own company,â Jay-Z said.\n\nJay-Z, as an artist, has sold more than 18 million albums globally. Jay-Z has received several coveted honors, including American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards, BET Awards and Grammy Awards for his contribution to hip-hop, beginning with his debut album Fair Doubt (1996).\n\nJay-Z wrote his autobiography titled âThe Black Bookâ along with the publication of âThe Black Albumâ in 2003, aware of the tough days he had gone through to gain popularity. Jay-Z was romantically involved with former Destinyâs Child singer Beyonce Knowles at the point. The pair who were once welcomed to dine at Buckingham Palace by Prince Charles collaborated together on the song âCrazy in Loveâ by Beyonce. âbig fat rumors,âbig fat rumorsâone day I hope to be married with children.âI hope to be married with children one day.\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKKRrnq7ecGipqCqkaW1unnAp5tmpJmbsm6%2F06ipsmWnnriqvMSdoJpn"
