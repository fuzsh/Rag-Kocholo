Jay-Z immortalized his own birthday — December 4 — on a standout song from his 2003 classic, The Black Album. Now, his birthday might become an actual New York City holiday.

Based on the work of New York City Council Member, Farah Louis— and co-sponsored by Combat Jack’s son, Chi Ossé, alongside Kevin C. Riley, Crystal Hudson, and Jennifer Gutiérrez — the resolution has since been sent to the Committee on Cultural Affairs, Libraries, and International Intergroup Relations.

New York City's City Council will then discuss the resolution when sessions resume on January 3, 2024.

“The global phenomenon that is Jay-Z, born Shawn Carter, is widely known as an artist, mogul, husband and father, wealth builder, and supportive economic development and community causes,” Louis said in the resolution meeting, according to the hearing notes. “Both his career and success have spanned decades. The accolades for Mr. Carter are filling museums, magazines, and libraries. TV shows and radio programs clamor to provide content dedicated to his masterful work that has inspired many. December 4th, as Jay-Z Day, announces to the world how this Brooklyn son can be all things including loved by his community.”
