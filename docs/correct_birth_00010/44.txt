"Jay-Z Day," a resolution pushed by New York City councilwoman Farah Louis, awaits its official recognition.

New York City councilwoman Farah Louis, who represents Brooklyn, has introduced a resolution to officially recognize “Jay-Z Day” on December 4, the hip-hop icon and billionaire mogul’s birthday.

“The global phenomenon that is Jay-Z—born Shawn Carter—is widely known as an artist, mogul, husband and father, wealth builder and supporter of economic development and community causes,” stated Lewis as reported by the New York Post. “Dec. 4 as Jay-Z Day announces to the world how this Brooklyn son can be all things . . . Establishing an annual celebration to recognize a homegrown hero while proclaiming our municipal support is fitting.”

Jay-Z was born in Brooklyn and was notably raised in the Marcy Housing projects. He has consistently made reference to his upbringing in his songs, including his 2009 hit single, “Empire State of Mind,” featuring fellow New Yorker Alicia Keys.

His promotion of his birthplace has remained evident through not only his artistry, but his entrepreneurial endeavors. He was heavily invested in the Nets basketball franchise as it moved from New Jersey to the New York City borough. Jay-Z left as a minor investor of the team and its new hub, the Barclays Center, once his company, Roc Nation, started to represent players.

His inclusion in the economic development of the city overall, including the Manhattan-based 40/40 Club, set to reopen in February 2024, is one Louis hopes to forever celebrate through the passing of the resolution.

More recently, the Brooklyn Public Library paid tribute to the legendary entertainer-turned-entrepreneur with an exhibit, “The Book of HOV.” The installation detailed the life and career of the father of three and husband to Beyoncé, further cementing his place in the city’s history.

Jay-Z, 54, has yet to comment on the potential recognition.
