        "text": "WAITE PARK (WJON News) -- Another St. Cloud road construction project that will be a traffic headache gets started in a few weeks.\n\nSecond Street South will be single-lane traffic in each direction from Highway 15 to Cooper Avenue South while crews resurface the road. Traffic will be allowed through but Stearns County Engineer Jodi Teich is emphasizing drivers avoid that area if possible.\n\nThe project will start in mid-July and go through late October.\n\nAnother project that was slated to start soon is the County Road 75 bridge replacement project over the Sauk River.\n\nThe plan was to start the bridge in late June or early July, but the project is tied to some federal money which delayed the start. And, with bids going out on July 13th, Teich says they wouldn't have enough time to pour the concrete before the cold weather arrived.\n\nInstead, she says work will begin in December with the final concrete course poured in the spring of 2024.\n\nOnce the bridge closes in December, traffic will have to be detoured either south via I-94 and Highway 23 or County Road 134 to the north. Teich estimates it will add 15 minutes each to the morning and evening commute.\n\nThe nearly $5-million project over the Sauk River is scheduled to be completed in the spring of 2024.\n\nREAD RELATED ARTICLES"
