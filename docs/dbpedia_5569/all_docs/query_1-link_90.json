That being said, you can't help from believing that the band disagree; 'Grievances' is such a perpetually bleak and soul-searching record it sounds as though the studio sessions are being broadcast directly from Dante's Fifth Circle.\n\nRather than the sprightly eccentricities of earlier material, every song feels ached out; from the post-metal leanings of 'Raumdeuter' to the Mars Volta-channelling of 'Stage Knives', each musical decision has been mournfully deliberated and considered. The end result is that 'Grievances' is by far the most mature and accomplished album the group have ever released. Gone are the awkward instances of textures attempting to out-weird each other and time signatures transposing in to nihilistic oblivion; replaced with a cohesive vision, mood and intent. Yet, from this focus a newfound means of experimentation has manifested; the closer 'All That Has Gone Before' has explosions of hellraising discord that collapse in to moments of brittle beauty, all without forsaking its sense of atmosphere and coherence."
