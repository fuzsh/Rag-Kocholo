        "text": "Old Mystics is the new 7″ single from Rolo Tomassi.\n\nThe track, which is backed with b-side Mesmerizer, is the first to be recorded with new members Chris Cayford and Nathan Fairweather, who have recently joined the band. This follows the departure of Joe Nicholson and Joe Thorpe from the band. Bassist Nathan Fairweather plays in Brontide, while guitarist Chris Cayford joins from No Coast.\n\nOld Mystics, which was recorded with Hysterics producer Jason Sanderson, is the first track to be released ahead of the band’s third studio album, which will be released later this spring.\n\nThe single will be physically released on March 26 2012, but if you pre-order it you will receive both tracks as MP3s immediately.\n\nReleased via Destination Moon Records.\n\nTracklisting:\n\nA) Old Mystics\n\nB) Mesmerizer\n\nGolden age, golden age, the world was ours for us to change\n\nBut we sat back and watched it fall without a single care at all.\n\nCome of age, let’s come of age and see the flaws in our old ways\n\nTo lose all sight of early days, a passing phase is held delayed.\n\nAspirations made disintegrate, fade out to grey, rust and decay,\n\nA galaxy of fallen stars that hides its shame behind closed doors.\n\nIt’s yours to decide what is the worth of this time?\n\nWhat is the worth of this?\n\nWhat did you think you would become?\n\nI misread dreams for motion.\n\n“Youthful days encaged in chains”\n\nDenying chance whilst wedrift on.\n\nEffortlessly lose it all,\n\nSourcing these scenes to idly,\n\nAppreciate what has been laid with no responsibility.\n\nSetting sun, setting sun our darkest days have not begun,\n\nAmbitions lead to making haste, forbidding days to go to waste.\n\nRecklessness comes with regrets, dismiss the memories of these threats,\n\nFutile talk throughout these years to try and navigate our fears.\n\nModern age, modern age, time flies never to be regained,\n\nAnd still I sit back watch me rot, ignorant to the ticking clock.\n\nDirect your sight to something new, misfortune does not follow you,\n\nOpen your eyes and explore, youth forever, nevermore.\n\nWhat did you think you would become?\n\nI misread dreams for motion.\n\n“Youthful days encaged in chains”\n\nDenying chance whilst we drift on.\n\nEffortlessly lose it all,\n\nSourcing these scenes to idly,\n\nAppreciate what has been laid with no responsibility.\n\nCollapsing under carelessness,\n\nResisting the unrealistic,\n\nIgniting this revelation,\n\nYouth forever, nevermore."
