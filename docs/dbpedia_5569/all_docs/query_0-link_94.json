        "text": "Music has always played a role in helping to define cultural moments throughout history. Stacker set out to find the best albums of the 21st century, compiling data from Metacritic (as of October 2022).\n\nAlbums were ranked according to their Metascore, which represents an aggregation of critic reviews. Only albums with seven or more reviews were eligible. EPs, box sets, reissues, and compilations were not considered.\n\nSome of Stacker's findings — like country's Ashley Monroe, Jamey Johnson and the legendary Loretta Lynn — might get listeners to sing along or even forget about the outside world for a few minutes. Over in the realm of pure pop, Self Esteem's latest album Prioritise Pleasure is being hailed as 45 minutes of melodic bliss.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, there's no shortage of music for getting angry and letting it all out. Listen for Napalm Death's growling grindcore, Converge's metalcore, Primal Scream's punk electronica, Deafheaven's black metal, and the sounds of Polish extreme metal band Behemoth that keep vexing authorities in its homeland.\n\nDiscover artists who honor their predecessors who helped shape the world we live in today. Poet Jamila Woods offers thoughtful rhythm and blues portraits of legends like James Baldwin and Muddy Waters; Rapsody wrote songs for her heroes, from Sojourner Truth to Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey; and jazz composer Wadada Leo Smith honored 10 crucial years in the civil rights movement.\n\nRead on for the 100 best albums of the 21st century, according to critics."
