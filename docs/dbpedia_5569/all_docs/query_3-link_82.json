        "text": "This September I was lucky enough to join Rolo Tomassi in Tokyo as they embarked on their first ever tour of Japan.\n\nAs I am sure many readers will know, the band have had a hard working, DIY approach since their early teens, and whilst this determination had previously got them so far as America’s SXSW or Australia’s Soundwave festivals, the band were yet to reach the shores of Japan.\n\nThis was set to change when in 2012 the heads of the Japanese post-rock label Zankyo fortuitously stumbled across the band’s performance at Brighton’s Great Escape festival and were impressed enough to invite them to their homeland. Thus began a year’s worth of correspondence and putting in the hours at work (sandwiched between a European tour for good measure) to ensure that the Japan tour would become a reality, and even when I met the band at our hostel in the Jimbocho district, there was still a level of incredulity on their faces.\n\nThis wonderful fusion of disbelief and gratitude was palpable all week as the Tokyo crowds filled out the venues or queued up to take photos with the band. And yet, there was something about Japan and its technological interests that made Rolo Tomassi, with their space-age imagery and tales of constellations, seem quite at home; or perhaps it was simply frontwoman Eva’s penchant for all things Hello Kitty and Domo.\n\nIn any case, these photos document the week in Tokyo that the band are surely to remember for ever."
