        "text": "Have you heard? June is National DJ Month. Thus it feels 100 percent appropriate to give a shout to a few of Abilene's own.\n\nThese DJs - all in the same building under the Townsquare Media umbrella - are a most excellent bunch. They are all truly dedicated to their work and committed to their craft.\n\nKEAN's Rudy Fernandez, KEYJ's Chaz McGuire, and KOOL's Brad Elliott have been on the airwaves for decades, playing your favorite tunes and keeping our Big Country community apprised of local events.\n\nRUDY \"FEARLESS\" FERNANDEZ\n\nIf you know Rudy, you know he finds joy on the radio. Whether at a concert, fundraiser, or \"live on location\", Rudy considers his listeners to be extended family. He has been buried alive and lived in a van 50 feet in the air for five days straight, raising money and attention for local charities. At 13-years-old, Rudy started working the \"God's Graveyard\" shift (aka Sunday mornings) running live preacher shows, followed by the American Top 40 with Casey Kasem. Rudy has won a lot of awards for his work in radio.\n\nCHAZ MCGUIRE\n\nChaz was working as an area supervisor for a pizza chain when he started calling into KEYJ, trying to win contests. He developed a friendship with one of the DJs, who noted that Chaz had an exceptional voice and should consider radio as a profession. Chaz soon landed employment at KEYJ on the air, working the overnight shift from midnight to 6 a.m. As Chaz says, \"I gave it a shot and here I am.\"\n\nTrue story, I used to listen to KEAN when I was younger (to fall asleep to - haha). I remember listening to Bob & Bonnie and the great Rudy Fernandez back in the day. - Chaz McGuire\n\nBRAD ELLIOTT\n\nBorn and raised in the Texas Panhandle, Brad started in radio at age 15, working weekends spinning the Top 40. After stints in West Texas, New Mexico and Kansas, he's back at his home away from home...Abilene. Brad nerds out about music, pop culture and entertainment. When he's not in the studio, you might find him in the great outdoors or on the road to a concert. He also enjoys paranormal ghost shows and a good carne guisada burrito.\n\nBig gratitude to Rudy, Chaz and Brad. Thankful for all the ways these DJs keep bringing Abilene together."
