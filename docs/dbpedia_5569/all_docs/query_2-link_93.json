        "text": "Hello\n\nHere's how it works: The Recent Releases chart brings together critical reaction to new albums from more than 50 sources worldwide. It's updated daily. Albums qualify with 5 reviews, and drop out after 6 weeks into the longer timespan charts.\n\nMilton Nascimento & Esperanza Spalding Milton + Esperanza\n\nAt the center of all this are Nascimento and Spalding, whose smiling interplay helps make Milton + Esperanza feel like both a capstone to a monumental career and continuation of a musical legacy All Music\n\nMilton Nascimento & Esperanza Spalding Milton + Esperanza\n\nThe 81-year-old singer’s collaboration with the US jazz bassist reworks past songs in lively and expansive ways, masterfully blending their exciting voices The Guardian\n\n86TVs 86TVs\n\n86TVs have crafted a debut that’s as complex and contradictory as the era it springs from. It’s an album that wrestles with big emotions and bigger ideas, all while keeping one foot firmly on the dancefloor Dork\n\nBeabadoobee This Is How Tomorrow Moves\n\nWhile it may not break entirely new ground, it’s a solid addition to her discography, marked by great production, strong vocals, and a genuine emotional core Northern Transmissions\n\nBeabadoobee This Is How Tomorrow Moves\n\nBea Laus's third album captures her dipping her toes into several spheres of influence with the guiding hand of a producer so prolific that he lingers as an omnipotent force throughout Paste Magazine\n\n86TVs 86TVs\n\nHugo and Felix White lead their long-awaited new band through a series of emotionally resonant mini-epics, but sometimes lose their way NME\n\n86TVs 86TVs\n\nThere’s sufficient melodic ability and noisy bluster in their songwriting, augmented by producer Stephen Street’s smart knack for mixing the poignant with the pop, to engage and draw in indie rock lovers The Line Of Best Fit\n\n86TVs 86TVs\n\nA newfound succinctness and dynamism make for a forward-facing project DIY\n\n86TVs 86TVs\n\n86TVs are a band whose debut album is the sums of its parts; whose formidable past endeavours including The Maccabees have helped cultivate a distinctive sound today which promises to deliver more in their bright future ahead Clash\n\nJack White No Name\n\nIt towers over the vast majority of contemporary rock music with its controlled tunefulness while ever maintaining the effortless modern appeal of Jack White himself Sputnik Music (staff)\n\nKing Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard Flight b741\n\nWhereas recent releases from the band focus on somewhat lofty and pretentious concepts, Flight b741 is old-fashioned, Americana-inspired rock ’n’ roll Spectrum Culture\n\nPersonal Trainer Still Willing\n\nWhile ‘Still Willing’ might not rewrite the rulebook, it certainly scribbles some intriguing notes in the margins. Personal Trainer are only getting fitter Dork"
