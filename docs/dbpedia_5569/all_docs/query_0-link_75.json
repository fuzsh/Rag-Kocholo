        "text": "Upstate New York is mourning the loss of country music singer and songwriter Toby Keith, who passed away during the nighttime hours on Monday, February 5, 2024, at the age of 62.\n\nThe news of Keith's death was confirmed by his official website, stating that Keith died peacefully surrounded by his family. He had been battling stomach cancer since being diagnosed in 2022.\n\nKeith was known for his larger-than-life personality and his chart-topping country hits. His songs, including \"Who's Your Daddy?,\" \"Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue,\" \"Beer for My Horses,\" and \"Made in America,\" resonated with fans across the country. His powerful lyrics and energetic performances made him a staple in the country music scene.\n\nIn addition to his successful music career, Keith also made his mark in the world of acting. He appeared in television commercials for Telecom USA and Ford, showcasing his charismatic presence beyond the concert stage. He also took on acting roles in movies, starring in the 2006 film \"Broken Bridges\" and the 2008 film \"Beer for My Horses,\" which he also wrote. These ventures allowed him to showcase his talents in different creative realms.\n\nAt one time, Toby Keith's I Love This Bar & Grill was located inside Destiny USA in Syracuse where acts like Chris Cagle performed before the venue went belly up in 2015. Keith also performed at the Taste of Country Music Festival at Hunter Mountain in 2015 as well as at the Pine Valley Campground in Endicott in the 1990s.\n\nOne of Keith's most notable performances was at President Donald Trump's inauguration concert at Washington's Lincoln Memorial in 2017. His participation in such a significant event underscored his popularity and the respect he commanded within the country music industry.\n\nKeith's contributions to country music were recognized throughout his career. In September, he received the Country Icon Award at the People's Choice Country Awards, a well-deserved honor for his influence and impact on the genre. His enduring popularity and his ability to connect with audiences were evident in the outpouring of support and tributes following the news of his passing."
