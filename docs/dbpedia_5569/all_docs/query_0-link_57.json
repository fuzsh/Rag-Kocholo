        "text": "Now THIS is a man cave.\n\nI am always impressed with the themed bars that people build in their homes. But this one blew my mind. Most bars and man caves I've seen are sports-oriented, but this bar is all about the love for the band KISS.\n\nKISS! I've noticed that KISS fans are all in! I know one, and he's amazingly dedicated to Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons (the only two original members). This band has been around since 1973, and formed in New York City. This private bar built by a huge KISS fan is going to become very popular, as KISS is doing a farewell tour! I'd say after 50 years, they've earned that right. But back to the cool man cave and bar in New Hampshire.\n\nThe memorabilia this guy has is incredible. It's not just a bar (getting to that), but it's like a mini-KISS museum! KISS is like no other band with their makeup and costumes. They're almost comic book-style characters: the Starchild, the Demon, the Spaceman or Space Ace, and the Catman. You can't have a KISS man cave and bar without games. And of course, there is KISS pinball!\n\nAll of this is great, but what if I need a cold brewski to help me play better pinball? No worries, this KISS-themed funhouse comes equipped with a full bar. Pull up a seat and enjoy a cold one while looking at the KISS playing and trading cards which are part of the bar.\n\nDoes anyone have anything that can come close to this? Because this is a fan."
