        "text": "It's fun imagining what could be coming.\n\nIt's funny how the rumors start flying when a bulldozer shows up and something new starts getting built on busy Route One in Falmouth, Maine. I live in Falmouth, so I'm right in the middle of the rumor mill. I've been watching as the construction continues, and I still can't figure out what it could be!\n\nIt's been a couple of months since that photo was taken and they've made great progress.\n\nThis is the old Arta Custom Framing on Route One in Falmouth. There hasn't been any activity in the area in a while. It's just been dormant. But then, signs of life that something was happening. This photo was in July.\n\nAnd this photo was from mid-September.\n\nThe first rumor when anything happens is Chipotle is coming. I'm pretty sure that's every teenager in the area wishing very hard. That was the rumor, along with Five Guys when it turned out to be a Verizon on Route One in Falmouth.\n\nNothing against Verizon at all. Hell, I have Verizon and this is a very convenient location - but when you've got your mind set on a burrito or a double patty greasy burger, high-speed Wi-Fi just isn't as satisfying.\n\nSo what will replace the old Arta? This place I think was a bank at one point because the old Arta boasted to have a climate-controlled bank safe to keep portraits dry.\n\nIf anyone has the scoop on what's coming, curiosity is killing this cat! A lot is happening on Route One in Falmouth these days. There's a new place Fuego that looks like it's replacing the closed Bueno Loco Mexican Restaurant. But it's stuck. I don't know why the delay (there could be a million reasons) but the sign is up and that's it.\n\nSo, whatever is coming to Route One in Falmouth - I hope to give you some business to keep you around."
