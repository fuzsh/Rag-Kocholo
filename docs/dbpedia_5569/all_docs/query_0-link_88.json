        "text": "He's back! The \"Honky Tonk Kid\" Aaron Watson is returning to his college alma mater - Abilene Christian University - to perform for their annual back-to-school concert. Watson is no stranger to ACU. After attending school there, he has been performing live at a variety of ACU events since 2000.\n\nWatson recently released his album titled \"Cover Girl\", a tribute to the women in country and pop music who have inspired and influenced his music and career. His current single is Roseanne Cash's chart-topping award-winning \"Seven Year Ache\", in which he collaborates with Texas country singer Jenna Paulette. Paulette will be joining Watson for ACU's \"Back To School Bash\" on Friday, August 25, at Moody Coliseum on the ACU campus.\n\nAs a veteran broadcaster, I believe that Aaron Watson is a genius. He does what I call a \"gender swap\" on all the songs by the women he is honoring like Dolly Parton, pop star Cyndi Lauper, The Pretenders, Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Roseanne Cash, Emmylou Harris, and others. Thanks to the \"Cover Girl\" album, we are now able to hear these songs from a man's perspective.\n\nHere's my advice if you're wanting to attend the Back-To-School Bash at ACU: get your tickets early. Every time Aaron Watson plays a concert at ACU, the venue sells out. For ticket purchase, click here.\n\nAaron Watson did a cover of a George Strait song some years ago, too. See the video below."
