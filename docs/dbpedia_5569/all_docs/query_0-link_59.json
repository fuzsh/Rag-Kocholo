        "text": "France based pop / rock trio, Oakman is thrilled to announce their upcoming EP, SCP, will be out September 30th via Rude Records. SCP, an acronym for “sugar-coated pill,” is the band’s third EP which follows up their sophomore EP, Plastic World, released back in 2018. The EP shines a light on the trio’s growth through the addition of 80’s style synths, punchy drums and a groovy bass, all the while keeping their core pop-punk energetic guitars. Pre-order SCP now HERE.\n\n“It is finally the end of a period. We are very excited to be able to give you the last pieces of this new baby,” says lead singer, Marine, about the new EP. “The last few months have gone by quickly and have been quite intense but it's also a relief because we cannot wait to get our heads into what will be the next part of Oakman. We hope you enjoy this EP and we hope you can feel the sincerity of the emotions we wanted to share with you. Soon, this EP will belong to you.”\n\nAlongside the EP announcement, the band has also shared the title track of the EP, today. The pastel-soaked video for “SCP” goes hand-in-hand with the nostalgic instrumentals and vocals as Oakman brings a taste of the 1980's to the modern day while infusing it with their own unique brand of indie-pop / rock. Watch the video now HERE.\n\nAbout the song, the band says, “Marine was watching a show during lockdown called \"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\". The main character reminded her of a character she had played when she was doing theatre. After the foundation of ‘SCP’ was written, she wrote the lyrics about these two characters. ‘SCP’ is a sarcastic and second degree track about the fear of loneliness and not being loved at all costs with a neurotic side.”\n\nThe band has shared 4 tastes of what fans can expect from SCP so far – “SCP” was preceded by “All TheWay Up,” “Murder,” “Fantasy” and “Night.” The tracks have quickly garnered the attention of the likes of Entertainment Tonight, Ones To Watch, Hot Topic and Billboard who dubbed “Night” “a carpe diem bop.”\n\nThe band arrived on the Lyon rock scene in 2016 with the release of their self-produced EP, Waterscape. Following the release of their first EP, the band began to tour across not only France, but England, Italy, Japan, the US and more. They opened for bands like Enter Shikari (Bataclan, Paris), ZZ TOP (Pérouges Fest), Basement (Kao, Lyon) and Bukowski (Marché Gare, Lyon).\n\nEvery time they play, the effect is immediate. They will touch you emotionally with songs like “Plastic World” or “Spread,” but keep a touch of fun and joy with songs like “Clear Enough.” With Marine’s incredible voice at the forefront, the band builds up a contrast between aggression and solace with each track.\n\nOAKMAN is:\n\nMarine (Lead vocals / Guitar)\n\nGeremia (Bass)\n\nJesse (Drums)\n\n​\n\nWebsite: https://www.oakmanband.com\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/OAKMANBAND\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oakmanband/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oakmanband\n\nRolo Tomassi have announced 'Closer (The Edits)' EP, out 5th August via MNRK. The EP contains new edits of the bands recent single 'Closer' from Daniel Avery, ATTLAS and Ki Oni & Luke Elliott.\n\nOriginal track taken from their critically acclaimed album 'Where Myth Becomes Memory', released earlier this year and already a frontrunner for a Mercury Prize nomination.\n\nListen to Closer (Daniel Avery Edit) - HERE\n\nRolo Tomassi hare never a band to stand still, and can now announced 'Closer (The Edits)' EP, set for release on 5th August. The EP contains newly edited versions of the bands single 'Closer', which is taken from from their critically acclaimed album 'Where Myth Becomes Memory' that was released back in February earlier this year. The band teamed up with Daniel Avery and ATTLAS and Ki Oni & Luke Elliot for the new edits, and release the Daniel Avery edit today, June 9th, on all DSP's.\n\n​​\n\nCloser (Daniel Avery Edit)\n\nCloser (ATTLAS Edit)\n\nCloser (Ki Oni & Luke Elliott Edit)\n\nOn working this edit and remix project, the band said: \"It was great to get the opportunity to have an artist like Daniel Avery produce this edit of the track. We're big fans of his own work so jumped at the chance to have him work on it. Similarly with ATTLAS, who has taken take 'Closer' and opened it up to a whole new audience with his incredible remix. It's just so exciting to hear these other artists take elements from our signwriting and make something entirely new.\"\n\nA little about first collaborator, Daniel Avery:\n\nOver the last decade Daniel Avery has cemented a worldwide reputation as one of the most original artists in contemporary electronic music. The release of the seminal debut Drone Logic in 2013 — an album defined by mentor Andrew Weatherall as “gimmick-free machine funk of the highest order” — is a record that still makes its presence felt today. A collaboration with synth master and Nine Inch Nails member Alessandro Cortini spawned the full length Illusion Of Time. The latest albums Together in Static and Love + Light formed sister releases during lockdown and were further proof still of Avery’s range, delicacy and skill as a producer. A self-confessed late-starter to the world of dance floors, instead lured by the guitars of The Stooges and My Bloody Valentine during his teens, over time Avery became fascinated by the expansive possibilities of sound design and refined a beautifully brutal style distinctly his own.\n\nPre-order Closer (The Edits) - HERE\n\n​\n\nROLO TOMASSI are:\n\nEva Korman - vocals\n\nJames Spence - keyboards, piano, vocals\n\nChris Cayford - guitars\n\nNathan Fairweather - bass\n\nAl Potts - drums\n\nAlternative rock outfit Bring the Hoax has joined Lövely Records for the release of their debut, self titled EP.\n\nHailing from Stockholm, Sweden, the four piece blends sweet melodies with fuzzed out guitars into colorful, energetic, and dynamic rock music. The first release from the group is the single ”Los Angeles”, which is out now on all streaming platforms together with a music video.\n\nHasse Karlsson from the band comments:\n\n\"Los Angeles came to life during the spring. We all longed for the everlasting Swedish winter to end and for the summer vibe to arrive. We always dreamed of the perfect roadtrip since the ones in a cold, dark Scandinavia leaves one hoping for more. This is our soundtrack for that roadtrip to come.The lyrics centers around a wish for a summer road trip to Mexico. On a long car ride like that good music is a most essential part of the feeling. Pavement is a perfect fit for this, and that is why Pavement is the first word sung in this song.“It kicks off with a rowdy intro and lands in a soothing verse which builds up towards a luscious and dreamy chorus that is perfectly suited for a summer drive in your car.”\n\nThe four piece Bring the Hoax infuses indie rock songs with strong fuzzy guitars and delicately sweet melodies. The songs are held together by an unapologetic force that hardly leaves anyone untouched. It's clear that the band members take their influences from the finishing decades of the 20th century. You can hear hints of Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr, Built to Spill and Smashing Pumpkins to name some. Bring The Hoax is a rowdy, but yet polished and pleasant companion in the world of indie rock.\n\nGritty dynamics are key in the songs of Bring the Hoax and the balance between the dirty and beautiful guitar tones versus the mountains of distortion and fuzz can be heard in pretty much every song they ever written. The lyrics are poetic and tell suggestive tales about politics, relationships and the everyday struggle that is life.\n\n“Ever since we were kids we have adored a sweet and catchy melody wrapped in a big fuzzy blanket of guitar distortion” - Hasse Karlsson\n\nKarl Nordahl and Hasse Karlsson both grew up in Viksjö, north of Stockholm, Sweden, and were probably destined to become friends since they both were equally unable to resist the mesmerizing pull of the massive soundscapes coming out from the punk-, indie- and grunge-era of the 90s. When they many years later had their apartments just shy of a 100 meters apart, it was time to start making music together.\n\nThe first light the band name Bring the Hoax saw was of the fluorescent kind in a dark hotel room without windows, in the basement of a cheap bed and breakfast in Rhodos, Greece, in 2010. They asked Mark Petterson (My God Damn Territory, Washing Machina) – who Hasse had played with in a couple of bands and projects earlier - to join them on bass. A bunch of drummers later Mark took the seat himself behind the drums when Sara Engström (Washing Machina, Dag och Natt, Tam Tapir) was able to join on bass.\n\nBring the Hoax has recorded and produced 2 eps during the years prior to the 2022 signing with Lövely Records. Many great things are going to be revealed in the present future.\n\n​https://www.facebook.com/bringthehoax\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/bringthehoax/\n\n​\n\n​www.facebook.com/LLYrecords\n\nwww.instagram.com/lovely_records\n\nhttps://llyrecords.com\n\nCredit: Christopher Hargreaves\n\nUp and coming Welsh soul artist Nia Wyn has released her new single ‘Checkmate’. It is the third track to be revealed from her upcoming third EP ‘Magical Thinking’, set for release on 23rd June via Unity group. The release arrives during Glastonbury Festival, where Nia is performing as one of the shortlisted artists for the Emerging Talent competition. ‘Magical Thinking’ was written during the pandemic and finds Nia tackling issues of identity, belonging and issues around mental health, as she elaborates\n\n\"This EP is a body of work that was largely written during the pandemic, and touches on the strong universal emotions everyone feels at some point - betrayal, lust, guilt, anxiety and a desire to feel like you belong somewhere. It follows up with similar themes of my last EP around identity and mental health.”\n\nThe EP is the first body of work to be released by Nia since 2021’s ‘Take A Seat’ EP and is a 6 six track collection that proves 2022 is Nia’s year. Growing up in North Wales, Nia was exposed to a wide range of music from northern soul, the jazz-blues of Billie Holiday to hip hop icons Nas and Lauryn Hill. To date, Nia has attracted support from the likes of Spotify, Deezer, DIY, Wonderland, Clash, EARMILK, BBC Radio 1, BBC 6 Music, BBC Introducing and Radio Wales. In October 2020, Nia's track ‘Who Asked You’ was included in the FIFA 21 Soundtrack.\n\nIn July 2021, Nia was awarded with a PPL Momentum Music Fund grant by PRS Foundation and joined Paul Weller on his sold out 2021 UK tour as well as headlining her own London show at Bermondsey Social Club in the winter of 2021.\n\nThe track list for the ‘Magical Thinking’ EP is:\n\nLeave My Bed\n\nCheckmate\n\nOughta Be\n\nDo You Want To Know Me\n\nGuilty\n\nMagical Thinking\n\nNIA WYN PLAYS:\n\n25th May PRS Presents: Member’s Day Live event\n\n25th June Glastonbury Festival (Avalon stage)\n\n10th July Opening for Paul Weller at Lytham Festival, St Annes\n\n14th July Headline show at Courtyard Theatre, London\n\nKeep up to date here: INSTAGRAM // YOUTUBE // TWITTER // SPOTIFY\n\nFresh from the release of his recent single ‘How Are You Feeling?’, singer/songwriter George O’Hanlon returns with new song ‘Seagulls’. The title track from his forthcoming EP, out 13th May.\n\n‘Seagulls’ is a particularly poignant song for George. Dealing with the subject of schoolyard alienation, the track is a heavy reflection (both sonically and thematically) on the feelings of isolation and confusion that can come to you at that delicate age when you’re first starting to express yourself.\n\n“Seagulls is a song I wrote reflecting on my time in school” George explains. “It’s a song for all the lonely, frustrated kids both past and present staring out the window.” Inspired by the likes of Bob Dylan, Jeff Buckley and Thom Yorke, O’Hanlon’s song writing is both literary and deeply personal, incorporating his own life experiences into his work while framing them from different perspectives.\n\nOver the last few years O’Hanlon has been refining his playing and song writing and is now ready to share his music with the world. Following a few early gigs on the college circuit, George expanded out into a series of shows at grassroots venues, adding additional players to his live show and honing his live performance.\n\nLast September George embarked on his first UK tour of small venues around the country with his band. \"We spent hours with four of us crammed in a car with all our gear\" George remembers of the tour. \"The tough bits are service stations at 3 in in the morning and things like that but playing the shows made it all worth it\"\n\nIn 2022 George will be playing a variety of festivals including Liverpool Sound City, Eastbound Festival, The Great Escape, TRSMT and 110 Above. George will also be headlining a special show at the legendary Camden Assembly (formally the Barfly) on the 26th April.\n\nLive Dates\n\n26th April – Camden Assembly – London\n\n30th April – 1st May – Sound City - Liverpool\n\n11th – 14th May – Great Escape Festival – Brighton\n\n8th – 10th July – TRNSMT Festival – Glasgow\n\n11th – 14th August – 110 Above – Leicestershire\n\nFor more information go to:\n\nInstagram // Facebook // Twitter\n\nIndiana, the British singer, songwriter and social media provocateur, has announced and released a new EP titled ‘I Like Drinking’. The title track, an uplifting pop anthem dedicated to the art of boozing, is lifted from Indiana’s current album ‘Not Girlfriend Material’, which was released in August. The EP also includes a remix by fast-rising UK producer Adam Turner, an acoustic version of the song, and a brand new track ‘Wasted On You’\n\nIndiana said:-\n\n“I was drinking heavily at the time of writing it and didn’t give a fuck what people thought. I genuinely like drinking. In fact, I love drinking and that’s OK as far as I’m concerned. There are millions out there that feel the same. It’s a song for them.”\n\nIndiana’s album ‘Not Girlfriend Material’, like it’s creator, is sultry, heartfelt, eclectic and sometimes controversial. The album was recorded at a time of significant change in Indiana’s life - the end of a relationship and a moment of self discovery.\n\n\"Entering the dating scene was a wake-up call. It never satisfied me…. guys are attracted to me, and want to f*ck me…. but in terms of continuing a relationship, they have issues with who I am, and why they were attracted to me in the first place.\"\n\nAnd so came the life-changing revelation: “I’m not girlfriend material, but I’m OK with it.”\n\nThe revelation became a life statement and since then, has become a mantra. Indiana has created a clothing line called ‘Sex Leisure’, which sells a range of t-shirts bearing the slogan ‘Not Girlfriend Material’. In what has now become a signature look for the artist, an oversized t-shirt coupled with sports socks and trainers, she says it is “a cute exterior but with a bit of filth.”\n\nHaving previously released an acclaimed album via Sony, since leaving the label Indiana has become a social media provocateur in her own right - her instagram account @indianathegirl has thousands of followers who signed up for her sultry yet artistic selfies, tongue-in-cheek commentary and controversial moments.\n\n‘I Like Drinking’ EP Track Listing:\n\n1 - I Like Drinking\n\n2 - I Like Drinking (Adam Turner Remix)\n\n3 - Wasted On You\n\n4 - I Like Drinking acoustic\n\n'I Like Drinking' is available here: http://smarturl.it/ILikeDrinking\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/indianathegirl/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/indianathegirl\n\nhttps://www.twitter.com/indianathegirl\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/sexleisure/\n\nItalian punk/hardcore act Peste has revealed a new track called \"Mercy\", first single taken from the upcoming self-titled EP available in 7\" and digital format in the first part of 2019 via This Is Core. The track was recorded and mixed at Magma Studio of Turin by Davide Donvito, and mastered by Jack Shirley (Deafheaven, Oathbreaker...) at The Atomic Garden Studio in San Francisco. About \"Mercy\" the frontman Marco Fresia says:-\n\n\"'Mercy' talks about God, about the merciful and charitable God who has condemned us to live a very happy and enchanting life on this Earth. It is a song that speaks of how we can not wait to see and relive the return of his favourite son to show him all our gratitude with nails, hammers and crosses\".\n\nListen \"Mercy\"at this LINK.\n\nPeste s the union of musicians taken from the Italian underground scene. A new punk/hardcore project with members of Tutti I Colori Del Buio, Haram, If I Die Today and Papazeta. Violence, negativity and hate against mankind are the keywords for describe their work. In their fast five pieces Peste deal with the brutal horror hidden inside of everyone soul, the human ability of destroying everything all around without no remorse remaining a slave of fear till death. A truly daily and deeply nightmare inside every human being.\n\nFACEBOOK | INSTAGRAM\n\n19 year-old South Coast newcomer Megan Bird releases her infectious debut single 'Affirmation' today.\n\nHaving worked closely with GRAMMY and Ivor Novello award winning songwriter Eliot Kennedy (Spice Girls, Bryan Adams, Gary Barlow), Megan proves herself to be a surefire one to watch, possessing an infectious sound that shines through more so than ever in ‘Affirmation’, her first official musical offering.\n\nMuch like female figureheads Pink, Kelly Clarkson and Demi Lovato who Megan considers hugely influential in her musical journey, lyrically they share similar running themes of self-assurance and empowerment. Growing up on pop-rock royalty Paramore and All Time Low have also played an important role in moulding her sound over the years.\n\nOn both the making and meaning behind the debut single, Megan says of ‘Affirmation’ -\n\n“This song was the very start of my debut album, the first song I wrote up in Sheffield with Eliot and Jim, and it made me excited about writing music again. I had just started college and wasn’t sure what I wanted to do, I was doing a music course but wasn’t that interested and couldn’t find something that I could fully relate to. I was 16 when we first wrote it, and hearing the change in my voice and confidence over the past three years is crazy.“\n\nOn the meaning of the song -\n\n“Within these last few years there’s been different situations in my life where I can really relate to the lyrics, and that’s something I always want to achieve with songwriting - that you can always relate in some way to what’s being said, and I love the timeline within the song itself. It’s based on a one sided relationship, which can also reflect on friendships. This has been a recurring theme for me and is the best way to let that frustration out, through music and especially lyrics.”\n\nBursting at the seams with energy and attitude, ‘Affirmation’ boasts the perfect blend of cinematic chords and anthemic drums, all brought together by Megan’s sharp melodies.\n\nAlongside her full band, Megan presents the opportunity to experience the new music live with a headline homecoming show in Winchester on October 12th.\n\nInstagram | Twitter | Facebook | SoundCloud\n\nArt School Girlfriend is the moniker of Polly Mackey, a producer, multi-instrumentalist and vocalist from Wrexham, North Wales. Her upcoming second EP ‘Into The Blue Hour’ tracks her move from London to a tightly knit creative community in the seaside town of Margate. After trading the intrusive city skylines for an endless horizon by the sea, Mackey’s forthcoming music has a new sense of space, depth and introspection. The EP’s lead single ‘Distance (Blank)’ is available to buy and stream on all platforms.\n\nLISTEN here\n\nThe founding member of Welsh shoegaze outfit Deaf Club, Mackey spent time immersed in East London’s creative ecosystem before moving south of the river. Since the group disbanded, Mackey became enamoured with London’s pirate radio networks and began making electronic music with an experimental focus, releasing her debut ‘Measures’ EP as Art School Girlfriend in late 2017. Now expanding on those electronic blueprints, the ‘Into The Blue Hour’ EP sees Mackey further develop her production tool kit and mastery of negative space. The beat-driven lead single ‘Distance (Blank)’ explores Mackey’s fatigue with crowded city living, feelings of claustrophobia and the desire to be out in a wide open space. The single is soon to be paired with visuals directed by Tom Dream.\n\nArt School Girlfriend embarks on her first full UK tour in October, beginning with a performance at London’s St Pancras Old Church on the 5th. Full details follow. The ‘Into The Blue Hour’ EP will be released in full on September 28th via Wolf Tone.\n\nUK Tour Dates\n\n05/10 London St Pancras Old Church\n\n06/10 Southsea Dials Festival\n\n07/10 Hare & Bounds Birmingham\n\n08/10 Hug & Pint Glasgow\n\n10/10 Sneaky Petes Edinburgh\n\n11/10 Underground Newcastle\n\n12/10 Now Wave Venue Manchester\n\n13/10 Sound Basement Liverpool\n\n14/10 Tom Thumb Margate\n\n15/10 The Hope Brighton\n\n16/10 Hy Brasil Bristol"
