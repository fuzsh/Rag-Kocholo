        "text": "Presence Trailer\n\nSteven Soderbergh‘s Presence (2025) teaser trailer has been released by Neon. The Presence trailer stars Lucy Liu, Chris Sullivan, Callina Liang, Eddy Maday, West Mulholland, and Julia Fox.\n\nCrew\n\nDavid Koepp wrote the screenplay for Presence. Julie M. Anderson and Ken Meyer produced the film.\n\nPlot Synopsis\n\nPresence (2025)’s plot synopsis: “A family moves into a suburban house and becomes convinced they’re not alone.”\n\nOn Movie Trailers\n\n“A trailer (also known as a preview or attraction video) is a commercial advertisement, originally for a feature film that is going to be exhibited in the future at a movie theater/cinema. It is a product of creative and technical work…Trailers consist of a series of selected shots from the film being advertised.\n\nSince the purpose of [this advertisement] is to attract an audience to the film, these excerpts are usually drawn from the most exciting, funny, or otherwise noteworthy parts of the film but in abbreviated form and usually without producing spoilers.\n\nFor this purpose the scenes are not necessarily in the order in which they appear in the film. [This type of ad] has to achieve that in less than 2 minutes and 30 seconds, the maximum length allowed by the MPA. Each studio or distributor is allowed to exceed this time limit once a year, if they feel it is necessary for a particular film.\n\nIn the United States there are dozens of companies, many of which are in Los Angeles and New York City, that specialize in the creation of film trailers. The trailer may be created at agencies (such as The Cimarron Group, MOJO, The Ant Farm, Ben Cain, Aspect Ratio, Flyer Entertainment, Trailer Park, Buddha Jones) while the film itself is being cut together at the studio.\n\nSince the edited film does not exist at this point, the trailer editors work from rushes or dailies. Thus, the trailer may contain footage that is not in the final movie, or the trailer editor and the film editor may use different takes of a particular shot. Another common technique is including music on the trailer which does not appear on the movie’s soundtrack.\n\nThis is nearly always a requirement, as trailers and teasers are created long before the composer has even been hired for the film score—sometimes as much as a year ahead of the movie’s release date—while composers are usually the last creative people to work on the film\n\nTrailers tell the story of a film in a highly condensed fashion to have maximum appeal. In the decades since film marketing has become a large industry, trailers have become highly polished pieces of advertising, able to present even poor movies in an attractive light.\n\nThe key ambition in trailer-making is to impart an intriguing story that gets film audiences emotionally involved.\n\nMost trailers have a three-act structure similar to a feature-length film. They start with a beginning (act 1) that lays out the premise of the story. The middle (act 2) drives the story further and usually ends with a dramatic climax.\n\nAct 3 usually features a strong piece of “signature music” (either a recognizable song or a powerful, sweeping orchestral piece). This last act often consists of a visual montage of powerful and emotional moments of the film and may also contain a cast run if there are noteworthy stars that could help sell the movie.”\n\nThe Feature Movie Trailer\n\nWatch the Presence Trailer.
