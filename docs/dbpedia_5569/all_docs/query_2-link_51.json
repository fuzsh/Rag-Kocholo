        "text": "Modern hardcore band Terrible Love is a new band featuring former members of Goodtime Boys, Bastions and Grappler. Having extensively played all over the world in their previous bands, the five piece came together in 2015 to record the melodically chaotic EP \"Change Nothing\". The EP, which the band released as a free download in January, will be released on 12\" (including a very special ltd variant) via Big Scary Monsters on April 22nd.\n\nHaving decamped as far from the city as land will allow, writing sessions began in Cornwall in the spring of 2015, culminating in a five song EP, \"Change Nothing\", an explosive record, which is equally melodic as it is caustic. With topics ranging from personal loss, urban gentrification, cultural homogenisation to this generation's sense of ennui, the EP gives a cathartic voice to frustrations that are all too common in recent years.\n\nAlongside their debut shows with Jungbluth in February the band has just announced they'll be heading out on three dates with the awesome Sheffield five piece Rolo Tomassi in April."
