        "text": "The City of Sedalia, in collaboration with the Sedalia Fire Department, would like to inform the public about two important measures concerning public safety: the implementation of a burn ban and the prohibition on the discharge of fireworks within the city limits.\n\nThe Sedalia Fire Department has implemented a burn ban, effective as of June 2, due to the prevailing drought conditions and associated fire risks.\n\nThis ban, put in place to mitigate the potential for fires, prohibits any open burning activities within the city limits. The City of Sedalia urges all residents and visitors to comply with this burn ban for the safety and well-being of our community.\n\nAdditionally, the discharge of fireworks within the City of Sedalia is strictly prohibited at all times, as stated in Section 36-123 of the City of Sedalia’s Municipal Code. This code section reads as follows: “Sec. 36-123. – Restriction on the sale, discharge and storage of fireworks. (a) No person shall buy, sell, display, or discharge any firecrackers, cannon crackers, aerial bombs, torpedoes, rockets, Roman candles, flares, or fireworks of any kind or description or any pyrotechnic material with the city, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section. (b) Public displays of fireworks or pyrotechnics will be permitted only upon permission in writing, signed by the mayor and countersigned by the chief of the fire department. (c) No person shall store or keep any fireworks, firecrackers, cannon crackers, torpedoes, bombs, rockets, Roman candles, flares or other pyrotechnic material within the city; provided, transportation in a motor vehicle of the same shall not be considered as storing or keeping of such items.\"\n\nIn light of these regulations, the City of Sedalia, in partnership with the Sedalia Parks and Recreation Department, encourages everyone to attend a Spectacular Fireworks Display at the Missouri State Fair Grounds on July 4th at 9:30 p.m. This professionally organized display is the only fireworks event permitted within the City of Sedalia and will be closely monitored by the Sedalia Fire Department. Additional personnel and precautions will be in place to ensure the safety and enjoyment of all attendees.\n\nAccording to Sedalia Fire Chief Matt Irwin, the fireworks presented during this display are specially designed to burn out before reaching the 320-foot safety zone, ensuring an extra layer of precautionary measures.\n\nIn addition, the SFD will wet the ground prior to the show, and in the unlikely event that one of the glowing embers makes it to the ground, the SFD will have extra suppression personnel in scene to extinguish the embers,\n\nAlso, the SPD will have one of their drones with thermal capability in the air to make sure nothing is missed.\n\nUnlike individual fireworks that can be purchased, this professionally controlled event is the only fireworks display permitted within the City of Sedalia.\n\n\"There will be no discharging of personal fireworks allowed within the City, which includes the fairgrounds before, during or after the event,\" Chief Irwin stated.\n\n\"The City of Sedalia appreciates the understanding and cooperation of its residents and visitors during this time. By adhering to the burn ban, refraining from the discharge of fireworks, and attending the authorized fireworks display, we collectively contribute to the safety and well-being of our community,\" a press release concluded late Thursday afternoon."
