        "text": "Rational reader Poker ran this one by me recently:\n\nI’ve been seeing this girl and we’ve slept together a few times… Today, in bed, I got asked, “How may girls have I been with?” and “Why won’t I be her friend on Facebook?”\n\nHow many girls question…\n\nHere’s how I handled it – would love to know if you think this was handled properly… (using cocky-funny attitude)\n\nMe: “I don’t tell that.”\n\nHer: “More or less than 20?”\n\nMe: “I have some freedom of information forms in the car – you could fill one out and get your answer in 20 years.”\n\nHer: “Don’t you want to know how many guys I’ve been with?”\n\nMe: “No.”\n\nIron Rule of Tomassi # 2\n\nNEVER, under pain of death, honestly or dishonestly reveal the number of women you’ve slept with or explain any detail of your sexual experiences with them to a current lover.\n\nThe single most disastrous AFC move a man can make is to OVERTLY describe past sexual experiences and/or give a number (accurate or not) to how many women he’s been with prior to the one he’s with. This simple act, whether you offered the information or she dragged it out of you, ALWAYS comes off as pretentiousness and is often the catalyst for an avalanche of emotional resentment, if not outright emotional blackmail from an insecure woman. This is a rookie mistake that will only take you once to learn.\n\nIf a woman puts you on the spot by directly asking you for this information always sidestep this COVERTLY. C&F works wonders in this situation and still keeps the air of mystery and challenge about you.\n\nHer: “So how many girls have you been with?”\n\nYou: “You’re my first actually”\n\nHer: “Really, how many girls have you been with?”\n\nYou:” You mean tonight?”\n\nHer: “C’mon, how many girls have you been with?”\n\nYou: “You know, I really lost count after 50” (or something outrageous).\n\nWhen a woman asks you this question she is seeking confirmation of what she already suspects – NEVER give her this satisfaction. When a woman resorts to OVERT communication (COVERT being her native language) she’s generally exhausted her patience to be COVERT and this is a desperation tactic for an insecure woman.\n\nWhile this scenario may be fraught with potential disaster, it is also an opportunity to encourage her imagination and prompt some competition anxiety.\n\nHer: “How many girls have you been with?”\n\nYou: “I have an idea, lets fuck and then you can tell me how many girls you think I’ve been with, OK?”\n\nA lot of Game rookies think that since they’ve only been with 1 or 2 women in their lives what’s the harm in open, honest, full disclosure? Like most Betas they bought the “open communication is the secret to a good relationship” meme long ago, so the impulse to be upfront is their default response. They tend not to see the utility in keeping that information, or being ambiguous about it, plants a seed of competition anxiety. When she KNOWS she’s your first, you’ve just abdicated the frame to her in any kind of relationship. Second, if she’s your 9th then every girl up to 8 becomes a stamp in her collection to use against you in the first fight you have. Every date you take her on she wonders “Did he take #6 here too?” It’s as if you cheated on her with every previous girl up to her. I should also add that this is the first question a BPD (borderline personality disorder) woman will ask you so she can feel horrible about herself for not measuring up to “your standards” and drag you into the emotional hell-pit with her."
