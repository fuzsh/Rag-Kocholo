        "text": "We have put together an evening of live music in celebration of Barnsley’s female musical talent, which will take place on Saturday 7th March at the Barnsley Rock and Blues Venue. The event not only coincides with International Women’s Day weekend, but will also act as a fundraiser for Breast Cancer Care. We have seen a number of notable female musicians come from our town, especially from our thriving folk music scene; Kate Rusby being the most famous, along with the wonderful Kathryn Roberts and Rosalie Deighton (search out an album by the all female folk group Intuition, if you want to see all three perform together).\n\nYou also have individuals like Eva Spence from the internationally popular metal band Rolo Tomassi and also Sarah Walker, who has not only been a presenter on BBC Radio for over twenty five years, but is also a renowned classical musician.\n\nFor our event, we celebrate local female talent by showcasing four of the best female performers from the current local music scene, and it was extremely difficult to pick just four. The line-up for the event includes the long awaited return of popular alt-rock band AZTEC DOLL and the live debut of Lauren Tate’s new band, HANDS OFF GRETEL. There will also be live solo sets from LAURA KELLY who uses loop pedals and harmonisers to create a unique performance and HARRIET ROSE GRANT, who was nominated for Best Solo Artist at the 2014 Barnsley Music Awards.\n\nAs well as the live music, we will also be holding a raffle, which will include prizes donated by local musicians, artists and businesses, including Kate Rusby and the artist Roseanna Hanson. All proceeds raised at the event will go to Breast Cancer Care. I chose this charity as a family member has recently been undergoing chemotherapy following her own diagnosis of Breast Cancer last year.\n\nSince the event was announced, we have been asked if gents are allowed in. We can announce that the event is open to absolutely all music fans – including fellas.\n\nWe will also hold a raffle.\n\nAZTEC DOLL, HANDS OFF GRETEL, LAURA KELLY and HARRIET ROSE GRANT @ THE POLISH CLUB SATURDAY 7 MARCH, 7:30PM / £3 ON THE DOOR ALL PROCEEDS GOING TO BEAST CANCER CARE A celebration of local female performers. For fans of grunge, alt-rock, post-punk and acoustic singer/songwriters. https://www.facebook.com/events/733604866710394/"
