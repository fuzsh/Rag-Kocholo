        "text": "Lout Promotions\n\nThe Haunt\n\nMonday 22nd October\n\nThis night could have been called ‘The Off-Kilter Cabaret’ because just about everything is unexpected: the performances, the performers and, the star of such a show, the songs. Across all three featured bands (Goodtime Boys, Oathbreaker and Rolo Tomassi) it would be impressive if you could hum a chorus, a riff or even just name some lyrics by the end of the evening such is the nature of ‘math-rock’. There is a strong similarity between the acts playing tonight but each has their distinct discernible differences which has made for an incredibly strong billing.\n\n“Passionate” would be the best description for the performance ‘Goodtime Boys’ bring to the stage. Their chaotic output is melodic despite the heartfelt aggression (particularly from drums and vocals) and despite the total lack of form in their songs the progressions always seem natural; perfect for those unfamiliar to their work. The drum kit is notably stripped down, with rack toms and all but two cymbals removed, yet it is impressive how prominent they still are in the arrangement, most likely due to the complete proficiency their drummer has accomplished.\n\nThere is broken guitar string (expected under those brutal conditions) but it is a testament to the professionalism of the night when a spare is brought out immediately, causing barely a hiccough in the set. This band are ultimately a bold and impressive stage statement worth checking out but shouting lyrics at the audience without a microphone, especially so frequently, will be most effective when the fan-base is significantly yours, otherwise those who could become fans may be deterred by perceiving that passion as arrogance.\n\nThe next band, ‘Oathbreaker’, come all the way from Belgium and are the first of two bands tonight to feature a pretty young thing fronting the project with a juxtaposing voice that could literally devour your soul (with room for a family member or two as well). It took a couple of songs for the feeling of “do mine eyes deceive me?” to wear off but that is absolutely part of the appeal this outfit boasts. Slightly less intricate than the night’s predecessors or headliners, but just as encapsulating, Oathbreaker tear through a short but sweet set that raises the hair on your arms because they just “sound” so good.\n\nThis is clearly a band that has sat down and really gotten to know their instruments, both in tone (especially the guitar, almost an equal to Matt Bellamy of Muse in how much space he can fill with only a bass to support him) and how they interact together as a band. With much of the material nodding to influences (particularly the heavier side of Kyuss) while, at the same time, remaining original, Oathbreaker are an intriguing, fresh and imaginative act, just be prepared for nice ‘she’ sounds inbetween songs and how brutal she is during them.\n\nDespite all that has come before, ‘Rolo Tomassi’ are the band of the night, both by literal billing and their jaw dropping artistic…demonstration? Fronted by the fun-sized Eva Spence, ‘Rolo Tomassi’ blend the vindictive with the beautiful which eventually equates in a musical canvas that jilts listeners through music that hurts in all the right ways (the mosh pit certainly thought so) and ambient soundscapes that coax you through to the next section of abrasion; Rolo Tomassi really capture the essence of “Beauty and the Beast” (which is something the other bands of the night could take note of).\n\nThere are two new members of the band tonight (guitar/bass) and an appropriate mix of new to old material: ‘Oh, Hello Ghost’ is beautiful in its juxtaposition while the new material from Astraea fits seemlessly into the band’s diverse back catalogue. While the performance is brutal and engaging the set falls a little short at just under an hour but that is probably for the best considering how both mentally and physically exhausting this band are (in the best kind of way). You don’t make this kind of music because you are good at your instrument, you make it because you OWN it and it’s going to be a long time before any attendee of this concert forgets Eva Spence’s sexy strutting/dancing. What a night!"
