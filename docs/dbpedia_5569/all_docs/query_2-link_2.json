For his age, he is an extremely talented guitarist and I'm eager to hear what he does next, if indeed he does/has form/join another band.\n\nA bit of a web search turns up nothing, the only mention of his name is in various articles stating that he and the bassist had left Rolo Tomassi. I've never seen any mention from any of the current or former members to explain why they left in the first place, or indeed what they planned to do after leaving the band. All very vague! If anyone knows owt, I'm keen to hear. Thanks."
