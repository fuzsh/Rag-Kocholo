        "text": "Rolo Tomassi will release Live at the Electric Ballroom on September 27th.\n\nUK Progressive metal band Rolo Tomassi announce a new live album, Live at The Electric Ballroom, to be released on September 27, 2024, via MNRK Heavy. The 15-track project was recorded from a headlining show on February 15, 2023, at London’s Electric Ballroom. The set showcases Rolo Tomassi at their most dynamic and mesmerizing. The first single, \"Aftermath,\" is out today. Originally released on 2018’s Time Will Die and Love Will Bury It, this live version intensifies the melodic and sweeping soundscape. Vocalist/keyboardist James Spence says, “Since its release, this song has been an audience favourite along with a rare opportunity for a sing-along. It remains an outlier in our material, but in the context of a full set, it always feels like an elevated moment. Our band has always been about stark contrasts, and this is a perfect example of that.”"
