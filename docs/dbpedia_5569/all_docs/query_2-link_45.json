        "text": "Now in their 13th year, with five albums and a multitude of EPs and splits under their belts, the history of Rolo Tomassi is synonymous with Holy Roar Records.\n\n\"Playing an early show in my house in 2005, I instantly fell in love with them. They summed up everything that I wanted the initial blueprint of Holy Roar to be about - a loud, energetic vibrancy and intelligence that wasnâ€™t cloaked in gimmickry, macho posturing or stupid imagery.\" - Alex Fitzpatrick\n\nIncredibly, despite member changes, Rolo Tomassi have gone from strength-to-strength, with Time Will Die And Love Will Bury It being their best and most varied album to date, losing none of their early energy whilst pushing ever further into new musical realms.\n\nSome have started to call it a serious renaissance - with ever more critical acclaim and sold out shows being solid testament to that over the past year or so. It feels to me like we are only truly starting to see what Rolo Tomassi are capable of. Just imagine what this band could be doing in another four albums time."
