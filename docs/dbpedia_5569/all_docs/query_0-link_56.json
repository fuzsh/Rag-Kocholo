        "text": "It's Day #2 of WBKR's 'Lookin' for Lainey' contest and we're giving you another chance to win a pair of tickets to see Lainey Wilson in concert November 2nd at the Ford Center in Evansville. That concert is nearly sold out, but we have an exclusive chance for you to win tickets through the WBKR app.\n\nYesterday, Jessica Ziemer won a pair when she figured out that we had hidden Lainey Wilson tickets in the red Studebaker truck at Reid's Orchard in Owensboro. Today, we have taken another pair of tickets and we've hidden them too. But where?\n\nTo play 'Lookin' for Lainey', you'll need to download our WBKR app and enable push notifications. That's how you will receive our clues.\n\nEach weekday- from Monday, February 12th through Friday, February 16th, we're \"hiding\" a pair of tickets to Lainey's show. Now, it's important to note that we are hiding those tickets 'virtually.' You don't have to drive all over the Tristate looking for them. All you have to do is play right there from your cell phone.\n\nKinda like the new Fox game show We Are Family, you have to pay close attention to the clues we share and be the first to correctly guess where the tickets are hidden. As soon as you think you know where they are, enter your answer on the Enter to Win form below. However, a pro tip for you! You only get ONE guess per day, so you need to make sure your guess is correct before you submit it.\n\nThe first person to correctly guess today's hidden location is going to snag a pair of tickets to see Lainey Wilson's Country's Cool Again Tour on Saturday, November 2nd at the Ford Center in Evansville.\n\nPlayers are only allowed to win ONE pair of tickets during this contest.\n\nSo, are you ready for Day #2! Here's a clue that can help you win today's tickets (Tuesday, February 13th).\n\nCLUE #5 - MA & PA\n\nNow, if you think you know where today's pair of Lainey Wilson tickets has been hidden, enter your answer here. But, remember! This is worth repeating. You only get ONE guess daily, so make sure you're certain before you submit it. The first person to guess correctly is going to the show!\n\nDave Spencer will announce today's winner at approximately 5:20pm CST this evening. Good luck!"
