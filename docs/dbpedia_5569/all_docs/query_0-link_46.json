        "text": "“Go see shows.”\n\nI’ll be 108 years old, sitting in the nursing home eating pudding, waiting for Dateline to start. When my great-great-granddaughter will ask, “Why aren’t you dead yet?”\n\nHer mom will smack her on the back of the head, and she will… rephrase the question “What keeps you moving, what’s your secret?”\n\n“Concerts, Go see shows.” Of course, by that point, she will be lost back in their phone, because she really didn’t care in the first place.\n\nBut I do think it is a big deal. There just isn’t anything like live music. I don’t care if you are sitting with a couple of great friends at Music on Main, sipping a beverage. Or sitting with 70,000 of your closest friends screaming at the top of your lungs at Dave Grohl. They are experiences that give life.\n\nThis week is a great time to get out of the house and take in a show or two. Here in Butte, we have Music on Main returning on Thursday nights.\n\nSaturday, The Butte Depot will host the Butte Rock Fest (with free admission)\n\nThe inaugural Bluegrass Festival is running all weekend in Twin Brides, Montana.\n\nMonday, July 3rd, Morgan Evans will be playing at the Original Mine Yard, with The Ken Rich Band opening. This is going to be an incredible evening; the music will run right up to the fireworks show on the Big M.\n\nTuesday the 4th of July, Grammy Award-winning singer/songwriter Jason Isbell is playing a sold-out show at the Kettlehouse Amphitheater. (There is a ticket waiting list, you can find that HERE, I wish you good luck)\n\nHelena’s long-running, Symphony Under the Stars is on the calendar for July 15th.\n\nThe annual Headwaters Country Jam is scheduled for July 27-29 in Three Forks Montana.\n\nThat is honestly just a few. There is so much more out there, some will cost you a few bucks, and some you can get into free. Either way, make a plan, get some tickets, and get out and see a show or two, or four.\n\nI'd say I'll see you in the pit, but (picture Danny Glover) \"I'm too old for that......\""
