        "text": "Body Hound is Sheffield's latest installation of progressive, instrumental and experimental rock. Featuring ex members of Rolo Tomassi and Antares. Here is my interview with their guitarist Calvin Rhodes.\n\nHow did Body Hound form and and what each member contributes to the music you create in Body Hound ?\n\nBody Hound was formed around 2007. At first it was just me and Ryan doing a guitar and drum thing. I used an octave pedal to fatten all the riffs up. When Joe Nicholson and Joeseph Thorpe stopped playing in Rolo Tomassi they joined in and we completely rearranged all the tracks to work for a full band.\n\nHow does it compare to playing in your previous band Antares and what are the different creative methods and approaches you have taken this time around ? How would you also describe the way think about music has changed since playing Antares?\n\nI didn't have quite as much of a creative role in that band. In Antares we just kind of immaturely tried to come up with the craziest, fastest and most abrasive stuff possible. The way I think about tonality and rhythm has definitely changed since those days. Also my approach to improving has changed and is based more around actively studying the tonal and rhythmic qualities. I find that it delivers the most meaning/depth and how certain modern composers achieve this psychedelic, aching juxtaposition of emotions that's way deeper and less black & white than major and minor.\n\nDo you feel being an instrumental band gives you more creative freedom and do you feel that some audiences still react oddly to instrumental music even though it's been around for generations?\n\nI'm not sure if I could say because I've never actively worked with a vocalist in a band. I've always composed music and then they've just done their thing over the top of it. The human voice is a wonderful and versatile instrument and if I could find a vocalist who could do something really interesting or someone who I could hand some sheet music to and get them to sing something specific then I'd absolutely be open to not being instrumental. I think people are probably more accepting of 'weird' music if there are no vocals. It forces you to listen in a different way I suppose.\n\nDoes each of you have your own songwriting method or preferences in they way you like to write? How do you also implement the use of different time signatures and changes in dynamics throughout a song and have you had to change the way you work whilst playing in Body Hound?\n\nWell me and Joe Nicholson are the primary writers although songwriting/arrangement is more of a process for the whole band. It tends to be either me writing a riff and presenting it to the band or me and Joe writing a riff collaboratively. We write connecting passages and link them together in band practice to turn a collection of riffs into a full track. Both the track and the individual riffs tend to go through a lot of incarnations before we consider them acceptable. Most of the tracks have changed slightly since the EP was recorded so it's an ongoing process. The time signatures and dynamics just kind of happen naturally. We're into trying to think of all the possible ways to frame a specific rhythm before settling on one or two of them.\n\nWhat was the songwriting process for the ep and where did you draw your inspiration from? Is there a concept or theme running through it and were there any difficulties you experienced throughout the writing and recording processes?\n\nSome of the tracks were written more recently and some of them were about years ago, so there's quite a lot of varied inspiration. Things that stick out as inspirations are CTTE by Yes, Meshuggah's approach to rhythm and the tonal quality of 20th century composers like Olivier Messiaen and Igor Stravinsky.\n\nWhat was it like working with Tom Prendergast? What impact did he have on the ep? Do you think the end result would have been different if you had worked with someone else?\n\nTom was great. He understood how we wanted the record to sound, what we were trying to achieve and was a much needed outside perspective. I'm sure the end result would've been different if we'd recorded with someone else. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but I'm very happy with how it turned out.\n\nHow have audiences reacted to the new material?\n\nIt's hard to tell . Everything has been positive so far but I'm sure there are people who don't like it.\n\nWhat inspired you to become musicians and what bands/artists and albums have made the greatest impression on the way you play and think about music?\n\nI was inspired to become a musician by hearing a friend play some Blink 182 on guitar. In terms of what's had the greatest impression on me, it would probably be The Rite Of Spring by Stravinsky, pretty much everything Mew have done, Steve McQueen by Prefab Sprout and everything Autechre have done. There's a lot more, but these are the ones that come to mind offhand.\n\nHow would you describe the approach you take with your instrument and what steps did you have to take to develop your musical style,do you also have a strict practice routine if so, then what does it involve? How do you feel you developing as musician and is there any specific direction you want to head in musically?\n\nI've never really 'practised' on guitar. Most of my improvement over the past five years or so has come from writing music on a computer and then learning it afterwards. I find this takes away any limits your technique or muscle memory imposes on you and forces you to write from a purely musical standpoint as opposed to writing like a guitar player.\n\nWhat skills do you think are crucial for modern musicians and what advice can you give to musicians who want to develop their techniques and skills? Are there any books or lessons you can recommend?\n\nThe most crucial skill is probably developing your ear. The more you learn to hear the colours and subtleties in music the more you understand everything you hear and have a clearer vision of how to achieve the music you want to achieve. Try to take absolutely everything you hear on board and isolate things that have a particular meaning for you or find things that you think sound cool. Figure out exactly what it is you’re enjoying about everything you hear. As far as going about achieving, I’m not sure about books or anything but I’m sure there are decent apps or websites now that allow you to practice recognising intervals. Learn how each interval sounds until you know it inside out and you tune into its unique character.\n\nWhat albums are you currently listening to and when was the last time you saw a band that surpassed everything you thought was possible with music?\n\nI'm currently listening to the AlunaGeorge's Body Music and Disclosure's Settle. I'm also enjoying Bonobo's The North Borders and the latest Boards Of Canada album. The music that blows me away the most is electronic. The fact that as a race we're now making music using electricity and our understanding of how sound and pitch works always blows my mind. When you look at it in the context of the entirety of musical history it's nothing short of incredible.\n\nWhat equipment do you use and what are the preferences with your setup?\n\nJoseph Thorpe (Bass): Joe N uses an Orange Rockerverb 50 through an Orange 4x12. This setup was used for all the guitar on Rhombus Now. His guitar is a prototype Ibanez Roadcore that's actually kind of a 'signature' model. His pedalboard includes an Electro Harmonix Memory Man, Electro Harmonix POG, Electro Harmonix Frequency Analyzer, Behringer Ultra Vibrato, Boss Chorus and Boss TU-2 Tuner.\n\nRyan plays a Tama Starclassic BB kit, Ludwig Black Beauty snare, Paiste Rude cymbals, Trick Pro 1-V Kick Pedal, he also endorses Pro-mark sticks and Evans drum heads.\n\nCalvin uses an old Peavey Valveking head for gigs, and a Gordon Smith guitar for riffs. I'm unsure which model. It is red. He doesn't use any pedals yet but one day he will do my bidding.\n\nOn Rhombus Now I used an Orange Terror Bass 1000 through a homemade Trace Elliot-style 1x15 and a Selmer Treble + Bass 100 through an 8x10. Live I usually just plug the Orange into whatever cab is supplied, but hopefully this will become more unreasonable in the future. For basses I use a Fender Reggie Hamilton Standard (I used this one on RN) or a Franken-Fender which is the colour of salmon. On the EP I used these pedals: MXR M80 Bass DI +, MXR Bass Compressor, Proco RAT.\n\nFor gigs my signal chain is:\n\nBass>Boss LS-2 Line Selector set to AB Mix>Darkglass Vintage Microtubes (loop B)>Proco RAT (loop A)>MXR Bass Compressor (for clean harmonics)>Boss TU-2 Tuner.\n\nAll stringed instruments are tuned to D standard and we use Jim Dunlop strings. Joe and Calvin use Wegen guitar plectrums, I use Jim Dunlop 3mm Big Stubbies.\n\nWhat era of music would you like to visit if you had the opportunity to and how do you think your music would be received there? How do you think musicians form that era would react to music in the present?\n\nI'd love to see how music has developed in another thousand years if we've survived that long as a species. I hope people from the distant future like our music but maybe it'll just sound primitive. I mean what if future humans have a cybernetically enhanced range of frequencies they're able to perceive? Like 1hz - 100khz. All music recorded before that would probably sound like shit.\n\nDo you think that progressive and experimental music is becoming more widely acceptable and that fans of music have a music higher expectation of what bands are expected to deliver? If so then why?\n\nYeah, probably. The internet accelerates human progress. Well, being able to communicate with and bounce ideas off of other people accelerates progress, and the internet is such a revolutionary tool in that sense. Also, we can now greater expose ourselves to different types of music than any other time in history. When you think about it like that it seems inevitable that people are improving faster and also experimenting much more.\n\nYou can stream and download Body Hound's ep Rhombus Now for free or as pay as you want at: http://bodyhound.bandcamp.com/album/rhombus-now\n\nKeep up to date with all of their news and gigs at: https://www.facebook.com/Bodyhound?fref=ts"
