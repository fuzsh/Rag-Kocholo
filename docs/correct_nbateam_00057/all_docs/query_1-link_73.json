        "text": "With the 2010-11 NBA season ready to tip off, CBCSports.ca takes a team-by-team look at the comings and goings in the Western Conference.\n\nNORTHWEST DIVISION | PACIFIC DIVISION | SOUTHWEST DIVISION\n\nTo read our Eastern Conference preview, CLICK HERE.\n\nPACIFIC DIVISION\n\nLos Angeles Lakers\n\nIf you're looking for the best team in the league, then look no further. Sure, the Three-Headed Hydra resides in Miami, but the true king has a throne at the Staples Center. Once again Kobe Bryant proved his worth leading the Lakers to their second consecutive championship (number five for the Black Mamba). Floor general and locker-room leader Derek Fisher is back for another go. Pau Gasol and Andrew Bynum (health-permitting) will patrol the paint with Lamar Odom filling the other lane. This team has talent, experience, and toughness. A potential three-peat? A real possibility …\n\nADDED: Devin Ebanks, Derrick Caracter, Steve Blake, Theo Ratliff, Matt Barnes\n\nLOST: Jordan Farmar, Josh Powell\n\nPhoenix Suns\n\nAfter an impressive run to the Conference final last season, the Suns will have a much tougher road this time around. There's no doubt point guard Steve Nash will be a model of consistency and continue to make the players around him better. Problem is, there isn't a whole lot to work with here. Amare Stoudemire is now a Knick, and ask anyone in Toronto if Hedo Turkoglu is the answer your problems. The team can still run — any team with Captain Canada at the helm can run. They just can't defend.\n\nADDED: Gani Lawal, Dwayne Collins, Matt Janning, Josh Childress, Hedo Turkoglu\n\nLOST: Amare Stoudemire, Louis Amundson, Taylor Griffin\n\nGolden State Warriors\n\nYou can see these guys, but you might not be able to catch up with them. This young, talented Warriors team struggled at the defensive end, but the acquisition of forward David Lee from the Knicks should help at both ends of the court. Battery mates Stephen Curry and Monta Ellis appear to be future stars but they will take time and reps. Rattle some cages, sure. Take down the champs? I think not.\n\nADDED: Ekpe Udoh, Jeremy Lin, Dorell Wright, Rodney Carney, Louis Amundson, Charlie Bell, Dan Gadzuric, David Lee\n\nLOST: C.J. Watson, Anthony Tolliver, Corey Maggette, Kelenna Azubuike, Anthony Randolph, Ronny Turiaf, Anthony Morrow\n\nLos Angeles Clippers\n\nThe future seems brighter for L.A.'s other team now that last year's top overall pick is cleared to grace the hardwood again. Forward Blake Griffin will finally get his chance to prove he was worth all the hype. Add in the Baron Davis factor and this team is much improved over last year. What exactly does that mean? They will make some noise down the stretch, but will eventually be on the outside looking in when the best eight teams in the conference compete for a championship.\n\nADDED: Al-Farouq Aminu, Willie Warren, Ryan Gomes, Randy Foye, Brian Cook, Craig Smith\n\nLOST: Drew Gooden, Steve Blake, Travis Outlaw\n\nSacramento Kings\n\nRemember this team? Probably not, although reigning rookie of the year Tariq Evans was a joy to watch. If the Kings have something to build on other than Evans, it could be buried deep inside wide-body and fifth-overall pick DeMarcus Cousins. He will get plenty of minutes to speed along his development, but it will take more than that to get this team into the post-season.\n\nADDED: DeMarcus Cousins, Hassan Whiteside, Antoine Wright, Samuel Dalembert, Darnell Jackson\n\nLOST: Sean May, Spencer Hawes, Andres Nocioni, Jon Brockman\n\nNORTHWEST DIVISION\n\nPortland Trail Blazers\n\nSpeaking of injuries, are we ever going to see centre Greg Oden play 82 games? Actually, he has already — he's played a total of 82 in his first three seasons in the league. Not that it's his fault the rigours of the NBA have taken their toll. A bad landing here or there hasn't helped either, but when the franchise is counting on you, things get a little bit more complicated. Nothing wrong with this team on paper. Brandon Roy is a proven leader and go-to guy. Andre Miller is consistent, Rudy Fernandez is always dangerous, and forward LaMarcus Aldridge has come into his own with a consistent mid-range game and a strong defensive presence. A healthy Blazer squad will make some noise. How much remains to be seen.\n\nADDED: Wesley Matthews, Elliot Williams, Luke Babbitt\n\nLOST: Juwan Howard, Martell Webster\n\nDenver Nuggets\n\nAre they poised to dethrone the Lakers in the West? Not as long as rumours swirl about the future of the franchise, Carmelo Anthony. With the season about to get underway he still hasn't softened his trade stance, although he has continued to put up impressive numbers in the pre-season. Point guard Chauncey Billups is always \"cooler than the flip side of your pillow\" and will distribute the rock accordingly. But with the exception of 'Melo, \"to whom\" should he pass? The Nuggets will need their frontcourt to remain healthy and continue to contribute in a combined effort. Al Harrington, Nene, and Kenyon Martin will have to crash the boards and finish at the offensive end if the Nuggets are to build on last season's success.\n\nADDED: Al Harrington, Shelden Williams, Anthony Carter\n\nLOST: Johan Petro, Joey Graham, Malik Allen, Coby Karl, Brian Butch\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves\n\nYes, this team is still rebuilding. They've been doing that since Kevin Garnett left a while back, but there is some promising talent on the horizon. They picked up point guard Luke Ridnour and signed forward Michael Beasley, but that won't put the Wolves in the post-season. Forward Kevin Love has progressed nicely, but this team is still more than a few players away from contending in the West.\n\nADDED: Wesley Johnson, Lazar Hayward, Nikola Pekovic, Luke Ridnour, Darko Milicic, Anthony Tolliver, Michael Beasley, Martell Webster, Kosta Koufos, Sebastian Telfair\n\nLOST: Ryan Gomes, Al Jefferson, Ramon Sessions, Ryan Hollins, Delonte West, Greg Stiemsma\n\nOklahoma City Thunder\n\nKevin Durant. Enough said. Okay, not quite, but you get the idea that this is Durant's team. KD has emerged as a perennial all-star with a future spot in the Hall of Fame, but his supporting cast isn't in the same league. Point guard Russell Westbrook turned heads last season with his electrifying ball handling and ability to get to the basket, but he's still prone to costly mistakes in crunch time. Playoffs? Yes. Kevin Durant? Yes. Beating the Lakers, Nuggets, or Mavericks? It would be highly entertaining, but very unlikely.\n\nADDED: Craig Brackins, Quincy Pondexter, Royal Ivey, Daequan Cook, Morris Peterson, Cole Aldrich\n\nLOST: Etan Thomas, Mustafa Shakur, Craig Brackins, Quincy Pondexter\n\nUtah Jazz\n\nThe Jazz didn't rebuild this off-season — they reloaded. Al Jefferson has replaced Carlos Boozer. All-star Deron Williams will distribute the basketball with hopes that forward Andrei Kirilenko and outside threat Mehmet Okur are on the court to finish. Problem is they just don't have enough offensive guns to compete with the elite in the West. They will rely heavily on the system — coach Jerry Sloan's system. It's a given that the Jazz will finish top-eight in the conference, but they haven't been able to solve the Lake Show who have sent them packing the last three tries.\n\nADDED: Gordon Hayward, Raja Bell, Francisco Elson, Earl Watson, Al Jefferson\n\nLOST: Carlos Boozer, Kyle Korver, Wesley Matthews, Kosta Koufos\n\nSOUTHWEST DIVISION\n\nHouston Rockets\n\nCentre Yao Ming can finally put his best foot forward to help this struggling franchise get back to where they once were. Unfortunately for Rockets fans, it will take more than that. This team boasts a formidable backcourt in Aaron Brooks and Kevin Martin, and they play good team defence. They just aren't consistent enough to make a real run at the big dogs.\n\nADDED: Patrick Patterson, Brad Miller, Luis Scola, Kyle Lowry, Courtney Lee\n\nLOST: David Andersen, Trevor Ariza\n\nDallas Mavericks\n\nAlas, this team will be in the playoffs come March, but without a compliment to all-star Dirk Nowitzki the Mavs won't be going very far. Re-occurring theme? The backcourt is solid with veteran point guard Jason Kidd, Caron Butler, and Jason Terry but with the exception of Nowitzki there's no real presence up front.\n\nADDED: Dominique Jones, Brendan Haywood, Ian Mahinmi, Steve Novak, Tyson Chandler, Alexis Ajinca\n\nLOST: Erick Dampier, Eduardo Najera, Matt Carroll\n\nMemphis Grizzlies\n\nThe youth movement in Memphis remains in full swing and the future looks bright in the distance, but not immediately. Mike Conley was instrumental in the team going from 20 wins in 2008 to 40 wins last season. Not bad. Forward Rudy Gay is a proven commodity while O.J. Mayo is sure to build on a solid campaign. It remains to be seen how well this group will progress — they're better than last year, but just not quite good enough.\n\nADDED: Tony Allen, Acie Law\n\nLOST: Ronnie Brewer\n\nNew Orleans Hornets\n\nWaiting for the Hornets to realize that point guard Chris Paul can't do it himself. Newly acquired Trevor Ariza should have an immediate impact, but it will be more of the same for Hornets fans: a lot of CP3, not a lot of anyone else.\n\nADDED: Cole Aldrich, Mustafa Shakur, Jannero Pargo, Pops Mensah-Bonsu, Quincy Pondexter, Trevor Ariza, Marco Belinelli, Willie Green, Jason Smith\n\nLOST: Morris Peterson, Cole Aldrich, Darren Collison, James Posey, Julian Wright, Darius Songaila, Craig Brackins\n\nSan Antonio Spurs\n\nWhen talking about the Spurs, the word \"seasoned\" immediately comes to mind. That, and \"who's on the disabled list right now?\" Sure, this team is a constant playoff threat with point guard Tony Parker controlling the tempo, Manu Ginobili getting to the rim, and the always fundamentally-sound Tim Duncan in the middle. Injuries have been the biggest obstacle for this squad over the last few seasons, and chances are veteran players will spend more time on the DL than on the hardwood. But a healthy Spurs team would give anyone in the West a run for their money.\n\nADDED: James Anderson, Ryan Richards, Tiago Splitter, Gary Neal, Richard Jefferson"
