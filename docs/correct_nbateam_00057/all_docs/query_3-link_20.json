        "text": "Back in 2002, Steve Blake and his Maryland basketball teammates joyously celebrated after defeating Indiana 64-52 to bring the school its sole national championship. Now the former Terp has landed his first full-time coaching job as an assistant coach for the Phoenix Suns under new coach Monty Williams, as reported by Peter Vecsey on Monday.\n\nAfter a career at Maryland in which he set the program record for assists, Blake spent 13 years playing in the NBA for eight different teams. During that span, he had three different stints with the Portland Trailblazers, during one of which Williams was an assistant coach. The Blazers then hired Blake in 2017 as a coaching intern — his first professional experience behind the clipboard.\n\nBlake, now reunited with Williams, will help try to rebuild the Suns organization, which hasn’t made the NBA Playoffs since 2010. Randy Ayers, who has been an assistant coach in the league for nearly two decades, also joins the coaching staff. The team has some promising young talent in guard Devin Booker and 2018 first pick Deandre Ayton, and will have the sixth pick in this year’s draft.\n\nIn other news\n\nThree-star offensive tackle Santana Saunders committed to Maryland football on Monday. He is the seventh player to commit to the 2020 class.\n\nFormer Maryland football linebacker E.J. Henderson was named to the 2020 College Football Hall of Fame Ballot. Henderson, who played for the Terps from 1998-2002, is the only two-time consensus First Team All-American in program history.\n\nIn even more Maryland football news to come out Monday, defensive tackle Adam McLean confirmed on social media that he has entered the transfer portal.\n\nThe Big Ten is set to announce its newest commissioner today, and it was reported Monday night that Kevin Warren has been hired. Warren is the Chief Operating Officer of the Minnesota Vikings and will be the first African-American commissioner of any Power 5 conference.\n\nMaryland women's lacrosse’s Megan Taylor made history as the first ever goalkeeper to win the Tewaaraton Award. Check out Wes’ piece on her prolific senior season.\n\nMaryland men’s lacrosse had many of its key defensive players graduate this spring. Henry wrote about how the program could fill those holes before next season."
