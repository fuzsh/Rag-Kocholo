Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports\n\nNot too long ago the Sacramento Kings executed the action of signing Ty Lawson to a non-guaranteed, one-year contract.\n\nAlthough overall Ty Lawson has had a solid NBA career, there is uncertainty on how he will perform while wearing purple and white this upcoming season.\n\nTo help clear some air and gain a perspective from someone outside of the Sacramento Kings community, A Royal Pain was fortunate enough to interview Blake Holmes (@NuggetsNation21) about what type of expectations Kings fans should have for their newly acquired point guard.\n\nBlake is currently a writer for Nugg Love, a website ran by FanSided that produces content pertaining to the Denver Nuggets. Blake is also an avid Nuggets fan who watched Lawson during his tenure with the Denver franchise.\n\nWithout further ado, please enjoy this slideshow of the Q&A that the A Royal Pain team had with Blake about Ty Lawson.\n\nApr 8, 2015; Denver, CO, USA; Denver Nuggets guard Ty Lawson (3) drives to the basket against Los Angeles Lakers guard Dwight Buycks (20) during the first half at Pepsi Center. Mandatory Credit: Chris Humphreys-USA TODAY Sports\n\nQuestion: On the offensive side of the ball, what made Lawson effective for the Nuggets?\n\nBlake: When he played for the Nuggets, Lawson had lightning fast speed, and excellent ball handling skills. A prime example is the ankle-breaker that he had on Jodie Meeks from the Los Angeles Lakers. Lawson was also an excellent passer, almost averaging ten assists per game in some seasons.\n\nNext: Question #2\n\nApr 18, 2016; Toronto, Ontario, CAN; Toronto Raptors point guard Cory Joseph (6) drives to the basket against Indiana Pacers guard Ty Lawson (10) in game two of the first round of the 2016 NBA Playoffs at Air Canada Centre. The Raptors beat the Pacers 98-87.

Will the addition of Lawson be able to help or worsen the Kings’ defense this season?\n\nBlake: Lawson’s addition won’t do much of an effort for the defense. Even in his Nuggets’ days, he wasn’t the best of defenders.\n\nMar 28, 2015; Portland, OR, USA; Denver Nuggets guard Ty Lawson (3) dribbles around a pick set by teammate forward J.J. Hickson (7) as Portland Trail Blazers guard Steve Blake (5) closes in at Moda Center at the Rose Quarter. Mandatory Credit: Jaime Valdez-USA TODAY Sports\n\nQuestion: From an outsider’s view, Lawson seemed to play a big role in the Nuggets’ success in recent years. In your opinion, what role did he play when he was in Denver?\n\nBlake: I guess I would say the wrong role. Lawson’s style of play matches the player who does not need to be the star player. He should be a team’s third, maybe second option to score, and he should feel free to spread the ball around instead of the one shooting the most.\n\nFeb 10, 2015; Los Angeles, CA, USA; Denver Nuggets guard Ty Lawson (3) is greeted by teammates as he walks to the bench after scoring on a steal late in the fourth quarter against the Los Angeles Lakers at Staples Center. Mandatory Credit: Robert Hanashiro-USA TODAY Sports\n\nQuestion: The Kings are looking for leaders to help unify the locker room. Would Lawson help in this category? How much of a leader was he when he was on the Nuggets?\n\nBlake: It took him a while, but eventually he grew into the leader role for the Nuggets. I believe the same may be for the Kings.\n\nApr 18, 2016; Toronto, Ontario, CAN; Indiana Pacers guard Ty Lawson (10) looks on from the bench in the late stages of the game against the Toronto Raptors in game two of the first round of the 2016 NBA Playoffs at Air Canada Centre. The Raptors beat the Pacers 98-87. Mandatory Credit: Tom Szczerbowski-USA TODAY Sports\n\nQuestion: Lawson had his struggles last season with the Rockets/Pacers. What do you think was the problem with him last season?\n\nBlake: Even though he needs to be the second option, he wasn’t used to it last season, so in turn, he struggled.\n\nFeb 22, 2015; Oklahoma City, OK, USA; Denver Nuggets guard Ty Lawson (3) and Denver Nuggets forward Danilo Gallinari (8) watch their team from the bench during action against the Oklahoma City Thunder at Chesapeake Energy Arena. Mandatory Credit: Mark D. Smith-USA TODAY Sports\n\nQuestion: Throughout his career, Lawson has had some troubles outside of basketball. How much of a distraction was that when he was on the Nuggets?\n\nBlake: It was a big distraction when the face of the team is out with his off-the-court issues. However, people can change and it will be interesting to see if those ways are behind him.\n\nJan 14, 2015; Denver, CO, USA; Denver Nuggets guard Ty Lawson (3) against Dallas Mavericks guard Raymond Felton (2) during the first half at Pepsi Center. Mandatory Credit: Chris Humphreys-USA TODAY Sports\n\nQuestion: Overall, will the Kings be better with Lawson or Rajon Rondo?\n\nBlake: For the style that the Kings play and also factoring the outside shooting help that they may have needed, Lawson should be a better fit. However, it is very close.\n\nNov 11, 2015; Houston, TX, USA; Houston Rockets guard Ty Lawson (3) brings the ball up the court against the Brooklyn Nets during the first quarter at Toyota Center.

Mandatory Credit: Thomas B. Shea-USA TODAY Sports\n\nSummary/New Expectations?\n\nAfter concluding my interview with Blake, I have a clearer perspective of what to expect from Ty Lawson. I can’t say that my expectations towards Lawson have changed much, but rather after the interview they are more concrete.\n\nHe is a player that will mostly benefit the Kings offensively by being a playmaker. He has the ability to score the ball but does most of his damage utilizing his speed and passing ability, which is good for a team that has DeMarcus Cousins and Rudy Gay.\n\nAs long as the 5’11” guard stays out of trouble, he should be able to rejuvenate his career. He seems pretty motivated to do so.\n\nI don’t think Lawson will return to his All-Star caliber self, but I’m confident he will be better than he was last season. He most likely will start for the Kings when the season starts, and hopefully, he will be able to fulfill the expectations that I have for him and more.\n\nMore from A Royal Pain\n\nThis article originally appeared on"
