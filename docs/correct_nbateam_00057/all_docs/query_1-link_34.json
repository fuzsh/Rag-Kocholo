Reigning NBA Finals MVP Nikola Jokic is a massive reason why. The center led the postseason in points, rebounds, and assists. Jokic is a two-time league MVP that is widely regarded as the greatest player in basketball currently. Jokic isn’t the only impact player the Nuggets have though - Jamal Murray, Michael Porter Jr., and Aaron Gordon are all effective. The three combined to average 53.7 points during the 2022-23 regular season. With a dominant core, Denver will certainly be in the mix to repeat as champions.\n\nBall Arena has perfect luxury amenities for fans. The PoinstBet Club Level has upscale dining, spacious areas and access to the Truly Club and Colorado Social, along with several other premium options. Club Lexus has all-inclusive food and beverage, complimentary parking, dedicated concierge service, and a great opportunity to impress clients and employees. More intimate seating is also available. Theatre Boxes have an all-inclusive environment with catered food, plush seating (4-6 people), access to all Denver Nuggets and Colorado Avalanche (NHL) regular season and playoff games, and VIP parking. Suites at Ball Arena are another great option. They include leather seating, TVs, a wet bar, premium parking, early entry, and more.\n\nPast Spotlights\n\nAfter reaching the Western Conference Finals in the bubble playoffs of 2020, the Nuggets were without Jamal Murray during the last two postseasons. Murray returns to a team that is home to two-time defending NBA MVP Nikola Jokic and is also joined by a healthy Michael Porter Jr. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope is this offseason’s big addition, and he will help on defense to a team that’s been the NBA’s most efficient team on offense over the past five seasons. Aaron Gordon, Jeff Green, and newcomer Bruce Brown also add veteran depth for a team that can contend for a title.\n\nSuites at Ball Arena are the best way to enjoy a night out on the town in Denver for a Nuggets game. Two levels of suites await after you arrive through the VIP entrance. Once in the suite, you’ll have access to exclusive catering options and flatscreen TVs in your spacious suite. When it’s time for the game, enjoy it in comfort in oversized leather seats. You’ll also have access to the PointsBet Club Level, where there are several lounges and other amenities available.\n\nThe MVP is here! Nikola Jokic can do-it-all as the NBA’s most versatile man in the middle, and he may have to while the Nuggets’ second option recovers. Jamal Murray tore his left ACL toward the end of the 2020-21 season and may be on the mend until playoff time. A stretch Denver has become a fixture in as of late with three consecutive appearances, including a trip to the Western Conference Finals in 2020. Michael Porter Jr. and Aaron Gordon will be called upon to pick up the slack in Murray’s absence, both of whom made significant strides after Murray’s injury last season. Re-signing veterans in Will Barton, Austin Rivers, and JaMychal Green will add depth to a team with lofty expectations. Fans can enjoy the suite life at Ball Arena for one game or year-round. Enter the arena early at a VIP entrance while parking the premium lot to enjoy a night of comfort with plush leather seating, HDTVs, and wet bar in the privacy of your own space. Experience Club Lexus for the pinnacle of basketball and high-end luxury. All- inclusive food and beverage plans with upscale dining options await you from the best, cushioned seats in the house.

If this is the case, certain clients are willing to pay a premium to be in a lower level suite that is closest to the action on the field. We will give you details on suite location as we provide you with availability for the game you desire.\n\nDoes it pay to wait to book a suite until closer to the event?\n\nWith regular tickets, prices will often drop in the days leading up to a game. While every once in a while the same occurs with suites, in general, pricing does not drop before the game. In fact, because of the very limited availability of luxury suites, it is advised to book a suite well in advance, as suites are often not available at the last minute. In addition, in coordinating events for larger groups (suites can hold up to 20 guests or more), it is often necessary to give guests a longer lead time to confirm their availability to attend.\n\nAre there additional expenses I should consider?\n\nIf you are hosting guests in your suite, consider allocating enough budget to order catering for your suite. Catering is typically not included in the price of the suite. Suite Experience Group clients typically spend between $1,000-$2,000 for catering, with some clients spending even more if they order significant amounts of alcohol.\n\nAre there discounts if I buy multiple games at once?\n\nSome clients purchase multiple suites in multiple venues at one time. Suite Experience Group can provide special package pricing for clients who buy three or more suites at one time.\n\nHow can I maximize my budget?\n\nIf you are working within a budget and trying to maximize your spend, we would welcome an opportunity to further discuss your goals for the event and the different options available to you. Please call us at 800-592-7043 or fill out this form to get started. We look forward to the opportunity to help you explore your options in renting a luxury suite."
