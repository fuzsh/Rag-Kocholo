        "text": "Despite an 0-3 start, the Nuggets remained positive. Now they are being rewarded.\n\nThey are rewarding themselves, actually, ironing out wrinkles game to game. That culminated in their best performance of the season Wednesday night in a 111-99 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers at the Pepsi Center.\n\n“We’re getting it defensively. Offensively, we’re coming together as well,” said first-year Denver coach Brian Shaw. “Rotation, (I’m) still searching and trying to find combinations, but everything is starting to slowly but surely come together.”\n\nEvery player who has played for the Nuggets is averaging at least 15 minutes per game, which shows Shaw still is searching for productive lineup combinations. Injuries also have hampered Shaw’s ability to pare down the lineup, but Wilson Chandler’s return Wednesday should begin to help with that too.\n\nMostly, though, the Nuggets have shown an ability this week to improve. Rough edges remain as the team continues to get acclimated to life with Shaw, but the players are beginning to see what life will actually look like once they figure things out.\n\n“We’re building on each and every game,” Kenneth Faried said. “People can see we’re getting better each and every game. Guys know their role, and I think Coach did a great job with that, bringing us all in, focusing and telling us this is our role and this is what we need to do.”\n\nThe Nuggets are 3-1 since their 0-3 start. They are averaging 105 points in those four games, shooting 44.5 percent from the field and 38.8 percent from the 3-point line. And they are doing so while keeping the pace high — 100.8 possessions on average in that stretch, a number well above what they finished with last season.\n\nMore balance is coming to the scoring too. Chandler’s 12 points against the Lakers, all on 3-point makes, was essential for a Denver team looking to spread the court more effectively. But after Ty Lawson’s 22-point average during this span, there is balance, with averages of 10 points per game from both Faried and Timofey Mozgov and nearly 10 from Randy Foye.\n\nDefensively, the Nuggets are showing progress too. In their three wins, the Nuggets have held opponents to an average of 95.7 points and 41.9 percent shooting.\n\n“We’re protecting each other on defense,” Chandler said. “Right now it’s still a learning process, but we’ll get better as the season continues.”\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost\n\nMINNESOTA AT DENVER\n\n6 p.m. Friday, ALT/ESPN, 950 AM\n\nSpotlight on Kevin Love: Minnesota’s star forward from UCLA is the main man the Nuggets need to stop at the Pepsi Center. But that task is much easier said than done. Love is off to an all-NBA type of start, with terrific averages of 27.1 points, 14.2 rebounds and 5.1 assists per game.\n\nNOTEBOOK\n\nNuggets: Kenneth Faried is going to get the first crack at guarding Kevin Love, first-year Denver coach Brian Shaw said. Faried will have to guard from the paint to the 3-point line, because the 6-foot-10 Love can score from anywhere on the court. … This is the first of the Nuggets’ second set of back-to-back games. They play Saturday at Houston. The Nuggets have 10 more sets of back-to-back games after this weekend.\n\nTimberwolves: Minnesota is finding a groove defensively to go with a potent offense. The Timberwolves are plus-9 as a team in scoring differential, averaging 108.2 points per game while holding opponents to an average of 99 points. … Corey Brewer, who’s back with Minnesota, played well for the Nuggets last season. He’s off to a good start this season, averaging 14.9 points and nearly two steals per game. Christopher Dempsey, The Denver Post"
