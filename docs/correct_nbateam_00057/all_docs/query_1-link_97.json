        "text": "2014-15\n\nMUNTRADAMUS NBA PREDICTION\n\nBy Muntradamus\n\nBEAST DOME NATION.\n\nEvery season we track my predictions from the start of the season to the end. Last season was rough as both teams I picked dealt with key injuries that eventually lead to both of my teams in Brooklyn and Golden State being knocked out in the playoffs.\n\n2013-14 NBA SEASON PREDICTION\n\nThis season I watched the preseason closer than ever and ready to dominate the 2014-15 season in Daily Fantasy as well as season long. Below are the analysis of each team and their predicted finish in the season. Enjoy.\n\nFOLLOW MY DAILY ACTION ALL SEASON LONG ON\n\nBEASTHEDGE.com\n\nEASTERN CONFERENCE\n\n#15\n\nPHILADELPHIA 76ERS\n\nMCW will miss about two weeks of the season, but this team is in rebuild mode anyways. NERLENS NOEL is ready to be a star and should be primed for easy double-double numbers with Block/Steal combo. TONY WROTEN is a potential star who will get his 30+ Minutes even when MCW returns as he is the future SG of this steam. It is important him and MCW work together, last year they proved the combo to be fine and very athletic. JOEL EMBID is their future, but he will likely sit out the entire season. K.J. MCDANIELS and HOLLIS THOMPSON will get their opportunities, but neither is very good.\n\n#14\n\nINDIANA PACERS\n\nBad season to root for the Pacers. Losing PAUL GEORGE/LANCE STEPHENSON was too much for this team to handle. ROY HIBBERT still looks horrible this preseason and everything will run through DAVID WEST. GEORGE HILL will have a lot on his shoulders, but RODNEY STUCKEY appears to be the guy who can really run the offense and create for others. C.J. MILES needs a big season to keep the Pacers above ground. This is not their season.\n\n#13\n\nORLANDO MAGIC\n\nEasily one of the worst teams in the NBA, the MAGIC are lead by NIKOLA VUCEVIC and his consistent 20/10. After NIKOLA, VICTOR OLADIPO will need to be a consistent scoring option, but he will start the season on the shelf. TOBIAS HARRIS is primed for a breakout season as he did not live up to the potential he set for himself in 2012-13. In the end, this Magic team is not very good and is too young to really compete with the veteran teams of the EAST. Rookie ELFRID PAYTON is at least a year away from being good as he has no shot.\n\n#12\n\nMILWAUKEE BUCKS\n\nThe Bucks are all about JABARI PARKER and what he can do as a rookie. Chances are he will be a star out of the gate as he looked very impressive during the preseason. Log jam at the Guard spots with BRANDON KNIGHT/KENDALL MARSHALL/OJ MAYO/GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO/KHRIS MIDDLETON all fighting for PT. No telling who emerges each night, but you can count on JABARI PARKER being the guy when he is on the court. The Bigs are deep, but all of them lack what it takes to win NBA games. LARRY SANDERS has no offensive game but can put up numbers. JOHN HENSON is the mini-me version of Sanders. ERSAN ILYASOVA has no defensive skills, but he will breakout with a few good scoring nights.\n\n#11\n\nBOSTON CELTICS\n\nRAJON RONDO has a lot of assist options on the rebuilding Celtics. Key addition of EVAN TURNER and MARCUS THORNTON will have this team deeper than ever. The key is the emergence of JARED SULLINGER. He appears ready to be a consistent 20/10 option for Boston which will mean big things for this team. KELLY OLYNK and TYLER ZELLER make one of the weakest defensive front courts in the NBA, but this team can run.\n\n#10\n\nNEW YORK KNICKS\n\nThe Triangle offense will work if they run it through AMARE STOUDEMIRE and not SAMUEL DALEMBERT. The Knicks are going to be all about CARMELO ANTHONY as he takes on the role that made MICHAEL JORDAN and KOBE BRYANT becomes the legends they are today. J.R. SMITH should be better this season as he looked a step slow coming off of knee surgery. IMAN SHUMPERT and TIM HARDAWAY JR. with JOSE CALDERON bring some solid guard play, but in the end it is all about Melo.\n\n#9\n\nATLANTA HAWKS\n\nJEFF TEAGUE is going to have to lead this team that is filled with a great combo of PAUL MILLSAP/AL HORFORD and a range of role players like KYLE KORVER/THABO SEFALOSHA and other swingmen. In the end, the Hawks are deep at the big man spot and swigman spot which be good enough to keep this team strong in the EAST. Jeff Teague is the key for the Hawks success, Paul Millsap and Al Horford are going to be sitting more than you think with the emergence of Mike Scott.\n\n#8\n\nBROOKLYN NETS\n\nDERON WILLIAMS is the pulse to the Nets. Finally healthy, he should be able to lead Brooklyn to a strong season in the EAST. BROOK LOPEZ and his health is always a key factor, especially with ANDRAY BLATCHE playing international. KG is over the hill, but he will show some vintage flashes. JOE JOHNSON will have to be a key scoring option every night with PAUL PIERCE now on Washington.\n\n#7\n\nTORONTO RAPTORS\n\nOne of the best teams in the EAST simply with teamwork did not do anything to improve. KYLE LOWRY and DEMAR DEROZAN are the leaders of this team, but JONAS VALANCUINAS/AMIR JOHNSON/PATRICK PATTERSON make this team one of the most interesting in the EAST as a lot of people cannot matchup with that trio. TERRENCE ROSS/GREVIS VASQUEZ have become key role players on this team.\n\n#6\n\nMIAMI HEAT\n\nAll eyes will be on DWYANE WADE to see if he can carry the HEAT with no more LEBRON JAMES. CHRIS BOSH has big shoes to fill as he needs to resort to his Toronto Raptor days for this team to have a chance. LUOL DENG will need to be the most consistent player he has ever been in his career for the HEAT to make a run in the EAST. Chances are, DWYANE WADE will rise to the occasion and we will see him play a lot more games and minutes than we expect. The addition of JOSH MCROBERTS will help a lot more than people think as he does everything nobody else can.\n\n#5\n\nWASHINGTON WIZARDS\n\nJOHN WALL leads a BRADLEY BEAL-less team to start the year. WIZARDS have nice size with NENE HILARIO and MARCIN GORTAT. PAUL PIERCE is on to replace TREVOR ARIZA and if the Wizards can make the playoffs, JOHN WALL can take this team anywhere. BRADLEY BEAL needs to be vintage coming off of a broken hand.\n\n#4\n\nCHARLOTTE HORNETS\n\nLANCE STEPHENSON was a huge addition to give this team a true slasher. Something this team missed all of last season and made KEMBA WALKER do more than he was really capable of. With Kemba playing more off the ball and Lance running the show, the Hornets become a much more dangerous squad. The addition of MARVIN WILLIAMS also helps a lot on paper as this team will really be able to stretch the floor and set up Al Jefferson for a lot of ISO situations on the block. GERALD HENDERSON could easily be 6th man of the year in the EAST if he plays anywhere near the way he played the last two seasons for this team.\n\n#3\n\nDETROIT PISTONS\n\nBrining in Stan Van Gundy and plenty of talented players like CARON BUTLER/DJ AUGUSTIN/CARTIER MARTIN will mean that nobody has a safe grasp of their job. GREG MONROE is the best offensive player on the team, but he will come off the bench. ANDRE DRUMMOND should grow to the next level, JOSH SMITH is the utility superstar that will be on the court no matter what happens. Pistons are ready to make the playoffs again, and have the size to dominate.\n\n#2\n\nCHICAGO BULLS\n\nDERRICK ROSE is 100% and ready to roll for the Bulls. The addition of PAU GASOL is going to hurt this Bulls squad as he is not a team player and brings awful defense to the equation. JOAKIM NOAH will need to be among the league leaders in Rebounds and TAJ GIBSON will have a bigger role than Pau as the season continues. JIMMY BUTLER appears ready to take the next step as a consistent scoring option. Bulls have what it takes to win the EAST, but all of it depends on the health of Rose.\n\n#1\n\nCLEVELAND CAVALIERS\n\nLEBRON JAMES is easily the best player in the NBA right now. He is 100% unguardable and will be able to do whatever he wants this season. KYRIE IRVING is too good with the lack of defensive attention he will be getting. DION WAITERS is too good for the lack of defensive attention he will be getting. Expect Dion to bomb a lot of 3PT shots all seasong long. KEVIN LOVE will still be a 20/10 player, but those 30/15 games will be more rare than they were for Minnesota. ANDERSON VAREJAO and TRISTAN THOMPSON will be splitting a lot of time, both looking good this preseason.\n\nPLAYOFFS\n\nROUND 1\n\n#1\n\nCLEVELAND CAVALIERS\n\nvs.\n\n#8\n\nBROOKLYN NETS\n\nWith nobody able to guard Lebron and Love/Irving having whatever they want. Brooklyn has no chance in this series unless Brook Lopez can score 40 a game. I do not see that happening as the Cavs advance.\n\nWINNER: CLEVELAND CAVALIERS\n\n#2\n\nCHICAGO BULLS\n\nvs.\n\n#7\n\nTORONTO RAPTORS\n\nRaptors cannot compete with the size of the Bulls. DEROZAN has problems with Jimmy Butler and his swarming defense. Chicago Bulls advance.\n\nWINNER: CHICAGO BULLS\n\n#3\n\nDETROIT PISTONS\n\nvs.\n\n#6\n\nMIAMI HEAT\n\nHeat do not have the size to conatin all of the Pistons bigs. Detroit advances easily as we remember how weak Chris Bosh has become.\n\nWINNER: DETROIT PISONS\n\n#4\n\nCHARLOTTE HORNETS\n\nvs.\n\n#5\n\nWASHINGTON WIZARDS\n\nAl Jefferson does what he can to dominate the game, but Nene/Gortat with the scoring guards of Beal and Wall are too much for the Hornets to handle. John Wall controls the series and the Wizards advance.\n\nWINNER: WASHINGTON WIZARDS\n\nROUND 2\n\n#1\n\nCLEVELAND CAVALIERS\n\nvs.\n\n#5\n\nWASHINGTON WIZARDS\n\nLebron James cannot be guarded which is too much for the Wizards. With Lebron doing what he wants, it allows the rest of the team to do what they want. Too much for John wall to carry, Cavs advance.\n\nWINNER: CLEVELAND CAVALIERS\n\n#2\n\nCHICAGO BULLS\n\nvs.\n\n#3\n\nDETROIT PISTONS\n\nDerrick Rose will have his way, but the size of the Pistons make this series interesting. The key is Brandon Jennings being his vintage self, which is no lock. The Pistons just barely lose the series and the Bulls advance to face the Cavs.\n\nWINNER: CHICAGO BULLS\n\nEASTERN CONFRENCE FINALS\n\n#1\n\nCLEVELAND CAVALIERS\n\nvs.\n\n#2\n\nCHICAGO BULLS\n\nGame is not as good as it looks. Lebron James once again does whatever he wants, which allows everyone on the Cavs to do what they want with wide open opportunities all game long. Cavs advance to finals and everyone forgets about burning his jersey when he left.\n\nWINNER: CLEVELAND CAVALIERS\n\nWESTERN CONFERENCE\n\n#15\n\nMINNESOTA TIMBERWOLVES\n\nThis Timberwolves squad is all about seeing what their future is going to be. ANDREW WIGGINS/ZACH LAVINE/SHABAZZ MUHAMMAD should all get plenty of looks off the bench as RICKY RUBIO/KEVIN MARTIN/THADDEUS YOUNG lead the starting unit. NIKOLA PEKOVIC is going to be on minutes watch as his ankle/foot injury is chronic and going to limit the rest of his career. GORGUI DIENG is the future at Center for the team, but be aware of former #1 pick ANTHONY BENNETT as he gets his best shot to be part of a rotation.\n\n#14\n\nMEMPHIS GRIZZILES\n\nMIKE CONLEY is running the show of a team that struggles from the wing spots. COURTNEY LEE and VINCE CARTER will be asked to do what MIKE CONLEY cannot do as far as scoring from the outside. ZACH RANDOLPH and MARC GASOL was once the best big man duo in the NBA. Those days are done as ZACH RANDOLPH and his knees are completely cashed. MARC GASOL is looking good with the lost weight, but he is not good enough to carry this team in the very strong West.\n\n#13\n\nSACRAMENTO KINGS\n\nRUDY GAY will need a breakout season along with DEMARCUS COUSINS to bring the Kings to the playoffs. A nice addition of DARREN COLLISON will keep this team fighting, along with RAMON SESSIONS for depth. Like I said, it all comes down to COUSINS and GAY, and the deep PF spot in REGGIE EVANS/JASON THOMPSON/CARL LANDRY to keep everything fresh.\n\n#12\n\nUTAH JAZZ\n\nUtah is entering the season in mid-season form as they played their starters all preseason like the season started today. GORDON HAYWARD is primed for a breakout year, as well as DERRICK FAVORS/ENES KANTER/TREY BURKE. The addition of DANTE EXUM will bring a nice option for ALEC BURKS off the bench if BURKS does not play strong everyday. Which is likely the case.\n\n#11\n\nLOS ANGELES LAKERS\n\nLakers are built around Kobe scoring 40+ Points every night. CARLOS BOOZER was an upgrade over PAU, and JEREMY LIN is probably the best PG the Lakers have had since Nick Van Exel. JORDAN HILL/ED DAVIS/JULIUS RANDLE all bring good depth at the big man position, and NICK YOUNG/XAVIER HENRY bring good wing depth behind WESLEY JOHNSON. In the end, this is the KOBE show as he goes for the All-Time scoring record. Which he will break on Christmas day in Chicago.\n\n#10\n\nPHOENIX SUNS\n\nSuns did a great job adding ISAIAH THOMAS to an already deep squad. GORAN DRAGIC/ERIC BLEDSOE and THOMAS bring the best back court in the NBA, and wing options in GERALD GREEN/P.J. TUCKER will keep this team very athletic. MARKIEFF MORRIS/MARCUS MORRIS/MILES PLUMLEE will welcome ALEX LEN to the rotation, but MARKIEFF is by far the most dominant and he needs to be on the court 30+ Minutes a night.\n\n#9\n\nSAN ANTONIO SPURS\n\nThe Spurs are getting old, but the Pop System will always have this team in the thick of the Western Confrence. Some can say the West is finally too good and too athletic for the Spurs Duncan/Parker to continue their stardom. While I agree with all of that for the most part, you have to expect the Spurs to make the playoffs no matter what (DID NOT FIT IN MY PLAYOFFS AFTER PLACEMENT). KAWHI LEONARD is one of the most overrated Fantasy Players in the game today going in the 2nd round of some drafts. He will not be a consistent star.\n\n#8\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY THUNDER\n\nRUSSELL WESTBROOK will have to carry the THUNDER early as KEVIN DURANT misses at least 5 Weeks with a foot injury. Outside of DURANT and WESTBROOK, only REGGIE JACKSON can really create for himself. SERGE IBAKA will need to be more consistent with his shot, something tells me he will be the same as always. STEVEN ADAMS should emerge as the starting Center, but the Thunder are just not that great of a team as it is a bunch of role players with two stars who do not work that great with eachother.\n\n#7\n\nNEW ORLEANS PELICANS\n\nWith ANTHONY DAVIS taking the next, the PELICANS should take the next step and reach the playoffs. The addition of OMER ASIK allows Anthony Davis to play off the glass more which should create more block shot/steals from the blindside. TYREKE EVANS has a crucial role on the team as the backup PG starting SF and he should remain vintage from last season. JRUE HOLIDAY returns and is a little less than 100% after knee surgery. ERIC GORDON remains a stud and RYAN ANDERSON off the bench has the PELICANS as deep as ever.\n\n#6\n\nHOUSTON ROCKETS\n\nLosing CHANDLER PARSONS/JEREMY LIN/OMER ASIK for the hope of CHRIS BOSH really hurt this team. JAMES HARDEN and DWIGHT HOWARD are going to have to run the show while role players like TREVOR ARIZA and TERRANCE JONES need career years to keep the Rockets a team to fear. PATRICK BEVERLY plays great defense, but the backup guards in ISAIAH CANAAN and TROY DANIELS are much better shooters. JEFF ADRIEN is a guy to keep an eye on as he is a special player.\n\n#5\n\nDENVER NUGGETS\n\nTY LAWSON owns the car keys to this deep offense. ARRON AFFLALO/RANDY FOYE will rotate at SG. DANILO GALLINARI/WILSON CHANDLER will rotate at SF. KENNETH FARIED/JJ HICKSON will rotate at PF. TIMMY MOZGOV/JAVALE MCGEE will rotate at Center. There is no deeper team in the NBA. NATE ROBINSON off the bench is a weapon as well.\n\n#4\n\nDALLAS MAVERICKS\n\nJAMEER NELSON/DEVIN HARRIS/MONTA ELLIS will all split the backcourt as a trio. DIRK NOWITZKI still has something left in the tank, fantasy wise will not get many rebounds now that TYSON CHANDLER is there to control the paint. Should allow DIRK to have more energy. CHANDLER PARSONS is the best SF this team has had in a while after rolling with SHAWN MARION year after year. Dallas is primed for a big season with a lot of depth, losing VINCE CARTER will hurt come playoff time.\n\n#3\n\nGOLDEN STATE WARRIORS\n\nWarriors bringing in Steve Kerr will make this offense better than what it is. KLAY THOMPSON is ready to take the next step in his NBA career now that he is putting the ball on the floor. ANDRE IGUODALA is on his last legs, but HARRISON BARNES is ready to fill in. STEPH CURRY will be a BEAST, but the addition of SHAUN LIVINGSTON will hurt more than it helps as far as assists go. ANDREW BOGUT feels healthy, but DRAYMOND GREEN seems poised for a larger role after a big preseason. DAVID LEE will remain consistent and the Warriors are a team that can make a run.\n\n#2\n\nPORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS\n\nDAMIAN LILLARD/LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE/NICOLAS BATUM/WESLEY MATTHEWS/ROBIN LOPEZ is the closest thing to the best starting 5 in the NBA. With the addition of former Lakers STEVE BLAKE and CHRIS KAMAN, make the Blazerz a deep team with scoring options off the bench. All of this should add up to one of the best Portland seasons in some time. Not a lot of teams will be able to hang with this squad.\n\n#1\n\nLOS ANGELES CLIPPERS\n\nCP3/BLAKE GRIFFIN/DEANDRE JORDAN/JAMAL CRAWFORD. Those 4 are the most underrated big 4 of the NBA today as not a lot of teams can compete with that. As long as the role players in J.J. REDICK/SPENCER HAWES/MATT BARNES do their jobs, the Clippers should run away with the West and easily the NBA Championship. The addition of JORDAN FARMAR is another big underground move.\n\nPLAYOFFS\n\nROUND 1\n\n#1\n\nLOS ANGELES CLIPPERS\n\nvs.\n\n#8\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY THUNDER\n\nTough opening round matchup for the Clippers. This season they are ready to beat the Thunder as OKC did nothing to improve while the Clippers added Hawkes and a lot of other weapons. No Donald Sterling distractions for this team.\n\nWinner: LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS\n\n#2\n\nPORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS\n\nvs.\n\n#7\n\nNEW ORLEANS PELICANS\n\nAs good as the Pelicans are going to be this season, thiey are not ready to beat the Blazers in the playoffs. Anthony Davis does his thing, but the Blazers are too strong with their added depth which proves to be too much.\n\nWINNER: PORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS\n\n#3\n\nGOLDEN STATE WARRIORS\n\nvs.\n\n#6\n\nHOUSTON ROCKETS\n\nDwight and Harden cannot put up enough points against the Splash brothers and company. Expect Andre Iguodala to play vintage defense on James Harden and it will come down to Andrew Bogut being healthy for the Warriors to slow down Dwight who does not do wella gainst people his own size.\n\nWinner: GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS\n\n#4\n\nDALLAS MAVERICKS\n\nvs.\n\n#5\n\nDENVER NUGGETS\n\nHard fought battle on both sides. Nuggest depth is what sets them apart from the Mavericks as Dirk Nowitzki has trouble againt Faried and the Nuggest advance.\n\nWinner: DENVER NUGGETS\n\nROUND 2\n\n#1\n\nLOS ANGELES CLIPPERS\n\nvs.\n\n#5\n\nDENVER NUGGETS\n\nAs deep as the Nuggest are, Chris Paul and the Clippers are too good as Blake Griffin can dominate this team whenever he wants. Nuggest make it interesting, but Clippers keep on rolling.\n\nWinner: LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS\n\n#2\n\nPORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS\n\nvs.\n\n#3\n\nGOLDEN STATE WARRIORS\n\nWhile the Warriors can bomb away from 3PT land, the Blazers are a much stronger well-rounded team that can beat you a various of ways. Damian Lillard does whatever he wants to Steph Curry as well as Aldridge dominating David Lee. Warriors season ends short.\n\nWINNER: PORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS\n\nWESTERN CONFRENCE FINALS\n\n#1\n\nLOS ANGELES CLIPPERS\n\nvs.\n\n#2\n\nPORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS\n\nClippers are too good for the Blazers especially when it comes to CP3. Both teams are very strong, but DeAndre Jordan and his size with the better shooting and better depth of the Clippers is a little too much.\n\nWinner: LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS\n\nNBA FINALS\n\n#1\n\nLOS ANGELES CLIPPERS\n\nvs.\n\n#1\n\nCLEVELAND CAVALIERS\n\nWhile Lebron of course can do whatever he wants, the Clippers have a lot more size than the Cavs. On top of that, the Clippers also have a much deeper bench. This is the season for the Clippers to win it as they may never have a team like this again, in the history of the franchise if they do not win it this season. Last seasont they were robbed by TMZ, this season there is nothing blocking their path.\n\nNBA CHAMPIONS\n\nLOS ANGELES CLIPPERS\n\nMVP: LEBRON JAMES\n\nROOKIE OF THE YEAR: JABARI PARKER\n\n6th MAN OF THE YEAR: JAMAL CRAWFORD\n\nNBA 1st TEAM\n\nPG: CHRIS PAUL\n\nSG: KOBE BRYANT\n\nSF: LEBRON JAMES\n\nPF: BLAKE GRIFFIN\n\nC: DEMARCUS COUSINS\n\nNBA 2nd TEAM\n\nPG: STEPH CURRY\n\nSG: JAMES HARDEN\n\nSF: KEVIN DURANT\n\nPF: ANTHONY DAVIS\n\nC: AL JEFFERSON\n\nNBA 3rd TEAM\n\nPG: RUSSELL WESTBROOK\n\nSG: DWYANE WADE\n\nSF: CARMELO ANTHONY\n\nPF: LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE"
