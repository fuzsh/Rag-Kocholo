Yes, I said it.\n\nOn Thursday night, four teams agreed to a deal that will send Dwight Howard to the Lakers. As of now, this is what the deal looks like:\n\nLakers: Dwight Howard\n\nPhilly: Jason Richardson and Andrew Bynum\n\nDenver: Andre Iguodala\n\nOrlando Arron Afflalo, Al Harrington, Nikola Vucevic, Moe Harkless, and one protected future first-round pick from each of the other three teams.\n\nOther names may emerge by the time the deal is finalized, but the Lakers have pulled off the unthinkable. First, it was Steve Nash. And now, they have the best center in the league. The Lakers might be the first team in NBA history to have four All-Stars in their starting line-up! Are you kidding me? Here is the projected starting line-up.\n\nPG: Steve Nash, SG: Kobe Bryant, SF: Metta World-Peace, PF: Pau Gasol, C: Dwight Howard\n\nThis is absolutely ridiculous. This is unreal. This is crazy! The Lakers have three future-HALL OF FAMERS in their starting lineup! I know I picked the Thunder as the #1 seed in the West but the Lakers are my new top seed in the Western Conference.\n\nNot to mention, the Lakers still have depth with Antawn Jamison, Steve Blake, and Jordan Hill. After watching Kobe yesterday against Australia, I think it is safe to say that he is still an elite player in the NBA. With the addition of Nash and Howard, the Lakers will be a dominant force.\n\nThis is the perfect mix for a championship. The Canadian has the ability to get Dwight and Kobe their touches while managing to keep Gasol happy. Pau will definitely have to agree to take on a smaller role but I think that will lead to a higher efficiency rate.\n\nLA now has two elite veterans in the backcourt and the 26 year old down low in the paint. The Lakers have improved in every single category over this off-season. Dwight Howard will help lead the Lakers to another championship.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers have instantly become favorites to win the championship.

He had a pretty awful first half with just two points and a couple turnovers. The second half was quite different.\n\nAustralia went on an 11-0 run to start the third quarter and the Americans appeared to be in trouble. Clinging to just a six point lead, Bryant was able to make his first three pointer of the game. On the very next possession, Kobe stole the ball giving the United States a fast break. He pulled up from beyond the arc and nailed another three.\n\nAustralia was forced to call a Timeout, which presumably would slow down the “Black Mamba”. But Kobe was not done. Just about halfway through the fourth quarter, Bryant made four three pointers in a row in just a fifty-six second span! That was the dagger!\n\nAfter the game, Kobe was asked what helped him get out of his ten quarter slump. He said that he got angry. When asked if he was angry about playing Argentina next, he responded, “Livid.”\n\nBut I respect the Australians performance. Australia was able to stay with the Americans for three quarters. They were only down fourteen going into the fourth and they had it down to six at one point in the third quarter. Back-up San Antonio Spurs point guard Patty Mills led the team with twenty-six points. But Team USA just has too many All-Stars and LeBron James is one of them.\n\nLeBron was absolutely masterful even though he only converted three field goals. He had his first triple double in Olympic history! James scored 11 points, 11 assists, and 14 rebounds. Might I add that he also did not record even one turnover! He did it all.\n\nLeBron’s performance was riveting and he was seeing the court just as well as Magic Johnson did back in the day. There were two plays where James was on the wing and was able to find a three-point shooter in the weak side corner for wide open buckets. He is so big that he has the length to pass it over the defense. James also had a spectacular pass in the first half when he placed the ball perfectly through the defender’s legs finding Carmelo Anthony who got the “and one”.\n\nJames is 6’8” but was running around the court like he was Steve Nash in his prime. And at the same time, he was able to lead the team with fourteen rebounds including three on the offensive end of the court. I used to hate “King James” but I just cannot dislike the guy anymore. He is amazingly talented and is the MVP of this Olympic team.\n\nSo after a sluggish first half, Team USA was able to trounce Australia 119-86 and move into the semi-finals. Lithuania was close to defeating the Americans earlier this week but they lost to Russia earlier today. So at this point, only a miracle could stop Team USA from winning the gold medal.\n\nAfter having an atrocious last few games in the Olympics, Kobe Bryant was able to find his killer instinct.

Lithuania was close to defeating the Americans earlier this week but they lost to Russia earlier today. So at this point, only a miracle could stop Team USA from winning the gold medal.\n\nEarlier this week I predicted the top eight seeds in the Eastern Conference next year. Now it’s time to get to work on my Western Conference predictions. Post your picks in the comment section. Let the debate begin!\n\n#1. Oklahoma City Thunder– After last year’s loss in the NBA Finals, Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook cannot wait for the season to start. With the same core of players, we should expect similar results. And with more playoff experience, I expect this young team to learn from their mistakes. The Thunder are the most talented team in the West. Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook are hungrier than ever, and this team still has great size with Kendrick Perkins, Serge Ibaka, and Nick Collison. Projection: 61-21\n\n#2. Los Angeles Lakers– After a disappointing post-season in 2012, the Lakers went out and got veteran point guard Steve Nash to join Kobe Bryant in the backcourt. This team has become extremely dangerous with Gasol and Bynum down low, and the addition of Antawn Jamison. If Nash and Kobe can stay healthy, the Lakers will be a serious contender. Projection: 57-25\n\n#3. San Antonio Spurs– The Spurs tied for the best record in the NBA last year. However, they are all now a year older, which draws some concern for Tim Duncan. Without Duncan, this team is significantly worse and I just don’t see Timmy having another spectacular year. He’ll average 12 points and 8 rebounds but wont be the same guy we are all used to seeing. San Antonio will still be a good team led by Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili. Projection: 52-30\n\n#4. Los Angeles Clippers: The Clippers look great on paper and should be able to repeat a successful season. Chris Paul is the best point guard in the League, and the big man combo consisting of Blake Griffin and Deandre Jordan, have welcomed CP3 to Lob City. The Clips have a solid back up for every single position including power forward, now that Lamar Odom has returned to the team that drafted him. If Billups and Crawford can play consistently at the 2 guard, this team could surprise people come playoff time. Projection: 51-31\n\n#5. Memphis Grizzlies: The Grizzlies are a solid team and Zach Randolph has become an elite power forward. Marc Gasol is one of the better big men in the league, Tony Allen is a stifling defender, and Mike Conley is a solid point guard. Oh, and they have Rudy Gay too who is an absolute stud. However, the Grizzlies do not have a deep bench. My biggest concern for them is that they are not deep enough. If Memphis wants to make some noise in the post-season, they will have to lean on Gay and Randolph. Projection: 49-33\n\n#6. Denver Nuggets: George Karl will lead another mediocre Denver team to the post-season yet again. With no superstar, the Nuggets are a great example of a team that thrives off of team work. Denver is lethal from downtown and led the league in points per game last year. But this team still needs work, especially on the defensive side of the court. Ty Lawson will have his best season yet. Projection: 44-38\n\n#7. Utah Jazz: After losing Deron Williams, everyone assumed that the Jazz were a sinking ship. However, Utah still made the playoffs last year and I believe they will do it again in 2013. Al Jefferson and Paul Millsap are great big guys to have and the acquisition of Marvin Williams has filled the small forward position. Mo Williams will start at point guard and will have to keep the big guys involved if Utah wants to sneak into the playoffs. Projection: 43-39\n\n#8. Minnesota Timberwolves: The Wolves had a great offense last year led by Ricky Rubio and Olympiad Kevin Love. Love is one of the best rebounders in the league and Rubio can be great assuming that he is healthy. With many up and coming youngsters on the roster such as Derrick Williams, Alexy Shved, and Robbie Hummel of Purdue, this team should be exciting to watch. And the addition of Andre Kirilenko will help the Timberwolves get past the Hornets, Mavs, and Warriors, for the last seed in the Western Conference. Projection: 42-40"
