        "text": "#Innovation lessons from the National Basketball Association (NBA): My Miami HEAT are in the NBA finals. It didn't seem to matter how well the Heat were playing. It didn't matter how much harder they worked than their opponents. It didn't matter how well they shot the ball, passed, defended... Every conversation seemed to focus on two things: They're the eighth seed and they have a lot of undrafted players. The conversation around my team through the first 20 games of their playoff run is a good reminder of why innovation is so hard in established corporate environments. It's because people are TERRIBLE at evaluating and predicting potential. Most of the \"objective\" measures we apply to grade potential, talent, and ability are about FIT (how well something adheres to our status quo understanding of what good looks like). So when a product, a service, or even a basketball team comes in with a unique understanding of how to play and how to win they get disrespected. They get discounted. Until, of course, everybody else gets disrupted. Shout out to Jimmy Butler and the Miami Heat, the most innovative team in basketball."
