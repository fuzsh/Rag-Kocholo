With a roster ravaged by injury, the Milwaukee Bucks have traded backup point guard Steve Blake to the Denver Nuggets for fan favourite Earl Boykins, guard Julius Hodge and cash on Thursday.

With starting point guard Mo Williams sidelined for weeks with a shoulder injury, the Bucks needed to address their backcourt woes to turn around their recent four-game slide and stay in playoff contention.

Boykins, one of the NBA's smallest players at five-foot-five and 133 pounds, played a little over three years for Denver and was averaging 15.2 points this season.

His trade value had increased with more minutes due to the absence of Carmelo Anthony and J.R. Smith serving suspensions for their roles in a brawl against the New York Knicks. But with Denver's acquisition of all-star guard Allen Iverson in a trade, Boykins's future with the team became unclear.

"Earl's performance during our 'suspension season' has been sensational," said Mark Warkentien, theNuggets' vice-president of basketball operations. "He's done a heck of a job."

Hodge recently returned to the Denver lineup after he wasshot five times last April when a gunman pulled up alongside his vehicleand sprayedit with bullets. The former first-round pick has played in four games this season.

Blake averaged 3.6 points and 2.5 assists in 33 games for the Bucks this season.

"We're getting a classic point guard," Warkentien said. "He's an outstanding shooter and solid floor leader."
