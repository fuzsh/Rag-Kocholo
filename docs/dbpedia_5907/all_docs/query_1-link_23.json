        "text": "*This article was sponsored by Seibu Railway.\n\nWhat Is the SEIBU 1 Day Pass?\n\nThe SEIBU 1 Day Pass is a special ticket granting unlimited rides for a day on Seibu train lines in and around Tokyo (excluding the Tamagawa line; limited express trains require additional fare). It’s available only to international travelers and expats in Japan, and offers a great deal on transport to several popular sightseeing spots in the greater Tokyo outskirts, including Chichibu and Kawagoe.\n\nHow to Purchase and Use the SEIBU 1 Day Pass\n\nThe easiest way to get the SEIBU 1 Day Pass is online. After purchasing it and arriving in Japan, head to Ikebukuro Station to present your QR code with your passport or residence card to staff at the SEIBU Tourist Information Center Ikebukuro, who will give you your physical pass. This pass is then valid for a day of your choosing within the following two weeks.\n\nTo use the SEIBU 1 Day Pass, simply present it to the station attendant each time you enter and exit the ticket gates on Seibu lines. The first time you enter, the attendant will stamp your pass with the current date, kicking off its use. With the pass in hand, you’ll be able to freely ride Seibu local and express trains without any extra costs.\n\n・What About Limited Express Trains (Tokkyu)?\n\nTo ride the faster and more luxurious Seibu limited express trains like the Laview and Red Arrow, you’ll need to purchase a separate limited express ticket. These tickets are available at the SEIBU Tourist Information Center Ikebukuro, so you can arrange them while picking up your pass, or you can buy them at other designated ticket counters. A list of stations with ticket counters and prices is available here.\n\n・Can I Buy a 1 Day Pass Without Ordering Online?\n\nSEIBU 1 Day Passes can be purchased on the spot at the SEIBU Tourist Information Center Ikebukuro, or at the limited express ticket counters of Seibu-Shinjuku Station and Ikebukuro Station (1st floor, 1st basement floor). However, unlike the online tickets, these are valid only for the day of purchase (no two-week leeway), and are inserted into the ticket gate like a regular train ticket.\n\n・Other SEIBU Passes\n\nThose with fuller itineraries may also consider the SEIBU 2 Day Pass, which is valid two days from the date of purchase. It is sold at the SEIBU Tourist Information Center Ikebukuro and at the limited express ticket counters of Seibu-Shinjuku Station and Ikebukuro Station (1st floor, 1st basement floor), and is not available online.\n\nWhile this may all feel a bit overwhelming, the SEIBU Tourist Information Center Ikebukuro has English and Chinese-speaking staff on hand to guide you through each step. They can also help you arrange limited express tickets, and tell you which stations to get off at, so be sure to stop by before setting out on your Tokyo day trip!\n\nRecommended Tokyo Day Trips #1: Chichibu\n\nSeibu-Chichibu Station: A Gateway to Natural Wonders and Vintage Streetscapes\n\nSeibu-Chichibu Station is located in the center of Chichibu, a small city in Saitama Prefecture on the border of the Tokyo outskirts. Chichibu is rich in otherworldly natural sceneries, from carpets of flowers to giant icicles, making it a popular getaway from the dense Tokyo cityscape.\n\nHow to Get to Seibu-Chichibu Station\n\nThe smoothest way to reach Seibu-Chichibu Station from Tokyo is on the Limited Express Laview train, which departs from Ikebukuro Station and takes around 77 minutes at the quickest. Being a limited express train, you’ll need to purchase a limited express ticket in addition to your SEIBU 1 Day Pass. The price for this ticket from Ikebukuro Station to Seibu-Chichibu Station is 900 yen one way (adult).\n\nTo avoid paying extra, pass holders can also take the express train (kyuko) until Hanno Station, and then switch to a local train, which will take about 1 hour and 40 minutes.\n\nRecommended Spots Around Seibu-Chichibu Station\n\nHitsujiyama Park\n\nWhile many line up their visits to Japan with its cherry blossoms, moss phlox is another springtime spectacle worth adding to your itinerary. Known as “shibazakura” in Japanese, these flowers smother the ground in colorful carpets of pink, light blue, white, and more.\n\nBacked by the imposing Mt. Buko, Hitsujiyama Park in Chichibu is home to one of Japan’s best moss phlox gardens. Over 400,000 flowers of around 10 varieties engulf the gentle slopes of the roughly 17,600 m² plot in swirling patchwork flowerbeds. Colors generally appear from mid-April and peak around late April, offering a worthy follow-up to the park’s early to mid-April cherry blossoms. The Shibazakura Festival is held to celebrate, hosting farmers markets and activities like horse-riding, sheep-shearing, and more.\n\nAshigakubo Icicles\n\nWhile much of Tokyo remains mild during winter, Chichibu’s mountain basin terrain ushers in exceptionally harsh cold, creating phenomena like the Misotsuchi Icicles and Ashigakubo Icicles. While the isolated Misotsuchi Icicles are best visited by car, the Ashigakubo Icicles are just a 10-minute walk from Ashigakubo Station, two stops from Seibu-Chichibu Station (covered by the SEIBU 1 Day Pass).\n\nThe Ashigakubo Icicles appear between early January and late February, burying the hills in countless ice mounds of all shapes and sizes, reaching up to 30 meters in height. While made artificially by spraying water over the trees, the icicles are molded by the natural forces of winter, and are a powerful demonstration of Chichibu’s intense climate.\n\nOn Friday and weekend evenings, the Ashigakubo Icicles are also illuminated by colorful lights, making them shine like glittering jewels.\n\nNagatoro River Boat Cruise\n\nJust north of Chichibu City, the Nagatoro Valley is another of the region’s marvels. It cradles the upper reaches of the Arakawa River, one of Tokyo’s most famous rivers, and is lined by natural monuments such as the Iwadatami, a series of flat river-eroded rocks said to resemble tatami mats.\n\nVisitors can freely explore Iwadatami on foot, but a more exciting way to tour Nagatoro is on one of its famous traditional boat cruises! Visitors are taken along the river in simple wooden boats navigated by boatmen using long bamboo sticks as paddles. There are two routes to choose from, both spanning different sections of the river, and each taking roughly 20 minutes.\n\nThe A Course is notorious for its rip-roaring rapids, making it the go-to for thrill-seekers. It also passes under the Arakawa Bridge, a stately brick and granite train bridge built in 1914 still in use today; as well as the Chichibu Red Cliff and turtle-shaped Kamenoko Rock before finishing at Iwadatami. The B Course starts at Iwadatami and heads for a wider section of the river, presenting a plethora of oddly shaped rocks and photogenic wilderness, with its own set of rapids to boot.\n\nChichibu Shrine and the Retro Chichibu City\n\nMany visit Chichibu seeking wilderness, but its urban side has plenty of charm, too. The 15-minute walk from Seibu-Chichibu Station to the prestigious Chichibu Shrine is dotted with evocative vintage buildings presenting a time capsule of Japan’s late Taisho (1912-1926) and early Showa (1926-1989) periods.\n\nMany of these historical tidbits are concentrated around Bamba Street, and include the stylish light pink weatherboarded Former Katayama Clinic, the rustic cornerside Former Koike Tobacco Shop, and the chic Old Otsuki Ryokan Annex. Be sure to also pop into the Paris Shokudo eatery, which opened in 1927 and still serves casual Western-Japanese fusion dishes today.\n\nAfter you’ve finished wandering, head to the end of Bamba Street to find Chichibu Shrine. Marked by a majestic stone torii gate, the grounds hold an array of dazzling vermillion structures centered around the main shrine, whose colorful carvings flaunt a striking contrast to its solemn character.\n\nChichibu Shrine is believed to have a history of over 2,100 years, making it one of the oldest shrines in the Kanto region, and its current main building was constructed by order of Tokugawa Ieyasu (1543-1616), the founder of the Tokugawa Shogunate. It plays a central role in the Chichibu Night Festival, one of Japan’s three big float festivals, and is a treasured icon of the local community.\n\nChichibu Fruit Picking\n\nFor more active travelers, Chichibu has several fruit farms with fruit picking experiences. One of the most accessible is Chichibu Fruit Farm, a roughly 25-minute walk from Seibu-Chichibu Station, which grows a variety of strawberries ready to be picked between mid-December and late May, and grapes in early September to mid-October. If you have access to a car, there are plenty of other options out in rural Chichibu too, giving lovers of fresh fruit plenty to pick!\n\nMatsuri no Yu Hot Spring\n\nWhether it’s escaping the bone-chilling cold, or freshening up after a stroll, a soothing soak in the vibrant and festive Matsuri no Yu Hot Spring promises a blissful end to your Chichibu day tripーall right next to Seibu-Chichibu Station!\n\nInspired by the colors and jovial spirit of the Chichibu Night Festival, Matsuri no Yu’s wide selection of hot springs includes open-air rock baths, lie-down baths, carbonated baths, jet-bubble baths, and more, presenting a multitude of ways to warm up and heal. There are also saunas, bedrock baths, and a lounge, plus shops sellings regional specialities, a bar serving local sake, wine, and craft beer, and a food court specializing in Chichibu dishes like miso-marinated pork.\n\nRecommended Tokyo Day Trips #2: Kawagoe\n\nHon-Kawagoe Station: Dive Into Retro Japan\n\nHon-Kawagoe Station is just a 15-minute walk to the old streets of Kawagoeーone of Tokyo’s premier day-trip destinations. Whether it’s history, shopping, sightseeing, or dining, Kawagoe has plenty to fill your itinerary with. While often crowded, with heavy traffic on the main road, countless offshoot laneways conceal peaceful nooks holding all manner of hidden treasures, rewarding the curious traveler.\n\nHow to Get to Hon-Kawagoe Station\n\nHon-Kawagoe Station can be reached directly from Seibu-Shinjuku Station on the Limited Express Red Arrow (Koedo) train, which takes approximately 44 minutes. Those with SEIBU 1 Day Passes will need to buy a limited express ticket to board this train.\n\nAlternatively, for no extra charge, SEIBU 1 Day Pass holders can opt for the express train (kyuko) bound for Hon-Kawagoe Station on the Seibu Shinjuku Line, which will take around an hour.\n\nThe Edo Period Streets of Kawagoe\n\nAs you walk from Hon-Kawagoe Station, you’ll feel time rewinding as the modern facade grows older and older, eventually stopping at the Edo Period (1603-1868) townscape at its heart.\n\nOnce a prosperous merchant town, Kawagoe is one of Japan’s most well-preserved historical districts, best known for its traditional “kura” warehouse-style architecture. Kura have thick plaster walls and are heavily fireproofed, and many were built in Kawagoe following a fire that ravaged the town in 1893.\n\nUnlike the white kura seen in much of Japan, Kawagoe kura are mostly black, with heavy and ornate roof tiles and thick window shutters, giving them a solemn appearance. These magnificent structures can be seen throughout Kawagoe's Warehouse District (Kurazukuri Street), tastefully renovated into shops, restaurants, cafes, and more. Stroll down the Warehouse District, and then double back to explore its side streets while munching and sipping away on Saitama specialities like “satsumaimo” sweet potato, “kabayaki” eel, matcha tea, and a number of other scrumptious delicacies.\n\nThe most famous buildings in the Warehouse District are the Osawa Residence, which was built in 1792 and survived the 19th-century fires; the Toki no Kane time bell tower, which has stood in various forms for around 400 years, and whose current version was erected just after the fires, and Miyaoka Knives, a knife merchant founded in 1843 housed in one of Kawagoe’s original kura warehouses.\n\nComplementing these older structures are a scattering of more modern Western-inspired buildings radiating a retro charm. You’ll no doubt spot the grand-old Saitama Risona Bank, Kawagoe Branch lurking in the distance, which was built in 1918 and is still in partial use as a bank today. Other highlights are the Former Yamakichi Department Store, built in 1936 and once home to Kawagoe’s first ever department store, and the quaint European-style Ichibangai Yofu Nagaya alleyway. Many more can be seen on the nearby Taisho Romance Street, a wide cobblestone lane lined with dainty boutiques.\n\nYamawa\n\nAnother gem tucked within the Warehouse District is Yamawa, a pottery shop housed in one of Kawagoe’s iconic kura, built in 1893. Before entering, scan its ornate roof to see if you can spot the small figure of Shoki, a mythical deity and fighter of evil, which is made entirely out of tile. Inside Yamawa is a vast assortment of gorgeous pottery and glassware from local artists, ranging from reasonably priced everyday utensils to magnificent luxury art pieces.\n\nYamawa also has its own original ceramics brand crafted in the attached pottery, featuring bowls, cups, and teapots made with clay from Shigaraki, Shiga Prefecture, one of the Six Ancient Kilns of Japan. They also have an in-house restaurant best known for the Sweet Potato Mini Kaiseki, a set of dishes flaunting the goodness of Kawagoe sweet potatoes.\n\nKashiya Yokocho Street\n\nKashiya Yokocho Street is another must-see section of Kawagoe. This narrow laneway, hidden from the main road, is crammed with around 30 confectioners, many specializing in sweet potato-based desserts. As kids plunder the stores, adults can be seen gorging on nostalgic favorites from childhood, while freshly brewed matcha drinks from Matcha Arata and savory breads from the boutique Bakery Raku Raku ensure a well-rounded gourmet experience.\n\nWe recommend kicking off your feast with the Imokoi manju from Kasho Umon. These bite-sized handmade buns are made fresh from sweet potato and coarse anko beans wrapped in a thin but firm mochi skin blended with Japanese yams. As a whole-cut slice of sweet potato is used, its natural flavor and texture shines through, culminating in a mild, earthy sweetness.\n\nKasho Umon has several other locations spread out across Kawagoe, including next to the Toki no Kane tower, so you can grab multiple Imokoi buns while strolling about town.\n\nKawagoe Hikawa Shrine\n\nAlongside antique buildings, Kawagoe is also home to several notable Japanese shrines and temples. One of the most prestigious is Kawagoe Hikawa Shrine, an oasis of peace and greenery amongst the bustling Kawagoe streets, and the perfect spot for a breather before heading back to Tokyo.\n\nKawagoe Hikawa Shrine’s history is said to stretch back to the reign of Emperor Kinmei in the 6th century, and it has long served as Kawagoe’s protector while being fervently worshiped by successive local lords. At a whopping 15 meters tall, one of Japan’s largest wooden torii gates stands at its entrance, and its current main shrine was constructed in 1849 with intricate wooden carvings.\n\nKawagoe Hikawa Shrine’s sizeable grounds have plenty to see, like the tunnel of “ema,” which are small wooden tablets that visitors write their wishes on and hang up; the summertime Enmusubi Wind Chime display of around 1,500 traditional Edo-style wind chimes (early July to early September), and a boulder said to resemble a dog.\n\nHowever, the main attraction is its fishing game, where you’ll fish for papier-mache sea bream with “omikuji” fortune-telling slips slotted into their tails. Sea bream are seen as lucky in Japan, and have long been dedicated to the gods. The red fish tell your fortune for the year, while the pink fish are for love-related destinies. It’s both a fun game and meaningful cultural experience, and the fish make for a great souvenir of your Kawagoe day trip!\n\nExplore the Scenic Outskirts of Tokyo With the SEIBU 1 Day Pass\n\nThe SEIBU 1 Day Pass is your ticket to the wonders that sit along the Seibu Railway in the outskirts of Tokyo. Those seeking Tokyo day trip ideas will no doubt find inspiration in the natural splendor of Chichibu and the historical Kawagoe. Be sure to book your SEIBU 1 Day Pass when organizing your Tokyo itinerary for smooth and discounted travel to Tokyo’s best day trip destinations!"
