        "text": "On August 6, Seibu Railways joins the onslaught of companies doing cross-promotions with Attack on Titan. Japanese rail fans can participate in a \"stamp rally\" to accumulate points to win prizes.\n\nAccording to a clip on Seibu Railways' \"Attack on Chichibu\" website, Levi, Eren and Mikasa are sallying forth to \"Wall Chichibu\" to fight the Titans — and taking the train for the first time. Chichibu is a mountain town northwest of Tokyo reachable via an extension of Seibu Railways' Ikebukuro Line. At one of six departure stations (Ikebukuro, Nerima, Tokorozawa, Irumashi, Hannou and East Hannou) and five different points in Chichibu (the train station, Chichibu Shrine, Chichibu Park Bridge, Jigen Temple and the Takasago Hormone restaurant) fans can scan QR codes containing more voice clips that elaborate the story — making the expedition something like a survey.\n\nSeibu Railways' provided map of \"Wall Chichibu\"\n\nPoints earned from the expedition can be redeemed for prizes. A pair of tickets to an upcoming Attack on Titan exhibit at Tokyo's Ueno Royal Museum can be earned just for participating. There are 15 pairs available. If participants earn over 4,000 points, they can win an exclusive poster advertising the promotion. There are 50 available. Earning over 5,500 points might win you an Attack on Titan stationery set; 20 are available. Breaking the 7,500 point line wins you one of three of those exclusive posters, but with cast autographs on it. 8,500 points earns you an Eren Nendoroid; eight of these are available. Finally, the grand prize, for those who earn over 10,000 points.... is a mystery for now. Note that you aren't guaranteed a prize; you have to apply for them, and which prize you'll end up getting (if you earn more than 4,000 points) is determined by lottery. On the other hand, all participants will get a sticker, clear file, or paper fan at the Chichibu station (unless supplies run out).\n\nPrizes (from left to right): the poster; the stationery; the Eren Nendoroid\n\nA \"second season\" of the campaign, titled \"Chichibu's Weapons\" (this one is \"Chichibu's Power\"), is scheduled to begin on September 22."
