        "text": "Set HU306 of the HU300 series passes through the Kiyohara Industrial Park\n\nLet me continue from where I left off my last post. I'm going to describe the tramcars on the Haga-Utsunomiya LRT line.\n\nThe EMU HU300 series is the sole model on the line. A total of 17 sets were built by Niigata Transys in technical partnership with Bombardier (present Alstom). They are set HU301 to HU317. One set is 29.52 meters long, which just barely stayed within the limit of the Tramways Act of Japan, namely 30 meters. It's composed of 3 cars and each car has one bogie. One set can accommodate 160 passengers, which is the largest capacity of the Japanese tramcars.\n\nThe good thing about the interior of the HU300 series for me is its box-type cross-seats. They are black-colored and classy. On the other hand, the priority seats are long-seats. It makes it easier to sit down and stand up for elderly passengers. Regarding the technical specifications, the HU300 series has an IGBT variable-frequency drive electric control system. Each car has one 100 kW three-phase induction motor. The current maximum running speed of the HU300 series is 40 kilometers per hour, but its maximum design speed is 70 kilometers per hour. I hope Haga-Utsunomiya LRT will raise up its operating speed in the near future.\n\nIncidentally, set HU306 is the special poster train of Utsunomiya Brex, which is a professional basketball team based in Utsunomiya City. Its bodies are decorated with team logos and famous players' portraits. Set HU306 holds a special place in the HU300 series.\n\nSide view of Set HU306\n\nSet HU304 of the electric car HU300 series arrives at Utsunomiya Station East\n\nOn August 26th, a new tramline named Haga-Utsunomiya LRT was opened between Utsunomiya City and Haga Town in Tochigi Prefecture. Inauguration of the new tramline in Japan was for the first time in 75 years.\n\nJapan once had extensive tram networks in many mega-cities. Those tramlines functioned as commuter transportation arteries, but most of the routes have already been abolished due to heavy traffic jams. For example, only two routes, namely the Toei-Arakawa line and the Tokyu-Setagaya line, survive in Tokyo. People have been thinking that the tramline is a relic of the past. Wait a second, the times have changed. Super-low floor type streetcars (so-called LRT) in European countries have provided a hint for considering new urban traffic systems in Japan. The LRT is said to have many merits, such as lower construction cost compared to subways, speedier than buses and friendly for aging people. Tramlines must revive.\n\nHaga-Utsunomiya LRT is a 14.5-kilometers-long tramline connecting Utsunomiya Station East and Haga Takanezawa Industrial Park. There are 19 stations. The track is double and the gauge size is 1,067 millimeters. The electric system is 750 volts direct current. Tramcars are operated every 8 minutes in the rush hour and every 12 minutes in the daytime. The operating speed of the tramcar is 40 kilometers per hour. Passengers can enjoy not only the cityscape but also the scenery of the industrial park and the countryside. I remembered the C-Train in Calgary, Canada, where I visited twelve years ago.\n\nTo be continued...\n\nSet HU306 travels on the Haga-Utsunomiya LRT line\n\nOfficial website, Haga-Utsunomiya LRT, Utsunomiya Light Rail Co., Ltd. (in Japanese):\n\nElectric car 103 of the MoHa 1 series is preserved in Nippon Institute of Technology\n\nNippon Institute of Technology is a private university in Miyashiro Town, Saitama Prefecture. This university has a unique museum named Museum of Industrial Technology on campus. The museum was established in 1987 to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the university. More than 250 machines, which contributed to the development of Japanese industry, are exhibited, but that is not all. In 2019, the museum took over an old electric car, unit 103, from Hakone-tozan Railway, and started to display it in front of the museum. Anyone can observe this electric car and the exhibits of the Museum for free.\n\nLet me quickly review Hakone Tozan Railway. It's a dependable transporter that climbs up Hakone Volcano in the suburban area of Tokyo. Connecting Odawara and Gora, the route length is 15 kilometers. This railway was initially opened as Odawara Horse Tramway in 1888. Its maximum angle is 80 per-mille, which is the world's second steepest railway.\n\nUnit 103 is one of the 7 cars of the Hakone-tozan MoHa 1 series electric cars. It was originally built by Nippon Sharyo in 1919 with a wooden body under the name of unit ChiKi 1. It was modified to the steel body car in 1950, and renamed unit 103. After operating for 100 years, it was retired from the track in 2019, and displayed in Nippon Institute of Technology. For your information, unit 103's younger brother, namely unit 107, is currently preserved in Odawara City, and used as a stylish \"Cafe 107\".\n\nSide view of electric car 103\n\nOfficial website, Museum of Industrial Technology, Nippon Institute of Technology (in Japanese): https://museum.nit.ac.jp/\n\nSet 6017 of the EMU Seibu 6000 series with yellow-colored stripes\n\nOn October 1st, 2023, Seibu Railway celebrated the 40th anniversary of their Seibu-Yurakucho line. In commemoration, Seibu will operate an anniversary train until March, 2024.\n\nLet me review the Seibu-Yurakucho line to start. It's a connecting line between the Seibu-Ikebukuro line and the Tokyo Metro-Yurakucho line. Connecting Nerima on the Seibu-Ikebukuro line and Kotake-Mukaihara on the Tokyo Metro-Yurakucho line, its route length is 2.6 kilometers. The track is underground and double. There is an intermediate station, Shin-Sakuradai on the line. 8-car or 10-car trains are operated every 5 to 10 minutes. The line name is \"Seibu-Yurakucho line\", but the route doesn't pass through \"Yurakucho\" in the central part of Tokyo. Why? Because, the Seibu-Yurakucho line was initially planned as a part of Subway Line 8, namely the Yurakucho line, by Transport Council of the Japanese government in 1970. It's integrated with the Tokyo Metro-Yurakucho line, which passes through \"Yurakucho\". As you know, the trains on the Seibu-Yurakusho line are currently operated onto the Tokyo Metro-Fukutoshin line as well, so, the situation has changed.\n\nThe anniversary train is set 6017 of the EMU Seibu 6000 series. It has yellow-colored special stripes on the bodies. As you know, yellow is the line color of the Tokyo-Metro Yurakucho line; meanwhile, the standard Seibu 6000 series trains have blue-colored stripes. The anniversary train also has a special plate on the front celebrating the 40th anniversary. Congratulations on the 40th anniversary of the Seibu-Yurakucho line! It's the short connecting line, but the great transportation artery in the western part of Tokyo.\n\nSpecial plate of \"the 40th anniversary of the Seibu-Yurakucho line\"\n\nOfficial information about the memorial train (in Japanese):\n\nSteam locomotive Tobu 1 is preserved in Johoku Traffic Park in Itabashi Ward\n\nItabashi is one of 23 wards of Tokyo Metropolis, and located in the northern part of the metropolis. There are two traffic parks in the ward. Traffic parks are good places for kids to learn traffic rules, while playing and riding bikes and pedal cars, but the role is not only that. We can see preserved vehicles. I recently visited Johoku Traffic Park in Itabashi Ward to observe a precious locomotive.\n\nTobu 1 is a steam locomotive (SL) built in 1912 by Orenstein & Koppel Company in Germany. It's a 0-4-0 type (Whyte notation) SL, 5.023 meters long, 1.827 meters wide, 3.429 meters high, and weighs 8,630 kilograms. The driving wheel diameter is 585 millimeters. This small SL was originally commissioned in Arita Railway under the name of Arita 1. For your information, Arita Railway was a local route in Wakayama Prefecture in the western part of Japan, but unfortunately abolished in 2003. Arita 1 was transferred to Tobu Railway, and renamed Tobu 1 in 1951. Tobu 1 belonged to Kawagoe Locomotive Depot, but it was operated only for untimetabled trains on the Tojo line. Tobu 1 was retired from the track in 1952 because of its low towing ability. To make matters worse, Tobu 1 only had a handbrake system. I wonder why Tobu had introduced this SL.\n\nApart from its mundane history, I was fascinated by Tobu 1 as it's lovely, and preserved in very good condition. I would like to thank everyone involved in preserving Tobu 1 in Itabashi Ward.\n\nBack view of Tobu 1\n\nEMU Shin-Keisei 8800 series arrives at Kunugiyama station (July, 2022)\n\nOn October 31st, Keisei Electric Railway Company made a press release announcing that Keisei will absorb Shin-Keisei Electric Railway Company in April, 2025.\n\nLet me review Keisei Electric Railway and Shin-Keisei Electric Railway. Keisei is one of the major private railway companies in the Tokyo metropolitan area. It was established in 1909 to transport worshippers to the famous temple, Shinsho-ji. Keisei currently owns a total of 152.3-kilometer-long railway network in the eastern part of Tokyo and northern Chiba Prefecture. The airport access limited express, \"Skyliner\", is famous for being Keisei's flagship train. On the other hand, Shin-Keisei (New Keisei) is an affiliate firm of Keisei Electric Railway Company in Chiba Prefecture. It owns a 26.5-kilometer-long railway route connecting Matsudo on the JR East Joban line and Tsudanuma on the Keisei Main line. Shin-Keisei was constructed as a training line by the Railway Regiment of the ex-Japanese Army in 1929. After WWII, the railway track was sold to Keisei Electric Railway Company. Then, it was reopened as the Shin-Keisei line of Shin-Keisei Electric Railway Company in 1947.\n\nKeisei has made Shin-Keisei a wholly-owned subsidiary last year through a share exchange. As the second step, Keisei will absorb Shin-Keisei in 2025 to maximize synergies by making faster decisions and improving business efficiency. I hope that the merger will provide Keisei and Shin-Keisei with a more stable business. At the same time, as a rail fan, I wish the unique trains on the Shin-Keisei line will be active on the track for a long time.\n\nShin-Keisei \"Funassyi (local mascot of Funabashi City)\" poster train (July, 2022)\n\nEMU Keisei 3000 series displays \"the 150th anniversary of Chiba Prefecture\" plate\n\nAutumn begins to deepen in Japan. The leaves have begun to turn red here and there. What is more, autumn roses currently look so beautiful. In Japan, the roses look great when in full bloom in May, but, autumn roses are also famous from October to November. I recently visited Yatsu Rose Garden in Chiba Prefecture, near Yatsu station on the Keisei line for the first time in twelve years. The nostalgic rose garden was right there as soon as I passed through the gate. The sweet smell of roses was hanging in the air the same as twelve years ago, but the number of roses has been increasing in twelve years. I fully enjoyed all kinds of roses in full bloom in the garden.\n\nTaking this opportunity, I'm going to show you a Keisei train displaying a special plate on the front. On June 15th this year, Chiba Prefecture marked the 150th anniversary of its birth. Chiba Prefecture was established on June 15, 1873 after abolishing feudal domains. In commemoration, Chiba Prefecture held several events collaborating with local companies including Keisei Electric Railway. Keisei displays the 150th anniversary memorial plate on the front of set 3040 of the EMU 3000 series. You can see a \"Takarabune (treasure ship)\" on the memorial plate. Takarabune is the sailing ship on which the treasures are loaded. The treasures are a bream, peanuts and a lobster... all delicious local specialties. I'm getting hungry all of a sudden. Congratulations on the 150th anniversary of Chiba Prefecture!\n\nYatsu Rose Garden near Yatsu station on the Keisei line\n\nSet 102 of the EMU 100 series (Type-C) arrives at Tokyo Disneyland station\n\nThe Disney Resort line has become more colorful. Three more colored trains of the new model, Type-C, have joined on the line.\n\nLet's quickly review the Disney Resort line. It's a straddle type monorail line opened in 2001. It's a public transport under the Railway Business Act, not an attraction inside the resort. The route is a looped single track running through amusement facilities, official hotels and JR East Maihama station. There are four stations over the total operating length of 5.0 kilometers. The trains run counterclockwise throughout the day. The EMU 10 series, also known as Type-X train, had been the sole model on the line since its inauguration, but the EMU 100 series, also known as Type-C train, debuted in 2020, and has been increasing the number.\n\nLet's head to the main topic. Following set 101, which has yellow-colored bodies, set 102, 103 and 104 of Type-C train have been commissioned on the line. Set 102 has pink-colored, set 103 has blue-colored and set 104 has purple-colored bodies. According to the media, one more set, named set 105, will debut with green-colored bodies by the fiscal year 2024. Incidentally, the old model, Type-X, and the new model, Type-C, are similar to each other, but Type-C has color shades on the body stripe. The passenger windows of Type-C are slightly larger than those of Type-X. Regarding the interior, Type C has simple long-seats; meanwhile Type X has corner sofa-type seats. The Disney Resort line is filled with a profusion of colors by the new model of trains.\n\nSet 103 of the EMU 100 series (Type-C) travels on the Disney Resort line\n\nEMU Keikyu 1000-1500 series passes by the train viewing spot, Shinagawa Shrine\n\nI visited a nice train viewing spot on the Keikyu line for the first time in ten years. It's located in the precinct of an old shrine in Shinagawa Ward. The name is also Shinagawa Shrine.\n\nShinagawa Shrine was opened in 1187 by Minamoto Yoritomo who was the founder and first shogun of the Kamakura Shogunate. The purpose of the shrine was to pray for maritime transportation safety. As you know, Shinagawa is located near the coast of Tokyo Bay. To get to the train viewing spot, you have to climb up a hill surrounded by trees near the main shrine. Local people call it \"Shinagawa Fuji\", because the profile is similar to that of Mt. Fuji.\n\nAfter climbing up Shinagawa Fuji, I found the nostalgic scenery, which is almost the same as that of ten years ago. The number of apartments might have increased. One minute later, a red colored train, the EMU Keikyu 1000-1500 series passed by me. The 1000-1500 series is the newest model on the line. It was commissioned last month as the 22nd batch of the 1000 series trains. One set is composed of six cars including four motorcars. The train bodies are similar to the 1000-1890 series, \"Le Ciel\". They are stainless-steel made and the side bodies are flat and smooth. You can see a slit glass just behind the driver's door on the side body of the top car. The red-colored train stood out against the background buildings and the blue sky.\n\nTrain viewing spot of Shinagawa Shrine near Shinbanba station on the Keikyu line\n\nMemorial plate of \"the 100th anniversary of the birth of Hachiko\"\n\nHachiko statue is a famous landmark in front of Shibuya station, located in a subcenter of Tokyo. Any Tokyoite knows the history of Hachiko. It was a male dog born in Odate City, Akita Prefecture in 1923. Hachiko was then adopted by Ueno Hidesaburo, who was a university professor in Tokyo. Ueno and Hachiko had a close bond with each other. Every morning, they walked together to Shibuya station, where Ueno got on a train to work. Hachiko then spent the day waiting for Ueno to come back. This routine continued until Ueno suffered a brain hemorrhage and abruptly died in 1925. Even after Ueno died, Hachiko continued waiting for him every day at the station exit for a decade. Hachiko died in 1935. Local people were moved by the faithful dog, and erected the statue of Hachiko. Today, Hachiko statue is a famous meeting spot among Tokyoites.\n\nWell, I can't be written off here as this is a railway blog. To commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Hachiko, a special plate is being displayed on the front of train set 5158 of the EMU 5050 series on the Tokyu-Toyoko line. As you know, the Toyoko line is one of the main transportation arteries connecting Shibuya and Yokohama. The trains on the Toyoko line are directly operated onto the Tokyo Metro-Fukutoshin line via Shibuya Station, and the Yokohama Minatomirai Railway via Yokohama Station. Displaying the memorial plate of Hachiko will be a good memento for Tokyoites.\n\nStatue of Hachiko in front of Shibuya station"
