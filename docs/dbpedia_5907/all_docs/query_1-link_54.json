        "text": "Are you a fan of Makoto Shinkai & Your Name?\n\nThen keep reading!\n\nMakoto Shinkai, the director of Kimi No Na Wa (Your Name), has released a new movie called Weathering With You (Tenki no ko).\n\nIt centers on Hodaka Morishima and Hina Amano. Hodaka moves to Tokyo and encounters a girl who can somehow control the weather.\n\nThe movie came out on July 19th, 2019 and it was a huge success.\n\nLike Your Name, Weathering With You (Tenki No Ko) takes place in Tokyo, so we can see a lot of real-life locations.\n\nNote: I already watched the movie, but this article doesn’t have spoilers.\n\nWe also have a video showing you the real-life locations, check it out!\n\nThis post is divided into 3 parts:\n\na) A step-by-step, location-by-location guide to the most important places that were featured in the movie.\n\nb) More real-life locations from Weathering with You in Tokyo that would be nice to visit, but I don’t think that they are a must-visit.\n\nc) Other places that were featured in the trailer but didn’t play an important role.\n\nOutline\n\nStep-by-step tour\n\nWhere to start?\n\nThe best way to start your anime pilgrimage tour is at any of the following stations:\n\nShinjuku JR\n\nShinjuku Sanchome\n\nShinjuku Tokyo Metro\n\nShinjuku Oedo\n\nSeibu-Shinjuku Station\n\nShinjuku-Nishiguchi Station\n\nAll the above stations are in the same area (Shinjuku), so just make sure to go to the Kabukicho Exit.\n\nIf you have a JR pass, Shinjuku JR will be the best option.\n\n*This tour will take you around 4-5 hours.\n\nKabukicho\n\nManga Café\n\nStart the anime pilgrimage tour by going to the manga café where Hodaka stayed.\n\nAddress: Japan, 〒160-0022 Tōkyō-to, Shinjuku-ku, Shinjuku, 3-chōme−20−5 ニューサンパークビルB1F\n\n—\n\nHina’s part-time job\n\nThen walk around 4 minutes and you’ll see a McDonald’s.\n\nSomething important took place here. Don’t worry, I won’t give spoilers.\n\nAddress: 日本、〒160-0021 東京都新宿区歌舞伎町１丁目２４−１\n\n—\n\nShinjuku O-Guard\n\n5 minutes from McDonald’s you’ll find the next spot.\n\nAddress: Japan, 〒160-0023 Tokyo, Shinjuku City, Nishishinjuku, 7 Chome−1−1\n\n—\n\nSeveral Roads in Kabukicho\n\n10 minutes from the previous bridge, and you’ll be sure to recognize the scene where Hodoka was in the doorway, sitting on the floor.\n\nWalk 10 seconds, and this was the place where Hodoka and Hina started their escape.\n\nAddress: 〒160-0021 東京都新宿区歌舞伎町２丁目２７ アタックビル\n\n—\n\nHere is one more scene of the main characters running in Kabukicho.\n\nAddress: エコロパーク 歌舞伎町第20\n\n—\n\nHotel Serio\n\nAddress: 2 Chome-15-13 Kabukicho, Shinjuku City, Tokyo 160-0021, Japan\n\n—\n\nTenkaippin\n\nClose to the Godzilla Statue, we can see Tenkaippin, the popular ramen restaurant.\n\nNote: This spot is close to one of Code Geass’s real-life locations.\n\nAddress: Japan, 〒160-0021 Tōkyō-to, Shinjuku City, Kabukichō, 1-chōme−14, 歌舞伎町１丁目１４−３ 第１０３東京ビル １・２Ｆ\n\nIn both movies, Your Name and Weathering with You, Shinjuku is the ward where we can visit the most real-life locations.\n\nTorii (Japanese traditional gate)\n\nAs you might guess while watching the trailer, this is the most important spot in Weathering with You.\n\nNote: You can’t go to the rooftop. Just take pictures outside the building.\n\nHere’s one picture that I found online of what the building’s rooftop looks like in real life:\n\nUnfortunately, the building was demolished in January 2020 :(\n\nHere is a picture of how the “sacred place” looks days before it is to be demolished.\n\nHodaka’s lodging in Tokyo.\n\nThe next spot is where Hodaka was staying while he was in Tokyo.\n\nTake the train from Shinjuku Station and get off at Kagurazaka Station,\n\nTake the B1 exit and after 2 minutes on foot, you’ll spot the house.\n\nI know the house is quite different in real life. But, believe me when I say that this is the house.\n\nAddress: 日本、〒162-0818 東京都新宿区築地町２０−２\n\nMeijiro Station\n\n6 minutes from Meijiro Station, you can see the railway line where Hodaka was running. One of the most exciting moments took place here.\n\nAddress: 3 Chome-1-40 Mejiro, Toshima City, Tokyo 171-0031, Japan\n\nTabata Station\n\n30 seconds from the South Exit of Tabata Station, you can spot another location.\n\nTogether with the building in Yoyogi (the one that was demolished), this is the most important place featured in Weathering with You.\n\nAddress: 1-chōme-17 Higashitabata, Kita-ku, Tōkyō-to 114-0013, Japan\n\nMore real-life locations of Weathering with You\n\nThese are not as important as the ones listed above, but I think that they are worth mentioning.\n\nThe locations below are pretty far from each other. So, my recommendation is:\n\nTravel around Tokyo, and if where you’re going happens to be near one of these Weathering with You locations, pay it a visit. Otherwise, specifically seeking out the landmarks that I listed in this post will take you a lot of time.\n\nYamano Tower\n\nTthe tower seen outside the window in the shot above is the NTT DoCoMo Yoyogi Building.\n\nClosest Station: Yoyogi Station or Minami-Shinjuku Station\n\nAddress: 1-chōme-53-1 Yoyogi\n\nShibuya Crossing\n\nThe most popular crossing in the world was also featured in the trailer.\n\nClosest Station: Shibuya Station (Hachiko Exit)\n\nTokyo City View Observation Deck (Roppongi Hills)\n\nAt the very beginning of trailer 1, we can see the Roppongi Mori Building and its Observatory Deck.\n\nHere’s another image of Roppongi Hills. We can also see Tokyo Tower.\n\nPhoto credit: @nadukari_h\n\nClosest Station: Roppongi Station\n\nAddress: 6-chōme-10-１ Roppongi, Minato City, Tōkyō-to 106-0032, Japan\n\nIkebukuro Police Station\n\nYou know what happened here. :D\n\nAddress: 1 Chome-7-5 Nishiikebukuro, Toshima City, Tokyo 171-0021, Japan\n\nHotel Amie\n\nClose to the Ikebukuro Police Station, there is the hotel where this scene took place\n\nAddress: 1 Chome-1-10 Ikebukuro, Toshima City, Tokyo 170-0014, Japan\n\nMinatokushiba Park\n\nNot too far from the hotel, you can see another location. This is where Hodaka and all the other main characters were having fun.\n\nPhoto credit: touyoko_com\n\nAddress: 4-chōme-8 Shibakōen, Minato-ku, Tōkyō-to 105-0011, Japan\n\nOdaiba\n\nHodaka and the Weather Girl did something here.\n\nA picture of Hareonna (100%晴れ女) in front of Tokyo Teleport Station.\n\nAddress: 1-chōme-2 Aomi, Kōtō-ku, Tōkyō-to 135-0064, Japan\n\nOther locations\n\nFinally, these landmarks were featured in the movie but didn’t play an important role.\n\nShinjuku Central Park (Cocoon Tower)\n\nA cool building that is visible throughout Shinjuku is shared by 3 colleges and vocational schools.\n\nThe cocoon theme is to convey an image of a cocoon that “nurtures the students inside.”\n\nClosest Station: Tochomae Station\n\nAddress: 2-chōme-11 Nishishinjuku, Shinjuku City, Tōkyō-to 160-0023, Japan\n\nKoenji Hikawa Shrine\n\nKoenji Hikawa Shrine is a weather shrine where people pray for good weather. (Funnily enough)\n\nThe movie features the same kind of ema (wooden plaques for writing wishes) as the real shrine. You might notice they’re oddly shaped like geta. (Japanese wooden sandals) That’s because, in olden Japan, these sandals would be tossed in the air as a spiritual way of forecasting weather.\n\nPhoto credit to @furutamandola\n\nClosest Station: Koenji Station\n\nAddress: 4-chōme-44-番19号 Kōenjiminami, Suginami City, Tōkyō-to 166-0003, Japan\n\nNozomi Slope\n\nPhoto credit: @Kijam5cm\n\nAnd for our observant readers- yes! Nozomi Slope (のぞき坂) was also featured in Saekano: How to Raise a Boring Girlfriend.\n\nClosest Station: Kishibojimmae Station or Zoshigaya Station\n\nAddress: 2 Chome-12-21 Takada, 豊島区 Toshima City, Tokyo 171-0033\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\nDo Weathering with You & Your Name share the same universe?\n\nShort answer: yes.\n\nI have two articles and two videos explaining it. Take a look:\n\nWhere to buy merchandise from Weathering with You?\n\nI found some goods in Animate.\n\nAs for T-shirts, UNIQLO Japan were selling tees of Weathering with You and Your Name.\n\nWho did the soundtrack for Weathering with You?\n\nRADWIMPS, the Japanese rock band that created the soundtrack of Your Name, returned for Makoto Shinkai’s new project, in charge of its soundtrack like the song heard in the trailer.\n\nThe official album was released the same day that the movie came out (July 19, 2019)\n\nThe songs that were featured in the trailer are:\n\n“Is there still anything that love can do?”\n\n“Grand Escape (Movie edit) feat. Toko Miura”\n\nIs the movie on Netflix?\n\nAt the moment, is only available on Netflix Philippines.\n\nWhen is the DVD coming out?\n\nThe DVD will be on sale in Japan on May 27th, 2020.\n\nHina’s snacks\n\nIf you’re curious about what kind of junk food Hina is holding:\n\nNissin Chicken Ramen Instant Noodle\n\nKoikeya Seaweed & Salt Potato Chips\n\nAnd yes, you can buy them at any convenience store in Japan. Try them out if you get the chance!\n\nThe snacks that appear in the movie have the same names and packaging as in real life.\n\nWhich one did you like more? Weathering With You or Your Name?
