        "text": "Set 11001 of the EMU Sotetsu 11000 series, \"the10th anniversary of Sounyan\"\n\nAfter posting about \"Mokoron\", Odakyu's new mascot character, I remembered that \"Sounyan\" has been working for 10 years at Sagami Railway (Sotetsu).\n\nWhat's Sounyan? He(?) is Sotetsu's mascot character. According to Sotetsu's website, Sounyan is a new species of cat, born on March 10th on the Sotetsu line. He joined Sotetsu in 2014, and has been in charge of public relations. He is a curious cat, and loves to be around people. He is good at looking for something new or fun. It's the same as Odakyu's Mokoron. His hobby is taking photos and eating around. Me too. He has something that has been bothering him. People often think he is a raccoon dog in spite of being a cat. What an elaborate profile it is! Sounyan, congratulations on your 10th anniversary of devotional work!\n\nI can't be written off here as this is a trainspotter's blog. Taking this opportunity, I'm going to show you Sotetsu's new Sounyan poster train. In commemoration of the 10th anniversary of Sounyan's service, Sotetsu launched a new Sounyan poster train on March 27th this year using set 11001 of the EMU 11000 series. The 11000 series is Sotetsu's commuter train which debuted in 2009 to replace the deteriorated 5000 and 7000 series. A total of 5 sets, 50 units, were built by Tokyu Sharyo and JR East Niitsu Factory. To reduce the manufacturing costs, it has basically a common design and the technical specifications with JR East's EMU E233 series on the Chuo Rapid line.\n\nFront view of \"the10th anniversary of Sounyan\" poster train\n\nOfficial information about \"the 10th anniversary of Sounyan\" poster train (in Japanese):\n\nTimetable of \"the 10th anniversary\" of the Sounyan poster train (in Japanese):\n\nUnit Odakyu KuHa 2658 is preserved in Tsujido Seaside Park in Fujisawa City\n\nFollowing the latest poster train on the Odakyu line, I'm going to show you an old Odakyu train, unit KuHa 2658 of the EMU 2600 series, preserved at Tsujido Seaside Park in Fujisawa City, Kanagawa Prefecture.\n\nThe 2600 series was Odakyu's commuter train. It debuted in 1964 to enhance the transportation capacity. For that purpose, the body of the 2600 series grew in size. One car has 20-meters-long and 2.9-meters-wide steel body, which is the same as the present 8000 series. A total of 132 units were built by Tokyu Sharyo, Nippon Sharyo and Kawasaki Sharyo. Regarding the technical specifications, one set was composed of 5, 6 or 8 cars. Each set had 3 to 6 motorcars. The electric control system was rheostatic with field-weakening control. After operating for 40 years, it was retired from the track in 2004. One of the front cars, namely unit KuHa 2658, was transferred to Tsujido Seaside Park. I would like to thank everyone involved in preserving unit KuHa 2658, but I'm slightly sad, as it's in a poor state of preservation. I think that the sea breeze might be a bad influence on the steel body of KuHa 2658.\n\nAfter observing unit KuHa 2658, I visited the ocean beach in front of the park. It was late afternoon. I fully enjoyed the seaside walking. Mt. Fuji was veiled in haze, but it was so refreshing when I was just blown by the sea breeze. There're only a few days left of this year.\n\nBeach of the Shonan Coast in front of Tsujido Seaside Park\n\nMokoron poster train, set 5055 of the EMU Odakyu 5000 series\n\nJapan's population has entered into a decreasing phase. Railway companies can't keep their arms crossed in this situation. They are in competition to attract passengers, and have to refine the value of their lines. Otherwise, the residents will move to the popular areas on other companies' lines. The railway mascot character is one of the solutions to refine the brand value of the railway line. For example, Sotetsu has Sounyan, who is a cat employee in charge of public relations. Tokyo Waterfront Area Rapid Transit has Rinkaru, who is a dolphin passenger of the Rinkai line. The Transportation Bureau of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has Toaran, who has a pantograph on the head. Yokohama Municipal Subway has Hamarin, who is a wheel of the subway train.\n\nHow is Odakyu Electric Railway going? Odakyu also can't afford to lose it! On October 7th, the company unveiled their new mascot character, Mokoron. He (or she) is a blue-colored rabbit to assist in child-rearing on the Odakyu line. He (or she) likes riding trains, and always looks for something fun. Odakyu recently commissioned the Mokoron poster train using set 5055 of the EMU 5000 series in commemoration of the debut of Mokoron. You can see an illustration of Mokoron on the front of the train. Mokoron is cute, and soon became hugely popular among children on the Odakyu line. I'm also one of his (or her) fans, and specifically fond of the large stuffed Mokoron boarding on the train. Look into the driver's cab.\n\nFront view of the Mokoron poster train\n\nOfficial information about Mokoron (in Japanese):\n\nOfficial information about the Mokoron poster train (in Japanese):\n\nUnit 2109 of the steam locomotive Class 2100\n\nDo you remember that I introduced the Museum of Industrial Technology, Nippon Institute of Technology, last month. One month has already passed, but I would like to show you one more exhibit of this unique museum on campus.\n\nThe Class 2100 is one of the historical steam locomotives built in the late 19th century. It was designed by a British engineer, Richard Francis Trevithick, who was employed by the Japanese Government in order to fuel the process of Japan's modernization. A total of 17 units were then built by Dubs and Company in the United Kingdom. Unit 2109 belongs to the second batch of the Class 2100 imported by Nippon Railway Company (later Japanese Government Railways) in 1891. After operating on the Japanese Government Railways, Unit 2109 was transferred to Seino Railway, Ooigawa Railway, and retired from the track in 1970. The Museum of Industrial Technology took it over in 1993, and it has been preserved in working conditions.\n\nRegarding the technical specifications, the Class 2100 is a 0-6-2 type (Whyte notation) tank engine, 10.439 meters long, and weighs 39,500 kilograms. The maximum speed is 65 kilometers per hour. Its output is 294kW. The Class 2100 was a high-powered locomotive for that time, so, operated on the steep tracks as both passenger and freight trains. Unit 2109 was designated a registered tangible cultural property by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan in 2008. I would like to thank everyone involved in preserving Unit 2109.\n\nBack side of Unit 2109\n\nEMU Keisei AE series, Skyliner, displays a gold-colored commemoration sticker\n\nOn October 12th, Keisei Electric Railway announced that the passengers of the third generation Skyliner exceeded 45 million on that day. Keisei held a commemoration ceremony at Narita Airport Terminal 1 station. The 45 millionth passenger received a bouquet and a commemorative gift.\n\nSkyliner is the airport access train. It's operated between Ueno, a subcenter of Tokyo, and Narita Airport Terminal 1, which is the second international airport in the metropolitan area. The EMU Keisei AE series is the third-generation vehicle for Skyliner train. It was launched in 2010 to replace the old model, the AE100 series. This limited express train is able to travel with a 160 kilometers per hour maximum speed, which is the fastest in Japan except the Shinkansen vehicles. The AE series is characterized by the crow-shaped black faces. It was designed by a famous fashion designer, Yamamoto Kansai. The interior of Skyliner is luxurious. For example, it has gorgeous reclining seats with wide seat pitches and wide luggage spaces. The AE series won the 2011 Blue Ribbon Prize by Japan Railfan Club as the best train that debuted in 2010.\n\nOne set of the AE series, namely set AE7, currently displays a gold-colored commemoration sticker on the front of the train. It proudly says \"Thanks, 45 million passengers\". There had been less passengers on the Skyliner train in the past few years due to the COVID-19 calamity, but the number of passengers has recently returned to pre-COVID times. Congratulations on the 45 million passengers!\n\nSet AE7 of the EMU Keisei AE series passes through Shin-Mikawashima station\n\nOfficial information about Keisei Skyliner:\n\nOfficial information about the 45 million passengers of the EMU Keisei AE series (in Japanese):\n\nWork train, Keio 900 series, travels on the Keio line\n\nIt's mid-December already. Time really flies. Before introducing the topics of the year end, I'm going to show you autumn scenery in the metropolitan area.\n\nMt. Takao is a popular sightseeing area near downtown Tokyo. It takes less than two hours from Shinjuku sub-center to the summit of the mountain at 599 meters above sea level. Mt. Takao was granted the highest rank of three stars in the Michelin Voyager Pratique issued in 2007. This mountain is also known as the autumn leaves spot. The best season is late November. To enjoy the best view, you should climb up the mountain, but please don't worry. You can take the cable railway, namely Takao Tozan Railway, and arrive easily at Yakuo-in temple near the summit. When I visited there, the maple leaves had just started turning red. It went well with the halls.\n\nTo get to the gateway of this splendid autumn leaves area, I took the Keio line, and got off at Takao-sanguchi station. Taking this opportunity, I'm showing a work train named the 900 series on the line. The 900 series is commissioned as an inspection car for track and catenary maintenance. Furthermore, it's also used as a snow-removing train and an open freight car to transport rails. I have posted the photo of the 900 series before, but this picture is much better. As you know, Keio doesn't release timetables of the work train, so whether I can shoot the 900 series or not depends on my luck.\n\nAutumn leaves of Yakuo-in temple near Takao-sanguchi station on the Keio line\n\nSet 08 of the JR East E235 series displays \"Hachiko\" plate\n\nFollowing Tokyu Railways, JR East and Keio are also operating trains celebrating the 100th anniversary of the birth of Hachiko. These two companies are displaying special memorial plates on the front of their trains.\n\nAs I posted before, Hachiko was a male dog born in 1923. He was adopted by a university professor, Ueno Hidesaburo, and lived near Shibuya station in Tokyo. Ueno and Hachiko had a close bond with each other. Every evening, Hachiko went to Shibuya station waiting for Ueno to come back. Ueno abruptly died in 1925, but even after Ueno died, Hachiko continued waiting for him every day at the station exit for a decade. Local people were moved by the faithful dog, and erected the statue of Hachiko. Today, Hachiko statue is a famous meeting spot among people visiting Shibuya.\n\nTo commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Hachiko, JR East is displaying a black-colored special plate on the front of set 08 of the EMU 235 series on the Yamanote line. The Yamanote line is the most famous commuter line in Tokyo. This busy line is looped through several downtown areas including Shibuya. On the other hand, Keio is displaying an orange-colored plate on the front of set 1734 of the EMU 1000 series on the Inokashira line. The Inokashira line is a 12.7 kilometers-long commuter route penetrating a residential area in the western part of Tokyo Metropolis starting from Shibuya terminal.\n\nShibuya is hot on Hachiko right now.\n\nSet 1734 of the Keio 1000 series displays \"Hachiko\" plate\n\nElectric cars, Iyotetsu unit 2005 (left) and 51 (right)\n\n(Photo: Nicolai Okkels)\n\nI would prefer to keep going with the topic of Iyo Railway in Ehime Prefecture. My thanks again go to Nicolai Okkels, who kindly sent me the recent photographs.\n\nThe Matsuyama City lines of Iyo Railway (Iyotetsu) are filled with the orange-colored tramcars. I didn't get to see a sight like this when I visited Matsuyama City in 2014. As I explained two posts ago, Iyotetsu unified their trains and tramcars in orange-colored bodies in 2015, because Ehime Prefecture is well known for oranges. Among these, \"Mikan-densha (Orange train)\" is a unique vehicle. Please look at the top photo. You can see the Mikan-densha, unit MoHa 51 of the MoHa 50 series, on the right side of the image. The photo below is the interior of unit MoHa 51. It's filled with posters of the local oranges. The straps are decorated with orange models. I wouldn't be surprised if they had a refreshing citrus aroma. They make me hungry. This interior is provided by Ehime Headquarters of the National Federation of Agricultural Co-operative Associations (Zen-noh).\n\nIncidentally, the MoHa 50 series was launched in 1951. A total of 28 units were built by Naniwa Koki and Teikoku Sharyo. The electric car unit 51 is the top number car, and belongs to the first manufactured group of the MoHa 50 series. The rounded high roof with a large single front light is nostalgic, and my favorite. \"Mikan-densha\", unit 51, has a big impact on the local people and tourists to Ehime Prefecture.\n\nInterior of the electric car, Iyotetsu unit 51, Mikan-densha (Orange train)\n\n(Photo: Nicolai Okkels)\n\nOfficial information about \"Mikan-densha\" by Iyotetsu (in Japanese):\n\nOfficial information about \"Mikan-densha\" by Zen-noh (in Japanese):\n\nUnit 5012 of the electric car, Iyotetsu MoHa 5000 series\n\n(Photo: Nicolai Okkels)\n\nLet me continue from where I left off my last post. I'm going to introduce the latest model on the Iyotetsu Matsuyama City lines. My thanks again go to Nicolai Okkels, who kindly sent me the photographs.\n\nTo start, let me quickly review the Matsuyama City lines. It's a tramline network consisting of 6 routes. The total operating length is 9.6 kilometers. The track is double, partly single. The gauge size is 1,067 millimeters. The electric system is 600 V DC with overhead lines.\n\nThe electric car MoHa 5000 series is Iyotetsu's second low-floor tramcar model following the MoHa 2100 series. It was launched in 2017. A total of 12 units, named MoHa 5001 to 5012, were built by Alna Sharyo during the past 6 years. The company plans to introduce 4 more units by the Fiscal Year 2024. Just like the MoHa 2100 series, the MoHa 5000 series is frequently called \"Little Dancer S\". This nickname derived from the \"dancing\" image of the vehicle and the \"little\" size. \"S\" stands for short, as it is only about 12 meters long. It can accommodate 60 passengers, which is 13 more than the riding capacity of the MoHa 2100 series. One of the pleasant services for passengers is free Wi-Fi. Another feature of the interior is digital billboard advertising. It means that there aren't any advertisements hanging from the ceiling in the train. Regarding the technical specifications, the electric control system is an IGBT-VVVF (insulated gate bipolar transistor-variable frequency drive) inverter with two 60kW induction motors.\n\nUnit 5008 of the electric car, Iyotetsu MoHa 5000 series\n\n(Photo: Nicolai Okkels)\n\nOfficial information, the Iyotetsu MoHa 5000 series (in Japanese):\n\nSet 612 of the EMU Iyotetsu 610 series travels on the Takahama line\n\n(Photo: Nicolai Okkels)\n\nI've received interesting pictures from a Danish rail-fan. He recently traveled the west-side of Japan, and shot many trains. I'm going to show you his masterpieces little by little. My thanks go to Nicolai Okkels, who kindly sent me these photographs.\n\nThe top photo is a Iyotetsu train, the EMU 610 series, traveling on the Takahama line. Iyo Railway, also known as Iyotetsu, is a private railway company in Ehime Prefecture, Shikoku Island. This local company owns three railway lines and one tramline network. The total operating length is 43.5 kilometers. When I visited Iyotetsu in 2014, the trains and tramcars had various colored bodies, but the company unified in orange-colored bodies in 2015, because Ehime Prefecture is well known for oranges. This body color is similar to that of the former Chuo line train in Tokyo, isn't it? I love it. Incidentally, the 610 series is Iyotetsu's direct current commuter train for both 600V and 750V tracks. It was launched in 1995 to replace the old model, the EMU 600 series. A total of 2 sets, 4 units, were built by Alna Koki.\n\nThe second photo is a must-see spot for rail fans in Matsuyama City. You can see a level intersection of a railway and a tram line. The northbound train, EMU 610 series, is passing through the intersection; meanwhile, the streetcar, 2100 series, is waiting for the passing train. He knows well about the picturesque railway spot in Japan. I was impressed with him.\n\nTo be continued...\n\nA level intersection of a railway and a tramline in Matsuyama City\n\n(Photo: Nicolai Okkels)\n\nSet 8111 of the EMU Tobu 8000 series travels on the Noda line\n\nOn October 11th, many rail fans were amazed by a news from Tobu Railway. \"An old train, set 8111 (hereafter 8111F) of the EMU 8000 series, will be coming back to the track soon.\"\n\nLet me review the history of 8111F. It's a 6-car train and the original 4 cars were built by Nippon Sharyo in 1963. After operating for 48 years, it was once retired from the track in 2011, and preserved in working conditions. At the same time, the owner of 8111F was moved from Tobu Railway to Tobu Museum. From 2011 to 2020, this preserved train was sometimes operated as a special train. For example, I saw it at Shimo-Itabashi station, when it was operated as a special train celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Tojo line; however, since 2020, we had never seen 8111F on the lines.\n\nActually, 8111F was alive! It was moved from the Tojo to the Noda line (Urban Park line), and started to be operated as a commuter train from October 31st in 2023. If 8111F were human, he (or she) would be a 60-year-old worker. He once retired at 48, but came back to his work at 60. Furthermore, he is working full time. That's amazing! Currently, many rail fans flock to the Noda line to shoot and ride this precious train. I was also one of them. When I was waiting for 8111F beside the track, many local people (non-rail fans) asked me, \"Is any special train coming?\" They showed deep interest in this precious train.\n\nSet 8111 stands at Funabashi station\n\nSet HU306 of the HU300 series passes through the Kiyohara Industrial Park\n\nLet me continue from where I left off my last post. I'm going to describe the tramcars on the Haga-Utsunomiya LRT line.\n\nThe EMU HU300 series is the sole model on the line. A total of 17 sets were built by Niigata Transys in technical partnership with Bombardier (present Alstom). They are set HU301 to HU317. One set is 29.52 meters long, which just barely stayed within the limit of the Tramways Act of Japan, namely 30 meters. It's composed of 3 cars and each car has one bogie. One set can accommodate 160 passengers, which is the largest capacity of the Japanese tramcars.\n\nThe good thing about the interior of the HU300 series for me is its box-type cross-seats. They are black-colored and classy. On the other hand, the priority seats are long-seats. It makes it easier to sit down and stand up for elderly passengers. Regarding the technical specifications, the HU300 series has an IGBT variable-frequency drive electric control system. Each car has one 100 kW three-phase induction motor. The current maximum running speed of the HU300 series is 40 kilometers per hour, but its maximum design speed is 70 kilometers per hour. I hope Haga-Utsunomiya LRT will raise up its operating speed in the near future.\n\nIncidentally, set HU306 is the special poster train of Utsunomiya Brex, which is a professional basketball team based in Utsunomiya City. Its bodies are decorated with team logos and famous players' portraits. Set HU306 holds a special place in the HU300 series.\n\nSide view of Set HU306\n\nSet HU304 of the electric car HU300 series arrives at Utsunomiya Station East\n\nOn August 26th, a new tramline named Haga-Utsunomiya LRT was opened between Utsunomiya City and Haga Town in Tochigi Prefecture. Inauguration of the new tramline in Japan was for the first time in 75 years.\n\nJapan once had extensive tram networks in many mega-cities. Those tramlines functioned as commuter transportation arteries, but most of the routes have already been abolished due to heavy traffic jams. For example, only two routes, namely the Toei-Arakawa line and the Tokyu-Setagaya line, survive in Tokyo. People have been thinking that the tramline is a relic of the past. Wait a second, the times have changed. Super-low floor type streetcars (so-called LRT) in European countries have provided a hint for considering new urban traffic systems in Japan. The LRT is said to have many merits, such as lower construction cost compared to subways, speedier than buses and friendly for aging people. Tramlines must revive.\n\nHaga-Utsunomiya LRT is a 14.5-kilometers-long tramline connecting Utsunomiya Station East and Haga Takanezawa Industrial Park. There are 19 stations. The track is double and the gauge size is 1,067 millimeters. The electric system is 750 volts direct current. Tramcars are operated every 8 minutes in the rush hour and every 12 minutes in the daytime. The operating speed of the tramcar is 40 kilometers per hour. Passengers can enjoy not only the cityscape but also the scenery of the industrial park and the countryside. I remembered the C-Train in Calgary, Canada, where I visited twelve years ago.\n\nTo be continued...\n\nSet HU306 travels on the Haga-Utsunomiya LRT line\n\nOfficial website, Haga-Utsunomiya LRT, Utsunomiya Light Rail Co., Ltd. (in Japanese):\n\nElectric car 103 of the MoHa 1 series is preserved in Nippon Institute of Technology\n\nNippon Institute of Technology is a private university in Miyashiro Town, Saitama Prefecture. This university has a unique museum named Museum of Industrial Technology on campus. The museum was established in 1987 to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the university. More than 250 machines, which contributed to the development of Japanese industry, are exhibited, but that is not all. In 2019, the museum took over an old electric car, unit 103, from Hakone-tozan Railway, and started to display it in front of the museum. Anyone can observe this electric car and the exhibits of the Museum for free.\n\nLet me quickly review Hakone Tozan Railway. It's a dependable transporter that climbs up Hakone Volcano in the suburban area of Tokyo. Connecting Odawara and Gora, the route length is 15 kilometers. This railway was initially opened as Odawara Horse Tramway in 1888. Its maximum angle is 80 per-mille, which is the world's second steepest railway.\n\nUnit 103 is one of the 7 cars of the Hakone-tozan MoHa 1 series electric cars. It was originally built by Nippon Sharyo in 1919 with a wooden body under the name of unit ChiKi 1. It was modified to the steel body car in 1950, and renamed unit 103. After operating for 100 years, it was retired from the track in 2019, and displayed in Nippon Institute of Technology. For your information, unit 103's younger brother, namely unit 107, is currently preserved in Odawara City, and used as a stylish \"Cafe 107\".\n\nSide view of electric car 103\n\nOfficial website, Museum of Industrial Technology, Nippon Institute of Technology (in Japanese): https://museum.nit.ac.jp/\n\nSet 6017 of the EMU Seibu 6000 series with yellow-colored stripes\n\nOn October 1st, 2023, Seibu Railway celebrated the 40th anniversary of their Seibu-Yurakucho line. In commemoration, Seibu will operate an anniversary train until March, 2024.\n\nLet me review the Seibu-Yurakucho line to start. It's a connecting line between the Seibu-Ikebukuro line and the Tokyo Metro-Yurakucho line. Connecting Nerima on the Seibu-Ikebukuro line and Kotake-Mukaihara on the Tokyo Metro-Yurakucho line, its route length is 2.6 kilometers. The track is underground and double. There is an intermediate station, Shin-Sakuradai on the line. 8-car or 10-car trains are operated every 5 to 10 minutes. The line name is \"Seibu-Yurakucho line\", but the route doesn't pass through \"Yurakucho\" in the central part of Tokyo. Why? Because, the Seibu-Yurakucho line was initially planned as a part of Subway Line 8, namely the Yurakucho line, by Transport Council of the Japanese government in 1970. It's integrated with the Tokyo Metro-Yurakucho line, which passes through \"Yurakucho\". As you know, the trains on the Seibu-Yurakusho line are currently operated onto the Tokyo Metro-Fukutoshin line as well, so, the situation has changed.\n\nThe anniversary train is set 6017 of the EMU Seibu 6000 series. It has yellow-colored special stripes on the bodies. As you know, yellow is the line color of the Tokyo-Metro Yurakucho line; meanwhile, the standard Seibu 6000 series trains have blue-colored stripes. The anniversary train also has a special plate on the front celebrating the 40th anniversary. Congratulations on the 40th anniversary of the Seibu-Yurakucho line! It's the short connecting line, but the great transportation artery in the western part of Tokyo.\n\nSpecial plate of \"the 40th anniversary of the Seibu-Yurakucho line\"\n\nOfficial information about the memorial train (in Japanese):\n\nSteam locomotive Tobu 1 is preserved in Johoku Traffic Park in Itabashi Ward\n\nItabashi is one of 23 wards of Tokyo Metropolis, and located in the northern part of the metropolis. There are two traffic parks in the ward. Traffic parks are good places for kids to learn traffic rules, while playing and riding bikes and pedal cars, but the role is not only that. We can see preserved vehicles. I recently visited Johoku Traffic Park in Itabashi Ward to observe a precious locomotive.\n\nTobu 1 is a steam locomotive (SL) built in 1912 by Orenstein & Koppel Company in Germany. It's a 0-4-0 type (Whyte notation) SL, 5.023 meters long, 1.827 meters wide, 3.429 meters high, and weighs 8,630 kilograms. The driving wheel diameter is 585 millimeters. This small SL was originally commissioned in Arita Railway under the name of Arita 1. For your information, Arita Railway was a local route in Wakayama Prefecture in the western part of Japan, but unfortunately abolished in 2003. Arita 1 was transferred to Tobu Railway, and renamed Tobu 1 in 1951. Tobu 1 belonged to Kawagoe Locomotive Depot, but it was operated only for untimetabled trains on the Tojo line. Tobu 1 was retired from the track in 1952 because of its low towing ability. To make matters worse, Tobu 1 only had a handbrake system. I wonder why Tobu had introduced this SL.\n\nApart from its mundane history, I was fascinated by Tobu 1 as it's lovely, and preserved in very good condition. I would like to thank everyone involved in preserving Tobu 1 in Itabashi Ward.\n\nBack view of Tobu 1\n\nEMU Shin-Keisei 8800 series arrives at Kunugiyama station (July, 2022)\n\nOn October 31st, Keisei Electric Railway Company made a press release announcing that Keisei will absorb Shin-Keisei Electric Railway Company in April, 2025.\n\nLet me review Keisei Electric Railway and Shin-Keisei Electric Railway. Keisei is one of the major private railway companies in the Tokyo metropolitan area. It was established in 1909 to transport worshippers to the famous temple, Shinsho-ji. Keisei currently owns a total of 152.3-kilometer-long railway network in the eastern part of Tokyo and northern Chiba Prefecture. The airport access limited express, \"Skyliner\", is famous for being Keisei's flagship train. On the other hand, Shin-Keisei (New Keisei) is an affiliate firm of Keisei Electric Railway Company in Chiba Prefecture. It owns a 26.5-kilometer-long railway route connecting Matsudo on the JR East Joban line and Tsudanuma on the Keisei Main line. Shin-Keisei was constructed as a training line by the Railway Regiment of the ex-Japanese Army in 1929. After WWII, the railway track was sold to Keisei Electric Railway Company. Then, it was reopened as the Shin-Keisei line of Shin-Keisei Electric Railway Company in 1947.\n\nKeisei has made Shin-Keisei a wholly-owned subsidiary last year through a share exchange. As the second step, Keisei will absorb Shin-Keisei in 2025 to maximize synergies by making faster decisions and improving business efficiency. I hope that the merger will provide Keisei and Shin-Keisei with a more stable business. At the same time, as a rail fan, I wish the unique trains on the Shin-Keisei line will be active on the track for a long time.\n\nShin-Keisei \"Funassyi (local mascot of Funabashi City)\" poster train (July, 2022)\n\nEMU Keisei 3000 series displays \"the 150th anniversary of Chiba Prefecture\" plate\n\nAutumn begins to deepen in Japan. The leaves have begun to turn red here and there. What is more, autumn roses currently look so beautiful. In Japan, the roses look great when in full bloom in May, but, autumn roses are also famous from October to November. I recently visited Yatsu Rose Garden in Chiba Prefecture, near Yatsu station on the Keisei line for the first time in twelve years. The nostalgic rose garden was right there as soon as I passed through the gate. The sweet smell of roses was hanging in the air the same as twelve years ago, but the number of roses has been increasing in twelve years. I fully enjoyed all kinds of roses in full bloom in the garden.\n\nTaking this opportunity, I'm going to show you a Keisei train displaying a special plate on the front. On June 15th this year, Chiba Prefecture marked the 150th anniversary of its birth. Chiba Prefecture was established on June 15, 1873 after abolishing feudal domains. In commemoration, Chiba Prefecture held several events collaborating with local companies including Keisei Electric Railway. Keisei displays the 150th anniversary memorial plate on the front of set 3040 of the EMU 3000 series. You can see a \"Takarabune (treasure ship)\" on the memorial plate. Takarabune is the sailing ship on which the treasures are loaded. The treasures are a bream, peanuts and a lobster... all delicious local specialties. I'm getting hungry all of a sudden. Congratulations on the 150th anniversary of Chiba Prefecture!\n\nYatsu Rose Garden near Yatsu station on the Keisei line\n\nSet 102 of the EMU 100 series (Type-C) arrives at Tokyo Disneyland station\n\nThe Disney Resort line has become more colorful. Three more colored trains of the new model, Type-C, have joined on the line.\n\nLet's quickly review the Disney Resort line. It's a straddle type monorail line opened in 2001. It's a public transport under the Railway Business Act, not an attraction inside the resort. The route is a looped single track running through amusement facilities, official hotels and JR East Maihama station. There are four stations over the total operating length of 5.0 kilometers. The trains run counterclockwise throughout the day. The EMU 10 series, also known as Type-X train, had been the sole model on the line since its inauguration, but the EMU 100 series, also known as Type-C train, debuted in 2020, and has been increasing the number.\n\nLet's head to the main topic. Following set 101, which has yellow-colored bodies, set 102, 103 and 104 of Type-C train have been commissioned on the line. Set 102 has pink-colored, set 103 has blue-colored and set 104 has purple-colored bodies. According to the media, one more set, named set 105, will debut with green-colored bodies by the fiscal year 2024. Incidentally, the old model, Type-X, and the new model, Type-C, are similar to each other, but Type-C has color shades on the body stripe. The passenger windows of Type-C are slightly larger than those of Type-X. Regarding the interior, Type C has simple long-seats; meanwhile Type X has corner sofa-type seats. The Disney Resort line is filled with a profusion of colors by the new model of trains.\n\nSet 103 of the EMU 100 series (Type-C) travels on the Disney Resort line\n\nEMU Keikyu 1000-1500 series passes by the train viewing spot, Shinagawa Shrine\n\nI visited a nice train viewing spot on the Keikyu line for the first time in ten years. It's located in the precinct of an old shrine in Shinagawa Ward. The name is also Shinagawa Shrine.\n\nShinagawa Shrine was opened in 1187 by Minamoto Yoritomo who was the founder and first shogun of the Kamakura Shogunate. The purpose of the shrine was to pray for maritime transportation safety. As you know, Shinagawa is located near the coast of Tokyo Bay. To get to the train viewing spot, you have to climb up a hill surrounded by trees near the main shrine. Local people call it \"Shinagawa Fuji\", because the profile is similar to that of Mt. Fuji.\n\nAfter climbing up Shinagawa Fuji, I found the nostalgic scenery, which is almost the same as that of ten years ago. The number of apartments might have increased. One minute later, a red colored train, the EMU Keikyu 1000-1500 series passed by me. The 1000-1500 series is the newest model on the line. It was commissioned last month as the 22nd batch of the 1000 series trains. One set is composed of six cars including four motorcars. The train bodies are similar to the 1000-1890 series, \"Le Ciel\". They are stainless-steel made and the side bodies are flat and smooth. You can see a slit glass just behind the driver's door on the side body of the top car. The red-colored train stood out against the background buildings and the blue sky.\n\nTrain viewing spot of Shinagawa Shrine near Shinbanba station on the Keikyu line\n\nMemorial plate of \"the 100th anniversary of the birth of Hachiko\"\n\nHachiko statue is a famous landmark in front of Shibuya station, located in a subcenter of Tokyo. Any Tokyoite knows the history of Hachiko. It was a male dog born in Odate City, Akita Prefecture in 1923. Hachiko was then adopted by Ueno Hidesaburo, who was a university professor in Tokyo. Ueno and Hachiko had a close bond with each other. Every morning, they walked together to Shibuya station, where Ueno got on a train to work. Hachiko then spent the day waiting for Ueno to come back. This routine continued until Ueno suffered a brain hemorrhage and abruptly died in 1925. Even after Ueno died, Hachiko continued waiting for him every day at the station exit for a decade. Hachiko died in 1935. Local people were moved by the faithful dog, and erected the statue of Hachiko. Today, Hachiko statue is a famous meeting spot among Tokyoites.\n\nWell, I can't be written off here as this is a railway blog. To commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Hachiko, a special plate is being displayed on the front of train set 5158 of the EMU 5050 series on the Tokyu-Toyoko line. As you know, the Toyoko line is one of the main transportation arteries connecting Shibuya and Yokohama. The trains on the Toyoko line are directly operated onto the Tokyo Metro-Fukutoshin line via Shibuya Station, and the Yokohama Minatomirai Railway via Yokohama Station. Displaying the memorial plate of Hachiko will be a good memento for Tokyoites.\n\nStatue of Hachiko in front of Shibuya station\n\nEMU Keio 5000 series, \"Mt. TAKAO\", arrives at Kitano station\n\nOne of the major railway business trends in the Tokyo metropolitan area is the reserved seat trains for commuters. As I repeatedly posted, Japanese workers are very busy. They sometimes need something before getting home as a treat for themselves, but their journey home is hard because urban commuter trains are packed on most of the lines. That's a background to urban-type reserved seat trains appearing. Nine companies currently operate reserved seat trains for commuters in the metropolitan area.\n\nKeio Electric Railway is no exception. Keio began commercial operation of Keio Liner, which is Keio's first reserved seat train, on their Keio and Sagamihara lines in 2018 using the new model, the EMU 5000 series. This model has multi-purpose seats, which the conductor can change from long-seats to cross-seats using a remote-control system. The cross-seat mode is applied when it's operated as Keio Liner train.\n\nWhat's new with Keio Liner? Keio has increased the number of Keio Liners in operation. For that purpose, Keio currently owns 7 sets of the EMU 5000 series, and operates 11 Keio Liner trains during peak time on weekdays. Moreover, Keio started the reserved seat sightseeing train named \"Mt. TAKAO\" using the 5000 series on weekends. It's operated between Shinjuku, a subcenter of Tokyo Metropolis and Takao-sanguchi, the gateway station to Mt. Takao. The fare for a seat reservation for Keio Liner and Mt. TAKAO is both 410 yen (2.7 USD). Keio Liner and Mt. TAKAO still have potential for growth.\n\nSide display of the EMU Keio 5000 series, \"Mt. TAKAO\""
