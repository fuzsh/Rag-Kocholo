        "text": "Junior high school boy learns a big lesson about paying attention to his surroundings\n\nCell phones and smart phones in particular, are an amazing tool. They let us keep in touch with our friends and family, provide us with incredibly convenient maps and directions when we are lost, and are the ultimate tool in settling bar bets. They are our life support, our life line to everything, so what happens when our every waking moment revolves around it?\n\nThere have been numerous issues recently about people who endanger those around them when they constantly look at their phone while walking. A junior high school boy in Nagoya Prefecture found out just how dangerous staring at your phone can be, to himself, and to the hundreds of people he put in danger.\n\nFor some of us, our lives exist on our phones. We can’t even go five minutes without checking it for new messages, tweets, or Instagram likes. For others, maybe the games on their phone are more interesting than the daily happenings of the world around them. However, just like how talking on a cell phone while driving is incredibly dangerous, walking and texting is causing all kinds of problems, especially in pedestrian-heavy cities like the ones in Japan.\n\nImage: Flickr (Dick Thomas Johnson)\n\nOn October 30, at Gokiso station in Nagoya, a junior high school student was staring at his smart phone while walking on the platform. He walked too close to the edge and fell onto the tracks as a train was pulling into the station. The train conductor thankfully noticed the student fall and hit the emergency brake. The train was able to stop 30 meters (about 98 feet) from where the boy had fallen.\n\nPerhaps the boy had been looking up “what to do if you fall onto the train tracks” because he was also able to make it to the safety opening at track level.\n\nImage: Setoden no Oheya\n\nSo many horrifying things could have happened in this situation, and it all stemmed from not paying the proper attention to your surroundings when you are walking. Ad campaigns to raise awareness to this danger are starting to pick up steam, and surely this incident will cause more and more people to pay attention.\n\nYour life might be in your phone, but it’s not worth your life to stay on top of your notifications 24/7. Keep your head up so you don’t become a poster boy/girl for a safety issue that could affect all of us.\n\nSource: Itai News via Mainichi Shimbun\n\nTop Image: Flickr (4563_pic)\n\nRelated Stories\n\nYour smartphone could kill you: Phone-related deaths on the rise in Japan\n\nThere’s a city in China with its own street lane for people who can’t stop staring at their phones\n\nElementary school girls rescue wheelchair-bound woman stranded on train tracks\n\nWhy Japanese Men Can’t Stop Spending Money Just To Drink And Talk With Girls (And Why This Upsets Women So Much)\n\nMan learns lesson the hard way, wakes up on train tracks with severed leg\n\nOrigin: Junior high school boy learns a big lesson about paying attention to his surroundings\n\nCopyright© RocketNews24 / SOCIO CORPORATION.

And what better way to get around than by Japan’s famously on-time and impeccably clean railway? If you’re still walking or taking taxis to your desired destination, take a lesson from these street-smart felines and hop on a train!\n\nThe most recent instance of a scene straight out of Ghibli’s Whisper of the Heart was uploaded to Twitter on November 8:\n\n▼ “Odakyu Line, a cat got on at Tōkaidaigaku-mae Station.”\n\nBut it seems cats riding the rails isn’t as extraordinary as you’d think.

Several witness claimed to have seen a woman jump onto the tracks of Izumiotsu Station just as a train was approaching. However, after the train arrived there was no sign of injury and the woman was last seen running away on the platform.\n\nHow the woman got on the tracks, survived the train, or escaped is unclear and an investigation is underway. Internet detectives well-versed in manga, however, are assuming that she was summoned by a big black orb in an apartment somewhere.\n\nAs the airport express train from Kansai International to Namba Station was about to pass through Izumiotsu Station, the driver at the front saw a woman squatting on the tracks. He quickly activated the emergency brake but it looked like he was too late.\n\nThe conductor hopped off when the train came to a stop and jumped onto the tracks to see what happened. But when he got down there, he saw the woman, described as in her fifties, with no signs of injury at all. She simply said, “I jumped” to the conductor and then climbed back onto the platform and ran away.\n\n▼ “The person who jumped seems to have vanished.”\n\nOsaka Prefecture Police arrived on the scene but were unable to determine how the woman avoided getting hurt by the train. Readers of the news online are calling it a real-life Gantz, a manga in which two boys get hit by a train and are summoned back to life by a black sphere to assassinate aliens.\n\n▼ According to the media she was moving so fast that she apparently left contrails.\n\nOn the other hand, Nankai, the company that manages the line where the incident occurred, explained that the woman probably lay under the train and when it came to a stop she simply crawled out from underneath and fled.\n\n…Party-poopers.\n\nPolice are still investigating the matter though and are referring to the station’s security cameras to try to determine the mystery woman’s whereabouts as she is wanted on suspicion of endangering train traffic.\n\nUntil they do figure out what happened, we can still imagine that she is out there fighting aliens in a violent and erotic game of survival.\n\nSource: Iza via Hachima Kiko 1, 2 (Japanese)\n\nRelated Stories\n\n“Get down!” Man leaps onto train tracks to save fallen woman\n\nMan learns lesson the hard way, wakes up on train tracks with severed leg\n\nEmployee injured as suicidal man leaps in front of train, bursts into cabin\n\nMan found innocent of indecent assault denied 12 million yen compensation by Supreme Court of Japan\n\nBetter know a train nerd: 36 different classifications for Japan’s “densha otaku”\n\nOrigin: Osaka police looking for woman who jumped in front of train, lived, and ran away\n\nCopyright© RocketNews24 / SOCIO CORPORATION.

And after a most bizarre early morning collision on Friday last week, the rail line can add another reason to that list.\n\nAlthough the details of the incident are still murky, one thing is for certain–no one ever expected this to happen in the middle of Tokyo!\n\nIn the early morning rush of November 21, the JR East Musashino Line, which connects Tokyo with neighboring Saitama and Chiba, experienced a delay between the Kita-Fuchu and Nishi-Kokubunji Stations. However, this was no ordinary delay, even for those who have become accustomed to the line’s often bizarre interruptions in service.\n\nTake a look at the following tweets of some commuters who got caught up in the early morning spectacle:\n\n“Musashino Line delays> Birds collide with the train. Graffiti vandalism. A futon blows onto the tracks. The door breaks and the station attendant becomes the door. A wild boar collides with the train <–new!! Somehow it’s not surprising…”\n\n“They say that there was a collision with a boar LOL. There’s no way I’m making first period LOL.”\n\nYup, it’s no joke, folks! This time around, the Musashino Line’s delay really was caused by a train’s collision with a boar!\n\nOf course, finding out this detail leaves us with more questions than answers. Where did it come from? Where was it going? Also, was anyone (boar included) injured in the aftermath of the accident?\n\nWe’d love to hear from any of our readers who experienced this delay on Friday and can shed further light on the situation!\n\nSource: Yukawa Net\n\nImage: WoofWorks\n\nRelated Stories\n\nJapan’s real and anime world technological icons combine with this Shinkansen transforming robot\n\nValentine’s Day chocolate found to be the cause of a train delay in Tokyo\n\nNew train carriages on Tokyo’s Saikyo Line allow more sardines to be squeezed into the can\n\nA Rare Sight in Japan: Commuter Train Operates while Carriage Doors Remain Open\n\nMysterious fire materializes inside Saitama train station on Tuesday\n\nOrigin: Tokyo train delayed due to the strangest of reasons\n\nCopyright© RocketNews24 / SOCIO CORPORATION.

Sure, you could use the functions built into your smartphone or tablet, but there’s something about writing things down that just makes you feel like you’ve got it all together. Also, and this is kind of geeky, but it’s sorta fun to flip through your old schedule books and see what you were up to on x date 3 years ago. In fact, Japan loves schedule books so much that you can now choose from a huge range of styles which are tailor-made to cater to specific lifestyles. Whether you’re a hostess, train otaku or exam-cramming student, there’s a schedule book out there for you!\n\nLet’s jump right in with the top 7 “specialized” daily planners available for purchase in Japan!\n\n1. Hostess planner\n\nBeing a hostess is a lot of work! (…Apparently. I mean, I’ve never tried it.) There’s a lot of customers’ names to remember, not to mention all that after-work schmoozing you have to do. This planner apparently has charts for filling in dates, customers’ names, and tallying up, erm, bonuses. It also looks fancy, meaning it won’t clash with your shiny dress! Perfect for ladies hard at work out there in the mizu shobai!\n\nClubdiary.jp\n\n2. Anime otaku planner\n\nIf you know someone who’s a fan of the long-running Gundam anime series, then this planner themed around major character Char Aznable could be an ideal Christmas present for them! Each month features a different shot from the anime, and the shiny red embossed cover makes it a seriously cool accessory!\n\nBiglobe.ne.jp\n\n3. Astronomy planner\n\nIf you’re a fan of science and all things space, then you’ll be over the moon with this planner which is packed with facts and figures! Star charts and constellations are included each month so you can keep track of the skies while you keep track of the minutiae of your daily life. You’ll never accidentally sleep through that solar eclipse or meteor shower again with this meaty reference book in your pocket!\n\nBlogs.c.yimg.jp\n\n4. Udon enthusiast planner\n\nThis stylish planner has dedicated areas in which to record consistency, taste and marks out of ten for a variety of udon shops in Kagawa prefecture. Available in muted green or understated yellow, this little souvenir will serve as a perfect reminder of your culinary jaunt around the prefecture!\n\nSetouchicogeiz.com\n\n5. Train otaku planner\n\nIf you’re one of those people who just can’t get enough of trains, then this is your new bible! It includes route maps, train serial numbers and other related in-depth train information encompassing most of Japan’s rail networks, and even the Shinkansen! There’s also even a little slot on the front cover in which to keep your paper ticket while travelling (although since we’re now firmly in the age of the IC prepaid train card such as the Suica/Pasmo/Icoca, surely only a noob would buy a paper ticket anyway?)\n\nBiglobe.ne.jp\n\n6. Historical planner\n\nIf you’re a Japanese history buff, then you’re going to need one of these in your pocket in case you forget any important dates or facts and for some reason find yourself out of wifi range. These planners have actually been sold in Japan for the past SIXTY years, and only this year are they finally being updated with new information (sixty years’ worth, in fact!)\n\nYoshikawa-k.co.jp\n\n7 . Jobhunting planner\n\nJapanese university students embarking on the gruelling endurance march that is shuukatsu, or job-hunting, are no doubt in need of all the help they can get. Featuring 22 months’ worth of scheduling space, this handy book is perfect for writing down interview dates, potential bosses’ names and results of employment exams. Personally, though, the thought of having to spend 22 months pounding the pavements looking for a job has made my palms sweat so badly, I think I’m going to have to wrap things up here.\n\nAtpress.ne.jp\n\nIf, like me, you’re one of those people who simply HAS to have everything in (at least some semblance of) neat and tidy order, then there’s almost certainly a daily planner in Japan out there for your specific needs and tastes!\n\nSource: Curazy.com\n\nMain Image: Trendy.nikkeibp\n\nRelated Stories\n\nHow to Tee Off But Not T-Off the Wife: Get Married on a Golf Course!\n\nPosters of Underwear-Clad Man Disappearing from Osaka\n\nSmartphone GPS system lets you bring your favorite anime voices along for the ride\n\nWhat’s the excuse for China’s bizarre painted-on apartment windows?\n\n“We’ll give you the best price!” for a townhouse in a Chinese ghost villa 【Photos】\n\nOrigin: 7 Japanese daily planners to suit every lifestyle, from hostess to otaku!\n\nCopyright© RocketNews24 / SOCIO CORPORATION.

Twenty-seven years since that era ended and the current Heisei era began, fond memories of “Showa Japan” still flood many Japanese minds.\n\nBut a recent online poll asked netizens to take off their rose-tinted glasses and consider the aspects of daily Showa-period life that, while seeming completely normal back then, would be unthinkable now. Join us after the jump for a look at the slightly grim feedback.\n\nThe Showa period gave us some pretty fantastic art in ads and some great anime, but there were some parts of Japanese society, like corporal punishment that bordered on child abuse, that are not likely talked about when waxing poetically about the good ol’ days. Wanting to take a look at parts of life in Showa Japan that some have a tendency to forget, the online news site MyNavi Woman asked its readers to submit “overlooked Showa moments” in a recent poll.\n\nMore than 450 readers were asked, “What are the top things about the Showa era that we rarely think about?” and were able to submit multiple answers. The results of the poll, along with the percentage of respondents who submitted the answer, are as follows:\n\n1. Drinking water during exercise was discouraged (28.9%)\n\nThe top answer most readers submitted was that it was considered common practice to forbid drinking water during any kind of exercise. Many net users couldn’t quite remember why this was considered good for the body at the time, but one remembered hearing their gym teachers telling them water would “thin out the blood.” Others recalled being told that drinking water during physical activities would actually cause your body to be further exhausted. Luckily, science caught up and taking water to sports practice became the norm.\n\n▼ Tears: the only liquid allowed during gym class\n\nImage: Wikipedia\n\n2. Train toilets emptied right onto the tracks (22.8%)\n\nBefore modern trains came along with their fancy toilets equipped with a holding tank, it was common for train toilets to be barely more than a hole in the floor. For obvious reasons, passengers were not allowed to use the toilets while the train was standing at the station, but those living near the tracks often complained of the smell of human waste, and some even fell sick from being near open sewage. Apparently as late as 2002, there was still a train with this kind of toilet being used by JR in Hokkaido.\n\n3. Everyone went to school and work on Saturday mornings (21.5%)\n\nForget Saturday morning cartoons, much of Japan still remembers a time when Saturday mornings were nothing more than another weekday. Children went to school and their parents went to work and the weekend didn’t truly begin until Saturday afternoon. But some actually looked back fondly at those memories because classes were often more casual and they enjoyed spending their Saturday mornings with their classmates.\n\n4. The yen was about 1/3 weaker (20%)\n\nToday, about 120 yen buys you US$1, but from 1949 to 1971 the exchange rate was fixed at 360 yen to the dollar to prop up Japanese exports. Even though Japanese industries loved being able to sell their cheap goods overseas, the weak yen made imports prohibitively expensive and trips overseas only a dream for the rich.\n\n5. Need to fix the TV, just give it a whack (16.5%)\n\nMany people who grew up in the Showa era remember when giving the TV set a good smack could improve the picture. This was because wires in the heavy CRT TVs of the past could be whacked back into place or dust that had gotten in knocked out after a good slap. Although this method of TV repair was common practice back then, we here at RocketNews24 really recommend you call your local repairman instead of going Mike Tyson on your screen.\n\n▼ “So…is it fixed yet?”\n\nImage: Flickr (C.G. Megee)\n\nBesides these five overlooked parts of Showa life, other readers recalled how socially acceptable smoking was, to the point that people lit up in hospital waiting rooms and subway trains needed ashtrays. And another reader remembered how pay-day during this time mean cold hard cash, making the man of the house very popular when he came home that day. How do these “forgotten” memories of Showa Japan stack up to what you know about the era?\n\nSource: My Navi Woman via Kinisoku\n\nFeature Image: Wikipedia\n\nRelated Stories\n\n‘Smell my spit!’ and other Japanese teachers’ corporal punishments\n\nIncredible New Animated Music Video “Transfer” Wins Fans the World Over\n\nTwo boys beaten and robbed of puffy pants, Osaka slammed for being trapped in the past\n\nSakurajima’s 500th eruption this year goes off with a bang and a huge cloud of ash\n\nAttack classroom boredom with Attack on Titan notebooks\n\nOrigin: Stinky train tracks, expensive imports and no weekends: netizens remember Showa-era Japan\n\nCopyright© RocketNews24 / SOCIO CORPORATION.

That’s awkward: Fleeting train romance wasn’t quite as it seemed\n\nIt was a moment all romantics dream of: He’s sitting in a train stopped at a station when he locks eyes with a cute girl waiting on the platform… but then the train leaves, the girl is gone forever and he’s left with nothing but the memory. This happened to one lucky guy, but unfortunately, the other person saw the experience a little differently.\n\nAfter our hero’s moment of romance, he quickly posted about it on the internet:\n\n“Just now on the train, I saw this girl (about my age) outside of a window like this [standing on the platform] and we locked eyes for like 5 seconds. I’m so happy now. Thank you.”\n\nHow sweet! This young man experienced a special moment with that girl on the platform. She probably felt the same sparks flying, so she must have also tweeted about it, right? Well… not exactly:\n\n“Just now, I was standing outside of a train and there was this gross otaku guy (about my age) inside. He locked eyes with me for like 5 seconds. That was really unpleasant. I could die…\n\n…By the way, I’m wearing girls’ clothes.”\n\nOuch! So, the mesmerizing “girl” on the platform found the moment very unpleasant. But to make matters worse, she was actually a boy?! Either he’s quite an effeminate boy or the guy on the train needs to get his eyes checked!\n\nBut wait a second, this all seems pretty fishy. Both posts were spotted and retweeted by an apparent mutual friend, Twitter user @um_hmwr. What are the chances of this strange and complicated situation actually occurring? Pretty slim! Some netizens think it must have just been a game among friends, a ploy to get some laughs. Real or not, we’re laughing.\n\nSource: Jin, Twitter (@um_hmwr)\n\nImages: Twitter (@um_hmwr), Pixabay (ThePixelman)\n\nRelated Stories\n\nPretty Indonesian sisters share everything including good looks and sweet style 【Photos】\n\nOnline survey reveals the types of guys elementary school girls DON’T want to date\n\nLove curry?

JR Kyushu’s really cheap “Gachi Ticket” is in the hizzouse!\n\nWassup young people, I’m speaking your language today to tell you about to totally tubular deal from JR Kyushu! They’re offering some super-rad discounts of up to 40% off on train fares around the island of Kyushu for a seriously limited time.\n\nIt’s called the Gachi Ticket, where “gachi” is a new word the kids in Japan are using that’s hard to translate to English but somewhere along the lines of “for realz!” and “aww psssht it’s on!”\n\nIf all this terminology is throwing you, sorry grandma and grandpa, this offer ain’t for you! It’s for us dudes and dudettes between 18 and 24 years old. Can I get a “cowabunga?” These fares are for all soul trains running around the island of Kyushu including Shinkansen and JR Express. I ain’t jive-talking neither, turkey.\n\n▼ Instructions\n\nFor example, if you want to go from Hakata to Kumamoto by Shinkansen you’d normally have to pay 4,610 yen (39 US samoleans), but with a “gachi” ticket any bohemian, beatnik, or hippy can ride for only 2,570 yen (22 US clams). That’s a 40% discount, daddy-o!\n\nNow, before you run a 23-skidoo on this offer hold yer horses ’cause the sale has been put on hiatus from 9 January, but it will resume on the 28th. That’s the earliest sale date though because tickets can be bought up to a month in advance. The earliest boxcar you can actually get on will depart on 28 February until 5 April using these discounts.\n\nThat should be enough time for any box-socials or sock-hops you wanna attend, but again make sure you’re between 18 and 24 and purchase your ticket at least three days in advance. Or else, you’ll have to cheese it when some junior G-men catch on to your grift.\n\nSource: JR Kyushu via Niconico News (Japanese)\n\nImages: JR Kyushu (translated by RocketNews24)\n\nRelated Stories\n\nYou’re not seeing things, that’s a cat selling roasted sweet potatoes\n\nCurry of the Dead: Zombie-bait curry that’s good enough for human consumption\n\nThat’s not a rabbit, that’s Mother Nature’s version of Pikachu (also known as Viscacha)【Photos】\n\nOh boy, that’s pretty racist: Vine Japan edition\n\nThat’s the Power of Music – It Really Does Bring Joy to the World!!\n\nOrigin: Aw snap yo!

Taiwan is in the running to be the next moe-land with these cute anime mascots!\n\nLast year, Taiwanese netizens went gaga when one of the local subway systems, the Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit (KMRT), introduced two moe mascots to liven up their stations. The two anime girls, Xiao Qiong and Emilia, stirred up such a huge sensation, it seemed as if they were the only example of their kind in the country, but Taiwan has more moe than that!\n\nIf moe culture is your cup of tea, you’ll probably like this because we’ve got more Taiwanese anime mascots after the jump!\n\nJust to start the ball rolling, here are the “K.R.T. Girls”, Xiao Qiong and Emilia, who previously stirred up a moe storm in Taiwan. Do you remember them?\n\n▼ Xiao Qiong\n\n▼ Emilia\n\nEven before Xiao Qiong and Emilia made their debut in 2014, Taiwan Railway had already been incorporating moe culture into their promotional regime. Since 2012, the rail operator has had not just two, but five adorable mascots under its wing!\n\n▼ Collectively known as Miss Taiwan Railway\n\n▼ Rail (芮兒), a chief conductor.\n\n▼ Alice (愛麗絲), a railway attendant who’s also the younger twin sister of fellow Miss Taiwan Railway Dorothy.\n\n▼ Chef Hsia (阿霞師), who is a chef, of course. Someone has to prepare all the delicacies served onboard.\n\n▼ Dorothy (桃樂絲), who is also a railway attendant like her just barely younger twin sister Alice.\n\n▼ Railway (芮薇), a conductor. Her name may be similar to Rail, but they are unrelated.\n\n▼ It’s not just the trains that have cute girls holding the fort, Microsoft Silverlight too has a Taiwan-exclusive anime cover girl named Hikaru Aizawa (蓝泽光) who has been around since 2010.\n\n▼ She even sings!\n\nAlso conceptualized by Simon, the company which created the K.R.T. Girls, are the following moe girls who have been actively promoting various events and campaigns.\n\n▼ Xuan Ying (絢櫻) the shrimp girl who is the culture and tourism mascot of Ping Tung County, inspired by the area’s abundant production of sakura shrimp.\n\n▼ Magi (玛姬/迷路小瑪) endorses the annual Christmas event that takes place in Wanchin District of Ping Tung County.\n\n▼ And finally, Air (艾兒), who was created for an advocacy campaign proposed by the Vehicle Engineering Faculty of the National Pingtung University of Science and Technology.\n\nLooks like it won’t be long before Taiwan blossoms into a moe-land that is only second to the ultimate land of cute, Japan!\n\nRelated: Facebook pages for K.R.T.

Such encounters range from getting a bag of onions from a shop owner to receiving an umbrella from a stranger, while standing in pouring rain (both true stories). Even on the job, workers’ kindness and sense of duty to show such consideration comes through in the form of outstanding customer service.\n\nSuch was the case in Chiba Prefecture last week when two junior high school students got on the wrong train and were about to be late to one of the most important tests of their lives: the public high school entrance exam. Thanks to some kind Japan Rail staff, they made it– although, we’re not sure if they passed.\n\nThis story would not bear the same meaning if we didn’t first discuss the gravity of the high school entrance exam. Japanese compulsory education ends after junior high, so kids have to test into public or private high schools. Getting into a good high school improves your chances of getting into a good university, which, in turn, improves your chances of getting a good job.\n\n▼ Entrance exam time is the most stressful period for Japanese students.\n\nSure, they might slough off for their first two years of junior high, but all students know that once the third year comes along, they have to buckle down and study. In fact, many schools ban third year students from participating in sports and club activities after summer vacation, as they need to focus on studying for the remaining five to seven months before the tests! It’s kind of a big deal, and the process is repeated for the university entrance exam, three years later.\n\n▼ Even snack companies have hopped on the entrance-exam-studying bandwagon and offer special snacks for test prep. Here’s a Kit-Kat with encouraging words.\n\nThese kids study all day at school, all night and every weekend. All of the third-year students in the prefecture applying to public high schools take the test on the same day, at the same time. They can only apply to one public school and if they don’t get in, they have no choice but to enter an expensive private school or wait a year and take the test again.\n\nMost prefectures offer their public high school entrance exams in early March, but apparently Chiba runs early and had their’s last week, on February 12. Since many students commute to far-away high schools, some test-takers have to travel to areas they may have never been before, which only adds to the stress of test day.\n\n▼ Hey kids, because the test isn’t stressful enough, navigate through this too!\n\nTwo girls from Urayasu City in Chiba (that’s where the Tokyo Disney Resort is), embarked on the journey to their school of choice in Mastudo City, about an hour away by train. Still young, and spending all of their time studying, they’re not seasoned pros at navigating the complicated Tokyo-area train lines. Apparently, they got on the wrong train and, realizing their mistake, jumped off at Minami-Funabashi Station at around 8:00 AM. While pulling away from the platform, the conductor of the Japan Rail (JR) train noticed the two panicking girls trying to figure out the schedule board.\n\n▼ Oops! Wrong train!\n\nGood thing this was in good ol’ Japan, because said conductor then promptly got on the radio with the station master, Shigeo Shishikura, and told him about the distressed youngsters. Mr. Shishikura rushed over to the girls and helped them figure out how to get to their destination. In response to their lamentations of “We’ll never make it on time!” and “What should we do?!” he gave them words of encouragement, saying (more or less) “It’s okay. Calm down and go give that test hell!”\n\nThat was a nice gesture and all, but what Mr. Shishikura did next was above and beyond what most would expect of his duties as Station Master. After seeing the girls off, he called up the high school, explained the train situation and told them that the girls would be there, even if they had to miss the opening assembly to discuss details of the test procedure. Thanks to his call, the girls were able to swiftly move through the registration process and were sitting at their assigned seats before the test began at 9:25 AM.\n\nSo in the end, success! Well, they at least got to take the test, we’re not sure if they passed!\n\n▼ Hopefully the train mishap didn’t shake them up too much!\n\nIn typical Japanese fashion, the vice-principal of the two girls’ junior high stated, “By mistaking their train on such an important day, the girls troubled both the JR staff and the high school.” Downer! “But thanks to everyone’s kindness, the girls were able to take the test.” Based on Mr. Shishikura’s sense of relief when he heard the girls made it, we’re willing to bet that he didn’t feel troubled at all. We hope the girls took the time to thank him and let him know their results!\n\nSource: Yomiuri Online\n\nImages: Wikimedia Commons (ga9gk, DAJF, Albertogp), Japan from Inside, Miyako Mainichi\n\nRelated Stories\n\nTwitter user exposes test-taking “geek” to the world, geek sees tweet and turns to confront him\n\nJapanese railway sets up literal love seats with special seating for couples\n\nThis store’s attempt at encouraging students preparing for entrance exams creeps us out\n\nChina turns to tech to curtail cheating on tests, employs fingerprint scanners and metal detectors nationwide\n\nStudents go nearly a year without textbooks after teacher forgets to hand them out\n\nOrigin: Kind train station staff help lost entrance exam takers get to, and hopefully into, high school\n\nCopyright© RocketNews24 / SOCIO CORPORATION.

In addition to the well-known commuter trains, there are also popular sightseeing trains, and believe it or not, head-down-lower-than-your-shoulders and drooling-on-the-guy-in-the-seat-next-to-you aren’t the only ways to sleep while riding the rails in Japan, because the country actually has some pretty great sleeper trains too!\n\nTrain fanatics will soon be mourning the loss of one such train, however, as Japan’s longest running sleeper train, Twilight Express, is scheduled to do its final run on March 12 from Osaka to Sapporo. Sad as it is, there is a silver lining to this story as the retired train is going to be replaced by a new train that would frankly run its senpai off the tracks, the “Twilight Express Mizukaze.”\n\nThe new train kind of resembles an American football helmet on the outside. Not that it matters what it looks like on the outside, because it’s what’s on the inside that really counts, and the inside is outrageous.\n\n▼ The train will be 10 cars in total.\n\nThe whole train is 10 cars long, consisting of a dining car, a lounge car, six sleeper cars and the two sightseeing cars, which come complete with outdoor viewing platforms on the ends, hence the helmet-esque railings.\n\n“Six sleeper cars?” you may be thinking, “Then there’s a good chance that I too may one day get a spot on this fancy new train!” But think again. The concept of the train wouldn’t be “the quality you’ve always desired” if they planned on squashing people together. Rather, with six sleeping cars, the passenger capacity is a mere 30 people. Yes, three-zero, thirty.\n\nConfused? Keep reading.\n\n▼ Five of the six sleeper cars each contain three rooms like this.\n\nThe theme is pretty much “art deco meets the 21st century.” The rooms are stylish and modern, yet give you a sense of nostalgia. There are two classes of rooms you can check in to: A pretty nice looking room sharing a car with two other rooms (above) vs. one whole car all to yourself (indulgent much?). The bathroom situation in the 3-in-1 car is a little unclear at this point, but the high-class car not only has a toilet, but it also has a shower and a bathtub.\n\n▼ I’m pretty sure that the high-class cabin is bigger than my apartment (this isn’t even all of it).\n\n▼ This bathroom has a tub, so you can soak and completely forget that you’re riding on a train.\n\nIf you aren’t stunned yet, check out the video below. I’m not especially into trains, but I have never wanted to ride one so badly in my life. Good advertising, JR West!\n\nSince the Twilight Express Mizukaze is replacing the country’s most popular sleeper train, it’s only right to show some respect by carrying on the name, tacking on “Mizukaze,” which means “beautiful wind.” The logo is as elegant as the first-class bathroom, with the Mizukaze “M” represented as a mountain range, flanked by two trumpet-holding angels.\n\n▼ I feel classier just looking at the logo.\n\nWhile prices haven’t been released yet, we can only imagine that it will be out of the price range of the average Taro. But, if you start saving now, you might have enough by the time it starts running in Spring 2017. If you are one of those lucky enough to get a seat (bed? bathtub?), your train ride will take you between the Osaka-Kyoto-Kobe area and Western Honshu. It’s not following the same line as its predecessor, but JR West has its fingers crossed that it will live up to the original Twilight Express’s prestige.\n\nSource: Japaaan Magazine (1, 2)\n\nImages: YouTube (Discover West), Japaaan\n\nRelated Stories\n\nNew JR East luxury sleeper train to cost over $2,000 for two nights\n\nWest Japan’s new sleeper train looks more luxurious than most hotels\n\nBeautiful new luxury train for Ishikawa dazzles with gold leaf and lacquer interior\n\nBetter know a train nerd: 36 different classifications for Japan’s “densha otaku”\n\nFoul-mouthed video shows Japan’s legendary politeness shattered by train’s last run\n\nOrigin: Famed sleeper train to be retired, turned into luxury mobile hotel “Twilight Express Mizukaze”\n\nCopyright© RocketNews24 / SOCIO CORPORATION.

However, one purpose for which adult videos should never be used is as travel guides for visiting other countries.\n\nYou might think that would be common sense but apparently we can’t stress the point enough after there has been a recent spate of molestation committed by foreign tourists who claim to have thought it was normal behavior in Japan after watching Japanese adult videos.\n\nAccording to Focus Asia there have been three separate incidents of foreign visitors overstepping their bounds. In one instance a suspect was caught trying to capture images up women’s skirts while riding an escalator. Then in another case a Chinese tourist was reportedly caught grabbing a woman’s buttocks inside an adult goods shop.\n\nAnd then we have the case of a man arrested for lifting the skirt of a woman while riding the train. This last incident appears influenced by a scene from the classic 1993 AV Nurse Monogatari staring Miki Mayuzumi…or maybe something else. I don’t know because I don’t watch the stuff.\n\nReports claim that one foreign suspect confessed to police, saying, “Watching Japanese adult videos, I thought the people here were open about sex. I thought molesters were everywhere.”\n\nAll three men are currently in custody and deliberations with the victims’ lawyers are being held to determine if criminal charges will be pressed, or if they can find some other settlement. If they go to trial the men face a maximum of six months in prison and 500,000 yen (US$4,000) fine, or if the cases involve any form of assault the prison sentence can go as high as 10 years.\n\nAs the news hit Chinese media, readers responded with the expected level of disgust.\n\n“Dumbasses.”\n\n“This is seriously embarrassing.”\n\n“Make them Japanese citizens!”\n\n“I’m all for these guys getting punished by Japanese law.”\n\n“Put the scum in prison for 10 years!”\n\n“They’re as bad as Japanese soldiers.”\n\n“Great, they’ll probably just come back here and f*** up the same way.”\n\nMeanwhile, Japanese netizens had a lot to say about the crimes and their perpetrators as well.\n\n“Dumbasses.”\n\n“Yup [molesting] is normal. It’s normal to be arrested for it too.”\n\n“They clearly watch too much porn. Sad…”\n\n“That one guy [in the Chinese comments] watches too many anti-Japanese dramas.”\n\n“It’s probably those ‘women-only’ cars that give people the wrong idea. It’s like that’s the place for women who don’t want to be molested to sit.”\n\n“This is pretty shameful for Japan too.”\n\nAnd so as all the legal paperwork for these three men are being sorted, we’d like to once again remind folks that, just like in every other country, Japanese porn is in no way indicative of everyday life in Japan, especially all that stuff with the tentacles.\n\nSource: Focus Asia via My Game News Flash (Japanese)\n\nTop Image: RocketNews24\n\nOrigin: Three foreign tourists arrested for molestation in Japan after thinking it was normal behavior\n\nCopyright© RocketNews24 / SOCIO CORPORATION.

But boy, things sure didn’t go as planned…\n\nHere’s the original tweet:\n\nAt first glance, we see what appears to be a female high school student scrawling something in the condensation on the window…\n\nWhat did she write? “Don’t wake me until Shin-Matsuda [a station on the Odakyu Odawara Line in Kanagawa Prefecture].”\n\nFinally, a full view of her lovely featur–hey, wait a minute! “She’s” too old to be a high school student!\n\nHere are the comments of some innocent net users who fell hook, line, and sinker for the trick:\n\n“A female…high school student?

Not only does it go super-fast (you can totally feel those G-forces!), it’s also guaranteed to be quiet and incredibly clean. But with 323 Shinkansen trains departing from Tokyo every day, how do they find the time to clean all those trains?\n\nWell, it turns out that it takes a highly synchronised team of mega-efficient cleaners only seven minutes to clean each train – since that’s all the time they have!. And here’s an incredible video of how they do it!\n\nThe video, titled “7-Minute Miracle”, explains exactly what steps are involved in cleaning a Shinkansen train from nose to tail in the seven minutes between the train’s arrival at the station and its next departure. Cleaning teams are in position on the platform as the train pulls in so as not to waste a second, and, as you can see, no corners are cut as they clear and wipe down each car with incredible speed and efficiency.\n\nImpressive isn’t the word.\n\nOur favourite part was when they flipped all of the seats around (there’s a SECRET button!) so they’d be facing in the right direction for the next journey. Oh, Japanese design!\n\nNo, we were kidding. Our favourite part was when they lined up at the end to bow to the waiting passengers. Now that’s what you call style!\n\nNext time you’re in Japan and taking a ride on the Shink, spare a thought for the hard-working cleanup crew!\n\nSource: Fundo\n\nMain Image: Screenshot via YouTube – tokyo\n\nOrigin: This is how Japan’s train-cleaning crews clean the Shinkansen in only seven minutes\n\nCopyright© RocketNews24 / SOCIO CORPORATION.

We were unable to confirm which country the scene is taking place in, but those details hardly make a difference for the rogue on the train:\n\nHere are some of the comments left under the video by Japanese Internet users:\n\n“Wow, his body really spun around.”\n\n“It’s gotta be faked. You wouldn’t be filming when that kind of situation actually happens.”\n\n“Is this staged? At the very least, it’s not aikido.

To make matters worse, when a second woman stepped in to intervene, he also began touching the lower half of her body.\n\nThe two women were fortunately able to work together to fend him off and call for backup. The man was arrested upon exiting the train.\n\nThe perpetrator has been identified as a man in his 60s who is employed by Japan’s Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. He is currently denying the charges against him by saying that he didn’t molest anyone. The Ministry has commented that they are currently investigating the details of the incident.\n\nJapanese net users were far from impressed with the man, and they took to social media to express their disgust at his actions:\n\n“He’s really dedicated to his lust.”\n\n“Is this some kind of erotic manga?”\n\n“The Ikebukuro Line is unmatched for this kind of stuff happening!”\n\n“Nothing can be done for him, LOL.”\n\n“I can’t believe he even went after the female knight who valiantly tried to protect the princess…”\n\nWe commend the second woman for stepping in to help the original victim, and we hope that neither of them is suffering excess emotional trauma after their unpleasant ordeal.\n\nSources: FNN News via Kinisoku\n\nFeatured image: Wikipedia/Toshinori baba\n\nOrigin: Drunk government employee allegedly gropes woman on train, then molests her rescuer as well\n\nCopyright© RocketNews24 / SOCIO CORPORATION.

This festive season you can snooze past your train stop all you like—the rescue bus has got you covered!\n\nAs we’ve discussed before, Japan’s trains tend to stop running a little on the early side. And, with so many commuters relying almost entirely on the train services to get around, this can be a huge problem if you miss the last train of the day. Similarly, succumbing to the combined effects of too much boozing and the soporific rocking of the train carriage means that plenty of passengers find themselves, having caught the last train, accidentally missing their stop. In some ways, that’s even worse than missing the train completely, since you can wind up a really long way away from where you meant to disembark with little knowledge of the area you’ve found yourself in.\n\nFlickr/mhiguera\n\nLuckily for certain slumberous passengers, a new ‘rescue’ bus service is being rolled out just in time for the festive season. The bus service will operate between Takao Station, the final stop on the busy Chuo Line, and Hachioji Station. The bus itself doesn’t actually run very far, but Hachioji has plenty of cheap hotels and open-all-hours establishments in which to hole up, while Takao Station itself has hardly any; hardly a town to find yourself stuck in on a cold winter’s night.\n\nThe service will run for a limited period of time on certain days in December, during which many “bonenkai” or end-of-year parties are held. At 880 yen (US$7), it’s a little costly, but it’s certainly cheaper than having to shell out for a hotel room, and much more comfortable than a night on the frigid streets.\n\nThe service has already drawn plenty of praise from passengers, with many expressing a wish that the service would become permanent and eventually be rolled out on other lines, too.\n\nSource: NetLab\n\nTop Image: Flickr/Andrew Yee\n\nOrigin: Seasonal rescue bus service rolled out for snoozy passengers who miss their train station\n\nCopyright© RocketNews24 / SOCIO CORPORATION.

Rent a train car for your alumni buddies—beer included\n\nAll aboard the party train!\n\nAlumni parties, or dousoukai, are hugely popular in Japan. Rather than being a once-in-a-blue-moon occasion like a 25-year reunion, many schools and universities in Japan have yearly get-togethers, which range from formal affairs with speeches and souvenirs to informal drunken shindigs. Often the bonds formed during university continue well into adult working life.\n\nThe key to a good party is all in the venue, and you can now rent a train car on the Seibu line for a drinking party with your pals!\n\nThe new venture is part of a campaign run by the Seibu Railway corporation. In recent years, the company has run a series of “beer tours” and mystery tours via train on its routes.\n\nIts target clientele includes those who attended schools which are located along the Seibu Shijuku Line, the Seibu Ikebukuro Line, the Seibu Kokubunji Line, and the Seibu Hajima Line. You can specify which station the train picks you and your buddies up at, and which one it drops you off at for the after-party.\n\nFor 9,000 yen (US$80) a person, the railway provides a party course on one of its distinctive yellow trains, including beer and snacks, which can be reserved through the Syoya Dousoukai website. Bookings will be taken until the end of May, and the actual parties themselves will take place from September to December.\n\nFinally, an excuse to be drunk and rowdy on the train!\n\nSource and inset image: Syoya Dousoukai via Net Lab\n\nFeature image: Flickr/ys-waiz\n\nOrigin: Party on the Seibu line!

On the contrary, this one is bright, very eye-catching, and likely to draw you in to figure out what’s going on.\n\nBut once you’re hooked in, figuring out what’s going on exactly is still a bit of a challenge. The men appear to be addressing molesters and yet it would seem like actual molesters wouldn’t be particularly interested in a poster like this in the first place. The artistic style and forceful yet polite tone of the characters is awfully reminiscent of BL (Boys Love) manga, or at the very least an example of romantic dating sim games.\n\nCommenters were equally confused as to the exact concept behind this public service message from the Aichi Prefectural Police.\n\n“I think a lot of people will mistake that for a romance game ad.”\n\n“That’s totally Boys Love lol.”\n\n“I think women will get the message but they should try reaching the root of the problem: men who molest.”\n\n“That poster is seriously appealing…”\n\n“I can’t figure out who’s talking to who in this poster.”\n\n“I think I read a fanfic of this poster where those three guys gang up on a molester and have their way with him.”\n\n“Are they stupid? Aren’t they just fueling a molester’s sense of inferiority?”\n\n“This may reduce the incidents of molestations against women, but may increase incidents of men getting groped.”\n\n“Are these guys gay or not? I’m confused.”\n\nThe best I can figure is that this poster is aimed at the fujoshi subculture of girls who enjoy BL works and would be attracted to such imagery. Despite the fact the characters appear to be talking directly to molesters, perhaps their indignant tone is actually meant to help empower fujoshi to not let any would-be gropers get away with their crimes and contact the authorities without hesitation when confronted with one.\n\nIt’s also another example of police forces across Japan shedding their stodgy conservative images with some creative ads. I mean, just look at the sparkly stickers they even used to hang the poster.\n\nIt’s also interesting to note that although this poster appears to be aimed at a very specific group of people in Aichi, it has received widespread attention all over the internet and is raising awareness of molesters all over Japan as a result. We’ve heard of stealth marketing for a while now, but could this be the advent of stealth PSAs?\n\nSource: Twitter/@Hirotan_real421 via My Game News Flash (Japanese)\n\nImages: Twitter/@Hirotan_real421\n\n↧"
