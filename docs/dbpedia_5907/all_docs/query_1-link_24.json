Part of this modernization was the construction of railways, the first railway opened between Tokyo and Yokohama in 1872. This was followed by a rapid expansion of the network, both government and privately constructed, so by the early 20th century the bones of a national system were in place. However, by far the largest development of railways in Japan in the second half of the 20th Century has been the development of the Shinkansen (Bullet Train) network.\n\nJapan’s Railways: Kinki to Kyushu ; World Railways Series, Vol. 2 by Dave Spoonley\n\nPublisher: Key Publishing, 2023\n\nISBN-13: 9781802824629\n\nPages: 96pp\n\nAt the start of the Menji Era, Japan emerged from its years of self-imposed isolation and quickly modernised. Part of this modernisation was the construction of the railways – the first of which opened between Tokyo and Yokohama in 1872. The railways were nationalised in the early 1900s and continued to expand, with new line construction continuing through the 1980s. However, the 1980s also brought rising costs and falling revenues, so the state-owned network was split into seven different companies. Each company owns and maintains its section of tracks and operates the trains.\n\nThe Privatisation Of Japanese National Railways by Tatsujiro Ishikawa and Mitsuhide Imashiro\n\nThe Athlone Press London 1998.
