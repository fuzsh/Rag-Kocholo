        "text": "Seibu East Exit, Tobu West Exit\n\nThe East Exit and West Exit are Ikebukuro Station’s largest entrances/exits. You will recognize the East Exit for its commercial area centered on anime and other subcultures, as well as the famous Sunshine City complex. The West Exit is where you'll find Ikebukuro West Gate Park - a popular hangout spot for locals that is immortalized in popular Japanese fiction - and an entertainment zone that is still lively late into the night.\n\nFirst-time tourists, especially those who know some Japanese, often fall into the trap of accidentally walking to the opposite exit, as the signs indicating Seibu (西武, or west-bu) and Tobu (東部, or east-bu) are very misleading for people who want to go to the East Exit (東口, or east-guchi) or West Exit (西口, or west-guchi).\n\nIf you don't want to get lost when heading to either the East Exit or West Exit, just remember the magic formula \"Seibu East Exit, Tobu West Exit\"!\n\nOur Top Tips\n\nJR Pass for Whole Japan\n\nExplore Japan in the most convenient and economical way with a Japan Rail Pass! It is valid for the majority of railways and local buses operated by JR.\n\nPositions of the Exits in Relation to All the Railway Lines\n\nThe 8 lines running through Ikebukuro Station are:\n\nJR East\n\n• Yamanote Line\n\n• Saikyo Line\n\n• Shonan Shinjuku Line\n\nTobu Railway\n\n• Tojo Line\n\nSeibu Railway\n\n• Ikebukuro Line\n\nTokyo Metro\n\n• Marunouchi Line\n\n• Yurakucho Line\n\n• Fukutoshin Line\n\nJR is in the center, with its two sides sandwiched by Seibu and Tobu Railway, and there are three horizontal Metro lines. By remembering these features, it is easy to grasp the overall structure of the Ikebukuro Station railway lines.\n\nUnderground Passageways and Department Stores\n\nThe underground structure of Ikebukuro Station looks like the Japanese character “田”, which is much simpler than the intricate Shinjuku Station. However, you can still get lost if you take the wrong route, especially since there are so many department stores, so it is recommended to refer to the above map when navigating through Ikebukuro Station.\n\n* The ticket gate of the Fukutoshin Line is located in Echika Underground Mall\n\nSome of the Main Attractions at Both Exits\n\nEast Exit\n\nSeibu Department Store\n\nParco Department Store\n\nBic Camera Main Store\n\nYamada Denki\n\nMaruzen Ikebukuro Store\n\nSunshine 60 Street\n\nSunshine City\n\nAnimate Ikebukuro Main Store\n\nOtome Road\n\nPro Tip: If you’re planning an Ikebukuro shopping spree at Yamada Denki or Bic Camera, be sure to save the discount coupons below for a better deal!\n\nWest Exit\n\nTobu Department Store\n\nLumine Department Store\n\nIkebukuro West Gate Park\n\nTokyo Metropolitan Theatre\n\n0101 Marui Department Store\n\nIkebukuro Station originally had a North Exit and a South Exit, but both were located very close to the West Exit. To reduce the confusion, the two exits have been renamed as “West Exit (South)” and “West Exit (North)” respectively since April 2019. It should now be easier for everyone to distinguish between these exits.\n\nThe Owl Statues of Ikebukuro\n\nAt the intersection of the North Passage and Cherry Road in Ikebukuro Station’s underground passageways, there is a stone statue of an owl named “Ikefukuro”. \"Fukuro\" means owl in Japanese and the pronunciation is similar to Ikebukuro. Many people choose to use this owl statue as a meeting point, much like Shibuya Station’s Hachiko statue.\n\nIkebukuro is located in Toshima Ward, which is shaped like a flying owl on the map. As a result, artworks of owls can be seen everywhere in the area. For all of you visiting Ikebukuro, keep your eyes peeled for these funky installations!\n\nOur Top Tips\n\nJapan Shinkansen, Narita Express (N'EX) & Express Train Tickets\n\nPlan ahead by booking your shinkansen, airport train, and express train tickets online in English. Have the tickets sent to you by mail or collect them at the station once you're in Japan.\n\nThere are many more train stations in Japan with puzzling and complicated layouts, but we hope that this article will come in useful the next time you're trying to navigate through Ikebukuro Station. If you get really confused, always remember that you can try asking the station master for help!\n\nIf you want to give feedback on any of our articles, you have an idea that you'd really like to see come to life, or you just have a question on Japan, hit us up on our Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram!\n\nThumbnail: kkb3 / Shutterstock.com"
