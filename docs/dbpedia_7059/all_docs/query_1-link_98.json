They had every intention of going back to the States and having a life together, and chance ensued. She got left behind.\"\n\n\"Then you pick up five years later where everything is changed. You\n\ndon't know who's holding what cards, and who's going to play what.\"\n\nThis is Torres' first acting gig since the cancellation of her freshman\n\nFOX series \"Firefly,\" in which she played the first officer of a\n\ncargo-hauling spaceship 500 years in the future. The series premiered to high hopes last fall but failed to survive into the new year.\n\n\"I feel like I've licked my wounds a little bit and moved on,\" she says.\n\n\"When you're cancelled, and you're involved in a show that you love so\n\nmuch, and the rug gets pulled out from under you, it sucks the hope out of you a little bit. You've got to get back up onto that horse, and this audition was the horse. I booked it and said, 'OK, I can still ride.'\"\n\nThat doesn't mean all is lost for \"Firefly.\" \"There's cooking\n\nhappening,\" Torres says, \"and that's great, the fact that they still believe in it. They're trying to work something out.\"\n\nAlthough Torres recently wed \"Matrix\" and \"Biker Boyz\" star Laurence\n\nFishburne, she hasn't forgotten her \"Firefly\" co-stars, including screen\n\nhusband Alan Tudyk. \"Last week, I was making myself lunch, and I looked\n\nover at Laurence, and I went, \" I love you, but I miss my boys.'\"\n\nPosts: 18,000\n\nThreads: 2,450\n\nJoined: Feb 2003\n\nMORE GINA NEWS!\n\nGina Torres Signed For Three Episodes On Angel\n\nGina Torres who starred in \"Firefly\" earlier this season and appears on \"The Agency\" Saturday (Feb. 15), has signed to do three episodes of \"Angel,\" according to The Hollywood Reporter.

With the show now in its fourth season, where's Anna been all this time?\n\n\"She was presumed dead,\" Torres says. \"It's almost a guarantee they'll bring you back. You never see me die. I just sort of disappear into the night. I think their way of explaining it was, they have a conversation, trying to bring everybody up to speed, and they said, 'I thought she was dead.'\"\n\n....Torres' episodes are \"Echoes,\" airing Wednesday, Feb. 23, and \"A Man of His Word,\" airing Wednesday, March 2 (9 p.m. ET, both nights).\n\nAugust - Jack's Pack Fan # 1, Keeper of the List, 3-Time Speaker of the JoAT Fan Quote of the Week, and the only person ever to have Back 2 Back Jack and Cleo fan quotes !\n\nPosts: 18,000\n\nThreads: 2,450\n\nJoined: Feb 2003\n\nAugust - Jack's Pack Fan # 1, Keeper of the List, 3-Time Speaker of the JoAT Fan Quote of the Week, and the only person ever to have Back 2 Back Jack and Cleo fan quotes !\n\nPosts: 18,000\n\nThreads: 2,450\n\nJoined: Feb 2003\n\nCan't tell if this is a one-shot guest appearance, or recurring. But apparently she plays the wife of a character named Kavanaugh (played by Forrest Whitaker, who is a regular this season) and is in an episode that airs on Tues. March 14th. This usually is on at 10 PM EST on F/X, and then gets rerun a good bit. Might be worth a look tonight to see if she's in it at all, or at least referred to...\n\nAugust - Jack's Pack Fan # 1, Keeper of the List, 3-Time Speaker of the JoAT Fan Quote of the Week, and the only person ever to have Back 2 Back Jack and Cleo fan quotes !\n\nBoomstick\n\nPosting Freak\n\nPosts: 11,934\n\nThreads: 703\n\nJoined: Feb 2003\n\nI haven't seen the show yet, but it seems to have been good for everyone that's appeared on it, so good for Gina!\n\nPosts: 18,000\n\nThreads: 2,450\n\nJoined: Feb 2003\n\nDurn - my cable isn't picking up F/X right now, although it normally does.\n\nShe seems to have played this character - named Sadie Kavanaugh - in at least one other ep, the appropriately titled \"Kavanaugh,\" which aired February 28, 2006. Here's the schedule:\n\nFebruary 28, 2006: Kavanaugh\n\nMarch 7, 2006: Smoked\n\nMarch 14, 2006: Of Mice and Lem - I think she may have been in this one too.\n\nMarch 21, 2006: Postpartum\n\nBut as above - these seem to be rerun a good bit.\n\nVague Ren Pics connections... Kevin Sorbo guested one time on star Michael Chiklis's old series \"The Commish.\" Chiklis went on to play Curly in the tv bio movie about the 3 Stooges, which co-starred Marton Csokas (Sarge's old lover on \"No Thanks,\" many other roles.) And...Michael Chiklis is a Lesbian!\n\nHe is. He's Greek. Family is from the island of Lesbos. :laugh:\n\nHe's also in Sam and Rob's upcoming film \"Rise,\" with Lucy Liu.\n\nAugust - Jack's Pack Fan # 1, Keeper of the List, 3-Time Speaker of the JoAT Fan Quote of the Week, and the only person ever to have Back 2 Back Jack and Cleo fan quotes !\n\nEDSEL_PK\n\nPosting Freak\n\nPosts: 2,328\n\nThreads: 93\n\nJoined: Oct 2005\n\nI've been a fan of Gina for a long time....Hercules, Alias, Firefly..I've seen a lot of her work.\n\nChiklis was great as The Thing from 'Fantastic Four'\n\nBoomstick\n\nPosting Freak\n\nPosts: 11,934\n\nThreads: 703\n\nJoined: Feb 2003\n\nYeah, that was great casting.
