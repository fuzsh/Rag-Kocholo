        "text": "Suits has an unforgettable cast, including the likes of actress Gina Torres, who made an unexpected exit as Jessica Pearson.\n\nIt was at the end of the sixth series of the USA Network and Netflix legal drama that one of the founders of the firm Pearson Hardman, Jessica Pearson (played by Gina Torres), decided to leave.\n\nTired of feeling burnt out with ongoing complications and stresses at work, Jessica decided to move back to Chicago, where she’s from, to start a new legal career.\n\nIt also gave her the chance to make a relationship work with Jeff Malone (DB Woodside) as they left for the Windy City together.\n\nAfter seeing Jessica make her departure, fans couldn’t help but wonder what the real reason was for actress Torres' leaving.\n\nWhy did Gina Torres actress Jessica Pearson leave Suits?\n\nJessica’s exit storyline in Suits mirrored Torres’ reasons for leaving Suits behind as even though she enjoyed starring in the series, it was getting a little too much.\n\nShe had reportedly spent years travelling back and forth between Toronto where the drama was filmed and Los Angeles, where she resided with her daughter and then-husband actor Laurence Fishburne.\n\nBut as her contract with Suits was up during season six, this was seen as a natural opportunity to bow out of the hit show.\n\nShe bluntly told The New York Times in 2016: “My personal life needed to be tended to.”\n\nSince making her exit in 2018, Torres has gone on to star in a number of other shows and films.\n\nOne of her biggest roles to date has been as Tommy Vega in 9-1-1 Lone Star which she featured in for two years.\n\nShe has also been in Riverdale, Westworld, The Legend Of Vox Machina, The Perfect Find and The Everything Pot.\n\nSuits is available to watch on Netflix."
