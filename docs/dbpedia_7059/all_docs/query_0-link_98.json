        "text": "Gina Torres is no stranger to Hollywood. In 2003, the actress landed the role of Cas in The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions, which had her acting opposite her real-life husband, Laurence Fishburne. \"People think we met on the set of Matrix, but we met prior to that,\" she told Bustle in 2022.\n\nIn fact, Gina and Laurence had first become engaged in 2001, with the Morpheus actor keeping the proposal low-key. \"The year that Laurence proposed privately [in 2001], the following day we went to a concert and somebody proposed — not unlike what happened with Adele,\" Gina recalled.\n\n\"I'm sitting in the audience watching this play out and I lean over to Laurence and I said, 'I'm so glad you didn't do that. Thank you for not doing that.' I don't care much for living my life too much out loud.\"\n\nMORE: 9-1-1: Lone Star preview clip: Paul 'unmasks the culprit' after shocking betrayal\n\nREAD: Why is Chimney called Chimney on 9-1-1?

They later welcomed a daughter – Deliah – in 2007.\n\nThe couple went on to co-star in Hannibal in 2014, with Laurence raving to The Guardian about their time on set. \"Working with my wife Gina [Torres] on Hannibal is wonderful. I love working with her and playing opposite her. It's great fun – especially because the material is beautiful and human.\"\n\nA few years later, however, Gina and Laurence officially confirmed their split after the actress released a statement in 2017. It read: \"With heavy hearts, Laurence and I quietly separated and began the dissolution of our marriage in the early fall of last year. There are no bad guys here. Only a love story with a different ending than either one of us had expected.\"\n\n\"Happily, however, our family remains intact,\" she continued. \"And we will continue to raise our daughter together with love and joy and awe, as well as raise each other up with respect and love and the continued understanding that we're in this together, if not side by side.\"\n\nRead more HELLO!
