        "text": "Suits boasted an iconic ensemble during its long run, with actress Gina Torres making a dramatic exit as Jessica Pearson before it came to an end.\n\nThe end of the sixth season of the USA Network and Netflix's legal drama saw firm co-founder Jessica, portrayed by Gina, choose to leave.\n\nExhausted from the relentless drama and stress at the firm, Jessica opted to return to her roots in Chicago to embark on a fresh legal journey.\n\nThis move also allowed her to pursue a romance with Jeff Malone (DB Woodside), as they ventured off to the Windy City together.\n\nViewers were left speculating about the true motive behind Torres' departure from the show.\n\nWhy did Jessica Pearson star Gina Torres leave Suits?\n\nJessica's departure from the narrative of Suits reflected Torres' own reasons for moving on from the series; despite her love for the role, it had become overwhelming.\n\nTorres had been commuting between Toronto, where the show was shot, and Los Angeles, where she lived with her daughter and then-spouse, actor Laurence Fishburne.\n\nWith her Suits contract concluding in the sixth season, it presented a fitting moment for her to gracefully exit the popular series.\n\nShe candidly expressed to The New York Times in 2016: \"My personal life needed to be tended to.\"\n\nSince leaving the show in 2018, Torres has featured in various other television series and movies.\n\nOne of her most notable roles to date has been as Tommy Vega in 9-1-1 Lone Star, where she starred for two years.\n\nShe has also appeared in Riverdale, Westworld, The Legend Of Vox Machina, The Perfect Find and The Everything Pot."
