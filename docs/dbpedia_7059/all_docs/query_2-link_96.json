        "text": "You know what they say, even superheroes deserve a day off. After nearly 30 years of throwing punches, cold AF one-liners, effectively incinerating the patriarchy in The Matrix Reloaded, Alias, and Firefly (just to name a few of her most memorable performances), and amassing legions of fans across the globe, Gina Torres has earned the right to be a little vulnerable sometimes. \"My knees hurt!\" she admits with a laugh. Don't be fooled, though. Torres had just finished an intense workout before she hopped on the phone for our interview.\n\nBut it's this same multidimensionality that Torres strives to unlock as Jessica Pearson, the ruthless managing partner at Pearson Specter Litt on USA Network's hit series Suits. After seven seasons, audiences found Torres so transfixing that she's now got her own spinoff series, aptly titled Pearson, set in the character's native Chicago.\n\nI wanted to make sure that we saw as many women and people of color telling this story.\n\nThe actor, who is also a co-executive producer on the show, wanted to use this opportunity to peel back more of Jessica’s layers. \"I felt like we never really did a deep dive into Jessica on Suits,\" she tells Shondaland.\n\n\"It haunted me that we so rarely got to go home with her or understand what made her tick — especially as a character who held such a position of power, was so important for the people around her, and fought the way she did,\" Torres says. \"Being in the place that I am in my life and at the age that I am, I wanted to understand what it takes to be a Jessica Pearson.\"\n\nThat's why putting on the producer hat for the first time was a non-negotiable for Torres. She wanted to, in essence, assume some of the power that her character exhibits in order to create a storytelling environment that she describes as \"truthfully and respectfully reflective of Chicago\" — on both sides of the camera.\n\n\"I wanted to make sure that we saw as many women and people of color telling this story, running the cameras, creating the sets, and running the sets,\" she says. \"It was important to me that we told significant stories that were of today and resonate with as much of our population as possible. Not just a rarefied five percent.\"\n\nOne of those storylines finds Jessica — now disbarred after bending one too many rules back in her Suits days — in yet another prickly position as the right-hand woman to Mayor Bobby Golec (Morgan Spector), whose penchant for catering to the elite community conflicts with Jessica's moral code. This is exacerbated when she discovers that people of color in Chicago are disproportionately affected by corrupt practices from those in power, like police officers who intentionally abandon their posts in communities of color during a \"Blue Flu.\" Balancing her career with her feelings of community responsibility is something Torres has in common with her character.\n\n\"Successful women and people of color are often asked to choose between their success and how that reflects on their people,\" says Torres, who's Afro-Latina like her character on the show. \"It's not as simple as — forgive me — white America. If you're in any position of power, a public position, or if the world is watching you to some degree, as is the case for people in entertainment, [the question is always:] What are you saying to your people? That can be incredibly overwhelming and intimidating. That's what we're seeing through Jessica.\"\n\nFor years, Torres has contended with this staggering level of responsibility playing a female character who is as uncompromising with men as she is with women. Jessica is a ballbuster and remains unapologetic about it in Pearson, something Torres loves.\n\n\"What was great about being able to move into this next chapter of Jessica's life is finding out that she is still the woman whose bad side you don't want to get on,\" Torres says. \"It is not, and nor was it ever, important to me that Jessica be likable. It is important to me that she be relatable and a completely realized human being, and that people understood why she did the things that she did, the sacrifice that takes its toll, and that she's not always sure of the things that she's doing.\"\n\nThere's a part of me that would just love to have my version of a 'John Wick' renaissance.\n\nThough Torres is revered by many as one of the best on-screen heroines of our time, she — like Jessica — has never had a desire to adhere to anyone's standards and is even reluctant about being called a role model.\n\n\"I don't think that's something somebody sets out to be,\" she says. \"I'm an actress that set out to work [laughs]. That's been my goal; to work, feed myself, and take care of my family. I have been incredibly blessed to be able to inhabit characters that speak to people and inspire a new generation of women in particular, and women of color more specifically. So if I can keep doing that, then yay.\"\n\nBut Torres admits that she feels extra badass whenever she gets to play iconic characters like Zoë Washburne on Firefly.\n\n\"I can't lie, It's really cool when I see myself pop up on these shows I've done over the years and I'm kicking major butt,\" says Torres. \"There's a part of me that would just love to have my version of a John Wick renaissance, to show up in one of these movies and do my thing — as my swan song. I watch every punch those boys throw in The Expendables or John Wick, and I know what it takes.\"\n\nCandice Frederick is a New York-based film and television journalist.
