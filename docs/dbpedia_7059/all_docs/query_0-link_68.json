        "text": "A fabulous Gina Torres graces the screen in Netflix's romantic comedy A Perfect Find. Alas, she's not the main character, but she steals the show with her versatility in the role.\n\nTorres portrays Darcy Hale, an intensely competitive media mogul, founder of the publication Darzine. She's successful, fashionable and the protective single mother of her only son, Eric (Keith Powers).\n\nNow in a position of power, she gloats when longtime rival Jenna Jones (Gabrielle Union) begs her for a job after getting fired and a suffering a humiliating public breakup. Darcy hires her, but things get complicated when Jenna meets a younger man outside of work, who turns out to be her new boss's son!\n\nThe film may be a rom-com, but there are several issues it tackles about social norms, age and women’s career expectations and obstacles.\n\n\"I think we are certainly in a time in our lives and in our history where social norms are being challenged daily,\" states Torres. \"And we're beginning to realize what exactly is a social norm and what made it a social norm and why... because everybody that is not adhering to social norms, we're talking about communities and people and ways of life that have existed since time.\n\nAnd to be able to live your truth and live it out loud... whether it's a woman past the age of 40 that's reinventing herself, whether it is someone in the LGBTQ community that's also not afraid of finding love, whether it's a woman in power that could care less about how intimidating she is and really just wants everybody to level up to be their best. These are all things that I believe are important to see and are important to represent.\"\n\nRepresentation is important for Torres. And although there's no mention of her heritage, she slides in some Spanish phrases in the film, something she often does in her role as Capt. Tommy Vega on Fox’s 9-1-1: Lone Star.\n\n\"I'm 100% American and 100% Cuban. That's how I see life... and to be able to give a little bit of that flavor to the characters I play is a great pleasure and an honor.\"\n\nAlthough she has been fortunate to be able to play a wide variety of characters, the actress says there should be more representation of Afro-Latinos in English and Spanish-language film and television.\n\n\"There's a very easy fix. Just bring more Afro-Latinos to the small and big screen and show the whole world that Latinos aren't just the European image we've been raised with... but that we come in many colors and many lifestyles.\"\n\nTorres says some aspects of Darcy's personality resonated with her, and thinks it's time strong, confident women business women stop being maligned.\n\n\"I loved her passion. I loved her intelligence. I loved how committed she was to being the best. And yes, women in positions of power are often interpreted, especially in film as being difficult and hard asses and bitches, where men who may behave in exactly the same way are simply thought of as powerful and decisive. And that is a stereotype that I believe just needs to die. I think we should all be able to get the job done in a way that is unapologetic for our power.\"\n\nA Perfect Find is available on Netflix worldwide, starting today, June 23."
