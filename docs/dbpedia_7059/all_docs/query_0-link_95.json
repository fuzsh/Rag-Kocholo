        "text": "The bulk of the action in the USA Network legal drama Suits, which has become a sensation on streaming this summer, takes place at the law firm Pearson Hardman. Jessica Pearson, as played by Gina Torres, is one of the founders of the firm, but she is not part of the legal action for all nine seasons of the show. Here’s when — and why — Jessica Pearson leaves Suits.\n\nFor the first six seasons of Suits, Jessica is a constant presence. She is one of the managing partners of the prestigious law firm where she frequently butted heads with her more risk-taking collegaues, Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht) and Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams). Torres, who played Pearson, enjoyed her time on the show but it was real-life issues, pegged to a convenient contract ending, that prompted her to step away from her role on the show.\n\nRELATED: Who Plays Jessica Pearson on Suits? A Guide to Gina Torres' Career\n\n“My personal life needed to be tended to,” she told The New York Times in 2016.\n\nShe had spent the past several years traveling back and forth between Toronto, where the show was filmed, and Los Angeles, where she lived with her daughter and her husband, Laurence Fishburne of The Matrix fame. Because her contract was up, it was a natural opportunity for her to depart.\n\nThis is the premise of Pearson, which made its debut on the USA Network in July of 2019. Pearson only ran for one season, before it was canceled. However, for fans of Jessica, the good news is that there are seven seasons of Suits featuring her and one entire season of an entire show about her."
