        "text": "“Suits” and “Pearson” alum Gina Torres has joined Fox’s “9-1-1: Lone Star” as a series regular for its upcoming second season, the broadcast network announced Thursday.\n\nHer addition to the Rob Lowe-led “9-1-1” spinoff series marks a reunion with Tim Minear — the showrunner of both of “9-1-1” and “Lone Star” — who was a writer and executive producer on Joss Whedon’s short-lived “Firefly,” which Torres starred on alongside Nathan Fillion.\n\nPer Fox, Torres will play paramedic captain Tommy Vega on “9-1-1: Lone Star” Season 2. Vega “was at the top of her game when she hung up her uniform to raise her twin daughters. For eight years life was great, until COVID-19 changed her life. With her husband’s restaurant going under, Tommy has no choice but to re-enter the workforce to support her family. Though it breaks her heart to be apart from her little girls, Tommy will show the world that no matter how much time has passed, when she puts on that uniform, she’s still a boss.”\n\n“9-1-1: Lone Star” is set in Austin, TX and explores the “high-pressure experiences of police officers, firefighters and dispatchers who are thrust into the most frightening, shocking and heart-stopping situations,” according to its official description. “These emergency responders must try to balance saving those who are at their most vulnerable with solving the problems in their own lives.\n\n“We are so excited to be expanding our ‘9-1-1-verse’ with the addition of Gina Torres,” Minear said in a statement. “I’ve been dying to write for her again ever since ‘Firefly.’ Gina brings warmth, intelligence and command to everything she does. 2020 is finally looking up.”\n\nCreated by Minear, Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, “9-1-1: Lone Star” is scheduled to begin production on Season 2 in Los Angeles later this fall for a premiere in early 2021, according to Fox.\n\nThe series is produced by 20th Television in association with Ryan Murphy Television and Brad Falchuk Teley-Vision. Murphy, Falchuk and Minear executive produce the series alongside Alexis Martin Woodall, Bradley Buecker, Rashad Raisani, John J. Gray, Angela Bassett and Lowe.\n\nTorres is repped by Framework Entertainment, Domain Talent, and Schreck Rose Dapello."
