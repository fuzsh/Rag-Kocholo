        "text": "Adriana Michaels. Device. Per saltire sable and Or, four crosses crosslet counterchanged Or and vert.\n\nAidan MacLachlan. Name.\n\nThe submitter requested authenticity for 16th C Scots. Although the name Aidan is the standard Anglicization for the saint's name found as Aedan, it is not a name found in the general Scots or English naming pool. Therefore, we are unable to make this name authentic for 16th C Scotland. He might be interested in the similar sounding name Ade (pronounced like \"Eddy\"), a double-diminutive of Adam. Black, Surnames of Scotland, dates Ade to the 16th C.\n\nAlexandra Gray. Name and device. Quarterly sable and ermine, a tyger rampant contourny azure.\n\nNice name!\n\nAlis inghean Mhaoláin. Name and device. Per pale Or and sable, three mullets counterchanged.\n\nAvelina del Dolce. Name.\n\nThis name mixes English or French with Italian, in either case, this is one step from period practice.\n\nBlackwater, Shire of. Branch name.\n\nBóvi farmaðr. Name and device. Or, a quatrefoil and a chief embattled sable.\n\nNice armory!\n\nBrion Donall Gilbert. Name change from Brion Domhnall Mac Ghille Brighde.\n\nThis name uses a double-given name in an Anglicized Gaelic context; this is unattested, but has been declared one step from period practice.\n\nThis old name, Brion Domhnall Mac Ghille Brighde, is released.\n\nCadell Blaidd Du. Badge. Gules, on a fess argent three mallets palewise gules, a bordure argent.\n\nCera ingen Chernaich. Name.\n\nCett Donegal. Device. Gules, three eagle's jambes erased a la quise contourny Or.\n\nConstantine Blackhart. Name and device. Per pale vert and sable, a crux ansata within an orle Or.\n\nDmitrii Zhirov. Device. Per bend sable and bendy argent and sable, a bend sinister counterchanged.\n\nElaine Flamme. Device. Azure, three open books and a bordure engrailed argent.\n\nEldjarn the Thoghtful. Name (see RETURNS for device).\n\nSubmitted as Eldjarn the Thoughtful, as submitted the name is two steps from period practice. First, it combines Old Norse and English, and second, the spelling of the byname dates to the mid 16th C (more than 300 years from the end of the Viking age). The Oxford English Dictionary shows the spelling thoghtful, meaning \"prudent\" or \"reflective\" dated to 1300. We have changed the name to Eldjarn the Thoghtful to clear the temporal incompatibility problem.\n\nEldjarn the Thoghtful. Device. Quarterly azure and argent, in annulo a mermaid embowed and a merman embowed inverted counterchanged.\n\nSeveral commenters suggested that this device violates what is usually called the \"sword-and-dagger\" rule, the use of two heraldically identical but blazonably different charges. However, the Pictorial Dictionary states that both the mermaid and the merman are period charges, dating to the 14th Century and 1575 respectively. Furthermore, research suggests that the use of male/female couples as supporters is a pattern found in period heraldry. Frederick Warneckes Rare Book-Plates (Ex-Libris) of the XVth and XVIth XVIth Centuries, for example, shows, on p. 92, a 16th coat of arms supported by a male and a female savage and, on p. 21, a 15th C marital achievement supported by a man and woman clothed in the style of the period. Given this pattern in supporters, it seems reasonable to allow a male/female couple as a charge group, especially since, in this case, both the mermaid and the merman are period charges that do not seem to have been used interchangeably in period.\n\nElizabeth Stephenson. Name and device. Sable, a horse rampant and on a chief argent three crescents azure.\n\nEmma Idone. Device. Purpure, a foxglove slipped and leaved argent and in chief three mullets Or.\n\nEmrys Gwynedd. Name.\n\nThis name does not conflict with the registered name Emrys Cynedd, registered January 1994. The two bynames have different derivations, and the leading consonent+vowel combination of both is significantly different in sound.\n\nFaílenn ingen Chernaich. Name and device. Purpure, a horse passant and on a base argent three triquetras two and one vert.\n\nGavin Kent. Device. Azure, a fret couped argent, on a bordure argent an orle of oak leaves in orle vert.\n\nThe bordure on this device was originally blazoned semy of oak leaves. We would expect, however, that strewn charges would all be oriented more or less in the same direction, with perhaps a slight tilt to those on the slanted bottom portion of the bordure. The oak leaves on this bordure, however, are oriented head to tail. We have reblazoned the device to follow the pattern established by precedent for this arrangement on a field: \"In a charge group blazoned as An orle of [charges] in orle, the charges are arranged in orle and the postures of the charges tilt so that they follow each other. Thus, an orle of fish naiant would all be in the default naiant (fesswise) posture, but an orle of fish naiant in orle swim head to tail\" [Olivia de Calais, 09/03, A-Ansteorra].\n\nKaterina McGilledoroughe. Badge. Per pale gules and vert, a catamount sejant argent pellety and on a chief raguly argent a chain throughout sable.\n\nKatla úlfhéðinn. Name and device. Per pale gules and sable, three snakes nowed argent.\n\nSubmitted as Katla úlfheðinn, the documentation shows the byname as úlfhéðinn. In Old Norse transliterations, accents should be either used consistently or dropped consistently. Therefore, we have changed the name to Katla úlfhéðinn.\n\nKyriell Hawkmoon. Badge. Argent, a hawk belled azure within a bordure embattled sable.\n\nMairi filia Andreas. Name and badge. Barry wavy argent and azure, a bordure sable semy of broadarrows points to center Or.\n\nMatteo Pesci. Name and device. Per fess engrailed argent and azure, a natural catfish haurient embowed and a bordure counterchanged.\n\nGood cant!\n\nMegan the Mad. Name and device. Per bend sinister vert and azure, a dragon segreant maintaining in saltire a rapier and an arrow inverted, a chief indented Or.\n\nThe name Megan is SCA-compatible.\n\nMegan the Mad. Badge. Per pale vert and gules, a dragon's head couped Or, overall two rapiers in saltire argent.\n\nMuirenn ingen uí Muirchertaig. Name.\n\nSubmitted as Muireann ingen uí Muirchertaig, the submitter requested an authentic Irish name. Muireann is the Early Modern Irish from of this name; Ó Corrain and Maguire, Irish Names s.n. Muirenn, list Muirenn as the Middle Irish spelling. As the rest of the name is Middle Irish, we have changed this name to Muirenn ingen ui Muirchertaig to comply with her request for authenticity.\n\nOdriana vander Brugghe. Name reconsideration from Adriana vander Brugghe and device change. Azure, a chief ermine.\n\nHer previous submission of this name was changed to Adriana vander Brugghe because of a request for authenticity. She has requested a reconsideration and removed the authenticity request. As submitted, the name is registerable, but there is a more than 300-year gap between the dates for the given name and the byname. This is one step beyond period practice.\n\nHer old name, Adriana vander Brugghe, is released.\n\nPlease advise the submitter to draw far fewer ermine spots on the chief.\n\nHer former device, Argent, an acorn vert, a bordure wavy sable semy of oak leaves argent, is released.\n\nOeric Lestrange. Household name House Gold Scorpion and badge. Purpure, a scorpion within a bordure embattled Or.\n\nPepin le Fouinon. Name and device. Ermine, two weasels combattant within a bordure sable.\n\nRenata Rouge. Name and device. Per bend purpure and sable, a winged tower argent.\n\nRichart Parion. Name and device. Azure, a falcon striking to sinister and on a chief argent three praying mantises sejant erect guardant contourny vert.\n\nThe translation of the documentation defined the name Parion as meaning \"peer, equal, companion.\" Many commenters remarked that a name meaning \"peer\" might be considered presumptuous. To declare this, though, would be an overly strict interpretation of a fairly loose translation. The documentation for Parion in the original language is \"Parion n. occitan <<pareil, égal>> (*v. aussi PARIER) <<compagnon>> en anc. fr.\" Roughly, Parion, an occitan name meaning <<like, equal>> also PARIER <<companion>> in ancient French.\" The word \"peer\", meaning \"an equal,\" is a valid translation, but it should not be considered a claim to rank.\n\nRosamund Peacock. Device. Azure, on a chevron between three peacocks in their pride Or three roses proper.\n\nGood cant!\n\nRuaidri Gabhar. Name and device. Vert, a goat rampant within a bordure Or.\n\nSubmitted as Ruaidri Gabhair, Gabhair is the genitive (possessive) case of Gabhar. In Gaelic, animal bynames are typically written in the nominative case. We have changed the name to Ruaidri Gabhar to correct the grammar.\n\nSáerlaith an Einigh. Device. Per chevron vert and argent, two triskelions arrondi argent and an acorn slipped and leaved proper.\n\nSéamus Macpherson. Name.\n\nThis does not conflict with James MacPherson, a Scottish poet who collected written and oral Gaelic poetic sources in the mid-18th C. He produced a number of works that he claimed were based on the work of a 3rd C Gaelic poet, but his claims were later discredited. James MacPherson is not important enough to protect. However, if he had been, the names would be an aural conflict. Although Seamus is a Gaelic name and James an English or Scots name, the pronunciations of the two are easily confused and therefore too close in sound not to conflict.\n\nSebastian Wolfgang von Bayern. Name (see RETURNS for device).\n\nSeth MacMichael. Badge. (Fieldless) A gorilla passant contourny argent charged on the shoulder with a beehive gules and maintaining a staff topped with a lantern Or.\n\nSophie Davenport. Device. Gules, a scorpion bendwise sinister argent.\n\nTat'iana Kionova. Device. Azure, two natural dolphins in annulo argent and on a chief ermine a stag at gaze proper.\n\nThorgrim Skullsplitter. Name (see RETURNS for device).\n\nÞyri erbewyf. Name (see RETURNS for device).\n\nSubmitted as Thyri erbewyf, the submitter requested authenticity for the 10th-12th C. While this name is registerable, it is not authentic for this time period. The given name Thyri is a proposed anglicization of the attested 11th C Norse name, Þyri. However, no documentation was presented and none found that this name was used by English speakers in period. In Old English and in early Middle English, words containing the \"th\" sound represented by the letter Þ are almost always spelled with Þ instead of Th. The Old Norse spelling Þyri is more consistent with attested English spellings for this time than the proposed Thyri. It is unclear whether this is the best Anglicization, but it is a possible one. Therefore, we are changing the name to Þyri to partially comply with her request for authenticity.\n\nThe byname erbewyf was not adequately documented; no language, time period, or etymology were provided for this name. It appears to be a constructed byname rather than an attested one. The OED derives the word herb from the Old French erbe and dates its earliest example of the word in English to 1290. Furthermore, a search through the Oxford English Dictionary found dates for formations like \"occupation\" + wife around the end of the 13th C. Therefore, this byname is impossible with an Old Norse name, and highly unlikely with an English name from her desired period. However, it is registerable as a constructed byname following patterns found in Middle English.\n\nWe have not been able to locate a 10th-12th C English byname with a similar meaning, but there does seem to be an Old Norse byname with an appropriate meaning. Orle notes:\n\nThere isn't a differentiation in Old Norse texts between an herbalist and a physician. Women took both roles, and the name for a physician was <læknir>, a masculine noun derived from the word for \"leek\", which was also used as a synonym for a medicinal herb. Ólafs saga Helga, a part of Snorri Sturluson's Heimskringla, gives us one of the very few accounts of Viking Age medical treatment in chapter 234, where the healers, all explicitly women, are called <læknirinn> (the noun with the definite article \"inn\" suffixed). Droplaugarsona saga uses <læknir> directly as a woman's occupational byname in ch. 11 for <Álfgerðr læknir> (see http://www.snerpa.is/net/isl/droplaug.htm).\n\nIf the submitter is interested in an entirely Old Norse name, then we suggest Þyri læknir\n\nTuathflaith ingen uí Chellaich. Name.\n\nWilhelma von Ravensburg. Device. Quarterly argent and azure, two ravens azure.\n\nZomyw Chenad. Name and device. Azure, the lowercase letter lambda and on a chief argent a carrot azure.\n\nThe submitter requested an authentic 10th C Hungarian name. While both names elements can be dated to the 15th C, neither dates to the 10th C. Therefore, while he has a lovely 15th C Hungarian name, we do not know if it is authentic for the 10th C.\n\nAlainne d'Ancenis. Name and device. Azure, a Latin cross of Toulouse and on a chief argent a fleur-de-lys azure between two crescents sable.\n\nAlexandra Scott de Northumberland. Device. Argent, a stag statant and on a chief azure an increscent between two mullets of six points Or.\n\nAmie Sparrow. Device. Per pale Or and vert, an eagle counterchanged within a bordure ermine.\n\nAnne la Settere. Name change from Anne of Isenfir.\n\nHer old name, Anne of Isenfir, is released.\n\nAnneke Raudhe. Name and device. Per pale azure and sable, a unicorn rampant contourny argent within a bordure Or semy-de-lys azure.\n\nArabella Muyr. Name.\n\nArabella Muyr. Name.\n\nBarre FitzRobert of York. Device change. Sable, a sheaf of three spears and in chief three suns Or.\n\nHis former device, Azure, a sheaf of three spears and in chief three suns Or, is retained as a badge.\n\nBasilio Branquo. Name and device. Or, a bull couchant gules gorged of a garland of flowers argent.\n\nBeatrix von Leipzig. Name.\n\nCyriac Grymsdale. Badge. Sable, a closed book between in cross four quill pens in annulo argent.\n\nPrecedent from June 2003 justifies the use of the term in annulo to blazon the relative position of items placed base to tip. A more recent precedent uses this June 2003 precedent in blazoning Quarterly sable and argent, in cross four fleurs-de-lys in annulo counterchanged and says, \"The fleurs-de-lys here follow a similar mutual orientation to the charges in the above precedent. Four charges cannot be in annulo; their arrangement must be specified. For this and other similar cases, the arrangement of the charges is blazoned before the charges are identified, and their (mutual) orientation is blazoned afterwards\" [Fu Ching Lan, 09/04, Acc-Caid].The arrangement of Cyriac's quill pens is identical to the fleurs-de-lys described in the September 2004 precedent so we have adopted the same form for the blazon.\n\nDafydd Balch de Cantref Blaidd. Name (see PENDS for device).\n\nDeborah Morrison. Device. Vert, on a pale between two fleurs-de-lys Or a tower vert.\n\nDiana of Storvik. Name.\n\nThe submitter requested authenticity for 16th C English. While the given name, Diana, is dated to 1580, the byname of Storvik does not appear to be English and certainly not 16th C English. Therefore, we are unable to fulfill her request for authenticity.\n\nDun Carraig, Barony of. Reblazon of badge. (Fieldless) Three sinister wings conjoined in pall argent.\n\nOriginally blazoned (Fieldless) Three sinister wings conjoined in pall inverted argent, a visual inspection showed that the wings are actually in pall not in pall inverted. We have reblazoned the badge to match the emblazon.\n\nElaine Landers. Name.\n\nElena di Salaparuta. Name change from Elaine Gilbert (see RETURNS for device and badge).\n\nHer old name, Elaine Gilbert, is retained as an alternate name.\n\nElizabeth atte Blacksterre. Name and device. Gules, a butterfly and in base two bars wavy, on a chief argent three decrescents gules.\n\nGeoffrey Hawkwood. Device. Per pale sable and vert, two lions Or.\n\nGlynis Gwynedd. Name and device. Argent, on a tree eradicated proper a harp Or, a bordure wavy vert.\n\nGlynis is the submitter's legal given name.\n\nGregor von Leipzig. Name and device. Or, a chevron vert between three porcupines rampant azure.\n\nPorcupines are indeed a period heraldic charge, dated to 1445 in the arms of Eyre (Parker, p. 473).\n\nGrimald Rauening. Device. Argent, on a raven sable a mullet of six points Or.\n\nGood cant!\n\nHans Van Hoorn. Device change. Per fess gules and azure, a fess wavy between a baker's peel fesswise Or charged with three manchets gules and a wagon wheel Or.\n\nHis former device, Per fess gules and azure, a fess between a baker's peel reversed Or charged with three manchets gules and a wagon wheel Or, is released.\n\nHans Van Hoorn. Badge. (Fieldless) A baker's peel fesswise reversed Or charged with three manchets gules.\n\nIamys Hamlin. Device. Per chevron Or and vert, two sprigs of hops fructed and a garb counterchanged.\n\nIriniia Kiianina. Name.\n\nJames Sutherland of Inverness. Name.\n\nKatherine O'Carroll. Name.\n\nLidia de Ragusa. Name and badge. (Fieldless) A fox's mask azure.\n\nLylie of Birkenhead. Name.\n\nMagdalina Ilianova. Name.\n\nMelcher Lloyd of Hawkwood. Name and device. Per bend gules and azure, two dragons segreant addorsed and in base a mullet, a bordure embattled Or.\n\nMelisent la Ruse. Name.\n\nMuriel filia Donaldi de Skia. Name.\n\nSubmitted as Muriel filia Donaldi, a timely letter of correction was issued requesting that the name be considered as Muriel filia Donaldi de Insulis. The submitter indicated that if this form was not registerable, she would accept Muriel filia Donaldi de Skia. The name Muriel filia Donaldi de Insulis is not presumptuous of the historical Donaldi Rex de Insulis; as Metron Ariston notes, he does not have his own article in Encylopedia Britannica or other general reference works, although he does bear some importance in period. However, it can be viewed as a claim to be a daughter of the chief of one of the branches of the Clan MacDonald, whose title is the MacDonald of the Isles. We have changed the name to Muriel filia Donaldi de Skia, the submitter's other choice, in order to register it.\n\nNiccolina the Wanderer. Name and device. Per bend sable and purpure, a decrescent and a mullet argent.\n\nThe question arose whether this name was two steps from period practice. There appeared to be one step for mixing Italian and English and a second for using the Wanderer, a byname previously declared SCA-compatible. However, Metron Ariston noted:\n\nI would aver that the Lingua Anglica allowance does apply to the byname since it is one of the standard translations for the Italian surname Pellegrino. While I have not been able to find clear-cut examples of pellegrino used as an inherited byname in the early Renaissance period, there is little doubt that it could be used as a descriptive and I was able to find at least one clear-cut baptismal record from the \"grey area\" for one Maddalena Pellegrino who was baptized on 18 January, 1643, at Girifalco (<http://www.girifalco.net/paginebianche/2000/nov00/PAG12-~2.HTM>).\n\nA check of various Italian-English dictionaries shows wanderer as a standard translation of pellegrino, although pilgrim is the typical translation. Therefore, the byname the Wanderer is registerable as a Lingua Anglica translation of the Italian byname Pellegrino.\n\nOisséne na gCeann mac Baiscind. Name change from James Oleveir.\n\nSubmitted as Oisséne na gCeann mac Baiscind, this name is two steps from period practice. First, it mixes Old or Middle Irish with Early Modern Irish. Second, there is a more than 300 year gap between the date for the given name/patronymic and the descriptive byname. MacBain's etymological dictionary gives cenn as the Old Irish form for the Early Modern Irish ceann. Therefore, we have changed the name to Oisséne na Cenn mac Baiscindin order to register it.\n\nHis old name, James Oleveir, is retained as an alternative name.\n\nRoana de Laci. Badge. (Fieldless) A goblet inverted purpure.\n\nRoark of Hydra Hall. Reblazon of device. Per pale gules and sable, a wingless hydra affronty and a chief embattled Or.\n\nOriginally blazoned Per pale gules and sable, a hydra affronty and a chief embattled Or, we have reblazoned this device to specify that the hydra is wingless.\n\nRohesia Kenneswyn. Name.\n\nRónán mac an Stalcair. Device. Per pall argent azure and sable, a wyvern erect argent and in chief a compass star sable.\n\nSara le Swete. Name.\n\nTemair MacDiarmada. Badge. Per pale Or and sable, three roses counterchanged.\n\nTheresa of Caid. Name and device. Gules, a dragon rampant contourny argent between four mullets in cross, a bordure Or.\n\nTheresa is the submitter's legal given name.\n\nTheron Andronikos. Device. Gules, a heron contourny within a bordure rayonny Or.\n\nAmariah of Chufut-Kale. Name.\n\nThe submitter requested an authentic 10th C Jewish name. While this name is registerable as a transliterated Hebrew name and a Lingua Anglica translation of a Turkish placename, there is no way to make it authentic. First, Amariah is a Biblical name; while such names are generally registerable, no documentation was submitted and none found showing that this name was part of the general Jewish naming pool in the Middle Ages. Furthermore, while the town that became Chufut-Kale (translated as \"Jewish Fortress\") existed in the 8th C, it was not named Chufut-Kale until the 15th C. Furthermore, while it was a Jewish center in the later Middle Ages, according to the Columbia Encyclopedia article, http://www.bartleby.com/65/ch/ChufutKa.html, the earliest Jewish inscription in the town dates back to only 1203.\n\nBera skytja. Name and device. Purpure, a rose argent slipped and leaved vert and on a chief argent three mullets pierced sable.\n\nBrandr húslangr. Name.\n\nDagán Archer. Name.\n\nThis name mixes Gaelic and English; this is one step from period practice.\n\nEleanor de Venoix. Name.\n\nEmmeline Dernelove. Name.\n\nHadassa Rubinsdochter van der Meer. Name and device. Per pale argent and sable, in pale a roundel counterchanged and a talbot passant gules.\n\nSubmitted as Hadassah Rubensdochter van der Meer, the submitter requested a Jewish name authentic for the Netherlands in the 16th C. Hadassah is a Biblical name; no documentation was submitted and none found showing it was used as a given name in the 16th C. The submitter's documentation shows that the modern Dutch transliteration of this name is Hadassa. Loveday Toddekyn, Names from Bruges, 1400-1600, shows Rubin dated 1400-1550. We have changed the name to Hadassa Rubinsdochter van der Meer to partially comply with the submitter's request for authenticity.\n\nHelena Lyristes. Name (see RETURNS for device).\n\nIðuna breiðrazi. Name.\n\nSeveral commenters questioned whether Iðuna was an attested Old Norse form. Reaney and Wilson, A Dictionary of English Surnames s.n. Iddon, derive Iddone from \"Probably ON Iðunn, Iðuna.\" While this is not proof positive, it is sufficient to give the submitter the benefit of the doubt.\n\nJohn Barrington of Essex. Name.\n\nNuala níc Ailín. Device change. Per pale argent and sable, two fleurs-de-lys counterchanged.\n\nNice armory!\n\nHer former device, Vert semy-de-lys argent, on flaunches Or two Skye terriers combattant sable, is retained as a badge.\n\nSafiya bint Nasr al-Samiriyya. Name and device. Purpure, an owl stooping argent.\n\nSubmitted as Safiya as Samira bint Nasr, the submitter accepted minor changes but noted name elements could be rearranged to give the desired meaning \"Safiya of Samira, daughter of Nasr.\" al-Jamal notes: \"the usage as Samira is a claim to be the town of Samira. A female person from there would be al-Samiriyya...The more usual grammar of Arabic name construction would place the geographic last: Safiya bint Nasr al-Samiriyya.\" We have changed the name to Safiya bint Nasr al-Samiriyya to give the name the appropriate meaning.\n\nThis device does not conflict with Guinivere of Shadowes Wode, Purpure, an owl affronty argent, atop a lantern Or its candle argent flammant Or, reblazoned in the East section of this letter. The lantern in Guinivere's device is clearly co-primary so there are CDs for removing the lantern and changing the posture of the owl.\n\nSophia de Leon. Reblazon of device. Per saltire azure and argent, in pale two crosses annulety arms formy and voided and in fess two lions combattant counterchanged.\n\nThe original blazon of this device, Per saltire azure and argent, in cross two crosses formy voided annuleted and two lions combattant counterchanged, led some commenters to think that the crosses were charged with annulets rather than having arms that end in annulets. We have reblazoned the crosses in an effort to describe them more clearly.\n\nUngust filius Antonii. Name correction from Ungust Filius Antonii.\n\nHis old name, Ungust Filius Antonii, is released.\n\nYxna-Sigarr. Name.\n\nAlthough the name presents the appearance of a single name, it is, in fact, a prepended byname and a given name. This formation is not uncommon in Old Norse, although such combinations often became given names themselves. We have registered such names in the past without comment, notably Burlu-Oláfr, registered January 1992.\n\nAaron the Arrowsmith. Name.\n\nAldwyn de Lancashire. Name and device. Per pale sable and vert, a chevron between three lions argent.\n\nThe submitter indicated that he was interested in a 14th C English name but did not request that his name be made authentic for this period. The byname de Lancashire is dated to the 16th C in the submitter's documentation; the form de Lancastreshire is dated to the late 14th C in the same document. Aldwyn de Lancestreshire would be a lovely 14th C form of this name.\n\nAlys Mackyntoich. Alternate name Alays de Brantôme.\n\nAlys Mackyntoich. Name change from Ailis Catriona Mac an Toisich.\n\nHer old name, Ailis Catriona Mac an Toisich, is released.\n\nAnna Dauzzano da Siracusa. Name and device. Argent, a dolphin naiant sable, a bordure gules.\n\nPlease advise the submitter to draw the bordure substantially wider and to more carefully center the dolphin in the future.\n\nArthur Lovell. Name.\n\nAscelinne de Chambord. Device. Argent, a chevron sable between three unicorns' heads couped azure.\n\nThe submitter has a letter of permission to conflict from James of Riverhold, Argent, a chevron sable between in chief two mermaids each maintaining a sword and in base a crescent azure.\n\nBenjamin d'Orb. Name.\n\nBois Ardent, Canton of. Branch name and device. Or, a tree within a laurel wreath vert and on a chief rayonny gules a lizard reguardant breathing flames argent.\n\nSome commenters questioned the formation Bois+surname given only one example of this formation. We note that the word ardent is also an adjective. The entry for Bois in Dauzaut and Rostaing, Dictionnaire étymologique des noms de lieux en France gives several derivations for placenames containing this element. One is \"determine par un adjectif\" (determine by an adjective). As Ardent is an adjective meaning \"burning,\" this is a valid placename formation.\n\nCaera Cruitire ingen Uaithne. Name change from holding name Caera of Carolingia and device. Azure, a cauldron and in chief three harps Or.\n\nCaera is the submitter's legal given name.\n\nCristobal Ordonez de Burgos. Name.\n\nCristoforo Donatello dei Visconti. Name.\n\nIn the cover letter of April 1994, the byname Visconti was ruled registerable as part of a name that did not make a territorial claim:\n\nWhile both surnames Marchesi and Visconti are derived, in a more or less roundabout fashion, from the Italian equivalents of Marquess and Viscount, they were also clearly documented as surnames used by non-nobles. As a consequence, the applicable part of RfS VI.1. would be \"Names documented to have been used in period may be used, even if they were derived from titles, provided there is no suggestion of territorial claim or explicit assertion of rank. For example, `Regina the Laundress' is acceptable but `Regina of Germany' is not.\" In the cases here, both names have been documented to have been used in period, and neither is used in such a way as to suggest either a territorial claim or an assertion of rank. That being so, both names have been registered.\n\nDag of the Bridge. Holding name and device (see RETURNS for name).

Name change from Gaufrid Kelson Blacksword.\n\nThis name combines English and German; this is one step from period practice.\n\nGeneviére d'Alsace. Name and device. Azure semy of estoiles Or, a chevron between three martlets, a bordure argent.\n\nGuinivere of Shadowes Wode. Reblazon of device. Purpure, in pale an owl affronty argent atop a lantern Or its candle argent enflamed Or.\n\nOriginally blazoned Purpure, an owl affronty argent, atop a lantern Or its candle argent flammant Or, we have reblazoned this device to show that the owl and the lantern are co-primary.\n\nGwenhwyfar Dinas Emrys. Badge. Or, a stag statant proper, on a chief vert three acorns slipped and leaved Or.\n\nAlthough the Letter of Intent showed this armory on a device form, it also stated that the submitter actually wants a badge, The kingdom has provided us with the appropriate forms, which are similar enough in appearance to allow us to register the badge without additional commentary.\n\nGwenllian Anwyl. Name.\n\nJeannette of Bhakail. Device change. Argent semy-de-lys azure, a chief embattled sable.\n\nNice armory!\n\nHer former device, Per pale embattled argent, seme-de-lys sable, and azure, seme-de-lys argent, is released.\n\nKolosvari Arpadne Julia. Name and device. Azure, three roses one and two argent barbed and seeded gules slipped and leaved issuant from the center mount of a trimount vert.\n\nThe construction for a married Hungarian woman's name in late period is documented from Attila Szabó's \"Ardélyi Magyar Szótörténeti Tár\". This work gives an example dated 1584 (p. 268, s.n. álom) of 'Eotweos Peterne Anna', which means \"Anna, wife of Peter Eotweos\". The name is constructed as {husband's byname} {husband's given name + ne} {wife's given name}. Such constructions, with a compound byname indicating the name of the woman's husband, are therefore sufficiently attested in late period Hungary for registration.\n\nThe submitter includes a letter from Kolosvari Arpad granting her permission to express that she is his wife in this registration.\n\nThe submitter has a letter of permission to conflict from Palotzi Marta, Gules, three roses one and two argent barbed and seeded azure slipped and leaved issuant from the center mount of a trimount vert, whose submission appears elsewhere in this letter.\n\nGreat regional-style armory!\n\nKolskeggr inn rammi.

Gules, three roses one and two argent barbed and seeded azure slipped and leaved issuant from the center mount of a trimount vert.\n\nThe submitter has a letter of permission to conflict from Kolosvari Arpadne Julia, Azure, three roses one and two argent barbed and seeded gules slipped and leaved issuant from the center mount of a trimount vert, whose submission appears elsewhere in this letter.\n\nGreat regional-style armory!\n\nRónán Meablach. Name and device. Azure, a lynx rampant argent, a chief rayonny Or.\n\nRowen Cloteworthy. Name and device. Lozengy argent and sable, a chief gules.\n\nRowen is the submitter's legal given name.\n\nNice armory!\n\nSebastian Estevan de Xavier. Device. Per chevron gules and argent, two fetterlocks argent and a lymphad sable.\n\nSergio da Verona. Name.\n\nSubmitted as Sergio da Verone, the documentation showed the byname as Verona. We have changed the byname to this form to match the documentation.\n\nSmithwick, Shire of. Branch name and device. Per chevron Or and purpure, two dragonflies and a laurel wreath counterchanged.\n\nSmoking Rocks, Barony of. Order name Order of the Leviathan.\n\nSmoking Rocks, Barony of. Order name Order of the Quadrant.\n\nTobyn Kembold. Device. Or, a dragon sejant gules.\n\nThis device does not conflict with Wilhelm Rotbart aus Bayern, Or, a five-headed hydra sejant affronté gules, reblazoned on the Middle section of this letter. A visual inspection of Wilhelm's device found that his hydra is actually wingless so there is a CD for the posture of the monster and another for removing the wings. Research into the blazons of previously registered hydras shows that the SCA default for this monster is winged. Elsewhere in this letter, we have reblazoned the only two wingless hydras that were not already so specified.\n\nTomas Wormwood. Name and device. Per bend sinister argent and azure, a brown hawk stooping to sinister proper.\n\nOriginally submitted as Tomas Wormwood the given name was changed to Thomas at kingdom to match the submitted documentation. The form Tomas appears in Talan Gwynek, \"Yorkshire Masculine Names from 1379.\" Therefore, we have changed the name back to the originally submitted form.\n\nUther McDermot. Name.\n\nViolet Coleson. Name and device. Argent, on a roundel azure a mullet of six points throughout argent, a bordure azure.\n\nYsabeau de Lorigne. Name.\n\nAlzhbet de Sighisoara. Name and device. Argent, four oak leaves in saltire stems to center vert and in base an acorn proper, a bordure purpure.\n\nSubmitted as Alzhbeta of Sighisoara, the submitter requested authenticity for 14th C Walachia and wanted a name meaning \"Elizabeth of Sighisoara.\" As submitted, the name combines a Russian given name with a modern Romanian place-name. Romanian is the language we would expect in 14th C Wallachia. However, the earliest examples of written Romanian date from around the 15th C. This means that the information for forming an authentic 14th C Romanian name is simply not available. However, Nebuly lists these Romanian forms of Alzhbeta from the 15th C: Elisava, Elisafa, and Elisafta. All are from Constantinescu, Dic{t,}ionar Onomastic Romînesc. Nebuly notes that Constantinescu shows 15th C Romanian locative bynames are formed in two ways: \"...locatives may be found using \"de\" or \"de la\" as early as the 15th century in Roman alphabet documents. The other way in which a locative byname is formed is by attachment of a suffix....my best guess is the appropriate suffix in this case would be -anu.\" Unfortunately, although we know that the town Sighisoara existed in the 14th C, we do not know what form the name took in period. If she is interested in a Romanian form of this name, we suggest Elisava de Sighisoara; however, we note that this is, at best, a 15th C form, and at worst, mixes a 15th C given name with a modern byname. Correspondence with the submitter indicated that she preferred the submitted given name to any of the other forms. Therefore, we have changed the byname to the form de Sighisoara to partially comply with her request for authenticity.\n\nWe note that there are other possibilities for making this name authentic. The town Sighisoara is not located in Walichia, but is in Transylvania. In 14th C, Transylvania was under Hungarian rule, so a Hungarian name is a distinct possibility for someone from this region. Again, though, we do not have 14th C Hungarian forms, but Nebuly suggests a fully Hungarian 16th C form: \"The most likely period Hungarian form of the name is Segeswary Ersebet (Kázmér; s.n. Segesvári 1539; s.n. Gált{o''}i 1562).\" If the submitter is interested in an authentic name for the region of Sighisoara, she may be interested in this form.\n\nFinally, the town of Sighisoara was founded by German immigrants; several websites dedicated to history and tourism in this region mention that the town name is recorded as Schespurch in the late 13th C and as Schassburg in the 15th C. Talen Gwynek, \"Medieval German Given Names from Silesia\" and \"German Names from Kosice, 1300-1500\" both show the spelling Elisabeth in the late 13th and 14th C. Therefore, we would suggest Elisabeth von Schespurch as a possible 14th C German form.\n\nBrian macc Fáeláin. Device change. Per saltire sable and gules, a lion argent between three mullets of eight points Or.\n\nHis former device, Per saltire sable and gules, a tyger rampant argent between three mullets of eight points Or, is released.\n\nCaer Galen, Barony of. Badge. (Fieldless) On a cauldron azure a harp Or.\n\nCecelia Wrenne. Name and device. Argent, two arrows in saltire surmounted by a feather vert, a bordure embattled purpure.\n\nNice name!\n\nCeolwen æt Axanbrycge. Name change from Kymme Godric and device change. Per pale gules and sable, a pall ermine.\n\nHer old name, Kymme Godric, is released.\n\nHer former device, Per saltire sable and vert, an elephant and an orle Or, is retained as a badge.\n\nFriedrich Wilhelmssohn. Name and device. Quarterly sable and gules, a triskelion of wings argent.\n\nThis device does not conflict with the registered badge of the Barony of Dun Carraig, (Fieldless) Three sinister wings conjoined in pall inverted argent, reblazoned in the Atlantia section of this letter. There is a CD for fielded versus fieldless armory and another for inverting the primary group. A visual inspection showed Dun Carraig's wings to be clearly in pall while Friedrich's triskelion of wings is, by definition, in pall inverted.\n\nGerhardt Drachenmacher. Name change from holding name Gerhardt of the Outlands.\n\nThe submitter requested a name meaning \"Gerald the kite-maker\" and requested authenticity for 14th C Saxony. Nebuly makes the following observations:\n\n...the whole name looks and sounds like a High German form. Since Saxon is a Low German dialect, we'd have to make some big changes to come close to authenticity.\n\nFor example, the typical Low German form of the given name would be Geert, while Gerhardt is a typically High German form. Since making this change would radically alter the spelling and pronunciation of the given name, I expect it would be a major change, which the submitter does not allow.\n\nThe submitter should also be advised that Gerhardt is not the same name as Gerald, which derives instead from Gerwald. If he truly wants to be Gerald (as the LoI suggests), then he should consider the Low German form of that name spelled Gerolt (dated 1340 from Lübeck; Bahlow DGN, s.n.Gerold). We might be able to make this change and yet stay within the stated desires of the submitter.\n\nSo, the name is a reasonable German name, but it is not authentic for 14th C Saxony and may not have the meaning desired. However, we feel that, as the submitter has submitted this given name twice, any changes to it should be made by him.\n\nGwilim de Glamorgan. Name change from Gwillim Glamorgan.\n\nHis old name, Gwillim Glamorgan, is released.\n\nKieran Blake. Name.\n\nMarie Edeline. Device. Sable, in fess a greyhound sejant reguardant Or and another sejant contourny reguardant argent.\n\nPenelope Carlyll. Name and device. Argent, a vol and a chief sable.\n\nSavina La Brune. Name.\n\nOriginally submitted as Savina La Brune, the name was changed at kingdom to Savina Labrune to match the submitted documentation. The submitter requested authenticity for late 14th/early 15th C French. Aryanhwy merch Catmael, \"French Surnames from Paris, 1421, 1423 & 1438,\" shows all descriptive and occupational bynames containing the articles \"la\" or \"le\" with the article as a separate element. The same is true of Colm Dubh, \"An Index to the Paris Census of 1292.\" Therefore, we have changed the name back to Savina La Brune as this appears to be appropriate for her desired period.\n\nVíðarr leðrháls. Name.\n\nListed on the LoI as Viðarr leðrhals, the forms show Víðarr leðrháls. As the documentation also shows the accents we have registered the name as it appears on the forms.\n\nVioletta Bellafiori. Device. Paly argent and purpure, a pegasus passant Or.\n\nYmanya Murray. Name change from Amanda Murray (see PENDS for badge).\n\nAndrew Cameron. Device. Per pale wavy argent and azure, a bear and a dog combattant counterchanged.\n\nThis device must be returned for redrawing. The wavy line of division has too many overly small waves, making it difficult to identify at any distance.\n\nGina Dragoni. Device. Or, atop a spectacled spagenhelm a dragon passant purpure.\n\nThe documentation provided for the primary charge does not show this helm with the cheek pieces or solid aventail as it is drawn here. The only other SCA registration of this type of helm, Helm Egilsson of Birka, Vert, a spectacled spagen helm affronty Or, on a chief argent a dragonfly volant inverted azure, winged sable, also has no cheek pieces or aventail. While Orle has provided evidence that the cheek pieces may be period for this type of helm, all documentation found shows a chain mail, rather than a solid, aventail. The submitter will need to either provide documentation for this depiction of the helm or redraw it to match her current documentation.\n\nNikolai Domingo de Vallejo. Badge. (Fieldless) A wolf's head erased contourny argent.\n\nThis badge conflicts with Fáelán MacFergus, Per bend sinister wavy sable and checky Or and gules, in canton a wolf's head erased contourny argent. There is a CD for fielded versus fieldless armory but nothing for the position of the wolf's head on the field versus a fieldless badge.\n\nOffangaard, Canton of. Branch name.\n\nThis name has several problems. First, the name is not formed using a documented Old Norse pattern for placenames. The summarization claims that ofan means \"southward\" or \"from above.\" However, both \"southward\" and \"from above\" are adverbs, and no documentation was submitted and none found showing that Old Norse placenames were formed using the pattern \"adverb+place.\" Barring such documentation, Old Norse patterns constructed using this pattern are not registerable.\n\nFurthermore, the documentation shows the protheme as ofan, not offan and the deuterotheme as gadr or gaðr instead of gaard. No explanation was provided for why the documentation supported the submitted spellings.\n\nIf the submitters are interested in a name meaning \"Southern Fortress\", then Suðrgarð would be the correct Old Norse form. The Old Norse word suðr; appears in a few placenames in The Landnamabok:Suðreyjar (\"the south island,\" the Hebridies). Suðrlönd (\"Sutherland\" in Scotland). Another placename uses a syðr, a comparative form of suðr meaning \"southernmost\": Syðradal, \"the southernmost dale\". Syðragarð would given the meaning \"the southernmost fortress\". Unfortunately both of these forms is an aural conflict with the registered group name Southron Gaard. However, because they are different in appearance, either form should be registerable with a letter of permission to conflict from Southron Gaard.\n\nA warning about using the Northvegr website (www.northvegr.org). This site is not consistent in its use of accents or other international characters. In particular, the edh (ð) is usually transcribed as a \"d\" on this site, and no transcription convention is used to differentiate it from a true \"d\". Thus forms found on this site may not accurately reflect documentary Old Norse spellings.\n\nRising Waters, Barony of. Award name Fiona's Pearl.\n\nThis name does not follow period Order name patterns. The precedent against Order names using the pattern \"secular name+object\" was last confirmed in July 2004:\n\nThe question raised here is whether an order name using the secular name+object pattern is consistent with period naming practices for Order names. To determine this requires an examination of known Order names and the practice of Order naming within the Society.\n\nIs there evidence that names of regular people were used to form Order names in period? Neither the submitter nor the College have provided any. The earliest Order named for a secular person we were able to find evidence for was the Order of Maria Therese founded in 1758, well outside our period. Meradudd Cethin, \"Project Ordensnamen\" has one possible counterexample, Order of Godefroy. However, this seems to be a misinterpretation of the source, Great European Orders, http://www.chivalricorders.org/vatican/holysep.htm, which says of the Order of the Holy Sepulcher, \"Several historians of the Order have attributed the actual foundation of the Order to Godefroy, Duke of Bouillon, first Christian King of Jerusalem, after the liberation of Jerusalem in 1099.\"\n\nIs there evidence that Saint's names appeared in Order names or in common usage or Order names without the word Saint? There are no examples in the \"Project Ordensnamen\" collection showing a Saint's name without the identifying title.\n\nSo, the formation is not found in period, but does it follow a period pattern? That depends on how you interpret the available examples. Take, for example, The Order of Saint James of the Shell. On one level the pattern for this order name is holy-name + object. On this level, the jump to non-holy-name + object seems to be only a single step. However, there is an alternative and somewhat more descriptive interpretation: Saint or Object of Religious Veneration; the formation holy-name + object then becomes an interpretation of the structure of the saint's or relics signifier, not an intpretation of the structure of the Order name itself. Under this interpretation, the formation secular name+ object bears far less similarity to a period order name formation.\n\nBecause Order names of the form secular name + object are not found in period and do not follow period models, they are not registerable.\n\nEven if the construction \"secular name+object\" were valid for Order names, this Order name would still be two steps from period practice. If this construction was registerable, it would still be at least one step from period practice because it is an unattested formation. In addition, Fiona is an SCA-compatible name, and its use in a name is also one step from period practice.\n\nRising Waters, Barony of. Award name Fiona's Pebble.\n\nThis name does not follow period Order name patterns. The precedent against Order names using the pattern \"secular name+object\" was last confirmed in July 2004:\n\nThe question raised here is whether an order name using the secular name+object pattern is consistent with period naming practices for Order names.

Name.\n\nThis name is presumptuous of the head of the clan MacLeod of Harris; McGloid is a form of the name MacLeod.\n\nDag Alreksson. Name.\n\nAural conflict with Dag Eriksson, registered June 1994. The only difference in pronunciation is the coloring that the l sound adds to the initial vowel.\n\nHis armory has been registered under the holding name Dag of the Bridge.\n\nEinar Ulfson. Device. Sable, a schnecke issuant from sinister chief Or.\n\nAs the East Kingdom originally indicated to the submitter, this device conflicts with Damian Thorvaldsson, Sable, a gurges Or. Precedent says, \"There is clearly a CD between a schnecke and a gurges, but the consensus of the commentary and those attending the meeting that RfS X.2. does not apply between them\" (Peter Schneck, 5/96 p. 20). Therefore, there is only one CD between the two devices.\n\nGareth Grey de Wilton. Device. Argent, on a bend sinister cotised vert three Latin crosses palewise argent, a bordure counterchanged.\n\nThis device must be returned for non-period style. Precedent does allow counterchanging a bordure over an ordinary: \"Given that we allow other peripherals to be counterchanged across an ordinary, we see no reason to disallow it here [a bordure counterchanged over a pile]. However, this practice is not good style and therefore counts as a weirdness\" (Elsbeth Anne Roth, LoAR July 2001, p. 2). In this case, however, the bordure is also counterchanged over the cotises, which have been consistently defined by precedent as secondaries, rather than as ordinaries, thus taking the device a second step away from period practice.\n\nJehanne Urchurdan. Household name Sea Dragon Keep.\n\nThis names does not follow a documented pattern for castle names in English. A search through Mills, A Dictionary of British Place-names, shows several patterns including Castle+[given] (Castellum Bernardi 1200, [Title or familyname]'s+castle (Bisshopescastel 1282), castle+[topographic feature](Castell Morton 1346, castle by the marshy farmstead), or from local towns/districts (Castel of Windesore, 1446). None were found formed from names of heraldic charges. Barring such documentation, names following the pattern [heraldic charge} +castle or keep are not registerable. We note that Sea Dragon Inn would follow documented inn-name patterns. We would make this change, but the submitter will not accept changes.\n\nSmoking Rocks, Barony of. Order name Order of the Lodestone.\n\nThis does not follow the pattern of period Order names. In January, 2005, Laurel said:\n\nWhile Meradudd Cethin, \"Project Ordensnamen\", presents \"thing\" as a category from which Orders are named, an examination of these \"things\" reveal that they fall into one of two categories. The first, which we are not concerned with here, is \"Relic\" or \"object of religious veneration\", for example The Order of Saint George's Shield or The Order of the Dannebrog fall into this category. The other is \"heraldic charge.\" An examination of the Orders with \"thing\" names in Neville, Early Orders of Knighthood and Chivalry reveal that the name of the Order is directly reflected as a heraldic charge in that Order's regalia.\n\nSo, if a balefire is a reasonable heraldic charge, then Order of the Balefire is registerable; if not, not. No evidence has been found that a charge known as a balefire was known and used in period or in modern heraldry. Furthermore, RFS VII.3. Period Artifacts. says, \"Artifacts that were known in the period and domain of the Society may be registered in armory, provided they are depicted in their period forms.\" From the definition provided of a balefire, it is unclear what could make this charge uniquely identifiable as a heraldic charge distinct from a fire or flame.\n\nIdentical logic applies in this case. There is no evidence that a lodestone can be depicted as a unique heraldic charge. Barring such evidence, lodestone cannot be used in an Order name formed using the pattern \"thing\" or \"heraldic charge\".\n\nSmoking Rocks, Barony of. Order name Companions of the Rock.\n\nBy precedent, the word Companion may not be used as a designator in an Order name:\n\nSubmitted as Companions of the Seraph, the designator Companions does not clearly indicate that an entity is an order. As the last registration of Companions as a designator was in 1981, Companions is not SCA-compatible as a designator. We have changed the designator to Order in order to register this name. [Angels, Barony of the for Companions of the Seraph, August 2003].\n\nWe note that Order of the Companions of the Rock is registerable. However, adding a new designator or changing the designator is a major change which the submitters will not allow."
