        "text": "Gerhard \"Gary\" Amirault, 71, of Hermann, MO, passed away Saturday, November 3, 2018 at his home.\n\nGary was born in Nurnburg, Germany on October 2, 1947, a son of the late Fred & Ruth (Scholz) Amirault.\n\nHe was the widower of Ann Michelle (Aaron) Amirault. They were united in marriage on June 11, 1972, in Pikesville, Maryland. Michelle preceded him on July 31, 2018.\n\nGary was an amazing husband and father and shown God’s unconditional love in his daily interactions and life of service. He faithfully cared for his wife though her dying days. Gary loved spreading the gospel of his Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ. It was his greatest desire for people to know that Jesus loves ALL mankind, no exceptions. He did relentless research to show that He was a God of love and disprove the teachings of hell as a place of eternal punishment. Gary enjoyed heart to heart talks with his daughter and debating her about topics such as saving pit bulls. He enjoyed meeting strangers and found great joy in helping others. He enjoyed researching, writing, and creatively thinking outside the box. Gary has left a lasting legacy of love on the many lives he has touched.”\n\nGary is survived by a daughter, Elena Joy Polson & husband Scott, of Wildwood, Missouri; two sisters, Janet Amirault, of California; and Nancy Clifford, of Maryland, and a brother, Paul Amirault, of Maryland. Gary is preceded in death by his parents, his wife, and a son, Scott Amirault.\n\nA memorial service will be held Friday, November 9th at 10:00 a.m. at Toedtmann & Grosse Funeral Home. Memorial donations may be given to families choice. C/O Toedtmann & Grosse Funeral Home."
