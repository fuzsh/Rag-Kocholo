        "text": "I trust by your choices you mean the subject line literally, I.e. singers\n\nof German lieder. Certainly there are a raft of great singers of art songs\n\n(Tourel, Simoneau, Schipa, Valletti, Dolukhanova, Pears, Lisitsian, de los\n\nAngeles, Bernac, Souzay, Gramm, Curtin, de Gaetani, etc.) who are\n\nprincipally associated with another repertory, though some of them\n\nprogrammed some lieder with great success as well.\n\nWhat about Elly Ameling? Aksel Schiotz? Arleen Auger? And I heard a Schreier\n\nBeethoven/Schumann recital in San Jose CA (!) that remains among my greatest\n\nof all concert experiences.\n\nThree of the most influential touring recitalists in the early part of the\n\ncentury were Marcella Sembrich (one of the first opera singers to do what we\n\nwould call \"serious\" lieder programs), David Bispham and Julia Culp. To my\n\nmind they deserve higher honors than that archfraud Elena Gerhardt, though\n\nher disastrous influence is undeniable. To me she is a self-mythologizing\n\nHigh Priestess figure on the order of Wanda Landowska and Nina Koshetz, and\n\nwhile I get some pleasure from certain of their records, I get none at all\n\nfrom Gerhardt's, and wonder if anyone else would had they not been told by\n\ngenerations of Walter Legges that she was A (The?) Great Lieder Singer.\n\nNice to think about this repertory, which I love.\n\nDavid Shengold\n\n----------\n\nIn article <FEM5w...@oswego.Oswego.EDU>, sg...@news.oswego.edu (Celia A.\n\nî—“\n\n> Add Janet Baker. Victoria De Los Angeles.....\n\nWell here we get into the usual apples/oranges discussion of whether one is\n\nmoved by one singer over another. I think Janet Baker is one of the great\n\nartists of all time. Her Gluck, Monteverdi, Mahler and Elgar are just\n\nsublime. I just have never felt that she is at her best in recital\n\nrepertoire with piano... I always get the feeling of an opera/concert singer\n\ntaking a day off by doing some lieder and chansons..... I just don't put her\n\nin the same class as Lehmann or Dieskau or Hotter in terms of the total\n\ninvestment in the poetry and the stylistic \"rightness\" for lieder. I also\n\nfind her French chanson singing mannered.... very musical and every note in\n\nplace, but just not \"right\" somehow... And again, I adore her... I just think\n\nshe's untouchable in early music and English song and not in the same leagues\n\nas the ones mentioned.\n\nde los Angeles in Spanish song is perfectly charming. Her lieder and chanson\n\nwork has always been marred by her imperfect technique and her poor ear for\n\nGerman, IMHO. I winced when I heard her sing a lieder recital in Vienna, and\n\nshe only JUST redeemed herself by singing Falla, Turina and Granados at the\n\nend.\n\nWhen Lehmann sings, you can literally visualize the story she's telling, with\n\nDieskau, one gets exquisite musicianship and virtually flawless technique,\n\nand Hotter... well you get Hotter.... not the best voice or technique, but it\n\nall falls together somehow.... especially in music with tragic or nostalgic\n\nthemes, he's well nigh unbeatable.\n\nOne could argue that they couldn't hold their own in Spanish against de los\n\nAngeles or against Baker in Elijah, and I would concede the point. But if\n\nwe're strictly talking about German lieder, I don't think either artist is in\n\nthe top 20, though they are admirable in many ways... there's just too much\n\ncompetition!\n\n>To your list, which I think is absolutely correct, I would add Peter\n\n>Schreier. His Liederabends in Europe were a hot ticket for years, especially\n\n>when he sang Schumann or Schubert.\n\nGuten Tag!\n\nWELL, of course you are right, but as you know there always music lovers who\n\ndon`t like some singers for different reasons. I have to confess that Schreier\n\nwas/is a singer who(m?) I`m always found boaring, really boaring always.Maybe\n\nto the backgound of finding him soooooooo boaring belongs his very naive way of\n\nsinging the Lieder of Schumann and Schubert like many adults did it to/for\n\ntheir children with German Volkslieder after WW II. I am part of that second\n\ngenaration after the war who never trust that \"naivity\" of my parents\n\ngeneration any more.(and Schreier) Another singer (who was the most popular\n\nLieder singer in Germany, much more popular then DFD, was Hermann Prey). I am\n\nnot the only one who had problems with his way of singing too, because his\n\npriority was emotion in singing Lieder. Like \"naivity\" this seemed to me too\n\n\"onesided\". (for my taste too \"schmaltzy\". Dieskau was the RIGHT one, he was\n\nable to differenciate in many ways BUT \"he couldn`t stop singing. His later\n\n\"Winterreise\" with Barenboim and Murray Perrahia\" were too late. After he left,\n\nthere are suddenly a whole dozen of wonderfull German Lieder singer.\n\n>>\n\n>> Given all the interest in end-of-the-century list-making, I propose a list\n\n>> of the great Lieder singers of the 20th century, by which I mean those who\n\n>> had the greatest impact on the art form, whether I happen to enjoy\n\n>> listening to them or not.

Baker, Ludwig and\n\nGerard Souzay following behind them only a liitle bit.\n\n\"Liebeslieder Walzer\" by Brahms from the Edinghburgh Festival with\n\nFerrier/Patzak and Bruno Walter at (on?) the piano is the very best I ever\n\nheard. I have to mention two tenors from England and Denmark whose\n\n\"Dichterliebe\" are the very BEST, Axel Schiotz and Peter Pears. Especially\n\nSchiotz has to be in my TOP TEN .\n\nLast not least I would like to mention Mathias Goerne of the younger Generation\n\nbecause I was impressed by his Winterreise more then by Dieskaus, Prey`s\n\nWunderlich`s and Pear`s\n\n(heard them all LIVE with \"Winterreise\")\n\nLast not least I wanne suggest to hear Henry Plunket Green with \"Leiermann\"\n\nfrom 1937, at the age of 69. It`s greatt irony that an older\n\nirish singer sang the most touching\n\n\"Hurdy-gurdy man\" in English (EMI 5661502\n\n(2 CD Lieder on Record 1898-1952, SCHUBERT, vol I )\n\nBest.................wolf(j)\n\nCelia A.

Sgroi\n\nHistorically I think it should begin with two great pioniers: the Polish\n\nsoprano Marcella Sembrich (1858-1935) and the Dutch baritone Johan\n\nMesschaert (1857-1922)\n\nSembrich was probably the first famous opera singer who gave Lieder\n\nrecitals everywhere. Sometimes she acompanied herself on the piano. She left\n\na few Lieder recordings.\n\nMesschaert didn't make recordings (as far as I know), but there are\n\nseveral reports about his performances and DFD considered him as his great\n\npredecessor. About ten years ago I made a study of the musical life in\n\nAmsterdam in the 1880's and 1890's and read a lot of reviews of Messchaert's\n\nrecitals, which gave a good idea about how revolutionary Liederrecitals were\n\nat that time (\"Messchaert amazed the audience singing all the twenty songs\n\nof Schubert's Die Schoene Muellerin...\" \"It were especially `Morgengruss',\n\n`Mein' and `Der Jaeger' which received much applause...\", etc.\n\nAnother famous Dutch Lieder in the first quarter of the century was Julia\n\nCulp (1880-1970). She made a large number of aucoustical and some electrical\n\nrecordings (Frauenliebe und -lebe, alas). Purely vocally she was a better\n\nsinger than Gerhardt, and paid more attention to te music and less to the\n\nwords than her contemporary.\n\nOther singers who might be included as having rather much impact on the\n\nhistory of Lieder singing are Gerard Souzay, Peter Schreier and perhaps\n\nBrigitte Fassbaender. It's difficult to make a choice from the new\n\ngenerations: there are very good Lieder singers (Baer, Quasthoff, Goerne,\n\nHolzmaier, etc.,etc.) but I don't think any of them is meeting the standards\n\nto be included on the list.\n\nBenjo Maso"
