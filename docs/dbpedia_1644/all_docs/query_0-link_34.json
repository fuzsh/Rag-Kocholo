Nichols Endowment for International Study Fund is to encourage and support international study and mission experiences for students, with an emphasis on first-time travelers. However, it is understood that such student experiences require advance preparations and travel by faculty and staff who mentor and lead the students during their travels; support of those faculty preparations is a worthy use of the endowment. The priorities of student, faculty, and staff needs will change regularly, as will the priorities of the variety of trips, from short-term class trips to semester long individual study, for example. Priority will be given to academic ventures over mission trips of service, but both experiences are worthy of support from the endowment as the University leadership judges from time to time.\n\nwas established in 1998 by the Three B Partners, a partnership of the Ray Bible family which includes Ray and Barbara Bible, Gean Ann Bible Sing, Katherine Bible Moore and Samuel Edward Bible.
