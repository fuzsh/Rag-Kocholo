        "text": "Inside the court: CNN reporter describes her experience in the press pen\n\nWhile dozens of journalists are inside the courtroom at the Supreme Court, not one laptop or cellphone is.\n\nEven the smallest sounds can be heard, like someone jingling keys — or papers shuffling, as I discovered, as my case preview pamphlet slid to the floor.\n\nAn area for the press exists to the left of the bench, and good views are not guaranteed. Rows F and G are partially obstructed by large marble columns draped in red curtains with gold trim. The spaces between the columns are open, and depending on your vantage point, slices of the courtroom are visible.\n\nFrom where I was sitting in seat G-1, I had a nearly perpendicular view of the justices, in sight of Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nWhile Chief Justice John Roberts, Justices Samuel Alito, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson were a little harder to see. Sitting up tall in my seat or moving only my head slightly to the left helped to determine who had the floor, as well as their recognizable voices.\n\nYou cannot switch seats, move your seat or lean your body over for a better glimpse, which I learned quickly.\n\nPress may exit the courtroom during arguments, but once you leave, you cannot return. Several reporters, however, left before the case was submitted — at least one person after Trump attorney Jonathan Mitchell’s time at the lectern and more after Jason Murray’s turn.\n\nWhile silence is requested in the high court, there were moments of levity, where the justices made a comment that evoked laughter. One example was during an exchange between Mitchell and Kagan.\n\nMitchell acknowledged to one of her points, “There certainly is some tension and some commentators have pointed this out. Professor Baude and Professor Paulsen criticized Griffin’s case very sharply…”\n\nKagan kindly interrupted, “Then I must be right,” as people laughed.\n\nAnother moment of laughter surrounded the order of specific questions. Kagan jumped in as Jackson pivoted to another point about the officer/office debate: “Could we — is that OK if we do this and then do that? Will there be an opportunity to do officer stuff or should we–?”\n\n“Absolutely. Absolutely,” Roberts said, diffusing the confusion, as people laughed.\n\nHere are key takeaways from the Supreme Court oral arguments on the Trump 14th Amendment case\n\nThe Supreme Court signaled Thursday it is poised to back former President Donald Trump and fend off a blockbuster challenge to his eligibility to appear on Colorado’s ballot.\n\nHere are key takeaways from Thursday’s oral arguments:\n\nConservatives suggest several ways to side with Trump: Throughout the course of the arguments, the court’s conservatives repeatedly questioned whether the insurrection ban was intended to apply to former presidents and whether the ban could be enforced without Congress first enacting a law. Others delved into more fundamental questions about whether courts removing a candidate from the ballot is democratic.\n\n“Your position has the effect of disenfranchising voters to a significant degree,” conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh said in one of the more striking exchanges with attorneys.\n\nIf Trump is removed from the ballot in Colorado, Chief Justice John Roberts predicted that states would eventually attempt to knock other candidates off the ballot. That, he signaled, would be inconsistent with the purpose and history of the 14th Amendment. “It’ll come down to just a handful of states that are going to decide the presidential election,” Roberts said. “That’s a pretty daunting consequence.”\n\nJackson and liberals have tough questions for challengers: Another sign that the court was leaning toward Trump’s position: Even some of the liberal justices posed difficult questions to the lawyers representing his challengers.\n\nNotably, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, a Joe Biden nominee, said that the 14th Amendment provision did not include the word “president,” even though it specifically listed other officials who would be covered, such as members of Congress. That is a central argument Trump’s attorneys have raised in the case. “I guess that just makes me worry that maybe they weren’t focused on the president,” Jackson said.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan questioned the implications of a single state banning a candidate in a presidential election. “Why should a single state have the ability to make this determination not only for their own citizens, but for the rest of the nation?” Kagan asked.\n\nJustices didn’t focus on Trump’s January 6 actions: The nine justices spent little time on the former president’s actions surrounding the January 6 attack on the US Capitol that sparked the ballot challenge in Colorado and elsewhere. There were more questions, in fact, about the Civil War and how the insurrectionist ban in the 14th Amendment of the Constitution was enacted in order to grapple with confederates who fought against the Union.\n\nNext steps: The court often takes a few months to craft opinions – and usually hands down its biggest cases at the end of its term in June. But because the court expedited the earlier stages of the Trump ballot case, it is likely the court will want to move quickly to decide the case, potentially within a matter of weeks.\n\nSee sketches from today's Supreme Court oral arguments on Trump's ballot case\n\nBill Hennessy, CNN’s regular sketch artist for the Supreme Court, captured scenes of today’s oral arguments on Donald Trump’s ballot eligibility case as it unfolded.\n\nTrump’s attorney, Jonathan Mitchell, kicked off the arguments with a brief opening statement and then fielded a barrage of questions from the nine justices. Jason Murray, representing the Colorado voters who challenged Trump, presented next. Finally, Shannon Stevenson, Colorado’s top appellate attorney, spoke on behalf of Secretary of State Jena Griswold. At the end of the arguments, Mitchell then returned for a short rebuttal.\n\nNorma Anderson, the Colorado Republican leading the lawsuit seeking to disqualify Trump from office, attended the arguments. Trump was not in the room and slammed the case against him in remarks from Florida.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court shares live audio from proceedings, cameras are not allowed inside the room. Here’s a look at some of the scenes Hennessy captured in his sketches:\n\nJustice Kagan: It is important for the Supreme Court to avoid appearance of politics\n\nJustice Elena Kagan told an audience in Washington, DC, on Thursday that it is critically important for the Supreme Court to provide stability and avoid “flip flops” in the law to steer clear of the appearance of politics.\n\n“And I think that that’s especially important for this Supreme Court at this time,” Kagan said.\n\nKagan spoke at the Library of Congress hours after the Supreme Court heard arguments in the challenge to former President Donald Trump’s eligibility to appear on Colorado’s ballot, though she was not speaking about that case specifically. Kagan has made similar arguments in the past, particularly after the court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.\n\nKagan was interviewed by Jeffrey Sutton, chief judge of the Cincinnati-based 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals. Kagan studiously avoided discussing the arguments that took place earlier Thursday, though she and Sutton briefly joked about the timing of the event later in the day.\n\n“So another slow day in the office?” Sutton quipped.\n\nLead plaintiff in Colorado ballot case: Republicans \"better sit down and read their Constitution\"\n\nFollowing Thursday’s Supreme Court oral arguments, Norma Anderson has a plain message to the Republican Party of which Donald Trump is the overwhelming 2024 frontrunner.\n\nAnderson, 91, the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit seeking to remove Trump from the ballot based on his role in the January 6, 2021, riot, said protecting democracy starts by electing the right people.\n\n“I remember World War II, and I remember everyone in the United States pulled together to protect our democracy. We’re not doing that now. Democracy is precious. It doesn’t last, unless you take care of it,” Anderson said. “Taking care of it is electing correct people. Not people that want to throw out an election. That’s what other countries do. That’s not what we do.”\n\nBeing thrust into the spotlight in recent months, Anderson — a former Republican lawmaker in Colorado who has already broken barriers — said what compelled her to be part of this case is to protect the freedoms of the United States, especially as a grandmother.\n\n“I’ve lived in a free country, and I visited countries that are not free. And I don’t want to be like them, Anderson said.\n\n“I want to keep our democracy and our freedom. It’s very important to me … I’ve got 14 grandchildren, two great grandchildren,” she added. “Pardon me, I want them to have a good country to live in.”\n\nThursday's courtroom atmosphere was \"much more tepid\" in comparison to Bush v. Gore, CNN analyst says\n\nThe atmosphere in the Supreme Court on Thursday was “much more tepid” when compared to the oral arguments held for Bush v. Gore in 2000, according to CNN senior Supreme Court analyst Joan Biskupic, who was in the courtroom for hearings during both cases.\n\nShe noted that the justices today did not talk to each other as they commonly do during oral arguments.\n\n“In this case, you could feel that like they didn’t have to make the case to each other,” she said. “There were enough of them who came into this argument ready to reject the Colorado voters’ position, so the tension was just much lower.”\n\nDuring the Bush v. Gore hearing, Biskupic said “there was a lot more tension among the justices, a lot of interrupting, a lot of rapid fire questions.”\n\nClarence Thomas asks whether Congress needs to take action before states can enforce the insurrection ban\n\nSupreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas opened Thursday’s hearing by asking Donald Trump’s lawyers whether Congress needs to take action before states can enforce the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist ban,” a relic of the Civil War that hasn’t been touched in more than a century until the Trump-fueled attack on the US Capitol.\n\nThis is an important part of the case: If the high court determines that congressional action is necessary, then that means the Colorado decision removing Trump from the ballot would need to be overturned.\n\nTrump lawyer Jonathan Mitchell responded that the Colorado decision was improper because, among other reasons, the state disqualified Trump before Congress explicitly gave it the power to do that.\n\nCourt cases against Trump demonstrate he was \"afforded due process,\" Colorado secretary of state says\n\nAhead of today’s arguments before the Supreme Court, Colorado’s Secretary of State dismissed the claims that former President Donald Trump was not afforded due process.\n\n“He has faced trial. He had a five-day hearing in Colorado at the District Court, and then he also appeared before the Colorado Supreme Court. Both of the courts determined that he did engage in insurrection,” said Jena Griswold, a Democrat and Trump critic, told CNN shortly before today’s arguments began.\n\nWhile Trump had raised this objection of due process in the media, he did not do so in any court filings, Griswold noted.\n\nRemember: Throughout the case, Griswold adopted a more neutral tone. She said she believed Trump “incited the insurrection,” but would defer to the courts on how to apply the post-Civil War amendment. Her office did not take a position on Trump’s eligibility during the Denver-based trial last year or while the Colorado Supreme Court reviewed the case. She has defended the procedures that led Colorado courts to disqualify Trump.\n\nGriswold on Thursday noted that she did not make the court ruling in Colorado, and that the court case was brought by Republican and “unaffiliated voters who did not want a disqualified candidate and the ballot.”\n\nWhy the \"officer of the United States\" question is so important\n\nDonald Trump’s attorney Jonathan Mitchell began by going to the question of who is an “officer of the United States.”\n\n“‘Officer of the United States’ refers only to appointed officials,” Mitchell said in his opening remarks.\n\nOn the surface, this case is about whether former President Donald Trump disqualified himself from another term because of his actions on January 6, 2021. But the justices are also looking at a number of threshold questions that are more technical yet that could decide the dispute.\n\nOne of them is whether Trump was an “officer of the United States” when he served as president.\n\nThe 14th Amendment bars several types of former government officials, including an “officer of the United States,” from taking an oath to “support” the Constitution and then engaging in an insurrection from serving as president.\n\nTrump argues that when the amendment’s framers wrote “officer,” they meant lower federal officials appointed by the president – not the president himself. His opponents say that a plain reading of the word “officer” should easily include the presidency.\n\nTrump attorney Jonathan Mitchell is a well-known conservative legal advocate\n\nJonathan Mitchell, representing former President Donald Trump, is speaking now. He is a well-known conservative advocate with some experience at the court – yet none in a case close to this magnitude.\n\nMitchell joined the case on behalf of Trump around the time arguments were underway at the Colorado Supreme Court. Mitchell, however, is a strategic conservative thinker in sync with the right-wing of this bench.\n\nMitchell has been attracted to ideologically and politically charged cases, serving as solicitor general of Texas for five years and teaching at various law schools before establishing his own one-person firm in 2018.\n\nHe previously argued five cases at the high court, including in 2021 to support a Texas abortion ban that was a precursor to overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nRead more about Mitchell’s career.\n\nNOW: The Supreme Court oral arguments have begun\n\nThe Supreme Court has set aside 80 minutes for arguments in today’s historic dispute over whether former President Donald Trump disqualified himself from the ballot for his role in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nIn reality, the debate will carry on for much longer. Here’s a look at the order of speakers:\n\nTrump’s attorney, Jonathan Mitchell, is set to to kick off the arguments a little with a brief opening statement and will then field a barrage of questions from the bench.\n\nJason Murray, representing the Colorado voters who challenged Trump, will present next.\n\nFinally, Shannon Stevenson, Colorado’s top appellate attorney, will speak on behalf of Secretary of State Jena Griswold.\n\nEach attorney will first take questions from the justices in something of a free-for-all format. Then, Chief Justice John Roberts will permit each justice to ask a few questions in order of seniority.\n\nAt the end of the arguments, Mitchell will return to the well of the courtroom for a short rebuttal.\n\nHere's the scene outside the Supreme Court before arguments begin\n\nBike rack fences line the perimeter of the Supreme Court, dotted with small signs: “Area closed by order of the Supreme Court Marshal.”\n\nFacing the court steps, there is a second row of bike rack fencing, where the scene is fairly calm Thursday morning.\n\nA handful of Supreme Court police are beyond the fencing and let certain people through a section at the center, such as members of the press and bar association.\n\nAt one point, a man was shouting profanities in the direction of people holding signs outside the court.\n\nJennifer Hobbs of New York is one of these people. She wore a “Trump is a Traitor” sweatshirt and held a sign that said, “Are these hollow halls of justice?”\n\n“We want to see the Constitution upheld. This man violated his oath. Seems pretty straightforward,” she told CNN. “Think this one should be pretty simple.”\n\nJason Miller, senior adviser to President Trump, who is part of his campaign, was out front briefly taking a couple of photos of the area with his cell phone. He said he would be inside the court today.\n\nBiden \"fine\" with Trump staying on ballot, but team unlikely to weigh in on SCOTUS\n\nThe Biden team – from the White House to the campaign – is expected to stick to their stay quiet strategy relating to former President Donald Trump’s legal cases today.\n\nJust last week, President Joe Biden indicated he’s “fine” with Trump remaining on the ballot in November.\n\n“As far as I’m concerned, that’s fine,” Biden told reporters last Tuesday when asked whether Trump should be on the ballot.\n\nIn December, Biden said he believes Trump supported an insurrection but indicated it is up to the courts to determine whether that should disqualify him from running for president.\n\nThe president has repeatedly argued Trump poses a direct threat to democracy, including sharp criticism of his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection, but Biden has largely refrained from using the twists and turns of the legal cases against Trump as part of his arguments, in part, to avoid any appearance of political interference.\n\nInstead the campaign’s focus today is charging ahead with plans to take on Trump in a general election contest in November. Biden this week has leaned into framing the 2024 race as a referendum on Trump, painting him as an “existential threat” and using the Republican dysfunction on Capitol Hill as evidence of the party’s strict adherence to Trump’s will. Biden is also dispatching senior campaign officials to discuss their campaign’s strategy with House Democrats today.\n\nThe president will be traveling to Leesburg, Virginia, this afternoon where he will speak at the House Democratic Caucus Issues Conference.\n\nTrump says Supreme Court needs to make a \"powerful decision\" as it prepares to hear ballot eligibility case\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Thursday argued the US Supreme Court needed to make a “powerful decision” as the high court is set to hear a case over the Colorado Supreme Court’s decision to remove Trump from the ballot over the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist” clause.\n\nTrump continued to argue that the case brought against him amounted to election interference and said in a radio interview on “The John Fredericks Show” that it would be “bad for our country” if the court didn’t rule in his favor.\n\nTrump argued, “Essentially, they want to take me out of the race, they want to have, you know, the Supreme Court rule or vote to take me out of the race. That would be a very terrible thing to do. It’s about the vote and it’s about our Constitution.”\n\nTrump also said if he were to be disqualified from office it would “be so bad for democracy. That would be so bad for our country. And I can’t imagine that would happen.”\n\n“It’s very inappropriate, a lot of people feel that. I mean, I read all of the legal scholars and the legal opinions, very few people go to the other side unless they truly hate me,” Trump said.\n\nIt’s about an election for Trump. For John Roberts, it may be about a legacy\n\nFor Donald Trump, the fate of a presidential campaign will hang in the balance at the Supreme Court.\n\nFor Chief Justice John Roberts, it is at least in part a legacy that will be on the line.\n\nSince joining the bench in 2005, the conservative Roberts has built a reputation for trying to steer the court clear of the partisanship that vexes the rest of Washington. But Roberts’ middle-ground, go-slow approach could face one of the greatest tests of his tenure as the former president and frontrunner for the GOP nomination keeps showing up to a Supreme Court he helped to design.\n\nRead more about the enormous test Roberts is facing.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies monitoring security concerns ahead of Supreme Court arguments\n\nLaw enforcement agencies in Washington, DC, including Supreme Court Police and the United States Capitol Police, will be monitoring any protests or security concerns that crop up around Thursday’s arguments.\n\nAgencies in DC are not currently monitoring any credible threats around the hearing before the high court, according to several law enforcement officials.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies will still be watching the situation, with one security official on Capitol Hill telling CNN they would be “coordinating with local and federal partners.”\n\nCapitol Police will have “some security posture” Thursday, according to an official familiar with the planning, and any security fencing put in place ahead of the arguments would be “minimal” and could include bike-rack fencing.\n\n“Now that he’s not coming, everyone’s a bit relieved,” one official told CNN of former President Donald Trump’s plans not to attend the arguments in person.\n\nSome liberals want Justice Thomas to recuse himself due to his wife's January 6 role\n\nConservative Justice Clarence Thomas has faced pressure to recuse himself from the Colorado ballot case from liberals who have seized on his wife’s conservative activism and efforts to reverse the 2020 election results.\n\nIn a letter sent by eight Democratic lawmakers to Thomas last month as the court was still considering whether to take up Trump’s appeal, the lawmakers Virginia “Ginni” Thomas’ role in the January 6 “Stop the Steal” rally that she attended make it “unthinkable” the justice could be impartial in deciding whether the event constituted an insurrection.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin also called for Thomas’ recusal in a social media post Wednesday.\n\n“Given questions surrounding his wife’s involvement, Justice Thomas should recuse himself so there’s no question of bias,” Durbin wrote.\n\nThomas has so far resisted the recusal calls, though he or any other justice could recuse themselves at any point. They are not required to explain themselves either way.\n\nOther ethics issues have dogged the justice over the last year, with a steady stream of stories about a GOP megadonor’s largesse to Thomas – which have mostly gone unreported on the justice’s financial disclosures – raising questions about transparency at the high court.\n\nPublic camped out for hours ahead of arguments\n\nGrace Kiple, a first-year student at Georgetown Law School, arrived at the Supreme Court a day before the historic arguments just to ensure she would have a seat inside the courtroom. That meant she had to stay overnight on the sidewalk. She came prepared with a sleeping bag and a yoga mat.\n\n“I’ve never camped before,” Kiple said, clutching a large coffee. “This case is such a big thing.”\n\nThere were a handful of protesters outside the high court early Thursday, including some who held signs declaring former President Donald Trump a “traitor.” A line for public access snaked along one side of the building. Some wore suits and ties. Others snuggled into sleeping bags and sat on camp chairs.\n\nKendra Sharrard, also a first-year Georgetown Law student, said she and Kiple had been planning to attend the arguments for a long time.\n\n2 states have removed Trump from the ballot based on the 14th Amendment and January 6 riot\n\nAdvocacy groups and critics of former President Donald Trump are trying to remove him from the 2024 presidential ballot based on the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution, which says public officials who have “engaged in insurrection” are disqualified from ever serving again.\n\nTwo states – Colorado and Maine – have determined that this ban applies to Trump, because of his attempts to overturn the 2020 election and his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection. Both states stripped him from the Republican primary ballot, though those decisions were paused on appeal. The US Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the Colorado case on Thursday.\n\nBut the attempts to block Trump from the ballot fell flat in several other key states, where lawsuits were dismissed on procedural grounds and never reached the questions about Trump’s actions on January 6. This includes Minnesota, Michigan, Oregon, Arizona, Illinois, and elsewhere.\n\nCNN is tracking the major decisions on Trump’s eligibility. See where the major anti-Trump ballot challenges stand across the United States.\n\nHere's what the 14th Amendment says — and why it is at the center of Colorado's case against Trump\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Thursday in the historic efforts to disqualify former President Donald Trump from office because of his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection. The case revolves around the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist ban,” a relic of the Civil War that hasn’t been touched in more than a century until the Trump-fueled attack on the US Capitol.\n\nWhat does the 14th Amendment say? The 14th Amendment says Americans who take an oath to uphold the Constitution but then “engaged in insurrection” are disqualified from holding future public office.\n\nHowever, the Constitution does not spell out how to enforce the ban. And there is an open legal debate over how some of the terms in the vague provision should be defined. For instance, the amendment doesn’t explain what level of political violence is tantamount to “insurrection.”\n\nThe US Supreme Court is reviewing a decision from the Colorado Supreme Court, which said in a landmark 4-3 ruling in December that the “insurrectionist ban” applies to Trump.\n\nAnalysis: Supreme Court may not emerge unscathed from its latest date with Trump\n\nFew critical US democratic institutions have escaped unsullied from a tangle with Donald Trump.\n\nNow, the US Supreme Court faces its greatest test so far from the former president.\n\nOn Thursday, the nine justices will hear a case with critical implications for the 2024 election – over the Colorado Supreme Court’s decision to remove Trump from the ballot over the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist” clause.\n\nHow Trump works the refs: Even though Trump is not expected to attend Thursday’s oral arguments at the Supreme Court, the justices know what’s coming.\n\nThe prospect of being dragged into the hyper-politicized arena of a presidential election is a nightmare enough for Chief Justice John Roberts, who has often sought to guard the high court against reputational damage from the country’s raging politics.\n\nBut an election case involving Trump, in a time of far greater partisan fury than the bitter aftermath of the 2000 election, could be an even graver matter – especially if any of the court’s rulings eventually go against Trump.\n\nHow Trump leans on judges: Any judge that delivers verdicts contradictory to Trump’s view risks becoming a target. The former president’s attack on a district judge that ruled against the Trump administration in an asylum case prompted Roberts in 2019 to try to insulate the judiciary from politics. “We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,” Roberts wrote in an extraordinary statement that did not name Trump, but clearly had him in mind. “What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.”\n\nRead more about how few critical US institutions have emerged unscathed from an encounter with Trump.\n\nYour guide to today's Supreme Court arguments — and who will be speaking before the justices\n\nThe Supreme Court has set aside 80 minutes for arguments in today’s historic dispute over whether former President Donald Trump disqualified himself from the ballot for his role in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nIn reality, the debate will carry on for much longer.\n\nTrump’s attorney, Jonathan Mitchell, is expected to kick off the arguments a little after 10 a.m. ET with a brief opening statement and will then field a barrage of questions from the bench. Jason Murray, representing the Colorado voters who challenged Trump, will present next. Finally, Shannon Stevenson, Colorado’s top appellate attorney, will speak on behalf of Secretary of State Jena Griswold.\n\nEach attorney will first take questions from the justices in something of a free-for-all format. Then, Chief Justice John Roberts will permit each justice to ask a few questions in order of seniority.\n\nAt the end of the arguments, Mitchell will return to the well of the courtroom for a short rebuttal.\n\nArguing before the Supreme Court involves an enormous amount of preparation, from nailing the intricacies of an argument to anticipating hypothetical questions from justices.\n\nMitchell arranged two moot courts to practice before the justices took their seats. Murray had planned four. Such sessions are designed to expose the weaknesses in a case, devise solutions and refine its strong points. The tougher the moot – the adage goes – the smoother the actual argument.\n\nRead more about how the arguments are expected to unfold.\n\nUS Capitol Police officers say Trump’s January 6 speech isn’t protected by the First Amendment\n\nA group of current and former US Capitol Police officers who defended the iconic building on January 6, 2021, want the court to reject Trump’s argument that his speech that day is protected by the First Amendment.\n\n“Mr. Trump’s explicit instructions to a vast crowd to assault the Capitol and disrupt the proceedings of Congress — is precisely the kind of speech that is excluded from the First Amendment’s protections,” the group of current and former officers argued in a friend-of-the-court brief.\n\nTrump’s attorneys say, among other things, that his speech that day is shielded by longstanding First Amendment precedents because he wasn’t trying to incite imminent violence.\n\nThe group of five current and three former Capitol Police officers behind the brief brought a civil lawsuit against Trump and several of his allies in 2021. The officers were at the Capitol during the riot and, according to court documents, were violently attacked by members of the mob.\n\n“Attackers breached the Capitol’s defenses, forced entry, and temporarily obstructed Congress’s electoral vote count, ” the brief said. “In the process, the attackers violently assaulted (the officers who filed the brief) and other Capitol Police officers, striking them and spraying them with toxic chemicals.”\n\nRetired conservative federal judge wants Trump disqualified from office\n\nA former conservative federal appellate judge is among those asking the Supreme Court to keep Donald Trump off the ballot, arguing the ex-president’s effort to cling to power after his 2020 election loss was “broader” than South Carolina’s secession from the US that triggered the Civil War.\n\n“Mr. Trump tried to prevent the newly-elected President Biden from governing anywhere in the United States. The South Carolina secession prevented the newly-elected President Lincoln from governing only in that State,” J. Michael Luttig, a former judge on the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals, told the justices in a friend-of-the-court brief.\n\n“In doing so, Mr. Trump disqualified himself under Section 3 (of the Constitution).”\n\nLuttig has long been one of the most high-profile conservatives to argue that Trump engaged in an insurrection following his loss in 2020 and that he should as a result be barred from holding office. He played a critical role in the heated fight over the certification of the 2020 presidential election, providing in a series of tweets legal ammunition to help then-Vice President Mike Pence defy Trump’s attempt to overturn the election.\n\nRead more."
