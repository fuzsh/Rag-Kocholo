        "text": "Expressive Tempo Modifications\n\nALTHOUGH early recordings have become the object of increasing scholarly attention, when it comes to discussing issues concerning historically informed performance practice they still represent a problematic body of evidence. Two reasons can account for this: they may challenge the beliefs and convictions we derive from text-based documentary sources (Crutchfield, 1983); we tend to dismiss them on the assumption that interpreters nurtured in the late romantic culture abused the composer's intentions and indulged in tasteless, exaggerated interpretive choices (Limansky, 2004). This article challenges these assumptions and, by analysing four recordings realized by Adelina Patti between 1905 and 1906, investigates whether and to what extent significant tempo modifications occur in the music, where special emphasis is afforded by the lyrics.\n\nEvidence from a number of sources indicates that throughout the nineteenth century soloists tended to indulge in significant changes of tempo. This habit, although accepted as normal by a considerable portion of the concert-going public, came to represent a major concern among those critics who objected to the manner in which, by taking such liberties, performers abused the score and were untrue to the composer's intention (Brown, 1999, pp. 382-383). Richard Wagner played an important role in that regard, for he pushed this tendency to such a degree as to trigger strong critical reactions among both critics and colleagues. In a review which appeared on 5 May 1855 the critic of The Musical World expressed his dislike of the manner in which Wagner invariably took all the second subjects of the symphonic works at a markedly slower pace than the first, and the extent to which crescendi and rallentandi were abused at the expense of the general balance (Zicari, 2014a, pp. 51-64). In 1897 Giuseppe Verdi commented on what he called the comic fashion which had spread among those young conductors who, under the influence of Wagner, used to change the tempo every ten bars and introduce completely new nuances into what he referred to as \"every insignificant aria or concert piece\" (Conati, 1980, pp. 284-285).\n\nNotwithstanding Verdi's critical remarks and Wagner's position, in nineteenth century operatic performances tempo modifications were generally considered appropriate when demanded by the expression of a languid or an agitated character. References to modifications over a steady beat as well as larger alterations involving entire phrases or longer sections can be found in many contemporary sources; in some cases they are suggested where changes in dynamics are called for (Toft, 2013, pp. 79-84). These changes are generally mentioned in relation to the necessity for the interpreter to express every variety of feeling and sentiment as easily as in speaking, also in the absence of a precise reference to either tempo rubato or any other tempo modification. As Domenico Crivelli put it, a singer should know \"the manner of interpreting properly the true and descriptive force of musical figures and their division by means of which the composer displays his genius in adorning poetry with melodies adapted to express every human sentiment\" (Crivelli, 1820, p. 89).\n\nDomenico Corri takes into consideration two devices involving a deviation from the regular beat: the \"tempo rubato\" and the \"quickening or retarding of time.\" \"[Tempo rubato] is a detraction of part of the time from one note, and restoring it by increasing the length of another or vice versa; so that, whilst a singer is, in some measure, singing ad libitum, the orchestra, which accompanies him, keeps the time firmly and regularly.\" The \"quickening or retarding of time,\" instead, encompasses entire phrases or longer passages \"in order to give emphasis, energy, by pathos, to particular words\". If used with moderation and discretion it represents an improvement, and not an abuse (Corri, 1810, p. 134). Both tempo rubato and larger tempo modifications remained a stable feature and a major means of expression in nineteenth-century Italian opera. In the mid-1850s tempo rubato was described by Manuel Garcia in terms consistent with those used by Corri. Garcia also calls attention to the difference between tempo rubato and the use of accelerando and rallentando. While the first requires that the accents and time of the accompaniment be strictly maintained, in the second the voice and accompaniment must proceed together. The first occurs within a single bar, the second involves longer passages (Garcia, 1857, p. 51). Garcia also clarifies that \"Time\" can be of three different characters, regular, free and mixed, and that the mixed character is demanded whenever the \"feelings expressed in a piece exhibit frequent irregularities of movement, as is often the case in tender, melancholy sentiments\" (Garcia, 1857, p. 52). Rallentando is described as a device used to express decrease of passion or as a preparation for the return of a theme or melody; instead, accelerando is used in order to add greater spirit to the general effect. Garcia suggests that a larger degree of expressive liberty both inside a measure and across a longer section finds its justification in the connection that exists between the text and the music. He returns to, and insists upon this notion when dealing with the changes a singer can make by adding ornaments to a melody, the choice of which \"must be regulated by the meaning of both words and music\" (Garcia, 1857, p. 59). For this reason, the same ornament that would sound appropriate to depict a grandioso sentiment, would be unsuitable when the expression of lighter feelings be demanded. In his Hints on Singing Garcia also remarks that \"the works of Donizetti and Bellini contain a great number of passages which, without bearing the sign of the rallentando or accelerando, yet require their use\" (Garcia, 1894, p. 62).\n\nLuigi Lablache, in his Complete Method of Singing holds that a student possessed with good taste should observe \"the time or the movement indicated by the author at the beginning of the piece, and then the words for which it is composed, and he will know at once what accent must be given to it\" (Lablache, n.d., pp. 96-98). Larghetto, Andante, and Andantino, Lablache remarks, \"should be sung in a manner either graceful, tender, or mournful, according to the epithet which commonly follows the indication of the movement, and according to the words of the piece\" (Lablache, n.d., p. 98). This understanding of the expressive content of a piece represents the basis of good taste.\n\nOnly a few years later, Francesco Lamperti lamented that the art of singing lay in a terrible state of decadence, owing to the new and overwhelming tendency to assume a more dramatic character at the expense of true melody. This change resulted in a lamentable condition, as even a strong and sonorous voice sounded monotonous and wanting in the character and dramatic accent required by the lyrics and the quality of the music (Lamperti, 1864, p. ix). Although Lamperti does not make explicit reference to tempo modifications, his Solfeggi are generously supplied with indications such as allargando, stringendo, stentando, col canto, affrettato, rallentando. These are strongly suggestive of a high degree of expressive freedom in the use of tempo, even in the absence of a text. Tempo indications similar to those used by Lamperti can be found in Rossini's Metodo Pratico di Canto Moderno, whose second part includes 12 Nuovi Vocalizzi per Mezzo-soprano o Baritono. Passages bearing indications such as animez toujour or presses may encompass many bars, be followed by a rallentando or lead to a tempo primo section (Rossini, n.d.). In his Complete Method (1894) Enrico Delle Sedie maintains that the execution of those rapid passages that go under the name of agility also require a certain degree of flexibility; the idea with which they are associated should be expressed by means of the rallentando and affrettando, applied to the same phrase (Delle Sedie, 1894, p. 103).\n\nNineteenth-century opera singers were encouraged to take interpretive decisions involving tempo modifications whenever these were instrumental to the expression of the sentiments suggested by the lyrics or demanded by the dramatic situation. A good singer was expected to possess a great dramatic talent and, in some cases, this could even compensate for the lack of adequate vocal skills; a case in point in this regard is represented by Mariella Piccolomini, who was said to excel in those qualities that were related primarily to her dramatic force, while many critics found faults with her vocal technique (Zicari, 2014b).\n\nThe picture presented thus far did not undergo major changes during the second half of the century, notwithstanding the new dramatized style initiated by Vincenzo Bellini and developed by Giuseppe Verdi (Celletti, 1974). Although in the late 1840s some critics complained bitterly about the shift from proper melody to melodic dramatization (Zicari, 2011), the change in vocal style did not necessarily imply a more rigid approach to expressive tempo. In 1834 Bellini wrote to Francesco Florimo asking him not to observe the metronome markings he had inserted in the score of I Puritani, and to quicken and retard the tempos according to the singers' voice (Cambi, 1943, p. 490). When in 1850 Ernani was revived in London, Henry Fothergill Chorley pointed out that \"Verdi's music, in its solo passages and closes, gives him [Sims Reeves] scope for that slackening of tempo and elongation of favourite notes which are considered by 'Young Italy' as the style dramatic\" (Chorley, 1850). Chorley made a similar comment when reviewing the London premiere of Rigoletto in 1853: Angiolina Bosio's style suited Verdi's music, for \"by him singers are invited, not forbidden, to slacken tempo\" (Chorley, 1853). Even though today's scholars tend to agree that Verdi preferred quicker tempos and objected to any arbitrary tempo modifications (Hepokoski, 1985), there seems to be sufficient evidence that it was only the useless modifications that Verdi was opposing, that is to say, those modifications that found no justification in either the lyrics or the dramatic situation (Freitas, 2002). When Verdi conducted his Messa in Köln in 1877 the critic August Guckeisen remarked that the composer indulged in a certain degree of rubato (Conati, 1980, p. 121). On preparing the performance of Verdi's Pezzi sacri in Turin in 1898 the young Toscanini met with the composer, who bestowed on him words of approval for having introduced an allargando that was not marked in the score. Verdi revealed to Toscanini that the reason why the allargando was not there was to avoid the exaggerated expression of that effect (Conati, 1980, p. 292). On other occasions Verdi expressed his aversion to metronomic conducting, as was the case when Toscanini conducted Falstaff in 1899 (Celletti, 1989, p. 160). Although Verdi's scattered declarations seem to add to the idea that he expected his interpreters to be faithful to his intentions, his frequently insisted upon preference for dramatic poignancy encourages a broader understanding of those declarations.\n\n\"Voi che sapete\" (1905)\n\nAs has been noted, this aria \"expresses a sense of insistent, languishing desire, with stronger emotions occasionally adding highlights\" (Abert, [1923/24] 2007, p. 951). A closer look at both its text and musical structure helps us understand how Mozart translates the lyrics and their meaning into an aria whose most distinctive character seems to be a harmonic and melodic acceleration towards the final recapitulation. The first two stanzas serve as an introduction to the topic, quasi a captatio benevolentiae addressing both the dramatis personae and the public; Cherubino interrogates Susanna and the Countess about what he feels and, in doing so, spells out the reason why he is so discomforted. The first two stanzas are in B♭ and F Major respectively and present a regular melodic contour, with symmetrical four-bar phrases qualified by a distinctive dactyl-like incipit. In the third stanza a feeling of unrest is introduced, with a sense of languishing desire assuming a prominent role; such words as desir (desire) and diletto (delight) lead to the final martir (martyrdom), for which Mozart makes recourse to a diminished seventh chord. These words, presented in quick succession, are clearly suggestive of the burst in Cherubino's chest. Now he freezes in despair, then he lights up with the fire of passion, then he freezes again (fourth stanza, A♭ Major). Cherubino tries to explain that all this originates from his striving in search of something (love) that he cannot find in himself (fifth stanza, the music moves from A♭ Major to g minor). A harmonic progression to an anacrusis figure follows (sixth and seventh stanza), which expresses the sobbing and sighing, the trembling and throbbing that qualify Cherubino's languorous unrest (again a diminished seventh chord emphasises the conclusion of the stanza). The aria recapitulates with Cherubino resuming his initial condition, with the first stanza returning together with the initial motivic material.\n\nThe analysis of the recording (NI 7841: Cat. 03051, Matrix: 537F) reveals a high degree of freedom with regard to both rhythm and tempo 3. Patti introduces many changes in the dotted figures in a way that appears to be consistent with what is suggested by Manuel Garcia (1894, p. 50). Many major tempo changes can be also noted; for instance, from the initial beat, where ♩ = 48, Patti slows down to ♩ = 32 at bar 12 and speeds up again to ca. ♩ = 60 at bar 29.\n\nThe mean value of the crotchet beat lengths (N=137) is 1.22 sec. (♩ = 48), which corresponds to the initial beat. The mode value of the beat lengths is also 1.22 sec. (♩ = 48), thus suggesting a certain consistency in the chosen tempo. A standard deviation of 0.28 gives us a measure of the internal variability. Although this measure represents a good indicator of the interpreter's moderate expressive freedom, it is the analysis at micro-structural level that provides us with some deeper insight into Patti's interpretive idea. In fact, the micro-differences are consistent with the expressive content of the text, as can be gleaned from Table 1.\n\nTable 1.

(♩ = 50.3) SD = 0.20\n\nNotwithstanding some small modifications, Patti's tempo remains stable in the first three stanzas (bars 1-28); no sooner does she approach the fourth one than she speeds up in a manner consistent with the sense of agitation suggested by the words. Patti is consistent with the lyrics also within this section, for on the words \"torno a gelar (and again I freeze)\" she slows down considerably. The tempo increases again after bar 37, reaches the climax in the sobbing and sighing section (bars 45-48), to calm down when Cherubino indulges in his amorous languor. However, if we look at each single stanza, we notice that tempo variability tends to decrease as speed values increase. If we consider bars 45-48 we notice that although this is the fastest and most agitated section in the entire piece, the internal standard deviation value is the lowest (SD = 0.06). On the other hand, when we look at bars 49-53 we find that the lowest speed (♩ = 41.4) goes together with the highest standard deviation value (SD = 0.39). This tendency is observable across the whole aria, as the moderate negative correlation measured between the metronome and the standard deviation values shows: r = -0.71 (Pearson).\n\nAt bar 54 Patti takes a slower tempo than at the beginning; however, the entire reprise is at a slightly quicker pace than the opening section and the standard deviation value approximates the initial one (SD = 0.20). One further element appears to be distinctive in Patti's interpretation, that is the emphasis on the semiquaver passages, where she slows down remarkably, leaving it to the pianist to catch up with the initial pace. As some critics observed already in 1863, Patti's recording presents no newly inserted bravura passages, in contrast to Cinti-Damoreau's interpretation (Caswell, 1989).\n\n\"Ah! non credea mirarti\" (1906)\n\nThe aria belongs to the final scene of Vincenzo Bellini's La sonnambula (1831), where the mystery that surrounds Amina is clarified. Her marriage to Elvino has been almost definitively compromised by her disease, since she has been seen sleepwalking into a man's room, and therefore believed guilty by the whole village. In the final scene Amina is sleepwalking again, this time on the high, dangerously unstable mill bridge, whence all the peasants can see her. She looks at the flower(s) Elvino has given her, and utters words of deep sorrow, for her love has proven to be as ephemeral and short-lived as the dry flower she is now holding (first stanza). Her tears can perhaps revive the flower, but they cannot revive love (second stanza).\n\nAmina's aria defies the conventional structure of the Italian lyric form, where a first pair of four-bar phrases (A4 A41) is followed by a contrasting medial four-bar phrase (B4), which either leads back to the initial melodic material (A4) or to a new closing four-bar phrase (C4) (Huebner, 1992; Adamo & Lippmann, 1981, pp. 428-429). Instead, Amina's aria combines phrases of different lengths that move from a minor to C Major (Zoppelli, 1996; Adamo & Lippmann, 1981, p. 484). The first stanza is set to a four-bar phrase followed by a five-bar phrase that is prolonged by two more bars. The two following four-bar phrases comprising Elvino's pertichini are not present in Patti's recording. In the second stanza a four-bar phrase in C Major is followed by a contracted three-bar phrase leading to the final cadenza through six more bars, which set to music the opening lines (\"Ah! non credea\"). In the bridge section a shift from a minor to C Major occurs which, according to the contemporary conventions, should find its justification in as distinct a change in the emotional content of the text, for example from sadness to joyfulness. It is not the case. Amina is not any happier than before; she rather expresses resignation, since her sorrowful tears can do nothing to change her destiny (at least apparently). However, while she expresses her grief in a state of unconsciousness, all the villagers are watching her. Amina's sleepwalking in front of the passers-by proves her innocence, and her words testify to her immaculate love. Therefore, the key change in the music may find its justification in the external conditions of the scene. Since the nature of Amina's disease is now made known to everybody and her virginal virtue is no longer in question, Elvino will marry her.\n\nPatti's interpretation (NI 7841: Cat. 03084; Matrix 683F) features such a high degree of variability that it is almost impossible to ascertain the correct metronome value. The measured beat length values (N = 102) result in a quite spread out data set; the distance between the mode (1.01 sec.; ♩ = 59.3) and the mean values (1.39 sec.; ♩ = 43.6) is large, the standard deviation is 0.68, which suggests a relatively high degree of internal variability. The entire first part is a little faster (♩ = 46) and steadier (SD = 0.58) than the second, where speed decreases (♩ = 39) but the standard deviation value raises to 0.74 (Table 3). As already observed in Mozart's arias, Patti takes advantage of the slower pace to indulge in a more nuanced interpretation.\n\nTable 3. The mean beat length and standard deviation values measured for each stanza of Bellini's \"Ah! non credea mirarti,\" with lyrical, structural and expressive descriptors.

Virtually all the descending figures are taken at a slower tempo, so as to assume a sobbing, sorrowful character. In addition to the ubiquitous portamentos, Patti enriches the score with a number of grace notes, a short internal cadenza, a passaggio at bar 14, and a chromaticism at bar 16 (Figure 1 in the appendix). However, her ornamented version appears to be quite discreet when compared to Jenny Lind's notated version (Caswell, 1989)."
