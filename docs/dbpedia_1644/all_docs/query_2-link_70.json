        "text": "ELENA\n\nExtra Low ENergy Antiproton ring (ELENA) is a 30 m hexagonal storage ring that decelerates antiproton beams and delivers it to different AD experiments. It is situated inside the Antiproton Decelerator (AD) complex at CERN, Geneva. It is designed to further decelerate the antiproton beam coming from the Antiproton decelerator to an energy of 0.1 MeV for more precise measurements. The first beam circulated ELENA on 18 November 2016. The ring is expected to be fully operational by the end of the Long Shutdown 2 (LS2) in 2021. GBAR experiment (AD-7) was the first experiment to use a beam from ELENA, with the rest of the AD experiments following suit after LS2 when beam transfer lines from ELENA will have been laid to all the experiments using the facility. Long Shutdown 2 (LS2) officially ended on July 5, 2022 with the beginning of LHC Run 3. Antiprotons from ELENA have been available to the MUSASHI trap of the ASACUSA CUSP experiment from August 2021.\n\nElena\n\nElena is a Bulgarian town in the central Stara Planina mountain in Veliko Tarnovo Province, located 42 km away to southeast from the city of Veliko Tarnovo.

As of December 2009, the town has a population of 5,665 inhabitants. It forms a terminal for the Gorna Oryahovitsa-Elena railway line.\n\nELENA\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, Elena is ranked #39717 in terms of the most common surnames in America.\n\nThe Elena surname appeared 553 times in the 2010 census and if you were to sample 100,000 people in the United States, approximately 0 would have the surname Elena.\n\n82.6% or 457 total occurrences were of Hispanic origin.\n\n15% or 83 total occurrences were White.\n\n0.9% or 5 total occurrences were Black.\n\n0.9% or 5 total occurrences were Asian.\n\nKobe Bryant:\n\nI think there are a couple of players who could play in the NBA right now, honestly, diana Taurasi, Maya Moore, Elena Della Donne. There's a lot of great players out there so they could certainly keep up with them."
