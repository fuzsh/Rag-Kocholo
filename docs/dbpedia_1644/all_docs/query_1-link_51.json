All the color and spirit of the music\n\nwas vividly brought out, Mr. Gabrilowitsch bringing to a finale\n\nthat was most brilliant. Altogether it was a wonderful per-\n\nformance. The program opened with Mendelssohn's overture\n\nto \"A Midsummer Night's Dream.\" This was played with\n\ngreat clarity and lyric beauty. Especially beautiful was the\n\nwork of the oboe and clarinet.\n\nWith the overture to \"Tannhauser\" Mr. Gabrilowitsch can\n\nalways lay a spell over his audience, and the other night's per-\n\nformance was no exception.

P.\n\nJudge James I. Ellmann was one of\n\nthe successful candidates for the\n\nmayoralty nomination of Highland\n\nPark at the primaries which took\n\nplace on Wednesday.\n\nJudge Ellmann issued another ap-\n\npeal to the people of Highland Park\n\ngiving his platform. He urged the\n\ncitizens of his city to register before\n\nthe last registration day, on March\n\n14, so they will be able to vote at\n\nthe election on April 3.\n\nAmong the complimentary things\n\nwritten about Judge Ellmann's candi-\n\ndacy is a letter written by Kent and\n\nHayes, lawyers, to voters of Highland\n\nPark:\n\n\"With reference to the coming\n\nelection in Highland Park, we take\n\nthe librety of writing you this letter\n\nto let you know that we highly-recom-\n\nmend Judge Ellmann for the office of\n\nmayor. We believe that as chief\n\nexecutive of the city of Highland\n\nPark he will bring to bear the same\n\nqualities that have distinguished him\n\nas justice, namely, energy, courtesy,\n\nsincerity, fairness and a fine sym-\n\npathy and respect for the rights of\n\nall who come before him, whatever\n\ntheir grade or station. If any liti-\n\ngant has ever left Judge Ellmann's\n\ncourt without feeling that he had had\n\nhis 'day in court' and that his rights\n\nhad been carefully considered, we\n\nhave yet to hear of him.\n\nTAKES CHARGE OF PURIM\n\nI. 0.
