        "text": "This information can be used as a quick and convenient way to give a character more depth. As well as name lists for Human citizens of The Empire, Dwarfs, Elves, Halflings, and Gnomes, there are tables for determining a character's height and weight, hair and eye colour, distinguishing characteristics, place of birth, and family background.\n\nPlayers can use this chapter to breathe life into a newly created character very simply. At the GM's option, players can pick from the various tables or reroll or ignore results that don't match with their developing conception of their character. Also, the GM has the final say on whether and to what extent a character's distinguishing characteristics affect his or her profile.\n\nThe GM can use this chapter to develop interesting NPCs just as quickly. A conversation overheard in a tavern becomes all the more interesting if one of the speakers is a huge man with red hair, a strawberry birthmark, and one eye, while the other is a scrawny-looking Dwarf with many scars and a stutter, rather than if they are both generic and undescribed cardboard cut-outs.\n\nCharacter Names[]\n\nHuman Names[]\n\nForenames[]\n\nThe following lists give common Imperial forenames. You can select names from the list as you need them or roll D1000 if you prefer. The list is not exhaustive, but includes most of the more popular forenames of use in the Empire.\n\nIn the tables, some names can have more than one form (including informal shortened forms) and these are shown under the same listing. Some of the names are followed by a number; the meanings of these are as follows:\n\nThese names can be combined to produce a compound name, e.g. Karl-Franz, Hans-Peter, Anne-Lise, Marie-Astrid. This practice is most commonly used among members of the nobility.\n\nThese names are archaic, but are still in use occasionally. They are most popular among the nobility and the older generations.\n\nThese names show Kislevite influence. They are most common in the north and east of the Empire, but are not unknown elsewhere.\n\nThese names show Wastelander influence; they are most common in the northwest of the Empire, but are also used in other areas.\n\nThese names show Norse influence; they are most common in the extreme north of the Empire, but are also used in other areas.\n\nThese names are more common in the south of the Empire than elsewhere.\n\nThese names show Bretonnian influence; they are most common in the west of the Empire, but are also used in other areas.\n\nD1000 Roll Imperial Male Forenames 001-002 Adam 003-006 Adelbert2 007-022 Adolf / Adolphus2 023-026 Albert 027-034 Albricht / Alberich / Albrecht 035-036 Aldheim 037-044 Alex / Alexei3 / Alexis3 045-048 Alfred / Alfried 049-050 Alfricht 051-066 Anders4/5 067-074 Andreas 075-082 Anton6/7 083-084 Arthur 085-088 Axel 089-092 Barthelm 093-100 Bengt5 101-116 Bernhard / Bernhardt 117-132 Berthold / Bertholdt 133-140 Boris 141-164 Bruno 165-196 Carolus2 / Carl1 / Karl1 197-220 Claus / Klaus 221-228 Conrad / Konrad 229-232 Diehl 233-240 Dieter 241-244 Dietrich 245-248 Eberhard / Eberhardt 249-250 Eckhard / Eckhardt 251-254 Edgar 255-262 Ehrhard / Ehrhardt 263-266 Ehrmann 267-268 Emmerich 269-292 Erich 293-324 Ernst 325-332 Erwin 333-334 Faustmann 335-336 Felix2/6 337-340 Ferdinand 341-372 Franz1 373-404 Friedrich / Fritz1 / Frederik 405-408 Gebhard / Gebhardt 409-412 Georg1/3 413-420 Gerhard / Gerhardt 421-424 Gottfried 425-428 Gotthard / Gotthardt 429-432 Gottlieb 433-434 Gregor3 435-438 Gunnar 439-446 Gunthar / Gunther 447-462 Gustaf / Gustav / Gustavus2 463-466 Hals 467-498 Hannes1 / Hans 499-500 Hartwig 501-516 Heinrich 517-524 Heinz1 525-526 Heironymus2 527-534 Helmut 535-536 Hergard 537-544 Herman / Hermann 545-546 Herpin 547-548 Hildebrand / Hildebrandt 549-550 Holger5 551-554 Hugo6/7 555-556 Hultz 557-558 Humfried 559-562 Jakob 563-566 Joachim4 567-598 Johann1 / Johannes 599-606 Josef1 607-608 Kaspar 609-610 Kastor 611-614 Knud5 / Knut5 615-638 Kurt 639-640 Lorenz6 641-642 Leonhard 643-646 Leopold 647-648 Luitpold 649-656 Ludovicus2 / Ludwig 657-660 Lukas 661-664 Magnus2 665-672 Martin 673-676 Matthias 677-684 Max1 / Maximillian 685-686 Moritz6 687-694 Niklaus / Nikolas / Nikolaus 695-698 Olaf5 699-700 Oskar7 701-708 Otto 709-716 Paul1 / Paulus 717-724 Peter1 / Pieter 725-726 Quintus2 727-728 Ralf5 729-736 Rolf1/5 737-738 Reinald 739-746 Reiner 747-754 Reinhard / Reinhardt 755-762 Reinhold 763-766 Reinwald 767-770 Rudiger / Rutger 771-778 Rudolf / Rudi 779-780 Ruprecht 781-788 Siegfried 789-792 Sigismund / Siggi 793-800 Sigmund / Siggi 801-802 Stehmar 803-818 Stephan / Stefan 819-820 Theodosius2/6 / Theo 821-822 Theophilus2/6 / Theo 823-830 Thomas 831-832 Tobias2/6 833-840 Udo 841-844 Uhler 845-852 Ulrich 853-856 Viktor3 857-860 Vorster 861-868 Waldemar 869-876 Walter 877-909 Werner 910-942 Wilhelm 943-959 Wolf 960-983 Wolfgang 984-000 Wolmar\n\nD1000 Roll Imperial Female Forenames 001-005 Agnes2 006-015 Agnetha2/5 016-020 Alexa3 021-030 Alfrida5 031-035 Alice / Alicia 036-040 Amalie 041-060 Andrea 061-065 Anika 066-090 Anna1 091-095 Astrid1/4/5 096-100 Barbara2/6 101-105 Beatrix2/6 106-115 Berta / Bertha 116-125 Bianka6 126-130 Birgit5 131-145 Brigette / Gitta4/5 146-155 Britt / Brita5 156-170 Brunhild / Brunhilde 171-180 Charlotte / Carlott 181-190 Carina6 191-200 Carmilla2/3 201-205 Claudia2/6/7 206-215 Dagmar 216-220 Elena6 221-230 Elfrida5 231-250 Elisa / Elise 251-260 Elisabeth 261-275 Elsa 276-285 Emmanuelle6/7 286-295 Emilie 296-300 Erika5 301-305 Esther6 306-315 Etelka 316-340 Eva 341-350 Franziska7 351-360 Frida5 361-370 Gabrielle / Gabi7 371-385 Gerda 386-390 Gertrud2 / Gertrude2 391-400 Gilda 401-415 Greta5 416-425 Gretel 426-435 Gretchen 436-450 Hanna 451-460 Hedwig 461-470 Heidi 471-475 Helena6 476-495 Hilda 496-505 Hildegard 506-515 Hunni 516-530 Ilsa / Ilse 531-550 Inga 551-570 Ingrid4/5 571-575 Irene / Irina6 576-590 Isolde 591-615 Johanna / Janna 616-620 Juliane6 621-625 Karelia5 626-635 Karin5 636-645 Karoline6/7 646-660 Katharine / Katrina6/7 661-680 Kirsten5 681-690 Klara2/6 691-700 Leonore / Leni 701-710 Ludmilla 711-715 Luise / Lise1 716-720 Magdalene / Magda 721-725 Margaritha6/7 726-735 Marianne 736-750 Marlene 751-760 Martha / Marte 761-765 Martina 766-775 Marie1/6/7 / Maria1/6/7 776-780 Mathilde / Tilda6/7 781-785 Nastassia3 786-790 Natasha3 791-795 Ottilia 796-800 Petra6 801-815 Regina / Regine / Gina 816-830 Renata / Renate 831-835 Selena6 836-850 Sigrid5 851-855 Sigrun5 856-860 Silma 861-870 Solveig3 871-880 Sophia6 881-890 Susanne2/6 / Susanna2/6 / Susi 891-895 Theodora / Dora6 896-900 Theodosia / Theda6 901-910 Therese6 911-920 Thylda 921-935 Ulrike / Ulla 936-960 Ursula / Uschi 961-965 Veronica6/7 966-975 Wanda 976-985 Wertha 986-000 Wilhemina / Mina\n\nSurnames[]\n\nAs in mediaeval Europe, the forename is most commonly used to identify a person and the surname is used when the identification needs to be more precise - when the use of the forename alone is not sufficient. Family surnames aren't always handed down from parent to child, as we do today. Instead, most people adopt their surname when they leave home or become adult to distinguish themselves. Often, this will mean using a 'family' name, but there are many cases of children giving themselves an entirely new surname.\n\nSurnames can be drawn from a variety of sources.\n\nPlace names: For example, Johann Dunkelberg, 'Johann from Dunkelberg'. Any of the various placenames mentioned in the Empire would be usable as a surname. The nobility often add 'von' or 'von der' before the placename, particularly in cases where the surname is part of a title.\n\nOccupation: For example, Johann Schmidt, 'Johann the Smith'. This can become fossilised in use and it is quite common for a character to be known by the occupation of his or her parents or grandparents, whe he or she actually follows a quite different profession; so 'Johann the Smith' might actually be a carpenter or a boatman. Of course, if Johann wishes to be known as Johann Zimmermann (Johann the Carpenter) or Johann Bootmann (Johann the Boatman), there's nothing to stop him from changing his surname - he simply does it!\n\nAn English-German dictionary can be a very usefly source of names of this type. A few surname associated with common professions are listed below:\n\nBaker Bäcker Blacksmith Schmidt Brewer Brauer Boatman Bootmann Builder Baumeister or Bauer Butcher Fleischer Carpenter Zimmermann Cobbler Schuster Cooper Küfer Engraver Graveur Farmer Bauer Glass Maker Glaser Hunter Jäger Jeweller Juwelier Merchant Handler Pedlar Hausier Potter Topfer Printer Drucker Scribe Schreiber Shipwright Schiffbauer Stonemason Maurer Tailor Schneider Tanner Gerber\n\nNickname: For example, Johann Grosz, 'Johann the Fat'. If a character has a particularly noticeable physical trait which people use to refer to them, this might be used as their surname. Using the list of physical traits below together with an English-German dictionary can give you a wide range of descriptive surnames. Here are a few examples:\n\nLarge nose Nase Scar on face Narbe One eye Einauge or Augenlos One arm Einarm or Armlos Attractive face Schön Huge frame Grosz or Stark Big belly Grosz Bald Kahl Hairy Haarig Huge beard Bart or Grossbart Stooping Bucker Very tall Lang Very short Kurz Very skinny Dunn Pale-skinned Blass or Bleich Stutter Stotter Loud voice Laut\n\nParent or Ancestor: For example, Johann Hanson, 'Johann, son of Hans'. Naming yourself after a famous parent or ancestor - real or imagined - is very common. Sigmarsson may be one of the most-used surnames in the Empire. This form of surname is particularly prevalent in the north of the Empire, possibly as a result of Norse contacts and influence. The form 'von' is sometimes used to imply a connection with a famous person - von der Magnus, for example.\n\nWith an English-German dictionary and a bit of imagination, you can come up with many more surnames for PCs and NPCs. The nobility will use 'von' more often than the lower classes, and the artisan classes - where one family has been in the same business for generations - will often take the name of their craft for their own. In general, surnames derived from placenames and nicknames will be most common amongst the peasantry and the urban lower classes. 'Hans Brandstadt', for example, won't be very effective as a name if Brandstadt has thousands of inhabitants and every fifth male is called Hans, while 'Lugwig Johannsson von Altdorf' is too grand-sounding to be a good name for a thief or beggar - a nickname like 'Flink' ('the nimble') would sound better.\n\nDwarfish Names[]\n\nA Dwarf's full name consists of three elements: the forename or personal name, the surname, and the clan name. There is a complex Dwarf etiquette governing the use of names, but for most practical purposes, the more formal the circumstances, the more lengthy the name used. In certain circumstances, a Dwarf's standing in his craft also becomes part of his name.\n\nSo, for example, Master Jeweller Snorri Bardinsson of the Makhzad Clan would use his full name and title in a guild or hold ceremony. Those addressing him would call him by different names according to their relative status: superiors would call him Snorri Bardinson, while equals and inferiors would call him Master Snorri if they were also jewellers, or Master Jeweller Snorri, if they were from other craftguilds. When talking about him in the third person, his surname is always used.\n\nClose friends, and relatives of the same generation, would just call him Snorri - relatives of older or younger generations would add a suffix such as Uncle, Nephew, Cousin or Grandfather, describing the nature of their relationship to him.\n\nForenames[]\n\nDwarfs follow a similar practice to humans, naming an infant at birth. Some names reflect tradition - in the Garkniz Clan of Karak-Hirn, for example, the first-born male of each generation is always named Gottri - while others commemorate a venerated clan ancestor or great hero. The generations immediately after the War of Vengeance, for example, saw a rise in the popularity of Gotrek as a forename, after the victorious king High King Gotrek Starbreaker. A few names are given to reflect the virtues that the parents hope their offspring will have; Gorm, for example, is associated with wisdom, Grim with prowess in battle, and Dwinbar with skill at craftsmanship.\n\nD1000 Male Forenames 001-009 Alaric 010-018 Algrim 019-027 Alrik 028-037 Baragor 038-045 Bardin 046-053 Belegar 054-061 Bel(e)gol 062-070 Borgin 071-079 Borin 080-088 Bradni 089-098 Brogar 099-107 Brokk 108-115 Brond(l) 116-121 Bronn 122-129 Burlok 130-137 Cranneg 138-145 Darbli 146-153 Dargo 154-161 Dern 162-170 Dimrond 171-179 Dimzad 180-184 Dorin 185-188 Drong 189-200 Drumin 201-209 Durak 210-218 Duregar 219-227 Durgin 228-234 Dwinbar 235-239 Elmador 240-246 Enlag 247-253 Fenni 254-261 Fimbur 262-270 Finn 271-279 Furgil 280-288 Garil 289-300 Goddi 301-309 Gomrund 310-318 Gorazin 319-327 Gorim 328-337 Gorm 338-345 Gotrek 346-353 Gottri 354-361 Grim 362-370 Grimli 371-379 Grindol 380-390 Grom 391-400 Grond 401-409 Groth 410-418 Grum 419-427 Grumdin 428-437 Grundi 438-445 Grung 446-453 Grunni 454-461 Guttri 462-470 Haakon 471-479 Hadra 480-489 Harek 490-499 Hargin 500-507 Hargrim 508-512 Harok 513-518 Heganbor 519-527 Hergar 528-537 Hugnir 538-545 Hurgar 546-553 Kadri 554-561 Kadrin 562-570 Kallon 571-579 Kargun 580-589 Katalin 590-600 Kazadar 601-609 Kazgar 610-618 Kazran 619-627 Kazrik 628-637 Ketil 638-645 Kettri 646-653 Kragg 654-661 Krudd 662-670 Kurgan 671-679 Largs 680-689 Logan 690-700 Logazor 701-707 Lunn 708-718 Mendri 719-727 Mordin 728-737 Morek 738-753 Mundri 754-761 Norgrim 762-768 Oldor 769-775 Ragni 776-784 Rogni 785-790 Rorek 791-800 Rungni 801-812 Skag 813-820 Skaldor 821-830 Skalf 831-838 Skalli 839-844 Skorri 845-851 Sindri 852-860 Snorri 861-866 Stromni 867-874 Storri 875-882 Sundrim 883-890 Sven 891-900 Thingrim 901-909 Thori 910-920 Thrund 921-929 Thungni 930-936 Thurgrom 937-942 Thyk 943-950 Ulfar 951-957 Ulther 958-965 Vikram 966-972 Vragni 973-980 Yadri 981-988 Yanni 989-993 Yorri 994-000 Zamnil\n\nD1000 Female Forenames 001-023 Alrika 024-046 Askima 047-070 Astrid 071-094 Berta 095-117 Boria 118-137 Breda 138-159 Brondra 160-183 Derna 184-200 Dorbi 201-221 Duree 222-242 Fenna 243-263 Freda 264-284 Friga 285-305 Gerta 306-328 Gottra 329-349 Grondi 350-363 Grunna 364-385 Harga 386-405 Helga 406-426 Helgar 427-451 Hunni 452-476 Kalea 477-500 Karelia 501-526 Karga 527-553 Karstin 554-579 Katrin 580-603 Kettra 604-611 Lakin 612-625 Lenka 626-646 Magda 647-667 Menni 668-688 Modra 689-709 Morga 710-730 Olka 731-751 Sifna 752-774 Sigrid 775-797 Sigrun 798-815 Skorina 816-828 Solveig 829-837 Sunni 838-844 Tarni 845-857 Tharma 858-876 Thindra 877-895 Thoda 896-916 Throlin 917-926 Trunni 927-937 Ulla 938-958 Vala 959-979 Valma 980-994 Vanyra 995-000 Zylra\n\nSurnames[]\n\nDwarf surnames are based on the parent's name - the mother's name is used for girls, and the father's name for boys. Gotrek Gunnisson, for example, is Gotrek, the son of Gunni, while Katrin Sifnasdottir is Katrin, the daughter of Sifna. Orphans are raised by their nearest relatives, and their surname refelcts this: Thorri Yadrisnev - Thorri, the nephew of Yadri, was obviously raised at his uncle's hearth, and Sigrid Valasniz was raised by her aunt.\n\nOn the extremely rare occasions when a newborn Dwarf is a foundling of unknown descent, the surname Khazadson - \"son of a Dwarf\" - is used in formal circumstances; informally, the surname consists of the step-parent's name with the suffix -find, meaning \"found by\". In this way, Grim Khazadson, raised by Morek Skalfsson, uses the surname Moreksfind in everyday circumstances, to indicate which family he belongs to.\n\nNicknames[]\n\nMany Dwarfs also have nicknames, derived from oustanding deeds or quirks of their personality or appearance. In less formal circumstances, a nickname may be used in place of the surname: Snorri Burnt-Thumb instead of Snorri Bardinson, commemorating the time as an apprentice when young Snorri absent-mindedly picked up a brooch blank that was still hot from casting. A Dwarf may not choose his own nickname; it must be given him by his master. This is one of the many reasons why Dwarfs take great care about what they do - no one wants to be stuck for life with an embarassing or unflattering nickname!\n\nMale nicknames are often based on physcial appearance, strength, or martial prowess. Examples of these surnames include Greathammer, Stonefist, and Deadeye. Nicknames must be unique, as much as possible, since adopting the same nickname as an older Dwarf - especially a great king or hero - is regarded as presumptious, and an insult to the nickname's original bearer. The only exception to this rule is when the original bearer of the nickname gives it freely to the younger Dwarf. The nickname Stonehammer, for example, has been passed down through the Kings of Karak Ungor for generations, along with the great stone warhammer from which it derives. A Dwarf who is given a nickname in this way is responsible not only for his own honour, but also for the honour of the nickname and all its previous bearers; this is taken very seriously indeed.\n\nFemale nicknames are not so exclusive as male ones, and tend to be based on temperament as much as appearance and achievement. So many Dwarf maidens have been nicknamed \"the Fair\" or \"the Beautiful\" that these names have become debased by over-use, and have fallen out of currency in recent centuries. However, nicknames like Goldenhair, Sapphire-Eyes and Finehand are still popular, and even more lavish and flattering nicknames are given by suitors in the hope of winning a Dwarf maiden's heart. It is a sign of great favour when a Dwarf maiden accepts a nickname from a suitor.\n\nClan Names[]\n\nDwarf clan names were originally established in the same way as nicknames. They may have been the personal nickname of a founding ancestor, or they may be a nickname that was applied to the clan as a whole at or around the time of its founding. For example, tradition states that the ruling Durazklad or \"Stone armour\" clan of Karaz-a-Karak draws its name from an incident in the time of the Ancestor Gods, when Kargun Gormsson, unable to afford metal armour, used his stoneworking skills to make himself a helmet and breastplate of granite. The nickname that he gained from this feat became the name of the clan he founded, and his stone armour is still in the clan's vault at Karaz-a-Karak.\n\nElven Names[]\n\nThe Elves - being typically complicated - use a system of names with is almost incomprehensible to outsiders. The principle is to have a name which sounds beautiful (apparently the consonants 'l' and 'r' make particularly beautiful sounds) and which has a beautiful meaning. However, the meaning attached to a name is often whatever the name-bearer wants it to be. The Dwarfs delight in telling the story of an Elven Prince who insisted that his name was translatable as 'Far-Wisdom', but the words of which it consisted could also be translated as 'Belch Eyeballs'.\n\nElven names defy analysis. The use of one, two, or three names is equally common and each name is normally made up of two parts, each providing something to the overall meaning. Occasionally, an Elf who has taken to living in Human society will adopt one or more names which are from the Old Worlder tongue. Such names tend to express rural themes and continue the Elven tradition of something which sounds beautiful and expresses 'noble' feelings. Goldleaf, Dewgatherer, Airwarmth, and Greenlight are common such names.\n\nThe table below allows you to create more traditional Elven names; roll once for a prefix and then again for a suffix and blend the two parts together, adding or deleting extra letters to make an easily-pronounceable name. Both names come from the same stock of elements and there does not appear to be any distinction between 'forenames' and 'surnames' in Elven eyes. Some Elven names, particularly those of the little-seen Elven nobility, may have three elements (effectively they have two suffixes); this is rumoured to be a High Elf tradition, but it is not sure that even the Elves know this for certain.\n\nThere is very little difference, to non-Elves at least, between Elven male and female names. Dwarfs and some Humans gleefully contend that this is because there is very little difference between male and female Elves in all other respects. Names generated using the table above are suitable for Elves of either sex, although most names can be given an emphatic feminine form by removing the last consonant and/or adding a vowel to the end, hence Sarellian can become Sarellia or Sarelliane.\n\nRoll 1: D100 Elven Prefix 01-03 Aes 04-05 Air 06-08 Al(d) 09-10 Am 11-12 Ang 13-14 Ca(l) 15-16 Car 17-18 Dol 19-20 Edri 21-22 Eldi(r) 23-24 Ell 25-26 Epon 27-29 Err 30-31 Fan 32-33 Far 34-36 Fil 37-38 Gal 39-40 Gil 41-43 Hal 44-45 Har 46-47 Has 48-49 Ilu 50-51 Im(ra) 52-53 Io 54-55 Lar 56-57 Laure(l) 58-60 Lin 61-63 Lor 64-66 Lora(l) 67-68 Mal 69-70 Mar 71-72 Mor 73-74 Orr 75-77 Pel 78-79 Ral 80-81 Shas 82-84 Sir 85-86 Tall(a) 87-88 Ter 89-90 Tor 91-92 Ullia(l) 93-94 Urdi(th) 95-96 Val 97-98 Vir 99-00 Yav(a)\n\nRoll 2: D100 Elven Suffix 01-03 alion 04-05 andar(a) 06-08 andil(e) 09-10 andilas 11-12 andiril 13-14 ane 15-16 anel 17-18 arel 19-20 err 21-22 avandrel 23-24 core(l) 25-26 coran(na) 27-29 dil 30-31 drigar 32-33 elliion 34-36 endil 37-38 fan(a) 39-40 far 41-43 galiel 44-45 gran(a) 46-47 hal(i) 48-49 hil(e) 50-51 holen 52-53 huir 54-55 ia(n) 56-57 ina(l) 58-60 inde(l) 61-63 irllan 64-66 lad 67-68 liana(n) 69-70 lor 71-72 mal 73-74 maris 75-77 mir 78-79 mor 80-81 nor 82-84 oth 85-86 ras 87-88 riel 89-90 rond 91-92 thin 93-94 thol 95-96 uviel 97-98 wen 99-00 wine\n\nHalfling Names[]\n\nForenames[]\n\nBeing the most Humanised of the non-human races, Halflings often use names which are largely recognisable as being in Old Worlder. The Halflings of the Moot use those Imperial names which they find pleasing. Although they love long and grand-sounding names for their genealogies, they also like a name which can be shortened comfortably for everyday use. Names like Maximillian - shortening to Max, Ludwig - shortening to Ludo, Thomas, Hugo, Adam, Albert, Agnes, Eva, and Frida are all common among Halflings. Essentially, if a Human name has a 'cosy' sound (or, better yet, sounds vaguely grand and has a cosy-sounding abbreviation), it will appeal to the Halflings.\n\nThe use of nicknames and pet-names is also common; a Halfling will always have a 'proper' forename for use in family trees and so on, but Heironymus Greenhill may be known as Hiro or even Scrumper to his friends and non-Halflings might know him by that name for years without finding out his 'proper' name.\n\nSurnames[]\n\nHalflings prefer distinctive and cosy-sounding surnames and, if two Halflings have the same surname, then they are definitely related somehow. It may take several dozen generations (and a like number of fruit pies and spiced ales) to trace their connection, but it will definitely be there and they will find it in the end. Names like Haleberry, Greenhill, Furfoot, Hayfoot, Greendale, Warmfeet, and Brandysnap are common and show off the Halflings' love of food and drink and their pride in their hairy feet.\n\nGnomes[]\n\nGnomes are similar in most regards to Dwarfs.\n\nWeight[]\n\nThe following tables can be used to generate a character's weight. Roll on Weight Table 1 to determine a character's build and apply any modifiers to the roll on Weight Table 2. Consult Weight Table 3 to determine whether there are any further modifiers owing to the character's height. Weight Table 4 is optional; it can be used if you wish to make female characters generally lighter than males. Finally, Weight Table 5 can be used as an option, to reflect how the weight of entremely fat or thin characters affects their profiles.\n\nWeight Table 1: Build[]\n\nD6 Human Dwarf Elf Halfling Gnome 1 puny light puny light light 2 light average light average average 3 average average light average average 4 average heavy average heavy heavy 5 heavy heavy average massive heavy 6 massive massive average massive massive\n\nPuny characters must subtract 20 from their roll on Weight Table 2 and subtract 2D10 lbs from their final weight.\n\nLight characters must subtract 10 from their roll on Weight Table 2.\n\nAverage characters have no modifier.\n\nHeavy characters add 10 to their roll on Weight Table 2.\n\nMassive characters add 20 to their roll on Weight Table 2 and add 2D10 to their final weight.\n\nWeight Table 2: Base Weight (in lbs)[]\n\nD100 Human Dwarf Elf Halfling Gnome 01 105 90 80 75 75 02-03 110 95 85 75 80 04-05 115 100 90 80 85 06-08 120 105 95 80 90 09-12 125 110 100 85 90 13-17 130 115 100 85 95 18-22 135 120 105 90 100 23-29 140 125 110 90 100 30-37 145 130 115 95 105 38-49 150 135 120 100 110 50-64 155 140 120 100 110 65-71 160 145 125 105 115 72-78 165 150 130 110 120 79-83 170 155 135 115 120 84-88 175 160 140 120 125 89-92 180 165 140 125 130 93-95 190 170 145 130 130 96-97 200 175 150 135 135 98-99 210 180 155 140 140 00 220 185 160 145 155\n\nWeight Table 3: Height Modifier (in lbs)[]\n\nHeight Human Dwarf Elf Halfling Gnome 3' 3\" or less - - - -D10 - 3' 4\" - 3' 6\" - - - -D6 -D10 3' 7\" - 4' 0\" - - - 0 0 4' 1\" - 4' 3\" - - - +D6 0 4' 4\" - 4' 6\" - -2D10 - +D10 +D10 4' 7\" - 4' 8\" - 0 - - - 4' 9\" - 5' 3\" -2D10 +2D10 - - - 5' 4\" - 5' 6\" -D20 - -D20 - - 5' 7\" - 5' 8\" -D10 - -D10 - - 5' 9\" - 5' 11\" 0 - 0 - - 6' 0\" - 6' 2\" +D10 - +D10 - - 6' 3\" - 6' 5\" +D20 - +D20 - - 6' 6\" or more +2D10 - - - -\n\nWeight Table 4: Gender Modifier (in lbs; Optional)[]\n\nWeight Table 1 assumes a male character; for female characters, apply the following additional modifiers.\n\nD6 Human Dwarf Elf Halfling Gnome 1 -2D10 - - -D20 -D20 2 -D20 -2D10 - -D10 -D10 3-4 -1D10 -D20 - -D6 -D6 5 -D6 -D10 - - - 6 - -D6 - +D6 -\n\nWeight Table 5: Characteristics Modifiers (Optional)[]\n\nIf a character is a lot heavier or lighter than average, the GM may optionally impose some modifiers to the character's profile. To find out whether a character is seriously overweight or underweight, look up the final weight on the appropriate column of the Weight Table 2 and refer back to the dice roll column. A character is overweight if the final weight corrosponds to a dice roll of 96 or more and underweight if the final weight corrosponds to a dice roll of 05 or less. Thus, a Human character weighing 200 lbs or more is overweight and a Human character weighing 115 lbs or less is underweight.\n\nProfile adjustments may be generated using the following table:\n\nD6 Overweight Underweight 1-2 T +1 T -1 3-4 T +1, I -10 T -1, I +10 5-6 T +1, I -10, M -1 T -1, I +10, M +1\n\nHair Colour[]\n\nUse the table below to generate characters' hair colour.\n\nNotes:\n\nDwarfs and Elves often dye their hair; this table only gives the base colour.\n\nNot necessarily the original colour. For older characters (Humans of 35+, Dwarfs of 90+, Elves of 100+, Halflings of 70+, Gnomes of 80+), players can make two rolls. The first is the 'natural' hair colour. The second, if the result is white, shows that the hair has turned grey or white with age.\n\nThis table is based on the normal colours for characters from the Empire, the Wasteland, Bretonnia, Albion, and Kislev. If the character was born anywhere else, some modifiers should be allowed. Norse Dwarfs and Humans, for example, could roll 3D20, while Tileans or Estalians might roll 3D10+70, and characters from Araby might roll D6+94.\n\nD100 Human Dwarf1 Elf1 Halfling Gnome 01-05 White2 White2 White2 White2 White2 06-10 White2 White2 Silver Ash-blond White2 11-15 Silver Ash-blond Silver Ash-blond Ash-blond 16-20 Silver Ash-blond Ash-blond Corn Ash-blond 21-25 Ash-blond Corn Ash-blond Corn Corn 26-30 Corn Yellow Corn Corn Yellow 31-35 Corn Yellow Corn Yellow Yellow 36-40 Corn Red Yellow Yellow Copper 41-45 Yellow Red Yellow Copper Copper 46-50 Copper Copper Copper Red Red 51-55 Copper Copper Light Brown Light Brown Red 56-60 Red Light Brown Light Brown Light Brown Light Brown 61-65 Light Brown Light Brown Med.

If the character was born anywhere else, some modifiers should be allowed. Norse Dwarfs and Humans, for example, could roll 2D20 or 3D20 to get the result, while Tileans, Estalians, and Arabs might roll 3D10+70 or even D10+90.\n\nPlayers might also wish to disallow certain hair/eye colour combinations, if a bizarre mix is going to jar their sensibilities. It is probably best to generate hair colour first and re-roll any eye colour rolls that don't suit. As an option, you might allow a character a 1% chance of having eyes of different colours; while this will make the character interesting and instantly recognisable, it might be taken in some quarters as the mark of Chaos...\n\nD100 Human Dwarf / Gnome Elf Halfling 01-05 Grey Pale Grey Pale Grey Pale Grey 06-10 Pale Grey Pale Grey Grey-blue Blue 11-15 Grey-blue Blue Grey-blue Blue 16-20 Grey-blue Blue Blue Hazel 21-25 Blue Hazel Blue Hazel 26-30 Blue Light Brown Green Hazel 31-35 Blue Light Brown Green Light Brown 36-40 Green Light Brown Light Brown Light Brown 41-45 Hazel Light Brown Light Brown Copper 46-50 Hazel Copper Copper Med.

Some of them have suggested modifiers. GMs may use these modifiers for NPCs if desired and may even apply them to player characters, if they are sure players will accept bad rolls as well as good. Most characters will have D6-2 Distinguishing Characteristics.

PCs ought to come from the Empire, unless the GM has a strong reason for deciding otherwise. If an NPC comes from a part of the Old World which has not been sufficiently detailed, the GM can be vague about his or her origins - it wouldn't be anywhere the Player Characters would have heard of anyway. Maps of The Empire will likely show the locations of the places listed on the tables.\n\nHumans[]\n\nUse Origins Table 1 and, if necessary, Origins Table 2 to determine where Human characters come from.\n\nOrigins Table 1: The Empire[]\n\nD100 Origin 01-25 Altdorf (urban) 26-50\n\nAltdorf (rural)\n\n01-06 Teufelfeuer 07-11 Rechtlich 12-17 Heiligen 18-23 Gluckshalt 24-29 Hartsklein 30-35 Schlafebild 36-41 Hochloff 42-47 Rottefach 48-53 Walfen 54-59 Furtild 60-65 Grossbad 66-71 Bundesmarkt 72-77 Brauenwurt 78-83 Dorchen 84-89 Geldrecht 90-95 Kaldach 96-00 Autler\n\n51-54\n\nGrunburg\n\n01-50\n\nGrunburg 51-62 Aussen 63-70 Silberwurt 71-85 Kleindorf 86-00 Hornlach\n\n55-59\n\nAuerswald\n\n01-50 Auerswald 51-60 Dresschler 61-70 Gladisch 71-80 Koch 81-90 Sprinthof 91-00 Steche\n\n60-63\n\nDelberz\n\n01-55 Delberz 56-70 Mittelmund 71-85 Schwarzmarkt 86-00 Turmgever\n\n64-67\n\nDunkelburg\n\n01-58 Dunkelburg 59-65 Barfsheim 66-72 Gemusenbad 73-78 Harke 79-85 Ruhfurt 86-92 Schattental 93-00 Steindorf\n\n68-71\n\nCarroburg\n\n01-50 Carroburg 51-60 Anseldorf 61-70 Dunkelbild 71-80 Punzen 81-90 Schattenlas 91-00 Weidemarkt\n\n72-74\n\nSchoppendorf\n\n01-50 Schoppendorf 51-60 Brasthof 61-70 Esselfurt 71-80 Priestlicheim 81-90 Ripdorf 91-00 Zeder\n\n75-77\n\nStimmigen\n\n01-60 Stimmigen 61-70 Merretheim 71-80 Misthausen 81-90 Naffdorf 91-00 Pfeiffer\n\n78 Blutroch 79 Weissbruck 80\n\nBogenhafen\n\n01-50 Bogenhafen 51-62 Finsterbad 63-75 Ardlich 76-88 Herzhald 89-00 Grubevon\n\n81-83\n\nKemperbad\n\n01-50 Kemperbad 51-60 Berghof 61-70 Brandenburg 71-80 Jungbach 81-90 Ostwald 91-00 Stockhausen\n\n84-86\n\nUbersreik\n\n01-50 Ubersreik 51-57 Buchedorf 58-64 Flussberg 65-71 Geissbach 72-88 Halheim 89-95 Messingen 96-00 Wurfel\n\n87-88 Marienburg 89-90\n\nNuln\n\n01-60 Nuln 61-80 Wissenburg 81-00 Pfeildorf\n\n91 Averheim 92 Streissen 93 Wurtbad 94 Talabheim 95\n\nMiddenheim\n\n01-60 Middenheim 61-80 Bergsburg 81-00 Salzenmund\n\n96-00 Foreigner: roll on Origins Table 2\n\nOrigins Table 2: Outside The Empire[]\n\nD100 Origin 01-25\n\nBretonnia\n\n01-12 L'Anguille 13-24 Bordeleaux 25-36 Brionne 37-48 Couronne 49-62 Gisoreux 63-74 Mousillon 75-88 Parravon 89-00 Quenelles\n\n26-45\n\nKislev\n\n01-25 Erengrad 26-75 Kislev 76-00 Praag\n\n46-70\n\nEstalia\n\n01-50 Bilbali 51-00 Magritta\n\n71-90\n\nTilea\n\n01-20 Luccini 21-40 Miragliano 41-60 Remas 61-80 Sartosa 81-00 Tobaro\n\n91-98 Border Princes 99-00\n\n'Outworlder'\n\n01-20 Norsca 21-45 Araby 46-70 Albion 71-85 Southlands 86-00 E.

Alternatively, the GM may reserve the right to assign a birthplace to a newly created Dwarf character, if it is in the interests of the campaign to do so.\n\nThe table is heavily weighted in favour of Expatriate Dwarfs, since they form the majority of the Old World's Dwarfen adventurers; in the more traditional culture of the Dwarfholds, duty to clan, hold and crafsguild prevent all but a few Dwarfs from leaving to take up an adventuring life.\n\nDwarf Origins Table[]\n\nD100 Origin 01-03 Border Princes 04 Bretonnia 05-66 The Empire 67-68 Kislev 69 Tilea 70-75 The Wasteland 76-80 Norsca 81-84 Black Mountains 85-92 Grey Mountains 93-95 The Vaults 96-00 Worlds Edge Mountains\n\nDwarf Settlement Tables[]\n\nBorder Princes 01-30 Barak Varr 31-00 Human settlements\n\nBretonnia 01-40 Parravon 41-00 Nearby villages\n\nTilea 01-30 Campogrotta 31-60 Toscania 61-00 Nearby villages\n\nThe Wasteland 01-90 Marienburg 91-00 Other Wasteland towns\n\nNorsca 01-35 Kraka Dorden 36-60 Kraka Drak 61-75 Kraka Ornsmotek 76-90 Kraka Ravnsvake 91-00 Human settlements\n\nBlack Mountains 01-20 Karak Hirn 21-00 Other Black Mountain settlements\n\nGrey Mountains 01-35 Karak Norn 36-00 Other Grey Mountain settlements\n\nThe Vaults 01-15 Karak Izor 16-00 Other Vaults settlements\n\nWorlds Edge Mountains 01-10 Karak Kadrin 11-15 Karaz-a-Karak 16-20 Zhufbar 21-60 Other Northern Dwarf settlement 61-65 Karak Azul 66-70 Karak Eight Peaks 71-00 Other Southern Dwarf settlements\n\nThe Empire 01-15 Altdorf (urban) 16-20 Altdorf (rural) villages 21-25\n\nAverland towns\n\n01-15 Agbetten 16-50 Averheim 51-60 Hochelben 61-70 Loningbruck 71-85 Streissen 86-00 Other Averland villages\n\n26 Hochland (Bergsburg) 27-30 Middenheim (urban) 31 Middenheim (rural) villages 32-33\n\nMiddenland towns\n\n01-50 Carroburg 51-75 Delberz 76-00 Schoppendorf\n\n34\n\nNordland towns\n\n01-50 Beeckerhoven 51-00 Salzenmund\n\n35-45 Nuln (urban) 46-48 Nuln (rural) villages 49\n\nOstermark towns\n\n01-60 Bechafen 61-00 Other Ostermark villages\n\n50-51\n\nOstland towns\n\n01-35 Ferlangen 36-00 Wolfenburg\n\n52-70\n\nReikland towns\n\n01-13 Auerswald 14-30 Bögenhafen 31-42 Dunkelburg 43-50 Grunberg 51-60 Helmgart 61-75 Kemperbad 76-80 Stimmigen 81-90 Ubersreik 91-00 Weissbruck\n\n71-78\n\nStirland towns\n\n01-30 Krugenheim 31-70 Wurtbad 71-00 Other Stirland villages\n\n79-83\n\nSudenland towns\n\n01-35 Pfeildorf 36-60 Wuppertal 61-00 Other Sudenland villages\n\n84\n\nTalabecland towns\n\n01-65 Hergig 66-00 Volgen\n\n85-86 Talabheim (urban) 87 Talabheim (rural) villages 88-00\n\nWissenland towns\n\n01-15 Grissenwald 16-30 Kreutzhofen 31-65 Wissenburg 66-85 Wusterburg 86-00 Other Wissenland villages\n\nKislev 01-35 Erengrad 36-60 Kislev 61-00 Villages near Imperial border\n\nElves[]\n\nElves do not normally come from the same loctions as the other races. Since Player Characters should only be Wood Elves, the potential locations are very limited. Also, Elves do not freely talk about their homelands for fear that this information would be used by an enemy. Therefore, most Elves talk of their home as being 'The Forest'; if pressed - and if they trust the questioner with the information - they might nominate the particular forest, but they will not divulge the name of the actual settlement.\n\nIf an Elven placename is important to you, then use the table given earlier for generating Elven names, following the pattern 'Prefix-PrefixSuffix'. The resulting name may be hyphenated if you wish (as in Terr-Edririel, Far-Farcoral, or Ullialor-Galiel).\n\nTo generate the Forest-homeland randomly, use the following table:\n\nD100 Homeland 01-10 Drak Wald Forest 11-25 The Great Forest 26-35 Reikwald 36-75 Laurelorn 76-80 The Mirror Moors 81-95 Athel-Loren 96-00 Bois Delouere (Bretonnia)\n\nHalflings[]\n\nHalflings are very well integrated into Human society and may be found almost anywhere where Humans settle. However, the importance of the Moot as the Halfling homeland must not be overlooked. Roll on the following table to determine the origins of a Halfling character.\n\nD100 Origin 01-59 The Moot 60-00 Roll on Origins Table 1\n\nGnomes[]\n\nAlmost all Gnomes will be from the main Gnomish community of Glimdwarrow. Those few not from this or one of the minor Gnomish settlements would be from one of the Human settlements.\n\nFamily Background[]\n\nIt might be important to know a character's family background; at least, it always helps characterise a PC. The information and methods in this section are all optional, especially where PCs are concerned. As GM, you should feel free to ignore or amend any results you don't feel comfortable with.\n\nBrothers and Sisters[]\n\nCharacter Race No. of Siblings Age Difference Human D6-11 3D4-3 Elf D6-1 3D10 Dwarf D4-2 2D20 Halfling 2D4-22 2D6-2 Gnome D4-1 2D10\n\nNotes\n\nIf the die roll is 6, roll again and add 4.\n\nIf either die rolls 4, roll again and add 3. If both dice roll 4, roll both again and add 6.\n\nEach sibling has an equal chance of being male or female (except for Dwarfs; each sibling has a 25% chance of being female) and an equal chance of being younger or older than the character. When the age difference is 0, there is a 20% chance that the character is a twin (or triplet, or whatever). Twins, triplets, and other multiple births have a 10% chance of being identical. (With Dwarfs, an age difference of 2 gives a 5% chance that the same-sex sibling is actually the character's twin; identical twins are rare in Dwarfs, and fraternal twins are all but unknown.)\n\nParents[]\n\nRoll a D100 and consult the following table to see if the character's parents are still living:\n\nD100 Parental status 01-25 both parents living 26-45 father dead 46-60 mother dead 61-00 both parents dead\n\nThe older a character is, the more likely it will be that the parents have died. Modify the roll as follows:\n\nHuman: Add 10% for each full 10 years over 20\n\nElf: Add 20% for each full 20 years over 160\n\nDwarf: Add 10% for each full 20 years over 120\n\nHalfling: Add 10% for each full 10 years over 50\n\nGnome: Add 20% for each full 20 years over 100\n\nCheck the following list and roll the relevant dice to determine the age of surviving parents:\n\nHuman: 15 + D6 years older than the oldest child\n\nElf: 60 + D20 years older than the oldest child\n\nDwarf: 60 + 2D10 years older than the oldest child (father); 30 + 2D10 years older than the oldest child (mother)\n\nHalfling: 30 + D10 years older than the oldest child\n\nGnome: 35 + 2D6 years older than the oldest child\n\nIf both parents are dead, roll a D100. On a roll of 95-99, the character was an orhpan, raised by relatives. On a roll of 00, the character was a foundling.\n\nSpouses and Children[]\n\nConsult the following table to see if the character has a family of his or her own (female Dwarfs add 30 to their age):\n\nAge\n\nHuman\n\nElf\n\nDwarf\n\nHalfling\n\nGnome\n\n16-20\n\n30%/25%\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n21-30\n\n60%/55%\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n31-40\n\n80%/75%\n\n-\n\n-\n\n20%/15%\n\n-\n\n41-50\n\n65%/80%\n\n-\n\n-\n\n20%/15%\n\n15%/10%\n\n51-60\n\n40%/75%\n\n10%/5%\n\n-\n\n50%/45%\n\n25%/15%\n\n61-70\n\n20%/60%\n\n25%/15%\n\n5%/2%\n\n65%/60%\n\n45%/30%\n\n71-80\n\n10%/40%\n\n40%/25%\n\n10%/5%\n\n80%/75%\n\n60%/40%\n\n81-90\n\n5%/20%\n\n60%/35%\n\n20%/10%\n\n80%/75%\n\n70%/45%\n\n91-100\n\n-\n\n70%/40%\n\n30%/15%\n\n80%/80%\n\n80%/50%\n\n101-110\n\n-\n\n80%/45%\n\n40%/20%\n\n80%/80%\n\n85%/55%\n\n111-120\n\n-\n\n85%/50%\n\n50%/25%\n\n75%/80%\n\n80%/60%\n\n121-130\n\n-\n\n90%/55%\n\n60%/30%\n\n65%/75%\n\n75%/65%\n\n131-140\n\n-\n\n90%/60%\n\n60%/35%\n\n55%/70%\n\n70%/70%\n\n141-150\n\n-\n\n95%/65%\n\n50%/30%\n\n30%/50%\n\n60%/75%\n\n151-160\n\n-\n\n95%/70%\n\n40%/25%\n\n5%/25%\n\n50%/70%\n\n161-170\n\n-\n\n95%/75%\n\n30%/20%\n\n-\n\n30%/65%\n\n171-180\n\n-\n\n95%/80%\n\n20%/15%\n\n-\n\n5%/35%\n\n181-190\n\n-\n\n95%/85%\n\n10%/10%\n\n-\n\n-\n\n191-200\n\n-\n\n85%/90%\n\n5%/5%\n\n-\n\n-\n\n201-210\n\n-\n\n55%/95%\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n211-220\n\n-\n\n30%/95%\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nThe number before the slash is the percentage chance that the character has a surviving spouse; the number after the slash is the percentage chance that the character has surviving children.\n\nGenerate the number of children using the Brothers and Sisters chart above. The eldest child's age can be found by following the guidelines for generating parents' ages above, taking the character's age as the parent's age and working backwards.\n\nIf you feel like it, you can generate in-laws, aunts, uncles, cousins, and heaven knows what else for several dozen generations with this technique; Halflings in particular are very fond of genealogy, but a good spread of relatives can provide a rich depth of background (and who knows, occasional material assistance) for any character.\n\nThe options above are only going to be used where you want to flesh out a PC's background or develop some ideas about an NPC. Obviously, you will have to sort out any anomalies. But even anomalies can give you insight: consider a 22-year-old male Human, his mother dead, no sisters, no wife - and with 4 kids, the eldest of whom is just one year old. None of the children turn out to be twins, so maybe they are all illegitimate or the man keeps a harem. And maybe this tells you that he has a complete disregard for women, he uses them for pleasure, but has no serious contact with them. What price his two little daughters? And how will a character like that react to a female PC?\n\nFamily Occupation[]\n\nYou can also create careers for the character's family (separate ones for each, if you prefer) by following the notes on creating NPCs. This will tell you the Career Class, final career, and career path of the character's parents and siblings.\n\nUse this information to give extra colour to your characters - perhaps mother was a Wizard, even though father was nothing more than a simple Entertainer. Or it might lead to a Roadwarden who is the brother of a Poacher! Coming up with stories to explain that can not only create more interesting characters, but can also give you ideas for adventures.\n\nYou might even like to determine occupations for any siblings or other relatives, if you wish - if one parent was an Artisan, at least one child will probably follow into the family business, but otherwise you have a free choice.\n\nDwarf Family/Clan Occupation[]\n\nAs Dwarf clans (except for some Expatriates) are matrilineal, a Dwarf normally follows the same craft as his mother's clan, which is the same as that of the character. There is a 75% chance that a Dwarf's father will belong to the same craftguild. For the 25% of fathers who are different, use the Basic Career Tables to determine the starting basic career of the father and his clan.\n\nExpatriate Dwarfs do not follow the same strict traditions regarding clans and crafts. The starting basic careers of an Expatriate Dwarf's family may vary widely, and if required, they can be determined using the Basic Career Tables."
