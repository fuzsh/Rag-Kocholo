She left Germany for good to live in London in October 1934.\n\nContents\n\n1 Training, and first recitals with Nikisch\n\n2 London, Europe, Russia, and USA before 1914\n\n3 The First World War\n\n4 Between the wars\n\n5 Wartime recitals in England\n\n6 Late career\n\n7 Recordings\n\n8 Notes\n\n9 Sources\n\n10 External links\n\nTraining, and first recitals with Nikisch\n\nElena Gerhardt was born at Connewitz near Leipzig, the daughter of a Leipzig restaurateur. She studied at the Leipzig Conservatory from 1899 to 1903, first with Professor Carl Rebling and then with Marie Hedmondt (d. 1941), who remained her friend and vocal adviser for many years. After a year of only technical study, she began work on operatic roles, such as Cherubino, Dorabella, the Mignon of Ambroise Thomas and Hermann Goetz's Katharina, interspersed with Lieder. She won the Carl Reinecke Scholarship. Leipzig provided many opportunities to hear international artists and to hear the early masters.\n\nIn 1902, Arthur Nikisch became director of the Leipzig Conservatory, and approved her to sing publicly in Leipzig, which she first did in November 1902: he also gave her a solo in Franz Liszt's \"Choruses from Herder's Entfesseltem Prometheus\" (S. 69). On graduating in 1903 and with many engagements, she mentioned her wish to give a lieder recital, and Nikisch offered to be her accompanist, their first (victorious) performance being at the Kaufhaus in Leipzig on her twentieth birthday. Concert engagements poured in, and she sang lieder in almost every university town as supporting artist to names such as Eugène Ysaÿe, Teresa Carreño or Max Reger. By 1905 she made her first appearances (with Nikisch) in Hamburg and Berlin (the Bechsteinhall), and in Berlin made the friendship of Richard Strauss. From summer 1905 she spent holidays with the Nikisch family near Ostend.\n\nLondon, Europe, Russia, and USA before 1914\n\nGerhardt first appeared at the Leipzig Opera as Mignon, in June 1905, and also performed Charlotte in Massenet's Werther there, under Nikisch, being coached by his student Albert Coates as Korrepetitor. Nikisch arranged and accompanied her 1906 London debut, first in a Mischa Elman concert, and then in a Lieder recital (songs of Schubert, Schumann, Brahms, Wolf, etc.) at the Bechstein Hall. In April 1907 she first sang at the Royal Albert Hall, with an orchestra under Nikisch. Thereafter she returned to England annually until 1914 for autumn seasons, including regular tours of the provinces with Hamilton Harty or her loyal accompanist Paula Hegner.\n\nThe partnership with Nikisch was preserved in two series of records made in 1907 and 1911, made in Berlin. A particular triumph was their appearance in the 1908 season of the Philharmonic Society in London. She sang by invitation to entertain royal guests to the Coronation of George V and Queen Mary in 1911. Nikisch introduced her into the highest circles, including the Villa Wahnfried. She sang in many European capitals - Vienna, Budapest, Prague, Copenhagen, Christiania (Oslo) - and with old musical Societies at Cologne and Frankfurt, annually in Paris and London, and under Mengelberg at The Hague. Nikisch usually accompanied the first Lieder concert at each centre, after which other accompanists took over. Alexander Siloti arranged her first visit to Russia (to Moscow) in 1909, and until the War she sang there and in St Petersburg.\n\nGerhardt made her American debut at the Carnegie Hall in January 1912, with Paula Hegner, and was then in Cincinnati and Philadelphia with Leopold Stokowski (singing the Wesendonck Lieder), and with the Boston Symphony Orchestra under Max Fiedler, before finally combining there with Nikisch and the London Symphony Orchestra tour. In London in 1912 she performed the Angel in Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius, a role more associated with her 'rival' and friend Julia Culp. Her second American tour was in early 1913, opening with the Boston Symphony under Karl Muck, and with Erich J. Wolff as accompanist, who died during the tour. They visited Boston, New York, Baltimore, Washington and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Next season she sang in Paris, Moscow, Scandinavia, Hungary, Austria, Holland, Italy, Scotland and England, culminating in London in July 1914 at the Queen's Hall under Richard Strauss - her last appearance there for eight years.\n\nQuick NOTE ON GRADING AND SHIPPING:\n\nAs you can see from my feedback, I try hard to earn your POSITIVE FEEDBACK and FIVE STAR RATINGS.\n\nIf for any reason your transaction was NOT SATISFACTORY, pls contact me and I will work something out with you. YOU WILL NEVER HAVE A REASON TO GIVE ME A NEGATIVE RATING or a LOW STAR RATING.\n\nQuick note on grading:\n\nThe Grade (Excellent to Fair, I don't give Mint) refers to the WEAR of the record. Any other defects are stated separately, when prefaced with \"HOWEVER\" or \"BUT\" they will be significant.\n\nWhen I listen to a record, I may also give it an aural grade (again E to F), and make a SUBJECTIVE judgment of the pressing quality for hiss and surface noise.\n\n\"SUPERQUIET\" is basically noiseless, like a vinyl pressing.\n\n\"VERY QUIET\" is an exceptionally quiet record for a given pressing.\n\n\"Quiet\" is a record that is a great example without undue noise for a given pressing.\n\nThese judgments are SUBJECTIVE and will depend one the styli, phonograph etc. you use on your own equipment.\n\nPls check my other auctions for more great records and phonograph items:\n\nhttp://shop.ebay.com/carsten_sf/m.html\n\nhttp://shop.ebay.com/carsten_sf/m.html\n\n====\n\nMultiple item shipping: I am happy to combine items for shipment in one parcel.\n\nIf you win multiple items, pls send me an INVOICE REQUEST to calculate the correct postage.

Up to about 5 records, I will ship Edison Discs for the same rates. Estimate count for Album Sets as number of records plus 1 record. I have a great track record for sending LARGE PARCELS of records safely\n\n1 record: 4.75$\n\n2 records: 5.75$\n\n5 records: 7.50$\n\n10 records: 9.50$\n\nMANY MORE RECORDS: Don't worry. I safely ship 40 - 50 pounds of records double boxed in moving boxes, and even then Media Mail will probably not exceed 30$.\n\nThe numbers above include the 9% Ebay fee on shipments.\n\nPls ignore the automatically calculated prices on the ebay site, as I will weigh every parcel and charge based on actual weight.\n\nPlease send me a message if you would like to lower your shipping rates!\n\nInternational Buyers:\n\nAll'attenzione degli acquirenti italiani:\n\nATTENTION TO ITALIAN BUYERS:\n\nDue to rare problems with delivery in ITALY, I will NOT GUARANTEE delivery of parcels sent by US Postal Service First Class and Priority Mail.
