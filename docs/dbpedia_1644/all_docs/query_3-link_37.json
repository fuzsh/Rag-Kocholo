        "text": "‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an employer‚Äôs worst nightmare.‚Äù When someone said this to me recently, it took me by surprise. I didn‚Äôt fully understand what the person meant at the time it was said. But from what I gathered, I believe the person meant it in a way that relates to the fact that I speak my mind. I‚Äôm not shy to share my thoughts. If speaking up about: - My experiences in the workplace - My experiences as a parent and carer - The lack of workplace flexibility - How the workplace doesn‚Äôt do enough to support working parents and carers - that many employers claim they‚Äôre inclusive, but don‚Äôt provide flexibility Then yeah, I‚Äôm an ‚Äúemployer‚Äôs worst nightmare.‚Äù ü§∑üèº‚ôÇÔ∏è But a few years back, before I was a dad and a carer, I was many employer‚Äôs dream hire due to my skillset and talents. When I needed support in terms of workplace flexibility, attitudes changed towards me. My career paused when I became a parent and carer in 2021 because I couldn‚Äôt get the flexibility I needed. I made the natural decision to look after my family during a time they needed me. I have used LinkedIn as a platform to voice my journey, experiences, setbacks, and successes. With the goal of making the workplace better so that others don‚Äôt have to experience what my family and I have. If you‚Äôre following me on LinkedIn, you can decide for yourself if you like who I am and what I do. But I say this with confidence: I like who I am and what I do. And that‚Äôs what matters most to me. I‚Äôll continue advocating for all things workplace flexibility until I‚Äôm no longer needed. Do you feel you‚Äôve had your career paused because of parenting and caring needs? P.S. This is a photo of me nearly 5 years ago (a few months before the covid lockdown, when I had to work from home‚Ä¶)\n\nI‚Äôm the kind of person who cries (with joy) when someone calls to cancel a social engagement. And I know I‚Äôm not the only one! As I‚Äôve got older, neurodiversity has become a ‚Äòthing‚Äô in my life. It was always there of course, but having spent years thinking I was just an anti-social bint; I‚Äôve come to realise that my brain just fires a bit differently. And that‚Äôs OK. I know my limits, and I don‚Äôt expect anything more of myself. I fully accept my day goes more smoothly, with less (or no) face-to-face interactions. And noise ‚Äì sheesh, I really can‚Äôt deal with noise when I‚Äôm working. At home, it‚Äôs silent ‚Äì no radio, no podcast, no washing machine ‚Äì just the occasional time when I want to throw something at the bloke with the leaf blower. It‚Äôs bliss for me, and I get a lot done. Occasionally, I need to be in the office, but they‚Äôre an understanding lot ‚Äì and have figured out they get more from me by allowing me to work in my own unique way, rather than forcing me into a position where I find it uncomfortable to work. It‚Äôs often strikes me as odd to be working in recruitment. I spend a lot of time on the phone to candidates and we build a lovely rapport, have a laugh and I genuinely, hand on heart enjoy speaking with them. But I feel pretty drained at the end of the day. My daughter said to me recently that her ‚Äòsocial battery was drained‚Äô after she‚Äôd come back from a day with friends. I think it was a bit of youthful tongue in cheek, but it really summarises how I feel. I do literally have to recharge that battery before I feel like speaking to anyone again. So, why am I telling you this? There‚Äôs a couple of things I want to draw attention to as it‚Äôs #MentalHealth awareness week. One is to employers ‚Äì please make allowances for people who struggle to work in an office or on-site environment. It‚Äôs not that they don‚Äôt want to, it‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs a massive challenge to get through a day, only to find that very little has been accomplished at the end of it. Look out for employees who may be suffering and encourage them to come and talk to you, see if there are ways in which you can support them to be their best. The other is to say ‚Äì be kind. Not only to others, but to yourself. If you feel you need to make some adjustments in your work life and you are struggling to cope, go and speak to someone. They won‚Äôt always notice you‚Äôre struggling; they may put it down to poor performance or lack of commitment ‚Äì so for the sake of your own well-being and mental health, speak to your line manager or someone In HR who can help you. Nobody should be struggling in today‚Äôs society. As we all become more aware of the vast and varying metal health issues that people are suffering with, and our knowledge and understanding becomes greater, we‚Äôre in a fantastic position to celebrate all the great things people can achieve, when they are encouraged and allowed to do so in a way that works for them. And don‚Äôt even get me started on the peri-menopause‚Ä¶..\n\n**Navigating Workplace Anxiety: A Millennial's Reflection** Sunday evenings have a peculiar way of stirring a blend of emotions within us, especially as we stand at the threshold of another week in the corporate maze. This phenomenon, often referred to as the \"Sunday Scaries,\" is a shared experience among many of us navigating the millennial corporate journey. It's that knot in the stomach, the restless mind forecasting the week's challenges, the silent wish for a slower clock. Why does this resonate so deeply with our generation? Perhaps it's the echo of our relentless pursuit for perfection, the weight of expectations to outperform, or the delicate dance of juggling career aspirations with personal fulfillment. The workplace isn't just a physical space anymore; it's a mental arena where anxiety often holds a seat at the table. In my own journey, I've found that addressing this anxiety is less about silencing it and more about understanding it. Embracing open conversations about mental health at work has been a game changer. It's about building a culture where it's not just okay but encouraged to say, \"Hey, I'm struggling,\" or \"I need a moment.\" As we continue to navigate our careers, let's redefine what success looks like. It's not just the achievements on our resumes but also the courage to prioritize our mental health, to build workplaces that are not just productive but compassionate, and to remember that our well-being is the foundation on which our professional lives should be built.\n\nEver wondered what it truly means to forge your own path? During this Social Work Month, I'm reminded of the path that has led me to where I am today. A social worker, consultant, and startup founder dedicated to creating positive change in the world of mental health and wellness. I started off in social work, ready to make a difference and help others in any way I could. But as much as I loved what I was doing, I couldn't shake this feeling that there was something more out there for me. As I navigated the landscape of social work, I began to feel a longing for something more. I‚Äôve always had a desire to innovate, and to create change on a broader scale that also included providing new avenues for empowering others. This sparked the beginning of a new chapter in my journey. I then ventured into corporate wellness consulting, seeking to merge my love for social work with my fascination for holistic well-being in the workplace. In this new role, I discovered the power of blending traditional principles of social work with innovative approaches to wellness, fostering resilience and vitality in workplaces across industries. Then later with a bunch of crazy ideas and a whole lot of determination(slightly delulu) and driven by a deep rooted commitment to mental well-being, I embarked on a bold new venture, a startup dedicated to transforming the way we approach mental health in the workplace. With each step forward, I found myself embracing the challenges, the uncertainties, and the exhilarating possibilities of entrepreneurship. Anyways, I say all that to say, I am filled with gratitude for every twist and turn that has led me to where I am now as a social worker. A founder, a visionary, a champion for mental well-being. My path may have been unconventional, but it has been uniquely mine and a testament to how powerful following our passions, embracing change, and forging our own paths in pursuit of our dreams can be. & To my fellow social workers: Happy Social Work Month !!!! Thank you for your advocacy, your unwavering compassion, and your dedication to the field of Social Work. #SocialWorkMonth #ChangeMakers\n\n‚ÄòNah, I‚Äôm not feeling it today, I‚Äôm gonna come in at 10.30am.‚Äô Oscar-winning actor Jodie Foster clearly doesn't rate #GenZ, that she describes as 'really annoying, especially in the workplace.' Gen Z‚Äôs approach to work has been widely discussed in the media, and Foster's comments met with criticism on social media. A popular post from 27-year old Robbie Scott on #TikTok caught the Gen-Z mood. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre staying in school. We‚Äôre going to college. We‚Äôve been working since we were 15, 16 years old‚Ä¶doing everything that y‚Äôall told us to do, so that we can what? Still be living in our parents‚Äô homes in our late twenties?‚Äù For Gen-Z and younger Millennial workers, the pressure to work hard is still there, but the payoff no longer is. How can they find value in their work? Enter the #softlife. BlueSky Thinking looks at this trend, where Gen-Z are leaning toward roles that promote flexibility, wellbeing and autonomy, and shying away from the traditional 9 to 5. With work-related stress levels at a record high - 83% in the US according to a #Gallup 2023 State of the Global Workforce - Cassie Holmes, Sanford DeVoe and Colin West from UCLA Anderson School of Management encourage employers to adopt a 'vacation mindset' to help promote relaxation, rejuvenation, personal fulfillment, and interpersonal connection. Another great BlueSky Thinking read, with advice on how both employees and organisations can find a successful 'soft life' solution #management #careers #worklife #wellbeing https://lnkd.in/dMdPWr_G\n\nTo anyone with 10-40+ years of work ahead, this is for you. Passionately reject these 3 things: 1/ Hustle culture and toxic individualism ‚Ü≥ this lifestyle leaves no time for building connections in your community 2/ The 9-5 commuter cyborg existence ‚Ü≥ we can‚Äôt operate at 100%, 100% of the time ‚Äî we know what empty and burnt out looks like 3/ Implicit corporate distractions ‚Ü≥ mental health benefits aren‚Äôt always what they seem ‚Äî they can highlight the pervasive dissatisfaction for corporate life (a bandaid!) Passionately embrace these 3 things: 1/ Community connections ‚Ü≥ ‚ÄúStrong-loose‚Äù ties will literally add years to your life 2/ Leisure time ‚Ü≥ your ability to be productive is finite ‚Äî embrace this reality! 3/ Forcing ‚ÄúCorporate America‚Äù to embrace a new ideology ‚Ü≥ say no to working for inflexible companies, so they become relics faster! Embracing flexible work is not just about a desire for convenience‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs about the pursuit of a more balanced, fulfilling life for millions and millions of people worldwide. The movement we are experiencing is a call for companies to reconsider their views on work itself. The Future of Work is not about work‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs about a happier and more connected world outside of the workplace.

Research by Ending Loneliness Together found one in three Australians feel lonely at any given time and that 41% of people aged 18 to 24 are persistently lonely. This year's theme is understanding why we feel lonely and experts on LinkedIn have marked the occasion by encouraging conversations. Career development expert Bernie McFarlane said Loneliness Awareness Week was a good reminder for workers to think about the quality of their relationships with colleagues and their wider professional network. \"I encourage you to pay attention to the people around you at work, and think about reaching out to others more intentionally. Wellbeing isn't just the responsibility of HR or your manager. We are all human and can look out for each other, whatever our job title,\" she writes. In a LinkedIn post, organisational psychologist John Chan, Ph.D. urged workplaces to address the problem of loneliness. \"By doing so, not only will it benefit individuals, but organisations will also be rewarded with a healthier and more productive workforce,\" he writes.

Are we making it easier for young generation to start their professional journey? I would like to think so but we have a long road ahead. A long time associate reached out to me a few months back and asked to meet - while we have been exchanging regular b‚Äôday and employment anniversary wishes, we hadn‚Äôt met in a long while. As we met over coffee, and exchanged pleasantries, she all of a sudden mentioned that it was because of me she was still working & she was so grateful about it. It took me moment to gather myself - I asked her to elaborate. It so turned out that she had decided to quit after she had her 2nd kid & I had asked her not to quit and instead do WFH. She said facilitating WFH in those days when it was unheard of, was a life saver for her. I obviously felt good for her while feeling amazed at how valuable that gesture on my part turned out to be. And then I recently had a kid of mine starting in sales (field sales) role - she being the only female in the entire sales workforce in her company. Here is what she faced & is facing - 1. Trying to find an apartment on rent - while she was looking for 1BHK, everyone asked if she is to live alone or with husband. No apartments were coming forth. Once it was realized of the problem, she had to pivot to seeking 2BHK apartment (even though it was an unnecessary extra expense to her) stating that she will be staying with her parents. 2. Then she was asked her full name - it was quite obvious that ppl were assessing her caste to make up their mind whether to consider her for giving the apartment or not. 3. In her role there are 26 men reporting to her. These men are trying to figure out as to why shall they be reporting to a woman. 4. The whole work culture is around working late evenings/nights Good news is, if she can crack this despite all this, then there is no looking back for her. Bad news is, I as a parent am a nervous wreck about her safety. But then this is what I wished for her all my life - to be an independent woman of her own. And now that she is, am I being overly worried? It was also a reminder how privileged we are and how difficult it would be for anyone with modest means to start her career in a similar situation. #safeworking #inclusiveness #inclusivity #genderdiversity #diversity"
