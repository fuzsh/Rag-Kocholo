        "text": "Can I get your help if you work in B2B marketing? It's the final business day of the month so I'm here on LinkedIn begging and pleaded for a handful of you to go signup for Exit Five (we have a goal we're trying to beat this month, again). If you are not familiar with Exit Five: • We've built the # 1 private community for B2B marketing pros • Exit Five exists to help you grow your skills and advance your career in B2B marketing • It's not about likes/virality like LinkedIn; people join to get help and answers from a curated group that they are not getting here • There's 2 years of history to search through, so if you have a question about B2B marketing (tools, tech, agencies, vendors, rant about your boss) it's probably in there • Circle calls communities like ours \"Platinum Communities\" because they have the highest engagement, lowest churn, and are thriving. • Now 4,205 members • 40% monthly active users • Dozens of new discussions every day • Messages from members about how this community has changed the trajectory of their career in some way or another Go hit the Exit Five website NOW and you can join us in the community (for free to start for 7 days so no sweat for you to try it out and poke around). The link is: exitfive.com Trying to put these 170,000 followers to work and show my team followers is not a vanity metric 😉 Can we get some more Exit Five trials?\n\nWe have bootstrapped a 7 figure media company and one of the most important tools in our tech stack is our events/webinar platform. For the last few months we've been using Zuddl. We can use it for ticketing for our in-person event (we sold out 200 tickets to Drive which is coming up in 2 weeks and we're running the whole event through Zuddl). We also use it to power our webinar program. SHOOT I mean \"live session\" program (don't you dare call them webinars). We do these 2x/month and we get 500 - 1,000 B2B marketers registered. It's a great solution that allows us to promote, manage, and host our events (both live and virtual). But it’s clear it was designed for B2B marketers who need to create landing pages, registration flows, checkout pages, coupon codes, and prove the ROI to your boss. Luckily I am the boss, so I don't need to worry about the ROI but I just ask Dan about it. Anyway: we told Zuddl we'd talk about how great their event platform was if it really stood up to the test and we've been super happy using it for all of our events (in-person and virtual) at Exit Five. Thanks to the crew at Zuddl for sponsoring Exit Five; hopefully this post gets you a new lead or two 😉 Just keep our direct line for feedback open and we can continue to do good things together. We have lots of ideas to help B2B marketers run their events. PS. 13 days until Drive. 13 days! I can't WAIT to hang out with my Exit Five team for the first time in-person and see ~200 members of the Exit Five community here in beautiful Burlington, VT. It's really happening!!\n\nIt is so refreshing to work with a team that doesn't gossip, doesn't grumble, there aren't big sighs or groans when you ask someone to do part of their job. Maybe it's from working in tech for the last decade but when the market was really good (looking back now) I think it made a lot of people complacent. There was this feeling if \"you can't ask me to do more than what I'm expected to do\" because I can just leave and go find another job. There was an attitude of \"you should be thanking me for working at this company\" vs being happy to have a job that pays well and offers meaningful work. Some of this rebalancing is good. And I'm lucky to work with a team at Exit Five right now that doesn't gossip, doesn't groan or grumble, and they are happy to have jobs here. Now, it could all go to shit, I could become a terrible boss, and this could all flip on me. But right now, I'm saying this because I'm feeling this. Pressure is on to keep it that way.\n\nNEW by popular demand: We're launching an 8 week B2B Marketing Leadership Accelerator (Online). This an online training for aspiring B2B marketing leaders (or current leaders who want to stay sharp heading into Q4). We've built Exit Five into the # 1 community for B2B marketers, but beyond the community we've been getting a bunch of demand for something like this. Call it a course, call it a cohort. We're calling it the B2B Marketing Leadership Accelerator. Starts on October 3rd and runs until November 21. Each session will be live at a pre-set time during the week, plus recorded for participants. You’ll be able to join live and ask questions to our guest speakers. And, we’ll provide templates and resources to accompany each learning session so you walk away with a lifetime resource. On top of that, you’ll have a private community space exclusively for members of our Accelerator Program to ask follow-up questions to speakers, meet each other, network, share ideas, get recommendations, feedback, and more during our 8-week program. At the end of the program, you'll receive a certificate from us that you can showcase on LinkedIn and your resume if you want. We’re opening up the course publicly after Drive on Sept 12, but if you join the waitlist today, we’ll let you know a day before everyone else, and send you exclusive discounted pricing (available only for 24 hours). Put your name on the waiting list here: https://lnkd.in/eY64UaAg Oh and check out the full agenda of topics and speaker list in the image below. Here are the topics we're going to cover: • Session 1: How To Build Your 2025 Marketing Plan • Session 2: How to Create and Manage a Marketing Budget • Session 3: Building Alignment Between Sales and Marketing • Session 4: A Positioning Framework to Help You Differentiate • Session 5: How to Use Social to Build Brand and Drive Pipeline • Session 6: How to Build a Team and Hire • Session 7: How to Work with Other Executives,Sales, and the CEO • Session 8: Marketing Metrics You Should Know and How To Report on Them I'd tag all of our speakers but LinkedIn does not like that. Put your name on the waiting list and we'll see you at the Accelerator!\n\nWhat do you think ... are we about to see a wave of hiring in tech?? There's been a small bump in jobs posted around our community the last few weeks and I hope this trend continues. Here's a great new job that just opened up: • Product Marketing Manager at Freshpaint • Remote • $125k - $165k Freshpaint was founded by web analytics veterans who realized how hard it was for highly regulated companies to collect and use customer data in a compliant way. They started as part of Y Combinator’s S19 cohort and have been focused on enabling healthcare companies collect, safeguard, and activate patient data since. As a Product Marketing Manager at Freshpaint, you will play a crucial role in driving expansion into adjacent markets, working closely with strategic teams to identify and enter new verticals. You'll be employee # 60-70 ish so it's an established company but still with that startup feeling -- so get ready to get things done fast and make a big impact. They also offer a bunch of benefits, like: • Competitive compensation with generous, employee-friendly equity. They have a 10-year exercise window. • Freshpaint Fridays: Half-day Fridays. Every week. • Unlimited PTO, with a minimum requirement of 2 weeks per year. Plus various observed holidays. • 100% remote • Flex in-office if you want with $150 WeWork credits each month • 401k • Health, dental, and vision insurance 100% covered by the company (some states it’s 99% because laws). • Mental health benefits - therapy appointments and more covered by the company • 2 Treat Yourself Days per year: They pay you $100 to take a day off and do whatever makes you happy. The only catch is you have to share what you did with the rest of the team. • Generous parental leave • Paid Spotify • Health & Wellness benefit – gym membership or similar covered • Regular team offsites 2-4 times per year. They’ve been to Greece, Jackson Hole, Cabo, Santa Fe, California wine country, and Mexico City in the recent past. And most importantly: Ownership of your work, collaboration with a close team, and direct access to founders and what it’s like to build a startup. If you leave to start your own company, the founders want to be your first angel investors. Anyway, check out this role and learn more here via the Exit Five job board: https://lnkd.in/evPMs5_q And thanks to VP Marketing Ray Mina for posting this job with us and leading the marketing team here.\n\nThe best thing I ever did: hire a team to help build Exit Five with me. Having a team extinguished my burnout and gave me a bunch of new energy. It's also change my role from \"B2B marketing hot take thought leader guy\" to \"founder, entrepreneur, guy who is building a real company.\" I am building new muscles. Learning. Stretching myself. Getting better!! It was too easy working solo. There were no stakes, no pressure. Now there's a pressure of having to grow, to keep everyone well paid, to keep producing, to evolve, to find the next growth lever. Talked about how my role with Exit Five has evolved since bringing on a team this year, going from a one person business to five with Danielle Messler on the E5 podcast.\n\nDoes your company have a blog? How is that blog driving revenue? Do you know? Read this... Your company blog should have a seat at the revenue table. But that's not the norm since blogs are typically held has hard(er) to measure in B2B, and many companies us the blog as a catchall for all types of content. It's where press releases and other random topics; or the place where you write TOFU fluffy listicles to try and grab search traffic. Both of those options are self-serving and don’t really provide value to your audience or to the marketing and sales teams -- and ultimately don't end up driving revenue (surprising, I know). But content marketers can find themselves forced into creating blogs like those because they are easier to “justify” - we wrote about the latest feature, so check product marketing off the list. Or we brought in more traffic ... brand marketing target hit for the month. Or XYZ department needed us to write an article so we did. The result? No results other than a busy content team. If you want to turn your B2B blog into a revenue machine, you should check out this resource from HockeyStack. They have built a library of templates designed to help you improve your marketing and they have created a GREAT resource for Content Marketers. It's a Blog Vitals Dashboard and helps you understand: • What blog posts contribute to revenue • Blog entrances that book a demo in the future • Self-reported attribution that mentions “blog” • Blog posts that resonate most, by company And you can use this Dashboard to: • Measure blog content’s contribution to revenue • Give content a seat at the revenue table • Automatically organize self-attribution that mentions blog Here's the link to get this Blog Vitals Dashboard from HockeyStack: https://lnkd.in/eh9cWQVV Note: HockeyStack is an Exit Five sponsor.\n\nIt's over. My kids go back to school this week. And that signals the end of summer. But I'm excited. Strangely. It's weird to be excited about work again, who have I become?? I'm excited because we have a BIG stretch coming up at Exit Five through the rest of the year. 1. Drive - our first annual in-person event. The gathering the community has been asking me about for two years. It's finally happening. 2 weeks. 200 marketers will make their way to Burlington, VT. 2. Launching our CMO Club (sub community for marketing leaders) 3. Launching our B2B Marketing Accelerator (8 week learning program covering the core areas you need to master to be an affective marketing leader) 4. Launching our first virtual event (The Ultimate Roast of B2B marketing) 5. Strong inbound demand for sponsorship opportunities from some top B2B SaaS companies like Calendly, Fiverr, Navattic, UserEvidence, Hockey Stack, Knak, Apollo, PharosIQ, Zuddl. 6. Two great partners in No Boring Design (design/brand work) and Hatch FM (podcast production) 7. A team of five full-time teammates all fully ramped up making a noticeable different on our business (and we're starting to build some chemistry) 8. Finally meeting the Exit Five team all in-person at Drive 9. Opening up our first full-time sales/account management role 10. Then we're heading down to Austin in November for an Exit Five Off Site to do a little team bonding (maybe a trust fall or two) and plan 2025. Maybe we'll also host an Exit Five meet-up in Austin while where there? Anyone interested? PS. I love my kids. Summer is an awesome time of year to be home with them and we had a great time. But I'm also excited for them to get back in the school routine. It's good for everyone :) And just a quick shoutout to our Exit Five team. You'd be hard pressed to find a team of five capable of such high quality output at this speed. They are plugged into the feedback loop and it's showing. We're building the # 1 community for B2B marketers. Follow along here with me on LinkedIn."
