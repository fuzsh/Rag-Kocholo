        "text": "A note about the tunings:\n\nTunings listed here are accurate, but remember that they are relative and may not be at concert pitch. For example, I usually tune my six string guitar down one half step (E=E flat, etc.) but still refer to the tunings as if they were at concert pitch.

These should get you pretty close. Please note that on the 12 string pieces “Malaika” and “Isa Lei” the guitar is in drop D but pitched at B or thereabout. On “Shallow Brown” and “Homage” I’m using a Weissenborn style guitar which is played lap style. You can get most of the stuff if you play slide in a conventional manner with a little practice. Thanks for your interest and good luck!\n\n1. Tennessee: DADGAD (Down 1/2 step, capo 2)\n\n2. Malaika: DADGBE (D=B)\n\n3. Great Dream From Heaven: DADGBE (Down 1/2 step, capo 2)\n\n4.
