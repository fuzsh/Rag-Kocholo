        "text": "The elegant Swedish tenor Nicolai Gedda is no longer a fixture at the Metropolitan, where he is a veteran of hundreds of performances over the past quarter century; nowadays his specialty in New York is to show up for Carnegie Hall concert performances of rare operas, in which he gives singing lessons to everyone within hearing. Mr. Gedda also holds the distinction of being the world's most-recorded tenor, and at 58 he shows no sign of ceding that title. His newest major project has been a large-scale survey of his homeland's art song literature, modeled on Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau's comprehensive traversals of the German. These records are produced by the Swedish Bluebell label and distributed here by Polygram Special Imports. So far eight installments have appeared, and the most interesting is the latest, Bell 151, which concentrates on composers active in the early and mid- 19th century.\n\nThe New Grove Dictionary calls Franz Berwald ''the most individual and commanding musical personality Sweden has yet produced,'' and though that reputation rests primarily on the composer's symphonies, it is sustained handsomely and excitingly by the pair of songs included here, including an evocation of the Baltic's swirling waters (''Ostersj\"on'') that is worthy of Schubert in its harmonic and rhythmic propulsiveness within a strophic form. There are also notable songs by Erik Gustaf Geijer, a poet, historian, philosopher and influential member of the Swedish Parliament, who combined a winning folklike melodic gift with ornamental Bellinian cantilena, and by the Schumann-influenced August S\"oderman, whose attractive cycle of Heine settings contains many old friends in new Swedish guise (''Det var i Maj, den sk\"ona Maj'' is ''Im wundersch\"onen Monat Mai,'' the poem that opens Schumann's ''Dichterliebe,'' and cognates pop out here and there to help the alert lieder-lover identify the rest).\n\nAlso in the series are songs of Wilhelm Stenhammar, whose quartets and orchestral music are currently attracting a new and enthusiastic following (Bell 147); a particularly haunting collection by the undervalued 20th-century Swede Gunnar de Frumerie with texts by the Pulitzer- winning playwright P\"ar Lagerkvist (Bell 127); and two-disk anthologies of the central Romantic lyricists Wilhelm Peterson-Berger (Bell 121-2) and Emil Sj\"ogren (Bell 141-2).\n\nAlmost all of this material is sung with a freshness and ease that might easily be attributed to a tenor 20 years younger. Mr. Gedda can still take a sudden octave leap to a high B-flat and then diminish it as though it were no more inconvenient to sing than any other note in his range - which also extends to baritonal- sounding low A's and B's. And he still sings with the vividness of delivery that can seem to turn the recorder- player into television, so clearly does one ''hear'' the facial expressions implicit in the singing.\n\nThe records as presently sold in the stores lack English translations - a drawback that would normally be so severe as to bar recommendation - but the Swedish producers and the American importers say that text leaflets are in the works (Bell 147 and 151 are being held off United States shelves until these are ready, in fact), and the Swedish concern has indicated readiness to send the inserts free of charge to anyone who has bought the records without: Firma Frank Hedman, Ankdammsgatan 13, 171 43 Solna, Sweden. Devotees of song and singing should not pass these up: They are a splendid way, at once adventurous and retrospective, for a much-loved singer nearing the end of a long career to complete his recorded legacy.\n\nThe accompanist throughout is Mr. Gedda's longtime collaborator Jan Eyron, a pianist of distinction and unusual rhythmic presence. Much of the impact of ''Ostersj\"on'' comes from his virtuosic treatment of the piano part, and some of the Sj\"ogren songs that go limp under soprano Elisabeth S\"oderstr\"om in an earlier recording are all flex and spring here.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
