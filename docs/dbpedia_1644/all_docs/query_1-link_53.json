        "text": "The bust is dated 1928, while Clara Schumann died in 1896; it seems unlikely to be of her, though I suppose a posthumous likeness is just possible.\n\nThe Ada Lewis suggested as artist defeats me at the moment. Are we talking about an amateur work by Ada Lewis, later Lewis-Hill (nee Davis), the hugely generous benefactor of the Royal Academy of Music? If so, it is an even more unlikely suggestion, as she died in 1906. See https://bit.ly/2YX0HfR.\n\nThe monogram/signature looks more like 'AT' to me than 'AL'. I don't know how he signed, but Albert Toft's work of the 20s & 30s seems similar.\n\nMartin, you can find a close-up of it (which I attach) if you scroll through the images of the bust on Art UK, others of which give further views of the whole sculpture. This is normal for the sculptures now appearing on Art UK, and I am very grateful that the decision was made to do this - would that it had been possible to do the same with the signatures on our paintings.\n\n1 attachment\n\n1928-bust-monogram-detail.jpg (129 KB)\n\nToo much hair for Gertrude Stein, I think: look at the side view (attached 1).\n\nI agree that Toft's signature seems to be generally in full, though the form varies. Could he, I wonder, have briefly experimented with a monogram in the 1920s? Some of his signatures play around with a combined top-stroke of 't' and 'T' â see attached 2 for examples from 1904, 1913 & 1938. And there are hints of a liking for bold horizontal flourishes to letters in his relief of Henry Irving (attached 3) that remind me of the bottom of the 'T' on our one. I admit it's unlikely, though.\n\n3 attachments\n\n1-ram-unknown-sitter.jpg (91 KB)\n\n2-1904-13-38-signatures.jpg (376 KB)\n\n3-henry-irving-by-toft.jpg (315 KB)\n\nThis looks very plausible to me, James. Elena must have had a relationship with the RAM, as they have a lieder prize named after her. Attached is composite with two earlier profile(ish) images of her from the Library of Congress collection (https://bit.ly/2H7Dt0w) that looks promising. In the second (c.1920-25) it is encouraging to see she has started sweeping her hair back hard into a bun.\n\nIf it is her, then Martinâs query about the nationality of the sculptor is very relevant â in 1928 Gerhardt was based in Germany. She was then aged 45.\n\n1 attachment\n\nprofile-comparison.jpg (207 KB)\n\nShould it turn out that this bust is of Elena Gerhardt, it might be worth noting that although, as Osmund has mentioned above, she was based in Germany in 1928, she appeared in London several times during that year, and especially at the Queen's Hall, in November of that year, for a series of four Schubert Centenary concerts. During that same year she recorded for HMV the Schubert Centenary album consisting of seven 12\" and one 10\" records, containing eight items from \"Winterreise\", and ten other songs. A decent biographical outline of her life can be found here:\n\nhttps://bit.ly/2z0lrc8\n\nShe moved to London after the Nazis came to power in Germany in 1934, and took up a teaching position at the Guildhall School of Music, becoming a British citizen after the end of the Second World War. In 1953, Methuen published her autobiography, entitled \"Recital\". She died at her home in Hampstead, aged 77, in January 1961.\n\nA 1919 drawing by Leistner (attached) shows a similar treatment of the hair and the placid, thought-filled facial expression. This might even be a drawing of Eva Gerhardt.\n\nhttps://www.zvab.com/kunst-grafik-poster/Leistner-Albrecht-Damenbildnis/16811875781/bd\n\nAlso, both singer and artist were based in Leipzig and held similar anti-Nazi views, as a consequence of which most of Leistner's works were destroyed in 1940. They most likely knew each other up to the period of Gerhardt's leaving permanently for England.\n\nFinally, the attached monogram, from a rather risquÃ© engraving/etching by Leistner from 1931 (censored for the sake of decorum!), must surely clinch the deal.\n\nIt is from this collection of works that were auctioned in 2015:\n\nhttps://bit.ly/2TJV1oR\n\nOther drawings in the collection have variations of this monogram.\n\nSo while the artist is Albrecht Leistner, is the sitter Gerhardt? Given the Leipzig connection, this could be likely.\n\n2 attachments\n\nmd16811875781.jpg (21 KB)\n\n1931-albrecht-leistner.png (2 MB)\n\nMarion, for Leistner's biographical details, you could add that he was a painter, graphic artist and sculptor; was a founding member of the Leipzig Secession / Leipziger Sezession (1910 - 1927); and was a member of the Deutscher KÃ¼nstlerbund in Weimar. See the following for context:\n\nhttps://www.kunst-zeiten.de/Die_Sezessionen\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutscher_KÃ¼nstlerbund\n\nOf the latter, here is a short extract from the online description:\n\n\"In 1936 the exhibition (of the Deutsche Kuenstlerbund / Association of German Artists (c.1905 - 1936)) in Hamburg was closed by the National Socialists and the Deutscher KÃ¼nstlerbund was closed at the same time. Until then the general public had been offered a remarkable spectrum of 20 exhibitions on a high artistic level. Nearly all German artists who occupied a high rank in the artistic world within the first three decades of the last century were members of the Deutscher KÃ¼nstlerbund and they made use of the platform to display their artistic ideas undisturbed by any governmental interference. The boost and the breakthrough of modern art is closely connected to the history of the Deutscher KÃ¼nstlerbund.\"\n\nWell done, Andrea - brilliant find. QED.\n\nCircumstantially the case was strong for Elena Gerhardt, and that for Leistner all but certain once versions of the same monogram were found by Marion and Kieran. As well as what we had, I did find mention in Gerhardt's autobiography 'Recital' of two other Leistner sitters, Julius Klengel and Ludwig WÃ¼llner (not Mullner) - the latter's marble bust is dated to 1930, the former's (in bronze) to 1921. But there is nothing there about Leistner himself or the portrait. I was also slightly worried about the bust's profile, which isn't wholly convincing (especially the nose - https://bit.ly/2VMKWKx). In truth I don't think it's an outstanding likeness - I suppose the sculptor felt impelled to flatter.\n\nI am rather puzzled that the RAM didn't know the identity of a bust they apparently acquired as late as 2003, especially as they have prize named after her!\n\nThank you everyone for all this fantastic research. We are very grateful to Kieran, Marion, Andrew Shore and others who have contributed and uncovered this compelling identification. We will add this to our collections database so the work is now properly identified and attributed. Just in answer to Osmundâs point about date of acquisition. We have some time ago changed our system to record âobject noâ rather than âacquisition noâ. This piece was not acquired in 2003 â that was the year it was catalogued. The Academy was founded in 1822 but we have only had a Museum from 2001 and there was a large number of items that belonged to the institution that needed to be catalogued. Predecessors obviously only got to this object and put it on the system in 2003.\n\nI donât know why there is any sort of note about Ada Lewis on the record â it would seem to the current Museum team that there is no basis for this but it may have been anecdotal from a professor or other staff at the institution from many years ago. Even in our system it has a question mark. We have a portrait of Ada Lewis on loan and you can see how someone may have thought the bust showed similarities, together with the monogram âALâ. https://www.ram.ac.uk/museum/item/28338\n\nThis is what we have noted in the portrait record: The Ada Lewis Scholarships were founded by Ada Lewis in July 1901 and supported such musicians as Sir John Barbirolli and Dame Moura Lympany for their training at the Academy. She also presented one of the Academy's treasures, the 'Habaneck' violin by Stradivarius, c1734. The sister of the composer Hope Temple, Mrs Lewis-Hill herself played the cello and violin.\n\nThanks again for a wonderful combined detective effort.\n\nThis discussion can now be wound up, as this handsome portrait bust with its strong red patina â I particularly like the cut-away torso and the vestigial collar â is now happily attributed. From an almost hopeless position, thanks to interventions from James Trollopeâs knowledgeable friend, and Marion Richardsâ equally knowledgeable colleague, this rapidly became an open and shut case. Osmund Bullock and Kieran Owens pulled together biographical detail that helped confirm the attributions, and finally the plaster was found by Andrea Kollman in the Stadtgeschichtliches Museum, Leipzig.\n\nSitter or subject: Elena Gerhardt (1883â1961), mezzo-soprano\n\nThe sculptor: Albrecht Leistner (1887â1950) signed with a monogram and dated 1928\n\nA very satisfactory conclusion, and, most importantly, two figures from the diaspora suffered in the mid-Twentieth Century, a diaspora which gave so much to this country, regain their place in history. Thanks to Art UK and all the sleuths on Art Detective, they should not easily lose their identities again.\n\nMarion will kindly inform the Stadtgeschichtliches Museum, Leipzig of the existence of the bronze at the Royal Academy of Music.\n\nThank you all.\n\n1 attachment\n\nelena-gerhardt-ram-2.docx (19 KB)"
