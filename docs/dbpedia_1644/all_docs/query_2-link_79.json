        "text": "Tracing Indigenous Roots In And Near Dolores Hidalgo (Guanajuato)\n\nDoing research on one’s indigenous roots in Guanajuato can be a challenge. In the Eighteenth Century, many Indigenous People simply did not have surnames. Instead, they were likely to have two given names. Other Indigenous People would carry a Spanish surname for a period of time and then discard it in favor of another surname, or none at all.\n\nIn the 1921 census, 828,724 residents of Guanajuato (96.3% of the state population) identified themselves as “indígena mezclada con blanca” (mestizo). Only 25,458 residents (or 3% of the population) declared themselves to be of “indígena pura” (pure indigenous) descent. Even more remarkable was the fact that only 4,687 residents claimed to be “blanca” or of pure European ancestry. Any research into your Guanajuato roots is likely to turn up a great deal of native and/or mixed ancestors. With this in mind, I tracked the ancestry of one person born in 1844 and this theory turned out to be very true for that family.\n\nColonial Mexico’s Casta System\n\nIn addition, Indigenous People were subject to Spain’s Casta System, under which any priest at any given time would provide a Casta classification for the person or persons in front of him at a church event [baptism, marriage, burial]. The priest had a wide range of casta labels to use, such as Indio, Mulato, Mestizo, Coyote, Español [Spanish], etc. These labels are discussed in more detail in this article.\n\nTransitory Surnames\n\nIn Mexico’s colonial parish records, many Indigenous People carried transitory surnames such as de la Cruz (“of the cross”) and de los Reyes (“of the Kings”). It is likely that parish priests gave these surnames to some Indigenous People, and at a later date, the Indian (or mestizo or mulato) would eventually choose another surname of their choice, perhaps based on their employer’s surname or the surname of a padrino at a wedding or baptism. Some Indigenous People chose to give themselves a saint’s name.\n\nNative Groups of the Region\n\nAccording to Peter Gerhard’s A Guide to The Historical Geography of New Spain (1972, pp. 237-239), the present-day cities of Dolores Hidalgo and San Felipe were part of the San Miguel el Grande Jurisdiction. Gerhard tells us that Guamare-speaking Chichimecs mostly occupied the area [according to Jiménez Moreno, 1958, pp. 63-64]. The tribes within the Guamare area included the Copuces and the Guaxabanes in the north. Beyond San Felipe lived the Guachichiles, the largest and most extensive Chichimec group that occupied large parts of what are now known as Zacatecas, San Luis Potosí, as well as smaller portions of eastern Jalisco and western Guanajuato. The article, “Who Were the Chichimecas” discusses the many groups that were placed under the umbrella term, Chichimeca:\n\nCreation of a New Ethnic Mix\n\nGerhard notes that “beginning in the 1550s, the Chichimecs were gradually displaced by Tarascans and Otomies and, to a lesser extent, Mexicans [Náhuatl-speakers], who came to form Indian congregations near the villas and to work on the Spaniards’ cattle estancias and haciendas.” With the various groups accumulating in the region, assimilation of the indigenous people took place, and, in time, a new ethnic mix was created.\n\nThe Loss of Tribal Identity\n\nThe Indigenous People of Dolores Hidalgo and San Felipe in the Guanajuato of the Eighteenth Century had been pacified two hundred years earlier, so they no longer had the tribal identity of their ancestors. However, their new identity as Spanish colonial citizens did not bring new freedoms, for they were referred to as Indians, Mestizos and Mulatos. In this Casta article, author Sindy Valdez explains:\n\n“In colonial Mexico, the Casta system was a rigid socio-racial classification imposed by Spanish colonial rule, designed to maintain a hierarchy based on ancestry. This system intricately categorized individuals based on their racial makeup, profoundly influencing their social status, rights, and opportunities. It is within this context that the primary categories of the Casta system emerged, each reflecting a specific racial mixture and societal position.”\n\nDolores Hidalgo\n\nIn 1610, the area that is now called Dolores Hidalgo was known as the Rancheria of San Cristóbal. In 1643, the Rancheria became a Congregation and in the year 1790, it became known as Pueblo Nuevo de los Dolores. The pueblo became a city (ciudad) in 1824.\n\nSan Felipe\n\nThe City of San Felipe was founded by Francisco de Velasco on January 21, 1562 by order of the viceroy Don Luis de Velasco, giving it the name of Villa de San Felipe in honor of the then Spanish monarch Felipe II.\n\nThe Maria Carlotta Moreno Lineage Report\n\nThe following lineage report follows the ancestors of Maria Carlotta Moreno, born in 1844, showing various documents of their life events [baptisms, marriages and burials]. Maria Carlotta Moreno married Doroteo Salazar. Her descendants married into the predominantly Spanish families of Rea and Ledesma and many of her descendants today live in the United States."
