These students distinguished themselves academically by attaining a grade point average of 3.50 or higher in at least 12 alpha graded credits. Students who are ineligible for honors because they receive (I) and/or (P) grades will be retroactively awarded honors if they meet the credit and GPA requirements once their (I) and/or (P) grades have been resolved.\n\nCongratulations to all for their accomplishments in achieving academic excellence at Oakland University."
