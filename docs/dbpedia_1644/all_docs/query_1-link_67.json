Performances of his song cycles have always been an event, whether Elena Gerhardt’s early Winterreise or Peter Pears and Benjamin Britten performing Die schöne Müllerin during the Second World War. Concerts marking his birthday on 31 January have been given by artists including The Songmakers’ Almanac, Alina Ibragimova and Cédric Tiberghien, Sir Simon Keenlyside and the Takács Quartet.",
