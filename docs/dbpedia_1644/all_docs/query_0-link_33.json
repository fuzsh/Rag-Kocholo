        "text": "The problem with Lupis’ reign is that Lupis is too nice and lacks coldness.\n\nDespite Lupis’ situation getting dire by the day, she still retains her compassionate side? I’m sorry but I find that hard to believe. While the Rozeria soldiers did make a mistake thinking that Laura was Ladine, it doesn’t change the fact that they were trying to kill her. Not to mention, Lupis was planning on killing Gerhardt if Mikhail had not been kidnapped. It’s not like Lupis said “No! I won’t kill them! That’ll make me look like a bad person!”\n\nThe whole reason why Lupis betrayed Ryouma was because she feared that he would side with someone who might invade Rozeria. But she also brought him back because she was cornered and felt so bad about betraying him that she was willing to accept any condition for him to save the kingdom. But during that time where she try to confine him and asked him to join in the war, she was ready to kill Ryouma (somehow) if he refused.\n\nMy point is that she has SOME level of coldheartedness. As such, I fail to see why she wouldn’t agree to purging the nobles or hiring assassins to kill Gerhardt. I cannot believe for even a moment that someone who’s THAT desperate would not even consider even the tinniest plan to resolve the situation at hand and considered some of Bergson’s plans. Gerhardt is obstructing her every action, so one would think that she is willing to cast away her pride in order to get rid of the man who started all of this in the first place. And even then, I don’t see how Gerhardt’s plan even works in the first place.\n\nEven if Gerhardt is using Ladine’s name to get what he wants, it wouldn’t be that easy. He may have control of the nobles but he needs his citizens from his territory (including soldiers) for his plans to work. But Lupis centered most of the power around her when all of this started. Ladine is recognized as an heir but unlike Ladine, Lupis has been in touch with her citizens by being the leader of the royal guard while we have yet to even SEE Ladine. Lupis has Elena (the most famous hero) at her side, who has a fan base (even Meltina acted like a fangirl) and when Elena switched to Lupis’ side, most of the knights went with her.\n\nIf Gerhardt uses Ladine’s name for an action and if Lupis or Elena said they disagreed with Ladine’s actions, their fan bases will let their emotions determine their actions because the two have a stronger influence. Only the nobles or soldiers who blindly follow orders would obey Ladine but she is constantly working with a man that everyone hates. It’s common knowledge that Gerhardt is a asshole and most of the citizens don’t like him. If Ladine or Gerhardt does something disadvantage for the kingdom, Lupis has the right to punish them as the ruler. So all of Gerhardt’s plans would crumble.\n\nAnd then there’s Elena, Elena is pretty much the only one who could save Rozeria and honestly, she SHOULD have. From what I understand from V4-Ch13, Elena has a vast network which reaches even within Zalda. If she has that on her side, how the hell is Sudou and his accomplishes even able to get this far? She knows for a fact that Gerhardt and his companions are going to try and usurp Lupis yet Elena doesn’t have people to keep an eye on them? She doesn’t know that Ladine’s retainer has been in Zelda two times and even spoke with the damn king? You would think that Elena, who has a network so large that it even reaches towards Zalda, would have heard that there’s corruption taking place within Rozeria. And since Meltina acted like a fangirl in her presence you’d think that something said by Elena would hold some weight when consulted with Lupis about something.\n\nI think the writer has chosen to keep Lupis stupid for the sake of plot. If she was willing to keep her policies about resolving everything using peaceful methods (resulting in Gerhardt taking away her power), she would have just let Ryouma leave.\n\nWhile a princess falling in love with a MC is cliche, I don’t really see that as a problem. Ryouma was the one who saved her in the first place. While he is a commoner, trying to marry Ryouma to help better the kingdom makes more sense than just letting him go. She doesn’t need to love him as political marriages are the norm. And since most MC’s are stronger than the norm, it makes since to acquire said power for the kingdom. I do admit though that way too many fantasy stories focus too much on politics.\n\nBut from what I have seen from Wortenia Senki so far, the stupidity of nobles of Rozeria (including Lupis) comes from plot device. Elena would have killed Hodram after learning that her daughter was killed. There’s nothing for her to lose. She has been keeping tabs on current events and knew that the knights would switch sides is she came back. She could have persuaded Lupis to give Hodram false charges to execute him if or something close to it in exchange for coming back.\n\nMikhail would have never been kidnapped because Mikhail is not a scout but second in command. There’s no reason for him to do that (when there should have been scouts who’s job is scouting) other than the plot needed him to. The nobles would and Elena would have consulted with Lupis to get Ryouma to join them by trying to bride him with something. A lot of situations in this series could have been resolved without Ryouma but plot demands that he does everything.\n\nI agree with all of this. Those have been some really contradictory tho es if the character."
