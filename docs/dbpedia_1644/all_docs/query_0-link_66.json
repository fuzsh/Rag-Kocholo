        "text": "It would of course be nice if we could confirm that Bach composed this motet in 1726 for the funeral of the wife of Stadthauptmann Winckler. Then this work for double choir could be added to the other motets that Bach composed in Leipzig, often on commission from private individuals. However, there are indications that Fürchte dich nicht was written much earlier. It bears a strong resemblance to another motet by Bach, Ich lasse dich nicht, BWV Anh159, which dates from 1712-13.\n\nFurthermore, the structure of Fürchte dich nicht shows strong similarities to a motet by Johann Michael Bach, the father of Bach’s first wife and the leading motet specialist of his day. His Christmas motet for double choir, entitled Fürchtet euch nicht, is broken up into two parts, just like Bach’s Fürchte dich nicht. Each part opens with double choir and with a text taken from the Bible. Halfway through both motets, the choirs come together, after which the soprano switches to a very different text, swaying on a fugue-like base that is distributed over the three lower voices and which continues the biblical words.\n\nThe big difference is that in his placid motet (the words to the shepherds taken from the Gospel of Luke are: ‘Fear not, for I bring tidings of great joy’), Johann Michael links the jubilant Christmas message to the equally cheerful Lutheran chorale ‘Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ’. Johann Sebastian, on the other hand, opts for a much greater complexity in his Fürchte dich nicht. In the biblical text, taken from Isaiah, he emphasises the doubts and fears of the believer. By contrast, the comforting words of Paul Gerhardt’s chorale ‘Warum solt ich mich denn grämen’, sung by the soprano, thus stand out even more starkly.\n\nAt the end of 1707, Bach married Johann Michael Bach’s daughter Maria Barbara. In this period, he was still strongly guided by what his predecessors had written – preferably trying to checkmate them with a compositional masterpiece. Of course we cannot know for certain, but it would be just like the young Bach to write a wonderful motet like this as a somewhat dubious tribute to his new father-in-law.\n\nMotets, BWV 225-231, 118 and Anh159\n\nCantatas were Bach’s daily bread and a regular part of his weekly tasks as Cantor of St Thomas’s. His motets were a different case entirely. Apart from the cantata, hardly any new music was played in Leipzig (music was selected instead from the motet collection Florilegium Portense). This gave Bach scope for writing commissioned works for private occasions, often funerals. Unfortunately, probably dozens of these works have been lost. The pieces that did survive have stayed on the repertoire since their composition, unlike Bach’s other vocal works.\n\nThe surviving authentic motets – nine works, although research continues – build on a genre with an impressive pedigree. Against the background of strict Renaissance polyphony, the generation of Schütz (1585-1672) borrowed elements from the opulent, polychoral works of Giovanni Gabrieli and gave them a Central-German, Lutheran twist. In Bach’s case, too, the content focused on chorales and biblical passages, whereby worldly madrigalism (or put simply: portraying the words) served only to reinforce the expression of the religious genre."
