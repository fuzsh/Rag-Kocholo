        "text": "Description:The first public school system of Poplar Bluff, according to Mrs. Walter Kennedy's sketch for Mr. Deem's History of Butler County, consisted of one frame building with three teachers. It was situated on the present site of Williamson-Kennedy School, but I have found no special name for it. Mr. Deem gives its date as 1875. This wooden building was replaced in 1885 by a four room brick building at a cost of $6,000. This building was known as Third Ward School and later its name was changed to Benton for Thomas Hart Benton (1782-1858), senator from Missouri 1821-1851. In 1922 the modern elementary school, costing $75,000 was erected on Lindsay Street, the same site as the former buildings. Its name was changed to Williamson-Kennedy School for Mrs. Hattie Williamson (now McDonald), who had served as principal of the school for twenty-five years, and for Mrs. Walter Kennedy, a teacher in the school for many years. The former died in 1943 and the latter in 1935. Both were beloved teachers of the town. (School Records by P.C. Hays; Deem, 79, 170, 178)Description:A large factory near the southeast city limits of Poplar Bluff, built in 1902, by Indiana capitalists, of whom Fred Bimel of Portland, Indiana, and Joseph Ashcroft of the Lambertville Spoke Manufacturing Company at Lambertville, New Jersey, were the chief members and managers. Mr. Ashcroft came to Poplar Bluff in 1902 as a manager of this factory, which was one of eighteen such factories in operation in five states. In 1912, Mr. Bimel died, the Lambertville Spoke Manufacturing Company became involved in financial troubles, and Mr. Ashcroft purchased the big business. Then the members of the company that had paid Mr. Ashcroft, the farmer boy, twelve and a half cents an hour, now asked to be enrolled as his employees. The Ashcroft Mill made spokes and other parts for vehicles, shipped to foreign markets during the First World War and afterwards, and has continued a flourishing business at home and abroad, even during the years of depression (1930-1935). At the present time (1934) they are shipping to England only. (S. Pottenger; Wm. Alexander; Deem; 117-118; J. Ashcroft)Description:A Missionary Baptist Church established on the west side of Black River, for which it is named, in the northern part of what is now Butler County. It was first at the present site of Wilby (q.v.). Later it was moved to the widow Keener's farm, south of Keener Springs (q.v.). Then, in 1860, it was moved about five miles farther up the river to its present location, which is in Wayne County. In the middle 1920s the old house burned and a concrete block house was built. Various dates have been found for its organization. Goodspeed says it was constituted in 1831, Douglas gives the date as 1833, but the Minutes of Wayne County Churches, 1930, and the M.B.G.A., 1934, give the date as 1818. Unquestionably it was the first church organized in the present limits of Butler County. Rev. Smelser, whose father and grandfather were Baptist ministers, also gives this date. (C. Hedspeth; Rev. C. Wallis; Goodspeed, 556; Douglas I.471; M.B.G.A., 1934; Rev. Wm. Smelser)Description:A low sandy ridge extending from Success, Arkansas, into Thomas Township across the southwestern corner of Butler County. The name is found in Franklin County and used for several places in the southern states, especially Buncombe County, North Carolina, which gave rise to the famous Americanism \"talking for Buncombe,\" hence buncombe, bunk == \"hot air\" (see Dictionary of American English). Gannett says all were originally named for Colonel Edward Buncombe of the Continental Army. Colonel Edward Buncombe was born in the West Indies, came to the American colonies and settled in Tyrrel County, North Carolina. In the Revolutionary War he raised and commanded the 5th North Carolina Regiment, and fought at the battles of Brandywine and Germantown. In the latter engagement he was severely wounded, captured, and died of his wounds in Philadelphia in 1777. His name was given to the North Carolina County in 1791. (APPLETON'S CYCLOPEDIA OF AMERICAN BIOGRAPHY). The phrase \"talking to (or for) Buncombe (or bunkum)\" is first cited by the DAE in 1828; the story of its origin in a Congressional speech is told in Bartlett's DICTIONARY OF AMERICANISMS in 1848. (S. Pottenger; A.F. Gray)Description:It is a southern border division, organized February 27, 1849, from a part of Wayne County. Later that part west of Cane Creek was added from Ripley County. It is bounded on the east by the St. Francis River, on the west by Ripley County, and on the north by Wayne County. Authorities do not agree as to its name father. William's HISTORY states it was named for Benjamin F. Butler (1795-1858), attorney general during Jackson's second term (1833-1837). Others say the name is for William Orlando Butler (1791-1880). The record of the acts of the General Assembly states, \"to be called Butler County, in honor of William O. Butler, of Kentucky.\" Even if we did not have the report of the Legislature, W.O. Butler would be more likely the one honored because he was a famous son of Kentucky, the state from which many of the earliest settlers of Butler County had come, while B.F. Butler was of New York, far away at that time to the Southeast Missourians. William O. Butler, a staunch Democrat, experienced much hardship in the War of 1812-1814, when he was made captain and served under Andrew Jackson, who praised him very highly. He resigned from the army in 1817 to finish his study of law. Upon the declaration of war against Mexico in 1846, he was appointed by President Polk major-general of the volunteers under General Taylor's command. Butler represented his home county in the legislature in 1817 and 1818 and in 1839 he was sent to Congress where he served two terms. In 1848, he was the Democratic nominee for vice-president. (Eaton, 264; Douglas I.179; Goodspeed, 173; HIST. OF MISSOURI, Conrad 1: 455-456; THE COMMONWEALTH OF MISSOURI 286; Williams, 562; LAWS OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI Fifteenth General Assembly, 25; Dic. of AMER. BIOG., III.356, 371)Description:A standard gauge road, named for the county, extends from Poplar Bluff (q.v.) to Piggott, Arkansas. Originally the narrow roads, extended into the timbered regions from the Palmer Plant (q.v.), were known as the Palmer Railroad. The Butler County Railroad Company, which was formed in 1900, took over the old lines and changed them somewhat. A main standard gauge road was gradually extended to Bailey's End (q.v.), which, for several years, remained the south terminus. The line was incorporated in 1904 as a public service institution to handle freight and passengers. By 1915 it had been constructed to Piggott. As Robert M. Parker had been the former active president of the Palmer lines, so William N. Barron, president of the new company, continued the advancement of vivid life along the road. The old small tram rails have practically all disappeared and some of the elevated road beds serve as good dirt roads in this large farming section that was formerly swampy and heavily timbered. In 1928 the road was sold to the St. Louis and San Francisco Company, but it is still locally known as the Butler County Railroad. (W.N. Barron; Deem, 29, 31, 121; Douglas I.508)Description:A farm, later owned by the Mengel family, is known by this name, according to some informants, because on it is a blue grass- covered hill three miles north of Poplar Bluff, the first elevation on the northern border of the large lowland region to the south and east. On the hill is a burial ground, thought by some to be very old. The name is apparently of double origin, but it seems quite certain that truly it is a personal name. The plat of 1859 shows this land belonging to the David E. Green heirs. By the explanation of Greenwood School (q.v.), we know that Green is a family name in the vicinity. Doubtless the Green family also owned land farther east and south where there were no hills, and this farm took its name, no doubt, from the topography as well as from the family name. (Mr. and Mrs. Wm. Sutherland; Mr. and Mrs. Jno. Martin; J.H.H. Potillo; J.J. Van Eaton)Description:A Baptist Church, established about 1880, near the upper part of Cane Creek. One informant explained that it was a Missionary at first; then became General Baptist. The name is idealistic. Another name, a nickname that stuck, was Barefoot Church. Two reasons are given for this name. It was explained that so many children went to the church without shoes. Another informant explained that an elderly man, Lafayette Kearby, of a highly respected early family went to church barefooted. Either explanation may be very authentic; but I prefer to accept this last reason because it was not uncommon for children to go to these out-of-the- way churches shoeless, and it is very probable that occasionally a grownup might do likewise. Before the twentieth century it was not uncommon for children to go to rural churches with bare feet. As late as 1885 it was not uncommon in some communities for grownups, when walking to church, to go with bare feet, carrying their shoes to put on when near the church. (H.D. Condray; Mr. and Mrs. Jno. Eudalay)Description:That part of lowland Butler County between St. Francis and Black rivers where a splendid system of ditches and levees has been made for draining the lowlands and protecting them from the overflow of these two rivers. Plans were begun in 1914, when a board of five supervisors, with William N. Barron as president, was organized under the Circuit Court; of that group, now (1943) only Mr. John C. Corrigan is living. An extra ditch tax was assessed on the land, which proved a burden on some smaller landowners, but the rich farming lands have resulted. Actual construction was begun in 1918, and Mr. Barron's office gives the cost as over two million dollars. The ditches were designated by numbers from No. 1 to No. 37, but some of them have acquired other names also. Mrs. Alice Johnson, personal secretary for Mr. Barron, very graciously gave me in detail the ditches and their location. The drainage ditches west of Black River were made under the supervision of the County Court. They are not all known by numbers, and their names are included among the place names of Butler and Ripley counties. Cf. Ditches and Main Ditch (Mrs. A. Johnson)Description:Apparently the first burial ground of the white man in what is now Butler County, the small cemetery is across Cane Creek from the farm, now owned by Mr. Odie Smith, which was a part of the tract of land entered by the Kittrells. Seldom is one buried here, and the roads and highways have left the place quite remote and solitary, suggestive of a Missouri \"Gray's Elegy.\" Crude chiseling of names and dates on some of the rough, native slabs of stone are still legible. One has the inscription: \"MA April 12, 1820\"; another, \"MP DECT Sept 3, 1823.\" The most notable one, \"S Kit B 1777 D 1838,\" corresponds with the dates in the Old Kittrell Bible, now held by Mrs. Martha Smith of Poplar Bluff, which records Samuel Kittrell (1777-1838) and four others, Solomon, Joseph, Lemuel, and Samuel, who Mrs. Smith says are the four sons of Samuel Kittrell. The grave, \"S Kit,\" is pointed as that of Samuel Kittrell, and one, unmarked except by the old method of surrounding and covering over with large, flat, native stones is said to be that of Solomon Kittrell who died in 1872. I mention this because it disproves statements in history that Solomon Kittrell was the first settler. Since the father did not live many years and appears not to have been active in business circles, it is easy for history to speak only of Solomon. Old residents point with pride to the place where Samuel Kittrell, a squatter built his cabin, and to the hillside nearby where the home of Solomon was built with quarters for their slaves. (Mrs. Cecil Burton; Mrs. Martha Smith; Cf. Kittrell's Mill in Ripley County)Description:About 1878 George H. Crumb, who was located at Ironton, Missouri, as a registrar of government land, had a vision of making a great industry at the old Brannum Mill (q.v.) place and retiring from the land business. He built a three-story burr grist mill for grinding corn and wheat, and named it for the old citadel in the heart of Moscow, Russia, which is now the communist government center. After his death, the mill was bought by John Lucian Ball of Poplar Bluff, about 1900, and operated by him for a number of years. It is still known by his name locally. During the Crumb ownership, the mill was also known as Brown's Mill for a Mr. Brown who operated it for some time. Mr. Ball put in a sawmill. Also a store was established and it was a thriving place for a number of years until the roller flour mill of Poplar Bluff was established. Now only the old ruins remain. (Mrs. Julia Warren; Thos. Kenzie; I.H. Barnhill; E. Abington; B. Adams; S. McPheeters; Maps 1879-1912)Description:An abandoned Primitive Baptist Church, established about 1910, near Marble Hill School (q.v.). It was destroyed by a tornado in 1928, and has not been rebuilt. For several years, Agee School had been used by the Methodists and Baptists for services. \"Grandpa,\" Thomas M. Henson, who had brought his family from Tennessee in 1898, was the dynamic figure in the building of the church. When at the school election, someone said, \"I'm in favor of locking the doors and not letting anyone preach there,\" Mr. Henson remarked that he \"hated to live in a neighborhood where the schoolhouse can't be used.\" He encouraged the brethren, saying that there was not a church house between Poplar Bluff and Hendrickson, and that he had some money. He then got donations for $175 and furnished the balance himself. Other leaders were Rev. Ples Whitwell, Rev. A.R. Raulston, T. Gilliam, and S. Agee. The name was suggested by the pastor's wife, Mrs. Ples Whitwell from the words of Jesus: \"I am the vine; ye are the branches\" (John 15:5). It is a favorite church name in this part of Missouri. Cf. below. (Thos. Henson; S. Agee)Description:It is a part of one of the most famous trails, the Natchitoches Path (q.v.). Dr. John R. Hume wrote as quoted in the MISSOURI HISTORICAL REVIEW, Vol. 24, p. 613: \"One of the oldest and most interesting roads in the Middle West, because it is woven into the warp and woof of our pioneer life in such a way as to make it inseparable from our national history.\" Houck wrote: \"After the settlement of the country, the Natchitoches Path became the military and wagon road of the immigrants moving into Arkansas, crossing the Mississippi River at Bainbridge or Cape Girardeau, thence moving to the St. Francois River, crossing the same at the Indian Ford, thence to Black River, there crossing near Poplar Bluff and then Current River at what was long as Pittman's Ferry.\" Tradition says that it was along this road that the Kittrells (cf. Kittrell Store in Butler County and Kittrell's Mill in Ripley County) came, and that it was along this trail that under President Jackson's command was cut out the road over which the United States moved the Indians in 1839 (cf. Indian Ford in Ripley County). Older settlers mention the road in connection with General Price and his army during the Civil War and point out occasionally insulators in the Cane Creek community, where wires were extended by him for sending messages (cf. Reeves Station in Butler County and Battle Hollow in Ripley County). Colonel William Monks of West Plains, who remembered the Cherokee Indians in Alabama, wrote that his father, James Monks, who with his family came from Alabama, and located first in Fulton County, Arkansas (later came to Howell County), \"came by way of Jackson, Missouri, traveled the old military road made by the government troops in removing the Cherokee Indians from the State of Alabama to their present location.\" He further states that it was the only road leading west. The MISSOURI CASH BOOK, August 6, 1936 has an interesting article on the removal of the Cherokee Indians from North and South Carolina, east Tennessee, northern Georgia, and northern Alabama to Arkansas, and Indian Territory. The writer explains that in 1817 some of the dissatisfied Cherokees traded their rights for lands west of the Mississippi along the upper branches of Red and White rivers. They located in northwestern Arkansas. Then in 1838-1839, because of encroachments of the Whites, the other branch of the Cherokees, by a treaty of 1835, were moved by military force from their old home to the Cherokee Reservation (now in Oklahoma), where those of Arkansas joined them. Dr . Hume also mentions an old trail leading from Sunflower Landing on the Mississippi River and up the river to the now famous Cherokee Bay and northward. These statements add weight to the local reports that a portion of the Military Road in Butler and Ripley counties was also known as the Cherokee Bay Road (q.v.). Some of the oldest settlers interviewed spoke of the country about Corning, Arkansas, as the Cherokee Bay section. It seems quite certain that both names, the Military Road and Cherokee Bay Road derive their names from these Indians; the first, for their forced removal, the latter for the early settlement in Arkansas. (C. Pottenger; Mrs. G. Powers; Houck I.227; MISSOURI HIST. REV. Vol. 24; 613; THE CASH BOOK)Description:One of the two original townships. It comprised the southern part of the county, but no definite reason has been found for its name. There is an Otter Creek in Wayne County, but it could hardly have influenced the name for this township. It is very probable that Pike Slough (upper part of Pike Creek) (q.v.), also called Copeland Creek, had an earlier name, Otter Creek, given by the early trappers and hunters, because otters were numerous in the early days in this section of Missouri. (Cf. Otter Creek in Wayne County and Otter Pond and Otter Lake in Butler County). Pike Slough (possibly Otter Creek) flows through the region of Otter Pond (q.v.) into Cane Creek, and since it is the main stream (besides Cane Creek which no doubt is a very early name) of this early township, and because the other division was named for Black River, it is evident that the main stream here must have been Otter Creek for which this township was named. (Goodspeed, 374; B. Deem)Description:A name given to the first sawmill camp in Ten Mile Community. The mill was operated by S.D. Author and D. Livingston during the early 1880s. Mr. John Eudalay said it was named by W.R. Minix, but the reason was not found. It is possible that it is a derisive name for small or something for play. Fifty years ago, and, no doubt, long before that time, one amusement for children along the small streams was to \"go fishing\" with pin hooks made from large dress pins or hair pins. It was great fun to catch the minnows (\"topwaters\") as they played about the streams. Possibly a bend in the stream nearby, a \"hair pin\" bend, or \"pin hook\" gave rise to the name, but the exact origin must remain for the present, a mystery to be solved later. Cf. Pin Hook in Pettis County, the original name of the first county seat, later changed to St. Helena, now Helena. Mrs. Overlay states in her thesis that it was borrowed from one of three places named Pin Hook in Tennessee.Description:In 1850 or 1851, a few months after the county had been re-divided into four townships, Polk Township was formed, evidently partly superseding Butler Township. Any idea that it was named for President James K. Polk (1795-1849) has been disproved by local history. Goodspeed mentions Samuel Polk as one of the pioneers with James Brannum (cf. Brannumsburg). Mr. Corrigan, an abstractor of Poplar Bluff for years, says there were landowners of this name in the county before the Civil War, and that the site of Morocco (q.v.) was owned by negroes of this name. An elderly, colored resident of the vicinity of Morocco, Mr. Martin, whose statement corroborates that made by Mr. Corrigan, and also that of Goodspeed, explains that two brothers, Pete and Tom Polk, who had been slaves of the Polk family in Arkansas, came here after they had been freed, and settled on both sides of Black River. In 1866 when the new township of Gillis Bluff was organized, the name Polk Township disappeared from the map. (Goodspeed, 309, 375; J.C. Corrigan; Wm. D. Martin)Description:This city, the largest in this section of counties, is now situated on both sides of Black River, on the Missouri Pacific and Frisco railroads, and it is the terminus of the \"Cat\" Branch, and Butler County Railroad. It owes its rapid growth to the timber business and its means of transportation. The commissioners, appointed by the County Court, John Stevens, William Henley, and John F. Martin, selected for the site 160 acres of government land and appointed Obadiah Epps to receive small loans from individuals, with which to pay for the land. The town site was surveyed early in 1850, and, on May 17, and in August, public sales were made for selling lots. The post office was established February 27, 1850. In February, 1870, it was incorporated by the County Court as a village. Its name was suggested by the dense growth of the famous tulip tree, commonly called poplar, the magnolia of the north, which at that time covered the bluffs overlooking the river. The tulip or yellow poplar belongs to the magnolia family \"magnoliaceae.\" \"Liridendron,\" meaning lily and tree, and \"tulipifera,\" tulip bearing, are two Greek words describing this variety of poplar. It is one of the largest and most beautiful of our native trees and is known to have reached a height of 190 ft. with a trunk ten feet in diameter. Parker, MISSOURI AS IT WAS IN 1867, p. 200, gives the name \"Poplar Bluffs\" for the place. Locally, in the rural section, \"The Bluff\" is a very commonly used term. They more often say \"go to The Bluff\" than \"to Poplar Bluff.\" (P.L. and Postal Guide 1853-; Houck II.169-170; Douglas I.312)Description:A pioneer grist mill, of which only the ruins remain, in Beaver Dam Township on Little Black River and on the Military Road, near the Ripley County line. \"Uncle Jimmy\" Tubb built the mill before the Civil War apparently for Thomas Ponder, by whose name it was known for a time. Then Holly Powers, who lived in Ripley County and kept the Beaver Dam post office operated the mill before the Civil War. Later \"Uncle Andy\" (Andrew) Powers, for whom the mill was named, owned the mill and operated it for many years, when it was the best in the county at that time. It has not been used since in the very early 1900s. The post office nearby was called Belcher. Powers Graveyard, in the vicinity of the mill, was started during the Civil War. It is known by this name because the older members of the Powers, Washington, and Andrew families were the first to be buried there. (E.B. Slayton; Mrs. M. Arnold; Polly Powers; A. Powers; A. Ward; M.F. Vandover)Description:The name of a post office kept by Alfred Kelly in his home until a few days before his death (1896), when he turned it over to William Gentzen. I have not found whether the name was changed at that time or not. It was established as early as 1883. The origin of the name is not known definitely. Mr. Calvin thinks it was given for Quincy (later Mrs. William Gentzen), Mr. Kelly's eldest daughter; but Mrs. John Craft, a daughter of Mr. Kelly's gave the following explanation. Dr. Cook of the community suggested calling the office Ruth for Ruth Kelly (Mrs. John Craft), but that her father objected and just took some letters and made up the name. When the papers came from Washington, accepting the name, she, a mere child at the time, asked him what it meant and where he had got such a queer word. He answered, \"I don't know.\" She further explained that the Quincy mentioned was a sister of her father's, and that his daughters were Ruth, Laura, Alice and Quincy. Alice was not living when the post office name was selected. She also stated that Fred Pratt, who was later a timber and mill man in that section, thought the word was the name of a kind of timber. On the railroad map of 1910 the name is spelled Quilin, an attempt at simplified spelling. This spelling probably came from the idea that it was another of the tree-name villages along the Butler County Railroad. It seems to me very obvious that the suggested names, Quincy and Laura, must have been the cause for Mr. Kelly's just taking some letters and forming a word. \"Qu\" from Quincy, the initial letter from \"Laura,\" and the second two letters of Quincy make the word. However certain one may feel that the two daughters' names are the real parents of the post office name, one can only conclude that Mr. Kelly arbitrarily coined the word, and apparently we have no way of finding how he was thinking at the time. (Cf. Kelly School, Qulin School, and Qulin the village. (E. Calvin; Mrs. Ruth Craft)Description:A small town on the Burlington, Chicago Railroad, a name which supplanted Melville (q.v.) prior to 1910. Mr. Barron, who was president of the railroad company, earlier its attorney, says he knows nothing of the origin or the name, but that \"Qulin was the name of a schoolhouse some three miles southwest of the present town of Qulin and the name was stolen and transplanted to the town.\" It is possible that the old Qulin post office name could have been changed to another name before the town was established, but it is very likely that the old post office was moved to the station, and the new Qulin was merely the old post office name as well as the school name. Cf. Melville and Qulin post office. (W.N. Barron (see his letter in INTRO. TO SURVEY OF MISSOURI PLACE NAMES, p. 36; Map 1910)Description:According to Eaton, this was the earlier name for Hendrickson (q.v.); but old residents say Reeves Station was about a mile west of that town, which location agrees with the 1859 plat. These local informants connect the name with Colonel Timothy Reeves, whom they declare was stationed there during the Civil War, on the old Albert Reeves farm, to head off General Sterling Price on his famous raid of August 29 to December 2, 1864, along the old military road. One informant remarked that German soldiers under his command took a special liking to him, and that \"people enjoyed life while he was stationed there, for the Jayhawkers did not give so much trouble.\" An explanation of authentic historical records, however, shows that local tradition has distorted the facts in making Reeves an officer on the Union side. He was in truth a Confederate officer under General Price, and is referred to as himself a notable \"bushwhacker\" in the official records of the Union Army. A report of the skirmish at Reeve's Mill, November 19, 1864, mentions \"a rebel force of about two hundred men under Timothy Reeves,\" and declares that the Union force \"killed a notorious bushwhacker, Ely Garbert, at Reeve's Mill, and destroyed the mill, which had been used as a place of resort by them and was furnishing supplies continually.\" Colonel Reeves has been better remembered by present day inhabitants at Battle Hollow (q.v.) in Ripley County, and as officer on the Confederate side and in command of the Southern troops at the skirmish of Ponder's Mill on September 20, 1864. Goodwin and West, 1867, p. 45 gives Reeves Station as a post office. Mr. Deem explained that Colonel Timothy Reeves was a brother to Albert Reeves. (J.H.H. Potillo; B. Deem; S. Agee; R. Keener; Eaton; THE WAR OF THE REBELLION: A COMPILATION OF THE OFFICIAL RECORDS OF THE UNION and CONFEDERATE ARMIES, 1901, Series 1, vol. xli, Part I. p. 924)Description:A post office and old grist mill site on Cane Creek between Poplar Bluff and Bay Springs Church. During the Civil War, it was operated by a Mr. Harrison, by whose name it was known. Later it was owned by Thomas M. Lane, who had come from Georgia to Butler County in 1869 and lived on a farm near the mill, then Tubb's Mill (q.v.). Later William Randles came from Indiana and bought land and the mill. He got the post office established, to which they wished to give his name, but the postal authorities would not accept that name. Mrs. Ollie Randles, daughter-in-law of William Randles, explains that her husband, Morton Randles, then a small boy, offered the name Roxie for his little sister who had died a short time before. This discovery disproves the possible origin, as suggested by Rev. Wallis, because of the fact that several loads of rocks had been thrown into the creek to make the ford more shallow. Nothing but the old ruins of the mill remain, but the place is a good place for picnicking and fishing. (Rev. C.W. Wallis; Thos. Kenzie; Mrs. Ollie Randles; Postal Guide 1892-1915; J.S. Hudgens)"
