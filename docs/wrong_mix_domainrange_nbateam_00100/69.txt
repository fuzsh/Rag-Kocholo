Former Wizards center Emeka Okafor is attempting an NBA comeback, his agent confirmed to ESPN’s Jackie MacMullan.

Okafor, a former No. 2 overall pick, last played for Washington during the 2012–13 season. He plans to work on his conditioning and is aiming to sign with a “contending team” in December or January, according to the report.

Okafor, who averaged 9.7 points and 8.8 rebounds per game in 79 appearances in his last season, stepped away from the NBA due to a herniated disk in his neck. He was traded to the Suns before the 2013–14 season, but never played a game for Phoenix.

Okafor reportedly considered a return last season, and was in contact with the Heat, Warriors and Cavaliers for a roster spot. He ultimately decided to delay his comeback until this winter.

MacMullan reports Golden State was in contact with Okafor again two months ago, and named the Spurs as another team who could use depth in the frontcourt.

In his career, Okafor has averaged 12.3 points and 9.9 rebounds per game.
