        "text": "Emeka Okafor you plan to execute your 'player option' to continue the 2013-14 campaign in the Washington Wizards. This is what the player himself has expressed in statements to Washington CSN.\n\nThe center, who arrived via transfer from New Orleans Hornets, believes that the capital team has a great future, so it will take advantage of its option to receive the 14,48 million that has agreed.\n\n\"My plan is to be here next year,\" the interior highlighted. «My mentality is to be here next year. I think this team has great potential. If we had everyone healthy, it would be different. “We would be playing in a playoff position,” the center told the North American media."
