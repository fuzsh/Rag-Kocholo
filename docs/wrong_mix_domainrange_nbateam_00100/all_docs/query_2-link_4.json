        "text": "The Washington Wizards are winning. Quite a bit, actually. They've won nine of their past 16 games -- including eight of 15 since John Wall returned from injury -- after their 106-96 victory over the New York Knicks Wednesday at Verizon Center. Or was it Madison Square Garden South?\n\nIt should come as no surprise that there were thousands of orange-and-blue-clad Knicks fans at the game Wednesday (and Magic Johnson and Kentucky coach John Calipari, too) because opposing fans make themselves known at both Wizards and Capitals games -- Lakers, Heat, Knicks for the Wizards; Penguins, Flyers, Sabres and Rangers for the Capitals -- but it apparently confused Emeka Okafor.\n\n\"I forgot what city I was in a couple of times,\" Okafor said.\n\nSo now the Wizards have defeated five of the NBA's six division leaders (at the time the Wizards beat them, at least): Los Angeles (minus Chris Paul and Blake Griffin), Miami (with Robert Griffin III in attendance), Oklahoma City, Chicago and New York.\n\nYes, I know that saying that is no better than saying that the Redskins have defeated the eventual Super Bowl champion in each of the last three seasons -- which they have, by the way -- but if the Mystics can have Attendance Champion banners and the Capitals Eastern Conference Regular Season Champion banners, then the Wizards can surely have Defeating Almost All Division Leaders banners."
