        "text": "Jon Krawczynski: Emeka Okafor has been cleared to return to action, is working out and is determined to return to the NBA, I’m told. Okafor last played in 2012-13 with Washington, but was sidelined by a herniated disc in his neck. But he’s been working out and is ready. Emeka Okafor will turn 35 in September, but after working out still feels like he has plenty left in the tank\n\nEmbiid would like the team to find a way to make to utilize Okafor as opposed to trading him before Thursday’s NBA trade deadline. “We got a lot of talent, and I feel we can use everybody if we want to get to where we want to,” the rookie center said. “Obviously the playoffs are right there even if we don’t get the opportunity to make it this year. I think next year is our goal …\n\nStoryline: Jahlil Okafor Trade?\n\nEmeka Okafor eyeing NBA comeback\n\nEmeka Okafor, the former No. 2 overall pick who has been out of the NBA for three seasons, has decided to attempt a comeback with an eye toward joining a “contending team” in December or January. Okafor’s agent, Jeff Schwartz, confirmed that Okafor, who last played for the Washington Wizards in 2012-13 before suffering a herniated disc in his neck, is in the gym training and working on his conditioning. “He’s probably five or six months away,” Schwartz said. “He’s been working hard rehabbing. For some guys that means one thing. To Emeka, who understands his body as well or better than some trainers that have worked with him, it means something else. He’s healthy. He feels great, but he’s a perfectionist, and he wants everything to be right.”\n\nThis rumor is part of a storyline: 10 more rumors\n\n“He’s in great shape,” Calhoun said. “He had offers last season from teams for $6-7 million to play just a portion of the season, but you have to know Emeka. He’s only coming back when he feels the time is right. “He’s not going to make a decision based on money. He doesn’t need it. This is a kid who graduated with a 3.9 GPA. He wants to play a couple more years then go to business school at Harvard. He’s only going to play for a contending team.”\n\n“We always pay attention to whatever is out there,” Buford said. “But Emeka is three years removed from a time when his body was letting him down. “It’s just hard to get enough information to evaluate a player like that, who won’t be in training camp, who hasn’t had game action for a prolonged period of time.”\n\nStoryline: Emeka Okafor Comeback?"
