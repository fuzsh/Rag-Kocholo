        "text": "Capital City Go-Go to flex-assign players to Pelicans' affiliate originally appeared on NBC Sports Washington\n\nThe Wizards' G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go, announced on Friday plans to flex-assign players to the New Orleans Pelicans' affiliate, the Erie BayHawks, for the 2021 season.\n\nAs the G League began finalizing details regarding its 2021 season, the Go-Go were among a few teams to opt out of the season. The Lakers and Bucks' affiliates also opted out.\n\nThe G League will play a condensed season in a bubble format at the Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. There will be 17 NBA affiliate teams to participate, as well as the G League Ignite, a one-year developmental program for elite NBA prospects such as Jonathan Kuminga and Jalen Green.\n\n\"Players chosen to participate by the Wizards will have the opportunity to compete with the BayHawks during the NBA G League bubble,\" the Go-Go's press release stated. \"Further details on the players and staff participating and schedule of the bubble will be announced at a later date.\"\n\nIt's unclear how many players the Wizards will be able to send to the G League bubble, and if they'll include players on two-way contracts like rookie Cassius Winston and Garrison Matthews.\n\nFormer NBA veterans Lance Stephenson, Michael Beasley and Emeka Okafor headline the draft-eligible player pool heading into the league's Jan. 11 draft. Former Wizards small forward Admiral Schofield, who was dealt away in the draft-night trade with Oklahoma City for Winston, is also available to be drafted.\n\nThough no schedule has been disclosed to teams yet, the G League has informed its participating teams of a Feb. 8 start date."
