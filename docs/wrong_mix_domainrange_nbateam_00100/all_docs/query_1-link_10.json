        "text": "Rob Carr/Getty Images\n\nFrom Elgin Baylor to Dave Bing to Austin Carr to Adrian Dantley to Danny Ferry to Grant Hill to Steve Francis to Kevin Durant—just to name a few.\n\nThe Washington, DC area has bred basketball players since the 1950’s and has been consistently doing so ever since.\n\nNot only that, but the area known as the “DMV” (which is acronym for DC, Maryland and Virginia) takes pride in its basketball hotbed.\n\nCoaches like Morgan Wootten and Stu Vetter are household names among hoopheads out there. Schools like DeMatha Catholic and the powerful Washington Catholic Athletic Conference (WCAC) are featured throughout the college basketball landscape all over the country.\n\nAAU clubs like DC Assault and Team Takeover have gained notoriety as well. Barry Farm is a historical landmark for the sport.\n\nThe point I’m trying to make is that DC’s mark in basketball history is stacked, but when it comes to the city’s professional franchise, the Washington Wizards/Bullets are ignored. (For the sake of this article I'll call them the Wizards, even though this franchise was the Bullets for a longer period of time).\n\nIt’s been over thirty years since the Wizards have done anything substantial in the NBA. Names like Wes Unseld, Earl Monroe and Moses Malone are long forgotten players.\n\nGheorghe Muresan remains a folk-like tale. Chris Webber was traded for Mitch Richmond. I remember watching Rod Strickland call timeout in the middle of a game to vomit.\n\nThe Wizards were basically responsible for the Pistons championship in 2004 (Richard Hamilton, Rasheed Wallace and Ben Wallace were integral parts of that team), Michael Jordan started his illustrious (sarcasm) front office campaign in the district and didn’t even lead the team to the playoffs as a player.\n\nLet’s not forget that Gilbert Arenas may have had the biggest meltdown in recent sports history.\n\nWant me to keep going? Gar Heard, Leonard Hamilton, Bernie Bickerstaff, Calbert Cheaney, Ed Tapscott, Mike Miller, Randy Foye, Ernie Grunfeld, Andray Blatche, Nick Young, JaVale McGee, Flip Saunders and Kwame Brown. I can keep going, I guarantee it.\n\nWhen the Los Angeles Clippers acquired Chris Paul last summer, I came to a sad realization—the Washington Wizards are the worst franchise in NBA history.\n\nSince their 1978 championship, the Wizards have done nothing but alienate the fanbase with embarrassing personnel decisions, off the court disasters and poor coaching.\n\nThis is incredibly sad for me. Given my anecdote in the beginning of this article, the city takes pride in it’s basketball—as it should.\n\nHowever, there is no symmetry from the immense talent to come out of the “DMV” and it’s relationship with the basketball team.\n\nTo prove this, I went around and surveyed 10 fellow Washingtonians and asked them to name five current Wizards.\n\nOut of those 10 people, every single one of them said John Wall. Only three out of 10 were able to name five or more.\n\nIn all honesty, I’m actually surprised that I found three people who could complete the task (ironically, one of them is a season ticket holder).\n\nThe Washington Redskins are number one in this city, always have been and always will.\n\nThe Washington Capitals have become a sight to see. The Verizon Center is packed every night as Caps fans hold one of the best home ice advantages in the NHL.\n\nAfter the season the Nationals just had, their fanbase is growing at an exponential rate.\n\nSo who is at fault for this? Is it Abe Pollin and his unsuccessful ownership? Is it the people he hired who were clearly not fit for the job? Is it Washingtonians for being so disinterested?\n\nIt's very rare for a losing franchise to remain so popular—an organization like the Chicago Cubs are a prime example. It is much more common for the general public to remain unengaged to a team if the results are less than average.\n\nEven though DC doesn’t have the best reputation regarding its fans, I don’t put the blame on them.\n\nFor many years, the team called their home USAir Arena, also known as US Airways Arena or the Capital Centre. For those that don’t remember, the place was a dump. It was in an inconvenient location for Metro goers and was just downright ugly.\n\nThe potential for the current Wizards team is not looking promising, either.\n\nJohn Wall is certainly a special talent, but lingering injuries have plagued him, along with his lack of an outside shot.\n\nThe team made a head-scratching trade with New Orleans for Trevor Ariza and Emeka Okafor. The Wizards made the impulsive trade because they know they can’t attract any legitimate free agents.\n\nThat’s right. Not one All-Star has any desire to play in DC. That's when you know your franchise is in trouble.\n\nThe frustrating aspect to the situation in DC is that the NBA features so much parody. I know for a fact that more than half of the league has zero chance at winning an NBA title.\n\nThe rest of the league just contends for mediocrity, maybe a playoff series win, if lucky. Then they have to face the Lakers, Thunder, Bulls and Heat. I’d also throw in the Celtics, Grizzlies, Spurs and Clippers for potential dark horses (just covering all my angles here).\n\nI don’t like how the NBA is run and the Wizards are a prime example. Good luck to coach Randy Wittman. He’s going to need it."
