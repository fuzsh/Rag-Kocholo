        "text": "At 11:56 a.m., the Sixers made the waiving of the three players official.\n\nKANSAS CITY â€“ The 76ers told Kris Humphries, Emeka Okafor and James Blackmon Jr. that they would be waived on Saturday.\n\nAll three players were informed of the team's decision following Friday's 119-95 victory preseason victory over the Miami Heat at the Sprint Center.\n\nThat leaves the Sixers' roster at 17 players.\n\nMonday is the official deadline for teams to trim their rosters to 15 full-time players and two additional players to two-way contracts for the regular season. Two-way players will go back and forth from the NBA to the G-League, formerly the NBA Development League.\n\nThe Sixers signed James Michael McAdoo to one of those two-way deals this summer. Don't be surprised if Jacob Pullen, a guard who last played overseas, gets signed to the other two-way deal.\n\nOkafor was trying to return to the NBA after having last played for the Washington Wizards in 2012-13. The center came into the league as the second overall pick by the Charlotte Bobcats in the 2004 draft. He played nine seasons with the Bobcats, New Orleans Hornets, and Wizards.\n\nThe Wizards traded him to the Phoenix Suns before the 2013-14 season, but Okafor missed that season because of a herniated disc in his neck and remained unsigned for the last three seasons.\n\nHumphries, the 14th overall pick in the 2004 draft, played the past two seasons for the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nThe 13-year veteran has also played for the Utah Jazz, Toronto Raptors, Dallas Mavericks, New Jersey/Brooklyn Nets, Boston Celtics, Wizards, and Suns.\n\nBlackmon went undrafted in June after playing three seasons at Indiana. He was a member of the Sixers' summer league team."
