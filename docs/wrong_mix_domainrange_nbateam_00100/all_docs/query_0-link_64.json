That season, Okafor led the UCONN huskies to a National Championship where he was named the NCAA Tournaments Most Outstanding Player. Okafor, known for his defensive capabilities, was the Big East Player of the Year that season and graduated as UCONNs all-time leader in blocked shots with 441. Okafor was also selected to the 2004 Mens National team that won the bronze medal at the 2004 Olympics in Athens. Okafor was the second overall pick in the 2004 NBA Draft, making him the first ever pick by the new expansion team, the Charlotte Bobcats. He put together an impressive rookie campaign that saw 19 straight double-doubles and ended with Rookie of the Year honors.
