        "text": "My name is Emeka Okafor and I am a professional basketball player for the National Basketball Association (NBA). I started my career with the NBA’s Charlotte Bobcats and played for the New Orleans Hornets as well as the Washington Wizards. I have been in the NBA for 10 years and named the 2004 NBA Rookie of the Year. Prior to being drafted in the NBA, I was a member of the 2004 NCAA Championship Team, the University of Connecticut Huskies. Upon winning the title and graduating from college in three years, I was named to the 2004 USA Men’s Basketball team and represented my country in the Olympic Games in Athens, Greece.\n\nIn my field, restorative treatments are one of the most paramount components to having a successful career. I worked with many different practitioners and body workers and Arthur Jaffe is one of the finest and most talented. His intuitive, in depth knowledge of the human body and easy-going personality makes him an instrumental piece on the road to recovery. I can personally attest to his specific knowledge and expertise in healing. In the short while that I have had the privilege of working with Arthur, I have seen long held physical and emotional tension melt away. During each session I can (literally) feel my body clock being turn back as my muscles relax, aches disappear, and youthful vigor return.\n\nI have personally consulted with Arthur and plan to continue working closely with him for the remainder of my career as a professional basketball player. I would recommend him to my family members as well as any player in the NBA or other professional sporting organizations in the United States. He truly is a uniquely qualified individual in the realm of healing."
