        "text": "WASHINGTON — Washington earned its first victory after starting the season with 12 straight losses, getting 19 points from Jordan Crawford to beat Portland.\n\nWashington survived a scoreless 6:47 in the fourth when Crawford hit on a 3-pointer with 2:06 to play, and the Wizards finally took the 84-82 lead on Emeka Okafor’s two free throws with 39.1 seconds remaining.\n\nDamian Lillard was called for traveling with 28 seconds left. After Nene was called for an offensive foul, J.J. Hickson missed a jumper with 2.8 seconds to play. The Wizards lost the ball with 0.2 seconds to go, but held on to end the skid.\n\nNine teams started the season 0-13, and the Wizards were tired of the ridicule they’d been subjected to — locally and nationally — as they crept toward the Nets’ NBA record-worst start of 0-18.\n\nTHUNDER 120, ROCKETS 98\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY — Kevin Durant matched his season high with 37 points, and Oklahoma City beat Houston in James Harden’s first game back at Chesapeake Energy Arena since being traded by the Thunder before the season.\n\nHarden scored 17 points, but was limited to 3-for-16 shooting. He had six shots blocked by the Thunder.\n\nPatrick Patterson scored 27 points and Omer Asik had 17 points and 12 rebounds to lead the way for the Rockets, who began the day by attending the funeral of coach Kevin McHale’s daughter in Minnesota.\n\nHarden missed his first nine shots, and by the time he made one, the Rockets were down by double digits in the second half. They never got closer than 10 after that.\n\nBULLS 101, MAVERICKS 78\n\nCHICAGO — Luol Deng had 22 points and six rebounds to lead Chicago over Dallas.\n\nFive players scored at least 11 points to help the Bulls (7-7) beat the Mavericks for the fourth straight time.\n\nNate Robinson added 14 points and six assists for Chicago, and fellow reserve Jimmy Butler scored a career-high 13, including 9-of-10 shooting from the free throw line.\n\nJoakim Noah chipped in 13 points, 10 rebounds, five assists and three blocks as Chicago avoided its first three-game losing streak at the United Center since dropping five straight in March 2010.\n\nShawn Marion scored 18 points for Dallas, which shot just 35 percent to lose for the eighth time in 11 games. The Mavericks (7-9), who had won 21 of 27 against Chicago, dropped to 2-6 on the road.\n\nGRIZZLIES 103, RAPTORS 82\n\nMEMPHIS, Tenn. — Marreese Speights had 18 points and 12 rebounds to help Memphis beat Toronto for its third straight win.\n\nMarc Gasol and Zach Randolph finished with 17 points apiece, while Randolph added 13 rebounds and six assists. Mike Conley had 16 points, going 4 of 5 on 3-pointers, and Rudy Gay added 14 as the Grizzlies maintained the best record in the NBA (11-2).\n\nDeMar DeRozan led the Raptors with 16 points, while Kyle Lowry and Jose Calderon scored 12 apiece. Linas Kleiza added 11 points, but was 5 of 15 from the field, as Toronto lost its sixth straight.\n\nThe Raptors played without Andrea Bargnani, their second-leading scorer, who sat out after hurting his left ankle in Tuesday night’s loss at Houston.\n\nKNICKS 102, BUCKS 88\n\nMILWAUKEE — Carmelo Anthony scored 29 points to lead New York past Milwaukee.\n\nAnthony, who sat out the fourth quarter, was 9 of 18 from the floor and also grabbed eight rebounds in 30 minutes. The second-leading scorer in the NBA has scored at least 29 points in his last four games, including 35 points and 13 rebounds in a 96-89 overtime loss at Brooklyn on Monday.\n\nNew York’s Steve Novak added 19 points and Tyson Chandler chipped in with 17 points and eight rebounds for the Knicks, who snapped a three-game road losing streak.\n\nJason Kidd missed his second game in a row for New York with lower back spasms.\n\nMilwaukee’s Brandon Jennings and Beno Udrih each scored 18 points. The Bucks have lost four of their last five.\n\nCLIPPERS 101, TIMBERWOLVES 95\n\nLOS ANGELES — Chris Paul had 23 points and 11 assists, and Los Angeles welcomed Chauncey Billups back to the lineup for the first time this season.\n\nBillups had eight points and three assists in 20 minutes as the Clippers ended a four-game losing streak. The five-time All-Star, beginning his 16th NBA season, was sidelined for more than nine months after tearing his left Achilles’ tendon on Feb. 6 in a 107-102 victory at Orlando.\n\nBlake Griffin, who had career lows in points (four) and field goals made (one) during Monday night’s 105-98 home loss to New Orleans, had 18 points and six rebounds. Caron Butler, who scored 33 points in that game and set a franchise record with a career-high nine 3-point baskets, missed his first five shots and finished 1 for 8 with two points in 24 minutes.\n\nKevin Love had 19 points and 12 rebounds for Minnesota and is averaging 23.0 points and 15.6 boards in five games since returning from a broken right hand he sustained in the preseason.\n\nPISTONS 117, SUNS 77\n\nAUBURN HILLS, Mich. — Brandon Knight and Charlie Villanueva scored 19 points apiece, and Detroit routed Phoenix to win back-to-back games for the first time this season.\n\nDetroit is 5-3 since opening 0-8. The Pistons led 55-44 at halftime and then broke the game open when the Suns came unglued in the third quarter. Phoenix picked up four technical fouls in the third and trailed by as many as 44 in the fourth.\n\nRodney Stuckey added 18 points for Detroit. Kyle Singler and Tayshaun Prince contributed 12 each, and Greg Monroe had nine points and eight rebounds.\n\nLuis Scola scored 11 points for the Suns.\n\nThe Pistons avenged a 92-89 loss at Phoenix in early November.\n\nHAWKS 94, BOBCATS 91\n\nATLANTA — Al Horford scored 17 points and hit two clinching free throws to help Atlanta beat Charlotte for its sixth straight victory.\n\nJosh Smith and Lou Williams also had 17 points apiece for the Hawks.\n\nBen Gordon finished with 26 points and Ramon Sessions had 18 to lead Charlotte, which has lost two straight and three of four.\n\nGordon’s straightaway 3-pointer with 29.1 seconds remaining cut Atlanta’s lead to 92-91. The Bobcats got the ball back, but Sessions’ inbounds pass from the left sideline was ruled a turnover after the officials watched replays and concluded neither Gordon nor Smith touched the ball, which bounced out of bounds on the other side of the court with 5.2 seconds to go.\n\nSPURS 110, MAGIC 89\n\nORLANDO, Fla. — Manu Ginobili had 20 points, Gary Neal scored 19 and San Antonio raced past Orlando for its fifth straight win.\n\nTim Duncan added 15 points in 27 minutes and Tony Parker chipped in 14 points and eight assists.\n\nThe Spurs also posted their eighth consecutive victory on the road and have now beaten the Magic in five of their last six meetings.\n\nArron Afflalo led the Magic with 16 points, followed by Jameer Nelson with 14. The Magic struggled from the field, connecting on just two of their 15 3-point attempts.\n\nOrlando has lost two straight and concludes its season-high, five-game homestand Friday against Brooklyn.\n\nJAZZ 96, HORNETS 84\n\nNEW ORLEANS — Al Jefferson had 19 points, Marvin Williams scored 16 before leaving with concussion symptoms and Utah won its second straight game by defeating New Orleans.\n\nPaul Millsap scored nine of his 16 points during a dominant third quarter for Utah, and Gordon Hayward had 13 of his 15 points in the fourth quarter to help the Jazz overcome one last New Orleans surge.\n\nRobin Lopez and Greivis Vasquez each scored 18 points for New Orleans, which has lost eight of nine. Brian Roberts added 11 points. But the Hornets, who defeated Utah in an earlier meeting this season, struggled from 3-point range this time, going 5 of 21.\n\nUtah was a disciplined 6 of 11 from deep."
