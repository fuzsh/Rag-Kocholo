Washington Wizards center Emeka Okafor will likely be out for the team's preseason game against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Satuday. Okafor had been battling food poisoning and hasn't practiced at full speed since Tuesday. He lost 12 pounds with the illness and is working to put that back on, according to the Washington Examiner.

The flu kept Okafor out of the Wizards' first two preseason games. He came to Washington over the offseason in a trade with the Hornets that also brought Trevor Ariza in exchange for Rashard Lewis and a draft pick.

Okafor is in his eighth NBA season. He has averaged 12.7 points, 10.1 rebounds, and 1.8 blocks per game over his career. His numbers dipped last year, as he put just 9.9 points, 7.9 rebounds, and one block per game.

The Wizards are scheduled to meet the Cavaliers at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland on Saturday. The teams will tip off at 7:30 p.m. ET.
