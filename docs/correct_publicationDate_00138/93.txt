Jeff Wheeler is the Wall Street Journal bestselling author of over thirty epic fantasy novels. The Dresden Codex is the first thriller he’s written since his early years as a budding author, but his many fans think his fantasy novels are thrillers in their own way. Jeff lives in the Rocky Mountains and is a husband, father of five, and devout member of his church.
