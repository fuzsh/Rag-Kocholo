        "text": "Excerpt\n\nIn the cold and dark between stars, vacuum slid against vacuum. There was a hole in the universe, and it moved.\n\nFast. Very fast. Faster than had once been thought possible. Compared to this, photons crawled.\n\nThere is a limit to the speed at which matter can move through space. There is no limit to the speed at which space can move through space.\n\nA baby universe, so severely warped that it had become disconnected from the rest of reality, slipped between the tenuous fabric of the parent that had spawned it. The metasphere was a perfect globe of space three hundred metres across. Its parent unzipped before it to let its child pass unhindered, and zipped together behind it to seal the tear and heal a wounded continuum. The metasphere was not part of the parent universe, though born of it. What defined it was the hole where its parent temporarily failed to exist.\n\nIn three weeks the metasphere had travelled more than fourteen thousand light years, and it was now nearing the midpoint of its journey.\n\nFrom outside — from normspace, the normal universe — the metasphere was virtually undetectable. It could not be seen, for light bent round it, as if distorted by an intense gravitational field, and resumed its original path. The detour caused a slight delay, but it was imperceptible. The loss of energy would not register on the most sensitive of instruments; the phase shift would go undetected because there was nothing to compare it with. Only the distorted geodesics of spacetime could reveal the metasphere's presence, for this was curvature without matter, gravity without mass.\n\nThe only practical way to detect the metasphere was to place something in its path. The metasphere would pass unharmed, walled off from external reality inside its own spacetime bubble, but the impactee, be it an observer or an instrument, would be no more than a spreading cloud of particles ripped asunder by acute gravitational curvature, and a faint, nondescript patch of noise in the x-ray spectrum, quickly fading, submerged in the background radiation of a busy universe. But to intercept the metasphere in that manner, you had to know where it was going, which was impossible because you could not observe it.\n\nAs long as the metasphere's track stayed clear of concentrations of matter, it was undetectable.\n\nNo, there is no limit to the speed at which space can move through space — and that remains true when the moving space contains matter. This loophole in the inviolable laws of nature was what had led Omfalos to build metaspheres and the strange abscission engines that enfolded them. Now the sole limitation was the power of your engine. This one was rated for 260,000c — just over a quarter of a million times faster than light.\n\nThe metasphere, though made of space, was not empty. Inside, dwarfed by the metaspace that it generated, was an abscission engine — an enigmatic machine composed almost entirely of force fields, glowing a blue so deep and so dark that it hovered at the very limits of human visual acuity. Its shape was a disturbing mixture of angular planes and soft, molten surfaces. It rotated in three hidden dimensions of metaspacetime, so that the shape seemed to change, slowly morphing from one sinister form to another in a logic that the human mind could not intuitively comprehend.\n\nThe engine was one of a pair, but only one was active. This was standard operational procedure, the second being kept in reserve in case the first malfunctioned. Abscission engines were extremely reliable, but a failure would be catastrophic — a dying hulk marooned hundreds of light years from the nearest safe harbour with only subluminal capabilities. In mission-critical technology, redundancy equals safety.\n\nAnyway, starships were more expensive than abscission engines.\n\nOnly one region within the metasphere, an ellipsoidal cavity, remained invariant. Although embedded in metaspace, it behaved like normspace, allowing it to surround a more orthodox structure, the Omfalid corvette First Refusal. On board was a skeleton crew of eight Sweepers, an assortment of weaponry, and enough room for the thirty-two Fixers they had been sent to rescue, if any were still alive and could be found. It was a faint hope. For now, the passenger compartments were empty and dark, reverberating with strange echoes as the ship's vital gases and fluids pumped through insulated cavities between the layers of its triple hulls.\n\nSnugly enveloped by the metafield generated by its abscission engine, First Refusal floated near the centre of the metasphere, perfectly stationary, repelled by the sphere's tight geodesic curvature, safe in an impenetrable cocoon. When the abscission field powered down and the cocoon dissolved, three weeks hence… that would be another matter altogether. The crew had no idea what to expect, except that it would almost certainly be dangerous.\n\nThat was why they were there."
