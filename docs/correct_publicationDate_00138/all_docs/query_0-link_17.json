        "text": "Collected Science Fiction Reviews\n\nBy GERALD JONAS\n\nhile scientists debate the existence of even microscopic life on Mars, science fiction writers interested in extraterrestrial intelligence are turning to Jupiter. In their ambitious and entertaining novel WHEELERS (Aspect/Warner, $24.95), Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen imagine an advanced alien civilization on the fifth planet from the sun.\n\nJupiter -- a ball of hot gases that just missed igniting into a mini-star -- is certainly no place for life as we know it. The six-eared, 12-eyed, twin-mouthed ''blimps'' whose quasi-living cities float through the planet's turbulent atmosphere resemble ''half-inflated weather balloons.'' They produce a multitude of high-tech, wheeled ''biomachines'' through a process akin to human birth. They are very smart but very slow to reach decisions, perhaps not surprising for creatures that can count on living many millions of years.\n\nOver the eons, the blimps have safeguarded their home planet by nudging erratic asteroids and comets toward Earth -- a world they call ''Poisonblue'' because they are sure that its oxygen atmosphere and chloride oceans cannot support life as they know it. Even when they learn otherwise, they are in no hurry to deflect the latest comet from its collision course with earth.\n\nGetting them to change their minds in time to save humanity's home is an inherently suspenseful business. But Stewart and Cohen, who teach mathematics and biology respectively at Warwick University in England, adopt a leisurely narrative pace -- perhaps in sympathy with the deliberate Jovians. Before representatives of the two planets can confront each other, there are many subplots and counterplots. The most interesting concerns Moses Odingo, a young African with a knack for understanding animals, who is kidnapped to China where he learns street-fighting skills that prepare him to play an unexpected role in the interplanetary drama to come.\n\nHis archaeologist aunt, Prudence, also figures in the wild denouement, as does her lifelong nemesis and onetime lover, Sir Charles Dunsmoore, a master of academic politics who meets his match in the Jovian Elders, a conclave of ultraconservative bureaucrats who rejoice in such appellations as Venerable Mumblings of the Interminable Prevarication and Bulbous Purveyor of the Implausible Objection. Other players include a sect of Tibetan Zen Buddhist asteroid miners and a ratings-hungry video crew pursuing the scoop of the 23rd century.\n\nSOULSAVER (Harcourt, $24), by James Stevens-Arce, is a hard book to categorize. Although it is being marketed as science fiction and has received a prestigious European science fiction award, it is not science fiction -- at least not by any definition I would recognize.\n\nIt starts out competently enough as a kind of homage to Ray Bradbury's classic ''Fahrenheit 451,'' in which a once-zealous government book burner comes to question his calling. The protagonist of ''Soulsaver'' has a similar crisis of conscience. The time is the late 21st century. The old power centers have been superseded by a multinational Christian Alliance, which has apparently united the popular appeal of today's televangelists with the time-honored authority of the Church of Rome. Juan Bautista Lorca is an enthusiastic rookie with the Suicide Prevention Corps of America. Wielding the latest marvels of medical technology, he races around San Juan, P.R., literally resurrecting people who have risked eternal damnation by killing themselves.\n\nGoaded by a disaffected colleague, Juan Bautista begins to wonder if everything he has been taught by the church is true. If all is right in God's world, why are there so many suicides? Why does the work of his corps arouse so much resentment? And why are so many people attracted to an underground movement that claims to represent the true word of God -- as embodied in two mysterious children known as the Twin Messiahs?\n\nAlthough lampooning media-savvy religious tricksters is hardly original, Stevens-Arce has some fun satirizing an Orwellian world order in which all people are free to choose their own faith as long as it is Christian: ''There are the Christian Jews, the Christian Muslims, the Christian Buddhists, the Christian everythings. Our faith has many mansions.'' Then comes the surprise ending. While I usually go to great lengths not to give away such surprises, I make an exception here because the ending so completely violates the trust that the author has previously established with his readers.\n\nIn the final chapters, not one but several epiphanies bring God and Satan on stage for a series of heart-warming cameos. Nothing that comes before has prepared us for these revelations. They make no sense in terms of character, plot development or theology. Science fiction, in exchange for the narrative freedom it offers, demands at least lip service to the notion of a lawful natural world as interpreted by science. The supernatural may intrude on this world, but an author cannot simply repeal the laws of nature with the wave of a magic wand and expect us to cheer the arrival of his divine rabbits.\n\nTheodore Sturgeon was one of a handful of writers who helped create modern science fiction in the 1940's and 50's. Along with Robert A. Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury and Arthur C. Clarke, Sturgeon, who died in 1985, found fresh ways to wed a freewheeling imagination to the intellectual grandeur of a scientific worldview. A new volume of SELECTED STORIES (Vintage, paper, $14) puts some of his best work on display.\n\nAt a time when most science fiction focused on scientist-heroes who were either saving or menacing the world, Sturgeon wrote about ordinary people under stress. Even when his stories turned on scientific breakthroughs or technological innovations, he was more interested in how such developments affected this or that individual. A careful stylist, he was less overtly poetic than Bradbury but dealt with a wider range of emotions. When he missed the mark, he could sound preachy or sentimental. At his best, he was science fiction's Sherwood Anderson.\n\nSturgeon's passionate commitment to his characters and their obsessions propels every story collected here, from ''Thunder and Roses'' (1947) -- in which it falls to an enlisted man to decide whether the United States should retaliate against a surprise nuclear attack, even it means the end of life on earth -- to ''Slow Sculpture'' (1970), in which a maverick genius cures a young woman's cancer by what amounts to a transfer of willpower."
