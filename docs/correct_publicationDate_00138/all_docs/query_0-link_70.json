        "text": "Advertisement\n\nIt's time to get your comic head on for the fourth book in the Science of Discworld series, Judgement Day. Terry Pratchett, Professor Ian Stewart and Dr. Jack Cohen answer the toughest questions in life, the universe and everything in a comedic, tongue-in-cheek way. Known for his novels set in Discworld, Snuff, The Colour of Magic, Lords and Ladies and Reaper, but in this one, Terry Pratchett tells us the Omnians want to take control of Roundworld (Earth) as their religion is not compatible with others. The wizards of Unseen University however don't like the idea of their interfering in their world. Roundworld Librarian Marjorie Daw is catapulted into the argument with the Omnians, though she isn't the best person to debate with others on the subject of religion, god and other things, as her opinion is that they should be filed under fantasy and science fiction.\n\nLord Vetinari is the referee, and he sees the two sides exchanging insults, waiting for the insults to slowly turn into fights. Ian Stewart & Jack Cohen meanwhile get to grip with the real questions that have been baffling the theologians, the scientists and the philosophers for centuries -- how the world was created, where did humans come from, what shape is the universe and can religious folk and scientists become friends? Ian Stewart & Jack Cohen have a lot on their hands, and plenty of explaining to do, if they can actually explain world-bearing elephants, particle physics, evolutionary design, eternal inflation, dark matter and disbelief system.\n\nThe three other Science of Discworld novels have been a roaring success with fans of Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels and become Sunday Times top ten bestsellers. Sir Terry Pratchett started out with his first in the Discworld series; The Colour of Magic back in 1983 and since then his work has spanned fifty bestselling books. His novels have been adapted for stage and screen and have won prizes like The Carnegie Medal and a knighthood for services to literature. Worldwide book sales are now at 70 million and they have been translated into 37 different languages.\n\nProfessor Ian Stewart is the author of many science books, blogs and magazine articles. He is on radio and podcasts, and is a professor of mathematics at the University of Warwick. He was awarded the Michael Faraday Prize for enabling the public understanding of science and, in 2001, became a fellow of the Royal Society.\n\nDr. Jack Cohen is a reproductive biologist. He has a lab in his shed and helps couples get pregnant (by referring them to erstwhile colleagues now) and invents biologically real aliens for science fiction writers and likes to throw boomerangs. He is retired and lives in Dorset, and promotes public awareness of science and biology.\n\nThe book reads like a Pratchett novel, it's full of well written humour and hilarious footnotes and there are references to Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen in the book, but essentially it is just a chapter driven comedy which has science revealed in it about the nature of Physical Law and the Higgs boson. For anyone into science fiction and science in general, this is the sort of light-hearted book to pick up as it asks (nearly) all of the questions that many want to have answered."
