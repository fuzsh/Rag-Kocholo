Author of column, \"Mathematical Recreations,\" Scientific American, 1990-2001; editor of Manifold (a mathematics magazine). Writer and presenter of radio program Chaos!, BBC Radio, 1992.\n\nStewart's writings have been translated into Brazilian, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish.\n\nSIDELIGHTS:\n\nBritish mathematician and educator Ian Stewart is a prolific author of books on mathematics. He has written works for the academic market as well as titles that aim to explain the concepts and abstractions of math to the average lay reader. Stewart is an \"active research mathematician,\" noted his home page, and \"his present field is the effects of symmetry on dynamics, with applications to pattern formation and chaos theory in areas including animal locomotion, fluid dynamics, mathematical biology, chemical reactions, electronic circuits, computer vision, quality control of wire, and intelligent control of spring coiling machines. He takes a particular interest in problems that lie in the gaps between pure and applied mathematics.\"\n\nIn Nature's Numbers: The Unreal Reality of Mathematics, Stewart discusses how mathematicians approach their work and explains that the field is merely a system of thought: a way of looking for patterns and then exploiting those patterns. He cites examples of patterns such as the dripping of water and the spiral of a snail shell, and then explains their relation to mathematical laws. As the book progresses, Stewart leads readers toward new frontiers in math such as chaos theory. \"Stewart is the soul of clarity,\" maintained Booklist contributor Gilbert Taylor. The book also won praise from a reviewer for Publishers Weekly, who commended his \"elegant narrative\" and stated that \"Stewart gives the reader an uncanny feel for the way mathematicians think.\"\n\nStewart has written several works with Jack Cohen, a biologist and British television personality. In their first collaboration, 1994's The Collapse of Chaos: Discovering Simplicity in a Complex World, the authors discuss \"the law of nature\" question and advocate the end of scientific reductionism, a theory that \"reduc[es] behavior to the interactions of the smallest entity,\" explained Taylor in another Booklist review, and that \"has brought forth great advances in biology, chemistry, and physics.\" Stewart and Cohen argue that such thinking is now obsolete, and no new discoveries seem possible. They offer the terms \"simplexity\" and \"complicity\" instead, and along the way debunk the theory that DNA is the \"blueprint for life.\"\n\nStewart and Cohen once again teamed up for 1997's Figments of Reality: The Evolution of the Curious Mind. They assert that the human mind evolved to respond to the complexity of the natural world, posit that evolution itself is related to the evolution of the human mind, and assert that one is not possible without the other. Library Journal critic Mark L. Shelton called it \"a delightful but heavy read\" and praised the authors as \"witty, erudite, [and] clever.\"\n\nStewart's The Magical Maze: Seeing the World through Mathematical Eyes is based on a lecture he delivered at the Royal Institute in 1997. Discussing flower petals, colonies of amoeba, and swarms of flies, the mathematician argues that such natural phenomena are examples of chaos theory and symmetry in nature. \"The book patiently takes readers from seemingly bewildering random sets of numbers to the elegant principles that lie behind them,\" a Publishers Weekly reviewer remarked. Again, the author won praise for his ability to explain such concepts for the less mathematically inclined. Stewart, noted Booklist contributor Bryce Christensen, \"knows how to cast the spell over readers who normally regard\" the subject of mathematics with \"indifference or distaste.\"\n\nIn Life's Other Secret: The New Mathematics of the Living World, Stewart more fully develops his contention that DNA does not hold all the answers as to how and why life replicates itself. He maintains that the codes contained in our genes are inactive until the right combination of chemistry and physics is present. \"Nurture, in other words, is no less structured than nature, and Stewart steers us expertly through a series of beautiful examples from both the plant and animal kingdoms to prove his point,\" observed Science reviewer Sunetra Gupta. Life's Other Secret also discusses the work of D'Arcy Thompson, a forgotten zoologist who began writing about the \"geometry of life\" early in the twentieth century. Patterns in the natural world such as snowflakes and butterfly wings are not at all random, Stewart contends in writing about this geometry. Life's Other Secret earned positive reviews from several critics. \"Stewart writes with style and verve, displaying an impressive command of mathematics,\" stated Library Journal critic Gloria Maxwell, while in Booklist, Christensen remarked that the author \"writes with such compelling clarity\" that a lay reader \"can share in the intellectual daring of his perspective.\"\n\nStewart and Cohen teamed up for a literary project of a different kind with Wheelers, the first novel for both writers. In this science fiction tale, a twenty-third-century junior archaeologist named Prudence Odingo decodes a secret inscription on the Sphinx, but her colleague and former lover takes all the credit. Dismayed, she travels to Jupiter for solace, where she finds the \"wheeler,\" a gear-shaped artifact that comes to life. The presence of an unknown alien civilization becomes apparent, and Odingo realizes that they are able to redirect the orbits of Jupiter's moons. When a large comet heads toward the Earth because of this, Odingo and her former foe must divert it. This involves communicating with the blimplike beings who reside in large cities inside Jupiter's atmosphere. The aliens must be convinced that the Earth—which they have deemed \"Poisonblue\"—really does support life with its oxygen-laden atmosphere. A sect of asteroid miners who practice Tibetan Buddhism also figure into the plot, as does Odingo's nephew Moses, who possesses special abilities. A Publishers Weekly reviewer found that though Stewart and Cohen's characterizations and descriptions of a different world \"lack believability, the authors wield scientific speculation with cheerful abandon, providing some real old-fashioned sense of wonder.\" Gerald Jonas, writing in the New York Times Book Review, termed Wheelers an \"ambitious and entertaining novel,\" and Booklist contributor Eric Robbins echoed the sentiment in terming it an \"imaginative and well-written story.\"\n\nCollaborating to write another novel, Heaven, in 2004, Stewart and Cohen set a tale in the far future that focuses on two men: Second-Best Sailor and Servant-of-Unity XIV Samuel. The former is a nomadic trader from the planet of No-Moon; the latter is a missionary of Cosmic Unity, a church that wants to unite all of the races of the universe in peace. The church of Cosmic Unity's other mission is to prevent potentially dangerous, highly advanced artifacts left behind by the extinct Precursor race from falling into the hands of those who might use them as weapons; the relics are so powerful that their misuse could destroy all of civilization. While Cosmic Unity's goals are noble, their methods bring a great deal of suffering to the people of No-Moon. \"Apparently the reverse of the old saying is true,\" commented a Publishers Weekly reviewer: \"for evil to triumph, it's only necessary for good men to try to do everything.\" Although Heaven tackles big ideas, it is \"seasoned with touches of good humor,\" Don D'Ammassa noted in Science Fiction Chronicle, and provides \"a consistently pleasant journey into the imaginations of the authors.\"\n\nStewart has also created an annotated version of Edwin A. Abbott's science fiction classic Flatland, which was first published in 1884. The story is set in a two-dimensional world populated by flat geometric shapes. Here, one's social class is determined by the number of sides one's shape has. The protagonist, A. Square, is introduced to the world of three dimensions when he meets Sphere. The parable helped, in the real world, to popularize the concept being developed at the time that there might be a fourth dimension. \"Stewart's notes [in The Annotated Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions] bring a welcome new level to Abbott's classic,\" Robert K.J. Killheffer noted in the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. The notes flesh out Abbott as a person, describe how he conceived of the idea for the book, and explain the math used in the text, Killheffer explained. \"Perhaps most valuably, they place Abbott and his book solidly in their social and cultural context,\" wrote Killheffer, showing how then-prominent mathematicians and even Communist philosopher Karl Marx are connected to the tale.\n\nAround the same time he released the annotated book, Stewart published his own sequel to Flatland titled Flatterland: Like Flatland Only More So. Like the original Flatland, this book teaches mathematical concepts to a popular audience from the perspective of a geometric shape with a human mind—in this case, Victoria \"Vikki\" Line, who is the great-great-granddaughter of A. Square. Stewart covers many new theories about geometry, space, and time that have been developed since 1884, including superstring theory, the idea that there may be as many as ten dimensions, relativity, black holes, and quantum mechanics. \"The breadth of material is astonishing,\" Michael Goldberg wrote in Isis. Stewart also scatters humor and pop-cultural references throughout his tale, including allusions to Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, the British pop group the Spice Girls, and the film The Wizard of Oz. With the combination of science and humor, \"Flatterland provides an engaging, completely accessible guide to some of the trickiest concepts in contemporary mathematics,\" concluded a Science News reviewer.\n\nHow to Cut a Cake: And Other Mathematical Conundrums contains a collection of Stewart's mathematics columns from Scientific American. The pieces in this book appeared between 1987 and 2001, and in total they offer a mathematical view of some perplexing everyday puzzles as well as mathematical theory and the application of math to modern technology. \"Stewart is one of the finest popular maths writers out there, and he does not disappoint with this latest offering,\" commented Lewis Dartnell on the Plus magazine Web site. Stevens considers subjects such as the reasons behind why the telephone cord always seems to become tangled; the sophisticated application of mathematics in online security and data encryption; the testing of circuit boards; chess games that never end; efficient ways of lacing up shoes; and more. The title piece addresses the well-known problems of cutting a cake so that all diners are content that they have received a fair and equitable portion. Dartnell called the book a \"smorgasbord of tasty morsels\" and named each essay a \"delightful description of a particular puzzle in mathematics.\"\n\nIn Letters to a Young Mathematician, Stewart offers academic insight, professional wisdom, and career advice from a fictitious mathematician to his niece, Meg, a young (but imaginary) American student struggling with questions of career and direction. The letters provide counsel to Meg at critical stages in her progress toward becoming a professional mathematician, covering her initial decision to enter the field, her pursuit of higher education, and her first forays into the professional world of teaching and research. Throughout the twenty-one essays, Stewart offers insight derived from his own extensive experiences. He covers practical matters such as the learning and teaching of math, methods for approaching math problems, and balancing the professional demands of research and teaching. He also considers more theoretical and abstract concepts, such as the constant presence of mathematics in the everyday world, the nature of several prominent mathematical problems, and the broad sweep of mathematics as it touches on theology and metaphysics. The collection \"contains something of interest for everyone, from the young mathematician of the title to anyone who is curious about the subject,\" noted Plus magazine Web site reviewer Marianne Freiberger. Stewart \"offers a remarkable insight into how mathematics opens up unique understandings of nature,\" observed P.D. Smith in the Guardian (London, England). Reviewer K. Soundararajan, writing in American Scientist, concluded: \"Stewart's book may be heartily recommended to any young person considering a future in the field, and indeed to anyone with more than a passing interest in mathematics or mathematicians.\" Though the book is aimed at those considering a career in math, \"others simply interested in learning about the field and how mathematicians think will find it compelling reading,\" noted a Publishers Weekly contributor.\n\nStewart considers the ancient and elegant mathematical concepts behind symmetry in Why Beauty Is Truth: A History of Symmetry. Symmetry, Stewart explains, is a method of transforming and moving an object so that it remains largely unchanged in appearance after its transformation—the object changes, but its basic structure is preserved. Symmetry, in addition, provides balance among the forces of the universe. In the book, Stewart delves deeply into the mathematical history behind symmetry, tracing some of its first manifestations to the quadratic equations developed by ancient Babylonian mathematicians. He provides biographical information on numerous important figures in the development of symmetry, from young French mathematical genius Evariste Galois, who invented group theory but was killed at age twenty-one in a duel, to Albert Einstein and modern quantum physicists who use symmetry, group theory, and other associated concepts to describe the vast beauty and complexity of the universe. Booklist reviewer Bryce Christensen called the book \"an exciting foray for any armchair physicist,\" while American Scientist writer David W. Farmer named it a \"reasonably entertaining story about the history of symmetry\" and related ideas. \"Anyone who thinks math is dull will be delightfully surprised by this history of the concept of symmetry,\" commented a Publishers Weekly contributor.\n\nStewart once told CA: \"As a child I always enjoyed both writing and mathematics. My father once found an old typewriter in a bank vault, and I and my circle of friends spent a lot of time using it to produce such items as a humorous dictionary of mathematics, a humorous epic poem some 500 verses long, and rules for new card games. I was also interested in science, especially physics, and I devoured Scientific American and New Scientist. I was an avid fan of Martin Gardner's ‘Mathematical Games’ column in Scientific American and compiled a lengthy series of notebooks on mathematical recreations.\n\n\"An offer to study mathematics at Churchill College, Cambridge, settled my future career, but I continued writing as a sideline. I edited (and wrote large chunks of) student mathematics magazines at Cambridge and Warwick. My first ‘real’ book was Galois Theory, a textbook that [was] still in print after [two decades]. Soon after, I wrote up an extramural lecture series as Concepts of Modern Mathematics, a first attempt at writing for a ‘lay’ audience. For some reason, I was sidetracked into writing textbooks. I was rescued from this blind alley by two things. The first was the craze for personal computers. With a friend, I began writing a series of books about how to program the beasts, at a peak rate of one book every six weeks. The second was a suggestion from Ravi Mirchandani at Penguin Books that I should write a popular book on ‘chaos theory.’ The result was Does God Play Dice? The Mathematics of Chaos, which … has been translated into nine foreign languages.\n\n\"My fingers start to itch unless they are somewhere near a word processor keyboard. I find it difficult to take the world seriously—how could any rational mind make sense of it?—and much of my output has humorous aspects. I have written and drawn three comic books on mathematics which were published in French. As the writer of the ‘Mathematical Recreations’ column in Scientific American, I incorporate mathematical ideas into brief stories with improbable characters, such as the Worm family—father Henry, mother Anna-Lida, baby Wermentrude, and friend Albert Wormstein. I believe that it is possible to be serious about science without being solemn. I am afflicted with an evangelical streak which drives me to explain to the rest of the world those parts of mathematics and science that, at any given moment, I find interesting. I am attracted to writing because it's the only way you can have fun, improve the sum total of human understanding, and make money all at the same time. But mostly I write because my head is filled with sequences of words, trying desperately to get out.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nAmerican Scientist, May-June, 2007, K.
