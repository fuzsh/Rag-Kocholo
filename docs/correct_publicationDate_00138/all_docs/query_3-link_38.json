        "text": "Edwin A. Abbott was born in London on December 20, 1838. Educated in St. John's College in Cambridge, he was ordained in 1862 and three years later was appointed headmaster of the City of London School, where he served until 1889. Abbott wrote over fifty books, most of them scholarly works. He died in Hampstead on October 12, 1926. Ian Stewart is Professor of Mathematics at the University of Warwick and Director of its Mathematics Awareness Centre. His many books include Why Beauty Is Truth, Nature's Numbers, Does God Play Dice?, and Letters to a Young Mathematician. He lives in Warwick, England."
