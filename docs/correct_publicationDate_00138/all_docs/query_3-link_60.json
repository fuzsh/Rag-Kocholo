        "text": "MURDERED author Helen Bailey hauntingly ended her book about coping with the loss of her first husband and finding love with the man who would go on to kill her with the words \"and they all lived happily ever after\" .\n\nEvil Ian Stewart - dubbed by Helen the \"Gorgeous Grey Haired Widower\" - was jailed for life this week for the murder of his millionaire fiancée after dumping her body in a cesspit below her home.\n\nThe pair had met on an online Facebook bereavement group, moving in together with Stewart's children and becoming engaged.\n\nHelen wrote a book after a blog she had posted about coping with the loss of her first husband JS inspired bereaved readers.\n\nAt the conclusion of the book, titled 'When bad things happen in good bikinis', she speaks of her hope for a new life with Stewart.\n\nIn an extract published in the Daily Mail today she wrote: \"So here I am, in Royston. It’s not that I don’t like living here — far from it — it’s just that \"I’m a London girl. I’m still shell-shocked that my life after JS’s death is so different from my life before it, and it’s taking time to adjust.\n\n\"My life here is good — not all rainbows and puppies, but then that’s life, widowed or not.\"\n\nShe goes on to tell how one of Stewart's children advised she should end the book \"and they all lived happily ever after\" after she confessed difficulties finding a way to finish it.\n\nEvil killer Stewart - driven into a jealous fury by the children's author's miniature dachshund - faces death behind bars after being found guilty of the greed-fuelled plot to get his hands on her £3.3million.\n\nIan Stewart was driven into a jealous fury by his fiancée’s miniature dachshund, pals have revealed\n\nStewart, who refused to attend sentencing, was jailed for at least 34 years after being convicted of tragic Helen's murder.\n\nJudge Andrew Bright told him: \"Helen Bailey was excitedly making arrangements for your wedding while you were planning how to kill her.\n\n\"You planned her murder well in advance and secretly administered zopiclone tablets to her so you could smother her when she was too drowsy to fight you off.\"\n\nSimon Russell Flint, defending, said during his mitigation: \"The likelihood is, given his state of health, the sentence has a like-effect of a whole-life order.\n\n\"There is every prospect and likelihood Mr Stewart will end his days behind bars.\"\n\nThe judge slammed Stewart for the financially-motivated murder of fiancee Helen.\n\nHe told St Albans Crown Court: \"Helen Bailey was only 51-years old and at the height of her success as a writer when you brought her life to a cruel end and dumped her body and that of her beloved dog Boris in a foul-smelling cess-pit to decompose.\n\n\"I am satisfied that your principal motive for killing her was to enable you to take advantage of the generous provision she had made for you in the event of her death which you knew the law would presume after she had remained a missing person for long enough.\n\n\"In the meantime and within a few hours of her murder you used your knowledge of her financial affairs and your computer expertise to substantially increase an existing standing order from her personal bank account to enable you to have immediate access to some of her money.\"\n\nI am firmly of the view that you currently pose a very real danger to women with whom you form a relationship\n\nJudge Andrew Bright QC\n\nJudge Bright added: \"You knew Helen Bailey to be a wealthy woman but were not content with having to share in her wealth as her husband.\n\n\"Instead you wanted it all for yourself. She had assets well in excess of £3 million and had taken out a life insurance policy in the sum of a further £1.28 million which you stood to receive in the event of her death.\n\n\"I am firmly of the view that you currently pose a very real danger to women with whom you form a relationship.\"\n\nQuestions are now being raised by the family of the 56-year-old's first wife Diane after they told of their fears over her sudden death in 2010.\n\nSpeaking to The Telegraph the relative, who did not want to be named, revealed Stewart hadn't even allowed Diane's mum to see her death certificate.\n\nThey said: \"We were told at the time it was an unexplained death and it has worried me, it has been on my mind that it was unexplained.\"\n\nThe relative added: “He [Stewart] was the only one there when she died… I know her brother and sister have been very concerned.\n\n\"Diane's mother never knew how she died, he never showed her Diane's death certificate even when she requested it and he just said it was unexplained.\"\n\nStewart preyed on wealthy widow Helen, who was still grieving over the sudden drowning death of her husband, \"love-bombing\" her by showering her with compliments.\n\nThe pair became secretly engaged just a year after meeting - but their relationship had been orchestrated from the very beginning.\n\nThe Cambridge-educated software engineer had been playing \"the long game\" to get her almost £4million estate.\n\nThe plot, which prosecutors said had a \"beginning, middle and end\", then began to unfold, as Stewart, branded as \"wicked\" and a \"full-blown liar\", secretly plied his besotted lover with sleeping pills.\n\nPolice say he may have snuck them into the scrambled eggs he made his fiancee in the mornings.\n\nThe Sun revealed how friends said the 56-year-old dad-of-two was “fed up” with the attention lavished on her beloved pedigree dog.\n\nThey told how Helen, 51, would even sign Stewart’s name last on Christmas cards — after that of Boris.\n\nStewart is said to have smothered Helen, using a duvet to drag her body out to the garage and dumping the body of the woman he had promised to marry in the human excrement.\n\nTo complete the plot, he also threw in the body of Helen's beloved dachshund Boris - with the author never having gone anywhere without the pet.\n\nThe pair had met on a Facebook group for the bereaved, starting a relationship within a year of Ms Bailey's first husband drowning while on holiday.\n\nBut duped Bailey, who had nicknamed her fiance \"GGHW\" - Gorgeous Grey Haired Widower - had slowly begun to realise something was wrong.\n\nShe had begun searching on the Internet reasons why she was struggling to stay awake, even unable to recognise her own hands.\n\nStewart knew it would only be a matter of time before Helen went to her GP with her concerns.\n\nPolice say the plan came to a head on April 11.\n\nWith the existence of the cesspit known only to a few people, and Stewart planning to park his car over the entrance to ensure it was hidden, all he had to do was call the police and act as the bereaved fiance.\n\nHe had sent her text messages and called her, pleading for her to come home and told police he never stopped loving her.\n\nPolice launched appeal after appeal for the author, searching the area and checking her final movements online.\n\nBut putting together the clues, including that money was being transferred out of Helen's account into their shared account where Stewart would have access to it, cops arrested the 56-year-old.\n\nFour days later, on July 15, officers checked the cesspit.\n\nOpening up the hole below the Royston home, they found Helen's arm sticking out of the excrement.\n\nStewart, who had already slipped up beforehand, accidentally speaking about Ms Bailey in the past tense, was charged with murder and remanded in Bedford Prison to await his trial.\n\nOn December 12 last year, five months after the discovery of Helen's body, the Crown Prosecution Service finally received the defence case statement in which Stewart said two mysterious men he named only \"Joe\" and \"Nick\" had murdered Helen Bailey and disposed of her body in the cesspit\n\nBut more holes appeared in his story.\n\nStewart had claimed that Helen had taken her phone with her when she went missing.\n\nIt was why he had sent her text messages pleading with her to come back or at least contact him.\n\nOn April 16 Stewart, playing the role of the anxious partner desperate for news, had gone to the cottage in Broadstairs supposedly to check the property himself.\n\nBut while Stewart had removed the phone's SIM card, ensuring it wouldn't connect to the phone network, it was revealed that the phone had connected to a wireless router at Helen's Broadstairs property that same day.\n\nWhen police tried to examine the router again - they found it was no longer there - and was instead at the Royston home - with all the information found earlier gone.\n\nJohn Bailey, Helen's brother, revealed the true cost of the final judgement, saying: \"Despite this victory for justice, there can be no celebration.\n\n\"Our families have been devastated and nothing can ever bring Helen back to us, or truly right this wrong.\n\n\"A long shadow of loss has been cast over the lives of so many who will always remember Helen with enduring love and affection.\"\n\nFollowing the sentence Helen’s elderly mum Eileen, 89, who lives with husband George, 91, in Ponteland, Northumberland, said: \"My son rang to tell me the sentence and that he had been jailed for 34 years.\n\n\"That's good and yes it's true that he will spend the rest of his life in jail.\n\n\"But whilst we are glad that justice has been done it's little help because of course it does not bring Helen back, nothing can do that.\n\n\"There will be no sense of putting it behind us and no feeling of starting again or looking to the future, we are too old for that.\n\n\"My husband suffers dementia but I'm afraid he knows only too well what has happened, he still looks at the photographs of Helen and has a weep.\n\n\"There was little the court could have done to change that.\""
