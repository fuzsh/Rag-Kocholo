As always, he explains complicated mathematical ideas brilliantly.and#8221;\n\nThe Guardian\n\nand#147;A timely account of why biologists and mathematicians are hooking up at last.... Stewart is Britain's most brilliant and prolific populariser of mathematics.... Mathematics of Life is dense with information, written with Stewart's characteristic lightness of touch and will please the dedicated maths reader.... [T]he book is a testament to the versatility of maths and how it is shaping our understanding of the world.and#8221;\n\nDiscover\n\nand#147;It is difficult to find many biologists who enjoy math, or vice versa, but British number cruncher Ian Stewart successfully crosses over. Here he argues that solving some of the biggest scientific mysteries, including lifeand#8217;s origins and prevalence in the universe, hinges on a union of these fields. He skillfully recasts the history of biology within a mathematical contextand#133;then applies his left-brained perspective to the hot new field of astrobiology.

Stewart is great at communicating wonder, but itand#8217;s often his skepticism that makes The Mathematics of Life such an enjoyable readand#151;you get the sense that as a man who fully grasps numbers, he doesnand#8217;t take kindly to how frequently they are abused in mainstream treatments of science.and#8221;\n\nScience News\n\nand#147;In this engaging overview, a mathematician describes how the field of biomathematics is answering key questions about the natural world and the origins of life.and#8221;\n\nChoice"
