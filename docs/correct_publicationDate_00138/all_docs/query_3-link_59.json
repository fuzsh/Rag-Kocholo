        "text": "Description\n\nTaming the Infinite by Ian Stewart\n\n‘Mathematics’, writes Ian Stewart, ‘is often permanent.’ The methods invented by the ancient Babylonians to solve problems are still used today. And yet, more new maths is created every week than the Babylonians managed in two thousand years. Mathematics underpins almost every aspect of our lives, good or ill, from television and medical scanners to guided missiles, and yet few of us could understand the relevant calculations. Mathematics has an immense influence on human culture, but its history has been all too frequently neglected.\n\nIn this clear and accessible book, Ian Stewart sets out to explain the most significant building blocks for the lay reader. Starting with the invention of written symbols to denote numbers, he takes us through fascinating calculations related to shape and space, stretching from Euclid’s geometry all the way to the irregular patterns of chaos theory. There are fascinating asides on key mathematicians, not only giants like Galileo, Newton and Klein, but less well-known pioneers such as Marie-Sophie Germain who, in the early 1800s, wrote papers under a male pen-name, and Hypatia, head of the Platonist school in Alexandria, who was torn apart by a Christian mob – possibly because her mathematical work was regarded as witchcraft. Stewart is always careful to tie mathematics into the applications we make of it – from deducing the size of our planet to coding our communications.\n\nFeatures;\n\nFolio Society First Impression\n\nPublisher Folio Society, London; 2012\n\nGrey Cloth Hardback, 325 pp\n\nFrontispiece and 24 pages of colour plates\n\nSize 240 x 160mm, 1.2kg\n\nCondition: Fine – Superb Unmarked Copy\n\n5 Good Reasons To BUY NOW !!!\n\nFREE UK Delivery, Overseas Postage at Reduced Rate\n\nSuperfast Delivery – I always try to post within 24 hrs of payment to ensure you get your book(s) as quickly as possible.\n\nProfessional Packaging – I always use Top Quality packaging products to ensure you receive your item in the condition it was sent.\n\nMember of IOBA – “The books you want…from sellers you can trust”, www.ioba.org\n\n100% Satisfaction Guaranteed – If you are not 100% satisfied with your book then simply return it for a refund\n\nHCBOOKSONLINE Love Books – Love My Website\n\nIf you require any further information please email me."
