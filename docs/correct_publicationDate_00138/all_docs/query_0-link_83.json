I put it together in 1975, but of course it incorporates numerous pieces that have been around for a very long time. Like everything in science, this new geometry has very, very deep and long roots. Benoît B. Mandelbrot Introduction This enhanced and expanded edition of THE COLOURS OF INFINITY features an additional chapter on the money markets by the fractal master himself, Professor Benoît Mandelbrot. The DVD of the film associated with this book has been re-mastered especially for this edition with exquisite new fractal animations, which will take your breath away! Driven by the curious enthusiasm that engulfs many fractalistas, in 1994, Nigel Lesmoir-Gordon overcame enormous obstacles to raise the finance for, then shoot and edit the groundbreaking TV documentary from which this book takes its name. The film has been transmitted on TV channels in over fifty countries around the world. This book is not just a celebration of the discovery of the Mandelbrot set, it also brings fractal geometry up to date with a gathering of the thoughts and enthusiasms of the foremost writers and researchers in the field. As Ian Stewart makes clear in the opening chapter, there were antecedents for fractal geometry before 1975 when Mandelbrot gave the subject its name and began to develop the underlying theory. It took the genius of Mandelbrot, allied with the computer power available to him at IBM, to realize the practicality, beauty and fascination in the subject, and to act as its propagator through a long and influential career. The first chapter by Benoît Mandelbrot in this book is based on a paper delivered before a Nobel Conference in Stockholm called A Geometry Able to Include Mountains and Clouds. The breadth of his vision, extend- ing from mathematics to economics, from art to language, is extraordinary. As several of the contributors note, once you take a fractal view of the universe, you see the evidence everywhere – in water, in clouds, in trees, in art (see Rood’s chapter), in the human body and in the workings of the World Wide Web (Flake and Pennock). Mandelbrot’s second chapter, Fractal Financial Fluctuations looks deeply into the fractal nature of the growth and collapse of financial prices. His radically new fractal modelling techniques cast a whole new light of order into the seemingly impenetrable thicket of the financial markets. The article by Arthur C. Clarke is a special case. Its 4,000 or so words are a lucid miniature of scientific popularization, reflecting the excitement fractal geometry induces in so many of its converts. It also, as Nigel\n\n13. Lesmoir-Gordon explains in his account of how the film came to be made, offered a link between himself and Clarke, the film’s anchor, and lent its name to the film project itself. Four of the film’s contributors (Stewart, Clarke, Mandelbrot and Barnsley) have chapters in the book. Rood, Flake and Pennock, as well as Nigel Lesmoir-Gordon, the film’s begetter, contribute original chapters specifically for this volume. Using a metaphor of a random soccer game, Michael Barnsley with his wife Louisa, the originators of fractal image compression technology, present the ideas of fractal transformation and colour stealing using random iteration for the first time. Will Rood takes the animation of fractals into a new area by explaining how the M-set is coloured and then how the strange reptiles of Dutch conceptual artist M. C. Escher (1898–1972), the ‘undisputed master of tessellated art’, can be mapped onto the exterior of quadratic fractals, allowing the creation of tessellation with fractal limits. Gary Flake and David Pennock propose an ‘optimistic and realistic’ interpretation of the NFL (‘no free lunch’) theory as a key to understanding the current state of the World Wide Web and how it will evolve over time. Given its huge traffic and lack of central authority, the Web could have been infinitely complex, but it is in fact exceedingly regular; and this regularity can be exploited to make more effective algorithms for finding information on the Web. The Colours of Infinity brings together all the leading names in the fractal geometry field. Between them the contributors have published at least 200 books under their own names, and in collaboration. You will feel in their articles an ease with communicating sometimes difficult abstract concepts and an urge to share the powerful meanings their insights into the world of fractals have for all of us. In terms of positive energy and commitment to the subject they are a persuasive community. The last chapter of this collection is unusual in that it sets out the full shooting script of the film, with audio and spoken word alongside. This may well prove invaluable source material in, for example, the educational use of the film, which has gradually increased over the decade or so since the film’s release. The Colours of Infinity, the movie, made with so much evident pleasure, is approaching cult status and now gains a new lease of life by being coupled with this stimulating collection, expanding the film’s concerns still further. The soundtrack of the DVD, with Pink Floyd’s David Gilmour’s soaring guitar almost an aural fractal in its own right, is totally accessible, as are Will Rood’s beautifully coloured animations of the fractals. The music and the images together have become club and garage favourites, and it is easy to understand why. Is it too far fetched to see in this harmonious matching of sound and image a tribute to the way Stanley Kubrick handled them in the Stargate sequence of his science fiction masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey? – a powerful link back to Arthur C. Clarke. One of the many strange thoughts that the M-set generates is this. In principle, it could have been discovered as soon as the human race learned to count. In practice, since even a low magnification image may involve billions of calculations, there was no way in which it could even be glimpsed before computers were invented. Sir Arthur C. Clarke\n\n14.

Ian Stewart is Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at ­ Warwick University. In 1995 he was awarded the Royal Society’s Michael Faraday Medal for furthering the public understand- ing of science. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2001, and won the Public Understanding of Science and ­ Technology Award of the American Association for the ­ Advancement of Science in 2002. He is the author of over 60 books including Nature’s Numbers, Does God Play Dice?, Figments of Reality, The Magical Maze, Life’s Other Secret, What Shape is a Snowflake?, Evolving the Alien, the best-sellers The Science of Discworld I and II (with Terry Pratchett and Jack Cohen), and the US best-seller Flatterland. He has also written a science fiction novel, Wheelers (with Jack Cohen). 1 TheNature ofFractal Geometry Ian Stewart Fractals are more than just stunning visual effects – they open up new ways to model nature and allow us to quantify terms like ‘irregular’, ‘rough’ and ‘complicated’, writes mathematician Ian Stewart. His chapter does a service to the non-specialist reader in giving a largely non-technical introduction to fractal geometry in the context of mathematical traditions and its commercial appli- cations. Stewart shows both how concepts like fractal dimension have a lengthy prehistory and also how Mandelbrot brought to the subject a systematic treatment, uniting theory and application. Mandelbrot’s most important contribution to fractal geometry, Stewart suggests, ‘was the realization that there was a subject’. N.

The concept existed, but the name was not coined until about 1975. Today, almost eve- ryone has heard of fractals, and probably has a mug or a T-shirt or a poster somewhere around the house with one of the remarkable, intricate computer images that the word brings to mind. The impor- tance of fractals, however, goes well beyond their visual attractiveness. What makes them so useful in today’s scientific research is that they have opened up entirely new ways to model nature. They give scientists a powerful tool with which to understand processes and structures hitherto described merely as ‘irregular’, ‘intermittent’, ‘rough’, or ‘complicated’. What is a fractal? As a first, broad-brush descrip- tion: it is a geometric form that possesses detailed structure on a wide range of scales. Think of the rocky slopes of a mountain, the proliferating fronds of a fern, and the fluffy outline of a cloud. These are physical objects: ‘fractal’ is a mathematical concept, and it relates to the real world in the same man- ner that ‘sphere’ relates to the shape of the Earth and ‘spiral’ relates to the shape of a snail shell. A mathematical fractal idealizes the intricacy of rocks and clouds: it has detailed structure on all scales. However much it is magnified, it does not ‘flatten out’ into a simple shape like a line or a plane. Mathematical objects are idealized models of certain features of the real world; they are not real things, and they do not correspond exactly to real things. The Earth is not a perfect sphere; even allow- ing for its bulging equator, it is not a perfect ellipsoid either, even though many astronomy and earth sci- ence textbooks describe it that way. It has mountain ranges that give it a rough surface, unlike the infinite smoothness of the mathematical ideal. However, this type of inaccuracy does not stop scientists modelling the Earth as a sphere. In fact, the great advantage of a sphere as a model, for many purposes, is that it does not represent the intricacies of the real planet exactly. If it did, it would be no more use than a map of New York that is the same size as New York, with every traffic-light, doorstep, and cat rendered in perfect detail. A map must be simpler than the territory. Models are tailored to suit particular objectives. If the objective is to understand mountain-building, then it is pointless to assume that the Earth is a smooth sphere. But if the objective is the long-term behaviour of the solar system, then a sphere is entirely acceptable, and a ‘point mass’ – even further from physical reality, since it assumes the Earth’s diam- eter is zero – may well be better. In the same way, a mathematical fractal has detailed structure on scales so fine that they subdivide atoms – indeed, on scales finer than the Planck Length, at which level the uni- verse becomes lumpy instead of smooth and ‘distance’ makes no sense. This discrepancy with the real world does not make fractals useless or irrelevant. As with the sphere and the map, what matters is the extent to which the model illuminates reality, not the extent to which it copies reality. Fractals make it possible to quantify terms like ‘irregular’, ‘intermittent’, ‘rough’, and ‘complicated’. How rough? 1.59 rough or 2.71 rough? Fractal geom- etry gives such statements a meaning, and makes it possible to test them in experiments. Mathematics provides a number, associated with each frac- tal, called its fractal dimension. The dimension reflects, among other things, the scaling properties of the fractal – how its structure changes when it is magnified. Unlike the traditional smooth curves and surfaces of much mathematical physics and applied mathematics, the dimension of a fractal need not be a whole number. It can, for example, be 1.59 or 2.71. The universe is full of fractals. Indeed it may even be one.\n\n18. 5 The Nature of Fractal Geometry The term ‘fractal’ was introduced by Mandelbrot, but many of the subject’s oncepts – notably fractal dimension – have a lengthy prehistory. Mandelbrot’s contributions to the subject have been many, but the most important was the realization that there was a subject. In fact, the difference between the fractal dimension of a geometric shape and its dimension in the usual ‘topological’ sense of mathematics provides a quanti- tative measure of just how rough the fractal is. The notion of a fractal was brought to scien- tific prominence by Benoît Mandelbrot in 1975, and promoted in his book Fractals: Form, Chance, and Dimension of 1977. A revised edition appeared in 1982 under the title The Fractal Geometry of Nature. The term ‘fractal’ was introduced by Mandelbrot, but many of the subject’s concepts – notably fractal dimension – have a lengthy prehistory. Mandelbrot’s contributions to the subject have been many, but the most important was the realization that there was a subject. Mathematicians had studied spaces of non-integer dimension long before Mandelbrot; sci- entists had observed scaling laws and self-similarities in natural phenomena. But a systematic treatment, uniting theory and application, was lacking. Now, some thirty years later, the theory that was stimulated by Mandelbrot’s insight is thriving. A glance through the leading scientific journals, such as Nature and Science, will make it clear that fractals have become a standard technique of scientific mod- elling in a wide variety of areas. The mere existence of fractal structures immediately suggests a wide range of physical and mathematical questions, by directing our attention away from the classical obsession with smooth curves and surfaces. What happens to light waves passing through a medium whose refractive index is fractally distributed? Reflected in a fractal mirror? What sounds will a drum make if it has a fractal boundary? Traditional methods have little to say about such questions. The importance of fractals Are they important? Undoubtedly. Turbulence in the atmosphere makes it difficult for Earth-based telescopes to produce accurate images of stars; a turbulent atmosphere is well modelled by a fractal distribution of the refractive index. Light bounc- ing off the ocean, with its myriad waves on many scales, closely resembles reflection from a fractal mirror. And the way trees absorb energy from the wind is closely related to the ‘vibrational modes’ of a fractal – and it is such modes that create the sound of a drum. The natural world provides an inexhaust- ible supply of important problems in fractal physics. Already, technological and commercial advances have stemmed from such questions – for example, a compact antenna for mobile phones, new ways to analyse the movements of the stock market, and efficient methods to compress the data in computer images, squeezing more pictures onto a CD. Once our eyes have been opened to the fact that fractal objects possess a distinctive character and structure, and are not just irregular or random, it becomes obvious that the universe is full of fractals. Indeed, it may even be one. Fractals teach us not to confuse complexity with irregularity, and they open our eyes to new possibilities. Fractals represent an entire new regime of mathematical modelling, which science is just beginning to explore.\n\n19. 6 The Colour of Infinity Gallery of monsters The prehistory of fractals The prehistory of fractals goes back over a hundred years, to when mathematicians began thinking about new kinds of curves and surfaces, totally dif- ferent from the shapes typically studied in classical geometry. The classical shapes are lines and planes, cones and spheres, curves and surfaces – and, except for the occasional edge or corner, these curves and surfaces are smooth and very well behaved. Smoothness in effect implies that they have no interesting small-scale structure: when magnified sufficiently, they appear flat and featureless. This absence of structure on small scales is crucial to clas- sical ‘limiting’ analysis – the time-honoured methods of the calculus, which go back to Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz. The very methodology of the calculus, the central technique of physics for more than two centuries, is to approximate a curve by its tangent line, a surface by its tangent plane. This approach simply will not work on a highly irregular curve or surface. Nevertheless, we can imagine highly irregular curves. Originally these were seen as ‘pathological’ objects whose purpose was to exhibit the limitations of analysis. They were counter-examples, serving to remind us that the capacity of mathematics for nasti- ness is unbounded. The pure mathematician’s motto is Murphy’s Law: ‘Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.’ And the wise mathematician or scientist always wants to know what can go wrong. Often this is a starting-point for finding new ways for things to go right. For example, during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries it was wide- ly assumed that any continuous curve must have a well-defined tangent (that is, any continuously varying quantity must have a well-defined instantaneous rate of change) at ‘almost’ any point. The only exceptions were the corners, where the curve makes an abrupt change of direction. However, in a lecture to the Berlin Academy in 1872, Karl Weierstrass showed that this is not true. It is, in fact, about as false as it is possible to get. He described a class of curves that are continuous, but have no points where the tangent is well defined. The basic idea is to add together infinitely many increasingly tiny ‘wiggles’. The resulting curve is continuous – it has no gaps – but it wiggles so rapidly that there is no sensible way to construct a tangent. Anywhere. Again, in 1890 Giuseppe Peano constructed a curve that passes through every point of the interior of a unit square. This curve demonstrated the com- plete inadequacy of the common idea of ‘dimension’ as the number of (continuously varying) parameters needed to specify a point. Peano’s curve takes a square, with its two dimensions and standard para- metrization by two coordinates (north–south and east–west), and reparametrizes it by a single variable: how far you have to go along Peano’s curve in order to hit a given point. In 1906 Helge von Koch gave an example of a curve of infinite length that bounds a finite area: the snowflake. (Fig. 1.1) It is constructed by starting with an equilateral triangle, and erecting on each side a smaller triangle, one-third the size. This construction is repeated to infinity. Like Weierstrass’s curve, the snowflake is continuous but has no tangent. A similar repetitive process occurs in the construction of one of the simplest and most fundamental pathological sets of all: the Cantor Set, named for Georg Cantor who used it in 1883 (although it was known to Henry Smith in 1875). It is constructed by repeated dele- tions of the middle third of an interval. (Fig. 1.2) The mathematical community – even leading figures – found it hard to come to terms with these unsettling discoveries. Henri Poincaré dismissed\n\n20. 7 The Nature of Fractal Geometry them as ‘a gallery of monsters’, and Charles Hermite deplored what he called a ‘lamentable plague of functions with no derivatives’. More recently Jean Dieudonné wrote: ‘Some mathematical objects, like the Peano curve, are totally non-intuitive ... extrava- gant.’ But Dieudonné was not suggesting they lacked interest, just that they were difficult to wrap your head round. It is only fair to add that the undue proliferation of such sets, without any clear purpose in mind, can easily become an exercise in futility. So Poincaré and Hermite did have some basis for their complaints. But as time passed, most mathematicians came to accept that these sets play a legitimate, indeed crucial, role in mathematics: they demonstrate that there are limits to the applicability of classical analysis. In fact, this realization stimulated the development of new kinds of non-classical analysis, which turned out to be important in their own right. Indeed by 1900 the great German mathematician David Hilbert could refer to the whole area as a ‘paradise’ without causing ructions. Nonetheless, many math- ematicians were perfectly prepared to operate within the classical limits. They saw the ‘pathologies’ as ‘artificial’ objects, unlikely to be of any importance in the study of Nature. Nature, however, had other ideas. Fig. 1.1 To a casual observer this is a snowflake, but math- ematically it is a classic fractal shape, constructed out of one equilateral triangle, with the middle third of each side removed and new equilateral triangles drawn out to the edge, their middle third removed, smaller triangles drawn out in turn, and so on. Fig.1.2 The Cantor Set:first developed in 1883,it is construct- ed by repeated deletions of the middle third of an interval.\n\n21. 8 The Colour of Infinity How long is the coast of Britain? The fractal geometry of coastlines One of the formative examples of fractals is the geometry of coastlines. In particular: how long is a coastline? Coastlines are notoriously irregular, and the answer to the question depends on how the measurement is made. The simplest method is to take a fixed finite length x and move along the coast- line in steps of length x. Adding these steps together gives a total length L(x). (Fig. 1.3) If the coastline is smooth, in the rigorous mathe- matical sense, then when x is small enough, the coast- line is very close to a straight line. For a straight line, the value of L(x) tends to a definite limit L as x tends to zero, and that limit is the length of the straight line in the usual sense. It follows that if the coastline is a smooth curve, L(x) also tends to a definite limit L as x tends to zero, and that limit is the length of the curve in the usual sense. In other words, if x is small enough, L(x) is an approximation to the total length that is close enough on the scale of the model chosen. What actually happens, with real coastlines, is quite different. Small bays of diameter smaller than x are missed by the stepping procedure. Although reducing the value of x must in some sense improve Fig. 1.3 Mapping a coastline: the actual length depends on how many steps of length x one takes. If x = 1 km the length will be considerably less than if the length were 1 m;and this will be far less than steps of 1 cm; and so to infinity.\n\n22. 9 The Nature of Fractal Geometry the approximation, by ‘noticing’ ever smaller bays, there will still remain irregularities on some scale smaller than x, at least until we get down to molecular proportions where the whole exercise becomes mean- ingless. Because coastlines are fractal, the value of L(x) grows without limit, and the length is infinite. In the absence of a finite limiting value, it is often useful to study how a quantity tends to infin- ity. Is the growth rate fast and explosive, or slow and steady? In other words, what is the ‘asymptotic’ (when a curve tends towards but never reaches a straight line) behaviour? Lewis Fry Richardson once made an empirical study of the asymptotic problem, for real coastlines, and found an excellent empirical law: L(x) ~ kx1−D for certain constants k and D. The value of D is much the same for most coastlines on planet Earth, presumably for geological reasons, and in particular D ~ 1.25 for the coast of Britain. To gain an intuitive feeling for what this result means, compare Britain to a snowflake curve. The construction of the snowflake is too regular to cor- respond to a real coastline, but as far as the main feature – structure on all scales – goes, it’s not bad. For simplicity, measure its length using values x = 1, 1 /3 , 1 /9 , 1 /27 , and so on. Then L(1) = 1, L(1 /3 ) = 4 /3 , L(1 /9 ) = (4 /3 )2 , L(1 /27 ) = (4 /3 )3 , and so on. In general L((1 /3 )n ) = (4 /3 )n . Let x = (1 /3 )n , and note that 4 /3 = (1 /3 )1−D where D = log 4 /log 3 . Then L(x) = x1−D and D = 1.2618. This is very close to the empirical estimate D = 1.25 for the coastline of Britain. I am not claiming that this implies that Britain is a snowflake. The snowflake curve’s geometry is much too regular. Nevertheless, we may interpret the above calculation in the following terms. Suppose a real coastline has the same statistical distribution of bays and promontories, sub-bays and subpromontories, as does the snowflake curve. Then the value of L(x)\n\n23. 10 The Colour of Infinity should follow the same asymptotic law as for the snowflake, and thus lead to the same D. If the statis- tical distribution is similar to that of the snowflake, but not quite the same, then the constant D should change slightly. So we conclude that the coastline of Britain has pretty much the same ‘roughness’ as the snowflake – but is maybe just a tad smoother. The combinatorial regularity of the snowflake is essentially a scaling law. If a small section of the curve is suitably magnified, then it looks exactly like some larger section of the original. The constant D describes, in a quantitative manner, the precise scal- ing required. Here, if four copies of a segment of the curve are suitably assembled, the result has exactly the same shape as the segment, but is three times as large. The value log 4 /log 3 of D is built from those two numbers. This property is called self-similarity. The same idea holds for coastlines, but now the scaling affects the statistics, not the curve as such. Instead of asking that a magnified version of a section of coastline should be exactly the same as the origi- nal, we ask that it should be a plausible picture of a coastline on the same scale as the original. Or, to put it another way: if you are presented with a map of a coastline, without any other markings and with no indication of the scale, then there will be no way to determine the scale just by studying the map. Innumerable other natural phenomena exhibit structure on a wide range of scales, connected by suitable scaling laws. For instance, the bark of a tree, the ripples on the ocean, vortices in a turbu- lent fluid, landscapes, the inner surface of the lung, the holes in a sponge, the surface of a soap flake. Therefore we expect there to be some regime of mathematical modelling in which the ‘pathological’ curves and surfaces that were so despised by the clas- sical mathematicians find natural application to the real world. Since scaling laws appear to be funda- mental to the whole enterprise, the initial emphasis should be on understanding what they have to tell us. And the first thing they tell us extends the usual notion of ‘dimension’ in a radical way. Fractal dimension It turns out that the number D introduced above may be interpreted as a dimension. This may seem a rather curious idea, since the usual notion of dimension is always a whole number, but there are plenty of precedents in mathematics. The concept ‘number’, for example, originated in counting – one sheep, two sheep, three sheep. In this context, half a sheep makes no sense. But in the butcher’s shop – or, less grimly, at the moneylender’s, where a person might own a half share in a sheep – the extension of the number system to fractions is natural. Again, we are used to the idea that the nth power of a number is obtained by multiplying n copies of that number – so that the fifth power of 3, for example, is 35 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 243. What, then, is the halfth power? What you get by multiplying half a copy of a number by itself? That makes little sense, but the halfth power makes excellent sense: it is the square root. Multiply the halfth power by itself, and you get back the first power – the original number. Twice a half is one – easy. In fact, the generalization of dimension that occurs in fractal geometry is reasonable from several points of view. To see why, we begin by reviewing the usual concept of dimension. (Fig. 1.4) (a) A line segment has dimension 1, by which we mean that any point in the segment can be specified using just one coordinate, one number. The point x lies x units to the right of the left-hand end of the segment. (b) A square has dimension 2, by which we mean that any point in the square can be specified using just two coordinates (x, y). Here x is the distance from the left-hand edge and y is the distance from the bottom edge.\n\n24. 11 The Nature of Fractal Geometry (c) A cube has dimension 3, by which we mean that any point in the cube can be specified using just three coordinates (x, y, z). Here x is the distance from the left-hand face, y is the distance from the bottom face, and z is the distance from the back face. In these examples, the dimension of the object is the number of independent directions in space that it occupies. No directions are needed for a point, so it has dimension 0. A line lies along one direction, a square lies in two (a plane), whereas a cube requires three. Similar ideas apply to curved lines and sur- faces. A curve has dimension 1. The surface of a smooth object, such as a sphere or torus, has dimen- sion 2. A solid object, such as a solid sphere or a solid torus, has dimension 3. This concept of dimension is always a whole number. A point has dimension 0, a curve has dimension 1, a surface has dimension 2, a solid has dimension 3. With a suitable act of imagi- nation, we can go into spaces of dimension 4, 5, 6, and so on – see Abbott (1884) and its modern sequel Stewart (2001). Engineers will recognize this con- cept as the number of ‘degrees of freedom’ of a system – the number of coordinates needed to determine its state – so that space-time, with 3 space coordinates and one time coordinate, is 4-dimensional. The dimension of even a simple system can be surprisingly large. For example, describing the posi- tion and velocity of the Moon in space requires six numbers: three position coordinates, and three com- ponents of velocity relative to those coordinates. So the 3-body system composed of the Earth, Moon, and Sun, which is basic to astronomy, is an 18-dimen- sional system. Each body requires 3 coordinates of position in space and a further 3 of velocity. A more extreme case is something we all carry around with us: the human body, with its innumerable flexible joints. Look at your hand. Each finger can be bent x x x y y z Fig. 1.4 The concept of dimension in geometry: (a) a line has 1 dimension and 1 coordinate; (b) a square has 2 dimen- sions and 2 coordinates; (c) a cube has 3 dimensions and 3 coordinates. At a conservative estimate, the ‘configuration space’ for the human body – the totality of possible shapes into which it can be bent – is at least 101-dimensional.Yes, we live in space of 3 dimensions, and a space-time of 4, but the complete range of possible configurations of the human body forms Above: A solar eclipse\n\n25. 12 The Colour of Infinity through some angle, and those angles are pretty much independent of each other. So just to describe the state of your hand, you need a 5-dimensional space of possible configurations. In fact, fingers can bend sideways (a bit) too, so 10 dimensions is a more realistic number. Your two hands and two feet now require at least 40 dimen- sions to capture all possible combinations of positions, and then there are your wrists, elbows, shoulders, ankles, knees, thighs ... and your head, eyelids, and waist. At a conservative estimate, the ‘configuration space’ for the human body – the totality of pos- sible shapes into which it can be bent – is at least 101-dimensional. Yes, we live in space of 3 dimen- sions, and a space-time of 4, but the complete range of possible configurations of the human body forms a conceptual ‘space’ with 101 dimensions. This notion is called topological dimension because shapes that can be continuously deformed into each other have the same dimension. Thus a wiggly curve has the same dimension, 1, as a straight line; a wobbly surface has the same dimension, 2, as a plane. And if a shape is magnified by some scale factor – say tripled in size – then its dimension remains unchanged. Scaling laws are more sensitive: they involve not just shape, but size. Distances are important, scale matters. What count are not topological properties, but metric ones. This extra ingredient opens up the possibility of finding an extended notion of dimension which (a) agrees with the usual definition for smooth curves and surfaces; (b) applies to more general spaces, such as the snowflake or the Cantor Set; and (c) reflects metric, not topological, properties, especially behaviour under scaling. The price we pay for such an extension, however, is that the resulting concept of dimension is forced to take non-integer values. It turns out to be a price well worth paying – imaginative ideas that take us out of our comfortable world usually are. The simplest such generalization (there are many) is the similarity dimension. This concept is based on scaling properties; it is a little too special to be entirely satisfactory, but when it does work it is very easy to understand. Consider a unit square. If its sides are divided into n equal parts, then it can be cut into N = n2 subsquares, each similar to the original. With a simi- lar dissection of a cube, we find that N = n3 ; with a 4-dimensional hypercube we get N = n4 . And with a homely line segment, N = n1 . (Fig. 1.5) The pattern is obvious: if the dimension is d, then N = nd . Taking logarithms and solving, we get d = log N /log n . All perfectly reasonable, and equivalent to standard geometrical properties of these simple shapes. So let’s try a shape that is not quite so simple: the archetypal ‘pathological set’, the Cantor Set. Remember: to form a Cantor Set, start with a line segment, remove its middle third to get two segments each one-third the size; then repeat indefinitely. What’s left is the Cantor Set. It is clear that after the initial step, we construct two separate Cantor Sets, each one third the size of the whole; the Cantor Set itself is obtained by uniting these two subsets. In other words, the Cantor Set can be broken into two pieces (N = 2) each one third as big (n = 3). By formal analogy, the dimension of the Cantor Set ‘ought’ to be d = log 2 /log 3 = 0.6309, which is not a whole number. This may seem curious, but it makes a lot of sense because: (a) it accurately reflects the scaling properties of the Cantor Set: two copies make a set just the same shape but three times as big; and (b) the dimension is intermediate between 0, the dimension of a finite set of points, and 1, the dimension of a curve. This agrees with the intuitive idea that the Cantor Set is rather less than a curve, since it has gaps, but is more closely clustered than a finite set of points.\n\n26. 13 The Nature of Fractal Geometry Similar reasoning lets us assign a dimension to the snowflake. If we work (for convenience) with one seg- ment of the snowflake, we see that it takes 4 copies to make something 3 times as big. (Fig. 1.6) Thus N = 4, n = 3, and d = log 4 /log 3 = 1.2618. Recognize this number? It is the constant D that appeared in the coastline cal- culation for the snowflake. That is, we have interpreted D as a scaling dimension. The same kind of game can be played with all scaling laws. (This, by the way, is why we used 1−D in the formula, instead of just D.) For the snowflake, d lies between 1 and 2, and this again agrees with visual intuition. The snowflake is ‘more than’ a smooth curve, but hardly constitutes a surface. The main restriction in the definition of the scaling dimension is that it requires the set under consideration to be self-similar. It must coincide with small pieces of itself when suitably scaled. More general notions of dimension also exist. For theoretical work, the best is the Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimension, introduced in 1919 and generalized in 1929. Related but different con- cepts of dimension are often used in experimental work because they are easier to measure; see Falconer (1990). Brownian motion Particle paths One potential application for a theory of ‘pathologi- cal’ curves has been around since 1828. It demon- strates that the common assumption that the only curves needed to do physics are smooth ones is completely wrong. 1 2 3 4 3 9 27 Fig. 1.5 Extending the idea of dimension numerically to squares and cubes.

If very small particles are suspended in a fluid, apparently at rest, then on close inspection it will be seen that they undergo frequent irregular motions. Brown suggested that this movement might be caused by the motion of molecules in the fluid, brought about by heat. In 1926 Jean Perrin wrote: The direction of the straight line joining the positions occupied at two instants very close in time is found to vary absolutely irregularly as the time between the two instants is decreased. An unprejudiced observer would therefore conclude that he is dealing with a function without deriva- tive, instead of a curve to which a tangent could be drawn ... At certain scales and for certain methods of investigation, many phenomena may be represented by regular continuous functions. If, to go further, we attribute to matter the infinitely granular structure that is in the spirit of atomic theory, our power to apply to reality the rigorous mathematical concept of continuity will greatly decrease. Perrin had discovered that the ‘pathological’ curves that both intrigued and repelled the math- ematicians were entirely natural, in the sense that they had sensible counterparts in nature; they arose in areas as fundamental as molecular motion. He car- ried out experiments on these ideas, and was awarded the Nobel prize in 1926. In the 1930s Norbert Weiner formulated a math- ematical model of Brownian motion, showing that it possesses exactly this feature of non-differentiable particle trajectories. Weiner’s work, roughly speak- ing, is carried out in the context of a random func- tion of time, such that the probability of moving any given distance at any instant is determined by the classic ‘bell curve’ or Gaussian distribution, while the direction is completely and uniformly random. In such a setting, particle trajectories are almost nowhere differentiable. Within the past few years, methods from fractal geometry have led to major advances in our math- ematical understanding of Brownian motion. In his 1982 book, Mandelbrot made a conjecture about the fractal dimension of a typical particle trajectory. At the time, his evidence was derived mainly from com- puter simulations. Imagine a single particle obeying Brownian motion in the plane. Follow its trajectory for a fixed period of time, obtaining an extremely wiggly curve. Mandelbrot conjectured that the frac- tal dimension of this curve – more exactly, of those parts of the curve that lie on the outer edge of the shape that it forms – is exactly 4 /3 . In 2000, Gregory Lawler, Oded Schramm, and Wendelin Werner announced a rigorous proof of this conjecture, together with several other fractal properties of Brownian motion. Their proof involves mathematical analogies with other fractal processes. Other mathematical physicists have suggested differ- ent proofs based on links with the theory of quantum gravity, which had not previously been related to Brownian motion. (The relation is mathematical: In that year [1828], Robert Brown drew attention to a curious phenomenon that he had observed through a microscope. If very small particles are suspended in a fluid, apparently at rest, then on close inspection it will be seen that they undergo frequent irregular motions. Brown suggested that this movement might be caused by the motion of molecules in the fluid, brought about by heat.\n\n28. the physical interpretations of the two areas are quite different.) Lawler and co-workers also proved that the fractal dimension of the set of ‘cut points’ of the curve is 3 /4 and that of the set of ‘pioneer points’ is 7 /4 . A cut point is one whose removal causes the curve to fall apart into two disconnected pieces. A pioneer point is one that finds itself on the outer boundary at the instant the curve first reaches that point. These results illustrate the high level of math- ematical detail in our new understanding of particle paths in Brownian motion, obtained through fractal geometry. Turbulence One of the most important and baffling phenomena in fluid dynamics is turbulence: irregular, twisting flow-patterns far removed from the smooth ‘lami- nar’ flows beloved of the classical analysts. Until recently, turbulence has been studied by a variety of ad hoc analytical methods and probabilistic models, but relatively little attention has been paid to the geometry of turbulence. Yet the geometry contains hints of a deeper structure that the analytic approach misses. Turbulence involves motion on a wide range\n\n29. 16 The Colour of Infinity of scales, large and small. As Lewis Fry Richardson put it in 1922: Big whorls have little whorls, Which feed on their velocity; And little whorls have lesser whorls, And so on to viscosity. Could fractals be involved in the geometry of tur- bulence? This suggestion was made by Mandelbrot in about 1960. It re-emerged in a very different guise from the topological dynamics of the mid-1970s, and it now appears to be firmly established by careful experiments using a variety of ‘small-scale’ labora- tory systems. Of course the theory met with fierce resistance along the way, as occurs with anything genuinely new in science, especially when it is advo- cated by interlopers from another field. To be fair, these experiments establish the occurrence of fractal geometry in weak turbulence; fully developed turbu- lence is quite another matter – but if anything, that looks even more fractal. Turbulence may be confined to certain regions of an otherwise smooth flow, or it may appear suddenly everywhere. It can appear and disappear intermit- tently. In the Taylor vortex experiment, where fluid is observed in the region between two concentric rotat- ing cylinders, spiral turbulence occurs in patches on a predominantly helical flow like a spinning barber’s pole. The boundaries of turbulent regions typically have a complex local structure: billows upon billows, whorls upon whorls. The region around Jupiter’s Great Red Spot is typical of such behaviour. The topological approach to turbulence was initi- ated by Ruelle and Takens (1971), who suggested a scenario for the transition to turbulence in terms of the creation of a so-called ‘fractal attractor’ in the dynamics. Harry Swinney, Jerry Gollub, and others carried out experiments using lasers to measure the speed of the fluid, and confirmed the general con- ceptual framework, though not the precise scenario originally proposed. In larger systems, the transition to turbulence is a much more complex affair. So we still have much to learn about turbulence. Fractal geometry can help us make advances, but it cannot answer everything. What can? Fractal drums Fractals as vibrational modes In 1996 Michael Lapidus and colleagues studied the vibrational modes of a drum shaped like the snow- flake curve. The practical spin-off from such research includes a better understanding of why a rocky coast- line dissipates rough seas better than a smooth one – important for coastal defences, and one reason why all the old straight-sided promenades are being replaced by irregular heaps of spiky concrete. It also helps to explain why the foliage of trees proves so resistant to the wind, and how our system of elastic-walled veins, arteries, and capillaries absorbs the thud of a beating heart with surprisingly little damage. It offers new insights into how radar waves bounce around in mountainous terrain, and how laser beams might reflect from the cratered landscape of the Moon. To understand what a vibrational mode is, think about a guitar. Pluck an open string: it produces a single note, the fundamental. Now rest your finger gently against the exact middle of the string, pluck again, and quickly lift your finger off. You hear a high-pitched ping!, exactly one octave higher up the musical scale than the fundamental. If you place your finger one third of the way along the string, you can create an even higher note, and so on. Your finger is selecting various vibrational modes of the string. When the string sounds its fundamental, it forms a single standing wave. The ends are fixed, but the\n\n30. 17 The Nature of Fractal Geometry rest of the string moves up and down in a regular, repetitive fashion. For the octave, two such waves fit into the length of the string, and when one goes up, the other goes down. In between is a fixed node, the place where you put your finger. A guitar string can – in theory – vibrate with any whole number of waves. So as well as the fundamental frequency, it has vibrational frequencies that are twice the fundamental, three times, four times, and so on. Its spectrum, its list of possible frequencies, consists of all whole number multiples of the fundamental. Every shape has an acoustic spectrum. Physically, you can observe the spectrum by making the shape from metal and hitting it – or anything equivalent, such as making the shape from a soap film and watching it wobble, or carving the shape as a cavity in a lump of metal and filling it with microwaves. Mathematically, the most significant aspect of the vibration is the list of frequencies of the natural vibrational modes, called the ‘spectrum’ of the shape. In 1910 the physicist Hendrik Lorentz lectured on the spectrum of electromagnetic waves in an enclosed cavity, which is the same mathematical problem in a different physical realization, and made a bold conjecture. Suppose you choose a shape, and arrange all the frequencies of its spectrum in ascend- ing numerical order. Now ask how fast those num- bers grow as you run along the list. For simplicity, consider a two-dimensional cavity – an area in the plane. Then, said Lorentz, no matter what shape the cavity may be, the frequencies are approximately 2p /A , 4p /A , 6p /A , 8p /A , 10p /A , and so on, where A is the area of the cavity and p is the usual ‘pi’ that we all know and love. Moreover, the approximation gets better and better the higher the frequencies become. David Hilbert, the world leader in mathemat- ics at the time, attended the lecture and was really impressed by Lorentz’s conjecture, but he alleg- edly said that he didn’t expect to see a proof in his lifetime. If so, he was unduly pessimistic: less than two years later his former student Hermann Weyl proved something far more general, using a tech- nique – integral equations – that he had learned from his master, Hilbert. Weyl’s ingenious argu- ment showed that Lorentz’s conjecture is valid not just in the plane, but in space of n dimensions, for any n. But now, instead of the area, you must use the multidimensional equivalent of volume; the constant p must be replaced by a more complicated expression related to the unit n-dimensional sphere; and the frequency must be replaced by its n /2th power. Nonetheless, the main point remains: the frequen- cies in the spectrum are related to the volume of the object, so in particular if the object gets smaller, the frequencies increase. It is here that fractal drums get in on the act. Weyl originally proved his result for objects with a fairly smooth boundary, but over the years his formula was extended to objects with fractal boundaries – such as the snowflake curve. In 1979 the physicist Michael Berry was thinking about light scattering from … there is a curious consequence: you can ‘hear’ the fractal dimension of the boundary of a drum – that is, you can determine it from the drum’s spectrum. Ideas of this kind go back to a famous article written by Mark Kac in 1966, called ‘Can one hear the shape of a drum?’\n\n31. 18 The Colour of Infinity irregular surfaces, and he came up with a conjectured improvement to Weyl’s formula. This improvement involved an extra term, proportional to the fractal dimension of the object’s boundary. According to Berry, the extra term in Weyl’s formula ought to be proportional to the frequency raised to the power of half the fractal dimension of the boundary. If so, there is a curious consequence: you can ‘hear’ the fractal dimension of the boundary of a drum – that is, you can determine it from the drum’s spectrum. Ideas of this kind go back to a famous article written by Mark Kac in 1966, called ‘Can you hear the shape of a drum?’ Kac pointed out that Weyl’s formula shows that you can hear the area of a drum, no matter what the shape of the drum’s rim might be, and asked what else can you hear? He set the ball rolling by proving that the spectrum also determines the drum’s perimeter, and even its con- nectivity – how many holes it has. It turned out that there are some features that you can’t always hear. Various mathematicians found examples where two different high-dimensional shapes had the same spectrum, meaning that their shape cannot be ‘heard’ in complete detail. The first example was in 16 dimensions. By 1982 the dimension was down to 4, and in 1992 Carolyn Gordon, David Webb, and Scott Wolpert knocked the problem on the head by finding two 2-dimensional drums with the same spectrum, but different shapes. (Fig. 1.7) Even though you can’t hear everything you’d like to, the question ‘what can you hear from an object’s spectrum?’ is important. There are many cases where it is impossible to observe an object directly, but far easier to observe its vibrations. A good example is seismology, which infers the inner structure of the Earth from vibrations generated by earthquakes. Helioseismology does the same for the Sun. Oil companies use sound waves created by surface explo- sions to look for oil deposits deep underground. Children rattle wrapped presents to try to work out what’s inside. Berry’s proposal, if correct, would have added fractal dimension – roughness – to the list of hearable quantities. But it was not to be: in 1986 J. Brossard and R. Carmona found a shape for which the correction term was not related to fractal dimen- sion in the anticipated manner. All was not lost, however: they suggested that a different measure of roughness, the less familiar ‘Minkowski dimension’, might work instead. A ver- sion of this revised conjecture was proved by Michel Lapidus and Jacqueline Fleckinger-Pellé in 1988. The most recent work on the spectra of fractals has gone beyond general results on the distribution of frequencies, to look in detail at the actual vibra- tional patterns. Since 1989 the experimentalists G. Sapoval, Th. Gobron and A. Margolina have been studying mechanical vibrations of fractal objects – such as a steel plate etched with a laser to produce a ‘squareflake’-shaped groove – a variant of the snow- flake curve made from squares rather than triangles. Sapoval’s team discovered new effects in vibrating fractals, effects that don’t occur for more traditional shapes. For example, it looks as though wave motion in regions with fractal boundaries can be localized – small regions of the object vibrate noticeably, but the rest hardly moves. Fig. 1.7 Two 2-dimensional drums: how to share the same spectrum but with different shapes.\n\n32. 19 The Nature of Fractal Geometry In 1995 Lapidus and M. Pang performed a rigorous mathematical analysis of the fundamental mode, the lowest frequency vibration, of the snowflake curve. They discovered that for this mode, the vibrating ‘drumskin’ can become infinitely steep near certain points of the boundary – mainly those where obtuse angles (greater than a right angle) occur. In a physical analogy, the vibrating fractal drum experiences infi- nite stress at such points. The rigorous mathematics confirms an effect observed in earlier experiments. What does a vibrating fractal really look like? Using an Onyx computer from Silicon Graphics, and some cunning numerical methods, Lapidus’s team has drawn the first fifty snowflake harmonics – the vibrational modes of a drumskin whose boundary is the snowflake curve. Their findings confirm previous discoveries, and add some new puzzles. In the fundamental mode, as predicted by general theory, the whole drumskin moves upwards or down- wards at the same time – there are no nodal curves where the drumskin is stationary, except at the boundary. The extremely steep gradient near obtuse- angle boundary points is clearly visible. Conversely, it turns out that the gradient near acute angles is zero – the membrane is flat, the stress is zero. The spectra of fractals comprise a vibrant new area of science – pun intended – with the potential to solve a lot of puzzles, including many of the ques- tions raised earlier. For example, think about waves hitting a rocky coast. A coastline is much better\n\n33. 20 The Colour of Infinity approximated by a fractal than by a smooth curve, so the action of ocean waves on a rocky coast should be much closer to the snowflake model than to clas- sical analyses of waves hitting a flat boundary. A flat boundary reflects most of the waves’ energy back out to sea, but a fractal boundary seems able to absorb wave energy, or isolate it into small patches. The leaves and branches of trees are fractal, and this may be why they make better barriers to the wind than a simple flat fence – a fact that modern agricul- ture is starting to rediscover after decades of rooting out hedges to produce vast, but windswept, fields. Similarly the human circulatory system, with its repeated branching pattern of ever-smaller veins and arteries, is fractal. As well as conducting blood effectively to all parts of our bodies, this fractal structure may also help the blood vessels to absorb and dissipate the stress caused by the heavy thumps of a beating heart. Fractals in technology Practical Applications Although the main importance of fractal geometry is as a scientific tool, most science eventually acquires practical applications, and fractal geometry is no exception. In fact, the next few decades will probably see an explosion of fractal-based technology. Already the applications are quite diverse. Here are just a few examples. Nearly all machines include springs. A video recorder, for example, contains several hundred of them. Springs are made by coiling wire on special machines. Until recently, a big problem was to test in advance whether wire would make good coils or poor ones. The only method was to try them and see, which could take a day or more. Now a test, based on fractal geometry, takes only two minutes. It is embodied in the FRACMAT machine (short for ‘fractal materials’) and was invented by the Institute of Spring Technology in Sheffield, togeth- er with a team from the University of Warwick. The idea is to make a long test coil on a metal rod, and then analyse the fractal patterns in the spacings of the coils. The type of fractal structure present correlates closely with the desirable quality of ‘coilability’. Mines are dangerous places to be. Earthquakes or other stresses building up in the walls of a mine can sometimes lead to devastating ‘rockbursts’, often with fatal consequences for miners nearby. In 2000 …the combined sounds of thousands of fractures is character- istic of the rock’s behaviour.\n\n34. 21 The Nature of Fractal Geometry engineers at the Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, discovered that rockbursts can be detected as they build up by listening to the sounds made by the rocks. Every tiny fracture makes its own popping sound, and the combined sounds of thousands of frac- tures is characteristic of the rock’s behaviour. Simon Hsiung and colleagues at SWRI realized that the pat- tern of cracks is fractal, and therefore the associated sounds should also be fractal. The fractal dimension of the cracks (and the associated sounds) first grows steadily; then it suddenly begins to drop. Soon after that point is reached, the rocks blow apart. In small- scale experiments the warning time is a few minutes, but in the large-scale cracking that occurs in a real mine it may be days. If so, miners can either evacu- ate an area where a rockburst is due to occur, or take steps to relieve the stress so that it never happens. One of the main limitations on the effectiveness of mobile phones has been the antenna that receives and transmits radio signals. The first radio receivers used little more than a bare wire as an antenna, and until recently most mobile phones were little more sophisticated. Then composite antennas, made of thousands of smaller ones, became available. They are usually arranged either regularly in a rectangular grid, or at random. In 1999 Dwight Jaggard and Douglas Werner discovered that a fractal arrangement of these micro-antennas combined the robustness of a random array with the efficiency of a grid. Already there is some theoretical understanding of why fractal shapes work so well. Nathan Cohen and Robert Hohfeld proved that if an antenna is to work equally well at any frequency, then it must have two features: sym- metry, and self-similarity. Many fractals, for example the Sierpinski gasket (Fig. 1.8), have both. Digital communications, be they television or computers, transmit visual images as a sequence of binary digits 0 and 1. The easy way to turn an image into such a sequence is to read off the black and white ‘pixels’ – tiny picture elements – from a regular grid, with 0 representing white and 1 black. More complex codes can represent shades of grey or colours. The resulting list of digits is huge, as anyone who uses a scanner knows. Engineers are always look- ing for ways to encode the sequences so that the same image can be represented by fewer digits. For exam- ple, in photographs there is often a lot of blue sky, so using a short code for ‘blue’ makes more sense than a longer code. In video, the most important feature is which pixels change from one frame to the next; the rest can be left the same as they were. And so on. In 1996 Iterated Systems of Atlanta, a company founded by mathematician Michael Barnsley (see the chapter in this book written by Michael with his wife Louise), developed a data-compression system for video images based on fractal self-similarity. Roughly speaking, a computer compares small regions of the image with larger ones, and lists cases where the two have much the same form. From this list, which is typically much shorter than a grid of pixel codes, it is possible to reconstruct the image with almost perfect accuracy. Fig. 1.8 The Sierpinski gasket: this nest of triangles displays two of the common characteristics of fractals – symmetry and self-similarity.\n\n35. Through fractal eyes A Voyage of discovery What, then, have fractals taught us? Until recently it was fair to say, as I did in From Here to Infinity in 1996, that: ‘The contribution of fractals to our understanding of the natural world is not so much one of technology as of what used to be called natural philosophy.’ Fractals provide a unified point of view on certain kinds of complexity and irregularity in the natural world, and open a path for a mathematical attack. They act as an organizing principle, not as a computational tool like calculus or linear algebra or numerical methods. Nowadays it must hastily be added that the com- putational and technological aspects of the subject are advancing rapidly, as more and more scientists wake up to the new methods, stop trying to dismiss them, and start trying to use them. The recognition of fractals as basic geometric forms, amenable to analysis but having quite different characteristics from the familiar smooth forms such as spheres and cylinders, opens our eyes to a new range of phenom- ena and sensitizes us to new points of view. Instead of being seen as ‘erroneous’ or ‘uninteresting’, and hence avoided, these phenomena are seen as some- thing to be deliberately sought out and understood. One measure of the maturity of a mathematical theory is the extent to which it studies things that a previous generation dismissed as being ‘special’, ‘pathological’, ‘non-generic’, ‘accidental’, ‘abnormal’, Above: The nebula\n\n36. 23 The Nature of Fractal Geometry ‘coincidental’... There are many words in the lan- guage for ‘we don’t understand this’, and science uses them all. Major new theories often arise when some- one takes such unorthodoxies seriously, and investi- gates them in their own right with an open mind. Examples are ready to hand. When Edward Lorenz (1963) first observed irregular solutions to a model of the weather, hardly anybody took any notice, yet today there is scarcely any branch of science that does not make contact with Chaos Theory, which grew from that discovery (and several others). Again, the study of chemical oscillators, now highly fashionable, was for many years thought to be akin to the search for a perpetual motion machine. The list is virtually endless: the only counterbalance to this memorial to human folly, narrow-mindedness, and prejudice is the even more extensive list of com- parably unorthodox ideas that have proved utterly worthless. Not all novelty is valuable, and being enthusiastic does not guarantee being right. As an identifiable area of mathematics with its own characteristic point of view and body of tech- niques, fractal geometry has now ‘arrived’. Its view- point is recognizable and recognized. But for all the beauty of its pictures and the breadth of its vision of the natural world, more work needs to be done before the theory becomes fully established. Many of its models are descriptive rather than explanatory. Fractal ‘fake’ mountains look like real ones, but we have as yet little understanding of how erosion proc- esses produce the fractal structure. We often cannot compute the fractal dimension, let alone anything more sophisticated, from basic physical principles. As I said, all this is starting to change, as the theory moves into its next phase. But even a purely descriptive theory adds scientific value. If cellular tissue is best modelled by a fractal, then there is no point in treating it as a rectangular slab. Today, the role of fractal geometry is not primarily to add new weapons to the pure mathematician’s armoury (though it sometimes does), or to help us make a better mobile phone (though it sometimes does), or to provide insight into the structure of the universe (though it sometimes does). It is to open our eyes to an entire realm of mathematics. In 1996 I put it this way: ‘[Fractals] are important because they suggest that, out there in the jungle of the unknown, is a whole new area of mathematics, directly relevant to the study of nature.’ We have now explored enough of the jungle to realize that what remains to be explored is even bigger, and more exciting, than we ever imagined.

T oday, everybody is familiar with graphs, especially the one with Time along the hori- zontal axis, and the Cost of Living climbing steadily up the vertical one. The idea that any point on a plane can be expressed by two numbers, usually written x and y, now appears so obvious that it seems quite surprising that the world of mathematics had to wait until 1637 for Descartes to invent it. We are still discovering the consequences of that apparently simple idea, and the most amazing is now just a few years old. It’s called the Mandelbrot Set (from now on, the ‘M-set’) and you’re soon going to meet it everywhere – in the design of fabrics, wallpaper, jewellery and linoleum. And, I’m afraid, it will be popping out of your TV screen in every other commercial. The stunning beauty of the images the M-set gen- erates has an appeal that is both emotional and uni- versal: I have seen people almost hypnotized by the computer-produced films that explore its – ­ literally infinite – ramifications. Resonating to the M-set The psychological reasons for this appeal are still a mystery, and may always remain so; perhaps there is some structure, if one can use that term, deep in the human mind that resonates to the patterns in the M-set. Carl Jung would have been surprised – and delighted – to know that thirty years after his death, the computer revolution whose beginnings he just lived to see would give new impetus to his theory of archetypes, and his belief in the existence of a ‘col- lective unconscious’. Many patterns in the M-set are strongly reminiscent of the abstract, curvilinear motifs of Islamic decorative art; the comma-shaped Paisley design is one exam- ple. Others resemble organic structures – tentacles, ­ compound insect eyes, armies of sea-­ horses, elephant trunks … then, abruptly, they become transformed into angular shapes like the crystals and snowflakes of the world before any life existed. Yet perhaps the most astonishing feature of the M-set is its basic simplicity. Unlike almost every- thing else in modern mathematics, any schoolchild can understand how it is produced. Its generation involves nothing more advanced than addition and multiplication; there’s no need for such complexi- ties as subtraction and – heaven forbid! – division, let alone any of the more exotic beasts from the mathematical menagerie. Another of those equations There can be few people in the civilized world who have not encountered Einstein’s famous E = mc2 , or who would consider it too hopelessly complicated to understand. Well, the equation that defines the M-set contains the same number of terms, indeed looks very similar. Here it is: Z z2 + c. Exploring the Fractal Universe\n\n40. 27 Exploring the Fractal Universe Not very terrifying, is it? Yet the lifetime of the Universe would not be long enough to explore all its ramifications. The zs and the c in Mandelbrot’s equation are all numbers, not (as in Einstein’s) physical quantities like mass and energy. They are coordinates, which specify the position of a point, and the equation con- trols the way in which it moves, to trace a pattern. There’s a very simple analogue familiar to everyone – those children’s books with blank pages sprinkled with numbers, which when joined up in the right order reveal hidden – and often surprising – pictures. The image on a TV screen is produced by a sophisticated application of the same principle. In theory, anyone who can add and multiply could plot out the M-set with pen or pencil on a sheet of squared paper. However, as we’ll see later, there are certain practical difficulties – notably the fact that a human lifespan is seldom more than a hundred years. So the M-set is invariably computer-generated, and usually shown on a computer screen. Take any point in space Now, there are two ways of locating a point in space. The more common employs some kind of grid refer- ence – West–East, North–South, or, on squared graph paper, a horizontal X-axis and a vertical Y-axis. But there’s also the system used in radar, now famil- iar to most people thanks to countless movies. Here the position of an object is given by (1) its distance from the origin, and (2) its direction, or compass bearing. Incidentally, this is the natural system – the one you use automatically and unconsciously when you play any ball game. Then you’re concerned with distances and angles, with yourself as the origin. So think of a computer’s screen as a radar screen with a single blip on it, whose movements are going to trace out the M-set. However, before we switch on our radar, I want to make the equation even sim- pler, to: Z = z2 . I’ve thrown c away, for the moment, and left only the zs. Now let me define them more precisely. Small z is the initial range of the blip – the distance at which it starts. Big Z is its final distance from the origin. Thus if a point was initially 2 units away, by obeying this equation it would promptly hop to a distance of 4. The iteration loop Nothing to get very excited about, but now comes the modification that makes all the difference: Z z2 That double arrow is a two-way traffic sign, indicating that the numbers flow in both directions. This time, we don’t stop at Z = 4; we make that equal to a new z – which promptly give us a second Z of 16, and so on. In no time we’ve generated the series 256,65536,4294967296 … and the spot that started only 2 units from the centre is heading towards infin- ity in giant steps of ever-increasing magnitude. This process of going round and round a loop is called ‘iteration’. It’s like a dog chasing its own tail, except that a dog doesn’t get anywhere. But math- ematical iteration can take us to some very strange places indeed – as we shall soon discover. Now we’re ready to turn on our radar. Most dis- plays have range circles at 10, 20 … 100 kilometres from the centre. We will require only a single circle, at a range of 1. There’s no need to specify any units, as we’re dealing with pure numbers. Make them cen- timetres or light years, as you please. Let’s suppose that the initial position of our blip is anywhere on this circle – the bearing doesn’t matter. So z is 1. As 1 squared is still 1, so is Z. And it remains at that value because no matter how many times you square 1, it always remains exactly 1. The blip may\n\n41. 28 The Colours of Infinity hop round and round the circle, but it always stays on it. Shooting for infinity Now consider the case where the initial z is greater than 1. We’ve already seen how rapidly the blip shoots to infinity if z equals 2, but the same thing happens even if it’s only a microscopic shade more than 1: say 1.000000000000000000001. Watch: At the first squaring, Z becomes 1.000000000000000000002 then 1.000000000000000000004 1.000000000000000000008 1.000000000000000000016 1.000000000000000000032 1.000000000000000000064 and so on for pages of printout. For all practical purposes, the value is still exactly 1. The blip hasn’t moved visibly outwards or inwards; it’s still on the circle at range 1. But those zeros are slowly being whittled away, as the digits march inexorably across from the right. Quite suddenly, something appears in the third, sec- ond, first decimal place – and the numbers explode after a very few additional terms, as this example shows, reading left to right: 1.001 1.002 1.004 1.008 1.016 1.032 1.066 1.136 1.292 1.668 2.783 7.745 59.987 3598.467 12,948,970 167,675,700,000,000 28,115,140,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 There could be a million – a billion – zeros on the right hand side, and the result would still be the same. Eventually the digit would creep up to the decimal point – and then Z would take to infinity. The other side of infinity Now let’s look at the other case. Suppose z is a microscopic amount less than 1 – say something like 0.99999999999999999999. As before, nothing much happens for a long time as we round the loop, except that the numbers on the far right get steadily smaller. But after a few ­ thousand or million iterations – catastrophe! Z sud- denly shrinks to nothing, dissolving in an endless string of zeros … Check it out on your computer. It can only handle twelve digits? Well, no matter how many you had to play with, you’d get the same answer. Trust me … The results of this ‘program’ can be summarized in the laws that may seem too trivial to be worth for- mulating. But mathematical truth is trivial, and in a few more steps these laws will take us into a universe of mind-boggling wonder and beauty. The laws of squaring Here are the three laws of the squaring program: 1. if the input z is exactly equal to 1, the output Z always remains 1; 2. if the input is more than 1, the output eventu- ally becomes infinite; and 3. if the input is less than 1, the output eventu- ally becomes zero. That circle of radius 1 is therefore a kind of map, dividing the plane into two distinct territories. Outside it, numbers that obey the squaring law have the freedom of infinity; numbers inside it are prison- ers, trapped and doomed to ultimate extinction. At this point, someone may say: ‘You’ve only talked about ranges – distances from the origin. To fix the blip’s position, you have to give its bearing as well. What about that?’ Very true. Fortunately, in this selection process – this division of the zs into two distinct classes – bearings are\n\n42. 29 Exploring the Fractal Universe irrelevant; the same thing happens in every direction. For this simple example – let’s call it the S-set – we can ignore them. When we come on to the more complicated case of the M-set, where the bearing is important, there’s a very neat mathematical trick to take care of it. Many of you will have guessed that it uses complex or imaginary numbers (which really aren’t at all com- plex, still less imaginary). But we don’t need them for this discussion, and I promise not to mention them again. Inside the map The S-set lies inside a map, and its frontier is the circle enclosing it. That circle is simply a continuous line with no thickness. If you could examine it with a microscope of infinite power, it would always look exactly the same. You could expand the S-set to the size of the uni- verse; its boundary would still be a line of zero thick- ness. Yet there are no holes in it; it’s an absolutely impenetrable barrier, forever separating the zs less than one from those greater than one. Now, at last, we’re ready to tackle the M-set, where these commonsense ideas are turned upside down. Fasten your seat belts. During the 1970s, the French mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot, working at Harvard and IBM, started to investigate the equation that has made him famous, and which I will now write in dynamic form: Z z2 + c. The only difference between this and the equation we have used to describe the S-set is the term c. This – not z – is now the starting point of our mapping operation. The first time round the loop, z is put equal to zero. … perhaps there is some structure, if one can use that term, deep in the human mind that resonates to the patterns in the M-set.\n\n43. 30 The Colours of Infinity The M-set and the unimaginable universe It seems a trifling change, and no-one could have imagined the universe it would reveal. Mandelbrot himself did not obtain the first crude glimpses until the spring of 1980, when vague patterns started to emerge on computer printouts. He had begun to peer through Keats’s Charmed magic casements, opening on the foam Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn. As we shall learn later; that word ‘foam’ is surpris- ingly appropriate. The new equation asks and answers the same ques- tion as the earlier one: What shape is the ‘territory’ mapped out when we put numbers into it? For the S-set it was a circle of radius 1. Let’s see what happens when we start with this value in the M-equation. You should be able to do it in your head – for the first few steps. But after a few dozen even a supercom- puter may blow a gasket. For starters, z = 0, c = 1. So Z = 1. First loop: Z = 12 + 1 = 2. Second loop: Z = 22 + 1 = 5. Third loop: Z = 52 + 1 = 26. Fourth loop: Z = 262 + 1 … and so on. I once set my computer to work out the higher terms (about the limit of my programming ability) and it produced only two more values before it had to start approximating. Starting from the beginning we get: 1 2 5 26 677 458,330 21,006,640,000 4,412,789,000,000,000,000,000. At that point my computer gave up, because it doesn’t believe there are any numbers with more than 38 digits. However, even the first two or three terms are quite enough to show that the M-set must have a different shape from the perfectly circular S-set. A point at distance 1 is in the S-set; indeed, it defines its boundary. A point at that same distance may be outside the boundary of the M-set. Note that I say ‘may’ not ‘must’. It all depends on the initial direction, or bearing, of the starting point, which we have been able to ignore hitherto because it did not affect our discussion of the (perfectly sym- metrical) S-set. As it turns out, the M-set is only symmetrical about the X, or horizontal, axis. One might have guessed that, from the nature of the equation. But no-one could possibly have intuited its real appearance: if the question had been put to me in my virginal pre-Mandelbrot days, I would probably have hazarded: ‘Something like an ellipse, squashed along the Y-axis.’ I might even (though I doubt it) have correctly guessed that it would be shifted towards the left, or minus, direction. The indescribable M-set At this point, I would like to try a thought experi- ment on you. The M-set being literally indescrib- able, here’s my best attempt describe it: imagine you’re looking straight down on a rather plump turtle swimming westwards. It’s been crossed with a swordfish, so has a narrow spike pointing ahead of it. Its entire perimeter is festooned with bizarre marine growths – and with baby turtles of assorted sizes, which have smaller weeds growing on them … I defy you to find a description like that in any maths textbook. And if you think you can do better when you’ve met the real beast, you’re welcome to try.\n\n45. 32 The Colours of Infinity (I suspect that the insect world might provide better analogies; there may even be a Mandelbeetle lurking in the Brazilian rain forests. Too bad, we’ll never know.) Here is the first crude approximation, shorn of details; if you like to fill its blank spaces with the medieval cartographers’ favourite ‘here be dragons’ you will hardly be exaggerating. First of all, note that – as I’ve already remarked – it’s shifted to the left (or West, if you prefer) of the S-set, which of course extends from +1 to −1 along the X-axis. The M-set only gets to 0.25 on the right of the horizontal axis line itself, though above and below the axis line it bulges out to just beyond 0.4. The ‘Utter West’ On the left-hand side, the map stretches to about −1.4, and then it sprouts a peculiar spike – or antenna – which reaches out to exactly −2.0. As far as the M-set is concerned, there is nothing beyond this point; it is the edge of the Universe. Some Mandelbrot fans call it ‘the Utter West’, and you might like to see what happens when you make c equal to −2. Z doesn’t converge to zero – but it doesn’t escape to infinity either, so the point belongs to the Set – just. But if you make c equal to −2.0000001, before you know you’re passing Pluto and heading for Quasar West. Now we come to the most important distinction between the two sets. The S-set has a nice, clean line for its boundary. The frontier of the M-set is, to say the least, fuzzy. Just how fuzzy you will begin to understand when we start to zoom into it; only then will we see the incredible flora and fauna that flour- ish in that disputed territory. The boundary – if one can call it that – of the M-set is not a simple line; it is something that Euclid never imagined, and for which there is no word in ordinary language. Mandelbrot, whose command of English (and American) is awesome, has ransacked the dic- tionary for suggestive nouns. A few examples: foams, Computers can eas- ily make snapshots of the M- set at any magnification, and even in black and white they are fascinating. However, by a simple trick they can be coloured, and transformed into ob- jects of amazing, even surreal, beauty.\n\n46. 33 Exploring the Fractal Universe The Mandelbrot Set is, as I have tried to explain, essentially a map.We’ve all read those stories about maps that reveal the location of hidden treasure. Well, in this case the map IS the treasure! sponges, dusts, webs, nets, curds. He himself coined the technical name fractal, and is now putting up a spirited rearward action to stop anyone defining it too precisely. The colours of infinity Computers can easily make snapshots of the M-set at any magnification, and even in black and white they are fascinating. However, by a simple trick they can be coloured, and transformed into objects of amaz- ing, even surreal, beauty. The original equation, of course, is no more concerned with colour than is Euclid’s Elements of Geometry. But if we instruct the computer to colour any given region in accordance with the number of times z goes round the loop before it decides whether or not it belongs to the M-set the results are gorgeous. Thus the colours, though arbitrary, are not mean- ingless. An exact analogy is found in cartography. Think of the contour lines on a relief map, which show elevations above sea level. The spaces between them are often coloured so that the eye can more easily grasp the information conveyed. Ditto with bathymetric charts; the deeper the ocean, the darker the blue. The map-maker can make the colours any- thing he likes, and is guided by aesthetics as much as geography. It’s just the same here – except that these contour lines are set automatically by the speed of the calcu- lation – I won’t go into details. I have not discovered what genius first had this idea – ­ perhaps Monsieur M. himself, but it turns them into fantastic works of art. And you should see them when they’re animated … Only in the computer age One of the many strange thoughts that the M-set generates is this. In principle, it could have been dis- covered as soon as the human race learned to count. In practice, since even a low magnification image may involve billions of calculations, there was no way in which it could even be glimpsed before computers were invented! And such movies as those on the DVD with this book would have required the entire present world population to calculate night and day for years – without making a single mistake in multi- plying together trillions of hundred-digit numbers. I began by saying that the Mandelbrot Set is the most extraordinary discovery in the history of math- ematics. For who could have possibly imagined that so absurdly simple an equation could have generated such literally infinite complexity, and such unearthly beauty? The Mandelbrot Set is, as I have tried to explain, essentially a map. We’ve all read those stories about maps that reveal the location of hidden treasure. Well, in this case the map IS the treasure!\n\n48. 35 Exploring the Fractal Universe Mathematical Appendix One way of appreciating where the curiously-shaped country of the M-set is located on the map of all possible (complex) numbers is to pin down its Eastern and Western fron- tiers, ignoring everything to the North and South. The Western, or negative, limit is easily identified; for once, the calculation can be done mentally, without the aid of a computer! If we take the basic equation: Z = z2 + c and set the initial value of c equal to −2, the first time round the loop gives Z = −2. The second value is Z = (−2)2 − 2 = 2. The third value is Z = 22 − 2 = 2. And so on for ever: Z is stuck at 2! It does not shrink to zero, but neither does it go rac- ing off to infinity. Thus the point at −2 on the X-axis, or 2 units to the left of the origin, definitely belongs to the M-set. It masks the Utter West – the very tip of the strangely ornamented spike that extends in that direction. It’s interesting to see what happens for values of c on either side of −2, and for that we certainly do need a computer. Take c = −1.99999. Table 2.1 shows what happens to Z as it goes round and round the loop: The value then goes on oscillating, presumably forever (my computer has been round the loop only about ten thousand times) between the limits of plus and minus 2. Perhaps after ten million iterations Z might change its mind and suddenly shoot off to infinity, but it seems reasonable to assume that this value of c is definitely inside the M-set. Table 2.1 c = −1.99999 (reading the numbers left to right) 1.999970 1.999890 1.999570 1.998290 1.993174 1.972752 1.891762 1.578773 0.492534 −1.757400 1.088466 −0.815231 −1.335388 −0.216729 −1.953019 1.814292 1.291665 −0.331592 −1.890037 1.572248 0.471975 −1.777230 1.158556 −0.657737 −1.567371 0.456663 −1.791449 1.209298 −0.537588 −1.710989 0.927494 −1.139744 −0.700973 −1.508626 0.275963 −1.923834 1.701 149 0.893918 −1.200901 −0.557826 −1.688820 0.852124 −1.273875 −0.377232 −1.857686 1.451007 0.105431 −1.988874 1.955631 1.824503 1.328822 −0.234222 −1.945130 1.783540 1.181027 −0.605166 −1.633764 0.669195 −1.552168 0.409236 −1.832516 1.358123 −0.155492 −1.975812 1.903845 1.624634 0.639446 −1.591099 0.531605 −1.717386 0.949426 −1.098581\n\n49. 36 Exploring the Fractal Universe The fate of the point only 0.00002 units further ‘west’, on the other hand, is very quickly decided, as we see in Table 2.2: As far as an Apple Mac is concerned, the numbers in that last line are infinite, and I doubt if even a Super Cray would disagree. So −2.00001 is definitely outside the M-set. On the Eastern, or positive side of the Set, the limit is not so easily defined. Obviously, it is closer to the origin (0,0) than the point + 1, which gives a value shooting off to infinity after only a few times round the loop. A few minutes’ work with pencil and paper shows that it is even closer than 0.5, for putting c = 1 /2 also gives a rapidly soaring Z. It is, in fact, at 0.25 – though this is by no means easy to prove. When I set c = 0.25 in the program I have painfully written, the screen is flooded with a torrent of numbers, which after hundreds of iterations finally settle down to the odd value 0.4998505. I assume that this should be exactly 0.5, with the difference due to rounding-off errors. In any event, Z doesn’t shoot off to infinity, so the Eastern limit of the M-set is definitely at 0.25. (On the centre line, that is; above and below, it bulges considerably further eastwards.) It’s interesting to check what happens when bracketing this value and setting c equal to 0.24999 and 0.25001. Table 2.3 gives the result of the first: Table 2.2 c = −2.00001 2.00003 2.00011 2.00043 2.00171 2.00683 2.02737 2.11023 2.45306 4.01748 14.14011 197.942 39,179.2 1.5E+9 2.4E+18 5.5E+36 3.1E+73 Table 2.3 c = .24999 .3124850 .3476369 .3708414 .3875133 .4181846 .4248683 .4305031 .4431468 .4463691 .4492353 .4562108 .4581183 .4598624 .4643020 .4655664 .4667420 .4698221 .4707228 .4715699 .4738342 .4745088 .4751486 .4768840 .4774084 .4779088 .4792815 .4797008 .4801028 .4812158 .4815586 .4818887 .4828091 .4830946 .4833704 .4001566 .4101153 .4353229 .4394960 .4518024 .4541154 .4614634 .4629385 .4678381 .4688625 .4723682 .4731217 .4757562 .4763340 .4783868 .4788439 .4804887 .4808594 .4822067 .4825133 .4833704 and then, after 12 more screens-full of figures …\n\n50. 37 A.C. Clarke Although all these calculations involve only the X-coordinate, and ignore complex numbers by setting Y = 0, they can be very time-consuming. Tables 2.3 and 2.4 dem- onstrate how impossible it would have been to discover – let alone map in detail! – the Mandelbrot Set before the advent of modern computers. Table 2.4 c = .25001 .3125150 .3476756 .3708883 .3875682 .4002191 .4305951 .4354222 .4493631 .4519372 .4600251 .4616331 .4669395 .4680425 .4718018 .4726070 .4754148 .4760292 .4101853 .4182620 .4249531 .4396025 .4432603 .4464897 .4542572 .4563596 .4582741 .4631151 .4644856 .4657569 .4690738 .4700402 .4709478 .4733673 .4740866 .4747681 and then, after some eight screens-full of figures… .5611078 .5648520 .5690677 .5738481 .5793116 .5856120 .5929514 .6016013 .61 19342 .6244734 .6399771 .6595806 .6850566 .7193126 .7674206 .8389443 .9538376 1.159816 1.595183 2.794620 8.059914 6.5E+1 4.3E+3 1.8E+7 3.3E+14 1.07E+29 1.1E+58 1.3E+116 1.7E+232 c = 0.25001 is therefore outside the M-set. .4968333 .4968333 .4968334 .4968334 .4968334 .4968334 .4968335 .4968335 .4968335 .4968335 .4968336 .4968336 .4968336 .4968337 .4968337 .4968337 .4968337 .4968338 .4968338 .4968338 .4968338 .4968339 .4968339 .4968339 .4968339 .4968339 .4968340 .4968340 .4968340 .4968340 .4968341 .4968341 .4968341 .4968341 .4968342 and so on forever. c = .24999 is therefore definitely inside the M-set. If we increase its value very slightly, to .25001, Table 2.4 reveals a quite different result, though it takes almost as long to arrive at it.\n\n51. Benoît Mandelbrot was born in Poland in 1924, and moved with his family to Paris in the 1930s where one of his uncles introduced him to the Julia sets. Despite what he calls ‘chaotic schooling’, Mandelbrot obtained his Ph.D. in Paris in 1952. A few years later he moved to the US, and became an IBM Fellow (now Fellow Emeritus) at the Thomas B. Watson Research Center in New York. He pursued his intuitions about fractals by using the rare opportunity of massive computer power to test and prove his idiosyncratic ideas. After prestigious uni- versity appointments in a variety of subjects, he joined the Yale faculty in 1987, where he is Sterling Professor of Mathematical Science. Mandelbrot is world-renowned for developing fractal geometry and discovering the Mandelbrot Set, named in his honour. He has written and lectured widely and has received numerous academic honours, including The Wolf Prize for Physics in 1993 and The Japan Prize for Science and Technology in 2003. 3 AGeometry AbletoInclude Mountainsand Clouds Benoît Mandelbrot This chapter originated in ‘A Lecture on Fractals’ delivered at a Nobel Conference at Gustavus Adolphus College in St Peter (Minnesota) in 1990. Mandelbrot’s wide-ranging presentation and the tenor of his responses in the discussion following the lecture demonstrate the ubiquity of fractals, from nature to art and from economics to physics.
