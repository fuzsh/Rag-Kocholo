        "text": "Mathematics has been one of the fundamental driving factors behind human society for at least three millennia, powering all of today’s technology and underpinning practically every facet of our everyday lives. However, today mathematics is underappreciated, misunderstood, and underrated.\n\nTo change that problem, British mathematician and popular science and science-fiction writer Ian Stewart have been doing his best to make people love mathematics. So far, he has published over 80 books, mainly on popular mathematics, and has received three gold medals for his contributions to science education.\n\nWe have curated Professor Stewart’s favorite math books for you. We believe that you will learn so many new things from them."
