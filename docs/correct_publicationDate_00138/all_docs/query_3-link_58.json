        "text": "Today we’re thrilled to reveal the cover for Ian Stewart’s upcoming far-future sci-fi novel Loophole.\n\nLoophole is a far-future big concept novel involving two universes joined by a wormhole pair that forms a ‘loophole’. An icemoon orbits through the loophole, shared between two different planetary systems in the two universes. One Universe has a civilisation with uploaded minds in virtual reality served by artificial humans. The other Universe has a ravening Horde of replicating machines that kill stars, and real humans from a decrepit system of colony worlds. Circulating between them on the icemoon is a race of hyperintelligent but somewhat vague aliens.\n\nSound good? Here’s the official blurb:\n\nDon’t poke your nose down a wormhole – you never know what you might find.\n\nTwo universes joined by a wormhole pair that forms a ‘loophole’, with an icemoon orbiting through the loophole, shared between two different planetary systems in the two universes.\n\nA civilisation with uploaded minds in virtual reality served by artificial humans.\n\nA ravening Horde of replicating machines that kill stars.\n\nReal humans from a decrepit system of colony worlds.\n\nA race of hyperintelligent but somewhat vague aliens.\n\nWho will close the loophole… who will exploit it?\n\nLoophole is being published by Elsewhen Press, the ebook is due for release 21st July, followed by the paperback on 21st August.
