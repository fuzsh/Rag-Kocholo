        "text": "Book Reviews\n\nNZ Review: A wonderfully readable adventure . . . An essential guide that illuminates how much of our understanding of the world, the past, and indeed the people around us, is shaped by the mathematician and the mapmaker. -- Edward Brooke-Hitching, author of The Phantom Atlas Opens our eyes to the use of 'mapmaking' in the broadest sense . . . If you have ever wondered why an airliner bound from London to Los Angeles flies over Greenland, how we know what lies inside the Earth, or how computers correct errors, then this is for you. I learned a lot. -- John Gribbin, author of Six Impossible Things I love maps. I love math. And gosh, do I love this book, which so beautifully and clearly sounds the depths of both. -- Ben Orlin, author of Math with Bad Drawings Blends broad subject expertise, magical storytelling skills and a splash of humour to ensure that the reader can joyfully navigate the maths of mapmaking. -- Bobby Seagull, author of The Life-Changing Magic of Numbers A highly readable account of how mathematics and mapmaking have joined forces to inform not only our view of the world, but our view of ourselves. The historical insights and human stories bring the whole topic vividly to life. -- Ian Stewart, author of What's the Use? This book blew my mind, again and again. Rowinska covers an astonishing range of topics from our brain to our planet, with personal stories and maths, yes, but also scrutinising the social and political impacts of maps on our lives. -- Roma Agrawal, author of Built Guides you elegantly, like a beautifully drawn map, through the fascinating stories behind centuries of map-making . . . Highly entertaining. -- Tim James, author of Fundamental Rowinska spins a fascinating story about the development of maps and maths. It's no exaggeration to say I learned something new on almost every page. -- Kit Yates, author of How to Expect the Unexpected Tackles the connections between maths and maps with aplomb . . . engaging, and thought-provoking, and perfectly encapsulates much of the essence of map-making. -- Kenneth Field, author of Cartography A delightful journey into the mathematics of maps, globes, and world travel. Paulina Rowinska has a beautiful writing style and a wealth of important knowledge - she will keep you engaged on every page. -- Jo Boaler, author of Limitless Mind A delightful book! . . . Along the way, we encounter many curious characters, and learn a surprising amount about history and psychology. But at the end of our journey, as we follow the twists and turns of Rowinska's marvellous and often humorous prose, without the use of any formulas, we come away with an appreciation of the beauty and power of mathematics. -- Arthur Benjamin, author of The Magic of Math What an incredible book! I was completely blown away by the sheer depth and profound impact maps have on how we humans see things, find things, make decisions, and even play politics. Paulina Rowinska's storytelling is pure magic, effortlessly bringing to life the history, science, and mind-bending mathematics behind it all. Truly, this book is an absolute gem! -- James Tanton, cofounder of The Global Math Project Maps a riveting route through the past, present and even the potential future of mathematics. I loved it, and I learnt a lot! * Mithuna Yoganathan *"
