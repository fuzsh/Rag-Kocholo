        "text": "In the grand tradition of Gregory Benford and Greg Bear, internationally popular scientists and acclaimed authors Dr. Ian Stewart and Dr. Jack Cohen come together again to create a brilliant new novel of huge, speculative ideas and suspenseful adventure. On the ocean world of No-Moon, mariner Second-Best Sailor learns that his planet is threatened by evangelists. A devoted acolyte of Cosmic Unity, Servant-of-Unity XIV Samuel lives to spread its gentle message of universal harmony... until he discovers a dark secret buried in his religion's memeplex. Abandoning his faith, Samuel stumbles upon Second-Best Sailor, who is fleeing No-Moon in search of a new homeworld. Flung together by fate and joined by fascinating and bizarre creatures, the two new allies plot a kamikaze plan to fight off the invaders. But can they bring down an idea that has destroyed everything across tens of thousands of light-years?"
