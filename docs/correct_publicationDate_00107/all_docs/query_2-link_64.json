        "text": "It was one of those events that you remember exactly where you were when it occurred.\n\nIn the summer of 1969, a friend and I were traveling through Europe on motorcycles.\n\nOn July 20, we were in a campground on the western coast of Italy.\n\nI joined a crowd gathering around a small, black-and-white television and watched in fascination.\n\nI cheered, with pride in the United States, just as the Italians, Germans, French and English around me cheered when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin stepped onto the surface of the moon.\n\nIt's hard to believe that was 40 years ago.\n\nThe first four chapters of Aldrin's new book coinciding with the anniversary - \"Magnificent Desolation\" - does a good job of re-creating the intricacies, the dangers, the excitement, the triumph of that first lunar landing.\n\nMagnificent desolation was the phrase Aldrin used to describe the moon's surface.\n\nAfter those first four chapters, however, Aldrin's book goes on a journey of another sort, one that has grown tiresome in these days of celebrity tell-all books about the struggles in their lives.\n\nWe long ago learned that the original astronauts were not choir boys. Aldrin was no exception.\n\nHe battled depression. He was an alcoholic. He was a womanizer. He divorced twice. And he offers hints that he carried a grudge about Armstrong being \"the first man on the moon,\" when he often didn't get a mention.\n\nThis book, which isn't particularly well written, takes the reader through those battles, finally ending with sobriety and a woman who help turns his life around.\n\nIf you are interested in a \"hero\" working through his weaknesses and foibles, one with a big ego who likes to drop names of famous people, you might find this book worthwhile.\n\nAs for me, I prefer the excitement of the Eagle landing in the Sea of Tranquility.\n\nron.littlepage@jacksonville.com, (904) 359-4284"
