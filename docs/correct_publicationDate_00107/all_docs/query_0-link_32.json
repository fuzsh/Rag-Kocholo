Aldrin And Barnes Present All The Realistic Strategies Needed To Keep The Dreams Of Spacealive.\n\nPublishers Description: It is a chronicle of two grand quests, two dynasties of heroes. A new space race is sparked by a bitter feud between scientist-astronaut Chris Terence and visionary entrepreneur Sig Jarlsbourg: two enemies determined to claim the frontier blazed by the Apollo pioneers. But a radio beacon from deep space, from a world called Tiber, will bring both men togetherùand lead one to his doom.Solving the Tiberian mystery becomes a legacy, driving ChrisÆs son and JarlsbourgÆs heir, Jason Terence, to found the first city on Mars, and leading their descendants beyond the confines of the solar system.Encounter with Tiber is the saga of another family as well. Its heroes were brave, desperate, ancient beings who learned all too well the precious fragility of lives and worlds. Beings who did indeed come to our ancestors in chariots of fireùand who proved to be anything but godsà\n\nISBN: 9780446518543"
