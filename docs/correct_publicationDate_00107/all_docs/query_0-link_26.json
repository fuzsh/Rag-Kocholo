        "text": "This Vintage, Men From Earth, hand-size paperback Dr. Buzz Aldrin Autographed Book, is from the personal collection of Dr. Buzz Aldrin.\n\nThe book is a “must add” to your space collection! Picking up where The Right Stuff left off, and originally written to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Apollo XI and the historic moonwalk, the book tells the incredible personal story of one of America’s premier astronauts, and also the entire story of the spirit and challenge of the Apollo Space Program. The book boasts 16 pages of photos\n\nThe book tells the tale of how on July 20, 1969, Apollo 11 astronauts Aldrin and Neil Armstrong landed their Lunar Module on the moon’s Sea of Tranquility and became the first two humans to walk on the moon. This unprecedented heroic endeavor was witnessed by the largest worldwide television audience in history. Marking the 20th Anniversary of the Apollo 11 lunar landing, Buzz publishes Men From Earth, a detailed and astonishing account of America’s race with the Soviets to the moon. The book ends with an epilogue venturing Outward, which looks toward future space travel through the year 2009.\n\nThe book is accompanied by a certificate of authenticity signed by a Buzz Aldrin Ventures Board of Director, with a piture depicting Aldrin signing the book.\n\nAutograph position, size and ink color may vary, as each item is uniquely signed by Dr. Buzz Aldrin."
