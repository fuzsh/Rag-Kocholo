        "text": "Buzz Aldrin was an American astronaut. He was the second man to walk on the Moon.\n\nEdwin Eugene Aldrin, Jr., was born on January 20, 1930, in Montclair, New Jersey. His family gave him the nickname “Buzz.” Buzz’s father was an aviator and a student of rocketry. Buzz was not a great student until he decided to become an aviator like his father. Then he worked hard to improve his grades. Buzz’s studying paid off when he was accepted at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York. In 1951 he graduated third in his class.\n\nAldrin became a pilot in the U.S. Air Force. He flew many combat missions in the Korean War. He went on to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he earned a doctorate in astronautics (the science of spacecraft) in 1963. Later that year the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) chose him to be an astronaut.\n\nDuring November 11–15, 1966, Aldrin made his first trip into space. He traveled with James A. Lovell, Jr., on a spacecraft called Gemini 12. Aldrin spent 5 1/2 hours on a spacewalk outside the craft.\n\nAldrin’s next space mission was aboard Apollo 11, which lifted off on July 16, 1969. Apollo 11 carried Aldrin, Neil Armstrong, and Michael Collins to the Moon. On July 20, Armstrong and Aldrin stepped out onto the surface of the Moon. There they collected samples of Moon soil and took photographs. The mission ended on July 24 with splashdown in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nAldrin retired from NASA in 1971. In 1998 he founded the ShareSpace Foundation, an organization to promote space travel."
