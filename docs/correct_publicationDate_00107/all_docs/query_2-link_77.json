        "text": "Some of us at 42courses are huge sci-fi lovers.\n\nChris Rawlinson, the company founder, in particular, is a huge fan of all sci-fi and anything to do with space and time.\n\nThe Order of Time for instance is one of Chris’ fave books, apart from Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, of course.\n\nI consume a huge amount of audiobooks while out walking my dogs and running many hours for marathon training, and one of this week’s books is ‘No dream is too high’, the autobiography of Buzz Aldrin.\n\nYou know who Buzz Aldrin is, don’t you?\n\nHe’s the second person in human history to step foot on a celestial body other than Earth… right after Neil Armstrong.\n\nBut Buzz has some firsts to his name.\n\nHe pioneered underwater astronaut training, to simulate zero gravity, which led to him carrying out a 5-hour space walk in 1966 - which was 3 years before Apollo 11 landed on the moon.\n\nHe also was the first to hold a religious ceremony on the moon, as he took communion whilst in the lunar module.\n\nBuzz took the first selfie in space too!\n\nAnother first to his name is that Buzz was first to take a pee on the moon…\n\n1. Be innovative, always.\n\nBuzz says that you should constantly seek to change and improve everything you do, especially at work.\n\nYou should definitely avoid at all costs anybody who says any variation of, “We have never done it like that before”.\n\nBefore becoming an astronaut, Buzz was a fighter pilot and also a scientist.\n\nHe wrote a thesis Line-of-Sight Guidance Techniques for Manned Orbital Rendezvous which proposed a solution to safely rendezvous and dock spacecraft in lunar orbit.\n\nThis innovative idea directly led to Buzz being invited to become an astronaut… and changed his life forever.\n\n2. Let your family and friends know you love them\n\nIn 1967, Buzz learnt that life is never guaranteed.\n\nIn the Apollo 1 launch disaster, where 3 astronauts died in a catastrophic capsule fire on the launch pad, Buzz lost his best friend Ed White.\n\nObviously, it was unexpected and Buzz never got the chance to tell Ed how much his friendship meant to him.\n\nSo, in the book, Buzz pleads with the reader to write a handwritten note or call your friends and family today to let them truly know how much you care for them.\n\n3. Choose your best friends wisely\n\nThe astronauts spent a huge amount of time training together.\n\nThey spun ideas off each other, helped each other and played hard together.\n\nThey were ultra competitive due to the fact that they were competing for a prized spot on a mission to space.\n\nSo Buzz says that you should carefully choose the friends who will bring out the best in you.\n\nAs he writes, “Show me your friends and I'll show you your future”.\n\nHe believes that you will become the average of your 5 closest friends.\n\nSo, it’s best not to associate too closely with negative people, as that influence will rub off on you somehow.\n\nWhilst very friendly, the astronauts are still competitive with each other to this day, and this constant challenge still inspires Buzz in his senior years.\n\n4. Be persistent\n\nYou have to follow your passion and dream, despite the many setbacks that will definitely fall in your path.\n\nYou should approach everything with an optimism that you are getting nearer to your aim even though it may seem like there is a negative obstacle in your way.\n\nWhen Buzz applied to be an astronaut at first, he didn't get accepted.\n\nAll astronaut candidates up to that point had been test pilots, which Buzz wasn’t - he was a fighter pilot, with a different skill set.\n\nHowever, due to the innovation of his rendezvous thesis (see above), Buzz got into the space program at the second time of asking.\n\nDue to this delay in starting his training, it meant that Buzz was the right man at the right time to do his Gemini 12 spacewalk.\n\nIf he had become an astronaut earlier, he would have been too early to take this opportunity.\n\nAnd because of that spacewalk, Buzz again hit the perfect timing to be selected for the Apollo 11 mission and that history-making moon landing.\n\nYou just never know what leads to that next big moment of progression.\n\nAlthough Neil Armstrong was the first man on the moon and we are predisposed to be more interested in firsts, Buzz came to accept that his contribution was pivotal to the mission’s success.\n\nLet’s take a direct quote from the book here, as Buzz says it best…\n\n“All work is noble.\n\nSo, do your best whether you are first, second or last.\n\nNever lose an opportunity because you were too lazy to give it your best effort.\n\nCertainly you need rest and recuperation, but keep those in balance with hard work.\n\nRemember that while you are partying, there is someone else who is working hard to succeed.\n\nIt’s OK to be second as long as you do the best you can do.”\n\n6. Ask for help when you need it.\n\nDue to global fame and the ridiculous highs (quite literally) of the most historic space travel of all time, in subsequent years, Buzz found life a bit flat, lacking in meaningful things and hard to find happiness.\n\nIt was difficult for him to find motivation to do the normal everyday tasks of a working life, after achieving something that no humans had ever done before.\n\nSo, he struggled for many years with bouts of alcoholism and series of depressions.\n\nHe only managed to turn this around when he actually acknowledged that he needed help and reached out for help from professionals.\n\nBuzz credits this as one of the most important moments of his amazing life.\n\nSo, never be afraid to tell yourself that it is all a bit too much and get hep from people who can properly give you aid.\n\nAs Buzz says, even as a macho fighter pilot and astronaut, he finally understood that asking for help is not a sign of weakness, but a sign of true strength."
