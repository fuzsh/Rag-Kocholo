Octavo, original half blue cloth, original dust jacket.\n\nFirst edition of the second man on the moon’s first science fiction novel, signed by Aldrin on the title page.\n\n“When a former astronaut writes science fiction, you have every reason to expect that it will champion the benefits of space travel against the doubters and penny pinchers in the scientific and political establishment. Encounter with Tiber delivers the goods, and then some” (New York Times).\n\nBoards with slightest sunning to edges. A very nearly fine signed copy."
