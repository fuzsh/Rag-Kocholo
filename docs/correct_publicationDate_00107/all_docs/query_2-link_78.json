He is a world-class hero, a larger-than-life figurehead, best known of a generation of astronauts whose achievements surged in just a few years from first man in space to first men on the moon. Now he pauses to reflect and share what he has learned, from the vantage point not only of outer space but also of time: still a non-stop traveler and impassioned advocate for space exploration, Aldrin will be 86 in 2016.\n\nNo Dream Is Too High whittles down Buzz Aldrin’s event-filled life into a short list of principles he values, each illustrated by fascinating anecdotes and memories, such as:\n\n· Second comes right after first. NASA protocol should have meant he was first on the moon, but rules changed just before the mission. How he learned to be proud of being the second man on the moon.\n\n· Look for opportunities, not obstacles. Buzz was rejected the first time he applied to be an astronaut. Failure is an opportunity to learn to do better.\n\n· Always maintain your spirit of adventure. For his 80th birthday, Buzz went diving in the Galapagos and hitched a ride on a whale shark. He stays fit, energetic, and fascinated with life.\n\nNo Dream Is Too High is a beautiful memento, a thought-provoking set of ideas, and a new opportunity for Buzz Aldrin to connect with the masses of people who recognize his unique place in human history.\n\nAbout No Dream Is Too High\n\nBeloved American hero and astronaut Buzz Aldrin reflects on the wisdom, guiding principles, and irreverent anecdotes he’s gathered—both in outer space and on earth—through his event-filled life, in this inspiring guide-to-life for the next generation.\n\nEverywhere he goes, crowds gather to meet Buzz Aldrin.
