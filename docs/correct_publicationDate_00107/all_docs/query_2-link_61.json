        "text": "These books could be considered historic memoirs. As each astronaut was a unique personality—from Neil Armstrong’s cool demeanor to Pete Conrad’s fast Corvette style—each book has its own character and focus. Certainly, all include biographical details of the astronauts’ early family lives, their military and test pilot careers, and personal recollections of their space missions. Some are nearly a travelogue, such as Jim Lovell’s Lost Moon, the Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13. Some focus on the space program with a wider lens, for example, Deke! U.S. Manned Space: From Mercury to the Shuttle, by Deke Slayton.\n\nOthers tend to be more personal, including Buzz Aldrin’s book, No Dream Is Too High: Life Lessons from a Man Who Walked on the Moon, which explores his challenges in life after Apollo 11.\n\nAn unusual one is Apollo: An Eyewitness Account by Artist /Astronaut /Moonwalker Alan Bean, which is an art book of paintings by Apollo 12 lunar module pilot and moonwalker, Alan Bean.\n\nTo get even further out, into the mystical realm, read The Way of the Explorer: An Apollo Astronaut’s Journey Through the Material and Mystical Worlds by Edgar D. Mitchell or To Rule the Night: The Discovery Voyage of Astronaut Jim Irwin.\n\nFrom Alan Shepard, America’s first man in space, to Gene Cernan, America’s last astronaut on the moon, there are many aspects of the space race era to explore from the comfort of your favorite easy chair.

Klausner\n\nOK, this was not written by Pete (Apollo 12 commander), but it’s an insider memoir by his wife, albeit number two; she knew him well.\n\nApollo: An Eyewitness Account by Artist/Astronaut /Moonwalker Alan Bean\n\nBy Alan Bean and Andrew Chaikin\n\nA bit different than most astronaut books, this is a collection of paintings by the Apollo 12 lunar module pilot and moonwalker.\n\nApollo 13: The “Houston, we have a problem” mission.\n\nLost Moon, the Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13\n\nBy Jim Lovell, Apollo 13 commander, and Jeffrey Kluger\n\nNever Panic Early: An Apollo 13 Astronaut’s Journey\n\nBy Fred Haise, Apollo 13 lunar module pilot, and Bill Moore\n\nApollo 14: First to land on the lunar highlands.\n\nThe Way of the Explorer: An Apollo Astronaut’s Journey Through the Material and Mystical Worlds\n\nBy Edgar D.

It was written by Lindbergh immediately after his flight and rushed into print."
