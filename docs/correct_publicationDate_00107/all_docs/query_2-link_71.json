        "text": "Hardcover. Condition: Good. First Edition. A book written by Buzz. American astronaut who became the second person to walk on the Moon. Aldrin graduated with honors from West Point in 1951 and subsequently flew jet fighters in the Korean War. Upon returning to academic work, he earned a Ph.D. in astronautics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, devising techniques for manned space rendezvous that would be used on future NASA missions including the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. Aldrin was selected for astronaut duty in October 1963 and in November 1966 established a new spacewalk duration record on the Gemini 9 mission. As backup Command Module pilot for Apollo 8 he improved operational techniques for astronautical navigation star display. Then, on July 20, 1969, Aldrin and Neil Armstrong made their historic Apollo 11 moonwalk.\n\nHardcover. Condition: Very Good. Dust Jacket Condition: Very Good. 1st Edition. 338+[1 biographic] pages with frontispiece and and photographs. Octavo (8 1/2\" x 5 3/4\") bound in quarter blue cloth with gilt lettering to spine over blue blind-stamped boards in original pictorial jacket. First edition. In this first candid \"inside\" look at the human side of the space program, it is the story of Buzz Aldrin, who returned to earth from the historic first landing on the moon to begin a long and troubled odyssey--an ordeal that involved a secret mental depression and the near dissolution of his marriage. It is the revelation, in Aldrin's own words, of one of the most daring exploits in history and of what happened afterward: The intense training. The celebrated first touchdown on the moon. The instant--and unexpected--fame and notoriety, and the difficult adjustment of becoming a public personality. The demanding world-wide public relations tour for NASA for which his rigid training, from West Point through the astronaut corps, had never prepared him. The near impossibility of reconciling his public image as a hero to the realities of being a husband, father and pilot -academician. Condition: Previous owner's name on front end paper, sunning to head edges else a very good copy in like jacket.\n\nBound in paper-covered boards and woven cloth spined stamped in red gold. Heavy sunning has faded the top and bottom of the edges of the boards and transferred a shadowy imprint of the white lettering on the front of the dust jacket. The book is internally very good and clean throughout. In a lovely, very good plus original dust jacket priced at $7.95.
