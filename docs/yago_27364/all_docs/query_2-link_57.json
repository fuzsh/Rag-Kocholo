        "meta_description": "Ronald Reagan est connu pour la révolution conservatrice qu’il a lancée aux Etats-Unis. Son conservatisme était bien sûr économique, mais il avait également une forte dimension morale et culturelle. La carrière politique de Reagan s’est déroulée en parallèle avec l’émergence et le développement du mouvement féministe aux Etats-Unis, sa première élection en Californie datant de 1966. Mais dès le début, Reagan montra la plus grande incompréhension envers le combat mené par les militantes féministes. Ancré dans une vision traditionnelle, voire archaïque, des rapports hommes-femmes et du rôle des femmes dans la société contemporaine, il a fait de l’opposition aux grandes conquêtes féministes (comme le droit à l’avortement) l’un des principaux éléments de son corpus idéologique. Pourtant, arrivé au pouvoir, il a largement échoué à imposer sa vision anti-féministe, preuve que la société américaine était bien plus ouverte que son président sur ces questions-là.",

        "text": "Her career and what would happen to it had entered my mind once or twice, and while I knew I’d be happier if the career ran second—way behind—I knew also I could never say ‘give it up.’\n\n2But he “should not have worried” because he had found in her his perfect woman. Indeed\n\nit was ingrained in her to simply say, “If you try to make two careers work, one of them has to suffer.” She was fair. She said, “Maybe some women can do it, but not me.” (Reagan 1965, 273-274)\n\n3And thus did Nancy Reagan become a supportive housewife for the rest of her life. Given this very particular background, Ronald Reagan was no friend of the feminist movement which had emerged in the Sixties. Its demands regarding work, reproductive health, or political participation, threatened to weaken the foundations of his idealized interpretation of gender roles. Women’s groups were consequently worried when Ronald Reagan ran for the presidency on an anti-feminist agenda in 1980 and won. But his anti-feminist initiatives ran into many obstacles and his presidency paradoxically marked a period of progress for many American women.\n\nAn anti-feminist agenda\n\n3 Ronald Reagan’s Religion, International Christian Ministries article, folder “Hannaford – Californi (...)\n\nthe time ha[d] come to turn to God and reassert our trust in Him for our great nation’s healing. We need to join forces to reclaim the great principles embodied in the Judeo-Christian traditions and in Holy Scriptures.\n\n5Concretely, for candidate Reagan in 1980, this vision meant two things above anything else. The first one was abortion, and he promised to support, if he were elected, a constitutional amendment banning abortion everywhere in the country. The question had become central for the Christian Right and, as it happened, Reagan had a lot to expiate in this regard. Despite his moral conservatism, as Governor of California, he had signed a law in 1967 which had legalized abortion in the state (interestingly, it seems that Nancy Reagan played a relative role in convincing her husband to sign this law) (Colacello 361). During his presidential campaign, Reagan found an interesting way to explain this decision. Deep down, he had always condemned abortion since “interrupting a pregnancy means the taking of a human life.” If he had signed a “permissive bill,” it was only because of his “inexperience.” He had been in office for less than a year when the state legislators had voted for this bill. Before signing it, he had done a lot of thinking and had concluded that “it could only be justified to save a human life.” But then this definition was broadened to include the “health of the mother” (“meaning the permanent damage to the health of a mother if she went through her pregnancy.”). This made sense to him as well, so he signed the law without realizing that this health exception was a “loophole that I had not seen” which led to the “violation of the spirit of the legislation by the very groups who were supposed to police it,” in particular “psychiatrists” who, according to him, abusively justified too many abortions. But he had learned his lesson, he was sorry, and he was now staunchly opposed to abortion (Reagan 2004, 197-198).\n\n6The second moral priority for candidate Reagan was the ERA. The Equal Rights Amendment, which aimed at inscribing gender equality in the Constitution (“Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.”) had been voted by Congress in 1972. The following step was its ratification by three-quarters of the states, which many conservative groups were trying to prevent—an effort enthusiastically supported by Reagan in 1980. Even more than the question of abortion, his arguments regarding the ERA may be the best way to understand his conception of women’s rights. The first thing to stress is that Reagan was a smart politician and that when he criticized the ERA, he took pains to say that this did not mean he did not believe in gender equality. Rather, he believed the ERA was the wrong way to guarantee gender equality and that it would actually hurt women. In his convention speech, he explained that despite his opposition to the ERA, he would “establish a liaison with the 50 governors to encourage them to eliminate, where it exists, discrimination against women.” (Reagan, Convention Speech).\n\n7However, this apparent concern for women betrayed a traditional conception of gender roles in modern American society and a stark refusal to consider any evolution in the typical post-war myth of the suburban nuclear family where the father was the breadwinner and the mother the homemaker. For example, like many anti-ERA activists, Reagan was convinced that the ERA would force women to be drafted into the military. This was a bad thing according to him, not because women did not necessarily want to become soldiers, but because the “high physical or skill standards” of the military “would have to be equal for men and women, so many standards might have to be lowered, and the quality of the military would deteriorate.” Similarly, he was worried about the economic impact of the ERA on divorced women, not because it may be hard to force deadbeat fathers to pay their alimony, but because women would have to leave the domestic sphere—as if the presence of women, even mothers, in the workplace had not already become a reality by 1980, a reality of which Ronald Reagan was seemingly unaware:\n\n4 ERA Talking Points, folder “Meese, Ed – Background Material – Issues, 1979 (1)”, Box 159, Series II (...)\n\nTraditionally, a divorced woman with small children has been entitled to support payments from the father, since caring for her children prevented her from holding a job. … The availability of day care centers would permit a woman to ‘support herself through employment’. Thus… she might be forced to place her children in day care centers eight hours a day so that she could work to support them.\n\n11In this context, women’s groups were unsurprisingly harsh in their criticism of the Reagan campaign. For Reagan himself, this made no sense and, rather condescendingly, he blamed them for this situation. He saw himself as a great champion of women’s rights. As he explained to NOW (the National Organization for Women):\n\nAs governor [of California], I signed legislation to prohibit sexual discrimination in employment and business matters, [and] bills to establish the right of married women to obtain credit in their own name and […] to allow married women to buy and sell securities in their own name, [to] equalize a woman’s right to change her name, […] to extend state unemployment disability insurance benefits to pregnant employees and to increase the penalties for rape.\n\nAn Anti-feminist President\n\n14Such statistics did not really trouble President Reagan for two main reasons. First, as during the past, he considered himself a friend of women and he still could not bring himself to try to understand the animosity of women’s groups towards the White House. As he confided in his diary one night:\n\nWatched some TV in bed and saw Gloria Steinem take me over the coals for being a bigot and against women. Either she is totally ignorant of my positions which I doubt or she is a deliberate liar (Reagan 2007, 13).\n\n15 Letter to William F. Buckley, September 6, 1983, folder “Folder 95 (8/20/83-9/6/83)”, Box 7, Presid (...)\n\nwhen I think or I hear the word ‘woman’—true, I don’t think of Lady Macbeth but then I don’t think of Florence Nightingale either. I think of Nancy Reagan and Pat Buckley. Do you mind?\n\n17As for the issues women’s groups were fighting for, they were “unacceptable” for the White House. In the 1980s, American women’s groups focused their legislative agenda on the Women’s Economic Equity Act, a bill targeting the main obstacles encountered by working women (like pay discrimination or the shortage of day care centers in the US). Most Republican women in Congress supported the EEA, yet Reagan and his staff did not. They were convinced it was a bad law and it would therefore be folly to support it just “for the sake of doing something for women,” as they put it. The arguments against the EEA they used among themselves are helpful to understand the substance of conservative anti-feminism. First, the law went “against the basic thrust” of Reagan’s philosophy, both politically and morally. Politically, it would have given the federal government new anti-discrimination powers which went beyond what they, as small-government conservatives who had promised in 1980 to reduce Washington’s interventionist apparatus, called “its appropriate role.” As for financially helping divorced women, this was morally inadmissible in the eyes of the Reaganites. It was “unfair” to married women and it would end up “undermin[ing] families”―one of the deepest laments of social conservatives who, since the cultural upheavals of the Sixties and the rise in the number of divorces, working women, female-headed households, and same-sex families, had grown extremely worried about the redefinition of the concept of ‘family’ apart from their own religious and gender-based vision (Christensen 288-291):\n\nThe more the government goes about eliminating all the economic advantages of remaining married, creating positive incentives to ‘going it alone’, and setting itself as a substitute spouse, the more it will contribute to the breakup of the American family.\n\n18The administration was also reluctant to use the very concept of “wage disparity.” For Reagan and his advisors, it was “an idea we know to be false.” Admittedly, they were ready to recognize a “pay gap” existed between men and women, but they disagreed with feminists who blamed it on gender discrimination. For the Reaganites, this situation was explained by “different experience levels:” men made more than women because they had more seniority and because they worked “for longer periods of time” throughout their lives (37 years against 26 on average). They also stressed other “non-discriminatory factors” like “lower mobility of married women, refusal to accept as much overtime, refusal to accept supplementary training etc.”—as if these were not related to the specific difficulties met by working mothers in the United States. But the most fundamental problem of the EEA, for the administration, was what it symbolized about the evolution of gender roles in contemporary America. Its bottom line was to help women work and this was not a good idea. The debate over the EEA took place mostly in 1982-1983, at the end of the terrible economic recession which affected the United States after Reagan’s election. The coming economic recovery was in the eyes of the administration a great opportunity which should not be missed. First, because the unemployment rate would go down; and secondly, and maybe more importantly, because it would finally allow women to go back to their traditional domestic responsibilities. As one White House memo put it:\n\n18 Update on Women’s Issues, June 30, 1983, folder “OA 11841, Women’s Issues (8)”, Box 52, Meese, Edwi (...)\n\nas real wages once again begin to rise, women who have been forced into the labor market to help buttress eroding family incomes will once again be freer to stay at home and care for their children.\n\nPragmatism, Political Acumen, and Women’s Issues\n\n21The most striking thing when comparing the conservative promises of candidate Reagan in 1980 and the record of President Reagan in 1988 is that, as far as women’s issues are concerned, Reagan was an utter failure—except regarding the ERA, although the fact that it was not ratified by enough states in the end was arguably due more to conservative activists at the grassroots level than to his own actions.\n\n23 One can note that this passage was not drafted by Reagan's team of speechwriters but was added by R (...)\n\nI know many well-intentioned, sincerely motivated people believe that government intervention violates a womans [sic] right of choice. And they would be right if there were any proof that the unborn are not living human beings. Medical evidence indicates to the contrary. […]\n\nDoesn't the Constitutional protection of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness extend to the unborn unless it can be proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that life doesn't exist?\n\n31 Ed Thomas Memorandum, July 27, 1981, folder “OA 2408, Appointments – Supreme Court – O’Connor (1)”, (...)\n\nthere [was] a real likelihood that this [was] going to grow into a major issue, whereby the President [would] lose the support of those people [the evangelical community] who ha[d] backed him for years.\n\n33 Sandra Say O’Connor letter, October 13, 1981, folder “Folder 11 (10/11/81-10/16/81)”, Box 1, Presid (...)\n\nI … want to thank you on behalf of all women for making the historic decision to name a woman to the Supreme Court. My appointment has probably done more to give women confidence in true equal opportunity than a thousand speeches.\n\n29Reagan is one of the great transformational presidents in the history of the United States. Yet, one has to admit that he did not transform all walks of life equally. The economy and the international position of the country were deeply changed by his presidency. And in many ways, so were the lives of American women. But this change went in an unexpected direction. By 1980, given the obvious hostility of Ronald Reagan to women’s issues, fearing the worst after his election was a natural reaction. But in reality, in most respects, the lives of American women improved during the Reagan years and most of the progress of the 1970s was consolidated, despite the death of the ERA. Women kept their reproductive rights, they entered universities and the professions in record numbers, one of them was sitting on the Supreme Court, and millions of them benefited from the strong prosperity that returned after 1982. In other words, even though Reagan was almost ontologically unable to understand their lives, their struggles, and their demands, he and his advisors were also smart enough to realize that, in contemporary America, it would probably be political suicide to make oneself an obstacle on the path of women. This calculation worked. In the presidential election of 1984, even though the Democratic Party made history by nominating Geraldine Ferraro for the vice-presidency―the first time ever a woman appeared on a presidential ticket―the gender gap was actually reversed compared to 1980 and Ronald Reagan won a large majority of the women’s vote (58%) (Brookhiser 279; Cannon 1991, 493-494; Abramson, Aldrich and Rohde, 136-137; Ehrman, 217). In the end, his pragmatism and political acumen had served him well, a lesson lost on future generations of Republican leaders."
