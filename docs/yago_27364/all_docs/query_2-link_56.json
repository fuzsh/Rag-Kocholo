        "text": "Introduction\n\n(1911–2004). In a stunning electoral landslide, Ronald Reagan was elected the 40th president of the United States in 1980. A former actor known for his folksy charm and confident ease as a public speaker, the Great Communicator, as he was sometimes called, won the votes of divergent groups who had not traditionally supported the Republican Party. He defeated Jimmy Carter, the incumbent Democratic president, by an electoral vote of 489 to 49. In 1984 Reagan was reelected with an unprecedented 525 electoral votes.\n\nReagan was considered to be the most conservative candidate to win the office in half a century. He was a critic of social-welfare programs, an advocate of a strong military, and a zealous opponent of communism. He was also one of the few men to become president who had not spent the major part of his life in politics or in a closely related public service profession. For 30 years he had been primarily an entertainer in radio, motion pictures, and television. Although he had been active in political causes, he did not become a candidate for public office until he was in his mid-50s.\n\nEarly Life\n\nRonald Wilson Reagan was born on February 6, 1911, in Tampico, Illinois, a small town in the northwestern part of the state. He was the second of two sons born to John Edward Reagan (called Jack) and Nelle Wilson Reagan. His nickname, Dutch, came from his father’s habit of referring to his infant son as his “fat little Dutchman.” Jack Reagan was a Democrat known for his outspoken opposition to racial bigotry. Nelle Reagan, who was more conservative, gave dramatic readings at women’s clubs, hospitals, and jails.\n\nJack Reagan was a shoe salesman who moved his family from one small town to another in Illinois. When Ronald was nine, the family settled in Dixon, Illinois. His father opened a shoe store with a former boss, but it soon failed. Jack Reagan later held a minor government job distributing relief checks during the Great Depression. Nelle Reagan helped out by working in a dress shop. She taught Ronald how to read at an early age. Although he was slight and nearsighted, he liked athletics. Beginning at age 14, he held part-time and summer jobs. His first job was as a construction laborer. For several years he was a summer lifeguard.\n\nIn high school and college Reagan showed his ability in the three fields that came to dominate his life—sports, drama, and politics. At Eureka College in Eureka, Illinois, he was a varsity guard on the football team and was captain of the swimming team; he also participated in track. A member of the drama club, he had roles in college dramatic productions. As president of the freshman class he helped organize a student strike against cutbacks in the curriculum, which led to the resignation of the president of the college. Reagan later was president of the student body. Although he earned only passing grades, he graduated in 1932 with a bachelor’s degree in economics and sociology.\n\nRadio, Movies, and Television\n\nTrying to launch a career in show business, Reagan auditioned for radio station WOC in Davenport, Iowa, by improvising play-by-play commentary for a football game. He was hired to announce the University of Iowa football games for $10 a game, and by the end of 1932 he became a staff announcer.\n\nThe next year Reagan was transferred to an affiliated station, WHO, in Des Moines. An announcer there until 1937, he also wrote a sports column for a newspaper. Among his duties was broadcasting Chicago Cubs baseball games from ticker tapes.\n\nWhile at the Cubs training camp in California in 1937, Reagan took a screen test for the Warner Brothers studio. He was signed to a contract at $200 a week. During the following 27 years he appeared in more than 50 movies. In his first movie, Love Is on the Air, Reagan played a radio announcer. Throughout his career he most often had supporting roles, frequently as the sidekick of the hero. In only his last film, The Killers, was Reagan cast as a villain. Among his best-known movies were Brother Rat, Dark Victory, Knute Rockne—All American, and King’s Row.\n\nWhile filming Brother Rat in 1938, Reagan met Jane Wyman, another Warners contract player. Married in 1940, they had a daughter, Maureen Elizabeth, in 1941; in 1945 they adopted a son, Michael Edward. In 1948 they divorced.\n\nDuring World War II Reagan was a member of the Army Air Corps, but he was rejected for active duty because of his poor eyesight. He spent the war years narrating training films and was discharged with the rank of captain in 1945.\n\nReagan served six terms—from 1947 to 1952 and in 1959–60—as president of the Screen Actors Guild, the union of movie actors. He helped achieve better pay, revised tax procedures, and improved working conditions for actors. Beginning in 1949, Reagan served two terms as chairman of the Motion Picture Industry Council.\n\nMilitantly anticommunist, Reagan appeared in 1947 as a cooperative witness before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, which was investigating communist influence in the movie industry. He cooperated with the movie studios’ infamous policy of blacklisting, or refusing to employ actors, directors, and writers suspected of having communist sympathies.\n\nIn 1952 Reagan married the actress Nancy Davis. Their daughter, Patricia Ann, was born in 1952, and their son, Ronald Prescott, was born in 1958. In 1957 Reagan and his wife appeared together in the war movie Hellcats of the Navy. The Reagans had a large ranch where they raised horses and cattle.\n\nAfter having performed on several television programs, in 1954 Reagan began an eight-year association with the General Electric Company. He was the host and program supervisor for the popular television series General Electric Theater, and he occasionally appeared as an actor in the series. As part of his contract, Reagan also spent several weeks each year speaking to General Electric employees throughout the country. During these talks he frequently defended free enterprise and criticized big government. Between 1964 and 1966 Reagan hosted and occasionally acted in the Death Valley Days series.\n\nPolitical Commitments\n\nDuring the 1930s and ’40s Reagan was a liberal Democrat and a member of liberal political organizations, including the United World Federalists and the Americans for Democratic Action. He greatly admired Franklin D. Roosevelt, and in 1948 he supported President Harry S. Truman for reelection. But his political opinions gradually grew more conservative. After first supporting Democratic senatorial candidate Helen Douglas in 1950, he switched his allegiance to Republican Richard Nixon midway through the campaign. In the presidential campaigns of 1952 and 1956 he worked as a Democrat for Dwight D. Eisenhower, and in 1960 he backed Nixon. In 1962 he officially switched his registration to the Republican Party and also supported a member of the right-wing John Birch Society in an unsuccessful Congressional bid.\n\nIn 1964 Reagan supported Senator Barry Goldwater, a conservative Republican candidate for president. His televised appeal for Goldwater was the most successful fund-raising political speech in history. It catapulted Reagan onto the national political stage.\n\nWith the support of businessmen and other conservative backers Reagan entered the 1966 race for the governorship of California. He defeated his moderate Republican opponent in the primary and then conducted a campaign on such issues as welfare, student dissidents, crime, and “big government.” Although registered Democrats outnumbered Republicans by three to two in the state, Reagan won by nearly a million votes. He was reelected in 1970.\n\nAs governor of California, Reagan was not wholly successful in carrying out his conservative programs. During his two terms the state had its largest budget increases in history and spending nearly doubled. Partly because of previous deficits, Reagan increased taxes at a rate greater than the national average, and taxes became more progressive. California voters rejected his proposal to limit state spending and levels of taxation. Reagan did, however, accomplish some of his goals. He vetoed 994 bills passed by the state legislature, and all but one of the vetoes were upheld.\n\nSeveral of Reagan’s accomplishments during his terms as governor were highly regarded, even by his political opponents. He doubled aid to schools and increased expenditures for mental health by 400 percent. He cooperated with the legislature in reforming the state’s welfare system by restricting eligibility and reducing the number of people receiving benefits, while increasing benefits for the most needy. Reagan signed the most stringent air and water pollution bills in the country and promoted judicial reform.\n\nNational Politics\n\nIn 1968, while serving his first term as governor of California, Reagan announced his candidacy for president during the Republican convention. As a conservative alternative to Nixon, the front-runner, Reagan received only 14 percent of the delegate votes, and Nixon was nominated.\n\nReagan’s disagreement with the foreign policy of President Gerald R. Ford led him to enter the 1976 race for the Republican nomination. Reagan defeated Ford in several primaries, but he did not enter primaries in enough large states to win a clear majority of the delegates. Reagan lost the nomination to Ford by only 117 delegate votes.\n\nIn 1979 Reagan again entered the race for the Republican presidential nomination. Although opposed by some prominent contenders, he won several primaries and large numbers of delegates in state caucuses. By May 1980 Reagan had enough delegates to win the nomination.\n\nThe Republican platform was tailored to suit Reagan’s views. It advocated large tax cuts, decreased government spending for social programs, increased military spending, and a more aggressive foreign policy. Reagan chose George Bush, who had been his most successful opponent in the primaries, as his vice-presidential running mate.\n\nAfter the convention Reagan lost the large lead he had held over President Jimmy Carter, and the candidates were often tied in the polls. Even though Reagan was often criticized for not being specific, his ability as a speaker helped him project a favorable image. His strong performance in a debate with Carter one week before the election was credited with winning over a large number of voters. On election day Reagan defeated Carter and John Anderson (who ran as an independent) with slightly more than half the popular vote, against Carter’s 41 percent and Anderson’s 7 percent. At age 69, Reagan was the oldest person to be elected president.\n\nPresidency\n\nThe first months of Reagan’s presidency were dramatic. Just after his inauguration he announced that Iran had agreed to release the American hostages who had been held captive at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran since November 1979. Then, in an assassination attempt by John Hinckley, Jr., on March 30, 1981, Reagan was shot in the chest while leaving a hotel in Washington, D.C. After surgery to remove the bullet from his left lung, he recuperated quickly and returned to his duties.\n\nDomestic Policy\n\nFrom the beginning of his presidency Reagan tried to reduce the role of the federal government. His administration set a new tone, indicated in such themes as “getting the government off the backs of the people” and not letting it spend more than it takes in. He proposed massive tax cuts and increased defense spending as well as significant reductions in spending on social-welfare programs such as education, food stamps, and low-income housing. In 1981 Congress passed most of the president’s budget proposals.\n\nA severe recession in 1982 lessened the appeal of so-called Reaganomics. The country’s unemployment rate climbed to nearly 11 percent, the highest it had been since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Bankruptcies and farm foreclosures reached record levels. The country’s trade deficit increased from $25 billion in 1980 to $111 billion in 1984. In addition, the huge increases in military spending, combined with insufficient cuts in other programs, produced the largest budget deficits in the country’s history. To address the deficit problem, Reagan made a policy reversal and supported a tax increase in 1982.\n\nBy early 1983 the economy had begun to recover, and by the end of that year unemployment and inflation were significantly reduced. The strong recovery aided Reagan’s landslide reelection over the Democrat Walter Mondale in 1984. Economic growth continued through the remainder of Reagan’s presidency. Critics charged, however, that the tax cuts and the fruits of economic growth benefited mainly the wealthy and that the gap between rich and poor had grown wider.\n\nIn keeping with his aim of reducing the role of government in the country’s economy, Reagan cut the budgets of many government departments. He also relaxed or ignored the enforcement of laws and regulations administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of the Interior, the Department of Transportation, and the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice—among other agencies.\n\nDuring his presidency Reagan appointed three justices to the Supreme Court. They were Sandra Day O’Connor, the first woman justice; Antonin Scalia; and Anthony Kennedy. He also elevated William Rehnquist to chief justice in 1986 upon the retirement of Warren Burger.\n\nForeign Affairs\n\nIn foreign policy Reagan took an early stand against the Soviet Union. In 1983 he announced his Strategic Defense Initiative, a space-based missile defense system popularly called Star Wars. The Soviets perceived the system as a threat, but early in Reagan’s second term they agreed to resume disarmament talks. Historic summits between Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985, 1986, and 1987 resulted in a treaty reducing intermediate-range nuclear weapons. In 1988 the two leaders met in Moscow for initial discussions on the control of long-range arsenals.\n\nReagan’s strong anticommunist stance also dictated U.S. policy in other parts of the world. In 1983 he sent U.S. forces to the Caribbean island country of Grenada to depose a leftist regime. He justified the invasion as necessary to prevent the country from becoming a dangerous Soviet outpost. Elsewhere, Reagan expanded military and economic assistance to governments battling leftist rebellions; conversely, in countries with leftist governments, he supported opposition forces. This policy was applied most often in Latin America. During the 1980s the United States supported military-dominated governments in El Salvador in a civil war with left-wing guerrilla forces. In Nicaragua the United States backed guerrillas known as contras in their war against the leftist Sandinista government.\n\nThe Middle East also proved troublesome during Reagan’s presidency. In 1983 a terrorist bombing in Lebanon killed 241 U.S. Marines. In January 1986 Reagan imposed economic sanctions on Libya, charging its government with sponsoring acts of international terrorism. In March Libya fired antiaircraft missiles at U.S. warplanes, and the United States responded with attacks on Libyan ships and missile installations. Then, on April 5, two people, including a U.S. serviceman, were killed by a bomb explosion in a discotheque in West Berlin, Germany. Blaming Libya, the United States carried out bombing raids on “terrorist-related targets” in Libya.\n\nIran-Contra Affair\n\nIn 1986 Reagan became embroiled in the worst scandal of his political career. Late in the year the public discovered that his administration had secretly sold weapons to Iran in exchange for that country’s help in securing the release of American hostages held by terrorists in Lebanon. This violated a U.S. policy that prohibited relations with countries—such as Iran—that supported terrorism. Soon it was revealed that profits from the sale had been illegally diverted to the contras in Nicaragua.\n\nSenate hearings on what was called the Iran-contra affair began in 1987. Among those indicted were the National Security Adviser John Poindexter and Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North. By 1990 six former Reagan officials had been convicted in the affair. Reagan accepted responsibility for the arms-for-hostages deal but denied any knowledge of the diversion of the profits to the contras. (In 1990, during eight hours of videotaped testimony about the arms plot, the former president repeatedly swore, “I don’t recall.”)\n\nRetirement\n\nNeither the many political scandals of his administration nor the weight of enormous budget deficits clung to Reagan. He retired on a crest of popularity to his home in California. After years of declining health, Reagan revealed in 1994 that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. The brain disorder made public appearances difficult for him, but his wife occasionally appeared on his behalf. Reagan died on June 5, 2004, in Los Angeles, California."
