        "text": "July 6, 2021 marked the 100th anniversary of Nancy Davis Reagan’s birth. Just a few days ago would have marked her 103rd birthday.\n\nThroughout her life, Nancy Reagan served in many roles. First as actress, wife and mother, then as First Lady of both California and the United States. In recognition of Mrs. Reagan’s tireless efforts on behalf of her husband, the nation, and the Foundation which bears her husband’s name, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute is honoring her with the Nancy Reagan Centennial from July 6, 2021-July 6, 2022. This year-long commemoration will be filled with celebratory events, content rich programming, and special projects that will highlight her many contributions to the nation and her life of extraordinary achievements.\n\n“Some have called Nancy Reagan a diplomat for her time as First Lady of the United States. Others see her as a bridgebuilder,” said Fred Ryan, chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute. “But without question, many people called Nancy Reagan one of the strongest partners ever to serve as First Lady to a President of the United States, with a deep passion for her country and even deeper devotion for her husband.”\n\nTo celebrate the Centennial year – and honor Nancy Reagan for a life of extraordinary achievements – the Reagan Foundation and Institute featured important milestones in her life through a series of programs, including the creation of the Nancy Reagan Youth Fund, a forum in Washington, D.C. dedicated to the role of First Ladies, a special exhibit at the Reagan Library, educational curriculum for schools across the country using primary source materials, an essay/video contest for schoolchildren with scholarship rewards, a Centennial Surrogate Speakers program and the commissioning of a Nancy Reagan statue, amongst other endeavors.\n\nAt the dedication of the Library on November 4, 1991, President Reagan commented:\n\n“I don't know how to begin to describe what she means to me, except to say, I can't imagine life without her.”\n\nAnd only a few years before, he said,\n\n“The Presidency wouldn’t have been the joy it’s been for me without her there beside me. And those second floor living quarters in the white house would have seemed a big and lonely spot without her waiting for me every day at the end of the day.”\n\nPerhaps you didn’t know that she left the Hollywood spotlight behind to marry Ronald Reagan on March 4, 1952 and ultimately found herself on the world stage—partly because her love and support helped her husband attain his great achievements.\n\nWell, let’s hear the story straight from her…\n\n“I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again- my life didn’t really begin until I met Ronnie. And this is how it happened:\n\n“One evening in the fall of 1949, I was in my apartment reading one of the Hollywood papers when I noticed a name; my name; in a list of Communist sympathizers in Hollywood. In those days, I didn’t know much about politics but I knew that my name didn’t belong on the list. In New York, I had also been mistaken for another Nancy Davis and had received her mail and even some of her phone calls. It’s not exactly an uncommon name. When I came to [Mervin le] Roy with my problem, he had a studio arranged for an item to appear in the Wella Parson’s widely read gossip column in the Examiner, pointing out that Nancy Davis, who was listed as a Communist sympathizer, was not the actress who was under contract to Metro.\n\n“Feeling any better?” he asked me the next day.\n\n“Well a little,” I said. “But my parents would die if they heard about this. What else can I do?”\n\n“Maybe I should call Ronald Reagan,” he said. “This might be something the guild should look into.”\n\nNow Ronald Reagan was President of the Screen Actors Guild. I had seen some of his pictures and on screen at least, he seemed nice and good-looking; someone I thought I’d like to meet.\n\n“Mervin,” I said, “I think that would be a very good idea.”\n\n“Come to think of it,” he said, “you two might really hit it off. I’ll have Ron call you.”\n\nWell, I spent that night waiting for the phone to ring. The more I waited, the more I liked the idea of meeting Ronald Reagan. But he didn’t call. The next morning, Mervin took me aside to say that he had spoken to Ronald Reagan who had told him that there were at least three other Nancy Davises in Hollywood.\n\n“If there is ever a problem,” Mervin said, “the Guild will defend you.”\n\nWell now that was reassuring but it wasn’t exactly what I wanted to hear. So I put on a very unhappy face. “I’m really worried,” I said. “I’d feel a lot better if Mr. Reagan explained it to me himself.”\n\nSo late that afternoon, the phone rang.\n\n“Nancy Davis? This is Ronald Reagan from the Screen Actors Guild. Mervin LeRoy asked me to look into your problem and I have some answers for you. If you’re free for dinner tonight, perhaps we can talk about it then.”\n\n“Well,” I stammered, “I think I could manage it.”\n\n“How about 7:30?” he said. “It can’t be a late night because I have an early call in the morning.”\n\nI smiled when he said that. Everyone in Hollywood who went out on blind date, knew enough to mention an early call. If the evening turned out to be a disaster, you had an excuse to end it early.\n\n“Fine,” I said. “I have an early call too.” I didn’t. But a girl has her pride.\n\nTwo hours later, my first thought when I opened the door was: this is wonderful! He looks as good in person as he does on the screen. My visitor was propped up on a cane and he explained that he had hurt himself in a charity baseball game and had just spent eight weeks in the hospital with a broken leg.\n\nWe went to [La Rue’s], one of the best restaurants on Sunset Strip. In those days, the Strip was still a place to go and to be seen. By the time we sat down to dinner, we had finished discussing the ‘Nancy Davis’ problem and my date was more familiar than I with the [morays] of Hollywood- had come up with the ideal solution.\n\n“Have the studio change your name,” he said. “You’d hardly be the first.”\n\nHe had no way of knowing how long I had waited to be called Nancy Davis and how much that name meant to me.\n\n“I can’t do that!” I told him. “Nancy Davis is my name!” I had known Ronald Reagan ten minutes when he suggested that I change my name. More than two years later when we came back to this topic, I would be all too happy to change my name- to his.\n\nAs we were finishing dinner, he said that Sophie Tucker was opening at [Saro’s] that night together with Xavier Cugat and his band and suggested that we drive over there just for the first show.\n\n“Fine,” I said, “just for the first show.”\n\nOf course we stayed for both shows. And by the time Sophie Tucker had finished, we had admitted that neither of us really had the early call. It was almost three in the morning when Ronnie had brought me home.\n\nI don’t know if it was exactly love at first sight, but it was pretty close. We had dinner together the next night; and the night after that; and the one after that. For the first month or so, we must have gone to every restaurant and night club in Los Angeles. Almost as soon as we started dating, the press began to write about it and to speculate about our marriage. We realized early on that neither of us really was the ‘fast-lane’ type. And so instead of going out every night, we started spending most of our time alone in my apartment, watching movies on television and making popcorn.\n\nAt the end of President Reagan’s second term in office, on August 15, 1988 a tribute to Mrs. Reagan was held in New Orleans. Here’s what our 40th President said:\n\n“I've known the guest of honor for many years. Well, yes, that's true. She was once one of the original members of the Reagan inner circle -- -- well, I can't dispute that -- -- who's been involved in some of the most delicate White House matters, such as high-level staff -- maybe I better do this by myself.”\n\n“In fact, I've been thinking for several days about what exactly I wanted to say today and how to put Nancy's role in my life in perspective for you. But what do you say about someone who gives your life meaning? What do you say about someone who's always there with support and understanding, someone who makes sacrifices so that your life will be easier and more successful? Well, what you say is that you love that person and treasure her. I simply can't imagine the last 8 years without Nancy. The Presidency wouldn't have been the joy it's been for me without her there beside me. And that second-floor living quarters in the White House would have seemed a big and lonely spot without her waiting for me every day at the end of the day. You know, she once said that a President has all kinds of advisers and experts who look after his interests when it comes to foreign policy or the economy or whatever, but no one who looks after his needs as a human being. Well, Nancy has done that for me through recuperations and crises. Every President should be so lucky.\n\n“I think it's all too common in marriages that, no matter how much partners love each other, they don't thank each other enough. And I suppose I don't thank Nancy enough for all that she does for me. So, Nancy, in front of all your friends here today, let me say: Thank you for all you do. Thank you for your love. And thank you for just being you.”\n\nTo express his gratitude and affection, Ronald Reagan wrote countless letters to his wife, many illustrated with charming cartoons of his own creation. Nancy left cards and love notes around for her husband to discover when she was away from him. In a letter to Nancy on their thirty-first wedding anniversary Ronald wrote, “I more than love you, I’m not whole without you. You are life itself to me. When you are gone I’m waiting for you to return so I can start living again.” Many years later, when Nancy published some of the love letters she received from her husband, she wrote, “If either of us ever left the room, we both felt lonely. People don’t always believe this, but it’s true. Filling the loneliness, completing each other – that’s what it still meant to us to be husband and wife.”\n\nAnd so, with warm hearts we recall the loving relationship between Ronald and Nancy Reagan and honor their devotion to each other this month.\n\nFor more information on the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute, including information on how to become a member, information on upcoming exhibits at the Reagan Library, and more information on the legacy of President Reagan, please visit www.ReaganFoundation.org.\n\nAnd don’t forget to like and follow the Reagan Foundation on all social media platforms."
