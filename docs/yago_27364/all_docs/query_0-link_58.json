        "text": "Nancy Reagan was the first lady of the United States from 1981 to 1989. Her husband, Ronald Reagan, was the 40th president.\n\nAnne Frances Robbins was born on July 6, 1921, in New York, New York. Her mother, Edith, gave Anne the nickname “Nancy,” which was the name she used throughout her life. Edith married Loyal Davis in 1929. Davis adopted Nancy, and she took his last name. Nancy Davis graduated from Smith College in 1943. She became an actress and was working in Hollywood, California, by 1949.\n\nNancy met Ronald Reagan, a fellow actor, in Hollywood. They were married on March 4, 1952. They had four children: two children together and two children from Ronald’s first marriage.\n\nRonald became governor of California in 1966. As the governor’s wife, Nancy was criticized for her wealthy friends and her expensive clothing. These criticisms followed her to the White House.\n\nAs first lady, Nancy was heavily criticized for her lavish lifestyle. She threw large parties, which often included Hollywood celebrities. However, she also started the antidrug campaign “Just Say No.” Her husband and his staff viewed Nancy as a trusted adviser. It was thought that she influenced the president on many important issues, such as arms control and relations with the Soviet Union."
