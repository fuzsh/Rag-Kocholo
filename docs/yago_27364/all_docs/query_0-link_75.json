        "text": "Fascinating details\n\nNancy Davis Reagan was a well-known actress, starting in stage acting and later relocating to Hollywood for film and television roles.\n\nShe was also known as “a deft international ambassador for brisk, polished, and generally faultless American high style,” according to Vogue.\n\nNancy received criticism for assuming more traditional gender roles as well as her extravagant spending on refurbishing the White House, leading to intervention from the Reagan staff to subdue her elitist image.\n\nFamously known for spearheading the “Just Say No” anti-drug movement, which she continued even after her term as first lady.\n\nContrary to conservative belief, Nancy Reagan was an advocate for embryonic stem cell research."
