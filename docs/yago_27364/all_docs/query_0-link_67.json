        "text": "Nancy Reagan, the first lady who shepherded Ronald Reagan from the stage lights of Hollywood to the political world of Sacramento and the White House and, ultimately, through his battle with Alzheimer's, died Sunday. She was 94.\n\nShe died at her home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles of congestive heart failure, assistant Allison Borio told The Associated Press.\n\nHer funeral will be at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library & Museum in Simi Valley but specifics had not been announced Sunday.\n\nThough demure and small in stature, she had an enormous impact on her husband as Reagan juggled the Iran-Contra controversy, a lingering recession and negotiations with the Soviets. Her fierce protectiveness of Reagan that made her unpopular while he was president eventually endeared her to the nation as she served as the primary caretaker for Reagan as Alzheimer's consumed him.\n\nShe went from being perceived as a well-dressed socialite to a woman who dealt with a pain that millions of Americans endure every year.\n\nAfter his death, she devoted her time to cementing his place in history, helping the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Foundation in Simi Valley evolve from a monument to Reagan to a platform that launches rising Republican stars. She was always cast as a supporting actress in her Hollywood days, a role she carried for life.\n\n\"My job is being Mrs. Ronald Reagan,\" she once told the late 60 Minutes reporter and friend Mike Wallace. \"It's not about my legacy.\"\n\nIn doing so, she not only defined his place in history, but hers.\n\n\"Nancy Reagan helped Ronald Reagan be a more effective president and more effective leader,\" said Lou Cannon, Reagan's biographer and Summerland resident. And, in his mind, her ability to make him a better president made her a great first lady.\n\n\"You are dealing with Abigail Adams, Dolly Madison and Eleanor Roosevelt and I think in the same breath you have to talk about Nancy Reagan.\" (Story continues below.)\n\n'FIRST LADY'\n\nAnne Frances Robbins was born in Queens, New York, on July 6, 1921, the only child of Edith and Kenneth Robbins.\n\nKenneth Robbins and his wife separated about a year after their daughter was born, leaving Edith to raise the young girl who she soon took to calling Nancy.\n\nEdith was a pretty blonde actress with a big personality and big dreams of making it on the stage. But when Nancy was 2, her mother decided that life on the road was no place for a young child and left her with her sister's family just outside Washington, D.C.\n\nNancy would sometimes travel to New York City to see her mother's performances and became enamored with the acting world.\n\nWhile sailing to England, Edith Robbins met Dr. Loyal Davis, a surgery professor at Northwestern University. The two married in 1929 with Nancy as the bridesmaid and the family soon moved to Chicago.\n\nNancy Reagan soon took up acting and her first starring role in a high school play was \"First Lady.\" When she went to Smith College, she \"majored in English and drama - and boys,\" she wrote in her autobiography, \"My Turn.\"\n\nAfter graduation, she landed a part in a touring production staring ZaSu Pitts, a famous comedian.\n\nAfter landing parts on a few TV shows, an agent from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer suggested she come to Hollywood for a screen test. Before long, she got a contract for $250 a week.\n\nThough she rubbed elbows with stars like Judy Garland, Elizabeth Taylor and Lana Turner, Nancy Reagan realized she was not the bombshell leading lady, as was apparent by the supporting roles she got as a young mother or pregnant lady.\n\n\"Nancy Davis is considered the new 'perfect wife' type,\" a reviewer wrote after her movie, \"The Next Voice You Hear.\"\n\nThe big break in her life didn't come from being an actress - it came from being called a Communist.\n\n'THE DOOR OPENED'\n\nIn 1949, two years after Sen. Joseph McCarthy and his House Committee on un-American Activities convened and as actors were being investigated for Communist ties, the Hollywood Reporter published a list of Communist sympathizers - and Nancy Davis' name was on it.\n\nAlthough there were a few Nancy Davises in Hollywood at the time, Nancy Reagan was worried that her name on the list could blackball her from any future roles, so she sought the help of the Screen Actors Guild.\n\nThe president of the guild was Ronald Reagan, a 38-year-old actor who had been leading the group for two years. Though he had been in Hollywood for years, he wasn't getting the leading man roles he wanted and fewer offers were coming his way.\n\nHe had divorced Jane Wyman earlier that year, a separation that left his heart badly bruised. He had two children by Wyman, Maureen and Michael, who was adopted.\n\nWhen Reagan agreed to see Nancy Davis regarding her concern about the list of communists, he phoned her to set up a date.\n\n\"The door opened,\" Ronald Reagan later wrote, \"not on the expected fan magazine version of a starlet, but on a small, slender young lady with dark hair and a wide-spaced pair of hazel eyes that look right at you and made you look back.\"\n\nNancy Davis also liked what she saw.\n\n\"My first thought when he opened the door was, this is wonderful. He looks as good in person as he does on the screen,\" she wrote. \"I don't know if it was love at first sight, but it was close.\"\n\nThe two hit it off instantly over dinner on the Sunset Strip. Though Hollywood gossip magazines wrote all kinds of sensational headlines about the couple, they both dated others during the next year while making movies, including his infamous, \"Bedtime for Bonzo.\"\n\nThe two were seen all around Hollywood, including at the monthly astrology parties that many of the big names in Hollywood attended to have their signs read.\n\nOn March 4, 1952, the two were married in a small ceremony at the Little Brown Church in the San Fernando Valley. The first night of their honeymoon, they stayed at the Mission Inn in Riverside, where Richard Nixon spent his honeymoon and Taft and Roosevelt once stayed. Seven months later, their first child, Patti was born.\n\nBut the first few years of their marriage were a struggle, she wrote.\n\nRonald Reagan was getting fewer acting parts and, although she wanted to stop acting and be a housewife, she took roles to pay bills. They moved to a $42,000 home in Pacific Palisades, then considered a remote place. Ronald Reagan began opening the weekly show, \"General Electric Theater.\"\n\nPart of the contract called for him to give talks around the country, which gave him exposure to the concerns of people and gave him a pulpit to address big government, loss of morals and individual liberties.\n\nSTART OF POLITICS\n\nIn 1957, after two miscarriages, Nancy became pregnant with Ron Reagan Jr.\n\nTheir circle of friends gradually expanded from the Hollywood types to include political power-brokers. Ronald Reagan, who had become a national figure because of his G.E. show, was campaigning for candidates and giving speeches against Communism.\n\nA rousing speech he gave for Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater in 1964 got him noticed so much that others started pushing Reagan to run for office, pushing him toward a run for California governor. He agreed. On the night he announced his candidacy, Nancy wore a red suit, a color that she would forever be associated with. She also established her lifelong legacy of protecting her husband at all costs.\n\nNancy's \"political skills were better in terms of what was best for Ron, than even his own,\" Stu Spencer, Reagan's campaign manager, told a Vanity Fair reporter. \"Her instincts were good. She knew what worked well with him. I've always said he'd never have made it without her.\"\n\nBut for all her acting experience, Nancy Reagan didn't like to give the stump speeches that are required of politicians' wives.\n\n\"When I was acting, I wasn't being myself - I was playing a role that had been crafted for me. But giving a speech is completely different,\" she wrote. Incumbent Pat Brown never thought Reagan had a chance, but Reagan beat him by more than 1 million votes.\n\nUnlike the Hollywood press corps that treated its subjects with kid gloves and flattered them, the Sacramento reporters were vicious in their pursuit of a scoop and dissecting everything the Reagans did.\n\n'QUEEN NANCY'\n\nShe hated living in the Governor's Mansion, an old, drafty house that had been declared a fire hazard that she described as \"a depressing house.\" A few months later, she decided to move out of the house and into a Tudor that supporters paid for.\n\nAnd then there was the issue of how she'd stare up at her husband when he made speeches with a thousand-mile gaze, unblinking with adoration. The press called it \"The Stare.\" A 1968 Joan Didion essay painted her as a shallow dimwit more interested in socializing and fashion than politics and government.\n\nThe first unflattering nickname of many was bestowed upon her: \"Queen Nancy.\"\n\nReagan knew if he came in the house and it smelled of bath salts, Nancy was upstairs, soaking in the tub, thinking of a witty response she should have given to a reporter.\n\nHe ran for and won another term in office, during which time he ran a budget surplus, reformed welfare and increased his popularity.\n\nShe got private donors to pay for a newly constructed, $1.4 million Governor's Mansion. Both were glad to go back to Los Angeles in 1974 as private citizens. Nancy Reagan thought that her life as a first lady was over.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE\n\nThough he had launched an unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 1976, in 1980 he easily defeated Jimmy Carter and took the White House.\n\nDuring the campaign and in the years that followed, Nancy Reagan earned her reputation as a protector of her husband at all costs.\n\nDuring a campaign stop, when he was giving a speech for old and sick veterans, Reagan began to choke up, so she stepped in and finished it for him - and scolded the person who set up the stop there.\n\n\"In some ways, Nancy and I are like one human being: When one of us has a problem, it automatically becomes a problem for the other; an attack on one of us is an attack on both of us,\" Reagan wrote. \"When one suffers, so does the other.\"\n\nAfter four years of Carter wearing sweaters and turning down the thermostats, Nancy quickly set the tone for a regal, sophisticated White House that hearkened back to the Kennedy days. The inauguration was the most expensive ever staged, costing more than $16 million. Elaborate social gatherings were the norm, where Nancy dressed in designer gowns. When it became known that, like socialites, many of her gowns were given to her or she borrowed them, her critics pounced.\n\nAnd then came her \"china policy.\"\n\nDuring her first year, when she learned the White House china was a mismatch of collections because so much had been broken or taken by souvenir collectors over the years, she bought a new 4,732 piece set with a private donation of $209,508. It came at a time when the country was still reeling from a recession, and the day that the government announced ketchup was considered a vegetable in school lunches.\n\nSoon after, Johnny Carson deadpanned that her favorite snack food was caviar and a host of bad nicknames followed: The Iron Butterfly, The Belle of Rodeo Drive, Fancy Nancy, the Cutout Doll.\n\nBut 1981 polls showed Americans equally admired and disliked her. A Newsweek poll said she had a 26 percent approval rating and of those who disapproved of her, most said she put too much emphasis on style and not enough on the problems of common Americans. But a Gallup poll put her as the most admired woman in America - up from the No. 10 spot the year before.\n\n\"Washington can be a tough town, and I didn't know how to handle it,\" she wrote. \"I sometimes had the feeling that if it was raining outside, it was probably my fault.\"\n\nShe addressed the criticism head on in 1982, when she did a satirical song-and-dance number at the Gridiron Dinner for the press called \"Second-hand Rose.\"\n\nShe burnished her image by launching the \"Just Say No,\" campaign, extensively touring the country in an effort to combat the growing drug problem in the United States.\n\nWhen Reagan's first term was nearing an end, she was against him running for a second term. After the 1981 assignation attempt on Reagan, she was worried for her safety and was ready to be done with politics and return to Los Angeles.\n\nTHE SECOND TERM\n\nIf the first term was tough because she was considered out of touch, her second was even tougher because she was considered to be meddling and controlling.\n\n\"Did I ever give Ronnie advice? \" she wrote in her memoir. \"You bet I did. I'm the one who knows him best and I was the only person in the White House who had absolutely no agenda of her own - except helping him.\"\n\nMany of her decisions had to do with the people who Reagan surrounded himself with, using her considerable influence to make sure the people closest to him had his best interests at heart.\n\nThe biggest explosion came during Reagan's biggest controversy, the Iran-Contra scandal. As the crisis unfolded, people wanted to know how much the president knew about the U.S. secretly funneling money to Iran for weapons. \"It's hard to envision Ronnie as being a bad guy,\" she told Cannon, Reagan's biographer. \"And he's not. But there are times when someone has to step in and say or do something. And I've had do that sometimes - often.\"\n\nDon Regan, Reagan's chief of staff who battled with Nancy Reagan, exacted his revenge in a book, part of which disclosed how Nancy was constantly consulting astrologer Joan Quigley.\n\nA self-described chronic worrier, Nancy Reagan admitted that she paid Quigley to help her draw up Reagan's schedule to figure out what days were the safest for him to travel and have meetings according to the astrological charts. At a time when many thought she was a shadow president, the news that she was using an astrologer made many wonder if important decisions were based upon whether or not the planets were aligned.\n\nIn her memoirs, she defended herself, saying that after the assassination attempt on Reagan, she couldn't be too careful, but that nothing other than scheduling was influenced by her beliefs.\n\n\"While I was never certain that Joan's astrological advice was helping protect Ronnie, the fact is that nothing like March 30 ever happened again. Was astrology one of the reasons? I don't really believe it was, but I don't really believe it wasn't. But I do know this: It didn't hurt, and I'm not sorry I did it,\" she wrote.\n\nCannon said Nancy's influence was mainly over personnel matters of who would best serve Reagan and that she had little say over actual policy matters.\n\nIf the attacks from the press weren't bad enough, she had them coming from her own family, too.\n\nThe couple's relationship with their daughter, Patti - who changed her last name to Davis - was under constant strain, exacerbated by a thinly-veiled fictional book Davis wrote that was critical of her parents. Michael also was set to write a disturbing tell-all, but later abandoned it.\n\n\"It's true, we weren't always able to live up to the principles we believed in, but that doesn't mean we don't believe in them,\" Nancy wrote in her memoirs. She couldn't even escape controversy when dealing with her breast cancer diagnosis in 1987.\n\nInstead of undergoing chemotherapy and surgery to remove the lump, she opted for a mastectomy of her left breast. Much to her dismay, news reports and graphics of breasts were plastered on the news, with experts saying that she could have avoided removing her breast by merely removing the tumor.\n\nBreast cancer advocates said she set women's knowledge of how to deal with cancer back 10 years. Nancy defended herself by saying she could not undergo chemotherapy and still function in her role as first lady.\n\nBut in the months and years that followed, more women sought out mammograms, which was partly attributed to Nancy Reagan's diagnosis.\n\nBy the end of eight years in the White House, Nancy Reagan was ready to be out of office and enjoy some time with her husband, away from the constant attention and criticism. Ronald Reagan said it was hard on his wife.\n\n\"I never understood or got used to the constant sniping at her, which at times got so bad that she was in tears when I came upstairs at the end of the day,\" he wrote.\n\nThrough it all, the two were still very much in love. \"I Love You, Ronnie,\" a compilation of telegrams, post cards and love notes, showed how they never stopped telling each other how much they loved each other. He would sign letters, \"Your In Luv Gov,\" \"Your pres,\" and \"Daddy Poo Pants.\"\n\nNancy returned every bit of the affection, but perhaps showed it best not by standing by him when he was in office, but by taking care of him when he was out.\n\nPOST-PRESIDENCY\n\nThe couple moved back to California to their new Bel Air home. He gave speeches around the country, she continued work on her \"Just Say No\" program. In 1989, she published her memoirs, titled \"My Turn,\" that let her answer so much of the criticism she endured in public life.\n\n\"I came to realize that while Ronald Reagan was an extremely popular president, some people didn't like his wife very much,\" she wrote. \"Something about me, or the image people had of me, just seemed to rub them the wrong way.\"\n\nThe two worked on getting his library opened, a $57-million, 153,000-square-foot Spanish stucco style building that sits on a hill overlooking Simi Valley. It broke ground in 1988 and opened in 1991. The Reagans had a private residence at the library and he would visit it about once a month, shaking hands with visitors and touring the facility.\n\nIn 1994, Reagan penned a letter that would not only change his life, but Nancy's legacy.\n\nThe open letter to America said that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's, which at the time was not a widely understood disease. While he said he would \"begin the journey that will take me into the sunset of my life,\" he said, \"I wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience.\"\n\nBut she didn't want to be shielded from it, instead taking the role of chief caretaker. She immersed herself in the job, making few public appearances and only occasionally taking visitors or going to lunch with friends at a nearby restaurant.\n\n\"It's very lonely,\" she told Cannon in 2000. \"Not being able to share memories is an awful thing â€¦ there really isn't much you can do, and that's the frustrating part of it.\"\n\nIn 2001, she took the first of many political stances to help her husband and others with Alzheimer's by sending President George W. Bush a letter asking him to change his stance on stem-cell research.\n\nIn 2002, she received the Medal of Honor for her Just Say No program as well as the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nBy 2004, after Reagan had died, she made a more emphatic plea during a speech at the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation.\n\n\"Ronnie's long journey has finally taken him to a distant place where I can no longer reach him,\" she said. \"Because of this, I'm determined to do whatever I can to save other families from this pain.\"\n\nHer undying support of her husband endeared her to many, including her most ardent critics.\n\n\"Nancy wasn't the role model many of us wanted or needed in the 1980s,\" wrote former White House correspondent Dannye Romine Powell. \"But she more than made up from that in the 1990s and I think she understood something that many of us are yet to learn: that love and devotion are not just sappy, sentimental greeting card words. Sometimes, those words empty the bedpan. Sometimes they hang in there until death do us part.\"\n\nOn Reagan's last day, June 5, 2004, his family was by his side. He opened his eyes and looked one more time at Nancy before dying.\n\nThe state funeral in Washington, and then his burial in Simi Valley, was planned down to the minute in no small part because of Nancy Reagan. She oversaw every detail, from his horse riding boots being placed backward in the stirrups to the timing of the service to end as the sun sank to the sea. All week long, as thousands of well-wishers streamed by his flag-draped casket, she maintained her composure - until the last minute, as it was time to say goodbye.\n\nShe collapsed on his mahogany coffin, gently rubbing the flag while saying, \"I love you,\" through tears.\n\nHER LEGACY WAS HIS\n\nWith her husband gone, Nancy Reagan threw herself into the library and preserving his legacy. She made appearances the day his postage stamp was unveiled and she was there when President George W. Bush visited the library on multiple occasions.\n\nAfter his death, Reagan's legacy within the Republican Party and in the nation as a whole grew. Being seen with his widow on your arm was almost like an endorsement from Reagan himself. Over the years, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rudolph Giuliani and Mitt Romney all spoke at the library and walked the former first lady down the aisle.\n\nShe presided over the two presidential debates at the library during the 2008 election cycle and said that she wanted those to lay the foundation for a tradition of holding the first and last Republican presidential debates at the library.\n\nShe oversaw the details of the renovation for his 100th birthday celebration in 2011 and was there on that day to lay a wreath on his gravestone.\n\nAt each ceremony she attended over the years, her already petite frame shrunk along with her stride. She rarely made any public comments. Still, staffers at the library said she remained sharp and engaged and very much herself.\n\nOne of her last public appearances at the library was last June 6, when she laid flowers on her husband's grave on the anniversary of his death.\n\nNancy Reagan will be buried beside her husband at the Reagan Library on a hill that points toward the sun setting over the sea. Above the two, the words Ronald Reagan once spoke are carved into marble: \"I know in my heart that man is good. That what is right will always triumph, and there is purpose and worth to each and every life.\"\n\nFor Nancy Reagan, that purpose was the man buried beside her.\n\nCOVERAGE FROM MARCH 6, 2016"
