        "meta_description": "Title supplied by cataloger.Nancy Davis Reagan (born Anne Frances Robbins in 1921) was married to Ronald Reagan from 1952 until his death in 2004. She was the First Lady of California from 1967 to 1975, and First Lady of the United States from 1981 to 1989. After Ronald Reagan's presidency ended, the couple retired to their home in Bel Air. In 1994 Ronald was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and Nancy devoted most of her time caring for her ailing husband until his death on June 5, 2004. She continues to reside at their Bel Air home, and has remained active within the Reagan Library and in politics, particularly in support of stem-cell research.Pictured are Nancy Reagan and her kids, Ronald (Ron) Prescott Reagan and Patricia Ann Reagan (better known by her professional name, Patti Davis). It appears the family is enjoying an evening at the Hollywood Bowl.",
