        "text": "Even before the inauguration, Nancy Reagan had been forging friendships within the Washington establishment and alliances within her husband’s administration, instinctively but deliberately setting the stage for what would be the culmination of her ceaseless efforts to ensure Ronald Reagan’s place in history as a “man of peace”: the four summits during his second term with Soviet general-secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, which in effect ended the Cold War on terms highly favorable to the West. Through her friendships with Washington Post chairman Katharine Graham, former Democratic National Committee chairman Robert Strauss, and Richard Helms, director of the C.I.A. under Presidents Johnson and Nixon, among others, Nancy Reagan gradually changed the widely held perception of her husband as a right-wing warmonger while exposing him to more moderate and internationalist points of view. In her unofficial role as “personnel director,” in Reagan campaign strategist Stuart Spencer’s phrase, she saw to it that the “pragmatists,” such as Baker, Deaver, and George Shultz, Reagan’s second secretary of state, outweighed the “ideologues”—Meese, Weinberger, Casey, and William Clark, Reagan’s second national security adviser—within the president’s inner council.\n\nNancy Reagan acted in league with her old allies Deaver and Spencer to make sure her husband chose Baker, an elegant, well-connected Houston lawyer, as chief of staff, rather than Meese, “a jump-off-the-cliff-with-the-flag-flying conservative,” as she described him in her 1989 memoir, My Turn. In 1982 she was greatly relieved when Haig, whom she considered “power-hungry,” was replaced by the more subtle Shultz, and in 1983 she went to bat with her husband for Shultz in a decisive power struggle with Clark. Clark lost, and was exiled to the Department of the Interior.\n\n‘Mrs. Reagan never tried to make policy,” says Richard Burt, who was an assistant secretary of state under Shultz, and whose wife, Gahl Hodges Burt, was White House social secretary from 1983 to 1984. “In fact, by making it very clear that she didn’t want to make policy—wasn’t interested, was involved in other things—nobody saw her as a threat. But she had a tremendous influence. First of all, she had a very strong influence with people close to Reagan—Baker and Deaver. After all, she got Baker hired. She detested Ed Meese and thought he was an idiot and too ideological and just not very capable. She was right in that sense. He sort of never knew what he was doing. As far as Nancy Reagan was concerned, Jim Baker was the state-of-the-art man. He dressed well. He was courtly. And Baker was a political animal. He knew that her support was absolutely essential. Deaver, of course, had been around long enough to know that Nancy had to be kept happy. Deaver and Baker derived a great deal of their power—and their stock went up and Meese’s went down—because of Nancy Reagan.\n\n“She read the polls. She read the newspapers. She watched television. But more importantly, she had her network. She talked to people on the phone all day long and she knew what people were saying. And so if Ronnie was screwing up in one area or another, she’d get Mike Deaver on the phone. And if it was too substantive—if it wasn’t just a P.R. issue—then Mike would say, ‘Talk to Baker.’ For anybody outside to break into that inner circle, Mrs. Reagan had to approve. . . . I’d go so far as to say that Nancy Reagan was the most powerful First Lady of the last 35 or 40 years. And she went about it in the right way, the appropriate way—entirely behind the scenes.”\n\nMuffie Brandon agrees. “She was much more influential than she ever let on. And she didn’t want to be perceived as being influential. I once asked her, ‘Don’t you ever think about your place in history?’ She looked at me and she said, ‘Oh, no. It’s Ronnie. And Ronnie’s place in history.’”\n\n“They were a very effective team,” says Ed Rollins, who started working as a legislative aide in Sacramento in 1967, and who was White House political-affairs director from 1981 to 1983. “In many ways she allowed him to be such a nice guy. Because she made some of the really tough—personally tough—decisions. She took the heat for it, and he would sit there and still be this nice guy. I think they had a unique marriage. Ronald Reagan is a loner. I don’t mean that in a derogatory way. He’s a man who’s comfortable being alone. But the one person who has always been in his world is her. And that was enough. The truth is he didn’t need anybody but her.”\n\nRonald Reagan had asked James Baker to be his White House chief of staff the morning after the election. But the decision was kept secret for weeks, mainly to deal with Ed Meese’s hurt feelings about being passed over for the top job, especially in favor of Baker. Baker, after all, had managed the campaign of George Bush, Reagan’s leading rival for the Republican nomination. He joined the Reagan campaign only after Bush was selected as Reagan’s running mate. Meese had been Reagan’s chief of staff in Sacramento and for most of the 1980 campaign, and assumed that he’d have the same position in the White House. Finally, a new role was created for him: counselor to the president.\n\nBecause Baker had such limited experience with the Reagans, it was thought that he needed a Californian as deputy chief of staff: Michael Deaver. Thus was born the unusual arrangement known as “the Troika.” In theory, the three top aides were near equals, with Meese in charge of policy, Baker strategy, and Deaver scheduling, press, and “the Mommy watch”—as some staffers referred to taking care of the First Lady. But with Deaver constantly tilting to Baker, it didn’t stay that way. As Ed Rollins observed to Reagan biographer Lou Cannon, “Every single day Ed Meese was in that White House he lost power or gave up power. Every single day Jim Baker was in that White House he accumulated power.”\n\nReagan tapped Meese as director of the transition—Meese had already set up a talent-recruiting effort for the new administration in secret during the campaign, run by E. Pendleton “Pen” James, a corporate headhunter from Los Angeles. But Reagan also gave his blessing to the Transition Advisory Committee, which was chaired by William French Smith and dominated by the old Kitchen Cabinet tycoons, who were determined to play the same role they had in Sacramento—that is, to choose the real Cabinet. Four days before the election, an article headlined REAGAN’S CLOSEST BUSINESS FRIENDS SEEM TO PERSONIFY HIS VALUES appeared on the first page of the New York Times business section, with profiles of Holmes Tuttle, Justin Dart, Ted Cummings, Earle Jorgensen, Jack Wrather, and French Smith, who was described as “a possible Attorney General.” Tuttle, the Times reported, “expects to help screen appointees for Mr. Reagan, as he did in California.” Dart, still feisty at 73, despite a hip replacement and heart troubles, announced that he would head a presidential advisory group on productivity, “the nation’s No. 1 problem.”\n\nIn addition to these six, five other Kitchen Cabinet stalwarts—Henry Salvatori, Jack Hume, Bill Wilson, Alfred Bloomingdale, and Charles Wick—were on the 19-member Transition Advisory Committee, along with a handful of Republican moguls from other parts of the country, including Colorado beer king Joseph Coors, New York investment banker William Simon, and New Jersey construction-company owner Raymond Donovan, who would become secretary of labor.\n\nThe Transition Advisory Committee held four meetings in Los Angeles in November, in the boardroom of French Smith’s law firm, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. Meese and Pen James took part in all four, and Reagan attended the last two. Reagan also held smaller meetings at his house in Pacific Palisades, with French Smith, Meese, Deaver, and Senator Paul Laxalt, a favorite of both Reagans’.\n\nReagan had asked the committee for three choices for each Cabinet position, and for the most part their first choice was also his. The two major exceptions were General Alexander Haig for secretary of state and Donald Regan for secretary of the Treasury. The committee’s first choice for State was George Shultz, who was also pushed by Deaver. But Reagan was impressed by Haig, who had two key backers: his former boss, Richard Nixon, and Justin Dart. For Treasury, the committee’s nearly unanimous first choice was William Simon, who had held the post in the Nixon and Ford administrations. But according to Roy Cohn’s memoirs, Nancy Reagan nixed him, sensing he wanted too much power. The committee’s second choice, Citicorp chairman Walter Wriston, was unwilling to make the financial disclosures required for confirmation, so Reagan went with their third choice, Donald Regan, the chairman of Merrill Lynch, whom he hardly knew.\n\nAnd then there was the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which, along with the Departments of Education and Energy, Reagan had suggested closing down during the campaign. As Betsy Bloomingdale recalls, “They asked Alfred to find a black for the Cabinet, and he came up with a lawyer he’d worked with in New York, Sam Pierce. A very nice man, but soft, as it turned out.” Samuel R. Pierce Jr. had been head of the legal division of Nixon’s Treasury Department. But under his management, corruption at HUD became the major domestic scandal of Reagan’s second term.\n\nWilliam French Smith was spending Thanksgiving weekend in Palm Springs when Reagan called to ask him to be attorney general. One night French Smith and his wife, Jean, accompanied the Annenbergs to Frank Sinatra’s 65th-birthday party at the singer’s ranch, and French Smith soon found himself under attack by New York Times columnist William Safire, who was outraged that “the future head of our Justice Department joined 200 other guests to honor Frank Sinatra, whose lifelong gangland friendships have become part of his own legend.” His appointment also ran into fierce criticism from feminists when he refused to resign from San Francisco’s exclusive, all-male Bohemian Club, famous for its power camp-outs on the Russian River. Leaders of four major women’s groups testified against him before the Senate Judiciary Committee. In his memoirs, French Smith says that he finally dampened that controversy with a Reaganesque quip: “The simple fact is that it is harder to get into the Bohemian Club than it is to become attorney general.”\n\nAfter Reagan announced most of his Cabinet appointments at a December 11 press conference, French Smith gave up the chairmanship of the Transition Advisory Committee, and Bill Wilson took his place. Two days after Christmas, Wilson summoned Meese and James to a meeting in Washington with the Kitchen Cabinet. Reagan’s longtime personal secretary, Helene von Damm, whom Meese had assigned to assist James in the transition, describes the showdown in her memoirs:\n\n[The Kitchen Cabinet’s] complaints were simple, and at least partially true. We did not take their recommendations as commands. We had not given them the feedback they wanted. Now we were not including them in the selection of the sub-Cabinet.\n\nHenry Salvatori wistfully recalled the days when Ronald Reagan was governor and they were accorded the status they deserved. “Some of us literally moved to Sacramento,” he said.\n\nWhen Wilson announced that he was moving to Washington to “help with the staffing,” James quit and flew back to California. Although he was persuaded to return and was named director of the White House personnel office, the infighting continued. The day after the inauguration, Wilson took over an office in the Executive Office Building (E.O.B.) and had lunch with Senator Jesse Helms, who then fired off a letter to Reagan, von Damm writes, “demanding that the kitchen cabinet be restored to the rank it had had when he was Governor and that it be given veto power over appointments approved by [James and Meese].” Von Damm believes that Reagan “never responded to the letter, and he never talked to the kitchen cabinet about the problem.”\n\nThe problem was compounded by the fact that the Kitchen Cabinet and their wives were busily raising the funds to have Ted Graber, the Los Angeles interior designer favored by the group, redecorate the White House. At that time, a president was given a $50,000 decorating allowance. The Carters hadn’t even spent the whole amount. According to Nancy Reagan’s first chief of staff, Peter McCoy, “I don’t think anything had been done upstairs since the Nixons lived there. And in the interim, you had the Fords and their entire family and their retinue of animals. You had the Carters, their family, and their animals. The place was a shambles.”\n\nBy March 1981, almost $750,000 had been raised, including $70,000 from the Annenbergs, $50,000 from Earle and Marion Jorgensen, $20,000 from the Bloomingdales, and $10,000 each from the Tuttles, the Wrathers, and Justin and Jane Dart. Holmes Tuttle also raised $270,000 from 23 oil-industry figures, who were no doubt grateful that one of Ronald Reagan’s first acts as president had been to remove price controls on oil and gas. In addition, Armand and Harriet Deutsch, the Annenbergs, the Jorgensens, and the Wilsons paid for a surprise black-tie dinner dance for 100 friends in the White House on February 6, 1981, to toast the president’s 70th birthday.\n\nSeveral of the California couples—the Bloomingdales, the Darts, the Wilsons, the Annenbergs, and Charles and Mary Jane Wick—took apartments or permanent suites at the Watergate complex. Lee Annenberg was named chief of protocol after Walter reportedly turned down the ambassadorship to Japan. Charles Wick was the new head of the United States Information Agency (U.S.I.A.). And it was becoming increasingly apparent that many of the Kitchen Cabinet were expecting to have an ongoing say in the making of the new administration’s policies.\n\nA month before the inauguration, Arnaud de Borchgrave, the veteran Newsweek foreign correspondent, had taken the chief of French Intelligence, Alexandre de Marenches, to dinner at the Bloomingdales’ house in Holmby Hills with president-elect Reagan. “We were told Nancy had a cold,” de Borchgrave recalls. “We were also told that Reagan could only spare an hour. He stayed five hours. That’s when the whole strategy of supporting anti-Marxist guerrilla forces in the Third World—Afghanistan, Angola—was worked out. The next morning, I was called by [Bloomingdale], who said Reagan had agreed with Marenches’s suggestion that a small group outside of the administration should run this thing. Alfred said, ‘The president has asked me to be the liaison with Marenches.’ Marenches said, ‘Forget it.’ Then, in early 1981, Admiral Edward Burkhalter, a top intelligence guy, was introduced to Bill Wilson at a party in the Madison Hotel in Washington. Wilson said he was now the guy Reagan wanted to run it, not Al Bloomingdale. But Marenches didn’t want to deal with people he didn’t know.”\n\nThere had been talk of Bloomingdale’s being named ambassador to France, but press reports of a 1975 incident, in which Betsy Bloomingdale was fined $5,000 by U.S. Customs for not declaring two Dior dresses from Paris, probably stopped the talk. Instead, Reagan named him to the Washington-based Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, along with Clare Boothe Luce. There was also talk of sending Justin Dart to the Court of St. James’s. “I could have probably had pretty much whatever I wanted,” Dart later said, explaining that he preferred advising the president privately to “calling up the secretary of state every day to ask when I could go to the toilet.”\n\nMichael Deaver reveals how the Kitchen Cabinet problem was resolved. “Jimmy Baker was very nervous about this. He kept saying to me, ‘Mike, these guys can’t have offices over in the E.O.B. There are certain rules and regulations.’ I said, ‘Well, tell them that.’ So we had a meeting in February with Jus Dart, Bill Wilson, Holmes Tuttle, and Al Bloomingdale. Baker got them together with Fred Fielding, who was counsel to the president. And he said, ‘Fred, these are friends of the president’s, and they’ve been very supportive of him for years. I want you to tell them, if they’re going to get involved back here, what regulations are involved.’ ‘Well,’ Fred said, ‘first of all, you have to fill out these forms,’ and he handed them all the forms. Holmes said, ‘You mean I gotta put all my assets down?’ And Jus Dart, who was the smartest of all of them, stood up after about 10 minutes of this and said, ‘Fellas, I don’t know about you, but they don’t want us here. I’m going home.’ And they all left. That was the end of it.”\n\nNot quite, according to Bill Wilson, who reportedly turned down the ambassadorship to Mexico and was then made envoy to the Vatican, a part-time post. “Whenever there was something that needed discussing, we’d have a meeting—Justin Dart, Jack Wrather, Holmes Tuttle, Earle Jorgensen, and myself—usually at Justin’s office,” Wilson tells me. “And among us we’d decide how we would advise the president on it. And either Justin or Holmes would go back to Washington and talk to Ronnie about it.”\n\nDid the president take their advice?\n\n“Oh, I think he did, yes. But he might have done what he was already planning to do. You have to remember, there were a lot of problems that Reagan had to handle. Lebanon. Poland. The Iran-contra thing . . . “\n\nMeanwhile, the Reagans had started wooing “permanent Washington”—as the city’s predominantly Democratic power structure of bureaucrats, lobbyists, journalists, and hostesses is known—just days after the election with a dinner for 50 at the old-line F Street Club on November 18, 1980, organized by Michael Deaver and Nancy Reynolds, Mrs. Reagan’s press secretary in Sacramento. Everyone from Mayor Marion Barry to power lawyer Edward Bennett Williams was there. “Ronnie made a big hit,” Nancy Reagan recalls, “with his line ‘Only one letter separates president from resident, and I intend to be both.’”\n\nOne month later, on December 11, the Reagans were guests of honor at a dinner at Katharine Graham’s R Street mansion. “I couldn’t go to their dinner at the F Street Club, because I was going to be out of town,” says Graham. “I called up Nancy Reynolds and said I was so disappointed I couldn’t come, and she said, ‘Why don’t you invite them to dinner?’ And I said, ‘I couldn’t do that. I didn’t vote for them, and the paper didn’t endorse them.’ That would be like trying to have it both ways. But Nancy Reynolds said, ‘Just invite them and see.’ And so I gave a dinner for the Reagans before they were in the White House.”\n\nGraham’s guest list was a Washington Hall of Fame: Robert McNamara, Joseph Alsop, Henry and Nancy Kissinger, Ben Bradlee and Sally Quinn, Alan Greenspan, Vernon Jordan, Lloyd Cutler, columnists George Will and Clayton Fritchey with his wife, Polly, the British and French ambassadors, four U.S. senators, and a Supreme Court justice.\n\n“For Reagan,” Graham writes in her memoir, “there were repercussions from coming to dinner at my house. The political right was appalled.” The Wall Street Journal noted that a photograph of Reagan embracing Graham at her dinner could be compared to “the famous one of Jimmy Carter bussing Leonid Brezhnev at the Vienna summit.”\n\nMichael Deaver, looking back, sees both of these early social events as key to the Reagans’ political success. “It was such a contrast to the Carters, because the Carters never cottoned to the Washington establishment. And Washington was open for it. They were delighted. And, yes, it bothered the true believers. It bothered some of the Californians. But I think it was ultimately a very smart thing. It was the same kind of thing as picking Jimmy Baker, even though the longtime Reagan people were very unhappy about that. Jimmy Baker made it possible, in my opinion, for Reagan to have two terms. He had the street smarts about this town that none of us had.”\n\nJennifer Phillips, one of the liberal-Democratic Georgetown hostesses cultivated by Deaver, calls him the “architect” of the Reagans’ “social strategy.” Sitting in her P Street town house, with its understated Arts and Crafts furniture, she elaborates: “He understood this curiosity and this excitement the Reagans had about the Eastern establishment very well. I think he was the one who doped it out in his mind that things would be much easier for them if they did give themselves a chance to spread some of that charm which came so naturally to them. He sussed everybody out before they met the Reagans. It was brilliant.”\n\nDeaver’s wife, Carolyn, joined Polly Fritchey and Oatsie Charles on the board of the Phillips Collection, the private museum founded by the family of Jennifer’s husband, Laughlin Phillips, and Baker’s wife, Susan, agreed to take on the chairmanship of its annual corporate fund-raising dinner. In the summer of 1982, the Deavers were houseguests of Jennifer and Laughlin Phillips on Martha’s Vineyard, where they sat enthralled by the lunchtime badinage of Lillian Hellman and Joseph Alsop. Deaver even went as far as to have Warren Beatty screen his 1981 film, Reds, an epic paean to the American Communist John Reed, at the White House. During intermission, Continental Airlines founder Robert Six, who was married to Audrey Meadows, of The Honeymooners fame, stood up and said, “This is sheer, unadulterated Communist crap!” The animosity cut both ways. Six couples walked out when the Deavers arrived for dinner at William and Rose Styron’s house on the Vineyard, and a party Pamela and Averell Harriman, Washington’s leading Democratic fund-raising couple, gave to welcome the Reagans was marred when a journalist quoted superlawyer Clark Clifford dismissing the new president as “an amiable dunce.”\n\nIn his memoir, Deaver makes clear who was behind his forays into enemy territory: “Others in and around the White House sometimes resented my bipartisan social contacts, but Nancy always wanted to know what the people were like, and what was said. She was the little girl with her nose pressed up against the candy-store window.”\n\nNeither Deaver nor Nancy Reagan, however, was merely social climbing. And in the long term their social strategy was successful, partially because the so-called enemy was no longer quite what it had been. When I interview Katharine Graham, she maintains that the “Georgetown Set” was a figment of Lyndon Johnson’s and Richard Nixon’s “paranoid” fantasies, and adds, “I’m trying to think who would be a liberal. Joe Alsop certainly was not. His brother Stewart was not at all liberal. I was liberal when I was young, but rather centrist in my grown-up period.” Jennifer Phillips—who had been a civil-rights activist in the 1960s, and whose first marriage was to Conrad Cafritz, a son of Gwen Cafritz, Washington’s reigning Democratic hostess during the Johnson years—found the Reagans, Bakers, and Deavers to be a revelation. “I just don’t understand it, but Republicans are more fun—at least a kind of upper-class Republican. They’re not guilt-ridden and they’re not self-righteous. That unrelenting earnestness of Democrats, particularly of Democrats who have made it, just really gets to be tedious after a while. No issue, no conversation, is too ephemeral not to try to draw the eternal verities from it. You know, if you say it’s nice outside, they talk about global warming.”\n\nDeaver was assisted in his bipartisan social approach by Muffie Brandon, the wife of London Sunday Times correspondent Henry Brandon and herself a Democrat. Shortly after the Reagans moved into the White House, Brandon asked some of Georgetown’s leading grande dames, including Oatsie Charles, Evangeline Bruce, Polly Fritchey, and Lorraine Cooper, the widow of Kentucky senator John Sherman Cooper, to invite the new First Lady to their houses for lunch. These lunches for six or eight women soon became the talk of the town. Most of “the Bright Old Things,” as Washingtonian magazine labeled Nancy Reagan’s lunchtime hostesses, were Democrats. Insiders wondered how they would get along with “The Woman Who Would Be Queen”—as a profile of Nancy Reagan by Wanda McDaniel, published in the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner two weeks before the election, was titled. Sally Quinn in The Washington Post and Julie Baumgold in New York magazine had also weighed in with unflattering pre-election profiles. “It was thought that Mrs. Reagan would be difficult,” says social historian Susan Mary Alsop, the former wife of Joseph Alsop, who gave a lunch. “But she no sooner got here before people began to like her.”\n\n‘Vangie Bruce was crazy about Nancy,” says Buffy Cafritz, the socialite wife of William Cafritz, a nephew of Gwen Cafritz’s. Nancy Reagan’s closest bond was probably with the droll but down-to-earth Oatsie Charles, an old pal of New York socialite Jerry Zipkin’s. “Oatsie always calls me ‘Beauty,’” Nancy Reagan says. Charles recalls that, at Zipkin’s insistence, she telephoned the First Lady, whom she had never met, shortly after the Reagans moved into the White House. “So she came to lunch. It was the damnedest thing. I was standing at the door. Ted Graber was with her, and all the Secret Service, and we just automatically embraced. It was instantaneous liking.” Why does she call Nancy Reagan “Beauty”? “I said to her one day, ‘You know, it’s not just external beauty. It’s internal beauty as well.’ Which I do find she has—when she’s not being the dragon lady.”\n\n“And then, of course, there were the lunches that Kay Graham and I had in secret,” Nancy Reagan says. “Just the two of us. Because we were sure that nobody would ever understand our friendship. But then, after a while, we decided we’d enlarge it—we’d include [Newsweek columnist] Meg Greenfield. The lunches would go on for about three hours. They’d usually be at Kay’s, or at Meg’s. I think we had one at the White House. And then Kay said, ‘The hell with it! Let people know that we’re friends.’”\n\nWhen I ask Graham what they talked about at these lunches, she beats around the bush: “You know, you talk about what’s going on . . . funny things or light things or gossip. You talk about a range of things—what they were sensitive about, or what was the press doing to them, or, you know, what the Post maybe was saying.”\n\nDid Mrs. Reagan feel that Graham could influence The Washington Post?\n\n“No. She was pretty realistic about the role of somebody like me.”\n\nOn March 30, 1981, 70 days into the presidency, while Ronald Reagan was giving a speech to 3,500 members of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. union at the Washington Hilton, Nancy Reagan was at another Georgetown lunch, at the Q Street house of Michael Ainslie, president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Mrs. Reagan’s party included Barbara Bush, Peter McCoy, and Muffie Brandon. The group had already attended a morning reception at the Phillips Collection, and Mrs. Reagan decided to leave the lunch early. “We had just pulled into the White House driveway,” McCoy recalls, “and I’d gone up to my office, and she’d gone upstairs to the third floor, when the Secret Service guys told me there was some kind of incident. So I went and talked to her, and she’d already been told by another one of the guys, and we just went down to the car and took off for the hospital. It was pretty scary.”\n\nMrs. Reagan had been meeting in the solarium with Ted Graber and Rex Scouten “when the agent came in and said there had been a shooting,” Scouten says. “She leaped up and put her coat on and said, ‘I’ll see you later, I hope.’ Obviously she was upset and moving fast, but she was totally in control of what she was doing.”\n\nOne of the six Devastator bullets fired outside the Hilton by John W. Hinckley Jr.—who would later say he wanted to assassinate the president in order to impress actress Jodie Foster—had ricocheted off the presidential limousine and pierced Reagan under his left arm, although that wasn’t immediately apparent. Hinckley had also hit White House press secretary James Brady, who is still in a wheelchair today, Washington policeman Thomas K. Delahanty, and Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy. Another Secret Service agent, Jerry Parr, pushed the president into the limousine as the driver took off for the White House. It was only when Reagan began coughing up blood that Parr ordered the driver to head to George Washington University hospital.\n\nThe bullet had come within three inches of his heart. “If five minutes had been lost, he would have died,” Dr. David Gens, one of the surgeons who helped treat Reagan, later said. “Nobody realized how close he’d come to dying,” says White House aide Robert Higdon. “Nancy knew it. But none of us knew it. It wasn’t until she wrote her book that it came out.”\n\nReagan returned to the White House 12 days later, wearing a red cardigan sweater over a bulletproof vest. For three weeks his schedule was limited to two morning meetings, one with the Troika and one with the National Security Council (N.S.C.), whom he would receive in his pajamas and a bathrobe in the family quarters. The only outside visitor he had during this period was Terence Cardinal Cooke, who flew from New York and spent an hour with him on Good Friday. According to Deaver, the president told the cardinal, “I have decided that whatever time I have left is left for Him.”\n\n“The assassination attempt gave him instant mythic status,” Reagan biographer Lou Cannon has said. “After that, nobody could really stand in his way.” On April 28, 1981, Reagan was greeted by thunderous applause when he appeared before a joint session of Congress to sell his Economic Recovery Program, which he had first proposed in February to much derision and doubt. It called for cutting $41 billion from former president Carter’s projected budget, mainly by reducing or eliminating 83 federal programs—while increasing defense spending by $26 billion—and cutting income taxes by 30 percent over three years. The plan was based on supply-side economics, the theory that tax cuts stimulate the economy and lead to increased revenues in the long term. Democratic leaders mocked it as “Reaganomics,” and Jerry Wurf, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said it would “do two things—reward the rich and screw the poor.”\n\nCongress, nevertheless, passed Reagan’s budget bill in June and tax bill in July. Forty Democrats defied House Speaker Tip O’Neill to vote with the Republicans. A jubilant Reagan called this “the greatest political win in half a century.” As he left Washington for the first of his annual one-month vacations at the Reagans’ Rancho del Cielo, near Santa Barbara, his public-approval rating stood at 59 percent.\n\nIf Reagan seemed invincible in the aftermath of the shooting, his wife seemed to become weaker and more out of touch. Her weight slipped from 112 pounds to less than 100. At the suggestion of her friend Merv Griffin, she began to consult regularly with an astrologer he knew, Joan Quigley, who had told him that she could have foreseen the events of March 30 in the president’s chart. “That shooting business really had Nancy on the ropes for a long time thereafter,” says Richard Helms.\n\nIn the eyes of many journalists, she could do no right. “I think the press, to a great extent, saw that they couldn’t really beat up on the president,” says Peter McCoy. “So they had to find somebody else to criticize. And it happened to be Nancy.”\n\nIn May 1981 she gave a dinner for Prince Charles in the private dining room on the second floor of the White House. Things started off badly when Chief of Protocol Lee Annenberg curtsied to the Prince upon his arrival in Washington. “Oh, the flack I got,” Annenberg recalls. “I didn’t really think about it twice, because when Walter and I were in London, that’s what was done and expected: every ambassador’s wife curtsies to the royal family. But here, as you know, all hell broke loose. The president was so sweet that night. He came right up to me and said, ‘Lee, you did exactly the right thing.’” The oh-so-social guest list also turned the press off: Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn, Paul and Bunny Mellon, Bill and Pat Buckley, songwriter Sammy Cahn, cocktail pianist Bobby Short, designer James Galanos, decorator Ted Graber. Nancy Reagan’s best friend from New York, Jerome Zipkin, escorted Diana Vreeland, the septuagenarian former editor of Vogue, who was photographed making a deep curtsy before Prince Charles as the First Lady stood by smiling. “It was as if Nancy Reagan were saying to the country: I am going to do what I want to do,” Marie Brenner, now *Vanity Fair’*s writer-at-large, noted in New York magazine.\n\nIn July, Mrs. Reagan flew to London with the Annenbergs and the Bloomingdales for the royal wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer. Wearing a succession of Adolfo suits and Galanos gowns with jewelry borrowed from Bulgari and Harry Winston, she attended 15 social events in five days, including Queen Elizabeth’s ball at Buckingham Palace, lunch at Chequers with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a visit with the Queen Mother, and a party in her honor given by the American ambassador, John Louis, for 140 guests, including Princess Grace of Monaco, Douglas Fairbanks, and Woolworth heiress Barbara Hutton. The British press ridiculed her six-car motorcade of Secret Service men and her failure to curtsy to the Queen.\n\nThe topper came on September 3, when the White House announced the purchase of a 4,732-piece set of ivory china edged in red for $209,000. Although the Lenox China Company was paid by the Knapp Foundation of Maryland, the donor was not named in the original announcement. “For the press, the china was a symbol of my supposed extravagance,” Nancy Reagan writes in My Turn. “The timing was unfortunate: The new White House china was announced on the same day that the Department of Agriculture mistakenly declared ketchup to be acceptable as a vegetable for school lunches. As you can imagine, the columnists and cartoonists had a field day with that one.”\n\nBy the end of 1981, Nancy Reagan had the highest disapproval rating of any First Lady in modern times. And the president’s Economic Recovery Plan seemed to be backfiring. From mid-1981 to late 1982, the country went through the worst recession since the Great Depression. Reagan’s plan had projected that the economy would grow by 5.2 percent during 1982; instead it shrank by 2.1 percent. Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker kept interest rates at record-high levels in order to force inflation down from 13.3 percent to under 5 percent by the end of the year, but at the same time unemployment rose to 10.8 percent. As the newly homeless moved into the streets and parks of major cities, polls showed that 52 percent of Americans felt Reagan favored the rich.\n\nIn her second year as First Lady, Nancy Reagan chose her cause—combating drug use by the nation’s youth—and a slogan to go with it: Just say no. Buffy Cafritz gave a ladies’ lunch for Mrs. Reagan the day after she returned to Washington from her first tour of drug-rehabilitation centers, in February 1982. The 12 guests included Mary Jane Wick; Oatsie Charles; Deeda Blair, the wife of President Kennedy’s ambassador to Denmark; Pat Kluge, the wife of billionaire Metromedia chairman John Kluge; Shirley Lord, then a beauty editor at Vogue; “and Jack Kent Cooke’s second or third wife, whichever it was,” as Cafritz recalls. “I had warned all the women, ‘Please do not smoke. Nancy does not like smoking. So please honor that.’ And Nancy was so touched by what she had seen on her trip that she literally started to cry at the table. I’m a nervous hostess, I must admit, and by the time we got to dessert I said, ‘I just can’t take it anymore.’ So I lit up a cigarette, and 10 other women lit up with me. And there was Nancy sitting in a haze.”\n\nThe press dutifully covered the First Lady’s initial efforts in the war against drugs, but soon wearied of the repetitiveness of her road show and began to treat “Just say no” like a running joke. In the spring of 1982, however, Nancy Reagan finally found a way to overcome the “unfortunate, one-dimensional image of her as kind of a brittle socialite,” to use the words of Sheila Tate, her press secretary from 1981 to 1985. The venue was the Gridiron Dinner, an annual event put on by a club of 60 print journalists for 600 Washington power players. Traditionally the president and First Lady attend the dinner, which is essentially a roast of them. Tate says that she proposed having Mrs. Reagan make a surprise appearance in one of the evening’s skits, and that the club suggested that the First Lady sing a song making fun of the press. “I went to Mrs. Reagan with their idea, and she said, ‘I can’t get away with that. But I’ll make fun of myself.’”\n\nThe white-tie crowd could hardly believe their eyes when Nancy Reagan stepped through a rack of dresses looking like a sitcom bag lady in a ludicrously mismatched outfit and started singing “Second Hand Clothes,” a parody of Fanny Brice’s “Second Hand Rose.” (“Even my new trench coat with fur collar / Ronnie bought for 10 cents on the dollar.”) As a finale she smashed to smithereens a plate painted to look like the infamous White House china—to cheers and cries of “Encore! Encore!”\n\nBut that summer, shortly after the Reagans returned from a tour of European capitals, including an audience with the Pope, the First Lady was hit with two terrible blows: the deaths of her stepfather on August 19 and of Alfred Bloomingdale the very next day.\n\nMichael Deaver recalls that Nancy Reagan was with Dr. Loyal Davis when he died in Phoenix, and that she “sat there holding his hand for almost an hour after he was dead. She could not let go.” Helene von Damm, in her memoir, suggests that Davis’s death strengthened the First Lady’s sway over her husband.\n\nI could never get over the gap in perceptions between Ronald Reagan and the rest of the world when it came to Nancy. We all thought of her as a demanding and somewhat aloof person. But in his adoring eyes she was the sweetest, gentlest, most wonderful person in the world. . . . Some of us did a good deal of speculating as to why this was so. Our best theory was that Ronald Reagan intended to make this marriage work no matter what. Although he never said so, we sensed that the breakup of his first marriage was one of the great disappointments of his life. It appeared he had made up his mind that this would never happen to him again and as a consequence he gave in to Nancy more than he might have otherwise. He was infinitely patient with her and only on the rarest of occasions would blow up at her—but then it could be in front of a staffer. Only once was I witness to it in the White House. She was relentlessly pursuing the ouster of a person and badgering the President mercilessly. . . R.R. blew his stack and laid down the rule once and for all: he would no longer tolerate her debating any controversial member of the Administration. . . . [But] after her father’s death, the President found it difficult to say no to Mrs. R. and she began interfering more and more in daily White House activities and staff problems.\n\nElaine Crispen, the First Lady’s personal secretary and later press secretary, casts the dynamic of the Reagan marriage in a softer light. “People said she was like the mother hen, too protective of him,” she tells me. “But I remember that if she was going to be home alone, or taking a trip without him, he’d always leave her little love notes. He’d even sort out her vitamins, to make sure she took her vitamin C on the road. I saw them every day after hours up in their private quarters. He never came in without kissing her hello, and he never left for the office in the morning without kissing her good-bye.”\n\nA month before Alfred Bloomingdale died of cancer, he was sued for $5 million in palimony by Vicki Morgan, a 29-year-old California playgirl who claimed that she had been his longtime “confidante, traveling companion, and business partner.” The tabloid press leapt on the sordid scandal, but Betsy Bloomingdale held her head high and buried her husband the morning after his death, with only the immediate family and Jerry Zipkin in attendance. One year later an impoverished Vicki Morgan, whose lawsuit had been thrown out of court, was murdered by her homosexual roommate, Marvin Pancoast, who died in jail years later of aids.\n\nBetsy Bloomingdale says, “When Alfred was ill in the hospital, Nancy called every single day. She knows what a friend is.”\n\n“Alfred was a wonderful man,” says Nancy Reagan, “and wonderful with Betsy. It was a good combination. Whatever else happened, I knew nothing about.”\n\nOver the next six years Betsy Bloomingdale would probably stay at the White House more than any other Reagan friend. In fact, remarkably few friends were asked to stay overnight by the Reagans. “It certainly wasn’t the hotel it is now,” says Elaine Crispen. Among those who did spend a night or two were Bob Hope, the Reverend Billy Graham, Gloria Vanderbilt, and Houston oil-and-gas tycoon Oscar Wyatt and his wife, Lynn, who tells me that the first time they stayed over was after a dinner for Prince Rainier of Monaco. “We were in the Lincoln Bedroom, and Oscar read the Gettysburg Address out loud to me before we went to sleep.”\n\nOnce Watt was forced to resign, in October 1983, after several more gaffes, Clark could be moved into a Cabinet position and make an honorable exit from the foreign-policy battlefield. Clark’s replacement was Robert “Bud” McFarlane, a former Shultz deputy who was then the N.S.C.’s special envoy to the Middle East. He was chosen over James Baker, who wanted the job and had been actively pushed by Nancy Reagan, Vice President Bush, and Michael Deaver, who was hoping to fill Baker’s position as White House chief of staff. In his new position, McFarlane agreed with Shultz, Baker, Deaver, and the First Lady on the need to have the president be seen as “a man of peace” before the 1984 election.\n\nIn September 1984, Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko was the first leading Soviet official to be publicly received by President Reagan at the White House. “I had a lot of talk with Nancy about the Gromyko visit,” says George Shultz, sitting in his office at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. “And we arranged a role for her.” The First Lady was included in a reception for Gromyko before his official working lunch with Reagan, Shultz, and McFarlane and their staffs. As the reception was ending, Gromyko asked Nancy Reagan, “Does your husband believe in peace?” She said, “Yes, of course.” “Then whisper ‘peace’ in your husband’s ear every night,” Gromyko said. “I will,” she replied, “and I’ll also whisper it in your ear.”\n\nElaine Crispen tells me that when Nancy Reagan returned to the family quarters that afternoon, it was “one of those moments when she felt like just flying through that second floor because she was so happy about things.”\n\nTwo months later, in the glow of a booming economy, Ronald Reagan was re-elected with 59 percent of the popular vote: he carried every state but Minnesota, the home of the Democratic nominee, former vice president Walter Mondale. At 73, he was the oldest American to win a presidential election.\n\nAs usual, the Reagans celebrated New Year’s Eve with Walter and Lee Annenberg in Palm Springs. Before dinner, standing in front of van Gogh’s White Roses in evening gowns and tuxedos, the Annenbergs and their houseguests posed for “the annual class picture”—Mr. and Mrs. Armand Deutsch, Mr. and Mrs. Earle Jorgensen, Ambassador to the Vatican and Mrs. William Wilson, Ambassador to the Court of St. James’s and Mrs. Charles Price, President and Mrs. Ronald Reagan. By this time the guest list had grown to almost 100, and included everyone from Jerry Zipkin and Brooke Astor to Caspar Weinberger and George Shultz. The following week, Shultz met with Andrei Gromyko to prepare an agenda for the resumption of arms talks, which Reagan and Konstantin Chernenko had agreed to almost two months earlier.\n\nOn March 10, the day the American and Soviet arms negotiators arrived in Geneva, Chernenko died in Moscow. His successor was 54-year-old Mikhail Gorbachev, who had already impressed Margaret Thatcher on a visit to England a year earlier. “I met Gorbachev first,” Thatcher says, “at Chequers. He was the first Russian politician who would debate openly and easily. Immediately after, I rang Ron and said, ‘This is a man I think I could do business with.’ That’s just how the phrase came out.” On July 1, Gorbachev announced that he would meet with Reagan in Geneva in November.\n\nBy August the Troika was history: Baker had switched jobs with Treasury Secretary Donald Regan, and Meese had become attorney general when William French Smith returned to his law firm in Los Angeles. Deaver had set up his own P.R. firm in Washington, but he was still very close to the Reagans.\n\nBefore the Reagans left for Geneva, Deaver tells me, he called the president and asked to see him. “When I got over there to the residence, I said, ‘Now, Mr. President, I know you’re busy, but let me just tell you something. You have taught me that each of us has a destiny, that there is a purpose to our lives. In my opinion, this is your moment. It’s not George Shultz’s or Bud McFarlane’s moment, it’s yours. And if that’s true, you ought to take this guy aside, alone.’”\n\nThe president, accompanied by Shultz, McFarlane, and Regan, arrived in Geneva three days early. The Reagans were staying at the Maison de Saussure, the villa of Prince Karim Aga Khan and his then wife, the Begum Salima, on Lake Geneva. According to Nancy Reagan’s memoir, she and the president toured Fleur d’Eau, the château where the summit meetings would be held, and found the perfect place for a “tête-à-tête” with Gorbachev—a pool house with a fireplace. In the afternoon of the first day, Reagan suggested that he and Gorbachev take a break from the formal session, and walked him down a path to the pool house. Their so-called fireside chat went on for well over an hour, and the two leaders emerged with an agreement for two more summits, in Washington and in Moscow. Charles Wick, who as U.S.I.A. head was part of the U.S. delegation in Geneva, says that when Reagan and Gorbachev were alone, “Ronnie looked at the guy and said, ‘I just want to let you know, there’s no way you’re going to win.’”\n\nIn October 1986 a second meeting between Reagan and Gorbachev, for preliminary discussions on arms control, was held in Reykjavík, Iceland, at the suggestion of the Soviets. “I was never prouder of Ronnie than at Reykjavík,” Nancy Reagan tells me. “The Soviets wanted to have a meeting—a business meeting—before the next summit. No wives. That was agreed. And then I heard that Raisa was going. She was testing me. And Gorbachev was testing Ronnie. And they both found out. It would have meant monumental changes in the schedule. And I thought, No, I’m not going to do it. I don’t belong there. And it should be what it set out to be. But she went. So that was my test. Ronnie’s test was when Gorbachev wanted him to give up S.D.I. When he called me the first couple of times, he said, ‘Everything is going fine. I’ll be home soon.’ And then I saw them on TV. I’ll never forget that picture of the two of them coming out the door at Reykjavík. I saw the expression on his face, and I knew everything was not fine. He started to get in the car, and Gorbachev said, ‘Well, I don’t know what else I could have done.’ Ronnie said, ‘You could have said yes.’ And he got in the car. Gorbachev found out then you couldn’t push Ronnie.”\n\nIn Iceland, the two leaders had come close to agreeing on massive reductions of their nuclear arsenals. Then Gorbachev surprised Reagan by making this agreement contingent on America’s restricting S.D.I. research, testing, and development to the laboratory. But a real missile-defense system was Reagan’s dream. He had been convinced of S.D.I.’s feasibility by the nuclear physicist Edward Teller at a 1982 White House meeting. For him it was the way to transcend mad, or mutual assured destruction, the long-accepted nuclear doctrine which theoretically ruled out a first strike by either side. According to Richard Burt, “Reagan was not comfortable with a nuclear world where everybody was vulnerable to attack. He wanted to move the competition into an area where we could win, where they just simply couldn’t keep up. And I think that had a fundamental effect on Gorbachev and his senior advisers. Because once Gorbachev understood the limitations of the Soviet system, what they could do and, more importantly, what they couldn’t do, I think he realized that the Soviets had no other alternative but to sit down and negotiate.”\n\nA month after the failed summit in Reykjavík, President Reagan was suddenly engulfed in the Iran-contra scandal when it was revealed that National Security Adviser Bud McFarlane and N.S.C. staffer Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North were involved in secretly selling arms to Iran in exchange for the release of American hostages held by Shiite Muslim terrorists in Lebanon. The profits from the sales were used to support the anti-Sandinista insurgency in Nicaragua, in violation of a congressional ban on aid to the so-called contras. The toll this crisis took was high: McFarlane attempted suicide; his successor, Admiral John Poindexter, and Oliver North were tried and convicted of eight felony counts between them; Weinberger was indicted in 1992 by Special Prosecutor Lawrence Walsh and pardoned by President George Bush before he could be tried. The biggest casualty was Chief of Staff Donald Regan, whose bossy C.E.O. style had grated on Nancy Reagan from the beginning, and whom she blamed for not keeping the president sufficiently informed of what his staff had been doing in his name. As talk of impeachment mounted, she pressed her husband to fire Regan, and, when he refused, brought in her old allies Deaver and Spencer, along with Washington power broker Robert Strauss, to persuade him. As former White House personnel director Robert Tuttle says, “It was never difficult for the president to make a decision on policy. It was very hard for him to make a decision on people.” On February 27, 1987, with the press reporting that Donald Regan had hung up on Nancy Reagan during a fight—she felt that the president was not sufficiently recovered from his operation in January for prostate cancer to hold the press conference on Iran-contra that Regan was pushing for—he heard on CNN that he had been replaced as chief of staff by former senator Howard Baker. Five days later, in a televised address to the nation from the Oval Office, the president assumed responsibility for the mistakes made in Iran-contra.\n\nOn October 17, 1987, Nancy Reagan had a mastectomy, and on October 26, while she was recuperating in the White House, her mother died of a stroke, in her early 90s, in Phoenix. Nancy Reagan still talks about that day. “It was around four o’clock in the afternoon. I was in bed, talking to Ron on the telephone, and Ronnie came in. He sat down on the edge of my bed and told me. . . . I think the death of your mother is especially difficult. I adored my father. I worshiped my father. But when my mother died . . . ohhh. And I never had time to really grieve for her, because I had to do everything that had to be done in Arizona, and then come back and plan the state dinner for the Gorbachevs.”\n\nOn December 8, 1987, in the East Room of the White House, Reagan and Gorbachev signed the I.N.F. Treaty to eliminate all Pershing II and SS-20 intermediate-range missiles in Europe. That night Gorbachev sat on Nancy Reagan’s right in the State Dining Room. He and the other Russian men declined to wear black-tie, but Raisa Gorbachev was in a black brocade evening gown. The 125 guests included Joe DiMaggio, Saul Bellow, Pearl Bailey, James Stewart, Claudette Colbert, Zubin Mehta, David Rockefeller, and Armand Hammer. Van Cliburn played the piano after dinner, and the Gorbachevs sang along to his encore, “Moscow Nights.”\n\nAlso at Nancy Reagan’s table was James Billington, an expert on Soviet affairs who had been director of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars until Reagan appointed him librarian of Congress earlier that year. She had met Billington at the house of Richard Helms and his wife, Cynthia. “The Reagans came to dine with us in our humble home here three times while he was president,” Richard Helms tells me. “On one of these occasions, I had Jim Billington, Nancy, and a couple of other people in a room off the dining room, because we didn’t have room for everybody inside. And it was quite clear that she was genuinely interested in what Billington had to say. I told her that she couldn’t get better or sounder advice from anybody in Russian matters than from Billington.”\n\nBillington flew with the Reagans on Air Force One to the fourth and final summit, in Moscow, in May 1988. The previous month, the Soviets had agreed to withdraw from Afghanistan, and Gorbachev was in the process of opening the Soviet system with his policies of perestroika and glasnost. For Ronald Reagan, according to Shultz, this was a summit about human rights. Billington told me it was the president’s idea to include a reception for 100 Soviet dissidents, ranging from Jewish refuseniks to banned artists, at Spaso House, the residence of the American ambassador. Nancy Reagan told me that Billington then suggested also inviting some dissidents and Russian cultural figures to the official return dinner the Reagans would give at Spaso House the night after the Gorbachevs’ state dinner at the Kremlin.\n\n“The Russians didn’t like us having the dissidents at the embassy for dinner,” says Howard Baker. “And the National Security Council apparatus was concerned about it. But Nancy wanted to have them. And George Shultz was firmly on her side. She and the president and the secretary of state were all unified that this was the thing to do. And it was done. And I think it was a great plus.”\n\nSitting in his office at the Library of Congress, James Billington recalls the Spaso House dinner. “I was at the table with Nancy Reagan and Gorbachev. At that table we also had the writer Tatyana Tolstoya, who was very outspoken and quite lively during the discussion. We had Nina Ananiashvili, a prima ballerina at the Bolshoi. We had Alfred Schnittke, whose music was barely performed in the Soviet Union, because it was very modernist. At other tables, the heads of the K.G.B. and the defense establishment were interacting with their own creative people and dissidents at a civilized dinner given by Americans. Dave Brubeck played some jazz.\n\n“I got close to the Reagans at the time when clearly strength had been established and dialogue was desired,” Billington continues. “And Nancy Reagan was simply extending the range of the exchange and increasing the comfort level of the human contact on both sides. A lot of attention has been paid to her relationship with Raisa Gorbachev, but not much to her relationship with Gorbachev himself. I could see, from that dinner and other occasions, it was thoroughly cordial, with a lot of warmth in it.\n\n“But at the same time there was a certain toughness there, even in the warmth, that had a great effect. One good illustration of that was her determination to see some of the great early [Eastern Orthodox] icons. So we got it arranged for early one morning, only to find that Raisa Gorbachev had gotten there about a half-hour before and was lecturing the press about these paintings, which was mildly annoying. And one of the journalists asked Mrs. Reagan, ‘We’ve just heard a great deal about these paintings from Mrs. Gorbachev, but she never seemed to say anything about their religious significance. Do you think that these are primarily religious works?’ Nancy said something very simple and direct: ‘Just look at them. You can just feel it. I mean, it’s all so obviously there.’ It was a dramatic illustration to everybody there that, while Mrs. Gorbachev knew a lot of things . . . Mrs. Reagan had captured the essence of what these things really meant for the Russian people.”\n\nThe month before leaving for Moscow, the Reagans had hosted a state dinner for Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney, who, like Margaret Thatcher, had become a close friend. “I said to her, ‘Nancy, what do you think is the most important thing you do?’” Mulroney recalls. “She said, ‘Brian, I protect Ronnie from himself.’ And then she said, ‘You know, he has a big Irish heart. He trusts everybody, and he doesn’t see when he’s being blindsided, or when people are acting out of motives that are less than noble. And he never acts upon it once he does. I do.’ I thought it was one of the most candid and revealing statements ever made by an American First Lady.”\n\nAs he continues to talk, over lunch at Le Cirque 2000 in New York, the former prime minister grows increasingly impassioned about Ronald Reagan. “These were extraordinary times we ruled in, because we dealt with—and achieved—some of the most momentous events in modern history: the fall of the Soviet Union, the reunification of Germany within nato, free trade in this hemisphere, and the end of the Cold War. Led by Ronald Reagan, people like François Mitterrand, Helmut Kohl, Margaret Thatcher, and I contributed in a modest way to remaking our international society. So if the polls went up or the polls went down, who cared? If the press said—as they did—that Thatcher and Mulroney were Reagan’s poodles, who cared? You know, when you’ve got a quarterback who can run, who can throw, and who can take a hit—and he’s out there in the rain every Sunday—well, that idea got through to the allies. And when it did, everything jelled.”\n\nOne of the last dinners the Reagans gave at the White House, in January 1989, was in honor of the late New York retailing near-billionaire Milton Petrie and his wife, Carroll. The Petries had paid for portraits of the president and First Lady by Aaron Shikler, which would remain in the White House and were being unveiled that evening. Sitting in her Fifth Avenue living room, which is filled with 18th-century French furniture, paintings, and porcelains, Carroll Petrie tells me, “When they were getting ready to leave, Jerry Zipkin called and asked if we would like to give the portraits to the White House. I discussed it with Milton, and he said, ‘Certainly.’ So two or three nights before they turned the White House over to the Bushes, we were there for a private dinner upstairs. I kept pinching myself, because I was seated on President Reagan’s right. On his left was Katharine Graham. We must have been about 30 people. After dinner they unveiled the portraits. The one of Nancy was so beautiful. Unfortunately, the one of President Reagan was not terribly good. They redid his, but it still wasn’t good. So they got another artist to do it.”\n\nBetsy Bloomingdale is sitting in the library of her house in Holmby Hills, reading aloud from her diary:\n\nJanuary 21, 1989: I’m invited up to the Reagans’ for lunch and to help unpack. They had flown out from Washington the night before. The motorcade right up to the house, the door closes, it’s over. Just like that. It’s over. It’s our system. It works, but it’s hard. “Where’s the light switch? I haven’t turned the lights off for eight years,” says Ronnie. And packing boxes—my God, we’re inundated. Boxes, boxes, boxes. We look at each other and we cry.\n\nWhen Bloomingdale looks up from the page, she is crying.\n\nAccording to Bloomingdale, Nancy Reagan started looking for the perfect retirement house three years before her husband’s second term was up. She settled on a three-bedroom California-style ranch on a densely planted acre in Bel Air, with a view of Los Angeles and no visible neighbors. The address, 666 St. Cloud Road, was a problem, however, for the superstitious First Lady—triple six having satanic associations—so she had the local authorities change it to 668. The $2.5 million price was paid by about 20 investors, including Holmes Tuttle and Earle Jorgensen. “The same couches she had in Pacific Palisades and then in the White House were moved out to Bel Air,” says Elaine Crispen. “They’re both quite frugal about things like that.” Harriet Deutsch gave Nancy Reagan a welcome-back kitchen shower at her house in Beverly Hills.\n\nThe former president and a staff of 12 moved into an office on the 34th floor of 2121 Avenue of the Stars, in nearby Century City—the building used in the movie Die Hard. Unbeknownst to him, at Nancy Reagan’s request Morton Janklow, the New York literary agent who had sold her memoir, My Turn, negotiated a $7-million-plus, two-book contract for Ronald Reagan’s memoirs and his speeches with George Scharffenberger, the trustee of the president’s blind trust. “Ronald Reagan never knew there was a contract,” explains Janklow. “All he knew was that I had expressed interest in response to Nancy’s request to represent him. Bush was inaugurated on January 20, a Friday. Saturday they moved to Bel Air. Sunday I was there. They had packing boxes everyplace. So George Scharffenberger and I went to have lunch with Reagan, and I told him what had happened and how we’d arrived at it. He was very grateful that we had sheltered him from all that so that he wouldn’t be criticized. Then I said, ‘Now, Mr. President, I have a contract which you can affirm or disavow. It’s entirely up to you. These are the terms.’ I walked him through the whole contract, page by page by page. He listened very attentively, and then he said, ‘Look, George and Nancy tell me that I should rely on you. You tell me, should I sign it?’ I said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘Give me a pen.’ Boom. Like that. It was then the highest price ever paid for a nonfiction work.”\n\nIn February 1991, the Reagans were surrounded by all their old California friends at a black-tie dinner at Chasen’s for his 80th birthday. That fall, all five living American presidents—Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Bush—attended the official dedication of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library & Museum in Simi Valley, 30 miles north of Los Angeles. The stone walls of the Mission-style building’s lobby are etched with the names of the contributors to its $60 million cost, including Walter Annenberg, the Republic of China, the Coca-Cola Company, Malcolm Forbes, the General Electric Foundation, Sir James Goldsmith, Dr. Armand Hammer, Bob and Dolores Hope, Japan, John Kluge, Kuwait, the Mobil Corporation, Saudi Arabia, and Edie and Lew Wasserman.\n\nTwo years later, in the summer of 1993, during Ronald Reagan’s annual physical checkup at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Friends say he had begun to show signs of memory loss and disorientation, and that at first Nancy Reagan attributed this to a head injury he had suffered after falling off a bucking horse at the Wilsons’ ranch in Mexico in 1989. New Year’s 1994 was the last one Reagan saw in at the Annenbergs’ estate in Palm Springs. The Great Communicator delivered his last public speech to 2,500 admirers at a Washington, D.C., gala celebrating his 83rd birthday, in February 1994. At the funeral of Richard Nixon later that same year, an aide to Hillary Clinton recalls, “The Clintons noticed how Nancy Reagan was helping him out in a very gracious way, saying, ‘Ronnie, you remember so-and-so . . . ’” On November 5, 1994, Reagan made his illness public in a letter to the nation.\n\nSince then, a nurse looks after him at home. His principal caregiver is his wife, who organizes Saturday golf games for him at the Los Angeles Country Club with old friends such as Bill Wilson. On good days, he is driven to Simi Valley, where he greets tourists. He likes to take walks, accompanied by Secret Service men, in Beverly Hills, and he sometimes stops to shoot baskets with youngsters in a local park.\n\nNancy Reagan represents him at official events. In 1996 she gave a speech at the Republican National Convention in San Diego, and recently she stood in for him at the funerals of Frank Sinatra and Barry Goldwater. An A&E television biography which first aired last year seemed to signal a reappraisal of her role as First Lady, just as this year’s four-and-a-half-hour PBS documentary on Ronald Reagan cast him as the hero who won the Cold War. This fall Random House will publish what promises to be the definitive authorized biography, by Edmund Morris, who has spent the last decade researching and writing it. Meanwhile, the Young America’s Foundation, a Virginia-based conservative youth-outreach group, has purchased Rancho del Cielo, which was on the market for nearly $6 million, as a training center for students who want to “carry on the Reagan legacy.”\n\nOn May 5 of this year, the $816 million, 3.1-million-square-foot Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., was officially dedicated. Designed by James Ingo Freed, a partner of I. M. Pei’s, in a faux-Federal style, it is the largest U.S. government building after the Pentagon. It houses the Environmental Protection Agency, an arm of the government for which President Reagan had very little use, and—more in tune with his free-enterprise credo—a privately run, state-of-the-art world trade center. The afternoon ceremony took place in the 10-story-high, glass-enclosed atrium at the heart of the building, with 1,300 of Ronald Reagan’s friends and former colleagues in attendance. Maureen Reagan and her husband, Dennis Revell, were seated in the front row, flanked by Michael and Carolyn Deaver, Paul Laxalt, Richard Helms, James Billington, Oatsie Charles, William and Buffy Cafritz, Carroll Petrie, close friend Casey Ribicoff, former ambassador Henry and Louise Grunwald, New York socialite Nan Kempner, and Marvin Hamlisch, who had often performed at the Reagan White House.\n\nLined up on the podium, backed by a giant American flag and a two-ton, graffiti-covered section of the Berlin Wall, were Senators Trent Lott, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Strom Thurmond, and Charles Robb, Secretary of Commerce William Daley, Mayor Marion Barry, Bob Dole, George Shultz, Colin Powell, and Katharine Graham. They all stood as Nancy Reagan, in a trim red Bill Blass suit, entered on the arm of President Bill Clinton and the United States Marine Band struck up the national anthem.\n\nIn her speech, Nancy Reagan said, “I’m particularly happy that the Ronald Reagan Building is both public and private, and embraces his lifelong belief . . . in free and open trade.” She ended by quoting her husband: “Some may try to tell us this is the end of an era. But what they overlook is that every day in America is a new beginning. We are a nation that never becomes, but that is always becoming.”\n\nPresident Clinton lauded Reagan’s internationalism and noted that “this incredible space” reflected “the elegance and charm that were the hallmarks of the Reagan White House.”\n\nThat night, a bit of that elegance and charm seemed to be back at the gala dedication dinner in the atrium, where some 70 tables for 10 were set with centerpieces of pink roses and lilacs on purple moiré tablecloths. A benefit for the Children’s National Medical Center and the Ronald Reagan Institute of Emergency Medicine at George Washington University, it began with a concert by Mstislav Rostropovich and cellists from the National Symphony Orchestra. At dinner, Nancy Reagan, in a white sequined sheath by James Galanos, had Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich on one side and Michael Armstrong, the chairman of AT&T, the evening’s underwriter, on the other. Her table faced a huge screen at the rear of the atrium, on which a slow series of photographs of her husband was projected throughout the meal, ending with a picture of him in a tuxedo, holding a flute of champagne, as if he were toasting everyone there.\n\nAt midnight, a police motorcade escorted her white limousine to the newly named Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, where Carroll Petrie’s chartered Westwind jet was waiting to take off for New York. There were six of us on the plane, including two Secret Service men, all still in dinner clothes. Mrs. Reagan wrapped a beige shahtoosh over her sequined dress. Mrs. Petrie wore a black-and-white satin Givenchy couture gown from the late 1980s. Diane Sawyer, who had been one of the speakers at the dinner, and I sat across from the two women. The conversation was entirely political, ranging from what the Clintons will do when they leave the White House to who would make the best Republican candidate in the 2000 election. At that moment, the grande dame of the Grand Old Party seemed most interested in Senator John McCain and Steve Forbes.\n\nShe spent the following week in New York, at the Carlyle Hotel. Brooke Astor and Carroll Petrie gave dinners for her. She caught up with Valentino at a lunch at Nan Kempner’s, and with Yasmin Aga Khan over pasta at Elio’s. She even checked out the Prada boutique on Madison Avenue with Casey Ribicoff. But the main purpose of her visit, she said, was to meet some of the new titans of Wall Street, because she is trying to raise the last $5 million of a $20 million endowment for the Reagan Library.\n\nOn her last night, at a dinner at the Carnegie Hill town house of Reinaldo and Carolina Herrera, she reminisced with C. Z. Guest and laughed at Taki Theodoracopulos’s jokes. “I love seeing everyone,” she told me near the end of the evening, “but it’s time to go home. A week is too long to be away. I miss waking up with Ronnie next to me.”\n\nBob Colacello is a Vanity Fair special correspondent.\n\nNancy Reagan’s Signature Reagan Reds\n\n1 / 15"
