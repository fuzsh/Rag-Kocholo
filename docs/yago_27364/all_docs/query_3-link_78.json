        "text": "Former First Lady Nancy Reagan died Sunday morning in her Los Angeles home, at the age of 94. The cause was congestive heart failure, and as NY1's Michael Scotto reports, she was a defining figure her husband's political career.\n\nNancy Reagan helped define the 1980s.\n\nFor eight years she was the stylish and influential First Lady who worked behind the scenes to shape the presidency of Ronald Reagan.\n\nBorn Anne Frances Robbins in New York City in 1921, she grew up in Chicago.\n\nAfter graduating from Smith College, she began acting, starring in a number of movies.\n\nBut it was her role as the loyal and loving wife of Ronald Reagan that would define her life.\n\nThe two met in 1949, when then-Nancy Davis found her name on a list of suspected communist sympathizers.\n\nFearful of being blacklisted in Hollywood she turned to Ronald Reagan, then the head of the Screen Actors Guild.\n\nA business meeting blossomed into a fabled romance, and in 1952 they married.\n\nReagan soon put her career on hold to help advance her husband's political ambitions, which would ultimately lead to California's governor's mansion and then the White House.\n\nAs First Lady, she was known in private to be fiercely protective of her husband and his image.\n\n\"She was his closet adviser and really his protector,\" said James Baker, White House Chief of Staff to President Reagan.\n\nIn public, she pushed forward her own policy agenda, including her \"Just Say No\" campaign, which urged teenagers to avoid drugs and alcohol.\n\nAfter a mammogram detected cancer, she urged women to get yearly breast screenings.\n\nAt times, her role came under fire. She was criticized for her lavish wardrobe and for consulting an astrologer.\n\nAfter leaving the White House, she cared for her husband, who in 1994 was diagnosed with Alzheimerâs, until his death in 2004.\n\nIn a statement, the President and First Lady said: \"Our Former First Lady redefined the role in her time there.\"\n\nFormer First Lady Barbara Bush, whose husband was Ronald Reagan's Vice President said:\n\n\"Nancy Reagan was totally devoted to President Reagan, and we take comfort that they will be reunited once more.\"\n\nFormer President George W. Bush has also chimed in: \"Mrs. Reagan was fiercely loyal to her beloved husband, and that devotion was matched only by her devotion to our country.\"\n\nReagan will be buried alongside her husband at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California."
