        "text": "Correction Appended\n\nNancy Reagan once said, ''My life really began when I met Ronnie,'' and she often played the role of adoring wife and political spouse. But as Ronald Reagan weakened over the years at their Bel-Air home and he saw almost no one except a live-in nurse and his wife, Mrs. Reagan seemed to grow stronger.\n\nOn the one hand, Mrs. Reagan was physically drained and sometimes despondent over the fact that, as she told friends, her husband no longer recognized her because of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nOn the other hand, Mrs. Reagan, whose early White House years were marked by her interests in designer clothes and social events, turned into nothing less than an advocate for Alzheimer's causes and stem-cell research. Supporters say such research could aid the fight against Alzheimer's, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injuries and other serious health problems. The Bush administration has limited how government money can be spent on embryonic stem-cell research because it involves the destruction of human embryos.\n\nCasey Ribicoff, a close friend of Mrs. Reagan's whose husband, the former Senator Abraham A. Ribicoff of Connecticut, died in 1998 after suffering from Alzheimer's disease for many years, said in a telephone interview: ''Even when Nancy went out to lunch or dinner, she was never more than five minutes away. She always had to be very near. It's a long goodbye, a very long goodbye. Nobody knows what it's like. There's no communication. Silence. It's devastating.''\n\nMrs. Ribicoff said that Mrs. Reagan's involvement with stem-cell research led to meetings with doctors and researchers, motivating the former first lady to call Republican leaders and others in Washington over the last two years to press the case for research behind the scenes. ''She made calls without hesitation,'' Mrs. Ribicoff said. ''She would ask, 'Why are you not supporting this?' ''\n\nBetsy Bloomingdale, one of Mrs. Reagan's closest friends, said Sunday that the stem-cell issue had in essence given Mrs. Reagan, 81, a meaning to her life. Beyond this, Mrs. Bloomingdale said, Mrs. Reagan and her daughter, Patti Davis, reconciled after a strained relationship. ''The wonderful thing that has come into her life is stem cell,'' Mrs. Bloomingdale said. ''Her life has been that, and she's had the children around, which is a wonderful thing, because Patti is in the fold. That's been very special for her, and that's been helpful.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
