        "text": "Nancy Davis was born in Queens, New York on July 6, 1921. She grew up in Chicago with her mother, who gave up a career as an actress when she married, and her father, a renowned neurosurgeon. She attended the Girls Latin School and went on to Smith College, where she studied theater. In her early career, Nancy Davis worked as an actress in stage, film and television productions. In 1951, she met the president of the Screen Actors Guild, Ronald Reagan. They married on March 4, 1952 and from that moment on their legendary romance captivated the attention of the nation. As First Lady of California, Nancy spent many hours visiting veterans, the elderly, and the disabled, and she also championed the Foster Grandparent Program. As First Lady of the United States from 1981â€“1989, she focused on drug and alcohol abuse among young people. Nancy Reagan was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in recognition of her lifelong dedication to family and the nation. Her greatest devotion, however, was to her husband. In the last decade of his life, her priority was caring for him at home as he battled Alzheimer's disease. She has supported the Alzheimer's Association and its affiliate, the Ronald and Nancy Reagan Research Institute."
