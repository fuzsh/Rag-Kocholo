When we have confirmed access, the full article content will load.\n\nNancy Reagan, an Influential and Protective First Lady, Dies at 94\n\nSlide 1 of 19\n\n1/19\n\nMarch 6, 2016\n\nNancy Reagan, the influential and stylish wife of the 40th president of the United States who unabashedly put Ronald Reagan at the center of her life but became a political figure in her own right, died on Sunday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 94.\n\nThe cause was congestive heart failure, according to a statement from Joanne Drake, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Reagan.\n\nMrs. Reagan was a fierce guardian of her husband’s image, sometimes at the expense of her own, and during Mr. Reagan’s improbable climb from a Hollywood acting career to the governorship of California and ultimately the White House, she was a trusted adviser.\n\n“Without Nancy, there would have been no Governor Reagan, no President Reagan,” said Michael K. Deaver, a longtime aide and close friend of the Reagans who died in 2007.\n\nPresident Obama said on Sunday that Mrs. Reagan “had redefined the role” of first lady, adding, “Later, in her long goodbye with President Reagan, she became a voice on behalf of millions of families going through the depleting, aching reality of Alzheimer’s, and took on a new role, as advocate, on behalf of treatments that hold the potential and the promise to improve and save lives.”\n\nNancy Reagan: Her Most Memorable Moments\n\nNancy Reagan, who died March 6, was a socialite, onetime actress and behind-the-scenes influence. As first lady, she was best known for her devotion to both her husband and his policies. Here are some archived moments in the life of the woman behind the man.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
