        "text": "Designed by graphic artist Meneese Wall, this beautiful art portrait and accompanying biography features First Lady Nancy Reagan.\n\nBorn on July 6, 1921, to Kenneth and Edith Robbins in Queens, New York, Anne Frances was named for her grandmothers, but nicknamed “Nancy” at an early age. Her name was legally changed to Nancy Davis in 1938 following her adoption by Loyal Davis, her mother's second husband. The future first lady embarked on a successful acting career after graduating from Smith College in 1943. On March 4, 1952, she married Ronald Reagan and the couple settled in California. Giving up acting to care for their children, Patricia Ann and Ronald Prescott, Nancy Reagan later focused her energy on supporting her husband's political career. Her years as first lady of California, 1967–1975, were later followed by eight years as first lady of the United States. She is especially remembered for her leadership in the battle against drug and alcohol abuse and for her support of the Foster Grandparents Program. Following the presidency she established the Nancy Reagan Foundation, developed the Nancy Reagan Afterschool Program, and advocated for stem-cell research. When Ronald Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, she served as his primary caregiver. Nancy Reagan died on March 6, 2016, at the age of ninety-four."
