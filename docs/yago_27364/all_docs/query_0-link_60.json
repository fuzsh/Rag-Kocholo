        "text": "Former first lady Nancy Reagan, the fierce protector of the nation's 40th president, died Sunday at 94. The Reagans’ mutual devotion over 52 years of marriage was legendary. Here are some of the moments that defined their love story.\n\nThe meeting\n\nIn her memoir, My Turn, Nancy Reagan said she learned in 1949 that her name was on an industry blacklist of Communist sympathizers. Suspecting a mix-up with another Nancy Davis, her maiden name, she sought the help of the president of the Screen Actors Guild, Ronald Reagan, for help. In a story varnished into lore by the Reagans, the meeting soon led to romance.\n\nThe marriage\n\nNancy Reagan often said, \"My life didn't really begin until I met Ronnie.\"\n\nThe public intimacy\n\nThey were forever holding hands. The Reagans' devotion to one another was so fierce their children complained they felt like outsiders in their own family.\n\nThe gaze\n\nShe watched his political speeches with a look of such steady adoration it was dubbed “the gaze.”\n\nThe defender\n\nNancy Reynolds, a former aide and close family friend, recalled traveling on a plane with Nancy Reagan a few weeks after her husband was elected governor of California in 1966. A man behind them was griping about Reagan's stance in a budget battle in Sacramento. \"She pushed her seat back, looked him right in the eye and said, 'That's my husband you are talking about, and you don't have the facts straight,'\" Reynolds recalled. \"Then she clicked the button that brought the seat up. She wasn't shy.\"\n\nThe presidency\n\nLongtime aide Michael Deaver, who died in 2007, once said, “Without Nancy, there would have been no Governor Reagan, no President Reagan.\" USA TODAY's Owen Ullmann said, \"She was his only close confidant and friend, and his No. 1 adviser. In retrospect, I must say she served him — and the country— very well.\"\n\nThe assassination attempt\n\nThe March 30, 1981, assassination attempt on the president convinced her that \"I had to be more involved in seeing that my husband was protected in every possible way.\" Nancy Reagan, who had a longtime interest in horoscopes, said she used forecasts in hopes of predicting the safest times for the president to venture out of the White House.\n\nThe Alzheimer’s\n\nIn 1994, Ronald Reagan wrote a letter to the American people to say he was withdrawing from public life. \"Finally she had her beloved Ronnie all to herself,\" said Kati Marton, author of Hidden Power: Presidential Marriages That Shaped Our History, \"and basically he ceased to be who he had been. It was the greatest tragedy of her life.\" Asked in a 1999 C-Span interview what she did when her husband didn’t recognize visitors, she replied: “Well, now we don’t have visitors … we never let that happen.”\n\nThe love notes\n\nHe called her “Mommy,” and penned a lifetime of gushing love notes. She saved these letters, published them as a book, and found them a comfort when he could no longer remember her.\n\nThe goodbye\n\nAt the president's funeral in June 2004, the world watched the tearful widow lean over his coffin to say farewell.\n\nReunited\n\nReagan spoke of how terribly she missed her husband in her final years. In 2009 she told Vanity Fair magazine how she’d pressed evangelist Billy Graham for reassurance that they would be reunited after death. “I said to him, ‘Just tell me if I’m going to be with Ronnie again. Just tell me that and I’ll be OK.’ “ He said, ‘You are.’ And I said, ‘OK.’” Nancy Reagan will be buried beside her husband on a hilltop at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California.\n\nContributing: Associated Press"
