WASHINGTON — Nancy Reagan, wife of President Ronald Reagan, has died at the age of 94.

An actress during the Golden Years of Hollywood, Nancy Davis married Ronald Reagan in 1952 and became a stalwart supporter of his political career, all the way to the White House in 1980. After his death in 2004, Mrs. Reagan continued to protect and promote his legacy and was active in charitable and political causes, though none other was as controversial as her “Just Say No” anti-drug campaign during the early 1980’s.

Reports say Mrs. Reagan died of congestive heart failure.
