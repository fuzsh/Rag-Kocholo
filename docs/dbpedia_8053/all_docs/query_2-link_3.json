        "text": "The last monarch of the short lived Korean Empire (preceded by the Kingdom of Korea) abdicated under occupying Japanese pressure in 1910.\n\nNow, 107 years later, one of the key issues would be how to decide who to make the king of a reinstated constitutional monarchy. Reinstating a descendant of the last monarch of Korea's great, great grandchild or something like that is an idea with not nearly as much appeal as the idea of taking someone who have founded the nation or otherwise earned the respect of the people by leading the country for a long time and formally calling that person the King.\n\nThis problem is a general one which causes most Republics to establish the elected office of President to do what a monarch in a constitutional monarchy would do, rather than establishing a monarchy.\n\nNorth Korea, whose third generation leader Kim Jong Un is a de facto absolute monarch, is much more typical of how monarchy has emerged historically. Some powerful figure managed to gain control of the state somehow or other, and has enough control of the state to pass it on to his descendants until this is viewed as legitimate and normal, as opposed to a corrupt circumvention of some other political system or dynasty of monarchs.\n\nA fictional treatment in graphic novel and television series form called Goong imagines what Korea might be like if the monarchy had not been abolished, in a mostly pro-monarchy treatment.\n\nNot only that there is no perceived need by the people of South Korea to restore its monarchy, but also there is really no one that is a good potential monarch out there.\n\nAfter the Japanese annexation of Korea, the Korean imperial House of Yi became members of the Japanese imperial house (House of Yamato), and the deposed Korean Emperor were accorded the status equivalent to Japanese imperial princes. After World War II, most Japanese imperials lost their status - so did the Korean imperial family.\n\nThe last Korean Emperor, Emperor Sunjong, was infertile, so the cognatic line of the House of Yi has died away. There were brothers and nephews of Emperor Sunjong, but there is a problem - many of them have joined the Imperial Japanese Army during wartime (as did most Japanese imperial family members), and this certainly would be more or less unwelcome in Korea. In fact, Yi Un, the Crown Prince Euimin, was not even allowed to return to South Korea (presumably for his association with the Japanese military).\n\nSo there definitely wasn't a positive image associated with the House of Yi in Korea - but who else could be a good potential monarch of Korea? The Goreyo kingdom is a distant past, and descendants of the Kingdom of Goreyo's House of Wang are almost impossible to find. In addition, unlike Europe, there wasn't a hereditary nobility in Korea, so there are no high nobles who could become a potential monarch. A new royal house could certainly be proclaimed - but this wouldn't be too legitimate of a new regime.\n\nIn conclusion, even if the Koreans wanted their monarchy back, they would have a hard time finding a good candidate for the throne. And Koreans didn't want a monarchy as well (why fixed something that's not wrong) - so almost no one wants the restoration of the Korean monarchy.\n\nThe current form of government is a democratic republic. Since \"Korea\" is not some kind of monolithic, independently sentient being, the question is really, \"Why don't the PEOPLE of South Korea restore a monarchy?\"\n\nSince democratic forms of government have greater control and power residing with the people through the electoral process, this would mean the people ceding power to an autocrat.\n\nWhile there are many instances of power being moved from autocrats to the people, I can't think there are many, if any, instances of the people willingly choosing to move the other way.\n\nOther than \"it once was that way,\" I really can't see any arguments for why a society would want to do that."
