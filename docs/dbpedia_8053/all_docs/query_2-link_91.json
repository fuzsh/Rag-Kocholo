        "text": "What the EU is doing and why\n\nTo effectively combat the global circulation of dirty money, international efforts are needed. The Commission is actively working with international partners for instance through the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global standard setter on anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing. The FATF notably identifies jurisdictions having strategic deficiencies in their regimes to counter money laundering and terrorist financing. The EU’s listing takes into account the recommendations provided by FATF.\n\nThe identification of high-risk counties is required in order to protect the EU financial system and the proper functioning of the internal market. The Commission is empowered to identify high-risk third countries which have strategic deficiencies in their anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism frameworks. This reduces the risks that could pose threats to the Union’s financial system.\n\nIn line with the Directive (EU) 2018/843 (5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive), gatekeepers, such as banks, are obliged to carefully consider business relationships and transactions involving high-risk third countries through increased checks and control measures defined under Article 18a of the Directive.\n\nLatest version of the list of high-risk third countries\n\nOn 12 December 2023, the European Commission adopted a new Delegated Regulation in relation to third countries which have strategic deficiencies in their AML/CFT regimes. The Delegated Regulation amends Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1675.\n\nThe following jurisdictions are identified as having strategic deficiencies in their AML/CFT regimes:\n\nHigh-risk third country Date of entry into force Afghanistan 23 September 2016 Barbados 1 October 2020 Burkina Faso 13 March 2022 Cameroon 18 October 2023 Democratic Republic of the Congo 16 March 2023 Gibraltar 16 March 2023 Haiti 13 March 2022 Iran 23 September 2016 Jamaica 1 October 2020 Mali 13 March 2022 Mozambique 16 March 2023 Myanmar 1 October 2020 Nigeria 16 July 2023 North Korea 23 September 2016 Panama 1 October 2020 Philippines 13 March 2022 Senegal 13 March 2022 South Africa 16 July 2023 South Sudan 13 March 2022 Syria 23 September 2016 Tanzania 16 March 2023 Trinidad and Tobago 6 March 2018 Uganda 23 September 2016 United Arab Emirates 16 March 2023 Vanuatu 23 September 2016 Vietnam 18 October 2023 Yemen 23 September 2016\n\nA consolidated version of the EU list is available (with only measures that already entered into force).\n\nThe listing process\n\nObjectives of the list\n\nThe objectives of the list can be subdivided into three main goals:\n\nProtecting the integrity of the Union's financial system and internal market\n\nReinforcing internal security\n\nPromoting sustainable development\n\nWhat are the steps\n\nThe listing process follows a staged approach that can be divided into four parts:\n\nPriority setting\n\nPre-assessment to determine the countries to be assessed and identify the level of priority of their assessment, in addition to countries already listed by the Financial Action Task Force.\n\nAssessing\n\nAssessment of the relevant 3rd countries’ anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regimes, starting with countries of the highest priority.\n\nListing\n\nListing high-risk third countries that show strategic deficiencies in their anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regimes.\n\nFollow-up\n\nMonitor progress of listed countries, continue monitoring of already reviewed countries, and assess additional countries.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo ensure a fair and transparent process concerning the identification of third countries, the Commission developed a methodology in 2020. The methodology aims to clarify the measures to identify the high-risk countries based on the faults in their national AML/CTF regimes posing significant threats to the EU’s financial system.\n\nMore information on the methodology\n\nPlanning of assessment\n\nThe Commission carried out a pre-assessment to determine relevant countries to be assessed and the level of priority, in addition to those already listed by the Financial Action Task Force. Countries are considered relevant for the EU financial system in case they meet any of the following non-cumulative criteria\n\na country is identified by the European External Action Service or by Europol as having a systemic impact on the integrity of the EU financial system\n\na country was reviewed as an international offshore financial centres by the International Monetary Fund\n\na country is considered as economically relevant based on the strength of the economic ties with the EU and the magnitude of its financial sector\n\nOn this basis, the Commission identified 132 jurisdictions so far that will be further analyzed according to its methodology over the period 2018-2025. The list of 132 countries included in the scope.\n\nWith regard to the level of priority\n\nthe Commission reviews as a matter of priority a first group of 54 jurisdiction (Priority 1 countries). The assessment is an ongoing exercise; hence any country will be reassessed when new relevant information sources become available\n\nthe other jurisdictions (Priority 2 countries) will be assessed successively until 2025\n\nEvolution of the list\n\nBased on Directive (EU) 2015/849 and the Commission’s power of adopting delegated acts regarding high-risk third countries, the Commission adopted the following delegated acts:\n\n18 January 2024\n\nPublication of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2024/163 amending the EU list.\n\n28 September 2023\n\nPublication of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2070 amending the EU list.\n\n26 June 2023\n\nPublication of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/1219 amending the EU list.\n\n24 February 2023\n\nPublication of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/410 amending the EU list.\n\n21 February 2022\n\nPublication of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/229 amending the EU list.\n\n7 December 2020\n\nPublication of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/37 amending the EU list.\n\n7 May 2020\n\nRevised methodology for identifying high risk third countries\n\nFATF lists as a baseline/ and increased synergies with FATF listing process\n\nadditional countries based on EU own assessment based on increased engagement\n\nEnhanced consultation of Member States’ experts\n\nPublication of Delegated Regulation (EU) amending the EU list\n\n27 July 2018\n\nPublication of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/1467 amending the EU list.\n\n22 June 2018\n\nFirst methodology for identifying high risk third countries\n\nFATF lists as a baseline\n\nadditional countries based on EU own assessment\n\n13 December 2017\n\nPublication of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/212 amending the EU list.\n\n27 October 2017\n\nPublication of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/105 amending the EU list.\n\n14 July 2016\n\nFirst EU list – based on FATF lists (Delegated Regulation (EU) 1675/2016).\n\nRelevant legislation\n\nFATF\n\nThe Commission is a member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the main international body concerned with combating money laundering, the financing of terrorism and other threats to the integrity of the international financial system.\n\nMONEYVAL\n\nThe Commission is an observer in Moneyval – the Council of Europe body assessing compliance with AML/CFT standards.\n\nEGMONT\n\nThe Commission is an observer at the Egmont Group, an international organisation that provides financial intelligence units with a platform for the secure exchange of expertise and financial intelligence to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and associated predicate offences."
