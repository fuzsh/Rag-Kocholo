A final comprehensive touch could be achieved by revising each chapter (the basic ingredients are already there) through the addition of interpretive paragraphs, or by adding a chapter consisting of a thorough discussion by all the authors of Korean society and culture (the Korean value system). Korea Old and New is now the most reliable and useful general survey. It will be a valuable stepping stone to a more comprehensive Korean history that hopefully will record the painful ongoing search of the Korean people, both north and south, for a new cultural synthesis in the twentieth century. Soon Won Park University of Maryland, Asia Division A Heritage ofKings: One Man 's Monarchy in the Confucian World, by JaHyun Kim Haboush. New York: Columbia University Press, 1988. 304 pp. $47.50. In the eighteenth century, the kingdom of Chosön (1392-1910) experienced something of a restoration. This hiatus in the prolonged decline of the dynasty began under King Yöngjo (1724-1776), who was able to reestablish some semblance of control over the fractious officialdom and achieve significant fiscal reform. In this book, JaHyun Kim Haboush describes how Yöngjo managed to halt the slide of his dynasty's fortunes. Whereas treatments of similar episodes in Chinese dynasties have tended to emphasize socioeconomic and institutional factors, Haboush has focused on how moralistic Confucian discourse informed court politics in late traditional Korea. In doing so she has rendered a genuine service to students of Korean and East Asian history. The book has many strengths. Of particular value for the nonspecialist or the beginning student are the concise discussion of the limitations that Korea's aristocratic sociopolitical system imposed on the Chosön kings, the well-done overview of the major themes of Confucian political discourse, and the introduction to Confucian court rituals. Haboush also makes significant contributions to the specialist's understanding of Chosön dynasty court politics by showing that Yöngjo was able to dominate his court to a surprising degree for a late Chosön monarch and by demonstrating that kings, as well as officials, could make use of Confucian rhetoric to gain and maintain power. It is, of course, the price Yöngjo had to pay for his success in using that moralistic rhetoric that forms the climax of this book. Haboush's depiction of how Yöngjo's concern for his public image as a sage king gave rise to terrible conflict in his private relationship with his son and heir-apparent, Prince Sado, forms a powerful story filled with sympathetic insights into the Confucian royal mind. Despite some misgivings about psychological history, particularly in a case such as this where we have no memoirs or diary from which to work, I found Haboush's treatment of Yöngjo coherent and compelling. BOOK REVIEWS1 1 9 No book, however, is totally without faults, and this present volume contains a few minor flaws, such as the absence of any references for the interesting discussion of yuhak (p. 90), and the somewhat outmoded use of the royal surname Yi instead of the dynastic name of Chosön. Of more significance, perhaps, is the treatment of factionalism. Haboush contends that factionalism has been overrated as a debilitating factor in Chosön political history (pp. 118-119). I am sympathetic but not totally convinced, because factional interests apparently played the central role in perpetuating the suspicion of regicide that clouded Yöngjo's reign and ultimately led to the tragic split between him and his son (pp. 124, 161-65). Finally, as I finished the book, I could not help but wish that Haboush had chosen to use her understanding of Confucian politics and her findings about Yöngjo and his reign to shed light on some of the major historiographical issues of the late Chosön, such as the significance of Yöngjo's reign— and particularly his policy of impartiality (t'angp'yöng eh 'aek)—in the transition from the factional politics of the seventeenth century to the royal-in-law politics (sedo..."
