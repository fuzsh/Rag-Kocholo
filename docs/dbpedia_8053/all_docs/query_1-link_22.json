        "text": "Family-controlled business empires known as chaebol dominate the economy and wield significant political influence, which has historically protected their interests despite calls for reform. Corruption scandals involving chaebol bribery have affected almost all of South Korea’s former presidents. In August 2022, President Yoon pardoned a number of chaebol executives who were involved in bribery scandals during Park Geun-hye’s 2013–17 administration.\n\nThe National Intelligence Service (NIS) has been implicated in a series of scandals in recent years, including allegations of election tampering. A 2020 reform bill limited the NIS’s mandate to collecting information related to North Korea and overseas interests and prohibited it from conducting domestic surveillance.\n\nIn July 2022, the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family (MGEF) was raided over accusations that MGEF officials had assisted the DP in electoral activities ahead of the March polls.\n\nDespite government anticorruption efforts and robust investigations and prosecutions, practices such as bribery, influence peddling, and extortion persist in politics, business, and everyday life. The 2016 Improper Solicitation and Graft Act establishes stiff punishments for those convicted of accepting bribes and applies to government officials as well as their spouses, journalists, and educators. The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials investigates corruption allegations against public officials and can unilaterally indict police officers, prosecutors, and judges. Conflict-of-interest legislation for public servants took effect in May 2022.\n\nOfficials appointed during the Moon administration came under scrutiny for their conduct during 2022. In August, the BAI began an audit of the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission over absenteeism allegations that included chairperson Jeon Hyun-heui, a Moon appointee; Jeon reported she was facing pressure to resign. As of December, the BAI was considering whether to question Hong Jang-pyo, a Moon administration official, over allegations that the previous administration manipulated economic data.\n\nDP aides and officials, including Lee Jae-myung, came under scrutiny over their conduct relating to a land-development project in Seongnam, where Lee served as mayor between 2010 and 2018. Lee was indicted for violating election laws by allegedly disseminating false information over the affair in September 2022. A staff member of a DP-affiliated think tank was arrested over bribery allegations in October, while a Lee ally in the DP was indicted in December. Authorities raided the offices of the think tank in October, searching for evidence that Lee accepted illegal funds related to the land project.\n\nAn investigation into speculative land purchases based on insider information via the Korea Land and Housing Corporation ended in March 2022; a total of 4,251 people were referred to prosecutors, 64 were arrested, and 150.7 billion won ($116.3 million) in profits were seized.\n\nIn December 2022, Yoon said he would pardon former president Lee Myung-bak, who received a corruption-related prison sentence in 2018 and exhausted his appeals in 2020.\n\nThe news media are generally free and competitive, reporting aggressively on government policies and allegations of official and corporate wrongdoing. However, a defamation law authorizes prison sentences or fines, encouraging some self-censorship, and journalists have faced political interference from managers and government officials.\n\nThe Yoon administration has signaled that media criticism of its activities could result in retaliation. In September 2022, the PPP filed a defamation suit against the Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) for publishing a video of President Yoon apparently cursing while speaking to aide after meeting with US president Biden. In November, MBC journalists were denied access to the president’s plane and presidential media briefings were suspended. Also in November, the PPP-controlled Seoul City Council legislated to cut funding for Traffic Broadcasting System (TBS) starting in 2024. TBS radio host Kim Ou-joon had been accused of demonstrating an on-air left-wing bias and breached broadcasting rules during the 2022 electoral period; Kim left TBS in late December.\n\nAccess to North Korean media is banned. News coverage or commentary deemed to favor Pyongyang can be censored and lead to prosecution under the NSL. In July 2022, the Unification Ministry published a report recommending a loosening of restrictions.\n\nThe Korea Communications Standards Commission (KCSC) evaluates online content and blocks or deletes material according to vaguely defined standards; most of the affected content is reportedly related to illegal sex work, pornography, gambling, promotion of illegitimate food and medicine, or other criminal activity.\n\nIn September 2022, prosecutors raided the offices of the country’s broadcasting regulator, the Korea Communications Commission, over concerns that it manipulated the broadcast-renewal process for two television outlets in 2020.\n\nReports of abuse by prison guards are infrequent. Prison conditions generally meet international standards.\n\nViolent crime is relatively rare, but the country remains at war with North Korea, resulting in a heavy military presence in some areas and the constant threat of renewed combat. Minor incidents of violence near the de facto border are not uncommon.\n\nSeveral police officers were arrested or faced warrants over the October 2022 Itaewon disaster, in which 158 people died in a crush. A legislative inquiry had not begun by year’s end.\n\nIn December 2022, Moon Jae-in–era national security advisor Suh Hoon was arrested for allegedly mishandling the repatriation of two North Korean fishermen in 2019 and the death of a South Korean fishery official at the hands of North Korean soldiers in 2020.\n\nSouth Korea lacks a comprehensive antidiscrimination law. Members of the country’s small non-Korean population face legal and societal discrimination, especially in the workforce. Children of foreign-born residents and single foreign parents are systematically excluded from education and medical systems, though in 2021 the government began granting temporary stay permits and related benefits to children of undocumented migrants who were born in the country.\n\nApproximately 33,900 North Korean defectors have entered South Korea since 1998. While the government aims to socially integrate defectors, they can face months of detention and questioning upon arrival. Some defectors have reported abuse in custody and societal discrimination.\n\nNorth Korean defectors need not apply for asylum using the same process as other applicants. Those from other countries are far more likely to have their claims rejected or mishandled by immigration officials; the country’s refugee recognition rate has stood below one percent for several years. Afghan evacuees have reported religious discrimination and difficulty finding jobs in their respective fields.\n\nWomen generally enjoy legal equality but face significant social and employment discrimination; when compared to men, they enjoy a lower employment rate and suffer a pay gap. Sexual harassment of women, including in the workplace, is common; a number of political figures have been accused as part of the #MeToo movement. Digital sex crimes against women in 2021 increased by 82 percent when compared to 2020 according to the KCSC. Neither “semen terrorism”—the act of spreading semen onto another individual or their property—nor the theft of personal objects for sexual purposes are considered sex crimes.\n\nNearly 80 percent of stalking victims are women according to civil society. Few measures are taken to stop assailants from repeatedly approaching victims. In October 2022, Jeon Joo-hwan, a former Seoul Metro employee, was indicted for murdering a female colleague whom he had stalked. That murder led to calls for stronger antistalking punishments and greater protections for women.\n\nSame-sex relations are not restricted for the general population, but soldiers are subject to a “disgraceful conduct” provision of the Military Criminal Act (MCA) and typically face two-year prison terms for such activity. But in April 2022, the Supreme Court overturned two men’s MCA convictions; they had engaged in same-sex activity off-duty in a private residence. Existing human rights legislation bars discrimination based on sexual orientation but lacks specific penalties for violations; transgender people are not explicitly protected. In a survey released by Dawoom, an LGBT+ rights NGO, in May 2022, 66.9 percent of transgender respondents said they experienced discrimination in the previous year, 41.5 percent of all respondents considered suicide, and 8.2 percent attempted it.\n\nWhile protections against exploitative working conditions are enforced, foreign migrant workers, who number 480,000, remain vulnerable to illegal debt bondage and forced labor, including sex trafficking. Migrant workers’ groups have denounced the employment permit system and legislation that makes it difficult for individuals to change their employment, which can expose workers to abuses. Couriers, some of whom have died from overwork, typically lack the labor protections of full-time employees.\n\nWomen in South Korea are vulnerable to recruitment by international marriage brokers and sex traffickers. Many foreign women who have suffered sexual violence face language barriers and are reluctant to come forward due to their employment status. Although the government actively prosecutes human trafficking cases, those convicted often receive light punishments. In its Trafficking in Persons Report 2022, the US State Department noted that authorities initiated fewer trafficking prosecutions than in its previous reporting period."
