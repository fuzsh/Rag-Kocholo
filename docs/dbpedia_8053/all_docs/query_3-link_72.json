        "text": "The Central African Republic is one of the world’s least-developed countries, with over 60 percent of its population living in poverty. The country does have some important natural resources, with timber and diamonds dominating exports. However, transportation and the electrical infrastructure is extremely limited. The government has been unstable for decades, suffering repeated military coups. Although cease-fire agreements were reached with multiple rebel groups in 2011, the agreement has yet to be fully implemented and parts of the country remain outside the control of the government. Endemic poverty and weak governance have contributed to a dire health situation, with very high maternal mortality and low life expectancy. Access to education is also limited, particularly for girls.\n\nUSAID focuses on responding to humanitarian crises in the Central African Republic."
