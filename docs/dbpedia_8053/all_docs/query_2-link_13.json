        "text": "Gojong (born September 8, 1852, Seoul, Korea [now in South Korea]—died January 21, 1919, Seoul) was the 26th monarch of the Joseon (Yi) dynasty and the last to effectively rule Korea.\n\nGojong became king of Korea while still a young boy. During the first years of his reign, power was in the hands of his father, Daewon-gun, who as regent attempted to restore and revitalize the country. When Daewon-gun was kidnapped and taken to China in 1882, power passed to Gojong’s queen, Min, who opposed all modernization efforts. She was assassinated by the Japanese in 1895. Two years later, in an effort to save the country, Gojong elevated himself from king to emperor and changed the name of the country from Joseon to Daehan (“Great Han”), actions symbolic of his independence from China.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz"
