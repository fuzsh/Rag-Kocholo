Unfortunately, I see one big flaw in it: Why would Japan and Korea wait until WWII or even until 1931 when Japan IOTL invaded Manchuria to deal with the threat of republicanism in China? Also, if Japan and Korea were threatened that much by Chinese republicanism as in your scenario, just imagine how much more they'd be threatened by the Bolsheviks taking over Russia and how both Japan and Korea intervening in the Russian Civil War might affect things (assuming one or both of the two Russian Revolutions of 1917 and/or the Russian Civil War weren't butterflied away or greatly altered). Ultimately, I think it's quite possible that if one used the POD you suggest for Japan and Korea to remain monarchies. Actually, it's possible due to Japanese-Korean intervention that the Chinese monarchy is restored in one form or another and is able to survive for a long period of time perhaps even until the present.\n\nWho's going to industrialize Korea?\n\nThe problem is how can you have a union that is balanced enough so that one country doesn't have an overwhelming economic stake in the other? After the Ruso-Japanese war Korea affected became a 'protectorate' state of the Empire of Japan. This meant that even though Korea had an independent economic policy they were obliged to not maintain independent foreign relations, which culminated in annexation as a pseudo-punitive measure when Korea secretly sent delegates to the Second Hague Convention to protest their status.\n\nEven the economic independence would be nominal as Article 8 and 9 of the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1876 already enshrined unhindered access by Japanese businesses to Korean land, resources and tariff free trade. The only exceptions seemed to be emerging industries, according to one source, where the Korean Emperor authorized a joint venture with American businessmen such as the initial stages of electrification during a period of reform. The only reason this came about was due to a continuation of strong relations dating back to the period of American missionary presence.\n\nThe issue is how to balance out relations that doesn't assure complete domination over the other without one party becoming paranoid of the other. An interesting prospect to entertain was if Japan kept Korea as a semi-independent protectorate into the period of revolutionary China would the Korean royals entertain the idea of forming a personal union with Japan's counterparts and thus solidify a commonwealth of sorts, even if only symbolically. There was no concept of such being done in Asia but considering they were already trying out a myriad of western ideas on governance, why not.\n\nLet's say the Japanese actually have a stake over Korean Monarch's survival rather than outright annexing them, and the ironic possible POD is the growth of Chinese Republican sentiments in late 19th century also grows in Korea and Japan\n\nYes, Japan did have some early hostilities with Korea, but then, let's say Korea clearly siding with Japan in Russo-Japan war.\n\nSoon, after Sun Yat Sen's revolution, they will definitely grew closer and LESS HOSTILE because the threat of Republicanism is greater than their historical hostilities, especially since both Dynasty have been intermarriaged in the past, they ARE viewed as \"foreign dynasty\" in BOTH their empire (although not as bad as the Qing).

(we're also both Koreans and amateur historians)\n\ntl,dr: this ain't gonna happen."
