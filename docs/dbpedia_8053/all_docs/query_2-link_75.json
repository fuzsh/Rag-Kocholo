        "text": "Thai police have charged former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra with insulting the monarchy over comments he made almost a decade ago.\n\nOfficials said on Tuesday that the complaint concerns a 2015 interview that Thaksin gave while in South Korea. The potential charge comes just weeks before his possible release on parole. Although it is not yet clear if the case will go ahead, the jailed billionaire is the latest political figure to face prosecution under the country’s strict lese majeste laws.\n\nThe complaint was filed by the military government that ran Thailand after overthrowing a government led by Thaksin’s sister Yingluck Shinawatra in May 2014. Thaksin has repeatedly pledged loyalty to the monarchy.\n\nPrayuth Pecharakun, spokesman for the attorney general’s office, told reporters that the long delay in acting on the complaint was due to Thaksin’s previous absence from the country.\n\nBackroom deal\n\nThe controversial billionaire, twice a prime minister but overthrown in a 2006 coup, returned from self-exile in August last year. He was immediately jailed on corruption and abuse-of-power charges.\n\nThe 74-year-old was transferred to a police hospital almost straight away and has undergone at least two operations.\n\nProsecutors will wait for police to complete their investigation before deciding whether to proceed with the case, Prayuth said.\n\nThaksin denies the charge and has written to the attorney general asking for fair treatment, he added.\n\nInsulting the crown is a serious offence in Thailand, where the constitution states the king must be held in a position of “revered worship”.\n\nThe lese majeste law is one of the strictest of its kind in the world, carrying a jail sentence of 15 years for each perceived insult to the monarchy. Critics say the law has been weaponised to silence dissent.\n\nThere has been a surge in charges under the laws – known in Thailand as “112” after the relevant section of the criminal code – since youth-led pro-democracy street protests in 2020. At least 260 people have been prosecuted under it in recent years.\n\nThaksin’s return to Thailand coincided with his Pheu Thai Party’s return to power in a controversial deal with promilitary parties.\n\nThe timing triggered rumours of a backroom deal to help Thaksin with his legal troubles. That speculation was fuelled further when the king cut his jail sentence from eight years to one year."
