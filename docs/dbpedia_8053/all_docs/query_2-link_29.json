        "text": "Source: Washington, DC: Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 1995\n\nDemetrios G. Papademetriou and Kimberly Hamilton identify and analyze the conceptual problems and principal issues involved in thinking about and developing contemporary immigration policy regimes. They argue that policy makers must develop immigration policies that are at once effective in dealing with changing world conditions, capable of reaping immigration's benefits, able to sustain public support, and consistent with international commitments."
