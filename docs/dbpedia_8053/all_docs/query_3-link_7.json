        "text": "A republic is a form of government in which the people elect, or choose, their leaders. In most countries with a republican government, the people elect the head of the government, such as a president. They also elect other people, called representatives, to make laws.\n\nThe leaders of a republic are responsible to the people who elected them. If the people do not like the way their leaders govern, they can vote them out of office. This means that the people are the source of power. This sets republics apart from countries led by a king or another all-powerful ruler.\n\nToday most countries are true republics, meaning that the people choose their leaders. These republics practice a form of democracy. A democracy is any government in which the people have a say. The United States, Mexico, India, France, Kenya, South Korea, Peru, and Indonesia are only a few of the world’s many true republics.\n\nSome countries call themselves republics simply because a monarch (a king or a queen) is not the leader. They are not always democracies.\n\nOther countries practice democracy but are not really republics, either. In the United Kingdom the people vote for representatives in Parliament (the country’s lawmaking body). But they also have a monarch. However, the monarch has little real power.\n\nThe first republic was in ancient Rome. In 509 bce the Romans set up a republic that lasted for almost 500 years. A group of elected leaders called the Senate was the highest power in the government.\n\nThe next important democratic republics formed in the late 1700s. In 1788 the United States set up the first modern republic. An elected president leads the U.S. government. Groups of elected leaders called senators and representatives make the laws."
