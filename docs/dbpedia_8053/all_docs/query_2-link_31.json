        "text": "The Imperial Family of Korea is the ruling family of the Joseon and Korean Empire that was founded by King Seong-gye Lee in July of 1392.\n\nThe mission of the Imperial Family is to represent the Great Korean People as a symbol of love, human rights, peace, freedom and solidarity.\n\nThe Crown and the Imperial Family, additionally, recognize excellence among the people.\n\nMost importantly, the Imperial Familyâ€™s goal is to bring power to the people.\n\nThe Imperial Family, today, engages in governance but does not stake claim to the the Korean Peninsula, as well as symbolic, cultural and historical activities. Additionally, the Imperial Family continues to enlighten the land and bring power to the people through multiple campaigns and programs as it has since its inception.\n\nGlobally, the family stands as a symbol of solidarity and leadership for the Great Korean People.\n\nThe Imperial Family recognizes the Republic of Korea to maintain its own independent and autonomous government. As such, the Provisional Charter of Korea which serves as the base of the Constitution of the Republic of Korea, continues to show preference and recognition to the Imperial Family."
