The difference between the following are given below;\n\nDisadvantages of Republic government\n\nDue to the election system in the republic government, it becomes expensive because of expenditure on resources to conduct elections. Sometimes it has adverse impacts on underdeveloped countries.\n\nThe functioning of this government is better in smaller level nations than bigger nations.\n\nPeople under this generally belong to the same kind of background i.e., they are diversified in nature.\n\nSometimes, due to diversities, the majority of the power is held by the higher-level people, which negatively impacts the less privileged people.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe government that the people lead is referred to as a republic government. The Republic government and democratic government both shared some common principles that support the reliable system. Many countries follow a structure that combines both republican and democratic principles. In a republic government, citizens have liberties and exercise a voting system. India is run on the principle of democracy purely."
