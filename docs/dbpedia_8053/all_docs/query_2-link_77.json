        "text": "At first glance, the Buckingham Palace ballroom looked much as it has done for any state event in living memory. Only the most honoured of guests, welcomed into the monarchy’s headquarters, would have noticed the subtle changes that ensured this state banquet – the first since the Coronation – had a distinctly modern feel.\n\nThe glasses and plates on the top table had been carefully scrubbed of the EIIR cypher that endured for the 70 years of Elizabeth II’s reign and replaced with the CIIIR of her son.\n\nThe flowers included ferns dug up and repotted repeatedly under the King’s quest for sustainability.\n\nAnd then there was the speech, which referenced one of the most popular K-pop bands in the world and saw the King lament his lack of “Gangnam Style”.\n\nTelling his 171 guests of his affection for South Korea, he said: “Sadly, when I was in Seoul all those years ago, I am not sure I developed much of what might be called the Gangnam Style!”\n\nThe quip was a reference to arguably the most famous K-pop song of all, the 2012 hit Gangnam Style by Psy, which came with its own galloping dance craze.\n\nIt raised a chuckle from his audience, at the crescendo of a day in which the Royal family pulled out all the stops to welcome the president and first lady of South Korea to London for the first state visit since the Coronation, in a show of intergenerational royal co-ordination.\n\nAt Horse Guards Parade, for the full pomp and ceremony of Britain’s military, the Queen and Princess of Wales wore the colours of the South Korean flag to greet their diplomatic guests, one in blue and the other in a vivid red cape.\n\nIn the evening, the Queen opted for red velvet while the King wore his white tie with the Garter Star and Thistle Star along with a new Grand Order of the Mugunghwa, presented to him earlier that day by the president.\n\nThe Princess of Wales wore a white Jenny Packham gown, earrings from the late Queen, the Royal family order and the Strathmore Rose Tiara that once belonged the Queen Mother, King Charles’s beloved grandmother, and has not been worn since.\n\nIt was a glamorous end to a day in which the King, his heir and their wives had worked together to host the president and first lady through a private lunch, which was briefly disturbed by news of a rocket launched by North Korea, and an exhibition of Royal Collection items relating to their country.\n\nThe Prince of Wales was heard to confirm a future “date in the diary” for them to meet again, while the Princess was heard, tantalisingly, to mention “karaoke”. President Yoon Suk Yeol is a known fan of karaoke who serenaded Joe Biden with his version of American Pie at the White House, but his on-microphone performance at Buckingham Palace was limited to a warm speech of friendship.\n\nThe Queen presented Mrs Kim a pashmina hand embroidered with the Mugungwha – the national flower of South Korea – and the names of the first lady’s dogs, created by embroiderers from The Royal School of Needlework.\n\nThe King sprinkled his speech with pop culture references, from band BTS to Blackpink, whose four young female members were at the banquet and praised for their environmental campaigning. “I can only admire how they can prioritise these vital issues, as well as being global superstars,” he said.\n\nThe late Queen Elizabeth II was represented, with her son recalling how she was “struck on her state visit to Korea in 1999 not just by the incredibly warm welcome she received across your country, but also by the beauty and harmony of the traditional villages and temples of Andong, amongst your country’s majestic mountains”.\n\nQueen Camilla wore her late mother-in-law’s ruby and diamond Burmese tiara.\n\n“Yeong-gug-e osin geos-eul hwan-yeonghabnida [Welcome to Britain],” the King said, quoting Korean poetry and referring to a 140-year-old partnership between the countries “in which close personal connections, fostered over many decades, have blossomed today into a real sense of affection, or jeong, between our societies at so many levels”.\n\nSome 4,700 miles away, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were in Vancouver, watching an ice hockey game and basking in the admiration of fans who knew the then-Meghan Markle from her time in Canada filming the television drama Suits.\n\nA Sovereign’s Escort of the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, the Life Guards and the Blues and Royals, commanded by Major Edward van der Lande, put on a display of the best of British military, as Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, Lord Cameron, the Foreign Secretary, James Cleverly, the Home Secretary, and defence chiefs of staff watched on from a dais.\n\nMr Yoon, accompanied by the King, inspected a guard of honour, formed by F Company Scots Guard.\n\nAfter the ceremonial welcome, came the traditional carriage procession back to Buckingham Palace for a private lunch, where it was said there was a small “flurry” as a main course of chicken coincided with news of North Korea launching what it claims to be a spy satellite."
