        "text": "The 1988 constitution vests executive power in a directly elected president, who is limited to a single five-year term. Executive elections in South Korea are largely free and fair. Moon Jae-in of the liberal Democratic Party (DP), also known as the Minjoo Party, won a 2017 snap presidential election following the impeachment of former president Park Geun-hye. Moon took 41 percent of the vote, followed by Hong Jun-pyo of the conservative Liberty Korea Party (LKP) with 24 percent and Ahn Cheol-soo of the centrist People’s Party with 21 percent. About 77 percent of registered voters turned out for the election.\n\nWhile voters were not unduly pressured by electoral authorities, Kim Kyoung-soo, the governor of South Kyŏngsang Province, collaborated with blogger Kim Dong-won to manipulate the dissemination of 80,000 news articles so that social media platforms would portray Moon more positively. Governor Kim was convicted and sentenced to two years in prison for the scheme in January 2019; the sentence was upheld in July 2021, and he was eventually forced to leave office.\n\nIn October 2021, DP presidential candidate Lee Nak-yon appealed the results of the DP’s primary election, which Lee Jae-myung won with 50.29 percent of the vote. Ballots for candidates who dropped out during the primary were not counted in that total; doing so would have reduced Lee Jae-myung’s share to under 50 percent and forced a runoff vote. Lee Nak-yon’s appeal was rejected, and Lee Jae-myung was set to face the conservative People Power Party (PPP) nominee, Yoon Seok-youl, in the March 2022 general election. The two presidential candidates made corruption allegations against each other and threatened to pursue charges if elected.\n\nIn April 2021 subnational by-elections, two metropolitan mayoralties and two municipal mayoralties were among the 21 positions contested. The PPP won both metropolitan mayoralties, along with 13 of the 19 other positions. In October, Busan mayor Park Heong-joon was indicted on charges of making false statements during his campaign in April. Also that month, prosecutors declined to indict Seoul mayor Oh Se-hoon on the same charges, saying that statements he had made while campaigning did not violate election law.\n\nFamily-controlled business empires known as chaebol dominate the country’s economy and have amassed significant political influence, which has historically protected their interests despite calls for reform. Corruption scandals involving chaebol bribery have affected almost all of South Korea’s former presidents. President Moon came to power promising to reform these large firms, but instead relied on chaebol to bolster the country’s domestic supply chains as it faced the continued economic consequences of a trade war with Japan and COVID-19.\n\nThe National Intelligence Service (NIS) has been implicated in a series of scandals in recent years, including allegations that it sought to influence the 2012 presidential election and later conducted illegal surveillance targeting President Park’s opponents. In December 2020, the legislature passed a reform bill that limited the NIS’s mandate to collecting information related to North Korea and overseas interests and prohibited the agency from conducting domestic surveillance operations; responsibility for investigating pro-Pyongyang activities in South Korea was set to be transferred to the police by the end of 2023. Despite pressure from organizations like Human Rights Watch, the new law did not reform or repeal the NSL.\n\nDespite government efforts to prevent corruption, practices such as bribery, influence peddling, and extortion persist in politics, business, and everyday life, though investigations into and prosecutions of such acts are robust. The 2016 Kim Young-ran Act, or Improper Solicitation and Graft Act, establishes stiff punishments for those convicted of accepting bribes and applies to government officials as well as their spouses, journalists, and educators. In January 2021, the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials (CIO) was established to investigate corruption allegations against public officials including legislators, prosecutors, judges, and the president, with the authority to unilaterally indict police officers, prosecutors, and judges.\n\nOngoing investigations have examined allegations that public officials and employees related to the Korea Land and Housing Corporation (LH) engaged in speculative land purchases based on insider information, with the first warrant issued in March 2021. The suspects at year’s end numbered in the hundreds, including three National Assembly members. In October, a similar investigation was launched into the role played by an aide to Lee Jae-myung, the presidential candidate and outgoing governor of Gyeonggi Province, in a land development project in Seongnam. Amid growing anger over real-estate scandals, President Moon called for new legislation to combat conflicts of interest among public servants.\n\nSamsung vice-chairman Lee Jae-yong was sentenced to five years in prison in 2017 for bribery related to former president Park’s administration; after a retrial, he was sentenced to 30 months in prison in January 2021, then released on parole in August after serving 18 months in total.\n\nIn 2020, a former aide to President Moon was arrested for allegedly accepting bribes and leaking information about a state inspection of a troubled hedge fund during his time in the Blue House. Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae ordered Prosecutor General Yoon Seok-youl to recuse himself from the matter, claiming that he had failed to conduct fair, thorough investigations into opposition politicians and prosecutors implicated in the case. The intervention was unusual and criticized as an abuse of power amid a wider dispute between Choo and Yoon that eventually led both to resign, in December 2020 and March 2021, respectively; Yoon went on to run for president on behalf of the PPP. In September 2021, the CIO opened an investigation into charges that Yoon had abused his power and meddled in politics while in office as prosecutor general.\n\nThe news media are generally free and competitive, reporting aggressively on government policies and allegations of official and corporate wrongdoing. However, a defamation law authorizes sentences of up to seven years in prison or fines of up to 50 million won ($44,000), encouraging a certain degree of self-censorship, and journalists have faced political interference from managers and government officials.\n\nNews coverage or commentary deemed to favor North Korea can be censored and lead to prosecution under the NSL, and access to North Korean media is banned. In addition, the Korea Communications Standards Commission evaluates online content found by its staff or referred to it by other government agencies, and blocks or deletes the material according to vaguely defined standards, though most of the affected content is reportedly related to illegal sex work, pornography, gambling, promotion of illegitimate food and medicine, or other criminal activity.\n\nIn April 2021, new sales of founding North Korean leader Kim Il-sung’s memoir in South Korean bookstores raised controversy. The Unification Ministry evidently did not grant permission for the memoir to be available for public consumption, and the South Korean publisher, Kim Seung-kyun, faced possible prison time if he was found to have violated the NSL.\n\nIn July 2021, the DP proposed revisions to the country’s Act on Press Arbitration and Remedies, etc. for Damage Caused by Press Reports that would increase media responsibility for fake news. In August and September, both Human Rights Watch and Reporters Without Borders criticized the draft amendments for being too broadly written and threatening freedoms of the press and expression.\n\nFreedom of religion is guaranteed by the constitution and generally respected in practice. In October 2021, however, the National Human Rights Commission of Korea stated that the suspension of a mosque construction project in Daegu was due to discrimination and prejudice.\n\nUntil recently, the military conscription system did not permit conscientious objection, and hundreds of men—nearly all of them Jehovah’s Witnesses—were imprisoned each year for refusing military service. A 2018 Constitutional Court ruling found that the government had to provide alternative forms of service for conscientious objectors, and as of June 2021, 1,419 of 2,173 objectors had gained approval to perform alternative service.\n\nCoronavirus cluster cases that were traced back to churches led to restrictions on gatherings of large groups of worshippers through most of 2020 and 2021. The Shincheonji Church of Jesus was linked to more than 5,000 cases associated with the country’s initial outbreak and was sued by the city of Daegu for ignoring quarantine efforts. Its leader, Lee Man-hee, was arrested and indicted in August 2020, but in January 2021 he was acquitted of breaking public health laws.\n\nHuman rights groups and other nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are active and generally operate freely, despite the risk of political pressure when they criticize the government or other powerful interests. Many South Korean NGOs rely on government grants even as they pursue independent agendas.\n\nNGOs focusing on human rights in North Korea and on support for defectors came under intense scrutiny and pressure during the tenure of President Moon, who prioritized improving inter-Korean relations. The North Korea Human Rights Foundation (NKHRF), which was established by a 2016 law and was meant to provide financial support to human rights activists and organizations, has been largely inactive since its funding was cut by 93 percent in 2018. The Moon administration ordered a crackdown in 2020 on human rights activists who send balloons carrying leaflets across the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), after North Korean authorities denounced the practice, and officials revoked the licenses of two organizations engaged in such activities; authorities raided the office of a balloon activist in May 2021. Lawmakers adopted legislation banning the transfer of information, goods, and money to North Korea without government approval in 2020, prompting nearly 30 human rights groups to file a constitutional complaint. In February 2021, four North Korean defectors announced their intention to sue Unification Minister Lee In-young for defamation, claiming that he had deemed defector testimonies to be “untrustworthy lies.”\n\nThe chief justice and justices of the Supreme Court are appointed by the president with the consent of the National Assembly. Appointments are made based on recommendations from the chief justice, who is assisted by an expert advisory committee. The chief justice is also responsible for appointments to the lower courts, with the consent of the other Supreme Court justices. The president, the National Assembly, and the chief justice each nominate three members of the Constitutional Court. The judiciary is generally considered to be independent, but senior judges have been ensnared in corruption scandals in recent years.\n\nYang Sung-tae, who served as chief justice from 2011 to 2017, faced ongoing legal proceedings during 2021 after being accused in 2019 of manipulating high-profile cases in 47 instances to serve the interests of the administration and major businesses. Trials for several other judges who had been indicted for misconduct in 2019 have also moved forward, with at least three acquitted and two receiving suspended sentences.\n\nIn early February 2021, Lim Seong-geun, a senior judge at the Busan High Court, was impeached by the National Assembly for his involvement in a judicial scandal under the Park administration, becoming the first sitting judge to be impeached in the country’s modern history. However, the Constitutional Court, which reviews impeachments, rejected the move in October, as Lim had retired at the end of his term in late February.\n\nSouth Korea lacks a comprehensive antidiscrimination law. Members of the country's small non-Korean population face legal and societal discrimination, especially in the workforce. Children of foreign-born residents are systematically excluded from education and medical systems, though in April 2021 the government began granting temporary stay permits and related benefits to children of undocumented migrants who were born in the country. Separately, a mandatory COVID-19 testing requirement for foreign workers in Seoul was withdrawn in March amid concerns about discrimination.\n\nApproximately 33,800 North Korean defectors have entered South Korea since 1998. While the government aims to integrate this group into society, defectors can face months of detention and questioning upon arrival. Some defectors have also reported abuse in custody and societal discrimination.\n\nNorth Korean defectors do not need to apply for asylum using the same process as other applicants. Those from other countries are far more likely to have their claims rejected or mishandled by immigration officials. In 2021, only 3.3 percent of applicants were granted refugee status or humanitarian protection. A group of 391 Afghans who were evacuated to South Korea as part of the US-led troop withdrawal from Afghanistan in August were only granted “special contributor” status, having worked for the South Korean embassy or other state agencies. While the decision was explained as an attempt to avoid the discrimination and resistance South Koreans often harbor toward refugees, it raised questions about the Afghans’ access to the government assistance and permanent residency normally afforded to refugees.\n\nWomen generally enjoy legal equality but face significant social and employment discrimination. Women currently hold 5.2 percent of executive positions at publicly listed companies. They earned 35.9 percent less income than men in 2020, a larger gender wage gap than in any other member state of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD); the gap has reportedly worsened during the pandemic. President Moon pledged in March 2021 to reduce “career interruptions” for women, though no legislation has been passed to support such efforts.\n\nSexual harassment of women in the workplace is common, and a number of political figures have been accused as part of the #MeToo movement. The newly elected mayor of Seoul, Oh Se-hoon, vowed to address sexual harassment in the government, announcing a zero-tolerance policy in April 2021. In October, 15 military officials were indicted on charges related to an attempted cover-up in the case of an Air Force officer who died by suicide in May, months after she alleged that a colleague had sexually assaulted her.\n\nSame-sex sexual relations are not restricted for the general population, but soldiers who engage in such activity are subject to a “disgraceful conduct” provision of the Military Criminal Act and face two-year prison terms. While existing human rights legislation bars discrimination based on sexual orientation, it does not offer specific penalties for violations, and transgender people are not explicitly protected. In 2020, a transgender soldier, Byun Hee-soo, was forcibly discharged following her gender confirmation surgery. Byun filed a lawsuit, but died by suicide in March 2021; a court then ruled in October that her discharge should be reversed. A watchdog organization found that 65.3 percent of 588 transgender survey respondents had experienced discrimination in the previous year."
