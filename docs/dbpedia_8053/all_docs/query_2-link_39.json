        "text": "What’s happening: South Korea’s 2024 general election took place on April 10, and the Democratic Party (DP) won a majority of seats in the country’s parliament. South Korea has two main political parties: the DP and the People Power Party (PPP). DP is progressive, and the PPP is conservative. Until mid to late March, the PPP was leading in public polls. However, the DP was leading in the weeks prior the election.\n\nWhy this matters: We can expect a significant policy shift in North Korean human rights issues and the treatment of North Korean human rights groups in South Korea now that the DP controls the National Assembly. The DP and PPP have competing policies on how to achieve peace on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nPut simply, the DP seeks dialogue and engagement with the North Korean regime at almost any cost, even if it means cracking down on North Korean human rights groups in South Korea.\n\nThe PPP is open to engagement but with conditions, such as including North Korean human rights as a part of any dialogue with the Kim Jong Un regime."
