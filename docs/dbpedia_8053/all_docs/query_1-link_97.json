        "text": "Trust, Balance and Growth in K-Public Procurement: A Step Closer to the People\n\nTrust, Balance and Growth in K-Public Procurement, A Step Closer to the People Release of 'K-Public Procurement, The Next Stage,' PPS’ Emotionally-Appealing and Inviting Promotional Video Featuring Art Director Kang Sue-jin of the Korean National Ballet On June 24, the Public Procurement Service (PPS) unveiled \"K-Public Procurement, The Next Stage\" on its official YouTube channel. This promotional video highlights the value and importance of public procurement. * http://www.youtube.com/@ppsprno1 The video, produced in collaboration with the Korean National Ballet, sensitively illustrates the role of public procurement by drawing parallels between the perfect harmony of a ballerina and a ballerino and the seamless connection between businesses and the public sector, leading to corporate growth and economic development. The work interweaves the roles and meanings of ballet and public procurement to convey four key messages: ▲Trust – 'Fair and Transparent Public Procurement' ▲Balance – 'Greater Efficiency and Innovation' ▲Harmony – 'Companion to SMEs, Start-ups and Innovative Companies' ▲Growth – 'K-Public Procurement Leaping onto the World Stage.' These messages reflect PPS's commitment to working as a reliable partner to SMEs, start-ups and innovative companies with fair and transparent public procurement and assisting Korea’s government procurement in gaining greater global acknowledgement. This collaboration is notable not only for its unique theme but also for the meaningful participation of Ms. Kang Sue-jin, Art Director and CEO of the Korean National Ballet along with soloists Byun Seong-wan and Cho Yeon-jae, who contributed their talents pro bono for the public interest. * Byun Seong-wan - Winner of Grasse Award at the 25th Grasse International Ballet Competition in France Cho Yeon-jae - Winner of the 2022 Prima Ballerina Award from the Korea Ballet Association Soloist Cho Yeon-jae shared her thoughts on the project, saying, \"It was meaningful to express the harmony and balance of ballet in the context of public procurement. I hope more people will take an interest in and support both public procurement and ballet.\" Director Kang expressed her hopes, stating, \"Just as young ballet dancers eventually reach the world stage after years of hard work, I hope Korean companies will make the most use of public procurement as a stepping stone to become global giants and lead the growth of the nation’s economy.\" PPS Administrator Lim Ki-keun stated, \"While most promotions for public agencies have mainly focused on logical explanations so far, this video aims to add an emotional touch through collaboration with the Korean National Ballet. PPS will continue to strive for better outcomes and policy promotion in public procurement, taking a step closer to the people and businesses.\" Additionally, the video’s making process and interviews are showcased in the “Behind the Scenes of K-Public Procurement, The Next Stage” on PPS’ official YouTube channel."
