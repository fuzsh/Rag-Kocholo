        "text": "Sweden is a constitutional monarchy, which means that HM The King is the country's Head of State and his duties are regulated by law. The fact that Sweden should have a king or a queen regnant as its head of state is established in the Instrument of Government – one of the kingdom's constitutional laws. As a non-political Head of State, the monarch is a unifying representative of Sweden and a symbol of the country.\n\nSweden has been a continuous monarchy since the 10th century, making it unique in the world with its historical and cultural heritage stretching back more than a thousand years. Although the role of the Head of State has changed with the development of society, the monarchy represents continuity and tradition – which is of growing importance in a rapidly changing world. Sweden's current king, Carl XVI Gustaf, ascended to the throne on 15 September 1973 and is the country's 74th monarch.\n\nThe King carries out his duties in accordance with his motto, \"For Sweden – With the Times\", which involves promoting Swedish interests and being attentive to the many efforts made in and for Sweden.\n\nFull cognatic succession\n\nThe line of succession is determined by the order of succession, which is one of Sweden's four constitutional laws. Having had an agnatic (male) line of succession since the beginning of the 18th century, a fully cognatic line of succession was introduced in 1980. As a result of this change – which Sweden was the first country to introduce – the monarch's oldest child inherits the throne.\n\nState visits aim to lay the foundations for strengthened personal contacts and increased political, trade and cultural exchanges between the countries involved. State visits are also accompanied by government ministers and a business delegation.\n\nCeremonial traditions\n\nThe programmes for state visits usually last for two or three days, and follow the country's traditions and ceremonial patterns. Most state visits begin with ceremonies and other official elements on the first day.\n\nIn the case of incoming state visits, the visiting head of state is met by The King and Queen at the Royal Stables before travelling by horse and carriage to the Royal Palace for the official welcoming ceremony. The day also includes a private lunch at the Royal Palace, a meeting with the Speaker of the Riksdag and the Prime Minister, and a gala dinner at the Royal Palace.\n\nDay two usually includes a number of trade and culture promotion events in Stockholm, and sometimes lunch at Stockholm City Hall. It is also customary for the visiting country to host a reciprocal dinner or a similar event in the evening.\n\nThe third day of the state visit is normally spent at another location in Sweden.\n\nOutgoing state visits follow much the same pattern in the host country.\n\nOfficial visits\n\nAn official visit is a slightly lower form of visit between two countries. Every year, The Crown Princess and Prince Daniel conduct official visits abroad at the request of the Government. These official visits also include government ministers, and usually a business delegation. The King and Queen can also carry out official visits. These visits often have the same content as a state visit, but with a slightly less formal structure.\n\nThe history of the monarchy\n\nSweden's monarchy is one of the oldest in the world, and is based on traditions that stretch back over a thousand years. There have been more than 70 monarchs during this period, all of whom can be named.\n\nWith the introduction of Christianity, royal power was gradually strengthened. During the Middle Ages, royal power was not hereditary in a formal sense. The nobility and the privileged classes came into being in the late 13th century. At the same time, Sweden also gained a council, a kind of government. From this point, the country thus had central power in the form of a king and a council. The Swedish hereditary monarchy was established in the 16th century.\n\nSeveral different dynasties have since been included in the list of Swedish monarchs. Since the former French marshal Jean Baptiste Bernadotte, Sovereign Prince of Ponte Corvo, ascended to the throne in 1818 as King Karl XIV Johan, the Bernadotte dynasty has ruled Sweden.\n\nSymbols\n\nThe crown, the sceptre, the orb and the key of the realm – the Swedish Royal Regalia – symbolise the traditions of the kingdom.\n\nThe Regalia indicate royal rank at major royal ceremonies such as enthronements, christenings, weddings and funerals.\n\nThe royal symbols also include the greater and lesser national coats of arms. The national coats of arms symbolise the Swedish state. The greater coat of arms is also The King's personal coat of arms.\n\nOrders and medals\n\nOrders and medals allow the Head of State to recognise outstanding contributions for the benefit of society.\n\nSince the Head of State is the country's supreme representative, these awards are an expression of the country's gratitude, and are therefore very much appreciated.\n\nThe King awards the Order of the Seraphim, the Order of the Sword, the Order of the Polar Star and the Order of Vasa to Swedes, foreign citizens and stateless individuals.\n\nThe King awards five royal medals to Swedish citizens, with HM The King's Medal being the most commonly awarded and consisting of eight levels."
