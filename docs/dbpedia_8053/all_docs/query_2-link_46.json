Until the 20th century, the most common form of government was the monarchy. This article will throw light on the monarchy system of governance.\n\nMonarchy System – Facts\n\nThe authority and political legitimacy of monarchy may vary from largely symbolic, restricted and autocratic. It can expand across the domains of judicial, legislative, and executive. The succession of monarchs is, in most cases, hereditary, often building dynastic periods.\n\nConstitutional monarchy is largely symbolic.\n\nAbsolute monarchy is known as fully autocratic.\n\nMonarchs – Various Titles\n\nThe various titles given to the Monarchs are Pharaoh, Shah, Sultan, Tsar, Khan, Raja, Queen, King, Empress, and Emperor.\n\nMonarchy – Current Status\n\nCurrently, 43 nations in the world have a monarchy. 15 commonwealth nations share Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. Modern monarchies are constitutional monarchies.\n\nConstitutional Monarchy – Countries\n\nA constitutional monarchy, also known as the parliamentary monarchy or democratic monarchy, is a form of monarchy in which the monarch exercises their authority in accordance with a constitution and is not alone in deciding. Absolute monarchy and constitutional monarchy are different.\n\nThailand, Malaysia, Japan, Belgium, Sweden, Canada, the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Spain, and Cambodia are examples of constitutional monarchies. In these countries, the monarchs retain significantly less personal discretion in the exercise of their authority.\n\nThe other countries which are examples of constitutional monarchies are Bahrain, Kuwait, Jordan, Morocco, Monaco, and Liechtenstein.\n\nConstitutional Monarch – Lack of real power\n\nA constitutional monarch is a sovereign who reigns but does not rule.\n\nA constitutional monarch does not choose political leaders.\n\nA constitutional monarch does not set public policies.\n\nIn the European constitutional monarchies, the governments may operate in the name of the monarch, but those monarchs have no formal authority.\n\nAbsolute Monarchy\n\nIn an absolute monarchy, the king or the queen has absolute power. An absolute monarchy is a form of monarchy in which the monarch rules in their own right. Absolute monarchy in Europe reduced drastically after the French Revolution and World War I. The autocratic rule of the Tsar in Russia came to an end after the Russian revolution.\n\nExamples of Absolute monarchy are Saudi Arabia, Vatican City, Oman, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Eswatini (formerly known as Swaziland), and Brunei.\n\nRelated Links\n\nWhy did the Tsarist autocracy collapse in 1917?
