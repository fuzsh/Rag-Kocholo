        "text": "Generally this category would refer to the plethora of Platform Enamel Signs that adorned our stations. Platform 1 in regional colours is an all time favourite as is Way Out, Ladies and Gentlemen. Rarities appear such as Wash & Brush Up and bespoke directions to other platforms and named destinations. However, enamel signs were not confined to stations. Some company Trespass notices were enamel such as LMS, Fire Bucket notices were similar as were some trackside signs. Running-in-Boards with station names adorned platform ends, usually large and often in 2 or more pieces fitted together in frames. Some companies and British Railway regions utilised enamel for their Signalbox Nameboards and even Destination Indicator Boards."
