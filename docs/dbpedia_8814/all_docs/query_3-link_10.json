        "text": "I'm posting this as I recently had occasion to use St. James Park station in Exeter. The train was terminating there and the guard came through advising everyone (just me, I think) to move forward to the front door to alight. I was surprised how short the Exmouth-bound platform was (37m according to Wikipedia compared to 73m for the down platform). I assume a 150 can call but anything longer must use selective door opening if available or just a single door (it was a 3-car 158).\n\nWikipedia also says \"plans were announced in May 2019 to extend Platform 2 to fit two coach trains (sic), with works proposed to begin in Spring 2020\". Work is no doubt delayed by Covid.\n\nAnyone know of other similar examples?\n\nCan't think of a current example, but there will be stations where the goods yard connection restricted the length of one platform, but the other side could be lengthened as needed.\n\nI am sure the SR did that on various electrified routes, but I can't think of a specific example.\n\nOn other railways, Teignmouth was one, though the proportion was about 3:2 not 2:1\n\nBourne End can accommodate a five car 165 in one platform and only a 2 car in the other. It's because the line to Marlow branches off about halfway down the station.\n\nAt off peak times only the short platform is used. Trains arrive from Maidenhead, reverse and then continue to Marlow. At peak times, there's a shuttle using the long platform between Maidenhead and Bourne End and another between Bourne End and Marlow.\n\nIt wasn't built that way, originally the line to High Wycombe continued across a level crossing on a major road and the Marlow platform was a separate bay. Trains longer than about three or four carriages would make two stops, blocking the level crossing.\n\nI'm posting this as I recently had occasion to use St. James Park station in Exeter.

Work is no doubt delayed by Covid.\n\nAnyone know of other similar examples?\n\nBest looking at the Timetable Planning Rules and the platform length section, easy to see any discrepancies between platforms there. Some that stand out are Bury St Edmunds, Kew Gardens, Kings Lynn, Lakenheath, March, Thetford, Woodbridge, Lowdham, Mansfield Town, Newark Castle, Radcliffe, Spondon, Ashburys, Bentham, Chelford, Cov Arena, Gt Missenden, Greenfield, Kidsgrove, Longport, Lye, Parton, Perry Barr, Prestbury, Reddish North and many many more.\n\nA more interesting one is stations with substantial lengths no longer used, the Cumbrian coast has several stations fitting that.\n\nAsh is 4 cars on the down (towards Aldershot/Reading) and 8 cars on the up (towards Guildford). No idea why - most other stops on the North Downs Line have relatively short platforms and have traditionally always been served by single multiple units. Some posters have commented about stations having longer platforms in one direction to avoid longer trains blocking a level crossing - that isn’t the case here as the level crossing is at the Guildford end of the station. I can only assume it may date back to when what is now industrial units was once a yard, so access to that preventing platform extension, though that still doesn’t explain the other platform’s extension on a line that’s never really seen long trains stopping.\n\nFarncombe I believe this is 12 on the up (London-bound) and less on the down (Portsmouth-bound). Used to be 8 car pre-ASDO, not sure if its accommodation is more now. The reason for platform 1’s additional length in this case probably was to allow full length trains to clear the country-end level crossing when stopping.\n\nCorrect me if I’m wrong but I think there’s a difference in the two platform lengths at Haddiscoe on the Wherry Lines. The platform for trains to Norwich is shorter I think anyway.\n\nYou may well be right. Railway Track Diagrams (Eastern) - Fourth Edition (2016) has Haddiscoe with a 4 car length platform on Platform 2 (towards Lowestoft) but only 2 car length on Platform 1 (towards Norwich).\n\nYou may well be right.
