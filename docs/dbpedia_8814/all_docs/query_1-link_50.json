        "text": "This is the article I found on the Network Rail website which indicates number of trains per hour through Oulton Broad North at peak times:\n\nhttps://www.networkrailmediacentre.co.uk/news/waiting-times-at-oulton-broad-north-level-crossing-to-be-improved\n\nThe article is from 2015 and there are further pieces reporting the signalling changes took place in 2016, what if any difference the changes actually made to traffic flow. I cant say ive noticed any.\n\nI must live a good mile away from Oulton Broad North Station however the Ipswich track passes within a 1/4 of a mile of my house and even at this distance I can fully relate to the incredibly noisey locos sometimes used on the line and why they predominantly seem to use the noisey ones late on is beyond me.\n\nI dont think being interesting makes it acceptable either. Certainly in this area the trains not only cause inconvenience in terms of traffic delays but in my opinion negatively affect the wider local economy.\n\nWhat irks me more than anything is all this nonsense that journey times on trains must be reduced. What difference would the extra 5 to 10 minutes on a Lowestoft to Norwich journey actually make to the few people using the trains compared with the 100's if not 1000's of road users inconvenienced by it every day.\n\nSlowing the trains down may not only improve crossing safety across the country but could also reduce the time level crossings such as Oulton Broad North need to be closed.\n\nThis frantic obsession with constantly shortening journey times be it train bus or air travel is unnecessary and has negative consequences in other areas that never seem considered!!\n\nWell, in true NBN fashion this has moved off topic to modern day rail travel and costs :)\n\nAs a regular rail user, one thing that has struck me - universally regardless of rail company - is new trains are not as comfortable as older trains and also not as well looked after (internally) as of old.\n\nI guess once upon a time it was a case of having to make do - keep things going, and where that still applies so you tend to find things a bit better. More and more though why bother to invest because if you loose the Franchise (likely) the next operating company will bring in their own fleet livery, change everything again or even go buy new stock even if an existing order and delivery of updated stock by the previous operating company is not finished.\n\nPrior to their minor refurbishment, the mainline stock from London to Norwich were always clean and the seats comfy. Compare that to Cross Country rail services - worn our seats, dirty coach roofs, windows and floors and there you may have to endure such for hundreds of miles on a journey from the likes of Stansted Airport to Birmingham on what once we would have called a 'rail car'.\n\nI don't think there has really ever been a fully thought out, working model to get people integrated between transport services and truly out of their cars. The fact is the rail network is really very popular - either through necessity or natural population growth I know not, but what is clear is while politicians have banged on about using the train for decades, now more and more people are but the trains and actual rail capacity is really under strain with so little in the system to give when things go wrong.\n\nI don't really care about if I get to Norwich in 90 minutes of 140 minutes - but make it easy, clean and reasonably priced and I am happy.\n\nThese days through modern phones and Apps you can buy your tickets on the go - no waiting at a ticket office or in line for machines to try and get their frustrating screens to work and fathom the options (all of which change depending on operating company). Then you've got an App to see what platform the train you are due to get is going to depart from, so you need not stand getting a stiff neck looking at the screens but take the extra time to go grab a coffee.\n\nIs that progress? I guess so. But the fact is once upon a time British Rail had to run trains - and somehow try and make money, but running trains was first and foremost what they had to do. Now rail operating companies (in my opinion) are required to run the trains but this seems really rather annoying and gets in the way of making money - and as for the customers oh they can complain and cause all types of problems for the process of making money.\n\nSo, I miss the old Intercity routes, the times when you could get a proper at table meal cooked in the Buffet on a train to Edinburgh and when there was joined up thinking - from typefaces on signs, to uniforms the staff wore to ticketing - no, I am not harking back to the golden age of steam, just the 1990's...."
