        "text": "Significant stones:\n\nApart from those with legendary tales attached to them, there are various other rocks scattered about East Anglia, relics of the last Ice Age, that may once have been significant in some way. Because most of the region has no visible native stone, people dragged these 'glacial erratic' boulders from where they were found and set them in positions that they felt important - some say they were used as markers on ancient tracks, or on boundaries, or perhaps they were used as meeting-places, or even as sacred pagan objects that formed the core of later Christian sites.\n\nPersonally, I tend to think most were just used to protect the corners of buildings against traffic, to mark property boundaries, to act as mounting blocks, to be extra building material, or just to provide a local talking point! Whatever they were, below is a selection that I have record of in this region.\n\n~\n\nYou can also go to the Stone Index - a complete list of just about every odd stone that I know about. It includes not only those featured on this webpage and those with legendary tales, but others that I've read or been told about, or have found myself.\n\n~\n\nAlphamstone, Essex: If there werent so many sarsen boulders laying around the village  on verges, under hedgerows, in gardens etc  those in and around the church of St. Barnabas (TL878354) would be more remarkable than they are. One count makes it nine in the churchyard, with another two protruding from the fabric inside the church itself.1 Two more are embedded beside the path leading up to the raised platform upon which the building sits. A Bronze Age urn cemetery has been found in and next to the churchyard, and a Roman villa complex just to the south  but there seems no evidence for the idea that the church sits on a burial mound.2 The notion that the boulders form the remnants of a stone circle is even more unlikely.3\n\nSources:\n\n1. http://www.megalithia.com/places/alphamstone/\n\n2. http://ansellsfarm.co.uk/history/alphamstone-church/\n\n3. https://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=381601\n\nArrington, Cambs: The current church of St. Nicholas (TL325503) is basically of the 13th century, but there was probably a wooden building on the site before the Norman Conquest. This was possibly borne out in 1999, when emergency excavations were carried out due to structural cracking, and traces of burning were found beneath the remains of the medieval floor. Also discovered at this time was a \"massive\" boulder of ironstone, buried beneath the east wall. Such a rock would be unnecessary for the underpinning of a wooden church, so its placement there is intriguing.\n\nSources:\n\nArrington Parish Council: 'Parish Plan Steering Group-Final Report' (2005), p.15.\n\n'St. Nicholas, Arrington - Statement of Significance' Part 1, p.4.\n\nBacton, Suffolk: A large boulder once lay here in a ditch by the roadside \"near the entry gate that divides Haughley and Bacton\". This would seem to be where the parish boundary crosses the road, which is called 'Boys Entry' on old maps (about TL035652). The stone was said to be 6 feet x 6 feet x 4 feet (1.8m x 1.8m x 1.2m), but I've scoured the area and can find no trace of it.\n\nSource: 'The East Anglian Miscellany' (1911-12), Note 3403.\n\nBardfield Saling, Essex: There is a large sandstone rock buried in the grass just outside the entrance to the churchyard at St. Peter and St. Pauls (TL686265).1 Plus a corner buttress of the nave of the church is built upon another very large boulder.2\n\nSources:\n\n1. https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MEX4434&resourceID=1001\n\n2. https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MEX4427&resourceID=1001\n\nBarking, Suffolk: An old charter giving a perambulation of the bounds of the manor of Barking with Needham Market follows a route \"...to a place called Deadmans-stone, and from the said Deadmans-stone to a Wood called Ditcheywood...\" This seems to be the same stone mentioned to me by John G. Williams as being at TM082519, on the parish boundary beside Ditch Wood, near Tarston Hall, and may well be the same boulder seen here.\n\nBarnham Broom, Norfolk: Although now marked on maps as Skipping Block Corner, the 'Skipping Block' which once stood at this crossroads (TG074053) on the old boundary between Barnham Broom and Kimberley no longer exists. Local people say that there was once a large stone here, with steps cut into it for use as a mounting block.\n\nSource: W. A. Dutt: 'The Ancient Mark-Stones of East Anglia' (Flood & Sons, 1926), pp.23-4.\n\nBeachamwell, Norfolk: The Cowell Stone, a glacial erratic boulder, is to be found on the grassy verge of a track called Salter's Way just north of the A1122 Swaffham to Downham Market road, at the approximate junction of the Roman Fen Causeway extension and the supposedly prehistoric Icknield Way (TF767095).1 Once marking both parish and Hundred boundaries, it's been thought to be a way-marker, a boundary stone, or even a Roman milestone.2 This rounded rock, when I first saw it in the 1970's, only had about 25cm showing above ground, then with an Ordnance Survey benchmark on it, and a brass bolt driven into the top. In the 1980's it was unearthed, and moved a few metres along and further back from the track. I visited again in July 2015, and the stone now visible is 1m x 89cm x 60cm high, set on a bed of stones, and not in its original orientation. Rubbish is accumulating behind it. A weathered iron plaque is attached, stating it to be a waymarker from the Bronze Age. The name may derive from Cow Hill, supposedly an old name for the area where it stands. Dr. Ernest Rudge proclaimed this boulder to be a part of his 'Puddingstone Track',3 even though it's Spilsby sandstone, not a conglomerate of any kind.\n\nSources:\n\n1. W. G. Clarke: 'In Breckland Wilds' (Robert Scott, 1925), p.121.\n\n2. Bruce Robinson & Edwin J. Rose: 'Norfolk Origins 2: Roads & Tracks' (Poppyland Publishing, 1983), p.19.\n\n3. E. A. & E. L. Rudge 'The Conglomerate Track' in 'Essex Naturalist' Vol.29 (1952), p.31.\n\nBeccles, Suffolk: Descend the left-hand set of steps from St. Michael's churchyard down into the road called Puddingmoor, and turn left for about 30 metres. A steep grassy bank (The Cliff) rises upon your left, and on the crest of this stands a large, pitted slab of grey rock, deeply embedded into the ground (TM421904). The stone is 1.4m long, 76cm high, and only 23cm broad, and the long axis is set exactly north-south. A local woman suggested to me that the stone marks the site of a mill, but that's unlikely. It now overlooks the river Waveney, which was once an inland arm of the sea. W. A. Dutt reckoned that this stone was the original sacred site of Beccles, and determined where the town was built.1\n\nR. C. Dunt, writing in 1931, said that \"Generations of increasingly-civilised boys and girls have encircled this stone, sat on it, jumped off it, chipped at it, but failed to dislodge it or even to remove...the glacial markings of an ice age; nor have they...concerned themselves much with such questions as these: Is it a relic of pagan rites, an isolated remnant of an old watch-tower, a rough block of building stone brought down by river barges long ago, and was it placed there or elsewhere as a 'Mark Stone' of an 'Old Track'?\"2 On the left is how the stone looked when I photographed it in the 1970s. In 2010 it looked like this.\n\nSources:\n\n1. W.A.Dutt: 'Ancient Mark-Stones of East Anglia' (1926), p.12.\n\n2. 'Norwich Mercury', 18/4/1931.\n\nBeccles, Suffolk: Again in Beccles, a few feet from the river bank at the bottom of a garden in the street called Northgate, lies a large granite boulder known to the owners when I was there in the 1970's as the Barsham Trysting Stone (TM422907). This is of a roughly 'mushroom' shape, with a circular top, 1.4m across and 61cm high. It originally stood at TM395895, near a pond in Rectory Paddock, in the village of Barsham. The story related to me by the owners is that, in the 1930s, a certain Doctor Worthington made a bet with the rector that, if he could move the stone, he would roll it to Beccles, 2 miles east, and use it in his rock garden.\n\nBut a surviving daughter of the then Barsham rector, Canon Baron Suckling, tells me that her father gave it to a Dr. Woodhill of Beccles \"during the late 1920s\".1 She had always assumed it to have been a mounting-block. The name of the stone could be a more recent addition, since none of the locals who remember it ever knew it by any name. One writes: \"...we local lads used to sharpen our pocket-knives on it; it was always a resting-place for the children, and I can remember during the summer months having lessons on and around this stone\".2\n\nThis informant also voiced the opinion of several other villagers that the stone should never have been removed, and should now be returned to them. William Fowler, writing in 1947, mentioned this stone as \"a very fine one\", adding that \"it was lying embedded at the crossways leading from an old track at Barsham Hall, close to a circular pond among a few fir trees. In the unskillful removal that followed it was considerably damaged, but sufficient remains to show its original size and shape\".3\n\nSources:\n\n1. Information from Mrs. M. Eggington of New Barnet.\n\n2. Information from Benjamin Sayer of Barsham.\n\n3. The 'Eastern Daily Press', 4/11/1947.\n\nBeccles, Suffolk: In a garden directly across Northgate from the Barsham Trysting Stone above is another granite rock, this one 1m x 60cm x 60cm high (TM421907). Back when I saw it in the late 1970s, it was reported to be in danger from Water Board diggings. Although some call it the Brampton Stone (after the village 5 miles south of Beccles), I haven't been able to find anything about it. The garden belongs to Staithe House, former home of Dr. Woodhill from the Trysting Stone story, but whether he was also responsible for moving this stone here, I can't say. More recently, I've found that another boulder was given to Dr. Woodhill by a man named Samuel Banns, but this one came from a field at Burgh St. Peter, across the river in Norfolk. Yet another rock is also supposed to be here, referred to in the 1930s as Redisham Stone.\n\nBoxted, Essex: A sarsen stone approximately 1.2m x 45cm juts from the wall at the south-west corner of St. Peter's church (TL998332), with other fragments in the foundations. The church tower is also extensively faced with rocks of dark brown ferricrete.\n\nSource: Terry Johnson: Hidden Heritage: Discovering Ancient Essex (Capall Bann Publishing, 1996), p.73.\n\nBraintree, Essex: A sarsen stone is embedded in the ground right next to the western wall of St. Michaels church (TL756229). Its positioned rather oddly, as it seems to be right next to the foundations, but not a part of them.\n\nSource: http://sulismanoeuvre.blogspot.co.uk/2011/12/braintree-sarcens.html\n\nBramford, Suffolk: A huge, flattish glacial boulder can be seen within St. Mary's church, built into the foundations of a pillar in the nave (TM127463)1. This is a sarsen, the visible portion measuring 1.75m x 75cm x 25 cm high.\n\nThere are also two glacial rocks in the exterior of the north wall, measuring 70cm x 52cm and 64cm x 47cm.\n\nTwo more are embedded in the churchyard near the west end of the building. The angular one is 68cm x 48cm x 21cm high, while the more rounded one is 66cm x 45cm x 10cm high.\n\nAnother very large, rectangular, glacial erratic in Bramford can be found in - and supposedly gave its name to - Gippingstone Road. Measuring 1.35m x 96cm x 50cm high, it stands in the angle of a fence outside Cherryfields Sheltered Housing (TM122464).2\n\nSources:\n\n1.

On grass verges outside the lych gate are two smallish sarsen stones, but the significant rock here is a ferricrete boulder built into the exterior south wall of the church, protruding out in a very odd position about 20cm above ground level. There are apparently two smaller ferricrete stones built into the church, and another larger one (though not protruding) near the porch, at the base of the tower.\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://www.geoessex.org.uk/chelmsford/\n\nhttp://www.stmarybroomfield.org/history/\n\nKen Searles: 'Broomfield.

Although probably just a glacial erratic, it was said to be \"massive\", and its presence described by archaeologists as \"intriguing\". The discovery seems remarkably similar to that noted below at Takeley in Essex.\n\nSource: Scott Kenney & Alice Lyons: \"An Iron Age banjo enclosure and contemporary settlement at Caldecote, Cambridgeshire\" in 'Proceedings of the Cambridge Antiquarian Society', Vol. 100 (2011), p.70.\n\nCarlton Colville, Suffolk: In this suburb of Lowestoft, a small stream known as the Running Waters (or Kirkley Brook) is bridged on its way from the source in the village to the marshy ground by Lowestoft harbour. This site (on the 1799 Award Map, named as Blacksmith's Heath), is said to have once been a ford on a track that led up to the ancient encampments and burial mound (now long gone) on Bloodmoor Hill. Roughly at this spot (approx. TM524905) stood a large stone 'way-mark' at the crossroads, now a roundabout. It was supposed to have been buried nearby in 1925 for road-widening purposes, but a local author wrote in 1953 as if it was still visible then.\n\nSources:\n\nW. A. Dutt: 'Ancient Mark-Stones of East Anglia' (1926), p.8.\n\nRev. B. P. W. Stather Hunt: 'Flinten History' (Lion Press, 1953), p.13.\n\nCawston, Norfolk:\n\nGlacial boulders known as 'bluestones' were commonly found in this area, as evidenced by the names Bluestone Plantation and the former Bluestone railway station. Two such rocks can still be found today, one just inside the entrance to Church Farm (TG133239), the other by the path to the south porch of the church.\n\nThat at the farm is a considerable rock, over a metre long x 60cm x 60cm high, while that at the church is a much smaller stone, barely embedded, measuring only 36cm x 35cm x 15cm high.\n\nSource: http://cawstonheritage.co.uk/collections/show/1\n\nChadwell St. Mary, Essex: Back in 1912, a \"large sarsen\" was noted in the churchyard here (TQ646785). A hollow in the surface contained the letters NG and the numbers 1691, \"concerning which fantastic theories were current.\" However, this was found to refer to the death in that year of the churchwarden Nathaniel Glascock - it was a natural rock used as a gravestone, rather than some esoteric monument from prehistory.1 By 1920 there were two sarsens recorded here, one with a mammilated surface.2 But in 2003 only one \"sarsen fragment\" was visible, 100cm x 50cm x 35cm\".3\n\nSources:\n\n1.

Embedded in the grassy triangle in the middle of the junction used to be a small glacial boulder, roughly conical in shape. By itself, this was nothing more than another erratic, of little significance. However, just a few metres away on another grassy verge is a landmark known as the Hundred-stone. Looking rather like an old milestone, this three-sided object may date from the 18th century, and once had visible on it the words \"This marks the bounds of three Hundreds and three towns.\" The hundreds that met here were Babergh, Thedwastre and Cosford, while the 'towns' whose parish boundaries still meet at this point are Cockfield, Felsham and Thorpe Morieux. As the geographical unit known as the hundred dates from Saxon times, I can't help but wonder if the little boulder wasn't the original 'hundred-stone' here. The boulder was visible on Google Street View in 2009, but it had gone by 2011.\n\nSources:\n\nChurchill Babington: 'Materials for a History of Cockfield, Suffolk', in 'Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology' (1880), p.18.\n\n'Suffolk Fair' (Vol.1, No.8 Dec. 1971) p.19-26.\n\nColne Engaine, Essex: Although the parish boundary crosses the A1124 about 50m away, the substantial glacial erratic block on the wide grass verge outside Parley Beams Farm at TL837291 has been described as a boundary stone. (HERE on Street View.) A second stone was noted there in the past.1\n\nSarsen blocks, as well as pieces of puddingstone and Roman material, are incorporated into the lower courses of the tower at St. Andrew's church (TL850303).2\n\nSources:\n\n1. https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MEX1032916&resourceID=1001\n\n2. http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1342059\n\nColtishall, Norfolk: An object in the churchyard of St. John's (TG271197) used to be described as the possible base of a medieval stone cross - but it has since been identified as a glacial erratic. It can be found just inside the churchyard wall, near to the porch on the north side. Measuring 88cm x 76cm x 38cm high, it's very regular in form, so I can see how the misidentification occurred, but it doesn't look like it has actually been worked.\n\nSource: http://www.heritage.norfolk.gov.uk/record-details?MNF4767\n\nCongham, Norfolk: The Trunch Stone appears on a late 16th century map of Congham parish, and is mentioned also in a document from 1732. The boundary between Congham and Castle Rising is described as proceeding \"Thence along the said Road to Short Trees down the Old Bank or Dike dividing Goos Moor from Congham Warren to a Dole at the bottom of Congham Severalls. Thence East to Trunch Stone\".1 This would perhaps place it at about TF698249, where the boundary meets the road heading north from the A148 towards West Newton. A local who has followed the boundary says that the spot is currently overgrown and no stone could be found, but there is a glacial erratic not far away closer to the river.2\n\nSources:\n\n1. Nicola Whyte: 'Inhabiting the Landscape' (Kindle edition, 2008).\n\n2. http://www.castle-rising-history.co.uk/Parish%20boundary%20Description%201732.pdf\n\nCorton, Suffolk: A tiny hamlet called Newton Cross used to exist between Corton and Hopton on the east coast, but was swallowed up by the sea around the 14th century. In 1826, two stones were recorded here: \"Note, that in the Prambulacon-way dividing Corton and Gorleston, stands a White Stone, anciently called John-a-Lane's Crosse; and at the west end of the sayd Prambulacon-way stands another stone where Corton, Hopton and Gorleston meet\". It seems likely, however, that these were remnants of medieval wayside crosses rather than erratic boulders.\n\nCroxton, Norfolk: In the Park here is said to stand a large glacial boulder marking the parish boundary, in a gap in an earthen boundary bank which is also part of the Icknield Way (approx. TL860880).\n\nDrymere, Norfolk: At TF78240635 lies a sandstone block 92cm x 62cm x 53cm high, beside Beachamwell Road, south-west of Swaffham. It was moved, possibly in the 1970s, from Forestry Commission land to the north, at about TF791070, and though clearly glacial, some like to say that it was once part of a meteorite. When I first saw it many years ago it was on end, lightly embedded, but nowadays it's on its side, just resting on the surface.\n\nSources:\n\nInformation from Ben Ripper of Swaffham.\n\nShirley Toulson: 'East Anglia; Walking the Ley Lines & Ancient Tracks' (Wildwood House, 1979), p.86.\n\nDunton, Norfolk: The 'Longfield Stone' rests (or rested) on Gallow Hill near the village of Dunton, and was the scene, in 1561 and 1568, of the Court for the Gallow Hundred.\n\nSource: W.A.Dutt: 'Ancient Mark-Stones of East Anglia' (1926), p.17.\n\nEast Mersea, Essex: In 1975, with much local pomp and ceremony, a smallish ovoid boulder was erected beside East Mersea Road, just where the boundary between East and West Mersea crosses the road (TM036142). A plaque attached to it proclaimed Deremys Stone. Boundary of the manor of West Mersea granted by King Edward the Confessor to the Monastery of St. Ouen in AD1046. This glacial erratic, found in a ditch nearby, was believed to be the very boundary stone mentioned in an 11th century charter; but even at the time of the ceremony, doubts were raised.1 Those doubts have indeed since been proven well-founded. An 18th century rendering of the charter turned out to be badly translated, assigning the non-existent personal name Deremy or Deramy to a number of supposed locations  including a real boundary stone which would have been several miles away on the mainland, at about TM007188.2\n\nSources:\n\n1. merseamuseum.org.uk - deramy stone\n\n2. http://keithbriggs.info/deramy.html\n\nEastwood, Essex: At the church of St. Laurence & All Saints (TQ861888), a 65cm long sarsen stone actually bursts through the floor between the pews.\n\nSource: www.essexfieldclub.org.uk/St Lawrence Church, Eastwood\n\nFairstead, Essex: Rudge once claimed a puddingstone at the base of the tower at St. Mary's church (TL768167) to be a 'pagan' stone, and part of his imagined prehistoric track.

(See HERE on Street View.) To me, this is clearly shaped, and too small to have been anything but a 17th or 18th century milestone. However, I think there has been a mix-up with a completely different stone that indeed was once at the Swan, until the early part of the 20th century, and which has its own entry in the main Gazetteer under Felsted.\n\nSources:\n\n1.

T his is mentioned in the church guide of 1984, which doesn't note a second similar rock about 60cm from the ground in the south wall of the tower. This one is 45 x 23cm high. The guide also says there are two similar stones on a nearby farm. It's possible that one of them is the 1.3m high sarsen at Rams Farm, beside a gate at the roadside. This was moved from the farmyard to its present position in the 1960s, and was claimed by Ernest Rudge as one of his 'Puddingstone Track' boulders, but there's not a trace of a pebble in it at all.\n\nFoulsham, Norfolk: A stone in the bottom of a ditch at TG021258, just east of Littlemore Farm, is said to mark where the old ecclesiastical parish boundaries of Foulsham, Twyford and Guist once met.\n\nSource: Letter 'Ancient Mark Stones' in the 'Eastern Daily Press', 16/9/1925.\n\nFyfield, Essex: At the church of St. Nicholas (TL572067), a large sarsen stone is alleged to underpin each corner of the tower. However, when I visited I could only find one, near the foot of a buttress at the north east corner of the church. It's hard to tell if it actually continues beneath the buttress, and the tower itself is enclosed within the centre of the building. The others may now be buried in the soil.\n\nSource: www.essexfieldclub.org.uk/Fyfield sarsen stone\n\nGorleston, Norfolk: In 1926, W. A. Dutt wrote that \"In Church Lane, Gorleston, near by the church, there is a large granite boulder\".1 This was in the context of ancient stones that might mark a pre-Christian sacred site. I went looking for this stone in the early 1970's and instead found two - though neither could hardly be termed 'large boulders'. One, roughly 60cm x 45cm x 20cm high, is set into the ground close to the wall just outside the Church Lane entrance to St. Andrew's churchyard. The second is slightly larger, but of a more regular, ovoid shape, set into the pavement at the foot of a telephone pole, about 20 metres further along Church Lane.\n\nMore recently I've found a record in the Gt. Yarmouth Borough Archives dating from 1922, entitled 'Church Lane, Gorleston, Re-siting of Standing Stone'. This would appear to be a third stone, about 40 metres west of the first one, not far from the junction of Church Lane with Church Road. The record is unfortunately just a surveyor's plan, showing the position of the stone before and after re-siting. The length is shown as 3 feet (1.09 metres), while the widest point looks to be about 65cm. No indication of height is given, but this would seem a far more substantial object than the other two, and could justify being termed both 'boulder' and 'standing stone'.\n\nBy the looks of it, the outer face of this stone was right at the edge of the roadway, about 2 metres from the churchyard wall, and was turned slightly and moved about a metre closer to the wall. There seems also to be a portion of a fourth stone sticking out from the base of the wall itself. These rocks are certainly not there now, and weren't when I visited in the 1970's. The nearby road junction has been changed at some point from a triangular traffic island to a large oval roundabout, and I suspect that the road, pavement and churchyard wall were remodeled at the same time, obliterating all traces of this 'standing stone'. I've tried investigating further, but there seem to be no more existing records of this stone.\n\nSource: 1.W.A.Dutt: 'Ancient Mark-Stones of East Anglia' (1926), p.13.\n\nGreat Bardfield, Essex: At St. Marys church (TL678303), a big sarsen stone and a sandstone block jut out from beneath the corners of the chancel, where they support the east buttress.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MEX5451&resourceID=1001\n\nGerald Lucy: 'Essex Boulders: A Gazetteer', in 'Essex Naturalist' (New Series, No. 20, 2003), p.121.\n\nGreat Hockham,Norfolk: The huge sandstone boulder on the village green here (TL95329255) was actually found in a pit about ¾ of a mile away, and moved to its present site around 1880.

On a grassy triangle outside the former Chapel Mill, near to the boundary with Beetley, stands a glacial erratic (TF978168), about which has grown the local belief that it marks the very centre of Norfolk - but, this tale hasn't been traced further back than the 20th century. As the occupier of the Mill House in the 1890's was an antiquarian collector, it's thought possible that he acquired the boulder after it was dug up locally, and moved it to his land. However, I find that the stone appears on the 1st edition of the Ordnance Survey 6 inch to the mile map, and that was surveyed between 1879 and 1886.

At the time of Domesday Book, four manors here were simply called Inga, but later needed to be differentiated, the manor containing the church being Latinised in 1254 as Ginges ad Petram. The existence of a large sandstone boulder in the churchyard of St. Edmund & St. Mary (TQ651996) probably accounts for the petram part of the name, although some have previously theorised that it referred to some lost Roman milestone on the long straight Roman road that runs through the village. The churchyard stone was originally found in 1905 under the north-east chancel of the church, during building work.\n\nTwo more large sandstone boulders (one, in recent times, hit by a lorry, but re-placed in position) at the entrance to Fryerning Lane nearby, (HERE on Street View) and several more small rocks along the High Street, have led some recently to propose that perhaps all the stones were once part of one larger boulder, or less likely, that they are the remains of a stone circle.\n\nSources:\n\nwww.essexfieldclub.org.uk/Ingatestone boulders\n\nhttp://heritageaction.wordpress.com/2010/04/30/stones-in-the-road%E2%80%A6-like-diamonds-in-the-dust/\n\nhttp://everyday-scientist.blogspot.com/2006/06/june-18-2006.html\n\nLaindon, Essex: Rudge notes a sarsen stone at the south-west buttress of the former St. Mary's church at Dunton Wayletts (TQ653883).\n\nSource: E.

It's not a 'boulder' though, it's merely a 60 x 25cm ovoid lump of dark brown pebbly ferricrete laid flat into the wall surface; and it's not even the largest of many pieces built into the walls in decorative bands, especially on the south side. The church guide is wrong about this material: it calls it both septaria and mudstone, but the two are different stones, and neither are ferricrete.\n\nSources:\n\n1. E. A.

He thought this to be an \"old sacrificial stone\" that had been 'reconsecrated' in Christian times by having a wooden cross-shaft mortised into its upper surface. A simple cross still stands at the centre of this junction, (TL73089467, see here on Street View) but the stone disappeared long ago. However, the vicar's own drawing of this object shows it to have been not some ancient erratic boulder, but a very standard medieval base for a wayside cross, complete with moulded stop-angles.\n\nSource: John Denny Gedge: 'The History of a Village Community in the Eastern Counties' (A.

In 1934, during excavations to make the heating chamber, it took workmen three days to chisel off a small corner of the stone to admit a furnace, and at the same time they came across human bones, 'far from any known grave'.

It measures 110cm x 94cm x 57cm high. A smaller stone, a sarsen - 82cm x 70cm x 48cm high - sits close to it. However, the HER seems to confuse this larger boulder with something called the Pleshey Stone,1 or what the Essex Chronicle calls the Richard Stone.2 Previously on the village green, or set into a wall at Mount House, recent sources2,3 say this is actually a stone from Pleshey Castle, and is now on the wall inside Holy Trinity church.

This has possibly been moved from the crossroads leading to the marketplace from the north, where a covered market cross was erected in the 16th century, and removed to make way for the present Butter Cross. The local antiquarian Ben Ripper had the theory that, after the assassination of the Roman usurper Constantine in the 3rd century, the kin of the Swafas (the Swabians, his heathen mercenaries) arrived in the area and began to divide up the land. At Swaffham they placed the boulder - 'Swafa's Stone' - and so gave the town its name.

The sharp edges suggest human working, but investigation shows these to be natural fracture surfaces, caused during movement during the Ice Age.

There are said to be others close by near Wickham Hall. A wide low mound at the centre of the churchyard has been suggested as a possible ancient burial mound.2\n\nSources:\n\n1.

This angular rock measures 103cm x 81cm at its longest points, but only 17cm is visible above ground.\n\nSource: Edwin Rose: 'The Churches' in 'The Archaeology of Witton, near North Walsham' in 'East Anglian Archaeology' Report No.18 (Norfolk Museums Service, 1983), p.98.\n\nWormingford, Essex: Rudge records a sarsen boulder (1m long) beneath the south-west buttress of St. Andrews church (TL932322).\n\nSource: E.

W. A. Dutt said in 1926 that it had been removed to inside the church, but in the 1970's I found it to be still in its earlier position, just south-west of the massive round tower (TM084788). The rector at the time could give me no further information. In August 2016 I visited again, and this time found it mentioned in the church guide - but the author thinks the idea that it was a 'pagan' stone that determined the siting of the church is rather 'fanciful'. In my youth, I thought it might have been the broken shaft of a medieval cross, but I now find that highly unlikely."
