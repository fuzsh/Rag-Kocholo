        "text": "Haughley village is in Suffolk, two miles northwest of Stowmarket. The Norman castle at Haughley retains its motte (earthwork mound) and water filled moat. The fact that it had a castle suggests Haughley had an impressive past. Stowmarket itself has a long history, having been granted a market charter in 1347 (when presumably it gained the latter part of its name), but Haughley’s market was formally granted a charter over a hundred years before that, in the reign of Henry III. In fact it had possessed a market since Saxon times, before such charters were granted. In Tudor times Haughley was still the principal local town and Stowmarket was but an upstart, but a number of things conspired to reverse the position. Now Stowmarket is the major settlement in this area of rural Suffolk, and Haughley is but a village.\n\nHaughley Road railway station opened with the line from Ipswich to Bury St Edmunds in 1846. Haughley became a junction when the line to Norwich diverged from the Bury line after that line was opened in 1849. The station was moved at the same time, as the previous one only served the Bury Line.\n\nThe busiest time for Haughley Junction came in the first half of the twentieth century, when it became the starting point for the Mid Suffolk Light Railway. This line was opened in 1908 and was intended to join up with the East Suffolk line at Halesworth, where the Southwold Railway would be converted to standard gauge. This would have created a direct line from Bury St Edmunds to the coast. Alas it was all too late, and the time for building new lines was over; only the railway bridge over the river Blyth at Southwold was rebuilt to take standard gauge track, and the Mid Suffolk Light never carried passengers beyond the small village of Laxfield. Until 1912 the line continued to Cratfield but was used for goods only to Gorams mill. Unsurprisingly the Middy never made money. At the time of Grouping the railway owed nearly £90,000, and the LNER was reluctant to take it on. After negotiating a reduction with the debenture holders the railway struggled on until 1952. My sister used the Middy with my mother on the way to Debenham in the late 1940s. It was quite a walk from the nearest station on the Mid Suffolk Light to Debenham.\n\nThe Mid Suffolk had ambitions to run a branch to Debenham, and even began constructing this spur, including the only bridge on the railway. I sometimes wonder that if the unnecessary expense of such a major undertaking (i.e. the bridge) had been avoided the line might have made it to Halesworth. This would certainly have improved the financial side of things, though I doubt that even then it would have made a profit, and the end result would have closure just the same.\n\nThe line to Bury has been more permanent than the MSR, and remains a major route for both passengers to Burt St Edmunds and freight from Felixstowe to the midlands. This has however not protected the station at Haughley. The goods yard was close at the end of 1964 and the parcels service to the station was ended two years later. Although I remember nothing of the station, I must have stopped there when I rode the stopping train from Norwich to Ipswich in 1962. The passenger service ended in 1967 and the station has now completely disappeared, apart from the station master’s house. You have to be on the alert even to spot the junction of the railway. The main line to Norwich is electrified, but the line to Bury remains diesel only.\n\nAfter the demolition of Haughley station the junction itself was downgraded to single track. Why was this done? It obviously cost money to realign the track, and the rest of the line to Bury remains double track. Now this turnout creates a major bottleneck for the increasing number of freight trains from Felixstowe, and the junction needs urgently returning to its original format, at a cost if several millions of pounds. Yet another example of ‘rationalisation’ that had nothing rational about it!\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nTHE BLOG FOR MEMORIES OF EAST ANGLIAN LIFE\n\nRate this:\n\nWYMONDHAM is a town that has two railway station. The Network Rail Station was built by the Norwich and Brandon Railway and was opened in the summer of 1845. The other station is of relatively recent construction, to serve the tourists on the Heritage Line (the Mid-Norfolk Railway) that runs to there from Dereham. This is the second time the town has been served by two stations – there was briefly one in 1845 at Spinks Lane. If you go there today it is hard to believe such a remote place ever had anything there, let alone a railway station. The level crossing that carries Spinks Lane across the track is seldom used, and if you wish to cross you must open the single gate yourself.\n\nThe current Network Rail station on the main line used to be a busy junction. Besides the trains which still go to Norwich and Ely, in years gone by there were services to Kings Lynn, Wells-next-the-Sea and Forncett. These were the stations at the end of the line, but they stopped at many places in between. You could catch a train to Brandon, Thetford or Swaffham. These line to Lynn also connected directly with another route to Thetford via Watton at Swaffham. Dereham and all the important towns in the west of the county were all accessed via Wymondham. One of these lines is still used by the Heritage railway to Dereham, and on occasion visiting locos use the junction, but for the most part it is unused.\n\nThey didn’t hang about in the nineteenth century; the line only got Parliamentary approval in May 1844 and by August 1845 (just over a year later) the station at Wymondham was up and running. Compare that with the station at Cambridge North that took over ten years in the planning and building; and this wasn’t even on a new section of line let alone a whole new railway. I don’t understand why everything is so slow nowadays. We have lost our get up and go.\n\nA few years ago I took the train from Wymondham to Cambridge, and it was an acceptable place to get on. I had to cross the line on the footbridge which was rather slow in my disabled condition. On the return I went through to Norwich; it is no quicker to go to Wymondham from my home by car, and there is no footbridge to negotiate at Norwich – something that would not have occurred to me before I had a stroke. The most noticeable facility at Wymondham is the Station Bistro. This is well used, but almost none of the customers come there by train. It has two rooms for eating in, and one is kitted out like an old style railway carriage. The high backed railway seating gives an authentic feel, and the occasional passing of trains enhances this effect.\n\nIn 1923 working day at Wymondham got underway at 6.45, with the arrival of the train from Wells-next-the-Sea. This was on Mondays only and for the rest of the week the train arrived 20 minutes later. The procession of trains from the various locations kept the staff at Wymondham well occupied. The regularity of passenger trains was not quite as frequent as it is today; for example only about ten trains a day went to and from Cambridge on a normal weekday, but against that there were many more destinations. The line was kept very busy by the freight trains that passed through Wymondham, and many of them stopped there too, loading and unloading all kinds of goods. Coal was unloaded for the town and The Briton Brush factory was a major employer at Wymondham and had its own sidings in the town to take its products across the country.\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nTHE BLOG FOR MEMORIES OF EAST ANGLIAN LIFE\n\nRate this:\n\nThe two railway stations that had made Fakenham something of a minor transport hub had both closed to passengers by 1970. The first to go was the former M&GN station on the east/west line from Melton Constable to Kings Lynn, which closed in 1959. Five years later the line south to Wymondham, part of the Wells branch, was axed as well. It finally closed to goods trains in 1980. There are plans for the Mid Norfolk Railway to extend its operations to Fakenham, but that proposal is long into the future, if it ever happens at all. The MNR are buying up sections of the route as they become available – most recently the bridge 1715 at Fakenham. The Norfolk Orbital Railway has an even more ambitions plan to extended the line to meet the North Norfolk Railway at Holt, but this is pie in the sky as far as I am concerned.\n\nFakenham is where the A1067 from Norwich to Fakenham meets the A148 from Cromer to Lynn. The A1065 from Swaffham also terminates at Fakenham. The town is bypassed as befits such a busy road junction. As with all the bypassed towns in East Anglia, this has come about during my lifetime. At the period I am recalling in the following paragraph (the 1960s), none of these road improvements had been started. All traffic went right through the middle of the town.\n\nFakenham, Thursday October 5th 1973; we had tea early; it was hamburgers, sausages, onions and mushrooms – my favourite mixed grill. This was followed by apple sponge and custard. We had to get to the Corn Hall at Fakenham for 7.30 for a dog training match with the Fakenham club. Myrtle our instructor was in charge of our Long Stratton club. We filled the car up with 6 gallons of petrol at Austin’s garage in St Catherine’s Plain, Norwich. Dad and I got to Fakenham in good time, so we had a drink first. Fido was down as a pre-beginner on the list and was the second dog on the floor, after Penny, a local dog from North Norfolk.\n\nFido came 5th and Penny came 6th among the pre-beginners; Sally won this class and another Sally won the top class. Dad won a bottle of sherry in the raffle that followed the competition. Each dog got a tin of Chum and the owners all got a bag of apples. I think we did rather well!\n\nCox and Wyman (the printers) was still busy in 1973; there was a late shift, so they were still hard a work when we left the Corn Hall. The printing office occupied both sides of White Horse Street. The printing business in Fakenham closed in 1982, although it continues to operate in Berkshire. The premises were later demolished and redeveloped. We left at 10 p.m. and got home by 11; if this timing, to go from North Norfolk to South Norfolk through Norwich seems good going (on roads which were much more twisty in those days) you must remember that there were no speed camera then! When I began to drive in 1966, there was no maximum limit either. Only the rather creaky car held you back.\n\nI am recalling the Fakenham of 50 years ago; I have been there often enough with Molly my wife in the intervening years, but mostly we have not ventured beyond Morrison’s Supermarket on the outskirts. Recently however we watched our daughter competing in a cycle race, and that was in the centre of town.\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nFOR MEMORIES OF EAST ANGLIA\n\nRate this:\n\nIn the past there were three railway stations serving Great Yarmouth. The only one to remain open today was the first of these, then called Yarmouth Vauxhall. It was opened in 1844. Not only was this the first station to be built in Yarmouth, it was the first station in the whole of Norfolk. The line went west to Norwich via Reedham. Next came the line to the south, which went from Yarmouth Southtown. This station opened in 1859. The last to open was the line to the north, which went from Yarmouth Beach Station through Caister and North Walsham to Melton Constable. It opened in 1877. All these railways were especially busy in the summer months, bringing holidaymakers to the the attractions of the resort.\n\nThe line into Yarmouth terminated at Yarmouth Vauxhall, just to the west of the river Bure (near its confluence with the river Yare), but a bridge allowed freight trucks to be transported east across the river, past the town hall and beyond to the quayside. In the 1950s this was still a busy place, with specially adapted tram engines for use on the public highway; the bridge over the Bure remains, now used only for pedestrians; it is short cut to railway for those on foot. The fish traffic by Yarmouth Vauxhall Station was particularly heavy in the autumn. The site of the extensive goods sidings may still be seen. Also in the 50s and into the 60s many train loads of frozen peas were transported over these tracks from the Birdseye factory. .\n\nThe next station to open was Yarmouth Southtown, not far from Vauxhall but on the South side of the river Yare. There was no direct rail connection between Vauxhall and Southtown. The last station to arrive in Yarmouth was Beach Station; this was first established by a couple of tank engines which were driven through the streets from Yarmouth Vauxhall. Tracks had to laid and then taken up as these locos proceeded to the new station’s site on Nelson Road. From there the line of the railway was driven north. Eventually Yarmouth Beach station did have a connection with the line from Southtown, once the Breydon Bridge was built in the early years of the 20th century. This still did not provide a connection with Southtown station, as joined the line south to Beccles at Gorleston.\n\nAlong with most of the former M&GN, Yarmouth Beach station was closed completely in 1959, and became a coach park. The Breydon viaduct had already been abandoned in the early 1950s. Yarmouth Southtown was closed to freight in 1967 and to passengers in 1970. In just over a decade the railways in Yarmouth had been reduced to just one. The reason for the falling away of passengers was the love affair of the Great British public with the motor car. Yarmouth was still a popular destination (the rival attractions of Benidorm and the other Spanish resorts were still in their infancy), but now it was by coach and car the the visitors arrived.\n\nFrom Yarmouth Southown the line went to Gorleston Station and thence to Lowestoft. From Yarmouth Beach via the Breydon viaduct the line went to Beccles and on to Ipswich and eventually to London. Direct services from Yarmouth to London Liverpool Street left from Yarmouth Beach station until the Breydon viaduct was closed in 1953. Thereafter the London to Yarmouth trains went to Southtown. More recently summer Saturday trains have run direct from Liverpool Street to Great Yarmouth via Norwich. The train service to Great Yarmouth has not been very successful recently, with declining numbers for the last several years. I have a faint hope that following extensive upgrading work on the line through Berney Arms a direct service will be restored from Yarmouth to Lowestoft, and ultimately to London. The new dual powered trains (electro-diesels) will make this possible, and I am sure this would reverse the downward trend in passenger numbers.\n\nRate this:\n\nIt is only a village, if an important one (at least as far a the boats on the river are concerned) but there are two railway stations in Brundall. In having more than one station it is almost metropolitan! Cambridge now has two stations (soon to be three), with the recent opening of Cambridge North. Colchester has two stations, three if you include Hythe which is technically in Colchester, but such places are rare – much rarer than they used to be. Apart from those places that have a Heritage Line as well as a Network Rail station, like Wymondham and Wroxham, I can think of Oulton Broad and Cromer as the only other places in East Anglia that have two stations. (I have just remembered Ipswich that has Derby Road on the Felixstowe line as well as Ipswich Town.) It is the river holiday trade that accounts for the two stations in Brundall; Brundall Gardens was opened in 1924 as the holiday cruising industry was taking off. Between them the two stations have well over 100,000 passengers a year (2019 figures). It is about 5 miles east of Norwich and the journey takes 10 minutes, or 15 minutes if the train also stops at Brundall Gardens. It currently (2019) costs £3.80 one way, 20p less from Brundall Gardens.\n\nAlthough Brundall does not have ‘Junction’ in its title, this is the last station before the lines to Yarmouth diverges from the line to Lowestoft. Brundall was one of the first half-dozen places in Norfolk to get a railway station; it opened in 1844 along with the Yarmouth to Norwich line. Places in between included Reedham, Cantley and Buckenham – not forgetting the Berney Arms! This lonely pub (currently closed) on the river Yare is served by two trains in each direction per day – rising to five trains on summer weekends. The stops are by request only, and the fact that the pub is not open must have reduced the numbers using the station somewhat, although the empty building is still a popular destination for ramblers.\n\nIf the link to the Lowestoft line was ever reinstated the train service from Yarmouth to Lowestoft would make this line between Yarmouth and Reedham much busier. This would direct the railway track from Yarmouth eastwards at Reedham instead of its current direction westwards to Norwich. This linking line was removed in 1859 but the short route is still there. There was some talk of reintroducing this line a few years ago, but nothing came of it. However, now that many thousand of pounds and months of line closure have led to the improvement of the line we may hear more of this suggestion. The line that connects Brundall with Lowestoft via Reedham was opened in 1847, while the more direct route from Brundall to Yarmouth via Lingwood and Acle was opened in 1883; this established the railway system that still exists today, that has very fortunately escaped any station closures.\n\nThere are 15 car parking places at Brundall station, two of them reserved for blue badge holders; there is no charge for rail users to park. There is also storage for 10 bicycles. There are shelters on the up and down platforms. There is no staffing at the station, although the associated level crossing is still opened and closed manually, so a railway worker is on duty while trains are running. There is a bridge between the two station platforms, but step free access is available via the level crossing. The station is adjacent to a popular pub (The Yare) but the access to the station from the village is not good. The footpath along Station Road is intermittent, and the road is a busy one, leading to the boat businesses and holiday apartments along the riverside. At Brundall Gardens there are no car parking places and the road to that station also has no continuous footpath either, but being a dead end this is not so important. There are racks for 8 cycles at Brundall Gardens and there is a shelter on the up platform to Norwich, but neither station has many other facilities.\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nTHE BLOG FOR MEMORIES OF EAST ANGLIAN LIFE\n\nRate this:\n\nA NORFOLK VILLAGE ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO\n\nJohn Kybird was born in New Buckenham in 1861. From around that time members of the Kybird family moved to Thetford. There they worked for Burrell, the traction engine manufacturers, and that was where the afore mentioned John grew up. One of his relative was the late Basil Kybird, whose memories of Norfolk make up several pages of fascinating material, and will eventually be included in this Facebook blog. Unlike many of his brothers and cousins, John Kybird did not go into the engineering business, and before 1891 he was living in Cawston, where he was working as a carrier. Ten years before that, in the 1889s, there was already a railway station at Cawston, but there was obviously enough call for his horse-drawn conveyance to keep his services as a carrier in demand. However, early in the 20th century he found a change of direction advisable, and became the landlord of the Bell Inn, the 17th century hostelry that remains the pub in Cawston. (I can recommend it, having had many enjoyable lunches there.) John Kybird remained at the Bell for less than ten years, by which time he was wealthy enough to add farming to his portfolio of employments.\n\nJohn Gaff was living at Eastgate, CAWSTON in 1911. In the census of that year he was described as ‘Hawker and farmer, born 1863′. As you can see from this sixpenny trade token, hawker was indeed one of his occupations. What sort of things did he sell? Well we have no way of saying exactly the sort of things that he carried in his basket as he travelled round the vicinity, but we can have an idea. My grandfather Charles Rivett kept the village shop at Cawston at the time John Gaff was operating. This was the Post Office, general stores and a drapery – they also sold boots and shoes. Obviously there would have been no point in stocking anything that could be obtained locally at the village shop.\n\nThe Gaff family lived in Eastgate (an area of Cawston which also still has a pub). As a teenager John Gaff was a farm labourer like his father before him, but he was an enterprising young man and in his twenties he was already trading as a hawker. It must have been a good business, because not only was he successful enough to have these trade tokens minted, but by the time he was fifty he was a farmer himself, albeit in a minor capacity.\n\nThe village schoolmaster was Mr Chaffey. He was my mother’s first teacher, although not for long; by the time she was six the disruption of the First World War had sent her father to France in the Royal Flying Corps. The village shop was sold and the rest of the family moved to Wymondham. Besides my mother Joan there were three other children – Eric, Tony and Peggy. Peggy never lived in Cawston but others did. Peggy lived to be a hundred, and only died in 2019.\n\nAlthough you would never know it was once a shop, the Post Office building is still there, just across the road from the Bell. My mother was born over the shop, and when it was still open my sisters called there and were shown the room by the owners.\n\nRate this:\n\nIn 1960 this was the second station out from Norwich on the mainline to London, after the station at Flordon. Formerly it had been the third station, but the stop at Swainsthorpe had already been closed to passengers in 1954, although it remained open for goods until 1964.\n\nForncett station was opened in 1849 when the line from Ipswich to Norwich Victoria was completed; the railway had run out of money just short of the city, and needed the financial assistance from Norwich Union to reach its destination. This enabled it to build the viaduct over the river Yare and this viaduct also crossed the line to Cambridge. In 1881 the branch line from Wymondham (on the line to Cambridge) joined the Ipswich line at Fornett. From the time of the creation of a junction at Forncett it became a much busier station. Besides extra sidings a second signal box was constructed and a turntable built to enable locomotives to be turned there for their return to Wymondham. This line meant that a train could travel directly from Wells-next-the-Sea to London in just over four hours. This timing could hardly be bettered today, nearly 150 years later; it would now require going by road of course. Passenger trains no longer used the Wymondham to Forncett line after the outbreak of war in 1939, and in 1951 all traffic was withdrawn and the track was torn up for most of its length. Only a short stretch of track was left at the Wymondham end at Hethel, where Archie King had a scrap yard where he dismantled railway carriages.\n\nI stopped at Forncett in 1962 on a local train from Norwich to Ipswich. I was alone; it must have the first occasion on which I was trusted to make such a journey unaccompanied – I was just thirteen. I was off to visit my sister who was teaching in Ipswich. The train I was on was a stopping train, ad it did not take on many passengers at Forncett (if any) but it was still busy, as post bags, newspapers and milk churns had to be loaded on and off the brake van by the guard. This station was closed by Dr Beeching in 1966, along with all the stations between Norwich and Ipswich except for Diss and Stowmarket. This must have been done to make timetabling simpler on the expresses to London. It was certainly not on account of the small amount of traffic generated by these rural communities, because many stations remain open on other lines in Norfolk, stations that still have far fewer passenger journeys than Forncett had. Since the closure of these intermediate stops the station at Needham Market has been reopened and is well used with over 100,000 passenger journeys a year, but only by passengers on trains from Bury St Edmunds; no service north to Norwich call there.\n\nForncett was the station the residents of Long Stratton used to travel to London or Norwich. Long Stratton is a large village less than three miles from Forncett. Other stations in Norfolk on the mainline Diss that were closed in 1966 were Flordon, Tivetshall and Burston. This must have increased the passengers using Diss station, as the people who formerly would have got on the train at Forncett now had to drive to Diss to board the train there. There are now 326 parking spaces at Diss station, that cost £7.00 a day (£4.50 off-peak) Diss in the start/finishing place for 700,000 passenger journeys per year – all figures correct as of 2019. The station supports both a cafeteria and a ticket office; the local taxi firm is also based at the station. All trains used to stop at Diss, but with the much vaunted ‘Norwich in 90’ service (introduced in 2019) this can only be achieved by reducing the stops along the line, including that at Diss. Fortunately this only involve two extra off-peak trains in each direction per day, and Diss will still have a good service for the most part.\n\nNowadays you will certainly miss seeing the former site of Forncett station as you speed along the line to London; almost all hint of the station has vanished, and even if you were aware of what to look out for as the train rushes past in the glimpse of an eye, you would have to be very quick to spot anything at all.\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nFOR THE STORY OF EAST ANGLIA\n\nRate this:\n\nA BORDER RIVER\n\nThis river rises in Redgrave Marshes and runs west towards Thetford. It forms the county boundary from Redgrave, but before it reaches the town the boundary takes a big deviation onto the Suffolk side of the river. This enables Thetford to embrace both banks of the river. This arrangement was introduced in the nineteenth century when it was instituted by the Boundaries Commission following the Great Reform Act of 1832. In the 1611 map of Norfolk by John Speed the County Boundary sticks rigidly to the river. For nearly two hundred years the county boundary has been a mile or so south of Theford. To the west of the town it turns northwards along a woodland path and rejoins the Little Ouse river before it reaches Stanton Downham. Apart from Thetford the only other town that the Little Ouse passes is Brandon. Both Thetford and Brandon have railway stations on the Breckland Line. The station that serves Brandon is located in Norfolk although the town itself is in Suffolk.\n\nThe limit of navigation is now officially the bridge across the river in Stanton Downham, but the journey there is too precarious for the canal barges that can venture up to Brandon from the inland waterways network. Even the small narrowboats that will fit through the lock just downstream of Brandon, which will only accommodate the smaller narrowboats of less than 40 feet in length, would struggle to go any further. Years ago they went all the way to Thetford; a narrowboat is still moored by the quay there, giving the impression that this is still an inland port. A steamer used to run from Thetford to places on the river Great Ouse and even up the Cam to Cambridge. ‘Stanches’ (a primitive kind of lock) were used to hold up the water and provide enough depth for navigation, but the river now seems far too narrow and shallow for such vessels. Was the river more substantial years ago, or were people more adventurous then?\n\nThetford Priory was built from Barnack stone; Barnack was a quarry in Linconshire. This would have been transported there by river. The passage must have been difficult, with poles and oars pushing the little boats against the flow of the river, but it was a lot easier than bringing the blocks of stone overland. The state of the roads meant even light loads in slow moving ox-carts would frequently have been bogged down.\n\nAt Thetford the confluence of the rivers Thet and Little Ouse this mean that neither was a big enough waterway to be navigable by commercial craft. From Brandon the river Little Ouse gives access to the entire English canal system. You can go west from this river on the Norfolk/Suffolk border as far as Llangollen in North Wales, York to the north, Bristol to the south-west and the river Thames. The main waterways system is reached by the Middle Level, a long and high-sided drain which is extremely boring to navigate, and does not attract many tourists but it does make Norfolk part of this national network.\n\nContinuing downstream from Brandon you approach the Fens, and from the ‘Cut Off Channel’ you enter typical Fenland landscape, with high banks to the river which is often high above the surrounding land. For example the parish of Littleport has the lowest trig point in the whole of England – three feet below sea level! Beyond Lakenheath the river ceases to be the boundary between Norfolk and Suffolk and becomes the boundary between Norfolk and Cambridgeshire. On a nineteenth century map this southern bank of the Little Ouse is still part of Suffolk, a narrow band of the parish of Mendenhall coming between Norfolk and Cambridgeshire. The boundary has since been adjusted to do away with this tongue of land. The hamlet called Little Ouse is about two miles above the confluence with the Great Ouse. The smaller river flows into the larger one at a place called Brandon Creek (rather confusingly, as Brandon itself is ten miles away). There is a pub – the Ship- that has moorings alongside where you can call in for a pint (no worries about drink driving), and there is a long-term mooring place a little further up the river as well.\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nTHE BLOG FOR MEMORIES OF EAST ANGLIA\n\nRate this:\n\nNORWICH CITY STATION, closed to passengers in 1959.\n\nThere were many towns in Norfolk that once had multiple railway stations; Norwich and Yarmouth had three stations, and Kings Lynn, Thetford, Fakenham, North Walsham and Aylsham had two each. Cromer had four stations, although not all were open at the same time. To these places we could perhaps add Reepham, where the second station went by the name of Whitwell and Reepham. There are now five places that have two stations; in three cases one is a Network Rail station while the others belong to a Heritage Line. These three places are Sheringham on the NNR, and Wymondham on the MNR. Now both these Heritage Lines occasionally take trains from the national network, but this has only been possible recently in the case of the NNR, as the rail connection between the Network Rail station and the Heritage Line was removed when the BR station at Sheringham was established early in 1967. The third place that has two stations is Wroxham, where the second station is on the narrow gauge line to Aylsham. The only town in Norfolk that now has two stations use by Greater Anglia is Cromer, although there is talk of creating a second stop un Thetford, to serve a growing neighbourhood. In Cromer the additional station there is at Roughton Road, opened in 1985 to serve a new housing development. The other place is no more than a village – Brundall. There Brundall Gardens Halt was opened in 1924 to serve the burgeoning holiday industry on the Broads; Brundall is the principal centre for hire cruisers on the river Yare.\n\nThe three stations at Yarmouth were in order of construction Yarmouth Vauxhall, Yarmouth Southtown and Yarmouth Beach. Yarmouth Southtown was south of the river, and connected Gorleston with Lowestoft. From 1847, when Lowestoft got its train service, until 1859, when Southtown station was opened, the trains went through Berney Arms and diverted on the Norwich to Lowestoft line at Reedham. It has been suggested that this link could be reinstated, so that the train service between Yarmouth and Lowestoft could be restored. Yarmouth Vauxhall was the first station in Norfolk to be built, and was opened (together with the stations to Norwich via Reedham) in 1845. It is the only station in the town that remains today, although it has been renamed Great Yarmouth. The final line to arrive in Yarmouth was the M&GN to Beach Station. Unusually there was no direct connection between the stations in the town, although a temporary track was laid through the streets to enable two steam engines to be delivered from Vauxhall to Yarmouth Beach.\n\nThe GER and the M&GN stations had a connecting link at North Walsham and at Kings Lynn, but none at Fakenham, Aylsham or Norwich. Reepham had no connection between the two lines until 1960, by which time both stations there were closed. The other places with multiple stations were on the Great Eastern except for Cromer. Cromer Beach was opened by the M&GN in 1887. It was much more convenient for the town than the GER station, the aptly named Cromer High. This was at the top of a steep hill above the town. There was originally no connection between the two lines, but a loop was soon inserted; Cromer High was closed to passengers in 1954 and to goods six years later. The other Cromer station was on the line that linked Mundesley with Cromer. This was to serve the golf course and was named Cromer Links Halt.\n\nThetford had besides the main station another smaller station Thetford Bridge on the line to Bury St Edmunds. This line closed to passengers in June 1953 and to goods in 1960. Thetford Bridge station was introduced in the town so that trains could run from Swaffham to Bury without reversing at Thetford Town station. In 1875 a loop was built to make this possible and Thetford Bridge station was opened to provide access to Thetford. South Lynn was the M&GN railway at Kings Lynn. The connection between Lynn and Stamford Bridge was established in 1866 and so preceded the formation of the M&GN. Until 1886 the line terminated across the river Great Ouse at West Lynn Station, but after the bridge was built this station closed and South Lynn was opened. There was a link to the GER London mainline near South Lynn station and a shuttle service ran from Kings Lynn to South Lynn across the river Nar. This bridge is still there and until 1994 it was used by freight trains serving the South Lynn sugar beet works. South Lynn was a minor station compared to Kings Lynn, and never had its original wooden platforms replaced by more permanent structures. South Lynn closed to passengers in 1959, along with almost the entire M&GN (only the short stretch from Sheringham to Cromer still remains) but stayed open for another nine years to serve the stub of the line that ran as far as West Raynham to carry goods\n\nFinally I must mention Haddiscoe, which stands close to the river Waveney to the southern border of the county. It had a high level station on the Yarmouth to Beccles line, and Haddiscoe Low Level station on the Norwich to Lowestoft line. Haddiscoe Low Level remains open, as plain Haddiscoe. High Level station closed in 1959. Far from being a town it is a most desolate place to have any railway station, let alone two; Haddiscoe has 13,000 passengers last year, which is not a bad number considering it is two miles distant from the village, and that has a population of under 500. The village of St Olaves (jut across the Waveney) is closer to Haddiscoe station. The stations at Haddiscoe were connected by two short lines (running south from Yarmouth to Lowestoft and from Beccles to Norwich) that were used for goods traffic only; there was no passenger traffic between the two stations; anyone wanting to travel to or from Yarmouth had better ways to go.\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nTHE BLOG FOR THE STORY OF EAST ANGLIA\n\nRate this:\n\nThe travel network used to be better in Norfolk than it is today. I know that this is a controversial statement, now that we all have cars, but I am not claiming that travel was easier in the past; when most people had to walk everywhere it certainly wasn’t. I am talking specifically about the network. Obviously I could not catch the bus before the omnibus was invented, but the means of transport that were in existence in the past had a more intimate involvement with the county. It is a fact that the choice of places where you could board ship in Norfolk was far superior back in the day. Now you can get on the Wash Monster at Hunstanton for a half hour trip along the coast, or a ferry at Morston to see the seals, but since Norfolk line stopped running ferries from Great Yarmouth to Holland you cannot go abroad. Today you would have to go to Essex to catch the ferry from Harwich.\n\nConsider Margery Kempe, the great traveller of the 14th century. Six hundred years ago she travelled to Germany to visit her daughter, catching ship from Yarmouth. Now she would be able to catch a plane from Stansted; much easier, but for that she would have to to Essex. There is travel available from Norwich Airport, but in spite of its proud ‘International’ appellation it goes to very few international destinations. The ghostly Margery Kempe could not fly to Germany from Norwich. The transport available from any Norfolk seaport is just the short round trips I have already mentioned. Until about 150 years ago you could get on a boat at Wells, Blakeney or Cley, Yarmouth or Kings Lynn and travel to the continent; you could go to London any day of the week, and for those who lived near the coast this was the way to go. Journeys from inland places were more problematic. The stage coaches were far too expensive for ordinary people and uncomfortable, even for those who travelled inside; those who travelled on the roof had to brave the weather, as did the coachman. With frequent changes of horse at the posting inns you could go the 100 miles to London from Norwich in about 16 hours. That is long time to sit on a precarious place in the dark – the coach travelled through the night.\n\nThe ease of travel improved enormously when railways arrived. Although their prime purpose was to carry agricultural produce to the towns, the people of England were suddenly freed from a static existence. Suddenly a young woman from Norfolk, whose ancestors might never have gone further than Norwich, could go to Staffordshire for a job. The network of lines meant that hardly anyone was more than five miles from a station. The second half of the 19th century was the best time for the transport network in Norfolk; the seaports were still mainly intact and still provided travel abroad, and the train would take you to the most remote parts of this country. By the end of the century more and more people were learning to ride a bicycle, and that would take you anywhere in Norfolk; and before the advent of the motor car, safely too.\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nFOR THE HISTORY OF EAST ANGLIA\n\nRate this:"
