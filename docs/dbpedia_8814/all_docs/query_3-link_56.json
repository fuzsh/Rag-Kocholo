        "text": "A BORDER RIVER\n\nThis river rises in Redgrave Marshes and runs west towards Thetford. It forms the county boundary from Redgrave, but before it reaches the town the boundary takes a big deviation onto the Suffolk side of the river. This enables Thetford to embrace both banks of the river. This arrangement was introduced in the nineteenth century when it was instituted by the Boundaries Commission following the Great Reform Act of 1832. In the 1611 map of Norfolk by John Speed the County Boundary sticks rigidly to the river. For nearly two hundred years the county boundary has been a mile or so south of Theford. To the west of the town it turns northwards along a woodland path and rejoins the Little Ouse river before it reaches Stanton Downham. Apart from Thetford the only other town that the Little Ouse passes is Brandon. Both Thetford and Brandon have railway stations on the Breckland Line. The station that serves Brandon is located in Norfolk although the town itself is in Suffolk.\n\nThe limit of navigation is now officially the bridge across the river in Stanton Downham, but the journey there is too precarious for the canal barges that can venture up to Brandon from the inland waterways network. Even the small narrowboats that will fit through the lock just downstream of Brandon, which will only accommodate the smaller narrowboats of less than 40 feet in length, would struggle to go any further. Years ago they went all the way to Thetford; a narrowboat is still moored by the quay there, giving the impression that this is still an inland port. A steamer used to run from Thetford to places on the river Great Ouse and even up the Cam to Cambridge. ‘Stanches’ (a primitive kind of lock) were used to hold up the water and provide enough depth for navigation, but the river now seems far too narrow and shallow for such vessels. Was the river more substantial years ago, or were people more adventurous then?\n\nThetford Priory was built from Barnack stone; Barnack was a quarry in Linconshire. This would have been transported there by river. The passage must have been difficult, with poles and oars pushing the little boats against the flow of the river, but it was a lot easier than bringing the blocks of stone overland. The state of the roads meant even light loads in slow moving ox-carts would frequently have been bogged down.\n\nAt Thetford the confluence of the rivers Thet and Little Ouse this mean that neither was a big enough waterway to be navigable by commercial craft. From Brandon the river Little Ouse gives access to the entire English canal system. You can go west from this river on the Norfolk/Suffolk border as far as Llangollen in North Wales, York to the north, Bristol to the south-west and the river Thames. The main waterways system is reached by the Middle Level, a long and high-sided drain which is extremely boring to navigate, and does not attract many tourists but it does make Norfolk part of this national network.\n\nContinuing downstream from Brandon you approach the Fens, and from the ‘Cut Off Channel’ you enter typical Fenland landscape, with high banks to the river which is often high above the surrounding land. For example the parish of Littleport has the lowest trig point in the whole of England – three feet below sea level! Beyond Lakenheath the river ceases to be the boundary between Norfolk and Suffolk and becomes the boundary between Norfolk and Cambridgeshire. On a nineteenth century map this southern bank of the Little Ouse is still part of Suffolk, a narrow band of the parish of Mendenhall coming between Norfolk and Cambridgeshire. The boundary has since been adjusted to do away with this tongue of land. The hamlet called Little Ouse is about two miles above the confluence with the Great Ouse. The smaller river flows into the larger one at a place called Brandon Creek (rather confusingly, as Brandon itself is ten miles away). There is a pub – the Ship- that has moorings alongside where you can call in for a pint (no worries about drink driving), and there is a long-term mooring place a little further up the river as well.\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nTHE BLOG FOR MEMORIES OF EAST ANGLIA\n\nRate this:\n\nBOUDICCA\n\nBoudicca died in AD 60 or 61. This famous queen of the Iceni tribe lived before East Anglia even existed – this name came about when the Anglo-Saxons arrived in the area some four hundred years later. Boudicca led a revolt against the Roman overlords who had conquered Britain almost twenty years earlier. King Prasutagus (her husband) had been an ally of Rome and the largely independent ruler of an autonomous region in the east of the country (the counties we now call Norfolk and Suffolk). When he died the Romans ignored his desire to leave his kingdom to his daughters. Boudicca did not accept this Roman takeover and continued to maintain her independence. After she and her daughters were badly treated by the Roman soldiers she rose up in arms with her people. While the Roman commander was away in Wales she sacked Colchester before eventually being defeated. It is believed she committed suicide.\n\nKING EDMUND\n\nEdmund king of the East Angles died in AD 869. St Edmund was martyred by the invading Danes. After being captured he was given the opportunity to continue to rule as king under the Danes, but he would not accept this as he would be subservient to a pagan master. He was tied to tree, shot at with arrows to try and get him to change his mind, but when the Danes realised he would never agree he was beheaded. He was soon recognised as a saint, and was very influential as the spiritual defender of the English people. His shrine at Bury St Edmunds became one of the richest and moat powerful in the land. His importance waned as St George was adopted as the Patron Saint of England and was further damaged by the Dissolution of the Monasteries, including that at Bury. He is still popular however, and has churches dedicated to his name as far away as Alberta in Canada.\n\nJOHN SKELTON\n\nHe was born in Diss, and after being educated at Cambridge he was appointed Laureate at Oxford, and Cambridge later appointed him their Laureate too. He was tutor the young prince who was later to become Henry VIII. He was a popular Poet whose verses are not difficult to understand and are accessible to all.\n\nHere are few lines of his concerning a nun’s pet sparrow:\n\nFor the soul of Philip Sparrow\n\nThat was late slain at Carrow,\n\nAmong the Nuns Black,\n\nFor that sweet soul’s sake,\n\nAnd for all sparrows’ souls …\n\nYou can tell he retained an intimate knowledge of the county of his birth! He was created the first Poet Laureate of the nation. He was well known as a prankster and practical joker.\n\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\n\nThomas Wolsey was born in Ipswich, said to be the son of a butcher. He was educated at Ipswich Grammar School before going to Cambridge and then to Oxford to complete his theological studies. After spending a couple of years as the rector of a parish in Somerset he was appointed chaplain to the Archbishop of Canterbury. After obtaining a series of increasingly influential employments he entered the household on King Henry VII as Royal Chaplain. When Henry VIII came to the throne in 1509 he rapidly established himself as the king’s most powerful adviser. He was appointed Cardinal by the Pope and his star seemed to permanently in the ascendant. In Government he rose to be Lord Chancellor, but with the king’s wish to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon (which the Pope opposed) he lost his Government position. He retired to York to carry out his remaining duties as archbishop and died in relative penury; ‘If I had served God as diligently as I have done the king, he would not have given me over in my grey hairs.’\n\nSIR THOMAS BROWNE\n\nBorn in London, he became the most prominent physician in the history of Norwich, but he was most famous as a writer and polymath. Of his written works on science, medicine and religion he wrote Urn Burial in Norwich. He had had already produce Religio Medici while still living in London. His journals recording the wildlife and birds of his adopted county of Norfolk were published as Notes on the Natural History of Norfolk in 1902. He coined many new words which are now in common use; the most famous examples are electricity, medical, ferocious, migrant, coma, anomalous, prairie, ascetic, carnivorous and ambidextrous among many others.\n\nROBERT WALPOLE\n\nHe was wily politician who rose to prominence in the second quarter of the 18th century. He held office from approximately 1721 until 1742, making him the first as well as the longest serving Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. The words Prime Minister were originally used as a term of disapproval, being the translation of the French Premier Ministre (part of a political system that was looked on with distaste). He retired to his home county and built the grand stately home at Houghton Hall, which remains in his family; the Marquess of Cholmondeley who is the current holder is descended from Robert Walpole’s daughter.\n\nGEORGE VANCOUVER\n\nHe was a sea captain born in Kings Lynn. He explored all across the world, not only in Canada. In particular he led the expedition to what was later to become British Columbia in H.M.S. Discovery. The city of Vancouver is named after him.\n\nTHOMAS PAINE\n\nThe foremost political theorist of the American Revolution, he was born in Thetford and attended Thetford Grammar School. After leaving school at the age of 13 he was apprenticed to his father as a weaver.\n\nHe later went to sea, and back in England he met Benjamin Franklin, who suggested that he emigrate to the British colonies in North America. He arrived just as the sentiments behind the American Revolution were taking off, and his pamphlet Common Sense was read by just about everyone in the thirteen colonies.\n\nWhen things began to stir in France, Tom Paine sailed across the Atlantic and became involved in the French Revolution. He spent much of the next decade in Paris, where he was a member of the National Convention. He was imprisoned when his faction fell from power and only narrowly escaped execution by Guillotine.\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nTHE BLOG FOR THE STORY OF EAST ANGLIA\n\nRate this:\n\nThe river rises near Debenham in Suffolk. Here I will say a brief word about Debenhams, the well-known department store. This came into being over 200 years ago in 1813 when William Debenham invested in a draper’s shop in Wigmore Street, London. His surname certainly came from an ancestral connection with the village, but this is the only link with Suffolk.\n\nAt Debenham the river Deben is little more than a trickle; it remains a minor waterway until it reaches Bromeswell, when it becomes a tidal estuary for thirteen miles. For eight miles from Woodbridge to the sea at Felixstowe Ferry it is popular place for sailing yachts and especially dinghies.\n\nWoodbridge is namely for its tide mill, which stands alongside the river. Until the 1960s it was in commercial use, powered only by the rise and fall of the tide; unlike the other watermills in East Anglia that survived in the post-war years it never had any internal combustion engine to aid the power of nature. It was taken over by a charitable trust and the picture above shows the mill undergoing restoration shortly before it opened to the public. They regularly produce stone-ground wholemeal wheat flour that is used in local restaurants and may be purchased from a dozen shops in the vicinity. It is built on the site earlier tide mills that date back to at least 1170. For most of the middle ages it was owned by the Augustinian Friars, and after the Reformation it was operated on behalf of the Crown until sold into private hands by Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nThe tide mill is open from 11 in the morning until 5, from April until September; in October is open at weekends.\n\nThe steamer Yarmouth was briefly based on the river Deben, giving pleasure trips along the estuary from Woodbridge in 1973. As the name suggests she spent most of her life on the Norfolk Broads. She was built in 1895 and after leaving Woodbridge she was moved to St Katherine’s Dock in London, where she was used as floating tea shop. Sadly she was later scrapped. The picture below shows the S. S. Yarmouth in steam, on a brisk April morning, ready to take her passengers.\n\nThe saltmarshes along the estuary are a site of Special Scientific Interest; they are a great place to view over-wintering wading birds. There are riverside walks go along the river from the sea to the north of Woodbridge – these are accessible by train at Woodbridge and Melton stations.\n\nMy first memories of Woodbridge go back to 1958, when my family had lunch at the Crown Hotel. On our honeymoon in 1986 Molly and I stayed at Woodbridge. Later in the year we stayed just up the coast at Shingle Street. We took our bikes and cycled down to Bawdsey. There we crossed the river Deben on the Felixstowe Ferry.\n\nRate this:\n\nNORWICH CITY STATION, closed to passengers in 1959.\n\nThere were many towns in Norfolk that once had multiple railway stations; Norwich and Yarmouth had three stations, and Kings Lynn, Thetford, Fakenham, North Walsham and Aylsham had two each. Cromer had four stations, although not all were open at the same time. To these places we could perhaps add Reepham, where the second station went by the name of Whitwell and Reepham. There are now five places that have two stations; in three cases one is a Network Rail station while the others belong to a Heritage Line. These three places are Sheringham on the NNR, and Wymondham on the MNR. Now both these Heritage Lines occasionally take trains from the national network, but this has only been possible recently in the case of the NNR, as the rail connection between the Network Rail station and the Heritage Line was removed when the BR station at Sheringham was established early in 1967. The third place that has two stations is Wroxham, where the second station is on the narrow gauge line to Aylsham. The only town in Norfolk that now has two stations use by Greater Anglia is Cromer, although there is talk of creating a second stop un Thetford, to serve a growing neighbourhood. In Cromer the additional station there is at Roughton Road, opened in 1985 to serve a new housing development. The other place is no more than a village – Brundall. There Brundall Gardens Halt was opened in 1924 to serve the burgeoning holiday industry on the Broads; Brundall is the principal centre for hire cruisers on the river Yare.\n\nThe three stations at Yarmouth were in order of construction Yarmouth Vauxhall, Yarmouth Southtown and Yarmouth Beach. Yarmouth Southtown was south of the river, and connected Gorleston with Lowestoft. From 1847, when Lowestoft got its train service, until 1859, when Southtown station was opened, the trains went through Berney Arms and diverted on the Norwich to Lowestoft line at Reedham. It has been suggested that this link could be reinstated, so that the train service between Yarmouth and Lowestoft could be restored. Yarmouth Vauxhall was the first station in Norfolk to be built, and was opened (together with the stations to Norwich via Reedham) in 1845. It is the only station in the town that remains today, although it has been renamed Great Yarmouth. The final line to arrive in Yarmouth was the M&GN to Beach Station. Unusually there was no direct connection between the stations in the town, although a temporary track was laid through the streets to enable two steam engines to be delivered from Vauxhall to Yarmouth Beach.\n\nThe GER and the M&GN stations had a connecting link at North Walsham and at Kings Lynn, but none at Fakenham, Aylsham or Norwich. Reepham had no connection between the two lines until 1960, by which time both stations there were closed. The other places with multiple stations were on the Great Eastern except for Cromer. Cromer Beach was opened by the M&GN in 1887. It was much more convenient for the town than the GER station, the aptly named Cromer High. This was at the top of a steep hill above the town. There was originally no connection between the two lines, but a loop was soon inserted; Cromer High was closed to passengers in 1954 and to goods six years later. The other Cromer station was on the line that linked Mundesley with Cromer. This was to serve the golf course and was named Cromer Links Halt.\n\nThetford had besides the main station another smaller station Thetford Bridge on the line to Bury St Edmunds. This line closed to passengers in June 1953 and to goods in 1960. Thetford Bridge station was introduced in the town so that trains could run from Swaffham to Bury without reversing at Thetford Town station. In 1875 a loop was built to make this possible and Thetford Bridge station was opened to provide access to Thetford. South Lynn was the M&GN railway at Kings Lynn. The connection between Lynn and Stamford Bridge was established in 1866 and so preceded the formation of the M&GN. Until 1886 the line terminated across the river Great Ouse at West Lynn Station, but after the bridge was built this station closed and South Lynn was opened. There was a link to the GER London mainline near South Lynn station and a shuttle service ran from Kings Lynn to South Lynn across the river Nar. This bridge is still there and until 1994 it was used by freight trains serving the South Lynn sugar beet works. South Lynn was a minor station compared to Kings Lynn, and never had its original wooden platforms replaced by more permanent structures. South Lynn closed to passengers in 1959, along with almost the entire M&GN (only the short stretch from Sheringham to Cromer still remains) but stayed open for another nine years to serve the stub of the line that ran as far as West Raynham to carry goods\n\nFinally I must mention Haddiscoe, which stands close to the river Waveney to the southern border of the county. It had a high level station on the Yarmouth to Beccles line, and Haddiscoe Low Level station on the Norwich to Lowestoft line. Haddiscoe Low Level remains open, as plain Haddiscoe. High Level station closed in 1959. Far from being a town it is a most desolate place to have any railway station, let alone two; Haddiscoe has 13,000 passengers last year, which is not a bad number considering it is two miles distant from the village, and that has a population of under 500. The village of St Olaves (jut across the Waveney) is closer to Haddiscoe station. The stations at Haddiscoe were connected by two short lines (running south from Yarmouth to Lowestoft and from Beccles to Norwich) that were used for goods traffic only; there was no passenger traffic between the two stations; anyone wanting to travel to or from Yarmouth had better ways to go.\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nTHE BLOG FOR THE STORY OF EAST ANGLIA\n\nRate this:\n\nAlthough the Wensum ends with its confluence with the Yare (to the east of Norwich), the river is not navigable above New Mills. This is a former pumping station which was erected in the 19th century when mains water was laid on in the city. The mills were called ‘New’ when reconstructed in 1430 to avoid the steeps charges exacted for grinding corn by the Abbot of St. Benet’s, at the mill where City Station was later built. This marks the effective dividing line between the lower and upper reaches of the river Wensum. There are still several mills on the upper Wensum, and sluices were there were once many more. The stretches of water between these interruptions to navigation use to be used by vessels which plied the two miles or so that was available to them. I myself remember hiring a rowing skiff on the ‘Back River’, as we refer to the upper Wensum to Hellesdon and beyond, and rowing my parents up to Hellesdon mill pond and back to the city.\n\nThe next reach of the river is not much used because there are only a few adjoining properties where the occupants could use a rowing boat. I see no reason why you could not put a canoe in at Costessey though. Many years ago it used to be possible to drag your skiff across the millrace at Hellesdon to access this stretch of the river.\n\nThe next length of water goes through Costessey to Taverham, and this is used by rowing boats that belong to people who live along the riverside. It used to be plied by larger sailing vessels, if the following picture is anything to go by; this shows a couple of scow and a number of logs that have been towed upstream to Taverham sawmill. (Taverham was namely for milling paper, but during the 1830s the mill also cut wood.)\n\nContinuing upstream the river winds through water meadows to Lenwade mill, which stands as an imposing brick edifice, now converted to residential use. Lyng comes next, where another paper mill used to operate. Besides Lyng and Taverham mills, that at Hellesdon was also at one time a pulp mill for paper making, although it had early milled flax seed for linseed oil, and was latterly a corn mill. The river has already passed three riverside churches dedicated to St Edmund (at Fishergate in Norwich, Costessey and Taverham, and at Lyng passes another one-time place of worship with the same patron saint, this time the ruined chapel of St Edmund that was once attached to a nunnery. This is not the place to examine the reason for this profusion of riverside churches, all dedicated to one saint, but I will recommend that you refer to my blogs on this subject. CLICK HERE to read my thoughts on Lyng,\n\nThe mills at Hellesdon, Costessey, Taverham and Lyng have all been burnt down or been demolished, but the next mill, that at Elsing, still stands. This, as you can see in the village sign, is a pleasant wooden structure. The grounds around the mill pond are occasionally open to the public, and (providing the weather is fine) this makes the perfect backdrop for a summer fete. From Esing we continue tracing the river upstream. Just before it crosses the road at Billingford it is joined by a tributary, the Blackwater. This river also a had mills on it at Worthing and Gressenhall. North Elmham still has a watermill building, but that at Great Ryburgh has been demolished. Pensthorpe Natural Park is popular place for viewing wild birds. This village too once had a watermill, but the only thing remaining is the iron mill wheel axle, found when excavating the lakes for the park. Fakenham mill was built as a impressive structure, although the water available for its operation was limited.\n\nFakenham mill was about one mile downstream from Hempton mill, which in turn was about two miles downstream from Sculthorpe mill. We are nearing the headwaters of river, and the flow becomes too weak to have powered any more mills; however the building remains, now used as pub and restaurant – one of the more attractive uses for an old mill!\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nTHE BLOG FOR THE HISTORY OF EAST ANGLIA\n\nRate this:\n\nThe overlapping of the generations can soon whisk us away into distant times. Let me give you an example of what I mean. I will take musicians as my subject. In 1949, when the German composer Richard Strauss died aged eighty-five, the child who was to become the English composer of church music, John Rutter, was four years old. Strauss himself had been born into the age of Wagner; he even met the Maestro after a performance of Parsifal at Bayreuth. Wagner had been born in 1813. Just three lifetimes – those of Rutter, Strauss and Wagner – take us back over 200 years, and to a very different musical environment.\n\nOr take the family of a well-known English philanthropists; when the 20th century dawned, one of Elizabeth Fry’s children was a still alive; and Elizabeth Fry was a young woman of nineteen at the end of the eighteenth century. That takes us back 120 years in just two lifetimes. These things lead us to consider the great changes that have occurred over the past centuries, but it also causes us to remark on how little has changed in some ways.\n\nOne example of continuity and change concerns the printing press. The one pictured here does not differ greatly from the machines that Gutenberg was using nearly 700 years ago, and the same movable type was still being employed in printing offices across the globe as recently as fifty years ago. Yet now the whole idea of reproducing information in a physical form, let alone the use of lead type and transferring impression through ink onto paper, now seems old-fashioned in the extreme. In many ways the invention of printing began this progress to modernity that has continued until today but at a rapidly gathering pace.\n\nThe exploration of the world took on a new urgency soon after the discovery of printing; people were anxious to know what lay over the horizon, and this knowledge could now be disseminated by printing. The spiritual changes that accompanied the Reformation happened within a century of the availability of the printed book. The rapid spread of ideas that created the Scientific Revolution was only made possible by the printing press. In the advances of industry we have seen huge strides that took place in the Industrial Revolution. Leaving aside the enormous changes that have happened in my lifetime, examine the incremental changes that have occurred since the middle ages.\n\nOne of the earliest new industries that followed the discovery of printing was paper making. The one could not proceed without the other, and my interest in paper mills is not just a random dip into history. The creation of coal mines, particularly in this country, was a necessary step in making the Industrial Revolution possible. Coal made the steam engine, and steam engines were first used to increase the output of tin mines. Iron ore was another mineral with a great potential. The iron foundries made the construction of railways possible, and the steam engine replaced sail as the motive power on the water. At this stage there is still a long way to go in the history of advancing knowledge, but first let us step back and turn our attention from industry to science.\n\nThe practical implications of scientific discovery are upper most in our minds today, but when Galileo announced his thoughts about the nature of the universe he did not envisage their application to the art of navigation. His concern was with the truth. Similarly Sir Isaac Newton was not even aware of the development of colour photography when he published his paper on the spectrum of light. These basic insights into the reality of life have now taken a back seat to the demands of industry. The great discoveries that are still to come will not be the result of a technical fix, you can be sure of that.\n\nIn this welter of change, what has remained constant? It is time itself. The passing of the years, the changing seasons, the flooding and drought, the rain and shine. The progress from childhood to adolescence, from adulthood to old age; these are things that will always remain the same.\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nTHE BLOG FOR THE HISTORY OF EAST ANGLIA\n\nRate this:"
