Kingswear?) that never had tracks? Only ever saw boats.\n\nDartmouth.\n\nIt had a station building with a booking office, but nearest trains (and track) were on the other side of the river at Kingswear!\n\n--- old post above --- --- new post below ---\n\nThe trainshed was demolished a long time ago and the Callaghan Labour Govt started building a Govt Office there (it was abandoned when Thatcher won in 1979).\n\nNow its the site of a Morrisons supermarket\n\nLink here : http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/s/southport_lord_street/index.shtml\n\nRe: Southport (Lord Street).\n\nThe frontage survives, forming (part of) a Travelodge.
