        "text": "NORWICH CITY STATION, closed to passengers in 1959.\n\nThere were many towns in Norfolk that once had multiple railway stations; Norwich and Yarmouth had three stations, and Kings Lynn, Thetford, Fakenham, North Walsham and Aylsham had two each. Cromer had four stations, although not all were open at the same time. To these places we could perhaps add Reepham, where the second station went by the name of Whitwell and Reepham. There are now five places that have two stations; in three cases one is a Network Rail station while the others belong to a Heritage Line. These three places are Sheringham on the NNR, and Wymondham on the MNR. Now both these Heritage Lines occasionally take trains from the national network, but this has only been possible recently in the case of the NNR, as the rail connection between the Network Rail station and the Heritage Line was removed when the BR station at Sheringham was established early in 1967. The third place that has two stations is Wroxham, where the second station is on the narrow gauge line to Aylsham. The only town in Norfolk that now has two stations use by Greater Anglia is Cromer, although there is talk of creating a second stop un Thetford, to serve a growing neighbourhood. In Cromer the additional station there is at Roughton Road, opened in 1985 to serve a new housing development. The other place is no more than a village – Brundall. There Brundall Gardens Halt was opened in 1924 to serve the burgeoning holiday industry on the Broads; Brundall is the principal centre for hire cruisers on the river Yare.\n\nThe three stations at Yarmouth were in order of construction Yarmouth Vauxhall, Yarmouth Southtown and Yarmouth Beach. Yarmouth Southtown was south of the river, and connected Gorleston with Lowestoft. From 1847, when Lowestoft got its train service, until 1859, when Southtown station was opened, the trains went through Berney Arms and diverted on the Norwich to Lowestoft line at Reedham. It has been suggested that this link could be reinstated, so that the train service between Yarmouth and Lowestoft could be restored. Yarmouth Vauxhall was the first station in Norfolk to be built, and was opened (together with the stations to Norwich via Reedham) in 1845. It is the only station in the town that remains today, although it has been renamed Great Yarmouth. The final line to arrive in Yarmouth was the M&GN to Beach Station. Unusually there was no direct connection between the stations in the town, although a temporary track was laid through the streets to enable two steam engines to be delivered from Vauxhall to Yarmouth Beach.\n\nThe GER and the M&GN stations had a connecting link at North Walsham and at Kings Lynn, but none at Fakenham, Aylsham or Norwich. Reepham had no connection between the two lines until 1960, by which time both stations there were closed. The other places with multiple stations were on the Great Eastern except for Cromer. Cromer Beach was opened by the M&GN in 1887. It was much more convenient for the town than the GER station, the aptly named Cromer High. This was at the top of a steep hill above the town. There was originally no connection between the two lines, but a loop was soon inserted; Cromer High was closed to passengers in 1954 and to goods six years later. The other Cromer station was on the line that linked Mundesley with Cromer. This was to serve the golf course and was named Cromer Links Halt.\n\nThetford had besides the main station another smaller station Thetford Bridge on the line to Bury St Edmunds. This line closed to passengers in June 1953 and to goods in 1960. Thetford Bridge station was introduced in the town so that trains could run from Swaffham to Bury without reversing at Thetford Town station. In 1875 a loop was built to make this possible and Thetford Bridge station was opened to provide access to Thetford. South Lynn was the M&GN railway at Kings Lynn. The connection between Lynn and Stamford Bridge was established in 1866 and so preceded the formation of the M&GN. Until 1886 the line terminated across the river Great Ouse at West Lynn Station, but after the bridge was built this station closed and South Lynn was opened. There was a link to the GER London mainline near South Lynn station and a shuttle service ran from Kings Lynn to South Lynn across the river Nar. This bridge is still there and until 1994 it was used by freight trains serving the South Lynn sugar beet works. South Lynn was a minor station compared to Kings Lynn, and never had its original wooden platforms replaced by more permanent structures. South Lynn closed to passengers in 1959, along with almost the entire M&GN (only the short stretch from Sheringham to Cromer still remains) but stayed open for another nine years to serve the stub of the line that ran as far as West Raynham to carry goods\n\nFinally I must mention Haddiscoe, which stands close to the river Waveney to the southern border of the county. It had a high level station on the Yarmouth to Beccles line, and Haddiscoe Low Level station on the Norwich to Lowestoft line. Haddiscoe Low Level remains open, as plain Haddiscoe. High Level station closed in 1959. Far from being a town it is a most desolate place to have any railway station, let alone two; Haddiscoe has 13,000 passengers last year, which is not a bad number considering it is two miles distant from the village, and that has a population of under 500. The village of St Olaves (jut across the Waveney) is closer to Haddiscoe station. The stations at Haddiscoe were connected by two short lines (running south from Yarmouth to Lowestoft and from Beccles to Norwich) that were used for goods traffic only; there was no passenger traffic between the two stations; anyone wanting to travel to or from Yarmouth had better ways to go.\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nTHE BLOG FOR THE STORY OF EAST ANGLIA"
