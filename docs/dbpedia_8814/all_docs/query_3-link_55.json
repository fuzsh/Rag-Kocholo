        "meta_description": "Welcome to my gallery of photos of the railway scene in East Anglia and other parts of the UK and Europe. Most were taken in the decade between 1972 and 1982. Thirty years on a lot of these scenes have disappeared for good. Some lines have closed, some have been electrified or the signalling upgraded with the consequent loss of signal boxes, semaphore signals and manual crossing gates. The BR blue livery has also disappeared under privatisation. From a personal point of view the railways are far less interesting today. This is a replacement for my old Fotopic site which contained around 1700 images. The new site will be continually updated, time permitting, so please check back now and again. It's good to be back. I would welcome any contributions to the site especially disused stations. All pictures would be credited to the owner.      Alan Moore, Ipswich, Suffolk.    All photos are copyright A. Moore.",
