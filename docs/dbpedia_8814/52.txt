you could probably have a whole thread discussing whether it is or not!

you have to use steps to get from one section to the other, without coming down again, so I would say yes.

Some might say no, because there is a line connecting the two sections. But that line cant be used by passengers, so it doesnt count!

The line itself doesn't disqualify the station if it climbs the grade (e.g. Lichfield TV and Smethwick Galton Bridge both have chords but are definitely 2-level stations). However I'd say the 2 'main' lines need to be able to cross each other without conflict, so Liskeard doesn't count.

From 1872 to 1917 Brockley Station had an adjacent Brockley Lane station on the Nunhead - Lewisham line, but technically they were separate stations.

According to the Department for Transport and the Transport for London rail prospectus report released in 2016, it has been listed as one of the Southeastern franchise planned improvements in the document entitled "New interchange at Brockley", suggesting that there might be a case to reopen the station.

A proposal to create a new Brockley Interchange station linking the existing Overground station with restored platforms at the former Brockley Lane site is included in the London Borough of Lewisham's 2019-2041 transport strategy, though with no funding as yet identified for the project.

But it does have National Rail platforms on two levels.

Not really. The main shed and platforms 13/14 are separate (you need to use the footbridge to get between the two) but they are both the same height. In a sense it's no different to the likes of Peckham Rye.

Weirdly the two stations at Heath near Cardiff are separate stations despite being called "High Level" and "Low Level" respectively.

As ever with these things, it comes from quite a complex history. Despite the former Rhymney Railway being much the older line, its halt at Heath opened in 1915, after that on Cardiff Railway (1911). The "High" and "Low" level names were introduced by the GWR to avoid confusion. Then again, Tyndrum also has entirely separate stations, with "Upper" and "Lower" in them (typed this just as SargeNpton posted! Great minds thinking alike...)

What's going on with the naming there? Why not Upper Tyndrum and Lower Tyndrum?

The station was previously known as 'Tyndrum Upper' between 1956 and 1988. The station name was then subsequently altered/flipped to 'Upper Tyndrum' following the introduction of Radio Electronic Token Block signalling, this in order to reduce the risk of it being confused with 'Tyndrum Lower' in radio comms.

Prior to 1956, both stations were just known as 'Tyndrum', one being on the West Highland Railway and the other station, on the Callendar and Oban line, (which presumably, was considered to be sufficient of a distinction between the two).

Liskeard us actually two separate stations divided by the yard car park access road. It must be quite unique in the UK.

Really is quite a pleasant curiosity in its own right.

And, of course, at right angles.

Sheringham is two separate stations on the same piece of track, Network Rail to the east, North Norfolk Railway to the west, with a level crossing between them.

I believe that one of them was re-named when the electronic token block system was brought it. It prevented the wrong station being input by mistake.

That was me.

Waterloo East always seems to be at a higher level as you first have to go up the stairs/escalator from the main concourse at Waterloo station when interchanging there.

Not 100% sure if there's actually any difference in elevation or if it's an illusion.

Waterloo East was originally Waterloo Junction and there was a connecting line from Waterloo East platforms C/D across the Bridge that now supports the walkway and across the main concourse roughly through Boots so there can't be that much difference in the height of the running rails.
