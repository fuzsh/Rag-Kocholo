Ben Chapman Dies, Played Alongside Ruth

Hoover, Ala. - Ben Chapman, who played in the New York Yankees outfield alongside Babe Ruth and led off for the American League in the first All-Star Game in 1933, died Wednesday at his home. He was 84.

A family member said Chapman died of an apparent heart attack in this Birmingham suburb.

Chapman became the player-manager of the Philadelphia Phillies in 1945, and remained there for four seasons, compiling a 196-276 record.

Chapman had a career average of .302 during a 15-year career, playing in one World Series with the Yankees and four All-Star Games.

Although overshadowed by the likes of Ruth and Lou Gehrig, Chapman was a star in his own right as one of the game's top base-runners. He led the American League in stolen bases four times, ranking among the top five on three different occasions. He also led the league in triples one year.

Before the days of free agency, Chapman was one of baseball's most traveled big-name players. In addition to the Yankees, he played for six teams, including the Washington Senators (on two occasions), the Boston Red Sox, the Cleveland Indians, the Chicago White Sox, the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Philadelphia Phillies.
