        "text": "Originally from LaFayette, Georgia, Ben Chapman is a Nashville-based country artist known for his soulful voice and guitar playing. He is heavily influenced by the sounds of the 70’s, pairing the groove-driven Southern music of bands like the Allman Brothers and Little Feat with the hard-hitting country sounds of Hank Williams, Jr. and the writing prowess of songwriters like Guy Clark and Roger Miller. Playing in bars across North Georgia since he was 17, Ben has always considered himself to be an old soul in the new age of country music. He has garnered quick attention from seasoned songwriters in Nashville, cutting his teeth at local joints during the week and touring the South East on the weekends. In 2020, he began working in the studio with producer Jake Gear (Hailey Whitters, Flatland Cavalry) to hone his sound that is rooted in the traditions of his influences, but that authentically pushes the country format into the next decade. These sessions resulted in his debut LP – Hard Country."
