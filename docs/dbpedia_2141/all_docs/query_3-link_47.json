        "text": "Jackie Robinson was abused unmercifully when he first came to the Major Leagues. One of the most famous incidents was when the Philadelphia Phillies, with manager Ben Chapman leading the way, jeered at and insulted him ceaselessly, calling him a &quot;nigger&quot; from the bench and telling him to &quot;go back to the jungle&quot;. Branch Rickey believed that this, more than anything else, united the Dodgers around Robinson. Baseball Commissioner Happy Chandler admonished the Phillies and asked Robinson to pose for photographs with Chapman as a conciliatory gesture. Robinson didn&#39;t refuse, but the ensuing session was likely difficult for both participants. This is the original print (9 x 7-5/8&quot;) of this infamous meeting. Photo is EX-MT and is stamped May 12, 1947 on the verso."
