        "text": "A drug dealer jailed after a £1million cocaine gang was smashed by police in Grimsby has died, it has been confirmed.\n\nGary Chapman, 55, died in North Sea Camp prison, less than two years into a sentence of almost six years.\n\nHis death in February emerged during an inquest into his death held a Boston Coroner's Court.\n\nChapman, of Humberstone Road in Grimsby, was one of five men sent to prison for their part in a £1 million major drugs operation that spanned numerous towns and cities across the country.\n\nIn May 2015 Chapman was jailed for five years and eight months after being convicted of conspiracy to supply class A drugs. In February this year he was taken to Boston's Pilgrim Hospital for palliative care treatment, after being diagnosed with lung cancer.\n\nHe had been admitted there on February 24 and died just three days later on February 27.\n\nThe inquest ruled he had died of natural causes. Coroner Murray Spittal heard evidence that Chapman was detained at North Sea Camp, after being found guilty, of his part in the drugs' operation. The inquest concluded there was no suspicious evidence surrounding his death.\n\nIn total 21 people have received almost 150 years in prison for conspiring to supply class A drugs in the Police operation which began in December 2013, in a case heard at Birmingham Crown Court.\n\nLocally the four other men sentenced were:\n\nBen Chapman, 28, of Talbot Road, Immingham who pleaded guilty and was sentenced to ten years in prison.\n\nCraig Johnson, 32, of Frederick Street, Grimsby, who pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 11 years in prison.\n\nDavid Wells, 28, of St Denys Close, South Killingholme, who pleaded guilty and was sentenced to seven years and eight months.\n\nDavid Williams, 28, of Greengate Lane, South Killingholme, who pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years.\n\nHumberside Police's Serious and Organised Crime Unit commenced an operation targeting an organised crime group involved in the trafficking of cocaine into the Grimsby area. In the following nine months, working closely with officers from other forces, seizures of cocaine, heroin and cannabis worth more than £1 million and more than £175,000 in cash were made in Humberside, Greater Manchester and the West Midlands.\n\nEnquiries quickly identified the group had links to other parts of the UK including Greater Manchester, London and the West Midlands.\n\nAt the time Humberside Police, said: \"The sentences given send a clear message, that the organised distribution of Class A drugs will not be tolerated in our communities and those responsible will be pursued and brought to justice.\n\n\"Class A drugs ruin lives and not just the lives of people who take them. The individuals who have been sentenced for this always thought they were above the law and it is pleasing to see justice now being done.\""
