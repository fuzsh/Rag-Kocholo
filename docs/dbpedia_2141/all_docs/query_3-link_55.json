        "text": "Ben sits within the Engineering and Tech group at our firm and works with a wide range of clients, from startups to multinationals, across a variety of technical areas. Ben’s background is in laser devices and optical engineering, but over the course of his career Ben has built up experience across a wide variety of technical fields including medical devices, remote sensing, and display technology to name but a few.\n\nBen has appeared numerous times before the opposition divisions and technical boards of appeal of the European Patent Office, with success both in defending his clients’ patents as well as securing revocation decisions. He has also been involved in the litigation of a number of patent infringement cases at the UK high court, as well as providing support for larger teams handling pan-European litigation matters.\n\nBen joined Carpmaels & Ransford in September 2013. He holds a first class degree in Physics from Imperial College and a Masters by Research in Optics and Photonics. This was followed by a PhD in photonics and laser development, with a particular focus on fibre optics, nonlinear optics and short pulse laser systems.\n\nOutside the office, Ben is kept busy by his two children but, when time permits, he enjoys running and cycling."
