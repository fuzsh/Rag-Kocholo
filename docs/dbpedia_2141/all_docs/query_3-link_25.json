        "text": "William Benjamin \"Ben\" Chapman (December 25, 1908 – July 7, 1993) was an American outfielder and manager in Major League Baseball who played for several teams, most notably the New York Yankees. Although a talented player in his day, Chapman is most remembered for his racist antics on and off the field. He gained particular notoriety in 1947 when he used his position as manager of the Philadelphia Phillies to oppose the presence of Jackie Robinson on the Brooklyn Dodgers on the basis of Robinson's race.\n\nBen Chapman in Southern Victory\n\nBen Chapman was a chief assault band leader in the Freedom Party Guards. In 1939, he and his unit delivered former Confederate Vice President Willy Knight to Camp Dependable. Chapman took great pains to personally deliver Knight to the camp warden, Jefferson Pinkard.[1]"
