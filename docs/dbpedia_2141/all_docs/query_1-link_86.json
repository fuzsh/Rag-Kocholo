        "text": "1 of 42\n\nEarly years\n\nHulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nJack Roosevelt Robinson was born Jan. 31, 1919, in Cairo, Georgia.\n\n2 of 42\n\nEarly years\n\nHulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nJackie (second from the left) was the youngest of five brothers and sisters. Robinson's stay in Georgia was short-lived, as he moved with mother and siblings to California shortly after his father left in 1920.\n\n3 of 42\n\nUCLA\n\nCollegiate Images/Getty Images\n\nRobinson became a four-sport star at UCLA, earning varsity letters in baseball, football, basketball and track and field.\n\n4 of 42\n\nUCLA\n\nArchive Photos/Getty Images\n\nRobinson won the 1940 NCAA Men’s Track and Field Championships in the long jump. Surprisingly, in addition to playing football and basketball, he played just one season of baseball at UCLA, hitting only .097, not the start you’d expect to lead to a Hall of Fame MLB career.\n\n5 of 42\n\nMilitary career\n\nGado/Getty Images\n\nRobinson was drafted in 1942 and served until 1944 when he received an honorable discharge after an incident where he refused to sit in the back of a military bus. He never actually saw any combat.\n\n6 of 42\n\nNegro Leagues\n\nSporting News/Getty Images\n\nRobinson signed with the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro Leagues, and it was here where he drew the attention of Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey.\n\n7 of 42\n\nMarriage to Rachel Isum\n\nArchive Photos/Getty Images\n\nRobinson married his college sweetheart in February 1946.\n\n8 of 42\n\nFatherhood\n\nGado/Getty Images\n\nThe couple welcomed its first child to the world later that year.\n\n9 of 42\n\nSigning with the Dodgers\n\nSporting News Archive/Getty Images\n\nLate in 1945 Robinson signed his historic deal with the Brooklyn Dodgers, paving the way for him to become the first black player in Major League Baseball.\n\n10 of 42\n\nMinor leagues\n\nGado/Getty Images\n\nRobinson spent 1946 in Montreal playing for the Royals, the AAA affiliate of the Dodgers.\n\n11 of 42\n\nThe call-up\n\nNew York Daily News archive/Getty Images\n\nJust prior to the start of the 1947 season, Robinson gets the call from the Dodgers to come and join the big league club.\n\n12 of 42\n\nNumber 42\n\nGado/Getty Images\n\nHe is assigned No. 42, which would go on to become arguably the most iconic jersey number in MLB history.\n\n13 of 42\n\nMeeting Leo Durocher\n\nNew York Daily News archive\n\nThe Dodgers manager at the time was the legendary Leo Durocher, who was an outspoken champion for Robinson breaking the MLB color barrier.\n\n14 of 42\n\nDebut with the Dodgers\n\nGetty Images\n\nRobinson makes his MLB debut on April 15, 1947, drawing a walk and scoring a run in a 5-3 win.\n\n15 of 42\n\nLife on the Dodgers\n\nFPG/Getty Images\n\nWhile not everyone on the Dodgers was excited to have Robinson on the team, most of his new teammates followed their manager's lead and welcomed him with open arms.\n\n16 of 42\n\nRookie of the Year\n\nGado/Getty Images\n\nRobinson's first year was an unmitigated success, where he hit just under .300 while leading the league in stolen bases on his way to his first World Series. For his efforts, he was named Rookie of the Year.\n\n17 of 42\n\nFriendship with Pee Wee Reese\n\nGado/Getty Images\n\nOne teammate in particular who came out in strong support of Robinson was Pee Wee Reese, who memorably once put his arm around Robinson, a gesture that was later memorialized as a statue in Brooklyn.\n\n18 of 42\n\nAll-Star\n\nTranscendental Graphics/Getty Images\n\nJackie Robinson was the first black player to make the All-Star team in 1949, and he made it five more times in each of the next five seasons.\n\n19 of 42\n\nFacing racism throughout his career\n\nTranscendental Graphics/Getty Images\n\nRobinson's trials and tribulations while dealing with racism on and off the field are well-documented, but perhaps no one was as outspoken as Phillies manager Ben Chapman, who often hurled racial epithets at Robinson from the Philadelphia dugout.\n\n20 of 42\n\nCivil rights advocate\n\nCincinnati Museum Center/Getty Images\n\nLong before his career ended, Robinson used his newfound fame to become a champion of civil rights across the United States.\n\n21 of 42\n\n\"The Jackie Robinson Story\"\n\nJohn D. Kisch/Getty Images\n\nIn the middle of his run with the Dodgers, Robinson starred in his own biopic in 1950, opposite Ruby Dee.\n\n22 of 42\n\nFamily life\n\nGado/Getty Images\n\nMr. and Mrs. Robinson ended up with a total of three kids: Jackie Jr., Sharon and David.\n\n23 of 42\n\nNBC\n\nKeystone/Getty Images\n\nRobinson took a role at NBC in 1952, which would later lead to him breaking into broadcasting following his retirement from baseball.\n\n24 of 42\n\nRelationship with Larry Doby\n\nSports Studio Photos/Getty Images\n\nA few months after Robinson's debut, Larry Doby broke the color barrier in the American League, and the two quickly became close friends.\n\n25 of 42\n\nNational League MVP\n\nGado/Getty Images\n\nRobinson's best year as a Dodger came in 1949 when he led the league in batting average and steals while also scoring 122 runs and knocking in 124 runs on his way to his one and only NL MVP award.\n\n26 of 42\n\nTaking on the Yankees in the World Series\n\nMark Kauffman\n\nThe Dodgers made it to the World Series a remarkable six times during Jackie Robinson's tenure there but were bested by the Yankees during five of those trips.\n\n27 of 42\n\nWorld Champion\n\nBettmann / Getty Images\n\nIn 1955, the Dodgers finally got over the hump and defeated their crosstown adversary, giving Robinson his only World Series ring.\n\n28 of 42\n\nWorld Series victory\n\nSports Studio Photos/Getty Images\n\nWhile the title would make the Dodgers the toast of the city, the celebration would be short-lived, as they would move to Los Angeles in 1957, one year after Robinson retired.\n\n29 of 42\n\nPolitical activist\n\nGado/Getty Images\n\nRobinson was all over the political spectrum, supporting candidates like Hubert Humphrey...\n\n30 of 42\n\nPolitical activist\n\nGado/Getty Images\n\n… to Nelson Rockefeller...\n\n31 of 42\n\nPolitical activist\n\nGado/Getty Images\n\n... to meeting Fidel Castro...\n\n32 of 42\n\nPolitical activist\n\nGado/Getty Images\n\n... and even supporting Richard Nixon's presidential candidacy.\n\n33 of 42\n\nCivil rights advocate\n\nGado/Getty Images\n\nRobinson spent the late 1950s and early part of the 1960s fighting for civil rights...\n\n34 of 42\n\nCivil rights advocate\n\nTranscendental Graphics/Getty Images\n\n... including in this photo with boxer Floyd Patterson before the two boarded a flight to Birmingham.\n\n35 of 42\n\nTrade to the Giants\n\nTranscendental Graphics/Getty Images\n\nA little-remembered fact about Robinson is that the Dodgers actually traded him to the Giants following the 1956 season.
