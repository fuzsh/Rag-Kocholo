Olin College of Engineering, a unique school of 350 students outside of Boston. Originally, I’m from Ticonderoga, NY in the Adirondack Mountains. When I’m not engineering, I love to explore outdoors: hiking, biking, skiing, or unicycling, I also enjoy whistling, machining, soap making and contradancing. I love building and creating life-changing technologies that solve big, meaningful challenges. Here you will see projects that I have worked on in the last few years. Please check them out!"
