        "text": "“Little roller, up along first, beHIND THE BAG! IT GETS THROUGH BUCKNER! HERE COMES KNIGHT AND THE METS WIN IT!! ~ Vin Scully\n\n“In our sundown perambulations of late, through the outer parts of Brooklyn, we have observed several parties of youngsters playing ‘base’, a certain game of ball…Let us go forth awhile and get better air in our lungs; let us leave our close rooms; the game of ball…is glorious.” ~ Walt Whitman\n\nBEHIND THE BAG will attempt to illuminate the smaller stories behind the big teams, big parks and big games of the classic baseball park era (up through the 1970s or so). The blog’s name is from Vin Scully’s classic call from the 1986 World Series (thoroughly enjoyed by this die-hard Mets fan), but I think “Game 6” evoked a feeling of baseball past – not necessarily the superstar winning it all, but the everyday player or players being in the spotlight in a particular place or time, and maybe becoming a hero for eternity, or perhaps just for one day. Those who are regulars to baseball-fever.com’s Ballparks forums will know me as “alpineinc”, a long-time poster who scours the ends of the internet for classic photos and articles that would otherwise be forgotten. From there, I decided to start this blog to expand on themes and ideas started there, and I haven’t stopped! Also, enjoy the rotating ballpark headers at the top of the site, classic shots of classic parks! And, all photos on this site are linked to larger versions that open in separate tabs/windows for closer viewing. Anyway, have fun and feel free to respond to anything here! ~ Tom Conmy (alpineinc)\n\n“LOVE this blog. These are the kinds of photos and stories that inspire me to paint what I paint. I’ll definitely be returning often.” – Graig Kreindler, award-winning baseball artist and illustrator\n\nOriginal “About” page with comments\n\nProud member of the Society for American Baseball Research\n\nDon’t forget to add us to your phone’s home screen, then just follow the icon to check out the latest posts, or you can follow us on Twitter at Behind The Bag (below)!"
