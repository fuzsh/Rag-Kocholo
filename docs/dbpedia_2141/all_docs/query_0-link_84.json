        "text": "Opinion\n\nThe PointConversations and insights about the moment.\n\nFeb. 6, 2024, 5:30 p.m. ET\n\nGrowing up in the South, I pretty much hated the country music that was forever swirling around me (except for Willie and Dolly, of course). Too much twangy romanticizing of trucks, beer, bar brawls and bad relationships for my taste.\n\nBut as the years rolled by, I found myself drawn more and more to this oh-so-American art form, especially the thick vein of humor running through much of it. Which is why I am an unabashed, longtime fangirl of the bad boy Toby Keith and why I am heartbroken over his death on Monday at the not particularly ripe age of 62.\n\nMost non-country-music devotees probably think of Keith, if at all, as the in-your-face wannabe cowboy who served up flag-waving tunes, the most famous and polarizing of which was the post-9/11 war-themed hit “Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue.” No doubt, as middle-finger lyrics go, it is hard to beat:\n\nAnd you’ll be sorry that you messed with the U.S. of A.\n\n’Cause we’ll put a boot in your ass.\n\nIt’s the American way.\n\nBut I loved Keith for his lighter fare, which was rich with funny, frequently self-deprecating themes and lyrics. I still chuckle and roll my eyes recalling my dad trying to teach his toddler grandkids to sing “I Love This Bar.” “Trailerhood”? “Red Solo Cup”? “High Maintenance Woman”? Glorious.\n\nMy own Keith favorite — and I am clearly far from alone in this — may be his 2005 hit “As Good as I Once Was,” a daffy, rollicking meditation on the physical vagaries of getting older. Sexy twins looking to you for a wild night? Best friend calling for a helping hand in a pool hall fight? Oof. Those are shakier propositions than they were back in his “prime,” but as one-offs, Keith’ll give ’em a whirl, because “I ain’t as good as I once was, but I’m as good once as I ever was.”\n\nYou don’t have to be a former hell-raiser to relate. Time and chance happen to us all.\n\nKeith was a colorful, controversial character. But the man could laugh at himself and could sing a good ditty. So please join me in toasting him with, as only seems appropriate, whiskey for his men and beer for his horses.\n\nFeb. 6, 2024, 4:49 p.m. ET\n\nThere it is, the probable answer to why the exit door plug on the Boeing 737 Max Alaska Airlines flight blew out in the air. A National Transportation Safety Board preliminary report on the incident, released today, says that four bolts on the door plug were missing.\n\nThose four bolts, which prevent the door from sliding up, are removed on purpose when mechanics have to take the door off for maintenance or inspection, as was done last September, according to the report. But somehow, when the installation was over, they weren’t there. No bolts — nothing to stop the door from sliding up and then off.\n\nPreliminary N.T.S.B. reports like this one focus on establishing facts rather than spelling out who was at fault, which will wait for the final report. But this plane was practically new, and the Boeing chief executive, David Calhoun, has already acknowledged that it was a “quality escape” that caused the blowout.\n\nEverything so far indicates that Boeing is a company plagued by shoddy quality control. Just yesterday, it disclosed that a supplier had found “two holes may not have been drilled exactly to our requirements” on about 50 unfinished Boeing 737 Max planes, requiring more work on the planes and delaying their delivery.\n\nHow could all this happen?\n\nThis morning, before heading to Capitol Hill to testify before the House Transportation Committee, the F.A.A. administrator Mike Whitaker stopped by CNBC to discuss everything the agency has done to try to get ahead of this: slowing Boeing production lines, revoking certain exemptions, getting more inspectors on the ground, etc.\n\nBut he also said something that really goes to the heart of the matter. Pressed by the host about the root causes, Whitaker said, “The system is designed really as an audit system, and I think that hasn’t worked well enough.”\n\nOur airline safety system assumes that airplane manufacturers are also deeply invested in upholding safety standards, so the F.A.A. oversight focuses on identifying new problems, improving existing systems and auditing to make sure existing standards are properly upheld.\n\nWhat happens if a company instead focuses more on what it could get away with in terms of cost-cutting?\n\nThat’s how we get to a world where audits alone will not have “worked well enough.” The missing bolts may have caused the door to blow out, but it’s the missing corporate ethos that we should examine to understand the root cause.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nFeb. 6, 2024, 3:03 p.m. ET\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit just reaffirmed the American Revolution. In fact, as one lawyer observed immediately after the decision, the D.C. Circuit just upheld Magna Carta. That’s the meaning of its decision today to deny Donald Trump’s plea for immunity from prosecution for his acts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nTo read the court’s opinion is to take a civics lesson, one that can be summed up in a single sentence: “No man in this country is so high that he is above the law.” That quote, which the court of appeals pulled from an 1882 Supreme Court case, articulates the governing principle perfectly. And in case the phrase “no man” was ambiguous, the quote continues: “All the officers of the government, from the highest to the lowest, are creatures of the law and bound to obey it.”\n\nThe nature of the American experiment is evident from our oath of office. When you join the military, or when you’re sworn into federal service, or into Congress or the presidency, you swear an oath to our Constitution, not to our nation, and certainly not to a person. In plain language, that meant Trump swore an oath to the law, and therefore any claim that the law didn’t or doesn’t bind his actions was frivolous to the core.\n\nTrump’s argument would have inserted a vestige of monarchy into American law. It would have created a small class of super-citizens — presidents and ex-presidents — who would have combined the immense power of the office with total immunity from criminal legal accountability. There was simply no way that argument would prevail. And, looking forward to a potential Supreme Court appeal, there is no way that it will prevail.\n\nThe question now is whether the Supreme Court will even take the case. It can simply let the D.C. Circuit decision stand and allow the case to go to trial this spring.\n\nIn fact, that’s by far the preferable outcome. The American people deserve to know whether the man they might vote for committed federal crimes. The immunity argument won’t save him from prison. It can only delay the trial, and given the remarkable weakness of Trump’s immunity argument, there is no meaningful claim to adjudicate here.\n\nIt’s time for Citizen Trump to stand trial for President Trump’s conduct. SCOTUS should stand down.\n\nFeb. 6, 2024, 1:24 p.m. ET\n\nConservatives tend to assume that social policy in America works via ratchet. Some sweeping social change is ushered in by liberals. Then a conservative reaction puts some limits on the changes — but still sets a new equilibrium that’s much more left-wing than it was previously. This leaves conservatives as effective conservers of progressive victories, while the progressives themselves are free to prepare for the next big leftward lurch.\n\nThis fear, as much as fealty to Donald Trump, explains the right’s opposition to the immigration deal negotiated in the Senate. The bill is being portrayed as a victory for border hawks that the hawks themselves are turning down out of partisanship and spite. And it’s true that the bill’s provisions would almost certainly bring down unauthorized migration from its current highs.\n\nBut those highs are extraordinary. There were almost six million Border Patrol apprehensions in the first three years of the Biden administration, after a decade in which the annual number was often closer to 400,000. The population of unauthorized immigrants in the United States was pretty steady, at around 11 million, from 2005 to 2020; it has probably risen by more than two million since 2021.\n\nThe conservative assumption is that this surge is itself a policy choice — that the lower rate under Trump reflected the successful use of executive powers that President Biden could deploy without needing congressional permission. (For my part, I think Biden’s permissiveness clearly kicked off the current crisis, but Trump’s dependence on Mexican cooperation made his policy more fragile in the short run, and more in need of congressional funding and Democratic buy-in in the long run, than some conservatives would like to think.)\n\nThe fear on the right is that by formalizing but also arguably limiting presidential powers, the bill would establish a new equilibrium while partially binding the hands of a future Republican president who wanted to take a harder line. And because the current numbers are so high, such an equilibrium could genuinely reduce the numbers of people entering — while still leaving migration flows much higher than they were under Trump or Barack Obama.\n\nThat would be the leftward ratchet in action. Hence the right’s current insistence that Biden should go first, push his own powers further (which he has ample political incentives to do) and achieve some real reductions before conservatives agree to any larger renovation. From their perspective, that’s how you run the ratchet in reverse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nFeb. 6, 2024, 11:08 a.m. ET\n\nMy mother and her friends came of age in Manhattan during the heyday of the American musical. After school, they would take the bus from the Upper West Side down to the theater district. I asked her how she could afford it. “It was under $10 for orchestra, third row,” she told me. That number looked low to my 2024 eyes, so I looked it up. She was right, of course; tickets were between $3 and $9 in 1960.\n\nThat’s how she was able to see one of her favorites, “Once Upon a Mattress,” nine times between 1959, the year it debuted, and 1960. The show then starred Carol Burnett, whose vaudevillian physicality was married to great musicality in originating the role of Winnifred — Fred — the swamp princess who steals the prince’s heart and upends a royal kingdom. My sister and I knew all the words, well before I was a (somewhat begrudging) chorus member in a J.C.C. production of “Mattress” a few decades later.\n\nWhen I realized that Sutton Foster would don Fred’s sodden robes for a revival at Encores!, I knew I needed to try to gather my parents and my sister to go. At the revival, which ended its brief run at City Center on Sunday, Foster, as Elisabeth Vincentelli noted in The Times, displays an “ebullient, joyful relish in the very act of performance.” In “Mattress,” she’s hilariously all elbows and knees and leeches (she “swam the moat,” as many a cast member repeats, incredulously), and is also all energy and just a total joy to listen to. She’s pointedly ridiculous and musically on point.\n\nBut while Foster makes the show, she’s not so small-minded as to steal it. It’s one of those ensemble casts that feels thrilled by what each member brings to the stage. As soon as the jester — the marvelous J. Harrison Ghee — told us “a princess is a delicate thing,” I realized what this production does and has done since the days of Burnett: It simply has enormous fun. I’ve rarely felt such palpable joy at a performance, such lighthearted energy, such a sense of wonder and laughter. My family has had a hard year. A show like “Mattress” was a balm for a few hours.\n\nMy mother doesn’t walk well these days; she didn’t need to here. From her seat in the orchestra, she sang every word. So did nearly everyone else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nFeb. 6, 2024, 5:03 a.m. ET\n\nThe image of King Charles III at his coronation in his gold lace and ermine robe had barely faded when we learned on Monday that Charles was sick.\n\nHe had spent his life in the shadow of indelible women, and he had suffered through a portrayal on “The Crown” that was disdained by those close to him. He had only just stepped out as the powerful leading man of the royal family on the world stage when he was struck down by a double blow of illness.\n\n“It is sad,” said Sally Bedell Smith, the biographer of Charles, Diana and Queen Elizabeth, and the author of the “Royals Extra” substack. “Here he’s been waiting for this his entire life,” she told me. “He’s really exceeded expectations in terms of how he’s conducted himself, the modern touches he’s carried out, his statement on climate, his sense of where the boundaries are. He’s done everything as he should do.”\n\nAnd now he is facing cancer. Smith noted that King Charles was transparent about dealing with an enlarged prostate — and he was praised for being candid — but he has gone dark on exactly what kind of cancer he is battling. (The exact nature of the illness of Kate, the Princess of Wales, is also not known.)\n\n“Now they’re reverting to the hazy, euphemistic way of dealing with sickness — the cloud of secrecy — that the royal family has used all these years,” Smith said. “But I don’t think that this falls into the category of being invasive to ask about it because of who he is. He is a head of state.”\n\nAnd now the woman who was once scorned as “the other woman,” the third person in Diana’s marriage, as Diana told the BBC, is the queen of the United Kingdom, left to keep calm and carry on her duties alone while her husband focuses on his recovery.\n\n“Intrepid Camilla, carrying the flag for England,” Smith said, noting the ironies of the situation. “This is a woman lazing around for her whole life, an upper-class woman who liked horses and dogs and cooking a roast on a Sunday. Then she married Charles when she was 57. And now she is carrying out her royal duties on steroids.”\n\nFeb. 5, 2024, 5:50 p.m. ET\n\nTaylor Swift didn’t need to become the first person to win the Grammy for album of the year four times — surpassing Frank Sinatra, Stevie Wonder and Paul Simon — to remind the world of her command of her industry, public attention and the U.S. economy.\n\nAt the awards ceremony on Sunday night, when she also won the prize for best pop vocal album for “Midnights,” she used her acceptance speech to announce that her 11th album, “The Tortured Poets Department,” would come out in April. That was the drop that many fans, myself included, anticipated.\n\nSome of us were there in the days she packed Walmarts and performed the achingly wistful country ballad “Tim McGraw,” but we have been in mixed company for years. If you were there from the beginning, Swift’s recent ascent to total domination — brought to life through the Eras Tour — has been nostalgic and validating. But her fame is bittersweet.\n\n“Tim McGraw,” released in 2006, memorialized the summer love story of a “boy in a Chevy truck” and a girl whose eyes “put those Georgia stars to shame that night.” When the song came out, I was a teenager, too. I also pined too much for everything. What fans understood then was that Swift translated longing and antagonism in ways that transcended genre.\n\nIn the years since, Swift’s pop album “1989” won a Grammy for album of the year, in 2016. The Swiftiedom tradition of hunting for codes she hid in promotional paraphernalia went mainstream. Everyone’s cousin became a fan. Now, her base is titanic enough to warrant its own demographic survey. Her songs, often still about love, have also become about the concept of Taylor Swift.\n\nWhat do the Grammy Awards do for Swift that she hasn’t already done herself?\n\nJay-Z’s speech calling out the voters of the Recording Academy for denying Black artists its top prizes highlights how little the Grammys’ rigid idea of success should matter. The awards can blast an already dominant artist to mythic proportions, but the academy’s preferences are also a cruel reminder that there can be no omnipresence without reinvention.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nFeb. 5, 2024, 3:27 p.m. ET\n\nJoni Mitchell’s performance of “Both Sides Now” at the Grammys on Sunday night was no mere comeback party for an aging icon. Mitchell, now 80, has spent nearly a decade recovering from the effects of a brain aneurysm she suffered in 2015, which left her unable to speak or walk. Over the course of her recovery, Mitchell retaught herself how to play music and sing again, as though from scratch. She is not the artist she once was. And that was the point.\n\nMitchell looked like a beret-clad queen or an oracle. Seated in a comfy chair and lit by fake candlelight, she sang, banging her cane (scepter) for emphasis as though issuing proclamations. Her voice was no longer that of a songbird; it is slower and a register lower. But the sense of mastery was still there, with a few jazz moments of syncopated phrasing that showed not slowness but a control of the song’s meaning and cadences.\n\nTo me, it was Sinatra, Tony Bennett and Johnny Cash territory. It was not young, but it was beautiful.\n\nNotably, the lyrics of “Both Sides Now” had taken on a deeper meaning.\n\nI’ve looked at life from both sides now\n\nFrom win and lose and still somehow\n\nIt’s life’s illusions I recall\n\nI really don’t know life at all\n\nSusan Sontag, in her 1978 essay “Illness as Metaphor,” wrote of the two sides that must be relevant in Mitchell’s life right now.\n\n“Everyone who is born holds dual citizenship, in the kingdom of the well and in the kingdom of the sick,” Sontag wrote. Seen through this lens, Mitchell is reporting back from the latter kingdom majestically, with more gravitas, spirit and human dignity than ever.\n\nOr she may just be letting us know that there really aren’t two kingdoms at all. Only one.\n\nMitchell is beloved today for her lyrical honesty, her ingenious musical sophistication and her persistent refusal to heed the messages that would have kept her on the sidelines. Girls can’t be rock stars. Don’t show your feelings. When you become ill or age or lose your ability to speak and walk, you should go off somewhere and hide.\n\nShe is not having any of that, which is a lesson for those of us who must confront illness, disability and mortality. Joni Mitchell’s radical vulnerability and refusal to hide has always been her greatest strength. She’s still got it.\n\nFeb. 5, 2024, 2:30 p.m. ET\n\nMy column on Friday about detransitioners, people who no longer believe they are transgender, was a way to explore some of the problems in how we treat gender-dysphoric youth. One common response from those who favor the current treatment model, which proponents call gender-affirming care, is that very few people detransition.\n\nAre they right?\n\nIt would be great to have a definitive answer either way. But the truth is we don’t know. While some outspoken transgender activists say the rates are low, studies often cited to make this claim are demonstrably unreliable.\n\nAs I wrote in my column, “Nobody knows how many young people desist after social, medical or surgical transitions.” Admitting you don’t have an answer is hard, but it’s especially important for journalists to do so. (A number of transgender activists and writers, including the founder of a website devoted to examining “anti-trans propaganda,” have discussed their reactions to the reporting in my column.)\n\nHere is some context for readers to weigh assertions to the contrary.\n\nFirst, consider human nature: People change their minds all the time. Second, admitting to a mistake is hard for anyone — and for many detransitioners, it can feel like a very public reversal. Third, it can take a long time for transition regret to manifest, and for patients to make the decision to detransition.\n\nIt is especially hard for kids who are making decisions about their identities when those identities are still evolving. Many construct their lives around this new identity. To admit they have changed their minds, especially during the excruciatingly self-conscious period of adolescence, when they are deeply susceptible to peer judgment, is that much harder. The effects of medical transition — facial hair growth, breast growth or removal, vocal changes — are often irreversible. For some, it can feel like there’s no going back.\n\nWe do have some reliable data that indicate detransition rates are higher than transgender advocacy groups suggest. (The Society for Evidence-Based Gender Medicine, one of the most reliable nonpartisan organizations dedicated to the field, has a full explainer of the methodological problems with the studies that insist otherwise.)\n\nWe also know that more detransitioners are going public with their decisions. They deserve our compassion. There will likely be a rocky road ahead for them and everyone involved in their care. Some are currently engaged in high-profile malpractice lawsuits against those who medicalized them as minors.\n\nAs awareness grows, my hope is that more, and better, independent research on this complex issue will move forward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nFeb. 5, 2024, 11:37 a.m. ET\n\nWhen I first heard Luke Combs’s faithful-to-a-fault rendition of Tracy Chapman’s masterpiece “Fast Car,” it left me cold.\n\nYes, he is a white man who rocketed to the top of the charts with a song written by a Black woman. But the issue wasn’t appropriation. Combs failed to do what a great cover should do: reinvent a song in a way that enriches it. That is, I thought, how you know a song is a great song: It has the amplitude to receive new meanings, to plumb new and different depths of human feeling.\n\nLast night, gracing the Grammys stage for the first time since 1997 and 35 years after accepting the award for best new artist, Chapman proved me right and wrong. Her luminous skin looked as unmarked by those decades as her smoky contralto sounded. It was only the glittering silver of dreadlocks that hinted at the passage of time. Her eyes sparkled. The crowd roared.\n\nWatching Combs last night, all but trembling as he harmonized with an artist he clearly idolized, I came to appreciate what he had been up to. With apologies to Bruce Springsteen, there is nothing in the modern American songbook that matches “Fast Car” as a song about working people and the yearning for a life with dignity and freedom. It’s a song about mobility, about longing to make the seemingly impossible journey from “work in a market as a checkout girl” to “finally see what it means to be living.”\n\nCombs seems to have known that, unlike white artists who have absorbed, reinterpreted and profited from Black music throughout American history, he had nothing to add but his wholehearted endorsement. There was no mistaking who owned that song on that stage. And so at the end of his performance he genuflected to Chapman, who received a rapturous ovation.\n\nPart of me wishes this reclaiming might lead to a new burst of songwriting and performing from Chapman. She was a poet of the despair wrought by the cruel economic vision of the Reagan years. What might she have to say about the intervening decades of hurtling down that same track?\n\nBut Chapman has chosen a different path, living a private life of her own making. I hope that she is happy and fulfilled and that she is spending her royalty checks on fast cars or whatever else brings her joy.\n\nA correction was made on\n\nFeb. 5, 2024\n\n:\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the year Tracy Chapman last performed at the Grammy Awards ceremony. It is 1997, not 1989.\n\nHow we handle corrections\n\nFeb. 5, 2024, 10:24 a.m. ET\n\nThe latest target in the delirious campaign by Republican-led state governments to limit free expression is the American Library Association. Yes, the far right now considers the nation’s professional association of librarians a leftist propaganda gang.\n\nLast week the Alabama public library agency, under pressure from Gov. Kay Ivey, withdrew from the library association. In recent months, state libraries in Florida, Wyoming, Montana, Missouri and Texas did the same thing, and more states are considering the move. It would be a little comical if it weren’t so harmful.\n\nOne of the official reasons for the pullout was a now-deleted 2022 tweet by the association’s president, Emily Drabinski, in which she described herself as a “Marxist lesbian.” The invocation of her personal economic philosophy was probably impolitic — she later described it as regrettable — but Marxism hardly describes the A.L.A., an organization of nearly 50,000 librarians that dates back to 1876 whose principal goal is to promote literacy by getting books in people’s hands.\n\nWeaponizing one leader’s tweet against the entire group is really just a cover for the larger reason: The librarians oppose banning books, and Republican-led states and school boards have been lustily pulling books from shelves. One group leading the charge is called Clean Up Alabama — slogan: “Tidying up Alabama’s libraries” — which says the library association has helped put pornography and “radical gender ideologies” in the hands of children. It means any book that discusses sexuality or L.G.B.T.Q. issues.\n\nThe library association says that people should be able to choose what they want to read, that parents do have the right to determine what their children read but should not dictate to other parents, that all young people deserve to see themselves reflected in a library’s books and, ultimately, that government-sponsored censorship has no place in a country that prizes free expression.\n\nThose used to be widely shared principles. But many states have decided there’s only one way to think, and they will fight anyone who prefers an open mind. Or an open book.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nFeb. 5, 2024, 5:03 a.m. ET\n\nEvery Monday morning on The Point, we’ll kick off the week with a tip sheet on the latest in the presidential campaign.\n\nPresident Biden got a nice tailwind out of South Carolina’s Democratic presidential primary on Saturday, where he won 96 percent of the vote and reminded America of his bond with Black voters, who turned out in solid numbers for an uncompetitive primary to show they had his back. And Biden was already enjoying a bit of tailwind from the economy, with the latest Labor Department report showing surging job growth in January.\n\nSo why the grumpy text messages from some Democrats to start off the week? Sunday’s NBC News poll is the answer. The headwinds for Biden are broad and powerful.\n\nDespite that great job growth report, Donald Trump has a 22-percentage-point lead when voters are asked which candidate would do a better job handling the economy — 55 percent for Trump and 33 percent for Biden. Trump has a 35-point advantage over Biden on who would handle the border and immigration better and a 16-point advantage over Biden on being competent and effective, a reversal from 2020.\n\nBiden’s big margins of victory in the Potemkin primary race against Dean Phillips and Marianne Williamson are meaningless compared with Trump’s big margins on key measures of the electorate. Trump appears in a better position to win now than people would have imagined as recently as last fall.\n\nThe New York Times/Siena College polls published in early November captured the trend toward Trump, and Biden has struggled to turn around his low job approval ratings. Of course, horse-race poll numbers in national surveys at this point have limited value and can swing; last week’s Quinnipiac poll had Biden ahead by six points. For me, the NBC News poll is most revealing about how Biden is still struggling so badly on immigration, the economy and how people see his presidency and his effectiveness.\n\nSo I see more headwind than tailwind for Biden this week as he faces Senate and House differences on crucial immigration-Israel-Ukraine legislation and a possible vote in the House to impeach his homeland security secretary.\n\nBut there are two silver linings for Biden going into the week. One, the NBC News poll showed more evidence that people feel the economy is improving — and it takes time for a president to have a shot at getting credit for that. And two, America is still a lifetime away from the November election.\n\nFeb. 2, 2024, 4:57 p.m. ET\n\nNow that the Pentagon has launched strikes against Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria, much of the news media will be sure to describe it as retaliation for a Jan. 28 drone attack on a remote U.S. military base in Jordan, which killed three American service members and injured another 34.\n\nTrue — but not the whole truth.\n\nThe whole truth is that, since October alone, there have been some 160 attacks on American forces in Iraq and Syria, forces that are in the region principally to fight ISIS, one enemy that Iran and the U.S. have in common. In October, a drone loaded with explosives hit a U.S. barracks in Iraq. Major casualties were averted only because the explosives failed to detonate. On Christmas, another drone strike left a piece of shrapnel lodged in the head of the chief warrant officer Garrett Illerbrunn. He is recovering in the United States after spending days in a coma.\n\nThis is to say nothing of direct attacks by the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen on U.S. Navy ships protecting sea lanes in the Red Sea. Already, two members of the Navy SEAL team died there in January during an effort to seize a ship suspected of ferrying Iranian weapons to the Houthis.\n\nThe Biden administration has responded to some of these previous attacks with precision strikes — attempting to send a message to Tehran while hoping to avoid escalation. It hasn’t worked. To adapt an adage attributed to Leon Trotsky, we may not be interested in making war on Iran, but Iran is interested in making war on us.\n\nWhat could get Tehran to stand down, at least for a time? Not attacking their proxies, which are now surely dispersing their forces in anticipation of U.S. strikes. A better model was 1988’s Operation Praying Mantis, a military operation launched in retaliation for an Iranian mine that nearly sank an American frigate during a period when Tehran was constantly attacking oil shipping in the Persian Gulf.\n\nIn that daylong engagement, the U.S. Navy sank six Iranian ships and destroyed two Iranian intelligence facilities on old oil platforms. Tehran got the point. Praying Mantis helped end Iran’s attacks on international shipping, and it was one of the factors that finally persuaded Iran’s leaders to agree to an end to the Iran-Iraq war.\n\nIran has used its proxies to start fires across the Middle East. They won’t be put out until the arsonist is taken down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nFeb. 2, 2024, 3:29 p.m. ET\n\nLet me get this straight: You are prosecuting the former president of the United States — a man who is better than anyone alive at exploiting his opponents’ weaknesses — and you give him the gift of a romantic affair with the lead prosecutor of his case?\n\nFor weeks, Fani Willis, the district attorney for Fulton County, Ga., had been silent in the face of sordid accusations that she was romantically involved with the prosecutor, Nathan Wade, whom she had hired to manage her racketeering case against Donald Trump. On Friday afternoon, Willis issued a statement that was a Clintonian stew of bloodless legalisms, admitting the affair but saying it doesn’t matter.\n\nIf only she had been as formal about her romantic life. The Trump team is, predictably, trying to get her and Wade disqualified from the case, which is one of two criminal cases involving the former president’s very real attack on American democracy in 2020 and 2021. And as much as I regard Trump to be the greatest existential threat to democracy any of us has ever faced, I don’t blame the guy.\n\nWillis has paid Wade more than $650,000 and was going to pay him plenty more; while both deny that any money has benefited Willis herself, it raises the question of a conflict of interest and could be a serious ethical breach.\n\nWillis, who is Black, had the gall to claim this is about race, and that her relationship is not an issue because it only began (so she says) after she hired Wade. Whether you believe that — and Wade’s conspicuous lack of experience in racketeering cases does make one wonder — is beside the point. As someone who holds such a powerful position of public trust, she should not have gone anywhere near this sort of behavior. (As her campaign slogan put it, “Integrity matters!”)\n\nSpare me the arguments about how Willis’s personal life is unrelated to the criminal charges Trump faces. It doesn’t matter; just ask Peter Strzok. As Willis well knows, Trump wins if he can convince people that every public official is as corrupt as he is, regardless of whether it’s true. She just gave him more than he could’ve asked for.\n\nOmar said it best on “The Wire”: “You come at the king, you best not miss.” Now the whole country may pay dearly for Willis’s terrible aim.\n\nA correction was made on\n\nFeb. 2, 2024\n\n:\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the number of cases in which Donald Trump is accused of election interference.

I’ll leave it to friends and family to describe the man they loved. I’m just a fan of his work, mainly in the “Rocky” franchise or his glorious role in “Predator,” a movie that featured the greatest handshake in film history. His self-deprecating turn in “Arrested Development” was priceless, and I love anyone associated with the sheer joy that is “The Mandalorian.”\n\nI’m a fan, not a film critic. That means I go to the movie theater mainly for fun. Certainly there are films that can open my eyes or change my heart, but, mostly, I want to have an enjoyable evening with friends and family. And if the movie is truly good at what it aims to do, the fun endures — especially as scenes and characters become imprinted in pop culture and become part of our shared national language.\n\nEntertainment for entertainment’s sake is an indispensable aspect of the good life. And it requires people who commit to the bit, who act the heck out of an absurdist introduction at a boxing match or who commit to inhabiting the role of the “High Magistrate of Nevarro” in a show about a baby Yoda.\n\nI know he played other roles, and I’m certainly not qualified to comment on the depth and breadth of his work. But here’s what I know — Carl Weathers brought joy to millions of us, as his moments onscreen became part of the fabric of our lives. I’m so sad to hear of his passing. May God bless and comfort his family. And thank you, Mr. Weathers, for bringing us joy. Lord knows we need it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nFeb. 2, 2024, 2:53 p.m. ET\n\nThe Grammys this year are already being lauded as a banner year for women. Female artists dominate the four major categories — best album, record, song and new artist — a sign that, for now at least, the power of the music industry is female.\n\nBut when the awards are presented on Sunday night, there will be one general category in which women are conspicuously absent: producer of the year, nonclassical. In the nearly half a century since it was first presented in 1975, no woman has won it. Few have even been nominated.\n\nThis exemplifies an endemic problem. According to a report by the Annenberg School at the University of Southern California, only 6.5 percent of the most popular songs in 2023 were produced by women. That’s a record high.\n\nIt is challenging, as a casual listener, to parse the contributions of a producer from those of the artist, especially when it comes to pop music. A few producers are recognizable for their consistent sound: Jack Antonoff’s burbling synths, Max Martin’s sterile melodies, Finneas’s penchant for dumping an entire office supply store onto a single track. But recognizable or not, producers are the tastemakers of their industry. At best, they foster sonic cohesion and a collaborative working environment and, most crucially, push artists to create the best music of their lives.\n\nThis year, a woman did just that. Her name is Catherine Marks (great name, no relation). She co-produced the brilliant indie-rock record from the supergroup boygenius (“The Record”). Their album is a delicate, spare and egoless production, with deliberate emphasis placed on balancing the vocal performance of three leads. While Marks is not nominated for producer of the year, she could take home a Grammy if “The Record” wins in other categories.\n\nBoygenius chose to work with Marks. Through this choice, it is instructing its contemporaries. Artists — and, yes, their labels — have the power to choose who produces their work and foster up-and-coming female producers, mixers and engineers. If power in the music industry now lies in the hands of women, then so do the choices — and perhaps with different ones, structural inequality will begin to change.\n\nFeb. 2, 2024, 2:23 p.m. ET\n\nNikki Haley’s insurgent run for her party’s nomination, which has left her the last credible challenger to Donald Trump, is proof of concept for her tightrope-walking approach to declining to endorse or completely rebuke him. Her biggest campaign trail fumble — not identifying slavery as the cause of the Civil War — can mostly be chalked up to a lapse on the stump.\n\nBut when Haley was asked, in an interview that aired Wednesday on Charlamagne tha God’s radio show, what she didn’t like about Barack Obama’s presidency, her answer was just plain unserious.\n\nShe said that during Obama’s tenure, the country “became more about gender, it became more about race, it became more about separating Americans instead of bringing them together.”\n\nIs she unhappy he appointed only women to the Supreme Court? Did she forget that in the wake of the Mother Emanuel massacre, he salved the nation by singing “Amazing Grace”?\n\nHas Haley not noticed that her reflections on race in America often sound just like Obama’s? In her campaign launch video, Haley said that growing up, “I was the proud daughter of Indian immigrants” and “my parents reminded me and my siblings every day how blessed we were to live in America.” In his 2004 address to the Democratic National Convention, Obama said, “I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me and that in no other country on earth is my story even possible.”\n\nIn January, Haley told CNN’s Jake Tapper, “America is not perfect, we have our stains, we know that, but our goal should always be to make today better than yesterday.” In a 2008 speech on race, Obama said, “This union may never be perfect, but generation after generation has shown that it can always be perfected.”\n\nBlaming Obama for dividing America comes across as a sort of throwback to the 2000s, when he was heckled as a “dithering” “socialist” “celebrity.” As transparent as it was, even Donald Trump’s unvarnished pitch to Black voters in 2016, “What do you have to lose?” had more authenticity than her sketch of Obama the divider.\n\nThere are plenty of legitimate criticisms to lob at Obama, but here, Haley has a real blind spot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nFeb. 2, 2024, 12:35 p.m. ET\n\nUpdate: After this post was published, Mr. Friedman responded to readers in a follow-up post.\n\nMy guess is that the next week or so is likely to be the most important in the Gaza war since Hamas launched it on Oct. 7.\n\nThe U.S. will probably retaliate against pro-Iranian forces and Iranian agents in the Middle East that Washington believes are responsible for the attack on a U.S. base in Jordan that killed three soldiers on Jan. 28. At the same time, we could get a Gaza cease-fire deal, with an exchange of Israeli hostages held by Hamas for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. And Secretary of State Antony Blinken is going to try to bring to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel an option: normalization with Saudi Arabia in return for a commitment to engage with the Palestinian Authority on a long-term plan for a Palestinian state.\n\nHow all of these are going to interact, I do not know. Personally, I sometimes prefer to think about the complex relations between these parties with analogies from the natural world.\n\nThe U.S. is like an old lion. We are still the king of the Middle East jungle — more powerful than any single actor, but we have so many scars from so many fights that we just can’t just show up, roar loudly and expect that everyone will do what we want or scamper away. We are one tired lion, and that’s why other predators are no longer afraid to test us.\n\nIran is to geopolitics what a recently discovered species of parasitoid wasp is to nature. What does this parasitoid wasp do? According to Science Daily, the wasp “injects its eggs into live caterpillars, and the baby wasp larvae slowly eat the caterpillar from the inside out, bursting out once they have eaten their fill.”\n\nIs there a better description of Lebanon, Yemen, Syria and Iraq today? They are the caterpillars. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is the wasp. The Houthis, Hezbollah, Hamas and Kataib Hezbollah are the eggs that hatch inside the host — Lebanon, Yemen, Syria and Iraq — and eat it from the inside out.\n\nWe have no counterstrategy that safely and efficiently kills the wasp without setting fire to the whole jungle.\n\nHamas is like the trap-door spider. The way trap-door spiders operate, according to a nature site, is that “the spider leaps out at great speed, seizes its prey and hauls it back into the burrow to be devoured, all in a fraction of a second.” Trap-door spiders are adept at camouflaging the doors of their underground nests, so they are hard to see until they’re opened.\n\nFinally, Netanyahu is like the sifaka lemur, which I got to observe in Madagascar. Sifakas are primates that use bipedal sideways hopping as a primary means of walking. They advance by moving sideways, waving their arms up and down, which makes them appear to be moving even more than they are. That’s Bibi, always shifting side to side to stay in power and avoiding going decisively backward or forward. This week he may have to.\n\nSometimes I contemplate the Middle East by watching CNN. Other times, I prefer Animal Planet.\n\nFeb. 2, 2024, 11:18 a.m. ET\n\nThe U.S. labor market is not as strong as it appears from today’s employment report, which said 353,000 jobs were added in January.\n\nThis chart gives a darker picture. It shows the change over the past 12 months in aggregate hours worked per week in the private sector. (In other words, all the workers times the number of hours per worker.)\n\nThe number almost always grows outside of recessions. As you can see, the change over the 12 months through January was just 0.3 percent. That was the lowest since the aftermath of the Covid recession.\n\nHow could it be that the total number of hours worked barely rose when the number of jobs grew rapidly? Simple: The growth has been in part-time jobs, which involve fewer hours.\n\n“All of the jobs the American economy is adding are part-time and the average workweek fell to 34.1 hours — that is recession territory!” ING’s chief international economist, James Knightley, wrote in a quick take after the jobs report.\n\nWhat’s more, the survey of establishments that produced the 353,000 increase isn’t the only measure of job growth. There’s also a survey of households. That’s the one that’s used to calculate the unemployment rate. According to the household survey, the number of jobs fell in January by 31,000.\n\nI wouldn’t go so far as to say this was a weak jobs report. It’s more of a contradictory one. There are very strong signs, including the increase in payrolls and the surprisingly big increase in average hourly earnings (up 0.6 percent in January from December, compared to expectations of 0.3 percent).\n\nBut it would be folly to ignore the signs of weakness. The risk of an economic downturn is still very real.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nFeb. 2, 2024, 5:03 a.m. ET\n\nWhen I talk to Democratic strategists about the swing states President Biden must win in November to be re-elected and I ask about Michigan, I’m usually met with the same response: laughter.\n\nThe reason: It’s gallows humor. If Biden can’t win Michigan, then forget it. Wisconsin, Arizona, probably Pennsylvania — those swing states will probably be even harder to win, and they will surely be lost if Biden is in such trouble that he can’t win even Michigan, for much of my lifetime the most Democratic of battleground states.\n\nAll of this was on my mind as the president visited Michigan on Thursday. I remember how Hillary Clinton largely took Michigan for granted in 2016, with some of her advisers predicting a five-point victory there. On election night, one Clinton aide very nervously told me that the numbers in Michigan would turn around for her. It sounded like denial. Donald Trump edged her out by nearly 11,000 votes.\n\nThis November, Biden can lose Arizona and Georgia (his surprise Sun Belt pick-up states in 2020) and still win the general election as long as he holds on to the traditional blue wall of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nSome Democrats think Michigan will be the easiest for him, given the abortion issue and the growing Democratic wins there in the past few years. But other Democrats are concerned that the state’s large Arab American population, which voted strongly for Biden in 2020, might not back the president in November because of his support for Israel’s war in Gaza.\n\nIn addition, Michigan — perhaps more than any other swing state — could be affected by third-party and other minor candidates, as the Democratic strategist Doug Sosnik told me. In 2016 votes for these candidates (roughly 275,000 of them) cost Clinton Michigan. Sosnik said most of them would have gone to her in a two-person race.\n\nBiden beat Trump in Michigan in 2020 by 2.8 percentage points. A New York Times/Siena College poll in Michigan last fall had Trump ahead of Biden by five points.\n\nPolls change, of course — a new Quinnipiac national poll on Wednesday had Biden leading Trump by 6 percentage points, with more women moving to Biden. But elections are won and lost in states, thanks to the Electoral College. So keep your eyes on those Biden trips to Michigan this year; there will be more of them.\n\nFeb. 1, 2024, 3:00 p.m. ET\n\nChristopher Orr and\n\nOscar Bait is The Point’s series of conversations about films nominated for the Academy Award for best picture. Today, Christopher Orr, an editor in Opinion who was once a film critic, discusses “Maestro” with Vanessa Mobley, OpEd Editor.\n\nChristopher Orr , an editor in Opinion\n\nI think it’s fair to say “Maestro” is in the middle class of this year’s Oscar nominees generally: It’s neither an awards-season juggernaut nor a beloved indie. It’s in the running for a number of the major awards, but it’s unlikely to win any of them when the statuettes get handed out in March.\n\nThat said, you and I both liked the movie quite a lot.\n\nVanessa Mobley , OpEd Editor\n\nI watched it for a second time last night. What an intimate film it is — so many scenes are framed around Leonard Bernstein (Bradley Cooper) and Felicia Montealegre (Carey Mulligan) — so much so that it seems as if the rest of the world sort of melts away.\n\nI don’t know whether or not the movie will be taken seriously by the academy, but I will say that I cannot imagine one of the principals winning without the other one. Somehow, Cooper and Mulligan have translated to those watching this movie the feeling that Leonard and Felicia seem to be having of one another — total fascination.\n\nChristopher Orr\n\nI love that. I’m not usually a fan of artist biopics, which too often neglect the art in favor of scenes of mental illness or addiction or the like — with the implication that that’s where the art comes from. One could make the case that “Maestro” does something similar with Leonard and Felicia’s marriage, I suppose, but it’s all played in such an elegant, ambivalent minor key.\n\nVanessa Mobley\n\nPlease tell me more about why you are not a fan of artist biopics. I’ll admit I am.\n\nChristopher Orr\n\nThe creation of art tends to be highly uncinematic, so you’re too often offered the artist’s drunken tantrums or rampant womanizing or something else that’s more dramatic.\n\nBut let me shift gears a moment and express my profound annoyance at the academy’s failure to nominate Cooper for best director. “Maestro” is an auteur film! This is the second time in a row, after “A Star Is Born,” that he’s been overlooked as director. It’s bizarre.\n\nVanessa Mobley\n\nSo maybe Cooper isn’t Laurence Olivier or Roberto Benigni (who both took home Oscars for acting in films they directed). But the entirety of “Maestro” is his as much as “Barbie” is Greta Gerwig’s.\n\nChristopher Orr\n\nAnd Gerwig wasn’t nominated for best director, either. A tremendously frustrating category.\n\nAnother note on Cooper as a director: He gets great performances not only from himself and from A-list actors (Mulligan is sublime in “Maestro”) but also from performers you might not expect, like Lady Gaga in “A Star Is Born” and Sarah Silverman in “Maestro.”\n\nVanessa Mobley\n\nFor a movie that moves from black and white to color, from love to vitriol to reconciliation, “Maestro” is a trip. It’s a movie that struck me as deeply felt — contrary to the views of many film critics. (Of whom I am not one! A humble viewer.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nFeb. 1, 2024, 1:02 p.m. ET\n\nAt the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Wednesday on online child sexual exploitation, perhaps the most dramatic moment came when Mark Zuckerberg, the C.E.O. of the company that owns Facebook and Instagram, turned around and stood up to face parents holding up photos of their children who had died by suicide after sexual abuse or extortion via a social media platform.\n\n“I’m sorry for everything you have all been through,” Zuckerberg said to them.\n\nHere, reasonable voices might intervene. An unbearable tragedy, certainly, they might say, but such tragedies have occurred before social media came along. Let’s not lose proper historical and individual context when talking about the mental health and well-being of children, they might point out.\n\nAll of that is technically correct, but fundamentally wrong. And one senator got to the heart of it.\n\n“Platforms need to hand over more content about how the algorithms work, what the content does and what the consequences are, not at the aggregate, not at the population level, but the actual numbers of cases so we can understand the content,” said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware. He said he was sponsoring a bill with that requirement, setting new standards for disclosure and transparency, and posed the question forthrightly for Zuckerberg and the C.E.O.s of TikTok, Snap, X and Discord:\n\n“Is there any one of you willing to say now that you support this bill?”\n\nThe answer was … silence. Crickets. Not one C.E.O. would commit. “Mr. Chairman, let the record reflect a yawning silence from the leaders of the social media platforms,” Coons noted, with resignation.\n\nThe platforms have nearly absolute immunity as an industry. Thanks to Section 230, they generally cannot be sued and held liable for tragic events even if they were facilitated by their product; they get to keep all the profits made from these products. And yet when the public asks for meaningful transparency and data — so that it’s not just an appeal to emotion that results in legislation — the public is told, basically, to pound sand.\n\nWe wouldn’t accept this from any other industry, and we should not accept it from technology companies. And that’s the most important point anyone should make until legislators start passing bipartisan bills that force meaningful transparency on these companies, which could finally allow proper accountability and reasonable oversight.\n\nFeb. 1, 2024, 10:15 a.m. ET\n\nLow-income school children who suffered catastrophic learning losses while schools were shuttered during the pandemic will never catch up — and will see their life chances greatly diminished — unless federal, state, and local governments develop a sense of urgency about aiding them. That message comes through very clearly in a new analysis of standardized test performance led by researchers at Stanford and Harvard.\n\nThe analysis considered test data for students in third through eighth grades in 30 states. Examining test score declines from 2019 to 2022 and recovery data as of spring of 2023, researchers were pleasantly surprised to find some improvement. But as my Times colleagues reported today, the poor students who fell furthest behind have not improved nearly enough and “are at a greater disadvantage today than they were five years ago.”\n\nProfessor Sean F. Reardon of Stanford worries that “inequality is getting baked in.” Similarly, Thomas J. Kane of Harvard warns that most states are on a path that will force “poor children to foot the bill for the pandemic.”\n\nIt has been clear since last year that learning loss would remain a problem when a federal aid package targeted at the pandemic expires in September. Kane is urging the states to spend every cent of the remaining money on academic recovery — including summer school, high-quality tutoring and after-school instruction, but others are calling for more creative steps to be taken.\n\nFor example, The Center for Research on Education Outcomes at Stanford University has called on schools to increase the pace at which students learn. One way to do that would be to offer the best teachers more money to take additional students into their classes.\n\nThe new learning loss data arrives at a time when Americans are eager to put the Covid nightmare behind them.\n\nBut the country will pay a terrible price if it fails to help the children who continue to be hobbled by pandemic-era setbacks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nFeb. 1, 2024, 5:03 a.m. ET\n\nIt’s always interesting to watch the news conferences that Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, conducts after meetings of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. Powell’s task is to stay on message, while reporters try to get him to say something new and different.\n\nWhen inflation was surging, reporters focused on what the Fed was doing to get it back down. On Wednesday, most of the questions revolved around whether the Fed is perhaps too concerned about inflation, and risks slowing down the economy too much by keeping interest rates unnecessarily high.\n\nPowell spoke half an hour after the release of the official statement by the Federal Open Market Committee, which he leads. In a nod to progress in getting inflation down, the committee did stop hinting at further rate increases. As someone who favors reducing interest rates, I thought that was a positive.\n\nBut it didn’t cut rates, and Powell didn’t give any indication that the committee would vote to do so at its next meeting, in March.\n\nUnder Powell’s leadership, the rate-setting committee seems to be waiting for an unnecessary degree of certainty about victory over inflation. The problem is that any attempt to vanquish inflation inevitably increases the risk of recession.\n\nIn my newsletter Wednesday, I featured a chart of the “real” federal funds interest rate — that is, the rate after adjustment for inflation. It has risen by nearly eight percentage points since early 2022, which is an enormous increase that puts stress on both consumer and business borrowers.\n\nInflation reduces the real cost of borrowing by eroding the value of future dollars, so when inflation falls, as it has been doing, that cost goes up. That’s what’s been happening. At the news conference, a reporter asked Powell about that. He answered that while the Fed does pay attention to the real federal funds rate, “that doesn’t mean we can mechanically adjust policy as inflation comes down.”\n\nOK, I get that. But people need to understand that the Fed’s monetary policy is getting tighter and tighter the more inflation comes down, even if the Fed’s interest rate remains locked in at its current level.\n\nJan. 31, 2024, 3:04 p.m. ET\n\nLook out, presidential geezers, Nikki Haley is going there.\n\nAs part of its saucier, late-in-the-game ’tude, Team Haley said it was rolling out a new campaign series — online videos, emails and so on — smacking both Donald Trump and Joe Biden as doddering, past-their-prime “Grumpy Old Men.”\n\nThe campaign announced that the cheeky new effort, whose title echoes that of a 1993 rom-com, will feature such piquant themes as “Basement Buddies,” pinging the former and current presidents for not being up to vigorous campaigning; “Debate Dodgers,” accusing them of not wanting “to put their mental decline front and center on the debate stage”; and “Stumbling Seniors,” which is pretty self-explanatory.\n\nThis may strike some folks as ageist or gratuitously snarky — a Hail Mary from a floundering campaign desperate for traction. I see it more as a public service, with Haley channeling a concern shared by many, many Americans.\n\nOn the campaign trail and in polls, large numbers of voters are voicing their distress at the idea of a November rematch between two not-so-fresh faces, both of whom look to have lost a couple of steps, albeit in different ways. Biden’s age provokes more apparent angst, at least in part because he comes across as more hesitant and fragile. Trump is bombastic and pugilistic, more like a ragey toddler. He doesn’t seem as physically frail, but if you watch him ramble and rant, the guy is clearly no longer at the top of his game. With both contenders, the word “slippage” comes to mind.\n\nSelf-serving though the effort may be, Haley is behaving in an unusually bipartisan fashion by calling out both parties for preparing to send … um, historically seasoned quarterbacks into the Big Game. Is the move likely to revive her candidacy? Nah. But there’s no disputing that, with this issue at least, she has her finger on the pulse of the American public.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nJan. 31, 2024, 2:06 p.m. ET\n\nI didn’t expect much during a recent visit to the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It currently has an exhibition called “Women Dressing Women” that features the work of over 70 women’s wear designers, dating back to around 1910.\n\nThe fashion world has never seemed to me a very healthy place. Magazines in the ’80s and ’90s featured models so thin that I could never hope to match them. By elevating such a narrow beauty standard, the fashion world contributed to the societal push to denigrate women who had the misfortune of taking up too much space.\n\nThat message had been internalized and passed down in my social circle. Laments over weight from my mother, aunts, coach, friends — even Oprah — made clear that carrying a few extra pounds was a horrible way to go through life. It took me years to develop the armor I needed to ignore this onslaught.\n\nThere are signs that things might be improving. In the mall, you’ll occasionally see a mannequin that looks closer to the size 16 that is now the average for American women. Commercials, dance groups and TV shows often include women with a variety of body types.\n\nStill, I go into a high-fashion space with the proper disdain for what I will encounter. I found myself surprised when I read the introductory wall text at the Met, where the museum said it had acquired “clothing made for a variety of body types” for the exhibition. Would I actually be … OK with this high-fashion display?\n\nI wasn’t. The exhibition featured a male mannequin, another based on a model with achondroplasia and one based on a model with cerebral palsy who uses a wheelchair, all of which were admirable. But typical rounder women’s bodies, so common in the world, were represented with exactly one slightly larger mannequin, out of over 70 featured. I stared at it in recognition, then observed the sea of very thin mannequins that surrounded it with a pang. The mannequins were up on pedestals, surrounded by another sea of real people, including many young women, eagerly taking it all in.\n\nThe Met might see a single larger mannequin as progress. Perhaps it is, in its way. But I would say its math is still way off.\n\nJan. 31, 2024, 10:59 a.m. ET\n\nIt’s been more than three weeks since the federal appeals court in Washington heard oral arguments in one of the most consequential — and most straightforward — cases in living memory: Donald Trump’s claim of total immunity from prosecution for his starring role in the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nWith all due respect to the judges on the second-highest court in the land, what on earth is taking so long? Yes, the wheels of justice grind slowly, etc., but they don’t have to, especially not when the case is an easy one and the entire country is waiting to find out if one of the two likely major-party candidates for president is a convicted criminal. Each day that goes by makes it more likely Trump will not face trial for his attempt to overthrow the last election before he runs in the next one.\n\nA brief refresher: The trial was scheduled to begin on March 4. Everything was moving ahead normally until Trump tried to stop the action by claiming he cannot be prosecuted for anything, ever. This argument is absurd on its face. The trial judge, Tanya Chutkan, would have been within her rights to toss it out as frivolous. She didn’t, because unlike Trump, she takes the rule of law seriously.\n\nJudge Chutkan heard the arguments and ruled promptly against Trump, whose tenure, she said, “did not bestow on him the divine right of kings to evade the criminal accountability that governs his fellow citizens.” This is without question the correct ruling. Trump knows this, but he appealed it anyway, because he knows that an immunity claim is one of the few things that stops a trial in its tracks until it is resolved, and his entire goal is endless delay.\n\nThis isn’t a complicated matter for the appeals court. Every working woman and man in America has to meet deadlines all the time; every litigant before judges has to meet deadlines. Come to think of it, judges are almost the only workers in America who are rarely required to meet deadlines. This is one of those times. They work for the American people, and democracy is on the line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nJan. 31, 2024, 5:03 a.m. ET\n\nI’ve trained my Netflix algorithm to search for shows about betrayal, revenge, murder and lives ruined.\n\nSo naturally I was intrigued by Ryan Murphy’s FX series starting Wednesday night, “Feud: Capote vs. the Swans.” It spins the saga of one of the greatest betrayals in literary history, when the famous writer of “In Cold Blood” coldly turned his gimlet eye on his best friends, the stylish women who were the gatekeepers of New York society.\n\nJon Robin Baitz, who co-wrote the show with Murphy, told me that the women “clung to each other so as not to go insane. How long can you go to a private fitting with Givenchy and not begin to feel like you’re drowning in Chantilly lace? And your men are fornicating power devils and betraying you from the moment they wake up to the moment they fall asleep every day? And you go with the flow and take comfort in the Van Cleef & Arpels apology they give you or the Pissarro that shows up on your bed.”\n\nMurphy wanted to give viewers a double dose of nostalgia. “It shows us that last gasp of New York society, when women wore gloves and used finger bowls and went to four-hour lunches where they drank and smoked,” he said. “But we’re also examining another type of nostalgia for the female stars of the ’90s, who had to get through that gantlet of tremendous tabloid journalism at the time and whom we have missed and are so glad to have back.”\n\nI wasn’t sure which swan to request an interview with for The Times’s Styles section. They were all fascinating veteran actresses: Naomi Watts, Diane Lane, Chloë Sevigny, Calista Flockhart and Molly Ringwald. (And then there are Demi Moore and Jessica Lange, who are swan adjacent.)\n\nI chose Flockhart because she had been a big part of my life — from afar. I loved her hit shows, “Ally McBeal” and “Brothers and Sisters.” The latter was created by Baitz, and he said the holiday columns about my politically divided family had helped inspire it.\n\nWhen I asked for the interview, Flockhart’s publicist called to say she wanted to make sure I knew that the 59-year-old actress’s character wasn’t the lead swan. (Watts plays Swan No. 1, that epitome of elegance Babe Paley, the wife of the longtime CBS chief Bill Paley. Flockhart plays Lee Radziwill.)\n\nVery unusual to play down your role, I thought.\n\nWhen I interview celebrities, I’m prepared for them to be glamorous creatures from another planet. But Flockhart seemed like someone you’d want to hang out with here on Earth.\n\n“She’s not a Hollywood actor,” Baitz said. “She’s a strange salamander that lives in her own rainforest. She has a strangely rich, quiet inner life.”\n\nMurphy was thrilled with all his swans and happy that Flockhart emerged from her private rainforest to be part of his show. The Master of Macabre gave her his highest compliment: She makes a very, very good viper.\n\nJan. 30, 2024, 4:30 p.m. ET\n\nIf you missed Stephen Carter’s essay for The New York Times Magazine last weekend, it’s worth finding it online. I’ve long been a fan of Carter’s work — I wrote about his 1991 book, “Reflections of an Affirmative Action Baby,” last year — and his superb debut novel, “The Emperor of Ocean Park,” is set to be a TV series.\n\nIn print, Carter’s essay bore the headline “Why Free Speech Matters,” but this isn’t another piece bemoaning campus protests and cancellations. Instead, Carter asks a more fundamental question: What is a college education for?\n\n“The classroom is, first and foremost, a place to train young minds toward a yearning for knowledge and a taste for argument — to be intellectually curious — even if what they wind up discovering challenges their most cherished convictions,” Carter writes. If students aren’t able to speak up and take risks without fear of censure or censorship, their education fails them.\n\n“Impediments to free speech are impediments to free thought,” Carter explains. “That’s why academic freedom is so precious.” College, in other words, isn’t meant to affirm beliefs; it’s intended to push people to find out what they don’t know. That’s impossible without true academic freedom.\n\nCarter’s words certainly resonate with me. With one of my three kids in college and another applying, I’ve been thinking about college’s purpose. Today, high school graduates are expected to be directed in their academic choices and career plans, even at liberal arts schools.\n\nWhen I went to school in the ’90s, I chose classes according to my personal curiosities. My freshman year, I took surveys in European history and in English literature because I didn’t feel well informed on either, but also astronomy, anthropology, existentialism and studio art because they piqued my interest. It never once occurred to me what “use” they might be. Though I was on financial aid, I never saw my college education as a financial investment.\n\nAt a time when so many people view college as vocational training and judge it according to its return on investment — with the student somehow a product — Carter’s concerns may seem old fashioned. But most parents also want to raise thoughtful, engaged, curious human beings.\n\nOur nation’s complex problems require critical and creative thinking. We would do well to think more about just what kind of education we want to provide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nJan. 30, 2024, 2:59 p.m. ET\n\nHas the United States really reduced its dependence on imports from China? Or is it just buying stuff from China that’s being rerouted through other countries?\n\nAccording to a report by a unit of Bank of America that came out on Monday, it depends on the country. If goods are coming from Vietnam, “the country must be rerouting Chinese products to the U.S.” to some extent, said the report by a team led by Antonio Gabriel, a global economist. However, in the case of Mexico, the report said, it’s unlikely that an “increase in Mexico’s exports to the U.S. is due to rerouting.”\n\nThe shift away from direct imports from China began under President Donald Trump and has continued under President Biden. But the U.S. economy won’t truly be decoupled from China if the nations it buys from are becoming more tightly coupled with it.\n\nUnder U.S. trade law, a country must “substantially transform” a product to be considered the country of origin. Rerouting can be a way to evade the high tariffs on Chinese goods by changing the country of origin. That would be illegal. But violations can be unintentional, and some cases fall into a gray area, Scott Lincicome, the vice president of general economics at the Cato Institute, told me. In a statement to me, BofA Securities, the bank unit, said it looked solely at the economic aspects of trade between jurisdictions, such as the effects on foreign direct investment, productivity, economic growth and currency exchange rates.\n\nVietnam has increased its exports to the United States by 13 percent of its gross domestic product since 2018, making it the nation with the biggest increase in market share of U.S. imports. At the same time, it increased its imports from China by about 7 percent of its gross domestic product, the report said, making it “hard to believe rerouting is not taking place.”\n\nMexico is also buying more from China, but more for its own consumption, the report said. What’s more, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement doesn’t allow goods from Mexico to qualify for exemptions from tariffs if they don’t have sufficient local content.\n\nThere’s a way to reduce rerouting that would be good for the United States, which is seeking to diversify its imports, and for its rising trading partners. Vietnam and Mexico — and other countries that have taken market share from China such as Taiwan, South Korea, India and Thailand — could do more of the manufacturing themselves. The more value those countries add, the more money they will earn. And the less the world will have to depend on China’s manufacturing might.\n\nJan. 30, 2024, 12:56 p.m. ET\n\nNo one survives like Madonna survives.\n\nThe 65-year-old Queen of Pop reminded us of that on Monday night during her concert at Madison Square Garden, recalling how she spent 48 hours in a medically induced coma last June as she fought complications from a bacterial infection.\n\nThis legend, this icon, this all-time-favorite singer of mine, who had hip replacement surgery in 2020, had just spent 90 minutes singing, dancing, grinding, writhing, high-kicking and vamping in all her glory when she paused to make a point about what it means to have strength and stamina and survival instincts in this brutal world.\n\nHolding a guitar in the center of a packed Garden, she said she wanted to serenade one of her caregivers who was in the audience, a woman named Marie who nursed her at home and rallied her spirits when she didn’t know if she’d recover.\n\n“She took care of me like she was my mother,” Madonna said, her voice cracking. “Marie, I was waiting for you to come here so I could sing to you.”\n\n“She slept in the room next to me. She helped me go to the bathroom. I could not walk. You people don’t understand — it is a miracle that I’m standing here right now.”\n\nMadonna recalled that in moments of despair, she asked Marie if she was ever going to get better, if her legs would stop swelling, if she would ever move again.\n\n“She would pat me on the head and look me in the eye, and say, ‘You’re a strong girl, you’re gonna make it,’” Madonna recalled.\n\nAnd then Madonna strummed the chords of Gloria Gaynor’s “I Will Survive” and sang, “At first I was afraid, I was petrified / Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side.”\n\nI’m glad that biopic of Madonna is in limbo so she can focus on this concert tour. The woman can only do so much. If I said a little prayer as I watched her dance around to “Like a Prayer,” thinking of that new hip of hers, I was also thrilled by her energy and endurance. She is and will always be a model for younger performers everywhere who complain they cannot deal with the world.\n\nThe world is hard. Life is hard. Thank God for the caregivers.

The idea makes many people uncomfortable, and that’s understandable. But paying taxes is not a private act. Property tax records are public, and there are clear benefits in making income tax records public, too.\n\nAs I wrote in a 2019 essay, perhaps the most important benefit is that sunlight makes it harder to avoid taxation. In Norway, where tax records have long been treated as public records, a newspaper started putting the information on its website in 2001. One study estimated that the publicity caused a 3.1 percent increase in the amount of income reported by self-employed Norwegians.\n\nTransparency also makes tax policy tangible, informing public debate. The records Littlejohn stole reveal the astonishing variety of ways that wealthy Americans avoid taxes, providing a blueprint for reform.\n\nAnd it’s not just about the wealthy. If tax data were publicly available, Lilly Ledbetter might have learned a lot sooner that she was making less than the male workers at her factory.\n\nLittlejohn’s lawyers said in a court filing that he decided to leak Trump’s tax returns after reading my 2019 essay; he grasped the problem, but not the prescription.\n\nWhen Congress first imposed an income tax between 1861 and 1872, the government published the names of taxpayers as well as their incomes and the amounts they paid. In 1924, following the enactment of the modern income tax, Congress again made income and tax payments public records, which one senator described as “the price of liberty.” Wealthy Americans hated the publicity and soon convinced Congress that tax returns should be treated as state secrets.\n\nLittlejohn was wrong to break that law, but we should all be trying to change it.\n\nJan. 30, 2024, 10:50 a.m. ET\n\nWhom the gods would destroy, they first make obsessed with the stock market.\n\nThere are three crucial rules about the relationship between stock prices and broader concerns: First, the stock market is not the economy. Second, the stock market is not the economy. Third, the stock market is not the economy.\n\nBut don’t tell Donald Trump, who treated a rising stock market during his presidency as proof of his economic prowess. And the fact that the market has been hitting new highs under President Biden is clearly driving Trump crazy, leading to outbursts like the one he posted on social media yesterday, claiming that investors are driving stock prices higher because they think Trump will win in November.\n\nTaking credit for rising stock prices is silly even if you are the president; claiming credit when you aren’t is — can I say this? — demented. And it adds to what has always puzzled me most about the Trump phenomenon: Why don’t more voters see him as a ridiculous figure?\n\nSo why are stock prices rising? In general, trying to explain stock fluctuations is a mug’s game. But for what it’s worth, there has been a lot of economic news that should be good for stocks. Recession risks, and hence risks to profits, have faded. At the same time, plunging inflation has led to expectations of lower interest rates.\n\nNone of which is to say that the market surge is fully justified by fundamentals. I worry in particular that we may be seeing a tech bubble resembling that of the late 1990s.\n\nBut one thing I think we can say for sure is that the market isn’t being driven by Trump’s polling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nJan. 30, 2024, 5:02 a.m. ET\n\nSenator Richard Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, is deeply proud that he got the Senate to confirm two federal district judges in Indiana and one in South Carolina last week, with the permission of four home-state Republicans. One judge, Cristal Brisco, will be the first Black judge and the first woman of color on the federal trial bench in northern Indiana, and the other, Jacquelyn Austin, will be the only Black woman serving as a federal district judge in South Carolina. Both are impressive achievements for the Biden administration.\n\nBut the need to negotiate with Republicans in the first place demonstrates the significant problem caused by the Democratic attachment to archaic rules in the Senate. Presidents should be able to appoint the judges they want, and if a majority of the Senate agrees, those nominees should get a gavel and a robe. Instead, Durbin is clinging to an old tradition that requires home-state senators to give their permission — known as a blue slip — before any judge can be considered.\n\nIt’s not only archaic, it’s undemocratic, as the editorial board has written, and it’s the reason Democrats are falling behind Donald Trump’s record of appointing judges. As my colleague Carl Hulse reported on Sunday, Democrats have confirmed only 171 of Biden’s nominees, making it unlikely they will catch up to Trump’s 234 confirmations. It’s all because Republicans have blocked or slow-walked Biden’s choices.\n\nDurbin could single-handedly end the practice and stop requiring Republican blue slips, but he won’t because he’s afraid that would set a precedent for Senate Republicans to force through MAGA judges if they retake the Senate and Trump wins in November. That could happen, but here’s the reality everyone but Durbin seems to know: Trump and his allies aren’t going to honor that tradition, even if Democrats preserve it for now. If he wins, he and his movement will muscle through all the judges they want.\n\nWhich is why Biden and Durbin should start doing so now, while they still have the chance. Durbin says “it is better to get a moderate Republican today than a MAGA Republican tomorrow,” but the moment Trumpism gets another foothold in the White House and the Senate, those MAGA judges won’t be stopped by ancient courtesies.\n\nJan. 29, 2024, 2:20 p.m. ET\n\nThere will be no prospect of peace in the Middle East until the hostages taken in the Oct. 7 terror attacks are returned home.\n\nIt is the first point that supporters of the Palestinians’ cause — including the Arab nations negotiating on their behalf — need to understand and to advocate, urgently. Until it is achieved, the children of Gaza will continue to be at risk of starvation and suffer malnutrition. Their homes will be bombed and families sundered.\n\nIt is the rare point today that the vast majority of Israelis agree on. No country would accept less, even in the face of worldwide condemnation of its military’s excesses in recent weeks.\n\nIt is the central point that the United States and Israel’s allies should keep in their sights if they want to bring stability to the Middle East and ease the suffering of civilians in Gaza. American service members have been killed and injured in the region. Global trade is being interrupted. The threat of a wider conflict looms.\n\nAll of these emergencies stem, in some way, from Hamas’s actions on Oct. 7, and the continuing pain felt by the loved ones of the hostages.\n\nNone of this can end until the hostages are back in Israel. That is what the negotiators who met on Sunday in Paris need to agree upon, what the world should be urging them to accomplish.\n\nFreeing the hostages will not end the violence for good. It will not grant the Palestinians the path to statehood they deserve, or freedom from being governed by a terrorist group. It will not hold Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his government accountable for their actions, before and since Oct. 7. It will not fully address the Israelis’ deep concern over their national security.\n\nNone of these goals, however, can begin to be achieved until every one of the more than 100 hostages now held in Gaza is home and safe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nFeb. 7, 2024, 4:01 p.m. ET\n\n“Witness” is an occasional feature about someone with a personal perspective on an event in the news.

I had heard “Only the Good Die Young,” “Uptown Girl” and “It’s Still Rock and Roll to Me” a million times, but Joel could have walked by me on the street and I wouldn’t have recognized him.\n\nSo when I say seeing Joel perform at Madison Square Garden in 2022 was one of the best and wildest experiences of my life, I really mean it. Perhaps I shouldn’t have been surprised that a man who’s been performing for more than 50 years put on a great show, but he transfixed the audience from the very first note to the final wave. He sang, he danced, he twirled the mic stand. The guy next to me nearly lost his mind with excitement as one song — that I still can’t identify — began. It’s the closest thing I’ve seen to rapture.\n\nWhat is it about this shy man that so captivates people? His aura of nostalgia for a time that I never even experienced? His sweeping piano solos?\n\nI think it’s his authenticity. Joel is a confident performer, but he’s not an invulnerable pop god. His lyrics are often so earnest that they verge on hokey. In 1993 he felt he didn’t have enough to say to make a great album anymore, so he largely stopped releasing records and spent the following decades playing his back catalog to his fans.\n\nBut last week, he released a new song, “Turn the Lights Back On.” “I’m late, but I’m here right now/And I’m tryin’ to find the magic/That we lost somehow,” he sings. Joel might fear he’s too late, but for so many of us, the magic was never lost.\n\nI wouldn’t care about Joel’s new music if I hadn’t seen him live. To see him step onstage, somehow self-conscious (despite 150 sold-out performances at one of the most famous arenas in the world) and, just by sitting at a piano, captivate 20,000 people, is to witness a magician at work. He transcends generations. He transcends time itself.\n\nI will never doubt the gospel of Billy Joel.

Think “Spiral” or “Blackbird,” shows in which grave misdeeds occur and no one is happy in the end.\n\nWhich means I was all in for two new series: “True Detective: Night Country” on HBO, which recaptures the well-drawn complexity of the show’s gutting first season, haunted by a tinge of the supernatural; and “Criminal Record” on Apple TV+, which, like “Spiral,” captures the racial prejudices and unsavory politics within an urban police force.\n\nBoth shows boast two actors I’ll follow anywhere: Peter Capaldi (“The Thick of It” forever) and Jodie Foster, master of all. But to my surprise, it’s their respective partners in detection, played by Cush Jumbo and Kali Reis, who’ve caught and held my attention as each series draws to its conclusion.\n\nIn “Criminal Record,” which tracks the investigation of intertwined homicides in contemporary London, Jumbo plays June Lenker, a tough and principled detective who becomes the reluctant partner (and sparring partner) to Capaldi’s old-school chief detective, Dan Hegarty.\n\nCapaldi is delightfully sinister, but Jumbo, a British actress who first riveted me in “The Good Wife,” plays the more complex character. A biracial woman who is currently married to a white man, she only loses her tightly held cool when a Black police officer, someone she considers a friend, reports her for bullying and “greasing the ladder” to get ahead.\n\nLenker, the colleague suggests, has an unfair advantage. “Black, yeah, but not too Black,” the colleague says, leaving Lenker to sob alone in a bathroom.\n\nA biracial heritage is also a source of emotional tension for Evangeline Navarro, the character played by Reis in “Night Country.” Never told her Iñupiat name, Navarro moves back to northern Alaska but remains only half at home.\n\nReis, a boxer turned actor and pure muscle, has pierced cheeks that look like semi-ironic dimples and add another layer to her expressive intensity. Reis has quickly attracted a fair share of deserved online love. No spoilers here, but when Reis’s heart breaks in the latest episode, yours will, too. I may now have to follow both Jumbo and Reis everywhere.\n\nFeb. 7, 2024, 4:55 p.m. ET\n\nA new study on defensive use of guns contains details that will hearten both gun rights and gun control advocates. I think it strengthens the case for gun control, but I can imagine that others will draw a different conclusion.\n\nResearchers found that when people shoot in self-defense, they can protect themselves and other potential victims and increase the deaths of criminal perpetrators.\n\nThe downside is big, though. Statistically speaking, “greater defensive gun use leads to more homicides” in a county, the study says. That may partly be because some guns are stolen by people who use them to commit crimes, the authors say.\n\nThe study is by John Donohue, a professor at Stanford Law School who has served as an expert witness in firearms litigation and supports gun control, and three Stanford Law research fellows: Alex Oktay, Amy Zhang and Matthew Benavides.\n\nI asked Donohue if he could be perceived as an evenhanded researcher. He said the paper’s finding that gun use does on average protect potential victims shows that he wasn’t hiding results that countered his arguments.\n\nA Pew Research Center survey last year found that the American public was exactly split over the effect of guns on safety, with 49 percent saying gun ownership does more to increase safety and 49 percent saying it does the opposite.\n\nDonohue said people who think gun ownership increases safety “are thinking of that one instance” where gun use does foil a crime and not paying attention to the ways more guns lead to more violence.\n\nAlso, he said the Gun Violence Archive that the researchers relied on didn’t allow them to tell whether defensive gun use was truly justified. If a gun owner shot a 16-year-old who tried to steal his bike, that would show up in the archive as a potential victim successfully thwarting a crime by using a gun, he said.\n\nReading Donohue’s research, there’s a narrow case for carrying a gun and being prepared to use it in self-defense. It could save your life if you’re attacked by someone who doesn’t have a gun in hand. But there are many more ways that carrying a gun can end in grief.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nFeb. 7, 2024, 5:03 a.m. ET\n\nOver the last few days, an intense atmospheric river has pummeled Southern California with rain and whipped Northern California with wind. As much rain fell on the U.C.L.A. campus in 24 hours as usually falls in eight months. Across the state, eight densely populated counties declared states of emergency and at one point more than 850,000 Californian households and businesses lost power.\n\nIn scenes familiar from urban Europe’s now-routine flash flooding, roads were overrun with floodwater and cars were buried by debris. There have been at least three deaths. These are not exactly apocalyptic events, but they also aren’t comfortable for those living through them, especially those doing so without flood insurance.\n\nSome climate scientists like to say, when asked if we can adapt to a future of rapid warming, that we’re not all that well adapted to the present. They don’t mean there hasn’t been progress in protecting against climate-powered destruction (mortality from natural disasters is notably down in recent decades). They mean the present is not a safe and stable place from which to imagine a much messier future.\n\nThe present is pretty messy already, with plenty of vulnerability even in those places we may want to believe lie beyond the reach of at least quotidian weather impacts.\n\nJust look at the “billion-dollar disaster” database published each year by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, documenting a pretty steep increase in the number of such disasters in recent decades. Despite some criticism that it should recognize more nonclimate factors, the database is a useful record of the weather events that wrought the most destruction in a given year.\n\nWhat is perhaps most striking is how much the current list is dominated not by historic-seeming disasters but largely by events and episodes you might casually call just “really bad weather.” Last year’s atmospheric rivers in California made the list, as did Hurricane Idalia, which hit Florida in late August, and the Lahaina firestorm in Maui.\n\nBut so did rainy-day flooding in Fort Lauderdale last April, thunderstorms in Oklahoma that same month, and late-summer droughts in the Mississippi River Delta. Of the 28 events identified by N.O.A.A. as billion-dollar disasters, only 16 were classified generically as “severe weather.”\n\nIt’s not just biblical catastrophes; more normal bad weather can really clobber us, too.\n\nFeb. 7, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET\n\nI wanted to bask in the glow cast by Tracy Chapman’s brief return to performing Sunday night at the Grammys, but other people’s cultural projections dragged me down.\n\nChapman performed with the appropriately deferential country music superstar Luke Combs. He sang just below her powerful register, often choosing to fade away from the microphone. But in the days since they stood onstage together, the public perception of his deference has morphed into a cringe-worthy form of symbolic politics — namely, the idea that the performance stands for some intangible idea of hope and reconciliation.\n\nThe unnamed politics of that joint Grammys performance are that a Black folk singer (embodying progressivism) and a white male country singer (embodying … something antithetical to progressivism) made music together. The consumer package of the Grammys promises a nice, neat emotional resolution to centuries of racial tension.\n\nCombs’s version of “Fast Car” is a bona fide hit. It gave Chapman her highest-charting pop single and made her the first Black woman to write a No. 1 country single. Ever.\n\nThe cover is faithful to the tune, but Combs’s version lacks social and political urgency. That is a difference between folk music and country music. In folk music, the messenger matters. When Combs sings “Fast Car,” the lyrics are filtered through his identity. Our country expects men like Combs to be more inclined to be running to something than away.\n\nThat isn’t to say that white American men don’t face social and political issues. But in Combs’s performance of the song, no riffs hint at the grittiness of navigating masculinity when you aren’t born of privilege. No key shifts evoke images of depression, anxiety and identity crisis. Combs’s interpretation of Chapman’s lyrics feels like an ode to an actual car. What a waste.\n\nThe cover is popular in a genre that has long been roiled by racial conflict. Over the past five years, artists and activists have tried to get mainstream Big Country to get with the multiracial program, but they have won little more than nominal, marginal inclusion rather than a reckoning with the industry’s soul. However lovely, Chapman’s and Combs’s performance ties too neat a bow on years of conflict within country music over who gets to play with the genre’s big boys.\n\nCombs’s crossover hit coasts on the greatness of a Black artist who is already a legend. For country music to claim this as any kind of reconciliation feels like it stole someone else’s medal and declared itself a winner in a foot race that it never ran.\n\nThat makes for a fine pop performance, but it does not say much about social progress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT"
