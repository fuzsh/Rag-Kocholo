        "text": "Benjamin F. Chapman, Jr. (October 29, 1925â€“February 21, 2008) is American actor known for playing the Gill-man in Creature from the Black Lagoon.\n\nQuotes\n\n[edit]\n\nWell, you know, people always ask me what makes Creature from the Black Lagoon hold up after all these years. I always say that if you look at the movie, the storyline starts with the Big Bang. Then it goes to the creation of man, and you see evolution with man coming out of the sea. The theory today is that man DID come out of the sea. These are issues that men today are STILL dwelling on. Was man created? Or, was man evolved? So, that's why if you watch Creature, you're not bored because it still makes sense.\n\nBen Champman Interview (November 1, 2002)\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nThe Real Gillman"
