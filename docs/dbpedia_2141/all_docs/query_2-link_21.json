        "text": "Reviewed by Marcey Papandrea, MoreHorror.com\n\nTwixt, from the once great Francis Ford Coppola is a very bizarre film, one that I am not sure entirely made sense but I kind of liked it. I can’t be sure what happened to the filmmaker that once brought us The Godfather, but he seems content making low budget films. Twixt is as strange as they come too, think Stephen King with a mix of David Lynch, Coppola wanted to go for weird and he certainly achieved it. His intentions aren’t entirely clear with this one, that is a mystery in itself to be solved if one dares.\n\nA writer Hall Baltimore (Val Kilmer) is in a small town to sign copies of his book at a local hardware store when he meets the town Sheriff Bobby Lagrange (Bruce Dern) and gets caught up in a bizarre murder mystery. This town...\n\n★★★★☆ The best sports films are often those where enjoyment is not entirely dependent on a love of the game in question, and Brian Helgeland's 42 (2013) fits that criteria perfectly. Unflinching in its depiction of the legendary Jackie Robinson's journey from the Negro leagues to Major League Baseball, the stirring material is matched by some pitch-perfect performances. That journey begins in 1945, where Brooklyn Dodgers Gm Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) seeks out Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) in a bid to break the colour barrier in baseball. For daring to break that unwritten law, both manager and athlete are branded outcasts.\n\nRobinson bearing the brunt of the abuse from players and fans alike. As Rickey repeatedly warns, Robinson must “have the guts not to fight back” if his talent is to shine. Helgeland does a great job at showing Robinson's prowess on the field; the well realised baseball sequences show a clear love of the game,...\n\nDirector: Brian Helgeland; Screenwriter Brian Helgeland; Starring: Chadwick Boseman, Harrison Ford, Nicole Beharie, Christopher Meloni, Alan Tudyk; Running time: 128 mins; Certificate: 12A\n\nWhile baseball dramas will always be a tougher sell on this side of the pond, Brian Helgeland's earnest biopic has a better wide-appeal hook than did 2011's Oscar-nominated Moneyball. It follows the little-known-here story of Jackie Robinson, the African American baseball player whose entry into the Major League in 1942 ended six decades of racial segregation within the sport. He's portrayed affably and respectfully by newcomer Chadwick Boseman, in a performance that shuns histrionics in favour of simmering righteous anger.\n\nRobinson is warned early on by Harrison Ford's avuncular Branch Rickey, the team executive who signs him to the Brooklyn Dodgers and becomes his mentor, that he can't afford to get mad. Despite the constant barrage of provocation from all sides - from discriminatory bathroom policies to...\n\nBlu-ray Review\n\n42\n\nDirected by: Brian Helgeland\n\nCast: Chadwick Boseman, Harrison Ford\n\nRunning Time: 2 hrs 8 mins\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nDue Out: July 16, 2013\n\nOwn “42” on Blu-ray Combo Pack, DVD and Digital Download 7/16\n\nPlot (courtesy of Warner Bros.): Hero is a word we hear often in sports, but heroism is not always about achievements on the field of play. “42” tells the story of two men – the great Jackie Robinson and legendary Brooklyn Dodgers Gm Branch Rickey – whose brave stand against prejudice forever changed the world by changing the game of baseball.\n\nIn 1946, Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) put himself at the forefront of history when he signed Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) to the team, breaking Major League Baseball’s infamous color line. But the deal also put both Robinson and Rickey in the firing line of the public, the press and even other players. Facing unabashed racism from every side, Robinson was forced to...\n\nChicago – John C. McGinley will probably always be known for the classic TV character Dr. Perry Cox on the long-running “Scrubs.” But through his character actor career, he has taken on a variety of roles, including the portrayal of Red Barber, the play-by-play man for the Brooklyn Dodgers in the recent film “42.”\n\nMcGinley plays an integral part in that Jackie Robinson story, as Red Barber was the man announcing the history as it happened in 1947, the year that Robinson broke the color line in baseball. McGinley took meticulous care in recreating “The Ol’ Redhead” (as Barber was nicknamed), inflecting the character with a perfect imitation of the announcer’s unique style, which was both nostalgic and in the present context of the Robinson story.\n\nCalling History: John C. McGinley as Red Barber in ’42’\n\nPhoto credit: Warner Bros.\n\nJohn C. McGinley has proved time and again that he is much more than Dr.\n\nAlan Tudyk stars as late baseball manager Ben Chapman in the new Jackie Robinson biopic 42, which took the top spot at the box office over the weekend. The actor is best known for his comedic work, so when he stopped by our La studios recently, he told us portraying the well-documented racist was outside his comfort zone in more ways than one. He also spoke to us about his role on Suburgatory and hinted that his character, Noah, will have a chance to get revenge on the man who stole his girlfriend in an upcoming episode. Watch our interview to see what else Alan had to say about working alongside Harrison Ford and why Jackie's story should make Americans proud.\n\nFans of Suburgatory and Firefly know actor Alan Tudyk as the actor with an open face and daft smile while the audiences that saw I, Robot remember the humanity he invested in a character of man-made machinery. This weekend, however, the audiences that sat down in the dark for the Jackie Robinson biopic 42 saw a startling new aspect of the 42-year-old actor’s craft. Playing Philadelphia Phillies manager Ben Chapman, who more than any other character in the film embodies the angry face and venomous voice of mid-century racism in America, Tudyk taunts Robinson (newcomer Chadwick Boseman) with a relentless...\n\n-- Editor's Note: C.J. Nitkowski pitched for eight teams in the major leagues from 1995-2005, then played pro ball in Japan and South Korea. He portrays Phillies pitcher Dutch Leonard in the current film `42.'\n\n___\n\nJackie Robinson had no influence on me.\n\nHe didn't open any doors for me. He didn't pave any way. He didn't give me the hope that I could do anything I aspired to in a country where some viewed me as less of a man. He didn't give me the courage to forge ahead despite the circumstances surrounding me.\n\nJackie Robinson was just never a hero to me.\n\nJackie broke the color barrier in major league baseball on April 15, 1947, and he died in 1972. I was born in 1973 and really didn't have a clue as to what was going in the world until at least 50 years after Jackie's historic debut as a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers.\n\n• It's 66 years since Jackie Robinson broke baseball's colour line – and Hollywood has done a fine job retelling his story\n\n• Jackie Robinson and the Brooklyn Dodgers – in pictures\n\nBaseball fans will never be allowed to forget what happened on 15 April 1947, the day Jackie Robinson suited up for the Brooklyn Dodgers to break the sport's long-running color barrier. Major League Baseball has seen to that, leading the charge in ensuring that a seminal moment in American history isn't lost to time passed, retiring his number league wide in 1997 and committing to marking Jackie Robinson Day annually. On Monday, each player will don his celebrated digits, 42, in tribute to a player who became an icon.\n\nThere is however a danger that the vast weight of Robinson's story could be lost on those who didn't grow up in a time, or closer to a time, of segregation and unabashed racism. It's one thing to hear stories of Jackie's hardship,...\n\nDic Hertz is doing what he does best and sent us a review of 42.\n\nI won’t waste your time babbling on and on, here’s what you really want:\n\n42 Review\n\nHero is a word thrown around quite a bit in the world of sports. However, heroism isn’t always about obtaining play-based successes on the field – it’s about breaking barriers.\n\n“42” embarks on the story of two men – the legendary Jackie Robinson and the great Brooklyn Dodgers Gm Branch Rickey – whose bravery to oppose prejudices changed the world of baseball as we know it.\n\nIn 1946, Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) placed himself on an unusual spotlight when he signed Jackie Robinson (Chad Roseman) to the Brooklyn Dodgers, breaking racial ice among Mlb’s color-based divide. The deal placed both men in the font-lines of scrutiny, ridicule and constant bashing. Facing unstoppable racism from every angle, Robinson was forced to display tremendous strength,...\n\nThe sun is shining, the birds are chirping, and it’s time to crack open the windows after so many long months. Ah, springtime, when a young man’s (and many not so young) thoughts turn to … baseball. Well, it turns out that many in Hollywood have the old “horse-hide” on the brain too. This favorite American pastime has graced the big screen many times from light comedies such as Alibi Ike and Major League to heavy dramas like Bang The Drum Slowly. One classic flick, The Natural, could be classified a Fantasy allegory while another, Bull Durham, is a sexy bedroom romp. Of course, film makers have chosen to tell several real-life stories of the diamond with Pride Of The Yankees (Lou Gehrig’s tale), a couple of Babe Ruth biopics, and the lady players of World War II in A League Of Their Own. Now Brian Helgeland (The Order...\n\nYou could take many approaches to telling the story of Jackie Robinson, the first African American to play in Major League Baseball. With 42, Warner Bros. and writer/director Brian Helgeland (A Knight's Tale) went for earnest over something that would have likely had critics chanting \"Oscar bait!\" This doesn't make the film any less appealing or diminish its overall quality, it simply gives it what you'd typically expect from a made-for-tv movie, but the execution and performances rise above such comparisons making it a well worthwhile watch and one that caused a lump to form in my throat for most of its duration. From the moment I first saw a glimpse of what 42 had to offer I knew there was very little this film could do to get it \"wrong\". The story is too good and baseball translates to the big screen better than any sport there is, offering so many moments of humanity,...\n\nJackie Robinson was the ideal class act to break the barrier and become the first black player in Major League Baseball.\n\nWriter-director Brian Helgeland's Robinson biopic \"42\" is a class act itself, though not always an engaging act. It's such a familiar story that any faithful film biography almost inevitably will turn out predictable, even a bit routine.\n\nWith an earnest performance by Chadwick Boseman as Robinson and an enjoyably self-effacing turn by Harrison Ford as Brooklyn Dodgers boss Branch Rickey, \"42\" hits every button you expect very ably. It riles with its re-creations of the heartless, ignorant racism to which Robinson was subjected. It uplifts with its depictions of Robinson's restraint and fortitude. It inspires with its glimpses of support and compassion from teammates and fans.\n\nYet like a sleepy, low-scoring ballgame, \"42\" is not the jolt of energy and entertainment we wish it could be.\n\nUnlike No. 42 Robinson's daring on the base paths,...\n\nWhen Warner Bros. “42″ hits screens April 12, the Jackie Robinson saga will slap moviegoers with a fresh take on just how accepted racism was in the U.S. back in 1947, when Robinson broke the color barrier as the first African American player admitted into Major League Baseball. That’s the word from Alan Tudyk, who plays Robinson tormentor Ben Chapman in the Brian Helgeland film that stars Chadwick Boseman as Robinson, and Harrison Ford as Brooklyn Dodgers General Manager Branch Rickey. “It’s a very, very good telling of the story, starting with the amazing script Brian wrote,” notes the “Suburgatory” and “Firefly” actor. “He’s obviously a proven writer — ‘L.A. Confidential,’ ‘Mystic River’ and so many things. This is a brilliant, straightforward telling of this story. People who know the history and the trivia of this time are going to like it because it’s an accurate portrayal. A...\n\nLos Angeles -- There's a scene in \"42\" in which Jackie Robinson, the first black player in Major League Baseball, endures intolerably cruel racial slurs from the Philadelphia Phillies' manager.\n\nIt's early in the 1947 season. Each time the Brooklyn Dodgers' first baseman comes up to bat, manager Ben Chapman emerges from the dugout, stands on the field and taunts him with increasingly personal and vitriolic attacks. It's a visible struggle, but No. 42 maintains his composure before a crowd of thousands.\n\nAs a viewer, it's uncomfortable to watch – although as writer-director Brian Helgeland points out, \"if anything, the language we have in that scene was cleaned up from what it was.\"\n\nSuch hatred may seem archaic, an ugly episode in our nation's history that we'd rather forget. But remembering Robinson's accomplishments is more important than ever, say people involved with \"42\" and baseball historians alike. And because he was such an inspiring cultural figure,...\n\nWith all the sports biopics we've seen over the years, and given the tremendous impact that Jackie Robinson had on American sports, you'd think that we'd have seen his story told on the big screen at least a few hundred times by now. Strangely, although there have been a ton of made-for-tv movies and a few documentaries over the years, as far as I can tell the only major retelling of the Jackie Robinson story on the big screen was the 1950 film that starred the man himself. Now writer-director Brian Helgeland (Payback, A Knight's Tale) is attempting to rectify that situation with his upcoming movie 42. The movie stars Chadwick Boseman (Persons Unknown) in the lead role, with Harrison Ford as Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey and Alan Tudyk playing Phillies manager Ben Chapman. Although you might assume this would be pure Oscar bait material, the movie isn't actually coming out until next April.\n\nFresh out of prison, a young man named Mitchell (a greying and older-looking Colin Farrell) is sought out by his former associates who want to see him back to his old, unlawful way of life. Unsure of committing, Mitchell also has his sights set on taking on the potential role of bodyguard to a reclusive, burned-out big-screen star (Keira Knightley). A personal quest for justice over a brutal gangland killing of an old father-figure brings him into the same orbit as an immaculately-dressed, sexually-ambiguous gangster played by Ray Winstone (whose signing on for the part appears to have inspired the makers to up the script’s c-word quota by tenfold). Matters are further complicated as Mitchell’s flaky old friend (Ben Chapman) insists on draws him back into a world of violence, landing him in hot water with Winstone.\n\nOn paper, London Boulevard looks like it has the potential to deliver great things."
