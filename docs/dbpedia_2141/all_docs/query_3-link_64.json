        "text": "Benjamin Chapman, Recruiting Specialist\n\nUniversity of Connecticut\n\n(312) 638-4458\n\nI am originally from southeastern Connecticut and grew up playing every sport you could imagine. In high school, I played football, basketball, baseball and track and field. Throughout high school I fell in love with football and was lucky enough to receive an opportunity to play football at the University of Connecticut. There I was fortunate to be a part of three bowl games and one Big East Championship. After graduating I spent one season in 2013 playing and coaching football overseas in Australia for the Monash Warriors football team in Melbourne. While there, we won a league championship (called the VIC Bowl) and was named 1st team all league as an offensive lineman. Just last spring I was also honored to be inducted into the Stonington High School Athletic Hall of Fame.\n\nEver since then I have been coaching, I spent two years at my alma mater Stonington High School coaching football, basketball and baseball. Then I went on to coach football in the collegiate ranks at Castleton University, Stonehill College, UConn and Marist College over the next several years. I love helping young people succeed and reach their goals.\n\nThis is why I am so excited to be in my role here as a recruiting specialist, I know so many families struggle with all the difficulties that come with the recruiting process and now I can help them navigate that with confidence.\n\nWhen I am not at work I love getting to hike and play outside with my wife Brandi and my two young sons. We currently reside in Brookfield, Connecticut."
