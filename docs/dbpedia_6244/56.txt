The Renault World Series (WSbR) is a roundup of multiple racing series that was held 5–6 May at the Nürburgring. It drew more than 80,000 spectators to one of Europe’s loveliest race courses. The promoters rely on the best cable protectors in the world – the DEFENDER cable protectors ensured protection of the numerous cables and avoidance of tripping hazards during the WSbR.

Adam Hall has been developing and manufacturing the DEFENDER series for more than fifteen years now. In addition to the increased need for safety, the professionalization of all industries and the economic efficiency that comes of long useful life and flexibility have also contributed to the Defender cable protector success story.
