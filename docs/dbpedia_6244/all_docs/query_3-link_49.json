Harvey's knowledge about Emotional Intelligence surpasses what most experts are able to articulate. Why? Because Harvey himself has built his own EI over the years and understands the importance EI has in ones' life. His success is a direct result of his hard work in understanding his own Emotional Intelligence. Listen as he and host of MHNR, Kristin Walker, discuss his journey and delve deeper into exactly what EI is in the first place.\""
