        "text": "SULLIVAN: ‘WHERE IS YOUR TITLE X RESPONSIBILITIES ON CLIMATE CHANGE?’ In a combative exchange at yesterday’s Senate Armed Services Committee hearing of the Navy’s 2025 budget, Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK) grilled Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro over whether he has failed to deliver an adequate shipbuilding plan because he’s too focused on climate change.\n\nAt one point, Sullivan suggested that Del Toro resign or be relieved of his position because “he is spending so much time on issues that are not even part of his Title X responsibility.” Title X is the section of the U.S. Code that outlines the roles and missions of the armed forces.\n\n“Where is your Title X responsibilities on climate change?” Sullivan demanded. “They don’t exist.”\n\n“No. They do exist, senator. I disagree,” Del Toro responded. “Climate change, it actually impacts everything. … It impacts manning, equipment, training, sustaining our combat readiness.”\n\n“In your strategic guidance you issued to your department, you mentioned climate change nine times. You don’t address the size of trying to increase the fleet. You got this committee, your Climate Action plan, a year before your shipbuilding plan,” Sullivan said. “Title X has given you the direction to, among other things, oversee the construction of outfitting and repairing of naval ships in an effective and timely manner. One thing that I think has been brought up here is my assessment, respectfully, of your tenure is you haven’t been focused on that.”\n\n“I spent 75% of my time on shipbuilding, so I don’t agree,” Del Toro pushed back. “Actually, a good leader, what they do is they actually take assessment of the conditions that exist when one comes in. And you know well, senator, that the acquisition issues that we’re dealing with go back decades. What I’m trying to do and have been doing from the day that I became secretary, was to be honest, transparent, and deeply committed to turning things around. And that’s exactly what I’ve done.”\n\nTHE SHIPBUILDING CRISIS: “The truth is that our naval fleet is too small and too old to meet the demands of our combatant commanders and our National Defense Strategy, particularly in the years going forward,” said Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS), the top Republican on the committee. “We have a quantum leap that we need to make, and we need to do it soon.”\n\n“It’s clear we will not be able to do so with the Navy’s fiscal year 2025 budget request, which contains cuts to naval personnel, shipbuilding, weapons, and military construction,” Wicker said. “President Biden has asked the Navy to take a 3% cut when accounting for inflation. These cuts impact the capacity of our force. The Navy is asking to retire 19 battle-force ships and procure only six. It’s just a fact. This is completely unacceptable.”\n\n“The shipbuilding crisis that we have right now is not just a fiasco. It’s amplified by our main adversary who is building ships at the rapid rate,” Sullivan said. “In 2021, the PLA [China’s People’s Liberation Army] had 341 ships. This year they have 370. And [in] 2025, though, they will have 395. By 2030, they will have 435 ships, 141 more ships than we have.”\n\nA LACK OF CAPACITY AND LOSS OF ‘BLUE-COLLAR’ WORKERS: It’s not just money that’s keeping the United States from ramping up ship production. The industry is facing myriad problems, including a shortage of trained shipbuilders, supply chain issues, constantly changing requirements, and contractors who are more concerned about shareholders than increasing capacity.\n\n“There are a lot of challenges in the shipbuilding industry, and they actually date back to the 1980s, when we gave up on commercial shipbuilding in this country and lost so much of the talent in the shipbuilding industry,” Del Toro said. “That was compounded tremendously by COVID. And the enormous challenges that we have with regards to blue-collar labor in this workforce that actually impacts across all programs because the industry and even the Navy and its public shipyards simply don’t have the people that are necessary to work in our shipyards.”\n\nDel Toro said there has been a “greening” of the workforce, which used to be comprised of blue-collar workers with decades of experience and now is made up of younger workers who have plenty of other job options that often are less arduous and pay better. “We provided $100 million of resources to the shipyard so they can provide $5,000 bonuses to their shipyard workers for the first year if they stay in place and another $5,000 if they stay in place throughout the construction of the ship itself,” Del Toro said.\n\n“So we’re doing everything that we possibly can to actually help industry,” he said. “Industry also needs to do its part.”\n\n“We have too many stock buyback plans that, you know, as we’re investing $14 billion into industry, you know, we’ve got billions of dollars that are going out the other side of the door into stockholders,” he added. “So they’ve got to focus more on the customer than just the stockholders.”\n\nGOP DEFENSE HAWKS CHAFE UNDER BUDGET CAPS THEY IMPOSED ON THEMSELVES\n\nGood Friday morning and welcome to Jamie McIntyre’s Daily on Defense, written and compiled by Washington Examiner National Security Senior Writer Jamie McIntyre (@jamiejmcintyre) and edited by Stacey Dec.

U.S. military officials say as many as 150 truckloads a day could soon be delivering aid from the sea.\n\nIsrael recently seized the key Rafah border crossing, cutting off the main land entry point for aid into the Gaza Strip.\n\nUS COMPLETES GAZA PIER, AID TO START ARRIVING IN DAYS\n\nZELENSKY: ‘WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE KHARKIV’: In an interview conducted in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told ABC News Foreign Correspondent James Longman that Ukraine desperately needs two additional Patriot missile batteries to prevent the city falling to Russian forces.\n\n“All we need are two Patriot systems. Russia will not be able to occupy Kharkiv if we have those,” Zelensky said. “The situation is very serious. … We cannot afford to lose Kharkiv.”\n\n“Sufficient air defense coverage in the Kharkiv City area would allow Ukrainian forces to constrain Russian aviation operations, but only if Western countries permitted Ukraine to use the systems to intercept Russian aircraft in Russian airspace, since Russian aircraft can strike Kharkiv City without ever leaving Russian airspace,” the Institute for the Study of War said in its latest assessment. “Russian fixed-wing aircraft have increasingly targeted Kharkiv City and its environs with glide bombs and various missile strikes in recent weeks to degrade Ukrainian defenses and prompt residents to flee the city.”\n\n“Ukrainian defenders are doing their best to maintain defensive boundaries and positions, inflict significant losses to the occupiers, increase initiative where possible,” the Ukrainian General Staff said on its Facebook page. “In general, the situation on the frontline is controlled by [Ukrainian] Defense Forces.”\n\nLongman asked Zelensky if he thought the loss of lives and territory and the shift of battlefield movement in favor of the Russians was America’s fault for delaying crucial aid.\n\n“It’s the world’s fault,” Zelensky replied. “They gave the opportunity for Putin to occupy. But now the world can help.”\n\nMeanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin said today that Russian troops have no orders to capture Kharkiv. Speaking to reporters in China, Putin said the offensive in the Kharkiv region is aimed at creating a buffer zone and is in response to the Ukrainian shelling of Russia’s Belgorod region.\n\n“I have said publicly that if it continues, we will be forced to create a security zone, a sanitary zone,” Putin said.\n\nLESSONS FROM THE BATTLE OF THE BLACK SEA\n\nUKRAINE STRIKES BACK: While Ukraine is suffering from a shortage of electricity due to relentless Russian attacks on its power generating stations and electrical grid, Ukraine knocked the lights out in the city of Sevastopol in Russian-occupied Crimea.\n\nUkraine launched a massive drone attack overnight, which Russian authorities said damaged both combat aircraft and a fuel depot and set a refinery ablaze.\n\nAccording to a post on X, 13 Russian troops were killed and other losses included two MiG-31s, three Su-27s, one S-400 air defense radar, two S-400 air defense launchers, and two warehouses.\n\n‘BLACKOUTS IN KYIV’: RUSSIA BATTERS UKRAINE’S POWER GRID AMID AIR DEFENSE SHORTAGE\n\nTHE RUNDOWN:\n\nWashington Examiner: ‘Blackouts in Kyiv’: Russia batters Ukraine’s power grid amid air defense shortage\n\nWashington Examiner: Lessons from the battle of the Black Sea\n\nWashington Examiner: House formally condemns Biden’s pause on weapons transfers to Israel\n\nWashington Examiner: South Africa pushes international court to stop Israel invasion of Rafah\n\nWashington Examiner: US completes Gaza pier, aid to start arriving in days\n\nWashington Examiner: Five IDF soldiers killed in friendly fire accident in northern Gaza\n\nWashington Examiner: Senate Democrats attempt to revive bipartisan border deal as Lankford rejects ‘nonserious’ effort\n\nWashington Examiner: Veterans outraged after investigation finds VA gave $10.8 million in bonuses to senior executives\n\nWashington Examiner: Bob Menendez trial: Lawyers for co-defendants say gifts were ‘not criminal’\n\nWashington Examiner: Opinion: Zelensky’s ego is cashing checks Ukraine can’t afford\n\nWashington Examiner: Xi and Putin’s wake-up call to the world\n\nFinancial Times: U.S. Defence Chief Lloyd Austin To Meet Chinese Counterpart This Month\n\nReuters: Tracking China’s ‘Grey Zone’ Balloon Flights Over Taiwan\n\nDefense News: US Announces $2 Billion to Help Ukraine Make Its Own Weapons\n\nNew York Times: As Russia Advances, NATO Considers Sending Trainers into Ukraine\n\nWall Street Journal: Russia Launched Research Spacecraft for Antisatellite Nuclear Weapon Two Years Ago, US Officials Say\n\nDefense One: Navy Secretary Vows More Money For Anti-Drone Lasers\n\nAP: Israel will respond to genocide charges at UN court after South Africa urgently requests cease-fire\n\nNew York Times: Israel Sending More Troops To Rafah Amid Warnings Of Famine In Gaza\n\nBloomberg: Hezbollah Fires Missile Barrage At Israel After Death Of Commander\n\nBloomberg: Lockheed F-35 Won’t Get Its Delayed Upgrade Until 2025, Congress’s Agency Says\n\nDefense One: F-35s Are Piling Up on Lockheed Tarmacs, Presenting ‘Unique’ Risks to the Pentagon\n\nAir & Space Forces Magazine: F-22s Practice Dogfights over the Korean Peninsula with ROK F-35s\n\nBreaking Defense: A 7th-Gen Fighter?
