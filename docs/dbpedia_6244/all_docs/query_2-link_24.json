        "text": "Following this weekend’s Malaysian Grand Prix the Formula One championship heads directly to Suzuka in Japan.\n\nThe John Hugenholz-designed circuit is a favourite among drivers for its fast and unforgiving nature. It also boasts one feature which sets it apart from most other circuits: it has a crossover.\n\nThere’s something undeniably cool about a racing circuit with a crossover. Around 95% of the slot car racing tracks I built in my youth had them.\n\nFrom an engineering point of view they differ from ‘normal’ tracks in that tyre wear is more even: there are no ‘outside’ wheels covering more ground and taking more of the load.\n\nBut really it’s the simple pleasure of seeing one racing car going over another which makes them cool. And yet, perhaps surprisingly, it’s something we don’t see very much of. With these ten notable exceptions.\n\nGo ad-free for just £1 per month\n\n>> Find out more and sign up\n\nSuzuka, Japan\n\nSuzuka held its first Formula One race in 1987 but the track was completed in the sixties. Although its figure-of-eight configuration made it unusual at the time one early design was even more radical still, featuring a total of three crossovers.\n\nTwo of these were deleted from the final layout, yet it remains one of the most popular and challenging courses.\n\nYas Marina, United Arab Emirate\n\nThe Yas Marina circuit is built on a man-made island, which inevitably offers little in the way of elevation. The steepest section of track the drivers tackle is at the pit lane exit, which is routed underneath turn one, allowing the drivers to safely merge into the track away from the racing line.\n\nIf only as much imagination had been used to pen the rest of one of motor racing’s dullest circuits.\n\nMonza, Italy\n\nIt’s 55 years since Monza’s crossover was last used in both directions by grand prix cars. The old ten-kilometre layout last held the Italian Grand Prix in 1961; a fateful event in which one driver and 14 spectators were killed.\n\nThe crossover remains and the banked track was recently resurfaced to prevent it surrendering completely to the undergrowth. However its days as a viable circuit are long behind it.\n\nFiorano, Italy\n\nMonza isn’t Italy’s only track with a crossover, although the other course does not hold racing activity. Ferrari’s private Fiorano testing circuit is the hallowed ground where generations of the scarlet machines were proven and developed, at least until F1 embraced strict limits on the amount of testing which goes on.\n\nHowever Ferrari do get to use their course occasionally, notably for a recent Pirelli wet tyre test.\n\nAutodromo Juan Manuel Fangio, Argentina\n\nNot one of Argentina’s major circuits, this track at Balcarce chiefly gets a mention for being named after the town’s most famous local: five-times world champion Juan Manuel Fangio.\n\nSan Juan, Argentina\n\nFew racing circuits crossovers feature such impressive examples of architecture as the bridge spanning the San Juan circuit in Argentina. The scenery is equally impressive, as the super-quick circuit winds its way past a steep valley. Also known as the Autodromo Eduardo Copello, it makes for a spectacular venue for the Super TC 2000 touring car series.\n\nOran Park, Australia\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6CT83LBAtlI?t=8m57s\n\nAustralia’s Oran Park circuit in Syndey closed at the beginning of 2010. It had hosted the country’s popular touring car championship for decades as well as a couple of grands prix, run for Formula 5000 cars. However the land it sat on, including the tight crossover section, was sold to the regional government for a housing development. Its final Supercars race took place in 2008 (video above)\n\nBut while Austrlia lost its crossover circuit one remains in New Zealand: the Highlands facility near Cromwell. Over in the USA the short-lived Paramount Ranch course closed after just two years.\n\nAhvenisto, Finland\n\nMany tracks have been referred to as the ‘mini-Nurburgring’ but it seems an especially appropriate description for Finland’s undulating Ahvenisto track. The country may have produced three world champions but has never had a round of the championship. However Keke Rosberg visited the circuit with Williams in the early eighties.\n\nIt remains in use and was recently visited by the Formula Four Northern European Zone series.\n\nBilbao, Spain\n\nThis unusual street circuit in Spain was used just once by the now-disbanded World Series by Renault during its first season. The event saw a demonstration run by Fernando Alonso in a current F1 car and the two Formula Renault 3.5 races were won by eventual champion Robert Kubica and future IndyCar champion Will Power.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1iE_L6jiTY\n\nPalanga, Lithuania\n\nThere are many past examples of motorways and dual carriageways being closed to form racing circuits. Many of these included fly-overs such as Germany’s Dresden-Hellerau and Kolner Kurs and Venezuela’s meandering, 9.9-kilometre Circuito Los Proceres.\n\nBut surely tracks like these couldn’t exist in modern motor racing? Think again: Lithuania’s Palanga circuit comprises parts of the A11 and A13 motorways. Cars refuel during the annual 1000 kilometre race at a petrol station on one of the carriageways.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54uSLhPYZwc\n\nOver to you\n\nAre there any other racing circuits with crossovers – past or present – which you have particularly enjoyed? And which current F1 track would benefit from having crossovers added?\n\nHave your say in the comments\n\nF1 top tens\n\nHamilton called his last race ‘one of his worst’ – but is it among his 10 poorest?\n\nTop ten fake and fictional racing drivers from gaming history\n\nThe great go-slows: 10 times F1 drivers threw out the anchor – for different reasons\n\nF1’s 10 longest-running teams – and why most of them have been lost\n\nYour top 10 F1 tracks of the last 10 seasons"
