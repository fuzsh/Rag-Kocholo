        "text": "Definitely motorsport rather than F1 - which comes pretty low down on my list.\n\nHaving spent far too many years trackside at all level from club racing up to F1 (or should that be F1 up to club racing) I know what is the most interesting to marshal at.\n\nI love motor racing, preferably viewed live. Have sometimes gone to a club meeting rather than watching a Grand Prix on TV. Having said that, I do view F1 as the ultimate form of racing and read race reports and watch TV highlights for every race.\n\nNobody has the time or mental capacity to follow everything. We each pick our own choice of racing to focus on, and anyone's choice is as valid as anyone else's. Nothing wrong with following exclusively F1 or NASCAR or BTCC and nothing else. Whatever you enjoy.\n\nWhen i was younger it was pretty much only F1 and BTCC in the 90's 94 onwards. I never had sky still don't so only watched F1 and BTCC when it was on Grandstand on BBC-ITV then during the 00's when they both were on ITV. But since F1 went to SKY and thanks to Youtube i have got myself into sportscar and endurance racing. IMSA, WEC and watch all the big races when i can Dubai 24 hrs, Spa 24 hours Daytona 24 Sebring 12 hours, & Le Man's.\n\nI may not get the chance to watch them live at the time but when they get uploaded onto their channels on YT i watch them in full over a couple of weeks in my spare time. I do sometimes go weeks without watching a race before i start a race.\n\nI sometimes watch F1 i keep an eye on it but as a sport it does not interest as much as it did when i was younger i don't like the direction F1 has gone and a lot of the tracks they race on. Last year i even brought the BTCC Super tourers dvd boxset covering 94-99 and 00 which is great to watch and i have every F1 season review from 80-13 on dvd\n\nEdited by azza200, 20 August 2022 - 21:09.\n\nMotorsport.\n\nLove IndyCar, watch every race, likewise Formula E, and try to keep across BTCC and WEC when I can.\n\nF1 though is the only one that gets me feeling sick with nervous tension ahead of the race, and physically shaking with nerves at the start.\n\nNo interest in motorbikes though, and always find it curious this site covers them when the Autosport magazine never did.\n\nMotorsport in general for me, but the reality is it's a bit of both.\n\nI spend the vast majority of my racing fan time on F1 now, but following all sorts of other motorsport is what eventually led me to F1. I started out with sprint cars in Tennessee in 1970 when I was 5, then also became a huge NASCAR fan. That led me to IndyCar. Seeing how fast the indyCars were at TMS (compared to NASCAR), I was absolutely in awe. I knew F1 was even quicker, and that, combined with my ALMS & V8SC fandom led me to F1.\n\nMainly F1 fan. Around 2008-2010 I would watch whatever car racing was on TV (motorbikes or rally and stuff not so much). WTCC was probably my 2nd favourite series after F1 but occasionally I also watched things like Le Mans 24h, F2, WSbR, Porsche Supercup etc. Not religiously but if I hadn't anything better to do, I would watch. Unfortunately, GP2 wasn't available on my TV subscribtion back then, after 2008, I would definetely have watched regularly otherwise. I watched some in 2008 with interest, though.\n\nNow I don't think I have seen anything outside of F1 in many years. F1 just satiates me enough. I even had an F1 crisis around the peak of the Mercedes domination and if not for the promise of the budget cap and new technical regulations, I could well have been done with F1 by now. I think, unfortunately, that car racing is past its peak due to the technology advancement, evnironmental issues and the culture of safety (not saying F1 is wrong with following any of this, but it affects the show). With V8/V10 engines and gravel/grass instead of tarmac runoffs, even the boring F1 races were kinda fun to watch. Now I need good racing to stay entertained. Whenever I see F1 videos from before 2014 I think gosh I miss some of that stuff. Maybe other forms of motorsport have not declined that much but I've always been an F1 fan first and I lost motivation to watch anything else when F1 was letting me down.\n\nAs I mentioned in another thread, I mainly just watch F1, but it's a time and commitment thing as much as anything else. I used to watch touring cars, but gradually did so less and less over the years, and it's not really a thing for me now. I think I got annoyed by the success ballast thing and reverse grids (particularly occurring together which just seemed stupid) and moved away from it. I'm not sure what it's really like now, but what I saw in the 00s definitely didn't seem as good as what was in the 90s.\n\nI've watched other things on and off over the years too, but I've never religiously watched anything like with F1, and since there are far too many F1 races now, I'm not actively seeking out other stuff. I'm not simply a robotic motorsports fan. I'm into other things too and I'm not going to give up my life for it.\n\nSo simplistically that would make me an F1 fan, but I'd say that I'm a motorsport fan who has selected F1 as the vehicle (pun noted) for that.\n\nHave followed F1 since I started reading Rob Walker's reports in Road & Track in the later '60's (yeah, I'm that old) but also got hooked on sports cars, and indycars after my first trip to Road America in the summer of '67... and I've been addicted to all of it since, even racing myself for several years in shifter karts, spec Miata, and spec racer Ford... and the gene was passed on to both my boys... even find myself getting more interested in the tin tops lately which I wouldn't have thought a few years ago.\n\nI used to watch nascar and indycar when it was free to watch on Eurosport - along with superbikes and motogp. Sadly no longer available if you don't pay for it with an arm and a leg to other channels. I love the Isle of Man and NorthWest 200 when its shown on ITV 4. Again with Eurosport I love their coverage of LeMans and tend to watch most of the race and the practice sessions as well, I wake during the night just to see how the race is going! Otherwise its F1 which I do pay Sky for and some drag racing classes on youtube. I've never been into any of the other motorsports like rallying or rallycross, banger racing etc, I've always lacked the attention span and find them pretty boring.\n\nEdited by Brian60, 21 August 2022 - 09:14.\n\nMotorsport in general - from a young age my dad would take me to race events, even if they were only small-scale club events rather than a professional series. Was often taken to BTCC events at Donington Park, Oulton Park or Silverstone, and would try and watch as much motorsport as I could find on TV, whether it was the WRC, MotoGP, or bits of Le Mans. Back in the heady days of when more motorsport was actually on free-to-view channels!\n\nThen I discovered Autosport magazine in my early teens, which I'd buy religiously most weeks, and which opened up another world of motorsport for me, for those series that weren't as easily accessible in the UK. Things like IndyCar, the American Le Mans series, Aussie V8s, etc.\n\nI've followed F1 for the longest, and it is still the one I follow most closely too - through a combination of factors such as having less time these days to devote to watching racing, or simply struggling to find anywhere to watch other series.\n\nBut I'm definitely a fan of motorsport first and foremost. For me, whilst I have drivers I like to see do well, it doesn't really matter to me who wins, so long as the racing is entertaining and exciting. I find it a bit depressing that it seems like a lot of newer fans seem to have adopted the football mentality of being a massive fan of one driver or team in particular, and not being able to enjoy it when their favourites don't win. Racing shouldn't be like that, or at least, it shouldn't be in my opinion.\n\nEdited by JHSingo, 21 August 2022 - 10:42.\n\nAuto racing in general, more specifically IndyCar and other North American series.\n\nIndyCar feels more interconnected to other series than F1 which revolves more around itself. I mean, IndyCar drivers regularly cross over to IMSA and several teams compete in both series. IMSA in turn is one of several more or less comparable sports car championships worldwide. Even NASCAR feels more interconnected to other series than F1 with NASCAR drivers doing dirt track racing or road course ringers coming over to NASCAR from other series. In F1 that kind of crossover is way less common.\n\nWhile I enjoy watching MotoGP, I've never gotten as much into bike racing as I'm into auto racing. Other than going fast with motorized machinery, it feels a bit like a different sport. Kinda the same with rallying or drag racing.\n\nThere is nothing unique about F1 compared to other motorsport ... even taking the money, tech and media attention into account.... its just a bigger scale not a qualitative difference .... and its not even that much bigger if you compare the back of the grid teams to teams in other series.\n\nSo I cant understand how someone could be a fan of F1 only .... what exactly are they a fan of in F1? .... the speed? the money? the media attention? ... those things are all superficial to racing .... and as I said before, none of that is unique to F1 in a way that is exclusive of other series or in a way that I find to be important.\n\nBut for the purposes of this board ... am basically an F1 fan ... and even more so, an LH fan (or SLH as I like to call him).... watching races on its own would not motivate me to write my rubbish on a public forum - or wade through the mostly rubbish that is posted here and elsewhere to find the nuggets of gold... but for reasons I wont go into now - but which you can probably guess - being a fan of LH has meant picking up the cudgels online to defend his honour.\n\n... I thought he was the best as far back as 2006 and I suspected he could be the best ever from about 2010ish ... but I never thought he would get a chance to prove it .... what a great decade and half of fandom Ive had out of it\n\nBut yeah ... if its just watching (esp on TV/online) I will watch anything with an engine race or do time trials.... there was even a time when I used to think I was fast/talented enough to participate.... now that would be a thread - \"Share your experiences of embarrassing/frustrating yourself as a motorsport competitor ....\".\n\nEdited by jjcale, 21 August 2022 - 14:24.\n\nI take an interest in lots of motorsports and have done on and off since I was a child. However F1 has been the constant, it was the first sport I became interested in and I've remained so ever since. Am pleasantly surprised by how enjoyable it is after some bleak years (for Grand Prix racing, that is) in the mid-2010s.\n\nI started following the sport through the mighty prototypes of 1970 - 1971, mainly thanks to my late father. I discovered Formula One later (by 1972 - 1973, I'd say), as a by product and also due to the downsizing of prototypes since 1972. Also, sometimes I caught interest in F1 because drivers were the same than in the Sports-proto Championship.\n\nAlthough I've always kept an eye on Sports-proto, the overwhelming media presence of F1, specially in the 21st century with the advent of the internet, has made me an F1 man more than any other thing.\n\nAt the beginning, I also had a keen interest in rallying, but I lost most of it after the demise of group B.\n\nAs opposite to many other fans here, I've never been specially interested in national, local or club racing. My only exception could be the French championship of Production cars c. 1980, but it was because I used to read plenty of French magazines. For me, motorsports has always been a global affair."
