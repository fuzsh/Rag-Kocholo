        "text": "WHAT IS WILLOW SPRINGS BOYS RANCH?\n\nWillow Springs Boys Ranch is a long-term residential childcare program that accepts applications from school age boys, dependent upon the range of ages currently with us. Boys are able to live on the ranch until they graduate from high school, obtain their G.E.D. or participate in an independent living program after graduation. The Ranch takes boys who find themselves in a family crisis or instability, in need of supervision or other at risk situations.\n\nWillow Springs Boys Ranch will not accept those with violent or aggressive behaviors. The focus of the program is preventative in nature. It is the Ranch's goal to provide an environment where boys can become successful and develop into productive adults. WSBR is a team of families that possess a passion for helping boys who need a second chance ... or for many, a first chance.\n\nWillow Springs Boys Ranch helps boys find appropriate ways to deal with struggles and face conflicts of life. WSBR utilizes each of its relational program components as opportunities to develop solid relational skills, coping skills, education, work ethic and character development in order to face the challenges of life. This lifestyle is not just talked about at Willow Springs, it is lived out daily in community. When boys leave Willow Springs, it is our goal that they leave with the tools to not just get by in life, but to live successfully and with confidence as productive men and leaders in their families and in our communities.\n\nStatement of Faith\n\nWe believe in one living and true God, the Creator of all things, perfect in love and righteousness. He is eternally existent as a Trinity of persons, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.\n\nWe believe in Jesus Christ, the one and only begotten Son of God, eternally with the Father and Holy Spirit. We believe in his miraculous physical birth and sinless life. We believe that his atoning death on the cross and the power of his bodily resurrection make him the only mediator between God and humans. Following his resurrection he ascended to the Father and will return in power and glory.\n\nWe believe in the Holy Spirit eternally with the Father and the Son. He convicts us of sin, leads us to divine mercy and grace, indwells our hearts, empowering us to live a godly life and imparts discernment and gifts to us for service.\n\nWe believe that God made humans in His image that he might have a relationship with us. This relationship was broken by original sin and as a result all people are sinful and separated from God. We are incapable of restoring a right relationship with God on our own. We are dependent on His divine grace.\n\nWe believe in the Scripture of the Old and New Testaments as the holy and inspired Word of God. We believe the Bible to be the inerrant, authoritative source of truth and the final rule in all matters of faith and practice. It proclaims God's redemptive plan and leads us to God's grace.\n\nWe believe that Salvation comes to those who by faith alone place their trust in Christ alone for His redemption and grace. Salvation is a free gift and cannot be earned.\n\nWe believe in the Church as the Body of Christ. The Church is the fellowship of persons professing their faith in Jesus Christ and the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit. The purpose of the Church is to proclaim the saving message of the Gospel and to continue Christ's ministry in the world."
