        "text": "Here's a baby WS Black Rat..\n\nshows the one shown you isnt one.\n\nThat confirms my suspicions...as common as Lindheimer's (Texas Rat or \"Chickensnake) are around this part of the Republic, and as much as the pic of the baby looks just like a Lindheimer's...I'll pass.\n\nMy daughter spent 2 or 3 months trying to get a baby Lindheimer's to stop biting, but he really never did, so I traded her her own Emory's, and for Xmas got her a really pretty Reverse Okeetee...much more pleasant pets!\n\nThe Lindheimer's was released in our barn, where he'll be more useful.\n\nAs I've said to others before - they're only a bargain if you want them. Sounds like you hadn't considered this type of snake before getting the offer, which gives pause for thought. You could end up with a bunch of cheap snakes that you don't actually want long-term. And presumably if they were easy to sell on, the breeder wouldn't be offering them at a knock-down price.\n\nI think you're right to take a step back, even before the doubt about the morph variation.\n\nJust some baby ratsnakes that I saw on Craigslist, and assumed were Lindheimer's, but inquired anyway...the seller responded that they were white-sided blacks, so we looked those up on Google and both my daughter and I thought they looked pretty sharp...but wondered why they were only $15 per (or $60 if we took all 7)...thought, though, if they radically changed colors as they matured, they might be coool to raise and eventually sell or trade for other interesting snakes, but I wanted confirmation as to what they were (and weren't)...\n\nEven on Craigslist, baby normal corns start around $25...\n\nAnyway, thanks to all who responded and we'll just keep looking...there's a big reptile show coming up in a month and I'm sure our $$$ can be better spent there!"
