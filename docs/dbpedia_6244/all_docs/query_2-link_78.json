        "text": "Kurten is a really unpleasant man. He ran in the Lewisham by-election for UKIP (as did Mandu Reid for WEP btw, I canvassed for her in 2018) and his campaign was nasty, he‚Äôs quite overtly racist as well.\n\nAs mentioned, very sadly, WEP don‚Äôt know what a woman is. Memorably dubbed the ‚ÄúWhatever Equality Party‚Äù and as an ex-member I cannot support them until they at least recognise the conflict between self-ID and WSBR and the plurality of beliefs and non-beliefs around gender. Seriously. They have one job.\n\nNone of the candidates are people that I actually want to vote for. So I find myself considering who do I most want to vote against? Realistically it will either be Sadiq Kahn or Shaun Bailey (whose only leaflet I‚Äôve seen so far was a very negative campaign). So which of those two men are the least awful?\n\nI wish Rory Stewart was still running. I‚Äôd probably have campaigned for him if he was.\n\nIt's not a great field, is it. www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-55748037\n\nMy thoughts reading through this list.\n\nShaun Bailey, Conservative - I can't vote Tory. Next.\n\nKam Balayev, Renew - need more info. The huge picture makes him look someone trying to sell a hypnosis course.\n\nSian Berry, Green Party - I'd rather take out my own teeth one at a time with pliers than vote for her or her party, given their recent form.\n\nCount Binface, Independent - I may have to vote for him (or her - who knows what may be under the bin?).\n\nValerie Brown, Burning Pink - ooh, she's a Black woman, not in her first youth, what does she say about herself? 'Burning Pink's candidate describes herself as a mother, grandmother and vigilante.' OK, moving swiftly on ....\n\nPiers Corbyn, Independent. FFS.\n\nDrillminister, Independent. ???? SE London born. Real name, age etc unknown. Hmmm.\n\nLaurence Fox, Reclaim Party. No, no, no. We don't need another blond attention-seeker as Mayor.\n\nPeter Gammons, UKIP. Nominative determinism.\n\nSadiq Khan, Labour. Predicted to win by a landslide, so he won't miss my vote.\n\nDavid Kurten, Heritage Party. 'sits with the Brexit Alliance Group on the London Assembly.' No.\n\nFarah London, Independent. Will look into this one further.\n\nWinston McKenzie, Unity in Action. 'The 2016 Celebrity Big Brother contestant is founder and leader of the Unity In Action party.' Wikipedia says he has been a member of every single political party at some point, and having failed to get elected anywhere he's now set up his own party. No.\n\nNims Obunge, Independent. Sounds well-meaning enough.\n\nLuisa Porritt, Liberal Democrats. LibDems don't want my vote, so that's easy.\n\nRosalind Readhead, Independent. Deep Green, supports Extinction Rebellion. I'm sympathetic to much of what she says but I don't like ER.\n\nMandu Reid, WEP. Sorry, Mandu, until your party works out what a woman is, you don't get my vote.\n\nBrian Rose, Independent. YouTuber, conspiracy theorist, anti-vaxxer, serial interviewer of David Icke. Another FFS here.\n\nIf Sadiq Kahn is so far ahead anyway then I honestly may not vote for Mayor. Or put a sticker over the ballot or something. I‚Äôve never not voted before when I‚Äôve been able to. What does voting for a minority candidate for mayor achieve? Highlight to the winner that you supported those policies?\n\nAnother dilemma is the assembly votes. I think you vote for a region candidate and also a party for the list candidates as well?\n\nNot that I know who my AM is now nor have really noticed anything the London Assembly does that has any actual impact."
