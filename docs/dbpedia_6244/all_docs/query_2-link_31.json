        "text": "11 SSI governance frameworks\n\nby Drummond Reed\n\nSelf-sovereign identity (SSI) is a cutting edge technology movement and SSI governance frameworks are at the cutting edge of SSI. As a result, there are still relatively few governance frameworks in production as examples to which we can point. However, many in the SSI community believe they will be a crucial part of SSI’s success. Our co-author Drummond Reed is one of the leading proponents of governance frameworks. He has co-chaired the Sovrin Governance Framework Working Group since 2016 and is a co-founder of the Trust over IP Foundation (ToIP) where he co-chairs the Governance Stack Working Group. These groups and others are focused on developing this aspect of SSI architecture. This chapter will use the ToIP stack and other initiatives in the space to explain how different governance frameworks are relevant to each layer of the stack. This subject will undoubtedly evolve over time; our aim is to provide a starting point for anyone who wants to explore and/or contribute to this area.\n\nIn chapter 2 we introduced the basic concept of the governance framework as a core building block of self-sovereign identity (SSI) architecture. In this chapter we’ll go much deeper into the special role governance frameworks play in fusing SSI technology with the realities of business, law, and society.\n\n11.1 Governance frameworks and trust frameworks: some background\n\n11.2 The governance trust triangle\n\n11.3 The Trust over IP governance stack\n\n11.3.1 Layer 1: Utility governance frameworks\n\n11.3.2 Layer 2: Provider governance frameworks\n\n11.3.3 Layer 3: Credential governance frameworks\n\n11.3.4 Layer 4: Ecosystem governance frameworks\n\n11.4 The role of the governance authority\n\n11.5 What specific problems can governance frameworks solve?\n\n11.5.1 Discovery of authoritative issuers and verified members\n\n11.5.2 Anti-coercion\n\n11.5.3 Certification, accreditation, and trust assurance\n\n11.5.4 Levels of assurance (LOA)\n\n11.5.5 Business rules\n\n11.5.6 Liability and insurance\n\n11.6 What are the typical elements of a governance framework?\n\n11.6.1 Master Document\n\n11.6.2 Glossary\n\n11.6.3 Risk Assessment, Trust Assurance, and Certification\n\n11.6.4 Governance Rules\n\n11.6.5 Business rules\n\n11.6.6 Technical rules\n\n11.6.7 Information trust rules\n\n11.6.8 Inclusion, equitability, and accessibility rules\n\n11.6.9 Legal agreements\n\n11.7 Digital guardianship\n\n11.8 Legal enforcement"
