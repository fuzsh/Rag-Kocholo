        "text": "Arthur Ravenscroft (1923-89) was born in South Africa and, after teaching at Stellenbosch University and the University of Rhodesia ( Zimbabwe ), came to Leeds in 1963. He was a founder, with A.N. Jeffares and Douglas Grant, of the Journal of Commonwealth Literature, and edited it from 1965-78. The Journal rapidly established itself as the leading periodical for debate about the emerging field of Commonwealth (and then later Postcolonial) literatures in which field the School was the first to establish a chair (see William Walsh). Arthur Ravenscroft, whose studies included a short but influential book on Chinua Achebe (1969), is commemorated in the Ravenscroft lectures at Leeds . His collected papers, including much material about the Journal, were given to Special Collections at the Brotherton Library in 1989 and are catalogued as Manuscripts: MS 1524.\n\nWe contacted Mr John Ravenscroft, operations manager of Bowls South Africa to see if they could shed some ilght on this pin badge. He referred to there history, and the only reference they could find, was as follows; \"1955, thirty South African women, acptained by Mrs. E J Friend, made the first overseas tour by South African women visiting England, Scotland, and Wales.\n\nPlease contact me\n\nThank you\n\nDr Tommy Ravenscroft\n\nThabazimbi\n\nSouth Africa\n\nHi\n\nJohn James Ravenscroft was my grandfather.

His ashes were brought to Canada and were scattered over the Rocky Mountains from aLockheed 12A, the same aircraft he flewin 1937 looking for a suitable transcontinental air route over Canada forTrans Canada Airways. John Henry Tudhope was one of the founding members of the National CanadianAirline. Molly Christopher, Billâs fiancÃ© from England, moved to Canada after the war,just as she had once agreed to do with Bill. She lived there remaining in close contact with Tudhopeâs relatives. Billâs only remaining sister, Nesta, went from Canada to South Africa where she married Arthur Ravenscroft in 1953. Their first son was christened William but called Bill, after his uncle Bill Tudhope and also after William Ravenscroft, the brother of Nestaâs husband who was killed in Egypt during WWII. When Nesta and Arthur conceived a daughter for their second child, Molly Christopher wasasked to be the godmother of their little daughter Anne Tudhope Ravenscroft.Later still, a second daughter Jill, sister to William and Anne, was born. Molly Christopher never married. Shedied in 1993 in Canada.\n\nB.Mus. (University of Cape Town)\n\nM.Mus.
