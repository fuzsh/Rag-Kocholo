        "text": "Uhm, are a privateer allowed to homologate the car?\n\nI've imagined that this is a \"problem\" in the FIA series, that you cannot, as a privateer homologate cars.\n\nJ.A.S. homologated the Honda Accord Euro R a few years back without factory support and Ford's factory support for Arena is also pretty limited. Unlike the first manufactor entry of Ford, the car is not built by Ford (2004 and 2005 two Focus were built by Ford Team RS and entered by Hofield Sport in ETCC and WTCC), but by Arena. As long as the manufactor agrees to the homologation it is no problem.\n\nThe airtime of WTCC increased even. Eurosport's qualifying coverage is something rather new. They also show the warm-up and the races.\n\nThey do that since 2006 already. Always on Eurosport 1, a channel with a reach of 400 million people, but recently they are putting Qualy sessions away on the second channel or don't broadcast it at all like last weekend.\n\nEurosport 2, at least here where i live, can only be viewed with a subscription, hence the reach is very much reduced.\n\nOur commercial broadcaster also shows highlights of the WTCC in every F1 weekend but its like two to three weeks old normally.\n\nI think much of the problem is there. I don't get it, if I'm able to secure funding for R&D of a Zastava Touring Car (I love such cars, that are less known, and strange). Why I need approval of Zastava to be able to race it in WTCC, when I can race it in almost every other series on earth.\n\nWell mainly because it is a World Championship with manufactor involvement. The brands want to position themselves against each other. It is not a clubsport/customersport thingy like the whole GT3 category (including its GT1 World Championship) is. Btw, with Zastava you might also need approval of FIAT, depending on the model, since Zastava licenses some FIATs I know.\n\nIt is a bit like dvds of films you didn't make or you don't own all rights of: If you show them your friends or a small circle of people it is fine, however you show them large crowds or even use them commecially you need approval by the one who owns the rights.\n\nStill getting into a rage about Eurosport. As if one channel with 8 HOURS tennis wasn't enough. Since the Moto GP days, it's gone downwards.\n\nMenu played Vaillant? I love the comics of Jean and Philippe Graton. I already thought they would use this for a movie again\n\nThat bit was unique display of wrong management... They partly even covered the same match on both channels -.- I mean, I can understand it - French Open are a Grand Slam. Ok. I can understand also that if you're covering a grand slam you might not show WSbR live, since it is not a top tier racing series. You also might not show AutoGP live for the same reason. But there is no room for a World Championship race left? I mean seriously. They could have at least done a Eurosport 2 coverage or, as Lotti did in a few years back, sell the rights of the races they can't show live to national broadcasters (they did that with Eurosport 2 covered races here even, which were then shown as simulcast at n-tv aka CNN Germany or as own production at ZDF, the forth largest TV channel over here). It is as bad as this ACO-Eurosport-MotorsTV deal, which allowes Eurosport to show only the last one or two hours of a FIA WEC race live, while MotorsTV has flag-to-flag coverage of all ACO or ACO licensed series (WEC, ELMS, IMSA ALMS). At least they have the flag-to-flag coverage of LeMans again this year.â€‹\n\n/rage\n\nHe cracked his front splitter so he lost around 7 tenths per lap the in the 13-14 last laps or so.\n\nHowever i think he milked it slightly at the end to see if Martin could pass Rockenfeller, he was very close, just a few more laps\n\nBruno cracked his splitter right in front of us. TV cameras didn't seem to catch it from the replay of the event I saw. Everyone was using the wide curbing on the outside of turn 1 but the very outside edge of it isn't completely straight edged and Bruno went too far out on it and basically hit a spot like a pot hole with an almighty bang. He actually broke away a bit of the paved curbing and the track marshals had a good look at it after the race. I thought at first with the way he slowed up that he may have damaged the suspension with the severeness of the whack he took.\n\nBruno cracked his splitter right in front of us.

The driver isn't, the team isn't, the country the track is at isn't, nothing was!\n\nSo again... why do they come with Michel now?\n\nBecause there is nothing else that was in any way French, so who would get the joke in Portugal?\n\nYeah, he is French(I've read so many I couldn't say I wouldn't know), but what for?

I mean they could have done it in the former French colony."
