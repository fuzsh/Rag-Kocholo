The list below sets out the reasons: –\n\nPersonal health and prescribed medications information are needed to assess that the requested treatments are suitable for the individual. Certain health issues/medications will be contra-indicated and will prevent treatments from being offered or cause certain cautions to be taken during treatments.\n\nA legal requirement by our Public Liability insurance company.\n\nContact information such as telephone, email and address for future points of communication, e.g. missed appointments, appointment reminders/changes or offers we think you may benefit from.\n\nThe client has the right to decide on which information they disclose to WSBR for manual recording. However, WSBR cannot be held responsible should the client decide to withhold important information that would have a direct effect on a treatment being offered and subsequent reactions that may occur because of the non-disclosure of relevant information. This includes at the initial consultation and subsequent appointments at the salon.\n\nOther recorded data\n\nAppointment visits are recorded, including notes on health changes, product choices, reactions and recommendations/advice given. This has to be recorded for the current Public Liability insurances that are in place and to offer the client a more personal experience during their time at WSBR.\n\nStorage of Personal data\n\nAll client data is held manually on the premises of WSBR in a locked cabinet. The Proprietor and Data Controller Wendy Simmons only has access to this cabinet.\n\nThis information is not shared with any other third party and is stored after a client’s initial consultation (as required by ABT insurance). If a client no longer patrons WSBR the personal data will remain on the property for a 7 year period after the last appointment date, as this is a legal requirement of ABT Insurance. After this period all information on individual clients will be destroyed.\n\nYou (the client) or previous clients have a right to view your/their personal information at any time during business operation hours. If you feel we have incorrect information held about you, please get in contact with Wendy Simmons straight away for immediate changes to be made. (See contact details below.)\n\nYou (the client) have a right for personal details such as contact details to be deleted from our records. You (the client), also have a right to ask us to remove your contact details that may be used for marketing purposes in the future. (See contact details below.)\n\nIn accordance with the new GDPR regulation every client whether previous (within 7 years of the new GDPR regulation), new or existing will need to be made aware of the legal information that is recorded by Wendy Simmons Beauty Room for the above listed reasons. Where an address or telephone number has been given, previous clients will receive a copy of this policy through the post or will receive a text explaining the new changes.\n\nUpon receipt of this policy or text, previous clients should get in contact with Wendy Simmons should they take issue with their records being kept. If we do not hear from you we will assume you give consent for Wendy Simmons Beauty Room to hold your contact data for the above stated reasons for 7 years after your last appointment date.\n\nComplaints\n\nIn the event that you wish to make a complaint about how your personal data is being processed by us you have the right to complain to us.
