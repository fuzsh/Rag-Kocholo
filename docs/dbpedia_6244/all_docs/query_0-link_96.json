        "text": "The orange tabby, Afton, proves there's no need for a hissy fit over how and what people love.\n\nLOADINGERROR LOADING\n\nKamala Harris’ campaign didn’t waste any time going for cat lovers after announcing Tim Walz as her running mate Tuesday morning.\n\nThe Democratic presidential campaign posted a video montage on social media showing several pics of the Minnesota governor’s rescue cat, Afton, and the “purr-fect” caption, “Cat people for Harris-Walz.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe video was both an appeal to cat fans and a way to troll Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance, who has come under fire for saying “childless cat ladies” were running the country, of whom he included Harris. (Harris has two stepchildren and does not own a cat.)\n\nVance, a Republican senator from Ohio, has been blaming cat people for the state of the American family since at least 2021, but there’s been a backlash to his resurfaced comments, which the Harris campaign is using to its advantage, as you can see below.\n\nApparently the orange tabby’s montage got the vote of many cat owners and other animal lovers to boot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom Our Partner"
