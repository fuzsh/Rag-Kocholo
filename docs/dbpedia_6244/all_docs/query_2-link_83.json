        "text": "We are fully back folks. Week 1 is here. We quickly run through the week's big matchups; UNC Minnesota, Colorado North Dakota State, Clemson Georgia, Miami Florida, Notre Dame Texas A&M (eeek), and USC LSU. Enjoy it folks. By the time you hear this, games will be less than 24 hours away. Giddy up.\n\nThe boys are back and firing off their college football season predictions in this week's episode. We pick every conference champion, our 12-team playoff, and tell everyone who's ass is getting fired first. We also answer some listener questions about bowl season, rebuilding teams, and who the Oasis of college football is. Week 1 preview will hit your feeds Wednesday evening!\n\nIn our next college football season preview, we take on teams that can win their conference. After saving his job, can Neal Brown take the Mountaineers to the next level? Who is going to push Utah for the Big 12 title among Oklahoma State, Kansas, and Kansas State? Is Clemson back??? Is Tennessee? And what did Oklahoma do to deserve this year 1 SEC schedule?\n\nIn our next college football season preview episode, the boys take on a group of teams who had good 2023s and are set up for less successful 2024 (except for Utah). Can Manny Diaz keep the mojo going at Duke? Can Tim Albin reload the Ohio Bobcats? Is Lincoln Riley the biggest fraud of all time? Where does Oregon State go from here? We also touch on UCLA, Maryland, Air Force, Northwestern, and Boise State.\n\nIn our next college football season preview episode, we tackle the teams who are ready to take the next step.

Thanks for listening folks\n\nIn our next college football season preview, we take on a new group of teams. Can South Carolina get back to a bowl game? Can Miami finally put it all together? Is Georgia Tech going to be able to navigate a tough schedule? Will I hunt Hugh Freeze like a fox? All that and more!\n\nWe are back again for our next college football season preview episode. This week we cover Colorado (you guys heard about this team??), Wake Forest, TCU, Nebraska, BYU, Florida, Washington State, Houston, Illinois, and Purdue. Which of these teams can take the next step to bowl eligbility? Which team is doomed? And which coach is firmly on the hot seat?\n\nYour favorite college football podcast is back! In this week's episode, we cover last year's bottom feeders and try and find avenues to improvement in 2024. We answer big college football questions: What is Clark Lea's plan at Vanderbilt in year 5? How will new coaches at San Diego State, Indiana, and Michigan State pilot their teams out of varying states of disaster? Can Dave Aranda, Pat Narduzzi, and Tony Elliot keep their jobs? Who is set up for the best year 2: Troy Taylor at Stanford? Scott Satterfield at Cincinnati? or Kenny Dillingham at Arizona State? (Not him. It's grim there)\n\nIts carousel SZN. the fellas break down conference championship week, the coaching carousel, big transfer portal news, and then get to the last studs n' duds of the regular season before breaking down various conference championships.\n\nThanks for listening along all season!\n\nIt's all here, grab a plate and getcha some: Ohio State Michigan, Iron Bowl, the SEC sucks, studs n' duds, Ned gets hopping mad about SEC shills, Ned talks too much in general, really heavy Ned episode if we're being honest. Maybe I shouldn't advertise that...\n\nIt's the best week of the year folks, enjoy it!\n\nwe open the show with breaking JMU news, discuss the bevy of new coach openings, and then break down a solid week 11. Georgia is for real, Penn State is half of a team, USC lost again, and one of us is SICK of tennessee. Then we preview Week 12, and one of us gets made about the SEC skating by with SoCon Saturday. (It's me. GROW UP!!!)\n\nThe college football gods knew the boys were together and delivered an absolute classic week. Alabama LSU, USC Washington, Texas K State, the final Bedlam, UGA Mizzou. man oh man!\n\nWe break it down, get to studs n' duds, and preview a decent enough Week 11.\n\nThank you for your support so far this season, been a fun one!\n\nThe boys break down a light Week 9, focusing on Kansas' upset and Oregon's domination of Utah then studs n' duds, fire his ass, and we laugh at Dabo and TY-LERRR. Then we break down a loaded Week 10 and prep for our upcoming corporate retreat\n\nPenn State and USC prove that it's hard for an old dog to learn new tricks, Alabama might be back, and we break down the Michigan sign stealing scandal. Then a quick Week 9 preview where we put a few teams on UPSET ALERT. Scary!\n\nWe break down Oregon Washington, Notre Dame's destruction of Caleb Williams and the Trojans, and a few wild ones in the ACC. Then your favorite segments: Studs n' Duds, Fire His Ass, and we discuss whether or not you should be able to knock out field stormers. Then we get to Week 8 previews and figure out who the hottest quarterback is.\n\nThe boys are back to break down the week 5 that was, preview a solid week 6, and take stock of the season at the halfway mark. Plus studs n' duds, fire his ass, and one of us goes nuclear on Pac McAfee's dumb ass.\n\nDid something happen last week?? We address the 10 man elephant in the room, look at how Alabama might be boring but back, and a heck of a week in the Pac 12. Studs n' Duds, Fire His Ass, and a nice Week 5 preview. Dont clip my comments about Duke if Notre Dame loses. you are NOT allowed to do that.\n\nThe less said about Week 3 the better! We quickly break down some odd results (looking at your Tennessee), some truly horrific losses (Mike Gundy, COME ON DOWN), and talk about the complete circus that the Colorado program has turned into. Then we preview an absolutely LOADED week 4. Ole Miss looks to fully derail Alabama, Notre Dame needs to make a statement, and Clemson has to win to save their ACC soul. Plus an absolutely loaded Pac-12 slate spreading across the whole day. Lovely!\n\nWe are back for our week 2 recap! Alabama might be dead, Ole Miss might be for real, and Texas A&M definitely stinks. Then we get into a middling Week 3 (and that's being generous), highlighting Tennessee Florida and then giving you a couple picks for each slot on Saturday. I also yell a lot. What could be better?\n\nAfter defeating TCU is Colorado the Colorado that ever Colorado? What about if Colorado Colorado Colorado? Ahhh but have you considered Colorado?\n\nWe also talk FSU/LSU, UNC/South Carolina, Clemson/Duke, and our week 1 studs n' duds, Fire His Ass is BACK, and we preivew a nice Week 2 slate. Texas Alabama, Ole Miss Tulane, UVA JMU, the WORKS. Thanks for listening!\n\nCOLORADO\n\nThe boys are back to quickly run through our top 5 teams. Can USC play enough defense to win the Pac-12? Can Alabama go smashy-smashy and win the SEC? Is Kyle McCord the answer for the Buckeyes? Can Michigan take the next step? And can anyone stop Georgia?\n\nThen we break down the top Week 1 games and then accidentally talk about like 8 more after that. Thanks for listening this offseason, everyone! Now let's watch some dang football.\n\nSecond episode in two days?? Boys are rocking AND rolling. Today we cover Washington's chance to win the Pac-12, Ned rants about Notre Dame for a while, then we ask if Clemson's 2022 was a blip or the start of a trend. Is LSU a true SEC contender? And we both take the Penn State pill. Then a quick week zero preview, a couple listener questions, and I really nailed the music fade-in on this one folks, stick around for that!\n\nThe boys are back after a quick break. We run through some quick starting quarterback news and then focus on the teams we love this year. Can Tennessee repeat 2022's magic? Can Bo Nix win the Heisman? Will Utah beat USC with hammers again? IS TEXAS BACK??? and finally, will anyone shut up about Florida State? We'll be back in a couple days to do teams ten through six, see you then!\n\nToday we cover a lot of Big 12 teams, plus Oregon State and Ole Miss and put a few coaches on preseason FIRE HIS ASS watch. Nothing better. Can Oklahoma get it together after a bad 2022? Is Ole Miss ready to challenge for the SEC West? Can DJ U take Oregon State to new heights? And after two dream seasons, can TCU and Kansas State have successful 2023s? Thanks for listening and start thinking of those questions for next week!\n\nToday we cover a wide variety of teams and convince ourselves that each of them can win ten games AT LEAST. Is Boise State back? Can South Carolina build off last year's amazing season? Can Tulane match last season's dizzying heights? How much longer is Mack Brown going to stick around at North Carolina? Can Luke Fickell get Wisconsin turned around this year? Then we close with some insane transfers you may have missed. Great...seven years of college down the drain...\n\nThe boys are back for their third season with a new season preview format! No longer will we be talking about Indiana and shit, we will be going through our preseason top 30, five teams an episode til the season kicks off in a few weeks. Today: #30 - #26: Arkansas, Florida, Texas Tech, Iowa and UTSA. PLUS stuff you should know going into this season. Is KJ Jefferson the best QB in the SEC? Can Joey Maguire keep the good vibes going in Lubbock? Can Billy Napier do enough this year to keep the Gators faithful patient? Can Iowa score 25 points a game? Can UTSA win the AAC in their first year? Did you know Army isn't running the triple anymore??? Thanks for listening and tell your friends.\n\nJoining the show today is Alex Kirshner. Alex is the co-host of Split Zone Duo, a college football twitter personality, and a writer with bylines in numerous publications. We talked marathon running, Hal Higdon training plans, his favorite Homefield t-shirts, how Split Zone Duo got started, how Iowa can become Ohio State, and if they have haters.\n\nAfter a short holiday break, the boys are back to break down the playoff and the rest of the NY6. Then they give their bowl season Studs n' Duds, Fire His Ass, and preview the national title game before answering a couple listener questions about jersey numbers and the USMNT. Thanks for listening!\n\nNed and Patrick are back to break down the non-NY6 games of bowl season. We give out best G5 games, studs n' duds, and a sicko game of the week of the year. Then we rapid fire pick every single bowl game and answer a listener question. See everyone next week for NY6 and CFP preview!\n\nThe boys are back to break down a few coaching hires and then the conference championship weekend that was. Although, mainly, Ned gets spitting mad at people who complain about the transfer portal. We will be back next week to preview bowl szn, join us, won't you?\n\nThe boys are back to discuss new coaching hires (mainly negatively), recap the rivalry week that was, and preview a pretty middling conference championship week. We mainly just talk bad about other men's jobs because we have no class and don't care who knows it! Thanks to everyone for listening along this year, as a treat, stay to the end to hear my audible disgust when a transfer QBs destination is announced!\n\nFolks, we made it! The best time of the year is here: Rivalry Week in all it's glory. We got the Egg Bowl, The Game, Tulane Cincinnati, The Civil War, The Apple Cup. The damn works folks. But first, we get to a couple week 12 games as most top 5 teams escaped tough tests. Then...we get to Tennessee who did not escape their test in the slightest. Studs n' duds, fire his ass, and a listener question sees one host enter into a fugue state.\n\nThe boys are back to break down the Pac-12's annual tradition of cannibalizing itself, TCU winning a tough game, and the SEC West sorting itself out. Then we get to studs n' duds, stick a few coaches in the dumpster, and break down a truly baffling Week 12. Mark my words, the SEC will pay for their crimes.\n\nWe are back after a wild week of college football. Georgia dispatched Tennessee, Notre Dame ran Clemson into the earth's core, and LSU got a huge win over Alabama and the boys are here to break it all down. Then we get to studs n' duds, fire a couple coaches, and preview Week 11. Savor it now, because next week is STINKY.\n\nThe boys are back for a quick episode. They wrap up a decent Week 9, covering Ohio State's late game charge, Tennessee's destruction of Kentucky, and Oklahoma State's bizarre no show. Then after dozens of hours of not doing it, we finally talk about Notre Dame. Both their blowout win over Syracuse last week and their big game this weekend against Clemson. Then we get to the BIG ONE: Tennessee Georgia. Patrick is totally not worried. No siree. We also cover other big games, studs n' duds, and fire a few coaches.\n\nThanks for listening!\n\nSyracuse, Ole Miss, Kansas State, UCLA, and Texas. Off to the realm of the almost. Clemson, Oklahoma State, TCU, and Oregon take a step up to the playoff race. Ned and Patrick break down all the movers and shakers of a busy Week 8 before heading into a, let's say, *light* Week 9.\n\nSee everyone at Hampden-Sydney Homecoming this weekend where you can knock me out cold for the Jimbo slander.\n\nThe boys get you ready for an excellent college football weekend ahead. We break down the Geoff Collins firing and other news, recap a wild Week 4, and then prepare you for the best weekend of the young season. Five ranked matchups. Excellent Big 12 games as far as the eye can see. And I don't even have to get mad at Notre Dame this week! Wow!\n\nHowdy everyone! Ned and Patrick are back to recap an overall eh Week 3, preview a decent Week 4, and go back to their favorite pet topic: trashing Texas A&M. Ned also gets mad about Michigan's schedule in a segment that started out with him praising them. So it goes. If you like the show, tell your friends, I'm trying to buy a private jet off podcast ads.\n\nThanks for joining us for the third edition of Serial Bowls Radio.

Great games every single day, Thursday had WVU Pitt, Friday had ODU upsetting VT, great games all day on Saturday, and then LSU eating shit on Sunday night. Delightful.
