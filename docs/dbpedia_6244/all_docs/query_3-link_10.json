        "text": "Last February I got an email out of the blue from Shiv Patel, asking if I could volunteer my day answering STEM questions about space with middle and high school students. Of course I said yes - I’d do that everyday if I could! What followed was an amazing day at the 2024 #NationalSTEMFestival put on by EXPLR that reminded me how fulfilling it is to leave the door open for those who come after us. It was amazing to talk space regulatory work and industry culture with Sirisha Bandla and discuss effective STEM policy in the classroom with Andrew Zimmern inbetween working with so many amazing students. The impact this event had on me made Kari Byron and Jenny Buccos’ subsequent request even more meaningful! I’m so excited to join the 2025 National STEM Festival Advisory Committee! You’ll be hearing a ton from me about how to get involved as a teacher, parent, or student in the coming weeks. Hopefully I’ll see you in DC next March! Ad Astra y’all. (And a special ping to Caledonia-Mumford High School, and Dr. Rebekah Chenaille - I’d love to put a few Project Lead the Way designs into the submission pool) More info here: https://lnkd.in/eTdXs28V"
