        "text": "Pole position for Ingo Gerstl at the “Forza Fanatec” in Mugello. Ghiotto holds his own against FORMULA leader Colombo and Andreas Hasler is fastest in the SUPER LIGHTS.\n\nIngo Gerstl (AUT, Top Speed) confirmed his role as favourite with the best time in qualifying. With a lap time of 1:26.747, the driver of a Toro Rosso STR1 secured pole position for the two race rounds in Mugello. Gerstl will be followed at the start by OPEN driver Harald Schlegelmilch (LVA, HS Engineering) in the World Series car with 4.5 litres capacity (instead of 3.5). Thomas Jackermeier (GER, Top Speed) will start from row 2. Jackermeier is competing for the first time in a Formula 1 car at Mugello and is doing excellently so far. Will he be able to step up a gear in the race and follow Gerstl?\n\nMarco Ghiotto (ITA, Scuderia Palladio) secured the best starting position in the highly competitive FORMULA classification. The two-time BOSS GP champion started in qualifying section 2 after a cautious Friday practice run and it took him a few laps to get past team-mate Francesco Malavasi (ITA) on the timings and then championship leader Simone Colombo (ITA, MM International). With a fantastic time of 1:35.035, Ghiotto qualified almost nine tenths of a second ahead of Colombo, who lost time especially in the first sector. Filling the starting row behind are BOSS GP rookie Francesco Malavasi and Luca Martucci (ITA, MM International), who is a candidate for the podium with a good qualifying performance on one of his favourite tracks. Team-mate Salvatore de Plano (ITA) follows behind.\n\nWith Joey Foster (GBR, HS Engineering) withdrawing from the event, the only World Series by Renault 3.5-litre pilot Paul O’Connell qualified sixth in class. Best from the Zig-Zag squad was Nicolas Matile (MCO) in the Auto GP Lola in eighth in class, just ahead of teammate Jean Christophe Peyre (FRA). Team leader Marc Faggionato (MCO) was unable to take part in practice after spinning and will therefore have a race to catch up.\n\nIn the SUPER LIGHTS category, rookie Alexander Geier (AUT, Geier Racing) only familiarised himself with the track today after still being in school yesterday. Geier’s Tatuus World Series V6, however, remained in the pits with gearbox problems, so Andreas Hasler (AUT, Hasler Motorsport) will start the races as the best-placed SUPER LIGHTS competitor. Walter Colacino (ITA, Colacino Motorsport) qualified his Formula 3000 in 15th place overall.\n\nThe first race starts today, Saturday, at 15:05 local time and is over a distance of 20 minutes, the second race over 25 minutes is scheduled for tomorrow, Sunday, at 13:15. In order to keep the workload on the Formula 1 cars low, the BOSS GP F1 Class will see the chequered flag after 15 minutes.\n\nPhoto: Angelo Poletto/BOSS GP\n\nThe Italian “double” to close the 2022 BOSS GP season starts next weekend with two races in Tuscany.\n\nBefore the 28th season of Europe’s fastest racing series enters its finale in Misano (4-6 November), it is time for Mugello, one of the favourite tracks of many drivers. While last year’s championship started at Mugello, this year’s Forza Fanatec at Mugello is already entering the crucial stage. In the BOSS GP FORMULA Class, six drivers (all of them in GP2 cars) still have a mathematical chance of becoming the champion.\n\nSimone Colombo (ITA, MM International), who made his BOSS GP debut at Mugello in 2021, has the best chance of winning the title at the moment. He leads by 33 points over defending champion Marco Ghiotto (ITA, Scurderia Palladio) and the Portuguese Zdenek Chovenec-Lopez (MM International). As in Brno, however, Chovanec-Lopez will not be competing. Luca Martucci (ITA, MM International), Walter Steding (GER, Scuderia Palladio) and Giancarlo Pedetti (ITA, Nannini Racing) still have outside chances. Francesco Malavasi (ITA, Scuderia Palladio), who has only been participating in the championship since Le Castellet in the summer, was on the podium twice in Brno and should also be considered for a possible podium in Mugello. With Marc Faggionato (MCO, Zig-Zag) and Salvatore de Plano (ITA, MM International), two former race winners return to the grid, which this time also includes a former professional racing driver: Joey Foster (GBR, HS Engineering) will give his comeback in monoposto racing. A total of 17 drivers have entered for the FORMULA classification, including the French team from Zig-Zag and two Lola AutoGP cars.\n\nTwo drivers from Team Top Speed, Ingo Gerstl (AUT) and Thomas Jackermeier (GER), will be competing in the BOSS GP F1 Class. They continue their Toro Rosso duel between Gerstl’s STR1 and Jackermeier’s STR3. Harald Schlegelmilch (LVA, HS Engineering) from the OPEN class will again try to chase the Formula 1 cars in his modified World Series bolide. In the six-cylinder car class, Andreas Hasler (AUT, Hasler Motorsport) will try to keep his increasingly fast pursuer in the overall SUPER LIGHTS standings, Alexander Geier (AUT, Geier Racing), at bay. All the best ingredients for an exciting race weekend in Mugello.\n\nEntry List:\n\nTrack:\n\nThe 5.245-kilometre Mugello circuit (built in 1974) is owned by Ferrari and traditionally hosts the MotoGP. Two years ago, the track in Tuscany also hosted a Formula 1 race (winner: Lewis Hamilton). The youngsters and gentlemen of the BOSS GP Racing Series can expect fluid and fast sequences of corners embedded in a hilly topography. Last year in partly wet conditions Marco Ghiotto took a double victory in the FORMULA class, in the OPEN classification Ulf Ehninger (GER, ESBA Racing) won race 1 in a Benetton, in race 2 Ingo Gerstl in a Toro Rosso.\n\nTimetable (CEST):\n\nFriday, 14 October 2022\n\n11:10–11:40 Free Practice 1\n\n14:05–14:35 Free Practice 2\n\nSaturday, 15 October 2022\n\n09:55–10:25 Qualifying\n\n15:05–15:25 Race 1 (20 minutes)\n\nSonntag, 16 October 2022\n\n10:00–10:10 Warm-up\n\n13:15–13:40 Race 2 (25 minutes)\n\nSupport races:\n\nThe Italian promoter Gruppo Peroni is again gathering numerous racing series from different categories in Mugello this year. In addition to the BOSS GP Racing Series as the main series, the Italian Topjet F2000 Trophy (together with the Drexler Formula Cup from Austria) is another single-seater racing series at the event. The Master Tricolore Prototipi features sports prototypes, the Lotus (Cup Italia) and Renault (Clio RS Cup) one-make cups and the historic GT cars of the Campionato Italiano Autostoriche will complete the line-up. The programme starts on Friday from 8:45 am (without lunch break) with practice and qualifying sessions. On Saturday and Sunday, the programme will start with the races from 9 a.m. each day.\n\nTickets:\n\nAdmission to the standing areas is free, the pit roof and main stand cost 10 respectively 15 euros at the box office. Discounts are available for under-18s, women and ACI club members. Children under 14 can enter for free when accompanied by an adult, and the same applies to residents of the municipalities of Scarperia and San Piero (FI).\n\nLive Stream:\n\nThe race programme on Saturday and Sunday will be partially broadcast on promoter Gruppo Peroni’s YouTube channel.\n\nPhotos: Michael Jurtin/BOSS GP, PR & Event Keke Platzer (Poster)\n\nAfter four class wins in a row, SUPER LIGHTS rookie Alexander Geier (16, from Salzburg) tells us in an interview about his career and his goals in motorsport.\n\nALEXANDER GEIER: “I started with a Formula König when I was eleven, we drove a lot with it. Then came a Formula Renault 2.0 built in 2002, with a sequential gearbox. Then, at 13, we bought a new Formula Renault, already with pedalshift. I raced it in the Histo Cup Austria until last year. Then Ingo Gerstl (Team Top Speed) gave me the chance to race in the BOSS GP Racing Series. For the next step, we bought the Tatuus World Series by Renault 3.5, which we now race in.”\n\nWhat skills does a driver need to be able to drive such a bolide?\n\nGEIER: “Basically, anyone can drive it. The brakes are only applied on the left, which is difficult for many people. Also, the clutch is on the steering wheel, driving away is difficult, but steering the car itself is doable with a bit of practice.”\n\nWhat makes the BOSS GP Racing Series special for you?\n\nGEIER: “Fast cars, the races – just everything. It’s quite different from anything I’ve driven before. Definitely more professional! The driving level of the series is also much higher than is often assumed. Of course, in some duels you do have to hold back because the cars are a bit older and there are often few spare parts. But that’s all too understandable because of the costs.”\n\nYou are on the events with your own team. How is that made up?\n\nGEIER: “In the past it was just my dad and me, we also do our own wrenching at home in the garage. Now there are always three of us on the road. Willi is a good friend of my father and now part of our team, he likes racing too.”\n\nWhat are your big goals for the future?\n\nGEIER: “The next step should come in 2023. We want to start with a Formula 2. We are training for that now and looking for sponsors. It’s almost impossible to pay for that ourselves, so we’re dependent on help here.”\n\nPhotos: Angelo Poletto/BOSS GP\n\nJackermeier celebrates double victory in the BOSS GP F1 class, Ghiotto triumphs in the hotly contested FORMULA class, Geier in SUPER LIGHTS also in a class of his own on Sunday.\n\nAfter the weather gods made it rain on Saturday, the race on Sunday remained dry despite dark clouds. In ideal conditions, there were plenty of wheel-to-wheel duels for the fans to marvel at during the Masaryk Racing Days.\n\nBOSS GP F1 Class\n\nAfter his premiere victory on Saturday, Thomas Jackermeier (GER/Top Speed) followed up with another win on Sunday. Right from the start, the German pulled away unstoppable in his Toro Rosso STR3 and did not let anyone take the lead from him. With a high and constant pace, Jackermeier controlled the lead. His pursuers were no match for the German. In the championship, Jackermeier continues to make up ground on series dominator Ingo Gerstl (AUT/Top Speed). Gerstl did not start in the second race. The championship battle is thus picking up speed again with two race weekends to go.\n\nBOSS GP FORMULA Class\n\nThe duel of the race was between Saturday’s winner Simone Colombo (ITA/MM International) and Marco Ghiotto (ITA/Scuderia Palladio). The two FORMULA class rivals fought a wheel-to-wheel duel for several laps. Ghiotto followed Colombo like a shadow, as he had done in Spielberg and Le Castellet. The fans were more than thrilled by the tough but fair duel. With just under ten minutes to go in the race, Ghiotto made the decisive manoeuvre at the entrance of the last corner and took the lead. With a clear track, Ghiotto was able to put a gap between himself and Colombo. Colombo tried to counterattack again towards the end of the race, but was unable to counter Ghiotto’s fast pace today. A few minutes before the end, Colombo had to let Ghiotto’s team mate Francesco Malavasi (ITA/Scuderia Palladio) pass. Malavasi thus secured his second podium this weekend after third place on Saturday. Malavasi, however, did not make a final attack on the victory. Salvatore de Plano (ITA/MM International) came close to Colombo towards the end of the race in fourth place, but was unable to catch his compatriot. Luca Martucci (ITA/MM International) rounded off a perfect Italian day. With his victory yesterday and his second place today, Colombo also takes over the overall lead from Zdenek Chovanec Lopez in the FORMULA class before the final two race weekends in Mugello and Misano.\n\nBOSS GP SUPER LIGHTS Class\n\nAndreas Hasler (AUT/Hasler Motorsport) was ahead on the grid, but after only a few metres rookie Alexander Geier (AUT/Geier Racing) took the lead from Hasler. Hasler could not follow Geier’s fast pace. Geier then controlled the action in the SUPER LIGHTS and thus made himself a double winner at the race weekend in Brno. The driver from Salzburg is also making up ground in the championship. Hasler tried to bring his second place in the SUPER LIGHTS class safely to the finish line, which he succeeded in doing.\n\nThe BOSS GP will take a short break and continue its season in Mugello in mid-October (14–16).\n\nPhotos: Angelo Poletto/BOSS GP\n\nJackermeier celebrates his premiere victory in tricky conditions, Colombo turns “pole” into victory in FORMULA class, SUPER LIGHTS triumph for Geier.\n\nThe weather gods had no mercy on the drivers of the BOSS GP Racing Series. A few minutes before the start of the first race, the heavens opened their floodgates. The race on the partly wet track thus became a challenge for the pilots in their Big Open Single Seaters.\n\nBOSS GP F1 Class\n\nPole setter Thomas Jackermeier (GER, Top Speed), like his team mate Ingo Gerstl (AUT, Top Speed), was faced with a difficult decision in the Formula 1 car class due to the rain shower before the start of the race: keep dry tyres on or put on the Pirelli Cinturato wet weather tyres? Parts of the track were damp, others dry. Jackermeier and Gerstl both opted for the dry tyres on their cars. Jackermeier with his Toro Rosso STR3 with Ferrari V8 made ideal use of the pole position and started furiously into the race. Ingo Gerstl came into the pits after the warm-up lap and had to stop his Toro Rosso STR1 temporarily. A few minutes before the end of the race Gerstl drove back onto the track but promptly returned to the pits. Jackermeier managed the lead ideally, made no mistakes in the treacherous conditions and celebrated his first victory in the BOSS GP.\n\nBOSS GP FORMULA Class\n\nAll drivers in the FORMULA Class opted for the Pirelli P Zero dry tyres at the start of the race. The driving skills of the steering wheel acrobats were thus put to the test even more. Simone Colombo (ITA, MM International) made ideal use of his first starting position and was able to pull away first in the drying conditions. Marco Ghiotto (ITA, Scuderia Palladio) held back in the initially damp conditions. However, the experienced Italian put rival after rival to the sword and worked his way up to second place. In the final minutes there was a thrilling duel between Colombo and Ghiotto for the win, but Colombo managed to save the victory over the finish line. Francesco Malavasi (ITA, Scuderia Palladio) drove in second place for a long time, but after a hard fight on the start-finish straight he had to let his team boss and colleague Ghiotto pass. Salvatore de Plano (ITA, MM International) and Walter Steding (GER, Scuderia Palladio) rounded off the top-5 of this spectacular race in FORMULA class. Andreas Fiedler (GER, Fiedler Racing), who was classified in the front of the field in qualifying, came into the pits just before the end of the race and had to park his GP2 car early.\n\nBOSS GP SUPER LIGHTS Class\n\nIn the SUPER LIGHTS category of the six-cylinder cars, Alexander Geier (AUT, Geier Racing) secured the next victory ahead of Andreas Hasler (AUT, Hasler Motorsport). Geier, who started the race on slicks, took the lead from Hasler shortly after the start and eventually controlled the pace at the front. In the final sprint Hasler tried to close the gap to Geier once more. Ultimately in vain, Hasler drove home a safe second place in drying conditions.\n\nAfter the spectacle today, the fans can look forward to part 2 of the racing action on Sunday. The second and final race of the BOSS GP in Brno will take place tomorrow from 12:50 local time (livestream).\n\nPhotos: Angelo Poletto/BOSS GP\n\nColombo with surprising best qualifying time, Jackermeier on pole position in the BOSS GP F1 Class, Hasler dominates SUPER LIGHTS in Brno.\n\nFormula 1 rookie Thomas Jackermeier (GER, Top Speed) will take the BOSS GP F1 Class to the green flag for the first time in his career. The German set the fastest time of 1:47:271 in his Toro Rosso STR3, Sebastian Vettel’s legendary winning car at Monza in 2008. Series dominator Ingo Gerstl (AUT, Top Speed) did not take part in qualifying with his Toro Rosso STR1, but will try to take part in the race.\n\nThe absolute fastest time in qualifying for both BOSS GP races was set by Italian Simone Colombo (ITA, MM International). Colombo played to the aerodynamic strengths of his Formula 2 car and secured pole position in the FORMULA class. His time of 1:43:879 could not be beaten by any of his rivals. Defending champion Marco Ghiotto (ITA, Scuderia Palladio) was more than two seconds ahead in second place with 1:46:733. The top three were completed by Francesco Malavasi (ITA, Scuderia Palladio) with a time of 1:46:776, Malavasi’s best qualifying performance so far. Andreas Fiedler (GER, Fiedler Racing) will start the race from fourth place with a time of 1:47:192. For him, it is a good result on his comeback after numerous technical problems.\n\nIn the BOSS GP SUPER LIGHTS, Andreas Hasler (AUT, Hasler Motorsport) secured the best time with 2:01:679. He thus distanced his main rival Alexander Geier (AUT, Geier Motorsport) by more than a second.\n\nThe races scheduled for today, Saturday, at 2 p.m. and tomorrow, Sunday, at 12:50. Before the races, there will be a grid walk for spectators on site, and you can watch the races from home via livestream.\n\nPhotos: Angelo Poletto/BOSS GP\n\nRene Arnoux presents the winners’ trophies to Gerstl, Schlegelmilch, Chovanec-Lopez and Geier.\n\nThe atmosphere at the third event of the 2022 BOSS GP season was unique: visitors had the opportunity to buy tickets for the grid walk and thus get close to Big Open Single Seater and experience the tension before the start at first hand. Not only hundreds of fans took advantage of this, but also the French racing legends Jean Alesi, Rene Arnoux and Jean-Pierre Jarier. They were on hand for souvenir photos, as were the BOSS GP cars and their current drivers.\n\nBOSS GP F1 Class\n\nToro Rosso, Benetton and Jaguar in a joint race – this unique picture was delivered by the BOSS GP Racing Series in Le Castellet. The legendary Formula 1 cars completed the first laps of Sunday’s race in formation, but in the end the same result as the day before was in the books: Ingo Gerstl (AUT, Top Speed) took the win ahead of Ulf Ehninger (GER, ESBA Racing) and Didier Sirgue (FRA, LRS Racing).\n\nBOSS GP OPEN Class\n\nOnce again Harald Schlegelmilch (LVA, HS Engineering) was chasing the Formula 1 cars in the World Series car with an improved V8 engine. With the fastest race lap, the Latvian won the OPEN class, which was newly introduced this year for cars without a displacement limit. To the delight of the fans who held out in the heat, he did some donuts after the race, immortalising himself at the Circuit Paul Ricard.\n\nBOSS GP FORMULA Class\n\nThe Portuguese Zdenek Chovanec-Lopez (MM International) was unbeatable again today, Sunday, in a race that was 5 minutes longer than the day before. Again MM International team mate Simone Colombo (ITA) was involved in a thrilling fight for position 2 behind Chovanec-Lopez. This time, however, he defended the position in the last third of the race against Marc Faggionato (MCO, Zig-Zag). With degrading tyres towards the end of the race, Colombo kept his nerve and thus also second place. Faggionato managed a conciliatory result with third place after retiring early yesterday after a spin. Once again, Francesco Malavasi (ITA, Scuderia Palladio) was left without a place on the podium. With a further improvement in performance, however, he was ultimately only a good seven seconds off the podium. His team boss and racing colleague Marco Ghiotto (ITA, Scuderia Palladio) retired already in the early stages. This means a setback for the overall standings. The defending champion is now already 47 points behind Chovanec-Lopez and 35 behind Colombo.\n\nThe best Frenchman in this class was Alain Girardet (FRA, GDL Racing) in his World Series car in the second race. Luca Martucci (ITA, MM International) finished in sixth place. This is remarkable, because the Italian had to fight his way back to the front from the end of the field after a spin in the early stages. The fights for positions behind were also worth seeing, among others with David Moretti, Walter Steding and Thomas Jackermeier.\n\nBOSS GP SUPER LIGHTS Class\n\nAlexander Geier (AUT, Geier Racing) sensationally managed to do the double at his BOSS GP race debut: The only 16-year-old Austrian in the V6 World Series car did a good job today as well and even dueled with the faster FORMULA cars at times. With two race wins and the full points tally this weekend, he was able to make up some points on the first-placed driver in the overall standings, Andreas Hasler (AUT, Hasler Motorsport).\n\nThe BOSS GP Racing Series now takes a summer break. Nevertheless, there is still work to be done, because the teams are using the time to revise the high-end racing cars and make them ready for the second half of the season. In twelve weeks, Europe’s fastest racing series will continue this year’s championship. At the traditional Masaryk Racing Days in Brno from 9 to 11 September, races 7 and 8 of the season will be held.\n\nPictures: Jean-Marie Biadatti/PhotoClassicRacing.com, SMW MEDIA\n\nIn front of the shining eyes of French racing legends Jean Alesi and Rene Arnoux, the BOSS GP drivers and their unique bolides braved the heat of the Cote d’Azur.\n\nThe 20 drivers of the BOSS GP Racing Series started the fifth race of the 2022 season at an outside temperature of 32 degrees Celsius. Because one vehicle stalled at the pre-start and recovery took some time, the race was restarted a few minutes later behind the safety car.\n\nBOSS GP F1 Class\n\nIngo Gerstl (AUT, Top Speed) did what he had done many times in 2022: controlling the pace. Mindful of the valuable Toro Rosso F1, he tried to keep his rivals under control in the rear-view mirror. He succeeded with style, winning the F1 classification for the fifth time this year. After some technical problems on the Benetton B197, Ulf Ehninger (GER, ESBA Racing) also saw the chequered flag again today. At his first start in Le Castellet he drove a flawless race, which was rewarded with points for second place. At the beginning of the race Didier Sirgue (FRA, LRS Racing) followed him in the rear-view mirror. However, he subsequently lost contact to Ehninger. Nevertheless, Sirgue, who made his BOSS GP comeback after a break of several years, finished the race in third place in the beautiful Jaguar R2 (with R5 livery).\n\nBOSS GP OPEN Class\n\nHarald Schlegelmilch (LVA, HS Engineering) was allowed to pick up the winner’s trophy for the class without engine capacity limit. However, his own incentive is to chase the Formula 1 cars. With the fastest lap of 1:48.371, the former Formula 3 professional was also only a few tenths off the fastest lap of the race in the first race, driven by Ingo Gerstl.\n\nBOSS GP FORMULA Class\n\nZdenek Chovanec-Lopez (PRT, MM International) extended his lead in the fiercely contested FORMULA Class classification with his fourth win of the season. However, the most exciting duel of the race again took place behind the race winner. Simone Colombo (ITA, MM International) and Marco Ghiotto (ITA, Scuderia Palladio) seamlessly continued their duel from the last race weekend at the Red Bull Ring. Throughout the race Ghiotto “hung” in Colombo’s gearbox, several times he tried to pass Colombo, even on the approach to brave turn “Signe” at the end of the long Mistral straight. In the end, it was Colombo again who held on to second place, as he had done in Spielberg. Francesco Malavese (ITA, Scuderia Palladio) narrowly missed the podium with 4th place. Behind Malavese followed the fastest Auto GP Lola of Nicolas Matile (MCO, Zig-Zag). Matile did not allow himself a break, but also took part in the race of the Formula 1 cars from the 1970s afterwards. Walter Steding (GER, Scuderia Palladio), who was able to drive to the chequered flag after technical problems in qualifying, and Thomas Jackermeier (GER, Top Speed), who had switched from Formula 1 to the GP2 Dallara after a gearbox failure on his Toro Rosso STR3 on Friday, finished 6th and 7th place. Best Frenchman in the FORMULA classification was David Moretti (Griffith’s) in ninth.\n\nBOSS GP SUPER LIGHTS Class\n\nThe youngest competitor in the BOSS GP Racing Series at 16 years of age, Alexander Geier (AUT, Geier Racing), converted his first pole position at his first race appearance straight into a victory. This meant that Andreas Hasler (AUT, Hasler Motorsport) was unable to take full points for the first time this season. With second place, however, Hasler remains unchallenged in the lead of the standings.\n\nThe sixth race of the season follows tomorrow Sunday at 3:30 p.m. local time. Before that, there will be a ten-minute warm-up at 9:35 am. The race can be followed live on French television and as today on the YouTube channel of the TV station Automoto la chaîne (only in France).\n\nPictures: SMW MEDIA\n\nQuickest times for Gerstl, Schlegelmilch, Chovanec-Lopez and Geier in qualifying for the French Historic Grand Prix at Circuit Paul Ricard.\n\nIngo Gerstl (AUT, Top Speed) leads the BOSS GP F1 Class to the green light for the fifth time this season. Gerstl in the Toro Rosso STR1 took the clear pole position for the two races at the Le Castellet Grand Prix circuit with a time of 1:42.953. Next best F1 driver in qualifying was Ulf Ehninger (GER, ESBA Racing) in his Benetton B197. Ehninger is racing at Le Castellet for the first time and is already coping amazingly well with the demanding circuit on day two. A highlight for the French fans is the appearance of Didier Sirgue (FRA, LRS Racing) in the Jaguar R2. Sirgue qualified third in Eddie Irvine’s car from the 2001 Formula 1 season. As recently proved at the Red Bull Ring, the F1 Class will again start the race at the Grand Prix de France Historique around twenty seconds ahead of the rest of the field. This is to reduce the risks at the start of the race.\n\nThe closest to Gerstl’s best time was again Harald Schlegelmilch (LVA, HS Engineering) in his modified World Series car. Schlegelmilch is therefore the favorite to win the OPEN classification.\n\nThe leader of the FORMULA class, Zdenek Chovanec-Lopez (PRT, MM International), also set the pace in qualifying. Simone Colombo (ITA, MM International) qualified second in class, ahead of fast BOSS GP returnee Marc Faggionato (MCO, Zig-Zag). Close behind was Marco Ghiotto (ITA, Scuderia Palladio), who managed to move up the results list from far behind with a spot-on lap just before the end. Francesco Malavasi (ITA, Scuderia Palladio) was able to meet the expectations after the good practice sessions on Friday and finished fifth ahead of Luca Martucci (ITA, MM International).\n\nIn the BOSS GP SUPER LIGHTS Class, Alexander Geier (AUT, Geier Racing) prevailed over his compatriot and season dominator Andreas Hasler (AUT, Hasler Motorsport). Geier thus also rewarded his team, which put a lot of working time into the Formula Renault bolide with V6 engine after a fire at Hockenheim.\n\nThe two races will start today (Saturday) and tomorrow (Sunday) at 3:30 p.m. local time. There will already be the grid walk from 2:50 p.m. The races can be followed live on the Automoto La chaîne YouTube (only in France) stream.\n\nPicture: Jean-Marie Biadatti/PhotoClassicRacing.com\n\nThe BOSS GP Racing Series is coming to Le Castellet with a top-class starting field for the French Historic Grand Prix (June 17-19, 2022).
