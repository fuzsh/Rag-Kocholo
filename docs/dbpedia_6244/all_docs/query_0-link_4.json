It was an evening filled with like-minded individuals who are passionate about their ambitions and dreams. Countless meaningful conversations flowed seamlessly throughout the event. Great to connect with you all ü§ù The highlight of the night was the speech delivered by Rob Dance. It was inspirational but he also provided practical insights and examples to help us achieve outstanding results. He went beyond just speaking; he offered a platform for questions and committed to ongoing support for professionals like us. That was the üçí on top! Rob and I had an interesting conversation. We shared some insights. My üîë takeaway is: \"You work, you learn, you succeed, and in return, you share your knowledge to help others create their own path using the blueprint you provide. Knowledge is at its best when it's shared.\" Let's continue to network, connect, and uplift each other. üí™ü§ù #Networking #ProfessionalDevelopment #KnowledgeSharing #CardiffYouth\n\nThe events industry is a key part of the social and economic fabric of Scotland. 'Scotland: the perfect stage' was first published in 2008 as a strategy for supporting and further developing the events sector in Scotland. This has undergone an extensive review and renewal process to focus on where the sector will be by 2035. It has included a consultation process which took place this summer. We provided the analysis of this consultation which identified key themes and areas of focus. This work will input into policy development to help support this vibrant and exciting sector for the next 10 years. üìã To read about our findings: https://lnkd.in/excD43kE üé≠ To find out more about our work in this area: https://lnkd.in/ergJ6rPu üìë To read the full report: https://lnkd.in/e3A4j5cZ üëâ To find out more: Andy Parkinson VisitScotland #ConsultationAnalysis #WavehillResearch #Scotland #Events\n\nAs we all know, minority-owned businesses play a vital role in our local economy.
