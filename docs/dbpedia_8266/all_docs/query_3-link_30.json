        "text": "Both of the satyrs were shirtless, with hairy chests and freckled shoulders. From the waist down they had the furry196 legs and hooves of a goat. Newel had redder hair, morefreckles, and slightly longer horns than Doren.\n\nGlad you found us, Newel said, trying to smile. Sorry you happened by when Doren was being a knucklehead.\n\nMaybe Seth can solve this one, Doren said.\n\nNewel closed his eyes in exasperation. He wasn't here to see the point.\n\nIf you both think you're right, do it over, Seth said.\n\nNewel opened his eyes. I could live with that.\n\nMe too, Doren agreed. Seth, your new nickname is\n\nSolomon.\n\nYou mind letting us finish this game? Newel asked.\n\nJust so we can keep momentum? No fun to start again cold.\n\n-- Advertisement --\n\nGo ahead, Seth said.\n\nYou be line judge, Doren said.\n\nSure.\n\nThe goatmen trotted into position. Newel was serving.\n\nForty-fifteen, he called, tossing a ball into the air and hitting it briskly into play. Doren hit a hard crosscourt forehand, but Newel was in position and hit it back with a gentle slice that took a soft bounce with a lot of spin. It looked unreachable, but Doren dove and managed to get his racket under the ball before the second bounce, popping it over the net. Newel had read the situation well and was already charging forward. As Doren scrambled up, Newel slammed the ball into the far corner of the court, bouncing it deep into the bushes.197 Go fetch it, nitwit! Doren said. You didn't have towail it into the woods. You had an open lane.\n\nHe's sore because I just went up five games to three,\n\nNewel explained, twirling his racket.\n\nI'm sore because you're trying to show off for Seth!\n\nDoren said.\n\nYou're saying you wouldn't have slammed it if I'd hit you apathetic lob?\n\nYou were at the net! I would have just tapped it at a brutal angle. Better to win with finesse than to hunt for balls in the shrubbery.\n\nYou're both really good, Seth said.\n\nThe two goatmen looked pleased by the compliment.\n\nYou know, satyrs invented tennis, Newel said, balancing his racket on the tip of his finger.\n\nThey did not, Doren said. We learned about it on\n\nTV.\n\nI like your rackets, Seth said.\n\nGraphite, light and strong, Newel said. Warren got us our equipment. Back before he went all Boo Radley on us.\n\nThe net, the rackets, a few cases of balls.\n\nWe built the court, Doren said proudly.\n\nAnd we maintain it, Newel said.\n\nThe brownies maintain it, Doren corrected.\n\nUnder our supervision, Newel amended.\n\nSpeaking of tennis balls, Doren said, most of ours are flat, but with the supply dwindling, it always kills us to open a new can. If our battery arrangement works out, think you night be able to score us some new balls?198 If this works out, I'll get you whatever you want, Sethpromised.\n\nThen let's get down to business, Newel said, setting down his racket and rubbing his palms together. You have the merchandise?\n\nSeth scrabbled through his emergency kit and pulled out eight batteries, lining them up on the ground.\n\nWould you look at that, Doren marveled. Have you ever seen such a gorgeous sight?\n\nIt's a start, Newel said. But let's face it, they'll run out before long. I assume there are more where those came from?\n\nLots more, Seth assured him. This is just a test run. If\n\nI remember right, you said something about batteries being worth their weight in gold.\n\nNewel and Doren shared a glance. We think we may have figured out something you'd like more, Newel said.\n\nFollow us, Doren said.\n\nSeth walked with the satyrs over to a little white shed not far from the net. Newel opened the door and ducked inside. He came out holding a bottle. What do you say?\n\nNewel asked. A bottle of fine wine for those eight batteries.\n\nPotent stuff, Doren confided. It'll put hair on your chest in no time. Good luck getting something like that from your grandparents.\n\nSeth looked back and forth at the two satyrs. Are you serious? I'm twelve years old! Do you think I'm an alcoholic or something?199 We figured something like this might be tough for youto get, Newel said with a wink.\n\nGood wine, Doren said. Primo.\n\nThat might be true, but I'm just a kid. What am I going to do with a bottle of wine?\n\nNewel and Doren shared a nervous glance. Well done,\n\nSeth, Newel said awkwardly, ruffling his hair. You...\n\npassed our test. Your parents would be very proud.\n\nNewel elbowed Doren. Yeah, um, sometimes we test people, Doren said. And play jokes.\n\nNewel went back into the shed. He returned holding a blue frog with yellow markings. Seriously, here is what we really had in mind, Seth.\n\nA frog? Seth asked.\n\nNot just any frog, Doren said. Show him.\n\nNewel tickled the frog's belly. Its air sac swelled up to the size of a cantaloupe, and the frog let out a tremendous belching sound. Seth laughed in surprised delight. The satyrs laughed with him. Newel tickled the frog again and the thunderous belching sound repeated. Doren was wiping away mirthful tears.\n\nSo what do you say? Newel asked.\n\nEight lousy batteries for one incredible frog, Doren said. I'd take it.\n\nSeth folded his arms. The frog is pretty cool, but I'm not five years old. If it's between gold and a burping frog, I'll take the gold.\n\nThe satyrs frowned, clearly disappointed. Newel nodded200 at Doren, who slipped into the shed and returned holding abar of gold. He handed it to Seth.\n\nSeth turned the bar over and over in his hands. It was about the size of a bar of hotel soap. An N was embossed on one side. Otherwise it was a plain, golden rectangle, a little heavier than it looked. Probably enough gold to be worth a lot of money.\n\nThis is more like it, Seth said happily, placing the gold inside his emergency kit. What does the 'N' stand for?\n\nNewel scratched his head. Nothing.\n\nRight, Doren said hastily. Stands for 'nothing.'\n\nNothing? Seth said dubiously. Why would somebody write an 'N' for 'nothing'? Why not just leave it blank?\n\nNewel, Doren tried. It stands for Newel.\n\nUsed to be my favorite belt buckle, Newel added wistfully.\n\nYou wore pants? Seth asked.\n\nLong story, Newel explained. Let's not dwell on the past. Fact is, there are more-um-belt buckles where that came from, all pure gold. You bring us more batteries, we'll keep trading with you.\n\nWorks for me, Seth said.\n\nThis could be the beginning of a spectacular partnership,\n\nNewel said.\n\nDoren raised a cautionary hand, halting the conversation.\n\nYou hear that?\n\nThe three of them paused, listening. Something's corning,\n\nNewel said, eyebrows knitting together. No matter how the satyrs behaved, they usually had an air about them that201 everything they said was tongue-in-cheek. That air wasgone.\n\nThey kept listening. Seth heard nothing. Are you guys fooling with me? he asked.\n\nNewel shook his head, holding up a finger. I can't place it. You?\n\nDoren was sniffing the air. Can't be.\n\nYou better scram, Seth, Newel said. Get back to the yard.\n\nWith the gold, right? Seth suspected they might be trying to trick him out of his reward.\n\nOf course, but you better hur-\n\nToo late, Doren warned.\n\nA creature the size of a pony burst out of the bushes onto the tennis court. Seth recognized it immediately. Olloch?\n\nOlloch the Glutton? Newel asked Seth.\n\nI thought it smelled like a demon, Doren groaned.\n\nYeah, Seth said. He bit me.\n\nGrotesquely toadlike, Olloch reared back and opened his mouth. It looked like the demon had swallowed a squid, so many flailing tongues emerged. Sitting upright, Olloch was nearly as tall as Seth. After a triumphant roar, the demon lowered his head and charged, advancing in a jerky, scrambling crawl.\n\nNewel grabbed Seth's hand and hauled him away from the demon. Run! Newel yelled.\n\nFor television! Doren cried, brandishing his tennis racket and holding his ground. Olloch pounced at the satyr, but Doren lunged aside, swatting away a pair of tongues with202 the racket. Several more tongues lashed out, wrenching theracket from Doren's grasp. The tongues pulled the racket into a gaping mouth, and moments later expelled it with the strings missing and a crack in the frame.\n\nSeth had reached the bushes at the edge of the court when Olloch, ignoring Doren, took a huge leap toward him and then charged with frightening speed. Seth knew he wouldn't make it back to the path, let alone to the yard. His mind raced, trying to think if there was anything useful in his emergency kit.\n\nTongues writhing, the demon sprang. For batteries!\n\nNewel cried, intercepting the glutton in midair and wrapping both arms around its middle.\n\nTo the shed! Doren called, retrieving his unstrung racket and running toward the demon.\n\nSeth turned and dashed toward the shed. Growling and slobbering, Olloch squirmed free from Newel and raced after\n\nSeth, staying low and gaining quickly. Over his shoulder,\n\nSeth glimpsed the demon drawing near, rapidly closing the space between them despite moving with such a choppy gait. The shed was still several steps away.\n\nJumping into the demon's path, Doren raised his damaged racket. A multitude of tongues snaked around the satyr and slung him aside. His efforts barely slowed Olloch, but bought Seth just enough time to lunge into the shed and slam the door. The demon crunched against the door an instant later. Some of the whitewashed planks split, but they held. The demon crashed against the shed again, rattling the small structure.203 Hang on, Seth, Doren yelled. Help is coming.Seth searched for a weapon. The best he could find was a hoe. The door shattered open and Olloch entered, snarling, wet tongues thrashing. Behind the slavering demon, Seth saw Hugo bounding across the tennis court.\n\nGrasping tongues stretched toward Seth, and he swung the hoe viciously. A tongue adroitly coiled around the hoe, ripping it from Seth's grasp. And then Hugo arrived.\n\nThe golem grasped the demon from behind with one hand and hurled it away from the shed. Olloch landed, rolled, and came charging back toward Seth, who now stood in the empty doorway alongside Hugo. The golem stepped forward, blocking access to Seth.\n\nDripping tongues whipped toward Hugo. The golem grabbed several tongues, yanked the demon into the air, and began spinning Olloch above his head. The tongues elongated as the golem whirled the glutton faster and faster, finally releasing him, sending Olloch sailing away over the treetops.\n\nDoren whistled, clearly impressed.\n\nHe'll be back straightaway, Newel said. He had grass stains on his chest and arms.\n\nYou should hurry to the yard, Doren agreed.\n\nWe better get some free batteries out of this, Newel said, brushing himself off.\n\nAnd a new racket, Doren added.\n\nWe'll talk about it, Seth said, clutching his emergency kit with the gold inside. Hugo unceremoniously lifted Seth and started running, leaving him no opportunity to say or204 hear another word. Seth could not believe how fast thegolem raced through the trees, massive strides eating up ground. Ignoring trails, Hugo bulldozed his own path through undergrowth and tangled limbs.\n\nBefore long, they were back in the yard. Grandma stood there, fists on her hips, along with Coulter, Vanessa, and\n\nKendra. Hugo gently set Seth on his feet in front of\n\nGrandma.\n\nAre you all right? Grandma asked, grabbing his shoulders and checking him for injuries.\n\nThanks to Hugo.\n\nYou're lucky Hugo was in the yard, Grandma said. We heard something roaring in the woods and found you missing.\n\nWhat were you doing in the woods?\n\nI was playing tennis with the satyrs, Seth said. Olloch found me.\n\nOlloch! she cried. The others looked shocked as well.\n\nHow could he have gotten onto the preserve? Coulter asked.\n\nAre you sure it was Olloch? Grandma asked.\n\nI recognized him, Seth said. He's a lot bigger. He has a bunch of tongues. He went right for me, didn't hardly care about the satyrs.\n\nThey heard something rustling in the woods and turned to face whatever was approaching. Olloch scrambled up to the edge of the yard before stopping. The demon reared up, tongues waving like meaty banners, and let out a mournful bellow. He lunged forward but could not step onto the grass.\n\nHe can't enter the yard, Vanessa said.205 Not yet, Grandma agreed.Then how did he get onto the preserve? Coulter repeated.\n\nI don't know, but we better get to the bottom of it quickly, Grandma said.\n\nCan Hugo kill it? Kendra asked.\n\nNot likely, Grandma said. In fact, I expect even at this size, if Olloch put his mind to it, he could devour Hugo piece by piece.\n\nOlloch was shaking his head, wagging his tongues, and pawing the ground, obviously furious at having his prey so near yet utterly unreachable. Now, there's an unusual sight, Coulter murmured.\n\nIncredible, Vanessa said.\n\nWhat do we do? Seth asked.\n\nFor starters, Grandma said crossly, you are officially grounded.206Betrayal\n\nChapter Ten\n\nKendra sat on the love seat beside Seth, resting her elbow on the arm of the couch and her chin on her hand. Ever since Hugo had rescued Seth earlier in the day, an uncomfortable new tension had filled the house. Grandpa had been poring over books and making phone calls.\n\nVanessa and Coulter came and went several times, often accompanied by Hugo. There were many hushed conversations behind closed doors. Now it was getting late, but\n\nGrandma had informed everyone they had to meet about something that could not wait until morning. Which could not be a good sign.\n\nKendra's chief consolation was that she was not Seth.\n\nWandering off into the woods without permission had almost gotten him killed. The thought of what had almost207 happened had terrified everyone, and he was getting an earfulas a result. Undoubtedly he would hear plenty more about it in the impending meeting.\n\nSeated in a chair beside Seth, Tanu was showing him potions, explaining what they did and how he marked the bottles to distinguish them from each other. Only Tanu, who had returned not long ago from an all-day excursion, had refrained from reprimanding Seth. Instead, the Samoan seemed intent on distracting him from his misery."
