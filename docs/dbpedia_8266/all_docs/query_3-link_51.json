The PINs for all accounts created prior to 2023 were reset to 'changeme' as part of our catalog migration. Please be aware that all log-in information is case sensitive. Cards begin with BLOG, not blog. After you log in for the first time, you can go to your account to update your PIN (1-8 characters), create your own EZ Username and EZ Password to use instead of your library card and library pin, and/or link your library account to your Google account (if you have one)."
