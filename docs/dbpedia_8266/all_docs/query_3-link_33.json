        "text": "Five Stars out of Five\n\nYears ago, after I finished the Harry Potter series, I started looking for a book (or book series) that was similar yet different. Much to my dismay, too many of the books I found were merely Potter carbon copies. However, that changed when I read the blurb on the back of a book entitled Fablehaven that said it would be enjoyed by Harry Potter fans. I was skeptical, so I paged through the first three chapters (yes, while in the bookstore) and was convinced that I had to read the whole book. So I bought it and, as it turns out, Fablehaven has become one of my favorite fantasy series.\n\nThere are five novels that make up the Fablehaven series, which was penned by Brandon Mull (I am excluding the Dragonwatch novels as, while they feature some of the same characters, it is a completely separate series): Fablehaven, Rise of the Evening Star, Curse of the Shadow Plague, Secrets of the Dragon Sanctuary, and Keys to the Demon Prison. Each book serves as its own unique story (i.e. a micro-plot) while also acting as an entry into the series at large (i.e. the macro-plot). And “large” does not begin to describe the immensity of this series’ story world.\n\nPlot-wise, the Fablehaven series focuses on two young teen protagonists, Kendra and Seth Sorenson, who are eventually immersed in a world beyond their wildest imaginations. The overall premise is that all manner of creatures, beings, and even monsters from myths and legends roam the earth, but in order to protect them from humans, as well as keep the human world safe from any potential unsavory influences, these creatures dwell in magical preserves or sanctuaries across the globe. Kendra and Seth’s grandparents serve as caretakers of one such preserve called Fablehaven, which is home to all sorts of fantastical creatures, from fairies to dryads, trolls to centaurs. However, not everyone within the magical community agrees with the idea of keeping such beings contained; hence, the aim of the series’ villains is to create a world where even demons can walk free. Until now, all of the world’s demons have been imprisoned in a dungeon-like realm called Zzyxx, but things are about to change that might unleash a devilish horde upon humankind. And it’s up to Kendra, Seth, their grandparents, and a cast of colorful characters to stop it.\n\nThe world of Fablehaven and its level of detail are staggering. It functions very much like a sandbox environment where readers get to explore every nook and cranny right along with the main characters. Each book assumes an adventure/quest angle though the novels tackle this story type in different ways – sometimes characters are searching for a magical artifact while other times they’re racing against time to prevent a threat that will breach the human world. The pacing is generally brisk and the narrative is nicely balanced with quiet moments of character development/reflection and chapters of adventurous action mixed with appropriate amounts of humor. While this series is aimed at middle grade readers, adults can enjoy it, too, for its clever world-building, fun characters, and occasional philosophical insights regarding the nature of morality as well as good and evil. In terms of the latter, the series makes it clear that while there are moral absolutes, sometimes the choices people make are not always black and white, which is refreshing to see in stories aimed for younger readers where, all too often, characters get rubber stamped.\n\nConcerning the series entries themselves, Fablehaven serves as a solid opener, introducing readers to the titular magical preserve. Initially, Kendra and Seth must spend the summer with their enigmatic grandfather, which doesn’t sound all that exciting – until Seth and Kendra follow some rather unusual advice and an entire fantastical realm is revealed right before their eyes. The build up here is slow but necessary. There is much to learn about the magical preserve of Fablehaven, and I felt like I was exploring it piece by piece alongside Seth and Kendra. Naturally, living on a magical preserve isn’t all fun and games, and Seth’s seemingly insignificant meddling ignites a chain of events that threatens to unleash a demonic evil that may destroy Fablehaven itself. As a whole, this first novel is a good self-contained story that can both stand on its own as well as set the stage for the series’ macro-plot\n\nThe follow-up novel, Rise of the Evening Star, crafts another self-contained tale, this time focusing on a missing magical talisman that the Sorensons believe is located somewhere in the far reaches of Fablehaven’s property. However, a potential foe is approaching, so they take great care in who they choose to trust. Once more, Seth finds himself as the unwanted instigator of magical retribution of the demonic persuasion, though this only accounts for the novel’s second act conflict. It then changes focus to who may or may not be trustworthy in terms of the artifact recovery team Grandpa has put together. As a whole, Rise of the Evening Star is a solid follow up that doesn’t try to rehash the first book as it creates its own story, this time with more of a quest/adventure element as well as subtle hints at what the series’ villains have in mind.\n\nThe third novel, Curse of the Shadow Plague, takes the action away from Fablehaven for a time and splits up Kendra and Seth. Kendra is asked to join a team of diversely talented magical adventurers to a preserve located in the desert Southwest while Seth is forced to remain at Fablehaven. However, Seth soon puts his daring, snooping ways to good use when he uncovers a sinister plague unfolding in the preserve. When things come to a head, Seth and Kendra find themselves on the front lines of a battle between good and evil, light and darkness. While for me the early chapters of this novel are a bit slow, the action picks up once Kendra reunites with Seth at Fablehaven to stop the plague. In the end, this is by no means a slump of a read and is filled with some surprisingly emotional moments.\n\nSecrets of the Dragon Sanctuary serves as the penultimate entry that, for the most part, steps away from Fablehaven and introduces readers to Wyrmroost, a dragon sanctuary that’s essentially a giant death trap. This novel also retains a quest narrative that, at times, much like the early portions of Curse of the Shadow Plague, can feel a bit slow and repetitive. But moments of fun character interactions, character team ups, and a surprising reveal that’s been three novels in the making is totally worth it. And it’s also worth noting that the cliffhanger ending makes for a good transition into the final novel.\n\nLastly, Keys to the Demon Prison closes out the series, hitting the ground running with an action-packed opening and the story rarely lets up from there. If I had any complaints with this final entry, it would be that at times it feels like it’s a little too full, trying to cram in as many parting details as possible. For instance, one such element that is introduced here, a group of people called the Eternals, feels a bit like a missed opportunity as this marks the first and only time we learn about these individuals in the entire series. But, to its credit, the novel wisely raises the stakes and, for that, I give it a passing grade, too, as it serves up a very satisfying ending.\n\nOverall, the Fablehaven series is worth diving into if you’re looking for a myth-and-legend-focused fantasy series with fun, creative world-building and relatable, entertaining lead characters. While I will confess that some of the middle novels do seem to possess some repetitive plot features, they fit in with the series’ macro-plot, so I can’t fault it too much for that as everything all falls into place by the end. Overall, I love the Fablehaven books and it’s a sheer delight to dive into them again and again. So if you’re hunting for an addictive fantasy series that appeals to all ages, then Fablehaven is one series certainly worth checking out.\n\nContent:\n\nLanguage – None, other than some sporadic name-calling.\n\nViolence – Most of the violence involves magic or magical tools as opposed to weapons (aside from swords or knives). Characters find themselves in numerous perilous situations and, in some cases, characters, including beloved characters, are killed in non-graphic ways. Demons also become a central threat and it’s clear they plan to inflict destruction upon the human world. One character tries to befriend a dying demon in an attempt to do the right thing, though this turns out to be a mistake. Other fantasy creatures, such as darkness-infected beings, witches, zombies, and dragons, also pose as threats at times. One character who is eventually unmasked as the chief villain has questionable aims that often put the lead characters and their friends and loved ones in harm’s way. It’s also worth noting that Seth has a penchant for being recklessly immature at times, though sometimes his actions come out of a spirit of taking extreme/risky measures in extreme, desperate, or dangerous situations. In short, while there is plenty of magical action and some fight scenes, nothing ever turns gory or graphic.\n\nSexual Content – None. In one novel, a magical creature comes to Kendra’s school disguised as an attractive male student who female students fawn over. We learn he kissed a girl (off-page) who later tells Kendra she was repulsed by his bad breath, so nothing further occurs. Elsewhere, an adult character starts to talk about puberty to Kendra and Seth but his speech is abbreviated, so nothing on the subject is really discussed or mentioned at any length. Lastly, a magical device enables users to travel back in time but they can’t bring anything from the present with them, including clothing. However, no scenes of nudity are ever described save for a mention of characters trying to hide/cover themselves (but as to what they’re hiding/covering is never explicitly described)."
