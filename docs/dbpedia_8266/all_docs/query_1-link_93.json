        "text": "In a year again unlike any other that I have taught, I was curious to see how reading would continue to be impacted by COVID and all of the other world issues. And impacted it was; from kids who had not read a single book the previous year to kids who had fallen out of love with reading. From kids who continued to see no purpose of reading beyond pleasing the adults to kids who had no idea who they were as readers or what they wanted. We dove in, book-talked, book-shopped, and discussed throughout the year who we were as readers and what we needed to sustain ourselves.\n\nThe most read books in our classroom space were:\n\nHuda F are You by Huda Fahmy\n\nDiary of a Wimpy Kid series by Jeff Kinney\n\nShatter Me by Tahereh Mafi\n\nLong Way Down by Jason Reynolds\n\nFree Lunch by Rex Ogle\n\nHeartstopper series by Alice Oseman\n\nThere were a lot of repeat favorites this year but also a huge shift in finding texts on TiK Tok, you will see this in some of the more mature titles on this list which are books I do not have in our collection but that still passed from hand to hand rapidly. Kids can read whatever they choose here and I also read and enjoyed many of them myself. Some of the books are therefore fine for all 7th graders, some are more mature, I am including them all so that you can make your own decision. All home adults are informed of the range of books that are present in our classroom library so that students can choose something that speaks to them. Not all of these books are in my library but are books that the students have found and read independently.\n\nThere are also a lot of books on this list that are being challenged in other states for a variety of reasons. I think once again the fact that they are being read, passed on, and recommended by kids speaks volumes of the power of these books.\n\nOther things I noticed were:\n\nThe most requested authors are Jason Reynolds, Alice Oseman, Angie Thomas, Tahereh Mafi, and Jeff Kinney.\n\nMystery, crime, and romance were the most sought after types of books, as well as any shorter books.\n\nFree verse books and graphic novels were still the most popular formats of books.\n\nSocial justice books continue to carry a deep impact and are passed from hand to hand but many kids also wanted fun or really fast-paced books this year that didn’t take on heavy topics because they felt the world was heavy enough as it is.\n\nKids reading interests range widely, some students gravitated toward more traditional literature this year while others solely devoured lighthearted middle grade – this shows the incredible need for a broad and inclusive selection for all of our students.\n\nTo see the list from 2016 go here\n\nTo see the list from 2017 go here\n\nTo see the list from 2018, go here\n\nTo see the list from 2019, go here\n\nTo see the list from 2020, go here\n\nTo see the list from 2021, go here\n\nWithout further ado, here they are as reported by my seventh graders this year.\n\nHeart Stopper Series by Alice Oseman\n\nCharlie and Nick are at the same school, but they’ve never met … until one day when they’re made to sit together. They quickly become friends, and soon Charlie is falling hard for Nick, even though he doesn’t think he has a chance.\n\nBut love works in surprising ways, and Nick is more interested in Charlie than either of them realised.\n\nThis was the most recommended book this year!\n\nHey, Kiddo by Jarrett J. Krosoczka\n\nPart of our overcoming obstacles book club.\n\nIn kindergarten, Jarrett Krosoczka’s teacher asks him to draw his family, with a mommy and a daddy. But Jarrett’s family is much more complicated than that. His mom is an addict, in and out of rehab, and in and out of Jarrett’s life. His father is a mystery — Jarrett doesn’t know where to find him, or even what his name is. Jarrett lives with his grandparents — two very loud, very loving, very opinionated people who had thought they were through with raising children until Jarrett came along.Jarrett goes through his childhood trying to make his non-normal life as normal as possible, finding a way to express himself through drawing even as so little is being said to him about what’s going on. Only as a teenager can Jarrett begin to piece together the truth of his family, reckoning with his mother and tracking down his father.\n\nHuda F Are You by Huda Fahmy\n\nHuda and her family just moved to Dearborn, Michigan, a small town with a big Muslim population. In her old town, Huda knew exactly who she was: She was the hijabi girl. But in Dearborn, everyone is the hijabi girl.\n\nHuda is lost in a sea of hijabis, and she can’t rely on her hijab to define her anymore. She has to define herself. So she tries on a bunch of cliques, but she isn’t a hijabi fashionista or a hijabi athlete or a hijabi gamer. She’s not the one who knows everything about her religion or the one all the guys like. She’s miscellaneous, which makes her feel like no one at all. Until she realizes that it’ll take finding out who she isn’t to figure out who she is.\n\nFree Lunch by Rex Ogle\n\nInstead of giving him lunch money, Rex’s mom has signed him up for free meals. As a poor kid in a wealthy school district, better-off kids crowd impatiently behind him as he tries to explain to the cashier that he’s on the free meal program. The lunch lady is hard of hearing, so Rex has to shout.\n\nFree Lunch is the story of Rex’s efforts to navigate his first semester of sixth grade―who to sit with, not being able to join the football team, Halloween in a handmade costume, classmates and a teacher who take one look at him and decide he’s trouble―all while wearing secondhand clothes and being hungry. His mom and her boyfriend are out of work, and life at home is punctuated by outbursts of violence. Halfway through the semester, his family is evicted and ends up in government-subsidized housing in view of the school. Rex lingers at the end of last period every day until the buses have left, so no one will see where he lives.\n\nDear Martin by Nic Stone\n\nPart of our overcoming obstacles book club.\n\nJustyce McAllister is a good kid, an honor student, and always there to help a friend—but none of that matters to the police officer who just put him in handcuffs. Despite leaving his rough neighborhood behind, he can’t escape the scorn of his former peers or the ridicule of his new classmates.\n\nJustyce looks to the teachings of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. for answers. But do they hold up anymore? He starts a journal to Dr. King to find out.\n\nThen comes the day Justyce goes driving with his best friend, Manny, windows rolled down, music turned up—way up, sparking the fury of a white off-duty cop beside them. Words fly. Shots are fired. Justyce and Manny are caught in the crosshairs. In the media fallout, it’s Justyce who is under attack.\n\nDiary of Anne Frank adapted by Ari Folman and illustrated by David Polonsky\n\nA timeless story rediscovered by each new generation, The Diary of a Young Girl stands without peer. For both young readers and adults it continues to capture the remarkable spirit of Anne Frank, who for a time survived the worst horror the modern world has seen—and who remained triumphantly and heartbreakingly human throughout her ordeal.\n\nThe Little Book of Black Holes by Steven S. Gubser & Frank Pretorius\n\nBlack holes, predicted by Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity more than a century ago, have long intrigued scientists and the public with their bizarre and fantastical properties. Although Einstein understood that black holes were mathematical solutions to his equations, he never accepted their physical reality―a viewpoint many shared. This all changed in the 1960s and 1970s, when a deeper conceptual understanding of black holes developed just as new observations revealed the existence of quasars and X-ray binary star systems, whose mysterious properties could be explained by the presence of black holes. Black holes have since been the subject of intense research―and the physics governing how they behave and affect their surroundings is stranger and more mind-bending than any fiction.\n\nAfter introducing the basics of the special and general theories of relativity, this book describes black holes both as astrophysical objects and theoretical “laboratories” in which physicists can test their understanding of gravitational, quantum, and thermal physics. From Schwarzschild black holes to rotating and colliding black holes, and from gravitational radiation to Hawking radiation and information loss, Steven Gubser and Frans Pretorius use creative thought experiments and analogies to explain their subject accessibly. They also describe the decades-long quest to observe the universe in gravitational waves, which recently resulted in the LIGO observatories’ detection of the distinctive gravitational wave “chirp” of two colliding black holes―the first direct observation of black holes’ existence.\n\nThe Little Book of Black Holes takes readers deep into the mysterious heart of the subject, offering rare clarity of insight into the physics that makes black holes simple yet destructive manifestations of geometric destiny.\n\nForget Me Not by Ellie Terry\n\nPart of our overcoming obstacles book club.\n\nAstronomy-loving Calliope June has Tourette syndrome, so she sometimes makes faces or noises that she doesn’t mean to make. When she and her mother move yet again, she tries to hide her TS. But it isn’t long before the kids at her new school realize she’s different. Only Calliope’s neighbor, who is also the popular student body president, sees her as she truly is―an interesting person and a good friend. But is he brave enough to take their friendship public?\n\nAs Calliope navigates school, she must also face her mother’s new relationship and the fact that they might be moving―again―just as she starts to make friends and finally accept her differences.\n\nCity of Ember by Jeanne DuPrau\n\nPart of our dystopian book club:\n\nThe city of Ember was built as a last refuge for the human race. Two hundred years later, the great lamps that light the city are beginning to dim. When Lina finds part of an ancient message, she’s sure it holds a secret that will save the city.

Will she be able to hold on to her job, help the immigrants and guests, escape Mr. Yao, and go for her dreams?\n\nWhat About Will by Ellen Hopkins\n\nTwelve-year-old Trace Reynolds has always looked up to his brother, mostly because Will, who’s five years older, has never looked down on him. It was Will who taught Trace to ride a bike, would watch sports on TV with him, and cheer him on at Little League. But when Will was knocked out cold during a football game, resulting in a brain injury–everything changed. Now, seventeen months later, their family is still living under the weight of “the incident,” that left Will with a facial tic, depression, and an anger he cannot always control, culminating in their parents’ divorce. Afraid of further fracturing his family, Trace begins to cover for Will who, struggling with addiction to pain medication, becomes someone Trace doesn’t recognize. But when the brother he loves so much becomes more and more withdrawn, and escalates to stealing money and ditching school, Trace realizes some secrets cannot be kept if we ever hope to heal.\n\nOne of Us is Lying by Karen McManus\n\nPay close attention and you might solve this.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, five students at Bayview High walk into detention.\n\nBronwyn, the brain, is Yale-bound and never breaks a rule.\n\nAddy, the beauty, is the picture-perfect homecoming princess.\n\nNate, the criminal, is already on probation for dealing.\n\nCooper, the athlete, is the all-star baseball pitcher.\n\nAnd Simon, the outcast, is the creator of Bayview High’s notorious gossip app.\n\nOnly, Simon never makes it out of that classroom.

And when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life seems too good to be true.\n\nRyle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head.

Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place.\n\nAs questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan—her first love and a link to the past she left behind.

Perhaps like me, you also have younger teens who are requesting these books, so I thought pulling a list together might be helpful. I have purposefully left graphic novels off of here because they deserve their own list, frankly. So here are some of the many incredible books that my 7th graders keep passing around for reading and also that were recommended by people online. You will notice that a few are a little bit longer, I ran this list by my students, of course, and they insisted that some of these books deserved to be on it despite their length because they didn’t “feel or read long.”\n\nEscape from Chernobyl from Andy Merino.\n\nPage count: 176\n\nDescription:\n\n26 April 1986\n\n01:18\n\nAlina & Lev are two siblings living in Pripyat, one of the Soviet Union’s proud nuclear cities.
