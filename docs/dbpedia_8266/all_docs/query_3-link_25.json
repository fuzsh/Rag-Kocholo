        "text": "No, Kendra said. Seth shook his head.89And he did nothing to cajole that information out ofyou? Grandpa pursued.\n\nNo, Seth said. Kendra agreed.\n\nGrandpa leaned back. That, at least, is a relief.\n\nBut we must continue with our plan, Grandma said.\n\nGrandpa waved his hand. Of course. We'll proceed as if the secret is out.\n\nYou think they know? Kendra asked.\n\nGrandpa frowned. The Society of the Evening Star should not even be aware that this preserve exists. Enormous efforts have been taken to maintain our anonymity. Yet we know the Society colluded with Muriel and nearly managed to overthrow Fablehaven last summer. And so we must assume that they are aware Fablehaven is a secret preserve, and realize what it contains.\n\nWhat? Seth asked. What is the artifact?\n\nBy itself, an ancient talisman of tremendous power,\n\nGrandpa said. In connection with the other four, the key to\n\n-- Advertisement --\n\nZzyzx, the great prison where literally thousands of the most powerful demons from every age of this world are incarcerated.\n\nNone remain who know its location, Grandma whispered.\n\nExcept, perhaps, the Society, Grandpa murmured, scowling at the floor. If the five talismans were ever brought together and used to open Zzyzx, the results would be...\n\ncatastrophic. Apocalyptic. The end of the world.\n\nEndless night, Grandma echoed. Across all the earth.\n\nThe mighty fiends inside of Zzyzx would make Bahumat look90 like an infant. A lapdog. In their absence, we long ago lostthe ability to contend with beings of their power. Even the fairy army you summoned would quail before them. Our only hope is to keep them imprisoned.\n\nThe room was silent. Kendra could hear the grandfather clock ticking. So how do we stop them? Seth finally said.\n\nThat is the right question, Grandpa said, jabbing a finger at Seth for emphasis. I put that same query to the unofficial leader of the Conservators' Alliance.\n\nWhat's that? Seth asked.\n\nThe caretakers of all the preserves around the world, along with their allies, belong to the Conservators'\n\nAlliance, Grandma explained.\n\nEach caretaker has an equal say, with none officially presiding, Grandpa said. But for centuries we have benefited from the advice and aid of our greatest ally-the\n\nSphinx.\n\nLike in Egypt? Kendra asked.\n\nWhether he is actually a sphinx, we do not know,\n\nGrandpa said. Surely he is more than mortal. His service dates back to the twelfth century. I have spoken with him face-to-face only twice, and on both occasions he was in the likeness of a man. But many of the most powerful creatures, like dragons, can assume human form when it suits them.\n\nYou asked the Sphinx what to do? Seth asked.\n\nI did, Grandpa said. Face-to-face, as a matter of fact.\n\nHe suggested we move the artifact. You see, at roughly three hundred years old, Fablehaven is among the youngest preserves.\n\nOf the secret preserves, it is by far the newest. One91 of the secret preserves was compromised not long beforeFablehaven was founded. The vault housing the artifact was transported here, and Fablehaven was kept a secret thereafter.\n\nSo the idea is not without precedent.\n\nHave you moved it yet? Kendra asked.\n\nGrandpa scratched his chin. We have to find it first.\n\nYou don't know where it is? Seth blurted.\n\nTo my knowledge, Grandpa said, none of the caretakers of the secret sanctuaries know where the artifacts on their preserves are hidden. The vaults that hold them were concealed so as to never be found.\n\nAnd they are protected by lethal traps, Grandma added.\n\nChapter Five\n\nWhich is the true explanation for our visitors,\n\nGrandpa said softly.\n\nThey're here to find the artifact! Kendra said.\n\nGrandpa nodded. I do not envy their task.\n\nHave they found anything yet? Seth asked.\n\nVanessa has had some luck poring through the journals of former caretakers, Grandpa said. Patton Burgess, Lena's husband, was fascinated by the secret artifacts. In a coded reference in one of his journals, he made mention of an inverted tower on the property where he believed\n\nFablehaven's artifact resides. His notes were inconclusive, but they gave us some idea of where to concentrate our search. We may find the artifact tomorrow. Or it might take many lifetimes.\n\nNo wonder Vanessa has such an awesome car, Seth said. She's a treasure hunter.92 They all have different specialties, Grandpa said.Tanu is a potion master. Coulter collects magical relics.\n\nVanessa focuses on capturing mystical animals. Their various occupations have taken them to some of the most dangerous corners of the world, and qualify them for this perilous assignment.\n\nAs caretakers, we hold as an heirloom the key that will allow us to access the vault, Grandma said. We keep it safely hidden. Once we discover the location of the vault, the key will allow us the chance to get inside and retrieve the artifact.\n\nEven with the key, avoiding the many traps guarding the artifact promises to be no small task, Grandpa said.\n\nTanu, Coulter, and Vanessa will need to be in top form.\n\nDid they know about Fablehaven beforehand? Kendra asked.\n\nNone of them, Grandpa said. I counseled long with the Sphinx and others to select them. Coulter is an old friend. I know him the best. Tanu has an impeccable reputation.\n\nAs does Vanessa. The Sphinx and several other caretakers vouched for both of them.\n\nDespite their careful selection, Grandma said, there is a chance, however small, that the Society could have gotten to one of them. Or that one of them has been an agent for the Society all along. The Society of the Evening Star has an uncanny ability for infiltration. An endorsement from the Sphinx virtually clears them of suspicion, but the\n\nSphinx himself cautioned that we should remain mindful of the possibility.92 93 Which is part of the reason we selected three instead ofone, Grandpa said, along with the desire for extra help.\n\nEven with three seasoned experts, finding the artifact is an overwhelming assignment.\n\nTogether they serve the added benefit of providing extra security around here, Grandma said, which is obviously a comfort, considering the recent unrest.\n\nThere have been reports of unparalleled activity by the\n\nSociety, Grandpa said. Since last summer, two more preserves have fallen, one of them a secret preserve like\n\nFablehaven.\n\nSo they got one of the artifacts? Kendra asked, gripping the arms of her chair.\n\nWe don't know, Grandpa said. We hope not. You remember Maddox, the fairy broker? He went into the preserve after it fell to perform reconnaissance. We have not heard back.\n\nHow long ago? Seth asked.\n\nMore than three months, Grandma said.\n\nThe secret preserve was in Brazil, Grandpa said. They thwarted an infiltration there two years ago. Then this past\n\nFebruary... we don't know what happened.\n\nWhat artifact was hidden there? Seth asked, wide-eyed.\n\nImpossible to say, Grandpa said. We have a rough idea of what the artifacts are, but no clue which is hidden where.\n\nWhat are they? Kendra asked.\n\nGrandpa looked at Grandma, who shrugged. One94 grants power over space, another over time. A third grantsunlimited sight. A fourth can heal any ailment. And one bestows immortality.\n\nThe details have been deliberately shrouded in mystery,\n\nGrandma said.\n\nThe magic they wield is greater than any we know,\n\nGrandpa said. For example, there are ways to get from one place to another besides walking, but the artifact that grants power over space does so in ways superior to any known spell or relic or creature.\n\nAnd somehow, used together, they can open the demon prison? Kendra clarified.\n\nExactly, Grandpa confirmed. Which is why they must remain apart and out of the hands of our enemies at all costs.\n\nOne concern is that if the Society could get their hands on one, they could use it to help retrieve the others.\n\nBut they may already have one, Seth said.\n\nWe can only hope that the fallen preserve in Brazil was as inhospitable for them as it apparently was for Maddox,\n\nGrandma said. Others have been sent since Maddox vanished.\n\nNone have returned. Naturally we must take precautions as if the worst has happened.\n\nSo where do Seth and I come into all of this? Kendra asked.\n\nGrandpa took a sip from a tall glass of orange juice. He furrowed his brow. We're not entirely sure. We know the\n\nSociety has taken a serious interest in you two. We worry that they may know something more than we do about the change the fairies wrought in Kendra, something that makes95 them believe she could be of use to them. They infiltratedyour school and tried to win your trust. They used Seth to free a captive demon. Almost certainly they meant to abduct you. Their ultimate goal is hard to divine.\n\nThe Sphinx himself wants to meet Kendra, Grandma said.\n\nHe's here? Seth exclaimed.\n\nNearby, Grandpa said. He never stays in one place long. Most recently he was doing damage control in Brazil.\n\nBut he has become concerned that Fablehaven may be the next target. There have been numerous rumors of Society activity in the area, even beyond what happened with the two of you. I got in touch with him last night. He wants to meet Kendra and see if he can discern why the Society has become so interested in her.\n\nI want to meet him too, Seth said.\n\nWe plan to bring you as well, Grandpa said, to see if something can be done about that bite.\n\nI'm sick of waiting; what's the story? Seth sounded exasperated.\n\nOlloch the Glutton is a demon enchanted by a peculiar spell, Grandpa explained. He remains in a petrified state, inert, until somebody feeds him. He bites the hand that feeds him and, after that, gradually awakens, driven by an insatiable hunger. He eats, and as he eats, he grows. As his size increases, so does his power, and he does not stop eating until he consumes the person who initially awakened him.\n\nHe's going to eat me? Seth cried.\n\nHe's going to try, Grandpa said.96 Can he get into Fablehaven?I don't think so, Grandpa said. But the day will soon come when he will prowl our borders, searching for an opportunity to strike, gaining more power every day as he continues to gorge himself. He will be inexorably drawn to you. The only places to hide are those he cannot access.\n\nThere has to be something we can do! Seth said.\n\nThat is why I want to bring you to the Sphinx,\n\nGrandpa said. His wisdom has proven equal to situations more challenging than this. Don't worry, we won't let\n\nOlloch devour you.\n\nSeth put his face in his hands. Why does everything I\n\ndo go wrong? He looked up. I thought I was being helpful.\n\nThis was not your fault, Grandma said. You were being very brave, and trying to do the right thing. Sadly,\n\nErrol was taking advantage of you.\n\nDo you know anything about Errol? Kendra asked.\n\nNothing, Grandpa said.\n\nHow did he find out about the fairies?\n\nGrandpa sighed. We have a theory. Last week, we found an imp, one of the big kind, passing information to a caped figure through the border fence. We could not catch the person he was informing-the stranger made a hasty retreat.\n\nBut we managed to apprehend the imp.\n\nThe rogue would have gotten away if not for your grandpa, Grandma said.\n\nChoosing between me and Tanu, the imp tried to get past me, Grandpa said. I tackled him, but he was amazingly strong. He hurled me into a gully. I felt my arm snap97 beneath me, and fractured my tibia. But I managed to slowthe brute long enough for Tanu to use a concoction that paralyzed him.\n\nWhere is he now? Seth asked.\n\nIn the dungeon, Grandpa said.\n\nThe basement, Grandma clarified.\n\nSo that's what's down there! Seth cried.\n\nAmong other things, Grandpa said. Unaccompanied, the dungeon is absolutely off-limits to you two.\n\nBig surprise, Seth mumbled.\n\nAnyhow, Grandpa said, the point is, we believe that the imp, and perhaps others, must have leaked the experience\n\nKendra had with the fairies to the Society. Imps are crafty spies.\n\nAre we going to have to hide here for the rest of our lives? Kendra asked.\n\nGrandpa slapped his hand down on the arm of the wheelchair. Who said anything about hiding? We'll be taking action. Finding and moving the artifact. Investigating why the Society is interested in you. Consulting with the\n\nSphinx.\n\nAnd offering you two world-class training from some of the most skilled adventurers anywhere, Grandma said. You need to learn about the world you are being drawn into, and you could find no better teachers than Tanu, Vanessa, and\n\nCoulter.\n\nThey're going to teach us? Seth asked, eyes shining.\n\nThey will be your mentors, Grandpa said. At this point, sitting still would be a mistake. You two will have98 opportunities to accompany them on some of their outingsas they search for the artifact.\n\nNot when they do anything truly dangerous, Grandma amended.\n\nNo, Grandpa said. But you'll get to see a new side of\n\nFablehaven. And learn a trick or two that may help you in the future. Ignorance is no longer a protection for either of you.\n\nCoulter may be tough to work with, particularly for\n\nKendra, Grandma said with a trace of bitterness. He has a prehistoric outlook on certain issues, and a difficult personality.\n\nBut he also has a lot to offer. If all else fails, Vanessa has agreed to take up the slack.\n\nThey do not know the extent of what we have told you, Grandpa said. They think we informed you that they are hunting for a hidden relic, and they understand that you are to accompany them when prudence will allow it. They have no idea that we revealed the true nature of the artifact or the fact that Fablehaven is a secret preserve. You must keep those details to yourselves. I don't want anyone learning how much you know.\n\nNo problem, Seth said.\n\nWhat do they think we believe the artifact is? Kendra said.\n\nA magical relic that will help us in our fight against the\n\nSociety, Grandma said. An unknown talisman rumored to be hidden on the property. We told them we would keep it vague, and that they should do the same.99 If we find it, Seth said, why don't we use it againstErrol and his friends?"
