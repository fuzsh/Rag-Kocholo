<B>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</B> (PS2, GC, XBX, PC)<BR><BR><I>Publisher:</I> Ubi Soft<BR><I>Developer</I>: Ubi Soft Montreal<BR><I>Released:</I> November 2003<BR><BR>Let me first start this review by saying that as a longtime PC gaming veteran, I have played both the original <I>Prince of Persia</I> and its sequel, <I>Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame</I>. That said, you need absolutely no experience with this decade-old game franchise to enjoy <I>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</I>. Both heavily hyped and a North American sales flop, PoP: SoT is arguably a strong candidate for action/platforming Game of the Year. The game is both stunningly beautiful and plays like a dream. The only things going against it are a sketchy camera (characteristic of this genre of game) and that it's a bit short. I played the PC version of this game using a PS2 Dualshock2 controller and a PSX->USB controller adapter. I wouldn't recommend playing it on a PC with mouse/keyboard, but since it's also available for all 3 consoles, if you don't have a gamepad for your PC you can enjoy it on the console of your choice.<BR><BR><B><I>Graphics:</B></I><BR><BR>The game's bread-and-butter is the distinctive, beautiful soft-focus panoramas which the Prince explores. Texture detail isn't spectacular, which you would expect of a console port, but character and model detail is excellent. The Prince and Farah have a number of facial expressions, and the Prince himself is nicely modeled, with moving hair and clothes. The environments, however, are nothing short of stunning, with the crumbling palace the Prince explores drawing comparisons to the sleeper PS2 launch title Ico. The game is simply breathtaking to see in motion, as the soft-focus and light-bloom lighting effects (borrowed from Ubi Soft title Splinter Cell) give the game a dreamlike quality. All the panoramas have what seems to be a virtually infinite draw distance, and on the PC and Xbox the game runs with little to no slowdown. The GC version has some framerate issues, and the PS2 version has a more inconsistent framereate still. <BR><BR>Nevertheless, this is one game you will want to show your friends, as it is liable to make jaws drop when they watch you play it. The camera can be a pain in the ass during the fight sequences, as it likes to get stuck on walls or shoot the action through a column, but during the exploration and puzzle sequences the camera generally frames the action perfectly. You can adjust the camera freely, which means that if the camera is stuck during a fight you can make it move, but you'd better be holding down the block button while you do this or an enemy is likely to knock your butt on the ground while you fiddle with the view. Note that the PC and Xbox versions have improved lighting effects and higher polygon models. The PC version also benefits from support for very high resolutions, if you have the video card to handle it. I had no problems running it at 1280x1024x32 on my Radeon 9800 Pro with virtually no choppiness or slowdown at all.<BR><BR><B><I>Sound:</B></I><BR><BR>Essentially, how good the game sounds depends on which platform you run it on. Both the PC and Xbox versions support discrete surround sound, PC through Directsound3D/EAX and Xbox through Dolby Digital 5.1. The PS2 and GC versions use Dolby Pro-Logic II, which doesn't sound as good and provides somewhat lacking surround separation. The PS2 version also suffers to some degree from audio compression and loses some dynamic range, but the GC version's audio compression is only a few degrees north of atrocious. Presumably due to the smaller GC disc capacity, all game speech is heavily compressed, and if you don't have the sound up loud enough the Prince sounds very muffled. It's a shame that the game doesn't have any subtitles, which would make the Prince a lot easier to understand on the GC. Should you happen to be playing it on a PC or Xbox, the sound is quite spectacular, with an excellent score that mixes traditional Arabic instruments with modern guitar rock, a combination that sounds odd but just plain works. The fight scenes are all driven by great background tunes, and the puzzle and exploration sequences have lots of nice ambient cues. The Prince and Farah are all competently voiced, and Prince in particular has lots to say, including to himself. The game also features a single licensed track: "Time Only Knows" by Stuart Chatwood. You can enjoy this song by watching the credits.<BR><BR><B><I>Gameplay:</B></I><BR><BR>To put it simply, there has never been a game in this genre which mixes puzzle and platform jumping elements with fighting this well. The game is just completely awesome to play, period. The Prince himself handles the way we wish all platformers would; even the almighty Mario could take some hints about how to move about from the Prince. The control layout is perfectly executed and allows the Prince to run horizontally along walls, wall-jump back and forth to climb high walls, swing from poles like an acrobat, and leap from column to column effortlessly. Though the game is relatively short (10-15 hours, depending on how good you are), you'll enjoy every second of it, as the game challenges you to navigate your way through enormous, trap-filled rooms in the palace like a giant birdcage, an enormous library, a cavern filled with falling stalactites, and a 5-story high torture chamber. There are also a number of relatively easy puzzles in the game, including one using light reflected from mirrors that is strongly reminiscent of a similar puzzle in the Zelda games.<BR><BR>Fortunately for you, the Prince is more than up to the task, and as you progress linearly through the various parts of the palace, you will encounter many monsters. For the lack of a better term, I referred to them as "sand zombies", and they are essentially palace guards turned into undead sand monsters by the Sands of Time. The Prince, however, has a scimitar. More importantly, the Price has the Dagger of Time, which he can use to rewind fatal mistakes, freeze enemies, speed up and slow down time, and see briefly into his future at save points. The dagger, well, has "balls": chambers which store the Sands of Time and power its functions. You need to refill your balls frequently, because when your balls are empty your powers are spent. Heh.<BR><BR>The Dagger is essential both when exploring the highly dangerous, lethal enviornments and fighting the sand zombies. A completely different and unique gameplay dynamic opens up in this game when you realize that by just hitting the L1 button after hurling yourself into a pit filled with spikes you can rewind your mistake and try again. For the first time in the history of platformers, you are free to make the most insane leaps and try whatever the hell comes to mind, since instead of being punished for a mistake by playing the last half-hour of a level again, you simply undo what you just did and try a different approach. This simple, yet effective gameplay mechanic is nothing short of revolutionary in the genre, because it means that what you choose to do next is limited only by your imagination. Exploration is relentlessly linear, insofar as there is generally one "right" answer to where you have to go next and what you have to do to get there, but frustration with trying to figure out what the developer wants you to do next is kept to minimum due to the "visions" of the Prince's future which appear at every save point, giving him hints as to how to navigate the next area.<BR><BR>When the Prince is fighting, the Dagger comes in useful as well. Not only can you rewind big mistakes, such as jumping off the edge of the platform you are fighting on, but you can use it strategically to undo enemy hits and change your mind about how you approach your next move. Did you charge into the midst of 4 zombie spearmean and get cut to ribbons? Back it up a bit and try a different approach. The Dagger also lets you move at super speed and cut a group of enemies in half instantly, though doing so drains the dagger entirely and leaves you vulnerable if powerful enemies spawn in their place. Since the only way to refill the Dagger during a fight is to plunge it into enemies lying on the ground and "Retrieve" the Sands of Time inside the zombie, you find yourself planning usage of the Dagger strategically at the right moments to get more Sand and ensure that you have enough balls to get you through some of the longer fights. If there is a drawback to the excellent fighting, it's that some of the fights do get rather long, and if you haven't mastered some of the most advanced moves you simply don't stand a chance. In this game, you had better learn to block, and block well, or you are a dead Prince.<BR><BR>In case you haven't discovered it already from my long description, the game is surprisingly deep in terms of both the combat and the platforming. Though you are quickly taught all the Prince's moves in the "training" level, the game just keeps coming up with creative new ways to test what the Prince can do. Even though the game can be essentially boiled down to: (1) getting through the next area and (2) fighting the monsters at the end of the next area, repeat (1) and (2) until you finish the game, it never gets boring or repetitive. The fact that the game is relatively short helps: the developers could concentrate on making 10 hours of fun gaming instead of 40 hours of boring gaming.<BR><BR><B><I>Multi-Platform Differences:</B></I><BR><BR>The PS2 version has the original <I>Prince of Persia</I> as an unlockable extra.<BR>The GC version has PoP1 and a Making-Of documentary.<BR>The Xbox version has PoP1, <I>Prince of Persia 2</I> (nice!), and the documentary.<BR>The PC version has no extras whatsoever (GRRRRRRRR....), but you can download PoP1 and PoP2 from abndonware game sites if you really want to play them, as those games are literally more than a decade old anyways.<BR><BR><B><I>Ratings:</B></I><BR>Graphics: <B>9 out of 10</B><BR>Sound: <B>9 out of 10</B><BR>Gameplay: <B>9 out of 10</B><BR>The "Fun" Factor (stolen shamelessly from GamePro): <B>10 out of 10</B><BR>Value: <B>8 out of 10</B><BR><BR><B><I>Overall Rating: 9.5</B></I><BR><BR>As always, I welcome comments and/or corrections of errors/omissions in this thread.
