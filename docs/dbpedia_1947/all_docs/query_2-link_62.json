        "text": "1\n\nZuljaras\n\nThis weekend will be a pretty chill one\n\nI will be playing Dark Souls 1 this time on the PS4 (as a mage).\n\nI will return to Link Between Worlds as I am only 4 dungeons in.\n\nSingularity is one of the best immersive games so I am playing it again!\n\nAnd most of the time I will scratch that fine ARPG itch with Titan Quest!\n\nHappy gaming!!!\n\n2\n\nOoyah\n\nI am going through a medication withdrawal at the moment, so am definitely in need of some gaming distraction! I am now 25 hours into Etrian Odyssey III. I am enjoying it, although it sure is a grind fest! Kind of suits me at the moment, though, some good old mindless repetition! Have a great weekend, guys, and please take great care of yourselves out there.\n\n3\n\nMarioBrickLayer\n\nI'm still on Zelda Tears of the Kingdom!\n\nI need to get the temple in the desert done, I have completed the other four. I'm also starting to collect the tears. I'm experimenting with fuse to come up with some decent weapons too.\n\n4\n\nBIRYANIMAN\n\nNothing at the moment but I will be done with my exams this week and finally buy TOTK.\n\n5\n\nSequel\n\nTried the ghost trick demo.. and it's still got it. The visuals have been ported well, you don't even miss the second screen. It's so utterly charming. Saying that I'll still likely wait for a sale as I have it on DS.\n\n6\n\nAispen\n\nThe small town mail delivering simulator \"Lake\"\n\nYou can drive a car, walk slightly fast, talk to people and choose whether or not to accept mail without stamps, it's great!\n\nPlaying on psplus, don't understand why it's not on switch yet, would love to play it in my hammock\n\n7\n\ndeecas\n\nFinally did the wind temple in TOTK and since then I’ve been pottering about. Have spent the last few hours of the game exploring the Great Plateau. Now I’m trying to decide where to go next - towards the Zora, Gorons or Gerudo. I’m thinking the Zora will be my next port of call.\n\nElsewhere, maybe a racing game - either Horizon Chase Turbo or some Sega Rally on the Saturn.\n\n8\n\ndarkswabber\n\nI started playing We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie on my Switch. It looks amazing on the OLED and it’s clear the game was remade instead of remastered (played the original last year).\n\nI also finally recieved Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters from Play-Asia.\n\nBesides that I’m playing Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 3 WILDS on my ps5 and switch and I’m playing the Metal Slug Anthology on my psp.\n\n9\n\nAnti-Matter\n\nI played Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town PS4 for a short time this morning since I have Graduation party grade 6 students this evening.\n\n10\n\nPepperMintRex\n\nSo I’m starting to go through the Wolfenstein games with New Blood being the first. Really hard but worth it just for BJ’s inner monologues alone. Should be able to get it done before FF16 rolls around.\n\nSpeaking of which, beat the demo for that not that long ago and it was good! Combat is the obvious highlight, but the Eikon fights are kinda brain dead and the story comes across as a tad bit edgy thus far. Didn’t blow me away like the rest of the internet but was fun enough.\n\n11\n\nozwally\n\nFancying Mario maker 2 this weekend, been well over a year since I played and want to check out community creations\n\n12\n\nGrumblevolcano\n\nMore MK8 Deluxe and either starting TotK or FFX. Haven't decided yet as Summer gaming announcement season made me want to start FFX now and save TotK for after Pikmin 4 but on the other hand loads of people seem very convinced that the next Direct will announce TotK DLC which would no doubt result in TotK spoilers.\n\n13\n\nEverythingnotsaved\n\nCan't tear myself from Tears yet. Even though I've been wanting to play more Advance Wars, I get so lost in Hyrule that the little time I have flies by.\n\n14\n\nChaotic_Neutral\n\nDiablo 4 and maybe some Mario Kart tonight with some friends.\n\n15\n\nNidorom\n\nAfter playing Zelda all week (120 hours in now) I'm taking a break to play Paranomasight, I like it so far! Also a few runs on Hades, I've gotten to the third boss, but I swear the first one is still the hardest for me to overcome every time xD\n\nAlso playing the game of trying not to spend any more money on the Eshop sale, but I'm losing that, on a bit of a rogue-lite spending spree on there.\n\n16\n\nOlrun\n\nStill TotK! I have the determination of 100% like I did with BotW so still a long road to go.\n\nHappy gaming!\n\n17\n\nJhena\n\nStill playing Doraemon Story Of Seasons Friends Of The Great Kingdom. I feel like the story is almost done. My current objective is to get the seed maker, so I can grow high quality stuff.\n\nHappy gaming everyone!\n\n18\n\nS83\n\nI foresee a weekend of Tears of the Kingdom, but I’m also playing a bit of Suikoden and Trails in the Sky on my Vita 💕\n\n19\n\nEdu23XWiiU\n\nTears of the Kingdom, obviously. Then, I'll try to squeeze in some MK11 Aftermath, and whatever I can play with my kids.\n\n20\n\nLony85\n\nJust like last weekend (and most of this week), I plan on playing through more of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Also, with Father’s Day being tomorrow, I’ll get some co-op gaming in with my kids, which is to say Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Super Smash Bros: Ultimate, along with some pizza and soda drinks (as I can’t think of a better way to spend the day).\n\n21\n\nBucket\n\nAfter finishing Breath of the Wild last week I wanted a shorter game. Close to the Sun turned out to be a lot shorter than I expected, though.\n\nSo now I am messing around on Diablo 4, and will probably play Headhunter on the Dreamcast later.\n\n22\n\nFreek\n\nAbout 60% of the way through Aeterna Noctis, loving it.\n\nAlso started Haak, another great Metroidvania, excellent so far.\n\nStill playing Totk in between as well.\n\nGood time to be a gamer and a Metroidvania fan, I have so many to play that my backlog is a Metroidvania.\n\nSo much backtracking and choices that I get lost 😁\n\nHave a great weekend everyone.\n\n23\n\nlarryisaman\n\nStill Zelda. Will take a detour every now and then to Strider (the 2014 one)- really good Metroidvania! It’s a shame it never got ported to Switch\n\n24\n\nnhSnork\n\nI've got Moon Hunters at long last this week, but not the immediate motivation to clear up almost 2 Gb for it (I've been pretty lazy to juggle games and shelves on Switch lately, even though the redownloading process is much less of a hassle these days😅), and I'm still neck-deep in many other roguelites from Isaac (finally done with all ??? marks, now on to Eve's), Crypt of the Necrodancer, Hades, Little Noah and Rogue Legacy, a good few of which might well make it into this weekend's Switch sessions. Beyond that, there are the usual cravings for Xenoblade and GTA, RF5 and Portia, some Terraria and Residual, a new expedition in NMS and ongoing dungeon crawling in Mary Skelter 2, Diablo 2 and/or Katana Kami, potentially more progress in shooters like Borderlands 2, Bioshock 2 or Neighborville, maybe a bit of Grid Autosport and Truck Driver... and then there are recurrent itches for my wide array of more concurrent JRPG playthroughs FFXII, Star Ocean, Minstrel Song, Crosscode, TMS and/or Fuga.\n\nOutside the Switch country, the odds are best for dual screen stuff like Valentia, Endless Frontier and Unwound Future (plus maybe a bite of Resident Evil Mercenaries or MapleStory) and single screen stuff like Neptunia, Gravity Rush, Blue Reflection, Tales of Eternia and IdolMaster Perfect Sun SP, plus possibly some time for the recently procured unofficial translations like Racing Lagoon and Double Cast (the latter a VN boasting a Yuki Kajiura soundtrack long before Xenosaga ever did). Deck anticipates more Xenoblade X, Horizon, FFXV, NFS Payback, FFXIII and Code Vein, but definitely not Mad Max, Binary Domain or Days Gone... due to all of them being shelved (in an external drive's Steam folder because I'm NOT keen on redownloading all of this from scratch😆) while Elder Scrolls Online takes their place. The game's size got it dismissed as so much as a hypothesis on Switch way back when, but there are few games craving full portability more than the one that lets you travel the majority of Tamriel (without Arena/Daggerfall's procedural wilderness and other oldschool quirks, that is). One of my wet dreams is still Switch or its successor getting a similar offline game of this scale, maybe even an actual Arena remake to boot.😄\n\n25\n\nGregamanX\n\nI just beat Unsighted last night, which was a fun little Zelda-like. I started some Super Meat Boy Forever (which I picked up for under $3 on sale), and I may also start up some Jojo All Star Battle R and/or some Cult of the Lamb.\n\n26\n\nBigLarry\n\nHeroes of Ruin on 3DS, XC3:FR on Switch and WoW Classic on PC.\n\n27\n\nMarioBrickLayer\n\n@deecas what did you thinknof the journey t9 the wind temple? It was one of my favourite parts of the game so far.\n\n28\n\nshgamer\n\nI've been revisiting Resident Evil 4 remake on my Steam Deck the last few days. And I got to say it's been quite a lot more fun than in my first playthroughs of the game.\n\nI've been fiddling with the control and camera options, and I've come to the conclusion that it's best to set the controls as close as possible to how they are in the original.\n\nSo I've set the control type to \"C-2\" which means the \"A\" (equivalent to \"B\" on Nintendo consoles or \"X\" on PlayStations) is the run button.\n\nFurthermore I've set the \"Running Camera Assist\" camera option to \"Horizontal & Vertical\". That way the camera auto adjusts after a few seconds when you start running.\n\nVertically it levels out if you're for example looking into ground when you start running. And horizontally the camera sways in the direction you turning while running. It's very much how it is in the original (and 5 for that matter).\n\nOne thing I didn't like about the game on my first playthroughs was that I found it quite bloated (overloaded). There were to many shoot blue medallions, kill 3 rats, fetch golden egg etc. \"side missions\" imo.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I thought shooting the ten blue medallions in the original was fun. But I didn't find doing it 5 or 10 times in the remake was fun. I felt it took the focus away from the core gameplay.\n\nActually I've found out that if you play the game on assisted difficulty (but with auto aim turned off) and you don't really do any of the \"side mission\" the difficulty sort of levels out.\n\nYou are not able to tune up you're weapons etc. as much, but the easy difficulty level makes up for it and you end up getting a pretty fun and focused experience over all (not having to spend time doing the \"side quests\").\n\nMy personal score of the game went from 7/10 to 8.5/10 after doing these adjustments. Over all I find it's a pretty fun horror themed shooter. Still not as good as the original (that's a 9.5/10 in my book), but then again not bad at all.\n\n29\n\nKirbyo\n\nAfter clearing The Legend of Zelda: the Minish Cap, I decided my next target should be Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga. Havn't played much, but so far, so good.\n\n30\n\nJohnnyMind\n\nNot seeing my friends tonight so I'll continue with my schedule of alternating between Tears of the Kingdom (beat the Wind Temple, 1 Temple, 29 Shrines, 2 Lightroots and 48 Koroks down), Persona 5 (the Change of Heart for the fifth Palace has just happened), Engage (did Chapter 13, 13 Chapters, 4 Paralogues, 5 Divine Paralogues and all Fell Xenologue down), Scarlet (attended all lessons and took all midterm exams currently available, still 5 Gyms, 3 Titans and 3 Team Stars down), Sparks of Hope (got the first crystal of the fifth planet), Return to Dream Land (did 1 \"Level\" in Extra Mode, Story complete, gold in all normal Challenge Stages, 3 \"Levels\" in Extra Mode, Magolor Epilogue complete, Arena complete and all missions in Merry Magoland) and Advance Wars (tutorial and 15 missions down, 10 S and 5 A ranks)!\n\n31\n\nShadeon_Koopa\n\nMore Tears of the Kingdom obviously (120+ hours in, I've now cleared all tears and towers, still yet to tackle a single temple; what's wrong with me lol), and will try to make more progress in We Love Katamari + Royal Reverie (nearing the end; once I beat that, I should really get back into more Against the Storm on Steam. Fantastic roguelite, that one).\n\n32\n\ngeo-shifter\n\nJust beat Diablo 4 main campaign, so about to grind for legendaries in higher Tiers. Bought Flynn: Son of Crimson on Sale. Still have We Love Katamari to play more, but I don’t want to rush that game. I’ll play it for years to come until the next remaster release. I’m trying not to buy Ghost Trick since I have it on DS, but it looks sooo good. I’m trying not to buy anything else on sale because I want The Lara Croft Collection when it comes out at the end of the month.\n\n33\n\nThe_Pixel_King\n\nAll these weeks later, I’m still playing Tears of the Kingdom and literally nothing else. No game has ever gripped me like this, and 95 hours later, I’m still enjoying it like the day it came out. Maybe even more. I’m someone who always has at least two or three games on the boil at any given time, so this alone, indicates what a truly special game this is. Will it end up being my favourite game ever? Almost definitely!\n\nI’ve downloaded some demo’s to play, such as Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective (Switch) which I adored back on the DS, Final Fantasy XVI, Street Fighter 6 and Lies of P (all PS5), but I just can’t tear(!) myself away from Zelda.\n\n@Ooyah Good luck with any withdrawal symptoms, buddy. I’ve been there and I know what you’re probably going through. If it helps to talk, I’m here.\n\n34\n\nwazlon\n\nI'm playing some Splatoon 3 and Ring Fit Adventure. Might play something else but not sure yet. I'd like Wario Land 2 on my Switch because I want to play that before the third game so hopefully it's coming soon, thought it was odd to release the third game first.\n\n35\n\nDAHstroy\n\n@JohnnyMind if I were playing that many games at once I’d lose my mind! 😂\n\n36\n\ngaga64\n\nThis week I will be mostly crying\n\nTears of the Kingdom\n\n37\n\nRistar24\n\nStill Tears of the Kingdom... so much to see and explore, has to be one of the best open world titles I've played. Except for that, some more Ultra Street Fighter 2 (I do want to pick up SF6 soon), and some Tetris Effect which I picked up in the recent sales.\n\n38\n\nPicola-Wicola\n\nTears. I have not even loaded a single other game since 12 May; I cannot get enough. Just got the Master Sword this morning, and just wow. Wasn’t expecting it to be there! I did download Retro City Rampage DX and Downwell for dirt cheap after reading NLife’s recommendations of 9/10 games on sale, so if I can tear myself away from Zelda, I will give those a go.\n\n39\n\nMarioBrickLayer\n\n@geo-shifter what did you think of the journey to the wind temple? I thought it was excellent.\n\n@JohnnyMind I've been waiting for the Lara Croft collection since it was announced, I can't wait to play it but i'm hoping for a physical release.\n\n40\n\ngeo-shifter\n\n@MarioBrickLayer I think you got me and @JohnnyMind mixed up. lol\n\nRight now, I’m only seeing the collection listed on eShop. No physicals in sight yet.\n\n41\n\nTeksetter\n\nThis week I’ve played a little Etrian Odyssey HD as my preorder delivered from Japan earlier this month. It’’s been good, basic fun and well worth the effort to break out my dusty old kanji dictionary from time to time (there’s no English on this cart, unlike the Asian region release). That said, TOTK is bound to suck me back in soon, though overall I’ve had a lack of time to game lately.\n\nHave a fun weekend everyone, and Happy Father’s Day to all you awesome gamer dads out there!\n\n42\n\nJohnnyMind\n\n@DAHstroy Yeah, playing so many games at once can feel overwhelming at times, but overall I don't mind the variety and to be fair I usually play only two of them for 1-2 hours a day each which definitely makes it easier.\n\n@MarioBrickLayer Did you tag me by mistake since I didn't mention The Lara Croft Collection at all? Anyway, fingers crossed there will be a physical release like you're hoping for and I wish you have fun playing it when you get it regardless!\n\n43\n\nMarioBrickLayer\n\n@geo-shifter ha ha! I did, sorry!!\n\nYeah, I have only seen an eshop listing too. As it's Embracer game I wonder if we'll see a release from Limited Run Games.\n\n44\n\nMarioBrickLayer\n\n@JohnnyMind I mixed up my comments and tags, sorry! I meant to ask you what you thought of the journey to the wind temple? It's one of my favourite parts of the game so far.\n\n45\n\nJohnnyMind\n\n@geo-shifter Seems like the case XD Oh well, we had a fun little exchange thanks to that mistake.\n\nHope you have fun playing all the games you mentioned (by the way, despite already having the original I'm getting Ghost Trick for sure as it looks so good indeed)!\n\n@MarioBrickLayer Quite enjoyed the journey to the Wind Temple, definitely a highlight for me, too!\n\n46\n\nMischiefMaker\n\nI finally escaped hell! After about 55 attempts I beat Hades for the first time. Almost without using any death defiances as well, somehow. What a game. Time to put it to bed again for a while but I think I will come back to it. Still plenty to unlock and story to uncover.\n\nAlso picked Octopath Traveller back up again after a couple of months away, and a little bit of splatoon 3.\n\n47\n\nSambuc\n\nI've been playing Forspoken on PS5 and The Grinch on Dreamcast.\n\n48\n\nMrkittyhead\n\nI’m sadly done with TotK’s main story, but I’m pleased to say that I’ve started Origami King, and it’s way better than people made it sound.\n\n49\n\nKirbysonic\n\nCurrently playing through Chrono Cross- getting to grips with that battle system! Also still on the old 100% grind for Harvestella. And I've dug out my 3ds and have started a new Animal Crossing: New Leaf file.\n\n50\n\nkoffing\n\nJust finished GRIS.\n\nPlaying FF6 Pixel Remaster and Trails in the Sky 1. Paused on ToTK for a bit. Maybe some Chicory coop with my SO.\n\n51\n\nNintendoWife\n\nZelda, and I'm progressing SO SLOWLY! Some of the quests take forever, so much walking and climbing (\"Call From The Depths\")... but I might be playing it wrong. Anyway it will be months before I wrap up the game.\n\n52\n\nKraven\n\nThis weekend I’m playing Diablo 4. This game is an absolute blast. I convinced my best friend to buy the game, and now he can’t put it down. This is the first time in years that we have played a game cooperatively, whether with each other or someone else. It’s been really fun, too. We have just reached Act II, as we take our time and do everything we possibly can before venturing off into the main quest.\n\nI chose the Barbarian class. I’m currently working on a crowd control build, and let me tell you - it’s absolutely sensational. My best friend is also playing as a Barbarian, and it’s interesting to see how drastic our builds are; it’s almost as if we are two different classes altogether.\n\nWith all of that said - I do have a secondary character that is a Rogue, and I’ll occasionally use him to play cooperatively. This is primarily due to having somewhat of a variety when playing together.\n\nI also find the (side) quests to be fantastic. One in particular stood out titled Malady of the Soul. It turns out to be a lengthy 3-parter that has a good narrative with memorable characters. Another quest that is unforgettable for me is called “Cries of Innocence” (Black Asylum). It is a very twisted story involving a father and son, and it has left a lasting impression.\n\nOverall, the grind and addiction is real. The dopamine I receive from this game is on another level. I can’t wait to play more once I’m off work tonight.\n\n53\n\nThisdamian\n\nTotk still for me still loving it\n\nMight start playing some more of my enormous backlog on the switch as well and start cyberpunk and Gotham knights on my steam deck\n\nIf I get some time in the evening then maybe Diablo 4 on the ps4 and a bit of god of war ragnarok\n\nHappy gaming all I always love reading the comments on here every Saturday\n\n54\n\nTyranexx\n\nStill dawdling around in Tears of the Kingdom. These Koroks and shrines won't find themselves! XD Just hit 80 hours, about to tackle the second dungeon (at Goron City now), 74 shrines, 274 Korok seeds, 16 Lightroots (Saving a lot of the Depths for later in my playthrough, but I go occasionally) and three tears of light left.\n\nAlso still playing the occasional round of WarioWare: Get It Together! and think I'm about to the credits. Mostly pushing TotK in my very limited gaming time lately. I still don't know how some have time to play games for 8+ hours a day.... 😅\n\nHappy gaming!\n\n55\n\nBandeeOfTheStars\n\nI'll be pretty busy this weekend, but I'll probably spend any game time I have on Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light. With The Blazing Blade coming to Switch in a matter of days, it can't hurt to go ahead and finish the one I'm playing.\n\nI'm on Chapter 4, and permadeath already stings. I was never great at chess, which this game very much reminds me of...I guess I'd better get good fast, huh?\n\n56\n\nMarcusIsCool\n\nI’m trying to finish AA5 (dual destinies).\n\nI’m in the final case, which has lots of dramatic points.\n\n57\n\nDeemo37\n\nI beat TOTK yesterday and it was fantastic. I likely still have stuff to do in it. I also finished up the original Uncharted and may move on to a sequel if I feel like picking it up. Apart from that I’ll probably go back to Hollow Knight as well as I never beat it.\n\n58\n\nYalloo\n\nStill on Nier: Automata here. Cleared the story and most of the endings (missing 3 of them, and of course the E ending as I don't want to give up my save data, the screenshot will be enough ) roughly 50% into side quests, weapons, pods and other collectibles.\n\nThis game has grown on me and I'm curious to see what other surprises are left. Gameplay could be improved, but everything else is really cool (ah well, loading times are sometimes a bit long).\n\nStill enjoying Tetris 99 as well, as I feel that I can take on some of the challenges there too.\n\n59\n\nshonenjump86\n\nStreet Fighter 6\n\n60\n\nNintendoByNature\n\nWell, I finished both totk and shantae half genie hero this week. With that said, I fired up diablo 3 on switch, and I'm not sure what I'll play on xbox. I was thinking something short like planet of lana, or chicory.\n\n61\n\nLink41x\n\nThe Wolf Among Us (Vita) - Starting Episode 2 this weekend. I forgot how awesome this game is!\n\nImperia Online (Windows Phone) - Also still plodding along with this as well.\n\n62\n\nWiiiiiiiiiii\n\nNow that's a very good question\n\nPrince of Persia the sands of time\n\nProfessor layton and the curious village(android)\n\nPersona 3 portable\n\nPlanet of lana\n\nSands of time is my first PoP, and it's a very good game, but the camera is a little annoying and there's some really bad bugs.\n\nI'm playing professor layton with my mother and we both enjoy it very much.\n\nPersona 3 is my first JRPG, I love it but mostly because of social links\n\nPlanet of lana is good too\n\n63\n\nMegaChem\n\nStill slowly making my way through TOTK and enjoying every second of it. Playing some Mega Man Battle Network on the side.\n\n64\n\nsd7232\n\nMLB 23 Xbox\n\nMadden 23 Xbox\n\nNBA 2K16 Xbox (the gameplay in 2K23 sux IMO)\n\nSuper Mario 3 NES (on Switch)\n\n65\n\nVortexeo\n\nFather's day is this weekend so I'm gonna spend a lot of time with my dad! I finished up my final projects for my classes so I may have more time to play games next week . I'm hoping to finally finish Tales of Arise. I'm about 31 hours into that game and I just defeated the fifth lord. I'm also about 21 hours into 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim. I have been trying to beat both of these games since April 😅\n\n66\n\nCashews\n\nI'm confident in saying I will only be playing Street Fighter 6 World Tour - preparing for the eventual move to online battles. So far the RPG is much better than I could have hoped for in a fighter.\n\nAlso toying around with gamepass - seeing whats on it. I haven't booted up an xbox in around 12 years so it all feel new and fresh.\n\nIt's funny though people complain about the Switch UI a lot. I appreciate it's simplicity more than that of the X series. The X is more robust of course but it's also convoluted with ads and nonsense I don't want.\n\nI'm a dad so I expect to be mostly ignored tomorrow. Which is actually ideal.\n\n67\n\nRubyCarbuncle\n\nI took a break from Zelda for a little while but I want to go back to it now. I recently obtained the Master Sword and I swear pulling the Sword out of wherever it is never gets old. Also after watching the Mario movie which I loved btw I feel like playing some Mario games and when I'm finished with those I'll probably play some Resident Evil 4 Remake along with Dead Space Remake.\n\n68\n\nERGgamin\n\nTears of the Kingdom\n\nBlossom Tales 2\n\nSonic Colors\n\n69\n\nZeldaFan83\n\nTotK. Currently on the Fire Temple and have most of the map discovered.\n\nGoing to be on this one for months. So much that I finished up whatever games I was playing before TotK.\n\n70\n\nDannyboy89\n\nBeen playing NFS Hot Pursuit which is good fun, and the cross play means you’re always in a packed lobby straight away.\n\nJust finished Xenoblade Chronicles 3 but can’t bring myself to buy the expansion as it is quite expensive. I also haven’t played 2 as tried it and didn’t like the anime style, so won’t understand much of the Rex elements, is it worth it?\n\nToying with a purchase of Ys VIII for my next RPG series so I can get through VIII and IX ahead of the release of X later this year, apparently it’s great.\n\nAny advise welcome! Happy gaming!\n\n71\n\nShambo\n\nPortal, and when I'm done with that, Portal 2 I guess. I started both games before on PS3, but handheld with gyro and everything running as smooth as it does, I'll get through them easy this time. And I'm also in the mood for some weird and underappreciated horror movies, for some reason.\n\n72\n\nJustMonika\n\nObviously Little Busters.. I'm on Kud's route now. After this it'll be Mio's route and then I'll unlock Refrain and get into the main meat of LB.\n\n73\n\nthe_beaver\n\nStill TotK, of course. It's gonna be like this for a while. This game is HUGE.\n\n74\n\nMeloMan\n\nI beat Kirby and the Forgotten Land, but of course, there's just a liiiiitle bit more to get the truuuue ending... And of course I'm doing it smh. I did intersperse a little Arkanoid Eternal Battle, and to a lesser extent, Adventure of Lolo (?) for a hot second. I need to start to think about my next game, and I think it will be Metroid Dread-- It's time to start and end the main storyline of Metroid for me as I've played them all, and I need to see how it ends. Plus I particularly took a break from Metroidvanias on purpose for this reason to play the originator of them all.\n\n75\n\nFishyS\n\nI have a 3-day weekend so I grabbed some wishlist items on good summer sales and will be checking them out:\n\nKitaria Fables\n\nForager\n\nCosmo Dreamer\n\nI'll also be doing a periodic revisit to a couple games I'm taking forever to100% but still greatly enjoy:\n\nCaptain Toad: Treasure Tracker\n\nKirby's Return to Dreamland Deluxe\n\n@MeloMan Is Arkanoid Eternal Battle good? I noticed it on sale for less than $10, but the reviews weren't great so I wasn't sure if it is worth it.\n\n76\n\nP-Man\n\nMore Tears of the Kingdom of course. I’ve just finished my third dungeon, and I’m still explore Hyrule to the fullest.\n\nI’ll also be playing Fortnite and Forza Horizon 5.\n\n77\n\nRyne-Gaia\n\nThis weekend will be kinda simple when it comes to games. Some Metroid Prime on the Switch. I beat Fire Emblem Engage so Metroid is next up. I made it to the Phendrana Drifts and it’s incredibly pretty and honestly has made me fall in love with the game. As for the PlayStation it’s the new season of Fortnite with some pals and maybe some SF6? Otherwise probably some SpongeBob Cosmic Shake. Genuinely that gsmr is a sleeper hit of this year. I mean it all falls by the wayside when FFXVI comes out this week right hahahah. As for the anime you know it’s the usual Hell’s Paradise, Mashle, My Home Hero and Cafè Terrace. Have a good weekend everyone and happy gaming.\n\n78\n\nTakoda\n\nThe reused map in Totk means I’m really not that interested in focusing much on that (plus the depths being oh so boring to explore for the most part since it all just looks the same) but it’s the perfect game to just turn my brain off, walk around, do some quests, find some shrines… so instead of what I expected Totk being my main focus, it’s just kind of nice as a perpetual side game. Enjoying it more that way too, because that main story is a disappointment and a half for the most part.\n\n79\n\nRyu_Niiyama\n\nTears of the Kingdom. Haven't really been playing anything else. It's soo good!\n\n80\n\nGiancarlothomaz\n\ncontuinng my journey on Tears of the Kingdom, with 160h, 79 shirnes completed, 40 Lightroot unlocked, 14 Batteries, 20 hearts and nearly 3 stamina wheel completed, 2 Dungeons completed(wind and fire temple), nearly the map all unlocked, Master Sword in hand, Master Kohga quest done\n\n81\n\nFizza\n\nNot going to try and dive into too many big experiences this week in the build-up to Ghost Trick coming out at the end of the month, but I've been dabbling in a fair amount of games nonetheless. I finally started Street Fighter Alpha 3 through the 30th Anniversary Collection and have been having a great time so far (minus the absolute brutality that is Shin Bison) in addition to firing up a few retro offerings on NSO for the first time (namely BurgerTime Deluxe, Super Valis IV and Ghosts n' Goblins). I'm also about to start Kirby and the Forgotten Land very soon which I am exceptionally excited to get going as a Kirby superfan myself.\n\nOverall, a weekend filled with great stuff about to tee up what will hopefully be my GOTY 😊\n\n82\n\nRooty\n\nPlenty of Breath of the Wild (just purchased the Expansion pass after clearing all the Divine Beasts) and the smallest sprinkling of OG Mass Effect. Sometimes you just have a hankering for yesterday.\n\n83\n\nKryptoniteKrunch\n\nMore TotK of course.\n\nAlso went back to Crysis 3 recently(was playing that before TotK came out). I also picked up 20XX recently on sale, might play a bit of that too.\n\n84\n\nAxecon\n\nGot back from a long camping trip, so I'm all in for catching up with some Zelda!\n\n85\n\nDuncanballs\n\nTOTK is the only game I have played since May 12th. Might aim to complete by the end of the month and move onto FF16. Tempted to start a run-through of the Uncharted games again at some point as well.\n\nI'll need a new RPG for Autumn. Here's hoping Nintendo give us a Xenoblade X port.\n\n86\n\ndeecas\n\n@MarioBrickLayer, I also loved it! … and you’ve just reminded me that I need to go back and do a shrine there… thanks!\n\n87\n\nKhezu\n\nBeen sick with the flu all week so been smashing through the backlog. Beat enter the gungeon finally, beat furi, beat olli olli 2, got to the end of (the massively overrated indie platformer) Rite (and gave up on the last level), and last night beat breath of the wild for the first time. At the moment playing golf story but think I might start on deaths door soon.\n\n88\n\nKaspari_Villalobos\n\nI FINALLY started TotK 3 days ago and only about 8 hours in but it is magnificent. I will force myself to do a temple this weekend but I am also still glued to mastering Sifu and my usual daily match on Into the Breach.\n\nLately i have been craving an old favourite of mine on PC, Opus Magnum by Zachtronics though I would like to finish my first play through of TotK first.\n\n89\n\nVyacheslav333\n\nNintendo Switch:\n\nSkullgirls 2nd Encore – played CPU QUICK MATCH mode for a little bit.\n\nPersona4 The ULTIMAX ULTRA SUPLEX HOLD – played Versus mode for a little bit.\n\nWindows:\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge – played on my best friend's PC. Completed 1st and 2nd epidodes on 3rd(hard?) level difficulty. We've played as Splinter(me) and Raphael(he).\n\nThe Binding of Isaac: Repentance – played for 40 or 44 minutes. We've played as Judas(he) and Azazel(me). We've failed at the Cathedral.\n\nWell... That's all what I've played on this week. Have a nice gaming week, everyone.\n\n90\n\nTakeawaydj\n\nMy niece turend 10 and gave her Super Mario Odyssey. An instant hit!\n\n91\n\nMarioBrickLayer\n\n@Kaspari_Villalobos I sound like a broken record but the journey to the wind temple is excellent, one of the most enjoyable parts of the game for me so far.\n\n92\n\nNidorom\n\n@FishyS\n\nCould you possibly let me know if you like Cosmo Dreamer when/if you get round to it, it's in my wishlist but I'm not sure if it will be good or not.\n\nI loved Kitaria Fables and Forager <3\n\n93\n\nOoyah\n\n@Dannyboy89\n\nI think that YS VIII is just exceptional. It would be in my all time top ten. Brilliant story, really great characters, intriguing situations, and the pacing is amazing. Also, great combat, and a gorgeous island to explore. Of course, you may not agree, but I really hope that you do enjoy it if you go for it!\n\n@The_Pixel_King\n\nThanks for this, I appreciate that. I've done a few prescription medication withdrawals now, so I know to taper! Takes longer overall, but is often smoother. Nothing to do but grit teeth, and see it out! 😆 I hope that you are doing okay yourself at the moment.\n\n94\n\nKaspari_Villalobos\n\n@MarioBrickLayer i did it this morning and have finally gotten into the cloud on the ship where the puzzle starts. The journey thus far is as you have described, this level design is masterclass. Nintendo has raised the bar to the highest it has ever been….its so incredibly well thought out…\n\n95\n\nMarioBrickLayer\n\n@Kaspari_Villalobos I completely agree!! Enjoy the rest!!\n\n96\n\nKaspari_Villalobos\n\n@MarioBrickLayer thanks mate, have a good weekend.\n\n97\n\nFishyS\n\n@Nintendancies It's been awhile since I've been as instantly addicted to a game as I am Forager. I played for basically 5 hours straight last night and I want more.\n\nI've only played a few levels of cosmo dreamer so far but I'm really enjoying it. I played some of the first 5 levels at 3 different difficulty levels. Expert has a lot of bullets to dodge already so not sure about the 4th difficulty. 😝 I'm mostly sticking with the easier two for now for first playthrough. The game is pretty 'basic' by shmup standards in that it's individual-level-based and although you get some choices in weapons when you start a level, it doesn't seem to upgrade. So far in the game I start with 3 hearts and you can collect up to 3 specials during the level to help with the boss or get out of a bind. Seems like I will gain more hearts later. The game has very generous hit boxes and a slow-time button for when things get so out of control that you need extra time to react. Between those two it feels, not easy, but quite fair even in expert mode with zillions of bullets everywhere. The bosses are reasonably lengthed and fairly fun. I suspect people who like super hard shoot-em-ups may think this game is a bit too easy but it feels great to me. Of course the main thing is the art — everything is incredibly cute and lovely.. as you slaughter it all 😆 And the music is simple but a nice background bop. Again, I'm early in the game, but I'm already pretty satisfied with my purchase given the sale price.\n\n98\n\nSillyG\n\nStill obsessed with Tears of the Kingdom.\n\nAnd I never watched any trailers before the fact as they didn't interest me in the slightest. What made BotW so magical was the fact that I knew almost nothing about it and I wanted to repeat that with TotK.\n\nI didn't even enter my first chasm until about 60 hours in (and I'm glad I waited as max stamina is essential).\n\nI'm now 115+ hours in and I only just unlocked my first geoglyph memory yesterday. (I've since gone on to unlock a few more)\n\nSo many hours in and I feel like I'm barely scratching the surface. Had it been any other game, I'd be irate that I haven't yet seen the credits after pouring 100+ hours into it.\n\nI also went on a bit of a shrine binge as the Lightroots appear to correspond to a shrine on the surface, though there have been a few where I couldn't figure out how to make them appear (or whether they might be tucked away in caves).\n\nI've unlocked the entirety of the surface/sky maps, but I'm probably at about 30-40% of the depths, which took me long enough. Some of the towers that eluded me earlier were a lot easier to unlock than it initially seemed.\n\nSo far, I've gone in completely blind, only encountering a tiny handful of minor spoilers by accident (mainly by reading the forums/comments), but I'm having a blast. If I'm still stuck, say, 300+ hours in, on finding the rest of the shrines/Koroks and the like (I definitely won't find all of the Koroks without a guide), then I'll eventually start to spoil myself like I did with BotW.\n\nBut I absolutely recommend going into BotW/TotK as blind as possible. The experience is well worth savouring.\n\n99\n\nNidorom\n\n@FishyS\n\nYeah it was such a good little game, I remember wishing there were more when I beat it. I wonder if they added any more content since I last played it.🤔\n\nGlad to hear you're having fun with it! This will be my first punt with the genre really, other than games that have elements of it in their gameplay as a sort of mini-game.\n\nSimplicity is not always a bad thing, and as I said it will be my first foray into the genre so I don't have any expectations, which is a blessing sometimes. Sounds like it has some sense of progression at least, which is good, I wasn't even expecting different weapons to be honest, so that's nice.\n\nSounds good to me! I don't mind a challenge if I know what I'm getting into (think games that are marketed as hard like Bleak sword, Katana Zero and Hades) but most of the time I'll happily flaunt the fact that I play the majority of my games on easy. By the way you describe it, it doesn't have any cheap tactics and if you screw up, it feels like it's our own fault. I will stay well away from expert though! haha\n\nYeah honestly the cuteness is what caught my attention in the first place, as shallow as that sounds\n\nGood I think I will grab it then, thanks so much for your detailed reply!\n\nI read comments a lot and I always see you here playing games that most people never heard of, little budget titles and obscure indies. I tend to do the same, check the eshop daily for potential hidden gems that are affordable. Of course the price for this one in particular seems like a no brainer, but (and I'm sure you can relate) when games are so cheap you can end up with a lot of them that aren't even worth that price because they are so bad, like I'll buy this here and that one there and end up with a lot of crud amongst the few gems xD\n\nNot that it isn't worth it though for the ones that are good. My backlog is already over-inflated as it, but if I can cheat a little and ask someone else first then I will xD\n\n100\n\nFishyS\n\n@Nintendancies That has to be one of the most wholesome replies I've had on this site. I mean, it's a comment section, so there aren't many back and forths by construction, mostly just forths.\n\nReplies tend to be snarky and/or informational thrown into the wind in the hopes they might be slightly useful or amusing to someone. Either that or they are arguments. 😆 It's a weird little community here with a bunch of 'regular' commenters like us sort of in a big conversation but not really. It's nice to get some feedback occasionally though so thank you for that.\n\nA few days ago there was a review of that Miku game and the review was negative but a comment you made really put the nail in the coffin for me, so glad I could return the favor. Although, fair warning, I wrote my recommendation of Cosmo Dreamer assuming you were more familiar with 'bullet hell' games. I think this one is 'relatively' friendly to newcomers, but from one perspective the whole genre is a chaotic mess (even the ones NintendoLife rates 9/10), sooo... I hope you manage to enjoy! 😆 I feel like these types of games might be an acquired taste. But at least this one is super adorable.\n\n101\n\nNidorom\n\n@FishyS\n\nWhoops.... I did it again, sorry my comment is a two-parter and wouldn't fit it one comment, I like to talk way too much.\n\nPart 1:\n\nAww thankyou, I didn't really intend it to be, I just love games so it's nice to talk about them with others, that and me rather selfishly wanting to know if something is worth buying, because with games that niche there are very few if any reviews around.\n\nThing is I don't have any friends really, let alone friends that are as into the Switch as me so I really enjoy reading people's comments, hearing about their experiences, what they are playing, how opinions can be so varied, ect.\n\nI've found many a useful comment on here, usually a couple of days after a review goes live and someone is playing it and giving their two cents on the game, or I've found a game I've never heard of that someone is playing and I check it out, so I'm grateful for that.\n\nI think people are wary of clogging up comments sections, that or they have had their say and now they are done, or maybe just not getting the time to reply to everyone as much as they'd like. Even I can't resist a little snark or joke sometimes but I do try to be constructive as possible.\n\nIt's a shame there are so many arguments, but I have mad respect to the team that try to keep it under control, I couldn't do that job. It makes me sad that people with a difference in opinion like someone not liking TOTK for example, get treated really nastily but I digress.\n\nI just really appreciate someone taking time out of their day to answer questions about games I may have, I try to do the same when asked, though I can never keep it concise, I just waffle on for ages it's a character flaw (case and point here) xD\n\n102\n\nNidorom\n\n@FishyS\n\nPart 2:\n\nActually, yeah you're right, I guess I had never really thought about it like that. I was a lurker long before I was a member, but there are people I've spoken to consistently that I would almost call friends based on our interactions, but neither of us have outwardly said anything. It's also funny that you notice when someone hasn't been around lately. It's really nice and is definitely one of the better things about sites like this one.\n\nYeah I don't hold back if a game has problems. My recent grilling of how Cassette Beasts runs on Switch is a good example of that, but I'm glad it helped you. To be fair that was 100% my fault. The Eshop description was very clear on what it was, but still, I didn't expect it to be quite that bad. I buy these sorts of games to unwind for an hour before bed, the sort that most would absolutely scoff at, and not without good reason but I find joy in smaller games and I know you do as well, it makes you appreciate the 10's out there all the more, and they deserve a chance to be played, though my own mortality might prove to humble me on this mindset of mine xD\n\nAnyway, I bought the Miku Jigsaw puzzle for example, was it shovelware? Oh yes but it was well made and even had co-op, had some good music and I spent way longer than I'd care to admit playing it, even roped my partner into helping me complete a few puzzles xD\n\nThankyou for elaborating on that, it's really helpful but I figure you have to start somewhere, I certainly won't hold it against you if I end up sucking at it xD. I do play games that are 2D and have bullet-hell like mechanics, think like twin-stick shooters where the whole screen is filled with shots that will kill you so I'm hoping that will help a bit, I quite enjoy the zen like state you get where you aren't manually thinking about dodging, your fingers just move the controller on instinct to get out of the way.\n\nSorry about my absolute word vomit here xD\n\nAs I say to anyone I gift a text wall, don't feel the need to reply if you don't want to! x\n\n103\n\nDpullam\n\nI am pretty late to the party, but I played The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom this weekend every chance I had. I will probably do the same thing next weekend if i am not too busy too.\n\n104\n\nFishyS\n\n@Nintendencies I admit I somehow didn't realize these responses had a word limit XD I feel like I write relatively long reviews or game rankings or replies occasionally, but apparently they always fit in one post. 🤔\n\nFrom what you just described, you should be fine with Cosmo Dreamer; it assumes you know what you're doing, but what you're doing is just shooting non-stop and dodging 😆 But the game's description just says 'shooting game' which is really not meaningful to someone who doesn't already understand the specific sub-genre.\n\n105\n\nNidorom\n\n@FishyS\n\nI can confirm it does, or at least it does for me.\n\nGrabbed it, thanks! Will give it a go when TOTK unhooks me."
