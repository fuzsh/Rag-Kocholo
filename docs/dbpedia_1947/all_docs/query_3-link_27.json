        "text": "The Good\n\nThis was one of the first PS2 games I remember buying other than ICO.\n\nI'll jump right on the graphics as usual. AMAZING! I new the PS2 was capable of these sort of graphics, but it's so much better when you actually get to see them in motion. I love the way the prince moves effortlessly across walls, it's so smooth and natural looking that no other games acrobatics can match it. The environments were dreamlike and absolutely surreal at times. The glowing ,sparkly fog in some of those levels could only work in this game. The character models could have been better as far as the hands were concerned, but that is such a small gripe compared to how wonderful they look. The monsters are all very imaginative and very challenging. Fara and the prince look exquisite and are some of the best I've ever seen on the PS2.\n\nNow on to the sound. Half and half. Sometimes it's at the right volume, and sometimes it's far too low. I know some of it was for dramatic effect, but it can be to quiet for it's own good. The voice acting sometimes sounded rush but rarely stilted or stiff. But overall it was very well done and incredibly convincing. I also like the music, even if doesn't fit the age it's in.\n\nThe con-trolls were very intuitive and easy to learn after a few tries. There isn't much other than that to discuss in the con-troll department.\n\nNow on to the gameplay. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST ROCK SOLID GAMES I HAVE EVER PLAYED!!!! Seriously! Jumping from walls, running on walls, jumping off platforms precariously perched over bottomless pits, swinging from poles, and the revolutionary realtime rewind all come together for a amazing experience ! And something else I didn't experience in any other game before was how the story was told with minimal cutscenes. You'll be pulling a lever and the prince will start his tale from that particular point. The distance between save points was annoying, but not aggravating. Overall no major complaints here! Oh, and the load times are always short! No long waits! And one last note, the original Prince of Persia is a unlockable ! I never got past level two, but it's the original! Come on !\n\nThe Bad\n\nSome of the sequences where you have to jump between walls was kind of hard. And some of the fights early on in the game could drain your patience if you didn't have a lot of it. And in the original game that you can unlock, I can't make that last jump in level two.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nGet it ! you'll love it ! The best Prince of Persia game since the original is the best one since! No other sequel will ever match what this one did.\n\nThe Good\n\nThe best feature about Sands of Time is by far the graphics and the way it has been programmed. Don't believe the recommendations for the game.... all you need is a good graphics card. I ran it on a slow 400 MHz Celeron and it ran at full graphics at full speed. The GeForce4 did all the work.\n\nGreat controls, movement/animation, graphics, sound/music, time-rewind, fight moves, fantastic level designs, etc... It must also be said that the way The Sands of Time captured the feel of the original games was very well done.\n\nThe addition of the 'dagger of time' adds another element into the game by allowing you to rewind time if something didn't happen as expected. Very cool.\n\nThe Bad\n\nAt the start of the game you sit and play with a sense of awe. However after 20 levels of repetitive puzzle room -> too long fight sequence -> save point, it starts getting a little tiresome. Then towards the end, the puzzles start picking up their level of difficulty, and things get interesting.... especially once you have to fight without your 'dagger of time' :) Thankfully by th time the fantastic ending comes, you're well back into it. :)\n\nOne thing to note is that the porting of this PS2 game to the PC left behind some flaws. There two points in the game I personally got stuck, and it was due to the game responding too fast/slow. The only way past the situations is varying the number of background applications, enabling 'haste' mode, trying different camera angles, and a whole lot of luck. I assume that this wouldn't be an issue on a faster machine.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nA kick ass action-puzzle game with graphics that will leave you gasping for more. Imagine a sword yielding Persian, with the ability to rewind time if something goes wrong, and the agility of tony hawk, merged all into one.\n\nI thoroughly recommend it.... well worth the expense.\n\nThe Good\n\nPrince of Persia: The Sands of Time has you in control of The Prince (he has no name other than that), who tells a story of how he unlocked The Sands of Time. It clearly borrows elements from Sacrifice, with the Prince giving past-tense voiceovers and when you die, the Prince says \"That's not how it happened,\" but it does this better than Sacrifice, since death messages often change due to context, such as falling, being slain in battle, getting impaled by spikes, etc.\n\nThe opening level is the Prince's story of taking the Dagger of Time during a battle. The battle ends with the Prince's father conquering the enemy, and taking some of his treasures, including the Sands of Time, which are inside a large hourglass. A vizier who betrayed the conquered emperor tricks the Prince into using the dagger to unlocking the Sands, which turn everyone except the Prince, the vizier, and a slave girl named Farah into sand monsters.\n\nDuring the game, the Prince joins forces with Farah to undo what he had done. Much of the game consists of acrobatics, which the Prince is quite good at. As well as the classic jumping and hanging onto ledges, the Prince can tumble, shimmy across ledges, walk across beams, swing on ropes and bars, run up and along walls, and rebound jump off walls to get to higher ground. Oh, and he can climb up columns and poles and jump off of them. He will occasionally have to do this while avoiding a variety of traps, such as saws, spikes, chomper thingies, flying swords, and many other bladed and pointy things.\n\nThere is also combat against sand creatures. After the first level, the Prince will no longer fight regular humans. Sand creatures cannot be killed normally. They must be beaten into submission and then stabbed with the Dagger of Time (or frozen with it and then cut up several times). Stabbing a stunned creature with the Dagger recharges sand and power tanks, which allow you to use the dagger's special powers. The dagger's most useful function is to rewind time to before the Prince's death should you make a mistake. It can also freeze an enemy, slow down time, and speed up the Prince to breakneck velocities.\n\nCombat has its fair share of unique acrobatic moves. The Prince can vault over an enemy and attack them (and if you do it fast enough, you can even go in with a quick stab with the Dagger to retrieve sand. But some stronger enemies cannot be vaulted over, in which case you will need to jump off a wall and vault over them that way. There is also a way to shoot yourself off the wall and knock down all enemies in your path. The game controls quite well with the keyboard and mouse, and I sincerely doubt there will be any time that you wish for a gamepad.\n\nThe graphics are amazing. The original Prince of Persia was famous for its smooth animation, and The Sands of Time does it even better. I can't remember a single time when the Prince's animation seemed unrealistic. Framerates almost never slow down, so you can truly appreciate the graphics. The water effects are amazing. While you'll only be seeing pools and ponds rather than oceans, the effects for them are stunning. I don't think I've ever played a game in which water actually REFRACTS LIGHT.\n\nThe sound and music is excellent as well. The voice acting is very well done, and the sound effects are excellent, complete with echoes in large areas. The music ranges from classic Arabian to somewhat anachronistic heavy metal, and it is all quite enjoyable.\n\nAnd did I mention the world is completely seamless? I didn't experience a single loading time besides a short one before starting a new game or loading a saved one.\n\nThe Bad\n\nThere is one thing that must be noted: THERE IS NO SAVE ANYWHERE FEATURE! The Sands of Time is easier than its predecessors, though that's not saying much. A quicksave feature would be welcomed with open arms, especially in a later level in which you lose the Dagger.\n\nAnd did I mention that it's easier, but that's not saying much? Many people think this game is easy, but I found it to be quite a challenge. Combat can be extremely difficult, and certain acrobatic sequences are exercises in frustration.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nPrince of Persia: The Sands of Time is an excellent game that will keep you engaged until the end. I highly recommend that you get this game."
