        "text": "The early 2010's craze of remastering of PS2 games brought about its fair share of critics, but I was fully on-board with playing some of my favourites in HD. I spent hours upon hours going through the God of Wars, Jaks and Ratchets of the world and having a blast. When Ubisoft released the Prince of Persia Trilogy in 2010, I snatched the games up and gave The Sands of Time a spin. It was fun and all, but it very much did not click with me, so I'd decided to take a break from the game and get back to it eventually. \"Eventually\" came about a decade later, when last year, I tried getting back into the game once more (thanks to the PS3 store closure announcement), but unfortunately once again bounced off of it.\n\nIt made no sense, this highly-regarded game, made amongst some of my favourite games, was just not clicking for me. I decided to give it one last try, but this time on the PC, and holy moly did the game click. I figured out that the reason I kept bouncing off of the game was the PS3 port of the game that butchered two of the game's core pillars, movement and atmosphere. Upon playing the game on PC, everything felt so smooth, and the dialogue for some reason did not sound like it was being recorded through a toilet at the other end of the building.\n\nI'm jumping a little ahead of myself, but I just want to spend a bit of time just acknowledging the run Ubisoft had in the early 2000's. I played Beyond Good and Evil last year (apparently almost to the date, 26th of June 2021) and absolutely fell in love with it. A year removed from playing it, it still stands in my list of best PS2 games. They also had Rayman 2 and 3, and the earlier Splinter Cell games, none of which I have played yet, but all with their own claim to fame and renown. It's amazing how many good games they had at the time, and how few of their current games appeal to me.\n\nNot So Fresh Prince of Persia\n\nAnyways, back to The Sands of Time. It's Ubi's first attempt at a Prince of Persia game and had an Aladdin vibe instead of a man-in-white-shirt-and-pants vibe from the original Apple II game. Set in the 9th century, you control the king of Persia's son (hence the game's name) during a visit to the Sultan of Azad after plundering and murdering almost everyone at the palace of India's Maharajah (as one does). Things go awry and you've got the story of a classic folk tale from One Thousand and One Nights. This is all narrated to you throughout the game by the Prince (voiced by Yuri Lowenthal aka Insomniac's Spider-Man), further helping this folk tale feel.\n\nSo, as I mentioned above, one of the game's pillars is its atmosphere, and Sands of Time goes hard on atmosphere. I use the word atmosphere to encompass everything from the way the game looks and sounds to how the game feels. This twenty year old game still looks gorgeous with its stylised art style. Comparing the visuals of the remake with the ones here, I find the original has more character compared to the remake. Though of course, a) this might be nostalgia speaking and b) the remake's being re-worked and is probably not out for a long while. As with other games of the time, the pre-rendered cutscenes unfortunately do not hold up extremely well, but I love me some early 2000's game CGI.\n\nWe're reaching a point where some users here are younger than games that actually look good\n\nThe soundtrack matches the game's visuals and delivers a Middle Eastern sound with a hint of modern western rock music instruments here and there. This sound is also used for gameplay elements like healing or finding a secret area, once again, adding to the atmosphere.\n\nI've made it this far without talking about the gameplay, but going back to the pillars of the game, movement isn't just part of the game, it is the game, and it feels so damn good. With Prince of Persia being the series that eventually led to Assassin's Creed, the Prince is extremely agile and can get around almost anything. The game essentially treats each area as a platforming puzzle, and there's something so satisfying about solving that puzzle. One of the ways you'll be moving around is running across and up walls. You can then jump at the end of one of these wall-runs, onto a pole that you swing off of to land on a ledge you hang of off. I can go on forever, but the game has so many combinations of these and it never gets stale. It even blew my mind by being the only game that I know of that uses wall-jumps to descend a high platform. It does so much with its parkour moves that I kept just wanting to do the next platforming section.\n\nIn between these platforming sections, the game has early Assassin's Creed-style combat, with the face buttons attacking and the left stick targeting your enemy. You can also parry/counter an enemy's attack, which the game doesn't necessarily expect you to do, but is a valid way of going about combat (amongst a few other ways). Also, once you knock down an enemy, you have to kill them with a dagger to the heart vampire-style. The combat's pretty fun, but almost all combat sections have way too many enemies. I'm talking double digits. It's my one gripe with the gameplay. Still, the core combat gameplay is good, and the platforming sections more than make up for it.\n\nWith how long the combat encounters are in the game, this is what the Prince should've looked like half an hour in\n\nIf you're wondering how the Sands of Time factor into the game, it's what's used to explain another big part of the game, rewinding time. Using the aforementioned heart-stabbing dagger, you can rewind time up to ten seconds. This is such a useful mechanic that I'll be wanting a rewind feature in all games I'm playing from now on. It acts as a cool story device and an undo feature for the game. Genius! Many a jumps and unblocked attacks were undone with this mechanic. Still, despite it being a core mechanic, you can go through the game (or at least most of the game) without using it even once. There's even a trophy/achievement for using it under 20 times.\n\nOne final gameplay element I'd like to highlight is the AI companion. For a game from 2003, it does the job really well. Your partner, Farah (whose name is mispronounced throughout the game), helps you with puzzles and with combat, and has great banter with the Prince. She does sadly cause fail-states if she dies, but it's something that happened three or four times during my playthrough. The idea of the AI companion throughout the journey was ahead of its time and was replicated a bunch in later years (e.g. Uncharted, The Last of Us and so on). Obviously POP isn't the first to do it, but it does it surprisingly well.\n\nYou know Farah, we really are Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time\n\nIf I were to use a word to describe the game, it'd be well-realised. Everything feels like it was put there for a reason. The world feels like an actual world that you interact with. Poles you swing on bounce up and down as you swing on them, bridges are pressed downwards as you run across them, the Prince's shirt gets tattered throughout the game (and eventually completely ripped off). Your AI partner gasps if you almost fall off a ledge, or perform a long jump. When you die and are out of rewinds, the narrator goes \"No no no, that's not how it happened.\" as you retry from a checkpoint. All of these details add up to this sense of grand adventure that you're going through, that you don't often see in first games in a series.\n\nOverall, The Sands of Time has joined Beyond Good and Evil as a late addition to my favourite PS2 games. It's everything I like about games condensed into a short, easy to digest package (minus those damn endless combat sections). Aside from a few design quirks like getting lost now and then (and the lack of subtitles), it still holds up in 2022 and is absolutely worth a play, even with the remake coming soon. If you haven't played the game, go get the game and play it on PC (not the HD trilogy on PS3). It's even $2 on Steam and Ubisoft's store right now. It took me 11 years to play the first hour of the game on PS3, and five days to finish the game on PC. That should tell you the quality of the PS3 version.\n\nI'm planning to go through the entire series over the next few weeks/months. I'll first be platinuming the game on my PS3 (to make that decade old purchase worth it) and report back on the process. Once I'm done, I'll be moving onto Warrior Within, which I've heard is not as good. Still, I'm really looking forward to going through this series and am glad I'm finally getting around to playing it.\n\nWhat's your favourite Prince of Persia game, and why? Also, the Prince has no name so I'm stuck capitalising the word Prince even though it's technically not a proper noun and it's giving me a existential crisis, what's the correct etiquette on this?\n\nAlso, here's a good watch if you're interested in hearing the game's director, Patrice Désilets (also the director of the first three Assassin's Creed games) talk about the game while it's played, check out this video from Double Fine's Devs Play series:\n\nOkay, so I'm done with my platinum runthrough of the game (and by extension done with the game) and have a few comments.\n\nSo, the platinum runthrough requires you to go through the game while using the rewind feature under 20 times. I was dead set on not using it at all, but had some really frustrating sections and succumbed to using it. It's crazy how much better the game is as a result of the rewind feature. There is absolutely nothing more annoying than the Prince deciding to jump a bit to the left or to the right of where you wanted to, and having to replay a 5 minute encounter as a result of that.\n\nThis also made anything I previously found annoying, super extremely aggravating. This includes the combat. What used to be something that admittedly did get repetitive and annoying very quickly, became five times more annoying, thanks to having to go through it five times due to a checkpoint that's a bit too far back.\n\nThe low framerate on the PS3 also really does not help. The game's a lot harder because of it and what feels like an input lag? There have been times where I could've sworn I timed a jump right only to fall to my death and have to repeat an entire section again.\n\nFinally, I ran into this really random graphical issue of weird lines stretching across the screen. It started out as small gray lines spanning across the entire screen in 3D (the width of the Prince's hands) and eventually because super colourful stretches of screen that flickered. It's really hard to explain, but it was amusing. It did make the game unplayable at points (combined with even lower FPS), but a quick restart of the game made it go away.\n\nOverall, I still really love the game, but I did not love this playthrough of the game. Turns out the game's best played with the use of the mechanics it was designed for. Once again, I'd advise playing the game on PC if you have the option.\n\nI'll be heading on to Warrior Within in a few days and hopefully enjoying it as much as I did my first run of this game. Will make an LTTP when I'm done with it. 1/5 through my Prince of Persia journey.\n\nLoved sands of time. One of my favourite games ever. You can see it's influence in many games to this day.\n\nHated that lift section. Fucks sake - that shit was so unnecessary and frustrating.\n\nI'd heard about the lift section and found it not too tough thankfully. Wall jump attack was my friend. Playing in high frame rate also helped a bunch because going through the PS3 version right now is a lot harder.\n\nI still can't find a way to get my Xbox controller to map properly to the PC version. It just doesn't want to happen, and it eats me up inside.\n\nYes, I've read that PCGamingWiki front to back.\n\nI played it with a PS4 controller through Steam's controller configuration thing. Here's a thing that might help, hold the button you'd like to assign and tap the respective box in the control configuration screen. For some reason double clicking always set the click as the button to assign to.\n\nWas the first time I realised as a kid that video games could have meaningful and enjoyable stories. I was genuinely saddened by the ending. A wonderfully designed game, perfect music and fascinating level/world design. One of the GOATs.\n\nThe series kind of took a nosedive for me after this; didn't care for the edgy Gothcore sequels or the vapid cel-shaded reboot. Neither touched the majesty of SoT.\n\nFor me it's the little touches. Like the narration, or the very catchy little jingle whenever you drink water.\n\nExactly! It holds up super well because of everything you mentioned. It's a very well-made game that had a proper vision, and it came out at the right time before games got too big and just at the point where technology could do the idea justice.\n\nJust to answer the poll: my favorite is Sands of Time but I do think all three games in the trilogy have their own excellent hook.\n\nWarrior Within had these exceptional Dahaka chase sequences, while Two Thrones is the one that polished the gameplay the most adding a lot of neat little things.\n\nPrince of Persia 2008 is terribad and I won't take seriously anyone singling its praises, on the other hand.\n\nI'm hoping I enjoy the rest of the series. I've heard mixed things about all the games after this one, so I'm tempering my expectations.\n\nIt is definitely in my top 10 favorite games of all time.. I replied it so many times that I've lost counts.\n\nI hope they manage to release the Remake sometime next year to celebrate the 20th anniversary.\n\nSuch a beautiful magical game, the atmosphere still gives me chills remembering it.\n\nI'm gonna play the remake when it's out but I honestly don't know if it'll do the original justice. It might have more QoL improvements and look more technically impressive, but I don't know if it'll have the same heart this one does.\n\nI actually just started replaying this on Thursday, I never beat it back on PS2, and the remake is either dead or now years further away.\n\nMy main memories of it were constantly slow mo vaulting over dudes in combat segments, and yep, that's actually more a thing than I recalled.\n\nWhile the combat gives me pause, the rest of the package is so quietly confident.\n\nThe ease of platforming moves without the autopilot features this style of platforming succumbed to, the charming narration, forward thinking of the sands rewind mechanic for its time.\n\nOnly a few segments beyond where Farah starts accompanying you right now.\n\nShout outs to the voice over for the palace guard in that bloomin' defense activation puzzle, some gruff east ender with the dial turned up to max volume, it's so bad/obnoxious it wraps around to hilarious, \"FIIIINK AH-HED!\"\n\nI absolutely loved that guy's voice acting. It's so freaking over the top and it's some of the earliest voice acting you get in the game. He's definitely up there in best characters with less than 5 minutes of screen time.\n\nHey, this game is on my backlog! (well, a ton of games are, but I have a much shorter list of games I will play 'next', and it's on it as well)\n\nGlad to see someone is on the same wave length. I look forward to replaying it soonish.\n\nI really miss this series. I really wish Ubisoft would take a break from making assassin's creed games and sexually assaulting their employees to greenlight a new entry in it. Can you imagine the environments done in today's graphics? I would kill to have a GoW 2018 tier POP game (with platforming, of course).\n\nI'd love to see a new interpretation of the series, but I'm good with the games that are out (only because I haven't played them yet haha). Hopefully the remake reinvigorates interest in the series.\n\nHonestly, one of the most underrated games of all time. Sands of Time pretty much codified the modern AAA action game but it seems to be mostly forgotten by the broader gaming community.\n\nYeah, you don't hear about it much anymore. POP as a series isn't talked about too much these days as far as I can see. We are getting games inspired it nowadays tho, like Raji.\n\nWorst thing about this game is that there are no subtitles and the voices are -impossible- to hear on the Steam version\n\nThey're even more impossible on the PS3 version. It's so damn bad.\n\nSands of time was the best PoP game. It is a shame Ubisoft is only caring about the Assassins Creed franchise as of now. I really liked the Prince here, he was pretty self ironic and brash. Farah was also a cool addition. Liked the time mechanic and the puzzles. Also that you could unlock the original PoP game.\n\nWhoa! Don't think I knew about that original PoP thing. Might just give it a go when I'm done with the rest of the series. Again, so much love put into the game and the series, you can't help but like the game."
