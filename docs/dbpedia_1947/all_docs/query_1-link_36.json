The Division is by far the longest I've ever worked on a single project and I thought it would be good to publish something. This is the project I'm most proud to be on. It's by far the best engine I've ever worked with, and it's a position where my work is actually visible to the players. So here's just a taste of some of the work that I've helped to make possible.\n\nDuring production I produced some internal training videos and got to be part of the engine reveal video."
