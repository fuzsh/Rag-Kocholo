        "text": "PlayStation 2 is one of the most famous video game consoles in the world. It won’t be far-fetched to say that of all the consoles in the history of video games, Sony’s PlayStation 2, known as PS2 has recorded the most success. They sold approximately 155 million units across the globe. Their longevity was amazing, considering the fact that the first set of units came out early 2000 and they produced the last set about a decade after in 2012.\n\nThe console’s extraordinary success can be attributed to certain factors. They took advantage of the momentum from the first PlayStation, which successfully captured the adult game market. Even though Sega Dreamcast started 128-bit generation before them, the PS2 was closely behind them and even had better hardware capability.\n\nIn addition, it was actually the first game to introduce DVD media, which turned out to be a great marketing idea considering the fact that it was introduced at a time when a lot of families used DVDs – Sony gave buyers an opportunity to enjoy their movies and game in one device. With the inclusion of the DVD device, adults could now have consoles in their sitting rooms, unlike when they had to tuck it away in the basement or in the kid’s room.\n\nThe “Emotion Engine” was one of the biggest marketing points in the early days of the PS2. This was the nickname given to the central processor of the console. It was a powerful and innovative design, specially optimized for 3D gaming. Just like the PlayStation, Sony put a lot of effort into making it friendly for third-party designers.\n\nThat’s not to say a console is only about marketing and hardware. When it comes down to it, its game line-up is out of this world and the PS2 with its library of more than 1,800 original titles will probably be considered the strongest in the history of gaming. Almost all the genres have at least one or two hit tittles. Although the titles launched in 2000 were just average, 2001 came with some hit titles that put the PS2 at the top of the market: Gran Turismo 3, Grand Theft Auto 3, Crash Bandicoot, Final Fantasy X, A-Spec, Jak and Daxter, Metal Gear Solid 2: And the biggest of them all is The Wrath of Cortex.\n\nAlthough they were not really part of the plan when they launched the console, the inclusion of the Firewire ports and USB turned out great. The Rock Band series and the Guitar Hero also turned out to be huge sellers. Although devices such as the Eye Toy were more a niche market than anything, they actually laid the foundation for other motion-controlled and camera-based systems for the next consoles released.\n\nIn the course of its lifetime, the PS2 witnessed the release of different form factors, but the “slim” and “fat” cases are the two major variants. The slim case was first released in 2004, with a lower profile and a hard drive expansion bay that weighed significantly less. You should note that not all games require an expansion hard drive and the Final Fantasy XI is one game that uses it."
