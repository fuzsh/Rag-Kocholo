        "text": "Through the course of the game, you play two different characters: the daring and powerful Sphinx, and the timid yet immortal mummy. Even though your characters start out in different locations and have different goals, their stories eventually intertwine, and each characters progress ultimately becomes dependent upon the others. The game mechanics are a bit different from some other action adventures with platforming elements. For example, both Sphinx and the mummy can jump after walking off a high cliff or ledge- something that usually means instant death in other games (like The Hobbit). In fact, the ability to jump from mid-air is required in order to perform some of the longer jumps (for both characters), beginning about halfway through the game. Varied gameplay. The kind of tasks and skills involved in playing Sphinx vs. the mummy are so different that its almost like youre getting two games in one. Additionally, there are a number of optional minigames where you can gain rewards for doing very well and develop skills youll need in order to finish the game. Youre presented with a somewhat open-ended gameworld and a number of fast-travel options to get from place to place. The game and levels are designed in such a way that the game progresses as a direct result of your characters developing new skills, rather than simply ushering you into a new area. Early on in your adventures youll notice plenty of inviting ledges, platforms, and doors that you just cant seem to be able to reach. Just take note of these places and return when youre better equipped for the job. You can only save your game at various save statues scattered around. When playing as Sphinx youll often (but not always) find save statues located near important or dangerous areas, however when playing as the mummy there is only ONE save statue, which is located in the room where he starts each level. The reasoning behind this, I guess, is that the mummy is immortal and his game cannot end. The problem is, people who need to go to work, school, or church have no place to save their game if theyre in the middle of a mummy level, and the levels can sometimes take up to an hour to complete. Your only option is to either pause the game and leave your GameCube on until you are able to play again or forfeit and later restart the entire level over from the beginning. That sucks."
