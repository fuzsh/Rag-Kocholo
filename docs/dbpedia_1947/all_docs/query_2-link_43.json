For example, I don't know what Professor Layton game I am voting on.\n\nPosted by\n\nStephen\n\non:\n\n@Stephen\n\nDon't worry, I'm posting text format for each individual match up (see Round One: Green Hill Zone). This thread is just for discussing the tournament as a whole.\n\nPosted by\n\nJargon\n\non:\n\n@Jargon\n\nAh okay. I thought this was the thread where we voted.\n\nEDIT: Some interesting match-ups but I feel like the Liberty City bracket is so stacked whatever wins that will take it all. The only games I see as having a chance at stopping it are RE4, Chrono Trigger, and FF6.\n\nPosted by\n\nStephen\n\non: Edited:\n\nHonestly surprised that Castlevania: Symphony of the Night wasn't in the Liberty City bracket!\n\nThat said, if Chrono Trigger doesn't win it all... I don't want to live on this planet anymore!\n\nPosted by\n\nGameDadGrant\n\non:\n\n@GameDadGrant\n\nExactly.. but what are you going to do with SCII and FFVI right off the bat????\n\nPosted by\n\nSmerd\n\non:\n\n@Stephen\n\nI would be very surprised if that was the case, but we'll see.\n\n@GameDadGrant\n\nYea, it seems like games that old don't show up as high on Gamerankings, generally speaking. Makes OoT and Gran Turismo being so high up all the more impressive.\n\nPosted by\n\nJargon\n\non: Edited:\n\n@Smerd\n\nFighting game fan here. Choice is easy for me! The tougher one will be RE2 vs. The Sands of Time. I love both of those games.\n\n@Jargon\n\nHmm, might be too old? Oh well. Chrono Trigger FTW, anyway. At least, IMHO.\n\nPosted by\n\nGameDadGrant\n\non:\n\n@GameDadGrant\n\nYou can go vote now!\n\nPosted by\n\nDrFinkelstein\n\non:\n\nI'm missing something here as I'm new to the Challogne site.... I don't know how to vote and I'm signed in and everything..\n\nPosted by\n\nSmerd\n\non:\n\n@GameDadGrant\n\nJust call Chrono Trigger the winner and be done with it all?\n\nWhich reminds me I need to finish that DS remake one of these days... it's in my pile of carts somewhere...\n\nPosted by\n\ndeathly_hallows\n\non:\n\nYeah, the Professor Layton games were published by Nintendo outside of Japan, but they don't own the company that makes them so they're still pretty much third-party. Conker's Bad Fur Day is a bit of a tough one to classify though since Nintendo owned Rare when that was made, even if they didn't publish that particular game and Rare did it themselves. Though they didn't wholly own Rare, just the majority share, earning it the label of \"second party\" which I was never sure if that was official or just something fans created to classify them. So I guess it could be argued either way.\n\nPosted by\n\nMop it up\n\non:\n\nHow did I know you'd be the one finding any nits to pick?\n\nYea, I messed up with Layton. Forgot they were published by Nintendo here. If we're going to include games like that then Dragon Quest 9 and Lego City: Undercover should have been in the field. Oh well.\n\nPosted by\n\nJargon\n\non:\n\nNo Murray State or Colorado State? What a sham of a selection committee! Oh, wrong brackets...\n\nPosted by\n\nTheOldManFromZelda\n\non:\n\nI know this is maybe too late, but I feel like for the non-Nintendo stuff you should have used our database somehow. Sure, we don't have too many votes for the non-Nintendo games, but I think it would reflect our tastes more than Gamerankings aka a bunch of FPS and GTA games. Stuff like The Walking Dead, Valkyria Chronicles, Batman: Arkham City and Portal 2 aren't as high up on GR but are very loved here.\n\nPosted by\n\nZero\n\non:\n\nWhere is Skies of Arcadia?\n\nPosted by\n\nTriforceBun\n\non:\n\n@Zero\n\nThere's just not enough votes to really say they reflect the site's tastes at all.\n\nAlso Batman: Arkham City actually was ranked high enough on Gamerankings to be included, but it presented a weird situation since it's available on Nintendo platforms but not enough people have voted on it for it to get in as a third party game on a Nintendo system. I just made the call to exclude it.\n\n@TriforceBun\n\nJust missed the cut.\n\nPosted by\n\nJargon\n\non: Edited:\n\n@Jargon Well I guess it's nice to be known for something, though I hope no one sees it as a bad thing. :)\n\nPosted by\n\nMop it up\n\non:\n\n@Jargon Well, there aren't enough votes but... you can still sort of get a sense of what people around here tend to talk about most when it comes to 3rd party games. I dunno. I just kind of feel like FPS and GTA sort of don't really reflect people's tastes here much at all.\n\nBut looking closer I see that Portal 2 is on your list, and that was the main game that felt like it was missing, since everyone here LOVES it.\n\nPosted by\n\nZero\n\non:\n\n@Zero\n\nYea, there's definitely limitations but I really like to tie the seedings to some source I can point to so that my own discretion isn't involved. I do think this will be interesting though because I imagine the GTA games aren't going to live up to their seeding and upsets are always fun. Interestingly, there's only actually 2 FPS's on the list: Halo and Bioshock, and I do think both of those would be in the field even if I were just choosing games based on my own impressions of the community's tastes.\n\nPosted by\n\nJargon\n\non:"
