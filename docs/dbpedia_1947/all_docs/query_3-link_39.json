        "text": "ShareCompleted\n\nChronoja\n\n80%PC\n\n6h 36m Played\n\nComing to The Forgotten Sands long after its release with the knowledge that at this point in time it's currently the last released Prince of Persia game from Ubisoft I was expecting it to be something terrible, something worthy of effectively killing off the franchise. Thankfully this notion was misplaced as The Forgotten Sands turned out to be anything but terrible, to the point where I feel it's an absolute shame that the series died at this point where it had so much potential.\n\nIt is a continuation or entry in the main Ubisoft series, that is comprised of The Sands of Time, Warrior Within and The Two Thrones, it's not a sequel as it takes place between Sands of Time and Warrior Within but is devoid of any other characters you'd be familiar with except the Prince himself. Right from the outset though you'll be aware of many large changes to the game compared to the other games in the series, mostly coming from what seems like an entirely new engine the games are built on. These little changes are apparent in the controls, a lot of it has been streamlined and while it controls mostly the same there's enough differences that if you play the series back to back or chronologically you're likely going to be making some input errors simply through muscle memory.\n\nThat's not to say this is a bad thing, right from the beginning my gut feeling had me thinking this was going to be a watered down, casualised PoP game, it's something that comes through not only in the controls but in the way the game animates things, wall running for example feels incredibly slow and forgiving and the camera is often very determined to keep you focused on the way forward in that cinematic style. Those expectations were readily dashed as the game progressed, the game continues to evolve throughout its runtime, introducing and expanding then combining new mechanics in new and fresh ways, often times offering a tricky amount of challenge that elevates it above being a simple casualised cinematic game. It can't be understated how much fun the way the powers and platforming provide to the game while simultaneously being presented as beautifully as possible, if Ubisoft were tripping over themselves to reach that \"cinematic\" level gameplay you could point to this game as an example of when they achieved it.\n\nI'm saying cinematic a lot here, part of that is just because I thought the game was gorgeous looking, even being from 2010, with high quality textures enabled it's one of the best looking games I can think of from that time and it still holds up.\n\nA few things aren't quite right, the Prince himself is looking a bit odd, not the lithe, agile character from previous games, now a hulking Hollywood type like Chris Hemsworth or something. And while the animation is some of the best I've ever seen, the prince stuttering his steps to match distances etc. some animations feel like they were shoehorned to fit their actions, jumping for example feels extremely lofty and inhuman for the arc it takes. These aren't big issues, just little things that stand out.\n\nAlso it needs to be mentioned but the combat is some of the best, certainly the best of the series. No more endless defending and jump slashing endlessly, here combat is more reminiscent of Batman: Arkham Asylum. You will encounter hordes of enemies but instead of hitting them 1 by 1 like Batman: AA, your sword will hit multiple enemies in the slash arc. The result is an incredibly satisfying combat experience as you hack down huge hordes of enemies while deftly trying to dodge out of harms way. It leans on the easy side, but there's enough nuance, like dodging into or hitting enemies will stunt their attacks, but you can get hit if you get complacent. At all points you know any mistake is your own, well, usually, there is a degree of targetting, it's subtle and only really becomes a problem when you need to attack 1 enemy in particular, usually enemy spawners, but for the most part the combat is a glorious display of learned lessons and implementation.\n\nAnd while the game is fairly linear progression wise there's light RPG mechanics that let you advance the combat potential of the Prince throughout the game. It's not super involved, it's not extraneous, it's just a nice addition to the game and something they've factored wonderfully into the story of the game.\n\nSo yeah, overall I consider Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands as kind of hidden gem. It exists long after the base trilogy, comes after the ill-fated, oft-remembered 2008 cel-shaded reboot, so this game often gets overlooked and not talked about much at all, and that's unfortunate because like I said, it's the culmination of Ubisoft perfecting that cinematic formula without sacrificing much in way of gameplay.\n\nAbsolutely worth a play even if you skip the rest of the series.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nShiara\n\n70%PlayStation 3\n\nThis was a fun throwback to Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. The characters, storyline, and atmosphere were very reminiscent of sands of time. The prince was more like the prince in that game rather than its two sequels, where he got 'darker.' The ending is a bit weak.\n\nGameplay was fun and mostly smooth. Overall the game was a bit too easy. There was very little exploration, even when it came to solving puzzles. Forced camera angles pretty much showed you exactly where you needed to go for the whole game. In fact the camera is my largest complaint about the game. At the beginning one of the first controls it tells you is how to move the camera angle, but then for 85% of the game, including all the platforming, it's at forced angles. In addition to this, there are a few points in the game where the angle, or a sudden change in angle screw up the platforming.\n\nAnother complaint is that you can only have one save game at a time, and when you start the options are just continue, or new game (new game overwrites the continue). It doesn't even tell you how long you've been playing on that save.\n\nThere is an additional challenge mode but it's nothing special. There's two types, one puts you up against 8 waves of enemies to see if you can survive and see what your final time is. The second is just a time trial where you fight a horde of enemies and try to kill them all before the timer runs out. Neither mode seems to save your best time, so you can't even really compete against yourself."
