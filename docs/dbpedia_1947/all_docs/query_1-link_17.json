I guess I'm just looking for answers from those of you that have played it. Please don't spoil any plot points if possible thanks [/quote]\n\nThe dialogue and pacing was ridiculous. Like that first boss fight on the Pirate ship - you're still struggling with the new mechanics and they interrupt it mid-point so the Prince can yell \"You bitch!\". Come on.\n\nPlus wait till you get to the castle's center hallway. There's something to be said for linear level development when appropriate.\n\nThrow in glitchiness and the game just feels like a step backwards from the first - IE it's good, but not great. However there are a few action segments in that game that are badass - you'll know what I mean when they happen.\n\nI liked the first one... until I got stuck in this room and either couldn't figure out which direction to swing towards, or the controller wouldn't allow me to swing the direction I was supposed to go in. I must have been 66-70% done and just quit it, youtubed the ending and moved on. Popped WW in and was immediately turned off that it was so combat and weapon based rather than physical puzzle solving (like the 1st one and ICO type games) which is what drew me in, in the first place.\n\nI'm sure it's not so bad, but to go in with the mindset you're expecting from the 1st, it was disappointing. I might try the next PoP game if they make one, but I had T2T and never bothered playing it. (Just sent it out through goozex today). There's way too many quality games I have yet to play to spend time on *decent* fillers.\n\nI don't think WW sucks. Actually WW is my favorite. SOT is 2nd. And TT is my least favorite.\n\nThat being said I admit that when I first started playing WW back in the day I hated it because it was so different from SOT and it wasn't at all what I expected. When I stopped focusing on what WW wasn't (SOT ) and just enjoyed it for what it actually was I realized it has a great story and fun game mechanics. After playing WW, I found that I actually liked WW better than SOT because I think WW's story is better and I liked the fighting system better (SOT is just button mashing).\n\nIMO the 2 biggest obstacles to enjoying WW is the prince's new look which makes him look like a crazed crack addict and the neverending Godsmack song. If you can get past those 2 things, then I don't see any other reason why you wouldn't be able to enjoy the rest of the game.\n\nI'm coming in a little late, but that shouldn't matter. This thread was ing made for me. I've ranted and raved a few times on here about WW, and always joked that I should save it in Word to save myself the time. I never did, unfortunately - and you're getting The Somewhat Shorter than the Long Version.\n\nGraphics|\n\nNot a whole lot of problems here. Except for the hair. Look at the hair on the Empress. What the ?\n\nCombat|\n\nToo ing much! Sands of Time was a platformer first - fighting was second. Warrior Within tried to rectify the problems with Sands of Time's combat, and it did only a mediocre job. For all the fancy new moves you got, very few of them were really useful - unless it was a 1v1, you were always better off jumping over enemies and cutting them up in the air. A shame, since WW doubled the amount of god-damn combat! Also, what was with the ten billion weapons? I checked through the manual ten times, and never got a real explanation for what the weapons' stats meant.\n\nCombat Continued|\n\nJesus Christ, was that shit ever annoying. Those exploding dogs, for example: an enemy that actually punishes you for killing them. The only safe way I found to kill them was to land the finishing blow and run full-speed off the edge of whatever platform I was on.\n\nThen there are the bosses. them. I remember reading an interview in EGM post-SoT wherein Ubi Montreal lamented that they could not include all the bosses they wanted to. Thank ing God, because WW's bosses were abysmal. I'm speaking specifically of the \"Juggernaut\" guy. The first time you fight him - hey, this is kinda neat, climbing over him like this. The second time? Well, hey, I'm travelling through time - I guess I can run into you twice. The third time? Okay, ing die. The fourth time? Shit, his health bar is three times as big! The fifth time? Ooh, the fifth time, he got a new attack: he threw exploding dogs at you like grenades. So yeah, that guy.\n\nCharacters|\n\nProbably the biggest complaint everyone has. The Prince has no actual personality this time around - sorry, but \"brooding\" is not a personality. Then there's Kaileena, the new \"love interest\". The new, bland, idiotic, kinda freakish looking love interest. I clapped when\n\nshe died in WW. Then I was mad when\n\nI found out she survived according to official canon. Then I clapped again when\n\nshe died in Two Thrones for real. She still sucked as a narrator, though\n\n. I know - rate her on her own merits, not relative to Farah (about whom I have a few complaints myself). Thing is, she has no merits of her own. The less that's said about her, the better.\n\nOh, and masochistic vampires? I think someone at Ubi has a fetish.\n\nthe deal with WW isn't that it's a bad game. Matter of fact the general consensus is that it's a good game in spite of the changes. In SoT which was brilliance entirely thru the combat was weak. It was more of an after thought. It was fun but you rarely got to use it. The game was more focused on platforming. I remember people being confused about the boss it was 'too easy' these are people who don't get the real boss is doing the last level without your sword.\n\nThe problem with WW is that they decided to up the combat. Good idea in principle but it was executed poorly and you end up fighting ALL the time. That and too much 'time' themes. PA summed it best. In spite of this the game managed to keep the excellent platforming that made SoT great hence the high scores.\n\n[quote name='coolsteel']Terrible level layout, I once spent an hour going in one direction doing stuff that way and got stuck, I finally was desperate enough to look it up on gamefaqs and found out I completely wasn't supposed to do anything in that area until later. That one hundred percent never happened in the first game. That and the prince trying to act hardcore so much got old. He was a pretty funny guy in the first game.[/quote]\n\nWell I only played 2-3 hours of WW. I'll start it over again after I finish Paper Mario but the direction SoT was great. I did miss the gameboy unlockable thingy but aside from that I never got lost always knew where I was going. The prince himself was a cheeky son of a gun. Even dying was amusing. \"No no .. that's not how it happened\"\n\ni remeber reading an article that was talking about SoT saying unlike most games it wanted you to finish. I think it was Sirlin. matter of fact I found it.\n\nHere\n\nIt also includes the ultimate player-friendly feature: the ability to rewind time! If you miss a jump or get hit by an enemy, just rewind time to before that happened and try again. You need sand to power this time-rewind, but you can get it easily from almost any enemy. The Prince of Persia design team wants you to succeed. They are rooting for you every step of the way. While some gamers thought this was “too much hand holding,” I think the majority of the audience found it “accessible and inviting.”\n\nI don't know about TT but as lttle as I've ventured into WW I'm a little lost that's whY it's on the backburner until I get TT then I 'll just go thru 'em both."
