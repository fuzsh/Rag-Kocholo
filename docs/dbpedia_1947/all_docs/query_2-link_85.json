        "text": "Overview\n\nTrophies were first added to PlayStation 3 games in 2008 as an achievement system. Overcoming various challenges in a game will reward bronze, silver, and gold trophies, and many games also reward a special platinum trophy for collecting all of these.\n\nWhen I start a new PlayStation game I usually go to PSNProfiles and look for a platinum trophy guide to decide if I want to try to add another to my collection. These are not just walkthroughs, each game has a difficulty score, an estimated time to get the platinum, and many individual trophies have labels to inform players about potential hiccups, such as online play being required, or there being something that you can permanently miss in a playthrough. I’ve always liked looking at these guides, even for games I have no interest in playing, just to see how hard it is, or what kind of challenges are involved. As a statistics nerd I wanted to chart that information.\n\nFor this project I gathered data from 3,145 guides on PSNProfiles, and not just games with platinum trophies. Games without platinum trophies tend to be digital-only, shorter, and smaller in scope. Studying them can offer more insight into game difficulty and length so I wanted to include them too. There are some other websites with trophy guides but I stuck with PSNProfiles for this information since it had everything I needed on one page and I think it has more trophy guides than anywhere else. This project looks at:\n\nRelease Date: This is the date the game first released in any region, for any system.\n\nSystem: Games can count for multiple systems from among the PS3, PS4, PS5, PSV, PSVR, and PSVR2.\n\nDifficulty: Every guide on PSNProfiles has a difficulty rating from 1-10. Guide writers tend to listen to feedback and change difficulty ratings if people don’t agree with them, and as you’ll see later these seem to be distributed pretty reasonably.\n\nHours: How long the guide writer thinks it will take to collect all the trophies. Users on PSNProfiles often give feedback about this.\n\nOnline Required: The bane of many trophy collectors are trophies that require playing online. Servers can quickly become ghost towns for any game without a huge audience, or be taken offline completely. I did not include games where you obtain trophies either online or by playing local co-op.\n\nMissables Included: Missables are trophies that have to be collected before progressing past a certain point in a game or else they are unavailable until playing through a game again, or a previous save file is loaded. Trophy hunters have to keep a careful eye on these.\n\nPlatinum Acquisition Rate: What percent of users on PSNProfiles who have played the game have obtained the platinum trophy. These are much larger than the overall platinum acquisition rate of all players, since people who use PSNProfiles love to collect trophies. I decided to use this metric since the overall platinum rates are so often less than 1%, these larger numbers give us more room to compare.\n\nDistribution of Difficulty Scores\n\nHere we can see the distribution of difficulty scores on PSNProfiles has a nice ramp up and then ramp down in frequency, with the hardest games being the rarest. The shorter, simpler games without platinum trophies are more weighed toward lower difficulties.\n\nDifficulty by Year and System\n\nIt’s often observed that games got a lot easier starting with the 7th generation (the one with the PlayStation 3), unfortunately we don’t have the PlayStation 2 to compare with, but game difficulty does seem to have dropped over time. I’m not sure why 2023 had a sudden increase. I didn’t expect virtual reality games to be markedly more difficult, though the numbers are a bit less reliable with fewer games overall.\n\nI had to exclude a few no platinum trophy years and PSVR2 due there not being a sufficient sample size.\n\nThere are games from 2007, before trophies were implemented, because a few games patched in support for trophies after release.\n\nHours to Acquire All Trophies by Year and System\n\nIt’s easier to see in the system chart, but the time required to get a platinum trophy has gone down a bit over time. For games without a platinum it’s a bit less clear. Despite being more difficult on average, VR games take a lot less time.\n\nThere weren’t a lot of guides for 2019 games without a platinum trophy, meaning Siralim 3’s 600 hours to acquire all trophies severely altered the average.\n\nHours to Acquire All Trophies by Difficulty\n\nGetting a platinum trophy takes longer the harder a game is, which is exactly what you would expect if the difficulties ratings were pretty accurate. Getting all of the trophies in no-platinum games is a bit less consistent, 4-difficulty games seeing a big jump, and then the 9s and 10s being much more time intensive than 8s.\n\nPlatinum Trophy Acquisition Rates by Hours Required and Difficulty\n\nThese two graphs show us exactly what we would expect: the harder or longer a game is, the fewer people will get the platinum trophy. The maximum number of hours you can enter on a PSNProfiles trophy guide is 999, and there are a few games that can potentially take longer than that. Take a look at the Notable Games section for more on them.\n\nPlatinum Trophy Acquisition Rates by System\n\nThis is another showcase of how games have gotten easier over time, with platinum trophies being more than twice as common among PlayStation 5 games than PlayStation 3. There wasn’t a lot of information for PlayStation VR2 games, so this could change over time, but it’s interesting that they seem to have harder platinum trophies than the original PlayStation VR.\n\nHow Online Requirements and Missables Factor Into Trophies\n\nThis might be a lot to take in, but the more saturated colors indicate games without a platinum trophy, while the paler colors are those with a platinum. Blue is for online games, red is for games with missable trophies.\n\nGames without platinum trophies tend to require online services less often, as well as feature missables less often. The overall trend seems to be fewer of either kind of trophy over time.\n\nOnline play requirements become more common the harder a game is, with an especially large jump between 9 and 10. Missables, however, seem to have very little correlation with difficulty, bouncing up and down.\n\nHere we see that the games with the hardest and rarest platinum trophies (towards the left), are much more likely to have some kind of online component. Winning hundreds of matches online can be a grueling task that not many want to go through. Missables on the other hand seem to become a bit rarer as platinum trophy rates go down, and I’m not sure why.\n\nNotable Games\n\nIt’s always fun to look at the outliers with a study like this. These three games take more than the maximum 999 hours a guide can display:\n\nDiablo II: Resurrected – There is a trophy for reaching level 99 with a hardcore character, meaning you can’t die once. This is one of the most ridiculous trophies I’ve ever seen, it will take hundreds of hours of carefully grinding the same one or two bosses to get this, and you’ll have to hope you never lose your character due to lag. You’ll need a team of selfless people readying bosses for you to make this more plausible.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV – This MMORPG platinum requires players to beat each of the four expansions, do the raids on savage difficulty, complete lot of hunts and FATEs, collect Triple Triad cards, craft many items, and gather many materials.\n\nFortnite – This is actually for non-battle royale part of the game, the “Save the World” mode. The platinum involves lots of grind, including saving thousands of survivors, buildings thousands of structures, and killing thousands of monsters.\n\nFour games with guides in this study had impossible platinum trophies. PSNProfiles generally removes people that use cheating devices to get these, so you still may see some people with these online:\n\nBackfirewall – There is a bugged trophy for beating a certain score in a dance competition. This game is less than a year old so there is some hope it can be fixed.\n\nBoundless – There are actually three bugged trophies preventing anyone from getting the platinum. One requires collecting more journals than there are to collect, another requires visiting some kinds of worlds that haven’t been added to the game, and another requires completing more feats than exist in the game. The developer was supposedly working on fixing the trophies three years ago.\n\nDragon Fin Soup – This partly crowdfunded game was supposed to receive a major update, but the developer went silent four years ago without releasing it. The trophies involve collecting pets, crafting items, and catching fish.\n\nGonner 2 – Three years after release it’s unknown what is required to get a “nice combo”. It could be bugged or it could be very obscure.\n\nSeven games without a platinum trophy will likely take over 300 hours to nab every trophy: Deadman’s Cross (300), Warframe (300), Destiny of Spirits (350), Let It Die (350), APB Reloaded (400), Planetside 2 (500), and Siralim (600).\n\nThe game with the highest platinum trophy rate was Quick Mafs, with 99.24%. The games with platinum rates at or below 0.1% are:\n\nNBA 2k16 (0.02%, PS4 version)\n\nThe Finals (0.03%, a very new game as of this writing)\n\nNBA 2k14 (0.04%)\n\nBadland (0.07%)\n\nCrypt of the NecroDancer (0.08%)\n\nFight Night Round 4 (0.09%)\n\nNBA 2K15 (0.1%)\n\nThe game with a difficulty of 1 with the lowest platinum rate is Fight Night Round 4 (0.09%). It’s also listed as taking 10 hours, which seems a bit suspect. Neko Atsume has a difficulty of 1 and is supposed to take 200 hours, yet the platinum rate is 34.19%.\n\nThe fastest 10-difficulty games to complete are apparently Atari Flashback Classics Volume 2 and Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 at 20 hours, while on the other side of the scale Crypt of the NecroDancer is expected to take 900 hours. The 10-difficulty game with the highest platinum rate is Fall Guys at 7.89% (It was 8.05% when I recorded all this information). Fall Guys actually has two distinct trophy sets, this is the one with the current launcher.\n\nSources\n\nPSNProfiles and its guides for most of the game related information.\n\nWikipedia for release dates.\n\nOverview\n\nMore than two years ago I published the Nintendo Game Project, looking at various statistics of all (at the time) 15,000 games on Nintendo platforms. I thought it would be interesting to do the project again, but with Sony games this time. While Sony doesn’t have as long a legacy as Nintendo, it should be interesting in its own right, and I can do some comparisons. Nintendo can be at odds with the rest of the video game industry, while Sony has largely dominated it since the PlayStation.\n\nI have kept my methods the same as before to facilitate comparisons, but let’s go over them. This study includes officially licensed games from the PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, and PlayStation 4. My cutoff date for games was the last day of 2020, so not all PlayStation 4 games are included. I have not included PlayStation Classics, just as I did not include Virtual Console games. Unlike last time I did include games not released in North America, Europe, or Japan.\n\nI combined development studios and publishing companies that were owned by another company into one. For example, Ubisoft Paris and Ubisoft Barcelona are both Ubisoft studios, so they both just count as “Ubisoft”. Ubisoft bought Red Storm Entertainment in 2000, so that company counts as Red Storm Entertainment before they were bought, and as Ubisoft after. Sometimes video game companies are bought by non-video game companies, I ignored these unless that company also owned at least one other video game company. For example, Atlus was bought by Index, which also owned Interchannel, so those companies were counted as Index. I counted a company as owned by another if they owned more than 50% of it, so D3 Publisher counts as Bandai Namco from the date that they acquired most of their stock.\n\nMerged companies I counted as a new company. So Squaresoft and Enix are counted separately from Square Enix. If a company changed their name, I used the most recent. When games were ported, I credited the porting studio, whether that was the original creator or not.\n\nMany games are likely fully or partially developed by uncredited studios in countries with cheaper labor, art assets have especially been outsourced in recent years. I can only list developers officially named, please keep in mind that developer and country data can not be perfect.\n\nI have included some data from my Twenty-Five Years of Games Across Eight Metrics project, namely ESRB ratings, genres, and average lengths of games. This data only covers games released in North America, and the PlayStation 4 data is a few years old now, though since this data is presented as an average it is unlikely to have changed much.\n\nFortunately, there were few issues with even the oldest Sony games having no developer named, or with vague release dates.\n\nSystem Infographics\n\nBefore we dig in I have to talk a bit about the original PlayStation and why it’s incomplete. In late 2020 I copied the list of PlayStation games from wikipedia to get started on this project. At the time I thought it was a shame that the PlayStation 4 list would not include many games that would come out before I finished this project. I did not expect to come back to the PlayStation list almost a year later while I was working on these infographics and see that almost one thousand new games had been added to this 25 year old console’s list of games.\n\nAlmost all of these games seem to be Japanese exclusives. According to Sony, 4,944 games were released in Japan, which likely means the original PlayStation’s library is even larger than the PlayStation 2’s. I’m glad Wikipedia editors are documenting these games, but I do wish I had somehow timed things better. This throws my numbers off for the number of games developed in Japan, and the top developers and publishers is likely off a bit too. I apologize for the errors.\n\nSony’s first system was an immediate success, with over 10 times as many games as their nearest competitor, the Nintendo 64, and selling three times as many hardware units.\n\nWe’ll be seeing Konami a lot on these lists, and they are off to a roaring start here. You probably haven’t heard of any of Lightspan Adventure’s games, even though they released over 100 titles for the PlayStation. Lightspan sold educational games directly to schools, and were quite prolific while they lasted.\n\nWhile many will call PlayStation a haven for Role-Playing games, it actually has the smallest share of them of any Sony system. What it does have the most of is Racing and Sports games.\n\nThe age ratings of PlayStation games are heavily skewed towards younger audiences with the highest share rated E for Everyone and lowest share rated M for Mature among Sony systems.\n\nThis was before the E10+ rating was introduced, but the PS1 has the only Early Childhood games on a Sony system (probably, it’s harder to find Early Childhood games since the ESRB got rid of the rating and made them unsearchable for on their website).\n\nThe PlayStation 2 is the best selling video game system of all time with a huge and varied library.\n\nKonami takes the top developer spot again, by a wide margin. Sega left the hardware business in 2001 and still became a top developer for both the PlayStation 2 and Gamecube. They merged with Sammy in 2004, and if you were to count Sega and Sega Sammy as the same company they would be ahead of Koei among developers, and in the top 7 publishers. Very few of Idea Factory’s games left Japan, but they mostly make tactical RPGs and visual novels.\n\nWith two systems to compare we can see some trends: games have become more mature, longer, and less exclusive to one region, though not so much with Japan quite yet.\n\nBeing a handheld, the PlayStation Portable still has a strong Japanese presence. I was a bit surprised to see how many sports and racing games Electronic Arts released. QuinRose made otome games, published every single one themselves, and not a single one left Japan.\n\nPuzzle, Strategy/Tactics, and Role-Playing games reach higher proportions on the PSP. If my genre data had included Japanese exclusives the PlayStation Portable would likely have looked fairly different, with many Japanese-exclusive visual novels qualifying as Adventure games.\n\nThis is the only Sony system where one of the top 5 best sellers is exclusive to one region: Monster Hunter Portable 3rd.\n\nThe PlayStation 3 is where things change for Japan. From making nearly 60% of the PS2 and PSP libraries to 30%, and there are also now three non-Japanese companies among the top 7 developers. Japanese exclusives drop from around 40% to 12.51%, and the amount of games released in all regions doubles. Fewer best sellers and top rated games are developed in Japan.\n\nRegional exclusives in general suddenly become much less common, and with Japan making fewer games they are now the region missing out on the most games.\n\nI would have expected average game lengths to increase with the advent of trophies, but it actually goes down a bit from the PSP.\n\nThere is also a shift towards more games with more mature age ratings.\n\nThe PlayStation Vita is Sony’s biggest aberration, receiving little support after its first few years and selling much less than any other Sony system.\n\nWhile the PS3 stepped away from Japanese games, the Vita was much more popular there than anywhere else, and there were about the same portion of games released there as with the PSP. Meanwhile, the North American and European markets had nearly identical libraries.\n\nWithout Electronic Arts’ support there are much fewer Sports games, and we see some new companies in the top 7s, while Sony develops and publishes fewer games than any of its other systems. Idea Factory and 5pb made a lot of visual novels. None of Media5’s games left Japan, 18 of them start with “NextRev” and might be designed to help you study for various kinds of exams, such as nursing, if I can trust google translate. We’ll talk more about Limited Run in a moment.\n\nSales data is very limited for the Vita, with very few official announcements, likely due to its poor sales.\n\nThe top developers and publishers represent much smaller pieces of the pie than ever before with the PlayStation 4, something also seen with the Switch. Games take longer to make, and there are more small studios making games than ever before.\n\nLimited Run was the first and probably currently is the largest company making limited amounts of physical versions of smaller, mostly indie, games that wouldn’t otherwise have been able to release physically. Their first PS4 release was about 2 and a half years into the system’s life, making it all the more difficult to claim the top spot. Limited Run were just getting started with the Switch when I released my Nintendo project, I’m sure they are currently near the top there too.\n\nJapan falls even further in the country rankings, but barely manages to remain the top producer of PS4 games.\n\nWhile the Vita’s sales numbers are likely spotty due to poor sales, there also seems to have been a change with major publishers in this era that led to them releasing fewer and more vague sales numbers, which is why these sales numbers are so nicely rounded. Many reports by these companies now focus on total revenue or number of active players. Nintendo on the other hand releases sales numbers to the ten-thousandths place for any titles that have sold at least one million copies every quarter.\n\nAt this point region exclusivity is almost dead, I had only 2 European exclusives recorded for the PS4. Japan has become the big loser when it comes to games not being localized.\n\nSony Games by System\n\nThis graph shows us the lifespan of the Sony systems, and how new systems supplant the old. 2013 was quite a year, with 5 systems receiving new releases.\n\nRather than relative amounts, here we can see the total number of games by year. The PlayStation era numbers should be quite a bit higher, as wikipedia had not documented many games at the time I grabbed its data. The increasing amount of time it takes to produce a game is apparent here with 2018 and on releasing fewer games than ~20 years ago, despite the larger number of developers. Even in the PlayStation 3’s third year it was still barely outdoing the output of the PlayStation 2.\n\nWhen a popular video game has been out for a while and its sales have slowed the publisher may release a discounted reprint. The requirements and names for these reprints vary by system and region. In North America Nintendo calls them “Player’s Choice” or “Nintendo Selects”, Sony calls them “Greatest Hits”.\n\nThis isn’t a comprehensive history of the practice though, what I’m interested in is the secondhand market for these games. Due to the addition of strongly colored banners and other changes to the box art many collectors will turn their nose up at these, considering them an eyesore. Some may consider them too “common” or “cheap” to be worthy collector’s items. Consequently, the common thought is that they are less valuable, and thus sell for less.\n\nIt has occurred to me many times that these reprints must actually be the rarer versions, since they are only released once a game has sold most of the copies it is going to sell and the publisher is willing squeeze whatever extra money they can from a game. What an unusual situation, where the rare version of something is cheaper and less desired. Collector’s editions and other variant printings are also less common, but generally sell for more than the base game in the secondhand market.\n\nI wanted to quantify this, just how much rarer are these discounted reprints, and how much less valuable are they? I started with Wikipedia’s lists of games to receive these reprints and recorded the complete price and sales volume from PriceCharting. While I added a few from PriceCharting’s lists that weren’t on Wikipedia, I found I had to remove far more. PriceCharting just doesn’t list the reprints separately for dozens of games.\n\nIn total 1,075 games were used, although 38 discounted reprints did not have price data, seemingly because they were so rarely sold. I only used data for “complete” games, this is more common than loose or new. PriceCharting gets its data by looking at completed listings on eBay.\n\nSales Volume\n\nPriceCharting has a quirky method of displaying how often a game is being sold and I must start by explaining it. Rather than displaying the average number of sales during a standard period of time such as a year, it instead uses the format “X sale(s) per day/week/month/year”. X never contains a decimal, so it has been rounded.\n\nFifteen different sales volumes were observed from the games I recorded, and it is likely there are no others.\n\nOn the right is how PriceCharting describes the sales volume, in the middle is how much this comes to per year, and I broke these down into tiers for some of the graphs I will be using, shown on the left. The two gray tiers, 15, and 16, were never observed and are probably very rarely, if ever, used, considering that tier 17 consists of a single game (try guessing what it is before we get there).\n\nThis is a somewhat haphazard way of describing sales volume, and the gap between tiers varies from a factor of 1.2 times to 2.34 times.\n\nRight away we can see that discounted reprints sell less often on average than the original version of a game. No original release was observed as being sold less than once a month, but keep in mind these are some of the most popular games for each system.\n\nThe most commonly sold discount reprint version of a game (at 2 a day) was also the most commonly sold original release of a game (6 a day): Wii Sports.\n\nThe three original releases at tier 14 (3 sales a day) are all Gamecube releases: Super Mario Sunshine, Super Smash Bros. Melee, and The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker.\n\nAnother thing I wanted to look into was how sales volume changed over time. This isn’t based on the games market overall, just games that have a discounted reprint. I wasn’t able to include the discounted reprints themselves because very few of them have reliable release dates.\n\nThe earliest games included were for the Game Boy, but there weren’t many with separate Player’s Choice listings. Volume remains pretty stable starting from 1998, probably due to 4th generation systems phasing out. I would have expected a gradual increase over time, as older games have more time to find permanent homes or be thrown away, and fewer people are interested in the retro scene. There was only one 2018 game included, God of War for PlayStation 4.\n\nPrice\n\nI’ve done other studies on game prices before so I didn’t look too deeply into prices alone, but here’s how much the original versions of games with a discounted reprint cost over time. The three Game Boy games from 1989 (Super Mario Land, Tennis, and Tetris) aren’t terribly expensive, but the 1991-1994 games that used cardboard packaging sure are. As games get newer from there they slowly get cheaper.\n\nPrice vs Sales Volume\n\nThis scatter plot gives some idea of how spread out the prices are in some tiers, but it’s difficult to see much of any correlation between sales volume and price since so many dots overlap each other.\n\nYou might not expect the least sold games (remember, tier 1-6 are all discounted reprints) to be so consistently cheap. The most expensive of the discounted reprints was Super Mario World at $287.08, while the most expensive overall was the original release of Super Mario World at $580.00.\n\nAre the rarest (or at least the least often sold on eBay) games actually the most expensive? It actually seems to be closer to the opposite, although there is not a clear a progression. Some of the wild swings are due to small sample size – tier 8, 14, and 17 among original releases have no more than 4 games each. Discounting them the average tends to creep up the more common a game is.\n\nDiscounted Reprint Vs Original Release\n\nThis graph shows just how much rarer discounted reprints tend to be. If a discounted reprint sold half as often the original release, it would be 50% here.\n\nMore than three fourths of discounted reprints have less than 15% the sales volume of the original release.\n\nCuriously, for 48 games studied both versions sold in equal amounts. I did not see any particular pattern among these other than none of them being from before the 5th generation.\n\nHere is another way of looking at the price difference between discounted reprints and original releases, we can see the overall trends better than the scatter plot. The price difference is small in most cases, but cheaper is a bit more common.\n\nPrince of Persia: Warrior Within’s Platinum Hits version for Xbox is for some reason over 10 times more expensive than the original release.\n\nAnd here are the price differences in absolute dollar amounts. For most games the difference is within $5.00 either way.\n\nSuper Mario World again holds a record for largest price between versions, with the Greatest Hits version being $292.92 cheaper, while the Sega All Stars version of Ready 2 Rumble Boxing for the Dreamcast is $165.00 more expensive. While I don’t have dates for either release I imagine Mario World’s Greatest Hits release was available for much longer and in much larger quantities.\n\nSome More Trivia\n\nThe average cost of the discounted reprint of a game in this study was $16.59, while original releases went for $19.35 on average. Not as large of a difference as I suspected going in to this project.\n\nThe average reprint sold 52.09 times a year, while an original averaged 313.53 sales per year.\n\nThe biggest difference in sales volume was The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King for PlayStation 2. The original sells 2 a day, while the reprint sells 1 a year, or 0.14% as often.\n\nSources\n\nNintendo Selects – Wikipedia\n\nSega All Stars – Wikipedia\n\nGreatest Hits (PlayStation) – Wikipedia\n\nPlatinum Hits – Wikipedia\n\nPriceCharting\n\nOverview\n\nA topic that comes up from time to time among Japanese Role-Playing Game enthusiasts is “what is the best system for JRPGs?” I look at these discussions and am often baffled by some of the things people suggest, but had nothing quantitative to back my opinions. As a big fan of the genre I have been wanting to do a project centered around them so I figured this would be an interesting thing to look into. In the process I also gathered a whole lot of data that is not related to game systems which I will also be going over.\n\nThankfully, a few days into the project and after realizing how many hours it would take just to decide what games from the Switch should be included, I saw a thread on /r/JRPG about a “JRPG Index” of every JRPG. This project may never have happened if I had not seen it, so thank you to JRPG Chronicles and the primary editor of its index, Lucca – more links in the Sources section.\n\nWhile this project mostly sticks to games in the JRPG index, my rules are slightly different. Here are the requirements for games to be included in this study:\n\nDeveloped in Japan or South Korea – Bug Fables and Child of Light do not count, but Crimson Gem Saga and Magna Carta: Crimson Stigmata do\n\nContains “enough” RPG elements – Monster Hunter and Dark Souls count\n\nOfficially licensed – no homebrew, RPG maker games, or fan translations\n\nReleased in North America and/or Europe\n\nReleased on a video game console – mobile, PC, and mini/classic consoles do not count\n\nNot released on a 9th generation system – The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S were still very new when I started this project and there were very few JRPGs released for them\n\nReleased before 2021\n\nDigital ports across generations are not counted if they are emulated and identical to their original version. So the Final Fantasy VII release on 8th generation hardware that has a speed up option and graphical improvements is counted, but PS one Classics on PS3 do not count\n\nGames only available on a system as part of a subscription service, such as Nintendo Switch Online or Xbox Game Pass, do not count\n\nGame Systems – Number of Games\n\nIt’s important to get an idea of what we’re working with first. Averages don’t mean as much if the data set is small, so I’ll be starting each section with the number of games relevant to what we’re talking about. Games released on multiple platforms are counted multiple times.\n\nClicking on the images will expand them. You can go to the next or previous image with the arrow keys, and close the lightbox with escape.\n\nWithin the parameters of this study, there are 21 home consoles and 8 handhelds with 1,639 JRPG releases. There are a few more systems with JRPGs, notably the WonderSwan, that weren’t included because they were only released in Japan.\n\nAn important aspect of determining the best JRPG system must the number of JRPGs. More games means more chances of finding a game you enjoy. The PlayStation 4 stands above everything else by a comfortable margin as of my cutoff date of 12/31/2020, and will see a few more. But while the Switch is #2 here, it is adding roughly 33% more JRPGs to its library per year than the PS4 has been, and it has several more years of life left in it, so it will likely end up pretty close by the time both systems stop receiving releases.\n\nPeople often remark on how JRPGs mostly moved to handhelds with the 7th generation, and we can see that clearly here. The 7th generation was the birth of digital distribution on video game systems, and saw a big influx of games because of it, yet the PlayStation 3 has fewer JRPGs than the PlayStation 2 or PlayStation Portable. This is even more pronounced with the Wii and the DS.\n\nIt’s quite impressive that the Vita has more JRPGs than the PSP, despite selling so much worse.\n\nGame Systems – Metascores\n\nBut it doesn’t matter how many games are on a system if they aren’t any good, so let’s look into the quality of the JRPGs on each system, first with metascores.\n\nMost of these metascores are from GameRankings, which closed over a year ago. GameRankings displayed scores down to the hundredth decimal place, included older games than Metacritic, and did not weigh publications differently. Games without a GameRankings metascore used a Metacritic metascore when possible. For GameRankings I only included games with at least 5 reviews, and with Metacritic, 4 reviews.\n\nWhile GameRankings has metascores for some older games there is a bit of selection bias for games released before the 6th generation. Typically only the most popular and best selling games have enough reviews, driving the overall average higher.\n\nSystems without any metascores are omitted, and please also note that the y-axis starts at 60, making differences look larger than they actually are.\n\nWhile the Sega CD and Saturn’s numbers look impressive, keep in mind that they had 3 and 8 games respectively with metascores and that the worst JRPGs didn’t get reviewed at all.\n\nThe Game Boy Color and Xbox One have more games to average, but are still rarely thought of as great JRPG systems. While the Xbox One got most of the same digital-only, small developer, low budget releases as the Switch and PS4, much fewer of them got reviewed, which helped its overall average tremendously.\n\nBut the average doesn’t tell the whole story. What’s really important when you’re looking for a system to play JRPGs on is how many great JRPGs it has, right?\n\nWe have different ideas of how poor of a metascore might need to be before we wouldn’t consider looking at a game, and how high a metascore needs to be to really grab your attention, so here we have metascores broken into 10 point chunks.\n\nThe original PlayStation has had the largest number of 90+ scored games, at 6, while the DS, PS2, PS4, and Xbox One have 4. While Sega had the two systems with the highest averages, there are only 3 90+ JRPGs in Sega’s history – Panzer Dragoon Saga, Lunar: Eternal Blue, and Skies of Arcadia.\n\nOverall, there isn’t much difference between the relative proportions of these buckets among different systems, the 70s are the largest group, followed by 60s, or sometimes the 80s.\n\nGame Systems – Polls\n\nTo get more of the “fans who don’t happen to work for a major game reviewing outlet” viewpoint I also looked at two polls to gauge how well different systems were received.\n\nThe first was held on /r/JRPG in late March 2020. 178 users voted for up to 10 games.\n\nThe second seems to have been advertised in many places, as there were over 1500 responses. I’m not sure when it started, but it was posted to /r/JRPG in early 2021. I am using the data from the “vote for your 10 favorite games” poll. Unfortunately, I can only see the top 100 games, so many games with a few votes were not counted.\n\nI “normalized” the votes between these two polls so that they had equal weight, despite their difference in vote totals. This resulted in a number of “points” given to each game that received at least one vote. I multiplied the number by 100 so we didn’t have to deal with a bunch of zeros, so ultimately one vote in one poll is worth .7 points, and the most voted for game (Chrono Trigger) is 100. This is what I mean when I refer to “poll points”.\n\nBefore we get to the graphs, I feel it is important to discuss the relative merits of metascores and poll points.\n\nAll metascores are of their time, based on expectations for games coming out on those systems. Metascores cover many more games, no one voted for many mediocre to bad games in either poll. However, ports often do not get enough attention to receive a metascore, especially cross generational ones.\n\nRetrospective fan polls can favor enduring classics and foundational childhood memories. Games that are not just good for their time is also an important factor here, as some game mechanics and quality of life issues that were considered normal at the time of a game’s release may be viewed harshly in the future. Polls also favor JRPGs ported across many consoles, as more people get a chance to play a game. I chose to give all versions of a game the full number of poll points, except when the polls specifically split them into separate releases. Since people have different personal definitions of JRPGs, some games that not everyone considers to qualify will receive fewer votes. Compilations did not receive any points if a game within them was voted for.\n\nSystems with larger libraries have more opportunities to earn poll points and are also more top of mind, so it’s not much of a surprise to see the 8th generation doing so well overall, other than the Vita.\n\nChrono Trigger was the most voted for game in both polls and was worth 100 points, more than a third of the SNES and DS’s point totals.\n\nSega’s entire catalog of JRPGs was beat many individual systems.\n\nGame Systems – Physical Game Price\n\nPhysical game prices are always increasing, (studied in some detail here) making it difficult to play many of the best JRPGs on older systems. What good is a system if you can’t afford the games you want?\n\nThe following data is from PriceCharting, which analyzes games sold on eBay. The prices used in this study are of “complete in box” copies, which means the box, game, manual, and other inserts are included, but the shrink wrap has been removed and the game has likely been played. These prices are the most volatile data included and will be out of date the quickest. All prices are in United States Dollars. North American versions were used when possible.\n\nIf you’re curious about the overall average cost of a game on various systems, I have studied that too.\n\nIt will cost you $65,740.29 ($51.60 on average) to own a complete physical copy of every JRPG released before 2021, and that number is only getting bigger.\n\nThe SNES and PS1 are known for having many classics, and are often talked about as some of the best JRPG systems, but the DS is almost tied with them in terms of price.\n\nWhile there aren’t many 3rd generation JRPGs, I was surprised how cheap they were overall.\n\nThe Saturn has several expensive games but Panzer Dragoon Saga, at $996.61, is carrying a lot of that price.\n\nGame Systems – Digital Game Price\n\nWhile I strongly prefer to have physical copies of my games, I understand many like to have digital copies instead. I did not record delisted games or anything from storefronts that have closed. All prices are without discounts.\n\nI originally had a note here about the PS3 and PSVita storefronts closing, but that is no longer the case for now.\n\nA complete digital collection of what is possible to buy at the moment will cost you $24,821.07 ($28.53 on average).\n\nAs digital prices are more standardized (more on price distributions later), total digital cost tracks closely with number of JRPGs.\n\nGame Systems – Cheapest Versions\n\nMaybe you’re agnostic about the format of your games and are happy to buy whichever is cheaper.\n\nA complete collection of JRPGs, buying only the cheapest format, comes to $68,297.81. This is more expensive than either a complete physical or digital set, as it includes all physical-only and all digital-only games.\n\nSystems without active digital storefronts have the same prices as the physical copies graph, but Switch, PS4, and Xbox One see a sizeable increase in the price of a complete collection.\n\nGame Systems – Exclusivity\n\nSome games get ported many times across multiple generations, while some are forever stuck on one system. In choosing the best JRPG system I feel that one must consider the exclusives.\n\nBut maybe retrospective fan polls tell a different story than current-at-the-time reviews?\n\nMuch less nostalgic than I would have guessed, and bit of recency bias instead. Since the people voting in these polls are probably mostly in their 20s, it’s natural to see fewer older games. Much bigger differences between adjacent years than the metascores.\n\n100 of 1995’s and 2008’s points come from Chrono Trigger. Very different years without it.\n\nOnly 4 games from 2002 received any poll points, Kingdom Hearts chief among them.\n\nPublishers – Number of Games\n\nIt may seem to make more sense to study developers than publishers. Developers make the games, after all. While that’s true, publishers exercise varying control over how a game turns out and many are developed and published by the same company. There’s also many more developers, many of which have short lives, are bought and sold to different companies, and don’t make a statistically significant number of games.\n\nI didn’t do any combining of companies based on ownership, I just kept it to how they were credited, much to Atlus’s favor. Only publishers with at least 10 releases are included. North American publishers are used when possible.\n\nSquare Enix have dominated the JRPG genre since it was created 18 years ago. Not just Final Fantasy games but also many higher budget games that they don’t develop.\n\nNintendo isn’t particularly known for publishing JRPGs, but their age, their willingness to bring some games overseas when the original publisher isn’t interested, and the many Pokémon games are enough for second place.\n\nKemco has a long history, but it wasn’t until the last decade or so that they started cranking out cheap mobile JRPGs, and then porting them to every other system possible.\n\nPublishers – Metascores\n\nWorking Designs was a somewhat controversial and short lived publisher known for their elaborate special editions, but comes out on top in terms of metascore.\n\nSome people feel like Square became a shell of themselves after their merger with Enix, and there is a noticeable drop in scores.\n\nNintendo maintains quite a large average considering their output.\n\nFew of Kemco’s games even get enough reviews to qualify for a metascore, but when they do, it isn’t pretty.\n\nPublishers – Polls\n\nSquare Enix wins out on fan acclaim, with Nintendo and Atlus also pretty proportionate to the number of releases under their belt.\n\nNippon Ichi and Kemco really don’t make much of an impression despite their large number of JRPGs. 122 Kemco releases, and not a single person counted any of them among their favorite.\n\nIt’s not entirely fair to compare publishers with many titles against those with a few, so here is the average number of poll points per release.\n\nSquare Soft gets a big boost here, with most of its games making someone’s favorites list, while Square Enix gets a big drop.\n\nSony also fares a bit better, but this way of looking at the data doesn’t change much else.\n\nSeries – Number of Games\n\nPublisher loyalty isn’t common, so let’s get angry and argue about what the best JRPG series is. Series had to include at least 5 distinct games without ports. All spinoffs were included. How many do you think qualified?\n\nForty-four, enough to have to split them into two graphs. Hyperdimension Neptunia and The Legend of Heroes got a bit cut off to fit better.\n\nWith a long history, many spinoffs, many remakes, and many ports, Final Fantasy is by far the most prolific JRPG series.\n\nAtelier has been releasing games almost every year, porting them widely, and remaking some of them, but few people would probably guess that it’s #2 in terms of total games.\n\nSeries – Metascores\n\nThe y-axis again starts at 50 to exaggerate differences.\n\nThe Dark Souls series are not traditional JRPGs, but only two of its releases have scored below 85, earning it highest overall.\n\nThe Xenogears, Xenosaga, and Xenoblade games are much more eclectic but have done very well overall.\n\nI was surprised to see Shin Megami Tensei (which includes Persona) so high up, with 31 games it’s difficult to keep the average so high.\n\nDrakengard+Nier are a loose series that I forgot to include, but their metascore average is 72.5.\n\nWhen I look back at old gaming magazines there were quite a few articles about Yu-Gi-Oh and Digimon being potential Pokémon killers, so it’s funny to see them dead last.\n\nSeries – Polls\n\nFinal Fantasy, with its large amount of titles and long legacy takes the most poll points by a large margin.\n\nChrono Trigger (both releases) and Chrono Cross aren’t a large enough series to be included, but if they were, they’d rank fourth, just under Dragon Quest.\n\nAs with publishers, it may be more meaningful to look at the average number of poll points per game, rather than the total.\n\nXeno, with only Xenosaga Episode II not getting any points, takes the crown from Final Fantasy.\n\nThe Legend of Heroes also gets a boost, while Shin Megami Tensei and Dragon Quest stay close to their original positions.\n\nBig 4 Hardware Makers\n\nFour large hardware makers have dominated the video games market: Nintendo, Sega, Sony, and Microsoft. Sometimes people discuss not just the best systems, but the best hardware company. With so many games over such a long period, and so many other factors to consider, I’m not sure this is very meaningful, but I still wanted to see who came out on top.\n\nY-axis starts at 60, so please keep in mind the overall range here is only 5.29.\n\nThe relatively small number of JRPGs released and also considered worthy of review on Sega systems overall scored quite well. Sony’s average is no doubt hurt by its huge library.\n\nIn terms of people’s overall favorite games, though, Sony has a solid lead over Nintendo, while Microsoft and Sega are nowhere close.\n\nMiscellaneous Findings\n\nTrivia and Superlatives\n\nThe games included in this study fit a common definition of JRPGs, but are not an objective truth. I make this distinction because I want any readers of this project to exercise some caution before repeating any of the following as an absolute fact. And so I don’t have to add “for the purposes of this study” over and over to every statement.\n\nI learned a lot about my favorite genre and still have more interesting information to share.\n\nOne interesting JRPG I didn’t get to talk about was Napoleon. Napoleon was only released in Japan and France, possibly the only game to ever have this distinction. I specifically didn’t make “available in English” a requirement so that it would be included.\n\nI recorded the range of metascores of every JRPG series, too. Dark Souls unsurprisingly had the smallest range, at 8.06, but Etrian Odyssey was #2 with 9.45. On the other side of the scale Final Fantasy had the largest range thanks to its many spinoffs, at 45.46. Atelier has the second highest range thanks to the poorly received Mana Khemia: Student Alliance, at 41.22.\n\nThe cheapest JRPG with a metascore of over 90 is Final Fantasy XII for the PlayStation 2, just $6.40.\n\nThe first 5 JRPGs released in North America or Europe – remember that these dates are not exact, and are in a mm/dd/yyyy format:\n\nMiracle Warriors: Seal of the Dark Lord – 01/31/1988 – Master System\n\nDragon Power – 03/01/1988 – NES\n\nPhantasy Star – 11/01/1988 – Master System\n\nCastlevania II: Simon’s Quest – 12/01/1988 – NES\n\nZelda II: The Adventure of Link – 12/01/1988 – NES\n\nThe oldest JRPG still exclusive to one system is SpellCaster on the Master System, released 09/01/89. The first digital-only JRPG was Ape Quest for the PSP (01/10/08), though it did get a physical release in Japan.\n\nThe 5 JRPGs with the lowest metascores:\n\nMagus (PlayStation 3) – 32.5\n\nFantasy Hero: Unsigned Legacy (Switch) – 34\n\nSwords & Darkness (3DS) – 36\n\nArc of Alchemist (Switch) – 36\n\nMedabots Infinity (GameCube) – 37.67\n\nThe 10 JRPGs with the highest metascores:\n\nChrono Trigger (SNES) – 95.64\n\nPersona 5 Royal (PlayStation 4) – 95\n\nPersona 4: Golden (PSVita) – 94.16\n\nFinal Fantasy III (what we know as VI now, SNES) – 93.96\n\nPersona 5 (PlayStation 4) – 93.3\n\nCastlevania: Symphony of the Night (PlayStation) – 93.03\n\nOdin Sphere: Leifthrasir (PlayStation Vita) – 93\n\nDragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age – Definitive Edition (PlayStation 4) – 93\n\nFinal Fantasy IX (PlayStation) – 92.72\n\nFire Emblem: Awakening (3DS) – 92.52\n\nThe earliest game to earn any poll points was Phantasy Star for the Sega Master System, released around 11/01/1988.\n\nThe 10 JRPGs with the most poll points:\n\nChrono Trigger (SNES, DS) – 100 poll points\n\nPersona 5 (PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4) – 78.33 poll points\n\nFinal Fantasy III/Final Fantasy VI (SNES, DS) – 65.89 poll points\n\nShin Megami Tensei: Persona 4/Persona 4: Golden (PlayStation 2, PlayStation Vita) – 59.60 poll points\n\nFinal Fantasy X (PlayStation 2) – 56.03 poll points\n\nFinal Fantasy IX (PlayStation, PlayStation 4, Switch, Xbox One) – 53.34 poll points\n\nDragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age – Definitive Edition (PlayStation 4, Switch, Xbox One) – 51.35 poll points\n\nShin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 Portable (PlayStation Portable) – 48.61 poll points\n\nNier: Automata (PlayStation 4, Xbox One) – 48.20 poll points\n\nXenoblade Chronicles/Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition (Wii, Switch) 43.26 poll points\n\nThe 5 cheapest JRPGs (complete, physical):\n\nKingdom of Paradise (PlayStation Portable) – $3.75\n\nSushi Striker (3DS) – $4.39\n\nCode Name: S.T.E.A.M. (3DS) – $4.47\n\nDragon’s Dogma (Xbox 360) – $4.60\n\nTokyo Twilight Ghost Hunters – Daybreak Special Gigs (PlayStation 4) – $4.90\n\nThe 5 most expensive JRPGs (complete, physical):\n\nEarthbound (SNES) – $1,275.78\n\nPanzer Dragoon Saga (Saturn) – $996.61\n\nMagic Knight Rayearth (Saturn) – $742.50\n\nE.V.O.: Search for Eden (SNES) – $624.99\n\nChrono Trigger (SNES) – $546.93\n\nI should have made this a graph, but the most to least expensive average price of a physical game by system:\n\nSaturn: $300.21\n\n3DO: $196.87\n\nSNES: $192.38\n\nSega CD: $175.05\n\nTurbografx: $155.60\n\nGame Boy: $140.36\n\nN64: $125.70\n\nGame Boy Color: $93.55\n\nNES: $87.76\n\nGamecube: $85.31\n\nGame Boy Advance: $82.17\n\nPlayStation: $77.28\n\nGenesis: $72.70\n\nGame Gear: $62.96\n\nMaster System: $55.48\n\nDreamcast: $46.18\n\nDS: $46.00\n\nPlayStation 2: $37.63\n\nWii: $33.13\n\nSwitch: $26.24\n\nPlayStation Vita: $22.96\n\nPlayStation 4: $22.87\n\nWii U: $21.06\n\nXbox One: $18.56\n\nPlayStation 3: $18.56\n\n3DS: $17.65\n\nPlayStation Portable: $17.20\n\nXbox: $13.95\n\nXbox 360: $13.77\n\nThe overall average was $41.67, in between the DS and PlayStation 2.\n\nThe Best JRPG System\n\nBack to the central question of this study, first let us discuss individual systems and just their libraries, without backwards compatibility.\n\nI have to give it to the PlayStation 4. It has the most JRPGs scoring at least 80 by a good margin, has a large and diverse library, it’s modern enough to not have the headaches of battery or memory card saves, it has online features, and it has trophy support if you’re into that. The games are also cheaper on average than the Switch, and will likely fall much more over the next ten years.\n\nThe 3DS and Switch are also excellent systems, with lots of highly rated games, and are handhelds/can be handheld. The 3DS has cheaper games on average (4th cheapest average physical price), while the Switch has a more eclectic selection of ports from different eras, but fewer exclusives.\n\nIf we’re to include backwards compatibility I think a “fat” PlayStation 3 that can play PlayStation 2 and PlayStation discs offers the best overall value with a huge and mostly affordable library. Unfortunately, finding one in working condition is becoming harder and more expensive. While a fix for the Yellow Ring of Death has fairly recently come to light, it still requires buying specific capacitors and a willingness to open up your system and solder. In addition there are quite a few PS one Classics and PlayStation 2 Classics if you want cheap digital JRPGs.\n\nIf you’re not willing to do hardware fixes or you’re not looking to buy digital games, the PlayStation 2 and non-fat PlayStation 3 both play original PlayStation discs natively, which is a nice if expensive addition to their libraries.\n\nThe 3DS, which can play DS games, is another excellent choice, with a large number of JRPGs that are unlikely to ever get ported elsewhere, and overall cheap prices with a few expensive outliers.\n\nIf you are into older handheld JRPGs, the GameCube with a Game Boy Player is actually capable of playing games from the entire Game Boy line. Those 4 systems are among the 11 most expensive systems to buy JRPGs for, so it’s not for everyone.\n\nSo overall, depending on your tastes and wallet, the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, Switch, and 3DS are all great systems with lots of quality JRPGs to play, many of which are quite affordable.\n\nWrapup\n\nAfter reading all this did you change your mind at all? What do you value most when considering a JRPG system? Should cost be a factor at all? Is library size the only important metric? Or maybe you only care about your favorite series?\n\nI would like to include a copy of the spreadsheet I used to make this project. Perhaps you will find it helpful in finding a new JRPG to play or perhaps you would like to study the statistics your own way. You can save this as an HTML file and then copy and paste into your preferred spreadsheet program. Some of the formatting is sloppy and I am sure I made some mistakes.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRivdWr57EDcnjZLQSfPzZI3Z9pJ0urTARI9ErGF-z3zPjUvGqq5Sh5gKqOfLEo6dlnYWS-jTSO5PPZ/pubhtml\n\nSources\n\nThe JRPG Index, by Lucca, part of JRPG Chronicles, for the base list of games.\n\n/r/JRPG wiki’s list of JRPGs for a lot of publisher and release date information.\n\nWikipedia’s various lists of games for publisher, release date, and other information.\n\nhttps://gr.blade.sk/#/ for an archive of GameRankings’s metascores.\n\nMetaCritic for other metascores.\n\n/r/JRPG’s Greatest JRPGs of All-Time poll results for providing poll numbers.\n\nThe Greatest JRPG Games and Battle Systems of All Time Poll for also providing poll numbers.\n\nPriceCharting for physical game prices.\n\nNintendo Game Store for digital prices of Nintendo games.\n\nOfficial PlayStation Store for digital prices of Sony games.\n\nMicrosoft Store for digital prices of Microsoft games.\n\nMobyGames for exclusivity and miscellaneous information.\n\nIn part 1 I went over when games are released, and how that varies by the North American, European, and Japanese regions. What I’m covering in this post is the distribution of games between regions and how long it takes for a game to reach those regions.\n\nRegions Over Time and By System\n\nAlmost every console and handheld game once saw a Japanese release, despite having a much smaller population than either North America or Europe, but now fewer and fewer games do. North America and Europe have both seen a consistent rise in the percent of games they receive. There’s a spike of multiregionalism in 2017 that we will see in many of these graphs.\n\nThis isn’t a breakdown of how well each system has sold in each region, but it’s pretty close. While Nintendo has seen more games released in North America and Europe than in Japan, the difference is more extreme for Microsoft systems. The Saturn’s huge number of games released in Japan is the opposite of the Xbox. The PS2 to PS3 is a dramatic shift with around twice the percent of games coming to North America.\n\nRegional Exclusivity\n\nThe number of games exclusive to Japan has been dropping pretty steadily for 25 years as fewer games are made there and more of them that do need international sales. The spike in 2020 is probably because many games that will see further releases later just hadn’t been yet at the time I gathered my data. There have never been many European exclusives but they have almost completely disappeared in the last 5 years. 2010 was an odd year with North American exclusives briefly overtaking Japanese exclusives.\n\nWe’re not likely to ever see another video game system so focused on one market than the Sega Saturn. The Wii U had a ton of digital games developed by one person or a very small team in America that weren’t able to even release their games in Europe. One region exclusives have largely gone out of style, the Switch, PS4, and Xbox One just having a handful in many regions.\n\nTwo Regions, but Not Necessarily Exclusively\n\nI know this is an odd category, but it was easy to do. These are the percent of games released in two regions, and maybe the third. We can see that if a game was released in Japan it has always been almost equally likely to also be released in Europe or North America. But more games overall release in both North America and Europe.\n\nI don’t have a lot to say about this one, all systems have kept roughly the same proportions of each combination, except the Saturn.\n\nTwo Regions Exclusively\n\nGames released in North American and Europe but not Japan have risen over time as the Japanese market has shrunk. Although it’s just one more language, compared to the several of Europe, there are some unique challenges to localizing a game for Japan, which has made it less worth it for publishers. Meanwhile few games have ever excluded just North America or just Europe and that number has shrunk over time.\n\nNo system has bucked the trend of North America + Europe but not Japan being by far the most common combination of regions.\n\nAll Three Regions\n\nIt costs a lot of money to release a game in the three major regions, and generally only games with the widest possible appeal get the chance. This has increased over time as digital distribution has reduced some of that cost. Even rarer has been the simultaneous release, which requires a lot of coordination and perhaps sitting on a completed game for some time.\n\nThe earliest game I could find with a simultaneous release that I could verify (there’s some spotty and inconsistent information on some earlier DS titles) was Gran Turismo for the PSP on October 1st, 2009. It was even sold physically.\n\nIt’s clear here that simultaneous releases were unheard of until the 7th generation, but still rare. In the 8th generation they make up a fair portion of all games. Handhelds have been a bit behind their console counterparts on both three region releases and simultaneous releases.\n\nRegions Charts\n\nSorry about the wording and coloring being a bit different, but here are the charts covering all of the data seen so far in this post. Not a single PS4 game exclusive to Europe and Japan, and not a single Xbox One game exclusive to North America and Japan.\n\nRegion Gaps\n\nSometimes there is a short amount of time between the release of a game in two regions, and sometimes there is a long amount of time. I am calling the number of days between a release in two regions the “gap”. Games released in only one region have no gap and are not figured into the calculations below, but games released in two regions on the same day have a gap of 0.\n\nThese gaps can be for several reasons: a game may not sell well in its initial region, a game has a lot of text, a game may have aspects that are difficult make understandable to a foreign audience, localization teams are busy with other projects, a game may have been made in a way that makes it technically difficult to add support for text that works in different ways and takes a different amount of space, or logistical issues.\n\nThe “relative gap” is handy because it also shows us which region gets games first, on average. The difference between positive and negative values is in which region gets a game first. If it takes an equally long amount for a game to reach either region it will stay at 0. This graph shows us that North America has gotten games before Europe on average for every Nintendo system, although it has taken a shorter and shorter amount of time. Games released in Japan used to overwhelmingly be released in Japan before heading to North America and Europe, but this has turned around with the Wii U and Switch.\n\nThe “absolute gap”, meanwhile, does not take the first region into account, it is just the total number of days between a release in two regions. Handhelds for some reason have taken longer to leave Japan than console games. Although the 3DS and Switch are handheld neighbors there is a large difference in localization times.\n\nThe Playstation has the largest average relative gap with Japanese games taking hundreds of days to reach Europe. Sony’s handheld games have also taken much longer to leave Japan compared to their console counterparts.\n\nThe Japanese-European difference only grows in the absolute graph, showing that games released in Europe before Japan take even longer to be localized. Sony’s console games have overall taken a bit longer than Nintendo’s to make the jump to second and third regions.\n\nDespite its overwhelmingly Japan-only library the Saturn’s multi-region games are almost perfectly balanced between how long it takes to reach each region. The Xbox was an outlier for its time, with Japan having to wait on North American and European games instead of the other way around.\n\nInterestingly, the Dreamcast is the only 6th generation console that took longer to release games in other regions than its 5th generation counterpart. The average number of days for a game to reach Japan has stayed very equal between North America and Europe on Microsoft systems.\n\nHere’s the chart for the relative and absolute gaps. The Xbox One wins the award for smallest absolute gap with just 1.77 average days between North American and European releases, no doubt many of them on the same day. Meanwhile Europe to Japan or vice versa took almost a year on average for Playstation games.\n\nI couldn’t resist finding what games took the longest amount of time to cross regional borders for each system. The PS1’s Dragon Ball Z: Ultimate Battle 22 also came up in my metascore study as being responsible for the worst quarter for any system, scoring a 32.03% and being very late in the system’s life. I was surprised that three Pokemon games appeared on this list, as Nintendo was really pushing it hard.\n\nThe game that, as far as I can tell, has taken the longest amount of time to be released between two regions is Breath of Fire III for the PSP. 3,820 days after the August 3rd, 2005 Japanese release (physical and digital), North America got a digital-only release on February 9th, 2016. That’s over a decade – the PSVita was about to celebrate its fourth birthday in North America at the time. Europe got a physical and digital release on February 3, 2006, which makes the North America-Europe gap the second longest regional gap.\n\nRelease dates for games are something we take for granted now, but it didn’t use to be that way. Even big releases generally only had an estimate of what month you might be able to buy them. Super Mario Bros, one of the most important video games ever released, does not have a definitive North American release date.\n\nSonic 2sday, November 24th, 1992, was a promotion by Sega for Sonic the Hedgehog 2 that led to games having set release dates like other media, and less like toys. This was an event to look forward to, rather than different outlets getting a game at different times and maybe not putting it out for sale for a few weeks. This wasn’t quite a worldwide release, with Japan getting Sonic 2 a few days earlier, but a near-simultaneous worldwide release was an impressive and unique feat for the time and was likely the reason games continued to be released predominately on Tuesdays for years to come.\n\nThis project looks at the evolving history of video game release dates, starting with the 5th generation – N64/PS1/Saturn/GBC. I didn’t include games from the 4th, Sonic the Hedgehog 2’s generation, because there were still so many games without an exact release date.\n\nTo qualify for inclusion games had to have been released in at least the North America, Europe, or Japan region and have at least one known exact release date. I only included consoles and handhelds from Nintendo, Sony, Sega, and Microsoft. The earliest games were Japan-only Sega Saturn games from 1994, and the latest games have announced dates later in 2020.\n\nIn total 31,338 games were included with 58,055 release dates.\n\nDate information was mostly from Wikipedia’s lists of games, but several only had the first release date or no dates at all, so I had to manually look up and enter thousands of dates from MobyGames. I ran many checks on the dates when I was done to find suspicious outliers and made many corrections, but I don’t claim my data to be perfect. My two sources, Wikipedia and MobyGames, also disagree on many release dates and I have no way to confirm which is true.\n\nSometimes games in Europe are released on slightly different days in different countries. When this was the case I used the United Kingdom’s release date. If there was no known United Kingdom release date I used the earliest known date.\n\nDates are shown in the mm/dd/yyyy format.\n\nThe distribution of Included Games\n\nI’m including these first two graphs to give an idea of the sample sizes involved. 1994 and 1995 were early in the 5th generation and don’t have many games, so averages aren’t very reliable. Most of my data was gathered in early 2020 so there weren’t many games from that year either.\n\nSome systems just didn’t have many games, like the N64, and some, like the GBA, had very spotty information so many games couldn’t be included.\n\nDates\n\nHere is the average percent of games released in North America on every day of the year. The year on the next several graphs and charts are shown as 2000 because the tools I use won’t accept a date without a year, but it is the average from the full range of years used in the study. The dotted line at 0.27 (1/366*100) represents the frequency we would expect if every date saw an equal number of games released.\n\nThere are several outliers but there is a general trend of releases becoming rarer in late November and hitting rock bottom around the end and beginning of the year. Releases pick up slowly but steadily through February and March but then abruptly fall with the start of April. Things are slow but steady until the end of June which sees a surge of releases, before abruptly falling again as July starts. The end of March and June surge may have to do with financial quarters ending. Releases then grow quickly through the end of summer and throughout the fall as holiday shopping picks up, with the biggest release days in November.\n\nEurope follows much of the same trends as North America. February and March see a few more releases, more spread out. There is another end of June surge. The fall flurry is a bit more spread out too, never reaching the same peaks, and ending a bit later.\n\n(I suggest opening these in new tabs) First is the exact percent of games of every date, and second is every date sorted with the total number of games released on that date.\n\nJanuary 4th in Japan is the date with the smallest number of releases, at just one! The game in question was a DSi game known as Trajectile in North America and Reflect Missile in Europe and Japan. Unfortunately, I can’t say for sure it really came out on January 4th, wikipedia says it did, while Nintendo Life says it was the 20th. Regardless, January 4th may get so few releases in part because Japanese workers return from their New Year’s break on this date.\n\nSpeaking of Japan, holidays don’t have much of an impact on game releases. Golden Week is a series of 4 holidays on April 29th, May 3rd, May 4th, and ending with Children’s Day on May 5th. But April 29th is pretty average for an end of month date, and early May sees some of the fewest releases. August 15th stood out to me as an unusually light day, but some googling reminded me that this is the day Japan surrendered to the Allied powers, a somber day of mourning those who died in the war.\n\nI was surprised that Halloween is the most common release date in North America, and only slightly less popular in Europe. It’s not a day I associate with buying video games. July 4th, the USA’s Independence Day, is among the least common, and Christmas Eve and Day also see few releases in either region.\n\nNorth America and Europe have many holidays that can occur on different days of the year, making it difficult to determine if they have any impact.\n\nDays of the Week\n\nSonic 2sday is sometimes credited as being the reason North American games continue to be released on Tuesdays as well as Tuesday just being the day books, albums, and DVDs come out, so of course video games do too. But is that really true? It wasn’t until 1998 that Tuesday became the most common release day, and it was a pretty small lead until 2003.\n\nIf you google when games are released in North America you’ll find plenty of articles and discussions about Tuesdays, but this actually stopped being true a few years ago. Thursdays have taken over and no one seems to have noticed.\n\nFridays have also seen a surge in releases, while Mondays and especially Sundays have become less popular. Wednesdays have stayed pretty stable.\n\nEurope is pretty similar to North America in terms of dates of the year, but not in terms of days of the week. Friday long dominated releases until the early ’10s, when Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday all got a larger share. Saturday, Sunday, and Monday have always had few releases.\n\nThis article discusses several factors contributing to the history of Friday game releases in Europe, such as it being the traditional pay day, and to differentiate itself from other media that releases on other days of the week.\n\nJapan, meanwhile, also has its own thing going on. Friday seems to be the big day for the mid 90s (remember that I had very few 1994 dates), but that changed very quickly in 1997 and 1998, instead becoming Thursday. Thursday continued to see most releases for many years, but lost ground in the 10s before reclaiming much of the ground it had lost. I don’t have a lot of 2020 releases for Japan, but it seems like it may have seen another sudden shift, back to Friday.\n\nTuesdays and Wednesdays have seen a smaller number of releases since 2008, while Saturday, Sunday, and Monday have had very few.\n\nI can’t find any information about why games are released this way in Japan.\n\nHere is a chart showing the exact values for the previous three charts. If we exclude 1994, 1995, and 2020, the lowest value is Sundays in 2018 in Japan, at 0.10%. The highest is Fridays in Japan in 1996 at 92.42% of releases, followed closely by Thursdays in Japan in 2005, at 91.77%.\n\nDays of the Month\n\nI have put the days of the month into 6 groups here because 31 nearly identically sized bars wouldn’t be very enlightening. We don’t hear about what days of the month games come out very often, so I was curious if there would be any interesting trends, and alas, they are almost equal, other than the first part of the month seeing a few less releases.\n\nIn the first part of the 25 Years of Games Project, I noted that almost all computer game release dates from the mid to late 90s seemed to be on the last day of the month. I was not sure if those games really did overwhelmingly release on those days, or if the exact date was unknown but every source I could find just said that they did without acknowledging the uncertainty. What I did not notice was a smaller, but still significant, portion of console games with listed dates on the last day of the month too. Looking through them it seems to be more common with N64 and PS1 games than Saturn. I still don’t know if this is a case of a legitimate industry trend, or poor record keeping of the time. 1995 would likely have shown the same bias towards the last day of the month if I had more data from that year.\n\nEurope’s day of month releases look very similar to the North America’s, except that mysterious last day of the month trend is not there. In my findings fewer European releases have exact known dates, so I would expect there to be more uncertainty, more rough estimates, not fewer.\n\nJapan’s major difference from North America and Europe is fewer releases in the beginning of the month, and more at the end, as we saw from the dates dot graph. The difference is still less extreme than day of the week differences, and has seen much less change over time.\n\nHere is every single ungrouped day of the month, with all years combined. The 25th, 26th, 27th, and 28th stand out among Japanese releases. North America and Europe stay pretty similar to each other, with a few exceptions like the 1st, 7th, 18th, 29th, and 31st.\n\nI provide these huge tables so you can find patterns yourself if you really want, and to “show my work” and be transparent about my data.\n\nMonths\n\nThe distribution of months hasn’t changed much in North America over time. The holiday shopping season of October and November has gotten fewer releases over time. 2019 stands out, with May having more releases than October or November after being one of the slowest months for many years.\n\nEurope is not too different from North America in terms of months of releases. 1999 was quite an odd year with over half of all games releasing in October or later.\n\nJapanese releases are more spread out through the year, with a small bump at the end of the year. January and May have few releases in all regions.\n\nHere is the overall month distribution of each region. I didn’t mark it but 8.33% is where the these bars would be if every month had an equal number of games. I’m not sure why March is so popular. It may get some games that were intended for September-November but got delayed, or maybe there is just a need to get games out before the slow spring and summer season. Japan has quite a large drop from December to January.\n\nThis is all of the month data. January 2000 in Europe was the slowest month in the years included in the study, just 1% of the games that year. On the other side of the spectrum, in North America one fourth of the releases in 1998 were during October.\n\nThat is all of the detailed date data I have for you. With this data set I was also able to learn a lot about how many games are released in different combinations of regions, and how long it takes for games to release outside of their home region, so please come back next month for part 2.\n\nSources\n\nWikipedia’s lists of games by system – for release dates\n\nMobyGames – for release dates\n\nSonic the Hedgehog 2 – information about Sonic 2sday\n\nHappy Sonic 2sday (almost) – more information about Sonic 2sday\n\nAl Nilsen – former Sega employee for the Sonic 2sday sticker image\n\nMore content\n\nThe first part of this project has some important context about how this study was conducted.\n\nI realized I had a lot of data I could find that wouldn’t really make for a good graph, and some trivia that didn’t fit anywhere. This is a more loosely structured post, so please forgive the abrupt changes of subject.\n\nMore on Metascores\n\nThe day with the most games released with a 90+ metascore was, well, a two way tie.\n\nFebruary 29th, 2000\n\nDead Or Alive 2 (Dreamcast)\n\nTony Hawk’s Pro Skater (N64)\n\nRayman 2: The Great Escape (Dreamcast)\n\nResident Evil: Code Veronica (Dreamcast)\n\nNovember 18th, 2001\n\nStar Wars Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader (Gamecube)\n\nMadden NFL 2002 (Gamecube)\n\nIL2-Sturmovik (PC)\n\nTony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 (Gamecube)\n\nGreat days for Dreamcast and Gamecube. Wow, Dreamcast had 7 games release on Leap Day, and Chu Chu Rocket was pretty close to the 90+ club.\n\nThe greatest drought between games with a 90+ metascore was… ok, I was going to say between Realms of the Haunting and Dungeon Keeper, but in double checking I have now found 3 possible release dates for Realms and the one I have recorded is probably wrong.\n\nLet’s instead go with Out of the Park Baseball (3/23/06) and Company of Heroes (9/13/06), a period of 174 days. Remember how 2006 saw that dip in metascores?\n\nTwo games, one name, two developers, one score.\n\nMore on Descriptors\n\nAre you ready for more content descriptor details? The game with the most descriptors I could find was 9, and it’s not something you would expect:\n\nI didn’t get into this before, but the ESRB combines substance descriptors if they’re both “use” or both “reference” for some reason. Not sure any game has all three. That was a bit of a pain to deal with.\n\nAnyway, I have no idea why this singing game has so many, and oddly enough the Switch version only has 8, no Partial Nudity.\n\nSeveral other games had 8 descriptors, most are current generation:\n\nConstructor Plus (Switch, 3DS, PS4)\n\nBlood, Crude Humor, Drug Reference, Language, Suggestive Themes, Use of Alcohol, Use of Tobacco, Violence\n\nConstructor HD (Xbox One, PS4)\n\nBlood, Crude Humor, Drug Reference, Language, Suggestive Themes, Use of Alcohol, Use of Tobacco, Violence\n\nNight in the Woods (Switch, PS4, Xbox One, PC)\n\nFantasy Violence, Mild Blood, Sexual Themes, Drug Reference, Language, Crude Humor, Use of Alcohol, Use of Tobacco\n\nThe Red Strings Club (Switch)\n\nBlood, Drug Reference, Nudity, Strong Language, Suggestive Themes, Use of Alcohol, Use of Tobacco, Violence\n\nThimbleweed Park (Switch, PS4, Xbox One, PC)\n\nCrude Humor, Drug Reference, Language, MildBlooo, MildVio, Sexual Themes, Use of Alcohol, Use of Tobacco\n\nDef Jam Rapstar (Wii, PS3, Xbox 360)\n\nDrug Reference, Mild Blood, Mild Violence, Partial Nudity, Sexual Themes, Strong Lyrics, Use of Alcohol, Use of Tobacco\n\nGrand Theft Auto V (PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PC)\n\nBlood and Gore, Intense Violence, Mature Humor, Nudity, Strong Language, Strong Sexual Content, Use of Drugs, Use of Alcohol\n\nDuke Nukem Forever (PS3, Xbox 360, PC)\n\nBlood and Gore, Intense Violence, Mature Humor, Nudity, Strong Language, Strong Sexual Content, Use of Drugs, Use of Alcohol\n\nSkylight Freerange (Vita)\n\nViolence, Blood, Sexual Themes, Nudity, Drug Reference, Strong Language, Use of Alcohol, Use of Tobacco\n\nSkylight Freerange 2 (Vita)\n\nViolence, Blood, Sexual Themes, Nudity, Drug Reference, Strong Language, Use of Alcohol, Use of Tobacco\n\nThe only game with both Mild Fantasy Violence and Mild Cartoon Violence was Xbox Live Arcade Unplugged Vol. 1. Okay, a compilation, but it doesn’t seem like there should be a reason those don’t ever appear together otherwise.\n\nThe only game with Nudity and Simulating Gambling was Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball.\n\nI had to check the box to make sure it wasn’t an error on the ESRB website. But yes, Loons has two degrees of violence. I don’t think any other game I looked at had two “tiers” of something. I have to imagine it was a mistake.\n\nIs there any actual content differences between these versions? I believe the Vita version was released before the “rate it yourself for cheaper” program.\n\nI’m again not familiar with these two games, but could the Cartoon Violence really be significantly more major in one version? Usually when a game is released on multiple platforms, even months apart, it gets one entry if they have the same content. Maybe for some reason different people handled these two and had different opinions?\n\nFantasy Violence wasn’t a descriptor when the original was released, so fair enough there, but that is quite a difference in descriptors.\n\nMore on the ESRB Website and ESRB Weirdness\n\nThis game was known as Speedster in Europe, and Rush Hour in North America. Why does a North American rating system website have the European title at all? This was the only two name case like this I came across.\n\nReleased on “Nintendo”, I came across a few of those.\n\nI was pretty confused by this when I saw it, but I found an article where the creator discusses what and why he tones down the Wii U version.\n\nShould a crossword game where the clues are a bit off-color (this actually sounds extreme for a newspaper puzzle) count as much as if there were actual characters engaging in these acts? It’s a bit of an edge case. It’s also funny that they censored “ass” on this website aimed at adult parents.\n\nThe ESRB’s website will ignore spaces when searching titles. Finding the rating of a Playstation game called “One” was quite an experience. It was on something like the 37th page (results are chronological) and you can only go forward one page at a time. You can filter by system, but only for some newer systems because why would would anyone care about something old.\n\nIf you were wondering why I didn’t just look at a picture of One’s case on eBay, I did. Games are supposed to list their descriptors on the back, below the ESRB rating, but this one didn’t.\n\nThis My Little Pony game doesn’t have any ESRB information at all on the back. I can’t find much information about game box art requirements, like what size things have to be, where they need to be placed, just “in June 2003 — the ESRB announced new labeling procedures (requiring the prominent display of back-of-the-box information)“, which is odd since the overwhelming majority of games already had that. I suppose publishers handle box art, but there is still enough structure to them that they must have a lot of requirements.\n\nAfter a bit of browsing, I found this E.T. game for Game Boy Advance without any ESRB information on the back.\n\nThe Best, worst and Most Average game\n\nI realized that with all of the data I have that I can construct what would theoretically be the best and worst game possible, based on averages. This is a for fun exercise, please don’t take it too seriously.\n\nThe worst possible game, based on average metascores:\n\nSystem: Wii\n\nRelease Date: August 4th, 2007\n\nGenre: Educational\n\nESRB Rating: Everyone (Early Childhood games don’t even get ratings so I won’t assume)\n\nESRB Content Descriptors: None\n\nLength: As short as possible, definitely less than 4.5 hours to beat\n\nThe best possible game, based on average metascores:\n\nSystem: Xbox One\n\nRelease Date: December 28, 2019\n\nGenre: Role-Playing and Compilation\n\nESRB Rating: Mature\n\nESRB Content Descriptors: Sexual Content, Nudity, Use of Tobacco, Use of Alcohol, Use of Drugs, Intense Violence, Blood and Gore\n\nLength: As long as possible, at least 15 hours to beat\n\nThat best possible game sounds a bit like a Mass Effect trilogy compilation, which has been rumored as of this writing (May 9th).\n\nMost average game, based on average metascores:\n\nSystem: Game Boy Color\n\nRelease Date: February 3, 2010\n\nGenre: Simulation\n\nESRB Rating: E10+\n\nESRB Content Descriptors: Crude Humor\n\nLength: 7.5 hours to beat\n\nIgnoring system, but considering proximity to the actual average score of 70.25, we might label The Urbz: Sims in the City to be the most average game of the past 25 years. It doesn’t quite fit every parameter, but nothing will. I’m sure there’s better ways of finding “most average” than looking at what parameters line up in the middle of metascores, too.\n\nThat’s all for the 25 year project. Is there a specific thing that I could find quickly with the information I have that you’re curious about?\n\nSources\n\nGameRankings.com for metascores and some release dates. Archives: 1, 2, 3\n\nMobyGames.com for genres, some release dates, some ESRB ratings, and some ESRB content descriptors\n\nHowLongToBeat.com for main story and completionist times.\n\nESRB.org for ESRB ratings and ESRB content descriptors\n\nWikipedia for its many lists of games\n\nContent Descriptors Background\n\nThe first part of this project has some important context about how this study was conducted.\n\nThe ESRB does not just give games ratings, it also uses content descriptors to more specifically describe content that consumers may find objectionable. Very similar, appearing in the same place as content descriptors on the back of game boxes, are also “Interactive Elements” that describe online features that consumers may want to know about before buying a game, such as In-Game Purchases or Shares Location. I did not include interactive elements in this study.\n\nI find these content descriptors so interesting for two reasons. One, because it’s a look at how an organization tries to organize and sort thousands of games based largely on what parents might not want their children to be exposed to, and two, because it’s a formal description of what kind things happen inside a game. No one else is going to make a list of games that have “Cartoon Violence, but it’s pretty mild” but a ratings agency.\n\nBy my count there have been 49 content descriptors used during the life of the ESRB. Several have been retired. A couple seem to be “retired” in that they have been replaced with other descriptors but have been used a few times since their retirement, perhaps in error. Two, as far as I can tell, have never been used.\n\nSome Adult Assistance May Be Needed shows up on many lists of content descriptors, including Wikipedia’s, but does not appear on the ESRB’s list of descriptors, though presumably it did at some point. These lists say that it is exclusive to Early Childhood games. MobyGames claims a single game has received this descriptor, Disney’s Little Einsteins. This game is rated Everyone, not Early Childhood. The ESRB’s page for the game says it has no descriptors. GameFAQ’s scans of the box also show no descriptors.\n\nReal Gambling, used for games where real money is exchanged while gambling, is listed on the ESRB’s list of descriptors, but I can find no evidence it has ever been used. You may be aware that Peak Entertainment Casinos is the only game to receive an Adults Only rating for having real gambling, and that is true. However, it has the content descriptor “Gambling”, a descriptor that was retired, seemingly split into Simulated Gambling and Real Gambling. The Gambling descriptor was also used for Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball, which only features gambling for in-game currency.\n\nThere are many descriptors with “mild” prefixes, but the ESRB does not acknowledge these as separate descriptors from the non-prefixed versions (except for the substance ones, which are worded differently), on their website, but do list the “strong” prefixed versions.\n\nThe ESRB categorizes content descriptors, but I did not realize this before I had already categorized them myself. The only difference ended up being that I put blood and violence in the same category, and I included retired descriptors.\n\nESRB Content Descriptors – Distribution\n\nI’m starting with this mammoth chart so I can list all of the descriptors and their approximate dates of use. You’ll notice some descriptors used once or twice and then not used for years before being used regularly, like Tobacco Reference appearing in one game, 4 years before any other substance reference descriptor appeared.\n\nI looked it up and that game was Commandos: Beyond the Call of Duty (an expansion pack, but a standalone one, so it counts). If you go to ESRB.org (where I got most of my ESRB information) and search for that game, you’ll see this:\n\nBut if you go to Steam, where it is currently for sale, you’ll see this:\n\nSo, which is correct? The Steam listing has “Animated Violence”, one of those “retired but not” descriptors, which makes it look much older than the ESRB one. It’s possible Steam used the game’s old, original ESRB rating for some reason (the back of the box seems to confirm this was the original rating), and then the game got re-rated by the ESRB some time later. Why would the game get re-rated if if not for the Steam release, though?\n\nI spent at least 20 minutes putting together the evidence for this one specific game and I still don’t know what should “count”. The ESRB website has a lot of odd conflicting information and I didn’t have the will to double check and investigate every single one.\n\nFurthering my point that it’s very hard to determine the history of descriptors let’s look at MobyGame’s list of games with Animated Violence. One game in 2018, one in 2011, a handful until 2003, and then dozens every year before that. The ESRB’s content descriptor list in February 2004 doesn’t mention it, but a list from February 2001 has it under “discontinued content descriptors”. And yet that MobyGames list has dozens of uses of the descriptor in 2001 and 2002! And looking at that ESRB page from 2001 page I am seeing for the first time the descriptor “Reading Skills, Fine Motor Skills, Higher-Level Thinking Skills”. Searching for that exact phrase in Google right now returns 25 results, all pretty much verbatim copies of that outdated list, no games mentioned as using it, so I guess that’s three never used descriptors. No one has found it interesting enough to discuss until now, either. I have really been down a rabbit hole on this subject.\n\nSo, as I discuss when these descriptors began and ended I will be ignoring some outliers. If nothing is stated, then the descriptor has been in continuous use since the start of this study, in 1995.\n\nSubstances\n\nAlcohol Reference – Started in 2003 with the other [Substance] Reference descriptors\n\nUse of Alcohol\n\nDrug Reference – Started in 2003 with the other [Substance] Reference descriptors\n\nUse of Drugs – Started in 2002, it seems odd it took longer than Alcohol and Tobacco.\n\nTobacco Reference – Started in 2003 with the other [Substance] Reference descriptors\n\nUse of Tobacco\n\nViolence\n\nAnimated Blood – Animated in these descriptors means “cartoony”, not that it is moving.\n\nAnimated Blood and Gore – Probably meant to be retired in 2002, but has popped up once in a while since then.\n\nMild Animated Violence – Probably meant to be retired in 2002, but has popped up once in a while since then.\n\nAnimated Violence – Probably meant to be retired in 2002, but has popped up once in a while since then.\n\nMild Blood – Probably started in 2006, that was the first year I have with more than one use.\n\nBlood – Started in 1997, or I just got very unlucky with my small number of games from 1995 and 1996.\n\nRealistic Blood – Stopped being seen after 2000, the other “Realistic” descriptors were last seen in 2001.\n\nBlood and Gore\n\nRealistic Blood and Gore – This may have been intended as a stronger version of Blood and Gore because they coexisted, but last seen in 2001.\n\nMild Cartoon Violence – Started 2003.\n\nCartoon Violence – Started 2003. One of “4” (they didn’t include mild versions as separate, so it should be 6) new descriptors announced in June 2003.\n\nMild Fantasy Violence – Started 2003.\n\nFantasy Violence – One of the “4” new descriptors announced in June 2003. I have several from before then, somehow.\n\nIntense Violence – One of the “4” new descriptors announced in June 2003.\n\nMild Realistic Violence – Discontinued in 1996 or 1999.\n\nRealistic Violence – Gone after 2001.\n\nMild Violence\n\nViolence\n\nViolent References – Began in 2007.\n\nHumor and Mischief\n\nComic Mischief\n\nCrude Humor – Probably started use in 2003, although never got a press release like the “4” did.\n\nMature Humor – Probably started use in 2003. Likely a “Strong” version of Crude Humor as we’ll see later.\n\nEducational\n\nEdutainment – Last seen in 2008.\n\nInformational – Last seen 2001.\n\nGambling\n\nSimulated Gambling – Started in 2004.\n\nGambling – In use 2000-2004, probably split into Simulated Gambling and the never seen Real Gambling.\n\nGaming – Last seen 2000. Seems to have been replaced with the short lived Gambling. This word is occasionally used as a way to say “gambling” but feels a bit old fashioned, perhaps due to the rise of video and computer games.\n\nLanguage\n\nMild Language\n\nLanguage – Either started in 1998, or I got unlucky with my sample. MobyGame’s list makes it look like it may have indeed started then. It would be odd if it was introduced after its Mild and Strong versions.\n\nStrong Language\n\nMild Lyrics – Introduced in 2001.\n\nLyrics – Seemingly introduced in 2004, also after its Mild and Strong versions.\n\nStrong Lyrics – Introduced in 2001.\n\nSexual Content\n\nPartial Nudity – First used 2001, maybe 2002.\n\nNudity – First used 2002.\n\nSexual Content – First used 2008, or maybe 2006.\n\nStrong Sexual Content – Probably around for 25+ years. Oddly, I have no 2019 games with this after a 17 year run.\n\nMild Sexual Themes – Introduced 2008, significantly after its non-prefixed version.\n\nSexual Themes – I’m inclined to think this started in 2004, if not then it’s an odd case of a descriptor suddenly rocketing up in use.\n\nMature Sexual Themes – Last used 2004. It’s possible this was replaced with Sexual Themes, which seems like maybe a way to downplay it.\n\nSexual Violence – This is so rare it’s hard to say. Only seen in 2014. In fact, it was only seen in one game in this study, which was ported to 4 systems: Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes.\n\nMild Suggestive Themes – Began use in 2004.\n\nSuggestive Themes\n\nAlright, now I can get to the graphs I usually start with. Please note the Y-axis of these graphs, some categories of descriptors are much more common than others. Alcohol is the most common substance overall and drugs the least. There seems to be more and more smoking in video games over time, quite the opposite of the movie industry.\n\nIt’s odd how Animated Violence was semi-retired just as Violence took off (but it did already exist). They are distinct things so it wasn’t a replacement.\n\nA sharp decline in Comic Mischief after a huge spike. I have to wonder how the raters are trained on this kind of thing, do they just read a list of descriptors? Has the public perception of what is Comic Mischief changed over time, or have game developers decided to employ it less than a tenth as often as they did a decade ago?\n\nTwo very rarely used descriptors that haven’t been seen in a long time. Informational is an odd one, it was for games with reference material, data, that kind of thing. The only games I have using it were Need for Speed: Porsche Unleashed, Virtual Kasparaov, Timeline, and Timescape: Journey to Pompeii.\n\nIt took a few tries, but the ESRB eventually decided what term to use. Gambling is pretty low overall, perhaps PEGI (the European equivalent of the ESRB) standards for games with gambling influenced developers worldwide.\n\nIt took a while before technology allowed the playing of music with potentially objectionable lyrics, but it’s never been very common. I wonder if the shift towards real voice clips over text influenced the rise of bad language.\n\nMany of these descriptors sound similar. Aren’t they all “Sexual Content”, why is that a separate descriptor? This article is a good overview of how all of these differ. Mild Suggestive Themes was sure big for a while, but then drastically fell in use.\n\nI see now that the long bar graph is missing Alcohol Reference, sorry about that. Violence is by far the most common descriptor used, with Blood at #2 with just over half as many uses . Four ports of Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes makes Sexual Violence the second rarest descriptor. But the rarest, Mild Realistic Violence, was only seen in Noir: A Shadowy Thriller and Professional Bull Rider.\n\nOverall, all kinds of violence dominate games.\n\nHere is how common every combination of descriptors is. The white cells are the overall percent of games that have that descriptor, and then the pink cells at the bottom are what percent of games have that descriptor as their sole descriptor.\n\nIt’s safe to say that games have added more and more things to warn about over time, but the ESRB has also expanded what kinds of things they have descriptors for over time. Referring to substance use wasn’t deemed worthy of note until 2003, for instance. I’m sure a number of games released before then would have qualified.\n\nThis graph fits pretty well with the general trends of more descriptors over time, and how descriptors relate to ESRB ratings, which we’ll look at later.\n\nESRB Content Descriptors + Metascores\n\nThe better a game is, the more content descriptors it has on average, with quite a jump in the highest tier. Do you think people are more satisfied the more realistic the violence, the more graphic the sexual content?\n\nGames with Sexual Content are more liked than games with any other descriptor. Yet Strong Sexual Content doesn’t do quite as well. Sex in general is a pretty strong indicator of quality, remember that the overall metascore average is 70.25, every sex descriptor is above that. The three substance use descriptors are very close in scores and above average, but merely referring to those same substances scores several fewer metascore points.\n\nSimulated Gambling, perhaps an in-game casino, really seems to turn off reviewers. Cartoon Violence may be so low due to being common in cheap licensed games or just kiddie fare in general. Referring to violence is evidently less satisfying than seeing it.\n\nESRB Content Descriptors + Genres\n\nIn some genres a substance will be alluded to more often than used, and in other genres it’s the other way around. Makes sense for the narrative genres to have more substance descriptors in general.\n\nRole-Playing heavily favors Fantasy Violence due to usually being have some kind of magical or supernatural combat. Compilations have the most Cartoon Violence for some reason.\n\nAgain, please note the Y-axis on these graphs will change. Action really favors Crude Humor over Comic Mischief. Not a single Educational, Puzzle, or Simulation game had Mature Humor.\n\nNo surprise that Educational games have educational descriptors.\n\nIt’s odd that a genre as general as Action is so low in gambling compared to others. I don’t associate Compilations with gambling, I have no idea why that is so high.\n\nThe lyrics descriptors more or less work as an indication of how much English language licensed music appears in games, very rarely in Role-Playing, but fairly often in Sports. Simulation includes the likes of Rock Band, so that’s why it has such a showing for lyrical content.\n\nI’m baffled as to why Racing / Driving has the highest rates of Nudity. Role-Playing games overall rank pretty high when it comes to sexual descriptors, while Educational, Puzzle, and Sports games are decidedly unsexy.\n\nRole-Playing attracts a lot of potential content descriptors, Compilation’s high number makes sense, every game can add a few more.\n\nAll that Genre + Descriptor data in a chart.\n\nESRB Content Descriptors + Game Lengths\n\nThe longer a game is the more descriptors it has on average.\n\nESRB Content Descriptors + ESRb Ratings\n\nThe two (of 22) Early Childhood games with descriptors had Edutainment descriptors. There were only two Adults Only games included, but there’s also only a few dozen ever published. Steady increases in descriptors as rating become more severe.\n\nGames rated Everyone rarely have any sexual or substance descriptors, and the violence tends to be fantasy or cartoon based. About 11 descriptors appear in more than 2% of E rated games.\n\nFantasy Violence suddenly becomes much more prevalent with E10+ games. More descriptors in general, 20 over 2%.\n\nViolence now rockets up in use. Only slightly more descriptors used above 2% of the time, 21.\n\nBlood and Gore and Strong Language now become much more prevalent. Only 18 descriptors used over 2% of the time. Teen games seem to employ the largest variety of descriptors, although it’s pretty close and 2% was an arbitrary cut off.\n\nAnd here is how common every descriptor is with every rating. I wonder if the ESRB has hard rules for which descriptors can be used with which ratings. It would make sense for a game with Use of Drugs to not be allowed less than a Teen rating, but is there a rule against Mild Fantasy Violence in a Mature rated game, or has there just not been any (any in this study, at least) games that have done that?\n\nAnd that’s all my graphs and charts for content descriptors. There will be one more bonus post before the next project. It will have some trivia and odd things I found in the course of making all this.\n\nSources\n\nGameRankings.com for metascores and some release dates.
