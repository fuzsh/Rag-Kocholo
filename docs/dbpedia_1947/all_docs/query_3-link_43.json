        "text": "As I commented, the story of the film only loosely has ideas from the game like the setting and some characters.\n\nJudging solely from my experience playing the game and the summary from Wikipedia, there are many more differences than I realized.\n\nTo start, the prince is nameless in the game, and he is an actual prince, not an orphan brought into the king's court, nor does he have any siblings at all, nor does he have a princess selected out. In fact, the girl you meet in the game is but a lowly citizen that you meet during the adventure who in turn, helps you to complete the game.\n\nThe reason his father dies in the game is because, after raiding a city, they loot the Sands of Time containing the Dagger of Time. The kingdom is then betrayed by the Vizier. He tricks the prince into releasing the sands, killing almost everyone around the kingdom by turning them into fearsome sand beasts, including your father. The entire plot of the game revolves around collecting enough of the Sands of Time in order for the Prince to revert time back to the moment he released them, and to stop this action in order to save his kingdom.\n\nInstead, the movie focuses on more of a plot of deception from within the kingdom. Dastan, who is essentially the Prince, is being betrayed by his Uncle Nizam for the throne. Nizam realizes that he can use the dagger to prevent the Prince from being the king of Persia.\n\nAs an addition to Tyler's answer, while the story, the locations, the characters and their particular relationships are different from the game, there are still many general similarities in the story development of both the movie and the video game, apart from the obvious presence of the \"Sand of Time\", the dagger and the \"Prince of Persia\" himself:\n\nSimilar to the movie the Vezier (though not being related to the Prince's family) more or less persuades the Prince's father to conquer a realm for more or less normal reasons (game: wealth and honor, movie: preemptive attack) just to secretly get his hands on the Sand of Time. The Prince in turn tries to impress his father, and steals the Dagger of Time during this attack (not knowing what it can do), much to the dismay of the Vezier's evil plans.\n\nOn his way to correct things (though in the game everybody is dead/evil and in the movie he is merely banned/wanted for betrayal), he meets a girl who in the end knows much more about the Sand and the Dagger. She wants to get her hands on it in order to correct things, while the Prince is rather stubborn, doesn't trust her and wants to do things his own way by keeping the dagger getting both into conflict.\n\nAt the end, they manage to find the source of the Sand of Time, and by reuniting it with the Dagger, turn back the time to the start of the adventure. The Prince gets the chance to prevent all those evil things happening, and just hints at the girl (who has no memory of her adventure in the other timeline) as to what actually happened.\n\nSo while the story is quite different, major plot elements along with the general personalities and relationships of the major characters are not that dissimilar between the movie and the game.\n\nAs per your production rite question, the answer is yes they brought the rights , As per Wiki statement-\n\nIn March 2004, the production company Jerry Bruckheimer Films sought to acquire feature film rights to the 2003 video game Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time with the film to be distributed by Walt Disney Pictures.\n\nAnd giving attribute to game depends on the agreement terms and condition. And I think their is no need to give attribute if you brought the full rights.\n\nThe movie is just loosely based on the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and Elements from Prince of Persia: Warrior Within and Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones are also incorporated in it.\n\nMechner, in writing the script, re-conceived the storyline to shift the perspective from the interactive one experienced by video gamers to the non-interactive experience by film audiences. The screenwriter left out elements of the Prince of Persia video games Warrior Within and The Two Thrones and did not anticipate including these elements in the film's possible sequels. (source)\n\nRather then explaining all the differences, we can only say that its story retelling by just taking some of characters but with different origin stories and little different situation. They removed the context of sand storm and monster and just made the movie full of more human rather the sand monsters. Other major differences are the death of king in different way, completely different princess story (princess is a prisoner in the game), Vezir's have no relation to king in the game, an extra character brother of prince and different love story too. In the game prince doesn't trust the princess because of the wrong treatment to her by his own kingdom and she earned the trust later in the game."
