        "text": "#12 - Remember Me (PS3)\n\nReally loved the aesthetics of the game and appreciated the French dub, but the subtitle work was ho-hum and the game had its fair share of other problems.\n\nI think the biggest was the combat system, where they tried to add depth by allowing you to customize three canned combos with an array of moves that dish out more damage, heal you, regenerate your ability to do special attacks, or multiply the effect of the previous move. In practice, the difference between moves in each category is negligible. The interface for customizing the combos is more catered toward style than function, making trips back to the screen more of a chore than they should be. In the end, the combat never really elevates itself beyond the depth of Batman or Captain America and certainly doesn't flow remotely as well as either one of them. In addition, there's two or three annoying spikes in the difficulty throughout the game due solely to the combat mechanics.\n\nPlatforming is very bare bones as well, with little sense of exploration opportunities. While there's a decent number of collectables to find, the camera system ensures that if you want to find all of them, you'll need to either use a walkthrough or very slowly trying to hop and force yourself out of the frame at every opportunity. Halfway through the game I just quit looking for upgrades after getting gated/autosaved out of being able to get a handful of earlier ones I had been hunting for.\n\nThe last bit that hurt the game for me was the final chapter in the storyline. While Call of Duty: Ghosts had an insultingly bullshit ending, Remember Me goes for a bafflingly illogical, bullshit ending. While the narrative beforehand had been decently interesting and engaging, the final chapter was god damned stupid.\n\nHonestly, it's not a game I would go out of my way to recommend to someone else. The developers had an interesting vision but lacked the capability to effectively execute it. I hope their future projects turn out better, because I loved their depiction of Neo Paris and its inhabitants.\n\n#11 - Game of Thrones (PS3)\n\nFor the most part, I really enjoyed Game of Thrones despite its obvious faults. Most reviews you see will point out the poor graphics, bad voice acting, and high frequency of bugs and they're all pretty spot on. Even the Lord Commander of the Night Watch's voice sounds unnaturally terrible, and he's voiced by the same dude that plays the role in the HBO series. Granted, there are some high points in the acting and eventually it'll grow on you (as is the case in almost all euro-RPGs), but they really set the bar low early on. George R. R. Martin's cameo (pretty much as himself) was a fun little bit of meta humor with a totally hammed up delivery. Some of his dialog during the cameo also gives a neat bit of insight into how he likes to craft his storylines and then goes on to poke fun at the seemingly slow-as-molasses pace he writes at. It was a nice mood lightener considering just how god damn grim and dark the rest of the storyline is.\n\nThe storyline works great as an organic extension of the established universe. The new characters feel like they belong, interactions with existing characters doesn't feel forced, and you'll get sucked punched with some fittingly wicked twists and turns along the way. It's a shame all of that effort wasn't put into a better game, but what's on the disc is playable enough if you approach it with tempered expectations and a bit of patience.\n\nFor instance, one of the annoying bugs is that if you trigger a cutscene while engaged in combat, enemies will continue to attack you while you go on like nothing is happening. I didn't die from it, but I lost a hell of a lot of health on multiple occasions. Cutscenes also occasionally utilize camera angles where a bulk of the frame is taken up by an ultra low res texture of a leaf or a super zoom in on someone's backside, and if you're allergic to collision detection bugs (like passing right through doors), you'll probably need to keep a hell of a lot of medication on hand. Another notable problem is the slow save/load times and generally buggy save system altogether (I had it crash while saving once, I've had it autosave in a broken state multiple times, and just the menu navigation process for saving is plagued with some really awful load times). Then there's the problem with the stat scaling, where you don't really feel like there's any meaningful difference between levels or incremental upgrades in weapons/armor/skills.\n\nReally, the whole game feels unfinished and unpolished, but I don't realistically think that Cyanide would have been capable of cleaning it up more prior to release. I'm just glad they got it in the state they did, because it's at the point where the gameplay only interferes with the story in a select few instances of out of place difficulty spikes. It's a difficult game to recommend, even though I personally ended up enjoying it quite a bit. The PC version tends to go for pretty cheap from time to time and comes with the DLC that'll never get release on the consoles in the US (seems like Atlus has distanced themselves from it), including the Beyond the Wall episode. If you've been able to overlook the faults in games like Gothic and Alpha Protocol and you're a fan of the Game of Thrones series, you'll probably find a lot to like about the game.\n\nI'm looking forward to tackling Of Orcs and Men later this year, which apparently utilizes the same combat system with a few light refinements. Heard lots of good things about that game. I'll be playing that one on PC and I'm debating on which platform to play Mars: War Logs on (since I think the console versions utilize the retranslation that makes the game a hell of a lot more understandable).\n\nGames Beaten In 2013\n\nLast Year: “Heck, in terms of more traditional sandbox games (you not, not like Fallout 3), the only one I played through this year was Driver: Parallel Lines (finally!). I think a goal for 2013 will be to try to tackle a few more of those and clean out the backlog a bit. We'll see. “\n\nWell, I didn't do as many as I had hoped, but I did manage to take down three notable sandbox titles: Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories (meh), Saints Row (ok), and Saints Row 2 (AWESOME). The real improvement this year was in how many RPGs I managed to play through: 16! That's twice what I did last year and while there were some repeats (Dark Souls again on 360 and then on PC, Mass Effect 1 and 2 on PS3 instead of PC this time, and the PS1 release of Tales of Phantasia), it was also the year I finally rekindled my interest in the MegaTen series with both Soul Hackers (which I've been wanting to play since the mid 90s) and Shin Megami Tensei IV (funky difficulty curve and all). Ton of fun with both of those.\n\nI also finally played Divine Divinity, which I've avoided for years because of its surface similarities to Diablo, but it really has a lot more in common with Baldur's Gate (aside from lacking a party). Absolutely top notch game experience that I can't recommend enough to a PC RPG fan looking for something fresh. In 2014 I hope to take on Divinity II (skipping Beyond Divinity due to terrible word of mouth and reviews) and Original Sin (which I totally backed on Kickstarter).\n\nIn total I was able to clear out 47 games this year, a bulk of which were natively on PS3 (14) and PC (11), both of which go up a bit further when you factor in emulation (+2 PS1 games on PS3, +5 PS2 games on PC, +1 PS1 game on PC).\n\nAverage review scores were up from the last few years, coming in at an average of about 80% according to the GameRankings aggregates. Review scores aren't everything (The Bureau received a paltry 61.9%, Liberty City Stories got a grossly overinflated 78.0%, and Call of Juarez- The Cartel bombed with a 45.9% despite being decent fun), but it's kind of neat to see how my completion list for the year sit with the critics.\n\nCollection sizes ramped up significantly for PS3 and PS2 this year as they are my primary collection platforms. New consoles added to the collection this year include a Wind Waker HD WiiU bundle, red 3DS XL, Link Between Worlds 3DS XL, and an Ouya.\n\nThe Ouya had some real promise but the botched execution and weak support from major publishers is seriously killing it. SquareEnix's android port of Final Fantasy III was fantastic on the platform, but it doesn't look like they have any plans to port over Final Fantasy IV or Final Fantasy Dimensions. About the only two games that see any action on the system anymore are Towerfall and Knightmare Tower, though to be fair I haven't attempted to wade through the awful storefront in months to see if anything else was worth trying. Oh, and I bought Shadowgun for the thing at one point based on the reviews it had gotten. Still haven't been able to force myself through it. It's pretty bad, and not in a tongue-in-cheek way.\n\nActually, as far as games released in 2013 go, I'm pretty happy with how many I was able to complete: 8+ (could go up to 11 or 12 depending on how you count). Not bad all all considering how bad the backlog is and how I typically put stuff off for a year or two.\n\nBreakdowns By System: 14 – PS3 11 – PC 05 – PS2 04 – 360 03 – 3DS 03 – Ouya 03 – PS1 02 – NDS 01 – Dreamcast 01 – Android Newest Game Beaten: Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds (November 22, 2013) Oldest Game Beaten: Arc the Lad (June 30, 1995) Modern Collections: NGC: 100 (+2) Wii: 80 (+14) WiiU: 6 (+6) NDS: 112 (+?) 3DS: 44 (+26) PS2: 706 (+64) PS3: 358 (+65) PSP: 95 (+5) Vita: 12 (+7) Xbox: 210 (+/- 0) 360: 134 (+9) Previous Years 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006\n\nRevisiting Demon's Souls\n\nDemon's Souls was an immensely disappointing game for me back in 2009, in part because of what it was hyped up to be and in part because of what I had previously experienced from other From Software games. I loved the combat system of the game, but the rest felt like an unfocused mess. It was in large because of this negative impression that I ignored Dark Souls until late 2012, a game that I wound up absolutely falling in love with and replaying multiple times (finished twice on 360, once on PC, multiple unfinished characters across all three platforms) and with a total playtime hovering around 180 hours.\n\nSince I just recently completed a lengthy run on the PC version (I'm working towards getting all 41 achievements before Games For Windows Live shuts down) and I've been killing time playing around with invading/defending around NewGame+, I decided it might be fun to go back and take a fresh look at Demon's Souls again to get a new perspective on it. I thought with my currently abilities to exploit systems in the game that perhaps it would mitigate the issues I had beforehand or that perhaps the issues I had before weren't really issues at all. Given that I couldn't sleep last night, 3:30am seemed like as good a time as any to get cracking on the project.\n\nGBA (20130705)\n\nWhile my GBA collection is rather small, I've always been really happy with the general quality of it. I directly attribute that to almost always sticking with just buying games that I first played through emulation (Back to Stone is an exception). Unfortunately, this led to some problems where I wasn't introduced to some other good games until it was way too late (Aria of Sorrow), resulting in me having a few loose carts (buying a sealed copy at that point was completely out of the budget).\n\nI think the most expensive game on the shelf was Ninja Five-O, for which I paid $39.48 shipped back in december of 2003. As pricey as it was, I almost passed on it, but it was already starting to get impossible to find in the wild and prices were slowly creeping up online. Took the plunge, got a sealed copy, and had a blast with it. Nowadays new copies move at over $200 while complete sets trade hands at around $150+.\n\nThe latest additions were the Shaman King titles, both of which were dirt cheap. Guess the license is going to keep them from ever becoming too collectable, but I thought they were pretty dang fun. But Back to Stone? Woops. Really wish I had tried it before I bought it. Came out at the same time as Mazes of Fate (excellent game, btw!). It didn't have a very high print run, but between the iffy gameplay and absence of any demand for it, new copies can still be picked up easily for about $10. Oh well.\n\nNGage (20130621)\n\nHere's a bit of an oddity...\n\nI remember seeing the commercials for Pathways to Glory and thinking, \"holy crap, this system may actually be neat\" and, you know, it really is. There's a couple of games that really leveraged the capabilities of the platform to extreme success.\n\nThe aforementioned Pathways to Glory was a remarkable turn based strategy game with a fantastic online component, Pocket Kingdoms was pretty much a spiritual successor to Dragon Force with some serious fourth wall breaking humor, Glimmeratti was a surprisingly entertaining racing game, and High Seize came out of nowhere to provide that Advance Wars-with-Pirates fix that you never knew you needed. Heck, it was also the home of Capcom's excellent port of Catan (which I prefer over the XBLA and iOS versions, believe it or not), a functional port of Civilization II (not up to snuff with CivRev, but still good), the unique Rifts RPG, and the fairly obscure Warhammer 40k strategy game, Glory in Death.\n\nSo sure, it may have been the butt of the played out sidetalking meme, the intial hardware design may have been terribly conceived, and it may have the single worst Call of Duty game that will likey ever be made (sadly not joking), but it's still a system worth looking at and one I'd love to experience through emulation at some point."
