        "text": "Well....damn you Cheapy D! A lifelong Nintendo owner and for some reason I couldn't resist the Overstock.com $360 for a 360 deal!\n\nSo....now I will need games, and being a true cheapass....I really want to avoid full-price games! Any suggestions for a fan of adventure and platform games (I do love me some Zelda and Mario) on games out for the 360 (or backwards compatible Xbox games) that might be fun for a Nintendo fan?\n\nI'm not a huge fan of first person shooters or sports titles.....but I gave in to the desire for a full-graphics-heavy system\n\nI'm looking for games that weren't also ported to the GC (i.e I already own Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy, Beyond Good and Evil)....\n\nThanks!\n\nOh, I am totally open to trying something new....which is why I am buying a 360 to begin with.\n\nThat said, I know from experience that sports games don't excite me because sports don't excite me! I have bought football and hockey games in the past and the controls just overwhelm me because I don't know the names of different passes and plays....it just becomes no fun.\n\nWith first person shooters....I know that in the past they have made me physically ill to my stomach (most early N64 games also did that to me)--something about the jerkiness of the play. I have been able to play Metroid Prime ok though....so maybe.\n\nI'm open to suggestions--but know that playing games with at least some elements I already know might make the transition easier. Moreover, if I am going to branch out--I want to do so with a really top-notch version of the genre. So, please suggest away!\n\n[quote name='Brak']Or you could try something new..?[/QUOTE]\n\nYou know, I frequent the DS/GBA board and we get these messages all the time there too....but people just indulge and answer. I've been amazed at how some people get so annoyed by it. I did do a look, but legitimately thought the Nintendo-angle was a little different than previous questions. Sigh. I was just being excited. Sorry.\n\nAnyway, thanks for the replies those who took the time.\n\nI thought Kameo was fantastic for the 10 hours it lasted. Didn't care to play it a second time with my rental, but I look forward to the rumored sequel.\n\nTry out all of the XBLA games. I'm sure you will like some of those.\n\nI think Fable is very cheap now, and it might fit into the kind of games you like. Give that a try.\n\nViva Pinata will come out late this year or next year, and it might also be good for you.\n\nOblivion, oblivion and oblivion. Forgive me for saying this, but I honestly don't think there are that many mega-must-have titles out there for 360 yet, and for you being a nintendo fan sure doesn't help the situation. Btw, Oblivion isn't anything nintendo alike, but it's just an awesome game.\n\nOn the other hand, since you are N fan assuming you don't have a xbox? My situation is similar, although i wasn't a nintendo exclusive person. I own a ps2, cube, most of the other console but NOT a xbox. Having a 360 was kinda exciting since i get to play NINJA GAIDEN BLACK. I always wanted to play that game and it sure didn't disapoint me. Very good action game, awesome grahpics.\n\nAnother backward compatible game I am planning to get soon is Jade Empire. Either when I finish oblivion, or when the game dropped down to 9.99\n\ni didn't like morrowind that much.. FP RPG didn't like it at all..\n\nBurnout is great if you like mario kart but don't want the wacky..\n\non the first xbox.. i like armed and dangerous (i don't know if its BC, if not, that thats way too bad) the KOTORs were good if you love star wars..\n\nI also liked the star wars battlefront games i don't know if they are BC or not yet, but those kinda reminded me of the pick up and play nintendo style..\n\nFusion Frenzy is great but only if you have 3-4 players playing it. i don't like it for single player or two player.\n\nThanks for the warning on Oblivion and Burnout. With all the high marks Oblivion gets, I think I'll have to try that one. Maybe it will be a good test for me Thanks also for the long list! I remember looking at Voodoo Vince when it came out and wishing it was on the Cube. Thanks for reminding me! Of course I will have to douclbe check which ones are actually backwards compatible D\n\n[quote name='Number83']19 posts and no one recommends Geometry Wars?\n\nBe careful with Burnout Revenge and Oblivion if you get motion sickness because of FPS. Although they're extremly smooth, it still might get to you.\n\nAs for the Original XBOX games most like Nintendo, I'm not sure all of them are BC, but they will be eventually...\n\n(Taken from my library)\n\nConker: Live and Reloaded\n\nMetal Arms\n\nOddworld Munch's Odyssee\n\nOut Run\n\nPitfall: Lost Expedition\n\nPsychonauts\n\nRobin Hood: Defender of the Crown\n\nScaler\n\nSid Meier's Pirates\n\nSudeki\n\nVoodoo Vince (Most underrated XBOX game)[/QUOTE]\n\nAgain, I want to give a hearty thanks to everyone who replied. It seems that Oblivion and Voodoo Vince are definites for me.....Burnout Revenge looks a lot fo fun too (I do have Burnout 2 on the Cube)...and now I have a nice long list to start me off with....something tells me I have an afternoon with Gamerankings.com in front of me\n\nI find it interesting no one suggested Halo. I mean I know I said I was not really into First Person shooters...but the way people seem so mad about it I thought for sure someone would say to try that! I might anyway just to see what all the fuss is about (although whether to try 1 or 2, I don't know).\n\nTHANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU\n\nEDIT: Darnitall! Apparently Voodoo Vince is not on the list of Backwards Compatible games. Neither is Project Snowblind, which a friend had given me! Oh well!\n\nSecond EDIT: WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I had no idea just how limited the backwards compatibility was! Almost none of the games people have suggested are on the 360 official list! I knew going in that it wasn't complete....I just hadn't realized how much that was the case!!! Oh well It's still exciting to get a new system in its first year! I've never done that before (well, not counting the DS).\n\nI'm a Nintendo fan too, a little Sony as well, not so much Xbox... being a fan of the big N's games, I also really enjoyed a couple on Xbox, namely Fable and Burnout. Burnout Revenge on Xbox 360 is amazing, and Fable is really great no matter where it's played, although it has some framerate issues at times on the 360.\n\nI play Xbox Live Arcade more than anything else. Outpost Kaloki, Geometry Wars, Hexic, Mutant Storm, Wik... it's all amazing.\n\nBurnout Revenge is definitely top pick from me. And suprisingly, Mario Kart 64 is the only other racer I like.\n\nKameo is an excellent game. I really enjoyed it a lot and it was originally planned to be released on the gamecube. It can be bought new for about $29.99 when on sale. It has great online co-op and very nice graphics and fun characters.\n\nAs for BC games Fable would be a great choice. I has a similar feel to the zelda series and was a fun quest.\n\nFuzion Frenzy is a fun party game with 4 player support.\n\nSphinx and the Cursed Mummy is another great game if you have not played it on other consoles\n\nStubbs the Zombie in Rebel without a Pulse is a very fun game. Also features two player co-op.\n\nLego Star Wars if you have not played it on other consoles\n\nPrince of Persia: The Sands of Time is another great game if you have not played it on other consoles\n\nThe Simpsons Hit and Run is another great game if you have not played it on other consoles\n\nVexx was ok and can be had for cheap\n\nThe Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction is another great game if you have not played it on other consoles\n\nBrerDan, I would also suggest you get a GameFly suscription, that way you can try different types of 360 games without having to actually buy them. I've had GF for over a year and have no complaints. If I like I game I get to keep it for less than MSRP.\n\nAs for games in particular, I would suggest Lord of the Rings BFME II. It's very similar to Age of Empires for PC, or somewhat similar to Pikmin.\n\nAs for Halo, I would definitely give it a try. Many ppl who didn't considered themselves FPS fans adore this game.\n\nAlso, a good way to start playing online matches and getting used to Xbox Live could be through UNO!"
