        "text": "Prince of Persia is one of the least frustrating games ever, because you can't die.\n\nConsider the scene above. Below our hero the Prince is a 100-foot drop onto some jagged rocks. If his bit of wall-running doesn't work out just right, he'll plummet straight down to his ... immediate salvation. Because his constant companion, gal pal Elika (in the background), will automatically save his ass and return him back to solid ground. You could not fail at Prince of Persia even if you tried.\n\nYes, there's something to be said for attempting to eliminate a player's frustration. And Prince of Persia, released Tuesday for PlayStation 3 (reviewed) and Xbox 360, is a largely pleasant and inoffensive experience. But its designers might have just thrown the baby out with the bathwater: They have eliminated the lows, but also the highs. It is free of frustration, but it is also free of joy.\n\nPrince is the latest reboot of the decades-old franchise that follows the adventures of an acrobatically gifted Persian hero who saves a princess by jumping over dangerous things. In what should now be considered irony, the original 1989 game was one of the most difficult action games of the era.\n\n2003's The Sands of Time was a critically acclaimed rebirth that shifted the gameplay into 3-D, and this new version largely borrows from that game's features: Climbing and jumping on columns, running on walls, and avoiding the moving obstacles that often get in the way of your daring circus act. In updating the game for the next generation of consoles, Ubisoft added some impressive new features, but lost others.\n\nThe singular visual style is beyond reproach. The use of cel-shading with realistic features has created something between cartoon and reality, with characters that deftly skirt the boundaries of the uncanny valley without simply becoming caricatures. There is very little plot, but hours of well-performed conversations between the Prince and Elika flesh out their own back stories and those of the evil characters. The environments are occasionally breathtaking.\n\nAnd all of this is tied together with some impressive stuff under the hood. Some have called this Prince of Persia an \"open world\" game. This is not quite correct. It's a series of rigidly linear levels connected seamlessly via short pathways. You'll see one loading screen when you start the game, and never again thereafter (unless you use the handy teleport feature to zip around).\n\nIt is an overwhelmingly impressive world, but when you begin attempting to interact with it, some of the glimmer fades. At first I began to notice that the majority of the times the Prince fell to his death, it was because he did something I wasn't expecting. He'll jump straight off a wall when you wanted to run on it, or flip to the opposite side of a column, then jump off it into nothing.\n\nIt was not long before I realized that I didn't have a lot of direct control over the Prince's actions, for two reasons. One, every button press put in motion some sort of lengthy canned animation that I couldn't cancel out of. If you press X to scale a wall, he doesn't leap up it instantly. He pauses a moment, jumps up, pauses again, then jumps up a little bit more. And if you press any other buttons during this sequence, nothing happens – until a second later, because the game queues up the button press and executes the action whether you still want it to happen – or not.\n\nAll this has the net result of making me feel disconnected from the Prince's actions. In Sands of Time (and in most action games, for that matter) I felt like the Prince and I were one being. In this game, I feel like I'm giving suggestions to him that he may or may not follow.\n\nEventually, I did learn when to press buttons and when to not hit anything – often, as it turns out, the best solution is to let the pre-scripted animations play and not touch the controller. Prince of Persia's efforts to eliminate death don't simply run to rescuing you at every turn. The game also makes sure the Prince is always jumping in the right direction, or that he'll always reach the next foothold no matter when you started your leap.\n\nOnce I mastered it, it felt like nothing so much as playing Dragon's Lair or a game based entirely around Quick Time Events, only with environmental cues instead of button prompts.\n\nHaving learned the ropes, I was faced with another eight hours of repetitive, challenge-free gameplay. By the time you've played the first two or three of Prince of Persia's 25 levels, you've seen the near entirety of what the game has to offer in terms of challenge. Every level is by and large a remix of things you've already done, with very few new twists.\n\nThe same goes for the combat, which has you fighting four different monsters six times each. It barely scales up in difficulty, and it's easy to defeat them because – remember – you can't die. (If the enemy somehow does manage get one over on you, all that happens is that he regains a bit of health.)\n\nThe Prince of Persia games have traditionally incorporated massive environmental puzzles that force you to stop and think. While there are a handful of them here, they too have been dulled down so as to provide a minimum of frustration – in short, they are almost entirely busy work.\n\nAs if that weren't enough, Prince of Persia also transparently attempts to stretch out the gameplay time: After you finish each level, you have to go back through it again collecting \"light seeds,\" which are scattered hither and yon purely for the purpose of making you repeat the things you've already done. The last time collecting a bunch of blue dots was fun was Pac-Man.\n\nBut you need the seeds, because they unlock new levels. Luckily, the game eases up after you pick up about 500 of them and you no longer need to go hunting to get to the game's end. Sadly, not even the final level changes things up significantly – it's just a perfunctory parade past everything you've done before, albeit with a neat visual twist for the final encounter.\n\nStill, I wanted to finish Prince of Persia – not only because I knew that I could without any struggle whatsoever, but because I genuinely liked the performances of the main characters, especially the Prince's lovable-asshole charm and gift for occasionally expressing exactly what I was thinking. And the music was beautiful. And the presentation is finely polished."
