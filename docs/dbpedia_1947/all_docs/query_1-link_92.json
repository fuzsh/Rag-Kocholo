        "text": "Introduction\n\nFIFA 10, also known as FIFA Soccer 10, was developed by Electronic Arts (EA) Canada and released by EA worldwide in different regions of the world from 2nd October. This is the 17th label in the EA FIFA series of soccer game series and is available for PlayStation 2 and 3, Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows, and Nintendo’s Wii. Portable editions were also released for the iPhone, Nintendo DS, PlayStation Portable (PSP), and mobile phones.\n\nFIFA 10 is an improvement of its predecessor, FIFA 09, and gives the players a new level of game control through enhanced gameplay responsiveness, individual team settings, pre-match scouting news, advanced goalkeeping tactics, and a new Russian league. Upon its release, FIFA 10 was given high approval ratings by various game review agencies such as Metacritic, GameRankings, and IGN UK, it even ranked higher than its closest competitor, Konami Pro-Evolution Soccer 2010 (Konami PES 2010). The game features 31 leagues with more than 500 teams.\n\nDiscussion\n\nFIFA 10 addressed numerous issues and criticisms that had arisen in its previous versions, some of the features unique to this title are discussed below.\n\nGameplay\n\nFIFA 10 features a more complex ball control and improved physical interactions among players; it offers gamers a 360-degree control and this was its major giving (Bramwell, para. 3). A gamer can make runs, shots, and passes precisely; greater ball control is partly due to the improved ball physics. A new feature, the ‘Total Football Experience’ was added to this edition and allows players to access football news from all the clubs participating in a tournament or league.\n\nA player can use an ‘Assistant Manager’ to prepare his team for upcoming matches, for example, if the next match pits the team against a strong opponent, he will choose the most outstanding players. Pre-season friendlies have been added to some versions of this edition and give the manager a chance to prepare the team for the upcoming league season.\n\nWhen a player chooses to simulate a game, the results are based on the team’s strengths unlike in earlier editions where the scores were randomly assigned. Many improvements were made in the gameplay regarding minor offenses, for example, unintended handballs and players making tackles after the ball has been released can go unpunished. This was not possible in FIFA 09. Besides, the referee may play an advantage in case of these fouls and the game is only halted when a player is seriously hurt. Quick free kicks are also a feature of FIFA 10. Other game modes include ‘Be a Pro’ and ‘Virtual Pro’, other worthy features include the ‘Player Experience and Growth System’ and ‘Live Season’. Generally, FIFA 10 is easier to play and more enjoyable than the earlier editions due to these additional gameplay options.\n\nRealism\n\nFIFA 10 scores highly in its attempt to make the gameplay close to the real action. The main one is the ability of a player to dribble in a 360-degree manner unlike in earlier titles where the players were limited to an eight-point axis that limited their ability to move in any direction. Ball physics have been enhanced, loop and through balls can be played very precisely as the ball moves as expected, passes and spin shots too are accurate (Leyton, 2009, para. 4).\n\nPlayer capabilities have been minimized to acceptable levels, for example, in previous editions, a tall player, such as Peter Crouch, who struck a header in the box score, or a top-notch striker scored in most cases where he was on a one-to-one with the keeper. FIFA 10 developers understood that not all headers by tall players will go in as the player may be under pressure and may head wide or the keeper might block it. The top-notch striker might also encounter a good keeper or fail to gain proper control of the ball, thus failing to score. Long-range or last-minute goals are also rare (Yin-Poole, 2009, para. 4).\n\nAnother realism feature is the visuals, the likenesses of the players, stadia, and spectators are very strong albeit with a few mistakes as in the case of Luka Modrich. Player movements too are very swift and devoid of jerky movements as in PES 10, there is a slight delay when a player turns due to practical momentum that comes into play. Ball passing is also real as the ball makes contact with the player, when playing previous FIFA editions and PES 10, it is common to see a player pass the ball at an impossible angle (Bramwell, 2010. para. 7).\n\nFIFA 10 has a highly refined audio system, for example, the drumming by the spectators is heard and commentary is rarely repeated. However, on the flipside, there is a lack of reaction to closely missed chances or when the referee books a player.\n\nFlaws in FIFA 10\n\nDespite the many praises heaped upon this game, it suffers some weaknesses. It is common to see a player like Rooney, with his low center of gravity and great stamina, easily pushed off the ball by a lean right back, or a big-bodied player tackles a small striker such as Arshavin viciously but the referee does not intervene. FIFA 10 performs poorly on close-up details of players, as there is little facial detail (Squiddo, 2010, para. 10). A lack of consistency is evident in the various versions of this game as FIFA 10 played on a PC lacks the realism that is exhibited when the game is played on XBOX 360 and PS3 (Ahearn, 2009, para. 8). The lack of reaction by the spectators on crucial decisions is also a shortcoming. However, these are minor details and one is bound to enjoy the game on any platform.\n\nConclusion\n\nEA Canada did excellent work in the development of this game by perfecting the procedure laid down when the game first came out and as a result, this is one of the most enjoyable games on any platform. The improvements might seem little on this paper but on the console, it is a different experience altogether; the minute improvements work together to produce a beautiful game experience that is bound to engage the gamer for one-to-many hours. The numerous modes enable the gamer to approach FIFA 10 from many different perspectives, besides, the addition of more leagues to this latest edition means there is more to be played. As game lovers enjoy FIFA 10, they can only ask themselves whether EA Sports will keep up to its standards in the forthcoming titles. Improving on the current version is going to be a great challenge.\n\nReference List\n\nAhearn, N. FIFA 10 Review. Web.\n\nBramwell, T.(2009). FIFA 10. Web.\n\nLeyton, C. (2009).
