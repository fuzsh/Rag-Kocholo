        "text": "Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones is a 2005 action-adventure game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and Ubisoft Casablanca, and published by Ubisoft for the PlayStation 2, GameCube, Microsoft Windows, Xbox and Java (mobile phones only). It was later ported to the PlayStation Portable and Wii in 2007 under the title Prince of Persia: Rival Swords.[1] The Wii version utilizes the motion-sensing functionality of its controller, while the PSP version added exclusive content and local multiplayer.\n\nThe Two Thrones is the sixth main installment of the Prince of Persia series, and the final chapter of the Sands of Time trilogy, but is not the last game to be set in its continuity. The story follows the Prince as he returns to his home in Babylon, only to find that his actions in Warrior Within have undone the events of The Sands of Time. The villainous Vizier is back from the dead and kills the Prince's companion Kaileena, absorbing the Sands of Time from her, which transform him into an immortal monster. Now, the Prince must work together with his past love Farah (whom he meets for the first time in this new timeline) to defeat the Vizier once and for all, while also struggling against his own Dark Prince persona, which is slowly corrupting him."
