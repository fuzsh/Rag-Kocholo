I decided to start with the top 60 on gamerankings.com (minimum 10 reviews, sorted by top site scores). I've also tried to remove all the games with \"evolutionary\" releases... there's not much of a reason to own Madden 2002, 2003, and 2004 if 2007 is going to be released soon for the Wii. I would think the same applies for *most* fighting, racing, and puzzle games... Why play Tony Hawk 1 when you can play Tony Hawk 4?\n\nOn the other hand, Zelda OoT is very different than Zelda Wind Waker. Both can be in a collection and enjoyed simultaneously. In other words... which games do you think will \"stand the test of time\"? Would you add / remove anything from the list below?\n\n1. Metroid Prime\n\n2. Resident Evil 4 - Coming Soon to Wii\n\n4. Zelda Wind Waker\n\n5. Zelda Collector's Edition\n\n8. Metroid Prime 2\n\n9. Viewtiful Joe\n\n10. Prince of Persia: Sands of Time\n\n12. Super Mario Sunshine\n\n17. Resident Evil 1\n\n18. Eternal Darkness\n\n24. Rogue Squadron 2\n\n26. Timesplitters 2\n\n29. F-Zero GX\n\n30. Pikmin 2\n\n35. Beyond Good and Evil\n\n38. Paper Mario: Thousand Year Door\n\n44. Mario Kart Double Dash\n\n46. Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell\n\n47. Animal Crossing\n\n48. Pikmin\n\n53. Tales of Symphonia\n\n54. Fire Emblem Path of Radiance\n\n56. Metal Gear Solid The Twin Snakes\n\n57. Skies of Arcadia Legends\n\n58. Viewtiful Joe 2\n\n59. Time Splitters Future Perfect\n\n60. Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones\n\n78. Resident Evil 0\n\n113. James Bond 007: NightFire\n\n149. Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance\n\n160. Donkey Konga\n\n165. Killer7\n\n175. Super Mario Strikers\n\n184. Jedi Knight 2\n\n195. Naruto: Clash of Ninja 2\n\n--Updated to Post #7--\n\nGood thread, I'd be interested in replies too\n\ni would like to add Naruto fighting series (the japanese version) (i think tons of people watch that anime) and that fighting series is one of the best fighting games that i've played.\n\nand i bought a gamecube + 4 controllers just because i wanna play that game with my friends so bad (my Wii could not play it.. sigh)\n\nPersonally I like tony hawks 1, it has good music. Everything after 3 went downhill in my opinion.\n\nSkies of arcadia I suggest getting for the dreamcast and prince of persia titles and splinter cell for the xbox (unless you want the added GBA bonus for splinter cell and multiplayer is also available).\n\nEternal darkness is a must as is all the resident evil games (4, remake of 1 and 0 especially).\n\nMy cube games are elsewhere right now and a few of those are NTSC games I have not played but I enjoyed baiten chaos, Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance (the sequel is better though), Lost Kingdoms, Killer7, James Bond 007: NightFire (multiplayer mainly although it must be said there are far better FPS games available on other systems), Jedi Knight 2 and Some might say freedom fighters but personally I can not stand it.\n\nFinal Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles is also worth it should it be cheap and you have a few GBAs spare, there are DS and Wii versions coming up that seem to promise more.\n\nThere are a few (mainly pre mod chip) threads similar to this as well.\n\nMario Golf and Tennis are definately worth getting - 2 awesome games, both developed by Camelot (of Golden Sun fame!). Mario Tennis is one of the Cubes top multiplayer games!\n\nLike lagman suggests the Donkey Konga series might be worth a look at if you're into music games.\n\nStar Wars: Rebel Strike (the follow up to Rogue Squadron 2) is a great game and I'm not even a Star Wars fan.\n\nZelda 4 Swords is worth checking out too... it's meant to really be a multiplayer game but it's still fun in single player.\n\nIf you do have a few friends and a GBA knocking around PacMan Vs. is a good laugh as well.\n\nSome people also loved Chibi Robo though I wasn't a fan of it personally.\n\nEDIT - Moved Topic\n\nPersonally I like tony hawks 1, it has good music. Everything after 3 went downhill in my opinion.\n\n...\n\nThere are a few (mainly pre mod chip) threads similar to this as well.\n\nThanks for the suggestions! Although, think I'll stick with just the Wii for now... wish I could buy all the other systems for those games.\n\nYeah, this thread probably isn't entirely relevant to \"Wii - Hacking\", but this is the most traveled Wii forum. I guess I could put something in the title about how this is for use with the GCOS Multiboot to draw that tenuous link.\n\nWhat about Soul Caliber 2 and The Legend of Spyro?\n\nSoul Calibur II is #6 on the gamerankings.com list. That's really high, but I wasn't sure if we'd be seeing a new version on the Wii in the near future. What do you think?\n\nI'm really just trying to find the stuff that I'll want to play 1-2 years down the road. I find that I too often end up buying / acquiring games that are almost instantly outdated.\n\nYeah deffinitely add Mario Tennis that game rocks. I'm personally holding out on RE4 for the Wii version.\n\nTimesplitters 2 is pretty fun. I actually went out and bought that one from EB when I first got my Wii. Before I picked it up though I asked the guy if they had Future Perfect for GC and he was like \"no, gamecube wasn't as powerful as the PS2 so it never came out for that system\"."
