        "text": "Broadly speaking, digital games can be studied in three ways: the social sciences perspective focuses on the social context of games and their players; the humanities perspective takes games as cultural artifacts, and concentrates on their meaning as well as ways of meaning-making; and the design perspective views games as a set of design and programming problems. What distinguishes digital games from traditional ones like chess is their greater emphasis on representational and narrative elements. From the humanities perspective this raises a number of questions. What is the scope of literary theory and narratology in the game scholar's methodological toolbox? How should computer games as objects of study be defined? In the early years of game studies these questions were at the heart of the so-called \"ludology versus narratology\" debate. I believe that revisiting the debate could be edifying for humanities scholars working in adjacent areas. Additionally, while contemporary research tends toward more holistic approaches, as far as I know extant accounts of how narratives and game rules are intertwined have either reduced games to non-trivial cybernetic machines or interactive semiotic matrices, restricted themselves mostly to the expressive aspects of games, or left the interrelation between rules and narratives ultimately somewhat vague. After reviewing the ludology vs. narratology debate and some of its central points of contention, I will propose a holistic account of the relationship between games and narratives. Narrative will be treated as a cognitive strategy for making sense of the game's fictional world that is created by the rules of the game via semiotic means. Instead of reducing games to other kinds of entities, it will be shown that games qua games are the source of the semiotic processes which ultimately create fictional worlds and direct the player toward a narrative interpretation of the game's signs.\n\nIn this thesis, we propose a new method for the analysis of interactive narratives in digital games. The method, entitled the “CIMI Method,” is comprised of three steps: a close critical reading to understand the embedded narrative of a candidate text, isolation of a target game mechanic for study via game prototyping, and a player interview phase for understanding the dimensions of player experience with a game narrative. We have applied the CIMI Method to the Namco Bandai game Ace Combat Zero: The Belkan War in order to evaluate its effectiveness and contribute to a better understanding of game narratives. We contend that insights gained from the use of the CIMI Method can be utilized for informing game design and increasing the entertainment value of a game, and for further qualifying the medium of games as a narrative art form. Future directions of research in terms of Narrative Game Studies are also introduced and discussed.\n\nContemporary video games such as Mass Effect or Assassin’s Creed emerge as a new form of media and depart from traditional games purely seen as problem-solving exercises. They are enjoyed by a broader audience, similar to those of TV and cinema. At the same time, they are significantly different from TV and cinema, since they place the user at the centre of interaction and content creation. This paper discusses the role of narratives in these new epic games as the main driver behind their appeal and commercial success.\n\nToday, no generally accepted definition of video game narrative exists. The academic discourse has pointed out ontological and phenomenologi- cal differences to more traditional forms of narra- tive, and therefore, the relationship to established scholarship in narratology is complex. In the field of video game studies, narrative aspects of video games are often described in contrast to rule-based aspects. A wider scan of related fields reveals additional positions. Ludonarrative is variously understood as a structural quality of the video game artifact, as an experiential quality during the experience of a video game, or as a high- level framework to understand video games. Finally, a number of scholars emphasize the difference to traditional manifestations and there- fore work towards specific theories of video game narrative. While all legitimate by them- selves, these different usages of “narrative” in the context of video games are often not clearly distinguished in professional or academic dis- course and can lead to considerable confusion. It is therefore essential to scrutinize the particular context and underlying assumptions when approaching the topic. This state of affairs puts particular responsibility on scholars to identify the origins of their understanding of video game nar- rative and define their particular usage of the term in contrast to earlier applications."
