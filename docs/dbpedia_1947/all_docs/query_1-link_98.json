        "text": "[Last updated 06/12/2017]\n\nThis table details every single game to receive a coveted (9) or (10) score from legendary games industry bugle Edge magazine. This is a complete list as far as I am aware; it includes retrospective awards in regular issues, including ‘The Ten Amendments’ in issue 258, the 2002 retro special and also incorporates online exclusive reviews, which never appeared in print. Feel free to cross reference these with Metacritic or GameRankings if you’re particularly incredulous about such and such an iOS game getting a (9).\n\nI’ve seen several such lists appear elsewhere on the dark corners of the internet before, but as far as I’m aware they have now all been taken down. With the closure of the Edge Online website (it was “replaced” with a page on GamesRadar+ which has hardly been updated in the last two years), Edge devotees—and haters for that matter—lost the ability to look up classic games they may have missed. This seems an especially sad situation for more recent converts who, being not well-endowed with back issues, will face great difficulties in trying to catch up on two decades worth of video game releases.\n\nWhile some previous Google Spreadsheet docs I’ve seen have contained every review score, my personal lists only ever focused on the highest scoring titles, as I used them to plan future purchases. While regrettable, the fact that this information is unavailable elsewhere (Metacritic listings for Edge are incomplete), made me feel it was only right to share it.\n\nAn interesting observation I’ve made is the fact that several titles, especially earlier in the magazine’s run, have been reviewed multiple times, even without counting retrospective awards. This is obviously due to delayed PC releases or particularly prominent remasters. However, this allows us to identity what might be called Edge‘s “most decorated” games. These include:\n\nHalo: Combat Evolved—a (10) for the initial OG Xbox release, followed by a (9) for the later PC port and yet another (9) for the Xbox 360 remaster, Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary.\n\nHalf Life 2—a (10) for the original PC release, and a second (10) for the Orange Box release, which bundled the game and its expansions with two of Valve’s other titles, Portal and Team Fortress 2.\n\nStreet Fighter IV—a (9) followed by a second (9) for the Super Street Fighter IV version and another (9) for the final version, Ultra Street Fighter IV.\n\nResident Evil 4—a (9) for the GameCube original and a (9) for the delightful Resident Evil 4: Wii Edition.\n\nRez— a (9) for the PS2 original and another (9) for the remaster, Rez Infinite.\n\nFinal Fantasy VII—a (9) for the PS1 version and another (9) for the PC port.\n\nDark Souls II—the last gen version scored a (9), with another (9) for the remaster/remix, Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin.\n\nVirtua Fighter—a (9) for the original and a further (9) for Virtua Fighter Remix.\n\nResident Evil—the initial release scored (9), with Resident Evil: Director’s Cut also gaining a coveted (9).\n\nTomb Raider II—a (9) for the PS1 original, with another (9) for the PC port.\n\nIt’s also worth mentioning the most successful game franchises in terms of Edge scores, specifically those with multiple tens:\n\nSuper Mario: (10)s: Super Mario Bros., Super Mario 64, Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2. (9)s: Super Mario Sunshine, Super Mario 3D World and Super Mario Maker.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: (10)s: The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. (9)s: The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess and The Legend of Zelda: The Phantom Hourglass.\n\nHalo: (10)s: Halo: Combat Evolved and Halo 3. (9)s: Halo [PC], Halo 2, Halo 3: ODST, Halo Reach and Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary.\n\nGrand Theft Auto: (10)s: Grand Theft Auto IV and Grand Theft Auto V. (9)s: Grand Theft Auto, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars and Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City.\n\n“Souls” series: (10)s: Dark Souls and Bloodborne. (9)s: Demon’s Souls, Dark Souls II, Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin and Dark Souls III.\n\nHalf Life: (10)s Half Life 2 and The Orange Box. (9)s: Half Life.\n\nBayonetta: (10)s: Bayonetta and Bayonetta 2.\n\nOn to the list itself! I’ve worked in chronological issue order for obvious reasons, but remember to scroll to the end for the online only and retrospective review scores. As a huge fan of Edge, arguably the definitive benchmark of review quality, renowned for their harshness, though occasionally a champion of the overlooked, I think it’s tragic that all we have is the numbers for some of these reviews. It would be great if people were able to see a title here and think “oh, really? what’s this game, I’ll look up the review!”. Alas dear internet, alas!\n\nPlease let me know if you become aware of any mistakes or omissions; I will attempt to update this list periodically. Be also be aware you may need to scroll to the right if you’re viewing this on a mobile device."
