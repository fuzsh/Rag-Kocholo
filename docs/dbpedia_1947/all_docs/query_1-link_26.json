        "text": "The Warriors (2005)\n\ndeveloper: Rockstar Toronto\n\npublisher: Rockstar\n\nsystem: PlayStation 2\n\nGameRankings score: 83%\n\nLike Manhunt and Bully, The Warriors uses the PS2-era Grand Theft Auto engine. However, the gameplay is totally different. Warriors is basically a linear, story-driven beat-em-up, supplemented with tedious graphitti assignments. I didn’t hate this game but, like 90% of beat-em-ups, the fighting mechanics are too simple. The characters are all totally unlikeable and mindless rampaging is actually difficult given the closed nature of this release.\n\nResident Evil 5 (2009)\n\ndeveloper/publisher: Capcom\n\nsystem: Xbox 360\n\nGameRankings score: 86%\n\nThis was a really big disappointment, especially since the dipshit critics gave it such a relatively strong score. I swear that there is industry bias for and against certain series and I think Resident Evil is on the better end of that deal. Going into this game, it appears to be a continuation/extension of the game mechanics introduced in the excellent Resident Evil 4. Well, looks can be deceiving. Yes, there’s an over the shoulder view but almost every other element from RE4 has been trashed. The controls, everything from running to fighting to simply restoring your fucking health has been totally clunked up. The old Resident Evils were clunky due to design/technology limitations. In this game the clunkiness seems to be based on stupid, intentional decisions.\n\nYou may have heard of the controversy surrounding this game, which involves a great white hero gunning down armies of black zombies in Africa and how Capcom attempted to address this problem by adding a “black” sidekick character. The sidekick is a complete failure. She gets in the way, she holds you back, she’s annoying and she appears to be at most half-black, with very caucasian facial features. This game was a real letdown.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (2006)\n\ndeveloper/publisher: Nintendo\n\nplatform: GameCube\n\nGameRankings score: 96%\n\nI don’t hate this game but 5.5 hours in I don’t feel like playing it any more, which in my mind is a pretty big indictment for a Zelda game. Naturally, the critics loved it but why? Remember the first Zelda game? A dude gives you a sword and bam! you’re off on an adventure. Within an hour you’ve found the first dungeon. This fucking game spends the first couple of hours on linear fetch quests that take place entirely within some dump of a village. You can’t enter the main overworld until you’ve found someone’s cat, found someone else’s favorite baby basket, rounded up some goats, ugh. Everyone sits in their exact spot in the village saying their exact same thing like we’re still in the Super NES days. Link is saddled with an annoying sidekick elf/monster/whatever thing and he sometimes turns into a wolf.\n\nThe game has a great look to it but just seems to come up very short in the category of personality. Its predecessor, The Wind Waker, had a lot of issues but it was bursting with great personality and it looks great.\n\nLeft 4 Dead (2008)\n\ndeveloper: Valve\n\npublisher: EA\n\nsystem: Xbox 360\n\nGameRankings score: 89%\n\nI bought this game because I really liked Valve’s The Orange Box compilation for Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2: Episode One, Half-Life 2: Episode Two, and Portal. I did not give a flying fuck about the online-only multiplayer-only Team Fortress 2. Left 4 Dead looks a lot like Half-Life but it’s about as deep as Team Fortress 2. In other words, it’s basically designed for you to go online, turn off your brain, and play through its rather short missions over and over. I can’t think of any other game with so little content that was given such a high score by the critics.\n\nPrince of Persia (2008)\n\ndeveloper: Ubisoft Montreal\n\npublisher: Ubisoft\n\nsystem: Xbox 360\n\nGameRankings score: 80%"
