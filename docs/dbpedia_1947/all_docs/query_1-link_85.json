        "text": "We greatly expanded and updated The Scientifically Proven Best Video Games of All Time as The Video Game Canon in 2017. You should check it out!\n\nWhen it comes to deciding which video games qualify as the best of all time, everyone has an opinion. And sometimes those opinions result in a violent argument over the mental faculties (or lack thereof) of the listmaker. So we thought we’d add a little science to the equation to find out exactly which games can be considered the “100 Best Video Games of All Time” and which ones have been fighting above their weight class all these years.\n\nSources and Methodology\n\nThis “Meta Top 100” was compiled from six recent Top 100 lists and the 100 highest-rated games on GameRankings as of the the US release date of the most recent game selected by a source (April 30, 2012).\n\nEach Top 100 list was chosen because it included titles from as many platforms as possible and stretched back multiple generations. As such, recent Top 100 lists from Nintendo Power and PC Gamer were excluded. No weighting of the sources was done as the “Meta Top 100” uses the average position of each title in each list as the overall ranking. If a game was unreleased at the time of a list’s creation, it was not included in the game’s overall average. If a game was released and was unranked by a source, it was given a ranking of 101 from that source for averaging purposes. In the case of remakes (i.e. Counter-Strike and Counter-Strike: Source, they were considered one game for averaging purposes.\n\nSo, without further adieu, here are the sources used for our “Meta Top 100”:\n\nIGN – Top 100 Games of All Time (Cut-Off: December 31, 2006)\n\nEdge – The 100 Best Games of All Time (Cut-Off: June 30, 2007)\n\nSource Notes: The ranking for “The Bomberman Series” on this list was folded into Super Bomberman for averaging purposes.\n\nEdge – 100 Best Games to Play Today (Cut-Off: January 31, 2009)\n\nSource Notes: The ranking for “The Bomberman Series” on this list was folded into Super Bomberman for averaging purposes.\n\nGame Informer – Top 200 Games of All Time (Cut-Off: December 31, 2009)\n\nG4 – Top 100 Video Games Of All Time (Cut-Off: December 31, 2011)\n\nGames Radar – 100 Best Games of All Time (Cut-Off: March 31, 2012)\n\nGameRankings (Cut-Off: April 30, 2012)\n\nSource Notes: Multiplatform titles were only listed once with their highest score. Any game released before 1991 is not included in GameRankings’ database and any game released before the aggregator’s creation in 2000 without 10 reviews was removed from consideration due to an incomplete record of critical response.\n\nIt should be noted that another Top 100 list is currently working its way to completion: 1UP’s Essential 100. The feature is being spread out over half a year and four parts (one, two, and three are currently available). Hopefully it can be added to a future update of the “Meta Top 100.”\n\nAlright, with all the housekeeping out of the way, let’s get to the list.\n\nThe List: 1 – 25\n\nAs if there was any doubt, Alexey Pajitnov’s puzzle masterpiece, Tetris, is “The Scientifically Proven Best Game of All Time.” It was included on every list and its lowest ranking was #9 in the Edge Special. But as with all “Top 100” lists, it’s the exclusions that get all the hype. And in this case it’s the exclusion of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time from Games Radar’s list and Half-Life 2‘s exclusion from G4TV’s list. Both games have been battling it out as the presumptive “Best Game of All Time” for nearly a decade, but those exclusions pushed both a bit further down the list and allowed Tetris to sneak into the top spot.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that this “Meta Top 100” isn’t solely the domain of dusty (and sometimes musty) old games. The two newest titles on the list, Batman: Arkham City and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim are both less than a year old and ranked within the Top 13.\n\nOverall, Nintendo reigned supreme in the first quarter of the list as four Mario games (Super Mario 64, Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario Galaxy 2, and Super Mario World), Zelda: A Link to the Past, Super Metroid, and the aforementioned Ocarina of Time all made it into the Top 25. And for good measure, Nintendo also published the Game Boy/NES version of Tetris (considered by many, myself included, to be the definitive version of the game).\n\nIf you’re interested in The Complete List (which includes 334 titles), you can find it in Google Docs.\n\n1. Tetris (1986)\n\nAverage Ranking: 4.7\n\n2. Resident Evil 4 (2005)\n\nAverage Ranking: 12.3\n\n3. Super Mario 64 (1996)\n\nAverage Ranking: 14.9\n\n4.

Super Mario World (1991)\n\nAverage Ranking: 46.2\n\nThe List: 26 – 50\n\nThe second quarter of the “Meta Top 100” has a bit of a split personality between more modern fare and some of the classics of the Atari/NES/Super NES eras. Four more Mario games (Super Mario Kart, Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Galaxy, and Super Mario World 2: Yoshi’s Island) cracked the top 50 alongside The Legend of Zelda and Street Fighter II. This section of the “Meta Top 100” is also home to both Portal games, the first “modern” JRPG (Final Fantasy VII), three groundbreaking first person shooters (Halo: Combat Evolved, GoldenEye 007, and Half-Life), and the granddaddy of the open world genre (Grand Theft Auto III).\n\n26. Metal Gear Solid (1998)\n\nAverage Ranking: 47.6\n\n27. Halo: Combat Evolved (2001)\n\nAverage Ranking: 47.6\n\n28. Street Fighter IV / Super Street Fighter IV (2008)\n\nAverage Ranking: 48\n\n29.

Grand Theft Auto III (2001)\n\nAverage Ranking: 54.9\n\n41. Super Mario World 2: Yoshi’s Island (1995)\n\nAverage Ranking: 56.7\n\n42. Half-Life (1998)\n\nAverage Ranking: 58.6\n\n43. The Legend of Zelda (1987)\n\nAverage Ranking: 58.7\n\n44. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (2006)\n\nAverage Ranking: 63.3\n\n45 (tie). Metroid Prime (2002)\n\nAverage Ranking: 64\n\n45 (tie). Rock Band 3 (2010)\n\nAverage Ranking: 64\n\n47. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (2004)\n\nAverage Ranking: 64.1\n\n48. God of War (2005)\n\nAverage Ranking: 64.3\n\n49. Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (2003)\n\nAverage Ranking: 64.8\n\n50. The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker (2003)\n\nAverage Ranking: 65.4\n\n51-100\n\nTitles in the bottom half of the list often made their way into the “Meta Top 100” on the back of a particularly passionate source. For example, id’s seminal first person shooter Doom was given a #9 ranking by Game Informer, but barely scratched the surface of any other list. However, that was enough for a spot in the “Meta Top 100.” But the most amazing statistic is that Nintendo-published games account for more than 20% of the “Meta Top 100.” Say what you will about their business philosophy, but their game design philosophy is one of almost universal acclaim.\n\nOn a personal note, I am thrilled that both Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2 and Secret of Mana both made the “Meta Top 100.” Geometry Wars 2 is my favorite game of the current generation and Secret of Mana, which squeaked in at #100, is probably my favorite from the days of 16-bits.\n\n51. Pokemon Red / Blue / Yellow (1998)\n\nAverage Ranking: 65.5\n\n52. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2003)\n\nAverage Ranking: 66.6\n\n53. Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (2002)\n\nAverage Ranking: 67.1\n\n54. SimCity 2000 (1993)\n\nAverage Ranking: 67.8\n\n55. Mike Tyson’s Punch-Out!! (1987)\n\nAverage Ranking: 68.2\n\n56.

Panzer Dragoon Saga (1998)\n\nAverage Ranking: 78.3\n\n89 (tie). Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec (2001)\n\nAverage Ranking: 79\n\n89 (tie). Minecraft (2011)\n\nAverage Ranking: 79\n\n91.

Secret of Mana (1993)\n\nAverage Ranking: 81.8\n\nBeyond the Top 100\n\nAn additional 233 titles were included on at least one Top 100 list, but they weren’t able to gather enough points to crack the “Meta Top 100.” Some of these also-rans include classics from the early days of arcades including Galaga (#125), Donkey Kong (#127), Space Invaders (#132), Pac-Man (#190), and Pong (#332). But others are more recent titles that are sure to rise as new Top 100 lists are produced, including Angry Birds (#135) and the newest game on the list, Mass Effect 3 (#323).\n\nMost of the games that you would expect to see on your average Top 100 list were selected by at least one source, but I was most surprised by the exclusion of Midway’s twin-stick shooter Smash TV. Not a single publication picked it, likely because that spot was taken by the forefather of the genre, Robotron 2084 (#168). I guess we all have our favorites that have been forgotten by the critical community at large.\n\nOnce again, The Complete List can be viewed on Google Docs"
