Just a quick message to let everyone know that I'll be stepping down as an Admin for GameFAQs as I've decided to part ways with Fandom.\n\nI've enjoyed my time working on this site and I'll stick around as a Moderator for now and to offer whatever knowledge I can to those still working on the site, but after 20 long years I just don't enjoy things like I used to and need to find some new challenge to tackle.\n\nThanks everyone, I'll still be around, possibly more as I move back down to a user rather than an Admin.

I don't think he would have stepped away unless things got truly bad. Really damning for Fandom. I hope it's not indicative of proposed changes, but who am I kidding, the outlook is really grim.\n\nQuinton\n\nStaff Writer at TheGamer / Reviewer at RPG Site\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n18,244\n\nMidgar, With Love\n\nOct 18, 2023\n\n#17\n\nGrew up there.

The game is famously esoteric with tons of hidden mechanics, pathways, characters, and plot progressions and to experience the game to its fullest really required help and support from people who already knew the game and had unlocked its obtuse secrets. It would not have been possible for me to complete it without referencing an robust, albeit incomplete, GameFAQs text-only walkthrough from 1999.\n\nThis is the sort of precious historic material that is at risk, so I hope there is an effort right now to scrape and extract all this content that might be delisted or deleted because they aren't revenue drivers for a new owner.\n\nShinUltima\n\nOne Winged Slayer\n\nOct 30, 2017\n\n1,525\n\nTrinidad, West Indies\n\nOct 18, 2023\n\n#19\n\nTHe (iOS) Final Fantasy Record Board forum was fantastic for that game. Outstanding community. The global version of the game is dead but the JPN version is still trickling along and a number of users are still meeting up in the board. It would be incredibly sad to see all that knowledge and history wiped for some reason.\n\nTΛPIVVΛ\n\nNov 12, 2017\n\n3,014\n\nOct 18, 2023\n\n#21\n\nmy youth, I remember printing hundreds of pages of faqs for Final Fantasy III, Chrono Trigger and the like much to my parents and schools detriment.\n\nKings.\n\nOct 18, 2023\n\n#22\n\nI still use GameFAQs quite frequently for retro games.\n\nYouTube videos are difficult to find exact parts on and the GameFAQs have extra info you don't get in those videos.\n\nI'd say video and text walkthroughs often serve two different purposes - it's important to keep the text versions going.\n\nTheAggroCraig\n\nThis guy are sick of the One Winged Slayer\n\nNov 6, 2017\n\n6,183\n\nOct 18, 2023\n\n#23\n\nI use the FAQs every so often, most recent game was Tales of Arise which actually had a really nice one put together so I could barrel through the back half of the game and so I could ignore stuff that wasn't worth my time.\n\nBut yeah, the forums are absolutely dreadful these days, it was my first forum and I do lurk every so often but am quickly reminded of why I don't post/give it the time of day anymore. My sig on there is still the old CJayC post about how he'll never sell the site lmao\n\nHopefully the FAQs live on for a while, glad to see there are backups out there.\n\nThrill_house\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n10,959\n\nOct 18, 2023\n\n#24\n\nI still use them for old games as I hate videos, text is so much faster and I don't have to hear some goofball talk.

How did this guy own it?\n\nDidn't CJayC found it?\n\nCorrect, Jeff Veasey or CJayC founded the site back in 1996, and stepped down around 2007 and left the forums. SBAllen has been in charge since then. SBAllen was already a prominent guide author back then too, under the alias of Sailor Bacon.\n\nMy username has survived 23 years and several forum transitions. Hell I think if you were to google search it, every single reference to \"OmegaDL50\" online will lead back to me.\n\nSirKai\n\nDec 28, 2017\n\n8,190\n\nWashington\n\nOct 18, 2023\n\n#37\n\nJediknight12345.\n\nI still remember when I got you to close your OG account because the Wii version of Prince of Persia: Forgotten Sands had a higher Gamerankings score than the 360/PS3 version.\n\nLMAO, yes you did fucking do that.

Every time I see someone shout out NGG here it warms my heart a little. Many of us are here it seems.\n\nEven wilder when people talk about LUE and stuff here. What a niche community in the grand scheme of things but in GameFAQs threads here I always see it mentioned.\n\nHrodulf\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n5,453\n\nOct 18, 2023\n\n#39\n\nWait, GameFAQs is owned by Fandom now? It's only a matter of time before it goes to complete shit then.\n\nThe forums sucked (even though I used them a bit back in the day), but I miss having a central location for video game guides, especially from people whose guides I used a lot (A I e x was one of them).\n\n\"Video walkthroughs\" are almost always significantly less useful and can eat my ass.\n\nPoyunch\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n2,514\n\nOct 18, 2023\n\n#41\n\nDamn that's a name I hadn't heard in a while. GameFAQs was basically my childhood forum before moving to the old site. Made a lot of good memories there.\n\nOpposable\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n2,377\n\nOct 18, 2023\n\n#42\n\nI remember they would purge the message boards I guess to save storage??\n\nEvery day at 12pm UK time for 30 odd minutes it was unusable\n\nJakenbakin\n\n\"This guy are sick\" and Corrupted by Vengeance\n\nJun 17, 2018\n\n12,509\n\nOct 18, 2023\n\n#43\n\nIs this something that's going to affect the site and guides already on it? I'm kind of confused by the tone of the thread.\n\nTurnabout Sisters\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n2,433\n\nOct 18, 2023\n\n#44\n\nIt's obviously fantastic that it's all archived but I feel the visibilty and (in)famousness of GameFAQs has helped retro game culture thrive to the point that it's at now. Younger people keep going back to retro games and love them and I think there's an understanding that many of them are enhanced by guides, and some games more or less require them.\n\nI hope there will be some user-friendly hub for people to access the guides. They won't help people being stuck on one archive.org page. Legally that's a minefield but that's what needs to happen once GameFAQs is fully Fandom'd. It needs the visibility\n\nKinsei\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n20,933\n\nOct 18, 2023\n\n#45\n\nIs this something that's going to affect the site and guides already on it? I'm kind of confused by the tone of the thread.\n\nThe experience of reading existing guides will likely go to shit. Expect intrusive auto play ads.\n\nStath\n\nSaw the truth behind the copied door\n\nMar 4, 2022\n\n3,734\n\nOct 18, 2023\n\n#46\n\nSo SBAllen retired before I hit 10k karma (just like a year to go!), dang\n\nI haven't used the forums… or site in general, in years, but I do keep an active login to keep gaining those karma points!\n\nI did this too for awhile, figured I would eventually get the \"? Block\" status after a few more years of regular visits, but after seeing too many awful posters with massive karma counts I figured, what's the point? One literally had a maga signature.\n\nWish I didn't spend so much time on the forums; it was miserable. Trolls and assholes would stick around forever. The limit on posters you could ignore was laughably low and I eventually ran out of dormant accounts to prune. Sometimes I'll check the forums for new games and recognize the same assholes from a decade ago or more, still posting in the exact same ways.\n\nIt sounds like the actual stuff of value from the site has been preserved. The forums could and probably should go away and the internet would be better for it.\n\nmachtia\n\nOct 29, 2017\n\n1,799\n\nOct 18, 2023\n\n#47\n\nI still use GameFAQs quite frequently for retro games.\n\nYouTube videos are difficult to find exact parts on and the GameFAQs have extra info you don't get in those videos.\n\nI'd say video and text walkthroughs often serve two different purposes - it's important to keep the text versions going.\n\nYeah, I'm using a GameFAQs guide right now as I play through GrimGrimoire. I vastly prefer written guides… just not the modern SEO-poisoned kind you see everywhere else.\n\nWingus\n\nDec 8, 2017\n\n327\n\nOct 18, 2023\n\n#48\n\nWhen Romancing SaGa 2 was released on Vita in 2017, it was translated and localized \"out of nowhere\" and the only resources for it were decades old fan works from the earliest days of the internet. The game is famously esoteric with tons of hidden mechanics, pathways, characters, and plot progressions and to experience the game to its fullest really required help and support from people who already knew the game and had unlocked its obtuse secrets. It would not have been possible for me to complete it without referencing an robust, albeit incomplete, GameFAQs text-only walkthrough from 1999.\n\nThis is the sort of precious historic material that is at risk, so I hope there is an effort right now to scrape and extract all this content that might be delisted or deleted because they aren't revenue drivers for a new owner.\n\nIndeed.\n\nGamefaqs also hosts what is considered THE reference/walkthrough in English for anyone delving into works like Unlimited SaGa (a game notorious for not explaining any of its mechanics to the player).\n\nThere have been many, many amazing guides created there long before the days of video walkthroughs and wiki pages/sites, and the individual game forums made it easier for people to have discussions/questions about any particular game.\n\nHet_Nkik\n\nOne Winged Slayer\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n3,633\n\nOct 18, 2023\n\n#49\n\nI'm sad people don't write walkthroughs like they did on GameFAQs anymore. Can't stand scrubbing through YouTube videos or having to click through multiple pages on IGN or a Fandom Wiki. Just give me a long ass txt page that I can ctrl F through."
