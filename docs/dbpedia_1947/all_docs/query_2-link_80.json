        "text": "Genre: Platformer\n\nYear: 2013\n\nDeveloped by: Ubisoft Montpellier\n\nPublished by: Ubisoft\n\nPlatforms: All available in 2013\n\n#190\n\nFeeling Like: Forgotten Legend\n\nI know every subsequent game I discuss is the best on the 500 so far. “Best” is a difficult term to define since this is the most biased, subjective thing ever created. I tried to justify certain placements by saying that the 500 really is a ranking of my own experiences, a list of joy if you will rather than a list of objective quality.\n\nRegardless, Rayman Legends is a superb game that doesn’t get enough respect, both from the 500 (ie, me) and the mainstream gaming audience. It’s got a 90 on Metacritic (I really miss GameRankings), it’s a clear improvement from the already-great Rayman Origins and is in the running for one of the best co-op Platformers ever. It’s filled with creativity, it’s got an artistic style that’s immediately identifiable, a near-perfect ramping of difficulty and is one of the few platforming competitors I’d put toe to toe with Mario in terms of level design and creativity.\n\nIt deserves to be so much higher. Why do I have it ranked 190? I suppose I didn’t play it all that much, I flew through to the end credits before I could fully appreciate the craftsmanship I was seeing. I played it three years after it released, no doubt based on a discounted purchase. I am nothing if not frugal (cheap) when it comes to hunting down titles on my list of shame.\n\nCo-operative play is a double edged sword. I’ve heard rave reviews on this style of play, but when it comes to Mario or Rayman games, picking a partner is crucial to my success. Or it depends on the situation. If we’re drinking and it’s a party environment, I want New Super Mario Bros. Wii. If I want to 100% the upcoming Super Mario Bros. Wonder, I’m planning some sessions with Mitch, or go solo. As great as playing with friends can be, if you’re at odds with the rest of group in terms of your goals, it’s going to be a frustrating time. Throwing people in a chasm can be funny, but not every few minutes.\n\nSo I’m not sure if playing by myself was the right move here, but that was my reality.\n\nThe fundamentals are the same as Rayman Origins , but everything feels tighter her. The music levels were a particular highlight. Much like in the Ori escape levels, I love the rush of fleeing oncoming doom with no room for error. The eventual victory feels like diving into a cold lake after sweating for hours under a hot sun. It never fails to bring a smile to my face, and to boot, Rayman Legends has some terrific music beats and scores to accompany them. Brilliant.\n\nIt’s such a treat to scope every corner of every level. Zigging when the game tempts you to zag will often reveal a secret area, with accompanying “ahhh!” sound effect. It’s a simple design choice, but an effective one. I felt like an audience to my own performance, I had pleasant witnesses rather than being all alone.\n\nSound effects are so key to Rayman Legends‘ success. Every collectible provides some kind of hum, or happy exasperation that you found it/them. Countdowns feel dramatic, fanfare for completing a level compels you to sing along. The amount of charm present here is truly impressive, and it’s present from start to finish.\n\nThe only nitpick I have is that if you’re not running or being careened along by a raft or wire, you feel a bit sluggish. A tiny blemish on an otherwise sparking product, a truly stupendous platformer that sadly was Rayman’s 2D swansong, at least so far. If a third ever comes out, I’d be shocked if it didn’t end up on one of my Top 10 lists.\n\nPrevious 191 The Sims"
