        "text": "The Warriors (2005)\n\ndeveloper: Rockstar Toronto\n\npublisher: Rockstar\n\nsystem: PlayStation 2\n\nGameRankings score: 83%\n\nLike Manhunt and Bully, The Warriors uses the PS2-era Grand Theft Auto engine. However, the gameplay is totally different. Warriors is basically a linear, story-driven beat-em-up, supplemented with tedious graphitti assignments. I didn’t hate this game but, like 90% of beat-em-ups, the fighting mechanics are too simple. The characters are all totally unlikeable and mindless rampaging is actually difficult given the closed nature of this release.\n\nResident Evil 5 (2009)\n\ndeveloper/publisher: Capcom\n\nsystem: Xbox 360\n\nGameRankings score: 86%\n\nThis was a really big disappointment, especially since the dipshit critics gave it such a relatively strong score. I swear that there is industry bias for and against certain series and I think Resident Evil is on the better end of that deal. Going into this game, it appears to be a continuation/extension of the game mechanics introduced in the excellent Resident Evil 4. Well, looks can be deceiving. Yes, there’s an over the shoulder view but almost every other element from RE4 has been trashed. The controls, everything from running to fighting to simply restoring your fucking health has been totally clunked up. The old Resident Evils were clunky due to design/technology limitations. In this game the clunkiness seems to be based on stupid, intentional decisions.\n\nYou may have heard of the controversy surrounding this game, which involves a great white hero gunning down armies of black zombies in Africa and how Capcom attempted to address this problem by adding a “black” sidekick character. The sidekick is a complete failure. She gets in the way, she holds you back, she’s annoying and she appears to be at most half-black, with very caucasian facial features. This game was a real letdown.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (2006)\n\ndeveloper/publisher: Nintendo\n\nplatform: GameCube\n\nGameRankings score: 96%\n\nI don’t hate this game but 5.5 hours in I don’t feel like playing it any more, which in my mind is a pretty big indictment for a Zelda game. Naturally, the critics loved it but why? Remember the first Zelda game? A dude gives you a sword and bam! you’re off on an adventure. Within an hour you’ve found the first dungeon. This fucking game spends the first couple of hours on linear fetch quests that take place entirely within some dump of a village. You can’t enter the main overworld until you’ve found someone’s cat, found someone else’s favorite baby basket, rounded up some goats, ugh. Everyone sits in their exact spot in the village saying their exact same thing like we’re still in the Super NES days. Link is saddled with an annoying sidekick elf/monster/whatever thing and he sometimes turns into a wolf.\n\nThe game has a great look to it but just seems to come up very short in the category of personality. Its predecessor, The Wind Waker, had a lot of issues but it was bursting with great personality and it looks great.\n\nLeft 4 Dead (2008)\n\ndeveloper: Valve\n\npublisher: EA\n\nsystem: Xbox 360\n\nGameRankings score: 89%\n\nI bought this game because I really liked Valve’s The Orange Box compilation for Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2: Episode One, Half-Life 2: Episode Two, and Portal. I did not give a flying fuck about the online-only multiplayer-only Team Fortress 2. Left 4 Dead looks a lot like Half-Life but it’s about as deep as Team Fortress 2. In other words, it’s basically designed for you to go online, turn off your brain, and play through its rather short missions over and over. I can’t think of any other game with so little content that was given such a high score by the critics.\n\nPrince of Persia (2008)\n\ndeveloper: Ubisoft Montreal\n\npublisher: Ubisoft\n\nsystem: Xbox 360\n\nGameRankings score: 80%\n\nAll of the games on this list have pretty good visuals but this game definitely takes the cake in this regard. I love the look of this particular PoP game, much more than its PS2/GameCube/Xbox predecessors. Unfortunately, the gameplay took some really stupid steps backwards. There are a lot of little changes that mostly feel like they were made for the sake of changing something, anything. In the Sands of Time trilogy games, the trigger buttons were used to dash along walls in a very reliable and tightly controlled manner. Now, you kind of jump at a wall and hope the game understands that you want to run along the wall and not jump off of it. The fighting has been completely retooled, completely for the worse. The one thing that very obviously improved in each Sands of Time trilogy game was the fighting, but that’s been abandoned for a hilariously stupid, slow-motion, scripted battle mechanic. It’s too bad the action in this game sucks because the Prince seems pretty likeable, as opposed to the sad cunt found in Warrior Within and The Two Thrones.\n\nAs you may have noticed from a previous post, I recently finished The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask, which means I have beaten 10 Zelda games and have 3 to go (not counting the Four Swords spin-off games or the awful licensed games for CD-i). Now, finishing 3 Zelda games is no small task and it’ll probably be awhile before I’ve actually done so, but I can’t help looking to the future. When I’ve beaten all the Zeldas, what will I do when I want a Zelda fix but don’t want to replay a previously finished game? Well, fortunately, there are many Zelda clones out there. I’ve assembled this list for myself as much as anything but I’ll share it here for those other forlorn gamers that have rescued Hyrule as many times as possible. Note: I am ONLY including the games that by reputation are considered worthwhile. I’m not including any that are generally considered crap because I don’t want to play them!\n\nNote 1: Before we start, bear in mind that I have not played most of these games. So, if I categorize a game incorrectly, just let me know!\n\nNote 2: With each game I will list 2 ratings. The first rating, from GameFAQs, represents scores from amateur reviewers. The second rating, from GameRankings, represents scores from “professional” reviewers. Okay, let’s go!\n\nPart 1: A rose by any other name . . .\n\nUnapolagetic, Unabashed CLONES! These are the games that make little to no effort to hide their Zelda-ish-ness.\n\nGolden Axe Warrior (Master System, SEGA, 1991)\n\nI have to start with this game because, OH, GOD, just look at the screenshots!\n\nYep, this is a major rip-off but fans seem to like it for what it is. Interestingly, this game came out in 1991, five years after the original Zelda was released in Japan. What made SEGA think that, after all that time, they needed their own Zelda clone? And for the Master System, no less, when the SNES/Genesis war was well underway? And how did the Golden Axe property get mixed up in the whole thing? Another interesting note – SEGA never bothered to release the game in Japan.\n\nGameFAQs: 8.3 (3 reviews) GameRankings: N/A\n\nNeutopia (TurboGrafx-16, Hudson, 1990)\n\nI mainly started with Golden Axe warrior because it was so blatantly derivative. However, Hudson beat SEGA to the punch by one year with a slightly less derivative offering, story and all. See fo’ yo’ self.\n\nGameFAQs: 8.0 (6 reviews) GameRankings: N/A\n\nNeutopia II (TurboGrafx-16, Hudson, 1991)\n\nHudson didn’t waste any time releasing a follow-up. Both games are supposed to be pretty good in spite of their shamelessness.\n\nGameFAQs: 7.0 (1 review) GameRankings: N/A\n\nCrusader of Centy (Genesis, NexTech/SEGA, 1994)\n\nUnlike the previously-mentioned games, this one supposedly has some original and unique aspects in story and concept, like some sort of animal training and monster philosophy. However, just LOOK at those screenshots.\n\nGameFAQs: 7.6 (7 reviews) GameRankings: 8.0 (1 review)\n\nPart 2: I’m Breathless: Music From and Inspired by the Film Dick Tracy\n\nThis section contains games that take the Zelda formula and wrap it up in new clothes. These games have enough of their own feel that they have established their own fan bases, unlike the games in Part 1, whose only legacy is “play this if you want more action in the style of the first Zelda game.” However, all of the games in this section are usually described as, “it’s like Zelda but . . .”\n\nThe Battle of Olympus (NES, Infinity/Imagineer, 1988)\n\n“It’s like Zelda but in ancient, mythology-inspired Greece.” More specifically, it’s like the Zelda black sheep, Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. Reputedly, it’s a bit more action-oriented and less RPG-oriented than its inspiration. This game has some pretty rabid supporters, too.\n\nGameFAQs: 8.3 (12 reviews) GameRankings: N/A\n\nWillow (NES, Capcom, 1989)\n\nOh, look! One of the few games on this list that I’ve actually completed! A year after the film of the same name was released, Capcom managed to finish off this beauty. “It’s like Zelda but in the world of Willow,” which isn’t exactly all that different from the world of Zelda. However, this game is far from derivative and very much has its own identity. There is a lot of item acquisition and there are dungeons, but there’s less of an overworld/dungeon/overworld/dungeon process. The setup is a bit more RPG-ish than most Zelda games. I thoroughly enjoyed the music and revisited certain areas just to hear it.\n\nGameFAQs: 8.5 (11 reviews) GameRankings: N/A\n\nCrystalis (NES, SNK, 1989)\n\n“It’s like Zelda but more RPG-ish and with a storyline.” This game does look like Zelda on the surface but its fans, and there are many, claim that it is superior to the original in every way. Maybe so!\n\nGameFAQs: 9.3 (29 reviews) GameRankings: N/A\n\nStarTropics (NES, Nintendo, 1990)\n\n“It’s like Zelda but in a modern setting and with a yo-yo instead of a sword.” This game was developed by Nintendo’s Punch-Out!! team and wasn’t released in good ol’ Japan.\n\nGameFAQs: 8.6 (30 reviews) GameRankings: N/A\n\nZoda’s Revenge: StarTropics II (NES, Nintendo, 1994)\n\nThis little-known sequel was released four years later and only in the USA. Poor guy.\n\nGameFAQs: 8.8 (16 reviews) GameRankings: N/A\n\nFinal Fantasy Adventure (Game Boy, SquareSoft, 1991)\n\nOh! Another game I’ve actually beaten! “It’s like Zelda but in a Final Fantasy world.” This is actually the first game in the Mana (or Seiken Densetsu) series and bore the title, Final Fantasy Gaiden: Seiken Densetsu, in Japan. At first glance it looks a lot like Zelda but the overall feel is pretty different, with that darker Final Fantasy tone. There are many RPG trappings like leveling up and magic points and the items/weapons acquired throughout the game are more destructive than what you’d normally find in Zelda games (like blades and clubs on chains). I understand the SNES Mana games are less Zelda-ish but this one certainly belongs in Part 2 of this article and I would definitely recommend it.\n\nGameFAQs: 8.8 (26 reviews) GameRankings: 8.2 (6 reviews)\n\nLandStalker (Genesis, Climax/SEGA, 1992)\n\n“It’s like Zelda but with an anti-hero, platforming, and an isometric viewpoint.” This one also has pretty rabid supporters.\n\nGameFAQs: 8.7 (15 reviews) GameRankings: 8.7 (2 reviews)\n\nBeyond Oasis (Genesis, Ancient/SEGA, 1994)\n\n“It’s like Zelda but in a middle-Eastern setting and with brawling.” One reviewer described the game as a mash-up of Zelda and the Streets of Rage series. Sounds like a nice change of pace!\n\nGameFAQs: 8.1 (13 reviews) GameRankings: 8.4 (3 reviews)\n\nLegend of Oasis (Saturn, Ancient/SEGA, 1996)\n\nThe sequel to Beyond Oasis, but now with “Legend of” in the title to make the Zelda connection clearer. Thank you for that!\n\nGameFAQs: 7.7 (3 reviews) 7.8 (3 reviews)\n\nAlundra (PlayStation, Matrix/Sony, 1997)\n\n“It’s like Zelda but in 32 bits and with some jumping.” The main character is even elfin in appearance.\n\nGameFAQs: 7.9 (32 reviews) GameRankings: 8.5 (11 reviews)\n\nStarFox Adventures (GameCube, Rare/Nintendo, 2002)\n\nIf you hadn’t already guessed, this game is “like Zelda but with the StarFox cast and conventions.” Here’s how it came about. In the N64 days, Rare had made something of a habit of making high-quality “clones” of Japanese Nintendo games. Super Mario 64 begat Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64 and Mario Kart 64 begat Diddy Kong Racing. Eventually, Rare decided to make a Zelda game for the N64, entitled Dinosaur Planet. Shigeru Miyamoto got a look at it, noticed the protagonist was furry, and commanded Rare to convert the game into a StarFox installment for the GameCube. Anyway, the gameplay is Zelda 64 to the core, with the L-button aiming, button mapping and auto-jump. After this release, Rare and Nintendo divorced.\n\nGameFAQs: 7.7 (66 reviews) GameRankings: 8.0 (80 reviews)\n\nSphinx and the Cursed Mummy (PlayStation 2/Xbox/GameCube, Eurocom/THQ, 2003)\n\nThe general consensus is that this game is like Zelda but in ancient, mythology-inspired Egypt. The main innovation is the addition of a jump button.\n\nPlayStation 2 version – 8.6 (8 reviews) 7.9 (33 reviews)\n\nXbox version – 8.0 (2 reviews) 8.1 (21 reviews)\n\nGameCube version – GameFAQs: 8.0 (9 reviews) 7.9 (25 reviews)\n\nBeyond Good & Evil (PlayStation 2/Xbox/GameCube/PC, Ubisoft Montpelier/Ubisoft, 2003)\n\nThe protagonist is a photographer of some sort and the setting is kinda sci-fi. I don’t know much else but it’s always described as a Zelda clone. It has developed a really fervent cult following and was respected by the critics. Supposedly, a sequel is on the way.\n\nPlayStation 2 version – GameFAQs: 8.1 (34 reviews) GameRankings: 8.7 (57 reviews)\n\nXbox version – GameFAQs: 9.1 (27 reviews) GameRankings: 8.8 (52 reviews)\n\nGameCube version – GameFAQs: 8.9 (33 reviews) GameRankings: 8.8 (43 reviews)\n\nPC version – GameFAQs: 8.9 (9 reviews) GameRankings: 8.3 (23 reviews)\n\nOkami (PlayStation 2/Wii, Clover Studio/Capcom, 2006/2007)\n\nUnlike most of the games on this list, Okami enjoyed a pretty healthy marketing and hype push. Interestingly, it came out in the same year as a high profile Zelda release, Twilight Princess, and the reviews often described it as a “Zelda-killer” or as having “out-Zelda’d Zelda.” Pretty big talk! So, yeah, it’s like Zelda but in an ancient, mythology-inspired Japan, and the protagonist is a divine dog. The game was especially praised for its beautiful, painting-like visuals. This was the last game Clover Studio developed before Capcom dissolved them and the principal members left to form Platinum Games. There’s a sequel on the way for DS.\n\nPlayStation 2 version – GameFAQs: 9.5 (52 reviews) GameRankings: 9.2 (75 reviews)\n\nWii version – GameFAQs: 8.9 (27 reviews) GameRankings: 9.0 (47 reviews)\n\nPart 3: All in the Family\n\nThis section is a quick overview of games that bear superficial similarities to Zelda and are probably influenced by Zelda but are not by any means clones and that break out of the mold in several meaningful ways. Perhaps I will write more about these games at a later date but for now I’m including the following in this category.\n\nMana series, including Secret of Mana, Seiken Densetsu 3, Sword of Mana, and the bastard stepchild, Secret of Evermore.\n\nSoulBlazer series, including SoulBlazer, Illusion of Gaia, and Terranigma.\n\nShining series, including I’m not even sure which games el oh el.\n\nZenonia series, the series that’s dominating on iPhone of late.\n\nEND\n\nI’m glad that all these clones exist because there are too many elements that the Zelda games hold onto with unnecessary stubbornness. Why is the setting always medievel-Europe-looking’? Why is the star always a little, elfin, blond boy? Anyway, you have your orders. As for me, I still have to beat three more Zelda games before I can seven dig into the list. If you disagree with my categorization, let me know. If you love one of the above-mentioned games and think I should play it first, let me know. Goodbye.\n\nToday I learned that a Certain Someone bought a copy of Wario: Master of Disguise for DS. This game is absolutely awful and I now feel the need to inform people, especially those that might be getting into the Mario series, about the watered down, 2nd-rate Mario-related platformer/action titles that Nintendo started releasing about 5 years ago.\n\nHistory: From 1981-1993, all games in the Super Mario and Donkey Kong series were produced in-house by Nintendo’s own studios. In 1994, Nintendo began publishing Donkey Kong games developed by Rare. These games were of a high quality and very commercially successful, as their development time and investment warranted. In 2003, Nintendo started farming out Mario-related games to outside developers in what can only be called a cheap, money-grubbing move. Most of these games have rather low budgets. Even the games that turn out well could be called unnecessary as they explore old themes. Here they are, the outsourced Mario/Donkey Kong/Yoshi/Wario games . . .\n\nWARIO WORLD\n\n2003, GameCube, developed by Treasure\n\nTreasure has made some awesome games and some mediocre. This falls into the latter. It completely ignores the great play mechanics and ideas established in the Wario Land games and instead becomes a BEAT EM UP. Some things are awesome, like the music and the bonus levels but most of it is just okay. Like many of the games on this list, if feels like Wario was just thrown into some unrelated game.\n\nGrade: C+\n\nMARIO VS. DONKEY KONG\n\n2004, Game Boy Advance, developed by Nintendo Software Technology Corporation (aka Nintendo of America)\n\nThis game was technically not farmed out but the Nintendo STC, based in the US, has no connection to the Japan-based studios and this game shows it in spades. It’s actually NOT a bad game but COMPLETELY fails to capture either the Mario or Donkey Kong feel. It’s an attempt to continue the gameplay ideas of the 1994 Game Boy Donkey Kong but I’d much rather see the original studio oversee such a project. Still, a decent game on its own terms.\n\nGrade: B\n\nYOSHI TOPSY TURVY\n\n2004, Game Boy Advance, developed by Artoon\n\nThe critics ravaged this game but it’s nowhere near as bad as they say. Still, it’s nothing awesome. It uses an experimental technology with a motion sensor in the cartridge. When you tilt the GBA one way it tilts everything in the game. Yoshi and Mario-related characters and settings are mostly half-assed and could have easily been replaced by something else.\n\nGrade: B-\n\nDK KING OF SWING\n\n2005, Game Boy Advance, developed by Paon\n\nOh, neat, an interesting new idea. In this game Donkey Kong doesn’t run around and jump – instead, he swings from pegs. Not a bad concept and not a bad game but definitely a short one. Some of the levels are challenging but overall it feels like half a game. Maybe they can do something cool with a sequel?\n\nGrade: B-\n\nMARIO VS DONKEY KONG 2: MARCH OF THE MINIS\n\n2006, DS, developed by Nintendo Software Technology Corporation\n\nApparently someone at Nintendo STC sat down and said, “That last Mario vs DK game was decent but how can we improve on it? We can’t? We’re not talented enough? Okay, let’s rip off Lemmings.” That’s what this game is, a Lemmings rip-off. Nintendo STC has plenty of experience developing games from other companies’ licenses (Bionic Commando, Crystalis, Ridge Racer), they may as well have just licensed Lemmings instead of force the concept on a Donkey Kong game.\n\nGrade: D\n\nYOSHI’S ISLAND DS\n\n2006, DS, developed by Artoon\n\nWhen I first heard about this game, originally called Yoshi’s Island 2 I almost shit my pants. Then I found out Artoon was developing and not Nintendo Entertainment Analysis Division (Miyamoto’s studio) and I almost became constipated. BUT in the end, the end product was really beyond my wildest dreams – and almost totally unnecessary. On a system that can produce Nintendo 64-level graphics we are presented with a game that slavishly recreates the look of the original Yoshi’s Island for Super NES. The gameplay is 90% the same. Not much new. STILL, I have to give credit in a couple of key areas: 1) they really nailed the Mario/Yoshi feel 2) the game plays very well, is long, and is challenging.\n\nGrade: B+ (points off for lack of originality)\n\nWARIO: MASTER OF DISGUISE\n\n2007, DS, developed by Suzak\n\nUgh. Ugh ugh ugh. Until this game came out I was a blind Super Mario loyalist and would play any side-scroller starring him or his crew. This game ended all that. What a piece of shit this is. It basically attempts to use the current Castlevania style of exploration and item-retrieval and does it very boringly. There are no elements from the Wario games here at all – no enemies, settings, powers, etc. It forces you to use the stylus in contrived ways to horrible effect. Worst of all, it’s just plain fucking boring. Feels like they just put Wario in an unrelated game that was originally intended to star SpongeBob SquarePants or Hannah Montana.\n\nGrade: F\n\nDONKEY KONG JUNGLE CLIMBER\n\n2007, DS, developed by Paon\n\nThe sequel to King of Swing. And it SUCKS. It’s just plain BORING. Big spaces without enemies or anything in particular to do. Aimless wandering. Argh. Cemented my new lack of faith in Mario-related titles.\n\nGrade: D\n\nAt the moment, Nintendo doesn’t have any more games of this sort scheduled for release so maybe they’re selling poorly. Wario Land Shake has been announced for Wii but the developer has been named. Will it appear on this list?!\n\nkicknz\n\nSo, Metal Gear Solid 4 is coming out on June 12th, exclusively for the PlayStation 3, a system I probably won’t own for a long time. Oops! Konami has said this will be the last Metal Gear game. And then they said, “No, it’s just the last game staring Solid Snake.” Well, whatever! Here’s a look at the history of this high-quality series.\n\nMETAL GEAR\n\nyear: 1987\n\nsystem: MSX2\n\nother releases: PlayStation 2 (as part of Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence)\n\nIt’s surprising how many of the classic Metal Gear elements are already in place in this game: radio conversations, constantly sneaking, aquiring weapons and equipment on site, etc. It’s really a very good game but we didn’t get it in the US, as it was released for the MSX2, a Microsoft home computer that did not hit shelves in this country. Instead, we got . . .\n\nMETAL GEAR\n\nyear: 1987\n\nsystem: Nintendo Entertainment System\n\nThis is not a port of the MSX2 game. Rather, it’s an adaptation with many liberties taken. There are many differences in graphics, areas, story, etc. The eponymous Metal Gear robot is not even in the game. I have yet to play this one.\n\nMETAL GEAR 2: SOLID SNAKE\n\nyear: 1990\n\nsystem: MSX2\n\nother releases: PlayStation 2 (as part of Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence)\n\nThe NES version of Metal Gear was a surprise hit so the team that made it was given the task of making an NES sequel. When the creator of the MSX2 original found out he became a bit jealous and decided to make his own sequel. I have yet to play but it is reputedly quite good.\n\nSNAKE’S REVENGE\n\nyear: 1990\n\nsystem: Nintendo Entertainment System\n\nThe aforementioned NES sequel. It’s not especially popular with the fans as it introduced side scrolling action stages and a dumbed down stealth element.\n\nMETAL GEAR SOLID\n\nyear: 1998\n\nsystem: PlayStation\n\nother releases: GameCube (as Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes)\n\nAfter a long layoff, the series returned with its most popular installment. This is one of the games that really defined the PlayStation and brought the series into 3D VERY successfully. It has all sorts of creative tricks and gimmicks, like reading your memory card during a “mind reading” scene and a truly torturous torture-survival scenario. It was re-released and highly altered for the GameCube a few years later.\n\nMETAL GEAR SOLID\n\nyear: 2000\n\nsystem: Game Boy Color\n\nThe first game in the series to be strictly mission-based rather than free-roaming. The critics loved it at the time but I think it’s easily the weakest game I’ve played in the series. There’s too much randomness and “Are you fucking kidding me?” moments. Still, a decent game over all.\n\nMETAL GEAR SOLID 2: SONS OF LIBERTY\n\nyear: 2001\n\nsystem: PlayStation 2\n\nother releases: Xbox\n\nA very worthy sequel taking place in a huge facility in the middle of the sea. Lots of sneaking, lots of action, too much talky-talky. This one stars a really femmy guy.\n\nMETAL GEAR SOLID 3: SNAKE EATER\n\nyear: 2004\n\nsystem: PlayStation 2\n\nPerhaps the best game in the series so far in spite of some really drawn-out sections. There are many outdoor areas and camouflage-management is a must (you have many to choose from). When you’re injured you must treat your wounds. All of your food is procured on-site so huntng is a requirement. All while you attempt to stop a bunch of terrorists from starting a nuclear war.\n\nMETAL GEAR SOLID PORTABLE OPS\n\nyear: 2006\n\nsystem: PSP\n\nA surprisingly strong release that makes sense on a portable. Many original concepts are introduced like managing your own army, recruiting new soldiers, and entering various areas from a central command base. It’s mission-based and the whole thing works very well.\n\nMETAL GEAR SOLID MOBILE\n\nyear: 2008\n\nsystem: mobile phones\n\nMy phone can barely play Pac-Man let alone this game so I have no first hand experience. According to reviews, it’s a short-ish but high quality 3D game that lives up to and feels just like the rest of the series.\n\nMETAL GEAR SOLID 4: GUNS OF THE PATRIOTS\n\nyear: 2008\n\nsystem: PlayStation 3\n\nThe new one, duh!\n\nkicknz\n\nThe downward slide in sales that began with the SNES and escalated with the N64 continued full force with the GameCube. Released in 2001, Nintendo’s new machine went on to sell 11 million less units than the N64. Most of this decrease occurred in the US and I attribute it largely to the new competition from the Xbox. As I mentioned before the N64 was almost as popular in the US as the SNES was, defying world trends. When the Xbox hit the scene six months ahead of the GameCube it seemed to pull in many of the non-PlayStation gamers remaining out there. Unlike the previous generation, there was really very little to distinguish the PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameCube.\n\nWhatever the reason for the slide, Nintendo couldn’t blame it on the 3rd party developers. It would be an exaggeration to say that they came back in droves but none of them neglected the GameCube. Konami released a Metal Gear Solid remake and Square released a GameCube-exclusive Final Fantasy spin-off. There were many games that hit PS2, Xbox and GC like Prince of Persia and Soulcalibur. Although this helped GameCube’s library, it also made it less distinguishable from its competition.\n\nIn spite of the sliding sales, the GameCube was, in my opinion, definitely a better console than the N64, thanks largely to the return of the 3rd party publishers. Nintendo racked their brains and came up with some great new series of their own like Animal Crossing and Pikmin. Despite these artistic successes, Nintendo seemed to smell desperation and started to think really differently, coming up with a very bold design for their next system . . .\n\nWii.\n\nWHAT WERE THE COMPETITORS UP TO?\n\nKICKING NINTENDO’S ASS, THAT’S WHAT!\n\nPLAYSTATION 2 by Sony\n\nWho could have foreseen that the PS2 would outsell even the PS1? The PS2 has now sold almost twice as many units as the NES. In fact, it’s still going strong and outselling the newer PlayStation 3. Many of the good 3rd party games for GameCube were also released for PS2 but these games almost always look crappier on PS2. The defining series on PS2? Grand Theft Auto.\n\nXBOX by Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft pushed its way onto the scene with this gigantic, ugly system. It’s not much more powerful than the GameCube but about 5 times as massive. The thing that sets Xbox apart from the others and what partially explains its huge size is that it had an actual hard drive built into it for storage. So no messing around with memory cards. You can also rip CDs to the hard drive and in some games use your own ripped music to replace the in-game music. Xbox also brought online gaming into the mainstream. It seems like every Xbox owner played boring first person shooters online against all their boring friends.\n\nSEGA DREAMCAST\n\nWoe! The underrated and underpurchased member of this generation. It came out 2 years before any of the others and was pronounced dead by SEGA before GameCube even hit the shelves. This system really delivered on the promise of an arcade at home. It was as powerful as most arcade units and was nearly identical to SEGA’s main arcade hardware at the time. There were a ton of fun, brainless fighters, racers and shooters on this system. I like it! Dreamcast sold about 9 million units and SEGA decided to leave the console market.\n\nkicknz\n\n<<< Games currently playing: Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles (Wii), Metroid Prime 2: Echoes (GameCube), Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword (DS) >>>\n\nOkay, nerds, you know the routine. Top Ten GameCube games that I have played, with an emphasis on variety. Without further ado . . .\n\n#10 METAL GEAR SOLID: THE TWIN SNAKES (Konami/Silicon Knights): This is a remake, from the ground up, of Metal Gear Solid, originally for the PlayStation. The graphics and gameplay are updated and the dialogue was completely re-recorded. Unfortunately, the choppy graphics and original dialogue of the original game provided a lot of charm. In the end, this update seems unnecessary but the game is still awesome. As I play more GameCube games expect this one to fall off the list . . .\n\n#9 SOULCALIBUR II (Namco): Wikky wikky wikky wikky wakk. This is clearly the best fighting game on the GameCube (although that’s not saying much given the GameCube’s weak fighter library. SCII is a weapons-based fighter with very detailed and ridiculous fantasy-influenced character designs and even more impressive fighting environments. It was also released for PS2 and Xbox but the GameCube version has . . . Link. Zelda games are usually devoid of enemies with gigantic knockers so this is the rare opportunity for you to get your Link fix AND your jiggling, massive mammaries fix all in one place.\n\n#8 ANIMAL CROSSING (Nintendo): This is the most laid-back game that I can think of that’s worth playing. There isn’t a single stressful moment to be found. AC is an open-ended game in which you live vicariously in a darling little village, doing menial chores to earn money and speaking with your rascally animal neighbors. There isn’t an end, there are no levels, no bosses, etc. The main objectives consist of expanding your house, decorating your house, finding fossils to stock the museum, and receiving gifts. So, no, it’s not exciting but it’s still fun. Perhaps the coolest aspect of Animal Crossing is that it uses the GameCube’s internal clock and calendar and makes appropriate changes. For instance, if you play in December, the town is decorated with Christmas-style lights and the ground is covered with snow. If you play at 1 a.m. the town is basically the dead the stores are closed. Etc. etc. etc. et cetera.\n\n#7 PETER JACKSON’S KING KONG: THE OFFICIAL GAME OF THE MOVIE (Ubisoft): Yo yo yo. YO! This here is one of them licensed movie games. AND this game was obviously rushed. But you know what? It’s still really good. For most of the game, you play as Jack Driscoll, which might sound like a bummer, but it ain’t. Italics. Remember all the creepy, dark, uncomfortable, gruesome moments from the island in the movie? That’s what most of the game is. It almost plays like a fast-paced, first-person version of a Resident Evil game, but without the tedious item management. Most of the enemies are very gross and there’s definitely a feeling of “Oh, GOD, get off of me!” when they come too close. There are also a few sections where you get to play as Kong but, really, these are not up to the same standard as the Jack levels. Usually Kong is shepherded around via linear level designs and forced to engage in semi-boring fights. Also, the New York City stage is a complete letdown. But play it for the awesomely gross and creepy Jack sections.\n\n#6 METROID PRIME (Nintendo/Retro Studios): Don’t get too excited, as this game is definitely overrated but it is still great. Now you can finally see all those horrible monsters that Samus always fights but now in full 3D and from a first person perspective. Presented in this manner, many of the enemy creatures are as creepy and unappealing as your typical survival horor game. The environments are great and the action is solid. Unfortunately, the backtracking is a bit tedious compared to the 2D games.\n\n#5 PRINCE OF PERSIA: THE SANDS OF TIME (Ubisoft): That’s strange. The original Prince of Persia games from the late 80s/early 90s had the worst controls of any game ever. But this game has super smooth controls and features the most interesting platforming and acrobatics of any game this side of Mario. “Acrobat” is really the best way to describe the Prince in this game, as you make your way through sticky situations bouncing off of walls, swinging on poles, and running sideways across chasms. The coolest aspect comes in the form of the Sands of Time. With these Sands, you can reverse time when you screw up. You actually see the recent events rewinding when you use the sands, returning you to an earlier moment of your choice.\n\n#4 MARIO KART: DOUBLE DASH!! (Nintendo): Hubba hubba. When it was released, this was clearly the best Mario Kart game to date, clear to everyone except for morons and buffoons. The controls have been completely tightened up compared to MK64. The environments are great. There are a ton of great characters to play as and to unlock. For each race, you choose two characters with different attributes to switch between. And so many modes! Did you beat all four grand prixs on all the difficulty settings? Okay, here is a mirror mode to try. So try it!\n\n#3 SUPER MARIO SUNSHINE (Nintendo): Hey, baby baby, don’t say maybe! What?! A Mario game down at #3?! Yeah, sowwy. This game was highly praised when it was first released but some reason has been somewhat maligned in recent years. Completely ridiculous. This is truly a great game but in many ways it’s just not a big change from SM64. Mario controls almost the same and it feels like the SM64 game engine was used. However, the feel and identity of this game are really different. The game is BRIGHT. It’s the tropics! You run around on the beach, in a resort town, in an amusement park, in a hotel. For most of the game you have a high-pressure water nozzle that allows you to hover or attack enemies. In summary, this is a great game, just not different enough from SM64 to be the GD KING of the GameKube.\n\n#2 RESIDENT EVIL 4 (Capcom): This is probably the most critically acclaimed GameCube game, and for good reason. It really kicked the RE series in the ass and changed everything up. Instead of fixed camera angles and pre-rendered backgrounds, you now explore fully 3D environs (finally) and have an over-the-shoulder perspective, which really isn’t that different from a first-person view. It actually controls pretty similarly to Perfect Dark. The game is quite big, about twice as long as a typical RE game. The action is quite intense and, for once, there is plenty of ammo. According to some sources, you kill as many zombies/monsters as in all the previous RE games combined. The environment is really creepy and I especially like the earlier sections of the game, consisting of horrible little farming villages and brainwashed villagers. Technically, most of the enemies in this game are not zombies but actually possessed by some parasite. So the people scream when you blow their heads off with SHOTGUNS. YES.\n\n#1 PIKMIN 2 (Nintendo): I don’t think there’s anything wrong with the first Pikmin game but this one improves on it in every way. You basically play as a little guy who controls a bunch of even littler guys (up to 100 of them) to find valuable artifacts. The little Pikmin fellas can be used to do contruction work or to make more Pikmin but their primary role is to swarm all over the bastard animals that get in your way and rip them apart. You almost feel sorry for the unlucky jerks as your Pikmin climb all over them and murder them until you remember that no one matters but you and everyone else deserves to die. Amen.\n\nHONORABLE MENTION: Metroid Prime 2, Pikmin, Luigi’s Mansion, Sonic Adventure DX, Sonic Adventure 2: Battle, Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil 3, Resident Evil Code: Veronica X\n\nNOTABLE GAMES I HAVEN’T PLAYED YET: The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker & Four Swords Adventures & Twilight Princess, StarFox Adventures, Wave Race: Blue Storm, 1080 Avalanche, F-Zero GX, Resident Evil Remake, Resident Evil 0, Viewtiful Joe 1 & 2, Ikaruga, Super Monkey Ball 1 & 2, Beyond Good and Evil\n\nkicknz"
