        "text": "Welcome to WatchMojo, and today we’re counting down our picks for the Top 100 Video Games of All Time. For this list, we’ll be looking at the titles that have the best that gaming has to offer. While we’re looking at fun value as a defining factor, we’re also taking into account the impact these games have had and how they’ve influenced the industry. Which video game do you think deserves to be at the top of the list? Let us know in the comments.\n\n#100: “Pong” (1972)\n\nThis table tennis-themed game might seem simplistic now, but we have “Pong” to thank for today's gaming landscape. Its success inspired further innovation in this form of entertainment, making “Pong” an absolute trailblazer. Despite being about half a century old, it has an evergreen quality that people of any generation can enjoy. The goal of scoring the most points from one end to the next ignites a competitive spirit in players. Uncomplicated gameplay makes “Pong” arguably the most user-friendly title, encouraging even non-gamers to indulge in it. Whether it’s playing against A.I. or another person, “Pong” exemplifies the meaning behind “simple but addictive.”\n\n#99: “Psychonauts” (2005)\n\n“Psychonauts” deserves credit for its out-of-the-box style at a time when platform games had become relatively formulaic. It follows protagonist Raz as he attends a camp for people with psychic powers. The diversity of its backdrop is what truly captures players’ attention, though. Raz can access different people’s minds to help them overcome their issues. These open up various levels where each person’s thoughts give shape to unique environments. Because of this, “Psychonauts” features impressive depth in its gameplay, balancing both platforming and puzzle-solving. The central mystery surrounding the camp is engaging in its own right, complemented by Raz’s growing psychic skills. While there’s a large learning curve, perfecting “Psychonauts’” gameplay carries a definite sense of accomplishment.\n\n#98: “Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night” (2019)\n\nGaming may have evolved over the years, but Metroidvania will always remain in style. “Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night” takes players on a journey in a sprawling castle filled with obstacles and deadly enemies. Along with being a throwback to classics like “Castlevania,” the game puts its own spin on things when it comes to its graphics and combat system. A wide array of weapons allows players to seamlessly switch between them, creating a distinct style in each playthrough. “Ritual of the Night’s” 2.5D graphics add a modern touch to the Metroidvania visuals, enhancing its appeal to a wider audience. Its intriguing supernatural storyline translates well within gameplay, giving a bit of everything for fans to enjoy.\n\n#97: “Cuphead” (2017)\n\nRemember when games used to be all about silliness and fun? “Cuphead” certainly does, containing a classic era feel to its proceedings. It plays out like a “Looney Tunes” episode come to life, dropping players in a world where the protagonist fights through hordes of over-the-top enemies. While the idea of blazing through the 2D map sounds easy, “Cuphead’s” variety of bosses makes things a lot more difficult. Platforming and combat go hand in hand, meaning there’s very little margin for error. All things considered, the game manages to simultaneously be lighthearted and a challenge. It also remains memorable for the way cartoon aesthetics truly capture the thematic qualities of the game.\n\n#96: “Space Invaders” (1978)\n\nHere’s another game that changed everything for years to come. Even those who haven’t played “Space Invaders” have seen a game that was influenced by this title. The shoot-em-up genre was introduced through “Space Invaders’” success, filling up arcades worldwide as fans couldn’t get enough. Players have to contend with an alien army, with gameplay all about shooting them down before they can progress beyond borders. Of course, the endless loop means failure is inevitable, but the main appeal is about scoring the highest points. As such, most gamers know the satisfaction that comes with blitzing through enemy forces on the way to getting that top score.\n\n#95: “Castle Crashers” (2008)\n\nThis side-scrolling hack-and-slash game personifies the chaotic energy gamers want from their playthroughs. It’s a callback to a genre that’s moved on from its roots, so getting back to a simple but charming game is more than welcome. “Castle Crashers” never takes itself too seriously either, featuring plenty of humor in the protagonists’ quest to save the princesses. Since each knight has a unique ability, players can extend the game’s value by replaying with a different character. Boasting an impressive arsenal of weapons and magical abilities, “Castle Crashers” is a 2D feature that gets louder and more explosive the longer it goes. And with as many as four players possible for co-op, it’s the best game to play with friends.\n\n#94: “Crash Bandicoot: Warped” (1998)\n\nThe “Crash Bandicoot” series had been around for a while, but it was “Warped” that took its popularity to the stratosphere. It retains all of the previous installments’ strong points and doubles down on creating rich environments filled with platforming fun. Not to mention all the wacky characters and an equally offbeat story that the series excels in. No matter which time period Crash lands in, each mission has its own identity with endless replay value. “Warped” thrives on fast-paced gameplay with tense moments, as Crash has to overcome challenging obstacles and relatively tough boss fights. Still, the catchy soundtrack and vibrant level design injects a carefree atmosphere that makes this entry such a delight to play.\n\n#93: “Borderlands 2” (2012)\n\nThis first-person RPG shooter can either be completed in single-player or up to four. Either way, fans are in for a world of immersion, as the planet of Pandora has hours’ worth of content. In the quest to liberate Pandora from the clutches of Handsome Jack, the game leaves room to uncover everything from weapons, treasures, and plot-heavy choices. The RPG elements set it apart from most shooters since individual choices lead to separate scenarios. Characters are easy to relate to thanks to some smart and humorous dialogue, as “Borderlands 2” embraces its dark comedy traits. Although things can get repetitive, the addictive gameplay is such that players have no problems with going back for more.\n\n#92: “Dead Space 2” (2011)\n\nWhat’s scarier than undead creatures out to get you? That would be undead creatures in space. “Dead Space 2” has Isaac Clarke fight off an outbreak of the Necromorphs for a second time, with the body horror dialed up to eleven. There’s something dangerous lurking around every corner, but the game gives us an edge through Isaac’s awesome arsenal of weaponry, leading to fun, new ways to decapitate the encroaching horde. This blend of action and fright sets up “Dead Space 2” for the thrill ride it is. Placing us in Isaac’s shoes also gets us into his psyche, as the harsh environment takes its toll. This makes “Dead Space 2’s” horror aspect shine…even amidst the piles of corpses.\n\n#91: “Horizon Zero Dawn” (2017)\n\nA gripping story, a likable protagonist, and an open post-apocalyptic world to explore are all ingredients for a bona fide blockbuster. “Horizon Zero Dawn” centers around Aloy, a young hunter who figures out the truth about a past calamity that ravaged the Earth. With killer robots and bandits around, exploration isn’t initially easy. But leveling up the skill tree and learning the intricacies of weapon control keeps the difficulty in check as we come across new locations. Those looking for a strong narrative will find Aloy’s journey captivating all the way through. Meanwhile, gaming purists can spend hours hacking mecha-dinos, tackling side missions and uncovering every inch of this incredible world.\n\n#90: “Kingdom Hearts II” (2005)\n\nMost people would love the chance to visit this many Disney universes. “Kingdom Hearts II” makes this dream come true, bringing with it fan favorites like Mulan, Jack Sparrow, and more along for the ride. With Goofy and Donald Duck by his side, Sora’s story heads into darker territory as he tackles both the Heartless, classic Disney villains, as well as Organization XIII. Oh, and the characters from “Final Fantasy”. At its core, “Kingdom Hearts II” is a hack-and-slash RPG, where players can indulge in high-octane battles whilst indulging in the ultimate rabbit hole narrative should they be willing to make the jump.\n\n#89: “Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor” (2014)\n\n#88: “Shenmue” (1999)\n\n#87: “Team Fortress 2” (2007)\n\n#86: “Rayman Legends” (2013)\n\n#85: “Grim Fandango” (1998)\n\n“Grim Fandango” is a solid example that proves the narrative can be a game’s primary selling point. It follows Manny Calavera, who investigates the Land of the Dead to solve a brewing conspiracy. Its creative presentation comes from adapting Mexican culture using film noir as a framing device. While gameplay is very linear, the banter between the characters and the overall flow of the story removes any hint of repetition. Its use of 3D visuals keeps the story engaging, as players are encouraged to fully dive into Mexican lore. They don’t make em’ like these anymore!\n\n#84: “Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King” (2004)\n\n#83: “Stardew Valley” (2016)\n\n#82: “Dishonored” (2012)\n\n#81: “Mario Party 2” (1999)\n\n#80: “Banjo-Kazooie” (1998)\n\nGames with excessively large maps are the norm today, but “Banjo-Kazooie” wowed fans back in the day with as many as nine worlds to explore. There’s no need to worry about complex structures or difficulty spikes, as “Banjo-Kazooie” never tries to be anything but a light, fun-filled adventure. Keeping up with Nintendo’s penchant for presentation, the game instantly captures the attention. Colors pop from the screen for dazzling visuals, with its fun-filled soundtrack completing the experience. Even after all these years, this fluffy duo are still beloved\n\n#79: “The Walking Dead: Season One” (2012)\n\n#78: “Conker's Bad Fur Day” (2001)\n\n#77: “Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time” (2003)\n\n#76: “Divinity: Original Sin II” (2017)\n\n#75: “Burnout 3: Takedown” (2004)\n\nWith a focus on extreme racing and daredevil antics, “Burnout 3” easily gets the adrenaline pumping. Kicking things into overdrive, the game encourages roughhousing on the street, as players need to crash into their opponents to achieve victory. The primary objective is to win by any means necessary and the no-holds-barred content is notable for appealing to gamers who aren’t savvy in the racing genre. “Burnout 3” makes aggression a key weapon, liberating players of all worries. There’s nothing like the feeling of completing a perfect Takedown, especially because of how well it’s rendered onscreen. Add in over 60 cars, several game modes, and multiplayer, and we’ve got an exhilarating racing game in every sense of the word.\n\n#74: “Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars” (1996)\n\n#73: “Yakuza 0” (2015)\n\n#72: “Spyro: Year of the Dragon” (2000)\n\n#71: “Sly 2: Band of Thieves” (2004)\n\n#70: “Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes” (2000)\n\nMany crossover fighters might be out there, but few offer the same blockbuster action that this one provides. Rather than come across as too gimmicky, “Marvel vs. Capcom 2” justifies its existence through a diverse roster with easy to play yet hard to master fighters. Whether it’s Marvel’s Spider-Man or Capcom’s Mega Man, the game has a mouthwatering level of talent to satisfy multiple fandoms. Its animation is designed to inspire a level of familiarity, playing out like the panels of a comic book story. The fluidity of its battle system is such that players can switch between three characters without interfering with a match’s pacing. It’s an intense, fast-paced fighting game that rewards those who work on fine-tuning their combos.\n\n#69: “Dance Dance Revolution” (1998-)\n\n#68: “Diablo II” (2000)\n\n#67: “Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory” (2005)\n\n#66: “Titanfall 2” (2016)\n\n#65: “Left 4 Dead 2” (2009)\n\nGunning down the undead has never been so much fun. Stuck in a zombie apocalypse where things go completely off the rails, players can tackle this undead fire-fight in single player or up to four player co-op. Teamwork adds the required depth and variety to gameplay, as the characters need to keep each other alive to continue the campaign. The sequel in particular drastically ups the ante in terms of locations mission variety and the tightness of its controls. This is what happens when you take a simple premise and fine tune it to perfection.\n\n#64: “Metroid Prime” (2002)\n\n#63: “Celeste” (2018)\n\n#62: “Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest” (1995)\n\n#61: “Shovel Knight” (2014)\n\n#60: “Far Cry 3” (2012)\n\nAnother day, another trend-setter, one that presented players with freedom of choice in how they wanted to gun their way through a tropical, enemy-infested open world. Rook Islands is easy to get lost in, with plenty of side missions and activities in addition to its trip of a main story. Stealth your way through outposts, hunt after rare beasts, collect everything, and spruce up your arsenal. What can now be considered bloated gameplay was a breath of fresh air back during Far Cry 3’s debut. In terms of characterization, “Far Cry 3” does well with a wonderfully bizarre mix of anti-heroes and villains, especially when it comes to the likes of Vaas, who solidified himself as one of the medium’s greatest antagonists almost instantly!\n\n#59: “World of Warcraft” (2004)\n\n#58: “Ms. Pac-Man” (1982)\n\n#57: “Hollow Knight” (2017)\n\n#56: “Mortal Kombat” (2011)\n\n#55: “The Sims 2” (2004)\n\nThis sequel took the journey of life and turned it into putty for players to create their own slice of life experience! It’s impressive how even the most monotonous tasks can be fun when seen through “The Sims 2’s” lens. Players can curate everything from their avatar’s appearance to building a whole neighborhood. At the time of its release, such realism took the gaming landscape by storm, and fans wanted to explore all possibilities in store. From pursuing relationships to fine tuning character habits and furthering their careers, the game has it all. Although technically there aren’t any challenges, there’s a real sense of achievement when a Sim completes a long and happy life. Or, you know, when you inevitably destroy it all during a sadistic streak. Don’t pretend you didn’t do it!\n\n#54: “Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem” (2002)\n\n#53: “Disco Elysium” (2019)\n\n#52: “Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic” (2003)\n\n#51: “Tomb Raider: Anniversary” (2007)\n\n#50: “Wii Sports” (2006)\n\nThere was a time when it seemed like everyone was addicted to this little title! Packed with virtual versions of tennis, baseball, bowling, golf, and boxing, “Wii Sports” brought the outdoors right into players’ homes. Thanks to the ease of use, it’s a game intended simply for breezy, casual playthroughs. With the Wii’s motion sensor capabilities, the fun factor is authentic, especially for those who wanted to play with their families. Shooting for the win promotes a healthy competitive spirit that carries its own thrill. It goes to show that straightforward gameplay can be just as exciting and mainstream as any other AAA game. After over 80 million units sold, it’s the platform’s biggest success yet.\n\n#49: “GoldenEye 007” (1997)\n\n#48: “Mega Man 2” (1988)\n\n#47: Nier: Automata (2017)\n\n#46: “Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2” (2000)\n\n#45: “Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal” (2004)\n\nComplete with tongue-in-cheek humor, gadgets, and a core dynamic between the protagonists, this threequel established the series as a mainstay in the combat-platforming subgenre. Armed with over a dozen weapons, Ratchet and Clank’s battle against the maniacal Dr Nefarious is a bonanza of bullets, explosions and sci-fi goodness. Although it might seem geared toward a young audience, beating the game’s challenging difficulty is anything but child’s play. It can be merciless with the way it unleashes hordes of enemies at a moment's notice. Thanks to its stylish presentation and high-impact weapons, the game is equally rewarding as it is demanding.\n\n#44: “Persona 5” (2016)\n\n#43: “Hades” (2020)\n\n#42: “Gears of War 2” (2008)\n\n#41: “Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2” (2009)\n\n#40: “Fire Emblem: Three Houses” (2019)\n\nAwakening may have brought this franchise back to life, but Three Houses made it a mainstream superstar. The staples of its predecessors are all taken to the next level here - forging relationships, navigating the world, branching storylines, an emphasis on tactics, “Three Houses” implements them all to a tee. Put in the role of a teacher, players have to guide one of three dorms to glory as political strife and civil war threatens to consume everything. The combat cycle never gets old, but it's true strength comes from the nuance of its extensive cast, and the pain that comes when choosing a side also means potentially going against those you’ve forged a bond with. It’s easy to see why so many are still so enraptured by it.\n\n#39: “Devil May Cry 3: Dante’s Awakening” (2005)\n\n#38: “Animal Crossing: New Horizons” (2020)\n\n#37: “Chrono Trigger” (1995)\n\n#36: “The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim” (2011)\n\n#35: “Castlevania: Symphony of the Night” (1997)\n\nThe 2D side-scrolling genre was on its way out of popularity, and then Alucard burst onto the scene. It’s the reason the term “Metroidvania” has entered the pop culture lexicon, as the game revolutionized the landscape alongside the “Metroid” series. With a riveting gothic soundtrack and an eerie castle filled with monsters to slay, the game’s main starpower comes from its aesthetic value. Thanks to intricate level design, exploring Dracula’s castle is like treading into a horror story, only you get to bite back. “Symphony of the Night’s” non-linear gameplay enables players to traverse the deepest depths of the castle and fully appreciate its artistry. The game’s enduring popularity has led to several re-releases, and continues to serve as a foundational example of the medium.\n\n#34: “Uncharted 2: Among Thieves” (2009)\n\n#33: “Shadow of the Colossus” (2005)\n\n#32: “God of War” (2018)\n\n#31: “Batman: Arkham City” (2011)\n\n#30: “Undertale” (2015)\n\nAs unassuming as it is monumental, this little indie is an absolute triumph. On the face of it, the premise of guiding a lost child back to the surface is straightforward. But “Undertale’s” bullet hell mechanics and curious take on morality made this a journey to remember. Whether they’re treading the path of the Pacifist or are going full Genocide, players had to consistently tackle unconventional opponents with a highly diverse move pool. To this day, “Undertale” is easily recognizable because of its distinct character designs, minimalist approach, incredible soundtrack, and serves as living proof that sometimes an indie can be so much more than a darling - it can outshine practically everything else just by excelling in each of its implemented aspects.\n\n#29: “Fallout: New Vegas” (2010)\n\n#28: “Sonic the Hedgehog 2” (1992)\n\n#27: “Final Fantasy IX” (2000)\n\n#26: “Super Mario World” (1990)\n\n#25: “Mass Effect 2” (2010)\n\nA sequel more than worthy of being considered one of the greatest sci-game experiences to date. The focus mainly falls on assembling a crew with Commander Shepherd for a seemingly impossible mission. In addition to riveting storytelling, “Mass Effect 2’s” value is driven by its complex characters, no matter how major or minor they may be. And given how player choice can lead to their ultimate demise, the stakes could not be higher. It’s this agency combined with stellar third-person gunplay that made this the pinnacle of the trilogy, to the extent it might be impossible for the franchise to ever reach such heights again! There is only one Garrus, after all!\n\n#24: “Assassin's Creed II” (2009)\n\n#23: “Super Smash Bros: Ultimate” (2018)\n\n#22: “Red Dead Redemption 2” (2018)\n\n#21: “Portal 2” (2011)\n\n#20: “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild” (2017)\n\nTo think that after so many installments a Zelda game could shatter expectations this much is a testament to how incredible a game Breath of the Wild truly is. Hyrule has never felt more vast, and fit for uninhibited adventure, given how players are free to explore every inch of it right from the start.
