        "text": "Throughout my career, I’ve studied the “what’s next,” fascinated by seeing the future of how people and organizations can work together. I look for patterns others don’t see that illustrate how to market and promote great work in unexpected ways.\n\nFor example, several years ago I pioneered the concept of newsjacking, what I describe as the art and science of injecting your ideas into a breaking news story to generate tons of media coverage, get sales leads, and grow business. It has been a marketing strategy so popular that in 2017 newsjacking was listed in the Oxford English Dictionary and short-listed by OED for 2017 word of the year. The OED announcement read: “In the space of a few short years, newsjacking has gone from an experimental technique to a staple in every social media-savvy marketing department’s arsenal. Its contemporary iteration, however, dates from the early twenty-first century, as first popularized by marketing and sales strategist David Meerman Scott…”\n\nWhen I invented the marketing concept of newsjacking, it was brand new. Entering the word “newsjacking” into a Google search today brings up well more than 100,000 hits.\n\nI teach people around the world how to implement similar strategies to grow their business, generate attention for their ideas, and market their products and services. I do this through delivering keynote speeches around the world, conducting private masterclasses for companies, and providing self learning online learning programs including New Marketing Mastery, which I developed with Tony Robbins.\n\nEverything I do shows people how to take advantage of new real-time marketing and sales realities, setting organizations up to exceed goals by implementing new low cost (and no cost) strategies and tactics in that are proven to grow business.\n\nMy tailored presentations delve deep – offering strategies and tactics that help audiences seize the initiative, open new channels and grow their brand. These groundbreaking strategies don’t just slap social media onto dusty old strategies – they reinvent the way business engages the marketplace. Audiences walk away knowing how to use blogs, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Big Data and the newest tools like newsjacking. I also cover tactics for how to engage the media, crowd-source product development, increase sales, exert influence, disseminate ideas, build awareness and command premium prices by using speed as a strategic weapon.\n\nThree times a year, I am the lead marketing speaker at the legendary Tony Robbins Business Mastery events, delivering a two hour session on New Marketing Mastery.\n\nI customize my keynotes based on the needs of the conference organizer, the geographical location of the talk, and the demographics of the audience. Adaptations include which examples of success I showcase, the focus of the talk, the use of specific language and jargon of the industry, even the clothing I choose to wear. All of my presentations include three elements: Information, Entertainment, and Motivation.\n\nTop firms and organizations have engaged me to present at conferences, expos and meetings, among them: Cisco, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Schlumberger, PwC, GenRe, SAP, Google, Microsoft, McCormick, Nestle Purina, Amdocs, Jackson Healthcare, Ford Motor Company, Century 21, The New York Islanders, Self Storage Association, Direct Selling Association, Lewis PR, Insight, Bail USA, Sitecore, TechData, Travel Manitoba, Oticon, Selling Power Magazine, Cycling Sports Group, National Association of Elementary School Principals, Natixis Global Asset Management, Intellisphere, Mosaic, Direct Marketing Association, South-by-Southwest, National Healthcare Marketing Summit, Kronos, Public Relations Society of America, National Geographic, Ingram Micro, Abbott Medical Devices, NASDAQ Stock Market, the Government of Ontario, McKesson, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, Digital River, Hill & Knowlton, Dow Jones, SAS, National Investor Relations Institute, The Milken Institute, Entrepreneurs Organization, International Health Forum, Credit Union National Association, Giant Screen Theater Association, Realtors® Conference, National Agri-Marketing Association, Belize Tourism Industry Association and many, many more.\n\nMy advisory clients include HubSpot (NYSE: HUBS), where I also serve as Marketer in Residence. I began working with HubSpot in 2007 when the company had a handful of customers and fewer than ten employees. I helped the HubSpot team with the rapid sales and marketing strategies that have grown the company to more than 48,000 customers in 100 countries and a projected annual revenue in 2018 of $490 million.\n\nMy current portfolio of advisory clients also includes Mynd, InstaViser, Expertfile, YayPay, RISEcx, Set The Set, and SlapFive, as well as non-profits including the Grateful Dead Archive at University of California Santa Cruz and HeadCount.\n\nIn past advisory work, I contributed to successful companies as a member of the board of directors of NewsWatch KK (sale to Yahoo Japan) and Kadient (merged with Sant) and served on the board of advisors of Eloqua (IPO in mid-2012 and sale to Oracle in early 2013) and GrabCAD (sale to Stratasys in 2014).\n\nPrior to starting my own business in 2002, I held executive positions at global technology companies.\n\nAt the height of the dot-com boom, I was vice president of marketing at NewsEdge Corporation, a NASDAQ-traded online news distributor with $70 million in revenue. My multi-million dollar marketing budget included tens of thousands of dollars a month for a public relations agency, hundreds of thousands a year for print advertising and glossy collateral materials, and expensive participation at a dozen trade shows a year. My team put these things on our marketing to-do list, worked like hell to execute, and paid the big bucks because, well, that’s what one did as marketing and PR people. These efforts made us feel good because we were doing something but the programs were not producing significant, measurable results. At the same time, drawing on publishing experience I had gained in my prior position as Asia marketing director for the online division of Knight-Ridder - at the time one of the largest newspaper companies in the world - I quietly created content-rich marketing and PR programs on the Web. Against the advice of the PR agency professionals we had on retainer (who insisted that news releases were only for journalists), we wrote and sent dozens of releases ourselves. Each time we sent a release, it appeared on dozens of online services such as Yahoo!, resulting in hundreds of sales leads. Even though our advertising agency told us not to put the valuable information “somewhere where competitors could steal it,” we created a monthly online newsletter called TheEdge, with articles about the exploding world of digital news. We made it freely available on the home page of our website because it generated interest from qualified buyers.\n\nWay back in the 1990s when web marketing and PR was in its infancy, I ignored the old rules, drawing instead on my experience working at publishing companies, and created thought leadership strategies to reach buyers directly on the web.\n\nGuess what? The homegrown, do-it-yourself programs we created at virtually no cost consistently generated more interest from qualified buyers than the big bucks programs that the “professionals” were running for us—and resulted in millions of dollars in sales. People we never heard of were finding us through search engines.\n\nWow. I had stumbled on a better way to reach buyers!\n\nIn 2002, after NewsEdge was sold to The Thomson Corporation, I was fired. My ideas were a little too radical for my new bosses. So I started my own business to refine my ideas, work with select clients, and teach others through writing, speaking at conferences, and conducting seminars for corporate groups. The subject of all this work: reaching your buyers directly and driving more revenue.\n\nSince then, many new forms of social media have burst onto the scene, including blogs, podcasts, video, virtual communities, and Twitter. But what’s remained the same about all of the new web tools and techniques is that together they are the best way to communicate directly with your marketplace.\n\nThe marketing programs I have developed are responsible for selling well over one billion dollars in product and services worldwide.\n\nThe book I am best known for is The New Rules of Marketing and PR, which spent six months on the BusinessWeek bestseller list and received a starred review by Publishers Weekly. My other books include Real-Time Marketing & PR, a Wall-Street Journal and USA Today bestseller, and Marketing Lessons from the Grateful Dead, written with HubSpot CEO Brian Halligan and has become a number four bestseller in Japan.\n\nIn 2014, Marketing the Moon: The Selling of the Apollo Lunar Program was published by MIT University Press. I wrote it with marketing executive Richard Jurek and Gene Cernan—the last man to walk on the moon—wrote the foreword.\n\nThe documentary film rights to Marketing the Moon were optioned by Robert Stone Productions as the basis for his project titled Chasing the Moon, which is now in post-production with a July 2019 release to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11. The film is under fast tracked consideration to have its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in February 2019. It will also appear as a six-hour mini-series for PBS’s show American Experience and PBS says it will be the most highly promoted program on PBS in 2019. The promotional efforts around the documentary will mean that my name will be in the media during this time, allowing me to talk about being a massive fan of the Apollo lunar program as well as the ideas of Fanocracy."
