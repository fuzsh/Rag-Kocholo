        "text": "A meeting in London, coordinated by technology analyst Martin Butler, identified the need for a vendor-independent, responsive and productive way to build software. A member-based Consortium representing both users (corporates) and suppliers of technology was identified as the best way forward and the DSDM Consortium was born (DSDM = Dynamic Systems Development Method). Jennifer Stapleton, Dave Snowden (Data Sciences) and Ed Holt were amongst those ‘leading the charge’ to create the Consortium, and associate Peter Constable was instrumental in supporting the early months of the organisation and method development.\n\nFor more on the early years see the interview with Ed Holt in 2014 - Ed Holt on the driving forces behind DSDM on Vimeo\n\nThe ‘Technical Work Group’ was led by Jennifer Stapleton (then of Logica), supported by significant input from Keith Rapley (British Airways), Tony Mobbs (Data Sciences), Dai Clegg (Oracle), Paul Taylor (BT), George Hay (CMG) plus technology suppliers IBM (Rational), Sysdeco, Cognos and Select. It was a unique collaboration of competitors that delivered a draft in just 6 months.\n\nEach Working Group member led a stream, for example Tools and Techniques, Controls and Team Structures (which identified key roles and responsibilities). Both the Consortium and the Method were underpinned by a people-based approach but with rigorous controls – it is a philosophy that has endured.\n\nIn parallel there was a fast-tracking of Training Organisations, led by Julia Godwin and Jean-Anne Kirk of ICL, where companies such as Sysdeco trained DSDM practitioners; this later developed into the Training Accreditation Panel (which ensured control of what people were learning) and later the important Accredited Training Organisation (ATO) programme which is still in place today.\n\nThe Method – and all its subsequent iterations – owed everything to a small band of dedicated folk who voluntarily gave of their time, ideas, effort and commitment to create something the market needed – and (despite some rocky times ahead) proved to have a long and successful future.\n\nTo see a full interview with Jennifer: Jennifer Stapleton on the collaboration behind the method on Vimeo\n\nRecognition followed as major organisations mandated DSDM across the board in order to improve their software delivery. Companies in both the private and public sectors, from pharmaceuticals to telecoms started to adopt DSDM. It became the standard process for British Rail’s software delivery, where they were able to offer fixed price contracts, confident that the Method would deliver.\n\nThe first project in British Airways’ was delivered on time, to budget, to scope and with a delighted customer, something unheard of hitherto! DSDM was then rolled out widely and its software development productivity improved, shooting them to upper quartile; as part of that adoption Andrew Craddock (a future Technical Director and Chair) discovered DSDM!\n\nA small team in Benelux (led by Ron van Toledo and including Arie van Bennekum and Peter Coesmans, a future Consortium director) created the DSDM Consortium Benelux. They input to version 2 of the Method and ran successful projects in organisations as large and diverse as the Dutch Tax Office, the Dutch Social Security Bank and ABN Amro (which was then the largest DSDM implementation worldwide). Local Trainers and Examiners were trained up and hundreds of Practitioners were certified. Arie was later the Consortium’s representative for the signing of the Agile Manifesto.\n\nIn 2002 it was re-branded as the Agile Consortium Benelux and other techniques such as those found in XP (eg pair programming) were introduced. This was a period when the DSDM Consortium and Agile Consortium Benelux diverged but remained close in the sharing of ideas and supported each other’s’ activities such as input to version 4 and conference speaking. Innovation continued and Agile Business ideas such as self-organising teams were introduced early in Benelux. Peter Coesmans went on to work internationally at IPMA and contributed the ‘vortex’ to Agile PfM and subsequently became a director of the Agile Business Consortium.\n\nDSDM was designed as a vendor-independent approach that recognised more projects fail because of people problems rather than technology. DSDM’s focus was on helping people to work effectively together to achieve the business goals. DSDM was, and always has been, independent of tools and techniques enabling it to be used in any business and technical environment without tying the business to a particular vendor. It has been described as ‘packaged common sense’!\n\nInnovation was key and DSDM introduced new techniques to software delivery including MoSCoW (Must, Should, Could and Won’t haves – IP donated by Dai Clegg), prototyping, time-boxing and new roles such as the Business Ambassador. It also introduced integrated testing to the process.\n\nThe approval, publication and launch of DSDM version 1 happened in lightening quick time – just one month. The launch was a big affair, hosted by partner IBM and attended by leading lights in the business, technology and media worlds.\n\nDSDM Overview on Vimeo - How Does DSDM Work? | Agile Business Consortium on Vimeo\n\nProjects were already identified to pilot and test version 1 – essential if the Method was to be refined to be workable and of practicable use. Early adopters included British Rail (led by future director Barbara Roberts), British Airways, British Telecom, Allied Domecq (who even provided tots of whisky at one event!), Boston Globe (a transatlantic project with split teams led by Steve Messenger, a future Chair) and Co-op Bank (led by another future Chair, Barry Fazackerley). Feedback from these early projects informed version 2 which was published quickly in September of 1995………… although Jennifer’s summer was lost to the Method!\n\nVersion 2 introduced a fundamental tenet of the Consortium – everything is based on real feedback and practicable experience. Getting to version 2 so quickly (by using the Method) was testament to the power of the Method itself.\n\nUCLAN (the University of Central Lancashire) becomes the first University to teach DSDM in an undergraduate degree. It later became the first university to offer a Masters degree in Agile. An undergraduate courses was soon offered by London Guildhall University (by Vic Page, a future Consortium director) and later at Kingston University where both Agile Foundations and an MSc were taught. As a result of this teaching, thousands of students have now entered the workplace with a foundation in both DSDM and agile.\n\nThere was a growing need to create pathways for the professional development of DSDM practitioners. Practical experience was always more important than theory so oral exams which tested that experience was the preferred model. Director of Professional Development, Barbara Roberts, led the work that created the DSDM Practitioner, Trainer and Coach qualifications. An Advanced Practitioner evolved over the years to become the Agile Professional award. As part of the process Examiners were trained and appointed to test the students. Unfortunately the idea to create a Programme Management course was rejected at this time – and it took a further 15 years before that qualification emerged!\n\nThe DSDM Consortium is a Co-signatory with 16 other organisations of the Agile Manifesto for Software Development – and the only one not based in the US. This historic event was held at Snowbird in Utah and the Consortium was represented by Arie van Bennekum from Benelux. Getting a late call up, Arie was travelling for 20 hours before 3 days of work with the others, including Ken Schwaber, Jeff Sutherland (who together created Scrum) and Alistair Cockburn. Arie had to leave promptly because of the risk of avalanches in the valley and got home to find there had been a fire at his house! As he maintains, it was an interesting time but a life-changing event.\n\nThe Manifesto has been adopted worldwide and translated into many languages; the authors deliberately decided not to publish a version 2, letting the original stand, though they did gather for a 10 year anniversary in 2011. The creation of the Manifesto led eventually to the formation of the Agile Alliance, another membership body still promoting agile, especially in the IT domain. Being involved in creating and signing the Agile Manifesto gave considerable weight to the Consortium’s place in the wider agile community.\n\nThe 12 Principles of the Agile Manifesto were (and still are):\n\nSATISFY THE CUSTOMER - Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable solutions\n\nWORK TOGETHER - Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project\n\nWORKING SOLUTIONS - Working solutions is primary measure of progress\n\nSIMPLICITY - Simplicity - the art of maximising the amount of work not done - is essential\n\nWELCOME CHANGE - Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage\n\nMOTIVATED INDIVIDUALS - Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done\n\nSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT - Agile process promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely\n\nSELF- ORGANISING TEAMS - The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organising teams\n\nDELIVER SOLUTIONS FREQUENTLY - Deliver working solutions frequently from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale\n\nFACE-TO-FACE CONVERSATION - The most effective and efficient method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation\n\nCONTINUOUS ATTENTION - Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility\n\nREFLECT AND ADJUST - At regular intervals the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly\n\nFor more information see Manifesto for Agile Software Development (agilemanifesto.org)\n\nThe middle years of the 2000s were the ‘tough times’- corporate membership started to decline as some of the original protagonists moved on and cost cutting was rife in IT. Revenue from the annual Conference kept the Consortium afloat but cash flow was very tight and there were fears for the future of the Consortium……Directors were even bringing their own sandwiches for lunch to meetings! But a committed band of members, user organisations and the board felt there was value in DSDM and that it should be kept going – they were correct and it did have a flourishing future, as the rest of the history shows.\n\nThe Method had, to date, only been available to members of the Consortium. In a significant move to help drive wider adoption, the Consortium decided to ‘open up’ the Method so that anyone could use it – free to view , free to use. This was a significant move that got the message out there and helped position the Consortium and the Method as something accessible to all, not just members.\n\nThe CEO of APMG International, Richard Pharro, had identified a gap in the market for an agile approach to Project Management (complementing their successful Prince 2 offering). After discussions with Consortium Chair Steve Messenger and CEO Mary Henson, APMG and the Consortium developed a close relationship, investing to develop AgilePM as a standalone product.\n\nThe agreement allowed APMG to distribute AgilePM in over 160 different territories and was subsequently developed to include other products (eg AgileBA, AgilePgM); this helped the Consortium broaden both its offers and its footprint. It proved to be a far-sighted move, providing APMG with a market-leading product for its examinations, and helping the Consortium with market penetration, revenue and credibility in the Agile PM space….. now over 157,000 Agile PM exams have been taken.\n\nRichard commented “The relationship with the Consortium has always been positive, working in a genuinely open, collaborative and agile way. Agile PM was developed in the spirit of mutual partnership and is a hugely successful product for us both; it continues to be in demand across the world.”\n\nFor more information on APMG, see APMG International.\n\nThe DSDM Ambassador Programme was created to expand the geographic scope of the Consortium and the Method; with the sponsorship of director Islam Choudhury, the programme created a network of Ambassador across the globe. Ambassadors committed their time voluntarily, working under a Memorandum of Understanding and holding monthly online meetings, making personal connections at the annual Conference. As well as the major European countries - France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Ireland and Poland - the Consortium’s footprint spread to the USA, Australia and as far as China. Demand was strong and success stories included local translations of DSDM publications into French, German and Polish.\n\nIn order to build a strong research base for the benefits of agile, the Consortium worked with a number of leading academics and researchers to create ARN. The Agile Research Network (ARN) is a collaboration of researchers from two UK universities at the forefront of investigating agile methodologies.\n\nThe Open University has a strong record of research in the use of agile methods in practice\n\nThe University of Central Lancashire has a stronger teaching focus amongst Undergraduate level (from 1996), a practitioner-focussed Masters programme, and a growing agile research group\n\nThe Consortium, as a co-sponsor, funded an initial Research Associate post and subsequently a number of others. The focus of ARN has always been applied research focussing on practical help as well as rigorous academic output. Its research and other papers can be found at https://agileresearchnetwork.org/.\n\nBy 2016 it was becoming apparent that agile approaches were needed across the board, not just in IT and software development, so the Board of the Consortium, under the chairmanship of Steve Messenger, made a significant strategic move to broaden its scope. After a 3 month feasibility study at the start of 2016, and an implementation period across the summer, the announcement of the new positioning, name and branding was made at the annual Agile Business Conference.\n\nA wider foundation was needed to underpin the development of Business Agility so the Consortium, under the guidance of Product Architect Andrew Craddock, began work on the Agile Business Framework. It was important to extend the good knowledge and experience gained in agile projects into an agile approach for business more widely, and a team came together to create the Agile Business Framework.\n\nThe model included components for Agile Strategy, Agile Culture, Agile Leadership, Agile Governance and Agile Operations and was developed with input from a much broader range of new Partners. For more information, see What is Business Agility?\n\nThe wider Business Agility model needed a broader set of inputs and the Consortium was fortunate to work with domain experts who – in line with Consortium’s ethos - contributed time, ideas and content.\n\nPioneering development work on Agile Leadership and Agile Culture was led by Katie Taylor and supported by Ed Holt; it owed much to new partners from different organisations making significant contributions in a range of domains:- Mark Buchan, Alan Furlong, Barbara Bird, Rod Willis and Parag Gogate. They worked in a collegiate way bringing multiple perspectives to gain a common understanding which led to the creation of a new and rich set of material – which is still the basis of the Consortium’s Culture and Leadership work.\n\nAgile Portfolio Management provides guidance for the higher levels of an organisation, showing how to keep delivery of initiatives focused on delivering the strategy, as well as ensuring the strategy remains current in a time of constant change.\n\nAgile Portfolio Management provides a light framework of practices, all based on common sense and proven best practices, which can help senior management make sense of the constantly changing pipeline of initiatives calling for budget and resources. Find out more about the Agile Portfolio Management (AgilePfM) handbook.\n\nAgile PfM was first launched to great acclaim in Australia on Barbara’s 2017 trip and then in 2018 in the UK.\n\nMary, who was an original member of the Consortium team, celebrated 23 years with the Consortium, the last 17 as CEO. At her retirement she commented “What stands out for me is the degree of collaboration, sharing and effort that so many people have put in over the years. There have been difficult times but the highlights far outweigh them. We have come a long way and done so with commitment – and a lot of good humour.”\n\nDeveloped in collaboration with The Open University (OU) this is a new 12-week microcredential to equip managers and leaders with the tools and techniques to navigate complex challenges and environments.\n\nAgile Leadership and Management is hosted on the OU’s leading social learning partner platform, FutureLearn. This microcredential provides a solid foundation and introduction to Agile Leadership and Management, combining research and evidence-based training with good practice principles and tools.
