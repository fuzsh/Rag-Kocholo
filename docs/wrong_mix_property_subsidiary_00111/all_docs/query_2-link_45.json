        "text": "Integrating Oracle with External eCommerce Solutions\n\nMaximize Business Potential while Keeping Costs Down\n\nOracle eBusiness suite to an existing eCommerce integration can help you grow your enterprise. It allows individualized interaction with customers, providing them personalized service and support with scalability.\n\nYou need discreet task-specific integration with business-oriented workflows and data transformations to ensure a scalable, robust platform.\n\nThe Oracle eBusiness suite or EBS system offers EBS API rest endpoints, as well as PL/SQL rest endpoints. These are customizable through the configurator. So, you can essentially expose any of the core entities, as well as custom fields within your Oracle EBS system and the eCommerce platformâs web API framework also leverages a rest endpoint.\n\nQueue-based Task Engine\n\nWhenever the marketing teams update this information on the frontend, it is important to ensure that the new information is preserved.\n\nHowever, there might be details inside of Oracle that might have changed. These can include pricing data, inventory information, etc. All this updated information needs to be intricately brought back into your eCommerce system. However, only the new data needs to be changed. Therefore, we recommend an integration with Oracle EBS that includes a queue-based persistent task engine. It allows you to set up workflows based on what makes sense for your business.\n\nTypically, it breaks down different tasks based on how your business is configured and what makes the most sense for your end-users. These tasks may be related to the catalog system, customers and accounts, ordering information, shipments and status, payments, users, location information, etc. Therefore, it is necessary to have a discreet scheduling logic to ensure specific workflows and data transformations for each task.\n\nCommon Integrations\n\nSome of the most common integrations include customers and accounts, addresses and contacts, pricing information, tax levels, locations, credit limits, tax exemption status, past order history, etc.\n\nNow some of these integrations can be a two-way between existing systems and Oracle EBS. It is also possible to initially see the data from Oracle and then maintain a flow from between systems. You can also have data flow in the opposite direction. However, having it flow both ways is critical especially when you are integrating customers and accounts. So, whenever a user visits your eCommerce platform, the integration to Oracle EBS is seamless.\n\nFor example, in many cases, there are customer-specific or company-specific price rules or locations. So, it is important that the system is able to tie back users to the underlying company, so they receive company-specific pricing levels. You can leverage user creation and have a domain-based email claiming system or address/account number information claiming system to do this. This is just one of the many ways to customize the user and their experience through advanced Oracle EBS integration into your existing eCommerce platform.\n\nOrder Information Integration\n\nApart from this, it is also possible to integrate sales, orders, invoices, and quotes. Again, this can be a one way or two-way integration between the systems. It may include things like the overall details of the order. So, for instance, someone goes to your eCommerce site and places an order, the order and all the associated information get sunk into Oracle EBS. The data includes the line items, tax information, product-specific tax classes, shipping information, delivery fee, customs and duties, any discounts, items ordered, payment information, and transaction data, etc.\n\nIt makes it easier to fetch profile information, transaction IDs, and order information. So, you can effectively handle any customer service requests like refunds. You would be able to track all this information between Oracle EBS and eCommerce systems.\n\nUltimately, we recommend that you explore all of the scenarios. However, most of the time it is common to have invoices go from Oracle EBS so that users can pay for invoices from Oracle EBS inside of your eCommerce instance. Similarly, quotes can go from Oracle EBS into an eCommerce platform. They can be converted into what are called \"negotiable checkouts\" or \"negotiable quotes\". Essentially, end users can then pay for them inside your platform after which they are sent back to Oracle EBS as an order.\n\nHow Can Clarity Help\n\nAdapting the Integrations to Business Logic\n\nYou can match the core business workflows to your integration. Instead of letting your business logic be driven by the integration, you should make the integration adapt to your business logic. Therefore, we recommend working with an experienced partner.\n\nSomeone with experience will be aware of all the options available to fully take advantage of the offerings of both Oracle EBS and your existing platform web API. They can ensure you get the best automation and personalization while also keeping scalability and redundancy of the platform in mind.\n\nIf you have any more questions related to this topic, we encourage you to reach out to our experienced team.
