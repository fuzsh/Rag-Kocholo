This means that you can easily leverage APIs without writing code.\n\nThe following activities are available for databases:\n\nBatch Insert\n\nDelete Record\n\nInsert Record\n\nQuery Multiple\n\nQuery Record\n\nStored Procedure\n\nUpdate Record\n\nFor more information, refer to the process activities for database in Process Builder.\n\nLookups in eForm Builder\n\nYou can create lookups for MySQL databases in eForm Builder and form-based apps.\n\nA lookup is an automated procedure that retrieves data from an external data source, such as a database or third-party service, to display runtime. For example, you can use a lookup to populate the options in a list on an eForm.\n\nFor more information, refer to Database Auto-Lookup configuration.\n\nThis image is only one example configuration screen from the Auto-Lookup form control. It does not show all the configuration options, and lookups can be configured and executed in multiple ways. The Auto-Lookup control can perform a lookup for eForms or other controls. However, many other form controls have built-in lookup capabilities â for example, the Drop-Down List form control. For information about how to configure lookups, refer to eForm Controls.\n\nAccess Tokens\n\nYou can create access tokens for MySQL.\n\nAn access token is a secure object that stores an endpoint (usually a URL) and authentication credentials to connect to a service or technology. Often this is an external or third-party service, like Salesforce or SharePoint, but access tokens can also connect to an AgilePoint NX enviornment, local database, or other types of technologies. Once an access token is created, app designers can simply select and reuse it, rather than entering the credentials each time they are needed.\n\nFor more information, refer to Access Token for Database."
