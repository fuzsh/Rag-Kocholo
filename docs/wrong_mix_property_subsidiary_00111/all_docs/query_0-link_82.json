        "text": "From day one, SOLIDWORKS built its Partner Program to provide you with opportunities to improve the way you work. With more than 300 top solution partners worldwide, the Partner Program gives you direct access to fully integrated products and services that enable you to maximize productivity, design innovative products, and achieve your product development goals. At SOLIDWORKS World 2016, you have the opportunity to try out the latest solutions that were designed specifically for you.\n\nThe Partner Pavilion will feature over 110 exhibitors ranging from hardware and CAM to software and 3D printing. While you’ll spend most of your days learning about new SOLIDWORKS features, tips and tricks, make sure to schedule some time to meet with exhibitors who are ready to help you meet your design potential. Here are four more software partners that you can learn from in the Partner Pavilion.\n\nLogopress\n\nFor over 25 years, Logopress Corp has focused its business on developing software solutions dedicated to the tool & die industry and to flatten any complex 3D shape. Logopress is a great add-on that transforms the power of SOLIDWORKS CAD into a tool die for designers and users who need to flatten complex 3D parts and potentially get formability information. The result: users typically become between 30 and 60 percent more productive.\n\nIf you work in the tool and die industry or need to flatten 3D complex parts, a stop by booth 528 is a must. There you can receive a quick demo of the Logopress3 product line including Logopress3 Die Design, Logopress3 Flattening and Logopress3 Nesting, while discussing how the software can fit your specific needs.\n\nOrigin International\n\nOrigin develops and markets dimensional metrology software for quality professionals and manufacturing engineers to all major industries. The company has more than 20 years of experience providing metrology solutions to meet your most demanding requirements.\n\nOrigin’s CheckMate is fully integrated with SOLIDWORKS and offers solutions for quality professionals and manufacturing engineers alike. Of particular significance at SWW16 is the high-level of interest surrounding the development and implementation of Model-Based Definition (MBD). If you’re interested in MBD, you will have the opportunity to see how CheckMate works with SOLIDWORKS’ industry leading MBD functionality and learn first-hand about the benefits this combination provides. Stop by booth 404 to see how CheckMate closes the loop from design engineering to the quality lab to manufacturing back to Design, to deliver better products faster.\n\nXPLM\n\nXPLM is an IT company specializing in analysis and definition of PLM business processes and planning to executing implementations, data migration, training, and operational support. The company connects users with highly qualified implementation experts with focused CAD/PLM skills and experience. XPLM also offers the next generation of SOLIDWORKS and SOLIWORKS Electrical connectors to any PLM system. In addition, the company provides SOLIDWORKS EPDM connectors for Oracle Agile PLM and SAP PLM. Stop by booth 435 and discuss your PLM strategy and challenges with XPLM’s experts.\n\nRAPID\n\nNeed a quick turnaround on prototype sheet metal and machined parts? RAPID has a solution. The company recently developed a free add-in for SOLIDWORKS that allows you to quote sheet metal parts within SOLIDWORKS, instantly. By providing you with feedback regarding proper sheet metal design for manufacturing, RAPID addresses a very common problem: the increasing pressure to produce quotes and parts instantly. If deadlines are a constant headache, RAPID offers relief by providing quotes for machined and turned parts within 24 hours.\n\nThe add-in also provides design feedback regarding proper sheet metal design for manufacturing. This addresses a very common problem for many mechanical and design engineers with tight deadlines to get quotes & parts instantly. Rapid Machining quotes machined & turned parts within 24 hours. All parts are shipped in days, not weeks.\n\nIn addition to learning about how RAPID can improve your process and quote sheet metal parts instantly within SOLIDWORKS, you’ll have the opportunity to participate in two fun events at booth 628. The first involves a quoting contest. So step on up to the RAPID boot and compete to see who can design and quote parts the fastest! In addition to bragging rights, winners will take home one of several great prizes. The second event puts you in the starring role. Flip your camera around and put on your best mug for the RAPID selfie station. The station will be open each day, but during a special time period a SOLIDWORKS celebrity will be present to pose with you (selfie stick not included). Be sure to follow @QuickTurnParts for announcements on when the special guest will arrive.\n\nRemember: the Partner Pavilion is located in Hall C and will be open during the following hours:\n\nSunday, January 31:\n\nWelcome Reception 5:30 PM to 7:30 PM\n\nMonday, February 1:\n\n11:30 AM to 4:30 PM\n\nTuesday, February 2:\n\n11:30 AM to 4:30 PM\n\nWednesday, February 3:\n\n10:00 AM to 2:30 PM"
