In 2010, he was named a COPU Think Tank Advisor, which recognizes key global thought leaders in open source software. That same year, he was named a CEO of the Year finalist by the Mass Technology Leadership Council.\n\nThe University's success can be measured by the invitation to join the Association of American Universities (AAU) in 2012 and by the almost 76,000 students applying for the fall 2021 freshman class. Revenue for research has risen by 90% to $574 million annually.

His mantra of “commit, then figure it out” allows him to convene a disparate team of hackers, doers, makers, and thinkers to create devices that better the world by bringing accessibility for all. This unconventional approach brought to life highly acclaimed initiatives—the EyeWriter, Project Daniel, Don’s Voice and most recently Music: Not Impossible—that brought the ability to draw back to a paraplegic street artist, 3D-printed arms to Sudanese amputees, a “voice” to an ALS patient who hadn’t spoken in 15 years, and wearables that let deaf and hearing people alike feel music in a “surround body” experience.\n\nWorking with a wide array of Fortune 500 companies, Ebeling not only pushes the bar on innovation, he also shares the emotionally resonating story of doing so. These narratives of overcoming seemingly impossible odds to “Help One. Help Many.” have inspired people across the world to do the same. Ebeling’s book, “Not Impossible: The Art and Joy of Doing What Couldn't Be Done,” recounts the life experiences that led to the founding of Not Impossible. Published in a multitude of languages, the book was hailed as “a unique and inspiring tale of brave abandon” by Nicholas Negroponte. Named one of Wired’s “Agents of Change,”, a two-time SXSW innovation of the year award winner, a two-time Tribeca Disruptor innovation winner, a fellow with The Nantucket Project, and recipient of every major creative and advertising award, Ebeling is on a mission to provide “Technology for the Sake of Humanity.” By tapping into a community of passionate and talented engineers, makers, idea generators, and storytellers, Ebeling is making the inconceivable, the unbelievable, and the impossible, Not Impossible.\n\nFor over a decade, he’s performed with some of the world’s greatest symphony orchestras, and currently serves as the first ever Artistic Advisor to the National Symphony Orchestra at the Kennedy Center.\n\nFolds, who was on tour in Australia when the pandemic hit in early 2020, has been holed up in Sydney, writing new music for his next album, working on his second book, and doing live streams for his patrons on Patreon. In June, he wrote and released a new single entitled “2020” on the turmoil of the past few months.\n\nAn outspoken champion for arts education and music therapy funding in our nation's public schools, in 2016 Ben held the distinction as the only artist to appear at both US national political conventions advocating for arts education, has served for over 5 years as an active member of the distinguished Artist Committee of Americans For The Arts (AFTA), and serves on the Board of AFTA’s Arts Action Fund.\n\nHe made his feature screenwriting and directorial debut with Don Jon (Independent Spirit Award nomination, Best First Screenplay). Joseph Gordon-Levitt is also the founder and acting CEO of the online creative platform, HITRECORD.\n\nHITRECORD is an online creative platform with a growing worldwide community of over 850,000 people. The platform empowers artists around the world to start their own creative projects, and to invite others to collaborate with them.

Their first television show, HITRECORD On TV, won an EMMY in the category of Outstanding Achievement in Interactive Media.\n\nIn recent years, Gordon-Levitt has become a thought leader in exploring the relationship between technology and creativity. In his latest talks, Gordon-Levitt examines the unintended side effects of social media culture on our creative and mental wellbeing. Drawing from his unique perspective as an artist, entrepreneur, and his years of experience in the spotlight of Hollywood, Gordon-Levitt delivers dynamic talks and presentations that shed light on internet culture, collaboration, and creativity. He’s spoken everywhere from TED to TechCrunch and AT&T. His 2019 TED talk has nearly four million views.\n\nPreviously, Nanjiani starred in and wrote The Big Sick, which was nominated for an Oscar for Original Screenplay.\n\nOn television, Nanjiani and his wife, Emily V. Gordon, currently serve as executive producers on the Apple TV+ series Little America, which was renewed for a second season ahead of its series debut which released on January 17, 2020. Nanjiani also reprised his starring role as Dinesh on the sixth and final season of the Emmy Award-winning HBO comedy series Silicon Valley. Nanjiani has also joined the cast of the upcoming Obi-Wan Kenobi show on Disney Plus.\n\nMost recently, while in quarantine, Nanjiani and Gordon created the podcast, Staying In with Emily and Kumail, while in quarantine. Staying In donated all proceeds to charities helping those affected by COVID‑19."
