        "text": "Today I did a keynote for Rabobank's Engineer's Week, their internal tech conference with 1000+ people. It was about #teamtopologies, designing teams for #fastflow of change and reducing team #cognitiveload It was great and I already got more than a dozen messages in a couple of hours from (formerly) unknown people and one thing strikes a chord: \"Yeah, it makes sense and it's almost obvious... but how do we implement it?\". I wish I had a one-size-fits-all answer, but I don't. Now I'm one of the people in Europe that facilitate this in different organizations with the amazing work that many others do. Think of Nick Tune ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦, Sarah Wells, Manuel Pais (Team Topologies) ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¸, Sophie Weston, JoÃ£o Rosa, Susanne Kaiser, Matthew Skelton, Victoria Morgan-Smith, Eduardo da Silva, Clement Pickering, Elizabeth Ayer, Rachael Wonnacott and many more. One thing we have in common? We are all connected to #devops, #ddd, #wardleymaps, #sociotechnical systems, #architecture, #humane systems, #lean, #deming and much more. We stand on the should of giants, identifying patterns and good practices to add to our toolbelt. #teamtopologies created a language that allow us to communicate and identify these in a better and more concise way. But in the end, we all know nothing will work if we don't have #psychologicalsafety. So if there one thing you can take away from all these \"Here is how to transform your business\": Start with kindness. That will nurture the safety that people and teams need to achieve the change that is needed. Then you can start using the tools and patterns that me and these brilliant people codified. Reach out and let's host some workshops on these topics. Then we can identify which windmills you should fight or not (yes, this is a Don Quijote reference... again), and how to get leadership buy-in...\n\nLeaders, there's a tell-tale sign of toxic culture. It's constant (negative) gossip. You'll hear: I heard that... I can't believe it... Did you hear about... Guess what so-and-so did... You won't believe what I just found out... And you'll overhear the whispers all over like: Cubes Hallways Elevators Watercoolers Restrooms (yep) There is only one problem. Workers are talking to each other. Not you. In today's newsletter, I share what you can do. And why it could be tied to burnout. PS:) Want more helpful tips? See the first comment."
