        "text": "Product Overview\n\nOracle Cloud PLM is a product lifecycle management solution that streamlines workflows and improves decision-making throughout the product lifecycle. It centralizes product data, enhancing collaboration and information sharing across teams. ts key features include innovation management, product development, quality management, product master data management, and configurator modeling. Additionally, it reduces costs and scales effectively to accommodate business growth, backed by robust security features.\n\nPros\n\nConfigurable using low-code embedded solutions.\n\nIntegrates customer feedback with product insights.\n\nEmbedded analytics.\n\nQuarterly updates\n\nCons\n\nCustomizations may require deeper technical expertise.\n\nReports not readily structured for Excel, complicating graph generation\n\nTarget Market\n\nLarge-scale enterprises and organizations in highly regulated industries that require comprehensive lifecycle management and detailed compliance tracking.\n\nVideo Overview\n\nKey Features\n\nKey features of Oracle PLM Cloud products include:\n\nIdea creation and collaboration\n\nTranslation of ideas through requirements\n\nDevelop and evaluate concept alternatives\n\nRequirement fulfillment\n\nDevelop a business case\n\nCreate and analyze portfolio scenarios\n\nItem and BOM definition\n\nComprehensive quality solution\n\nDesign for quality\n\nIntegrated quality management\n\nOptionally integrate quality specifications\n\nRe-use of existing parts\n\nAnalyze BOM commercialization readiness\n\nFlexible workflow route change approvals\n\nChange cycle time analysis\n\nPervasive social collaboration\n\nIntegrations to Oracle EBS and ERP Cloud\n\nPre-built analytics and dashboards\n\nProject execution management\n\nProject financial management\n\nProject analytics and insight\n\nKey Benefits\n\nKey benefits of using Oracle PLM Cloud products include:\n\nImproved return on innovation\n\nLow upfront investment\n\nSubscription based pricing\n\nRapid ROI\n\nFaster and easier deployment\n\nMinimal Risk\n\nProtected IP in your own private database\n\nHigh levels of security, scalability, reliability\n\nFewer required resources\n\nReduced cost of quality\n\nIncreased customer satisfaction\n\nAccelerated time-to-market\n\nPricing\n\nStarts at $350/month/user\n\n10 user minimum\n\nWe are operating on Oracle Agile for our PLM needs and when we received the update that they were sunsetting Agile, we of course viewed the most practical next step was to move to Oracle Cloud PLM. However after doing a demo of the system we found it very rigid. Our business requires us to be able to customize across BOMs and engineering reports, something Agile was great at. With the Cloud PLM, it did not offer the same customizable features, and we found we would be left with numerous workarounds. We have since begun exploring outside of Oracle’s PLM offerings.\n\nI’ve implemented Oracle PLM and can keep all ideas captured internally and externally in a central repository so they can be easily analyzed, assessed, and prioritized.\n\nEmployees can search for ideas and collaborate on ideas quickly and easily. There is a built-in social network to collaborate and use dashboards to visualize analytics to make fast well-informed decisions.\n\nOne of the key advantages to having the Oracle PLM cloud is having that data and process in one place.\n\nNBTY is in the business of wellness. We hold ourselves to high standard. We chose Oracle because we were able to configure it to our needs and connected to our existing PLM system."
