Most of us prefer one or the other. Our outdoor extraordinaire Bruce enjoys the best of both worlds. You only live once right?\n\nBruce, one of our founding shareholders enjoys a range of leisure activities. His many tales could keep us enthralled for hours, including underwater adventures diving with Whalesharks, Sunfish and Sea Lions in the Galapagos Islands, exploring wrecks in the Solomon Islands and snorkelling with Humpback whales in Tonga. Bruce has a policy of visiting a new exotic dive location with friends every year. Not only does Bruce enjoy being underwater, he is also a windsurfer, rock climber, salsa dancer, skier and snowboarder, keeping fit for all of this by playing squash (we’re not sure this guy sleeps). He recalls one of his scariest experiences while snowboarding the back bowls of the Remarkables (New Zealand) Ski field alone nearly falling into a crevasse. Now that’s scary!\n\nBruce’s (best kept hidden) talent of singing, once brought him near childhood fame when he starred as Kurt in the Sound of Music, however these days you’re more likely to hear him singing Bee Gees hits in the shower.\n\nProfessionally, Bruce boasts humble beginnings as an auditor but quickly escaped into software development, writing numerous Dbase III based systems, eventually building a Job Costing system in Informix.

Following her degree, she moved to the U.S for Oracle E-Business Suite implementation and support services and has been working in this space for 15+ years. Her knowledge of EBS has taken her across many different customers across the world helping implement various modules.\n\nRachana decided to join the More4apps team when she wanted a change to the products world from the IT services sector. She enjoys working with different clients and businesses as they have a variety of challenges. When she’s not at work, she enjoys reading, watching Science or History channels with her sons, hiking, biking and exploring countryside trails. Never forgetting her roots, her song of choice at karaoke would be the very popular Bollywood classic – Chura Liya hai tumne jo.\n\nAurelie or Lily as most people call her joined More4apps in 2018 as part of the US presales team. She brought a 7 years-Oracle-experience to the company, having helped lots of customers implement and support Oracle EBS in France and New Caledonia prior to working at More4apps.\n\nAfter a few years enjoying sunny California, she moved back to her homeland, France in 2020, bogging in cheese, baguette and croissants since then! Lily is a self described foodie – loves discussing food, cooking and gets grumpy if not fed on a regular basis!\n\nWhen not eating, she enjoys outdoor activities, like climbing, kite surfing (basically using a kite to jump and spin, but in reality she spends more time crashing into the water), and wakeboarding (basically another sport that ruins your knees before you turn 35).\n\nShe also volunteers in a community garden and a few climate change focused organizations.\n\nAfter working in New Zealand’s biggest city, Brent Moran wanted a change, to escape the big city life of endless commutes. 15 years later that change sees him as Development Manager at More4apps.\n\nMoran was brought onboard to develop training tools such as videos and documentation for customers, along with programming. IT was not his original career choice, he studied and gained a degree in Physics.\n\nWhen asked what advice he would give his 18-year-old self he comments “don’t do physics do IT!” But he also has found that doing your research and learning from others extremely beneficial and urges others to try not to be afraid to upskill on areas you may not be as strong on. An example could be joining toastmasters to develop skills in public speaking. Don’t underestimate the value of soft skills!\n\nHis advice for those new to software development is that a software product is much larger than the code. Support, maintenance, documentation, and testing are a much larger part of the product than the code itself. And, the quicker the code is written usually the more costly the product will be in terms of support and maintenance. Also, it is important to understand that there is a big difference between software that needs to work on hundreds of sites worldwide as opposed to in-house software and software for single sites.\n\nAnd one final piece of advice “If you can’t look after yourself – you can’t look after your customers”."
