Georgia has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest nine times, debuting at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007. Although Georgia did plan to participate in the 2009 contest, it decided to withdraw after the EBU demanded it re-write its song, which made reference to the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.

It was speculated that Georgia could be banned from participating in 2015, 2016 and 2017 due to strong rules made by the EBU on voting, as their jury votes were declared invalid by the EBU - the jury members had the same results. However, this turned out to be false.

On its first few appearances, the country mainly sent songs in English. In 2012, Anri Jokhadze partially incorporated the Georgian language into his song I'm a Joker, the first time the language was used in the contest. Six years later, Iriao sang their entry For You entirely in Georgian for the first time. Despite finishing last in their semi-final, it did not stop the country from sending in another Georgian-language song the following year.

They had a jarring non-qualification streak for 7 years after 2016. which they finally broke in 2024, when Nutsa Buzaladze represented the country.
