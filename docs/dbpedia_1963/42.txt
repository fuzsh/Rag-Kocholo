Irina Khechanovi, known by her stage name Iru, is a Georgian singer and songwriter of Armenian descent. She gained fame as a member of the girl group Candy, who won the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2011 with "Candy Music" . In 2023, she won the fifth season of The Voice Georgia, earning the opportunity to represent Georgia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2023 held in Liverpool, UK, with her song "Echo".

Born on December 3, 2000, in Tbilisi, Khechanovi participated in various singing competitions as a child. She competed in Georgian Idol in 2019 and released her debut solo single "No Jerk Around Me" in 2021.

In 2022, Khechanovi performed at the Junior Eurovision Song Contest as part of a previous winners' medley and co-wrote the Georgian entry "I Believe" by Mariam Bigvava, which placed third. Later that year, she competed in The Voice Georgia and emerged as the winner on February 2, 2023. Her entry for Eurovision, "Echo," was released in March 2023. Iru, a talented musician who rose to fame on The Voice, wowed audiences with their impressive covers of "Rise Like A Phoenix" and "Euphoria" .

Their newest release, "Echo", is a captivating fusion of various music styles that draws inspiration from Georgia's previous ESC entries, such as Sopho's "Visionary Dream" and Diana Gurtskaya's "Peace Will Come". Despite its influences, "Echo" stands on its own as a unique and original song that showcases Iru's artistic talents. The video-clip for the song is stunning, but the question remains whether or not the ambiance can be replicated on the grand stage in Liverpool. Regardless, this is undoubtedly one of Georgia's strongest entries in years, and they hope to recapture their previous success with this outstanding composition.
