Hi there,

Since Latvia just wrapped, time for another smaller country to face the Classic Elimination Game. I have not seen a Georgia-Version here so I figured it might be time to complete the Caucasus.

You know the rules (I hope), you may vote for one entry per day (00:00-23:59 of your time zone; you may vote once at 23:59 on one day and one minute later on the next day at 00:00 if you wish so, but then have to wait for 24 hours). Last song Unsafe gets eliminated each round, last song standing wins (I did not consider 2009 because it was withdrawn. Let me know if we should add it).

These are your picks:

2007: Sopho - Visionary Dream

2008: Diana Gurtskaya - Peace Will Come

2010: Sofia Nizharadze - Shine

2011: Eldrine - One More Day

2012: Anri Jokhadze - I‘m a Joker

2013: Nodi Tatishvili and Sophie Gelovani - Waterfall

2014: The Shin and Mariko - Three Minutes to Earth

2015: Nina Sublatti - Warrior

2016: Nika Kocharov and Young Georgian Lolitaz - Midnight Gold

2017: Tamara Gachechiladze - Keep The Faith

2018: Ethno-Jazz Band Iriao - For You

2019: Oto Nemsadze - Keep On Going

2020: Tornike Kipiani - Take Me As I Am

2021: Tornike Kipiani - You

2022: Circus Mircus - Lock Me In

2023: Iru - Echo
