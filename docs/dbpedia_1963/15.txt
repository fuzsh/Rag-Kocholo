Back in 2007, Sopho Khalvashi represented Georgia at it's Eurovision debut. With the song Visionary Dream, she reached the final and finished 12th. The following year, Diana Gurtskaya came 11th - and Georgia had established themselves as a country to watch out for.

In 2009, EBU however insisted that the lyrics to the entry We Don't Wanna Put In should be changed as 'Put In' were seen as a clear reference to Vladimir Putin. Georgia refused, and instead withdrew from the contest.

As the country returned to the 2010 contest, it was to a 9th place which was repeated the following year - to date those results are the best the country ever did. In 2012, Georgia failed to reach the final for the first time, and that were to happen twice more in the following years.
