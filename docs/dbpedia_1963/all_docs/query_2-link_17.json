        "text": "26 May is Independence Day in Georgia. On this day in 1918, Georgia was declared the Democratic Republic of Georgia after the 1917 Russian Revolution. However, Georgia was reclaimed by the Russians in 1921 to be part of the Soviet Union. Georgia regained independence back in 1991 but suffered both economic and civil unrest until 2003.\n\nIn 2007, Georgia made their debut in the Eurovision Song Contest, and since then, have reached the Grand Final seven times. They have finished in the top 10 on two occasions, both in 9th place. The first time was in 2010 in Oslo, Norway, with Sopho Nizharadze’s ‘Shine’ and the second time was in 2011 when Eldrine performed ‘One More Day’ in Düsseldorf, Germany. Unfortunately, Georgia has not qualified for the Grand Final since 2016.\n\nThe Aussievision team has gone through all Georgian Eurovision entries and provided their top 10 rankings in the traditional 12 points down to 1 system.\n\nWith many great songs to choose from, let's take a look at our team's Top 10 Eurovision songs from Georgia.\n\n16. Tornike Kipiani - 'You' (2021) - 6 points\n\n15. The Shin and Mariko - 'Three Minutes to Earth' (2014) - 8 points\n\n=13. Diana Gurtskaya- 'Peace Will Come' (2008) - 13 points\n\n=13. Ethno-Jazz Band Iriao - 'For You' (2018) - 13 points\n\n12. Anri Jokhadze - 'I'm a Joker' (2012) - 12 points\n\n11. Oto Nemsadze - 'Keep On Going' (2019) - 34 points\n\nNow on to the top 10 as voted by the Aussievision team!\n\n10. Tornike Kipiani 'Take Me As I Am' (2020) - 37 points\n\nHighs: 12 points from Jasyn\n\n2020 was the Eurovision year that never was due to the COVID pandemic, and Georgia's entry for 2020 was Tornike Kipiani with his raw man-ballad 'Take Me As I Am'. While Tornike never got to perform this song on the big stage, he did return the following year to represent Georgia in Rotterdam.\n\n9. Nodi Tatishvili & Sophie Gelovani 'Waterfall' (2013) - 40 points\n\nHighs: 12 points from Zhi, 8 points from Liv\n\nIn 2013, Georgia sent Nodi Tatishvili and Sophie Gelovani from another internal selection with the ballad 'Waterfall'. Some serious song writing credibility here - 'Waterfall' was co-written by non other than Thomas G:son ('Euphoria' and 'Tattoo'). The also duo received the press award in the Marcel Bezençon Awards. 'Waterfall' finished 15th in the Grand Final.\n\n8. Tamara Gachechiladze 'Keep the Faith' (2017) - 43 points\n\nHighs: 12 points from Dale, 10 points from Kyriakos\n\nIn 2017, Georgia returned to a national final format and chose Tamara Gachechiladze and the epic ballad 'Keep the Faith'. Although she gave us a huge performance with that amazing voice of hers, it was a big surprise when Tamara just missed out on the Grand Final, finishing in 11th place in the semi-final.\n\n7. Eldrine 'One More Day' (2011) - 50 points\n\nHighs: 12 points from Fleur, 10 points from Laura, 8 points from Jasyn\n\nIn 2011, Georgia broke from tradition and brought us some rock/nu metal in the form of band Eldrine. Fronted by female lead singer, Sopho Toroshelidze, the song was internally chosen. 'One More Day' sailed through to the Grand Final and gave Georgia another top 10 result - finishing in 9th place and received several sets of 12 points.\n\n6. Sopho 'Visionary Dream' (2007) - 50 points\n\nHighs: 12 points from Laura, Kyriakos and Liv\n\nGeorgia certainly entered the Contest with a bang with their very first entry back in 2007. An internal selection was held after a public submission for songs opened in Georgia, and Sopho was chosen to perform 'Visionary Dream'. This song finished in a very formidable 12th spot - not bad for their first effort!\n\n5. Circus Mircus 'Lock Me In' (2022) - 51 points\n\nHighs: 8 points from Hayley and Fleur\n\nThe representatives from Georgia for 2022, Circus Mircus, gave us early teasing on social media of what we were to expect from their Eurovision act. Quirky indie rock are the best words used to describe Circus Mircus, and one member we had seen at Eurovision before - Nika Kocharov (2016). Circus Circus lived up to their quirky size during the performance but unfortunately, 'Lock Me In' didn't make it out of the second semi-final.\n\n4. Sofia Nizharadze 'Shine' (2010) - 54 points\n\nHighs: 10 points from Dale and Liv, 8 points from John Christian and Zhi\n\nIn 2010, Georgia sent Sofia Nizharadze to represent them with the ballad 'Shine'. While Sofia was an internal selection, Georgia held a small national final of six songs for Sofia to sing, and 'Shine' was chosen by the public. This was certainly the right choice, as the song landed Georgia their very first top 10, when 'Shine' finished in 9th place in the Grand Final.\n\n3. Nika Kocharov and Young Georgian Lolitaz 'Midnight Gold' (2016) - 67 points\n\nHighs: 12 points from Emma, 10 points from Fleur and Hayley, 8 points from Alana\n\nIn 2016, Georgia hosted a small national final where Nika Kocharov and Young Georgian Lolitaz was chosen to represent Georgia by the public and jury vote. 'Midnight Gold' was quite the mix of genres, including indie rock and electronic/dance (also co-written by Thomas G:son). The song finished in 20th place in the Grand Final.\n\n2. Nina Sublatti - 'Warrior' (2015) - 76 points\n\nHighs: 12 points from Alana, 10 points from Zhi and Emma\n\n2015 was the year Nina Sublatti gave us 'Warrior'. The Georgian broadcaster selected five songs for the public to choose from, and Georgia chose 'Warrior'. Luckily for Georgia, this was a great choice and this song ended up finishing just outside the top 10 in 11th place. There was a slight mishap during the Grand Final with the smoke effects losing Nina for a few moments but this obviously didn't hurt the results.\n\n1. Iru - 'Echo' 2023 (84 points)\n\nHighs: 12 points from John Christian and Hayley, 10 points from Jaysn and Alana, 8 points from Emma\n\nIn 2023, Georgia pinned their hopes on previous Junior Eurovision winner, Iru with her haunting ballad 'Echo'. Iru only just missed out on the Grand Final this year, finishing in 12th place in semi-final 2. The song was internal and written by the same songwriter that has given us multiple Georgian Junior Eurovision wins. Iru herself was chosen to represent Georgia via The Voice Georgia."
