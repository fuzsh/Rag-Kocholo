Hoffer\n\n1989-08-01\n\nFull Text Available Critics of the 1960s and 1970s have focused their attention on Klaus Mann's use of his former brother-in-law, Gustaf GrÃ¼ndgens, as the model for the hero of his controversial novel, Mephisto , while more recent critics have emphasized its significance as a work of anti-Fascist literature. This essay seeks to resolve some of the apparent contradictions in Klaus Mann's motivation for writing Mephisto by viewing the novel primarily in the context of his life and career. Although Mephisto is the only political satire that Klaus Mann wrote, it is consistent with his life-long tendency to use autobiographical material as the basis for much of his plot and characterization. Mann transformed his ambivalent feelings about GrÃ¼ndgens, which long antedated the writing of Mephisto , into a unique work of fiction which simultaneously expresses his indignation over the moral bankruptcy of the Third Reich and reveals his envy of GrÃ¼ndgens's career successes.\n\nCholera in Thomas Mann's Death in Venice.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRÃ¼tten, Thomas\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe article sets the cholera motif in Thomas Mann's famous novella Death in Venice against the historical context from which it partially originates. It is shown that this motif, while undoubtedly appropriated to serve Mann's own poetic ends, has a solid grounding in historical and autobiographical fact, thus blurring the boundaries between fact and fiction. The article illustrates the verifiable events of the outbreak of the Venetian cholera epidemic in May 1911, which Mann partly witnessed himself, during a holiday trip to Brioni and Venice, and partly heard and read about. It is established that Thomas Mann's account of the cholera in Venice in his novella is characterised by a rare and almost preternatural insightfulness into an otherwise murky affair that was marked by rumours, speculations and denials.\n\nMurray Gell-Mann and the physics of quarks\n\nCERN Document Server\n\n2018-01-01\n\nMurray Gell-Mann, Physics Nobel Prize Laureate in 1969 is known for his theoretical work on elementary particle physics and the introduction of quarks and together with H. Fritzsch the âQuantum Chromodynamicsâ. Based on four sections the Editor gives an overview on the work of Gell-Mann and his contributions to various aspects of the physics, related to quarks. His most important and influential papers were selected and reprinted so that the reader easily can check the original work of Gell-Mann.\n\nOn the Symbolism of Thomas Mann\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nVasily M. Tolmatchoff\n\n2017-09-01\n\nFull Text Available The essay discusses Thomas Mannâs symbolism and its parameters as well as Mannâs interpretation of the crisis of European spiritual values. Ð¢he author examines the role of Nietzsche in Mannâs heritage as well as interconnections between Mann and Wilde, Mann and Gide. Buddenbrooks is interpreted as a novel about the end of the German Renaissance; duality of the modern artist is shown on the example of âTonio KrÃ¶gerâ while the paradoxes of his eroticism are analyzed on the example of âDer Tod in Venedig.â\n\nAn Interview with Joe McMann: His Life Lessons\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMcMann, Joe\n\n2011-01-01\n\nPica Kahn conducted \"An Interview with Joe McMann: His Life Lessons\" on May 23, 2011. With over 40 years of experience in the aerospace industry, McMann has gained a wealth of knowledge. Many have been interested in his biography, progression of work at NASA, impact on the U.S. spacesuit, and career accomplishments. This interview highlighted the influences and decision-making methods that impacted his technical and management contributions to the space program. McMann shared information about the accomplishments and technical advances that committed individuals can make.\n\n[A summer afternoon in Grinzing. Thomas Mann visits Sigmund Freud].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHummel, Gerhard\n\n2006-01-01\n\nFocussing on June 14th, 1936 when Mann visited Freud to read him the speech he had delivered in Vienna in celebration of Freud's 80th birthday, the paper investigates the \"less than simple\" relation between the two men. It shows how they gradually approached each other and then in 1929 entered into direct contact after Mann had publicly underlined Freud's relevance for his project \"psychology and myth\". Some traces of personal ambivalence contained in the 1936 lecture are highlighted. The author discusses the potential significance for both men of Freud's response to Mann's speech where he interpreted aspects of Napoleon's life as based on his identification with the biblical Joseph in order to surpass his elder brother. Finally it is considered whether Mann's contact with Freud may have helped him to cope with the trauma of the early loss of his father.\n\nMurray Gell-Mann, the Eightfold Way, Quarks, and Quantum Chromodynamics\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n.

Why? The aim of this article is precisely to reveal the different reasons for such an attitude. Indeed, Plutarch speaks highly of conjugal love in his Eroticus and this way is not followed by Mann in Death in Venice but, at the same, the German writer finds in this Pluta...\n\nAnother proof of Gell-Mann and Low's theorem\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nMolinari, Luca Guido\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe theorem by Gell-Mann and Low is a cornerstone in QFT and zero-temperature many-body theory. The standard proof is based on Dyson's time-ordered expansion of the propagator; a proof based on exact identities for the time-propagator is here given.\n\nA Tribute to Manne Siegbahn\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKubbinga, Henk\n\n2017-11-01\n\nSpectroscopy came to dominate the 19th century, with a crucial role for Swedish physicists. It was Anders Ã ngstrÃ¶m who introduced the tenmillionth part of a millimeter as the wavelength unit (1868), a unit that was adopted by Rowland for his tables of the solar spectral lines (1887-1893). Janne Rydberg, then, followed in Ã ngstrÃ¶m's footsteps in searching for relations between the emission spectra of the elements and their place in the Periodic Table. RÃ¶ntgen's new rays became a next challenge, demanding a form of spectroscopy of their own. Manne Siegbahn, an assistant of Rydberg, then, devised appropriate instruments of ever increasing precision.\n\nAnother proof of Gell-Mann and Low's theorem\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMolinari, Luca Guido\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe theorem by Gell-Mann and Low is a cornerstone in quantum field theory and zero-temperature many-body theory.

However, the energy balance by using this systematics is still a task to be studied. In the form of Legendre polynomial expansion the energy balance has been proved analytically. In terms of this approach, the formula to determine the pre-equilibrium fraction r factor of Kalbach-Mann systematics has been obtained for keeping energy balance strictly. This formula could be straightforwardly applied for describing the double-differential cross sections of all projectile types in the continuum spectrum emissions. It indicates that Legendre expansion coefficient with l = 1 is the key term in the energy balance\n\nManne/mange - to sider af samme sag\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nJensen, Anette\n\n2009-01-01\n\nAt pronominet og adjektivet mange udtales forskelligt i danske dialekter er vist ikke ukendt for de fleste danske dialektologer.

Mann. Interview by Molly Joel Coye.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMann, Alfred E\n\n2006-01-01\n\nIn this wide-ranging interview, Alfred Mann describes the activities of several medical technology enterprises with which he is engaged. Several of them are companies that he formed; one is a nonprofit foundation, the Alfred E. Mann Foundation for Biomedical Engineering, founded to establish research-oriented institutes on a dozen university campuses and support their work in developing marketable innovations. Mann discusses the need to consider the cost implications of technology, in the context of U.S. health system reform, and describes several important innovations that have emerged from his companies over the years.\n\nAn Interview with Joe McMann: Lessons Learned from Fifty Years of Observing Hardware and Human Behavior\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMcMann, Joe\n\n2011-01-01\n\nPica Kahn conducted \"An Interview with Joe McMann: Lessons Learned in Human and Hardware Behavior\" on August 16, 2011. With more than 40 years of experience in the aerospace industry, McMann has gained a wealth of knowledge. This presentation focused on lessons learned in human and hardware behavior. During his many years in the industry, McMann observed that the hardware development process was intertwined with human influences, which impacted the outcome of the product.\n\nThomas Mann's \"Tobias Mindernickel\" in Light of Sartre's \"Being-for-Others\"\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBeth Bjorklund\n\n1978-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Sartre's analysis of \"Being-for-Others\" in Being and Nothingness describes the Self-Other relationship as essentially one of conflict, with the Self attempting either to dominate or to be dominated by the Other. Subject-Object relations are a common theme also in the early works of Thomas Mann, who gives artistic expression to many of the same problems which Sartre later formalized in a philosophical theory. The sado-masochistic character, which is portrayed in several of Thomas Mann's narratives, receives its strongest expression in the story \"Tobias Mindernickel,\" which is here singled out for analysis. Humiliation gives rise to aggression, as the protagonist feels both an attraction and a repulsion for his surrogate lover, a dog. The interpersonal relationships revealed here serve as paradigmatic illustration of Sartre's theory of \"Concrete Relations with Others.\"\n\nMannDB â A microbial database of automated protein sequence analyses and evidence integration for protein characterization\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKuczmarski Thomas A\n\n2006-10-01\n\nFull Text Available Abstract Background MannDB was created to meet a need for rapid, comprehensive automated protein sequence analyses to support selection of proteins suitable as targets for driving the development of reagents for pathogen or protein toxin detection. Because a large number of open-source tools were needed, it was necessary to produce a software system to scale the computations for whole-proteome analysis. Thus, we built a fully automated system for executing software tools and for storage, integration, and display of automated protein sequence analysis and annotation data. Description MannDB is a relational database that organizes data resulting from fully automated, high-throughput protein-sequence analyses using open-source tools. Types of analyses provided include predictions of cleavage, chemical properties, classification, features, functional assignment, post-translational modifications, motifs, antigenicity, and secondary structure. Proteomes (lists of hypothetical and known proteins are downloaded and parsed from Genbank and then inserted into MannDB, and annotations from SwissProt are downloaded when identifiers are found in the Genbank entry or when identical sequences are identified. Currently 36 open-source tools are run against MannDB protein sequences either on local systems or by means of batch submission to external servers. In addition, BLAST against protein entries in MvirDB, our database of microbial virulence factors, is performed. A web client browser enables viewing of computational results and downloaded annotations, and a query tool enables structured and free-text search capabilities. When available, links to external databases, including MvirDB, are provided. MannDB contains whole-proteome analyses for at least one representative organism from each category of biological threat organism listed by APHIS, CDC, HHS, NIAID, USDA, USFDA, and WHO. Conclusion MannDB comprises a large number of genomes and comprehensive protein\n\nOn the error estimation and T-stability of the Mann iteration\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nMaruster, Laura; Maruster, St.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nA formula of error estimation of Mann iteration is given in the case of strongly demicontractive mappings.

Fortunately, there are statistical tests to compare two independent groups that do not require large normally distributed samples. The Mann-Whitney U is one of these tests. In the following work, a summary of this test is presented. The explanation of the logic underlying this test and its application are presented. Moreover, the forces and weaknesses of the Mann-Whitney U are mentioned. One major limit of the Mann-Whitney U is that the type I error or alpha (? is amplified in a situation of heteroscedasticity.\n\nPartielle endokrine VerÃ¤nderungen des alternden Mannes (PEVAM: Facts and Fiction\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPonholzer A\n\n2000-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Die kontinuierliche Abnahme der Sexualhormone Testosteron und Dehydroepiandrosteronsulfat (DHEA-S in Verbindung mit dem Altern des Mannes steht heutzutage auÃer Zweifel [1, 2]. Die beim Mann zu beobachtenden Ãnderungen im Hormonhaushalt unterscheiden sich von denen der Frau durch den langsamen, stetigen Verlauf und die oftmalige Erhaltung der FertilitÃ¤t bis ins hÃ¶chste Alter. Es ist daher falsch, von einem \"Klimakterium virile\" oder von \"Andropause\" zu sprechen. Das AusmaÃ der Abnahme der Androgenspiegel unterliegt, ebenso wie das Bestehen einer assoziierten Symptomatik, einer hohen interindividuellen Streuung. Unter dem Begriff PADAM (partielles Androgendefizit des alternden Mannes werden als Auswirkung verminderter Androgenspiegel vielfÃ¤ltige Symptome beschrieben, wie zum Beispiel Hitzewallungen, SchlafstÃ¶rungen, EinschrÃ¤nkungen des Wohlbefindens und der SexualitÃ¤t sowie Abnahme von Knochendichte und Muskelmasse oder VerÃ¤nderung von Fettverteilungsmuster und GesamtkÃ¶rperfettanteil. Bei Vorliegen von einem oder mehreren der oben genannten Symptome in Verbindung mit entsprechend verminderten Testosteronspiegeln existiert die MÃ¶glichkeit einer Substitutionstherapie, sowohl zur PrÃ¤vention, als auch zur Therapie negativer Auswirkungen des Mangels. Potentielle Risiken einer Androgentherapie scheinen kontrollierbar, werden aber erst in Zukunft durch umfassende Langzeitstudien in ihrem ganzen AusmaÃ beurteilbar sein. Andere Hormonsysteme, wie etwa Wachstumshormone (GH oder Melatonin unterliegen ebenfalls einer altersassozierten Abnahme. Auch hier darf eine Auswirkung auf die LebensqualitÃ¤t angenommen werden, die Sinnhaftigkeit einer Ersatztherapie ist bei GH und Melatonin, wie auch bei DHEA-S, jedoch umstritten.\n\nAccelerating medical innovation at USC: realizing the dream of Alfred E. Mann.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGosset, Nathalie; Lasch, Jonathan G\n\n2012-07-01\n\nAlfred E. Mann's vision is to create organizations that will help medical innovations born in academic environments evolve into commercially fit solutions, without the risk of being abandoned under the financial pressures early stage start-ups often experience. In 1998, Mann worked with Stephen Sample, president of USC, to create the first AMI for Biomedical Engineering, an organization fueled by an endowment valued at approximately US$160 million today. Technology-acceleration centers come in different flavors. AMI USC's recipe has evolved since its creation, with edits that incorporate lessons learned and improvements brought by its expanding network of talented resource people. Its 15-member staff, consisting of three-fourths industry professionals, includes seasoned generalists and specialists in medical technology commercialization. Although the support varies with each invention, some recurring ingredients weave into the AMI approach to accelerating medical innovation.\n\nDevelopment of the Crohn's disease digestive damage score, the LÃ©mann score\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nPariente, Benjamin; Cosnes, Jacques; Danese, Silvio\n\n2011-01-01\n\nis to outline the methods to develop an instrument that can measure cumulative bowel damage.

From an approach inspired by the sociology of knowledge from Mannheim and the historical emphasis on the individuality from Burckhardt, I will work in three dimensions: first, the paths of both intellectual and moments where they intersect, and secondly, the inspiration that messianism LukÃ¡cs gave for the construction of the controversial character Leo Naphta's novel âThe Magic Mountainâ, Mann; thirdly, about how the fictional work this was interpreted by the Hungarian literary criticism.\n\n\"German Culture is where I am\": Thomas Mann in Exile\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHelmut Koopmann\n\n1982-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Thomas Mann in exile reacted like many writers expelled from Germany: totally irritated he tried to defend his own identity by claiming that he was still the leading representative of Germany. But about 1938 a process of dissociation from Germany started which led to sharp remarks on Germany in his The Beloved Returns , to his conviction that German culture was where he lived and to the acknowledgement of America as his new home. Traces of his experience of exile, and a late answer on his separation from Germany in 1933, however, are to be found even in his incompleted novel Felix Krull which seems to have turned the disgusting experience of exile into friendly mythological light.\n\nFor whom the bells toll: a polyphonic fragment in Thomas Mann's 'Der ErwÃ¤hlte'\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nLichtenstein, S.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nAlthough many studies have been devoted to the role of music in the works of Thomas Mann, very little attention has been paid to this aspect in his novel Der ErwÃ¤hlte.

Modified Mann-Kendall, Spearman's rho tests and Sen's slope estimators were applied to find the long-term annual, dry season and monthly trends. Sequential Mann-Kendall analysis was applied to detect the potential trend turning points. Spatial variations of the trends were examined using inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation. AutoRegressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was used for the country mean rainfall and for other two stations data which depicted the highest and the lowest trend in the Mann-Kendall and Spearman's rho tests. Results showed that there is no significant trend in annual rainfall pattern except increasing trends for Cox's Bazar, Khulna, Satkhira and decreasing trend for Srimagal areas. For the dry season, only Bogra area represented significant decreasing trend. Long-term monthly trends demonstrated a mixed pattern; both negative and positive changes were found from February to September. Comilla area showed a significant decreasing trend for consecutive 3 months while Rangpur and Khulna stations confirmed the significant rising trends for three different months in month-wise trends analysis. Rangpur station data gave a maximum increasing trend in April whereas a maximum decreasing trend was found in August for Comilla station. ARIMA models predict +3.26, +8.6 and -2.30 mm rainfall per year for the country, Cox's Bazar and Srimangal areas, respectively. However, all the test results and predictions revealed a good agreement among them in the study.\n\nLivets febrile hemmeligheder.

These reconstructions of a historical theme intermix with contributions about current public affairs, and have as their object the events linked to Germanyâs entering the war and the general favour with which this was received. Moreover, warlike metaphors tend to slip comfortably into the profound core of Mannâs writing, since they lend themselves rather effectively to descriptions of the artistâs actual aptitudes and duties.\n\nVisit of the ATLAS cavern by Prof. Murray Gell-Mann, Physics Nobel 1969.

The Mann-Kendall (MK) test along with modified Mann-Kendall (m-MK) test, which can discriminate multi-scale variability of unidirectional trend, was used to analyze the changes at 31 stations. Taking account of the scaling effect through eliminating the effect of autocorrelation, m-MK was employed to discriminate multi-scale variability of the unidirectional trends of the annual rainfall in Sarawak. It can confirm the significance of the MK test. The annual rainfall trend from MK test showed significant changes at 95% confidence level at five stations. The seasonal trends from MK test indicate an increasing rate of rainfall during the Northeast monsoon and a decreasing trend during the Southwest monsoon in some region of Sarawak. However, the m-MK test detected an increasing trend in annual rainfall only at one station and no significant trend in seasonal rainfall at any stations. The significant increasing trends of the 1-h maximum rainfall from the MK test are detected mainly at the stations located in the urban area giving concern to the occurrence of the flash flood. On the other hand, the m-MK test detected no significant trend in 1- and 3-h maximum rainfalls at any location. On the contrary, it detected significant trends in 6- and 72-h maximum rainfalls at a station located in the Lower Rajang basin area which is an extensive low-lying agricultural area and prone to stagnant flood. These results indicate that the trends in rainfall and rainfall extremes reported in Malaysia and surrounding region should be verified with m-MK test as most of the trends may result from scaling effect.\n\nClinical Experience Using the Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability for Identification of Patients at Risk for Aspiration in a Mixed-Disease Population\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGonzalez-Fernandez, Marlis; Sein, Michael T.; Palmer, Jeffrey B.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nPurpose: To determine the clinical performance characteristics of the Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability (MASA) for predicting aspiration (determined by videofluoroscopic swallowing study [VFSS]) in a mixed population.

Contemporary studies have revealed that the Earthâs surface air temperature has augmented by 0.6Â°C â 0.8Â°C in the course of the 20th century, together with alterations in the hydrological cycle. This study focuses on detecting trends in seasonal temperature for the five selected stations in the Upper Indus Basin. The Mann-Kendall test was run at 5% significance level on time series data for each of the five stations during the time period, 1985 to 2014. The Standard Test Statistic (Zs indicates the presence of trend and whether it is increasing or decreasing. The analysis showed an increasing trend in mean monthly temperature at Astore, Gilgit and Gupiz in March and a decreasing trend for Astore, Drosh, Gilgit and Skardu in September. Gilgit and Gupiz showed unexpected increasing trend in October. This study concludes that the temperature starts increasing in March and stays elevated till the month of June and starts rising again in October thus resulting in expansion of summer season and prolonged glacial melting.\n\nLa Ã©tica mÃ©dica a comienzos del siglo XX: \"La MontaÃ±a MÃ¡gica\" de Thomas Mann A Ã©tica mÃ©dica no comeÃ§o do sÃ©culo XX: \"A Montanha MÃ¡gica\" de Thomas Mann Medical ethics in the beginning of twentieth century: \"The Magic Mountain\" of Thomas Mann\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nGustavo Figueroa\n\n2011-11-01\n\nFull Text Available La bioÃ©tica ha transformado la Ã©tica mÃ©dica de manera profunda, apelando a otros principios y prÃ¡cticas.

Three river cross station: Lubuk Paku, Sg. Yap and Temerloh were selected as area of this study. The stream flow and water level data were gathered from DID record. Data set for this study were analysed by using non-parametric analysis, Mann-Kendall Trend Test. The results that obtained from stream flow and water level analysis indicate that there are positively significant trend for Lubuk Paku (0.001) and Sg. Yap (<0.0001) from 1972-2011 with the p-value < 0.05. Temerloh (0.178) data from 1963-2011 recorded no trend for stream flow parameter but negative trend for water level parameter. Hydrological pattern and trend are extremely affected by outside factors such as north east monsoon season that occurred in South China Sea and affected Pahang during November to March. There are other factors such as development and management of the areas which can be considered as factors affected the data and results. Hydrological Pattern is important to indicate the river trend such as stream flow and water level. It can be used as flood mitigation by local authorities.

The comparisons are made using certain probabilistic indices (PI. The PIs computed here tell how often pairs or triples of observations coming from different groups appear in a specific order of magnitude. Classical two and several sample rank test statistics such as the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon, Kruskal-Wallis, or Jonckheere-Terpstra test statistics are simple functions of these PI. Also new test statistics for directional alternatives are provided. The package gMWT can be used to calculate the variable-wise PI estimates, to illustrate their multivariate distribution and mutual dependence with joint scatterplot matrices, and to construct several classical and new rank tests based on the PIs. The aim of the paper is first to briefly explain the theory that is necessary to understand the behavior of the estimated PIs and the rank tests based on them. Second, the use of the package is described and illustrated with simulated and real data examples. It is stressed that the package provides a new flexible toolbox to analyze large gene or microRNA expression data sets, collected on microarrays or by other high-throughput technologies. The testing procedures can be used in an eQTL analysis, for example, as implemented in the package GeneticTools.\n\nEheherrschaft des Mannes und Widerstand der Frau.

In this study, a newspaper-based flood database for Shanghai (NFDS for the period 1949â2009 was developed through a systematic scanning of newspapers. After calibration and validation of the database, Mann-Kendall tests and correlation analysis were applied to detect possible changes in flood frequencies. The analysis was carried out for three different flood types: overbank flood, agricultural waterlogging, and urban waterlogging. The compiled NFDS registered 146 floods and 92% of them occurred in the flood-prone season from June to September. The statistical analyses showed that both the annual flood and the floods in JuneâAugust increased significantly. Urban waterlogging showed a very strong increasing trend, probably because of insufficient capacity of urban drainage system and impacts of rapid urbanization. By contrast, the decrease in overbank flooding and the slight increase in agricultural waterlogging were likely because of the construction of river levees and seawalls and the upgrade of agricultural drainage systems, respectively. This study demonstrated the usefulness of local newspapers in building a historical flood database and in assessing flood characterization.\n\nDas leere Zentrum demokratischer SouverÃ¤nitÃ¤t am Beispiel der Globalisierung des Himmels seit 1783 - Mit einer Darstellung der medienkritischen und medienerzieherischen Perspektive des 'kleinen Mannes' anhand von Jean Pauls Giannozzo\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nChristian Zolles\n\n2016-12-01\n\nFull Text Available In seinem Beitrag zeichnet Christian Zolles die 'Globalisierung des Himmels seit 1783' nach und versucht anhand der Entwicklungen in der Luftfahrt die Konzepte 'Macht', 'SouverÃ¤nitÃ¤t' und 'Herrschaft' zu umreiÃen. So zeigen die frÃ¼hen BallonflÃ¼ge die Grenzen absolutistischer ReprÃ¤sentationsmacht auf und spiegeln sowohl das neue erhabene Raumbewusstsein als auch den revolutionÃ¤ren Freiheitsdrang des BÃ¼rgertums. Gleichzeitig mit dem demokratischen Perspektivenwechsel setzt sich die politische Imagination eines charismatischen 'groÃen Mannes' durch, der die Vielfalt und WidersprÃ¼chlichkeit der BevÃ¶lkerungsmenge aufheben und volkssouverÃ¤ne Tatkraft verkÃ¶rpern kann.

Thus, a method of evaluating eating and swallowing functions that can be used to diagnose and manage dysphagia in a simple and robust manner is required. In 2002, the Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability (MASA) was introduced to identify dysphagia in acute-stage stroke patients. As the MASA enables easy screening, it might also be applicable to dependent older adults if appropriate MASA cut-off values and the most useful assessment items could be determined. In the present study, we attempted to determine suitable MASA cut-off values, and the most useful assessment items for predicting aspiration and pharyngeal retention in dependent older adults. Using the MASA, we evaluated the eating and swallowing functions of 50 dependent older adults with dysphagia. All of the patients also underwent videoendoscopic-based swallowing evaluations to detect aspiration and pharyngeal retention. The participants' characteristics and the utility of each assessment item were compared between various groups. Using the patients' videoendoscopic findings as a reference, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was carried out to determine appropriate cut-off values for predicting aspiration and pharyngeal retention in dependent older adults. The optimal MASA cut-off values for predicting aspiration and pharyngeal retention were 122 points and 151 points, respectively. A total of 17 of the 24 clinical items assessed by the MASA were found to be associated with aspiration in dependent older adults. The MASA is a useful screening tool for evaluating eating and swallowing functions in dependent older adults. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2017; 17: 561-567.

The American College of Radiology's breast imaging-reporting and data system (BI-RADS{sup TM}) is intended to standardize terminology in the mammography report, the assessment of the findings, and the recommendation af action to be taken. The purpose of this study was to assess the value of the standardized system for clinically apparent male breast tumors. Do the special male anatomy and physiology limit the applicability of an evaluation system designed for female screening mammograms? Methods: 4 investigators with different degrees of experience retrospectively evaluated 160 male mammograms. Our study was based on the 36 cases which could be correlated to histopathological findings: gynecomastia in the majority of cases, but also 4 invasive ductal carcinoma, 1 leiomyosarcoma and 1 ductal carcinoma in situ. Results: Assessment of the mammograms by BI-RADS{sup TM} (3{sup rd} Edition 1998) correctly placed all cases of malignancy into categories 4 and 5 without respect to the investigators's level of experience. Conclusion: Therefore, we conclude that the BI-RADS{sup TM}-classification can successfully be used to classify male mammograms with a high positive predictive value for malignancy. Knowledge of gender-specific imaging characteristics increases the specificity at a constant high level of sensitivity. (orig.)

The 100-year peak discharge at each tributary was determined from regional frequency equations. The 100-year discharge at Wolf Creek, Craig Branch, Manns Creek, Dunloup Creek, and Mill Creek was 3,400 cubic feet per second, 640 cubic feet per second, 8,200 cubic feet per second, 7,100 cubic feet per second, and 9,400 cubic feet per second, respectively. Flood elevations for each tributary were determined by application of a steady-state, one-dimensional flow model. Manning's roughness coefficients for the stream channels ranged from 0.040 to 0.100.

Altern ist mit einem kontinuierlichen Abfall der kÃ¶rperlichen Fitness und der ErektionsfÃ¤higkeit verbunden. Die Risikofaktoren fÃ¼r ErektionsstÃ¶rungen, wie z. B. Ãbergewicht, sind sehr Ã¤hnlich jenen von Herz-Kreislauf-Erkrankungen. Mehrere Studien konnten eine positive Korrelation von kÃ¶rperlicher AktivitÃ¤t und ErektionsfÃ¤higkeit nachweisen. RegelmÃ¤Ãige Bewegung fÃ¼hrt zu einer Gewichtsreduktion und zu einem Stressabbau. Die mit dem AlterungsprozeÃ assoziierten Hormone stehen untereinander als auch mit dem kÃ¶rperlichen Fitnesszustand in Zusammenhang. Ausdauertraining erhÃ¶ht den Testosteronspiegel stÃ¤rker als Krafttraining, zu hohe Belastungen fÃ¼hren zu einem Abfall desselben, v.a. in der Erholungsphase, und es besteht eine positive Korrelation von kÃ¶rperlicher AktivitÃ¤t mit Testosteron und mit Wachstumshormon.

A. Antsifirov\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The article raises an issue to enhance technological forging capabilities on the known knuckle joint presses. It provides an illustrated overview of main design types of presses with crank-knuckle, toggle-knuckle, and knuckle joint mechanisms. The article also shows the advantages of the modernization way and improvement just of the active press equipment in terms of quality-to-price ratio, for example, as compared to the similar new foreign press equipment.It gives an overview of features, which provide forging processes owing to kinetic energy accumulated with the moving parts of the known designs of the knuckle joint presses depending on the drive actuating mechanism. Focused attention is drawn to forging on the knuckle joint presses for a time of contact with a work piece to be comparable with the duration of the work piece deformation process on hydraulic forging hammers. This allows us to forge thin-wall products with process automation compared to the forging hammers.Analysis of accumulating processes of kinetic energy by the moving parts of the knuckle joint presses has shown that presses driven by hydraulic cylinders or two screw hydraulic cylinder are the most optimal for technological operations as evidenced by references to domestic and foreign invention certificates and patents. The article presents disadvantages of forging on presses with hydraulic or pneumatic drive. It is a dependence of the deformation force, caused, mainly, by a force of the drive cylinder. The article gives linear movement rate quantities of press moving members depending on the drives of the actuating mechanism. Based on the above analysis of the features to manufacture work pieces on the knuckle joint presses, the article gives the rationale for the relevance of forging in a short period of time, provided that the moving parts of the press accumulate the required kinetic energy. This can be achieved only through modernization and improvement of forging equipment designs, in particular, using modern industrial hydraulics facilities, software and hardware systems for industrial automation.\n\nIt might become light.

While spatial patterns and distributions gained much attention in recent years the temporal trends in stable isotope time series are rarely investigated and our understanding of them is still limited. These might be a result of a lack of proper trend detection tools and effort for exploring trend processes. Here we make use of an extensive data set of stable isotope in German precipitation. In this study we investigate temporal trends of Î´18O in precipitation at 17 observation station in Germany between 1978 and 2009. For that we test different approaches for proper trend detection, accounting for first and higher order serial correlation. We test if significant trends in the isotope time series based on different models can be observed. We apply the Mann-Kendall trend tests on the isotope series, using general multiplicative seasonal autoregressive integrate moving average (ARIMA) models which account for first and higher order serial correlations. With the approach we can also account for the effects of temperature, precipitation amount on the trend. Further we investigate the role of geographic parameters on isotope trends. To benchmark our proposed approach, the ARIMA results are compared to a trend-free prewhiting (TFPW) procedure, the state of the art method for removing the first order autocorrelation in environmental trend studies. Moreover, we explore whether higher order serial correlations in isotope series affects our trend results. The results show that three out of the 17 stations have significant changes when higher order autocorrelation are adjusted, and four stations show a significant trend when temperature and precipitation effects are considered. Significant trends in the isotope time series are generally observed at low elevation stations (â¤315 m a\n\nGeneralized Mann Iterations for Approximating Fixed Points of a Family of Hemicontractions\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJin Liang\n\n2008-06-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper concerns common fixed points for a finite family of hemicontractions or a finite family of strict pseudocontractions on uniformly convex Banach spaces. By introducing a new iteration process with error term, we obtain sufficient and necessary conditions, as well as sufficient conditions, for the existence of a fixed point. As one will see, we derive these strong convergence theorems in uniformly convex Banach spaces and without any requirement of the compactness on the domain of the mapping. The results given in this paper extend some previous theorems.\n\nBookshelf (Neutrino Interactions with Electrons and Protons - Edited by Alfred K. Mann)\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLuigi Di Lella\n\n1994-01-01\n\nSubtitled 'an account of an Experimental Program in Particle Physics in the 1980s', this book is a collection of 13 reprinted papers presenting experimental results from experiment E-734 originally proposed in 1978 to measure the elastic scattering of neutrinos and antineutrinos from electrons and protons using the neutrino beam at the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. This experiment took data during the 1980s and the apparatus was dismantled in 1990. Its main results cover measurements of the weak mixing angle, and some measurements which were not in the original proposal, such as limits on the electromagnetic properties of the muon neutrino and on the mixing between electron- and muon-neutri-nos. The collaboration, with 35 physicists participating, included Osaka and KEK and was the earliest formal collaboration in high energy physics between American and Japanese institutions. This book gives only a very partial account of neutrino physics in the 1980s. Because of the relatively low neutrino energy of only few GeV, E- 734 physics did not include the study of deep inelastic scattering which has greatly contributed to the understanding of the nucleon structure in terms of quarks, antiquarks and gluons. Furthermore, because of the low event rate at the low neutrino energy, most of the E-734 results have been superseded by the more precise results obtained by higher energy neutrino experiments at CERN and Fermilab, however with the exceptions of the limits on neutrino mixing and of the measurement of the neutral current cross-section for neutrino and antineutrino elastic scattering. It is not clear to me why the American Institute of Physics has chosen to publish this book in a series 'Key Papers in Physics'.\n\nDoes Injection of Lidocaine with 1/100000 Epinephrine Immediately before Lateral Osteotomy Reduce Post-Operative Periorbital Edema and Ecchymosis in Rhinoplasty?\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nmansoor zojajy\n\n2014-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Background: Postoperative periorbital edema and ecchymosis are common after rhinoplasty. We studied the effect of local injection of Lidocaine/Adrenaline immediately before osteotomy on prevention of post-operative periorbital edema and ecchymosis in rhinoplasty.Materials and Methods: Thirty healthy candidates for rhinoplasty were enrolled in the self-controlled clinical trial study. Lidocaine/Adrenaline solution injected randomly to one side just prior to the lateral osteotomy. The opposite side used as a control. The degree of edema/ecchymosis on both sides was compared on the 1st, 2nd and 7th day postoperatively.Results: Mean of severity of edema, 24 hours after operation was 3in both sides, (Mann-whitney U; p=0.829. Mean of severity of edema, 48 hours after operation was 2 in both sides (Mann-whitney U; p=0.867 and it was 1 in both sides 7 days after operation (Mann-whitney U; p=0.756.There was no significant difference between two sides.

Vor allem aktualisiert man den substanziellen Inhalt der kÃ¼nstlerichen Gottesform, deren Wurzeln in der primitiven archaischen Ikonographie der Babylonier und der Ãgypter liegen. Das Bild Gottes verwandelt sich in der Situation der Begegnung aus der Substanz des unfÃ¶rmigen Steines, die pfallische Intentionen des Helden akzentuiert, in die symbiotische Form eines Menschentieres (oder Gottes-Tieres, das als Fremde Gott auf der Ebene der ErzÃ¤hlung funktioniert und den Numenaspekt durch die kÃ¼nstliche Form der animalischen Gottheit in sich trÃ¤gt. Durch die Maske des Tieres strebt der gÃ¶ttliche Begegnungspartner, der das Werden Gottes aktualisiert, nach der Verwandlung in die Gestalt eines sterbenden und wieder auferstehenden Menschen-Gottes, der den sÃ¼ndigen Menschen erlÃ¶sen kann. In der Tetralogie von Thomas Mann existiert diese Ebene des Nochnicht-gewordenen-Gottes als utopische Stufe der vollkommenen Beziehungen zwischen Mensch und Gott. Die Begegnung zwischen dem tierischen Gott und dem Helden geschieht im Roman in der TraumsphÃ¤re, die den Dialog zwischen dem Kunstding und dem Menschen mÃ¶glich macht. Auf der Traumebene wird der Prozess der Metamorphose einer Gottheit dargestellt, aber sie erscheint als ein schon verwandeltes Wesen, das die Antropomorphie des ErlÃ¶sungsprinzips aufnimmt, und dem Helden erst im bewussten Zustand begegnet.\n\nExact Gell-Mann-Low function of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories from instanton calculus\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nNovikov, V.A.; Shifman, M.A.; Vainshtein, A.I.; Zakharov, V.I.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nThe instanton contribution to the vacuum energy in supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories is considered.

Unlike most Pacific archipelagos, these evolutionary radiations extend to social insects, including ants. One of the most dramatic examples of ant radiation in Fiji has occurred in the hyperdiverse genus Pheidole. Most of the 17 native Fijian Pheidole belong to one of two species groups that descended from a single colonization, yet have evolved dramatically contrasting morphologies: the spinescent P. roosevelti species group, and the more morphologically conservative P. knowlesi species group. Here we revise the knowlesi group, in light of recent phylogenetic results, and enhanced with modern methods of X-ray microtomography. We recognize six species belonging to this group, including two of which we describe as new: Pheidole caldwelli Mann, Pheidole kava sp. n., Pheidole knowlesi Mann, P. ululevu sp. n., P. vatu Mann, and P. wilsoni Mann.

Additionally, doctors from the outpatient service showed more deterioration in the social support and quality of leadership dimensions than those from the emergency service (Mann-Whitney U Prob<0.05. As for the psychological demands dimension, doctors from higher socioeconomic strata showed higher unfavorable scores than those from lower strata (Mann-Whitney U Prob<0.05.\n\nPERBANDINGAN KINERJA KEUANGAN PEMERINTAH KABUPATEN/KOTA DI PROVINSI JAWA BARAT TAHUN 2009-2013\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJatnika Dwi Asri\n\n2016-08-01\n\nFull Text Available Abstract. This study aims to analyze the comparison of financial performance as well as analyze whether there are differences in financial performance between districts/cities in West Java Province during 2009-2013. The research used the descriptive method with quantitative data analysis technique of financial ratios as well as T test and Mann-Whitney test. The results showed that city government has a higher level of independence ratio than the district. The district effectiveness ratio is very effective with an average of 120.06%. T and Mann-Whitney test results showed no difference between effectiveness ratio, while independence ratio showed the difference.

The solution of the Gell-Mann-Low equation is presented in a convenient form. The interrelation between the Nishijima-Tomozawa equation and the Gell-Mann-Low equation is clarified. The reciprocal effective charge, so to speak, turns out to play an important role to discuss renormalization group equations. Arguments are given that the reciprocal effective charge vanishes as the renormalization momentum tends to infinity.

Both species belong to the L. biconstricta species-group (formally diagnosed here. The metatibial gland, considered a synapomorphy for Dorylinae, is observed in L. prometea sp. nov. but seems absent in L. copalinga sp. nov. We provide a COI DNA barcode for both species and a revised key for the worker caste of all known species in the genus. We also describe a single male identified as a potential new Leptanilloides species on the basis of morphology. Furthermore, its mitochondrial COI gene sequence does not match any previously barcoded species. However, we refrain from giving it a specific name because of our lack of knowledge about the worker caste. So far, half of the 14 Leptanilloides species have been discovered above 1500 m in the mountain forests or pÃ¡ramos of the Ecuadorian Andes, confirming, if needed, the biological significance of these threatened habitats.\n\nTrends in Mean Annual Streamflows in Serra da Mantiqueira Environmental Protection Area\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nMateus Ricardo Nogueira Vilanova\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to detect trends in the mean annual streamflow in watersheds of Serra da Mantiqueira Environmental Protection Area, an important Brazilian conservation area located between Minas Gerais, SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro States. Historical series of four selected streamgage stations were analyzed for the periods of 1980-1998 and 1980-2009, using the Mann-Kendall and Regional Mann-Kendall tests. The results showed that the mean annual streamflows of Serra da Mantiqueira En...\n\nThe Preface. Reflections of a unpolitical man\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTomasz Mann\n\n2015-12-01\n\nFull Text Available âThe Prefaceâ was finished after the work on âReflections of a unpolitical Manâ and explains the reasons behind its creation. Thomas Mann decided that armed conflict between Germany and the West was the result of different perspectives. Democracy damages the world order and German values. The greatest advocate of democracy among Germans is the civilizationâs man of letters. Mann undermines the value of his art and gives reasons for the disagreements with this revolutio-nary knowledge, which he calls âThe new Pathosâ. He develops the theory of the greatness of Germans as a nonpolitical nationality, recognizing Martin Luther as a reflection of this theory. He mentions the great minds of the 18th and 19th centuries to emphasize the most crucial differen- ces, seeing in himself a child of the 19th century. In conclusion, Mann claims that his opposition to democracy hastens its victory.\n\nãæ±ãå¶åãã¤ãããªããã : ããªãã·ã¥ã®æç·¨ãã¹ãã¼ãªã¼ãã«é¢ããæ åã®çæ å­¦çèå¯\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nä¸­æ, éå­; NAKAMURA, Yasuko\n\n2012-01-01\n\nMax Frischs kurze Geschichte âStoryâ, enthalten im Tagebuch 1946â1949 (1950), erzÃ¤hlt von dem fortwÃ¤hrenden Warten einer Frau auf ihren Mann, der als Soldat wÃ¤hrend des ersten Weltkriegs in russische Gefangenschaft geriet und nach Kriegsende nicht mehr zurÃ¼ckgekehrt ist â ein Frauenschicksal, wie es die beiden Weltkriege in Ã¼bergroÃer Zahl hervorgebracht haben.

The model is built upon rapid distortion theory (RDT) following studies by Mann and by Hanazaki and Hunt, using...... the eddy lifetime parameterization of Mann to make the model stationary. The buoyant spectral tensor model is driven via five parameters: the viscous dissipation rate epsilon, length scale of energy-containing eddies L, a turbulence anisotropy parameter Gamma, gradient Richardson number (Ri) representing...\n\n\"Das unausgesprochene GefÃ¼hl der UnzugehÃ¶rigkeit\" : Amerika als ZufluchtsmÃ¶glichkeit vor dem Selbst in Max Frischs Romanen Stiller und Homo faber\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nVesna KondriÄ Horvat\n\n1993-12-01\n\nFull Text Available In seiner Rede Emigranten, die er 1958 anlÃ¤Ãlich der Georg-BtichnerPreis- Verleihung hielt und woraus das Titelzitat des vorliegenden Beitrags stammt, Ã¤uÃerte Max Frisch die Meinung, jeder frei gewahlte Wohnsitz solle dem Schriftsteller das unausgesprochene GefÃ¼hl der UnzugehÃ¶rigkeit gestatten.
