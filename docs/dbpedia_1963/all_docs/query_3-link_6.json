        "text": "Although they have only participated twice at the Eurovision Song Contest reaching the final on both occasions and finishing 11th and 12th makes Georgia quite a successful country. Tonight they are going to decide who will be going to Moscow in order to continue this success.\n\nWhen Diana Gurtskaya in May finished 11th at the Eurovision Song Contest with the song Peace Will Come she had no idea that just two months later her country would be in actual war against Russia due to conflicts in the two regions South Ossettia and Azkhabia. When Russian soldiers were fighting against Georgia on Georgian territorial the country announced that they would withdraw from the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest as they feared for their safety in Moscow.\n\nWhen the war ended EBU got involved and via negotiations tried to convince Georgia to reconsider. These succeed and Georgia decided to take part after all. That they in the meantime also won the Junior Eurovision Song Contest might also have been a part of this decision.\n\nTonight ten songs will compete in the national final for the honour of representing the country in Moscow. Whoever wins will have quite some expectations to live up to as Georgia’s previous two entries both have qualified for the Eurovision Song Contest final. Sopho’s Visionary Dream finished 12th in 2007 and as previously mentioned this was beaten by Diana Gurtskaya’s 12th place in Belgrade.\n\nThe ten songs competing tonight from 19:00 CET is:\n\nBachi Kitiashvili & Bermukha – Khvalindeli Dghe\n\nNovember – Over\n\nGiorgi Maisuradze – Peace In The World\n\nTika Phatsatsia – Miracle\n\nTony O’Malley, Mari Pavliashvili, Marika Asatiani, Nana Chikava, Andro Melashvili, Guga Aphtsiauri – Hear My Plea\n\nNodiko Tatishvili – No Sun When You Are Near\n\nBoris Bedia – Dagvipharavs Ghmerti\n\nStephane & 3G – We Don’t Wanna Put In\n\nAnri Jokhadze – I\n\nKeti Orjonikidze – Tomorrow"
