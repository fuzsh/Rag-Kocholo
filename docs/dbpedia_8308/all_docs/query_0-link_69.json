        "text": "Popular Bible readings for funerals\n\nBible readings are commonly read at all kinds of funerals, but they play a vital part in any Christian service. At Catholic funerals, it is common to have a reading from both the Old and New Testaments, while Church of England and funerals in other denominations almost always contain at least one scripture that was a favourite of the deceased, or meaningful to those gathered at the funeral.\n\nJohn 14:1-3\n\nIsaiah 57:1-2\n\nMatthew 23:23\n\nEcclesiastes 3:1-4\n\nJohn 14:1-3 – Do Not Let Your Hearts Be Troubled\n\nThe words of Jesus to his disciples not long before his own death have long been a comfort to those mourning the loss of a loved one. The message of comfort after death, and of advanced preparation for this time, remind Christian congregations that death is not the end for their loved one.\n\n“Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe also in me. My Father’s house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.”\n\nIsaiah 57:1-2 – Those Who Walk Uprightly Enter Into Peace\n\nFor those struggling with questions and confusion after the loss of a loved one, Isaiah 57 brings a message of consolation. It makes no secret of the fact that death can be hard to understand, but offers hope to those mourning their loved ones.\n\nThe righteous perish,\n\nand no one takes it to heart;\n\nthe devout are taken away,\n\nand no one understands\n\nthat the righteous are taken away\n\nto be spared from evil.\n\nThose who walk uprightly\n\nenter into peace;\n\nthey find rest as they lie in death.\n\nMatthew 23:23 – Good and Faithful Servant\n\nTaken from Jesus’ parable of the bags of gold, this verse brings hope and positivity to funeral services by speaking of a promised reward for a faithful life. It can be particularly effective when read alongside memories of your loved one’s life.\n\n“His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’”\n\nEcclesiastes 3:1-4\n\nEcclesiastes is a whole book about what it means to live and die well, and this famous passage from chapter 3 is particularly fitting for funerals. It acknowledges that life isn’t always easy, making space for people to grieve without feeling pushed into any emotions they’re not ready for.\n\nThere is a time for everything,\n\nand a season for every activity under the heavens:\n\na time to be born and a time to die,\n\na time to plant and a time to uproot,\n\na time to kill and a time to heal,\n\na time to tear down and a time to build,\n\na time to weep and a time to laugh,\n\na time to mourn and a time to dance\n\nReligious funeral poems\n\nIn addition to Bible passages, Christian poems can be the perfect way to express yourself or bring comfort to the congregation at a loved one’s funeral. The authors of these poems wrote them in the context of their own Christian faith, which gives them a tone and message that will be consistent with any other songs or readings at a religious funeral.\n\nSunLife has also published a complete guide to bereavement poems, with ideas for lots of different types of ceremony and event, that you can refer to if you’re looking for more ideas.\n\nWhen I Am Dead, My Dearest\n\nIn Pastures Green\n\nThe Blessing of St Francis of Assisi\n\nWhen I Am Dead, My Dearest – Christina Rossetti\n\nWritten from the perspective of one who has already passed away, Rossetti’s words encourage the listener to go on living their life. While not overtly religious in its language, Rossetti herself was a Christian poet, and the poem’s positive, almost relaxed wording reveals her attitude of Christian peace in the face of death.\n\nWhen I am dead, my dearest,\n\nSing no sad songs for me;\n\nPlant thou no roses at my head,\n\nNor shady cypress tree:\n\nBe the green grass above me\n\nWith showers and dewdrops wet;\n\nAnd if thou wilt, remember,\n\nAnd if thou wilt, forget.\n\nI shall not see the shadows,\n\nI shall not feel the rain;\n\nI shall not hear the nightingale\n\nSing on, as if in pain:\n\nAnd dreaming through the twilight\n\nThat doth not rise nor set,\n\nHaply I may remember,\n\nAnd haply may forget.\n\nIn Pastures Green – Henry H. Barry\n\nHenry H. Barry’s short poem expresses his comfort in the fact that, though life is not always easy, God is standing by his side. This poem is perfectly suited to Christian funerals, as it acknowledges the pain of those listening, but leaves them with the reassurance of God’s presence.\n\n“In pastures green?” Not always; sometimes He,\n\nWho knoweth best, in kindness leadeth me\n\nIn weary ways, where heavy shadows be.\n\nAnd “by still waters?” No, not always so;\n\nOft times the heavy tempests round me blow,\n\nAnd o’er my soul the waves and billows go.\n\nBut when the storm beats loudest, and I cry\n\nAloud for help, the Master standeth by,\n\nAnd whispers to my soul, “Lo, it is I.”\n\nSo, where He leads me, I can safely go,\n\nAnd in the blest hereafter I shall know\n\nWhy in His wisdom He hath led me so.\n\nThe Blessing of St. Francis of Assisi\n\nSt. Francis of Assissi’s famous blessing is a well-known prayer used around the Christian church today. These familiar, comforting words are the perfect way to close a funeral service and leave those attending with a message of peace.\n\nThe Lord bless you and keep you.\n\nMay He show His face to you and have mercy.\n\nMay He turn His countenance to you and give you peace.\n\nThe Lord bless you!\n\nExtracts from Christian books & sermons\n\nReligious funeral readings can be taken from books as well as scriptures and poems. With such a wealth of material out there it is impossible to include every passage that you might want to include in a Christian service, but the examples below should give you an idea of the kind of messages you might want to think about.\n\nFor the Life of the World\n\nLiving Is Death, Dying Is Life\n\nThe Last Battle\n\nFor the Life of the World – Alexander Schmemann\n\nThis quote from a book by Orthodox priest Alexander Schmemann is a rousing statement of hope in the face of death. He is refreshingly honest in admitting that he can’t know how everything will turn out in the end, but his joyous focus on death as an act of communion with Life, and the stirring message of hope in the final sentence, make this passage an ideal choice if you want to bring a clear note of encouragement to your funeral service.\n\n“If I make this new life mine, mine this hunger and thirst for the Kingdom, mine this expectation of Christ, mine the certitude that Christ is life, then my very death will be an act of communion with Life. For neither life nor death can separate us from the love of Christ. I do not know when and how the fulfilment will come. I do not know when all things will be consummated in Christ. I know nothing about the ‘whens’ and ‘hows.’ But I know that in Christ this great Passage [...] of the world has begun, that the life of the ‘world to come’ comes to us in the joy and peace of the Holy Spirit, for Christ is risen and life reigneth.”\n\nLiving Is Death, Dying Is Life – Henry Ward Beecher\n\nHenry Ward Beecher was an American minister in the 19th century, known for his focus on the love of God. The quote below is a great example a Christian emphasis on hope and life after death. It is an encouraging message that life does not end with death, with a joyful undertone that is perfectly in keeping with a Christian funeral.\n\n“Living is death; dying is life. We are not what we appear to be. On this side of the grave we are exiles, on that, citizens; on this side, orphans, on that, children; on this side, captives; on that, freemen; on this side, disguised, unknown; on that, disclosed and proclaimed as the sons of God.”\n\nThe Last Battle – C. S. Lewis\n\nPossibly one of the most influential Christian authors of the 20th century, C. S. Lewis’ words are often quoted today. His Chronicles of Narnia series contains many gems like this one, which comes from the final scenes of The Last Battle. He writes of a great story just beginning, and hints at wonders beyond what we can see in this life. It has a comforting, playful tone, and is the perfect choice to bring a sensitive spark of joy to a religious funeral.\n\n“And as He spoke, He no longer looked to them like a lion; but the things that began to happen after that were so great and beautiful that I cannot write them. And for us this is the end of all the stories, and we can most truly say that they all lived happily ever after. But for them it was only the beginning of the real story. All their life in this world and all their adventures in Narnia had only been the cover and the title page: now at last they were beginning Chapter One of the Great Story which no one on earth has read: which goes on forever: in which every chapter is better than the one before.”\n\nHymns to play at a funeral\n\nThese examples of popular funeral hymns all have beautiful and poignant meanings. They are timeless songs that have been with us in different forms for centuries. Depending on your preferences they can be played on an organ in a traditional arrangement, or played in a variety of contemporary styles.\n\nWe’ve included the best known lyrics for these hymns, but the words can also be modernised easily, and we encourage you to look for the version that you feel best suits your loved one’s funeral.\n\nRead our guide to funeral hymns and songs if you’re looking for more ideas.\n\nAmazing Grace\n\nBe Thou My Vision\n\nIt Is Well With My Soul\n\nAmazing Grace – John Newton\n\nOne of the best known English language hymns in the world, Amazing Grace was written in the late 1700s by Anglican clergyman John Newton. It’s words have a comforting familiarity that can help to put people at ease in a funeral service, and its message of forgiveness and eternal life is a ray of hope in difficult seasons.\n\nAmazing grace, how sweet the sound\n\nThat saved a wretch like me\n\nI once was lost, but now I am found\n\nWas blind, but now I see\n\n‘Twas grace that taught my heart to fear\n\nAnd grace my fears relieved\n\nHow precious did that grace appear\n\nThe hour I first believed\n\nThrough many dangers, toils and snares\n\nWe have already come\n\n‘Twas grace has brought us safe thus far\n\nAnd grace will lead us home\n\nWhen we’ve been there ten thousand years\n\nBright, shining as the sun\n\nWe’ve no less days to sing God’s praise\n\nThan when we’ve first begun\n\nAmazing grace, how sweet the sound\n\nThat saved a wretch like me\n\nI once was lost, but now I am found\n\nWas blind, but now I see\n\nBe Thou My Vision – Eleanor Hull\n\nBe Thou My Vision is an ancient hymn with roots in Old Irish. The familiar English words printed below come from Eleanor Hull’s 1912 version, and the hymn has more recently been modernised in a popular song by the contemporary Christian group Rend Collective as You Are My Vision. Whichever wording and arrangement you prefer, the song’s emphasis on trust, faithfulness to God and the joy waiting for us in Heaven is a powerful message for any Christian funeral.\n\nBe Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;\n\nNaught be all else to me, save that Thou art.\n\nThou my best Thought, by day or by night,\n\nWaking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.\n\nBe Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word;\n\nI ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;\n\nThou my great Father, I Thy true son;\n\nThou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.\n\nBe Thou my battle Shield, Sword for the fight;\n\nBe Thou my Dignity, Thou my Delight;\n\nThou my soul's Shelter, Thou my high Tow’r:\n\nRaise Thou me heav’nward, O Pow’r of my pow’r.\n\nRiches I heed not, nor man's empty praise,\n\nThou mine Inheritance, now and always:\n\nThou and Thou only, first in my heart,\n\nHigh King of Heaven, my Treasure Thou art.\n\nHigh King of Heaven, my victory won,\n\nMay I reach Heaven's joys, O bright Heav’n's Sun!\n\nHeart of my own heart, whatever befall,\n\nStill be my Vision, O Ruler of all.\n\nIt Is Well With My Soul – Horatio Spafford\n\nHoratio Spafford’s 1873 hymn was written in the aftermath of the tragic losses of his son and four daughters over the course of just two years. Despite everything, his faith inspired peace as he sailed near the spot where his daughters had died at sea, and he wrote a stirring hymn of comfort, trust and gratitude that still resonates with countless people around the world today.\n\nWhen peace like a river, attendeth my way,\n\nWhen sorrows like sea billows roll;\n\nWhatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to know\n\nIt is well, it is well, with my soul.\n\nRefrain\n\nIt is well, (it is well),\n\nWith my soul, (with my soul)\n\nIt is well, it is well, with my soul.\n\nThough Satan should buffet, though trials should come,\n\nLet this blest assurance control,\n\nThat Christ has regarded my helpless estate,\n\nAnd hath shed His own blood for my soul.\n\nMy sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!\n\nMy sin, not in part but the whole,\n\nIs nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,\n\nPraise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!\n\nFor me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live:\n\nIf Jordan above me shall roll,\n\nNo pang shall be mine, for in death as in life,\n\nThou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.\n\nBut Lord, 'tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait,\n\nThe sky, not the grave, is our goal;\n\nOh, trump of the angel! Oh, voice of the Lord!\n\nBlessed hope, blessed rest of my soul.\n\nAnd Lord, haste the day when the faith shall be sight,\n\nThe clouds be rolled back as a scroll;\n\nThe trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,\n\nA song in the night, oh my soul!\n\nOther Christian funeral songs\n\nContemporary Christian worship music is becoming increasingly popular in funeral services, with modern songs expressing timeless messages in everyday language. Like hymns, these songs can be played in a number of ways, from one person leading on an organ, keyboard or guitar, to a full band with multiple singers and musicians.\n\n10,000 Reasons\n\nAmazing Grace (My Chains Are Gone)\n\nGod I Look To You\n\nI Can Only Imagine\n\nYou Never Let Go\n\n10,000 Reasons – Matt Redman\n\nMatt Redman’s modern worship hymn is one of the most popular Christian songs of the 21st century. Sung around the world, its message of lifelong worship and faithfulness is particularly appropriate for congregations remembering and celebrating a loved one’s life in their funeral.\n\nBless the Lord O my soul\n\nO my soul\n\nWorship His Holy name\n\nSing like never before\n\nO my soul\n\nI’ll worship Your Holy name\n\nThe sun comes up\n\nIt’s a new day dawning\n\nIt’s time to sing Your song again\n\nWhatever may pass\n\nAnd whatever lies before me\n\nLet me be singing\n\nWhen the evening comes\n\n[Chorus]\n\nYou’re rich in love\n\nAnd You’re slow to anger\n\nYour name is great\n\nAnd Your heart is kind\n\nFor all Your goodness\n\nI will keep on singing\n\nTen thousand reasons\n\nFor my heart to find\n\n[Chorus]\n\nAnd on that day\n\nWhen my strength is failing\n\nThe end draws near\n\nAnd my time has come\n\nStill my soul will\n\nSing Your praise unending\n\nTen thousand years\n\nAnd then forevermore\n\nLyrics source(genius.com opens in a new tab)\n\nAmazing Grace (My Chains Are Gone) – Chris Tomlin\n\nChris Tomlin’s take on Amazing Grace adapts lyrics from John Newton’s original, but modernises some of the language and adds a new ‘My chains are gone…’ chorus. If you’re looking for a modern twist on a classic hymn, this song is one of the best examples in contemporary Christian music.\n\nAmazing grace\n\nHow sweet the sound\n\nThat saved a wretch like me\n\nI once was lost, but now I'm found\n\nWas blind, but now I see\n\n'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear\n\nAnd grace my fears relieved\n\nHow precious did that grace appear\n\nThe hour I first believed\n\nMy chains are gone\n\nI've been set free\n\nMy God, my Savior has ransomed me\n\nAnd like a flood His mercy reigns\n\nUnending love, amazing grace\n\nThe Lord has promised good to me\n\nHis word my hope secures\n\nHe will my shield and portion be\n\nAs long as life endures\n\nMy chains are gone\n\nI've been set free\n\nMy God, my Savior has ransomed me\n\nAnd like a flood His mercy reigns\n\nUnending love, amazing grace\n\nThe earth shall soon dissolve like snow\n\nThe sun forbear to shine\n\nBut God, Who called me here below,\n\nWill be forever mine.\n\nWill be forever mine.\n\nYou are forever mine.\n\nLyrics source(genius.com opens in a new tab)\n\nGod I Look to You – Bethel Music\n\nOne of many popular songs to have come out of California’s Bethel church, God I Look to You is a beautiful expression of trust in God through difficult times.
