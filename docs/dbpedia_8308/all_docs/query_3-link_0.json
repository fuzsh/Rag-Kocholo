His headstrong son, Paul (Don McKellar), chafes against the humiliations he must endure, but the rabbi cautions him against exploding into violence. Tensions come to a head when the rabbi's daughter, Rachel (Elina Lowensohn), is raped by a Nazi officer. Yet out of this act of violence comes a ray of hope when a soldier comes forward and offers to help her escape.",
