        "text": "PROSPERO\n\n[to FERDINAND] If I have too austerely punished you, Your compensation makes amends, for I Have given you here a third of mine own life— Or that for which I live— who once again I tender to thy hand. All thy vexations Were but my trials of thy love and thou Hast strangely stood the test. Here, afore heaven, I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand, Do not smile at me that I boast of her, For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise And make it halt behind her.\n\nPROSPERO\n\n[To FERDINAND] If I’ve been too strict in my punishment of you, your compensation will make it better. For I am giving you my daughter, who makes up a third of my entire life, and who is everything I live for. I put her into your hands. All of the trouble I gave you was just my way of testing your love for her, and you have endured those tests extraordinarily well. Here, before God, I promise you that I will give you this precious gift. Oh, Ferdinand, don’t laugh at me for praising her so highly, because you’ll discover that she exceeds all the praise given to her.\n\nPROSPERO\n\nThen as my gift and thine own acquisition Worthily purchased, take my daughter. But If thou dost break her virgin knot before All sanctimonious ceremonies may With full and holy rite be ministered, No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall To make this contract grow, but barren hate, Sour-eyed disdain, and discord shall bestrew The union of your bed with weeds so loathly That you shall hate it both. Therefore take heed, As Hymen’s lamps shall light you.\n\nPROSPERO\n\nThen, as a gift from me and as your well-earned reward, take my daughter. But if you take her virginity before the marriage ceremony is performed according to all the sacred traditions, the heavens will not shower blessings on your marriage. Instead, empty hate, bitter disrespect, and conflict will ruin your marriage until you both grow to despise it. So listen to what I'm saying if you want to have a happy marriage blessed by Hymen.\n\nFERDINAND\n\nAs I hope For quiet days, fair issue, and long life, With such love as ’tis now, the murkiest den, The most opportune place, the strong’st suggestion, Our worser genius can shall never melt Mine honor into lust to take away The edge of that day’s celebration When I shall think, or Phoebus' steeds are foundered, Or night kept chained below.\n\nFERDINAND\n\nSince I hope to enjoy quiet days, beautiful children, and a long life filled with the love that I have now, not even the greatest opportunity or strongest temptation will allow my worse instincts to overcome my honor, and let me give in to lust. Doing so would only remove the anticipation from that day's celebration, when I'll be so excited for my first night with Miranda that I'll wonder if the sun has stopped in the sky, or if night has been locked away somehow.\n\nPROSPERO\n\nThou and thy meaner fellows your last service Did worthily perform, and I must use you In such another trick. Go bring the rabble, O'er whom I give thee power, here to this place. Incite them to quick motion, for I must Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple Some vanity of mine art. It is my promise, And they expect it from me.\n\nPROSPERO\n\nYou and your lesser friends performed well in your last task, and now I need you to do something similar. Go bring the whole group here. I give you the power to control them. Make sure they come quickly, because I must use my magic to give this young couple a show. I promised I would, and they’re expecting it.\n\nPROSPERO\n\n[To FERDINAND] Be mindful that you stay true to your promise to remain chaste before marriage. Don’t let your flirting push you over the edge. Even the strongest promises can get burned to a crisp by the fire of lust in your blood. Be more self-disciplined, or else say goodbye to your vow.\n\nIRIS\n\nCeres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats, and peas; Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep, And flat meads thatched with stover, them to keep; Thy banks with pionèd and twillèd brims, Which spongy April at thy hest betrims To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom groves, Whose shadow the dismissèd bachelor loves, Being lass-lorn; thy pole-clipped vineyard; And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky hard, Where thou thyself dost air— the Queen o' th' Sky, Whose watery arch and messenger am I, Bids thee leave these, and with her sovereign grace, Here on this grass plot, in this very place, To come and sport. Her peacocks fly amain.\n\nIRIS\n\nCeres, I am the messenger that carries the rainbow for Juno, the Queen of the Sky. She commands you to leave behind your rich farmlands of wheat, rye, barley, oats, and peas; the grassy hills where sheep graze and the meadows covered with hay for the sheep to eat in winter; your riverbanks covered in vines and branches that April, on your orders, covers with flowers for virginal nymphs to use to make crowns; your yellow-flowered groves where young men go when they have been rejected by their lovers; your pruned vineyards; your rocky seashore where you yourself fly. Leave all those places, and come to meet the Queen on this grassy spot—this very place—to come and play. The peacocks that draw her chariot approach at full speed.\n\nCERES\n\nTell me, heavenly rainbow, do you know if either Venus or her son Cupid are with the queen? Ever since the two of them plotted a way for Dis to steal from me my daughter Proserpina, I have sworn never to go near Venus or her blind son again.\n\nIRIS\n\nOf her society Be not afraid. I met her deity Cutting the clouds towards Paphos, and her son Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have done Some wanton charm upon this man and maid, Whose vows are that no bed-right shall be paid Till Hymen’s torch be lighted—but in vain. Mars’s hot minion is returned again. Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows, Swears he will shoot no more, but play with sparrows And be a boy right out.\n\nIRIS\n\nDon’t be afraid that you will have to see her. I met Venus as she was flying with her son in a carriage pulled by doves through the sky towards her home on the island of Paphos. They had been planning to put a magic spell upon this man and woman. The spell would have made them break their vow that they would not sleep together until Hymen's torch was lit on their wedding day. Venus, that lustful wife of Mars, has returned home again. And hot-headed Cupid has broken all his arrows. He swears he will never shoot them again, and will instead play with sparrows like a regular boy.\n\nPROSPERO\n\n[to FERDINAND] You do look, my son, in a moved sort, As if you were dismayed. Be cheerful, sir. Our revels now are ended. These our actors, As I foretold you, were all spirits and Are melted into air, into thin air. And like the baseless fabric of this vision, The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces, The solemn temples, the great globe itself, Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve, And like this insubstantial pageant faded, Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff As dreams are made on, and our little life Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vexed. Bear with my weakness. My old brain is troubled. Be not disturbed with my infirmity. If you be pleased, retire into my cell And there repose. A turn or two I’ll walk To still my beating mind.\n\nPROSPERO\n\n[To FERDINAND] My son-in-law, you look troubled, as if something has made you upset. Cheer up, sir. The show is now finished. These actors, as I told you, were all spirits, and they’ve melted into the air, thin air. And like this vision—with its towers reaching to the clouds, its gorgeous palaces, its grand temples (which in fact have no underlying structure)—the actual world, and everyone living in it, will dissolve just as this illusion has disappeared, leaving not even a wisp of cloud behind. We are all made of the stuff of dreams, and our small lifespans stretch from the sleep before birth to the sleep after death. Sir, I’m upset. Please put up with this weakness of mine. My old brain is troubled, but don’t be disturbed by it. If you would like to, you can go to my hut and relax. I’ll take a little walk to calm my restless mind.\n\nARIEL\n\nI told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking, So full of valor that they smote the air For breathing in their faces, beat the ground For kissing of their feet; yet always bending Towards their project. Then I beat my tabor, At which, like unbacked colts, they pricked their ears, Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses As they smelt music. So I charmed their ears That, calflike, they my lowing followed through Toothed briers, sharp furzes, pricking gorse, and thorns, Which entered their frail shins. At last I left them I' th' filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell, There dancing up to th' chins, that the foul lake O'erstunk their feet.\n\nARIEL\n\nI told you, sir, they were wildly drunk—so full of inflated courage that they were striking at the air with their swords for blowing in their faces, and hitting the ground for touching their feet. Yet at the same time they’ve never lost sight of their plan. Then I beat my drum, at which—like colts that had never been ridden—they pricked up their ears, looked around, and lifted their noises as if to smell the music. So with my music I put a spell on their ears that made them follow me like trusting calves through sharp-leaved bushes, prickly shrubs, and thorns—all of which stuck in their vulnerable shins. Finally, I left them in the middle of the scum-covered pond behind your hut, with the stinking water lapping at their chins.\n\nPROSPERO\n\nHe's a devil, a devil from the moment he was born. His nature can never be changed, no matter how much care he receives. All my work for him—all done with sincere care for him—had no effect, absolutely no effect. As he grows older, his body grows uglier, and his mind becomes more evil. I’ll put them all in agony until they roar in pain.\n\nPROSPERO\n\nMay they be hunted down. As of now, all my enemies are at my mercy. Soon all my work will be done, and you’ll be free to fly wherever you want. For a little longer, though, follow my orders and do some more work for me."
