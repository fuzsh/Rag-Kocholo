        "text": "\"Path\" and \"realm\" result in very different images. \"Path\" brings to mind the image of danger on every side except unless you stay right there. \"Realm\" makes the image more like a fenced-in pasture; you can go anywhere within the pasture and be safe. This is a very common metaphor in the rabbinic writings. Torah is a fence that keeps us safe from outer dangers.\n\nHowever, looking at the Hebrew word in Brown, Driver, Briggs Lexicon, ma'gal, I see it means \"entrenchment, track, (fig.) course of action, way of life.\" It appears in such places as Proverbs 4:11 where \"upright paths\" (using ma'gal) appears in parallel to \"way of wisdom\" (using derek) (ma'gal is also parallel to derek in Proverbs 4:26). The imagery in Psalm 17:5 is similar, \"My steps have held fast to Thy paths. My feet have not slipped.\"\n\nI conclude that \"path\" is acceptable for ma'gal.\n\nYou make a very good point with #2.\n\nI definitely agree on point 3. No question the Hebrew means much more than a mere following. It is ironic in that this is the only place in the Hebrew Bible where \"pursue\" has \"goodness and mercy\" as the subject. Usually, it is a person's enemies who pursue him this way. However, God (goodness and mercy being used of Him) will pursue His beloved every bit as hard as armies pursue their enemies.\n\nRegarding point 4, you have a very strong argument against \"forever,\" but I disagree with reading it as \"more time.\" Your case is especially strong when you look at the rest of the verse. The NET Bible translates it this way (very close to your translation).\n\n23:6 Surely your goodness and faithfulness will pursue me all my days,\n\nand I will live in the Lord’s house for the rest of my life.\n\n(Bold added to show parallel.)\n\nThey take \"for lengthening of days\" as \"rest of my life\" because that translation shows how the two Hebrew phrases in bold stand in parallel. Other places where the phrase לארך ימים is used (see Deuteronomy 30:20; Job 12:12; Psalm 91:16; Proverbs 3:2, 16; Lamentations 5:20) refer to a human life. An exception is Psalm 21:4* where the phrase is followed by the intensifier \"forever and ever.\"\n\n*I linked to the KJV because it shows the \"forever and ever\" phrase where the NET uses \"an enduring dynasty\" to show how the king will achieve eternal life.\n\nMasoretic Text vs. Original Hebrew?\n\nI am not completely sure, but you seem to be rating the common translations based on how the completely unvocalized, unaccented Hebrew could be read. But - with the exceptions of translations based on the Septuagint or the Latin Vulgate - the majority of English translations are based on the medieval Masoretic Hebrew Text and not the original, unvocalized Hebrew.\n\nI think it is correct - as you demonstrate - that the completely unvocalized words also have unique meanings, but it seems that at least in the case of the verses you cite, certain vowels were understood to have been implied.\n\nOf course, one could argue (perhaps often successfully) that the Masoretes got some of the vocalizations wrong, but when I compared what the Masoretic Text implies to how the Septuagint and Vulgate interpreted proto Hebrew texts older than that consulted by the Masoretes, the conventional translations (e.g. both Christian and Jewish, below) of these verses seem to be in order.\n\nVerse 3\n\nHe restoreth my soul: He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake (KJV)\n\nHe restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name’s sake (RSV)\n\nHe renews my life; He guides me in right paths as befits His name (JPS Tanakh)\n\nHe restores my soul; He leads me in paths of righteousness for His name's sake (Chabad.org)\n\nYou wrote:\n\nThe accepted translations are saying\n\nHe leads me in paths of righteousness.\n\n?\n\nIn Hebrew, it actually says, at least what I believe to say,\n\nHe-marshalls(guide by contraints)-me within realm/circle of righteousness.\n\nThere is no word \"path\" in the sentence at all. Does anyone see the word \"path\" (דרך, רחוב)?\n\nYou quoted the unvocalized Hebrew:\n\nינחני במעגלי צדק\n\nbut the translations are working with the vocalized and accented Masoretic Text:\n\nיַֽנְחֵ֥נִי בְמַעְגְּלֵי־צֶ֝֗דֶק\n\nThe Masoretic מַעְגָּל (mǎʿ·gāl) - translated as \"path\" - is related to the word for wagon - עֲגָלָה (ʿǎḡā·lā(h)). The connection is \"path\" as a wagon rut. The unvocalized Hebrew that you wrote (and is presumably in the \"original\" written text) is עגל - 'gl' which is the root of circle (e.g. עָגֹל - \"round\"; עָגִיל - \"earring\".\n\nThat \"path\" really what was intended in the original Hebrew was witnessed by the Septuagint, which translates the word in the proto-Hebrew as τρίβος - which means \"path\" or \"pathway\" in Greek. Jerome, working with a later Hebrew text, but still earlier than the source of the Masoretic text, also interpreted עגל as \"path\" (Latin semita).\n\nRashi comments on the phrase: \"In straight paths, so that I should not fall into the hands of my enemies.\"\n\nVerse 5\n\nThou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over (KJV).\n\nThou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies; thou anointest my head with oil, my cup overflows (RSV).\n\nYou spread a table for me in full view of my enemies; You anoint my head with oil; my drink is abundant (JPS Tanakh).\n\nYou set a table before me in the presence of my adversaries; You anointed my head with oil; my cup overflows (Chabad.org).\n\nYou wrote:\n\nתערך לפני שלחן - You arrange before me a table\n\nנגד צררי - against/affronting my enemies.\n\nHowever, the accepted translations are saying,\n\nYou prepare a table before me in the \"presence\" of my enemies. ערך would be to arrange and place per item deliberately following a plan or principle.\n\nAgain, you are referring to the unvocalized Hebrew in your interpretation:\n\nתערך לפני שלחן נגד צררי\n\nThe Masoretic Text reads:\n\nתַּעֲרֹ֬ךְ לְפָנַ֨י ׀ שֻׁלְחָ֗ן נֶ֥גֶד צֹרְרָ֑י\n\nThe word you are referring to - ערך - is rendered as עֲרֹ֬ךְ. The unvocalized root of the Masoretic interpolation עֲרֹ֬ךְ (ʿē·rěḵ) - ערך ('rk) does mean, I think, what you say; but the Masoretic word implies \"preparing\" as the translations suggest. Again, this is born out in the Greek and Latin witnesses as well: ἑτοιμάζω and parō, respectively. But even 'rk is not off, if one visualizes preparing a table as setting out plates and utensils.\n\nVerse 6\n\nSurely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: And I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever (KJV).\n\nSurely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD for ever (RSV).\n\nOnly goodness and steadfast love shall pursue me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD for many long years (JPS Tanakh).\n\nMay only goodness and kindness pursue me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for length of days (Chabad.org).\n\nYou quoted the Hebrew as:\n\nלארך ימים\n\nIn the Masoretic Text this is׃\n\nלְאֹ֣רֶךְ יָמִֽים\n\nwhich is literally \"length of days\" (l - ʾō·rěḵ - yôm). I think perhaps one could argue that it simply means \"more time\" on the basis of another reading of the unvocalized Hebrew, since ארך ('rk) is used in the sense you suggest, but it seems that this was not what the Masoretes understood the original Hebrew to say. Again, this seems borne out in the Greek and Latin witnesses as well, where the phrase לארך ימים was translated as εἰς μακρότητα ἡμερῶν by the Alexandrian Jewish Septuagint translators and as in longitudinem dierum by Jerome, both more or less saying \"in length of days\"."
