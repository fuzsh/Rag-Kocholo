Read through our selection of some funeral Bible verses which you may wish to read at your loved one’s funeral.\n\nRomans 8:35, 37- 39\n\nWho will separate us from the love of Christ? Will hardship, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.\n\nFor I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor rulers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.\n\nJohn 14:1-3\n\nDo not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe also in me. My Father’s house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.\n\nEcclesiastes 3:1-4\n\nThere is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens: a time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to uproot, a time to kill and a time to heal, a time to tear down and a time to build, a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance…\n\n1 Thessalonians 4:14-17\n\nFor since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep. For this we declare to you by a word from the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep.\n\nFor the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord.\n\nJob 19:23-27\n\nOh, that my words were written!\n\nOh, that they were inscribed in a book!\n\nThat they were engraved on a rock\n\nWith an iron pen and lead, forever!\n\nFor I know that my Redeemer lives,\n\nAnd He shall stand at last on the earth;\n\nAnd after my skin is destroyed, this I know,\n\nThat in my flesh I shall see God,\n\nWhom I shall see for myself,\n\nAnd my eyes shall behold, and not another.\n\nHow my heart yearns within me!\n\nLong Bible readings for funerals\n\nAre you looking for funeral Bible verses which are long and meaningful?

And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.\n\nAnd I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “See, the home of God is among mortals. He will dwell with them; they will be his peoples, and God himself will be with them; he will wipe every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; mourning and crying and pain will be no more, for the first things have passed away.\"\n\nAnd the one who was seated on the throne said, \"See, I am making all things new.\" Also he said, \"Write this, for these words are trustworthy and true.\" Then he said to me, \"It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give water as a gift from the spring of the water of life. Those who conquer will inherit these things, and I will be their God and they will be my children.\n\nShort Bible readings for funerals\n\nOften, there will be multiple funeral Bible verses, read by family or friends at a traditional funeral.
