        "text": "After Jesus died on the cross, everyone who witnessed it went home thinking that He had lost…\n\nLuke 23:48 (NKJV)\n\n48 And the whole crowd who came together to that sight, seeing what had been done, beat their breasts and returned.\n\nHe allowed His enemies to abuse and mock Him…\n\nMatthew 27:27-31 (NKJV)\n\n27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the [a]Praetorium and gathered the whole [b]garrison around Him. 28 And they stripped Him and put a scarlet robe on Him. 29 When they had [c]twisted a crown of thorns, they put it on His head, and a reed in His right hand. And they bowed the knee before Him and mocked Him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” 30 Then they spat on Him, and took the reed and struck Him on the head. 31 And when they had mocked Him, they took the robe off Him, put His own clothes on Him, and led Him away to be crucified.\n\nHe suffered embarrassment and shame in front of His supporters and allowed them to think He failed, because He knew that wasn’t the end of the story…\n\nHebrews 12:2 (NKJV)\n\n2 looking unto Jesus, the [a]author and [b]finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.\n\nJesus is our perfect example of the fact that sometimes you have to let your enemies think they have won.\n\nSo, if it seems your adversaries, enemies or antagonists have the upper hand, keep trusting God.\n\nDon’t take matters into your own hands seeking revenge, that belongs to God. But, God rise up to vindicate those who put their trust in Him…\n\nPsalm 35:23-27 (NKJV)\n\n23 Stir up Yourself, and awake to my vindication,\n\nTo my cause, my God and my Lord.\n\n24 Vindicate me, O Lord my God, according to Your righteousness;\n\nAnd let them not rejoice over me.\n\n25 Let them not say in their hearts, “Ah, so we would have it!”\n\nLet them not say, “We have swallowed him up.”\n\n26 Let them be ashamed and brought to mutual confusion\n\nWho rejoice at my hurt;\n\nLet them be clothed with shame and dishonor\n\nWho exalt themselves against me.\n\n27 Let them shout for joy and be glad,\n\nWho favor my righteous cause;\n\nAnd let them say continually,\n\n“Let the Lord be magnified,\n\nRemember, revenge is taking matters into our own hands to satisfy our pride and bring glory to ourselves. But, waiting for God to vindicate us is putting our trust in Him to get His glory out of our situation…and our enemies will witness it, while our supporters praise God.\n\nSo, let them scheme, plot, conspire, mock, even strike you.\n\nLet them fire you.\n\nLet them abandon you.\n\nLet them accuse you.\n\nGod is watching.\n\nLet them think they have won just like Jesus did.\n\nWhen they think they’ve won, they let their guard down. They shift their focus away from you, while God maintains His focus on you…and them.\n\nBe patient and trust God, in His timing He will get glory from the anointing on your life and your situation while planting seeds of faith…seeds of repentance…seeds of salvation and seeds of much good fruit.\n\nJust as Jesus claimed His victory three days and three nights later, you will enjoy your victory too in the presence of you enemies…\n\nPsalm 23:5 (NKJV)\n\n5 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;\n\nYou anoint my head with oil;\n\nMy cup runs over.\n\nSo, don’t avoid your enemies. Stay strong and work your purpose. How can God prepare a table before you in the presence of your enemies if you don’t invite them to the table?\n\nBE BLESSTIFIED."
