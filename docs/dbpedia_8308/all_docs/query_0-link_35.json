        "text": "Reflection on the 23rd Psalm to bring you strength today\n\nAs Christians, Bible scripture can be uplifting and bring us peace. Psalm 23 contains many of our favourite encouraging Bible passages and reminds us of the peace of God guiding us as our shepherd. Found in the Old Testament, originally written in Hebrew by David and translated into English, these words can bring us great comfort in tough times. The 23rd Psalm reminds us that we can always trust Christ Jesus, even when we walk through the valleys of life.\n\nPsalm 23 words:\n\n1 “The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing.\n\n2 He makes me lie down in green pastures,\n\nhe leads me beside quiet waters,\n\n3 he refreshes my soul.\n\nHe guides me along the right paths\n\nfor his name’s sake.\n\n4 Even though I walk\n\nthrough the darkest valley,[a]\n\nI will fear no evil,\n\nfor you are with me;\n\nyour rod and your staff,\n\nthey comfort me.\n\n5 You prepare a table before me\n\nin the presence of my enemies.\n\nYou anoint my head with oil;\n\nmy cup overflows.\n\n6 Surely your goodness and love will follow me\n\nall the days of my life,\n\nand I will dwell in the house of the Lord\n\nForever.”\n\nThis Psalm 23 Bible verse is taken from the NIV version of the Bible.\n\nJulius’ story, Psalm 23 and Compassion\n\nPsalm 23 is one of the most heartening psalms in times of difficulty and a firm Bible study favourite.\n\nWhen 10-year-old Julius’ world fell apart, the words of this psalm became a lifeline to him.\n\nHis story of survival in west Kenya is raw and shows how compassion for others and prayer has the power to change lives forever.\n\nAfter the sudden death of his mum, Julius was left homeless. As a vulnerable child, he was forced to live on the bustling streets of Luanda. Every day he would spend hours rummaging through rubbish heaps for scraps left by the local hotels.\n\nTerrified by the reality of street life, Julius was eventually persuaded to return to live with his elderly grandma.\n\nBut tragedy struck again.\n\n“As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death”\n\nJulius had only been in safety for a couple of weeks when his grandmother’s health deteriorated and Julius became her sole carer. His days were filled with chores including travelling to the nearest river to wash her clothes and bedsheets.\n\nJulius can clearly remember the moment his grandma’s eyes stopped moving. He called out to her, “Dani (grandmother), Dani, are you ok?”. But there was no answer, he told us.\n\nIn the middle of his struggle, Julius clung on to the words of Psalm 23. Every night he would lie on his bed and meditate on the psalm in his Holy Bible. Julius was comforted by the promise that God was with him through his valley of pain and grief. And whatever valley you’re going through, God can comfort you too.\n\n“I will fear no evil for you are with me”\n\nJulius was encouraged by the truths of Psalm 23. He knew that thanks to his Heavenly Father, he would “lack nothing”.\n\nAfter praying through the Psalm, Julius experienced the reality of God’s incredible provision. At his grandma’s funeral, Julius’ uncle Wellington offered to give him a home. “My heart was not at rest knowing that the children were left alone,” explains Wellington.\n\nBut Wellington and his wife were battling poverty. They had no idea how they were going to provide for the two boys in addition to their own five children.\n\nBut again God was faithful. He guided Julius along the right paths as the good shepherd does.\n\n“We received visitors from the local Compassion project who were seeking to help more needy children in the community,” remembers Wellington. “I prayed for Julius to be sponsored so that he could access the medical intervention he needed and start attending school.”\n\n“Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life”\n\nJulius was amazed that God’s goodness and love really did follow him. Thanks to his sponsor, Julius was able to join Ebusiralo Primary School. His Compassion sponsor provided everything he needed including food, education and support.\n\nI’m happy because my uncle took us in. I also enjoy visiting the [Compassion] project on Saturdays because I have many friends there,” he says. I receive gifts from my sponsor and my sponsor’s letters encourage me to work hard in everything I do. I feel loved and appreciated.\n\nEvery night Julius still goes to bed and reads the words of Psalm 23. He’s experienced their truth in powerful ways through the Holy Spirit. Julius knows he’s a child of God and that the Lord Jesus really is his shepherd.\n\nSponsor a child like Julius today\n\nWhat does Psalm 23 mean?\n\nby Maria Reyes, Programme Communications Manager, Compassion Bolivia\n\n“The meaning of Psalm 23 still amazes me. The famous King David describing himself as a sheep, a sheep that has a gentle and courageous shepherd who cares for it.\n\nDespite the sheep’s vulnerability, it is not afraid because its security is not in its own skills but in being near its shepherd, who keeps it safe.\n\nThis is a beautiful image of us receiving God’s tender love and care. He has forgiven us and filled us with love. As His children, He expects us to do the same with those in need, bringing His Kingdom to earth.\n\nJesus compared helping the poor with serving Him. The gospel of Matthew records Jesus’ description of the trial of nations, in which Jesus sits on His glorious throne to reward His people with their inheritance.\n\nIt is those who have offered drink to the thirsty, food to the hungry, a home to the stranger, clothing to the naked, or a visit to the sick or imprisoned who know Jesus and are called his “sheep”.\n\n“All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will put the sheep on his right.” —Matthew 25:32–33, NIV\n\nInspired by these insights and stories, we invite you to take time today to give thanks to God for the love and generosity He has shown us. Ask Him to give you His humility and sensitivity to show love and generosity to others every day.\n\nOne way you can show the love of God to the thirsty, the hungry and the stranger is by sponsoring a child with Compassion. Your sponsorship will provide a vulnerable child living in poverty with education, health care and the love of a local church.\n\nSponsor a child today\n\nInteresting facts about the 23rd Psalm\n\nPsalm 23 is one of the Psalms of David.\n\nIt’s often referred to as the Shepherd’s psalm. Psalm 23 portrays God as our good shepherd, feeding and leading his flock.\n\nThe 23rd Psalm is used to provide comfort to those in difficulty. It’s often used as a reading at funerals – it was even read at Whitney Houston’s memorial.\n\nIt’s not known exactly when the 23rd Psalm was written. Some believe it was written towards the end of David’s life.\n\nPsalm 23 may have been made popular by the 19th-century preacher Henry Ward Beecher. Henry described Psalm 23 as the nightingale of the psalms.\n\nPsalm 23 and popular culture\n\nPsalm 23 inspired Bach’s Cantata No. 208, “May Sheep Safely Graze”.\n\nIt’s been used in various films including The Wicker Man, The Elephant Man, Titanic and War Horse. In Titanic the priest reads Psalm 23 as the ship is sinking.\n\nThe words from this Psalm of David have been referenced in songs by Pink Floyd, U2, Jay Z, Coolio and Kanye West.\n\nCoolio’s song “Gangsta’s Paradise,” Tupac Shakur’s “So Many Tears” and Kanye West’s “Jesus Walks” all refer to “the valley of the shadow of death”.\n\nVariations of Psalm 23\n\nPsalm 23: The Message (MSG)\n\nA David Psalm\n\n23 1-3 God, my shepherd!\n\nI don’t need a thing.\n\nYou have bedded me down in lush meadows,\n\nyou find me quiet pools to drink from.\n\nTrue to your word,\n\nyou let me catch my breath\n\nand send me in the right direction.\n\n4 Even when the way goes through\n\nDeath Valley,\n\nI’m not afraid\n\nwhen you walk at my side.\n\nYour trusty shepherd’s crook\n\nmakes me feel secure.\n\n5 You serve me a six-course dinner\n\nright in front of my enemies.\n\nYou revive my drooping head;\n\nmy cup brims with blessing.\n\n6 Your beauty and love chase after me\n\nevery day of my life.\n\nI’m back home in the house of God\n\nfor the rest of my life.\n\nPsalm 23: New King James Version\n\n1 The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.\n\n2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.\n\n3 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.\n\n4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.\n\n5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.\n\n6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.\n\nPsalm 23 International Children’s Bible (ICB)\n\nThe Lord the Shepherd\n\nA song of David.\n\n23 The Lord is my shepherd.\n\nI have everything I need.\n\n2 He gives me rest in green pastures.\n\nHe leads me to calm water.\n\n3 He gives me new strength.\n\nFor the good of his name,\n\nhe leads me on paths that are right.\n\n4 Even if I walk\n\nthrough a very dark valley,\n\nI will not be afraid\n\nbecause you are with me.\n\nYour rod and your shepherd’s staff comfort me.\n\n5 You prepare a meal for me\n\nin front of my enemies.\n\nYou pour oil of blessing on my head.[a]\n\nYou give me more than I can hold.\n\n6 Surely your goodness and love will be with me\n\nall my life.\n\nAnd I will live in the house of the Lord forever\n\nAmen.\n\nWe hope this reflection has left you encouraged and rejoicing, saying ‘the Lord’s my shepherd!’ You may also be interested in:\n\n37 Encouraging Bible Verses to Inspire You with Hope and Strength\n\nBible Verses About Peace To Help During These Uncertain Times\n\nGod’s Promises: 50 Powerful Bible Promises To Build Your Faith\n\n40 Lent Bible Verses To Help You Reflect\n\nBible Verses About God’s Love"
