        "text": "In the Bible, we see many examples of dancing by God’s people as a reaction to the His goodness in their lives.\n\nAfter crossing through the Red Sea, Miriam sang a song of deliverance and led the Israelites in dancing to celebrate the victory God gave them over their enemies (Read Exodus 15 for the full story).\n\nKing David danced with all his might, celebrating the Ark of the Covenant, a symbol of God’s presence and glory, as it came into Jerusalem (2 Samuel 6:14-16).\n\nAnd in Psalm 30:11-12, the psalmist writes:\n\nYou have turned my mourning into joyful dancing.\n\nYou have taken away my clothes of mourning and clothed me with joy,\n\nthat I might sing praises to you and not be silent.\n\nO Lord my God, I will give you thanks forever!\n\nDancing is a natural expression of the excitement and consuming joy we feel when we lock into the truth that we have the victory over circumstances in our lives because Jesus paid a price for us. He came that we may have life, and have it to its fullness (John 10:10).\n\nWhen we are filled with the fullness of God, it has to express itself outward. I love David’s response to those who thought it was shameful for him to be dancing so wildly in front of everyone:\n\n“I was dancing before the Lord, who chose me … He appointed me as the leader of Israel, the people of the Lord, so I celebrate before the Lord. Yes, and I am willing to look even more foolish than this, even to be humiliated in my own eyes!“ (2 Samuel 6:21-22)\n\nThis is why I love the song “We Dance” (originally written by Steffany Gretzinger and Amanda Cook and featured on the new Bright Ones album, sung by Bright Ones featuring Josie Buchanan and Peyton Allen). The music just by itself will get you dancing wildly, but as you listen to the lyrics, you are drawn even more into celebrating His presence and glory like David did when the Ark of the Covenant entered his city.\n\nMeditate on these lyrics from “We Dance”:\n\nAnd I will lock eyes\n\nWith the One who’s ransomed me\n\nThe One who gave me joy for mourning\n\nAnd I will lock eyes\n\nWith the One who’s chosen me\n\nThe One who set my feet to dancing\n\nThink about those words right now. Then, ask yourself:\n\nWhat areas of my life has the Lord ransomed?\n\nWill I “lock eyes” with Him today and receive “joy for mourning”?\n\nWill I be willing to look foolish and undignified today and dance before the Lord to celebrate the victory in my life for which He paid?\n\nWatch the Official Lyric Video for Bright Ones’ “We Dance”:\n\nGet/listen to Bright Ones’ new album\n\nLearn more about Bright Ones\n\nBlog written by Fred Vassallo, choreographer and director of Bright Ones ministry."
