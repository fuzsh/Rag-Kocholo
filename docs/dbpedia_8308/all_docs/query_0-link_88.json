        "text": "Psalm 15:4 (NLT) says, “Those who despise flagrant sinners, and honour the faithful followers of the Lord, and keep their promises even when it hurts.”\n\nPsalm 15:4 tells me that a person who enters into Your presence, Lord, will despise flagrant sinners. Only You, however, are capable of sinless despising of someone, even while patiently loving them, so I am going to find this difficult. How am I, on the one hand, to love my neighbours and my enemies and yet despise flagrant sinners? You don’t make things easy, Lord.\n\nTESTER OF METALS\n\nIn Jeremiah 6:27-30 (NLT) God speaks to Jeremiah. He says, “Jeremiah, I have made you a TESTER OF METALS, that you may determine the quality of My people. They are the worst kind of rebel, full of slander. They are as hard as bronze and iron, and they lead others into corruption. The bellows fiercely fan the flames to burn out the corruption. But it does not purify them, for the wickedness remains. I will label them ‘Rejected Silver,’ for I, the Lord, am discarding them.”\n\nAm I also to be a tester of metals to determine the quality of the lives of those around me?\n\nIf so, I will need Your discernment, Lord.\n\nLOVE YOUR ENEMIES, DESPISE FLAGRANT SINNERS?\n\nMatthew 5:43-47 says, “You have heard the law that says, ‘Love your neighbour’ and hate your enemy. But I say, love your enemies! Pray for those who persecute you! In that way, you will be acting as true children of your Father in heaven. For He gives His sunlight to both the evil and the good, and He sends rain on the just and the unjust alike. If you love only those who love you, what reward is there for that? Even corrupt tax collectors do that much. If you are kind only to your friends, how are you different from anyone else? Even pagans do that….”\n\nHow do you love and despise at the same time?\n\nSPIRITUAL COVID\n\nThe word used of a flagrant sinner in Psalm 15:4 is נמאס nimas (one abandoned to sin); A person abandoned to sin is to be despised – נבזה Nibzeh. Nibzeh (despised) has the idea of regarding the person who is abandoned to sin as being contagious, as if that person was diseased with a deadly strain of Covid 19. This person may be rich, well educated, greatly honoured, or famous, but if they have Spiritual Covid 19, then they are infectious. The instruction here is to be masked against them and keep them isolated from you, and in that sense despise them.\n\nMORE THAN MEETS THE EYE\n\nBut I have a feeling there is more to this passage than meets the eye.\n\nWas David ruling out others from entering into the presence of God or was he the one who was having trouble living a blameless life, doing what was right, speaking the truth with a sincere heart. Was he tolerating and even admiring some flagrant sinners in his kingdom? Was he talking about how he was ruled out from dwelling in the presence of God?\n\nWas David saying that he could not dwell in the presence of God, not only because he wasn’t a priest, but because he had gossiped and harmed his neighbours and he spoke evil of his friends? Was he the one who failed to despise flagrant sinners, such as Joab?\n\nWas David confessing to God why he was not able to dwell in the presence of the Lord? Was this before or after David had an affair with Bathsheba and murdered her husband, Uriah? Was he admitting his failure to honour Uriah, a faithful follower of the Lord? Did he fail to keep his promises even when it hurts? Was David guilty of lending money and charging interest? Was he guilty of being bribed to lie about the innocent? Was he participating in these things or maybe simply complicit by tolerating these sins within his kingdom?\n\nPsalms 15:1-5 (NLT) says, “Who may worship in Your sanctuary, Lord? Who may enter Your presence on Your holy hill? Those who lead blameless lives and do what is right, speaking the truth from sincere hearts. Those who refuse to gossip or harm their neighbours or speak evil of their friends. Those who DESPISE FLAGRANT SINNERS, and honour the faithful followers of the Lord, and keep their promises even when it hurts. Those who lend money without charging interest, and who cannot be bribed to lie about the innocent. Such people will stand firm forever.” Was he saying – “Well, that rules me out”?\n\nEven the priests could not live in the Holy of Holies where the Ark of the Covenant rested, except for one day of the year and then by the blood of a sacrifice. David seems to be ruling out everyone from entering into God’s presence. He falls short! We all fall short! In the preceding Psalm, David has already said…\n\n“Only fools say in their hearts, “There is no God.” They are corrupt, and their actions are evil; not one of them does good! The Lord looks down from heaven on the entire human race; He looks to see if anyone is truly wise, if anyone seeks God. But no, all have turned away; all have become corrupt. No one does good, not a single one!” (Psalms 14:1-3 NLT).\n\nIt seems that Jesus is the only one who has ever lived who can climb the hill of God and dwell in God’s sanctuary.\n\nBut the amazing thing is that our trust in Him enables us to join Him.\n\nGod solves David’s problem by sacrifices and a priest to represent him and the nation before God. Our problem is solved by God sending Christ as our once and for all time sacrifice and high priest…\n\nRomans 5:10 (NLT) says, “for since our friendship with God was restored by the death of His son while we were still His enemies, we will certainly be saved through the life of His Son.”\n\nNotice we were once enemies of God. Even while we were enemies of God, His Son paid the ultimate sacrifice for us.\n\nThere was always a view towards reconciliation. When we were still God’s enemies Jesus died for us. We all fall short, yet God sent His only Son to die for our sins and enable us to enter into His presence on the basis that the price has been paid.\n\nYes, Christ-followers have access to God. We can live in His presence. Yet God also speaks to us who have already trusted in what Christ has done for us. Ephesians 5 God’s Words speaks of discernment and being careful to continue to rely on Him and live by His principles. Darkness is dispelled by Light. We are saved but we still need to be Testers of metal…\n\nCAREFULLY DETERMINE…\n\nEphesians 5:3-15 (NLT) says, “Let there be no sexual immorality, impurity, or greed among you. Such sins have no place among God’s people. Obscene stories, foolish talk, and coarse jokes—these are not for you. Instead, let there be thankfulness to God. You can be sure that no immoral, impure, or greedy person will inherit the Kingdom of Christ and of God. For a greedy person is an idolater, worshipping the things of this world.\n\nDon’t be fooled by those who try to excuse these sins, for the anger of God will fall on all who disobey Him. Don’t participate in the things these people do. For once you were full of darkness, but now you have light from the Lord. So live as people of light! For this light within you produces only what is good and right and true.\n\nCarefully determine what pleases the Lord. Take no part in the worthless deeds of evil and darkness; instead, expose them. It is shameful even to talk about the things that ungodly people do in secret. But their evil intentions will be exposed when the light shines on them, for the light makes everything visible. This is why it is said, “Awake, O sleeper, rise up from the dead, and Christ will give you light.” So be careful how you live. Don’t live like fools, but like those who are wise.”\n\nSTANDING FIRM\n\nPsalm 15:5 (NLT) ends with the words, “Such people will stand firm forever.”\n\n(NASB) “He who does these things will never be shaken” In Christ, we stand firm. In Christ, we also carefully determine what pleases the Lord.\n\nPastor Ross"
