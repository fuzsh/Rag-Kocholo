        "text": "Tonight, the Lord, your Shepherd, is with you, ready to guide you through His Word, ready to comfort you as you lie down to sleep. He knows you, He cares for you, and He loves you beyond compare. Picture yourself as one of His sheep looking to Him for protection and peace. Believe that He can and will give you everything you need to find rest tonight as you surrender to Him. Allow His voice to soothe your soul and guide you down a safe, secure path where you can find rest.\n\nPsalm 23 describes the Lord as your Shepherd. Tonight, lean on Him and depend on Him to provide you protection and peace as you sleep.\n\nThe LORD is my shepherd;\n\nI shall not want.\n\nHe makes me to lie down in green pastures;\n\nHe leads me beside the still waters.\n\nHe restores my soul;\n\nHe leads me in the paths of righteousness\n\nFor His nameâ€™s sake.\n\nYea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,\n\nI will fear no evil;\n\nFor You are with me;\n\nYour rod and Your staff, they comfort me.\n\nYou prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;\n\nYou anoint my head with oil;\n\nMy cup runs over.\n\nSurely goodness and mercy shall follow me\n\nall the days of my life;\n\nAnd I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.\n\nPSALM 23 NKJV\n\nADORATION: A shepherd is responsible for providing, guiding, and protecting their sheep. We can rest assured that Jesus-our good Shepherd-does all this and more. Worship Him now not just for what He does, but for who He is. Because of Him, we can dwell in peace knowing we are safe throughout the night.\n\nCONFESSION: Think about a time when you doubted the Lord's provision, guidance, and protection or were fearful. Ask for His forgiveness and put your trust in Him. Allow God's grace and love to be a comfort to you tonight.\n\nTHANKSGIVING: Rejoice in God's provision in your life. Think of all that He has given you and thank Him. Thank Him for the times He's comforted and cared for you.\n\nSUPPLICATION: Lord Jesus, thank You for how You've provided my needs, not just materially but emotionally and spiritually. Thank You for taking care of my needs even before I know I have a need. Guide me down safe paths and let me walk securely in You. Keep watch over me through this night and into a new day with You. In Your precious name, I pray. Amen."
