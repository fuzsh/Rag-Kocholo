THE sword is the belief that we must cut down our enemies to save ourselves; that we must rob our neighbors to insure our own plenty; that we must change our surroundings to be happy.

This belief and the practice prompted by it betrays our lack of trust in God as the only power, protection and supply, and causes us to forfeit the divine aid.

We cannot excuse our lack of demonstration under the plea of unfavorable surroundings, opposition, interference, lack of opportunities etc. No excuse will be accepted by all-wise Principle, who "preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies."
