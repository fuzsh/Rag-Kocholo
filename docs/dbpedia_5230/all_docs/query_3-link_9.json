Parallel ttraight lines.— When a straight line cuts two other straight lines, if (i) a pair of alternate angles arc equal, or (n) a pair of corresponding angles are equal, or (111) a pair of interior angles on the same side of the cutting lin* art together i-qual to two right angle,, then the two straight lines are parallel ; and the converse Straight lines which are parallel to the same ^traight Hue are parallel to one another. Trtangles and rectilinear figures — The sum of the angle-, of a triangle is equal to two right angles. If the sides of a convex polygon are produced in order, the sum of the angles so formed is equal to four right angles. If two triangles ha\\e two sides of the one equal to two sides of the other '•ach to each, anH also thd angles contained by thbYr tide* equal, th« triangles art congruent 36 THE ANDIIRA UNIVERSITY CODE—VOL. Ti [CHAP. XXXVIII If two triangles have two angles of the one equal to two angles of the other, each to each, and also one bide of the one equal to the corresponding side of the other, the triangles are congruent. If two sides of a triangle are equal, the angle oppo ite to these sides are equal ; and the converse. If two triangles have the three sider of the one equal to the three sides of the other, each to each, the triangles are congruent. If two right-angled triangles have their hypotenuses equal and one side of the one equal to one side of the other, the triangles are congruent If two sides of a triangle are unequal, the greater side has the greater angle opposite to it , and the converse. Of all the straight hues that can be drawn to a given straight line from a given point outside it, the perpendicular is the shortest The opposite sides and angles of a parallelogram are equal ; each diagonal bisects the parallelogram, and the diagonals bisect one another. If there are three or more parallel straigh lines, and the intercepts made by them on any straight line that cuts them are equal, then the intercepts made by them on any other straight line that cuts them are also equal. Areas.— Parallelograms of the same altitude on the same or equal bases are equal in area. Triangles of the same altitude on the same or equal bases are equal in area. Equal triangles on the same or equal bases are of the same altitude Illustrations and explanations of the geometrical theorems corresponding to th» following algebraical identities • — /I (a The square on a side of a triangle is greater than, equal to or less than the sum of the squares on the other two sides, according as the angles contained by those sides are obtuse, right or acute The difference in the cases of inequality it twice the rectangle contained by ont of the two sides and the projection on it of the otker . — Th* lotus of a point which is equidistant from fcwo nxe-d poiats h tfc* *»rpladifeuUr bliwttof of the straight line joining the hro fixt'd points . GEOMETBY] MATRICULATION EXAMINATION 37 The locus of a point which is equidistant from two intersecting straight lines consists of the pair of straight line which bisect the angles betu een the given lines. The locus ot the vertices of all triangles which have the same base and the sum of squares of their udes equal to a gi\\pn quare is a circle having its centre at the middle of the base The locu^ of the vertices of all thr triangles which have the same base and the difference of the ,quares of their side^ equal to a given square is a straight line perpendicular to the base The locus of the vertices of all the trafngles which ha\\e the same base and their vertical angles equal to a given angle is the arc of a segment of a Circle. TheCiicle - A straight line drawn from the centre of a circle to bisect a chord winch is not a diimetei, i^ at right angles to the chord ; conversely, the perpendicular to a chord fiom the centre bisect^ the chord There is one circle and one only, which parses through three given points not in a straight line In equal circles (or, in the same circle) (i) if two arcs subtend equal angles at the centres, they are equal ; (li) conversely, if two arcs are equal they subtend equal angles at the centre , In equal circles (or, in the same circle) (i) if two chords are equal, they cut off equal ar<'s , (ii) conversely, if two arcs are equal, the chords of the arcs are equal. Equal chords of a circle are equidistant from the centre , and the converse. The tangent at any point of a circle and th« rtdius through the point art perpendicular to one another If two circles touch, the point of contact lies on the straight line through the centres. The angles which an arc of a circle subtends at the centre is double that which it subtends at any point on the remaining part of the circumference. Angles in the same segment of a circle are equal , and if the line joining two points subtends equal angles at two other points on the same side of it, the four points he on a cm le The angle in a semi-circle is a right angle , the angle in a segment grtater than a semi»circle is less than a right angle ; and the an fie in a segment less than a semi-circle is greater than a right angle. 38 THE ANDHRA UNIVERSITY CODE!— VOL. It [CHAP. TXXVltt The opposite ang f s of any quadrilateral inscribed in a circle are supple- mentary; and the con ffse If a straight lino touches a circle, and from the point of contact a chord be drawn the angles wh h the chord m^kes with the tangent are equal to the angles in the alternate iigments If two chords of a circle intersect either inside or outside the circle, the rectangle contained by the segments of the one is equal to the rectangle contained by the other and the converse. Ratio and Propo'tion — (a) Definition and elementary theorems connecting the antecedents and con icquents. A given straight line can be divided internally in a given ratio at one and only one point and exteinally at one and only one point. A straight line drawn parallrl to one side of a triangle cuts the other two side^ or those side1* produced, proportionally ; and the converge If the vertical angle of a triangle is bisected inteinally or externally th« bisector divides the base internally or externally into segments which have the same ratio as the other sides of the triangle ; and the converse. In equal circles, angles, whether at the centres or circumferences, have the same ratio as the arcs on which they stand. If two triangles have ono angle of the one equal to one angle of the other their areas are proportional to the rectangles contained by the sides about the equal angles Similarly for parallelograms having one angle of the ono equal to one angle of the other. Simitar Triangles. — If two tramgles are equiangular, then their corres- ponding sides are proportional ; and the converse. Two traingles, which have one angle of the one equal to ont angle of tjie other and the sides about these equal angles proportional, are similar. The area> of similar triangles are in the ratio of the squares of th« corresponding sides 2.
