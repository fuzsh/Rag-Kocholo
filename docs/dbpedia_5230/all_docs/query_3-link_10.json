Men and women who read it in a college course continue to refer to it, and new admirers come to it every day. The reasons for its popularity are manifold: it is clearly and forcefully written, it covers the whole history of the West in relatively brief compass, and it presents an excellent balance between narrative and analysis. The text also gained readers because it was conceived from the start as a history of ciinliziitions rather than a chronicle of events. Professor Burns covered political history fully, but he believed that “the effects of the Black Death were no less important than the Hundred Years’ War, and that, in the long run, the teachings of Aristo- tle and the Stoics transcended in significance the rise of the Bourbons or the decline of the Holy Roman Empire.” Accordingly Westerfi (Viri- lizations has always laid great stress on the development of ideas and institutions. With Professor Burns’s death in 1972, it was imperative that the careful balance he had struck be preserved by the authors chosen to succeed him. In accepting the assignment to revise such an excellent textbook we had no doubts whatsoever that we wished to retain its basic physi- ognomy. But the expansion of historical research over previously neglected subject matters as well as the progress of research in more traditional areas have accomplished so much in recent years that we have found it necessary to revise substantial portions of the text. 'Throughout we have paid much more attention to the history of women and minorities than before, but since the text already devoted a good deal of space to social history we did not have to accomplish this at the expense of political or intellectual coverage. Although we pride ourselves in keeping the length of the book roughly the same as it was before by dint of editorial admonition and heroic self-restraint, we have also made numerous changes in organizational strategies and interpretative schemes, with the greatest ainount of revision falling in the medieval period and the nineteenth century. In the earliest parts of the book (chapters 1-8) the major changes have been to summarize the most recent findings concerning pre- historic peoples, to consider the relations between Minoan and My- cenaean civilizations on the basis ot new insights provided by the decipherment of Linear B, and generally to alter the chronology to conform to the findings of the most recent research. More fundamen- tal changes have been made in the late-Roman and medieval coverage, resulting in five substantially new chapters (^>-13). Instead of treating Roman history after Diocletian as part of Roman civih/ation proper, the present edition follows recent approaches by devoting a ( hapter to the “world of late antiquity” from the time of Diocletian to the end of the sixth century. Chapter 10 treats the three heirs of Rome — Byzantium, Islam, and the early-medieval Christian West — from a comparative perspective. Replacing the chronological division ot the Middle Ages into two periods — early (500-1050) and late (1050- 1350) — the present volume follows the more conventional sdienu of dividing the Middle Ages into early (500-10.50), high (10.50-1300) and late (1300-1500) periods. Two chapters (1 1 and 12) are deviated to the High Middle Ages. These are almost chronologically co-extensive with the two chapters on what was previously called the late Middle Ages, but they introduce new subjects, such as the dynamic pn^gress of medieval agriculture and the rise and fall t)f papal monarchy, as well as differences in descriptive vocabularies and interpretation. A tlill chapter on the later Middle Ages has no equivalent in the previous edition although this chapter does incorporate some of the subject matter that was included under the heading of the Renaissance. Shil t- ing some of the Renaissance material made it possible to have a single chapter on the Renaissance as a whole instead of the previous two on the Renaissance in Italy and the Renaissance beyond Italy. I he Refor- mation chapter (15) is largely unchanged, the Commercial Revolution chapter (16) adds the results of research on the agricultural revolution of the eighteenth century (the witchcraft material being removed to chapter 18), and the Ab.solutism chapter (17) introduces treatment of England from the CJlorioiis Revolution to the reign of Cleorge 111. In revising chapters 19 through 26 we have attempted to unify the analysis of nineteenth-century western civilization around three major themes: 1) the manner in which both the French and Industrial Revo- lutions combined to produce the dramatic changes that occurred dur- ing that period; 2) the importance of class consciousness — a major factor in both of those revolutions — to an understanding of the period; and 3) the need to know more about the everyday life of men and women from all classes who experienced the changes described. Throughout w’c have relied heavily on recent scholarship that has taken these themes as it subject. In order to treat the legacies of the French revolution more coher- ently, material on Napoleon has been moved to Chapter 19. The In- dustrial Revolution is now discussed in two chapters. The first (20) includes expanded sections on Kuropean industrialization and the rail- way age; the second (24) deals with the technological changes that characterized the so-called “second\" industrial revolution and with the effect of those changes in human terms. Chapters 21, 22, and 23 outline the manner in which the two revolutions altered the course of history. T hese chapters differ from the previous edition by attempting to define and describe class consciousness; by summarizing recent scholarly findings on the subjects of agricultural change and the stan- dard of living; by stressing the connections between romanticism and nationalism and between nationalism and nation-building; by present- ing liberalism as the characteristic political credo of the industrial middle class; and by describing in some detail the lives of men — and women — in middle and working-class homes and neighborhoods. Material on the various challenges to the industrial middle class has been concentrated in C!hapters 21, 23, and 26. T he remaining chapters (27-31), though in some parts extensively revised, retain the same general organizational outline employed in the Eighth Edition. T he most significant alterations occur in Chapter 2S, where material on interwar culture has been added, and in the last two chapters, where problems and trends of the post- World War II period have been re- organized and up-dated in a way that we hope makes sense of a constantly changing and very complex set of world conditions and movements. In conjunction with the textual revisions the map and illustration programs have received serious attention. Most of the nearly fifty maps are either new or thoroughly amended. Virtually sixty percent of the seven hundred illustrations are new to this edition, having been culled from a wide range of European and American archives. The text was the first to include color illustrations and continues to include far more color plates than any other book in the field. T he new edi- tion, like its predecessors, has been brought out in a one-volume and a two- volume edition. Available for use with either is an entirely new Instructor s Manual and a revised Study Guide, whose most distinc- tive feature is the inclusion of numerous extracts from original and secondary sources. Robert Lerner has had primary responsibility for the first half of the revision (inclusive of chapter 17) and Standish Meacham for the second half Invaluable suggestions for improving the chapters on ancient history were made by Kenneth Sacks and (leorge Szemler. Among the numerous experts who cheerfully submitted to bombard- ments of questioning were T. W Heyck, David Joravsky, E. William Monter, James E. Packer, C-arl Fetry, and Susan Solway Helen Feng, Hrdmut Lerner, Oscar Lerner, Vita Maniscalco, James Murray, and Richard Wells provided extremely helpful aid in critical reading and research. At W. W. Norton & Company Ruth Mandcl has been an expert picture-gatherer, Ben Ciainit a superb make-up artist, and Robert E. Kehoe and Donald S. Lamm gracious and savvy producers. Michelle Cliff, our editor, counts not just as our chastizing angel but as our collaborator: to her we owe the greatest of our debts. Robert E.

'I'Uere is evidetite, howerer, that it may have heeti south-central Africa or possihly central or south-central Asia.

I-or hundreds of centuries they remained primitive, leading a life which was at first barely more advanced than that of the hijiflur animals. .About li.c., a few of them, enjoyinji special advantages of location and climate, slowly developed supirior civilizations. These civilizations, which attained knowledge of writing and lonsiderable advancement in the arts and sciences and in social organization, began in that part of the world known as the Near Hast. This region extends from modern-day Iran to the Meditirra- nean Sea and to the farther hank of the Nile. Here flourished, at different periods between jooo and ^oo H.C., the mighty empires of the llgyptians, the Babylonians, the A.ssyrians, the (Chaldeans, and the Persians, together with the smaller states c*f such peoples as the Hittites, the Phoenicians, and the Hebrews. The only other very early civilization existed in India in the area of the Indus valley from about 2300 to t^oo B.C. The earliest signs of civilization in China date from about 1800 li.c., and the earlie.st civiliza- tions in Europe — on the island of Crete and mainland (itvece — similarly date from around that time.

The quarrels of popes and kings, with wars or pestilences in every page; the men all so good for nothing, and hardly any women at all, it is very tiresome.” Although Jane Austen’s heroine said this around iSoo, she might have lodged the same complaint until ejuite recently, for until deep into the twen- tieth century most historians considered history to be little more than “past politics” — and a dry chronicle of past politics at that. The con- tent of history was restricted primarily to battles and treatie's, the per- sonalities and politie's c^f statesmen, the laws and dee re'es of rulcTs. But important as such data are, they by no mcMns ce^nstitute the whole substance of histe^ry. Fispevially within the last few decades historians have come to recognize that history comprises a record of past human activities in every sphere — not just political developments, but also social, economic, and intellectual one's. Women as wcil as me'ii, the ruled as weil as the rulers, the poor as well as the rich, are part of his- Hi\\tory nioiv ihiiti htittlcs will/ niiitir^ 4 rhe Uarlivst Si'if historiiiil methods Sii t ssity for >/udyin\\; post ON its oirn trmis tory. So too arc the social and economic institutions that mem and women have created and that in turn have shaped their lives: fiimily and social class; manorialism and city life; capitalism and indus- trialism. Ideas and attitudes too, not just of intellectuals but also of men and women whose lives may have been virtually untouched by “great books,” are all part of the historian's concern. And, most im- portant, history includes an inquiry int(^ the causes of events and pat- terns of human organization and ideas — a search for the forces that im- pelletl humanity toward its great undertakings, and the reasons for its sill c esses and failures. As historians have extended the compass of their work, they have also equipped themselves with new methods and tools, the better to practice their craft. No longer do historians merely pore over the same old chriMiicles and doaiments to ask whether Charles the Fat was at Ingelheim or Lustnau on July i , SS7. To introduce the evidence of sta- tistics they learn the methods of the cimiputer scientist. To interpret the effect of a rise in the cost of living, they study economics, fo deduc e marriage patterns or evaluate the effect upon an entire popula- tion of* wars and plagues, they master the skills of the demographer. To explore the phenomena of cave-dw'elling or modem urbanization, they bec'ome archeologists, studying fossil remains, fragments of pots, or modern city landscapes. To understand the motives of the men and women w4io have made history, they draw on the insights of social psychologists and adtural anthrc^pologists. To illuminate the lives of' the poor and of those w4io have left few written records, they look for other ailtural remains — folk songs, for example, and the traditions embodied in oral history. Perhaps the most important lesson historians have learned is that they must no longer coiuiescend to the past, no longer assume that their c ivilization is worthier than those that have come before. History is primarily the stiuiy of change over time, but that does not mean that it is a tale of uninterrupted progress from past to present or that all change was ordained to produce our own modern world. I'hose who write history and those who study it must li^ok to see how one event led to another and how the entire past is prologue to the present, but they must also appreciate the past on its own terms, examining it, so far as possible, through the eyes and with the minds of those who lived it. 2. HISTORY AND PREHISTORY It is the custom among many historians to distinguish between his- Thr yo-iitlh’d prehistoru toric and prehistoric periods in the evolution of human society. By the former they mean history based upon written records. By the latter they mean the record c^f human achievement before the invention of writing. But this distinction is not altogether satisfactory. It suggests that human accomplishments before they were recorded in characters or symbols representing words or concepts were not important. Nothing could be farther from the truth. The foundations, at least, of many of the great accomplishments of modem technology, and even of social and political systems, were laid before human beings could write a word. It is preferable, therefore, that the whole period of human life on earth be regarded as historic, and that the era before the invention of writing be designated by a term such as “preliterate.” T he records of preliterate societies are, of course, not books and docu- ments, but tools, weapons, fossils, utensils, carvings, paintings, and fragments of jewelry and ornamentation. These, commonly known as “artifacts,” are often almost as valuable as the written word in provid- ing knowledge of a people’s deeds and modes of living. Tl:e entire span of human history can be divided roughly into two periods, the Age of Stone and the Age of Metals. The former is roughly coterminous with the Preliterate Age, or the period before the invention of writing. The latter coincides roughly with the period of history based upon written records. The Preliterate Age covered all but the smallest fraction of humanity’s existence and did not come to an end until about 3500 h.( ., although some Stone Age cultures per- sisted after that time and a few tribes still exist in remote areas. The Age of Metals practically coincides with the history of civilized na- tions. The Age of Stone is subdivided into the Paleolithic, or Old Stone Age, and the Neolithic, or New Stone Age. Each takes its name from the type of stone tools and weapons characteristically manufac- tured during the period. Thus during the greater part of the Paleolithic Age implements were commonly made by chipping pieces off a large stone or flint and using the core that remained as a hand ax or “fist hatchet.” Toward the end of the period the chips themselves were used as knives or spearheads, and the core thrown away. The Neo- lithic Age witnessed the supplanting of chipped stone tools by imple- ments made by grinding and polishing stone. 3. TF-IE CULTURE OF THE EARLIER PALEOLITHIC PEOPLES The Paleolithic period can be dated from roughly 2,000,000 b.c:. to 10,000 B.c. It is commonly divided into two stages, an earlier and a later one. The earlier Paleolithic period was vastly the longer of the two, covering about 99 percent of the entire Old Stone Age. During this time at least four species of humanlike creatures inhabited the earth. Momentous discoveries pertaining to the earliest of these have been made very recently by scientific teams working in East Africa. In 1961, the anthropologist Jonathan Leakey uncovered in Tanzania parts Thv ('ulturi' ofiht' Ihirlicr Piilcolithii Pcophs I’ist Hatchet Homo habilis The Skt4ll (left) of a Youtii^ IWvmw of the Species Homo luihilis, believed to have lived in lanzania.

Though Homo hahilis was smaller than a pygmy, the brain casing was shaped like that ol' modern humans. of a skull that was about i.S million years old, far older than any humanlike skull previously known, (('hemical tests such as the carbon- 1 4 method or the potassium-argon method are used in deter- mining the age of the geological strata in which bones are found aiul sometimes the age of the bones themselves.) Then, in i<>72, a team led by Jonathan’s brother Richard discovered in Kenya a similar and nearly complete skull that was more than 2 million years old. The species which left behind these remains has been named Homo hahilis, or “man having ability.” Homo hahilis may be cinmted as a true ances- tor of modern man because he walked erect, possessed a brain that was larger than that of any apes, and was intelligent enougli to use tools. Of course, his tools were extremely primitive. Eor the most part they consisted of objects taken from nature: bones of animals, limbs from trees, and chunks of stone, perhaps broken or crudely chipped. But they allowed Homo habilh to .survive in times of food shortage as a hunter rather than as a food gatherer or forager. It must not be thought that reliance on hunting led these earliest ancestors to kill each other. C^uite to the contrary, their survival depended upon coopera- tion. Most likely only after the development of agriculture and herding — more than a million years later — did humans start warring with each other for the possession of territory. The cooperation nece.s- sary in hunting made Howe habilis the first truly .social creature and led toward the use of language. Homo habilis was, therefore, clearly in the vanguard of the human race. Java Matt Two subsequent inhabitants of the earlier Paleolithic period were Java man and Peking man. Java man w^as long thought to be the oldest of humanlike creatures, but it is now generally agreed that the date of his origin was about 500,000 His skeletal remains w ere ftnind on the island of Java in iSoi. The remains of Peking man w^ere found in China, about forty miles southwest of Peking between 1^26 and Since the latter date, fragments of no few^'r than thirty-two skeletons of the Peking type have been located, making possible a complete reconstruction of at least the head of this ancient species. Anthropol- ogists generally agree that Peking man and Java man are of appro.xi- mately the same antiquity, and that both probably descended from the same ancestral type. During the last 25,000 years t^f the earlier Paleolithic period a fourth species of ancient man made an appearance. He was Neanderthal man, famous as an early caveman. Although first discovered a few' years earlier at Gibraltar, Neanderthal man is named after a find of skeletal fragmaits in 1S56 in the valley of the Neander, near Diisseldorf, in nortlnvestern (iermany. Since them numerous other discoveries have been made, in some cases complete skeletons, in such widely sepa- rated regions as Belgium, Spain, Italy. Yugoslavia, Russia, and Israel. So closely did Neanderthal man resemble modem man that he is clas- sified as a member of the same species. Homo sapiens. The resem- blance, however, was by no means perfect. Neanderthalers, on the average, w'ere only about five feet, four inchc*s in height. They had receding chins and heavy eyebrow ridges. Although their foreheads sloped back and their brain cases were low-vaulted, their average cra- nial capacity was slightly greater than that of modern (Caucasians. What this may have signified w ith rc*spect to their intelligence cannot be determined. The know'ledge we possess c^f the culture of earlier Paleolithic peev pies is scanty. The skills they achieved and the learning they acquired must have been pitiful in quantity even when compared with the ac- complishments of modern primitive groups. Yet Neanderthal man and his successors were not mere apes, forgetting in a moment the chance triumphs they had made. They undcnibtedly had the capacity for speech, which enabled them to communicate with their fellows and to pass on w'hat they hacl learned to succeeding generations. The Neanderthalers had some ability to think in the abstract, as evidenced by their burial of their dead with objects intended for use in an af- terlife. They also progressed beyond Homo hahilis by fashioning their own tools instead of just using the ones they found. They discovered that stones could be chipped in such a way as to give them cutting edges. Thus were developed spearheads, borers, and much superior knives and scrapers. Indications have been found also of a degree of advancernc'nt in nonmaterial culture. In the entrances to caves where Neanderthalers lived, or at least took refuge, evidence has been di.s- covered of flint-w'orking floors and stone hearths where huge fires ap- 7 Thf ('ultiitr of flic l-iirltcr l\\ilcoitthii People:^ Scatiderfhal Man Min^ Man Ai fomplishmcfits of earlier Paleolithic peoples The Fiarlicst Cyo-Ma^non Man Later Paleolithu l-'ishhook pear to have been made. These would suggest the origins of coopera- tive group life and po.ssibly the crude beginnings of social institutions. 4. LATHR faleolithk: c:ulture About 30,000 B.c. the culture of the Old Stone Age passed to the later Paleolithic stage. TTiis period lasted for only about two hundred cen- turies, or from 30,000 to 10,000 B.c:. A new and superior type of human being dominated the earth in this time. Biologically these peo- ples w'ere closely related to modern humans. Their foremost predeces- sors, Neanderthal men, had ceased to exist as a distinct variety. What became of the Neanderthal ers is not known. rhe name used to designate the prevailing breed of later Paleolithic humans is Oo-Magnon, from the C!ro-Magnon cave in southern France where some of the most typical remains were discovered. These people lived by hunting reindeer, bison, and mammoths, which freely roamed through southern Europe and Asia because the climate, dominated by glaciers, w-as very cold. The Crtv-Magnon people were tall, broad-shouldered, and walked erect, the males averaging over six feet. They had high foreheads, w' ell-developed chins, and a cranial ca- pacity about equal to the modern average. 7 'he heavy eyebrows so typical of earlier species were absent. Wliether Cro-Magnon men left any survivors is a debatable question. Iliey do not seem to have been exterminated but appear to have been driven into mountainous regions and to have been ultimately absorbed into other breeds. Later Paleolithic culture was markedly more advanced than that which had gone before. Not only were tools and implements better made, they existed in greater variety. They were not fashioned merely from flakes of stone and an occasional shaft of bone; other materials W'ere used in abundance, particularly reindeer horn and ivory. Ex- amples of the more complicated tools included the fishhook, the har- poon, the dart-throwxT, and, at the very end, the bow and arrow. That later Paleolithic people w ore clothing is indicated by the fact that they invented the needle (made out of bone). They did not know how to weave cloth, but animal skins sew'n together proved a satisfactory substitute. It is certain that they cooked their food, for enormous hearths, evidently used for roasting meat, have been discovered. In the vicinity of one at Solutre, in southern France, was a mass of charred bones, estimated to contain the remains of a hundred thousand large animals. Although Cro-Magnon people built no houses, except a few simple huts in regions where natural shelters did not abound, ^their life was not wholly nomadic. Evidence found in caves that served as homes indicate that they must have been used, seasonally at least, for years at a time. With respect to noiimaterial elements there are also indications that later Paleolithic culture represented a marked advancement, (iroup life was now more highly organized than ever before. The profusion of 9 charred bones at Solutre and elsewhere probably indicates cooperative / Rilcohthn (Atltun' enterprise in the hunt and sharing of the results in community feasts. The amazing workmanship displayed in tools and weapons and highly developed techniques in the arts ci>uld scarcely have been achieved without some division of labor. It appears certain, therefore, that later l^deolithic communities included professional artists and skilled craftsmen. In order to acquire such talents, certain members ot the communities must have gone through long periods of training and given all their time to the practice of their specialties. Substantial proof exists that the Oo-Magnons had highly devel- oped notions of a world with supeniatural aspects. They bestowetl more care upon the bodies of the dead than did the Neanderthalers, SYinfMthciu painting the corpses, folding the arms mer the heart, and depositing pendants, necklaces, and richly carved weapons in the graves. The CTo-Magnons also formulated an elaborate system of sympathetic magic designed to increase their food supply. Sympathetic magic is based upon the principle that imitating a desired result will bring about that result. Applying this principle, (>o-Magnon people Later Paleolithic [zti^^raritijii atid Sculpture. The two objects at the top and upper right are dart- throwers.

At other times they fashioned clay models of the bison or mammoth and mutilated them with dart thrusts. The purpose of such representation was probably to facilitate the results portrayed and thereby to increase the hunter’s success and make easier the struggle for existaii e. Possibly incantations or cere- monies accompanied the making of these pictures or images, and it is likely that the work of producing them was carried on w'hile the actual hunt was in progress. In fact, the supreme achievement of the Oo-Magnon people was their art — an achicvernait so original and resplendent that it ought to be counted among the Seven Wt)nders of the World. Nothing else il- lustrates so well the great gulf between their culture and that of their predecessors. Later Paleolithic art included nearly every branch that the material culture of the time made po.ssible. Sculpture, painting, and carving were all represeiUed. I’he ceramic arts and architecture were lacking; pottery had not yet been irjvented; and the only build- ings erected were of simple design. The CrevMagnon art par ex- cellence was cave painting. On cave wmIIs were e.xhibited the greatest number and variety of their talents — their discrimination in the use of color, their meticulous attention to detail, their capacity for the em- ployment of scale in depicting a group, and above all, their genius for imitating natural detail. Hspecially noteworthy vvas their skill in repre- senting movement. Almost all of the murals depict animals run- ning, leaping, chewing their cud, or facing the hunter at bay. Ingen- ious devices were often employed to give the impression of motion. C'hief among them was the drawing or painting of additional outlines to indicate the areas in w hich the legs or the head of the animal had moved. The scheme was so shrewdly executed that no appearance whatever of artificiality resulted. Clave painting throws a flood of light on many problems relating to primitive mentality and folkways. I’o a certain extent it was undoubt- edly an expression of a true aesthetic sense. (Iro-Magixni people did obviously take some delight in a graceful line or symmetrical pattern or brilliant color. The fact that they painted and tattooed their bodies and w'ore ornaments gives evidcnice of this. But their chief w'orks of art can scarcely have been produced for the sake of creating beautiful objects. Such a possibility must be excluded for several reasons. To begin w^ith, the best of the paintings and drawings are u.sually to be found on the w'alls and ceilings of the darkest and most inaccessible parts of the cavc*s. The gallery of paintings at Niaux, for instance, is more than half a mile from the entrance of the cave. No one could see the artists’ creations except in the imperfect light of torches or primi- tive lamps, which must have smoked and sputtered badly, for the only illuminating fluid available w'as animal fat. Furthermore, there is evi- dence that CrtvMagnon people w'ere largely indifferent to their (Mir Dniwinifs tU LiiMaux, irMiic On tin* loft aic charai tiTistK cxajnpk*s tU the realism of'C^ro-Ma^non art. (')n the right, a view ot'llu enttaiue it) the eaves nuirals after they vN’ere finished. Numerous examples have been found of paintings or drawings superimposed upon earlier ones of the same or of different types. Evidently the important thing was not the fin- ished work itself, but the act tif making it. The real purpose of nearly all of later Paleolithic art was apparently not to delight the senses but to increase the supply of animals useful for fot)d. Ilie artist was not an aesthete but a magician, and art was a form of magic designed to promote the hunter’s success. In this pur- pose lay its chief significance and the foundation of most of its special qualities. It suggests, for e.xample, the real reason why game animals were almost the exclusive subjects of the great murals and why plant life and inanimate objects were seldom reprc'sented. It aids us in un- derstanding the Otv-Magnons’ neglect of finished paintings and the predominant interest in the process of making them. The placing of tin- art in the most inaccessible part of the cave is further proof of a re- ligious motivation on the part of the artist — ^the art then becomes secreted in a sacred place. Later Paleolithic culture ended around 10,000 b . c . because of a dis- appearance of the food supply. As the last glacier retreated farther and farther north, the climate of southern Europe became too warm for the reindeer, and they gradually migrated to the shores of the Baltic. /\\rr Ml iiii/ III till foi iwi^inin J ill' cmJ oj liiti'i I\\jIi'oIiiIiu I ultim' 12 77 /f liarticst liriiinninfifs 77n’ tm’afiw\\! of tliv tmn Nt'olirhk Tlu’ Vitryiu^ daftw of fitr Svolithii 77;c Si’oUthk rcrolutioti The mammoth, whether for the same or for different reasons, became extinct.

NEOLfrUIC CULTURE From roughly 10,000 b.c. to roughly 50<^X) H.c:., varying very much according to location, ensued the Mesolithic, or Middle Sterne Age. This w'as a transitional period in which peoples became more seden- tary and found new sources of food, such as shellfish and edible grasses, now that most of the world was freed from ice. The Meso- lithic stage was succeeded by the Nec^lithic, or New Stone Age. This name is applied because stone w'eapons and tools were now generally made by grinding and polishing instead of by chipping or fracturing as in the preceding pericxis. The hearers of Neolithic culture were new varietic's of modern peoples who poured into Africa and sc^uthern Europe from western Asia. Since no evidence exists of their later ex- terminaticni or w'holesale migration, they must be regarded as the im- mediate ancestors of nicest of the peoples now living in Europe. It is impossible to fix exact dates for the Neolithic period because different peoples passed through the Neolithic stage of development at different rates in different areas. Exciting recent archeological discov- eries on the west bank of the Jordan River give evidence of Neolithic settlements in their earliest forms around 7500 h.(\\ Fully developed Neolithic culture existed in Mesopotamia and Egypt by 5000 b.c., but the culture was not well established in Europe until about 3000 icc. There is also variation in the dates of its ending. It was superseded in Mesopotamia and Egypt by the first literate civilizations around 3>oo B.c., but except on the island of Crete it did not come to an end any- where in Europe before 2000, and in northern Europe much later still. In a few regions of the w'orld it has not terminated yet. T he peoples of some islands of the Pacific, the Arctic regions of North America, and the jungles of Brazil are still in the Neolithic culture stage except for a few customs acquired from explorers and missionaries. In many respects the New Stone Age was the most significant in the history of the world thus far. The level of material progress rose to new heights. Neolithic peoples had a better mastery of their environ- ment than any of their predecessors. They were less likely to perish from a shift in climatic conditions or from the failure of some part of their food supply. This decided advantage was the result primarily of the development of agriculture and the domestication of animals. Whereas all of the peoples who had lived heretofore were mere food- gatherers, Neolithic peoples food-producers. Tilling the soil and keeping flocks and herds provided them with much more dependable food resources and at times even yielded them a surplus. The develop)- nicnt of agriculture, one of the most important of all transitions in human history, promoted a settled existence and made possible an increase in population. Such were the elements of a great social and economic revolution whose importance it would be impossible to ex- aggerate. rhe new culture also derives significance from the fact that it was the first to be distributed over the entire world. Although some earlier cultures, especially those of the Neanderthal ers and Oo-Magnons. were widely dispersed, they were confined chiefly to the accessible mainland areas of the Old World. Neolithic culture penetrated into every habitable area of the earth’s surface\" — friim Arctic wastes to the jungles of the tropics. Neolithic peoples apparently made their way from a number t)f emters of (Origin to every nook and cranny of both hemispheres. They traveled enormous distances by water as well as by land, and eventually ocaipied every major island of the oceans, no matter how remote. Migration over long distances was not the only example of Neo- lithic achievements. Neolithic peoples developed the arts of knitting and weaving. They made the first pottery and knew how to produce fire by friction. They built houses of wood and sun-dried mud. To- ward the end of the periixl they discovered the possibilities of metals, and a few implements of copper and gold were added to their stock. Since nothing was yet known of the arts of smelting and refining, the use of metals was limited to the more malleable ones occasionally found in the pure state in the form of nuggets. 13 ('ultuir TIu wide diJtuS'U'tu •>/ tin Scolithii iiilnnr \\CU^ iltld fl JlUlull shill, Actieitics AronriJ a Seolithii Dwellitij^.

Neolithic peoples would logically turn their attentic^n to otluT animals, especially those usc‘d for food. Before the period c'nded, at least five species — the cow, the dc^g, the goat, the sheep, and the pig — had been made to serve tlu*ir needs. Idle exact spot where agric ulture originated has never been deter- mined. All we know is that wild grasses which were probably the an- c estors of the cereal grains have been found in a number of place's. 1 ypes of w'heat grt>w wiki in the Near Ha.st and southern Ru.ssia. Wild ancestors of barley have been reported in North Africa, the Nc-ar hast, and central Asia. Though it is probable that thc-se wctc the first crops of Neolithic agriculture, they were by no means the only ones. Millet, vegetables, and numerous fruits were also grow'n. Flax was cultivated in the hastern Hemisphere for its textile fiber, and in some localities the growing of the poppy lor opium had already begun. In the West- ern Hemisphere maize (Indian cc'jrn) wms the only cereal, but the American Indians cultivated numerous other cTops, including to- bacco, beans, sc^uashes, tomatoes, and potatoes. The most important consequence of Neolithic settled life was the development of lasting institutions. An institution may be defined as a combination of group beliefs and activities organized in a relatively permanent fashion for the purpose of fulfilling some group need. It ordinarily includes a body of customs and traditions, a code of rule's and standards, and physical extensions such as buildings, punitive devices, and facilities for communication and indoctrination. Since humans are social bc'ings, some of the.se elements probably e xisted from earlie.st times, but instiuitions in their fully developed form seem to have been an achievement of the Neolithic Age. One of the most ancient of human institutions is the family. Sociol- ogists do not agree upon how- it should be defined. Historically, how- ever, the family has always meant a more or less permanent unit com- posed of parents and theii ofl'spring, which serves the purposes of care of the young, division of labc^r, acquisition and transmission of prop- erty, and preservation and transmission of beliefs and customs. 'Fhe family is not now, and never has been, exclusively biological in char- acter. Like most institutions, it has evolved through a Ic^ng period of changing conventions which have given it a variety of functions and forms. No doubt there were primitive families in Paleolithic times, but we know practically nothing about them and they probably were not very stable. In Neolithic times the family clearly emerges and ap- pears to have been dominated by the male patriarch who had one or more wives depending upon region. A second institution known earlier but developed in more complex form by Neolithic peoples was religion. On account of its infinite variations, it is hard to define, but perhaps the following would be ac- cepted as an accurate definition of the institution in at least its basic character: “Religion is everywhere an expression in one form or an- other of a sense of dependence on a power outside ourselves, a power w'hich we may speak of as a spiritual or moral power.\"* Modern an- thropologists emphasize the fact that early religion was not so much a matter of belief as a matter of rites. For the most part, the rites came first; the myths, dogmas, and theologies were later rationalizations. Primitive people were universally dependent upon nature' — on the regular succession of the seasons, on the rain falling when it should, on the growth of plants and the reproduction of animals. Unless they performed sacrifices and rites these natural phenomena, according to this notion, would not occur. For this reason they developed rainmak- ing ceremonies in which water was sprinkled on ears of corn to imitate the falling of the rain. The members of a whole village or even a whole tribe would attire themselves in animal skins and mimic the habits and activities of some species they depended upon for food. They ap- parently had an idea that by imitating the life pattern of the species they were helping to guarantee its continuance. Still another of the great institutions to be developed by Neolithic peoples was the state. Fhis may be defined as an organized society oc- cupying a specific territory and possessing an authoritative govern- ment independent of external control. 'Fhe essence of the state is the pc^wer to make and administer laws and to preserve social order by punishing people for infractions of those laws. Except in time of crisis the state does not exist in a very large proportion of preliterate socie- ties — a fact which probably indicates that it originated rather late in the Neolithic culture stage. The major explanation for the development of states in the Neolithic period lies in the development of agriculture. In areas such as the Nile valley, where a large population lived by cultivating intensively a lim- ited area of fertile soil, a high degree of social organization was abso- lutely essential. Ancient aistoms would not suffice for the definition of rights and duties in such a society, with its high standard of living, its unequal distribution of wealth, and its wide scope for the clash of personal interests. New measures of social control would become nec- essary, which could scarcely be achieved in any other way than by set- * A. R.

As iinp(»rtant as the emergence of agriculture was in the origin ot states, it was not the only cause. In some areas where there was no settled agriculture, stares evidently were founded as a result of military activities. That is, they emerged for the purposes of i*onquest, for defense against invasion, or to make possible the expulsion of an invader from the country. The Hebrew monarchy seems to have been a product of the first of these reasons. With the w'ar for the conquest of the Holy Land none too successful, the Hebrew' people petitioned their leader Samuel to give them a king, that they might be “like all the nations\" with a powerful ruler to keep them in t)rder and to lead them tt) vicuiry in battle. One has only to observe the effects of mod- ern warfare, both offensive and defensive, in nilarging the powers of gcivernment to .see how similar influences might have operated to bring the state into existence in the first place. (k factors RESPONSIBLt: FOR THE ORIGIN AND (;rowth c^f civilizations 77 /( of' tiriludtion ( li o^rdphti tht'oriiw: thi iliWiihi hypothois Some time armind 3500 ii.c. the earliest dvili;:iUhm emerged out of Neolithic culture. We may say that civilization is a stage in human his- torical devekipinc'nt when w'riting is used to a considerable extent; some progress has been made in the arts and sciences; and political, social, and economic institutions have developed sufficiently to con- quer at least some of the problems of order, security, and efficiency in a complex society. What causes contributed to the rise of civilizations? What factors account for their growth? Why do some civilizatii^ns reach much higher levels of development than others? Inquiry into these questions is one of the chief pursuits of historians and social sci- entists. Some decide that tactors of geography are most important. Cithers stress economic resources, food supply, contact with older civilizations, and so on. Usually a variety of causes is acknowledged, but 4)ne is ce^mmonly singled out by historians as deserving special emphasis. Prcibably the most popular of the theories accounting for the rise of advanced cultures are those which come under the heading of geogra- phy. Prominent among them is the hypothesis of climate. The cli- matic theory, advocated by such philosophers as Aristotle and Mon- tesquieu, received its most eloquent exposition in the writings of an American geographer, Ellsworth Huntington. Huntington acknowl- edged the importance of other factors, but he insisted that no nation, ancient or modern, rose to the highest cultural status except under the influence of a climatic stimulus. He described the ideal climate as one in w hich the mean temperature seldcmi falls below 38 degrees or rises aboN'C 64 degrees Fahrenheit. Bur temperature is not alone important. Moisture is also essential, and the humidity should average about 7> percent. Finally, the weather must not be uniform: cyclonic storms, or i)rdinary storms rc'sulting in weather changes from day to day, must have sufficient frequency and intensity to clear the atmosphere every once in a while and produce those sudden variations in temperature which seem to be necessary to exhilarate and revitalize human beings. ’ Much can be said in favor of the climatic hypothesis, (.'ertainly some parts of the earth's surfiice, under existing atmospheric condi- tions, could never give rise to a superior culture. They are either too hot, too humid, too cold, or too dry. Such is the case in regions beyt^nd the Arctic C'ircle, the larger desert areas, and the rainlbrests ot India, ( Central America, and Brazil. Hvidence is available, moreover, to show that some of these places have lUM always existed under cli- mate so adverse as that now prevalent. Desolate sections of Asia, Africa, and America contain unmistakable traces of better days in the past. HcTe and there are the ruins of towns and cities where now the supply of water is totally inadequate, or which are entrapped by growths of dense foliage. Roads traverse deserts which at present are impassable, or come to an end at the mouth of a jungle. The best-known evidences of the cultural importance of climatic change are those pertaining to the civilization of the Mayas. Mayan civilization Hourished in (iuatemala, Honduras, and on the peninsula of Yucatan in Mexico from about 400 to i soo a.d. Numbered among its achievements were the making of paper, the invention of the zero, the perfection of a solar calendar, and the development t)f a system of writing partly pluHietic. Cheat cities were built; marked progress was made in astronomy; and sculpture and architecture reached advanced levels. At present most of the civilization is in ruins. No doubt many factors conspired to produce its end, including deadly wars between tribes, but climatic change was also probably involved. The remains of most of the great Mayan cities are now surrounded by jungles, where malaria is prevalent and agriculture difficult. That the Mayan civilization or any other could have grown to maturity under present- day conditii>ns is hard ti> believe. Related to the climatic hypothesis is the soil-exhaustion theory. A group of modern conservationists has hit upon this theory as the sole explanation of the decay and collapse of the great empires of the past and as a universal threat to the nations of the present and future. At best it is only a partial hypothesis, since it offers no theory of the birth or grow’th of civilizations. Ikit its proponents .seem to think that al- most any environment not ruined by humans is capable of nourishing a superior culture. The great deserts and barren areas of the earth, they maintain, are not natural but artificial, created by bad grazing and ^Kllsworth Munrin^ton.

The mighty civilizations that once flourished in these countries were ultimately doomed by the fact that their soil would no longer provide sufficient food for the pop- ulation. As a ciiiisequence, the more intelligent and enterprising citi- zens migrated elsewhere and left others to sink slowly into stagnation and apathy. But the late that twertook the latter was not of their mak- ing alone. The whole nation had been guilty of plundering the forests, mining the soil, and pasturing flocks on the land until the grass was eaten down to the very roots. Among the tragic results were floods al- ternating with droughts, since there were no longer any forests to reg- ulate the run-off of rain or snow. At the same time, much of the top soil on the close-cropped or excessively cultivated hillsides was blown away or washed into the rivers to be carried eventually down to the sea. The damage done was irreparable, since about three hundred years are required to produce a single inch of topsoil. A recent hypothesis of the origin of civilizations is the British histev rian Arnold J. Toynbee’s adversity tha>ry. According to this theory, Tlu' advmity thivir}> of conditions of hard.ship or adversity are the real causes which have Arnold i roYulur brought superior cxiltures into existence. Such conditions constitute a challvtijiiv which not only stimulates humans to try to overcome it but generates additional energy for new achievements. T he challenge may take the form of a desert, a jungle area, rugged topography, or a grudging soil. The Hebrews and Arabs were challenged by the first, the Indians of the Andes by the last. T he challenge may also take the form of defeat in war or even enslavement. Thus the Clarthaginians, as a result of defeat in the First Punic War, were stimulated to conquer a new empire in Spain. In general it is true that the greater the challenge, the greater the achievement; nevertheless, there are limits. The chal- lenge must not be too severe, else it will deal a crushing blow to all who attempt to meet it. 7. WHY THI^ EARLIEST CTVILIZATIONS BF-GAN WHERE THEY DIO Which of the great civilizations of antiquity was the oldest is still a sharply debated question. The judgment of some scholars inclines The Silv aud the ‘/Vvjnv toward the Egyptian, though a larger body of authority supports the liuphratcs claims of tlic Tigris- Euphrates valley. These two areas were geo- graphically the most favored sections in the Near East. In both, larger numbers of artifacts of undoubted antiquity have been found than in any other regions. Furthermore, progress in the arts and sciences had reached unparalleled heights in both of these areas as early as 3000 B.c., when most of the rest of the world was backward in the extreme. If the foundations of this progress were really laid elsewhere, it seems strange that they shcniUl have disappeared, although of course there is no telling what archeologists may uncover in the future. (/)f the several causes responsible for the earliest rise of civilizations in the Nile and Tigris- Euphrates valleys, gei>graphic factors would seem to have been the most important. Both regions had the notable advantage of a limited area ol exceedingly fertile soil. Altln»ugh it ex- tended for a distance of 7 so miles, the valley of the Nile was not more than 10 miles wide in some places, and its maximum width was 31 miles. T he total area w as less than 10,000 square miles, or riuighly the equivalent of Maryland. Through i ountless centuries the river had carved a vast canyon or trench, bounded on either side by cliffs rang- ing in height from a few hundred to a thousand feet. The Hoor of the canyon was covered with a ricli allu\\'ial deposit, which in places reached a depth in excess of thirty feet. The soil was of such amazing proeluctivity that as many as three crops per year could be raised on the same land. This broad and fertile canyini constituted the arable land of ancient Egypt. Here several million people w'ere concentrated. In Roman times the pi^pulation of the v-alley approximated seven mil- lion, and probably it was not much smaller in the days of the pharat)hs. Beyond the clifl's there was nothing but desert — the Libyan desert on the w'est and the Arabian on the east. In the Tigris-Euphrates valley — a part of the region known as the Fertile Oescent — similar cmiditions prevailed. As in Egypt, the rivers provided e.xcellent facilities for inland transportation and were alive with fish and waterfowl for a plentiful supply of protein. The distance between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers at one point w'as less than twenty miles, and now'here in the lower valley did it exceed forty-five miles. Since the surrounding country w^as desert, the people were kept from scattering over too great an expanse of territory. The result, as in Egypt, was the welding of the inhabitants into a compact .society, under ci^nditions that facilitated a ready interchange of ideas and dis- coveries. As the population increased, the need for agencies of social control became ever more urgent. Numbered among such agencies ware government, schools, legal and moral codes, and institutions for the production and distribution of wealth. At the same time condi- tions of living became more complex and artificial and necessitated the keeping of records (^f things accomplished and the perfection of new' techniques. Among the conseijuences were the invention of writing, the practice of smelting metals, the performance t>f mathematical operations, and the development of astronomy and the rudiments of physics. With these achievements the first great ordeal of civilization was passed. (dimatic influences also played their part in both regions. The at- mosphere of Egypt is dry and invigorating. Even the hottest days produce none of the oppressive discomfort which is often experienced during the summer .seasons in more northern countries. The mean temperature in winter varie's from 56 degrees Fahrenheit in the Nile V) ll'/iy C^ii’ilicatiotis IVheir They Did Imiitfii liffii oj p’rtilc .soil iti the Stic iuilli'y See color l.iciiii; similar uvulitioti in Misopottunui ( '.limatii advt2ntii(i^c^ in l-.gypl 20 Pclta to 66 degrees in the valley above. The summer mean is 83 Thv liiirlivst licijitwimis degrees and an occasional maximum of 122 is reached, but the nights are always cool and the humidity is extremely low. Hxcept in the Delta, rainfall occurs in negligible quantities, but the deficiency of mt)isture is ciuinteracted by the annual floods of the Nile from July to October. Also very significant from the historical standpoint is the total absence of malaria in Upper Egypt, while even in the coastal region it is practically unknown. The direction of the prevailing w^inds is likewise a tavorable factor of more than trivial importance. For more than three-quarters of the year the wind conies from the north, blowing in opposition to the force of the Nile current. The effect of this is to simplify immensely the problem of transportation. Up- stream trartic, with the propulsion of the wind to counteract the force of the river, presents no greater difficulty than dow'iistream traffic. This factor in ancient times must have been of enormous advantage in promoting communication among a numerous people, some of whom were separated by hundreds of miles. C 'liniatic conditions in Mesopotamia do not seem to have been quite so favorable as in Egypt. Tlie summer heat is more relentless; the hu- Clmiiitii in/lnrnits in iiiidity is sonicw'hat higher; and tropical diseases take their toll. Nev- Moopoumiiit erlheless, the torrid winds from the Indian Ocean, while enervating to human beings, blow' over the valley at Just the right season to bring the fruit of the date palm to a full ripeness. More than anything else the excellent yield of dates, the dietary staple of the Near East, en- couraged the settlement of large numbers of people in the valley of the two rivers. Finally, the melting of the snow^s in the mountains of the north produced an annual flooding t)f the Babylonian plain similar it) that in Egypt. The effect was to airich the soil with moisture and to cover it over wdth a layer of mud of unusual fertility. At the .same time, it should be noted that water conditions in Mesopotamia were less dependable than in Egypt. Floods were sometimes catastrophic, a factor w hich left its mark on the development of culture. Most significant of all of the geographic influences, how'ever, w'as the fact that the scanty rainfall in both regions provided a spur to ini- Thi- miportiwii’ ot Miinty tiative and inventive skill. In spite of the yearly floods of the rivers niiutdll its it spur to there was insufficient moisture left in the soil to produce abundant inihdtirr harvests. A few' weeks after the waters had receded, the earth was baked to a stony hardness. Irrigation was accordingly necessary if full advantage was to be taken of the richness of the soil. As a result, in both Egypt and Mesopotamia elaborate systems of dams and irriga- tion canals were constructed as long as five thoasand years ago. The mathematical skill, engineering ability, and social cooperation neces- sary for the development of‘ these projects were available for other uses and so fostered die achievement of civilization. Which of the tw'o civilizations, the Egyptian or the Mesopotamian, w^as the older? Until recently most historians appeared to take it for granted that the Egyptian was the older. They based their assumption upon the conclusions two of the world’s most renowned Egyptol- ogists, James H. Hreasted and Alexandre Moret. Between the two world wars of the twvntieth century, however, facts were unearthed which seemed to prove a substantial Mesopotamian influence in the Nile valley as early as 3500 H.(.. This influence was exemplitied by the ( 'thnnutU)' lo whuh use of cylinder seals, methods of building construction, art motifs, dviltzMioti u\\is Ma and elements of a system of w riting of undoubted Mesopotamian ori- gin. That such achievements could have radiated into Egypt from the Tigris-E.uphrates valley at so early a date indicated beyond doubt that the Mesopotamian civilization w'as one of vast antiquity. It did not necessarily prove, though, that it was older than the Egyptian. Eor the achievements mentioned were not taken over and copied slavishly. In- stead, the Egyptians modified them radically to suit their ow n ailture pattern. On the basis of this evidence, it w ould seem that the only conclusion w'hich can be safely drawn is that both civilizations were very old, and that to a large extent they developed concurrently. With them both w e begin the story of the history of Western civilizations.

Al- though the Egyptian rivilization was not necessarily the oldest in the ancient world, it was certainly of great antiquity; its origins date from about 3 500 B.t;. We may consider it here first because somewhat more is kiKiwn about its accomplishments than about those of most other early peoples. It should be borne in mind while reading this chapter, however, that Mesopotamian and, later, either civilizations were de- veloping simultaneously and sometimes influenced Egyptian develop- ments. The hallmark of Egyptian civilizatiem was the sense of stability of- fered by the Nile valley. The fact that the Nile flooded regularly year after year gave Egyptians a feeling that nature was predictable and be- nign. Moreover, the fertility of the soil in the valley provided for great agricultural wealth, and the fact that the valley was surrounded by deserts and the sea meant that Egypt was comparatively free from threats of foreign invasion, for all these reasons Egyptian civilization was both very advanced and remarkably peaceful. The Grcx.’k histtv rian Herodotus was undoubtedly correct when he referred to Egypt as “the gift of the Nile.” pimuicy of liilYpt otui McufotiimitJ I'ovordhli' lOtiditwih Jof the divcloptnnii of l:^yptiiW livili^ratiofi 26 lii^YptitW (Jivilizimofi I. politic: AL HISTORY UNDER THE PHARAOHS The ancient history of Egypt is usually divided into three periods: the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom, and the Empire. Even before Sunn's i>/ histi^ty the Old Kingdom some cultural achievements had been attained. The Egyptians had begun their earliest attempts at irrigation and drainage. They had also learned to use copper tools in place of stone ones, thereby benefiting from the advantages that copper outlasted stone and that copper could be easily sharpened or recast when blunted. Above all, they had developed a system of laws based upon customs and had worked out the initial stage of a system of writing. About 3100 H.c. Egypt was united into a single unit known as the Old Kingdom. From 3100 b.c. to 2200 b.c. six dynasties ruled the 77ir Old Kinj^dom country. Each was headed by a line of ‘‘pharaohs,” from the Egyptian per-o, meaning “great house” or “royal house.” fhe pharaoh was con- sidered to be the son of the sun god and was forbidden to marry any- one other than one of his own sisters lest the divine blood be contami- nated. Limitation of rule to the members of a single family also meant that there could be fewer claimants to the throne, and hence less chance of revolution. The authority of the pharaoh was limited to the ancient law: he was not above tlie law but subject to it. No separation of religious and political life existed. The pharat>h’s chief subordinates were priests, and he himself was the chief priest. The government of the Old Kingdom was founded upon a policy of peace and nonaggression. In this respect it was virtually unique among Tht‘ noHmilititristu ancient states. The pharaoh had no standing army, nor was there any- ihintiitet of the < )ld thing that could be called a national militia. Each local area had its own Kins^dotu militia, but militias were commanded by civil officials, and when called into active service generally devoted their energies to labor on the public works. In case of a threat of invasion the various local units were assembled at the call of the pharaoh and placed under the com- mand of one of his civil subordinates. At no other time did the head of the government have a military force at his disposal. The Egyptians of the Old Kingdom were content for the most part to work out their own destinies and to let other nations alone. The reasons for this atti- tude are to be found in the protected position of their country, in their possc.ssion of land of inexhaustible fertility, and in the fact that their state w^as a product of cooperative need instead of being grounded in exploitation. After roughly a milkimium of peace and relative prosperity the Old Kingdom came to an end about 2200 B.c. Several causes were respon- llnd of the Old Kingdom sible. Ciovcrnmental revenues became exhausted because the pharaohs invested heavily in such grandiose projects as pyramid-building. These enterprises also placed great burdens upon Egyptian subjects who were pressed into forced labor and helped to impoverish and de- moralize them. In the meantime provincial nobles usurped more and more power until caitral authority virtually disappeared. The period which followed is called the First Intermediate Age. Anarchy now prevailed. The nobles created their own rival principalities, and politi- cal chaos was aggravated by internal brigandage and invasion by desert tribes. The Intermediate Age did not end until the rise of the Fleventh Dynasty which restored centralized rule around aoso h.c. The next great stage of Egyptian history, known as the Middle King- dom, ensued. Throughout most of its life the government of the Middle King- dom was more socially responsible than that of the Old Kingdom. The Eleventh Dynasty could not withstand the power of the nobles, 7 /i< \\Uddlc Kingdom but the Twelfth, which followed around lyyo and lasted until 17S6 H.c., ruled strongly by means of an alliance with a middle class com- 28 liilYptiiUi a vili catioti TVir ini»asiiw oj the Jlyhsos Ramses U (XlXth Dynasty/ posed of officials, merchants, artisans, and farmers. This alliance kept the nobility in check and laid the foundations for unprecedented pros- perity. During the rule of the Twelfth Dynasty there w'ere advances in social justice and much intellectual achievement. Public works that benefited the whole population, such as extensive drainage and irriga- tion projects, replaced the building of pyramids, which had no prac- tical use. There was also a democrati/ation of religion which extended to common people a hope for salvation that they had not been granted before. Religion now emphasized proper moral conduct instead of rit- ual dependent on wealth. For all these reasons the reign of the I’welfth Dynasty is ci>mmonly considered to be tgypt’s classical or golden age. Immediately afterwards, however, Kgypt entered its Second Inter- mediate Era. This was another period of internal chaos and foreign in- vasion which lasted for more than tw^o centuries, or from 1786 to 1 575 II. c. The contemporary records are scanty, but they seem to show that the internal disorder wms the result of a counterrevolt of the nobles. The pharaohs were again reduced to impotence, and much of the social progress of the Twelfth Dynasty was destroyed. About 1750 the land was invaded by the Hyksos, or \"Rulers of Foreign Lands,\" a mixed horde originating in wvstern Asia. Their military prowess is commonly ascribed to the fact that they possessed horses and war chariots, but their victory was certainly made easier by the dissension among the Egyptians themselves. I'heir rule had profound effects upon Egyptian history. Not only did they familiarize the Egyptians with new methods of warfare, but by providing them with a common grievance in the face of foreign tyranny they also enabled them to forget their differences and unite in a common cause. Near the end of the seventeenth century b.c. the rulers of northern Egypt launched a revolt against the Hyksos, a movement which was eventually ji>ined by most of the Egyptians of the south. By 1 >75 all of the conquerors who had not been killed or enslaved had been driven from the country. The hero of this victory, Ahrnose, founder of the Eighteenth Dynasty, now' made himself master of Egypt. The regime he established was much more highly consolidated than any that had hitherto existed. In the great resurgence of nationalism which had ac- companied the struggle against the Hyksos, local loyalties were re- duced, and w'ith it the power of the nobles. The period which followed the accession of Ahrnose is called the period of the Empire. It lasted from 1575 to 1087 h.c:., during which time the country was ruled by three dynasties of pharaohs in succes- sion; the Eighteenth, Nineteenth, and Twentieth. No longer was the prevailing state policy pacific and isolationist; a spirit of aggressive im- perialism rapidly pervaded the nation. The causes of tliis change are not far to seek. 7 Tie military ardor generated by the successful war against the Hyksos w'hetted an appetite for further victories. A vast 29 History military machine had been created to expel the invader, which proved to be too valuable an adjunct to the pharaoh's power to be discarded immediately. rhe first steps in the direction of the new policy w'ere taken by the immediate successors ot Ahmose in making extensive raids into Pales- tine and claiming sovereignty over Syria. With one of the most tor- ot the l mfun midable armies of ancient times the new pharaohs speedily annihilated all opposition in Syria and eventually made themselves masters t)t' a vast domain extending from the Huphrates to the farther cataracts of the Nile. But they never succeeded in welding the conquered peoples into loyal subjects, and weakness was the signal for widespread revolt in Syria. Their successors suppressed the uprising and managed to hold the Empire together for some time, hut ultimate disaster loiild not be averted. More territory had been annexed than could be man- aged successfully. 'Fhe influx of wealth into Egypt weakened the na- tional fiber by fostering corruption and luxury, and the constant re- volts of the vanquished eventually sapped the strength of the state beyond all hope of recovery. By the twelfth century most of the conquered provinces had been permanently lost. The government of the Empire resembled that of the Old King- dom, except for the fact that it was more absolute. Military power was now the basis of the pharaoh’s rule. A professional army was Thi\\\\:ovnumau oj tin always available with which to overawe his subjects. Most of‘ the l^mphe former nobles now became courtiers or members of the ri>yal bureau- cracy under the complete domination of the king. rhe last of the great pharaohs was l^anises III, who ruled from 1 1S2 to 1151 H.c. He was succeeded by a long line of nonentities who inherited his name but not his ability. By the middle of the tw'elfth The hiyi of the plurnwhs century Egypt had fallen prey to numerous ills of barbarian invasion and social decadence. Libyans and Nubians were sw^arming over the country and gradually debasing cultural standards. About the same time the Egyptians themselves appear to have lost their creative talent. To win immortality by magic devices was now the commanding in- terest of people of every class. 'Lhe process of decline was hastened also by the growing power of the priests, who finally usurped the royal prerogatives and dictated the pharaoh’s decrees. Eroni the middle of the tenth century to nearly the end of the eighth a dynasty of Libyan barbarians occupied the throne of the pharaohs. The Libyans wTre follow'cd by a line of Ethiopians or Nubians, who The dowtitiill of i.i^ypt came in from the desert regions w'cst of the Upper Nile. In 670 Egypt was conquered by the Assyrians, w'ho succeeded in maintaining their supremacy for only eight years. After the collapse of Assyrian rule in 662 the Egyptians regained their independence, and a brilliant renais- sance of culture ensued. It was doomed to an untimely end, however, for in 525 B.c. the country was conquered by the Persians. The ancient civilization was never again revived. 3 (» Hi^Yptian Civili^iUioH 2. h(;yi>tian rhli(;ic)n Religion playt'd a dominant role in the life of the ancient Egyptians, leaving its impress upon almost everything. The art was an expression The iffiportame of of religious symbolism. The literature and philosophy were suffused rvliiiwii in with religious teachings. The government of the Old Kingdom was to a large extent a theocracy, and even the military pharaohs of the Hm- pire prcTessed to mle in the name of the gods. Material resources in considerable amounts were expended in providing elaborate tombs and in supporting priests. The religion of the ancient Egyptians went through various stages: from simple polytheism to the earliest known expression of monothe- Thv fijrly frli{>iou< ism, and then back to pt)lytheism. In the beginning each city or dis- iTolution trict appears to have had its local tlt'ities, who were guardian gods of the locality or personifications of nature powers. The unification of the country under the Old Kingdom resulted not only in a consoli- dation of territory but in a fusion of divinities as well. All of the guardian deities were merged into the great sun god Re. Under the Middle Kingdom, with the establishment of T heban dynasties in con- trol of the government, this deity was commonly called Amon or Amon-Re from the name of the chief god of Thebes. The gods w ho personified the vegetative ptiwers of nature were fiised into a deity called Osiris, who was also the god of the Nile. I’hroughout Egyptian history tht'se two great powders who ruled the universe, Amon and Osiris, vied with each other for supremacy. Other deities, as we shall .see, w'ere recognized also, but they ticcupied a distinctly subordinate place. During the period of the OKI Kingdom the solar faith, embodied in the worship of Re, w'as the dominant system of belief. It served as an I'hf solar fiuth official religion who.se chietTlinction was to give immortality to the state and to the people collectively. The pharaoh was the living repre- .sentative of this faith on earth; through his rule the rule of the god was maintained. But Re was not only a guardian deity. He was in addition the god of righteousnc'ss, justice, and truth, and the upholder of the moral order of the universe. He offered no spiritual blessings or even material rewards to people as individuals. The solar faith was not a religion for the masses as such, except insofar as their welfare coin- cided w ith tliat of the state. The cult of Osiris, as wc have already observed, began its existence as a nature religion. The god personified the growth of vegetation and The Osiris mil the life-giving powers of the Nile. The career of Osiris was wrapped about with an elaborate legend. In the remote past, according to be- lief, he had been a benevolent ruler, w'ho taught his people agriculture and other practical arts and gave them laws. After a time he was treacherously slain by his wicked brother Set, and his body cut into /■Hfirrary Papyrus. The scene shows the heart of a priiieess of the XXlst Dynasty being weighed in a balance before the god (Osiris. On the other side of the balance are the symbols tor life and truth. pieces. His wife Isis, w ho w'as also his sister, went in search of the pieces, put them together, and miraculously restored his body to life. F'he risen god regained his kingdom and continued his beneficent rule for a time, but eventually descended to the nether world to serve as judge of the dead. Horns, his posthumous son, finally grew to man- lu)C)d and avenged his father’s death by killing Set. Originally this legend seems to have been little more than a nature myth. The death and resurrection of Osiris symbolized the recession of the Nile in the autumn and the coining of the flood in the spring. Si^i^nifuamv of the (hiris But in time the Osiris legend began to take on a deeper significance. Iv^md The human qualities of the deities concerned — the paternal solicitude of Osiris for his subjects, the faithful devotion of his wife and son — appealed to the emotions of average Fgyptians, who were now able to see their own tribulations and triumphs mirrored in the lives of the gods. More important still, the death and resurrection i>f Osiris came to be regarded as conveying a promise of personal immortality. As the god had triumphed over death and the grave, so might also the indi- vidual who followed him faithfully inherit everlasting life. Finally, the victory of Horus over Set appeared to foreshadow the ultimate ascen- dancy of good over evil. Fgyptian ideas of the hereafter attained their full development in the later history of the Middle Kingdom. For this reason elaborate prepa- rations had to be made to prevent the extinction of one's earthly re- H^iyptian ideas of the mains.

As the religion advanecd toward maturity, however, a less naive conception of the afterlife was adopted. \"File dead were now' believed to appear before Osiris to be judged according to their deeds on earth. All of the departed wdio met the tests included in this system of judgment entered a celestial realm of physical delights and simple pleasures. Here in marshes of lilies and lotus-flow'ers they would hunt wild geese and quail with never-ending success. Or they might build houses in the midst of orchards with luscious fruits of unfailing yield. They would find lily-lakes on which to sail, pools of sparkling water in which to bathe, and shady groves inhabited by .singing birds and every manner of gentle creature. Fhe uidortunate victims whose hearts revealed their vicious lives were utterly destroyed. The Hgyptian religion attained its highest perfection about the end of the Middle Kingdom. IJy this time the solar faith and the cult of C )siris had been merged in such a w'ay as to preserve the best features of both. The province of Ainon as the god of the living, as the cham- pii>n of good in this w’orld, was accorded almost equal importance with the functions of Osiris as the giver of personal immortality and the judge of the dead. The religion was now quite clearly an ethical (^ne. People repeatedly avowed their desire tt> do justice because such conduct w'as pleasing to the great sun god. .Soon after the establishment of the bmpire the religion which has just been described underw'ent a serious debasement. Its ethical signifi- cance was largely destroyed, and superstition and magic gained the as- cendancy. The chief cause seems to have been that the long and bitter war for the expulsion of the Hyksos fostered the growth of irrational attitudes and correspondingly depreciated the intellect, 'I’he result was a marked increase in the power of the priests, w ho preyed upon the fears of the masses to promote their t)wn advantage. Fhey inaugurated the practice of selling magical charms, which were supposed to have the effect of preventing the heart of the deceased from betraying his or her real character. They also sold formulas which, inscribed on rolls of papyrus and placed in the tomb, were alleged to be effective in facili- tating the passage of the dead tt) the celestial realm. The aggregate of these formulas constituted what is referred to as the Book of the 1 )ead. (Contrary to the general impression, it was not an Hgyptian Bible, but merely a collection of mortuary inscriptions. This degradation of the religion at the hands of the priests into a sys- tem of magical practices finally resulted in a great religious upheaval. The leader of this movement was the Pharaoh Amenhotep IV, who began his reign about 137 ^ b.c. and died or was murdered about fif- teen years later. After some fruitless attempts to correct the most flagrant abuses, he resolved to crush the system entirely. He drove the priests from the temples, hacked the names of the traditional deities from the public monuments, and initiated the worship of a new god whom he called “Aton,\" an ancient designation tor the physical sun. He changed his own name from Amenhotep (“Amon rests”) to Ikh- iiaton, which meant “Aton is satisfied.” His wife Nefertiti became Neler-nefrii-aton: “Heaiitiful is the beauty of Aton.” In keeping with his desire to begin entirely anew, Ikhnaton built a new capital, fil- Amarna, which he dedicated to the worship of the new deity. More important than these physical changes was the new set of doc- trine's enundated by the reforming pharaoh. He taught first of all a religion of qualified monotheism. Aton and Ikhnaton himself were the only gods in existence. Like none of the geids before him, Aton had no human or animal shape but was li^ be conceived in terms of the life- giving, warming rays of the sun. He was the creator of all, and thus god not merely of Hgypt but of the whole universe. Ikhnaton deemed himself to be Aton’s heir and co-regent; while the pharaoh and his wife worsliiped Aton, others were to worship Ikhnaton as a living deity. Aside from this important (|ualification Ikhnaton restored the ethical quality of Egyptian religion at its best by insisting that Aton was the author of the nu)ral order (^f the world and the rewarder of mankind for integrity and purity of heart. He envisaged the new' god as the sustainer of all that is of benefit to humanity, and as a heavenly father who watches with benevolent care over all his creatures. C’on- ceptions like these of the unity, righteousne.ss, and benevolence of Cioci were not attained again until the time of the Hebrew prophets some f)CX} years later. Despite the energy with which Ikhnaton pursued his religious revt>- lution it was still a failure. The religion of Aton gained little popular following because the masses remained devoted to their old gods. The new religion was too strange for them and w as lacking in the greatest attraction of the older faith: the promise of an afterlife. Moreover, the pharaohs w'ho followed Ikhnaton were allied with the priests of Amon and accordingly restored the colder mcKles of worship. Ikhnaton’s suc- cessor, the pharaoh whom we refer to as “King Tut,” changed his name from l utanklwrc// to Tutanklw/i/n/, abandoned El-Amarna for the old capital of fhebes, and presided over a return to all the old ways. His ow^n burial w'as a lavish ciemonstration oi c'ommitment to the old rituals and belief in life after death. Thereafter Egyptian re- ligion was characterized by growing faith in ritualism and magic. Priests sold formulas and charms which w^ere supposed to trick the gods into granting salvation: thus even the cult of Osiris lost most of its elevated moral quality. 3. e(;yptian intellectual ac.:hievements The philosophy of ancient Egypt w'as chiefly ethical and political, al- though traces of broader philosophic conceptions are occasionally to be found.

Other philosophic ideas of the ancient Egyp- tians included the conception of an eternal universe, the notion of con- stantly recurring cycles of events, and the doctrine of natural cause and effect. No Egyptian writers could be classified as “pure” philoso phers. They were concerned primarily with religion and w'ith ques- tions of individual conduct and social justice. The earliest examples of Egyptian ethical philosophy were maxims similar to those of the Book of Proverbs in the Old Testament. They went little beyond practical wisdom, but occasionally they enjoined tolerance, moderation, and justice. As political philosophers the Egyptians developed a concept of the state as a welfare institution presided over by a bcmevolent ruler. This concept was embodied especially in the Plea of the lHoqumt Pcasatit, written about 2050 w.c. It sets forth the idea of a ruler committed to benevolence and justice for the good of his subjects. He is urged to act as the father of the orphan, the husband of the widow, and the brother of the forsaken. He is supposed to judge impartially and to execute punishment upon whom it is due; and to promote such an order of harmony and prosperity that no one will be deprived of basic human necessities. The branches of science wliich most absorbed the attention of the Egyptians were astronomy, mathematics, and medicine. All were de- veloped for practical ends — astronomy primarily to compute the time of the Nile floods, mathematics for building purposes, and medicine for healing. The Egyptians were by no means pure scientists, fhey had little interest in the nature of the universe as such, a fact which probably accounts for their failure to advance very far in the science of astronomy. Nonetheless they did perfect a calendar based on the an- nual appearance of Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, whose yearly rising invariably preceded the overflowing of the Nile. In addition they w^orked out a lunar calendar to mark the succession of religious rites. Mathematics w^as more highly developed. The Egyptians laid the foundations for arithmetic and geometry.
