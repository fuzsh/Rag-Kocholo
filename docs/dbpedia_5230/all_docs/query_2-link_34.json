        "text": "In this paper I will examine the reformist thought of Fazlur Rahman (1919–1988). The first section will contain a systematic reconstruction of Rahman’s reformist method, while the second attempts a systematic review of the major inconsistencies in Rahman’s thought processes. My key observation is that Rahman tacitly employs a normative source other than the Qurʾān, i.e. the pre-reflexive system of values shared by contemporary societies, but without accounting for this. To obfuscate this fact, Rahman legitimizes his reformist thought by means of a simple reference to the “present situation” (thesis I) and constructs a viciously circular method (thesis II), which is only able to suggest reasonable solutions to those exegetical questions for which the undefined “present situation” already provides distinct and established answers (thesis III). Thus Rahman’s normatively underdetermined method is not only deficient due to its arbitrary character, it also provides a legitimatory source for his violent opponents. Furthermore, I will review the unsatisfactory state of the secondary literature which overlooks or conceals Rahman’s problematic aspects, instead uncritically advocating superficial reform. Rather than methodically unregulated reformist discourse, I will argue for a strict distinction between the experiential or aesthetic dimension of religion and the normative questions which should be entirely delegated to the domain of the secular philosophy of human rights.\n\nThis paper discusses the issues of radicalism that have reappeared in the public sphere nowadays. The discussion will focus on the interpretation of Jihad by Fazlur Rahman and Tariq Ramadan. They are among two modern reformers whose ideas heavily focus on the social, economic and political issues about Muslims in the West. This paper will discuss the thoughts of these two figures about jihad spread across their various writings. As a contemporary reformist Muslim leader, Rahman and Ramadan had made many interpretations of the Qur&#39;an by adapting to the social context of society when the interpretation was made, namely Western society. Their Qur&#39;anic interpretations and their thoughts-whether directly or indirectly-reflect on the circumstances and challenges that Muslims encounter in the West, Europe and the US, today. This paper contributes to the discussion of the meaning of jihad and various attempts at interpretation of the term. Besides, this paper will at least provide...\n\nThe first edition of Islam, Fundamentalism, and the Betrayal of Tradition was published in 2004. Since that time many individuals and organizations have continued the effort to alleviate misunderstandings between Islam and the West. But for every book that seeks to clarify the teachings of traditional Islam, many more are published that seek to distort Islam and to demonize Muslims. The majority of the best sellers on Islamic topics continue to be those that present Islam as a violent and irrational religion bent on the destruction of Western civilization. And to be anti-Muslim or anti-Arab remains the only accepted form of bigotry in the United States. This reflects the continuation of a deep divide between Islam and the West, one that is not inherent to their common heritage.1 This collection of essays has had some small effect in stemming the tide of misinformation and disinformation, and the authors of these essays have been heartened by the reception they have received. Nonetheless, a long road remains ahead. The “war on terror” has brought more fear than security, and the war in Iraq has created extreme distrust. Given the positive reception the first edition received, we believe it can continue to play a small role in helping those who wish to overcome such obstacles. We have thus decided to update several of the essays and add a new essay that provides readers with a better understanding of gender relations in classical Islam. We hope that this and other works of its kind will continue to aid those who seek to establish better relations between Islam and the West."
