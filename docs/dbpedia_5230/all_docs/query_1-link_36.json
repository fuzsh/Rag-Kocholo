        "text": "STARTING UP\n\nTAKING YOUR VERY FIRST STEPS AT SYNC/RONICITY\n\nGreetings, and welcome to SYNC/ronicity. SYNC/ is an animanga fantasy roleplay with a focus on dragon hunting, taking place across three separate years and locations. Our site features a mild progression system, and aims to tell a complete story – with beginning, middle, and end – over the course of its run. New members and characters will always be welcome up until the ending of the run, of course!\n\nAll major site information has been compiled here, and can be navigated through the links to the right. While we ask members have a general understanding of what's written here, the most important links to keep track of are the guidelines, premise and setting, timelines, and faq. Be sure to familiarize yourself with these before jumping headfirst into the site proper.\n\nOnce you've finished reading up, prospective members must register an out of character account, which will serve as a parent account and the general hub for all out of character posts around the board. Out of character custom profiles fields will be hidden until the account is properly sorted; in order to get it sorted, simply post a request in the moderation request thread, or if you are a member of our Discord, a message in the #role-sorting channel.\n\nGUIDELINES\n\nRULES YOU SHOULD BE FOLLOWING ON SYNC/RONICITY\n\nDuring your time on SYNC/, you're are expected to abide by the following rules. Please give them a thorough read before proceeding on the forum. Rules may be edited, adjusted, or even removed entirely at the staff's discretion; registered members will be alerted in these instances.\n\ncharacter guidelines\n\nRegister one account on the forum per character, in addition to your OOC account. OOC names may not be offensive in nature, should not contain numbers, and should not be overly long. Character accounts' display names should contain only the character's FIRST NAME ONLY. Please avoid using special characters like 'ō' or 'é' so that people are not struggling to tag your character's account. (E.g., register as Saizou, not Saizō.) Face claims must be animanga in nature. CGI will be allowed in the case of a claim having little 2D art. If you'd like to use original artwork for a face claim, please contact staff before with proof that it is your own art, or commissioned piece(s). Keep your artwork tasteful: no gore, no nudity, et cetera. Members start off with four character slots. After your fourth character you must have twenty posts on every living character to unlock additional slots, with a hard cap of six characters. If a character dies in a thread, they will be sorted as 'Deceased'. Deceased characters do not count towards your character limit and can still be played in old threads and participate in AUs or liquid time. See here for information about what happens to shop items when a character dies in rp. Characters who die 'off screen' will be archived and eventually deleted in the next activity check; archived characters are no longer playable. Characters must be at least sixteen years old. No child soldiers here.\n\nroleplaying guidelines\n\nThere is no word min or max for applications, posts, et cetera. SYNC/ does, however, appreciate brevity. Aside from specifically moderated dragon landings and quests, battles will be handled in freeform. In PvP, higher ranked characters should be expected to beat lower ranked characters, unless an agreement has been reached beforehand. Do not abuse this freedom to make your hunters unstoppable. Activity checks will be run regularly, with a minimum monthly requirement of two ic posts per character account, to keep the forum free of clutter.\n\ngeneral guidelines\n\nMembers must be at least thirteen to join, per Jcink's ToS, and talk both on the forum and within the Discord should be kept to PG-13. That being said, we do have a premium jcink membership. Threads with mature content must be tagged properly with restricted tags (which look like this [restricted ][/restricted ] with no spaces, around your posts) in order to keep members 18 and under out. A designated NSFW chat has been created in the Discord, but please tag any explicit content on the site. Out of character accounts should be used for all out of character posting on the board, including: mod request, claims, event sign-ups, site shop, and other miscellaneous posts. In character accounts should be strictly used for in character content, or posts pertaining only to that character (ie. development posts or IC forum games). Members may only use templates located in our site templates board. If you are unhappy with the selection, staff requests for new templates of a certain type or style may be made, so long as they're kept reasonable. Staff word is final on all things. We will try to be accommodating of new ideas for the betterment of the site – please extend the same courtesy back. Above all else, be respectful. Be kind to your fellow roleplayers, do not plagiarize, do not talk back to staff. Theft, harassment, and general intentional misconduct will not be tolerated. Members will be issued one warning for this sort of behavior, then banned, should the behavior continue.\n\nPREMISE & SETTING\n\nWELCOME TO THE WORLD OF SYNC/RONICITY\n\nApproximately two hundred years ago, in a land once known as Tokyo, humanity took its last stand against the greatest threat it has ever known – an apocalyptic beast known as the True Dragon Fomulhaut – and won. In the decades that have come to pass since, the remnants of society have scraped together their bearings, banded together, and built themselves up to be stronger than ever before, culminating with the technological powerhouse and cultural melting pot known today as Arcadia. Yet, the memories of Earth's near brush to total annahilation haven't quite gone forgotten, even in modern time's newest generations.\n\nWhen the tell-tale signs of a new attack began to appear around the city; manifesting as the bright red blooms known as Dragonsbane, and the local flora and faunu's mutation into bloodthirsty creatures called the Turned, only the most skeptical could manage to turn a blind eye. As sightings of Turned begin to degrade into sightings of dragons, themselves, however, reality begins to dawn on the city: Tokyo's old threat has become today's very real problem.\n\nIn 2515 AD, both the International Self-Defense Force and the independent gaming company NODENS Enterprises come across an even more disturbing revelation: Fomulhaut was only one of seven True Dragons, and the worst of them all is set to finish what its predecessor could not.\n\nHope for survival rests entirely within the hands of NODENS' Dragon Chronicle project, an effort to collect samples and data from the first six True Dragons that will enable the engineering of a weapon – perhaps the only one – that can slay the coming beast. The dragon threat has plagued Earth since its earliest days, and appears to continue to plague it in the years that will come. Hope, then, lies within the hands of time... or across it, rather. The greatest minds have worked together to build a machine capable of traversing both time and space. All that is left to do is travel to the distant past and the distant future, overcoming obstacles each more deadly than the last. Can you save life as we know it – or is Earth doomed to permanent destruction?\n\nWELCOME TO ARCADIA - 2515 AD\n\nThe technological super power of the modern day: Arcadia's construction in the ruins of a city once named Tokyo was one of the earliest construction efforts following the defeat of True Dragon Fomulhaut, and the resulting metropolis is one of modern day Earth's shining achievements. The city, boasting shy of ten million people living within its borders, has spread further than its predecessor, and exists as an independent city-state, separate from its neighboring countries. Arcadia's massive territory and advancements in technology – well beyond that of anywhere else in the world – have made it a desirable place to live. People of all origins and cultures have come to make the domed city their home.\n\nArcadia houses the headquarters of NODENS Enterprises, along with the site of their virtual reality recruitment game, Seventh Encount. Due to the increased number of attacks and the upcoming True Dragon's predicted landing point existing within the city limits, the International Self-Defense Force has relocated its dragon hunting branch here. Residents are almost exclusively human, shy of the population of the ISDF's human-shaped experiments.\n\nWELCOME TO ATLANTIS - 7238 BC\n\nThe ancient water world paradise of myth: Atlantis exists in the distant past as a nation built underwater, populated by a species far more intelligent and advanced than anything else that existed on Earth at the time. Atlantis' entire existence hinges on artifacts created from the corpse of the first True Dragon Iod, with different types having different effects: the creation of the dome that allows for an atmosphere underwater, the levitation of rocks both small and monolithic that the nation builds its countrysides on, the illumination of settlements further below sea level, and the sacred ground of the Ladyin; a tower that spans the entire vertical length. The capital city, also named Atlantis, once appeared to be a watery utopia right out of a picture book. Class struggles, however, have opened the city up only to high born citizens, while the low born citizens are pushed further down onto less stable land.\n\nAltogether, there are approximately two thousand Lucier that inhabit the ruined remains, decimated by dragon activity. While the high born plan to self destruct, taking True Dragon Nyala down with them, dissent in the low born communities has given rise to the Cladeon Militia in a small mining town in the lower ward.\n\nWELCOME TO BABYLON - 8794 AD\n\nThe naturalistic republic of the distant future: Babylon takes a step further back than Arcadia, and even Atlantis as far as technology is concerned, opting generally for a lifestyles that exist more readily with nature, chrons, and people's innate magic. Nations within have struggled against dragons non-stop for nearly a century, following the sealing – but not defeat – of True Dragon Haze, but while villages and cities like Preloma have collapsed entirely, the focal point of the Kazan Republic stands firm in opposition. Built by a dragon hunter for dragon hunters, Kazan stands as one of the largest cities and nations in the land, despite its rugged and modest appearance. All over the continent – and likely the world beyond – the remains of old civilizations crumble ever further beneath the sun, signature of some devastating event that took place between 2515 AD and 8794 AD. Paired with the number of razed homes and settlements, things are a bit of an overgrown eyesore.\n\nBabylon contains, in its entirety, around 1.5 million civilians, tossed up between both human and lucier. While hatred toward dragonkind has bred many different rebellions and militia, most notable is Kazan's Hunter's Guild, led by the world famous Emel herself.\n\nIMPORTANT FIGURES\n\nPEOPLE TO MEET AND GREET ON SYNC/RONICITY\n\nAll member played dragon hunters are equal in turns of their rank in the hierarchy, set apart from each other only by skill and individuality, but each hunting group requires a leader. Those leaders, along with other important players, are listed below. If you would like to thread with any of the following NPCs, whether it be for perks, or simply to interact with them, please post a request in either the moderation request thread or the #mod-request channel in the Discord.\n\nNODENSALLIE\n\nROLEceo of nodens enterprises\n\nRANKrank-e trickster\n\nAGEnever ask a lady\n\nPRONOUNS she / her\n\nSPECIES human\n\nCHARACTER BLURB The CEO of NODENS Enterprises. Despite an appearance that could appear as somewhat imposing, Allie's warm demeanor and carefree way of conversing can make almost anyone in a room comfortable. She works incredibly well under stress, with nary a chip in her poker face even in the most dire situations, and despite a somewhat flippant attitude toward most things, she's very dedicated – even motherly – toward the hunters who work for NODENS. She speaks with a hard-to-place accent. Where she came from, or how she came to acquire NODENS is unknown.\n\nNODENSJULIETTA\n\nROLEhead of development\n\nRANKrank-c agent\n\nAGEforty-one\n\nPRONOUNSshe / her\n\nSPECIEShuman\n\nCHARACTER BLURB The head of development at NODENS. Julietta's genius is what gave rise to most features at NODENS, up to and including both the virtual reality game Seventh Encount and the time machine hunters use to traverse to Atlantis and Babylon. While she's generally light-hearted, even a bit flirty with the males, Julie has a prickly side to her, not one to stand even friendly teasing. Older workers at the ISDF may remember her as an ISDF technician named Jurota, but the two things she can't stand the most are the ISDF and her dead name.\n\nNODENSNAGAMIMI\n\nROLEnodens spokeswoman\n\nRANKrank-a idol\n\nAGEunknown\n\nPRONOUNSshe / her\n\nSPECIESunknown\n\nCHARACTER BLURB Wearing an adorable face while promoting NODENS in public – wearing a permanent scowl while away from the camera eye. A short stature and a baby-like face betray the beast underneath, a tempest of irritation and curse words that Nagamimi isn't afraid to let out against anyone and everyone. She'll assure you she isn't a kid, and not to lump her up with 'you stupid humans', but how old she actually is or what she is if not a human remains a mystery. Nagamimi provides 'support' from home base for travelling hunters, although most would say it's more akin to 'berating'.\n\nNODENSMIO\n\nROLEnavigator in training\n\nRANKrank-e god hand\n\nAGEsixteen\n\nPRONOUNSshe / her\n\nSPECIEShuman\n\nCHARACTER BLURB The adopted daugher of Arcadia's leading researcher into Dragon Sickness. A shame, then, that she's got an awful case of it herself. While Mio struggles to fight dragons herself due to her illness, or provide tactical support to other hunters, she's become a staple around the NODENS headquarters as a constant supporter of those fighting for the Dragon Chronicle cause. It's rumored that someone who eats one of Mio's fresh baked cookies can kill three times the number of dragons than usual.\n\nISDFYORITOMO\n\nROLEcommander of the isdf dragon hunting branch\n\nRANKrank-a samurai\n\nAGEforty-six\n\nPRONOUNShe / him\n\nSPECIEShuman\n\nCHARACTER BLURB A soldier whose exploits preceed him in the world of military affairs, although it doesn't take another soldier to understand the aging man's skill both on the battlefield and as a tactician. Yoritomo was supposedly relocated to the dragon branch after having an affair with one of the ISDF's scanner prototypes, though whatever became of the woman or the child that supposedly came of it is unclear. He works as a mentor for Yuma and new ISDF recruits.\n\nISDFYUMA\n\nROLEliving anti-dragon weapon\n\nRANKrank-s destroyer\n\nAGEtwelve\n\nPRONOUNShe / him\n\nSPECIESeraser\n\nCHARACTER BLURB Product of the ISDF's latest and most polished line of Erasers, Yuma is a literal killing machine wrapped up to look and act – and feel – like a living person. Most people, however, find it hard to compare the monster he makes in combat with the sweet smiling young man he is in person. In truth, he feels pressured to live up to his superiors' expectations as a perfect weapon, and views other hunters, particularly other erasers as unwanted competition.\n\nISDFMIKI\n\nROLEisdf rookie recruit\n\nRANKrank-d psychic\n\nAGEeighteen\n\nPRONOUNSshe / her\n\nSPECIEShuman\n\nCHARACTER BLURB The latest descendant of a family of artists, musicians, and idols dating back to Murakumo's infamous pop sensation of similar name. While other members of the Hatsune lineage revel in the arts, Miki's talents lie in her wellspring of latent psychic abilities. After accidentally letting loose a mental explosion in a public area, ISDF members detained her as a threat to herself and her surroundings, but later offered her the chance to work with the group to fine tune her powers. She holds little love for the group, but the work is better than staying locked up in a cage.\n\nISDFLUNA\n\nROLEdragon hunter\n\nRANKrank-c trickster\n\nAGEunknown\n\nPRONOUNSshe / her\n\nSPECIEShuman\n\nCHARACTER BLURB ISDF’s Luna is a common mystery. Though she attests that she is actually human, she has never been seen as anything other than a small, short-haired, black cat. Lazy, apathetic, and not particularly motivated to do anything, she is often seen lying around camp and sun-bathing. Despite her lackluster behavior, she seems to be held favorably by the ISDF higher-ups. There are rumors that she is a spy for the ISDF, though the validity of said rumors is questionable at best. Insists to be called Nyanka.\n\nMILITIAEIGUR\n\nROLEcaptain of the cladeon militia\n\nRANKrank-b rune knight\n\nAGEtwenty-one\n\nPRONOUNShe / him\n\nSPECIESlucier\n\nCHARACTER BLURB Once a squire to a castle knight, Eigur was close friends with the then Princess Ulania until their secret friendship was revealed and he was sent back to the Lower Ward Cladeon. Still, Eigur kept up his squire training, becoming a talented enough knight in his own right and a vocal protester to high born society. When dragons appeared in the Cladeon forge, he banded together locals to form the early Militia, which now seeks to relinquish power from the nobility – and defeat Nyala at the same time. Has many good ideas, but doesn't know how to execute them.\n\nATLANTISULANIA\n\nROLEqueen of atlantis\n\nRANKrank-d fortuner\n\nAGEtwenty\n\nPRONOUNSshe / her\n\nSPECIESlucier\n\nCHARACTER BLURB The recently appointed queen of Atlantis. Due to the average lifespans of the lucier and the sudden, young death of the former king, Ulania was ill-prepared for taking up the throne, never mind during such turbulent times. While she's best known for her compassion, her uncertainty of how to properly rule and her eagerness to please has her giving into the nobility's plans to destroy Atlantis, regardless of her feelings on the matter. Can come across as snooty, but really, she just doesn't really know how to talk to people.\n\nATLANTISTALLIERI\n\nROLEretainer to the throne\n\nRANKrank-a fortuner\n\nAGEninety-three\n\nPRONOUNShe / him\n\nSPECIESlucier\n\nCHARACTER BLURB Tallieri has served the throne, namely the late King, since his boyhood, and there's arguably no one in Atlantis more dedicated to it, its rulers, and its retention than the retainer. He has a strong sense of duty to the people, contrasted by his sharp and unkind words and his apparent distaste for low borns. All of this, however, alongside his plans for the destruction of Atlantis is – at least, in his mind – done for the greater good of all lucier and the memory of the liege he could not protect. He has no patience for foreign hunters.\n\nGUILDEMEL\n\nROLElegendary dragon hunter\n\nRANKrank-s samurai\n\nAGEunknown\n\nPRONOUNSshe / her\n\nSPECIEShypnos\n\nCHARACTER BLURB Notorious as the leader of Murakumo, the dragon hunting group that defeated Fomulhaut in what was once Tokyo. Alongside her sister, Aytel, she has lived for time immeasurable, seeking the destruction of all dragon life as penance for a long-lost tragedy as one of the only two remaining hypnos. Emel is more than consumed with her work, holding little interest in things that don't involve killing dragons and those outside of her guild, but the people of Babylon hold infinite respect for her and her accomplishments.\n\nBABYLONAYTEL\n\nROLElegendary dragon hunter\n\nRANKrank-s mage\n\nAGEunknown\n\nPRONOUNSshe / her\n\nSPECIEShypnos\n\nCHARACTER BLURB Alongside her sister, Emel, she has lived for time immeasurable, seeking an end to the dragon threat as penance for a long-lost tragedy as one of the only two remaining hypnos. Unlike Emel, Aytel cares little for bloodying her hands, and grows ever more tired of their millennia-old feud with dragon kind. The hypnos wanders Babylon in search of a new purpose, but finds herself unable to reach out to new people, shackled by the memories old friends that have died many, many years ago.\n\nGUILDSILAS\n\nROLEthe brains of babylon\n\nRANKrank-a mage\n\nAGEtwenty-six\n\nPRONOUNShe / him\n\nSPECIEShuman\n\nCHARACTER BLURB A scholar before all else, Silas stands apart from other members of the Hunter's Guild – and most residents of Babylon, truthfully – as a man of science, rather than one of magic or brawn. He only has enough pity to spare for the friends he has made within the guild; frankly, he couldn't care less about anyone else, so long as he can still tinker with his 'toys'. Silas' main motivation for becoming a hunter was the possible prestige of creating a weapon that could kill even a True Dragon, a goal he works toward even today.\n\nGUILDBRIJILT\n\nROLEdragon hunter\n\nRANKrank-a banisher\n\nAGEtwenty-five\n\nPRONOUNSshe / her\n\nSPECIEShuman\n\nCHARACTER BLURB A street rat and thief who was caught stealing from the Guild's treasury, now grown up to be one of its finest hunters. Defying all logic, Brijilt maintains something of a rose-tinted gaze when it comes to the glory and honor of slaying dragons – perhaps overcompensating for a not-at-all-honorable childhood – and tends to be one of the first to charge head-first into the fray. Due to Silas' usefulness and lack of physical prowess, Brijilt often plays brawn to his brains, and the two are rarely seen apart from each other in the field.\n\nGUILDNAGIRI\n\nROLEdragon hunter\n\nRANKrank-b samurai\n\nAGEseventy-nine\n\nPRONOUNSshe / her\n\nSPECIESlucier\n\nCHARACTER BLURB After her village was razed by dragons, Nagiri was saved by the Hunter's Guild, particularly Emel, who Nagiri has come to think of a mother. While often the odd man out in a cast of quirky characters, considering her rather wallflower nature, there are few more loyal to the cause – or its leader, at the very least – than the lucier woman. She's been with the Guild for longer than most of its current members, due to the job's high mortality rate, and helps mentor fresh recruits with dry humor and brutally honest critique.\n\nTIMELINES\n\nTHE HISTORIES OF SYNC/RONICITY\n\nA general outline of important events leading up to the current years across Arcadia, Atlantis, and Babylon is outlined below. While you are not expected to have every date here memorized, a general understanding of developments and when they happened will keep character motivations and backgrounds consistent. Please be sure to read each timeline over at least once.\n\narcadia - 2515 AD\n\n2329 AD Dragonsbane begins blooming for the first time in the modern area in the city of Tokyo. Authorized special division Murakumo is formed under their leader, Emel, to combat the new dragon threat. Dragon appearances nationwide decimate towns and cities on a near unprecedented scale, spreading fear of a potential worldwide epidemic. 2331 AD True Dragon Fomulhaut lands at Tokyo's City Hall and is neutralized by Murakumo Unit 13. Reconstruction of Japan efforts begin shortly after. 2349 AD Fear of recurring dragon assaults results in the formation of a strengthened intergovernmental organization, the United Earth Government (UEG). Remaining Murakumo members are adopteded into the newly established International Self-Defense Force (ISDF). Construction of the UEG's headquarters-to-be, Arcadia, begins on the remains of Tokyo. 2414 AD Arcadia becomes the highest populated city on the globe, as well as the spearhead for technological evolution. City officials break affiliation with the UEG and ISDF, whose headquarters relocate overseas to northern Europe. 2488 AD Moore's Law dies. Advancement in many fields (medical, military, et cetera) begins to grind to a halt. Scholars claim the 'peak of humanity' has been reached. 2490 AD NODENS Enterprises patents its earliest virtual reality software. CEO Allie 'happens upon' a True Dragon Iod specimen while 'vacationing' in South America. ISDF forces excavate a True Dragon Nyala specimen in South Asia not long after. NODENS' first successful time machine prototype is built. 2514 AD Dragonsbane begins blooming for the second time in the modern area in the heart of Arcadia. The ISDF's dragon hunting branch is temporarily relocated to the city; NODENS officially launches the virtual reality game Seventh Encount to scout for hunter recruits. 2515 AD Site start. NODENS and the ISDF treaty for shared access to True Dragon specimen and free use for both parties of the fully functional time machine. Links to Atlantis and Babylon are established, and the Dragon Chronicle effort begins.\n\natlantis - 7238 BC\n\n9618 BC Leftover power from True Dragon Iod creates an unnatural underwater dome, maintained by stone artifact called Great Stars. Land-dwelling Lucier migrate below ground, establishing settlements that will eventually form the nation of Atlantis. 7239 BC Dragonsbane beings blooming in the Atlantian dome. High Dragons destroy much of the country and the outer rims of the capital city, Atlantica. His Majesty, the King, leads nearly all of the Royal Guard into battle against a slumbering True Dragon Nyala, and not one of them returns alive. Morale nationwide plummets to nothing. 7238 BC Site start. Heir Ulania is crowned Queen of Atlantis. While the nobility plans to destroy the Great Stars, collapsing Atlantis's dome and taking Nyala with them, dissent in the Lower Ward leads to the formation of the Cladeon Militia, who gladly accept the aid of foreigners from Arcadia and Babylon.\n\nbabylon - 8794 AD\n\n8695 AD True Dragon Haze appears atop the Ladyin Ruins. While Babylon's finest hunters are unable to deal a fatal blow, mechanics and magicians from the city of Preloma work together to seal the True Dragon to the top of the tower, disabling it from wrecking havoc across the country. 8696 AD Despite Haze's immobility, High Dragon, low dragon, dragonsbane, and turned activity continue across the land. Hunters are no longer able to even attempt to kill the True Dragon due to the nature of its imprisonment. 8710 AD A settlement formed by a single hunter in the heart of dragon territory gains the attention of fellow hunters, then refugees of nearby fallen towns. Kazan is established as an independent state that will grow in size and influence to become the eventual Kazan Republic. 8727 AD Emel takes interest in Kazan and opens her Hunter's Guild there. Veteran and novice hunters alike swarm to the new guild, furthering Kazan's development. Preloma, Babylon's most advanced and defensive city, falls to High Dragons. 8794 AD Site start. Seismic activity near the Ladyin Ruins leads scholars to believe the seal holding True Dragon Haze is nearing its break point. Dragon activity skyrockets, and hunting guilds across Babylon grow more desperate as their numbers continue to thin.\n\nGLOSSARY\n\nWORDS TO KNOW HERE ON SYNC/RONICITY\n\nThere are terms that get tossed around in SYNC/'s information, as well as by characters within its universe that members should be aware of the meaning to. Most characters should have at least a basic understanding of what each term means, themselves, although knowledge may be dependent on a character's origin and where the term itself originates from.\n\nCHRONS\n\nCHRONS are special techniques that Dragon hunters use in the course of battle. While every living creature has the potential to develop a chron, very few manage to, and public knowledge of their very existance is practically non-existent. Chrons manifest differently in different individuals, and at differing times, although the key to awakening one – and later, more – is vigorous training of the mind and/or body. Hunters are far more likely to have chrons manifest simply due to the nature of their work, and what sort of chrons they acquire varies to fit their psyche, as well as their specific class knowledge.\n\nOut of character, chrons unlock at ranks D, B, and S, and members may purchase two extra from the store at any time for a total cap of five. Chrons are limited by class specialties, but may otherwise be any power of the player's choosing, so long as they are cleared by staff first.\n\nMAGIC + AFFINITIES\n\nSeparate from chrons is the existence of magic which, like chrons, is rare, but unlike chrons cannot be cast by just anyone. Lucier, on average, are more likely to have the capacity for magic usage than humans or their synthetic counterparts, but even with rigorous training, not all of them will ever be able to tap into its potential. Magic users are sorted into five affinities from birth, which cannot be expanded on or changed: fire, water, earth, air, and restoration. Both in and out of battle, these affinities dictate the sort of magic a user can cast, while a hunter's class determines how skillfully and powerfully they are able to utilize that magic.\n\nHow magic manifests depends on the user, but the amount and strength of one’s magic is determined by class indicators of “weak,” “moderate,” and “powerful.” Generally speaking, multi-target classes are better with magic that affects a wider area, but is less concentrated and therefore weaker; single-target classes are better with magic that has a narrower radius of effect, but is more concentrated and therefore 'potent.' How a user casts their magic is largely freeform and up to the player, so long as they don't deviate too far from the caster's class-based power level.\n\nRANKING SYSTEM\n\nRanks are a rough approximation of a character's skill in Dragon hunting, starting from rank E, working backward through letters up to A, and ending on the highest ranking, S. Ranks are not a be-all-end-all show of strength – someone who's better at fighting Dragons than a teammate, for example, may be worse at fighting another person – but often a general scaling of power, and more importantly experience.\n\nOn SYNC/, characters may start as ranks E, D, or C based on their background experience, so not every character needs to start out a rookie. Completion of threads and side quests, as well as event participation will net characters EXP, which is required to be maxed out at one hundred before the character can purchase the 'rank up' option from our store. New characters can technically start out at higher ranks by using the return by death option, the details of which can be found in the Death Records tab.\n\nLOW DRAGONS\n\nLOW DRAGONS are often referred to as just 'Dragons' without a prefix. Low Dragons are created by High Dragons, and are the most common form of Dragon to appear during True Dragon landings. Due to the wide variety in appearances all Dragons, regardless of the rank they have, Low Dragons are most easily identified by size: as the smallest of the three ranks, they generally stand anywhere between ten and fifteen feet tall. Despite sharing a name with the creature of folklore, Low Dragons – alongside High and True Dragons – do not always look like our basic understanding of a 'dragon' in media. Some look more like insects, fish, or birds than winged reptiles. It's even suspected that a Dragon could take on a humanoid appearance, though no such example has been documented.\n\nHIGH DRAGONS\n\nHIGH DRAGONS are Dragons second only to the True Dragon that creates them. When a True Dragon begins its landing, before it has ever materialized on Earth, its High Dragons will appear first, often as the first sign of direct danger. A single one is powerful enough to raze an entire city to the ground, assuming it is left unchecked. Like other ranks of Dragons, they are most easily identifiable by size: even the smallest will stand no shorter than twenty feet, with some of the tallest standing at about twenty-five.\n\nTRUE DRAGONS\n\nTRUE DRAGONS are beasts considered to be the apocalypse incarnate. There are seven of them total, scattered across time and space, with power that increases as their number grows higher. True Dragons create High Dragons and Dragonsbane, both of which often appear long before the True Dragon itself materializes. Each one has the destructive capability to level the entire world, although it's believed by the lucier that they can grant life as much as they can steal it. True Dragons, as the highest in the hierarchy, are the largest, and stand at roughly forty-five feet tall. Killing the root True Dragon will cause its subordinates – Dragons, Dragonsbane, and Turned alike – to disperse as slowly as they initially appeared.\n\nDRAGONSBANE\n\nDRAGONSBANE is a type of flower that blooms prior to a True Dragon's arrival, and are often the first sign of the Dragon's inevitable appearance. These massive plants can grow in seemingly any environment and are incredibly hard to remove, with more popping up where one has been plucked. Dragonsbane have two major effects on the life around them:\n\na) In humans, they cause victims to fall sick with Dragons Sickness;\n\nb) In all other plants and animals, they mutate life into creatures known as the Turned.\n\nHow these things occur is unknown, although the closer that one remains to a Dragonsbane bloom, and the longer, the more likely they are to be impacted by it. Likelihood of infection, the extremity of mutation, and rarity increases in the following order of bloom color: red, blue, and finally white.\n\nTHE TURNED\n\nTHE TURNED are plants and animals that have fallen victim to Dragonsbane's mutational effect. While the Turned cannot compare to even the weakest Dragon in terms of strength, more people on average fall to the Turned due to the sheer number of them. Mutations differ between victim, with resulting Turned looking just as varied as the Dragons, but all Turned are united in their disfigured appearances and insatiable blood lust.\n\nDRAGON SICKNESS\n\nDRAGON SICKNESS is an illness that arises in humans with prolonged exposure to Dragonsbane. The most identifying symptom is the cough, which starts simple – often mistaken for any old cold – and progresses into something bloody and life threatening. Dragon Sickness is not contagious from an infected person to a healthy one, although the less informed will treat patients as though it is. The sickness appears to manifest slower in some than others, and some individuals are completely immune to its effects; dragon hunters in particular almost never succumb to the disease. There is no known cure, but the brightest minds in Arcadia have created a pricey medicine that can lessen the severity of its symptoms. Ultimately, however, the Sickness is a death sentence; its only sure fire cure is the destruction of the True Dragon that caused it.\n\nTHE LADYIN\n\nTHE LADYIN is an ancient tower, older than life itself, that appears in both Atlantis and Babylon. Whiles its origins are unclear, it is considered holy grounds by lucier of both past and future. Only royalty are allowed inside its walls in Atlantis, and many countries in the continent of Babylon fight for control over its ruins.\n\nGREAT STARS\n\nGREAT STARS are stone artifacts created from the remains of True Dragon Iod. These massive diamond-shaped artifacts are what create the unique structure of Atlantis, suspending the land formations that the lucier have built their nation on, while maintaining the dome that separates Atlantis from the surrounding ocean. There are seven total scattered throughout the dome, the destruction of any of which can threaten the integrity of the dome – and the destruction of all of which would tear down the whole of Atlantis without fail.\n\nMEMBER GROUPS\n\nDRAGON HUNTING ORGANIZATIONS ON SYNC/RONICITY\n\nCharacters are sorted into member groups depending on which group of Dragon hunters they have chosen to affiliate with. While each group works together, at least to some degree with shared use of the time machine and similar goals of Dragon extermination, members can only sign off their loyalty to one. Hunters will often align themselves with the group(s) that originate in their timeline – those from Atlantis joining Atlantis' Cladeon Militia, those from Babylon joining Babylon's Hunter's Guild, and so on – but there are no strict rules stating that your place of origin dictates your affiliation, and while outsiders may not be readily accepted by everyone, they will never be turned down. At the time of our site opening, all member-played characters are hunters, meaning there is no group for characters who live out their lives as civilians, although that may be subject to change in the future.\n\nBelow each group description is a general 'feeling' of the group as a whole. Characters are not expected to fit these loose definitions too a 't' by any means – or even at all – but they may help you to decide where your personalities will fit best.\n\nnodens enterprises\n\nStationed out of Arcadia, NODENS is an independent gaming company credited to the creation of the time machine and the virtual reality game Seventh Encount, which NODENS uses as a front to scout out potential Dragon hunter recruits. Why a gaming company of all things has designs for the end of Dragon life is anyone's guess, but they are notorious for finding hunters with great potential from the most unlikely of places. Because of its roots in the gaming industry, the headquarters in Arcadia are filled with strange and fun things to do for hunters, founded in a belief that high morale breeds better results.\n\nThe NODENS group has a strong sense of family; its leadership takes great strides to make each individual member feel welcomed and included, and both old and new recruits are very supportive of one another.\n\ninternational self-defense force\n\nStations out of Arcadia, as well, the ISDF is a long-established military that serves countries across the globe who ally themselves with the UEG. The ISDF was originally built from the foundation of the famous Dragon hunting organization Murakumo, but in modern times, the dedicated Dragon hunting branch is incredibly small, due in no small part to the lack of a Dragon threat in nearly two centuries. Not every ISDF-affiliated hunter is military grade, then: because of a need for personnel, the group has opened their doors to fresh recruits, though while their regimen is nowhere near as strict as soldiers in other branches, even fresh blood from the ISDF are drilled harder than those in any other group.\n\nThe ISDF's leadership prides itself on discipline, working under the idea that proper preparation can win any battle, and that straying from orders is a flight risk to all parties involved. Members are not given proper military training, but are handled in a similar manner to soldiers, no less.\n\ncladeon militia\n\nFormed in the Lower Ward of Atlantis, the Militia got its start as a rag-tag team of able bodied farmers and miners seeking to take back their home from invading High Dragons. Members of the Militia typically share a distaste for Atlantean high born society – particularly now that the nobility plans to destroy the nation as a whole without the consent of the Lower Ward – and believe that True Dragons can be defeated with enough grit and determination. The group's earliest members lack any kind of training when it comes to battle, and an outsider's look makes it the most hodgepodge batch of the lot.\n\nAll it takes to overcome is determination, as mentioned before; the Militia's goals and team are driven by this idea, and outsiders would argue that it's all that keeps them in the game.\n\nhunter's guild\n\nWhile there are many hunter guilds located in Babylon, there is only one Hunter's Guild – denoted by capital letters – and it is often the first one citizens of Babylon think of when guilds come up in conversation. After nearly a century spent in an aggressive battle with Dragonkind with no hope for an end in sight, various groups like the Hunter's Guild have sprung up across the land, opening their doors to both trained fighters and disgruntled youth, almost all with a personal grudge against True Dragon Haze and his lackeys. In Babylon, more than anywhere, people know that Dragon hunting is not a job taken lightly; taking orders from the world famous Emel, recruits of the Guild often have little left to lose, or are motivated by their hatred for Dragons more than anything else.\n\nBecause their leader is absorbed with the idea of vengeance, so, too, do members of the guild lend themselves to a desire for 'an eye for an eye'. Their violence isn't thoughtless, but perhaps more than any other group, it is personal.\n\nHUNTER CLASSES\n\nROLES YOU CAN TAKE AT SYNC/RONICITY\n\nCharacters are sorted into different classes, which determines their preferred fighting style, weapon type, and – most concretely – their specialties. Hunters do not necessarily need to follow class descriptions perfectly, and may even use a different sort of weapon than the recommended type (with the exception of some classes), but specialties are non-negotiable. Members may purchase additional classes and specialties from the site store, and characters will be able to swap between any class they own the specialty of at any time they so choose. Premium classes must be purchased from the store, either before a character has been made (to start out as that class) or as a class/specialty addition after acceptance.\n\nClasses are sorted into 'play styles' to give a general idea of what role they may have on the battle field, although these are – again – not strict guidelines, so much as a general idea. Fighter refers to classes whose main focus is dealing as much damage to the enemy as possible; rogue refers to classes that avoid taking damage as much as possible; tank refers to classes that sponge as much damage as possible; and support refers to classes that buff allies and/or debuff the enemy.\n\nSAMURAI\n\nMasters of all manner of blade - from the katana the name would imply to broadswords, rapiers, and nearly every sword under the sun. Samurai are reliable in battle, both in their ability to take a hit and their ability to dish 'hits' out; they are generally light on their feet, and best in close-quarters combat. Members of this class may single or dual-wield.\n\nSPECIALTY swordfaire - chrons that apply to or are activated through the user's sword\n\nPLAY STYLE fighter\n\nWEAPON swords (cannot substitute for another type of weapon, but may be any type of sword)\n\nMAGIC unavailable\n\nAGENT\n\nFrom highly trained members of Arcadia's most secretive organizations to self-taught hackers spinning in their office chairs, Agents boast the most technical prowess of all classes, and definitely know their way with a gun. Best on the fringe of the battle field, Agents reign terror on the enemy with 2515 AD's finest technology.\n\nSPECIALTY biohack - chrons that allow for manipulation of the turned\n\nPLAY STYLE fighter or rogue\n\nWEAPON guns (type may vary)\n\nMAGIC unavailable\n\nGOD HAND\n\nBrawlers before all else. God Hands storm the battle field with fists blazing, standing firm even against the strongest of enemies. Members of this class are not all brawn without brain, however - a proper God Hand is trained as much in the art of medical aid as in fighting, and is always available to help the wounded in a pinch.\n\nSPECIALTY compound - chrons that become more effective with successive attacks\n\nPLAY STYLE tank\n\nWEAPON brass knuckles\n\nMAGIC weak, single-target only\n\nDUELIST\n\nMasters of monsters that materialize and fight at the user's beck and call, the Duelist class is unique in its ability to summon various creatures of various skills through the use of a physical catalyst. Trading cards, plush animals, a glittering stone - you name it. Once the master is gone, however, so, too, is the monster; best to keep to the fringe of combat.\n\nNOTE, members of this class begin with one extra chron, regardless of rank, with chrons that manifest as independent summoning of different effects; chron limit remains five.\n\nSPECIALTY summoning - chrons that manifest as unique summons\n\nPLAY STYLE varies depending on summons\n\nWEAPON catalysts (will vary)\n\nMAGIC unavailable\n\nRUNE KNIGHT\n\nRune Knights are the protectors of the battlefield, boasting excellent durability that comes at the price of their mobility. Those trained in the rune arts are typically proficient in magic, but no more than they are skilled with a lance in hand. In combat, their mix of physical and magical offense is a sight to behold.\n\nSPECIALTY enchantment - chrons that can be temporarily applied to other people or objects\n\nPLAY STYLE tank\n\nWEAPON lances\n\nMAGIC moderate, single-target only\n\nFORTUNER\n\nMagic wielders most notable for their ability to thin crowds. The Fortuner class, despite often being some of the most fragile on the battlefield are experts at taking on large numbers of enemies at once through great swings of their scythes, wide-spread magical attacks, or their unique ability to impair the opposition with their specialty.\n\nSPECIALTY breakdown - chrons that inflict 'statuses' or ailments upon enemy contact\n\nPLAY STYLE support\n\nWEAPON scythes\n\nMAGIC moderate, multi-target only\n\nMAGE\n\nAlthough you'd never catch them dead in a one-on-one brawl of physical might, Mages are warmly welcomed into any group, either as some of the most offensive powerhouses or much-needed medical aid. Mages differ from one another depending on affinity, but all are bound together by their passion for magic... if not their lack of physique.\n\nSPECIALTY arcane - chrons that can alter user or enemy magic\n\nPLAY STYLE fighter or support\n\nWEAPON staves\n\nMAGIC powerful, single- or multi-target\n\nBANISHER\n\nPyrotechnics who storm the battlefield with massive guns blazing. A banisher's role on the field is to demolish everything in sight, making them welcome additions to long-ranged fighting groups, but bad partners for short-ranged fighters. Most are physically strong and can take damage as well as its dealt.\n\nSPECIALTY ballistic - chrons that can be applied to or activated through the user's firearms\n\nPLAY STYLE tank\n\nWEAPON mortars (may only be substituted with other types of firearms)\n\nMAGIC unavailable\n\nDESTROYER – PREMIUM CLASS\n\nArguably the hardest hitters of the lot, Destroyers are a berserker-type class that eats up damage to turn against the enemy. While they may not be as defense as some of their more tank-like alternatives, no one revels in up close and savage combat like members of this class, and no one can tear apart an enemy like a Destroyer pushed to their limit.\n\nSPECIALTY retaliate - chrons that become more powerful the more damage the user incurs\n\nPLAY STYLE fighter\n\nWEAPON war hammers\n\nMAGIC unavailable\n\nTRICKSTER – PREMIUM CLASS\n\nThe fastest of all classes, and potentially the hardest to pin down, tricksters dominate the field by weaving through it as a needle through fabric. While they are terribly frail, their chrons allow them to walk from most battles without taking a grazing hit, and their quick, successive attacks can pile on damage as well as another class's single strike.\n\nSPECIALTY phantasm - chrons that alter the enemy's perception\n\nPLAY STYLE rogue\n\nWEAPON knives\n\nMAGIC unavailable\n\nPSYCHIC – PREMIUM CLASS\n\nHunters who have manifested psychic abilities - anything from telekinesis to telepathy to clairvoyance to psychokinesis to... well, you get the idea. Often ill suited for the front lines, Psychics use their brain power to confuse, outsmart, or outright destroy the opposition from the fringe of ally lines.\n\nNOTE, members of this class begin with one extra chron, regardless of rank, with chrons that manifest as independent psychic abilities of different effects; chron limit remains five.\n\nSPECIALTY esp - chrons that manifest as unique psychic abilities\n\nPLAY STYLE varies depending on psychic abilities\n\nWEAPON none\n\nMAGIC powerful, single-target only\n\nIDOL – PREMIUM CLASS\n\nA true modern day bard. Speed, strength, and longitude varies depending on the hunter, but Idols are united by their love of the arts, and skills to impressive in them that hunters around them can't help but be motivated to do better by hearing or seeing them - and enemies are discouraged by being on the opposing side.\n\nSPECIALTY entertain - chrons that are activated through types of performance\n\nPLAY STYLE support\n\nWEAPON none\n\nMAGIC weak, single- or multi-target\n\nPLAYABLE RACES\n\nTHE COLORFUL CAST OF SYNC/RONICITY\n\nTapping into the past and the future has allowed for more than just humankind to excel at Dragon hunting; on SYNC/, hunters may be any one of four different humanoid races.\n\nHUMANS\n\nEasily the most populated race of the batch, humans are... well, humans. They dominate the census of Arcadia almost entirely – and, as far as the public is concerned, are the only beings that exist there – and take up almost sixty-five percent of the population of Babylon of the future. Humans are not as naturally inclined to magic as other races, but pride themselves on 'getting up again once knocked down', closing the gap through sheer force of will.\n\nHumans may not originate from Atlantis, due to its exclusively lucier population.\n\nLUCIER\n\nAn ancient race that lived underwater and fell with the destruction of Atlantis. An unknown event brought them back sometime after the time of Arcadia, resulting in the presence of lucier in Babylon (taking up roughly thirty-five percent of the population). Lucier are more magically inclined than humans. In Atlantis, where the lucier originate, bloodlines mean everything, and while they do no worship any specific gods, their worship of the Great Stars that keep their country alive leads them to revere them almost like deities themselves. In Babylon, without class divide or Great Stars, lucier's culture is near indistinguishable from that of humans. While lucier are generally humanoid in appearance, there are several defining features that set them apart:\n\na) Lucier mature at the same time and rate as humans, but can live to be several centuries longer, capping at roughly 400 years of age. Their bodies do not begin to deteriorate from old age until reaching 300, leading to lucier who have lived for more than two hundred years looking as though they're barely thirty years old.\n\nb) Lucier have different ears than humans. Some are born with almost elf-like ears, pointed at the tips and extending a bit further from the sides of the head. Others are born, instead, with animal-like ears – most often feline in nature – that protrude from the top of the head. In Atlantian culture, animal-like ears are a sign of high blooded lineage (being the dominant trait), whereas elf-like ears are a sign of low blooded lineage.\n\nc) Lucier stand taller than human on average, with the shortest often standing no smaller than five and a half feet at maturity and the tallest standing at around eight feet even.\n\nLucier may not originate from Arcadia, due to the fact that no lucier have been born in that time frame for millennia. Lucier who originate from Atlantis and lucier who originate from Babylon are likely to have very different attitudes toward the world, humankind, and other lucier.\n\nERASERS + SCANNERS - PREMIUM RACES\n\nSynthetic humans created by the ISDF. There is little different physically between scanners and erasers, with their key difference lying in the purpose they were created for. While not technically human, each species is quite close; they aren't mechanical, but made of flesh and bone and blood just like the creatures they were created in the image of. One was born; one started from a test tube; it's as simple as that. Both erasers and scanners are 'born' at full maturity, and do not tend to live long enough to see any signs of aging; due to a scanner's weak body and the dangers of hunting for erasers, few live past three years, although the max life span of either is predicted to be little more than decade. Specifications of erasers and scanners may differ between the year they were made and their specific creator, however, leaving for some wiggle room in individual characters; please consult staff with any such ideas.\n\nErasers are designed specifically for combat purposes, resulting in a more powerful body than any human could hope to achieve. In battle, a single eraser is intended to take the place of two dozen trained soldiers. As a downside, however, their 'frames' require continuous maintenance, and while their mental storage allows for plenty of knowledge of the ins and outs of combat, they leave little room for 'superfluous' information. Mostly brawn, little brain, essentially. Scanners, on the other hand, are designed specifically for their heightened intellect, super computers with the empathy and morality of a human mind. Early scanners were designed as tacticians or problem solvers, forbade from front lines due to their incredibly frail bodies. Mostly brain, then, and little brawn.\n\nErasers and scanners may only originate from Arcadia, since the technology required to create them only exists there. Both are most likely to ally themselves with the ISDF, being as they are kept on a tight leash, but some may be gifted to other groups in a show of good faith, or – rarer – some may have escaped and joined of their own will.\n\nDRAGON HUNTING\n\nTAKING DOWN MONSTERS ON SYNC/RONICITY\n\nSYNC/ functions on largely free-form battles. Most combat will take place during events and in Side Quest threads, the former of which will be moderated by staff and the latter of which will be largely member run. Members may also utilize the Turned threat in and out of Side Quest threads for thread conflict, but dragons will not appear unless staff-controlled or forewarned in a Side Quest description.\n\nHIGH DRAGON SIGHTINGS\n\nEvery so often, a High Dragon will land somewhere in Atlantis, Arcadia, or Babylon. High Dragon sightings will take place within one group thread with optional participation: hunters will work together to take down the High Dragon in a series of death-enabled rounds, where rewards for participation will increase based on the number of rounds the hunter has posted in. Characters may either work together with other participating characters, building off of existing posts, or jump in solo between other hunters, to alleviate the pressure of trying to find a posting partner within a large thread. High Dragon sightings will be updated in the second tab of our site's banner.\n\nTRUE DRAGON LANDINGS\n\nThe countdown in our banner's first tab refers to how long in real time members have to prepare for a True Dragon's landing. In character, a total of two True Dragon specimens have already been collected, meaning that there will be a total of five True Dragon landings over the course of the RP. How long until the dragon arrives will not change save for the passing of days. Between the time when a landing has been announced and the landing commences, a check list of objectives will be found in the mission updates board. While not mandatory, the more objectives that are completed before the landing, the greater the reward for the defeat of the True Dragon will be.\n\nBattles will take place in week-long 'waves', broken up into groups. For example: for week one, members of NODENS will participate in a group thread against the True Dragon; for week two, members of the Hunter's Guild will participate in a similar thread; et cetera, culminating in the final week, where any member regardless of affiliation may join in a single free-for-all. The character who posted most over this five week period will be allowed to deal the finishing blow, and – like High Dragon landings – participation rewards will increase based on the number of rounds the hunter posted in.\n\nRETURN BY DEATH\n\nWhile not every aspect of the forum is death-enabled, a large numbers of major Dragon fighting events and side quests are in reflection of the high mortality rates of the hunting job. Players can technically avoid death-enabled quests and events if they would prefer to keep their characters alive with no threat of sudden death, but playing risky will yield higher rewards, and death as a mechanic is an encouraged part of the site.\n\nWhen a character dies in a thread, they will be sorted into the 'Deceased' member group and no longer count toward your character limit. They can, however, continue to finish threads, RP in threads taking place before their time of death, and RP in AU threads to their leisure. As an added bonus, while experience will not cross over, their rank and site shop items can be inherited by existing or new characters. This is evoking the return by death option. For example: your rank A character with two extra classes and an extra chron slot dies; your next character can start with two extra classes of their choosing, an extra chron slot, and may be any rank between E and A. For more detail about recording deceased characters' perks and how to claim them for subsequent characters, see the Death Records.\n\nTHE DRAGON CHRONICLE\n\n1ST DRAGONIOD\n\nDESIGNATIONthe progenitor dragon\n\nDATE OF LANDINGunknown\n\nLOCATION OF LANDINGunknown\n\nDATE OF SLAYINGunknown\n\nNAME OF SLAYERunknown\n\nGATHERED INFORMATION Little is known about the original True Dragon: what it looked like, where it landed, when it landed, or even how it died. Vestiges of its existences took the form of the Great Stars of Atlantis, but some believe that Iod's life and death gave rise to more than just the dome that would become Atlantis, going so far as to say its landing was what allowed for the creation of the earliest lifeforms on Earth.\n\n2ND DRAGONCODE ND\n\nDESIGNATIONthe maternal dragon\n\nDATE OF LANDINGunknown\n\nLOCATION OF LANDINGunknown\n\nDATE OF SLAYINGto be determined\n\nNAME OF SLAYERto be determined\n\nGATHERED INFORMATION A mythological figure that has appeared in numerous ancient cultures, all described in the same way. While there is no concrete evidence that these aren't just coincidence, Arcadian's believe that each sighting was of the same ancient True Dragon, hiding from humanity for countless generations. Where it is now, or even if it truly exists remains unknown. Its designation comes from folklore older than text.\n\n3RD DRAGONNYALA\n\nDESIGNATION the sublime dragon\n\nDATE OF LANDING to be determined\n\nLOCATION OF LANDING atlantis\n\nDATE OF SLAYING to be determined\n\nNAME OF SLAYER to be determined\n\nGATHERED INFORMATION A greater winged beast with an exterior colored gold and innards decorated in gemstones and jewelry. Nyala is a wonderful sight to behold, but an avaricious creature who seeks to destroy all beauty of the world; there can be nothing left that would rival its glorious appearance. This True Dragon is set to land at the base of the Ladyin in Atlantis.\n\n4TH DRAGONFOMALHAUT\n\nDESIGNATIONthe divine dragon\n\nDATE OF LANDING2331 AD\n\nLOCATION OF LANDINGtokyo, japan\n\nDATE OF SLAYING2331 AD\n\nNAME OF SLAYERtsubaki kujo\n\nGATHERED INFORMATION The first True Dragon to descend during the modern era, back when the land Arcadia sits on now was still called Tokyo. Fomalhaut genuinely believed itself to be a god – the only god, in its own eyes – and destroyed nearly all of the country of Japan before its defeat at the hands of Murakumo dragon hunters. Stories of Fomalhaut are still used in Arcadia to keep children in line – and to remind humanity how fragile it truly is.\n\n5TH DRAGONHAZE\n\nDESIGNATIONthe champion dragon\n\nDATE OF LANDING8695 AD\n\nLOCATION OF LANDINGbabylon\n\nDATE OF SLAYINGto be determined\n\nNAME OF SLAYERto be determined\n\nGATHERED INFORMATION The fifth True Dragon, who descended atop the Ladyin Ruins in Babylon nearly a century ago. This insect-like True Dragon could not be defeated at the time of its landing, absorbing weaponry into itself and turning them against their original wielders, and was instead sealed away, alive, at the top of the massive tower. Haze has been awake for its century of captivity and grows ever more spiteful towards its captors, biding its time before it can break its chains and repay its dues.\n\n6TH DRAGONCODE BB\n\nDESIGNATIONthe binary dragon\n\nDATE OF LANDINGto be determined\n\nLOCATION OF LANDINGto be determined\n\nDATE OF SLAYINGto be determined\n\nNAME OF SLAYERto be determined\n\nGATHERED INFORMATION Nothing is known about this creature save for the fact that it must exist – and will exist – with its landing site likely to be somewhere in Babylon. Hunters will joking claim its code name stands for 'Big Bad'.\n\n7TH DRAGONCODE VFD\n\nDESIGNATIONthe evolved one\n\nDATE OF LANDINGto be determined\n\nLOCATION OF LANDINGto be determined\n\nDATE OF SLAYINGto be determined\n\nNAME OF SLAYERto be determined\n\nGATHERED INFORMATION The final True Dragon, whose very arrival on Earth would spell out its destruction. Nothing is known about this cataclysmic monstrosity beyond that, though its Dragonsbane and Dragon lackeys have already begun their descent on an unprepared Arcadia. Can something this powerful really be stopped?\n\nAPPLICATION GUIDE\n\nGETTING CHARACTERS SET UP AT SYNC/RONICITY\n\nOn SYNC/, we've tried to make the application process relatively painless so roleplayers can jump into the action as quickly as possible. Applications are contained within your character's account, meaning there is no thread to create or forum on site containing other applications. Once your out of character account has been properly set up – please refer to the last paragraph of the Starting Up tab if you are confused about how to get that handled – you will be able to start working on character applications. Applications must be completed before posting with your character on site, including starting shippers and chron trackers. Follow these steps to complete the profile in full:\n\nWhen creating your new character account, head over to the edit sub-accounts section of your OOC account's user control panel. By clicking 'Register a New Account' here, your character account will be automatically linked up to your parent OOC account; if you have registered a character account separately, they can still be linked using the 'Link an Existing Account' form below. 100x100 icons can be uploaded in the edit avatar settings section of the control panel. Icons must be uploaded from your computer, not hot-linked with a URL. They will also resize, but please be sure to keep your images at least square in dimensions. In the 'edit profile info' section, the top fields must be filled out to proceed, but we ask that all fields be filled out – with the exception of the flavor text and links – before apps are submitted for acceptance. Please read field subheadings if you are confused, but also for uniform form completion. Application images include a 200x400 avatar and a 1100x250 banner image. Your avatar must be of your character, and is required for acceptance. Your banner image may either be of your character or an aesthetic image, and is also required for acceptance. If you are struggling to find or crop images, feel free to stop by the graphic request thread where staff will make you any image of your request. Hunters may start at ranks E, D, or C. Any submitted character attempting to pass as rank B or higher will be pended. A reminder that human characters may not originate from Atlantis, lucier characters may not originate from Arcadia, and eraser and scanner characters may only originate from Arcadia. Characters must list five traits and a percentage number between 1 and 100 to represent how strongly they exhibit said trait. They may all be positive, or may all be negative, although we prefer a mix of the two. IF you are struggling to find traits, please consult a list. Biographies are freeform. They may be as short or as long as you wish, and may be written, formatted, and styled however you so desire. While we prefer brevity (please refrain from so many thousand word bios), we ask that you write at least a solid few sentences, or a short paragraph's worth minimum. Break tags are unnecessary, but HTML is allowed. Headers and basic tags have default stylings that you may use to your leisure, as seen here. Comments may be left on other characters' accounts. When using this feature, make an IC comment on your character's feelings on the character being commented on, and only between accepted characters. Spam will be deleted and frowned upon. Once your app is completed, post in the moderation request thread or the #mod-request channel in the Discord server so staff can review it. Accepted characters must post in the face claim listings (non-claimed face claims will remain up for grabs even if a character is accepted), as well as start a chron tracker, even if they are not high enough ranked yet to qualify for one. While not required, we also recommend starting a shipper thread in our directory for ease of plotting.\n\nAWARDS LIST\n\nGOALS TO AIM FOR ON SYNC/RONICITY\n\nVarious awards can be earned for reaching certain milestones, carrying out certain acts, or participating in site events. In order to claim these awards, please post in the moderation request thread or the #mod-request channel in our Discord server with the award(s) you are claiming the proof of completion as necessary. Awards may only be earned once per account.\n\nOOC ACCOUNT AWARDS\n\nBEGINNER'S LUCK\n\nJoined during our first week. PART OF THE FURNITURE\n\nBeen a member for 1 year.
