        "text": "Page Content\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina (Bosna i Hercegovina – hereinafter BiH) declared its independence from the former Yugoslavia on 1 March 1992. The declaration of independence, which was boycotted by the Bosnian Serbs, gave rise to an armed conflict. In 1995, a peace agreement was reached with the signature of the Dayton Peace Accords in Paris, which include the BiH Constitution in its annexes.[1] The BiH Constitution instituted a multi-ethnic system of government with an asymmetrical and complex governance structure. The Presidency is composed of three members from each of the constituting nations: one Bosniak and one Croat from the FBiH and one Serb from the Republika Srpska. The Head of State is the Chairman of the Presidency and the Government is lead by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers. The Parliament is bicameral and is composed of the House of Peoples (Dom Naroda) and the House of Representatives (Predstavnicki Dom).\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina is not a member of the European Union; it participates in the Stabilisation and Association Process.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina comprises 4 tiers of governance, at the State, Entity, Canton and municipal levels:\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina: BiH shall consist of two Entities: the Republika Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Federacija Bosna i Hercegovina – hereinafter FBiH) and the Brcko District.\n\nRepublika Srpska: The Republika Srpska is a unique and indivisible constitutional and legal entity comprising one level of local self-government with 57 Municipalities.[2] [3]\n\nFBiH: The FBiH consists of ten federal units, the Cantons, which have their own Constitution, Parliament, Government and judicial powers. In total, there are eleven constitutions, governments and legislators in the FBiH (10 cantonal and one Entity). Cantons operate under the laws of FBiH as a whole. Moreover, they are further divided into seventy-nine municipalities and cities, which constitute the local self-government units. They hold both executive and legislative powers.\n\nBrcko District: It was previously considered a municipality divided into two parts, one in the Republika Srpska and the other in FBiH. The final award was brought by an international arbitration tribunal in 1999 and prescribed the establishment of Brcko as a District. It is since then a condominium jointly owned by the Entities[4] but not managed by either. State legislation directly applies to the District and its fields of competence are nearly the same as the ones of the Entities (including executive, legal and judiciary authorities).\n\nThe BiH Constitution sets out the division of competences between the State and the Entities. It enumerates a list of attributions that come under the State and the Entities, and provides that the Republika Srpska and the FBiH have competence in all the fields that are not expressly assigned to the central Government.\n\nRepublika Srpska: The Republika Srpska is vested with all state functions and powers which are not expressly granted to the central Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Parliament exercises the legislative power whereas the Government owns the executive power. Local self-government is one of the basic principles of the Republika Srpska’s Constitution (Art. 5). Municipalities have both exclusive and shared competences with the Republika Srpska.\n\nFBiH: The FBiH was created by the Washington Agreement signed on 18 March 1994. The Government of the FBiH owns the executive power and the Parliament is vested with legislative powers. According to the FBiH’s Constitution, the Cantons have competence in all the fields that are not expressly granted to the Federation. [5] It also lists a number of competences which are expressly attributed to the Cantons. The Constitution foresees the express allocation of competences to local self-government units and the possibility for the Cantons to delegate them some responsibilities. This delegation of competences is mandatory where the majority of population in a local self-government unit is different from that of the Canton as a whole.\n\nBesides the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the constitutions of both Entities describe the distribution of powers between the different levels of governance. Moreover, both Entities have adopted their own laws on local self-government.\n\nIn the FBiH, local units of self-government shall independently manage their funds in accordance with the law.[6]\n\nAs regards the Republika Srpska, local self-government units have right to efficient own financial resources that can freely be disposed by a local unit in accordance with its competences and in accordance with law. All resources from a local self-government unit’s own income belong to a local self-government budget.[7] In 2015, and 2016, a new law on local self-government of the Republika Srpska, is in the process of being developed. The draft being developed leads toward the higher responsibility of the assemblies’ members, both in the municipalities and cities.[8]\n\nCentral level\n\nThe central Government of BiH has competence
