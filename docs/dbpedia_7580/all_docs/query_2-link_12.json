        "text": "Administrative structure of Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina has a very complex administrative structure. In accordance with the Constitution of BiH, the country consists of two entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) and the Republic of Srpska (RS), as well as the Brčko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a separate local government unit outside of the two entities. The administration is based on a federal structure and is very decentralised. All governmental functions and authorities that are not expressly assigned to the institutions of BiH in the Constitution reside with the entities, cantons, and Brčko District. Local government units in the RS have somewhat greater powers than local government units in the FBiH, where a number of local powers have been transferred to the cantons. The institutions of BiH presently have powers in relation to foreign policy; national defence; intelligence and security; the value-added tax system; the judicial system (appointment process); foreign trade policy; customs policy; monetary policy; the finances of the institutions and for the international obligations of BiH; immigration, refugee and asylum policy and regulation; international and inter-Entity criminal law enforcement, including relations with Interpol; the establishment and operation of common and international communications facilities; and the regulation of inter-Entity transport and air traffic control.\n\nFederation of Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nThe Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina makes up 50.94% of the total surface area of BiH. This entity was created by the Washington Agreement signed on 18 March 1994. According to the Constitution, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina has exclusive responsibility for citizenship of the Federation; economic policy, including planning, reconstruction, and land use policy at the federal level; finance, financial institutions and the fiscal policy of the Federation; combating terrorism, inter-cantonal crimes, drug trafficking and organised crime; the allocation of electronic frequencies for radio, TV and other purposes according to the BiH Constitution; energy policy, including inter-cantonal distribution matters, and providing and maintaining the related infrastructure and financing activities of or under the aegis of the Federation Government by taxation, borrowing, or other means.\n\nRepublic of Srpska\n\nThe Republic of Srpska makes up 48.10% of the total surface area of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This entity is a unique and indivisible constitutional and legal entity. In accordance with its Constitution, the Republic of Srpska has responsibility for the integrity, constitutional order, and territorial unity of the Republic; security; measures falling under its jurisdiction in case of an imminent threat of war or state of emergency; constitutionality and legality; the implementation and protection of human rights and freedoms; property, property-related obligations and the protection of all forms of property; the legal status of enterprises and other organisations, and their associations and chambers; economic relations with foreign countries which have not been transferred to BiH institutions; markets and planning; the banking and tax systems; the main objectives and directions of economic, scientific, technological, demographic and social development; the development of agriculture and the village; the use of land, policies and measures for development and commodity reserves; the control of the legality of the disposal of the means of legal entities; the collection of statistical and other data of general interest; the organisation, competence and work of state bodies; public services; work relations, safety at work, employment; social insurance and other forms of social care; healthcare; soldiers and the protection of the disabled; child and youth care; education; culture and the protection of cultural resources; physical culture; environmental protection; the public information system; international cooperation, with the exception of those areas transferred to BiH institutions; and financing the exercise of the rights and duties of the Republic.\n\nCantons in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nThe Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is divided into 10 cantons (federal units): Una-Sana Canton, Posavina Canton, Tuzla Canton, Zenica-Doboj Canton, Bosnian-Podrinje Canton Goražde, Central Bosnia Canton, Herzegovina-Neretva Canton, West Herzegovina Canton, Sarajevo Canton, and Canton 10. Each canton has their own Constitution, parliament, and government. The Federation and the Cantons share responsibilities, which may be exercised either jointly or separately, in relation to guaranteeing and enforcing human rights; health; environmental policy; infrastructure for communications and transport in accordance with the BiH Constitution; social welfare policy; the implementation of laws and regulations concerning citizenship and passports of citizens of BiH from the Federation territory and on foreigners staying and their movements; tourism and the use of natural resources. Cantons have powers in all aspects that are not expressly granted to the Federation: the police (establishment and control of the forces); educational policy, including the regulation and provision of education; cultural policy; housing policy, including regulations on the construction of residential buildings; policy on public services; the regulation of local land use, including zoning; radio and television policy, including regulations on their provision; social welfare policy and services; cantonal tourism policy, the development of tourism resources; and the financing of activities of the cantonal government or its agencies through taxation, borrowing, or other means.\n\nThe Brčko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nAs a result of the arbitration on the issue of the inter-entity boundary line in the area around Brčko in March 1999, the Brčko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina was formed as a separate local government unit (comprising 0.96% of the total surface area of BiH). Since then the district has been a condominium jointly owned by the Entities but not managed by either. The legislation of BiH directly applies to the District and its powers are nearly the same as those of the Entities (including the executive, legislature, and judiciary authorities).\n\nLocal government in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nThe Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the cantons have adopted their own laws on local government. The local government unit has its own powers established by the constitution and law and has the power to deal with all issues of local importance that are not specifically excluded from its competence or assigned to another authority based on the constitution and law. There are 80 local government units in the FBiH (58 municipalities and 22 cities). The powers of cities and of municipalities do not differ in any significant way. The City of Sarajevo is the only local government unit in the FBiH that consists of multiple (four) municipalities.\n\nLocal government in the Republic of Srpska\n\nIn accordance with the Law on Local Government, the local government units in the RS have the powers to deal with all issues of local interest that are not specifically excluded from its jurisdiction or assigned to another level of government. There are 64 local government units in the RS (53 municipalities and 11 cities). As in the FBiH, there are no significant differences in the powers held by cities and municipalities. The City of Istočno Sarajevo is the only local government unit in the RS that consists of several (six) municipalities.\n\nSystem of governance of Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina is in Annex 4 of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Dayton Peace Accords); it confirmed the continued legal existence of BiH as a state, while its internal structure was changed. In the Preamble of the Constitution, the Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs are described as the ‘constituent peoples’. The institutions at the BiH level received limited powers in accordance with the Dayton Peace Accords of 1995, as all governmental functions and authorities that are not expressly assigned to BiH institutions in the Constitution are assigned to the entities, cantons, and Brčko District.\n\nLegislative power\n\nLegislative power at the state level is the responsibility of the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Parlamentarna skupština Bosne i Hercegovine in Bosnian, Serbian, and Croatian). It is a bicameral parliament, comprising a lower chamber, the House of Representatives (28 members from the FBiH and 14 members from the RS), and an upper chamber, the House of Peoples (consisting of five Bosniaks and the same number of Croats from the FBiH, and five Serbs from the RS). Its powers include amending the Constitution, and approving international treaties and the annual budget of BiH institutions. The approval of both chambers is needed for all legislation. Similar to the decisions of the presidency, an act can be annulled if a majority of the representatives of any constituent people in the House of Peoples declares it to be ‘destructive of a vital interest’ of the people. A joint commission, or under specific circumstances the constitutional court, has to resolve the dispute in this case. There is also an ‘entity veto’ in both chambers, whereby a majority (more than ⅔) of the members or representatives of the parliament of another entity can stop the adoption of an act. Most laws and other acts in BiH are adopted by the entity and cantonal parliaments, as well as the Assembly of the Brčko District.\n\nThe bicameral Parliament of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Parlament Federacije Bosne i Hercegovine in Bosnian, Serbian, and Croatian) is the main legislative body in the FBiH. It comprises a lower chamber, the House of Representatives (98 members), and an upper chamber, the House of Peoples (consisting of 23 Bosniaks, 23 Croats, and 23 Serbs, as well as 11 representatives of Others from ten cantons).\n\nLegislative power in the Republic of Srpska is the responsibility of the unicameral National Assembly of the Republic of Srpska (Narodna skupština Republike Srpske in Serbian, Bosnian, and Croatian). This legislative body consists of 83 members. In addition to this body, there is the Council of Peoples (consisting of eight Serbs, eight Bosniaks, and eight Croats, as well as four representatives of Others), which oversees decisions made by the National Assembly with a veto right in order to ensure the protection of the constitutional rights of the constituent peoples.\n\nThe main legislative body of the Brčko District is the Assembly of the Brčko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Skupština Brčko distrikta Bosne i Hercegovine in Serbian, Bosnian, and Croatian) which consists of 31 members.\n\nExecutive power\n\nThe main executive body at the state level is a collegial three-person Presidency (Predsjedništvo Bosne i Hercegovine in Bosnian, Serbian, and Croatian), consisting of one Bosniak, one Croat, and one Serb, each of them serving four years. The Bosniak and Croat members are directly elected from the Federation whilst the Serb member is elected from the Republic of Srpska. Members of the Presidency may be re-elected once and are then ineligible for four years. A chairperson, selected by the principle of rotation, heads the Presidency. However, decisions taken in the Presidency shall be by consensus, otherwise by a majority of the members. If a decision is seen to be ‘destructive of a vital interest’, the dissenting member may appeal it within three days. A two-thirds majority of the legislative body from the dissenting member’s respective territory is then allowed to nullify the decision. According to the BiH Constitution, the Presidency has the power to conduct foreign policy; appoint ambassadors; negotiate, refuse and ratify treaties; execute parliamentary decisions; and propose an annual budget. In addition, the members of the Presidency are given ‘civilian command authority over the armed forces’. However, no Entity is allowed to use force against another Entity without the consent of the government of the latter and of the Presidency.\n\nThe Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Vijeće ministara Bosne i Hercegovine in Bosnian and Croatian, Savjet ministara Bosne i Hercegovine in Serbian) is an executive body, which exercises its powers and carries out its duties as governmental functions, according to the BiH Constitution, laws, and other regulations. The chair of the Council of Ministers, nominated by the Presidency, selects the other members of the Council with the approval of the House of Representatives. Not more than two-thirds of the members shall be appointed from the territory of the Federation. The BiH Council of Ministers comprises the Chairperson and nine ministers (Foreign Affairs; Foreign Trade and Economic Relations; Finance and Treasury; Communications and Transport; Civil Affairs; Human Rights and Refugees; Justice; Security and Defence).\n\nThe President of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Predsjednik Federacije Bosne i Hercegovine in Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian) represents the Federation and is the head of the federal executive power. In electing the President and two Vice-Presidents of the Federation, at least one-third of the delegates of the respective Bosniak, Croat, or Serb caucuses in the House of Peoples may nominate the President and two Vice-Presidents of the Federation. After that, the House of Representatives needs to approve the President and Vice-Presidents, and then the House of Peoples decides whether to confirm the decision of the House of Representatives by a majority of the votes of all three caucuses.\n\nThe President of Republic of Srpska (Predsjednik Republike Srpske in Serbian, Bosnian, and Croatian) is the highest executive authority in the Republic of Srpska. This President is directly elected for a term of four years, along with two Vice-Presidents from the different constituent peoples. As the Republic of Srpska functions as a parliamentary system, the President has limited powers.\n\nEntity governments are the main executive authorities at the Entity level. They comprise the Prime Minister and 16 ministers. Each canton has its own government as the main executive authority. The cantonal government comprises the Prime Minister and 8-12 ministers.\n\nThe main executive authority of the Brčko District is the Government of the Brčko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Vlada Brčko distrikta Bosne i Hercegovine in Bosnian, Serbian, and Croatian). The Mayor of the Brčko District is the head of the government which comprises 15 members (the Mayor, Deputy Mayor, Chief Government Coordinator, and 12 Department Chiefs).\n\nJudicial power\n\nThe judiciary is a shared power between the state, the Entities, and the Brčko District. Hence, BiH has four court systems – one each for BiH, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Srpska, and the Brčko District.\n\nAt the state level, there are two courts: the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Ustavni sud Bosne i Hercegovine in Bosnian, Serbian, and Croatian) and the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Sud Bosne i Hercegovine in Bosnian, Serbian, and Croatian).\n\nThe Constitutional Court of BiH consists of nine judges. Four are selected by the Parliament of the FBiH (House of Representatives), two are selected by the National Assembly of RS, and the other three members are selected by the President of the European Court of Human Rights after consultation with the Presidency of BiH. The powers and competences of the Constitutional Court are set out in Article VI of the Constitution of BiH. These powers include resolving disputes between organs in BiH (between the Entities or between BiH and an Entity or Entities, or between BiH institutions), serving as an appeal organ on constitutional issues and ensuring that laws accord with the Constitution. Regarding appellate jurisdiction, this court must decide on issues under the Constitution arising from a judgment of any other court in BiH (the last instance of the subsidiary protection of rights and freedoms enshrined in the Constitution).\n\nThe Court of BiH was established with the principal aim of ensuring the effective exercise of the powers of the state, the respect for human rights and the rule of law in BiH. It has no explicit constitutional basis, but there is an opinion of the Venice Commission pointing to the need for such a court. This court has jurisdiction over the entire area of BiH and has three divisions that exercise the court’s jurisdiction: the Criminal Division, the Administrative Division, and the Appellate Division.\n\nThe courts in the FBiH exclusively apply the laws of the FBiH and cantonal laws (special entity procedural and substantive laws). However, certain types of conflicts of laws in the criminal law area and conflicts of jurisdiction fall within the competence of the Court of BiH. The judicial functions in this Entity are carried out by the Constitutional Court of the FBiH (Ustavni sud FBiH in Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian), the Supreme Court of the FBIH (Vrhovni sud FBiH in Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian), cantonal courts (10), and municipal courts (33).\n\nThe courts in the RS exclusively apply RS laws (special entity procedural and substantive laws). As in the FBiH, certain types of conflicts of laws in the criminal law area and conflicts of jurisdiction fall within the competence of the Court of BiH. The judicial functions in this Entity are carried out by the Constitutional Court of the RS (Ustavni sud RS in Serbian, Bosnian and Croatian), the Supreme Court of the RS (Vrhovni sud RS in Serbian, Bosnian, and Croatian), district courts (6), and basic courts (19), as well as courts of special jurisdiction – the Higher Commercial Court (Viši privredni sud in Serbian, Bosnian, and Croatian) and district commercial courts (6).\n\nThe Brčko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina has its own judicial system. The judicial functions are carried out by the Basic Court of the Brčko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Osnovni sud Brčko distrikta Bosne i Hercegovine in Bosnian, Serbian, and Croatian) and the Appellate Court of the Brčko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Apelacioni sud Brčko distrikta Bosne i Hercegovine in Bosnian, Serbian, and Croatian). The Basic Court of the Brčko District is the first instance court. There is one court of appeal, which has jurisdiction over the Brčko District. There are no further appeals except for those that relate to constitutional issues that may be brought before the Constitutional Court of BiH.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAccording to the Newman and Thornley classification of spatial planning systems based on legal families in Europe from 1996, the planning systems of former Yugoslavia belong to an Eastern European family.\n\nHistorical development of the planning system\n\nThe Building Act of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia from 1931 is considered the foundation of urban planning legislation in the South Slavic countries, the enactment of which would begin to establish the unique planning system of Yugoslavia. The Act included the legal matter of construction and the rudiments of the legal matter of urbanism. By this Act, the main spatial (urban) planning document was the regulatory plan to be drafted cities, towns, industrial and mining settlements, spas and health resorts, and climatic and tourist places, as well as larger villages. The Building Act was used until the adoption of the first Yugoslav federal urban legislation and, according to professionals in the field, well after. The period from 1931 until World War II represents the first stage of development of the spatial planning system in BiH.\n\nThe period from the end of World War II until 1951 can be considered the second stage, comprising Communist Renewal and Centralisation. During this period, the need for stable and robust legislation was unquestionable, which arose as a reaction to the processes, intensive reconstruction, and substantial construction endeavours in the war-torn country. The main institution in this period was the Ministry of Construction at federal level. In 1948, the ministry proposed and the federal government adopted the Basic Decree on Construction, the Decree on Construction Inspection, and the Basic Decree on Design. The Basic Decree on the General Urban Plan (GUP) from 1949, together with the decrees from 1948, formed the legal skeleton of the regulation and planning of land use and settlements. The GUP was a comprehensive strategic document that laid out the main development directions for urban settlements. The principal aim of urban master planning was to support socioeconomic development plans while complying with the socialist institutional framework.\n\nDecentralisation and the First Law on Urban Planning of Bosnia and Herzegovina represents the third stage of the development of the spatial planning system. This stage lasted from 1951 to 1973. It was marked by strong republic (federal unit) level legislation, while the federal level was only responsible for general policy harmonisation. Decentralisation was further strengthened by the introduction of the communal system (sub-regional communities with self-governing powers and their own jurisdiction) in 1955. BiH as a federal unit (republic) adopted the Law on Urban Planning in 1959. Other significant laws from the third stage were the Law on the Designation of Building Areas (1961), the Law on the Construction of Residential and Commercial Buildings in Rural Areas (1962), the Law on the Arrangement and Provision of Land for Building (1968), and the Law on the Construction of Investment Facilities (1968). The main institution in this period was the Ministry of Construction within the Government of the People’s Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina until 1953 and the Republic Secretary of Construction within the Executive Council of the Assembly of the People’s (Socialist) Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the later period. The Urban Institute of Bosnia and Herzegovina (established in 1947) continued to function and gained stronger political and institutional powers in spatial planning. During the 1950s and 1960s, urban institutes were established in Sarajevo and Banja Luka.\n\nThe fourth stage of development of the spatial planning system in BiH – Planning Optimism – lasted from 1974 to 1991. In 1974, the crucial Law on the Physical Planning of Bosnia & Herzegovina was adopted. It was a systemic law which not only covered spatial planning and construction, but also environmental protection in the broadest sense. The Law on Physical Planning introduced a new category of (strategic) development planning document – the spatial plan at the levels of the republic, region, group of municipalities, and municipality, as well as special areas (tourist areas, recreational areas, military areas, protected areas, or other specific areas). Spatial and urban development plans were frequently produced following the adoption of this law. The most important spatial plan at the highest level from this period was the Spatial Plan of Bosnia and Herzegovina 1981-2000, which was adopted by the Assembly of the Socialist Republic of BiH in 1982 (and the consolidated text in 1989). The plan was developed for the period from 1981 to 2000 and proposed various planning measures to achieve territorial cohesion and balanced development. Interestingly, this plan is still in use in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Only adopted regional spatial plan in this stage was the Spatial Plan for the City of Sarajevo (1986), which covered the urban region of Sarajevo. Unfortunately, the Spatial Plan for the Special Area of the Sutjeska National Park was the only adopted spatial plan for special areas. Spatial plans for municipalities and urban development plans for urban areas of municipal seats were the most frequently produced of all the strategic spatial planning documents. According to estimates, around 70% of municipalities adopted spatial plans and around 80% of urban areas of municipal and city seats were covered by adopted urban development plans in that time period. For this reason, the fourth stage is often referred to as the golden age of spatial planning in BiH.\n\nIn general, spatial planning in the period from 1945 to 1991 was therefore subordinated to social planning, whose role was to direct urbanisation processes, plan infrastructure, and optimally distribute essential economic capacities and social service facilities across the network of settlements.\n\nThe time period after 1991 is the fifth stage of the development of the spatial planning system in BiH, characterised by post-socialist planning. This stage is still ongoing. The spatial planning system has been affected by tectonic socio-economic changes: the break-up of Yugoslavia and the war in BiH, the Dayton Peace Accords and the new Constitution of BiH, the transition from socialism (system of workers’ self-management) to free market capitalism and the denationalisation of urban building land. Regarding valid strategic spatial plans in 2023, there is one Entity spatial plan (1/2), nine cantonal spatial plans (9/10), and 86 spatial plans of local government units (86/135). The worst situation concerns urban development plans. Only nine of the 25 major urban areas have a valid urban development plan. The dominant category of spatial planning documents is the regulatory plan.\n\nLegal basis/constitutional framework of spatial planning\n\nIn BiH, spatial planning powers lie with the two state entities, ten cantons, and the Brčko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Consequently, there is no institution in charge of spatial planning at the state level. It can be considered that three planning systems (co)exist in BiH – those of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Srpska, and the Brčko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nThe current spatial planning system of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is regulated by the Law on Spatial Planning and Land Use at the Level of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which entered into force in 2006 (Official Gazette of the FBiH No. 2/06, 72/07, 32/08, 4/10, 13/10, 45/10, 85/21, and 92/21), as well as by ten cantonal laws on spatial planning or spatial planning and construction.\n\nThe Law on Spatial Planning and Construction (Official Gazette of the RS No. 40/2013, 106/15, 03/16, and 84/19) regulates the spatial planning system of the Republic of Srpska.\n\nThe spatial planning system of the Brčko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina is regulated by the Law on Spatial Planning and Construction, which entered into force in 2008 (Official Gazette of the BD BiH No. 29/08, 18/17, 48/18, 54/18, 10/20, 29/20, and 40/20).\n\nEntities, cantons, the Brčko District, and other local government units have extensive planning rights (planning monopoly), which covers both the elaboration (preparation and/or drafting) and adoption of spatial planning documents depending on the level.\n\nSpatial planning authorities\n\nThe spatial planning system is based on the principle of the separation of the administrative authorities responsible for preparation of spatial planning documents, the authorities responsible for drafting the spatial planning document proposals, and the authorities responsible for adopting the spatial planning documents.\n\nThe authorities responsible for preparation of spatial planning documents at the Entity level are the Ministry of Spatial Planning of the FBiH and the Ministry of Spatial Planning, Construction and Ecology of the RS. At the cantonal level, the responsible authorities are the ten cantonal ministries of spatial planning and related portfolios (mainly construction and ecology). The Department for Spatial Planning and Property Legal Affairs of the Government of the Brčko District of BiH, the offices for urban planning in the municipal/city administrations of the FBiH, and the departments for spatial planning in the municipal/city administrations of the RS are the authorities responsible for undertaking the preparatory work for spatial planning documents at the local level.\n\nThe authorities responsible for drafting the spatial planning document proposal are ten public institutes (four cantonal institutes, five city institutes/companies and the Institute for Planning, Design and Development of the BD BiH) and authorised legal entities (mostly private). Members of the planning teams must be employees of the institute or of a legal entity and must be qualified licensed planners (in the Republic of Srpska and the Brčko District) or must have passed the professional exam (in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina). Authorisations are issued by the Ministry of Spatial Planning of the FBiH, the Ministry of Spatial Planning, Construction and Ecology of the RS, and the Department for Spatial Planning and Property Legal Affairs of the Government of the BD BiH in accordance with special regulations.\n\nThe legislative bodies at entity, cantonal and local level are the authorities responsible for adopting the spatial planning documents, depending on the type. These are the Parliament of the FBiH and the National Assembly of the RS. At the cantonal level, the responsible authorities are the ten cantonal assemblies. The Assembly of the BD BiH is responsible for adopting spatial planning documents in the Brčko District of BiH. At the local level in the FBiH, the responsible authorities are the 80 municipal/city councils, while at the local level in the RS, the responsible authorities are the 64 municipal/city assemblies.\n\nSpatial planning instruments\n\nEntity spatial plans are the highest strategic spatial planning documents in Bosnia and Herzegovina. According to the law, the Spatial Plan of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina determines the long-term goals and measures of spatial development in accordance with the overall economic, social, and historical development of the Federation. Unfortunately, the Spatial Plan of the FBiH 2008-2028 has not been adopted by the House of Peoples of the Parliament of the FBiH. On the other hand, in 2015 the National Assembly of the Republic of Srpska adopted the Amendments to the Spatial Plan of the Republic of Srpska until 2025 as the third Entity plan since 1996. According to the law, the Spatial Plan of the RS determines the long-term goals and measures of the spatial development of the Republic in accordance with its economic, social, and cultural-historical development, sectoral strategies, and other development documents, and based on the development priorities determined in the process of harmonising goals and relativising conflicts of interest in spatial development. Entity spatial plans contain land-use policies and guidelines for the development of various functions and activities (the prescribed scale is 1:200,000).\n\nSpatial plans of areas with special features of the Federation of BiH are adopted for areas of importance for the Federation as determined by the Spatial Plan of the Federation. Such special areas in the FBiH include areas for the construction of large hydropower buildings, catchment areas for hydroaccumulation for the needs of the regional water supply, corridors and buildings for international transport, hydromelioration and agricultural systems, endangered areas, areas for the purposes of holding international sport events, and areas of architectural or natural heritage. Spatial plans for special purpose areas of the Republic of Srpska are adopted for national parks and other areas as determined by a higher-level plan or a plan for a wider area (Spatial Plan of the RS). This category of spatial planning document determines the basic spatial organisation of the area with special features or special purpose area, including the basic land use and special zoning (protection regimes, buffer zones, etc.). The prescribed scale in the FBiH is 1:10,000 to 1:25,000, while this scale in the RS is 1:1,000 to 1:50,000 (some areas can be treated in a more detailed manner). Entity parliaments are responsible for adopting these strategic spatial planning documents.\n\nZoning plans for special purpose areas of the RS are adopted for areas of particular importance for the Republic of Srpska, according to special decisions of the Government of the RS. Such plans are detailed land-use plans with zoning regulations. The prescribed scale of 1:500 to 1:2,500 indicates an implementation spatial planning document that enable the issuance of site permits based on the plan itself.\n\nAllotment plan for linear public infrastructure also exists only in the Republic of Srpska, and is used to guide implementation. Like the zoning plan for special purpose area of the RS, the National Assembly of the RS is responsible for adopting this plan. This allotment plan is a detailed land-use plan with parcellation. The prescribed scale is the same as in the zoning plan.\n\nSpatial plan of the canton is based on the Spatial Plan of the Federation and the Programme of Measures referring to the respective area. This type of plan determines the basic land use, system of settlements and urban areas, buildings and corridors of state and other infrastructure of importance for the Federation and the canton with buffer zones, other (social) infrastructure of importance for the Federation and the canton, environmental protection measures, the protection of architectural and natural heritage, measures to protect against disasters and war operations, the exploitation of mineral resources, as well as obligations regarding the detailed planning of smaller spatial units within the canton. The prescribed scale is 1:25,000 to 1:50,000. At the end of 2023, only Posavina canton has not adopted spatial plan. Cantonal assemblies adopt these strategic spatial planning documents, as well as the spatial plans of areas with special features of the canton, which have a similar structure and content to federal spatial plans of areas with special features but are more detailed (the prescribed scale is 1:5,000 to 1:25,000).\n\nThe Spatial Development Strategy for the District and the Spatial Plan for the District are the highest strategic spatial planning documents in the Brčko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Both spatial planning documents are adopted by the Assembly of the Brčko District of BiH. Interestingly, there are no prescribed scales for these spatial plans (in practice 1:35,000 for the spatial development strategy and 1:5,000 to 1:35,000 for the spatial plan). The spatial development strategy determines the principles and goals of spatial development; the basis for harmonising and guiding development; the spatial organisation; the development priorities and the basis for the organisation, protection and use of space; the basis for environmental protection; the system of development infrastructure; as well as the planning units for which a strategy or special purpose area plan are adopted. The spatial plan addresses and specifies in more detail the planning propositions derived from the strategy while respecting the natural and cultural-historical values of the district. It determines the basic land use for BD BiH.\n\nMunicipal spatial plans in the FBiH and spatial plans of the local government units in the RS are the most common strategic spatial planning documents in BiH. These plans have a similar structure and content to cantonal spatial plans, but with more emphasis on the local level. They determine the basic land use for local government units (municipalities/cities). The municipal/city councils in the FBiH and municipal/city assemblies in the RS are responsible for adopting these strategic spatial planning documents. The prescribed scale in the FBiH is 1:10,000 to 1:25,000, while this scale in the RS is 1:25,000 to 1:50,000. At present, no joint spatial plan has been adopted for territories of two or more local government units in the RS and the Central Bosnia Canton. Legislation in the Zenica-Doboj Canton and Herzegovina-Neretva Canton provides for a spatial plan of the area with special features of the local government unit.\n\nUrban development plans are strategic spatial planning documents which are adopted for the urban area(s) within local government units, primarily the urban areas of the municipal/city seats and the town of Brčko. They are typical land use plans (the prescribed scale is 1:2,500 to 1:5,000). The municipal/city councils in the FBiH, the municipal/city assemblies in the RS, as well as the Assembly of the Brčko District of BiH are responsible for adopting urban development plans.\n\nThe zoning plan is the youngest detailed spatial planning document in BiH and is adopted for parts of urban areas of the municipal/city seats and/or other urban areas. In the Brčko District of BiH it is adopted for the entire urban area of the town of Brčko. The zoning plan determines land use in detail with zoning regulations (urban planning indicators). This plan also serves as an implementation document (legal basis for issuing site permits). The prescribed scale is 1:500 to 1:2,500. The legislative bodies of the local government units are responsible for adopting zoning plans. There is a zoning plan for the special purpose area of the local government unit in the RS. Interestingly, in the West Herzegovina Canton, zoning plans do not even exist as a category of spatial planning document.\n\nThe most frequent detailed (implementation) spatial planning documents in BiH are regulatory plans, which are adopted for parts of urban areas and other building areas. They determine the detailed land use with horizontal and vertical regulations (the prescribed scale is 1:500 to 1:2,500). The equivalent plan in the West Herzegovina Canton is the detailed development plan. The authorities responsible for adopting regulatory plans are the legislative bodies of the local government units.\n\nAllotment plans are detailed spatial planning documents in the RS and BD BiH, while in the cantons of FBiH they have the status of ‘other spatial planning documents’ or ‘auxiliary spatial planning documents’. These implementation documents are adopted for parts of urban areas and other building areas. They determine the land use in detail with parcellation. The prescribed scale is 1:500 to 1:2,500. The legislative bodies of the local government units are responsible for adopting allotment plans, except in the Herzegovina-Neretva Canton and in Canton 10 (where it is the local executive body). Allotment plan does not exist as a plan type in the West Herzegovina Canton.\n\nUrban development projects are the most detailed (implementation) spatial planning documents in BiH; they are adopted for parts of urban areas (mainly narrow urban areas of the municipal/city seats). They determine land use in detail together with urban/architectural design specifications. The prescribed scale is 1:200 to 1:500. The authorities responsible for adopting urban development projects are the legislative bodies of the local government units. As an exception, West Herzegovina Canton does not have the urban development project as a category of spatial planning document.\n\nThe content and method for developing spatial planning documents in the FBiH is regulated by the Regulation on the Unique Methodology for Developing Planning Documents (Official Gazette of the FBiH, No. 63/2004, 50/2007, and 84/2010), in the RS by the Rulebook on the Method for Developing Spatial Planning Documents and their Content (Official Gazette of the RS No. 69/2013) and in the BD BiH by the Rulebook on the Method of Developing and Adopting Spatial Planning Documents and their Content from 2009.\n\nThe decision to develop a spatial planning document is made by the legislative bodies at the Entity, cantonal, or local level, depending on the category of spatial planning document. Anyone may initiate the development of a spatial planning document or amendments to it, especially at the local level, but the executive body is the formal initiator. A public debate is obligatory for all draft spatial planning documents and is open to all to submit opinions, suggestions, and comments. Before the public debate on the preliminary draft or draft, in most cantons there is an obligation to consult the authority responsible for preparing the spatial planning document, the planning council (if composed of experts), and the authority responsible for drafting the proposal for the spatial planning document. The formation of a planning council is obligatory only in the RS, where the preliminary draft is the subject of expert discussion, together with utility companies, Entity, and state institutions. Interestingly, the legislative bodies of all the cantons in FBiH adopt/accept the draft spatial planning document, except in the Bosnian-Podrinje Canton. In contrast, the authority responsible for accepting the draft also has overall responsibility for preparing the spatial planning document in the RS and BD BiH. The public consultation on the draft document in the FBiH runs for 30-90 days, while in the RS this period is a minimum of 30 days (depending on the type of spatial planning document), and in the BD BiH it is 30 days. During the public consultation, one or more public presentations and discussions are organised. In the RS and in the Posavina Canton and Bosnian-Podrinje Canton, once the formal public consultation ends, a public discussion of the comments received during the consultation must be held within a period of 30 or 45 days. This type of discussion is not obligatory in the BD BiH. If the draft plan is significantly altered after that first public debate, a further public debate may be held in the RS, the BD BiH, and in the Posavina Canton and the Bosnian-Podrinje Canton. Also, in the RS and the BD BiH, as well as in four cantons, a summary procedure may be invoked for detailed spatial planning documents in emergency situations. The summary procedure in six other cantons relates to the amendments to spatial planning documents.\n\nPrior to adopting the strategic spatial planning document proposal at the local level in the FBiH, it is necessary to obtain the approval/opinion of the cantonal ministry of spatial planning, primarily in regard to the alignment of this spatial planning document with the cantonal spatial plan. The Ministry of Spatial Planning of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina issues the opinion primarily in regard to the alignment of the cantonal spatial plan with the Spatial Plan of the FBiH. The approval of the Minister of Spatial Planning, Construction and Ecology in the RS is necessary for all spatial plans, urban development plans, and zoning plans for special purpose areas, primarily in regard to the alignment of these plans with the spatial plan of the wider area (mostly with the Spatial Plan of the Republic of Srpska). The Government of the Brčko District of BiH approves spatial planning document proposal, except for the allotment plan. Interestingly, the opinions of utility companies and sectoral institutions on the draft or proposed spatial planning document must be obtained in the RS and BD BiH.\n\nIn general, the time frame for strategic spatial planning documents is 10-20 years, and 5-10 years for implementation documents. Unfortunately, the issue of the validity of spatial planning documents is not clearly regulated in most spatial planning laws. In the RS, the time frame of validity of strategic spatial planning documents can be extended for a maximum of ten years, while implementation documents remain valid until a new document is adopted or the existing document amended, provided the implementation document does not contradict a higher level spatial planning document.\n\nRegarding the legal impact, all planning instruments are legally binding for all planning authorities. Planning solutions are indicative in spatial plans at all levels of administration; lower-level spatial planning documents may deviate from these slightly, primarily in the graphical parts. On the other hand, planning solutions are directive in detailed spatial planning documents. These documents are the legal basis for issuing site permits.\n\nAt first glance, the planning system in BiH is very complex, primarily due to its fragmentation into three planning systems (FBiH, RS, and BD BiH). However, most of the spatial planning instruments are almost identical and originate in the legislative heritage of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (the fourth phase of development of the spatial planning system in BiH). The only exception is the highest spatial planning document in the Brčko District of BiH – the Spatial Development Strategy of the District –, but this strategic spatial planning document is very similar in content and scale to a typical spatial plan of the local government unit in all three planning systems.\n\nInterdependencies and mutual influences between planning levels\n\nIn the FBiH, spatial planning at the local level is subordinate to that at the cantonal level, while federal spatial plans rank higher than cantonal spatial plans. Local spatial planning documents in the RS are directly subordinate to the Entity spatial planning documents. All spatial planning documents in the BD BiH must be aligned with the Spatial Development Strategy of the District and the Spatial Plan of the District. Unfortunately, there is only a low level of harmonisation among the spatial planning documents of the Entities and those of the BD BiH, especially in relation to the highest-level spatial plans.\n\nIn the early 1990s, social planning as a dominant type of planning ceased to exist in BiH, because of the collapse of the system of workers’ self-management and the war in the period 1992-1995. After that, spatial planning remained the only type of planning for 10-15 years. Development planning, which to a certain degree replaced social planning at a mostly local level, began to develop in the mid-2000s. The legislation on development planning in the FBiH was adopted in 2017, in the BD BiH in 2020, and in the RS in 2021, but without a clearly defined relationship with spatial planning. It seems that development planning has recently started to predominate over spatial planning, especially in terms of the spatial development of local economies and infrastructure.\n\nInformal planning\n\nAfter the adoption of legislation on development planning in the FBiH (2017), BD BiH (2020), and RS (2021), informal planning in Bosnia and Herzegovina has been reduced to specific sectoral strategies/plans such as sustainable urban mobility plans (SUMPs) and green city action plans (GCAPs), often financed by international organisations. Only Sarajevo Canton and a few cities in both Entities have adopted these plans. Unfortunately, other instruments of informal planning (the information framework, guiding principles, approaches based on communication and cooperation, other formats) do not exist in the country’s planning practice.\n\nInfluence of EU legislation and policies\n\nSince Bosnia and Herzegovina is an EU candidate country, the influence of EU legislation is very pronounced. Elements of the Energy Efficiency Directive and the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive are directly included in the spatial planning laws. Both Entity spatial planning laws and the Law on Spatial Planning of Sarajevo Canton contain elements of the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive. It is interesting that the country does not have an officially adopted NUTS (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) classification and list of Natura 2000 sites designated under the EU Habitats and Birds Directives.\n\nThe influence of EU spatial planning and urban policies (the Territorial Agenda of the EU 2030, the European Spatial Development Perspective, the Urban Agenda for the EU) is weaker than that of EU legislation. The guiding principles of these documents are present in strategic spatial planning documents (especially at local level), but with weak connections with their planning propositions.\n\nThe main spatial planning challenges and debates\n\nThe main challenges of spatial planning in Bosnia and Herzegovina can be divided into two categories – substantive and procedural challenges. Depopulation outside larger urban areas (negative natural increase and net migration); an uneven spatial distribution of the population and economy; a high proportion of brownfields in built-up areas; excessive construction in larger urban areas and resorts; illegal construction; insufficiently developed infrastructure (especially waste water and district heating systems); abandonment of agricultural land; and air pollution and a low level of waste management in urban settlements during the heating season are the main substantive spatial planning challenges.\n\nOn the other hand, the main procedural spatial planning challenges are a very low level of horizontal coordination between the spatial planning systems of the FBiH, the RS and the BD BiH; a lack of strategic spatial planning documents (primarily urban development plans and spatial plans for special purpose areas); an excessive number of amendments to regulatory plans; a weak link between spatial planning and development planning; the declarative role of the SEA and EIA; obsolete methodology for developing spatial planning documents; a low level of implementation of strategic spatial planning documents; insufficient public participation in the planning process; the long duration of the process for obtaining approvals/opinions on spatial planning documents and small budget allocations for developing spatial planning documents at all levels of administration. In general, the most significant spatial planning issue is decision makers neglecting the importance of spatial planning instruments which results in low control over spatial development, as well as lagging behind in socio-economic development compared to neighbouring countries and the EU.\n\nThere are no significant spatial planning policy debates in BiH. The main reasons for this lack of debate are the underdevelopment of the professional community and the dominance of big political topics (centralisation vs separatism, citizenship vs ethnic identity, NATO membership vs military neutrality, state vs Enitity as a public property holder) in public discourse.\n\nFurther literature concerning the planning system in Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nBublin, M.
