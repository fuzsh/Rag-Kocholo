HDZ said reforms failed to resolve Croat representation, while SNSD insisted on replacing Central Election Commission members before the amendment. The amendments include the digitalisation of the electoral process, barring convicted war criminals from running for office, and enhancing campaign finance transparency to prevent voter manipulation. The OHR provided for a brief grace period for BiH parliamentarians to find a common solution before the legislation enters into force. The changes are planned to be rolled out in general elections scheduled for 2026, and as a pilot, subject to technological capacity, in local elections in October 2024.\n\nSources: Balkan Insight (1), Balkan Insight (2), Reuters, Office of the High Representative (1), Office of the High Representative (2), International IDEA (1), International IDEA (2), European External Action Service, N1\n\nThe European Commission recommended that the European Union open accession negotiations with Bosnia and Herzegovina on 12 March, and the members of the European Council agreed on 22 March. As a condition for future membership, the EU says Bosnia and Herzegovina must commit to a wide range of reforms, including to improve the functioning of the judiciary, counteract corruption and organized crime, strengthen border and migration management, and to promote reconciliation in light of the legacies of the war. In its decision, the European Commission pointed to recent progress, including legislation on the prevention of conflicts of interest passed by Parliament on 8 March, improving transparency on the assets and activities of public officials.\n\nSources: European Commission (1), European Commission (2), International IDEA, N1, European Western Balkans (1), European Western Balkans (2)"
