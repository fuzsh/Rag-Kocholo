        "text": "Since youth policy falls under the responsibility of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH), the Republika Srpska (RS), and the District of Brčko (BD) separately, each entity has its own youth law: the FBiH Law About the Youth of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (2010), the RS Law on Youth Organisation (2004), and the BD Law About the Young People of the Brčko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina (2017).\n\nAccording to the EU Youth Wiki, \"National youth policy does not exist in Bosnia and Herzegovina, due to its constitutional structure and because certain jurisdictions (like youth) are tied by the constitution to a certain level of government.\" Thus, there is no overarching national youth policy or strategy.\n\nIn FBiH, according to the Three-Year Working Plan of the Federal Ministry of Culture and Sports for the Period 2022-2024, one goal is to develop a strategy and action plan for youth. In RS, according to a press release, the Ministry of Family, Youth and Sports has begun developing a new Youth Policy for the years 2022-2026, following the end of term of the Youth Policy of the Republika Srpska 2016-2020. In BD, according to an article by Radio Brčko, the first youth strategy is also currently being developed.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) is made up of two political entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) and the Republika Srpska (RS), as well as the self-governing District of Brčko (BD). In FBiH, the Youth Sector within the Federal Ministry of Culture and Sports is primarily responsible for youth. In RS, on the other hand, the Department of Youth within the Ministry of Family, Youth and Sports is responsible for youth. Finally, in BD, the Youth Commission within the Assembly of the Brčko District takes on the responsibility for youth issues. Nationwide, the Ministry of Civil Affairs of BiH established the Commission for Coordination of Youth Issues to coordinate between these various institutions.\n\nThe Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina Youth Law (2010), the Republika Srpska Youth Law (2004), and the BD District of Brčko Youth Law (2017) all provide a definition for youth work.\n\nOn a national level, the Institute for Youth Development KULT aims to build and strengthen the capacities of associations and authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) as a whole to achieve a successful and sustainable policy for youth. One focus of the Institute is the recognition, professionalisation, and standardisation of youth work. According to the Institute for Youth Development KULT,\n\n\"Pursuant to a decision of the Agency for Statistics of BiH, associate expert on youth work was entered into the work position classification under the code 3412. This is an important step towards standardising youth work and represents the social acknowledgment of not only the occupation, but of non-formal education as a form of professional training.\"\n\nFurthermore, the Institute provides training courses and certifications for Youth Officers engaged in youth work in city, municipal, and cantonal authorities. Any officer who does not have a certificate, but is employed in youth work, must pass the Youth Officer training course and obtain a certificate within two years of employment. This training course will ultimately qualify the Youth Officer for expert work at the national level in youth work.\n\nIn the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH), according to the Three-Year Working Plan of the Federal Ministry of Culture and Sports for the Period 2022-2024, the Federal Ministry of Culture and Sports has a budget of BAM 16.6 million (USD 8.9 million) for the year 2022. Of that, one main activity of the ministry is to support policies and projects aimed at young people in FBiH. This includes the development of a youth strategy and action plan for youth, which is allocated BAM 40,000 (USD 21,416) each year for three years (2022-2024).\n\nIn the Republika Srpska (RS), according to the Budget of the Republika Srpska for 2022, the Ministry of Family, Youth and Sports is allocated BAM 8.2 million (USD 4.4 million). This budget accounts for multiple youth items, including BAM 200,000 (USD 107,536) for the implementation of programmes defined by the Youth Policy.\n\nIn the District of Brčko (BD), the Budget of the Brčko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina for 2022 allocates 5.0 million to the Assembly of the Brčko District. However, it is unclear how much of this goes towards the Youth Commission."
