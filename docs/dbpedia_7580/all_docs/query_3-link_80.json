        "text": "A dozen parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina’s Bosniak-Croat Federation have signed a coalition agreement following a general election in October, paving the way for the government to start work and meeting one of the conditions for bringing the country closer to getting EU candidate status in December.\n\nA Croat bloc led by the biggest Croat party, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ BiH), and a coalition of eight other political parties signed the coalition agreement on Tuesday (29 November).\n\nThe 1995 Dayton Accords that ended Bosnia’s 1992-95 war split the country in two highly autonomous regions – the Serb Republic and the Bosniak-Croat federation – linked by a weak multi-ethnic central government.\n\nIt is overseen by an international peace envoy, former German politician Christian Schmidt, who in October imposed what he said were measures to improve the functionality of the Federation.\n\nThe changes scrap blocking mechanisms and introduce deadlines for the appointment of deputies.\n\nThe document titled “Guidelines, principles and goals in the executive and legislative authorities for the period 2022–2026″ sets out the work program for the upcoming four-year term.\n\nIt consists of three parts, focusing on Euro-Atlantic integration, political stability and the rule of law, as well as social justice and the economy.\n\nThe document was signed by the HDZ president Dragan Čović and, on behalf of the coalition of the eight, by the leader of the Social Democratic Party of BiH, Nermin Nikšić.\n\nThe coalition of eight comprises the Social Democratic Party of BiH, Our Party, People and Justice Party, Bosnia and Herzegovina Initiative – Fuad Kasumović, For the New Generations, Democratic Action Movement, Party for BiH, and People’s European Alliance.\n\nČović said that the goal is to have both executive and legislative power at the level of the Federation of BiH and the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the end of the year.\n\n“We signed an agreement at all levels of government for the next four years – an agreement that opens a new dimension of behaviour in politics and political culture in order to open the European perspective of Bosnia and Herzegovina,” Čović said.\n\n“And then we can also expect BiH’s candidacy status for EU membership,” Čović said, voicing the hope that as early as December, the country could receive a positive signal for acquiring EU candidate status.\n\nThe EU’s executive had advised EU member states in October to grant Bosnia candidate status, pending a slew of commitments to fundamental reform in the form of eight reform priorities that it said would help bolster democracy in the country.\n\nA decision is expected to be made when EU leaders meet for their regular EU summit in mid-December, just after a crucial EU-Western Balkans summit in Tirana on 6 December.\n\nThe reform priorities are mainly related to 14 priorities that the European Commission presented in 2019, in its opinion on BiH’s readiness to become a candidate country.\n\nThe new agreement was handed over by the EU Enlargement Commissioner Oliver Varhelyi during a visit to Sarajevo.\n\nMeanwhile, the government of Bosnia’s Republika Srpska (RS), BiH’s other entity, is expected to have its constitutive session within the next 10 days, after RS’s separatist President Milorad Dodik gave the mandate to the new-old Prime Minister Radovan Višković, who hails from the same party as Dodik.\n\nDodik, who has been under US sanctions for undermining peace and democracy in BiH, has repeatedly called for “a peaceful dissolution” of the country and threatened to organise RS’ secession.\n\n[Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic]\n\nRead more with Euractiv"
