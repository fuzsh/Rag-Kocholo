        "text": "The Labour Party has won an overwhelming victory in the election — but now comes the hard part.\n\nThe party faces the mammoth task of restoring chronically underfunded public services in a time of economic hardship.\n\nPolitical analyst Tim Bale of Queen Mary University of London said it was going to take huge funding to improve the state-funded National Health Service, a key issue for a majority of voters. But other big ticket infrastructure items also need attention.\n\n“The question is where Labour is going to get that money from and how quickly it can manage to do it,’’ Bale told The Associated Press. “It’s got a big, growth plan that intends to liberalize planning in this country to make it easier to build houses, factories, infrastructure that will hopefully raise the tax revenue that the government can actually put into public services.”\n\n“Whether they can do that in time to satisfy public expectations, I think is the big question,” he said.\n\nRachel Reeves has been appointed Treasury chief in Britain’s new Labour government, the first woman to hold the job.\n\nReeves was put in charge of the country’s finances on Friday by Prime Minister Keir Starmer. She gets a job and title, Chancellor of the Exchequer, that dates to the 16th century.\n\nThe former Bank of England economist faces the daunting task of delivering Labour’s promise to get the economy growing and invest in public services while working with a large national debt.\n\n“I know that the road ahead will not be easy. There are no quick fixes and the hard choices lie ahead,” she said Friday.\n\nStarmer is appointing his Cabinet on Friday after winning a landslide election victory.\n\nLabour’s deputy leader Angela Rayner has been appointed as Britain’s deputy prime minister.\n\nRayner was the first senior politician to be appointed by Prime Minister Keir Starmer as he begins the work of appointing his Cabinet.\n\nRayner will also take the role of the Secretary for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities.\n\nRayner has often spoken about her tough background growing up in a deprived public housing block and leaving school early as a young mother.\n\nShe started her career as a trade union official before embarking on a career as a lawmaker.\n\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage, who has long been one of Britain’s most divisive politicians, was booed and heckled by several protesters before he delivered a speech in London.\n\nSeveral protesters were escorted out of the room as the right-wing politician repeatedly shouted “Boring!” at their heckling. Farage told one of the protesters to return to the pub.\n\nFarage, 60, won a seat in Parliament for the first time after seven previous failed attempts. His newly-formed Reform party won four of the House of Commons’ 650 seats in Thursday’s election on the back of a campaign focused on cutting immigration in Britain.\n\nFarage’s campaign was tainted by a string of controversies sparked by racist or misogynistic comments reportedly made by his candidates. On Thursday, he said he was going to “professionalize” his party, adding: “Those few bad apples that have crept in will be long gone and we will never have any of their type back in our organisation.”\n\nAfter a few hours of sleep to shake off a night of celebration and an audience with the king, Keir Starmer stepped through the front door of 10 Downing St. for the first time as prime minister on Friday.\n\nWhen he did, he entered the alternate reality of a man who meets regularly with King Charles III and has ultimate control of Britain’s nuclear missiles, all while adjusting to life in a creaking 17th-century landmark and trying to balance his work with his personal life.\n\n▶ Read more about the traditions and responsibilities Starmer faces on his first day.\n\nLabour leader Keir Starmer has arrived at Buckingham Palace to accept the request of King Charles III to form a government after his party’s landslide victory.\n\nIn a ceremony known as the “kissing of hands,” Starmer will officially become U.K. prime minister. He will then head to his official residence at 10 Downing Street.\n\nStarmer’s arrival at the palace is part of the choreography of changing governments that harkens back to a time when the king exercised supreme power and chose his preeminent minister – the prime minister – to run his government.\n\nThe modern-day constitutional monarchy echoes that tradition, with the king officially offering the post to the party that holds a majority in the House of Commons.\n\nRishi Sunak’s campaign to remain as U.K. prime minister showed a lack of political touch.\n\nThe Conservative Party’s problems were grave before the election but missteps by Britain’s first multimillionaire prime minister contributed to the party’s defeat.\n\nPredecessors such as Tony Blair and Boris Johnson were politically divergent but able to connect with voters. As for Sunak, he didn’t have to call the election until January 2025.\n\nHe defied political advice by doing so in May — with Conservative support dwindling steadily amid an economic slump, ethics scandals and a revolving door of leaders over the last two years. The Conservative Party also didn’t appear ready for the campaign compared with Labour, and voters haven’t feel the improvement in Britain’s economy.\n\n▶ Read more on Sunak’s downfall.\n\nRishi Sunak has left the prime minister’s residence and headed to Buckingham Palace to offer his resignation to King Charles III.\n\n“This is a difficult day, but I leave this job honored to have been prime minister of the best country in the world,” Sunak said in his final speech outside 10 Downing Street. Sunak said he had given the job his all.\n\nSunak conceded defeat earlier in the morning as vote counts confirmed exit polls that had projected a landslide defeat for his Conservatives to the Labour Party.\n\nAfter Sunak resigns, Labour leader Keir Starmer will go to the palace to seek the king’s blessing to form a government.\n\nAfter performing the “kissing of hands,” the new prime minister will head to his official residence, where he is expected to speak.\n\n“Developing a stable and mutually beneficial China-UK relationship is in line with the fundamental interests of the two peoples, and is conducive to both sides responding to global challenges together and promoting world peace and development,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Friday.\n\n“We hope to work with the UK to move China-UK relations forward on the right track on the basis of mutual respect and win-win cooperation,” Mao said at a daily press briefing.\n\nChina-UK relations have been roiled in the last few years by blocks on Chinese investment in Britain over national security concerns, tensions in the South China Sea and China’s crackdown on democracy and free speech in the former British colony of Hong Kong in violation of its pledge to keep such institutions intact until 2047.\n\nOne of the casualties of the Labour Party’s landslide win was a former member.\n\nGeorge Galloway, the leader of the Workers Party of Britain, lost the seat he won only months ago in a special election where he mobilized support against the Labour Party’s stance on Gaza.\n\nGalloway, who did not stay to listen to the result, lost his Rochdale seat to Labour’s Paul Waugh, a former journalist.\n\nRochdale, like many other northern towns, has a sizable Muslim population.\n\nLabour leader Keir Starmer has faced criticism within Muslim circles over his strong backing for Israel in the wake of the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7. He has subsequently shifted his position to call for a ceasefire.\n\nGalloway, a left-wing disruptor, was expelled by Labour in 2003.\n\nThe leaders of Australia and New Zealand have sent their congratulations to Labour Party leader Keir Starmer on his election victory.\n\nAustralia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a social media post on X that he looked forward “to working constructively” with the new British government.\n\nNew Zealand’s Prime Minister Christopher Luxon also took to X to congratulate Starmer, writing: “New Zealand and the UK are great friends and can do so much more together.”\n\nLuxon added his thanks to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak “for your service to your nation and friendship to New Zealand.”\n\nDowning Street cat Larry prepares for new UK prime minister in Number 10\n\nAs the U.K. awaits a new prime minister, one feline was also patiently waiting to be let into No. 10 Downing Street.\n\nLarry, Britain’s mouse-catcher in chief and long time resident at the leader’s official residence, was pictured waiting outside the famous black door early Friday.\n\nThe tabby cat was not bothered by the large crowd of press photographers waiting outside ahead of the change of power expected later Friday. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is expected to go to King Charles III to tender his resignation, and soon after Labour leader Keir Starmer will meet the monarch to be officially appointed.\n\nLarry was recruited by former Prime Minister David Cameron to tackle rats seen scuttling close to the British leader’s official residence, and entered Downing Street in February 2011.\n\nLabour leader Keir Starmer, who is set to become the first Labour prime minister in 14 years, says his government will always put “country first, party second.”\n\nHe said a “mandate like this comes with great responsibility,” and added that his government will be focused on “national renewal.”\n\n“We have to return politics to public service,” he said.\n\nWith more than half of all 650 seats counted, Labour looks set to secure one of its biggest ever majorities in the House of Commons.\n\nStarmer is expected to pay a visit to King Charles III later Friday to get the monarch’s permission to form a new government.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak says the British people have “delivered a sobering verdict,” and the Labour Party has won the election.\n\nSunak, who held onto his seat in North Yorkshire, told those gathered: “The Labour party has won this general election.”\n\n“I take responsibility for the loss,” he said. “To the many good, hard-working Conservative candidates who lost tonight, despite their tireless efforts, their local records and delivery, and their dedication to their communities. I am sorry.”\n\nHe added that he has called Labour leader Keir Starmer to congratulate him on his victory.\n\n“Today, power will change hands in a peaceful and orderly manner, with goodwill on all sides. That is something that should give us all confidence in our country’s stability and future,” Sunak said.\n\nWhile the Labour Party appears headed for a landslide U.K. election victory, it seems clear that it has suffered in areas with big Muslim communities over its stance on the conflict in Gaza.\n\nA prominent Labour member, Jonathan Ashworth, lost his Leicester South seat in central England to an independent candidate who had Gaza at the heart of his campaign.\n\nAshworth, who was expected to be appointed to the Cabinet, lost around 20,000 votes when compared to the election of 2019.\n\nEven Labour leader Keir Starmer saw his majority in his Holborn and St. Pancras seat in north London reduced, with more than 7,000 votes going to a pro-Gaza candidate.\n\nAfter the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel by Hamas militants, Starmer took a strongly pro-Israel stance and maintained it even as the death toll in Gaza swelled. Many Muslims who had been traditional Labour voters were aghast and have clearly turned to other candidates.\n\nNigel Farage, the leader of the hard-right Reform UK party, has been elected to Parliament.\n\nFarage won the contest in the seaside town of Clacton-on-Sea, becoming a lawmaker at his eighth try after seven failed election attempts.\n\nPartial results show the anti-immigration Reform, successor to the Brexit Party, has taken votes from both the Conservatives and Labour.\n\nFarage said the party was “going to come second in hundreds of constituencies.” It is not yet clear how many seats Reform will win.\n\nHe said there is a “massive gap” in the right of British politics, and it was his job to fill it.\n\n“My plan is to build a mass national movement over the course of the next few years,” he said.\n\nLabour leader Keir Starmer says “voters have spoken and they are ready for change” as an exit poll points to a landslide win for his party.\n\nStarmer spoke as he won his seat in north London but on a much-reduced majority.\n\nAddressing the audience, he spoke of the need to return politics to “public service” and the need for “change.”\n\nHe thanked voters for electing him to serve “my home, where my kids have grown up, where my wife was born.”\n\n“It all starts with you. Change begins in this community,” he said. “You have voted, it is now time for us to deliver.”\n\nThe independent candidate is hoping to unseat Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in his seat of Richmond and North Allerton.\n\nThe self-described intergalactic space warrior is a satirical character created by comedian David Harvey. He has said his ambition was to conquer “the entire omniverse.” He also said he hoped that his campaign will raise a smile and show that “democracy is alive”.\n\n“There’s something wonderful that in the year of 2024 when so many countries are going to the polls and democracy is under threat like never before, it’s still possible to do what I do,” he said in a recent interview.\n\nLabour’s Rachel Reeves, who is set to become the first female Treasury chief if her party wins the U.K. election, said she is “under no illusions” about the scale of the challenge she will face.\n\n“The severity of the inheritance from the Conservatives is truly awful,” she told Sky News.\n\nReeves noted that the U.K.'s debt burden is running at 100% of the country’s national income and the tax burden at a seven-decade high.\n\nShe said she “can’t promise to turn everything around straight away.”\n\nReeves said the driving mission of an incoming Labour government is to kickstart economic growth.\n\n1 of 4 |\n\nBoxes of votes are emptied ready to be counted for the British Parliamentary constituency of Holborn and St Pancras where the Labour Party leader Keir Starmer is standing for election, in London, Thursday, July 4, 2024.

(AP Photo/Kin Cheung)\n\nVoting in the U.K. is done the old-school way — no voting machines are used. Instead, voters put a pencil to paper, and all ballot papers are counted manually.\n\nAfter ballot boxes are opened, the ballot papers in the box are mixed with postal vote ballot papers and the counting begins at counting centers across the U.K.\n\nSeveral dozen seats are expected to be declared from now until around 0100GMT to 0200GMT – including Labour leader Keir Starmer’s London seat, Holborn and St. Pancras.\n\nFrom 0200GMT onwards will be the busiest part of the night, with more than 200 seats expected to be declared.\n\nBy around 0300GMT, enough results should be known to suggest which party is on course to win.\n\nA leading political analyst says British voters will see a major change in political atmosphere if Labour wins the election.\n\nAnand Menon, professor of European Politics and Foreign Affairs at King’s College London, said the last few years under the Conservatives had been “politics as pantomime. A very unstable Conservative Party with lots of infighting, with lots of ministerial churn, with no stability.\n\n“I think we’re going to have to get used again to relatively stable government, with ministers staying in power for quite a long time, and with government being able to think beyond the very short term as to medium term objectives,” Menon said.\n\nA Labour Party candidate has won the first U.K. seat to report its result in the general election.\n\nBridget Phillipson, who is Labour’s education spokesperson, won with a majority of 7,169 in the Houghton and Sunderland South seat in the northeast of England from the second-placed candidate.\n\nThat’s more than double the majority she won last time the seat was contested in 2019.\n\nThe candidate from the recently formed, anti-immigration Reform UK Party came second, pushing the candidate from the governing Conservative Party into third.\n\nPhillipson said the result represented a vote for “hope and unity, not decline and division.”\n\nWith an exit poll suggesting that Britain’s Labour Party is set to win a huge majority, some in Britain are recalling the election results of 1997, when Tony Blair led Labour to a landslide victory.\n\nIn 1997, the Labour Party had been out of power for longer than it has been now — 18 years compared to the current 14.\n\nSo it was quite a turnaround when Labour, under the leadership of the youthful Blair, won the May 1, 1997 general election decisively. “New Labour, New Britain” was the party’s slogan, and “Things can only get better” by D-ream was its theme song.\n\nUnder Blair, Labour won a majority of 179 seats, even bigger than the party’s victory over Winston Churchill’s Conservatives soon after the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945.\n\n▶ Read more on how Tony Blair and Labour won in 1997. You can also take a look at other big election moments after World War II, like Margaret Thatcher’s win and Winston Churchill’s defeat.\n\nLeading members of Britain’s main political parties are reacting to the exit poll suggesting the opposition Labour Party winning a landslide victory and returning to power for the first time since 2010.\n\nLabour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, told Sky News that the Conservatives are getting punished by voters for “14 years of the chaos and the scandals and the decline.”\n\nLabour’s national campaign chief, Pat McFadden, said the transformation of his party since its poor showing in the 2019 election has been “remarkable.”\n\nWe have campaigned as a changed Labour Party, ready to change Britain.\n\nLabour’s national campaign chief, Pat McFadden\n\nMeanwhile, Ruth Davidson, the former leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said the exit poll pointed to a “massacre” for the party.\n\nThe projection suggests that the Conservatives will end up with its lowest number of seats in the House of Commons since 1906.\n\nThe exit poll suggests that the opposition Labour Party is on course to win 410 of the House of Commons’ 650 seats.\n\nThe Conservatives are set for 131 seats — the lowest number of Conservative lawmakers on record.\n\nThe exit poll also forecasts the left-of-center Liberal Democrats will take 61 seats, and the right-wing, anti-immigration Reform UK is predicted to take 13. The Green Party is expected to take 2.\n\nThe Scottish National Party, SNP, are expected to secure 10 seats.\n\nBritain’s exit poll is conducted by asking thousands of people at over 100 polling stations to privately fill out a replica ballot showing how they have voted.\n\nResearchers go back to the same polling stations in each national election and compare the results over time. The exit poll usually provides a reliable — though not exact — projection of the final result.\n\nOne of the significant unknowns in the U.K election is how the turnout will influence the outcome. The number of people who voted won’t be known until after polls close.\n\nThe U.K. has 67 million residents and 46 million were registered to vote in the last general election in 2019. Turnout at that time was 67%.\n\nIn local elections in May — when Conservatives suffered heavy losses in council seats and mayoral offices — turnout averaged 30%, the Institute for Government, an independent think tank, reported.\n\nConservatives expressed optimism that reports of high turnout on Thursday could help them overcome polls that have suggested a widespread Labour victory.\n\nOn the other hand, with a double-digit lead in the polls ahead of election day, Labour fears supporters will be complacent and won’t vote. They’ve urged their supporters to go to the polling stations and vote."
