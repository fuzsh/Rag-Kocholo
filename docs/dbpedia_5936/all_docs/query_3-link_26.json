        "text": "Waste management company Biffa has signed its largest ever Materials Recycling Facility (MRF) contract with the North London Waste Authority (NLWA).\n\nAs part of the new contract, Biffa will process up to 120,000 tonnes of dry mixed recycling per year, from eight out of 10 lots in North London. The recycling will then be sorted at Biffa’s MRF in Edmonton, North London.\n\nThe agreement, worth up to £90 million, continues a 10-year relationship between Biffa and the NLWA, which includes seven north London boroughs (Barnet, Camden, Enfield, Hackney, Haringey, Islington and Waltham Forest). Beginning in December 2019, the new contract will initially run until 2025, but could continue for up to a decade.\n\nAlongside sorting and recycling services, Biffa has committed to support the NLWA on a number of community projects, for example the #BinYourNappy campaign, which aims to reduce the amount of used nappies put in the recycling bin. The company has also pledged to donate to the NLWA’s ‘Waste Prevention Community Fund’, which provides community organisations with funding to tackle waste prevention. This comes as part of NLWA’s Wise Up To Waste campaign, which seeks to encourage North London residents to increase their recycling rates and change their attitudes towards waste.\n\nCommenting on the new contract, Steve Oulds, National Commercial Manager for MRFs at Biffa, said: “I am delighted that we will be continuing our relationship with the NLWA, who we have enjoyed a great relationship with for a number of years.\n\n“Together we have done some fantastic work with the local community, particularly the recent campaign to encourage people not to put nappies in their recycling bins. We hope to continue supporting these types of worthwhile projects and look forward to working with the NLWA over the coming years.”\n\nAlongside Biffa, NLWA has also awarded a replacement contract to Bywaters (Leyton) Ltd for processing mixed dry recyclables.\n\nAndrew O’Connor, Head of Strategy and Services at NLWA, added: “NLWA is very pleased that we will be continuing to work with our existing contractors to provide an excellent recycling service for north London residents.\n\n“In awarding these contracts North London will be able to continue recycling a wide range of materials; under the new contracts we will see improved reporting and traceability of end destinations for recycling, providing further reassurance to North London residents about what happens to their recyclable material.\n\n“The new contracts will also bring particular additional benefits for the local community; for example, Biffa will be contributing to NLWA’s Community Fund, which supports local voluntary organisations to deliver activities that help local people reduce their waste.”"
