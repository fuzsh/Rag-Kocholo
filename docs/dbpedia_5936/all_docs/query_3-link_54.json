        "text": "Taylor Woodrow, the civils subsidiary of Vinci Construction, has a won a £100m contract on an energy-from-waste project in north London.\n\nThe contractor will build recycling infrastructure at the £1.2bn sustainable waste management hub in Edmonton EcoPark for the North London Waste Authority (NLWA). Taylor Woodrow will construct a public reuse and recycling centre, visitor and community centre, as well as resource recovery facility to manage 135,000 tonnes of recyclable material every year.\n\nAnnouncing the firm’s appointment, NLWA highlighted Taylor Woodrow’s work on other energy-from-waste projects in North Yorkshire and Cornwall.\n\nIt represents the first major building works in the NLWA’s plans for the land next to the River Lea in Enfield. A £683m Energy Recovery Facility (ERF), with the capacity to manage 700,000 tonnes of residual waste per annum, will be built at the north of the site. The search for a contractor for this began last month and contractors have until 1pm on Friday 11 September to complete the selection questionnaire.\n\nPreparatory works at EcoPark started in January 2019 with Buckingham Group currently building a construction laydown area east of the River Lea. Galldris Construction Services is constructing a new access point to the north of the site and preparing a new offsite transport yard, and Barhale is scheduled to carry out the sewer diversion works this year. Work is scheduled to start on EcoPark South in early 2021.\n\nTaylor Woodrow’s appointment is the first major milestone since the project received a development consent order in February 2017. Programme director David Cullen told the Construction News Summit in December 2019 it had been difficult to generate interest among contractors for the initial phases.\n\n“Quite frankly, we have had a bit of a struggle attracting attention to our project. We engaged quite substantially with the market, we’ve had a lot of market-information days and tried to generate interest, but it has been an uphill struggle,” he said at the time, adding that, work to promote preliminary works was ultimately successful."
