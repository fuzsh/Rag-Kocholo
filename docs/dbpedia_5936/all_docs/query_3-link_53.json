        "text": "The North London Waste Authority (NLWA) has announced it will not move forward with plans for a waste disposal plant in Pinkham Way and will withdraw the application.\n\nCampaign group the Pinkham Way Alliance fought against the plans for the plant, which would have been sited next to Muswell Hill Golf Course, arguing the facility would affect air quality and lead to increased traffic on the North Circular Road.\n\nThe NLWA says the Pinkham Way site is still in their plans as of a delivery, sorting and transfer point for recyclable material and other waste from local households.\n\nCouncillor Clyde Loakes, chair of NLWA said: “I hope today’s announcement on the future use of the Pinkham Way site will provide some further clarity and certainty for local people.\n\n“They now know that subject to a successful planning application at the existing Edmonton site, there should be no residual waste treatment at Pinkham Way.”\n\nThe NLWA will continue with plans for a waste treatment plan in Edmonton, Enfield."
