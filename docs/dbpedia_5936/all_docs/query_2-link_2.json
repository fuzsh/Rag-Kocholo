We are committed to ensuring our actions and funding are entirely transparent. Policy Connect’s work in supporting the APSRG is funded through a combination of annual fees for membership of Policy Connect and ad hoc sponsorship of particular events and research, all of which is declared on the official Parliamentary Register of All-Party Groups. We also publish a full list of all of Policy Connect’s funders in bands on our website.\n\nThe APSRG aims to inform the debate between parliamentarians, business leaders and the sustainable resource community. The agenda and activities of the APSRG is set by its Parliamentary Officers, and Policy Connect has full editorial control over the outputs from work produced as a result of this agenda, such as reports. The APPG operates according to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards’ rules on All-Party Parliamentary Groups and its own Code of Governance."
