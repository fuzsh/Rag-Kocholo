        "text": "Head of the government of Greater London\n\nThis article is about the directly elected mayor of Greater London. For the City of London mayor, see Lord Mayor of London. For the mayors of London, Ontario, see List of mayors of London, Ontario.\n\nMayor of London\n\nIncumbent\n\nSadiq Khan\n\nsince 9 May 2016\n\nGreater London AuthorityStyleNo courtesy or style ascribed[1]TypeCouncil LeaderStatusChief executive officerMember ofReports toLondon AssemblySeatCity Hall, LondonAppointerElectorate of LondonTerm lengthFour years, renewableConstituting instrumentGreater London Authority Act 1999, s 2(1)(a)Inaugural holderKen LivingstoneDeputyStatutory Deputy Mayor of LondonSalary£152,734[2]Websitelondon.gov.uk/mayor\n\nThe mayor of London is the chief executive of the Greater London Authority. The role was created in 2000 after the Greater London devolution referendum in 1998, and was the first directly elected mayor in the United Kingdom.[3]\n\nThe current mayor is Sadiq Khan, who took office on 9 May 2016. The position was held by Ken Livingstone from the creation of the role on 4 May 2000 until he was defeated in May 2008 by Boris Johnson, who then also served two terms before being succeeded by Khan.\n\nThe mayor is scrutinised by the London Assembly and, supported by their Mayoral Cabinet, directs the entirety of London, including the City of London (for which there is also the Lord Mayor of the City of London). Each London Borough also has a ceremonial mayor or, in Croydon, Hackney, Lewisham, Newham and Tower Hamlets, an elected mayor.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Greater London Council, the elected government for Greater London, was abolished in 1986 by the Local Government Act 1985. Strategic functions were split off to various joint arrangements. Londoners voted in a referendum in 1998 to create a new governance structure for Greater London. The directly elected mayor of London was created by the Greater London Authority Act 1999 in 2000 as part of the reforms.\n\nElections\n\nMain article: London mayoral elections\n\nThe mayor is elected by the first-past-the-post system for a fixed term of four years, with elections taking place in May. Prior to the Elections Act 2022, the supplementary vote method was used. There are no limits on the number of terms a mayor may serve. The mayor is elected by the largest single-member electorate in the United Kingdom.\n\nAs with most elected posts in the United Kingdom, there is a deposit (in this case of £10,000), which is returnable on the candidate's winning of at least 5% of votes cast.\n\nMost recent election\n\nMain article: 2024 London mayoral election\n\nThe most recent London mayoral election was held on 2 May 2024.[4] The results of the election were announced on 4 May 2024.[5] Sadiq Khan was re-elected as mayor and became the first to be elected for 3 terms, beating the Conservative Susan Hall.\n\nList of mayors\n\nColour key\n\n(for political parties)\n\n# Portrait Name\n\n(Birth–Death) Term of office Elected Political party Previous, concurrent and subsequent political offices Education 1 Ken Livingstone\n\n(born 1945) 4 May 2000 4 May 2008[note 1] 20002004 IndependentLabour Councillor[note 2] (1973–1986)\n\nLeader of the Greater London Council (1981–1986)\n\nMember of Parliament for Brent East (1987–2001)\n\nTulse Hill Comprehensive School\n\nPhilippa Fawcett Teacher Training College\n\n2,922 days 2 Boris Johnson\n\n(born 1964) 4 May 2008 9 May 2016 20082012 Conservative Member of Parliament for Henley (2001–2008)\n\nMember of Parliament for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (2015–2023)\n\nSecretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (2016–2018)\n\nLeader of the Conservative Party (2019–2022)\n\nPrime Minister (2019–2022) 2,927 days 3\n\nSadiq Khan\n\n(born 1970) 9 May 2016[8] Incumbent 201620212024 Labour Member of Parliament for Tooting (2005–2016)\n\nMinister of State for Transport (2009–2010)\n\nShadow Secretary of State for Justice and Shadow Lord Chancellor (2010–2015) 3,017 days\n\nTimeline\n\nTimeline\n\nPowers and functions\n\nMost powers are derived from the Greater London Authority Act 1999, with additional functions coming from the Greater London Authority Act 2007, the Localism Act 2011 and Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011.\n\nThe mayor's main functions are:[9][10]\n\nStrategic planning, including housing, waste management, the environment and production of the London Plan\n\nRefuse or permit planning permission on strategic grounds\n\nTransport policy, delivered by functional body Transport for London\n\nFire and emergency planning, delivered by functional body London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority\n\nPolicing and crime policy, delivered by functional body Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime (before 2012 by functional body Metropolitan Police Authority). The Metropolitan Police has a structure different to most others across the country, reporting to the Mayor of London instead of a police and crime commissioner.\n\nEconomic development, delivered directly by the Greater London Authority through subsidiary company GLA Land and Property (before 2012 by functional body London Development Agency)\n\nPower to create development corporations, such as the London Legacy Development Corporation\n\nThe remaining local government functions are performed by the London borough councils. There is some overlap; for example, the borough councils are responsible for waste management, but the mayor is required to produce a waste management strategy.[11] In 2010, Johnson launched an initiative in partnership with the Multi-academy Trust AET to transform schools across London. This led to the establishment of London Academies Enterprise Trust (LAET) which was intended to be a group of ten academies, but it only reached a group of four before the mayor withdrew it in 2013.\n\nThe following is a table comparing power over services of the boroughs to the GLA and mayor.\n\nService Greater London Authority London borough councils Education Y Housing Y Y Planning applications Y Strategic planning Y Y Transport planning Y Y Passenger transport Y Highways Y Y Police Y Fire Y Social services Y Libraries Y Leisure and recreation Y Waste collection Y Waste disposal Y Environmental health Y Revenue collection Y\n\nInitiatives\n\nKen Livingstone\n\nInitiatives taken by Ken Livingstone as Mayor of London included the London congestion charge on private vehicles using city centre London on weekdays, the creation of the London Climate Change Agency, the London Energy Partnership and the founding of the international Large Cities Climate Leadership Group, now known as C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group. The congestion charge led to many new buses being introduced across London. In August 2003, Livingstone oversaw the introduction of the Oyster card electronic ticketing system for Transport for London services.[12] Livingstone supported the withdrawal of the vintage AEC Routemaster buses from regular service in London.[13]\n\nLivingstone introduced the London Partnerships Register which was a voluntary scheme without legal force for same sex couples to register their partnership, and paved the way for the introduction by the United Kingdom Parliament of civil partnerships and later still, Same-sex marriage. Unlike civil partnerships, the London Partnerships Register was open to heterosexual couples who favour a public commitment other than marriage.\n\nAs Mayor of London, Livingstone was a supporter of the London Olympics in 2012, ultimately winning the bid to host the Games in 2005. Livingstone encouraged sport in London; especially when sport could be combined with helping charities like The London Marathon and 10K charity races. Livingstone, in a mayoral election debate on the BBC's Question Time in April 2008, stated that the primary reason he supported the Olympic bid was to secure funding for the redevelopment of the East End of London. In July 2007, he brought the Tour de France cycle race to London.\n\nBoris Johnson\n\nIn May 2008, Boris Johnson introduced a new transport safety initiative to put 440 high visibility police officers in and around bus stations.[14] A ban on alcohol on underground, and Docklands Light Railway, tram services and stations across the capital was introduced.[15]\n\nAlso in May 2008, he announced the closure of The Londoner newspaper, saving approximately £2.9 million. A percentage of this saving was to be spent on planting 10,000 new street trees.[16]\n\nIn 2010, he extended the coverage of Oyster card electronic ticketing to all National Rail overground train services.[17] Also in 2010, he opened a cycle hire scheme (originally sponsored by Barclays, now Santander) with 5,000 bicycles available for hire across London. Although initiated by his predecessor, Ken Livingstone, the scheme rapidly acquired the nickname of \"Boris Bikes\". Johnson withdrew the recently introduced high-speed high-capacity \"bendy buses\" from service in 2011 which had been bought by Livingstone, and he instead supported the development of the New Routemaster[18] which entered service the next year.\n\nIn 2011, Boris Johnson set up the Outer London Fund of £50 million designed to help facilitate improve local high streets.[19] Areas in London were given the chance to submit proposals for two tranches of funding. Successful bids for Phase 1 included Enfield,[20] Muswell Hill[21] and Bexley town centre.[22] The recipients of phase 2 funding were still to be announced As of 2011 .\n\nIn January 2013, he appointed journalist Andrew Gilligan as the first Cycling Commissioner for London.[23] In March 2013, Johnson announced £1 billion of investment in infrastructure to make cycling safer in London, including a 15-mile (24 km) East to West segregated 'Crossrail for bikes'.[24]\n\nAt the General Election of 7 May 2015, Johnson was elected MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip,[25] He continued to serve as mayor until the mayoral election in May 2016, when Sadiq Khan was elected.\n\nSadiq Khan\n\nSadiq Khan introduced the 'bus hopper' fare on TfL buses, which allows passengers to board a second bus within one hour for the same fare.[26] Under Khan, paper, coin and cash transactions became obsolete. The Oyster system was expanded to include debit and credit cards. This initiative was started under his predecessor, Johnson.[27]\n\nUpon election, Khan outlined a vision to make London the \"greenest city\" by investing in walking and cycling infrastructure while reducing polluting vehicles.[28] In 2019, the \"Ultra Low Emission Zone\" scheme was launched which taxes highly polluting vehicles in its covered territory.[29] London declared itself the world's first \"National Park City\" (effective from July 2019),[30] reflecting its unusually high amount of green space for a city of its size.[31]\n\nExtended term\n\nThe Government postponed all elections due in May 2020, including for the mayor of London, for one year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Khan had therefore served a term in office of five years rather than four, which ended in May 2021.[32] He was re-elected in 2021 for a shortened three-year term,[33] defeating the Conservative candidate Shaun Bailey.[34][35]\n\nSee also\n\nLondon portal\n\nForeign relations of the Mayor of London\n\nLeaders of the Greater London Council\n\nTimeline of London § 21st century\n\nNotes\n\nReferences"
