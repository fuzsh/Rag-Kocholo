It is a stimulus for promoting graduation from high school, and it provides instruction and rewarding opportunities that will benefit the student, community and Nation. JROTC teaches young men and women the kind of self-discipline, self-confidence, and leadership skills that can help them successfully meet the challenges of adulthood. This program is conducted at accredited secondary schools throughout the Nation, by instructors who are retired Navy, Army, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard officers and enlisted personnel.\n\nInformation about each military service's JROTC program is found on their respective websites.

Selective service is not part of the Department of Defense.\n\nAlmost all male U.S. citizens and male immigrants, who are 18 through 25, are required to register with Selective Service.\n\nIt’s important to know that even though he is registered, a man will not automatically be inducted into the military. In a crisis requiring a draft, men would be called in a sequence determined by random lottery number and year of birth. Then, they would be examined for mental, physical, and moral fitness by the military before being deferred or exempted from military service or inducted into the Armed Forces.\n\nThe U.S. Selective Service website has more information, including how to register and who must register.\n\nView More\n\nService members and their families have proven their strength in weathering unique issues, such as frequent moves, deployments and separations from loved ones.

DEERS registration is required for TRICARE eligibility and enrollment.\n\nYou are responsible for keeping your information current on your record. Active Duty and retired service members are automatically registered in DEERS, but they must take action to register their family members and ensure they are correctly entered into the database. Once registered in DEERS it is important to keep your DEERS records updated when personal eligibility information changes. This includes addresses and family status (marriage, divorce, birth, adoption, etc.). Mistakes in the DEERS database can cause problems with TRICARE claims, so it is critical to maintain your DEERS information. Retail network pharmacies check TRICARE eligibility through DEERS. Prescriptions will be filled only for beneficiaries who are listed as eligible in DEERS.\n\nFor more information on updating and correcting your information within DEERS please click on the link below.\n\nLink: https://milconnect.dmdc.osd.mil/milconnect/public/faq/DEERS-Updating_and_Correcting_DEERS_Data\n\nView More\n\nVeterans who believe the characterization of their discharge from military service was unjust, erroneous, or warrants an upgrade are encouraged to apply for a discharge upgrade or correction.\n\nAll branches of the military consider you to have a strong case for a discharge upgrade if you can show your discharge was connected to any of these categories:\n\nMental health conditions, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\n\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI)\n\nSexual assault or harassment during military service\n\nSexual orientation (including discharges under the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy)\n\nThe Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs jointly operate an online tool to facilitate your application process.

A few examples of records that may be corrected include: administrative information, pay and allowances, decorations and awards, performance evaluations and derogatory information, disabilities, promotions and rank, and separation and discharges*.\n\n*NOTE: Service members who are seeking a discharge upgrade and have been separated for less than 15 years, must first submit the DD Form 293, Application for the Review of Discharge from the Armed Forces of the Unites States, to their respective Service Discharge Review Board.\n\nWhen applying to your respective BCM/NR, download and use the most current version of the DD Form 149 located on the Official DoD Website for DoD Forms:\n\nhttps://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/forms/dd/dd0149.pdf.

If you are a veteran or a member of the Army, Navy, Marines, or Air Force and are serving as active duty, reserve, or guard, or if you are retired, you can use the Defense Personnel Records Information Retrieval System page on the milConnect website to request and receive scanned copies of documents in your OMPF.\n\nIn some cases, OMPF records are not yet scanned into the DPRIS system on milConnect.

Such military titles must never be used in any manner which may bring discredit to the uniformed services.\n\nThe use of military titles is prohibited in connection with commercial enterprises when such use, with or without the intent to mislead, gives rise to any appearance of sponsorship or approval by the uniformed services or the Department of Defense.\n\nMilitary titles will not be a part of the signature block of a retired service member when signing official correspondence as a civil service employee.\n\nRetirees not on active duty will not use their military titles in connection with public appearances outside the United States unless such use is authorized by the appropriate overseas commander.\n\nWhen military titles are used by members to sign their names to documents that pertain to them personally, they must show that they are in a retired status after the grade. Social and business calling cards must reflect the retired status.\n\nIn a military office, retirees using military titles on the telephone could lead to confusion and unwitting misrepresentation, conveying the impression of active-duty status. In any case, common sense is the guide when a retired service member works for the Government. No reasonable retired officer would invite awkwardness when employed in a military office by insisting on being called by a military title if such title outranks the retired service member's active-duty chief.\n\nThe retired service member's use of his rightful title in government employment is guided by his acceptance of his civilian status and loyal conformance to the established channels of command. Local customs, practices and conditions of employment are the primary influencing factors.\n\nView More\n\nDefense Finance and Accounting Service\n\nAs one of the world’s largest finance and accounting operations, DFAS manages and processes the pay for all DOD military and civilian personnel, retirees and annuitants, as well as major DOD contractors and vendors.\n\nNearly all questions about pay and annuities will be answered by reviewing the extensive DFAS frequently asked questions pages and its secure AskDFAS system.\n\nIf you still have questions or need to speak with a DFAS professional, please visit the DFAS customer service center to find the correct phone numbers to reach the appropriate customer service team member:\n\nmyPay\n\nmyPay is the online system operated by DFAS for military members, retirees and DOD civilian employees to access their pay information and make their own changes immediately with user-friendly technology.

Under U.S. Code Title 18, Section 506, unauthorized use of the seals may include, but is not limited to commercial, marketing, advertising or promotion use by any nongovernment entity and is punishable.\n\nMilitary services have provided alternatives to their seals for commercial purposes. They include logos or coats of arms. Permission to use any of these emblems must be granted by the respective services. There is no substitute for the Defense Department seal.\n\nMost DOD and Military Service seals contain the words “DEPARTMENT OF.” For example, “DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE,” “DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY,” etc. The U.S. Coast Guard Seal is distinguished by the gold rope surrounding the anchors instead of the words “DEPARTMENT OF.” Other DOD Components and agency insignia may have a similar appearance. Emblems are often mistaken for seals because they are similar in shape. Please see this graphic for more information.\n\nUsing the DOD Seal\n\nThe DOD Seal may only be used in an official capacity by DOD or DOD Components. Similarly, DOD logos or emblems containing the words \"Department of\" are generally restricted for internal, departmental use only.\n\nOfficial use\n\nOfficial use is considered when the DOD seal or logo are used on internal DOD presentations, letterhead, publications, or governmental websites where the content is produced by DOD personnel. Contact the Military Service POC or OATSD(PA) if you are unsure whether or not you may use an official seal or logo.\n\nView More\n\nThe Defense Department, including Military Services, does not allow private third parties to incorporate historic emblems into their marketing and advertising materials. Even though it may be easy to obtain and use Military Service insignia found on the Web and elsewhere, Federal trademark laws support the rights of the Defense Department to take enforcement measures to protect the respective Military Service names and marks when unauthorized use is found. Further, the Department strives to avoid the use of its trademarks in a way that may suggest the DOD or the Military Services endorse a particular company, product, service, or website, or is connected to or affiliated with a non-Federal entity in some way.\n\nReporting unauthorized use\n\nNon-Federal entities may be unaware that their organization is not authorized to download military insignia from other websites and display them on their website. One should not assume that a graphic design that uses military names and logos on a public website is authorized and that the creator obtained the proper licensing agreements and prior written permissions. Therefore, please report any instances of suspected unauthorized or inappropriate use of DOD or Military Service seals and insignia to osd.pentagon.pa.mbx.cpo-review@mail.mil.\n\nUse of DOD or military service trademarks or images by contractors as part of a marketing strategy\n\nEven though a company has a contract with the DOD or a Military Service, a company may not use military insignia as a part of its marketing strategy. Such unauthorized use may create the impression that the DOD or Military Service(s) endorse the company. Rather, contractors may factually state that their company was awarded a contract to do business with DOD or the Military Services. If in doubt, forward your proposed marketing mock up to osd.pentagon.pa.mbx.cpo-review@mail.mil for review.\n\nUse of military service insignia for a fundraiser\n\nUse of Military Service names and insignia are generally not permitted as part of fundraising activities. Before contacting local manufacturers regarding new products, designs or any idea for a fundraiser that includes DOD or Military Service names or marks, check with the respective Military Service Trademark Licensing Office.\n\nUse of military service insignia on a gift\n\nPermission to use Military Service names or marks on custom-made products may be considered on a case-by-case basis if the product is purchased from an approved licensee and if the product is intended for the personal use of an authorized individual. Visit the website of the appropriate Military Service Trademark Licensing Office more information or email the office with any questions.\n\nUse of military service trademarks by non-federal colleges, universities and other learning institutions to promote and advertise military programs\n\nThe Department of Defense and Military Service policies prohibit use of Military Service marks in ways that could imply endorsement of a commercial entity or activity, including non-profit organizations and educational institutions. Visit the DOD Branding & Trademark page for more details.\n\nUse of military service trademarks by political candidates or on political campaign materials\n\nPolitical candidates may refer to the fact that they served in a particular branch of the military. However, they cannot use Military Service marks in a way that would give the impression that the Military Service has endorsed their candidacy. Political candidates also should avoid using pictures of themselves in a military uniform as part of their campaign material, unless a legible disclaimer is present.\n\nView More\n\nScam avoidance education and resources\n\nMilitary members, DOD civilians, Defense contractors, veterans, and their family members serve our country with integrity and honor.
