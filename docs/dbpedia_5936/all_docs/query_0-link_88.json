        "text": "Russia invasion of Ukraine. It’s a deeply worrying time. Two weeks ago Putin ordered Russian tanks over the border into Ukraine. War has raged ever since, with major cities facing aerial bombardment and many civilians caught in the crossfire. Ukrainian resistance has been stronger than Russian forces expected, and there have been street protests against the invasion in cities across Russia. Solidarity to the Ukrainian people. Here was Momentum’s initial statement on the invasion, with a more comprehensive statement from the NCG to follow shortly.\n\nUkraine demos. Thousands have taken to the streets in the UK to show their solidarity with the Ukrainian people, with many not only opposing Russian aggression, but also the Tory government’s unwillingness to provide safe passage for Ukrainian refugees. The government’s unwillingness to welcome refugees is hardly surprising considering the Nationality and Borders Bill, which criminalises many who are travelling here to seek asylum. Sadly, Labour is once again ducking a basic matter of principle, and failing to support a visa waiver.\n\nStarmer’s power grab. With war once again raging in Europe, what does Keir Starmer decide to do? Use the moment to start another factional assault of the Labour Left. In a shockingly anti-democratic move, the Labour leadership shut down the Young Labour Twitter account, axed its Conference and slashed its funding. All for their temerity in standing up for socialist principles. Eleven socialist MPs were also forced to withdraw their signatures on a Stop the War statement, despite repeatedly condemning Putin’s aggression themselves. It is deeply authoritarian behaviour.\n\nThe fight back. The reason why they’ve had to resort to bureaucratic machinations is because the membership – and especially young members – would never consent to this kind of behaviour and the general direction they are taking the Party in. We now have a chance in the NEC, Young Labour and Labour Students elections to show our steel. Outgoing chair of Young Labour Jess Barnard joins the Grassroots Voice slate alongside current socialist NEC members Mish Rahman, Yasmine Dar and Gemma Bolton.\n\nSi Oldham is a member of Momentum Southampton and one of the co-founders of the Southampton Social Aid Group, which is a project to provide food for low-income people in the city based on principles of solidarity, not charity.\n\nWhat made you decide to start SSAG?\n\nWhen I was doorknocking, I saw lots of people struggling with food poverty and the effects of austerity. But not everyone wanted to go to a foodbank. They either weren’t in a position where they could be referred, or didn’t like the idea of a handout, or didn’t feel comfortable about going to a church to receive it.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nSo the idea is that our members will pay a weekly fee and then they get a certain amount of goods for that money. We currently have 40-50 regular users and around 200 people signed up in total. People can pay £3.50 for 10 items or £5 for 15. There are also some free items too. The idea is that all the funds go back into the service, which means we can buy goods in bulk and reduce the cost down. We are based on principles of solidarity: everyone pays in but that goes into making it cheaper and more easily available for everyone else. The more members we have, the more money we have, the greater and better quality goods that we can buy. The majority of our goods are bought at low-cost from FareShare who collect good quality surplus food from supermarkets.\n\nHow has it changed your political outlook?\n\nIn the wake of the 2019 election, I was frustrated. At Labour Conference, I saw a lot of people making speeches, a lot of people speaking at rallies, a lot of people talking about political education – but what we weren’t doing is what we should be doing as socialists. And that’s showing solidarity with people in our own communities.\n\nYes, elections are important. But we should be showing what we would do if we were in power, and actually make those changes, as much as we can do, now.\n\nBeing brought up in the neoliberal era, I think a lot of younger people just don’t understand, or haven’t had that much exposure to, principles of solidarity and sharing. If we want to bring the younger generations in who aren’t politically engaged then I think we have to go back to basics. People need to understand that sharing means more freedom!\n\nSi wants to start a website that would help to share best practice on how to set up and run social aid groups such as the SSAG. Would you be interested in helping out? Contact Simon on [email protected].\n\nThis issue we talk to Glyn Harries from Hackney Momentum about the campaign to stop the Edmonton Incinerator.\n\nWhat are the reasons behind the campaign?\n\nThe current incinerator is coming to the end of its life and the council have decided they want to build a new one. Firstly, people are worried about air pollution in the low-income area surrounding it and how it affects poor residents who already suffer health issues resulting from poverty. There’s also been a big push on what’s called environmental racism and how it would adversely affect ethnic minorities in the local area – West Africans, Caribbeans, Turks, Kurds etc.\n\nWhat is the alternative?\n\nThe council say that the only two options are either build a new incinerator or the rubbish goes in landfill, which of course has its own environmental problems. But we’ve got an opportunity here to do something akin to a Green New Deal. We could create hundreds, potentially thousands of jobs in all London’s North London’s waste being recycled – rather than put into an incinerator. The tech is there and we know how to pull out all the organic matter from everything. We have low recycling levels in the borough at the moment but the amount the North London Waste Authority spend on that currently is relatively low – we need to quadruple it.\n\nWhat are the next steps for the campaign?\n\nWe met up with Camden Momentum about a month ago and attended a march in Edmonton. We also held a well attended meeting recently to discuss the matter, and have been going to local markets to hand out flyers. The broader campaign is still going relatively strong and there is a judicial review in the works. We’ll see!\n\nWhen did you first get into politics?\n\nThe Tories came into power in 2010 when I was in year 10 at school. I remember being absolutely devastated. Teachers were really worried about what it would mean for the school’s budget as it was in quite a deprived area in King’s Lynn. Quite quickly, the cuts started to hit my local community.\n\nMy parents work in substance abuse support – the cases they were seeing were just getting worse and worse and they were eventually made redundant. Being around that made me want to get involved, get active and do something about it.\n\nWhen did you join the Labour Party?\n\nI joined in 2012. It took me a year or so to start attending meetings but when I did I was probably the youngest person there by about 25 years! I became the CLP’s women’s officer after about a year or so, and stood to become a Borough Councillor in a seat I was told was unwinnable – but ended up coming close and only losing by 50 votes. I was at uni at the time so that was quite terrifying!\n\nI then moved to Norwich to work as a youth worker where I became Women’s Officer in the CLP there and subsequently stood for County Council.\n\nWhy did you decide to become a youth worker?\n\nI had a youth worker for a brief period when I was younger, and I just found it really encouraging to have that person that’s on my side. So when I saw the job come up, I realised I wanted to be working with people, helping people and supporting them – and youth work felt like a key way to do that at that moment. Norfolk was the first area to totally axe its youth service in 2010 (Jess’s youth support work was for a charity) and mental health services have been in crisis here with just a real lack of support.\n\nHow did Corbyn becoming leader in 2015 impact your politics? Before Corbyn I don’t think I knew what was possible. I didn’t grow up in a particularly political family but I joined the Party because I knew what I was seeing was wrong.\n\nAnd then I went to see Jeremy speak at a venue in Norwich. There was a queue round the block and I think he had to speak in two different rooms. It was absolutely huge! I just remember in that moment being like right this is what I’ve been waiting for. This is what we should be fighting for. I was completely inspired to just dedicate as much time as I could. I vividly remember loads of my youth work colleagues came down as well and were completely inspired by it too.\n\nWhat are the achievements you are most proud of as Young Labour Chair?\n\nBefore I was chair, we were lucky to meet three or four times in a year as a committee. Nothing got done. Young Labour branches weren’t being affiliated to us, they were having to go through regions and being blocked. We completely changed that. So I’ve established monthly meetings where we have a section where we approve Young Labour branches directly to Young Labour.\n\nIt doesn’t sound that sexy, but it is a huge step forward in empowering young members. We’ve stood firm and in our beliefs, and stayed true to what we were elected to do. And we have fought so hard to stand for that in the face of so much pressure, threats, intimidation, and underhand tactics.\n\nThe motion to conference on Palestine was definitely a huge, huge win. The rally at Conference also – I can’t tell you the opposition I faced. At the time everyone was so demoralised. They were refusing to let us have certain speakers. But then Unite gave us a room and it was just such an incredible event. Seeing it all come together made it all worth it. And everybody that was there said that it was their favourite event of the conference, and left them inspired.\n\nYou are running on the Grassroots Voice 4 slate for the NEC elections. If elected, what do you hope to achieve?\n\nThroughout my time as Young Labour Chair, I have been contacted so many times by so many young members who have been suspended or put under investigation for really, really ridiculous charges. They often are very panicked and it has such a hugely detrimental impact on their mental health. It’s something that I really want to push back against and lobby for the reform of that process.\n\nWe need a new process that actually considers people’s wellbeing rather than just seeing it as a factional battle. We have a responsibility and duty of care to people. So for me, personally, that’s one of the big things that I want to address on the NEC. I also want to be a strong working class voice that stands up to the Party leadership as it tries to silence socialist voices."
