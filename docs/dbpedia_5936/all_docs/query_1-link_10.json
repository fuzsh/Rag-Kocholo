        "text": "As your Labour Councillors, we promised to progress Labour values at Waltham Forest Council. We never take being in power for granted and we will never be complacent. We are extremely proud of our record so far but we know we can always do more. Being a Labour-run progressive council means always fighting harder for residents and making sure that we are doing everything possible to provide a fairer future for resident of Waltham Forest.\n\nBut just like many of you, we are facing tough choices. Tough choices when it comes to finances in particular. Over the past 13 years we have lost £120 million from our budget due to intentional Conservative government cuts. We know this government thinks we have ‘fat to trim’ and it’s because of this very belief that we are being forced to raise council tax by 4.99%, along with 75% of councils in England and Wales.\n\nThe pressure on our services keeps increasing but government support has not kept up. This is not a decision we ever take lightly, but if we want to keep providing the services that we know our residents need and rely on, we have to do it. We know it’s our essential services which save lives and improve the quality of life for residents, day in day out.\n\nOur budget setting is coming up soon and I wanted to set out to you, our members, the messages we will take to the doorstep about how Waltham Forest Labour are using the council budget to create a Fairer Future. We will send a series of these emails over the next few weeks to illustrate our core beliefs and values when it comes to providing services for the residents of our borough.\n\nAs a Labour Council, we work every day to produce council services which help every resident to thrive.\n\nSo many residents are just about surviving right now, whether that’s due to inflation, the cost-of-living crisis, a hospital badly needing rebuilding or a Tory government which is doing nothing about those issues. In response, we are doing everything we can to make sure that residents are not just surviving but are thriving in our borough.\n\nOur residents have always been ambitious, and we see our role as rising to that challenge. This means radical action on housing, with our Affordable Housing Commission. We have invested £4.6 million into our cost of living campaign. We are busy working on our Health Inequalities work, to make sure that no matter where you are in the borough, you have whatever you need to live a healthy life. We are bringing a university to the borough, with the University of Portsmouth getting ready to arrive here in Waltham Forest. I don’t need to remind you about how proud we are of Mini Holland and our city-leading Climate Action Plan to get us to net zero. We protected and improved our Children and Family Centres when so many others had to close. A few months ago we used the windfall from North London Waste Authority to insulate homes, lowering bills for good.\n\nIn these times, we know value for money is very important. That’s why we are proud to be the 5th lowest council tax per dwelling in Outer London. Despite having to raise council tax, that means an extra £1.44 or extra £2.22 a week for 90% of residents and we have expanded our Council Tax Support scheme.\n\nWe also know that to thrive, we may need to do some things differently. Our new approach to local neighbourhoods means that we want residents to have everything they need to live a safe, happy, and healthy life only 15 minutes away from their homes. We are also taking a closer look at our customer services work to make sure it is meeting the needs of residents and we are focusing on our young people to ensure they feel a part of the future of our borough and have recently rolled out two new youth hub pilots.\n\nYour Labour run council is using its investment to ensure that our priorities are funded, and our borough has the financial support to thrive.\n\nWe know that a great place to live is one where the council is investing in a better borough. Waltham Forest Council is investing £533 million in our communities over the next five years. This money, whilst also supporting our plans, will also invest in the community with 1,100 local jobs and 260 apprenticeships.\n\nWaltham Forest Labour is extremely excited about all of the new positive changes to our borough – whether that’s Soho Theatre Walthamstow, £17 million in investment into culture in Walthamstow (including £4.4 million for Vestry House), £14 million on a new accessible entrance to Leyton station or the new lido.\n\nOne of our major council priorities is tackling the climate emergency and to show that we believe in acting fast and acting fairly, we have committed £50 million to decarbonise council homes. We also know that we need to be responsive to residents’ concerns. We are investing £5 million in better street lighting, more electric vehicle charging and repairing potholes – all issues residents have raised.\n\nDespite the fact that we have lost £120 million from our budget since 2010, we know that investing in our borough is proving to residents that we believe in our vision. We will continue to do that in spite of Tory cuts.\n\nAlongside our financial investment, we are also using every opportunity to lobby this Tory government for a fair deal. This means fairer funding, to ensure we don’t have to pass the burden onto residents even more, or to finally have a rebuilt Whipps Cross hospital – something we have been campaigning on for a very long time. We have also recently had to call on government to take action protecting asylum seekers and spoke to the media in strong terms about Home Office failings. We have been repeatedly writing to ministers and demanding answers and we won’t stop until we have delivered for residents."
