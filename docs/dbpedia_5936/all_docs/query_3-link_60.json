        "text": "The new Resource Recovery Facility (RRF) forms part of the first phase of North London Waste Authority’s (NLWA) plan to build a £1.2bn sustainable waste management hub at Edmonton EcoPark South.\n\nOne of the largest waste authorities in the UK, the NLWA will create the new facility across three buildings that will increase recycling rates and invest in a sustainable future for the local communities. This £100m investment in modern recycling infrastructure is a vital catalyst for the local green recovery and NLWA’s efforts to increase recycling rates across North London to 50 percent.\n\nThe new facility will have the capacity to recycle 135,000 tonnes of waste every year, including wood, metals and plastic that would otherwise be sent to landfill. Serving two main functions, half of the building will be used as a Recycling and Fuel Preparation Facility whilst the other half will become a public Reuse and Recycling Centre, which will allow residents and businesses to drop off their recycling and non-recycling waste directly at the EcoPark.\n\nAdjacent to the RRF, a two-storey community hub, known as EcoPark House, will provide visitor, community, welfare and education amenities that aims to raise awareness and educate residents about the circular economy and how to reduce the carbon impact of their waste. Environmental considerations are at the heart of this project, seeing the inclusion of a rainwater collection system and a clean energy system powered by photovoltaic panels and geothermal energy.\n\nOur team are providing structural engineering, building services, civil, infrastructure and environmental services, as well as architectural design through Race Cottam Associates for the RRF and EcoPark House.\n\nOur structural design for the RRF incorporates a 75m clear-span structure forming a column-free space below for the machinery and tipping facilities. The initial design saw trusses at 8m centres, but after a value engineering exercise we rationalised this to include fewer trusses which are spaced at 24m centres. As well as cost and programme benefits, this design enhancement contributed to a carbon reduction of approximately 720 tonnes for the frame."
