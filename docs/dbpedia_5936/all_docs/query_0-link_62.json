        "text": "There are at least 103 new MPs with current or recent experience serving on councils, LGC analysis has found.\n\nAt the general election last week Labour won 412 seats, a gain of 211 since 2019. The Conservatives won 121 seats, a loss of 252, and the Liberal Democrats won 72, a gain of 64.\n\nAhead of the election LGC identified 127 current or former councillors who were standing at the general election. Our analysis was initially based on information gathered when candidates were announced and therefore could be an underestimate of the number.\n\nOn Friday LGC reported that 58 current or recent Labour councillors were elected, including Local Government Association chair Shaun Davies, who has already been replaced in that role by Louise Gittins (Lab). We are now are of an additional three Labour MPs who have been included in the table below.\n\nGeorgia Gould (Lab), chair of London Councils also won her Maida Vale seat.\n\nTwo other members of the London Councils executive committee were also elected: Nesil Caliskan (health and adult care) and Jas Athwal (community safety).\n\nLondon Councils delayed its annual general meeting, where appointments to key positions are made, until after the general election. This will now take place on 17 July.\n\nThe full list of Labour candidates becoming an MP for the first time and with council experience is below.\n\nAccording to the LGA's Liberal Democrat group there are 35 new MPs with council experience.\n\nThere are also four Greens, and two Conservatives entering the Commons having served on a council at some point.\n\nBournemouth, Christchurch and Poole leader Vikki Slade became the Lib Dem MP for Mid Dorset and North Poole.\n\nThis morning Cllr Slade posted on Twitter / X: “Travelling to London for an intense induction including swearing in later this week. A few existing meetings reorganised & thanks to colleagues for deputising during this week.”\n\nIn Newton Abbot the Lib Dem candidate Martin Wrigley, who is leader of Teignbridge DC, took the seat from the Conservatives.\n\nSteve Darling, the former leader of Torbay, becomes the only blind person in the Commons, as the MP for Torbay.\n\nNew Lib Dem MPs with council experience include:\n\nName Constituencey Lee DillonNewburyVikki SladeMid Dorset & North PooleMarie GoldmanChelmsfordCharlotte CaneEly and East CambridgeshireMartin WrigleyNewton AbbotAdam DanceYeovilSarah GibsonChippenhamBobby DeanCarshalton & WallingtonTom MorrisonCheadleLisa SmartHazel GroveSteve DarlingTorbayPaul KohlerWimbledonAndrew GeorgeSt IvesBrian MathewMelksham and DevizesIan RoomeNorth DevonLuke TaylorSutton and CheamLiz JarvisEastleighCalum MillerBicester and WoodstockFreddie van MierloHenley and Thame\n\nAll four new Green MPs have been a councillor at some point.\n\nCo-leader Carla Denyer served as a member of Bristol City Council for nine years, standing down earlier this year to focus on her campaign to become an MP.\n\nIn 2018 she proposed the first climate emergency declaration in Europe, setting a target for Bristol to be carbon neutral by 2030.\n\nAdrian Ramsay, co-leader of the Green party, is the new MP for Waveney Valley in Suffolk. He was a member of Norwich City Council from 2003 to 2011.\n\nSian Berry, who retained Brighton Pavillion for the Greens was a councillor at Camden LBC until October 2023 and a member of the London Assembly until this year.\n\nThe new Green MP for North Herefordshire Ellie Chowns is her party’s group leader on Herefordshire council. Between 2019 and 2023 the council was run by a Green / Independent coalition.\n\nThree new Conservative MPs have council experience. Bradley Thomas who will represent Bromsgrove, was the former Conservative leader of Wychavon DC. Lewis Cocking (Con), is the leader of Broxbourne BC and will represent the area in Parliament.\n\nGreg Stafford, the new Conservative MP for Farnham and Bordon has been an Ealing LBC since 2007.
