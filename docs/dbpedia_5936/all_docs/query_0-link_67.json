        "text": "What does local government do?\n\nLocal government is a devolved matter, meaning that there the local government system varies in many ways between the four nations of the UK.\n\nIn England, Scotland, and Wales, councils are responsible for social care and provide some aspects of transport, housing, and education. They are also in charge of a range of neighbourhood services including libraries and waste collection.\n\nLocal government in Northern Ireland is more limited. Councils provide some neighbourhood services such as waste collection and street cleaning. However, they are not responsible for education, libraries, or social care.\n\nHow are local councillors elected?\n\nIn England, councillors are elected on four-year terms to single or multi-member wards using the first past the post electoral system. Council seats are elected altogether every four years (in 67% of councils); by thirds three years out of every four (31%); or in halves every two years (2%).\n\nIn Scotland, councillors are elected to multi-member wards via single transferable vote, a proportional voting system which allows voters to rank candidates. Councils are normally elected as a whole every four years. In 2015, the Scottish Parliament extended the franchise in local elections to 16- and 17-year-olds.\n\nIn Wales, councillors are elected to single and multi-member wards using first past the post, and councils come up for election as a whole every four years. In 2020, Senedd Cymru (the Welsh parliament) voted to extend the local franchise – as in Scotland – to 16- and 17-year-olds.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, councillors are elected via single transferable vote to multi-member electoral areas. All councillors are elected every four years.\n\nHow is local government funded?\n\nCouncils across the UK are funded by a combination of central government grants and local taxes. The balance between these funding sources varies.\n\nIn England, in 2020/21, 55.7% of funding came from central government grants (adjusted to remove Covid business relief grants), 28.7% from council tax, and 15.6% from business rates revenue (which is collected locally but then redistributed via a nationally-run system).\n\nIn Scotland, 68% of council funding came from the Scottish government’s General Revenue Grant, 14% from business rate revenues, and 19% from council tax. The Scottish parliament has increased council tax for by highly valued households while reducing revenue funding, meaning that Scottish councils are becoming more reliant on local taxation.\n\nIn Wales, there is greater reliance on grants from the Welsh government, which make up 65% of council funding, compared to 22% from council tax and 13% from business rates revenues.\n\nCouncils in Northern Ireland are funded differently. They draw their income from district rates (70%), which are a property tax like council tax, as well as grants from the Northern Ireland executive (8%) and fees for services including building control and waste collection (22%).\n\nSpending on local government has fallen across the UK since the beginning of austerity in 2010, but to a varying extent between the nations. Councils in England cut spending by roughly 21% between 2010/11 and 2018/19 – over 10 percentage points more than in Scotland and Wales. However, spending on local government rose in all nations of the UK in 2020/21 compared with 2019/20 owing to the Covid pandemic. In England, spending rose by 6.2% in real terms between these years.\n\nOriginally published in the Institute for Government’s Devolution at 20 report\n\nWhat is the structure of local government in England?\n\nThere are 333 local authorities in England. The structure of government varies between them. They cover:\n\nTwo-tier areas, where authorities share local government functions. These areas are covered by county councils and district councils. There are 24 county councils, which provide social care and some aspects of transport and education. The counties are sub-divided into 181 district councils, which manage neighbourhood services like waste collection.\n\nSingle-tier areas, where one authority carries out all local government functions. These areas comprise the 32 London boroughs, 36 metropolitan districts (including in areas like Greater Manchester and the West Midlands), and 58 unitary authorities such as Bristol and North East Lincolnshire. The Isles of Scilly is a unitary authority, but some local services are provided in conjunction with Cornwall unitary authority. The City of London has a unique governance structure.\n\nIn April 2023, North Yorkshire, Cumbria and Somerset county councils were restructured into unitary authorities. Somerset and North Yorkshire will form single unitary authorities, while Cumbria will split into two new authorities: Cumberland, and Westmoreland and Furness unitary authorities. Elections for these new authorities took place on 5 May 2022.\n\nMost local authorities in England are run by a leader and cabinet from councillors of the majority party or a coalition of parties in cases of no overall control. Other authorities use a committee system, in which decision-making is delegated to committees of councillors from all parties. Budgetary decisions in these cases must still receive the support of a majority of councillors.\n\nSixteen English local authorities, including those in Bristol, Liverpool, and Watford, have transferred leadership powers to executive mayors. To date, mayors have been elected via the supplementary vote system, which allows voters to choose their first and second-preference candidates. In the future, mayors will be elected using the first-past-the-post system, the same one used to elect Westminster MPs. In May 2022, Bristol residents voted in a referendum to revert back to the committee system to lead the council from 2024. In July 2022, Liverpool City Council voted to abolish the position of directly elected mayor in the city and instead return to the leader and cabinet governance model from May 2023.\n\nThese local mayors are distinct from ‘metro mayors’, who are elected across a number of local council areas and exercise strategic economic and public service functions in partnership with other local leaders, who collectively form a ‘combined authority’ for the region. The most recent metro mayor election was held in South Yorkshire in May 2022.\n\nWhat is the political balance of local government in England?\n\nFollowing the English local elections in May 2022, 78% of councils had one-party majorities while 22% were under no overall control.\n\nThe Conservatives have the most councillors in England (42%), followed by Labour (31%) and the Liberal Democrats (15%)."
