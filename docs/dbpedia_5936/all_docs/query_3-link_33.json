        "text": "*This 2022 event series has now ended. Stay up to date for future events.\n\nThis summer we launched the start of a unique events series across North London exploring Repair, Reuse and Upcycling! Hosted by the North London Waste Authority, These free events will enable local residents of North London to connect with local organisations and businesses who champion repair, reuse and upcycling and help us achieve our shared endeavours to live more sustainably.\n\nThis special events series promises to connect local residents with repair, reuse and upcycling leaders in their community members and encourage the use of their services, products and crafts which improve local waste reduction in a clever, fun and social space. The events kicked off in July in Waltham Forest, followed by Islington, Camden, Haringey, Barnet, Hackney and Enfield.\n\nGroundwork London are working in partnership with North London Waste Authority to deliver these events across 7 boroughs in North London:- Waltham Forest, Haringey, Enfield, Barnet, Camden, Islington and Hackney. These will run between July and November 2022.\n\nAbout the Events Series\n\nThroughout this series, each event will showcase the reuse, repair and upcycling of home furniture and furnishings and workshops and demonstrations will offer a chance to learn new skills and techniques to repair, reuse and upcycle their furnishings – saving money and the environment. The events will work with local stakeholders to help and encourage the ongoing use of reuse, repair and upcycling opportunities in their local area.\n\nTable of Events: Save the Date\n\nHow to Attend\n\nTo join us, attendees simply need to register to their relevant local event via a digital or online link, which will allow entry and the option to join in the workshops on the day. Depending on the workshops and organisations involved, places may be available on a first come first serve basis.\n\nGet Involved\n\nWe were thrilled to be joined by some incredible participants in Waltham Forest and Islington who shared their knowledge, expertise and craft with us.\n\nYou can get to know them here:\n\nIf you are local business, organisation or individual whose service, craft or product champions reuse or upcycling of household goods, furniture, or more, get in touch with Lauren at Groundwork London at Lauren.Lawson@groundwork.org.uk."
