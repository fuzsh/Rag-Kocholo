        "text": "The ninth annual Waste Prevention Exchange, brought to you by North London Waste Authority, will focus on the circular economy and the challenges and opportunities this brings to local authorities.\n\nThe conference will see a number of expert panellists discuss what it takes to establish a circular economy, and why it is important to understand the whole system in which we’re operating. It is this ‘systems thinking’ that allows us to identify the barriers to and opportunities within moving to a more circular economy. At the heart of the circular economy lies the chance to design out waste and pollution, keep products and materials in use, and regenerate natural systems. Currently, this vision is a utopia for local authorities battling with the outputs of the wasteful linear economy, but it could become a reality through a joined up approach across social, economic and environmental initiatives.\n\nThe event will feature a selection of circular economy specialists, waste sector leaders and academics who will present effective strategies and tangible insights, using examples of circularity in practice.\n\nThe Waste Prevention Exchange will take place online on May 18 2023.\n\nRegister free today!"
