        "text": "Structure\n\nThe structure of local government varies from area to area. In most of England, there are 2 tiers – county and district – with responsibility for council services split between them.\n\nLondon, other metropolitan areas and parts of shire England operate under a single tier structure with councils responsible for all services in their area.\n\nIn total there are 317 local authorities in England made up of 5 different types:\n\ncounty councils\n\ndistrict councils\n\nunitary authorities\n\nmetropolitan districts\n\nLondon boroughs\n\nThe table below shows the number of each type of council.\n\n2 tier County councils 21 District councils 164 Single tier Unitary authorities 62 Metropolitan districts 36 London boroughs 32 City of London 1 Isles of Scilly 1 Total 317\n\nSome shire district councils (including unitary authorities) and all metropolitan district councils have the status of either a borough or a city and are referred to as borough or city councils.\n\nCouncil map\n\nUnitary authorities\n\nThere are 62 unitary authorities. They provide all local government services in their areas. These are mainly in the cities, urban areas and larger towns although there are now 6 shire county councils that are unitary (ie have no district councils beneath them).\n\nLondon boroughs\n\nThere are 32 London boroughs. They provide nearly all the services in their area. However, the Greater London Authority (GLA) provides London-wide government, including special responsibility for police, fire, strategic planning and transport.\n\nMetropolitan districts\n\nThere are 36 metropolitan district councils which together cover 6 large urban areas: the counties of Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, West Midlands, and West Yorkshire.\n\nMetropolitan districts are responsible for all services in their area, although certain conurbation wide services such as fire and civil defence, police, waste disposal and passenger transport are provided through joint authorities (the districts acting jointly).\n\nCounty councils\n\nThere are 21 county councils in 2-tier areas, providing services such as education, social services and waste disposal.\n\nDistrict councils\n\nIn 2-tier areas, each county council area is subdivided into districts, for which there is an independent district council. There are 164 district councils.\n\nDistrict councils are responsible for local services such as rubbish collection, housing and planning applications.\n\nCity of London\n\nThe City of London Corporation provides local government and other services for the ‘Square Mile’. These include economic development, education, environmental health, highways management, housing, libraries, the Barbican Arts Centre, policing, social services, waste collection and town planning.\n\nIsles of Scilly\n\nThe Council of the Isles of Scilly is a unitary authority, but with some local government services being provided in conjunction with Cornwall Council. It also has its own water authority, airport authority and other powers, including running its own Sea Fisheries Committee.\n\nTown and parish councils\n\nThere are also approximately 9,000 town or parish councils in England. These operate at a level below district councils and unitary authorities.\n\nBecause of their great diversity, parishes do not generally have statutory functions, although they are often responsible for smaller local services such as allotments, parks and community centres. They may provide other services with the agreement of the county or district council.\n\nFor further information on town and parish councils see the National Association of Local Councils website.\n\nSee details on how to set up a town or parish council.\n\nCombined authorities\n\nA combined authority can be set up by two or more local authorities. The government devolves various powers and funding to an area so councils can work together to make collective decisions. A combined authority does not replace the existing local authorities.\n\nThere are 11 combined authorities:\n\nCambridgeshire and Peterborough\n\nEast Midlands Combined County\n\nGreater Manchester\n\nLiverpool City Region\n\nNorth East\n\nSouth Yorkshire\n\nTees Valley\n\nWest Midlands\n\nWest of England\n\nWest Yorkshire\n\nYork North Yorkshire\n\nGovernance arrangements\n\nThe Local Government Act 2000 sets out the governance models that must be operated by local authorities. These are:\n\na mayor and cabinet executive\n\na leader and cabinet executive\n\nthe committee system\n\nor other arrangements approved by the Secretary of State\n\nLocal people can have a say on the governance model adopted by their local authority via a referendum in certain circumstances.\n\nNumber of councillors\n\nThe number of councillors for each local authority is decided by the independent Local Government Boundary Commission for England.\n\nIt is responsible for electoral arrangements (the reviewing and implementing of the number and boundaries of electoral areas and the number of councillors) in local authorities in England.\n\nThe Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government has no role.\n\nFor more information visit the Local Government Boundary Commission website.\n\nLocal councils and elections\n\nMembers of councils - councillors - are elected for 4-year terms using the first past the post system.\n\nWhen elections are held\n\nElections to councils are held on the first Thursday in May.\n\nElectoral cycles\n\nThere are a variety of electoral cycles (times when elections are held) so not all councillors are elected at the same time.\n\nThe 3 methods of holding elections to local councils are:\n\nby whole council (all of the councillors are elected every 4 years)\n\nby halves (half of the councillors are elected every 2 years)\n\nby thirds (a third of the councillors are elected every year for 3 years, with no elections in the 4th year)\n\nElectoral areas\n\nIn county councils (including single tier county councils) councillors represent electoral areas called divisions.\n\nIn other types of council these areas are called wards.\n\nAn electoral area (ward or division) may be represented by 1, 2 or 3 councillors.\n\nIn county councils there is usually 1 councillor for each electoral area.\n\nMetropolitan districts elect 3 councillors and wards in shire district, unitary authorities and London boroughs elect between 1 and 3 councillors.\n\nExamples\n\nWhere a district council holds whole-council elections all councillors are elected at the same time. For example electors in a 2-member ward cast 2 votes each and elect 2 councillors at the same time.\n\nWhere a district council holds elections by thirds, a third of the councillors for the whole council will be elected at each annual election. Electors in a 3-member ward will vote in each of the elections, electors in a 2-member ward will vote in 2 out of 3 and electors in a single-member ward will vote in 1 of the 3 elections."
