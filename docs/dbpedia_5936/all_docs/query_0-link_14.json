        "text": "So pleased that our pioneering work to improve flood and climate resilience on our residential streets in London Borough of Waltham Forest has been recognised at the annual SuDS (Sustainable Urban Drainage Scheme) Awards. Waltham Forest won in the ‘Catchment Based SuDS Solutions’ with the scheme for Esther Road and the roads in E17 that were particular hit by the July ‘21 floods, as well as the scheme on Chestnut Field and elsewhere. And we got ‘Highly Commended’ for our ‘Lower Floods’ Water Butt giveaway scheme in the ‘Community SuDS’ category. This scheme has now seen a 1000 Water Butts given away for free, to residents, in high risk flood areas, holding back at least 135,000+ litres of water from our ‘challenged’ and antiquated drainage system, from the deluges the likes of which bought so much damage and distress to so many of our neighbours in July ‘21. Look out for further schemes to come, during 24/25 that also offer brillant opportunities to plant more plants, bushes and trees that help improve our biodiversity offer and cool our planet.

An MBE at the start of the week and then rounding it off with some quality MJ Awards (the Oscars of the local governmnet world) action! London Borough of Waltham Forest got a ‘Highly Commended’ in the ‘Decarbonising Transport’ category- topping a very impressive short list that included a number of London boroughs, for our ‘10 Years of Enjoy’. So proud of Jane Sherry Daniel Gosbee Amy Conway Gemma Hearsum Christopher Proctor Emdad Ahmed Vala Valavan etc and the cast of thousands who have been part of that journey over the 10 years! And then the Team North London Waste Authority won the the ‘Innovation in Delivering Sustainability & Social Value’ at yesterdays MJ Awards, for our pioneering work on the North London Heat and Power Project. So chuffed for them! Since the outset of this project way, way back now we have invested and pushed for #socialvalue and #sustainabilty outcomes to be at the fore of this national infrastructure project. And it certainly has been with huge numbers of jobs, training, apprenticeships and work experience placements already created with more to come. Over 30 community projects supported and local procurement opportunities firmly embedded. On top of that a great range of UK leading #sustainability initatives and firsts! A huge thank you to all those past and present for helping to deliver incl.- Martin Capstick Trudi Vause Joe Sheeran Nikesh Shah (CMath CPFA) @Rowena Champion Diarmaid Ward Mike Hakata Cllr Mete Coban MBE Paul Douglas Rob Chapman Adam Harrison Richard Olszewski Feryal Clark Jon Burke MIEMA CEnv Satnam Gill Linzi Roberts-Egan Debbie Porter shazia Hussain Eddie Townsend Rob Manning Local Government Association\n\nSo it’s been a week since we celebrated the 10 Year Anniversary of London Borough of Waltham Forest #MiniHolland. It was lovely to join with so many who have been part of our phenomenal 10 year journey, whether from a technical, political and leadership or a community activist background and celebrate the successes that we have achieved together over that 10 years. It was lovely to reflect on the past and contemplate what the next 10 years might look like, in such esteemed and supportive company. Read our 10 Year report here- https://lnkd.in/efCPsBqy Our 10 year programme of delivery, whilst starting up as a transport/ highway scheme, has become so much more. Yes it’s unlocked and enabled more people from ‘8- 80’ to walk and cycle, more often their local journeys, but what else? Our work has been a major component in our work to arrest climate change. It’s been a beacon project for creating more space for planting and biodiversity- “We can hear the birds sing”- and supporting our need to improve the climate resilience of our roads and residential neighbourhoods, with the introduction of Raingardens and other SUDS initiatives. We’ve seen improvements in air quality and the local economies of Orford Rd, Francis Rd and other local shopping destinations have thrived as they have become ‘destinations’. LTNs have become enablers of enhanced community cohesion and wellbeing, creating the landscape for more neighbours to ‘talk’, through reducing the ‘noise’ and the divide of rat running motor vehicles being removed. Our work has contributed to a reduction in those killed and injured on our streets by motor vehicles. And in public health terms this work has probably been one of the most significant interventions-aside from the COVID Vaccine roll out- in recent decades to help improve the health and wellbeing-physical and mental- of our residents. Whilst we have achieved so much with our introduction of LTNs, seperate cycle track and supportive complementary measures- cycle training, parking etc- influencing initiatives and policies across London, the UK and even further afield during that time, it’s been hugely disappointing to hear and witness the recent ill- informed contributions from Government Ministers and MPs, including the Prime Minister and his SoS for Transport and their ‘Plan for Motorists’ [sic], that have created a ‘Culture War’ against the needs of our most vulnerable of road users- pedestrians and cyclists. As we look to the future let’s just hope common sense will prevail, but be rest assured we’ll continue delivering schemes that we know are popular and are delivering better outcomes for our residents now and in the future! Thank you for your support in helping us get to where we are now and for where we want to go.\n\nDisposable Vapes Update- Wowzer we did it! Some really good news- single use #disposablevapes are set to be banned! These products aren’t required, are environmentally unsustainable and have been designed, marketed and targeted at our young people undermining their health and well being. Five million of them are currently thrown away in the UK each week, up from 1.3 million in 2022. Over a year, the lithium batteries inside could instead power 5,000 electric vehicles! Really proud North London Waste Authority Officers & Cllrs decided that this was a campaign worth fighting and grateful to all the work that was put into the consultation response template and sharing far and wide across our political Local Government Association London Councils London Borough of Waltham Forest, environmental and health networks and of course getting the word out to our local residents networks. Special thanks to Pete Robbins Hannah Lazell Martin Angus MBE for helping spread the word beyond Cllrs in London. Whether you completed the consultation and used the NLWA template to do so or not, whether your focus was environmental or health grounds- this is a really positive outcome for our planet and our younger residents! Thank you for being interested and thank you for contributing. Thank you!
