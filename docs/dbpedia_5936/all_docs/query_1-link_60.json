        "text": "What was the result of the 2024 Greater Manchester mayoral election?\n\nAndy Burnham was the winner of the May 2024 Greater Manchester mayoral election. He represents the Labour Party and was previously elected to the post in May 2017 and May 2021. Burnham was formerly MP for Leigh and a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown.\n\nBurnham’s highest share of the vote was 72% in Manchester, and his lowest was 49% in Oldham.\n\nThe turnout across the region was 32%, lower than the 2021 election where turnout was 35%.\n\nThe Conservative party candidate was Laura Evans, a former councillor who previously stood for the party in the 2021 mayoral election. Laura Evans was selected as the candidate after the previous candidate, Dan Barker, defected to Reform UK in March 2024. Barker will represent the latter party in the election.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats had Jake Austin, a Stockport Councillor, as their candidate. Hannah Spencer, a Trafford Councillor was the Green Party Candidate. Nick Buckley, who stood as the candidate for Reform UK in the 2021 mayoral election stood as an independent candidate.\n\nWhat are the powers of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority?\n\nThe mayor of Greater Manchester and GMCA exercise powers including over transport, skills, employment support, planning and regeneration, policing and fire services. GMCA also holds responsibilities not devolved elsewhere such as a role – in partnership with UK government departments – in health and social care commissioning and justice policy.\n\nTransport is a key devolved responsibility. GMCA controls a local transport budget and a range of associated transport powers, including over the road and active travel networks. In autumn 2024, GMCA was the first combined authority to take control of the local bus system via a franchising scheme, and already controls the local tram system. GMCA is progressing plans for smart ticketing, as part of a wider vision to create a ‘London style’ transport system, which will eventually also include local rail services.\n\nGMCA is also responsible for the 19+ adult education budget, enabling it to develop a skills strategy that fits the needs of the local labour market. Like the Greater London Authority, but unlike other mayoral combined authorities, it is responsible for commissioning employment support for long-term unemployed and disabled workers.\n\nOn housing and planning, the mayor can undertake compulsory purchase orders, with the consent of the local authority in which the site to be purchased is situated. The mayor can also develop a statutory spatial development strategy with the unanimous agreement of all constituent councils. After Stockport council vetoed the proposed spatial plan, the other nine districts have worked together to develop their own joint plan.\n\nThe mayor of Greater Manchester has taken on the functions of the police and crime commissioner for the region, along with responsibility for the fire and rescue service.\n\nGMCA has partial control of a £6 billion health and social care budget, exercised via a partnership with the NHS, and has a co-commissioning role over local offender management systems.\n\nGreater Manchester agreed a ‘trailblazer’ devolution deal with the government in March 2023, as did the West Midlands. Once implemented, this deal will give GMCA further powers over post-19 skills, housing and regeneration, transport, and net zero.\n\nThe deal will also reform GMCA’s funding model to treat it more like a government department, giving GMCA more autonomy. Several funding streams will be consolidated into a single, non-ringfenced, settlement for each spending review period. In exchange, GMCA and the government will agree a “streamlined, overarching single accountability process” with specific outcomes for GMCA to achieve over each spending review period.\n\nInstitute for Government analysis indicates that GMCA’s single settlement would have been £734m if it were in place for the 2022/23 financial year.\n\nWhat is Greater Manchester Combined Authority’s budget?\n\nIn February 2024, GMCA agreed a balanced budget of £2.6bn for the 2024/25 financial year split between £0.72bn capital expenditure and a £1.92bn revenue, for day-to-day spending.\n\nA total of £343m (50%) of the planned capital budget is allocated to economic development and regeneration. Transport capital investments (£303m) accounts for most of the rest of the planned capital spending.\n\nThe largest source of capital funding is grant funding, including the Housing Investment Fund, which alone accounts for £210m (31%) of planned capital spending in 2024/25. Borrowing by the combined authority and capital receipts will also contribute a substantial amount of capital funding.\n\nAs for the revenue budget, £1.1bn (56%) of planned expenditure relates to policing responsibilities and £409m relates to transport. £131m has been allocated to education, work and skills. Important sources of income include central government grants, such as a £97m adult education budget, a £49m bus service improvement grant and £43m from the UK Shared Prosperity Fund.\n\nSome revenue also comes from local taxes. The mayor has the power to set a council tax precept to provide additional discretionary spending power. For 2024/25, this precept has been set at £112.95 per year for a Band D property. There is a separate police precept, as in other parts of England, while some business rates revenue is also retained locally.\n\nOverall, GMCA raises around 3% its revenue directly via the mayoral precept. Its constituent members also pay a transport levy and a waste levy, which account for another 15%."
