        "text": "We now have an exciting opportunity for a talented and enthusiastic individual to join us and be part of a team developing a new vision for North London Waste Authority (NLWA).\n\nYou will assist with the design and implementation of waste prevention and recycling projects in line with the programme of activity outlined in the North London Waste Prevention Plan 2018-20. You will work in partnership with the seven constituent boroughs and other stakeholders in order to identify service needs, propose and design new projects. A significant aspect of the role is the planning and delivery of projects, public engagement, review progress and liaising with stakeholders.\n\nEmployed by Camden on behalf of NLWA, this role offers you the opportunity to be at the forefront of new developments in waste management.\n\nAbout you\n\nIt is also essential that you hold a current clean driving licence and have knowledge of the practices relating to waste minimisation, reuse and recycling. You will also have a good understanding of project management.\n\nThe knowhow and confidence to provide quality advice and awareness-raising to staff and community groups including at public meetings is essential. This will also include the ability to communicate effectively, both in person and in writing and express and present information accurately, clearly and concisely both orally and in writing. You will be capable of composing drafts of routine minutes, letters and briefing notes.\n\nYou will have strong analytical and organisational skills – the ability to manage conflicting priorities, handle a busy workload and meet frequently changing deadlines is key to the role.\n\nKnowledge of the workings of central, regional and local government and the relationships between the tiers and a holder of a relevant degree or equivalent qualification are desirable but not essential.\n\nAbout Camden\n\nThe North London Waste Authority (NLWA) is the statutory waste disposal authority for seven north London boroughs (Barnet, Camden, Enfield, Hackney, Haringey, Islington and Waltham Forest). NLWA is responsible for managing the disposal of almost 850,000 tonnes of waste every year across seven north London Boroughs.\n\nReducing waste, improving recycling and making the best use of rubbish we can’t reuse is our challenge for the future. We currently produce enough electricity for 72,000 homes from the rubbish we can’t reuse but we are also looking at replacing our existing plant with a new energy-from-waste facility and diverting some of the energy to warm local homes and businesses via heat networks in the future. At the same time we are working towards our aim of achieving a 50% recycling rate by 2020, while also significantly reducing the amount of waste sent to landfill.\n\nAlthough based in Haringey, the post holder will be employed by London Borough of Camden from whom you can expect an exceptional range of benefits recognising and rewarding high performance with progression and pay increases, flexible and agile working hours and benefiting from a leading pension scheme.\n\nCamden is proud to be the country’s first Timewise council and as part of this accreditation, we work to help parents balance work with childcare. This fits in with our aim to be leaders in innovative flexible and part-time working that allows for different patterns of care and for parents to share childcare responsibilities.\n\nMake it work for you. Make it your Camden."
