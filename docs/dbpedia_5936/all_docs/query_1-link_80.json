        "text": "Westminster City Council and Veolia have won the ‘Service Change at Local Authority Level’ Award for the borough-wide Food Waste rollout at this year’s Awards for Excellence. This award comes at the end of a year-long effort to roll out food waste recycling services to every neighbourhood in the City.\n\nSo far over 60,000 properties have received the permanent recycling service that began rollout in February 2022 and finally concluded in April 2023. Since this service was rolled out, just one year ago, over 1,300 tonnes of food waste has been collected and the recycling rate has increased 4% in all wards where the service has already been implemented.\n\nCouncillor Paul Dimoldenberg, Cabinet Member for City Management at Westminster City Council, said:\n\n“About a third of all waste we throw away is food waste, so I’m really proud of the work we’ve done with Veolia to roll out food waste recycling across the whole of Westminster over the last year. The results speak for themselves; more than 1,300 tonnes of waste collected and an increase in recycling across all wards in the city. This award is a fantastic result for the team and represents all the hard work they do to make Westminster a greener place to live.”"
