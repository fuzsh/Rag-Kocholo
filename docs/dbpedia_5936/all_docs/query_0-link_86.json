        "text": "June 18, 2024\n\nReform UK has promised in its 2024 election manifesto to scrap net-zero, freeze non-essential immigration, slash “wasteful” government spending and implement a major reform of the NHS.\n\nHarry Rodd outlines some of the key policy promises made in the manifesto, which Reform describes as a “contract”, that would affect local authorities:\n\nSocial care:\n\nCommence Royal Commission of Inquiry into social care system – “A national plan is critical for a sustainable social care system. The sector needs flexibility, tax incentives, VAT breaks and less waste. Simplify social care through a single funding stream, instead of the split between NHS and Local Authorities. More funding will be needed when a national plan is agreed. ”\n\nMigration:\n\nFreeze non-essential immigration – “Strict limits on immigration are the only way to relieve the pressure on our housing, public services, increase wages and protect our culture, identity and values.”\n\nCreate new Department of Immigration.\n\nStop ‘health tourism’ and \"immediate access to benefits\" - “We will impose a requirement of 5 years residency and employment to claim any benefits in the UK.\"\n\nEducation:\n\nBan \"transgender ideology\" in primary and secondary schools – \"No gender questioning, social transitioning or pronoun swapping. Inform parents of under 16s about their children’s life decisions. Schools must have single sex facilities.”\n\nTax relief of 20% on all independent education – “No VAT on fees. This will significantly ease pressure on state schools and improve education for all.”\n\nScrap interest on student loans – “Extend loan capital repayment periods to 45 years. Restrict undergraduate numbers well below current levels, too many courses are not good enough and students are being ripped off. Enforce minimum entry standards.”\n\nPlanning:\n\nReform the planning system – “Fast-track new housing on brownfield sites and infrastructure projects to boost businesses, especially in coastal regeneration areas, Wales, the North, and the Midlands.”\n\nTransport:\n\nScrap HS2 – “Save £25 billion by scrapping the rest of this project.”\n\nLegislate to ban ULEZ Clean Air Zones and Low Traffic Neighbourhoods – “Scrapping Net Zero means no more bans on petrol and diesel cars and no legal requirements for manufacturers to sell electric cars.”\n\nAccelerate transport infrastructure – “Focus on our coastal regions, Wales, the North, and the Midlands. Improve existing rail and road links. Integrated services are critical.”\n\nHousing:\n\nCut residential stamp duty – “Substantially boost economic activity and housebuilding by cutting Stamp Duty to 0% below £750k. Cut it to 2% from £750k - £1.5m and cut it to 4% over £1.5m.”\n\nReform social housing law – “Prioritise local people and those who have paid into the system. Foreign nationals must go to the back of the queue. Not the front.”\n\nScrap section 24 for landlords – “The tax system should encourage smaller landlords into the rental markets. Not penalise them. We will restore landlords’ rights to deduct finance costs and mortgage interest from tax on rental income.”\n\nAbolish the Renters’ (Reform) Bill – “Existing legislation was inadequate to address bad practices. Instead, we will boost the monitoring, appeals and enforcement process for renters with grievances.”\n\nGovernance:\n\nCut ‘unnecessary’ EU regulations – “Britain still retains over 6,700 EU laws. Government red tape and nanny state regulations are estimated to have cost the UK economy £143 billion since 2015. That means £ billions lost in growth and taxes.”\n\nLeave the European Convention on Human Rights – “Commence reform of the Human Rights Act so that it puts the rights of law-abiding people first.”\n\nCommence reform of the House of Lords & Civil Service – “Replace the crony-filled House of Lords with a much smaller, more democratic second chamber. Structure to be debated. Immediate end of political appointees. Replace Civil Service leaders with successful professionals from the private sector, who are political appointees, who come and go with the government.”\n\nCommence reform of the postal voting system – “Postal voting has allowed electoral fraud. We will stop postal voting except for the elderly, disabled or those who can’t leave their homes.”\n\nReplace the 2010 Equalities Act [sic] – “The Equalities Act requires discrimination in the name of ‘positive action’. We will scrap Diversity, Equality and Inclusion (DE&I) rules that have lowered standards and reduced economic productivity.”\n\nPropose a comprehensive Free Speech Bill – “Legislate to stop left-wing bias and politically correct ideology that threatens personal freedom and democracy. No more de-banking, cancel culture, left wing hate mobs or political bias in public institutions. Stop Sharia law being used in the UK.”\n\nEnvironmental:\n\nScrap Net Zero and Related Subsidies – “Ditching Net Zero could save the public sector over £30 billion per year for the next 25 years.”\n\nScrap environmental levies.\n\nHealthcare:\n\nUse independent healthcare capacity – “We will harness independent and not-for-profit health provision in the UK and overseas.”\n\nTax relief of 20% on all private healthcare and insurance – “This will improve care for all by relieving pressure on the NHS. Those who rely on the NHS will enjoy faster, better care. Independent healthcare capacity will grow rapidly, providing competition and reducing costs.”\n\nExcess deaths and vaccine harms public inquiry – “Excess deaths are nearly as high as they were during the Covid pandemic. Young people are over-represented.”"
