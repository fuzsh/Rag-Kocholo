Just follow the link below and register as an affiliated supporter of the Labour Party, this is free for anybody who pays the GMB political levy.\n\nDo this as soon as possible but no later than 5.00pm on 3rd February January 2020.\n\nThis election is crucial for the direction of the Labour Party over the next five years as they look to hold the Tory government to account as an effective opposition both in Parliament and the country and in seeking to reconnect with the voters they lost at the General Election in December.\n\nHave your say and register now.\n\nLabour Leadership Election 2020"
