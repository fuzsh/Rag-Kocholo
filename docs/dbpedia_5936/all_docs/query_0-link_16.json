        "text": "Labour has won three councils from the Conservatives in London, taking control of the borough of Westminster for the first time.\n\nThe borough in which 10 Downing Street sits had been run by the Tories since its creation in 1964.\n\nLabour also won Wandsworth, which had been Tory-held for decades, and Barnet, but in a surprise result lost Harrow to the Conservatives.\n\nThe outgoing leader of Wandsworth said Boris Johnson had lost his party votes.\n\nRavi Govindia admitted people in the south-west London borough raised the prime minister's leadership during the campaign.\n\n\"Inevitably, other events have clouded the judgement of people in Wandsworth,\" he said.\n\nMr Govindia added he had run the \"most successful council\" with council tax cut and rent frozen.\n\n\"We have done exactly what the residents of Wandsworth wanted,\" he said.\n\n\"To find that counts for nothing is a sad reflection of the importance of local government not being recognised.\"\n\nA Labour Party source described Wandsworth as the \"Tories' jewel in the crown\".\n\nThe borough's incoming leader Simon Hogg promised to \"build a compassionate council that truly listens and [to] keep that same low council tax\".\n\nHe said: \"When we were calling around on voters we didn't even have to raise Partygate, we didn't have to mention Boris Johnson.\n\n\"People have formed their own views on this government, so I am afraid it is time for change at the top as well.\"\n\nBarnet Council in north London, which had been taken by the Conservatives in all but two elections since 1964, was Labour's other big win in the capital.\n\nBarnet Conservative leader Daniel Thomas said: \"I think this is a warning shot from Conservative supporters\", adding that he believed \"a fair number of Conservative voters... just didn't go out to vote\".\n\n\"Clearly, if Labour are to get a majority in Parliament they need to win Barnet. They won the council; if they win our parliamentary constituencies as well, then it doesn't bode well for us to form a government in future general elections.\"\n\nJonathan Carr-West, chief executive of the Local Government Information Unit, said Labour's wins had \"huge symbolic value\".\n\n\"Losing all three of these councils in a single election will be a big blow to Conservative morale,\" he said.\n\n\"At the same time, it's part of a longer-term trend in which Labour has tightened its grip on inner London.\"\n\nBy BBC London's political editor Tim Donovan\n\nIn 1990 Conservative success in Wandsworth and Westminster enabled then party chairman Kenneth Baker to spin disastrous results overall into a kind of victory.\n\nNow we've seen the inverse of that.\n\nWhile there may be some reasons for Boris Johnson to be cheerful in parts of the North and the Midlands, it will be eclipsed by the loss of these totemic London councils.\n\nIt is a dangerous political moment for him.\n\nMayor of London Sadiq Khan listed every one of the previous Tory leaders who managed to hang on to them - even in bleak times.\n\nHe has more reason than most to understand the Labour agony it's entailed. As a local councillor, Mr Khan fought - and failed - to dislodge the Tories from Wandsworth over more than a decade.\n\nTory candidates departed the count ashen-faced, declining to comment leaving their outgoing leader to front up."
