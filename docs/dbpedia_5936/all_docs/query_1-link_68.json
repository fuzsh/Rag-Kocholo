        "text": "Labour has drafted its most comprehensive policy programme yet for a Keir Starmer government, drawing up a provisional but wide-ranging blueprint likely to shape the next general election manifesto.\n\nThe 86-page policy handbook, seen by LabourList and summarised below, builds on submissions from Labour groups and beyond, six NPF policy documents consulted on earlier this year, past consultations and pledges announced by the shadow cabinet in recent years.\n\nWhile there are few new proposals, it shows the policies included are now one step closer to making it into Labour’s final offer to voters.\n\nHow draft policies will shape the 2024 Labour manifesto\n\nThe document will “inform Labour’s policy proposals ahead of the next general election”, and the six areas will “support the delivery of Keir Starmer’s five national missions”. There are a further three key hurdles before such policies reach the manifesto, however, with the document described as an “initial draft – subject to amendment”.\n\nPolicies will first be “debated, amended and agreed” by those involved in the NPF, with NPF members able to file amendments until June and a key meeting in late July. These are then “subject to approval” at Labour’s annual conference, to decide the “party programme”. Then ahead of an election, representatives will hold a further “Clause V meeting” to decide which parts of the programme reach the manifesto.\n\nThe document says the policy platform draws on the “vast experience from across the labour movement and beyond”, from local parties, trade unions and socialist societies to “many businesses, charities and civil society groups”.\n\nClick to jump to the report’s six sections: a green and digital future, better jobs and better work, safe and secure communities, public services that work from the start, a future where families come first, and Britain in the world.\n\n1.
