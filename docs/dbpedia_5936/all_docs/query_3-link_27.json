        "text": "North London Waste Authority’s community fund is giving out £250,000 to 14 local environmental projects across seven North London boroughs\n\nFourteen community groups from across North London will receive a share of £250,000 towards their efforts to reduce waste.\n\nThe money is being dished out by North London Waste Authority (NLWA) as part of its North London Community Fund which supports local environmental projects across Waltham Forest, Enfield, Barnet, Haringey, Camden, Islington and Hackney.\n\nThe projects chosen this year have been allocated small awards of up to £5,000 and medium awards of up to £15,000 each. They encompass a range of waste reduction strategies including repair, upcycling and textiles, sustainability, food waste, and recycling and reuse education.\n\nExamples include a resident-led household and gardening tool lending library, supporting the establishment of a repair club which builds on the legacy of one of last year’s funded projects, and a youth education programme focused on waste prevention and environmental protection.\n\nFor the first time, NLWA has split the fund into two stages. The first stage, now complete, will distribute £150,000 among the 14 community groups. The second stage is set to follow shortly, with two additional organisations to be awarded a share of the remaining £100,000 for projects spanning over two years.\n\nNLWA established its flagship waste prevention initiative to “enhance the efforts of local groups addressing waste-related challenges at the grassroots level”.\n\nThe North London Community Fund supports not-for-profit community organisations by providing financial assistance and enables them to enact change on the ground. Since the fund launched in 2017, it has enabled 59 projects to reach thousands of residents across north London and beyond.\n\nClyde Loakes, NLWA chair and also deputy leader of Waltham Forest Council, said: “We’ve been really impressed with the outcomes of projects this year, which have delivered fantastic community benefits too. For example, the groups we’ve supported this year have set up nine composting hubs and repaired and reused hundreds of electronic devices.\n\n“One project even gave two residents the skills to move into employment. We’ve also built connections between organisations to allow activities to continue beyond our funding and provide fantastic legacy outcomes.\n\n“Our members unanimously agreed to safeguard the funding for this pivotal initiative, affirming our belief in the power of grassroots efforts and acknowledging the vital role these initiatives play in creating a sustainable and resilient community.\n\n“Working collaboratively with these fantastic projects also enables us to gain a deeper understanding of the waste challenges in our seven boroughs and beyond. I’m looking forward to seeing the positive outcomes of the latest round of initiatives and welcome their significant contribution in supporting the circular economy and creating a more environmentally conscious North London.”\n\nList of North London Community Fund recipients for the first round:\n\nAbbey Community Centre: Community craft workshops using waste items – Camden\n\nAge UK Enfield: Waste wood workshops to upskill local residents – Enfield\n\nArachne Greek Cypriot Women’s Group: Sustainable textiles course focused on upcycling clothing and sustainable fashion – Islington\n\nBread n Butter CIC: Community cookery workshops focused on food waste prevention – Barnet, Enfield and Haringey\n\nClapton Common Boys Club: Youth education programme focused on waste prevention and environmental protection – Hackney and Haringey\n\nCommunity Focus Inclusive Arts: Providing tools for upcycling second-hand clothing – Barnet\n\nForest Recycling Project Ltd: Resident lead household and gardening tool lending library – Waltham Forest\n\nKilburn Repair Club: Supporting the establishment of a repair club – Camden\n\nLifeafterhummus: Development of community kitchen and food waste prevention workshops – Camden\n\nLondon CC CIC: Bike renovation and donation scheme and bike repair workshops – Enfield and Haringey\n\nMarkets N22 CIC: Establishing a repair café – Haringey\n\nOur Home Our Planet CIC: Sustainability fairs and behaviour change workshops – Barnet\n\nSt Andrew’s Church, Thornhill Square: Providing equipment to support clothing exchange – Islington\n\nThe Mill: Extending reach of repair cafés and clubs – Waltham Forest\n\nNo news is bad news\n\nIndependent news outlets like ours – reporting for the community without rich backers – are under threat of closure, turning British towns into news deserts.\n\nThe audiences they serve know less, understand less, and can do less.\n\nIf our coverage has helped you understand our community a little bit better, please consider supporting us with a monthly, or one-off donation.\n\nChoose the news.
