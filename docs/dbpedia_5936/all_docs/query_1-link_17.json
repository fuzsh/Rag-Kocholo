        "text": "There’s a general election on Thursday 4 July. But who should you vote for?\n\nTo help you cut through the political spin, we’ve teamed up with Friends of the Earth to comb through the parties’ manifestos and reveal who’s really standing up for the future of our planet.\n\nEveryone has to make their own choice about how to vote. But if climate and nature is a priority for you, we hope you find it helpful.\n\nWho should I vote for?\n\nIt depends on where you live, and what matters most to you.\n\nThe way the UK’s voting system works means that in many places, only two parties stand a chance of winning.\n\nSo if it is a tight race between the two leading parties in your area, you might want to vote for the one that scores highest and can win (even if you don’t find them very inspiring). This is called tactical voting.\n\nFor example, many seats will be a close contest between Labour and the Conservatives. And despite their shortcomings, we scored Labour four times higher and found a big difference between the two parties’ plans.\n\nLearn more about tactical voting.\n\nEqually, you might prefer to vote for the party that best reflects your views, so as to register your support for them in the final vote share. It’s your vote and your choice!\n\nConservatives\n\nIs Rishi Sunak’s Conservative Party good for climate and nature? After more than a decade in power, their approach to the issue has shifted over time. Here are the Conservatives’ strengths and weaknesses on green issues.\n\nGreen Party\n\nThe environment is their signature issue, but is the Green Party of England and Wales really green? Here are the best and worst bits of their green offering to voters.\n\nLabour Party\n\nDoes the Labour Party under Keir Starmer have good green policies? Here are their strengths and weaknesses on climate and nature.\n\nLiberal Democrats\n\nHow strong are the Lib Dems’ green policies? Here are their strengths and weaknesses on climate and nature.\n\nScottish National Party\n\nWe didn’t score the SNP because many of the overall scoring criteria apply UK-wide, and it wouldn’t be fair to judge a Scotland-specific party by this standard. However, their manifesto is still full of important policy commitments to try to win your vote. So we’ve taken a look and analysed their offer for you.\n\nPlaid Cymru\n\nWe didn’t score Plaid Cymru because many of the overall scoring criteria apply UK-wide, and it wouldn’t be fair to judge a Wales-specific party by this standard. However, their manifesto is still full of important policy commitments to try to win your vote. So we’ve taken a look and analysed their offer for you.\n\nShould I vote tactically?\n\nThis election is the best shot we have at electing a government that’s up to the job of tackling the climate and nature crisis.\n\nThe way the UK’s voting system works means that in many places, only two parties stand a chance of winning. Because of this, voting for the highest-scoring party overall won’t necessarily deliver any extra seats for that party.\n\nSo if your area is a close race between the two leading parties, you might want to vote for the party that scores highest and can win in your area (even if you don’t find them very inspiring). This is called tactical voting.\n\nOr you might prefer to vote for the highest-scoring party regardless, to show your support for them in the final vote share – it’s your vote, and your choice!\n\nHow it works\n\nIf you do want to vote tactically, you can use the Electoral Calculus site to see which parties have the best chance of winning in your area.\n\nHere’s an example from Suffolk Central and Ipswich North.\n\nIn a seat like this, voting tactically would mean voting Labour, because other, higher-scoring parties are extremely unlikely to win here.\n\nHere’s another example, from Wells and Mendip Hills.\n\nIn a seat like this, voting tactically would mean voting for the Lib Dems because the Lib Dems’ positions are much stronger than the Conservatives’ on these issues.\n\nAnd here’s one final example from South Shields.\n\nIn a seat like this, the polls suggest that only one party can win, so there’s no opportunity to make a difference with tactical voting. Follow your heart!\n\nUnderstand your local election race\n\nNow it’s your turn. Enter your postcode on the Electoral Calculus site to see the prediction for your constituency – then make your choice!"
