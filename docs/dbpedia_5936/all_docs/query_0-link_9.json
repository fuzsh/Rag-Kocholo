The report recommends reforming the Apprenticeship Levy and s106 policies to match the demand for skilled workers.” “Chairman of the City of London Corporation Planning and Transport Committee, Shravan Joshi, said: “The built environment is critical in supporting central London’s transition to a more sustainable economy.” ““Buildings have substantial carbon footprints, so reducing emissions in the sector will be pivotal for addressing climate change. Ensuring technical education, such as through apprenticeships, offers a range of flexible training routes towards new jobs, which will be essential to delivering on sustainability ambitions.” “”I would like to personally invite industry representatives to join the Skills for a Sustainable Skyline Taskforce, read the new report and to follow the six recommendations to help us build a more sustainable built environment workforce and reshape the sector.”” “The Skills for a Sustainable Skyline taskforce has committed to sustained engagement with the government to promote a reformed Apprenticeship Levy and s106 policy, that is more flexible and meets the needs of employers.” https://lnkd.in/eJgVhPci Source- original post Follow me #MariusPreston #greenbuilding #SustainableSkyline #greenjobs #sustainableeconomy #climatechange #commercialbuildings\n\nNew funding available!

It's been a journey of growth, achievement, and giving back, and we're thrilled to share the highlights that define our remarkable year. Awards Galore: Kilmac soared to new heights in 2023, earning awards that affirm our dedication to excellence. We were honoured to secure a spot on the Fast Growth 50 in Scotland, a testament to our rapid expansion and contribution to the regional economy. The SME Awards crowned us as the Civil Engineering Company of the Year, recognising our innovation and impact in the industry. Adding to the excitement, Callan reached the final of the Scottish Apprenticeship Awards, showcasing our commitment to nurturing and celebrating emerging talent. Welcoming Fresh Faces: This year, Kilmac opened its doors to 61 new team members, each contributing to the vibrant tapestry of our company culture. Among them, we proudly welcomed 3 graduates and 2 apprentices, investing in the next generation of industry leaders. These additions strengthen our capabilities and reflect our commitment to fostering a diverse and skilled workforce. Community Contributions: £72,325.14 and Counting: At Kilmac, we believe in making a positive impact beyond construction sites. In 2023, we donated a total of £72,325.14 to local community projects through financial contributions and in-kind support. This commitment to community betterment is at the core of our values, and we look forward to continuing these efforts in the years to come. Education and Insight: 87 Hours Spent on Local School and College Visits: Empowering the next generation with knowledge and insight into the world of civil engineering has been a priority for Kilmac. Over the past year, our team dedicated 87 hours to school and college visits, engaging with students, and providing a first-hand understanding of the industry.

As we celebrate these accomplishments, we acknowledge that they are a result of the collective efforts of our dedicated team. Looking ahead, Kilmac remains committed to innovation, sustainability, and community engagement. Here's to a year of growth, recognition, and making a positive impact on the world around us.\n\nIn response to the insightful article by Graham Hasting-Evans at FE Week highlighting the critical challenges and recommendations for the construction industry, the #SkillsPeopleGroup wholeheartedly resonate with the urgency and importance of upskilling the workforce to meet the demands of the evolving landscape, particularly in the pursuit of net-zero goals and compliance with regulatory standards. Here's how we address the four key points raised: T𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗮𝗴𝗲: Through our various sustainable construction training programmes and Skills Bootcamps in Construction, we actively contribute to bridging the skills gap in the industry. By equipping individuals with the necessary competencies, we not only facilitate their entry into the workforce but also support their advancement and promotion within the sector. 𝗖𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗼𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗚𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗟𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀: Through collaborative efforts with government entities and local councils, we have established a pathway to offer fully funded courses to a diverse range of participants, thereby democratising access to education and training opportunities within our community. This strategic partnership not only enhances accessibility but also expands the reach of our programmes to a broader spectrum of individuals and businesses. 𝗘𝗻𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲: Our commitment to providing learners with the means to obtain CSCS cards, whether green, blue, gold, or black, underscores our dedication to fostering a competent and compliant workforce. We understand the significance of compliance with #BuildingSafetyRegulations and strive to support our learners in meeting these standards. 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗗𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻: Embracing diversity and inclusion is at the core of our ethos. We actively promote participation in our training programmes through initiatives such as #WomenInConstruction events, ensuring that everyone has equal access to opportunities for skill development and career advancement. We are encouraged by the recommendations proposed by the Construction Leadership Council (CLC), and believe that fostering a cohesive and adaptable skills system tailored to the specific requirements of the construction industry is essential for overcoming these hurdles effectively. By reinforcing and refining current training pathways, creating a unified UK skills framework, strengthening the CSCS scheme, and placing a renewed emphasis on diversity initiatives, we can collaboratively tackle the significant challenges confronting our sector. Together, these actions pave the way for a more resilient and dynamic construction industry, poised to thrive in an ever-evolving landscape. #ConstructionSkills #DiversityInConstruction #BuildingFutureTalent With thanks to Kristy H. for the forward! Four recommendations to build construction’s workforce (feweek.co.uk)\n\nCAN chair Ken Parkin and board member Stuart Miller recently met with Geraldine Cunningham and Donna Nicole from the Economic Development Team at Newcastle City Council to discuss partner working and key regional construction themes. We were delighted to hear about the excellent work the Council is doing to facilitate new entrants into the local construction industry, while driving social value outcomes. The continuing skills shortage being felt by construction firms across the North East was also discussed, with Stuart explaining many of his CECA members are encountering difficulties in recruiting and training groundworkers and plant operators. We hope that moving forward we can work on a more joined up approach between industry and regional partners. The Council’s newly introduced Construction Talent Pool, which links to developments in Newcastle and incorporates built in training and employment management plans secured through planning agreements and conditions, looks set to transform recruitment drives for Newcastle residents and we will continue discussions on how businesses can get involved with the talent pool and employment across the city. There was extensive conversation surrounding apprenticeships and how we can work together on mutually beneficial grounds to identify trade apprenticeship options and help signpost applicants to recruitment opportunities through the Skills Hub and other outlets. Geraldine and Donna did advise that they would be happy to receive further input and intelligence on how the Council can best support the construction sector around recruitment though. Moving forwards, we are planning to reconvene in 2-3 months to pick up on our action points. #ConstructingTheRegion #SkillsShortages #Construction #Meetings #NewcastleCityCouncil #CAN #NorthEast #Apprentices #Recruitment\n\nWe’ve supported more than 360 transformative projects over 13 years 🚀.

What happens now ➡️ https://lnkd.in/e2ir-T9R\n\nSo, Bristol City Council planning team is being overseen by the government to support the backlog of applications..... I have visions of a big bus arriving at the council offices with hundreds of Planners pouring out of the back and racing in to pick up applications and save the day.... I suspect this isn't the case! But I am keen to understand exactly how it will work. And, if it is a workforce issue in terms of not having enough staff, what more can we do to help? Something is stuck in the pipe - I know schools, colleges and universities are doing a good job at promoting planning, the apprenticeship system can help, there are on the job training roles available and mentors who want to support growth so is it a leadership issue or a structure issue? Is it that people aren't wanting a career in planning or is the system just in need of a huge overhaul? I am no expert at all and may sound a little flippant as I don't work in those overworked planning teams - but I'd love to hear your thoughts. Is the 'housing crisis' infact a planning crisis?"
