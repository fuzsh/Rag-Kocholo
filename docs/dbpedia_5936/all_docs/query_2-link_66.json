        "text": "Our values are at the heart of what we do and what we want to achieve.\n\nValues\n\nOur values are inclusive, ambitious, creative and together – I ACT. These values guide how we – with our customers, partners and others – work together to achieve the council’s ambitions.\n\nInclusive – we act with kindness and integrity, respecting differences and embedding equality of opportunity.\n\nAmbitious – we are citizen and community focused, and adaptable in our approach to delivering excellent services as one local council.\n\nCreative – we are connected, inventive, continuously learning and look for improvements that deliver value for money.\n\nTogether – we work collaboratively with colleagues and partners as one team to deliver our shared goals.\n\nBehaviours\n\nOur behaviours are the ways in which we demonstrate the values of our council.\n\nInclusive\n\nBe kind, compassionate and treat each other with respect.\n\nBe inclusive, seek the views of others and respond positively even when there are differences.\n\nCelebrate diversity recognising each other’s contributions.\n\nAmbitious\n\nBe aspirational in our service delivery for our local communities.\n\nSeek opportunities to share ideas and develop our approaches across partners.\n\nUnderstand how to deliver priorities on a locality basis.\n\nCreative\n\nAdapt to a changing environment by listening to others and learning from each other.\n\nThink differently and seek new ways to improve services.\n\nSee feedback and shared views as opportunities to learn.\n\nTogether\n\nBuild on and develop relationships with colleagues and partners.\n\nDeliver excellent customer service through partnership working.\n\nBe visible and accessible within the team and with others to achieve goals together.\n\nAmbitions\n\nOur Council Plan sets out our long-term ambitions. This includes the need to attract new businesses while developing traditional sectors such as farming and tourism, and ensuring career opportunities are available for young people in North Yorkshire. The plan sets out how we deliver services ranging from education, highways and social care to waste collection and disposal, planning and economic development.\n\nAn executive, or decision-making group, made up of ten councillors meets regularly to make decisions about the council's policies and budgets. Five 'overview and scrutiny' committees examine the executive's decisions, while the full council considers the executive's decisions.\n\nMajor issues to be discussed are published in the executive's forward plan which describes the decisions to be made and when, as well as who is responsible for making them.\n\nBy law, the executive is not allowed to make some decisions. So, in addition to the executive we have regulatory committees to make decisions on issues such as planning and highways.\n\nThe decision-making structure is designed to make the council's processes more transparent. The council's constitution sets out how the council operates, how decisions are made, and the rules and procedures which are followed to make sure that these are efficient, transparent and accountable to local people.\n\nWe have a commitment to open government and freedom of information. Public discussions about our policies and the services we provide is an important part of effective local democracy. We therefore give as much information as we can to local people and the press.\n\nYou have a right to see decision making in action and the background information to council decisions. The great majority of meetings are open to the public throughout, but the committee may resolve to meet in private when discussing personal details about individuals or commercial information about contracts. You can listen to recordings of council meetings.\n\nEmployee's commitment\n\nBe supportive of those around you - be understanding and inclusive, treat everyone with kindness and support each other at work, as well as with life's ups and downs.\n\nBe willing to learn - be ambitious, adapt to change and look for improvements, provide excellent service and take opportunities for learning and growth.\n\nBe connected - be engaged and willing to share your professional and local knowledge and be creative in thinking to look for the best ways of doing things.\n\nBe the best you can be - be accountable for doing your job well to the best of your ability. Be an ambassador for the council and together positively promote the work that we do.\n\nEmployer's commitment\n\nWe retain staff - we will provide the opportunities for you to support each other and recognise and reward the contribution and hard work you do. We are committed to having an inclusive workplace culture in which everyone can thrive and reach their full potential.\n\nAttraction for all - we will enable you to do your best work everyday with the right resources, tools and technology and celebrate what we do well and share that learning. With career pathways and progression to suit we can offer a great variety of jobs and ways of working throughout our council, for existing and new colleagues.\n\nEngage and listen to staff - we will listen to each other, partners and communities and act on what we say, provide the opportunities for you to get involved, keep informed, make suggestions and share your ideas. We will be transparent, inclusive and open in communications.\n\nEstablish one new council - we will establish our values and behaviours in everything we do, have visible, respectful and accountable leaders and support strong performance and innovation. Our council will be a welcoming environment."
