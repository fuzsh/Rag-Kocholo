        "text": "A weekly newsletter on campaigning, lobbying and political influence in the U.K.\n\nBy JOHN JOHNSTON\n\nHello and welcome to London Influence. The rizziest little newsletter in the land – no cap. Tips, gossip, state secrets and coffee requests @johnjohnstonmi or [email protected] | View in your browser\n\nSNEAK PEEK\n\n— Politicians are ignoring TikTok — so Nigel Farage’s Reform Party is moving in.\n\n— Big Tech’s been pushing the government to regulate open source AI — instead of them.\n\n— Shock! Another Tory MP gets a telling off from the standards commissioner.\n\nCAMPAIGN CORNER\n\nMEME MANIA: When teenage boys are taking time away from creating videos about football and Call of Duty to make memes about their support for a political party repped by a 59-year-old Brexiteer, you know something strange is happening.\n\nViral hit: At first glance, the success of an insurgent party promising to shake up British politics on TikTok, a platform most popular with younger generations, might seem unremarkable. But Reform UK’s fiery rhetoric about migration and culture wars — bigged up by Nigel Farage — feels like an odd fit for an app dominated by dance videos and gaming news.\n\nAnd yet: With almost 47,000 followers, nearly 600,000 likes and millions of views on their videos, Reform UK are by far the most successful political party on the app in the U.K. With an election looming, Influence dug into the party’s (relative) success on TikTok as the other players keep off the field.\n\nSmall pond: By comparison, closest TikTok competitors the Green Party have a following of 27,000 — but haven’t posted since late January. The Tories, Labour and the Lib Dems don’t even have official channels on the app — with parody accounts the first to surface when users search for the big three.\n\nUnexpected: It’s a rise that seems to have caught even Reform party insiders off guard.\n\nLaunch pad: “When we first went on to TikTok our views weren’t too good — but as we’ve grown as a party nationwide, the views have rocketed way ahead of any other platform and that’s surprised us because the demographic on TikTok is predominantly 15-to-24 year olds,” says Reform press officer Matt Stevens, responsible for running the party’s account on the app.\n\nMarsupial unmentionable muncher: Farage, Reform’s co-founder and honorary president, is a key part in building Reform’s TikTok profile. He appeared late last year on reality show I’m a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here, precipitating a surge in support on his own personal account, and by extension pushing Reform further into the TikTok spotlight.\n\nBut: Farage is one of only a handful of U.K. politicians who have found success on the app.\n\nShapps slaps: Left-wing Labour MP Zarah Sultana has grabbed a huge following, while Defence Secretary Grant Shapps leaps on the popular video formats that dominate the app. A recent video about the government’s energy strategy mimicked the style of … Grand Theft Auto.\n\nChina fears: Shapps’ ability to score W’s (that’s wins for those who aren’t down with the kids) is fairly unique. Most other fledgling Westminster influencers have dead accounts, either because they struggled to keep up — or deleted TikTok after security fears about the app’s Chinese links.\n\nJUST ONE SECOND: Sophia Smith Galer, a journalist and broadcaster who has built a massive following on the app, tells Influence Reform’s success is still modest given the potential for growth on the app.\n\nLow tiers: “I know [their follower numbers] feels like a lot, but in terms of being a presence on TikTok it’s nothing,” she says. “There are people who get that amount of followers from two viral videos. So it might seem like a big number. And certainly, if you are concerned about right-wing populism growing in the U.K., I think any number looks concerning.”\n\nUnimpressed: “I’m not here thinking they are doing a particularly terrific job,” Galer adds. “But if other politicians don’t get on TikTok they are not going to be able to control any narrative about them on the app.”\n\nAND YET: Reform’s rivals don’t seem too concerned about its TikTok ascent. A digital strategist from the Conservative Party explains that the party has made an active decision to eschew it because it “just isn’t where our voters are.”\n\nWarning signs: But Ben Guerin, co-founder of the digital strategy firm Topham Guerin, credited with helping deliver Boris Johnson’s 2019 election landslide, warns that it’s “negligent” for any party to ignore the app.\n\nKiwi capers: He points to the firm’s success on the platform in last year’s New Zealand election — proof, he says, that right-wing parties can secure big wins with younger demographics.\n\nHe said: “This is an election where he had an old white man, a bald guy who is on the right side of politics, achieve 75 percent of all those views among 18- to 35-year olds,” Guerin recalls. “We were able to prove that the right can actually win younger voters when you talk to people where they are and in the language that they’re using.”\n\nDown with the kids: The digital gurus say their success on the app was down to having a proper strategy, including tracking popular meme formats that bubble up, and planning a fun and engaging way to adapt them to a party’s message. That’s crucial on a platform which has expressly banned political advertising or paying influencers to push a message.\n\nRisk averse: “The problem with a lot of political communications is everyone’s trying to mitigate risk,” he says. “And you end up with something so polished that it just doesn’t connect with people and a lot of what we do is we try to help our clients… to do stuff that feels authentic on the platform, without completely throwing caution to the wind.”\n\nFurther reading: We’ve got plenty more on Reform’s strangely-formatted TikTok ascent in our full story here — including a surprising chat with a troll who went down a “rabbit hole” and then genuinely ended up liking the cut of Farage’s jib.\n\nQUICK HITS\n\nBIG TECH TUSSLE: Big tech firms have been lobbying Jeremy Hunt to avoid regulating them and instead focus on the potential risk of open source AI, according to meeting minutes obtained by my ace POLITICO tech colleagues.\n\nMachine learning: The meeting came last June came as fears over the rise of the robots hit fever pitch, leading to concerns that big tech is lobbying against open source AI to gain a competitive advantage.\n\nThreat level: There’s a concerted pushback too. Nathan Benaich and Alex Chalmers, from VC firm Air Street Capital, penned a report last week making the case for open source, saying it was “under existential threat from both regulation and well-funded lobby groups.”\n\nWINDFALL WARNING: Tory MP David Duguid got a rap on the knuckles from the parliamentary standards commissioner after he spoke in several debates about windfall taxes on the oil and gas sector but failed to declare his wife’s shareholding in BP.\n\nSharing the spoils: It came after the Guardian analysed BP’s share register and found the former oil industry worker-turned MP had moved the shares into his wife’s name five years before becoming an MP.\n\nNaughty school: The commissioner ruled the breach was “inadvertent”but ordered him to apologise and attend further training about how to properly declare his interests.\n\nTECH TOGETHER: A new Women’s Tech Policy Network launched this week- for mid-to-senior level women in the tech and public affairs world.\n\nLaunch pad: The group is being led by Casey Calista from Hill+Knowlton Strategies and Hannah Shimko, boss of the Online Dating and Discovery Association. The first meeting this week sold out.\n\nUp next: The group is planning to meet once a month and has already reached out to sponsors. Calista says it’s important for women in a male dominated sector to have a proper support network — and make sure their voices are heard in policymaking.\n\nON THE MOVE\n\nVictoria Hemmingway is joining North London Waste Authority as a public affairs manager following a stint at Hft.\n\nJacob Wallace has started a new role as public policy and Welsh affairs manager at National Grid.\n\nMaxwell Patterson joined the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs as a policy adviser after a spell at Fields in Trust.\n\nAlleisha Furlonge-Royal started as principal government relations officer at the Greater London Authority.\n\nDavid Stewart has been promoted to senior communications officer at RenewableUK.\n\nHarri Coldray joined Global Counsel as a senior associate for sustainable finance and ESG after a stint working for the government’s Inclusive Economy Unit.\n\nJeff Knot is starting as advocacy and influence director at Cats Protection from RSPB.\n\nFormer High Speed 1 chief exec Dyan Perry has joined the High Speed Rail Group as chair.\n\nAshwaaq Hassan started as project delivery manager at Department for Leveling Up, Housing and Communities.\n\nJoshua Mackenzie-Lawrie is starting as an account manager at H/Advisors Cicero.
