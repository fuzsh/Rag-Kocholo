        "text": "Conservations between council officers could be heard during the West London Waste Authority meeting on Friday (March 26) streamed via the Harrow Council website.\n\nTheir overlapping conference call meant the audience could not clearly hear the committee going through the agenda, which included audit reports, procurement updates, an annual review and the response to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nInstead there were snippets from officers discussing the meeting taking place and other aspects related to the wider, new, online meeting process.\n\nHarrow Council has uploaded previous online meetings to a YouTube channel – however, Friday’s meeting has yet to be archived.\n\nThe council explained that someone had unwittingly left their microphone on which caused the issue.\n\nThe West London Waste Authority covers waste disposal across Brent, Ealing, Harrow, Hillingdon, Hounslow and Richmond – it is currently chaired by Harrow Council leader Cllr Graham Henson."
