Changes we have not yet applied to the text, can be found in the ‘Changes to Legislation’ area.\n\nOriginal (As Enacted or Made): The original version of the legislation as it stood when it was enacted or made. No changes have been applied to the text.\n\nExplanatory Notes\n\nText created by the government department responsible for the subject matter of the Act to explain what the Act sets out to achieve and to make the Act accessible to readers who are not legally qualified. Explanatory Notes were introduced in 1999 and accompany all Public Acts except Appropriation, Consolidated Fund, Finance and Consolidation Acts.\n\nTimeline of Changes\n\nThis timeline shows the different points in time where a change occurred. The dates will coincide with the earliest date on which the change (e.g an insertion, a repeal or a substitution) that was applied came into force. The first date in the timeline will usually be the earliest date when the provision came into force. In some cases the first date is 01/02/1991 (or for Northern Ireland legislation 01/01/2006). This date is our basedate. No versions before this date are available. For further information see the Editorial Practice Guide and Glossary under Help."
