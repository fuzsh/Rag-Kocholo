        "text": "The UK’s Labour party has swept to victory in the country’s general election, securing 412 seats out of 650 – with the Conservatives registering their worst result in history.\n\nPrime minister Keir Starmer ran for office on a manifesto that promised big changes to the country’s climate, energy and nature policies.\n\nKey pledges – reiterated by secretary of state Ed Miliband in a message to civil servants at the department for energy security and net-zero – include reaching zero-carbon power by 2030, relaunching the country’s ambition to be a climate leader on the global stage and rewriting the nation’s net-zero strategy.\n\nMeeting such milestones will require the Labour government to enact extensive change across every sector of the economy, ranging from overhauling the planning system to developing a “just transition” plan for the North Sea oil and gas sector.\n\nAs well as meeting its own manifesto pledges, Labour will need to contend with a backlog of overdue frameworks, strategies and international pledges that were not completed by the previous government.\n\nLabour has also committed to reversing climate policy rollbacks enacted by Rishi Sunak’s Conservative government.\n\nTo create a comprehensive picture of the to-do list facing Labour, Carbon Brief has analysed the party’s pledges, combed through official documents and Climate Change Committee (CCC) advice and spoken to climate policy experts.\n\nBelow, Carbon Brief outlines the key climate, energy and nature issues in Labour’s in-tray for the coming months and years.
