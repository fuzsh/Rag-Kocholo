Find out what we do to maximise recycling and reuse.\n\nWe are committed to removing as much recyclable material as possible from the waste we manage every year.\n\nWaste that cannot be reused or recycled is sent to our Energy from Waste (EFW) plant. Here, it is converted into electricity to supply power to 80,000 homes every year.\n\nAt LondonEnergy, we believe that waste is not just something to be thrown away. Instead, we see it as a valuable material that can be transformed into new and useful items."
