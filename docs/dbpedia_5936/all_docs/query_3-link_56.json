        "text": "North London Waste Authority is building a new energy recovery facility, which will replace the current Edmonton energy from waste facility that is coming to the end of its useful life.\n\nBarhale identified the opportunity for simultaneous pipejacking as part of the design phase. The company is using two Iseki 1200 tunnel boring machines (TBMs) – named Freya and Artemis – to help divert existing sewers at Chingford and Angel. The TBMs will complete two pipejacks of 122m and 210m length to install two new 1,200mm sewers.\n\nBarhale contracts manager Jaimie Lawson said: “It is a point of principle for us that we scrutinise every job to try to find economies and efficiencies both in the design phase and also throughout construction.\n\n“This is a hugely important project for the capital and one which is very much in the public’s eye, so we are pleased to have been able to find ways of not only accelerating our programme but also adding value and minimising any potential disruption to the community and reducing environmental impact.”\n\nBy carrying out two pipejacks at the same time, it means subsequent contractors can access the site earlier.\n\n“It builds on our earlier design solution of relocating one of the reception shafts to help decongest the site, generating a significant programme saving for the client,” Lawson added.\n\nNorth London Waste Authority senior project manager Terry Brandon welcomed Barhale’s innovative approach.\n\n“This is an ambitious project with tight build parameters, so we are keen to embrace all ideas and approaches which can accelerate the programme,” he noted.\n\nNorth London Waste Authority’s replacement facility at the Edmonton EcoPark will deal with up to 700,000t of waste from the seven north London boroughs per year. It is due to become operational in 2025 and will generate around 70MW of electricity."
