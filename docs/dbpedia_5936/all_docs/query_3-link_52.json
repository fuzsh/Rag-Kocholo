The document discusses the legal requirement for authorities to cooperate, known as the \"duty to cooperate\", in preparing strategic development plans that affect multiple areas. Specifically, it examines arguments around whether the North London Waste Plan (NLWP) satisfied this duty in its preparation. While the NLWP councils claim waste management and export of waste from their area does not significantly impact other areas, the inspector concludes the duty to cooperate extends to authorities where North London's waste is received and cumulative effects of waste exports must be considered. The inspector determines the NLWP authorities needed to cooperate with waste authorities in areas receiving North London's exported waste to comply with the duty.",
