See notes to editors below for link to the media report.\n\nA meeting of the North London Waste Authority to award the construction contract for the redevelopment will be held on Thursday 16 December 2021. The Authority covers seven boroughs: Barnet, Camden, Enfield, Hackney, Haringey, Islington and Waltham Forest.\n\nMichael Ainsley, GMB Regional officer for engineering construction, said \"The North Waste Authority already manages about a quarter of all the rubbish and recycling in London.\n\nThis new incinerator is much cleaner than the one it is replacing and it turns waste into energy. GMB London is urging the local authorities involved to press on with the project.\n\nAs well as protecting the environment and helping with the climate, the building and subsequent operation of a new incinerator will provide many good quality well paid jobs and apprenticeships for local people.\n\nGMB has been at the forefront in securing a structured national agreement for the building of the new incinerator via the National joint Agreement Engineering Construction industry agreement (NAECI) itâ€™s a structured agreement that ensures a stable industrial relationship between trade unions and employers. It is pivotal to the successful completion of projects on time and on budget.\n\nGMB is eager to ensure a clean stable environment for our members and their children, but we must be careful not to throw the baby out with the bath water if we delay or scrap this project, ever increasing levels of waste will continue to be put into Landfill and find its way into our rivers and oceans.\"\n\nEnd\n\nContact Michael Ainsley on 07974 250947 or GMB London press office 07921 289880\n\nNotes to editors\n\nLink to recent news report"
