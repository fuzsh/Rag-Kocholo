        "text": "Defence\n\nInvest in housing for Armed Forces\n\nUpgrade Office for Veterans’ Affairs\n\nFree education for troops and veterans\n\nBasic pay increase\n\nNew Armed Forces Justice Bill\n\nIncrease defence spending\n\nRecruit 30,000 new soldiers\n\nReform would overhaul the military procurement process as one of its defence priorities while also promising to invest in “properly equipping and housing” Armed Forces personnel.\n\nIt would upgrade the existing Office for Veterans’ Affairs to a fully-fledged Department for Veterans’ Affairs, which would receive £1 billion funding a year.\n\nTroops and veterans alike would be entitled to free education during and after their service, with Reform saying this is “vital to ensure a successful return to civilian life”.\n\nBasic pay would be increased across the forces, with the pre-manifesto adding: “It is unacceptable that a private soldier is paid less than an Amazon worker.”\n\nA new Armed Forces Justice Bill would protect serving military personnel in the UK and abroad from civil law and human rights lawyers, while also creating an armed forces watchdog to fast-track complaints about military accommodation and welfare for veterans.\n\nDefence spending, which is currently on track to reach 2.25 per cent next year, would increase to 2.5 per cent by 2027 before rising to 3 per cent by 2030.\n\nThe manifesto also states that Reform would recruit 30,000 new full-time soldiers for the Army.\n\nPensions and welfare\n\nBack-to-work push\n\nWithdraw jobseekers’ benefits\n\nFace-to-face PIP assessments\n\nRemodel savings and pension system\n\nMr Farage’s party wants to get two million people back into work and would launch a wide-ranging suppression on welfare in order to achieve this, with a back-to-work push that places particular emphasis on those aged 16 to 34.\n\nBenefits for jobseekers would be withdrawn either after four months of unemployment or the rejection of two job offers.\n\nAssessment for personal independence payment (PIP) would have to take place face-to-face to build relationships and coach people back into work, while medical assessments for those on benefits would be required to take place independently.\n\nA royal commission to tackle social care is among “critical reforms” to the social care system the party is seeking to deliver in the first 100 days after the election. A loophole that it says allows larger care home providers to avoid tax through offshore structures would be closed.\n\nReform has said it wants to improve the savings and pension system in the long term to make it “much better and cheaper, from a much younger age”, citing Australia as a model.\n\nPolicing and crime\n\nIncrease police numbers\n\nEnforcement of “zero tolerance” policing\n\nReview of police leadership teams\n\nAbolish all diversity, equality and inclusion roles and regulations\n\nAutomatic life imprisonment for violent offenders\n\nHigh-intensity training camps for young offenders\n\nDeport child groomers with dual nationality\n\nReform accused the outgoing government of being “soft on crime” and paints a picture of “badly failing” police leadership, citing a collapse in charging rates to around 5 per cent.\n\nIts immediate law and order objectives include the start of an increase in police numbers that would see 40,000 new officers over the course of a five-year parliament.\n\n“Zero tolerance” policing, which the party said has been a success in New York, would mean offenders received jail sentences for all violent crimes and the possession of a knife. A new offence of substantial possession of drugs would lead to heavy fines, while the use of stop-and-search would be vastly expanded, with Reform hailing it as a “proven deterrent to knife crime”.\n\nPolice leadership teams would be reviewed and where necessary replaced, with a “strong preference” for military veterans.\n\nAll diversity, equality and inclusion roles and regulations would be abolished in an attempt to stop what Mr Tice referred to in his spring conference speech as “two-tier policing”.\n\nPolice and Crime Commissioners would either be scrapped or reformed – “either they get the power to make a real change or they should go” – and degree-standard entry would be replaced with entrance exams, while officers would have to complete two years of probation.\n\nViolent offenders would receive automatic life imprisonment as part of an urgent review.\n\nThe definition of hate crime would be changed in order to require “proper evidence”, pro-Palestine marches banned using existing powers, 10,000 new detention places created and the budget of the National Crime Agency increased to tackle foreign gang crime.\n\nYoung offenders, meanwhile, would face high-intensity training camps that would reopen to offer “basic education, training and values… [This model] is needed more than ever”.\n\nReform UK also wants to cut down on cash-only barbershops, which the party claims are a front for money laundering after experts and senior industry figures warned some of traders engage in illegal activity and undercut honest traders in communities.\n\nThe Reform manifesto states that “foreign gang crime” accounts for most organised crime in the UK at a cost of £37 billion per year, adding: “This includes drugs, people trafficking and money laundering through barbershops, car washes and nail bars.”\n\nThe party has pledged to ensure there are more bobbies on the beat in local communities and to enforce higher standards of fitness in the police.\n\nIt has also unveiled plans to deport child groomers who have dual nationality.\n\nMigration\n\nImmigration tax\n\nLeave European Convention on Human Rights\n\nFreeze “non-essential” migration\n\nAbolish Home Office\n\nReduce student visas\n\nBan new arrivals from receiving benefits\n\nThe party pledged to introduce an immigration tax forcing employers to pay an increased National Insurance rate of 20 per cent for every foreign employee, compared with the current 13.8 figure for domestic staff.\n\nWriting in The Telegraph, Mr Tice said the tax would incentivise companies to recruit British workers over cheaper foreign labour and provide the “antidote” to 14 years of Tory failures to curb net migration.\n\nThe party also said it would end illegal immigration and vastly reduce legal migration by leaving the ECHR, introducing a “one in, one out” migration quota.\n\nAll “non-essential” migration would be frozen within weeks. Illegal migration would be deemed a national security threat, migrants would be picked up out of boats and taken back to France and the Home Office abolished and replaced by a new Department for Immigration.\n\nForeign criminals would be deported immediately after their prison sentences end and citizenship withdrawn from immigrants who commit “significant” crimes.\n\nA proposed clamp down on student visas and their dependants is designed to mean that only students with essential skills can remain in the UK as soon as their studies end.\n\nUnder Reform’s plans, “significant” penalties would be levelled on companies that make use of undocumented and illegal labour.\n\nThe manifesto also includes a ban on newly arrived migrants receiving benefits. It states: “We will impose a requirement of 5 years residency and employment to claim any benefits in the UK.”\n\nBrexit\n\nAxe all remaining EU laws\n\nScrap the Windsor Framework\n\nRenegotiate Brexit trade deal\n\nReform’s manifesto includes a commitment to axe all of the 6,700 EU laws still on the British statute books.\n\nThe party says this is required because UK rules on state aid, competition, employment, net zero and the environment are still effectively derived from Brussels.\n\nIt also commits to ripping up the Windsor Framework, the deal which was struck between Britain and the EU to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, which has left the latter in the EU’s single market. “It is unacceptable that British citizens in Northern Ireland are being ruled by EU laws,” the manifesto states.\n\nReform says it would also prepare for talks with Brussels over renegotiating the whole Brexit trade deal which it says has left Britain tied to EU rules and “is holding us back”.\n\nFamilies\n\nMarriage tax allowance on income up to £25,000\n\n“Frontload” benefits system to allow mothers to stay at home\n\nPromote development of child-friendly smartphones\n\nInquiry into social media harms\n\nReform has unveiled a series of family-friendly tax-and-spend policies designed to encourage marriage and having children.\n\nThey include a 25 per cent marriage tax allowance, which would mean no income tax was charged on the first £25,000 of income for either spouse.\n\nThe party also wants to “frontload” the benefits system for children aged one to four so that more parents can choose to stay at home.\n\nReform says it would also promote the development of child-friendly smartphones, which are restricted to only having certain apps, to tackle rising mental health issues amongst the young.\n\nIt would also launch an inquiry into social media harms as well as going after online giants that push “baseless transgender ideology and divisive Critical Race theory”.\n\nTransport\n\nScrap HS2\n\nBan Ulez\n\nAxe 2035 ban on sale of new petrol and diesel cars\n\nOutlaw creation of 20mph zones\n\nBring 50 per cent of utilities companies into public ownership\n\nReform says that in its first 100 days it would scrap the “bloated” HS2 high-speed train line between London and Birmingham, saving £25 billion.\n\nIt would also “stop the war on drivers” by introducing a ban on ultra-low emission zones – like the one in London – and low traffic neighbourhoods.\n\nThe party would also axe the proposed 2035 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and outlaw the creation of 20mph zones.\n\nIn the longer term it would prioritise the improvement of existing transport infrastructure and launch a plan to bring 50 per cent of all utilities companies into public ownership.\n\nConstitution and culture\n\nScrap the TV licence\n\nIntroduce free speech bill to prevent political bias in public institutions\n\nMake St George’s Day a bank holiday\n\nMake the House of Lords more democratic\n\nReform postal voting to tackle fraud\n\nQuit the WHO unless it undergoes fundamental restructuring\n\nReform’s manifesto includes a commitment to scrap the £170 a year television licence and to reform the “institutionally biased” and “out-of-touch” BBC.\n\nThe party would also introduce a new free speech bill to “stop Left-wing bias and politically correct ideology that threatens personal freedom and democracy”.\n\nThe manifesto adds: “No more de-banking, cancel culture, left wing hate mobs or political bias in public institutions. Stop Sharia law being used in the UK.”\n\nElsewhere it would make St George’s Day a bank holiday and would reform both the Lords, to make it more democratic, and postal voting to tackle fraud.\n\nReform says it would reject the World Health Organisation’s pandemic treaty and quit the organisation itself “unless there is fundamental reform to its structure and funding”."
