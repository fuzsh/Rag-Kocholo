        "text": "Edmonton EcoPark is currently undertaking a major upgrade, with the North London Heat and Power Project ensuring waste from local residents can continue to be managed sustainably and energy and heat can be produced to benefit the community.\n\nAs part of the project ACCIONA are building a new replacement state-of-the-art Energy Recovery Facility (ERF), and here at NRL we’re delighted to be supporting the project to deliver a talent pool that on site sub-contractors can draw from whenever they need construction and engineering skills.\n\nIn this special issue of Net Zero News, we take a look at the project in more detail and find out how the talent pool will benefit workers seeking a new challenge.\n\n​\n\nThe scale of the project\n\nThe new ERF will replace the existing energy from waste plant currently on Edmonton EcoPark. The new technology and technical efficiency of the 78 megawatt ERF under construction and expected to commence operation by 2025, will allow the North London Waste Authority to continue to divert waste from landfill whilst increasing their capacity to create energy from waste.\n\nThe £683 million build contract awarded to ACCIONA, forms part of the wider £1.2 billion investment through a programme of works that make up the North London Heat and Power Project – which includes a new Resource Recovery Facility with the capacity to manage around 135,000 tonnes of recycling each year.\n\nElectricity generated from the ERF ACCIONA is currently constructing will power up to 127,000 homes, whilst a decentralised energy network will provide heat to up to 60,000 homes.\n\n​\n\nConstructing an ERF\n\nACCIONA were appointed by the North London Waste Authority and construction commenced in 2022. Key components that will be installed during the construction of the ERF include a boiler; steam turbine and generator; generator step up transformer; and plate heat exchanger.\n\nThe site will operate under the National Agreement for the Engineering and Construction Industry (NAECI) working rule agreement.\n\nThe agreement was developed to establish standardised terms and conditions across a project, for how workers are paid and managed on site, as well as providing a health and safety framework to support their welfare and the safe delivery of key infrastructure projects.\n\nNRL’s project team have extensive experience working with NAECI, having worked with contracting companies since 2008 to support over 5,000 working on high-profile NAECI sites.\n\n​\n\nBuilding a project talent pool\n\nTo ensure ACCIONA’s supply chain has access to enough people to build the ERF, NRL are building a project talent pool. Welcoming interested parties with a range of skills to register their interest in working on the project through a central recruitment process that all sub-contractors on site will use to engage workers.\n\nNRL’s team will review applications and verify qualifications and experience, before inviting candidates to join the project talent pool where their skills will be carefully matched when sub-contractors are looking for additional support.\n\nTypical skills and disciplines that are expected to be needed throughout the project build include:\n\nApprentice, Chargehand, Mechanical, Electrical, Driver/Operator, Scaffolding, Health and Safety, Fabrication, Inspection, Rope Access, Piping, Project Control, Rigging, Plating, Welding, HVAC, QA and QC.\n\n​\n\nWelcoming applications with a recruitment fair\n\nCandidates who are interested in joining the talent pool are invited to register to attend a recruitment fair on Monday 19th February.\n\nHosted at the Engine Rooms in Tottenham, lunchtime and afternoon sessions will be available on the day which will both include a presentation from project stakeholders before the chance to meet the recruitment team and find out more about applying to join the talent pool.\n\nREGISTER TO ATTEND\n\nRegistrations for the talent pool are now open\n\nAnyone who would like to register their interest to join the project talent pool to work on the Edmonton ERF project are invited to apply through the project application form below.\n\nAPPLY TO JOIN THE TALENT POOL\n\n​\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe North London Waste Authority, owners of the Edmonton EcoPark, services seven different North London boroughs – with over 2 million people relaying on them to safely dispose of their rubbish and recycling, with up to 700,000 tonnes of waste produced each year.\n\n​\n\n​​Get the latest Net Zero News\n\nYou can instantly receive updates like this by subscribing to our LinkedIn newsletter.\n\nSubscribe\n\n​"
