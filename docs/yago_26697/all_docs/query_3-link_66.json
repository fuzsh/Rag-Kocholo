        "text": "The recent centenary of the First World War shone again the spotlight on the status of Queen Victoria as the “Grandmother of Europe,” where eight out of her nine children married into the various royal houses of Europe; and this even continued with her grandchildren. Various books, documentaries, articles, and conferences have focused on Victoria’s older children – particularly Vicky and Alice whose children Kaiser Wilhem II and Tsarina Alexandra played a pivotal role in their country’s histories: with the former helping unleash the First World War and the latter the Russian Revolution that spelled the end for both the Hohenzollern and Romanov dynasties.\n\nTwo recent events in Scandinavia led me to look at Queen Victoria’s younger children and their descendants who have been less well known.\n\nSeptember 2023 marked the Golden Jubilee of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, making him Sweden’s longest reigning monarch (he had already broken the previous record set by Magnus IV’s reign of 44 years & 222 days in 2018). During the state dinner which formed part of the jubilee celebrations, the King was not only joined by members of the Swedish royal family, government officials and other important dignitaries but crucially by his fellow Nordic heads of state – the Queen of Denmark, the King of Norway (also descendants of Queen Victoria) and the Presidents of Finland and Iceland. The September celebrations marked the high point of the jubilee year which saw King Carl Gustaf and his wife Queen Silvia visit every province in Sweden.\n\nPhoto: Thron Ullberg/Kungl. Hovstaterna\n\nAnother event which happened on 14 January 2024 was the abdication of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark after a reign of 52 years. Her abdication marked the end of an era – not only in Denmark but also in Europe where she will be the last queen regnant for a while until the time comes for the likes of Victoria of Sweden, Ingrid-Alexandra of Norway, Leonor of Spain, Amalia of the Netherlands, and Elisabeth of Belgium. Margrethe II had previously said that she would never abdicate but announced her intention to do so when she delivered her annual New Year’s Eve speech to the nation on the 31st December 2023. And unlike Carl Gustaf’s jubilee which passed by unnoticed, the Danish queen’s speech became headline news in the UK, which I suppose is unsurprising given this is unprecedented and led to speculation as to why Margrethe would decide to do a U turn. Is it because she was trying to protect her heir and his wife from the fall out of some recent “scandal”? I believe that the simplest reason is the answer – Margrethe was a heavy smoker and had to undergo an operation last year, so in the end her decades of smoking and health problems associated with age have caught up with her and she felt she could no longer continue with her duties as sovereign.\n\nIt’s not surprising that the first to send a message of support to the abdicating queen and the new king Frederik X was the Swedish King. This message together with, the presence of Queen Margarethe II and being seated alongside the King of Sweden during the jubilee dinner not only underscored the close diplomatic relations between the two countries but also their close familial ties as both are first cousins descended from King Gustaf VI Adolf and his first wife Crown Princess Margareta.\n\nMargareta born Princess Margaret Victoria Charlotte Augusta Norah of Connaught in 1882 and nicknamed Daisy was one of the three children born to Queen Victoria’s third son, Arthur Duke of Connaught, and his Prussian wife Louise. Arthur could be described as the most “normal” and “boring” of Victoria’s sons, as he had an uneventful and dutiful life as well as a marriage that was happy despite his long-standing affair (which was encouraged by his wife) with Leonie Lady Leslie, a sister of Lady Randolph Churchill.\n\nArthur was also the antithesis of a “problem child.” He was unlike his oldest brother Bertie (the future Edward VII) and younger brother Leopold, both of whom rebelled against their mother’s expectations of them: the former with Victoria’s attempts to turn him into Albert 2.0 while the latter reacted against efforts to cast him into the family’s “saintly invalid” with the determination to live his life to the full. He was also unlike his next oldest brother Alfred who turned into an embittered alcoholic due to the collapse of his marriage to Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia and having to give up his naval career to become Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.\n\nThe abovementioned details are perhaps the reasons why Arthur is the least known of Queen Victoria’s sons and his children by extension are little known as well. While Arthur’s many nieces and nephews mostly married into German royal families, two of his children Arthur and Patricia married into the British aristocracy. Margaret on the other hand married into the Swedish royal family – Prince Gustaf Adolf, the oldest son of Crown Prince Gustav (who would go on to reign as King Gustav V of Sweden) who she met while on holiday with her family in Egypt. After a whirlwind courtship, the couple married at St George’s Chapel at Windsor in 1905, then made their way to Sweden where the princess changed her name to Margareta and made it her mission to assimilate into Swedish life.\n\nShe was vivacious and outgoing which endeared her to Swedes. In addition, she became fluent in Swedish and travelled to various parts of the country to learn more about Sweden and its people. This was also facilitated by her active charity work especially during the First World War where despite Sweden being neutral, Margareta used her office and position to help distribute home comforts to prisoners of war on both sides.\n\nMargareta could also be described as a princess and a woman ahead of her time. She and Gustav Adolf had five children – Gustaf Adolf, Sigvard, Ingrid, Bertil, and Carl Johan – and being a hands-on mother, Margareta refused to turn her children over to be totally raised by nannies and footmen. Taking an active interest in the development of her children, she involved them in many of her interests and even established a school in the family’s residence to give them their first lessons and meet other children their age. Already sports mad due to her British upbringing, with the Swedish press noting her proficiency in sports such as tennis, golf and cycling, Margareta also took to winter sports in her adopted country – enthusiastically encouraging other women to do the same. She founded an all-women hockey team in 1908 and this initiative spawned other all-women’s teams across the country.\n\nMuch like her paternal grandmother Queen Victoria, Margareta was a talented artist and a published author. She was friends with the artist Anna Boberg, her husband’s uncle Prince Eugen, himself a professional artist and was mentored by both. Unlike her grandmother who painted watercolours for her own private enjoyment, Margareta dabbled in oil painting and exhibited her work publicly while her forays into being a published author was through her love of gardening and creation of the garden at Sofiero Palace. Her two books Vår trädgård på Sofiero (Our Garden at Sofiero) and Från blomstergården (From the Flower Garden) were published in 1915 and 1917. Both books were illustrated with her drawings and photographs then sold in aid of her various charities.\n\nSadly, for her family and adopted country, Margareta died on 1 May 1920 from sepsis. Prior to this she had been suffering from a mastoid in her ear which was a result from a bout of measles and she was also pregnant with her sixth child. Prime Minister Hjalmar Branting on announcing her death said: “the ray of sunshine at Stockholm Palace has gone out.” Interestingly and perhaps as a reaction to her grandmother Queen Victoria’s morbid and obsessive mourning for Prince Albert, Margareta left strict instructions that in the event of her death there should be a little mourning, that children should not wear black, music be played and that her funeral should be open to all.\n\nMargareta was only 38 when she died but in her short life and tenure as Crown Princess, she managed to make an impact in her adopted country so perhaps it’s not surprising that huge numbers of ordinary people turned out for her funeral. She arrived in Sweden at a time when the country was undergoing huge political, economic, and social changes; Margareta responded to those changes positively through her charity and social work. Her social commitment lives on in the memorial fund that was established after her death as well as the causes championed by her great-granddaughter Crown Princess Victoria. Her artistic talents live on through her son Sigvard who carved out a successful career as a designer and technical adviser in film as well as her granddaughter Margrethe II of Denmark who designed costumes and sets for various stage and screen productions.\n\nShe might be virtually unknown in her country of birth but her legacy has lived on in her adopted country.\n\nFurther reading:"
