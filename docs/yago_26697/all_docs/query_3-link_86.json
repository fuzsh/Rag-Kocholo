        "text": "WI Queen Victoria was advised of the contreceptive side effect which often acompanies breast feeding.\n\nShe is know to have HATED being pregnant.\n\nI think that upper and middle class Victorian babies would have been healthier because more would be fed by their own mothers.\n\nVictoria would have had fewer children and therefore fewer sons.\n\nThe chance of none of her sons out living her and leaving legitimate heirs would increase\n\nSo what if Willy the Stupid is due to become King of England in Janaury 1901\n\nAt the time of her marriage, the Princess Royal was 5th in line to the British throne. She had four older brothers, the chances of her becoming Queen were small - it would have required a monumental tragedy.\n\nHad the Princess Royal's chances of succeeding to the throne been greater, i.e. if she only had 1 brother, then serious thought has to be given as to whether she would have still contracted a marriage with the future King of Prussia, at least not until her brother the Prince of Wales had produced a few heirs.\n\nIts worth noting that Vicky was the only one of Victoria and Albert's daughters who made a truly dazzling dynastic match, Victoria was not especially ambitious for her daughters, Albert was, especially for Vicky but again that was perhaps influenced by her relative insignificance in terms of the succession.\n\nAssuming Vicky did indeed still become German Empress and heiress presumptive to the British throne (she could never be heiress apparent, even after her mother had ceased being able to bear children), then her children would have no doubt been raised with greater awareness of their maternal heritage (Vicky's two younger daughters were certainly aware of it) and there would have to be some negotiation about the future education of a Prussian-British monarch.\n\nThe British parliament was not beyond legislating to determine the succession to ensure they got the monarchy they wanted, that is how the Hanoverians got the throne in the first place and I think certainly in the 1860s and 1870s when the British monarchy was deeply unpopular and unstable, the British government would have felt more powerful in negotiating suitable arrangements. I am thinking that there may have been some agreement that Vicky's second son would be his mother's British heir and he would have probably been sent to England.\n\nEven assuming he did not and Vicky's elder son became King of Great Britain and German Emperor, Kaiser Wilhelm would not have become King of Great Britain in January 1901. His mother did not die until August 1901. She would have reigned as Victoria II.\n\nThere's always the possibility that the British parliament would legislate to deprive Vicky of her rights of succession and select one of her sisters as their mother's heir.\n\nFew thoughts\n\nIf by some miracle (or tragedy) Victoria does end up heiress presumptive and you can get rid of all four of her brothers and their issue i have no doubt Parliament will intervene to amend the succession.\n\nPossibly excluding the descendants of British princesses married to foreign rulers or the heirs to foreign thrones.\n\nWhich would exclude both Victoria and Alice and their issue.\n\nWhich would settle the succession on the Princess Helena and her English-born and raised children.\n\nHer marriage in 1865 had caused a bit of a family-rift but she remained exceptionally close to her mother and given her strong views on nursing and women's rights would have made rather an interesting Queen considering she survived her mother and would have reigned from 1901 to 1923.\n\nher surviving issue were -\n\nPrince Christian d 1900 in the Boer War unmarried but had he moved up the succession then would undoubtedly have married.\n\nPrince Albert d 1931\n\nPrincess Helena Victoria d 1948\n\nPrincess Marie Louise d 1956 Married 1891; Prince Aribert of Anhalt; no issue; divorced 1900\n\nInterestingly delaying conception might not have made much difference given the birth dates of V & A's issue: the only ones with a short gap were Victoria and Edward (just under a year), Alice and Alfred (Just over a year) - 1840, 1841, 1843, 1844, 1846, 1848, 1850, 1853, 1857.\n\nIf Vicky falls heiress before her marriage then her husband would not have been the heir to the Prussian Throne (Parliament would never have sanctioned it) - if she falls heir later then it again depends on when.\n\nIf her children are young and her family agree to dispatch the second son to be educated in Britain (Victoria had reacted with reluctance when her brother in law tried consistantly to try and get her to send Alfred to Coburg for his education) - then parliament might be willing to name her second son Prince Henry as Victoria's heir - passing a bill excluding Vicky and her eldest son (similar to the Coburg succession for example).\n\nIf her children are older then I think it is more likely that Parliament will insist on Vicky's and Alice and their offspring being excluded - Victoria's reaction to that would be interesting but at the end it would be a Parliamentary decision.\n\nThere was an assasination attempt on Alfred Duke of Edinburgh in the 1860s that you could have succeed to remove him before his marriage.\n\nAnd at a push you could give Arthur haemophilia like his younger brother Leopold and get rid of them both at some point before their marriages.\n\nDepends when you get rid of the boys and how many of them.\n\nPossible effects:\n\nThe Queen was personally unpopular in the 1860s after her widowhood, the monarchy did enjoy a resurge in popularity at times particularly the popularity of the new Princess of Wales (Alix of Denmark).\n\nThe height of any republican feeling was in the late 60s early 70s but was mitigated by an assasination attempt on Victoria and the illness of the Prince of Wales (who nearly died from Typhoid fever).\n\nIt quickly subsided and the longevity of the Queen helped increase the popularity of the monarchy.\n\nNo illness for Edward and things might be different but there was no strong parliamentary support for a republic.\n\nNo Edward VII means a less anti-prussian feeling at the British Court in the decade before the First World War (though unlike many in his family George V was less ill-disposed to his cousin the Kaiser), Edward was a major proponent of the Entente Cordiale with France and was very popular in France, though Britain remained a guaranteur of Belgium's integrity of course, no Edward VII also means no Alix of Denmark (whose anti-prussian sentiment like that of her sister Marie of Russia influenced both of their husbands), Edward's distaste for his nephew Wilhelm II was marred by Wilhelm's difficult relationship with his parents and in particular his British mother, given his character his exclusion from the British succession may mar his view of Britain even more.\n\nFew points ref the Coburg Duchy.\n\nUnder the family pact - it was decided that in the event of Prince Albert's brother the Duke of Saxe Coburg Gotha dying without a male heir as looked extremely likely - Victoria and Albert's second son would succeed (to avoid the Duchy being ruled by the British King in personal union) - Alfred remained in the British Line of Succession (as his descendents do to this day).\n\nAffie's only son died shortly before his father after a scandal and much pressure was put on Victoria's younger children and grandchildren - who had unlike Affie - not been expected to succeed - the Duke of Connaught and his son were adamant in refusing and in the end it went to Charles Edward the teenaged son of Leopold Duke of Albany.\n\nI think if you exhaust the male descendants of Victoria and Albert - Coburg would have passed (through male primogeniture to the Portugeuse King descended from Prince Ferdinand Georg August of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and thence to the junior descendants of Ferdinand including the Bulgarian Royal family). So you would also have a succession crisis in the Duchy as well.\n\nIssue: of V and A:\n\n1)\n\nVictoria,Princess Royal, b 1840\n\nsurviving issue:\n\nWilhelm II, German Emperor,\n\nPrincess Charlotte m Bernhard III, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen\n\nPrince Henry m Princess Irene of Hesse and by Rhine\n\nPrincess Victoria married (1) Prince Adolf of Schaumburg-Lippe; he died 1916; no issue\n\nPrincess Sophie married Constantine I, King of the Hellenes; had issue\n\nPrincess Margaret married Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse\n\n2) Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII 1841\n\nsurviving issue:\n\nPrince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale d1892\n\nGeorge, Prince of Wales, later King George V m Princess Mary of Teck\n\nLouise, Princess Royal m Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife\n\nPrincess Victoria Never married\n\nPrincess Maud m Haakon VII of Norway\n\n3) Princess Alice, later Alice, Grand Duchess of Hesse 1843\n\nsurviving issue:\n\nVictoria married Prince Louis of Battenberg, later Marquess of Milford Haven\n\nElisabeth (kd 1918) m.
