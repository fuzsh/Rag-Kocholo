From the pomp and circumstance of Edward VII's marriage to Princess Alexandra of Denmark in 1863 to the relatively quiet nuptials of his great-great-great-grandson Peter Phillips to Autumn Kelly in 2008, here's what we can learn about the next royal wedding to take place at this historic venue.",

        "text": "While Queen Elizabeth's other children opted for large, formal weddings at Westminster Abbey and St. Paul's Cathedral in London, Edward and Sophie picked St. George's Chapel for its smaller size—it can only seat 800 people instead of 2,000 or more—a factor that also appears to fit into Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding plan.\n\nPer modern tradition, members of the royal family pose for pictures on the steps after the wedding ceremony. In this picture you can see a young Prince Harry with his cousin Princess Eugenie, in purple, who is also planning her wedding at St. George's Chapel for later in 2018.\n\nPresumably to avoid controversy over the heir to the throne marrying a divorcée in a religious ceremony, Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles had a civil ceremony at the Guildhall in Windsor and had their marriage blessed at a Service of Prayer and Dedication in the quire of St. George's Chapel on April 9, 2005.\n\nUnlike his father, Harry will be allowed to wed Markle in a religious ceremony at St. George's Chapel, even though she's been married before, presumably because he is not the heir to the throne. But like Camilla, Markle could opt to wear a non-white dress for her second wedding.\n\nPer tradition, the royal family sits on the right side of the quire at St. George's Chapel during wedding ceremonies and blessings.\n\nLater that day, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh threw a reception for Prince Charles and Camilla at Windsor Castle in St. George's Hall, the Grand Reception Room and Waterloo Chamber, which is reportedly where Harry and Meghan's reception will be held, too.\n\nFor the next several decades, the royal family favored Westminster Abbey as a wedding venue until Lady Helen Windsor, the daughter of the Duke of Kent, married Timothy Taylor on July 18, 1992 at St. George's Chapel.\n\nAlmost three decades before his own wedding at the same venue, a seven-year-old Prince Harry attended the wedding of his cousin, Lady Helen Windsor, with his mother, Princess Diana.\n\nOn May 17, 2008, Queen Elizabeth's eldest grandson, Peter Phillips, married Autumn Kelly at St. George's Chapel. While attendants at most British royal weddings tend to be children, the Canadian bride opted to have her new sister-in-law and two close friends as her bridesmaids, which means that Meghan Markle could also follow her lead.\n\nWhile Autumn Kelly is originally from Canada, she opted to wear a gown by British designer Sassi Holford and a tiara borrowed from her new mother-in-law Princess Anne. Even though Meghan Markle might break from tradition and wear a dress from a non-British designer, she's likely to borrow a tiara from the royal family jewels.\n\nQueen Victoria's eldest son, the future King Edward VII, married Princess Alexandra of Denmark on March 10, 1863 in the quire of St. George's Chapel in a ceremony attended by royals from Denmark, Prussia, and even the Maharajah of India. While Prince Harry and Meghan Markle may have a slightly less high-profile guest list, their ceremony will also take place in this part of the chapel.\n\nSt. George's Chapel was also a favorite wedding venue for Queen Victoria's other children, including her fourth daughter, Princess Louise, who married the future Duke of Argyll there on March 21, 1871.\n\nThe next royal wedding at St. George's Chapel happened eight years later on March 13, 1879 when Queen Victoria's third son, Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, married Princess Louise Margaret of Prussia.\n\nQueen Victoria's youngest son, Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany also had his wedding at St. George's Chapel when he married Princess Helen of Waldeck and Pyrmont on April 27, 1882.\n\nTwenty two years after her parents were married at St. George's Chapel, Princess Alice Mary of Albany married Prince Alexander of Teck at the same venue on February 10, 1904. Because the Duke of Albany died prematurely of haemophilia, Princess Alice's uncle, King Edward VII, walked her down the aisle and hosted a 14-course banquet for her afterward at St George’s Hall at Windsor Castle."
