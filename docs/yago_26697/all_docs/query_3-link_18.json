        "text": "Crown Princess of Sweden\n\nMargaret Victoria Charlotte Augusta Norah was born on 15 January 1882 at Bagshot Park and was the eldest daughter of Arthur, Duke of Connaught, and Louise Margaret of Prussia.\n\nMargaret, known as Daisy, was baptised in the Private Chapel of Windsor Castle on 11 March 1882 and her godparents were Queen Victoria (her paternal grandmother); Wilhelm I, German Emperor (her maternal great-granduncle); Victoria, German Crown Princess (her paternal aunt); Friedrich Karl of Prussia and Maria Anna of Anhalt-Dessau (her maternal grandparents); Augusta of Hesse-Kassel (Queen Victoria’s aunt); Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (her paternal uncle) and Charles of Prussia (maternal great-grandfather).\n\nMargaret and her younger sister, Patricia, were regarded as two of the most beautiful and eligible princesses in Europe, so their uncle, Edward VII, wanted them to make good marriages. After visits to the royal families in Spain and Portugal, it was expected both girls would marry into either family but it wasn’t to be as Margaret was destined to meet the love of her life in Cairo.\n\nThe future Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden met both sisters in Egypt, and while plans were underway for him to meet Patricia, he fell madly in love with Margaret and the feeling was mutual. Gustaf Adolf proposed to Margaret at a dinner held by Lord Cromer at the British Consulate in Egypt and she readily accepted. The couple were married on 15 June 1905 in St. George’s Chapel, at Windsor Castle, before moving on to Sweden in July.\n\nNeedless to say the union was a happy one and Gustaf Adolf loved his wife’s English ways as he had been raised by an austere Prussian mother who had put him under constant pressure to excel. Margaret was far more laid back but very supportive and she adapted to her new life in Sweden very easily. As soon as she arrived in the country, Margaret started to learn the Swedish language and asked to be educated in the culture and history. Eventually, she began taking incognito trips out into the country to see things for herself. Margaret also had a great love for gardening, and transformed the grounds of Sofiero Palace into beautiful English gardens. She later published two books on gardening with her own illustrations.\n\nIn 1907, Gustaf’s father ascended to the throne of Sweden, making Gustaf Adolf and Margaret, Crown Prince and Princess of Sweden. When war broke out in Europe, Margaret remained pro-British, despite her Swedish mother-in-law’s German proclivities, and took part in many fundraising efforts to equip the Swedish army. Margaret also acted as an intermediary for families seeking news of loved ones who were lost or wounded in battle. Margaret’s love for reform made her popular in her adopted country, and she is often credited with saving the Swedish monarchy.\n\nOn 1 May 1920, Margaret died suddenly of an infection after surgery while pregnant with her sixth child and was buried on Karslborg Island in her wedding dress and veil as per her wishes. Margaret’s untimely death came as a great shock to the British and Swedish Royal Families as the princess was a great favourite. It was also a particularly unhappy occasion for her father, the Duke of Connaught, as his beloved daughter died on his seventieth birthday."
