Born Princess Margaret of Connaught, she was the eldest daughter of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Princess Louise Margaret of Prussia, and a granddaughter of Queen Victoria. Her siblings were Prince Arthur of Connaught and Lady Patricia Ramsay. In 1905, she married Prince Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden, becoming the Crown Princess of Sweden in 1907. The couple had five children, Prince Gustaf Adolf, Prince Sigvard, Queen Ingrid of Denmark, Prince Bertil, and Count Carl Johan Bernadotte. Crown Princess Margareta gained a lot of popularity, and during WWI, she passed messages and laters between relatives on opposite sides. In 1920, she and her unborn sixth child died when an infection set in after she underwent mastoid surgery. Her widower married her first-cousin once removed, Lady Louise Mountbatten, and succeeded to the Throne in 1950. Crown Princess Margareta is the grandmother of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, and Queen Anne Marie of Greece among others.\n\nKhedive of Egypt Tiara | Egyptian Necklace"
