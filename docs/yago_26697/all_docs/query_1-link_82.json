And strictly speaking, Elizabeth married a Greek Prince in OTL. Who converted.\n\nWhile by that time lesser royals could and did marry nonroyalty (her parents for instance), it was still considered de riguer for the monarch and the heir to marry only royalty. One of the reasons why Philip was seen as suitable, its often forgotten but he was pretty high up in the Greek line of succession, no 2 at one point.\n\nSo I don't see a problem with her marrying into any family, conversions are easy and even German, with impeccable anti-Nazi credentials (like lots of ex-royals)\n\nPhilip remains in the Royal Navy, becomes First Sea Lord, and is the hero of the Falklands.

Instead of a divorce the prince consort dies in a polo match or boating accident. Phillip loses his wife (cancer, illnes, accident) . Lord Mountbatten helps Elizabeth after her husbands 'tragic' accident (There will be a LOT of stories about how the accident was planned) and she meets the widowed Phillip. The Press and public get entranced with this late romance and they are constantly seen together. They marry to public approval and live happily ever after.\n\nMovie and TV rights are currently available"
