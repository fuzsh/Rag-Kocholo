        "text": "They Called Her DaisyFinding a Grandmother\n\nPrinsessan Christina, Fru Magnuson\n\nPrincess Margaret of Connaught, grandchild of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and first wife of Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden, died in 1920. She was only 38 years old, very pregnant with her sixth child. She not only left the royal family paralyzed with sorrow—she was grieved by an entire nation. Why was this? And why was everything so hushed after her passing?\n\nPrincess Christina, sister of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, has searched through the private family archives for traces of her father’s mother. She has gone through letters, photo albums, and documents and traveled to see her cousin Queen Margrethe in Denmark to find out more. In They Called Her Daisy, she gives life and nuance to the kind-hearted and multi-talented British princess who fell madly in love with a Swedish prince in Cairo, was called the “ray of sunshine at Stockholm’s palace,” and brought modernity to the royal family in Sweden. She writes about her grandmother’s foresight and warm interest in and commitment to people, even far beyond her own circles, and she talks about her artistic talents and great interest in gardening. But she has also gained a deeper understanding of her grandfather, Gustav VI Adolf, seeing him first as a young man in love and later as freshly arrived in the role of Crown Prince. In conversation with her cousins Queen Margrethe and Princess Benedikte of Denmark, comprising a chapter in the richly illustrated book, the images gain even sharper contours.\n\nThe book is written in collaboration with Carl Otto Werkelid who has worked as a journalist and arts and culture writer since the early 1970s and was arts editor at Svenska Dagbladet for many years. He was also Cultural Counsellor at the Swedish Embassy in London."
