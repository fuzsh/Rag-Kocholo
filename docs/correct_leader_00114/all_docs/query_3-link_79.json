Many asked where is Pak Lah? He has dementia and that is why you do not see him in public anymore. It is a cruel condition. The body is there but the mind is not. He is wheelchair-bound. He cannot function normally anymore,\" New Straits Times quoted Khairy as saying.\n\nClick the link at @saysdotcomâ€™s bio to read the full article.\n\nImage credits: Abdullah Badawi (Facebook) & Malay Mail/Bernama\".",
