        "text": "This article proposes an analysis of changes implemented during Malaysia's Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi's administration (2003–09), using the theoretical framework commonplace in studies on conservatism. Based on the premise that transformations in conservative polities are prone to producing conflict, the dynamics of conflict situations during Abdullah's checkered Premiership is foregrounded. As we apply the main criteria defining conservatism to regime behaviour in Malaysia, it becomes clear that such criteria are stoutly held by the regime's elites in their quest for social harmony and political stability. Regime maintenance then finds justifications in such seemingly sublime ends, thereby self-perpetuating Malaysian conservatism. Such despondency prevailed during Mahathir Mohamad's administration (1981–2003), which displayed bias against changes and introduced schemes to justify the systems it upheld. Transmutations wrought during Abdullah's tenure may have been neither substantial nor totalizing, but within the conservative paradigm which had long gripped national politics, Abdullah's deviations were significant nevertheless.\n\n2 While BN assembles 14 race-based parties dominated by the United Malays National Organization (UMNO)-Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA)-Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC) triumvirate of the original Perikatan (Alliance) coalition of 1955, PR claims to pursue multi-racial goals despite the expressly different ideologies of its main component parties, viz. the People's Justice Party (PKR: Parti Keadilan Rakyat), the Democratic Action Party (DAP) and the Islamic Party of Malaysia (PAS: Parti Islam SeMalaysia).\n\n4 Among labels that have been used to describe the Malaysian state are ‘quasi-democracy’, in Ahmad, Zakaria, ‘Malaysia: Quasi-Democracy in a Divided Society’, in Diamond, Larry, Linz, Juan J., and Lipset, Seymour Martin (eds.), Democracy in Developing Countries: Volume Three, Asia (Boulder: Lynne Rienner Publishers, 1989), pp. 347–81Google Scholar; ‘semi-democracy’, in Case, William, ‘Semi-Democracy in Malaysia: Withstanding the Pressures for Regime Change’, Pacific Affairs, 66 (2) (1993): 183–205CrossRefGoogle Scholar; ‘statist-democracy’, in Jesudason, James J., ‘Statist Democracy and the Limits to Civil Society in Malaysia’, Journal of Commonwealth and Comparative Politics, 33 (3) (1995): 335–56CrossRefGoogle Scholar; ‘neither democratic nor authoritarian’, in Crouch, Harold, Government and Society in Malaysia (St Leonards, NSW: Allen & Unwin, 1996), pp. 12, 240Google Scholar; ‘soft authoritarianism’, in Means, Gordon P., ‘Soft Authoritarianism in Malaysia and Singapore’, Journal of Democracy, 7 (4) (1996): 103–17CrossRefGoogle Scholar; ‘restricted democracy’, in Munro-Kua, Anne, Authoritarian-Populism in Malaysia (London: Macmillan Press, 1996)CrossRefGoogle Scholar; ‘pseudodemocracy’, in Case, William, ‘Malaysia's Resilient Pseudodemocracy’, Journal of Democracy, 12 (1) (2001): 43–57CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n5 In the 1999 elections, the BN government, while maintaining its two-thirds parliamentary majority, experienced a widespread erosion of support as a result of the Reformasi (reformation) movement led by the sacked Deputy Prime Minister-cum-UMNO Deputy President Anwar Ibrahim. So wholesale were post-election developments wrought by the entrée of the Anwar-led Alternative Front (BA: Barisan Alternatif) into Malaysia's political arena that scholars have termed them as heralding an era of ‘new politics’. See for example Wah, Francis Loh Kok and Saravanamuttu, Johan (eds.), New Politics in Malaysia (Singapore: Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, 2003)Google Scholar.\n\n6 The concept of ‘dominant party’ is as outlined by Maurice Duverger: ‘it represents a whole epoch, when its ideas, its methods, its whole style are identical with those of an epoch. A ruling party is one that is believed to be one. Even the enemies of a dominant party, even citizens who do not vote for it, acknowledge its superior status and influence; they deplore it, but admit it’. See Duverger, Maurice, Political Parties: Their Organization and Activity in the Modern State (New York: Wiley, 1963), pp. 308–09Google Scholar. UMNO's role as the dominant single party in Malaysia is explored in Case, William, ‘New Uncertainties for an Old Pseudo-Democracy: The Case of Malaysia’, Comparative Politics, 37 (1) (2004): 83–104CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n14 See for example three important works which establish a relationship between conservatism and Asian Values, viz. Rodan, Garry, ‘The Internationalization of Ideological Conflict: Asia's New Significance’, The Pacific Review, 9 (3) (1996): 328–51CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Robison, Richard, ‘The Politics of “Asian Values”’, The Pacific Review, 9 (3) (1996): 309–27CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Jayasuriya, Kanishka, ‘Understanding “Asian values” as a Form of Reactionary Modernization’, Contemporary Politics, 4 (1) (1998): 77–91CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n45 Cf.

See the ‘Iranian Usage of “Neo-Conservatism”’, in Anoushiravan Ehteshami and Mahjoob Zweiri, Iran and the Rise of Its Neoconservatives: The Politics of Tehran's Silent Revolution (London: I.B. Tauris, 2007); and Bernard Gwertzman's interview with journalist Hossein Bastani, ‘The Fight between Iran's Neoconservatives and Conservatives’, 19 June 2008, http://www.cfr.org/publication/16598/fight_between_irans_neoconservatives_and_conservatives.html (accessed 28 October 2008).\n\n54 For the case of Soviet Union in this section, see Cohen, Stephen F., ‘The Friends and Foes of Change: Reformism and Conservatism in the Soviet Union’, Slavic Review, 38 (2) (1979): 187–202CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Nordlander, David, ‘Khrushchev's Image in the Light of Glasnost and Perestroika’, Russian Review, 52 (2) (1993): 248–64CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Tompson, W.J., ‘Khrushchev and Gorbachev as Reformers: A Comparison’, British Journal of Political Science, 23 (1) (1993): 77–105CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n55 For the case of China in this section, see Fewsmith, Joseph, ‘Neoconservatism and the End of the Dengist Era’, Asian Survey, 35 (7) (1995): 635–51CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Chan, Feng, ‘Order and Stability in Social Transition: Neoconservative Political Thought in Post-1989 China’, The China Quarterly, 151 (1997): 593–613Google Scholar; David Rolls, ‘The Emergence of the “Jiang Zemin Era”: Legitimacy and the Development of the Political Theory of “Neo-Conservatism” – 1989–1995’, Ph.D. dissertation (University of Southern Queensland, Australia, 2004).\n\n56 For the case of Japan in this section, see Pyle, Kenneth B., The Japanese Question: Power and Purpose in a New Era (Washington, DC: American Enterprise Institute Press, 1996), pp. 71–4Google Scholar; Sakakibara, Eisuke, Structural Reform in Japan: Breaking the Iron Triangle (Washington, DC: Brookings Institution, 2003), pp. xi–xiiiGoogle Scholar; Jim Frederick, ‘Standing Their Ground’, 25 April 2005, http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1053688,00.html (accessed 29 October 2010); Kollner, Patrick, ‘The Liberal Democratic Party at 50: Sources of Dominance and Changes in the Koizumi Era’, Social Science Japan Journal, 9 (2) (2006): 243–57CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Pempel, T.J., ‘Japanese Strategy Under Koizumi’, in Rozman, Gilbert, Togo, Kazuhiko, and Ferguson, Joseph P.

Zaid eventually resigned from his ministerial position in September 2008 in protest against recent arrests under the Internal Security Act (ISA). He later joined Anwar Ibrahim's PKR, which he also quit in disillusionment in 2010, and now heads a new party, People's National Well-Being Party (KITA: Parti Kesejahteraan Insan Tanah Air). See an account of his experience in UMNO and Abdullah's cabinet in I, Too, Am Malay (Petaling Jaya: ZI Publications, 2009).\n\n94 Ahmad Ismail earned notoriety in August 2008 for publicly calling the Chinese in Malaysia ‘migrants’. Ahmad Ismail's refusal to tender an apology for his statement caused a rift in Penang between UMNO and the Chinese-manjority GERAKAN party, which governed Penang from 1969 until 2008."
