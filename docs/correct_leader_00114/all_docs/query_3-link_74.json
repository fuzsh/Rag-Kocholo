        "text": "PETALING JAYA: Former prime minister Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi has been warded at the National Heart Institute (IJN) and is in stable condition.\n\nHis son-in-law Khairy Jamaludin said Abdullah was admitted after being diagnosed with spontaneous pneumothorax.\n\n“He is still in the critical care unit to be monitored by doctors and is in stable condition. Alhamdulillah, he is in good condition but in need of sufficient rest.\n\n“On behalf of the family, we appreciate prayers and well wishes for him, but IJN has advised that no visitors be allowed for the time being,” Khairy said in a statement yesterday.\n\nPrime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim extended his wishes and prayers to Abdullah.\n\n“May Tun Abdullah recover and regain good health soon. May all matters for him be eased,” said the Prime Minister in a Facebook post.\n\nFormer premier Datuk Seri Najib Razak also prayed for Abdullah’s swift recovery in a Facebook post.\n\n“It is understood that Pak Lah is currently at IJN for treatment and observation,” he said, referring to Abdullah’s popular name.\n\n“We pray that Allah SWT grants him (Abdullah) strength and recovery,” added Najib, who had served as Abdullah’s deputy from 2004 to 2009.\n\nAbdullah, 85, served as the country’s fifth prime minister from 2003 to 2009.\n\nHe resigned in 2009 and was replaced by Najib as prime minister.\n\nHe has kept a relatively low profile since.\n\nIn 2022, Khairy revealed that Abdullah was suffering from dementia and was unable to remember his family members anymore."
