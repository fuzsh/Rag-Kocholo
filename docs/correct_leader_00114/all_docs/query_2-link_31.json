        "text": "This article first appeared in The Edge Financial Daily, on November 1, 2016.\n\nTo mark the launch of the book Being Abdullah Ahmad Badawi: The Authorised Biography yesterday, veteran journalist Datuk Wong Sulong discussed the subject of his authorised biography, the fifth prime minister of Malaysia, in an exclusive email interview with The Edge Financial Daily.\n\nFD: How did this idea of writing the biography of Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi come about?\n\nWong: I have always wanted to write about Abdullah for a long time — in fact from the time he resigned as Malaysia’s fifth prime minister in April 2009. But the timing was not right then. Malaysians were still angry with him, after having given him the biggest mandate ever for a prime minister in the 2004 general election and he failed to deliver on the promises made. Many regarded him as a political failure. But I maintain that a nuanced, less emotive, assessment of him would return a different verdict. It was at a Hari Raya open house in September 2012 that I met Pak Lah (Abdullah) and before I could extend my hand in greeting, he asked aloud: “Sulong, when are you coming out with your second book?” As you know, my first book Notes to the Prime Minister: The untold story on how Malaysia beat the currency speculators was published in 2011 and was well received. I thought Pak Lah’s question was opportune. So a few days later, I went to see him at his office and proposed to do, with his authorisation and cooperation, a biography of him. He agreed without hesitation.\n\nFD: What are the defining features of Pak Lah’s premiership?\n\nWong: It was defined by mass euphoria (the 2004 general election) followed by a sharp reversal in fortune (the 2008 general election). After 22 years of authoritarian rule under Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysians warmly welcomed Abdullah and his promise of reforms. But he was too slow to deliver. He did try, and tried very hard, to allow Malaysians more democracy, fight corruption, reform the police force and return Malaysia to a system of checks and balances, which included reviving judicial independence. But there were powerful forces which were against these reforms, namely his Umno party, and conservatives within Malay society and the civil service. I agree with political observers who said Abdullah was handed the poisoned chalice. His cabinet, many of whom were from the Mahathir era, failed him. Abdullah admitted that it was his mistake to have kept so many of Mahathir’s ministers in his new cabinet after his massive election victory in 2004.\n\nFD: So what would you say was Abdullah’s legacy to Malaysia?\n\nWong: Abdullah left a substantial legacy. I am confident that his stature and legacy will expand with time. In retrospect, Malaysians now acknowledge that his relatively short rule was the springtime of Malaysian democracy. His firmness in ensuring that a smooth and peaceful handover of power in the five states won by the opposition in the 2008 general election marked him as a man of courage and principle. He would have nothing to do with those who suggested or wanted him to approve nefarious schemes on election night to deny the opposition power. He respected the will of the people as he respected the judgements of the court. He refused to intervene in the Federal Court’s decision that overturned the guilty verdict on Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim on the first sodomy charge, thereby allowing him to go free.\n\nPak Lah is a firm believer in democracy and the checks and balances that protect democracy. He allowed wide latitude for the press to operate, opened up public debate and encouraged judicial independence. Another of his legacy is the creation of an empowered Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC). It is interesting to note that the legal fraternity, which was one of the harshest critics of Abdullah when he was in power, is now the most appreciative towards what he had done for the country. On the economy, Abdullah’s “Five Corridors” (to promote regional growth) were visionary and a success, particularly the Iskandar Corridor. He also modernised agriculture, removing the stigma that it was “rice and mud”, calling it “New Agriculture” involving the application of technology and doubling of government allocation for the sector. He also pushed for Malaysia to be a global hub for halal food and financial services.\n\nFD: What reforms would Pak Lah have seen through if he had continued to lead Malaysia for the full second term?\n\nWong: Before handing over power to his successor, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak, Abdullah was desperately pushing for the following: i) the repeal of the Internal Security Act; ii) the creation of a Judicial Appointments Committee (JAC) to make the appointments of judges more transparent and allow wider representation in the appointments of judges; iii) an empowered MACC; and iv) the creation of the Independent Police Complaints and Misconduct Commission, or the IPCMC as it is popularly known.\n\nBecause he only had a few months left in his premiership, and because of the strong opposition to the above reforms from Umno ministers, Abdullah only managed to get a watered-down JAC and IPCMC in the form of the Enforcement Agency Integrity Commission. The MACC Bill was passed by Parliament. But one crucial element was missing: The power to prosecute remains with the attorney-general, not with the MACC.\n\nAbdullah gave a lot of emphasis on the 9th Malaysia Plan. Had he been allowed to see through his full term, he would ensure that targets in the 9th Malaysia Plan were achieved and that there would be a seamless transition from the ninth plan to the 10th plan.\n\nFD: What is Pak Lah’s prescription for building a secular Malaysia that gives prominence to Islam as the religion of the land?\n\nWong: The answer is his proponent of Islam Hadhari, translated to mean “civilisational Islam”. In essence, it is a progressive approach to Islam. Abdullah believes that Islam Hadhari is the template for a progressive, harmonious Malaysia, where its people can maximise their potential. Its 10 principles are: a) faith and piety in Allah; b) a just and trustworthy government; c) free and independent people; d) vigorous pursuit and mastery of knowledge; e) balanced and comprehensive economic development; f) good quality of life for the people; g) protection of the rights of minority groups and women; h) cultural and moral integrity; i) safeguarding of natural resources and the environment; and j) strong defence capabilities. Abdullah believes Islam Hadhari will not cause anxiety among any ethnic or religious groups while empowering Muslims to face the challenges of globalisation. While Pak Lah personally pushed hard to introduce Islam Hadhari, those in charge of its propagation and implementation were not up to it and the idea failed take root in the country.\n\nFD: How would Pak Lah have tackled the current economic, political and communal challenges?\n\nWong: When he handed power over to Najib, Abdullah said he would not interfere in the work of his successor and he had since repeated this on several occasions. Every leader has his/her own way of doing things and he/she should be allowed the freedom to tackle the problems that he/she is confronting. In that sense, Pak Lah would not offer any advice on how to tackle the current economic and political challenges unless he is asked by the current leader to do so, and then only in private.\n\nFD: You have spent a lot of time with Pak Lah while working on your book. How do you find the man?\n\nWong: Most politicians have a public and a private persona which can be very different. But Pak Lah has only one persona. He is what he is, in public or private. He is a very good man — humble, friendly and soft-spoken. He hates pretences, flattery and falsehoods. He is a devout Muslim who comes from a distinguished line of Islamic teachers, but his outlook is moderate and global. He is at ease with people of all faiths and colour. He is non-confrontational and is averse to speaking ill of others, even though they may be his political enemies. In collaborating on the book, he preferred not to be direct, and it took a while for me to understand what he was driving at. But it was great working with him. I learnt a lot from him and my respect and admiration for him can only grow with time. Datuk Zaid Ibrahim (former law minister) said it will be a while before Malaysia gets another leader like Pak Lah. I agree."
