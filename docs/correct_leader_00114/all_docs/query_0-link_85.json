        "text": "Former prime minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi is well and alive, a statement from his office said today, quashing another round of online rumors claiming that he is dead.\n\nHis representatives refuted the rumor and threatened to take legal action after a social media post stating that the fifth prime minister had died this morning went viral. Abdullah, also known as Pak Lah, became prime minister from 2003 to 2009 and has been away from the political spotlight for several years.\n\n“The Office will take legal action against those spreading fake news. It is also hoped that members of the public can verify the information they receive with the relevant authorities before spreading it in order to avoid confusion,” the statement read\n\nAbdullah, who turns 82 this year, is in good health, it added.\n\nSimilar rumors circulated in August last year after an article said that Abdullah had died, prompting a special officer of the former political leader to lodge a police report. No further action was taken by police, citing a lack of ill-intent by the author. The incident was also seen as a case of miscommunication.\n\nOther stories:"
