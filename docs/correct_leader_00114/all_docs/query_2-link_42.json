        "text": "Four main parties are\n\ninvolved in the Malysian election [EPA]\n\nThe Malaysian election pits the long-ruling Barisan Nasional coalition party of Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, the prime minister, against three main opposition parties.\n\nThese are the Democratic Action Party (DAP), the Islamist party Parti Islam se-Malaysia (PAS) and the Keadilan party (PKR) of Anwar Ibrahim, the former deputy premier.\n\nThe key question may not be who will win, as Abdullah is expected to easily sail to re-election, but whether or not the balloting will be free and fair and if the country’s more than 10 million registered voters will turn out.\n\nWide-spread reports of “phantom voter lists” coupled with a virtual media blackout of opposition candidates has raised speculation that disaffected Malaysians may opt out all together.\n\nIt is against this backdrop that Abdullah joins the programme.\n\nWe will ask him about rising prices, growing ethnic tensions and whether or not he can maintain a crucial two-thirds parliamentary majority.\n\nWatch this episode of Riz Khan on YouTube\n\nWatch this episode of Riz Khan Street Talk on YouTube\n\nThis episode of Riz Khan aired on Thursday, March 6, 2008\n\nYou can watch Riz live at 1900GMT, with repeats at 0030GMT, 0500GMT, and 1000GMT.\n\nTo contact us click on ‘Send your feedback’ at the top of the page\n\nWatch Al Jazeera English programmes on YouTube"
