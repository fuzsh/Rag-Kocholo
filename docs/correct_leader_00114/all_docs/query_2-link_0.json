        "text": "Abdullah Ahmad Badawi (born Nov. 26, 1939, Kampung Perlis, British Straits Settlements colony [now Penang, Malaysia]) is a Malay politician who was the prime minister of Malaysia (2003–09).\n\nIn 1964 Abdullah graduated with a B.A. (with honours) in Islamic studies from the University of Malaya. He then joined the Malayan civil service. He served on the National Operation Council, which exercised executive power during a nationwide state of emergency (1969–70). In 1971 he moved to the Ministry of Culture, Youth, and Sports. He resigned from the civil service in 1978 and campaigned successfully for election to the federal parliament. Also in 1978 he received his first administrative appointment in the Federal Territory Ministry. Under Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad, Abdullah served as minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (1981–84), as well as minister of education (1984–86) and defense (1986–87). In 1991 he was appointed minister of foreign affairs, a position he held until 1999, when Mahathir named him deputy prime minister and minister of home affairs.\n\nOn Oct. 31, 2003, Mahathir stepped down, and Abdullah, his handpicked successor, became Malaysia’s fifth prime minister. Abdullah received a surprisingly strong personal mandate in general elections held on March 21, 2004. Gains by his party, the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), demonstrated widespread support for Abdullah in the ethnically and religiously diverse country. He vowed to attack poverty and to eliminate the cronyism and corruption that had been bywords of Mahathir’s long tenure. In September 2004 the Malaysian High Court’s unanticipated release of Anwar Ibrahim, the former deputy prime minister who had been imprisoned on questionable charges since 1998, resolved one of the most troubling legacies of the Mahathir era and brought praise for Abdullah’s housecleaning efforts.\n\nMoving with quiet authority on the international stage, in January 2004 Abdullah initiated a rapprochement with neighbouring Singapore, seeking to end decades of territorial bickering; relations between the two countries, however, remained tense. Later that year Abdullah vehemently denied U.S. Pres. George W. Bush’s allegation that Malaysia was trafficking in nuclear secrets. After fighting broke out between Israeli and Hezbollah forces in Lebanon in 2006, Abdullah condemned the international community’s “paralysis” in dealing with the crisis. He later sent 360 troops to join the international peacekeeping force in Lebanon."
