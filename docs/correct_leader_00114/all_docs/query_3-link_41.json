        "text": "Commentary\n\nMalaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi spelt out his vision of Islam Hadhari or Civilisational Islam in his speech to the UMNO General Assembly on 23 Sept 04. Significantly, he put this in the context of the Malay community’s struggle for independence and development, with an emphasis on enhancing the quality of life. This would be achieved through the acquisition of knowledge, the development of the individual and the nation and the establishment of a dynamic economic, trading and financial system. Such a balanced development would produce an ummah or community of knowledgeable and pious people with noble values like honesty and trustworthiness, and who would be able to take on global challenges.\n\nIslam Hadhari, as Prime Minister Abdullah saw it, would aim to achieve ten principles, ranging from faith and piety in God and a just and trustworthy government to the protection of the rights of minority groups and women, the need for strong defences and a balanced development. Being pro-development, Islam Hadhari, PM Abdullah said, would be capable of building up Malay competitiveness as well. To this end, he urged the Malays to use the glorious heritage of Islamic civilisation in all aspects to inspire them to achieve prosperity.\n\nNot Just Good Governance\n\nWhile Islam Hadhari may appear to the layman a code for good governance and the tenets of a progressive society dressed in Islamic terms, a closer scrutiny of what PM Abdullah said would reveal that his concept goes beyond the idea of good, clean and competent governance. It could well be a paradigm of how Malaysian Muslims should see Islam in the context of a multi-racial Malaysia facing a changing world. Considering the sensitivity of the non-Muslim community towards the increasing ‘Islamisation’ of Malaysia, PM Abdullah seemed to want to reassure them by emphasising his vision for Malaysian Muslims to focus more on Islamic values as well as personal and economic development rather than on the notion of an Islamic state. Not only does his pronouncement of Islam Hadhari seek to ease non-Muslim anxiety and maintain their support for the national ruling coalition, the Barisan Nasional, PM Abdullah’s message was clearly also targeted at his Muslim constituents. They were assured that Islam Hadhari was neither a new religion nor a new mazhab (denomination), but an effort to bring the Ummah (Islamic community) back to the fundamentals of the Quran and the Hadith – the Traditions of the Prophet Muhammad — which formed the foundation of Islamic civilisation.\n\nFrom one perspective, Islam Hadhari could be seen as an extension of former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad’s policy of ‘penerapan nilai-nilai Islam’ (inculcation of Islamic values). But from another, it could also be interpreted as a reaction to PAS’ blueprint for Negara Islam (Islamic state), launched before the last general election. Muslim scholars say it is difficult to fault the concept of Islam Hadhari as propounded by PM Abdullah from the theological point of view. Indeed many Islamists would see the premier as having co-opted their rhetoric. However the Islamists could still point to two main issues that remained unclear: How Islam Hadhari can help establish Malaysia as an Islamic state and how it can facilitate the implementation of Syariah or Islamic law as the law of the country."
