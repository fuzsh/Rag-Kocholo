        "text": "Prime Minister of Malaysia Abdullah Badawi (back translation): I would like to wish you a sincere welcome and also welcome the members of your delegation.\n\nWe are looking forward with interest to your continued participation in this, our first Russia-ASEAN summit. I can say already that I am happy with the discussions we have held. These discussions once again underscore the importance of expanding and deepening relations between Russia and ASEAN and giving them concrete substance.\n\nI am sure that our officials will implement the agreements that we reach during our bilateral work in the various different areas of our cooperation.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin: I would like to thank you for the warm welcome we have always received in Malaysia.\n\nOur trade and economic relations are growing quite rapidly. Our bilateral trade has increased by 64 percent. In terms of volume our bilateral trade is not so big, but it is growing at a very good pace, at an impressive rate.\n\nWe are grateful to your country for your support of Russia’s participation as an observer in the Organisation of the Islamic Conference. On behalf of all Russia’s Moslems – and there are more than 15 million Moslems in Russia – I would like to thank you for this support.\n\nI hope that our meeting today will also give a good impetus to developing our relations.\n\nAllow me to renew our invitation to visit the Russian Federation next year. We hope to be able to receive you at a time that will be convenient for you.\n\nAbdullah Badawi: Thank you."
