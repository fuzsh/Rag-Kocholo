The statement indicates that Russia and Malaysia share the same opinion on many international and regional problems.\n\nIn addition, the President of Russia and the Prime Minister of Malaysia confirmed that they are in favour of active participation by the international community in resolving the situation in the Middle East and restoring talks between Israel and Arab countries.\n\nThe leaders of Russia and Malaysia emphasised how complex the situation concerning the Iranian nuclear programme is. However, they are of the opinion that all Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty member countries, including Iran, have the right to conduct research into using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.\n\nFollowing their talks Vladimir Putin and Abdullah Ahmad Badawi made press statements.\n\nVladimir Putin said that Russia and Malaysia consider developing investment cooperation, and particularly with respect to the fuel and energy sector, to be a priority for their bilateral cooperation. Military-technical cooperation in high-tech and space exploration also has important potential.\n\nRussia's head of state noted that the Russian-Malaysian negotiations served to confirm how close the two countries' positions on key international issues are."
