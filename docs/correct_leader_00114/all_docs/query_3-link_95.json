        "text": "Politics bores many people but one would at least expect a prime minister to be interested.\n\nHowever, days before a general election, the Malaysian PM, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, has been accused of dozing off in cabinet meetings and political gatherings.\n\nAnti-government websites are circulating pictures of the politician yawning or sitting with his head bowed and eyes closed in various high-level political sessions.\n\nOpposition politicians have urged voters to reject Abdullah's bid to retain office in the election on Saturday, citing the photographs as evidence of a weak and failing leader who has allowed corruption, crime and racial and religious tensions to mount.\n\nThe embarrassing pictures, however, are unlikely to hurt the incumbent's chances of re-election for another five-year term, as opposition parties struggle to match his National Front party's spending power.\n\nAbdullah today denied claims that he snoozed through important meetings.\n\n\"We are not asleep, for we are working,\" Abdullah was quoted as saying by the national news agency, Bernama."
