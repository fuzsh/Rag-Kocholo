        "text": "On May 30, 2005, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) Wu Bangguo who was paying an official good-will visit to Malaysia met with Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi in the prime minister's palace.\n\nWu said the friendly relations of cooperation between China and Malaysia have withstood the test of time and the changes in international situation over the past 31 years since the establishment of bilateral diplomatic ties, which has become a common fortune for both peoples. The two countries have trusted and supported each other politically and pursued common economic development through mutually beneficial cooperation. With increasingly active exchanges and cooperation in various fields, bilateral relations have been uplifted continuously. China and Malaysia have maintained coordination and cooperation in international and regional affairs. In particular, they have conducted good cooperation in promoting the development of the relationship between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and safeguarding the legitimate rights of developing countries. Wu said China attaches great importance to China-Malaysia relations, adding that his current visit is aimed to further expand the strategic cooperation between the two countries in an all-round way.\n\nBadawi said Wu's visit to Malaysia is a major visit by Chinese leaders to Malaysia and is of great importance to promoting bilateral relations. The recent years have witnessed closer governmental, parliamentary, local and civil exchanges and enhanced political, economic and humanity exchanges between the two countries. He pledged Malaysia would make utmost efforts to expand and deepen bilateral ties.\n\nThe two sides also had an in-depth exchange of views on common development in the South China Sea, reforms of the United Nations, the East Asia Summit and the security issues concerning the Strait of Malacca.\n\nVice Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee and other officials attended the meeting.\n\nLater that evening, Malaysia-China Friendship Association and other nine civil societies in Malaysia held a grand banquet to welcome Chairman Wu and his wife's visit to Malaysia and celebrate the 31st anniversary of the establishment of bilateral diplomatic ties. Malaysian artists' wonderful performances during the banquet gave an amiable and friendly atmosphere to the evening."
