After almost a year in office, Abdullah has succeeded in emanating a ‘feel good’ social environment as reported in the media. This paper looks at the discourse mobilized to introduce a new concept, Islam Hadhari, by the new leadership. Its interest lies in the construction of discourse and ideology that manifests. The theoretical framework adopted is ideological discourse analysis as proposed by van Dijk (2004). Some comparison will also be made with the discourse produced by the previous UMNO president.",
