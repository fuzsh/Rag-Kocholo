Malaysian leaders and scholars understood Islam not only in terms of Malaysian national politics and culture but also within the context of international relations. Abdullah, the head of the ruling party, United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), and the former chairman of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), repeatedly promoted Islam as the religion of peace and described Malaysia as “peaceful, stable, democratic, and rapidly developing”.1 Abdullah’s government claimed that they endorsed non-confrontation with Western, non-Muslim countries, and sought cooperation with both Muslim and non-Muslim governments, particularly on issues addressing economic development, scientific advancement, and global security."
