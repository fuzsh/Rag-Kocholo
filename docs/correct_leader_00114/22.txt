Malaysia’s Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi has replaced Mahathir Mohamad, who ruled the country in an increasingly authoritarian manner from 1981 until 2003. Abdullah has a reputation as a reformer who is personally incorruptible, and midway through his first term in office, Malaysian civil and political liberties have improved marginally.
