        "text": "Victor lvi'iii.liiuel It., King of Italy, is dead.\n\nPining tlii.ee d.iys he suffered from fever ; and\n\nall the :iid which could he rendered by his physicians\n\nproved unavailing. The surgeons perfoimed\n\nthe operation of blood-lettinir. His\n\niVIajesty received the last Sacrament. Ilis Holiness\n\nthe Pope sent two Chamberlains with a\n\nI'apal benediction, and stating that had it not\n\nbeen for his own illness he would have gone him-\n\n»;lf to visit the Kiujr.\n\nA general mourning has been proclaimed\n\nthroughout llaly.\n\nPrince Huruoert has heen proclaimed.\n\nSome uneasiness is felt in coiiseouencc of the\n\nbelief that the newly proclaimed monarch entertains\n\nvery different political opinions from those\n\nwhich were held by the late King of Italy.\n\nThe following is from AI en of the Time :—\n\n1 1 Victor Emmanuel, King of Italy, son of\n\nCharles Albert, King of Sardinia, and of Queen\n\nTheresa, daughter of Grand Duke Ferdinand of\n\nTuscany, was horn March 14, 1820, and received\n\nat his baptism the names Marie-Alhert-Eugene-\n\nFerilinand-Thoinas-Victor-Emmanuel. He was\n\ncarefully educated in science and military tactics,\n\nand married in April 12, 1842. the Archduchess\n\nAdelaide of Austria, who died January 20. 18.55.\n\nHe took an active part, as Duke of Savoy, in the\n\nevents of 1848, accompanying his father to the\n\nfield, and- behaving with great bravery at the\n\nbattles of Goi'to and ^iovara. On the evening\n\nafter the latter (March 24,1849), Charles Albert\n\nsigned his abdication in the Bellini Palace.\n\nLittle was then known of his sou and successor,\n\nwho assumed the title Victor Emmanuel II., except\n\nthat he was a dashing hunter, somewhat\n\nhaughty, and a reputed opponent of Liberalism.\n\nHe succeeded in obtaining from Austria terms\n\nless humiliating than those imposed on hia father,\n\nbut the treaty of peace was not signed till August,\n\n1849. On mountiug the throne of Sardinia he\n\nendeavoured to reorganise the finances, the\n\narmv, and the system of public instruction, concluded\n\nwith England several treaties ot commerce,\n\nestablished railways, and promoted free\n\ntrade. He indignantly refused the offer made\n\nby Austria for the cession of Parma, provided he\n\nwould abolish the Constitution. Genoa having\n\nrevolted, and expelled Ilia garrison, lie sent an\n\narmy against it, recovered his former rights, and\n\nhis efforts for the prosperity of his kingdom were\n\ngenerally successful, lie had, however, one\n\ngreat struggle throughout his rein with the court\n\nand clnrgy of Rome. Guided by Ccunt Oavour,\n\nhe confiscated much church property, and took\n\naway many clerical privileges. He concluded in\n\nJanuary, 1855, a convention with France and\n\nEngland, to take part in the war against Russia,\n\nand despatched to the Crimea an army of 17,000\n\nmen, under General I>e La Marmora, which distinguished\n\nitself by a victory on the banks of the\n\nTchernaya.
