        "text": "Adelaide of Austria (Adelheid Franziska Marie Rainera Elisabeth Clotilde; 3 June 1822 – 20 January 1855) was the first wife of Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia, future King of Italy. She was the mother of eight children including the future Umberto I of Italy. She was the Queen of Sardinia from 1849 until 1855.\n\nThe present Italian pretender is her direct great great grandson.\n\nBiography\n\nArchduchess of Austria\n\nShe was born at the Royal Palace of Milan to Rainer Joseph of Austria and his wife Elisabeth of Savoy. Named Adelaide, or known as Adele in the family, she held the title of Archduchess of Austria. Her father was the Viceroy of Lombardy-Venetia and was a son of the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II and Maria Luisa of Spain. Her mother was a member of the House of Savoy and a daughter of the then Prince of Carignano, the head of the junior branch of the House of Savoy who ruled the Kingdom of Sardinia.\n\nDuchess of Savoy\n\nOn 12 April 1842, at the Palazzina di caccia di Stupinigi, she married Victor Emmanuel of Savoy. The marriage was used to strengthen relations between the House of Savoy and that of the House of Habsburg but was viewed by many people of the time to increase Austrian power in Italy.\n\nVictor Emmanuel was her first cousin and heir apparent to the King of Sardinia. He was styled the \"Duke of Savoy\" prior to succession. Adelaide thus took on the style of \"Duchess of Savoy\". She maintained her style of Imperial & Royal Highness till she became Queen.\n\nHer husband's mother Maria Theresa of Austria had great influence over her son throughout his life. Her mother-in-law was also her first cousin, both she and Adelaide being grandchildren of Emperor Leopold II. Adelaide and her husband of thirteen years had eight children.\n\nAdelaide was a quiet and religious woman and had had a strict upbringing, she was a loving wife and frequently would give to charity.\n\nQueen of Sardinia\n\nIn March 1849 her father-in-law King Charles Albert abdicated after the events of the Revolutions of 1848. Her husband succeeded as Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia.\n\nDuring her time as queen consort she had three further children all of which died in infancy. On 8 January 1855 she gave birth to a son who was styled the \"Count of Genevois\".\n\nDays later Queen Maria Theresa died on 12 January 1855. Adelaide went to the late queens funeral on 16 January and returning to the palace caught a cold. She died four days later at the Royal Palace of Turin having had an acute attack of Gastroenteritis.\n\nShe was buried at the Royal Basilica of Superga.\n\nIn 1861 her husband would become the first post-unification King of Italy. Her husband wed again to Rosa Vercellana.\n\nTitles and honors\n\n3 June 1822 – 12 April 1842 Her Imperial and Royal Highness Archduchess Adelaide of Austria\n\n12 April 1842 – 23 March 1849 Her Imperial and Royal Highness The Duchess of Savoy\n\n23 March 1849 – 20 January 1855 Her Majesty The Queen of Sardinia\n\nDame of the Order of the Starry Cross\n\nImages for kids\n\nArchduchess Adelaide as queen-consort\n\nSee also"
