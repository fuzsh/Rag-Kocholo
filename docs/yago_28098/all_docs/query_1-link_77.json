        "text": "Modern Italian Monarchy: Victor Emanuel III (1900-46)\n\nVictor Emmanuel III (1869-1947) was the grandson of Victor Emmanuel II. He was born in Naples. I have no details on his childhood or the clothes he wore as a boy. He married Princess Elena, daughter of King Nicholas of Montenegro. The eldest son was Umberto. His children appear to have worn sailor suits as boys, but no other information is available. He became king of Italy in 1900 on the assassination of his father, King Umberto I. He reigned as King of Italy from 1900 until 1946. Italy acquired Libya in 1912 after a war with the Ottoman Empire. Although it was allied with Germany and Austria-Hungary, Italy entered World War I on the side of the Allies in 1915. He decided in 1915 to join the Allies in World War I. Benito Mussolini became prime minister of Italy in 1922 and rapidly assumed dictatorial powers. Following the collapse of parliamentary government, Victor Emmanuel accepted the Fascist regime ofBenito Mussolini. During Mussolini's Fascist regime Victor Emmanuel was king in name only. Necertheless, the King's role in Mussolini's Government was to eventually doom the monarchy in Italy. The Lateran Treaty normalized relations between Italy and the Vatican in 1929. although he gained the titles Emperor of Ethiopia (1936) and King of Albania (1939). Italy entered World War II having previously formed an alliance with Germany. The War was a disaster for Italy and Italian forces recorded a steady series of defeats in North Africa, Ethiopia, Albania, Greece, and Sicily. Italian units were desimated on the Eastern Front by the Soviets. Italy surrendered to invading Allied forces in 1943, but Germany took control of the country and fought the Allies until the end of the war. After the fall of Rome in 1944, the king withdrew from public life and abdicated in favor of his son, Crown Prince Umberto in 1946 after World War II.\n\nParents\n\nVictor Emmanuel III (1869-1947) was the grandson of Victor Emmanuel II. His parents were Humbert I (1844- ) and Margaret Adelaide (1851- ).\n\nChildhood\n\nVictor Emmanuel was born in Naples. I have no details on his childhood or the clothes he wore as a boy.\n\nMarriage\n\nHe married Princess Elena, daughter of King Nicholas I (1841- ) of Montenegro and Milena Vukotic (1847- ).\n\nChildren\n\nThe royal couple had four children: Yolanda (1901- ), Mafalda Maria Elizabeth (1902- ), Umberto II (1904- ), and Giovanna (1907- ). The only son was Umberto. As heldest son he had the title of Prince of Savoy meaning crown prince. Giovanna married King Boris III of Bulgaria. The children like many European royals wore sailor suits.\n\nAccession\n\nVictor Emmanuel became king of Italy in 1900 on the assassination of his father, King Umberto I. He reigned as King of Italy from 1900 until 1946. Italy acquired Libya in 1912 after a war with the Ottoman Empire.\n\nWorld War I\n\nAlthough it was allied with Germany and Austria-Hungary in the Triple Alliance, Italy refrained from joining them when World War broke out (Ahust 1914). The Italians claimed that the Tripple Alliance was a defensive alliance. Both Central Powers and the Allies attempted to draw Italy into the War. Italy was a constututional monarchy, but King Victor Emanuel had great influence. Prime Minister Antonio Salandra signed treaties with the Allies to bring Italy into the War (1915). War was so unpopular with the Italuan people that the Italian Chamber of Deputies rejected Primeminister Salandra, forecing him to resign. The King refused to accept Salandra's resignation and personslly made the decision to delare war on the Central Powers. Italy declared war (May 23,1915). Prime Minister Salandra invoked Italy's Sacro Egoismo (sacred self-interest). The War proved to be much more costly in men amaterial than the King or Primeminister Salandra had anticipated. THe King refused to accept responsibility and blamed the losses on mismanagement by the Government.\n\nBenito Mussolini\n\nBenito Mussolini became prime minister of Italy in 1922 and rapidly assumed dictatorial powers. Following the collapse of parliamentary government, Victor Emmanuel accepted the Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini. During Mussolini's Fascist regime Victor Emmanuel was king in name only. Nevertheless, the King's role in Mussolini's Government was to eventually doom the monarchy in Italy. The Lateran Treaty normalized relations between Italy and the Vatican in 1929. although he gained the titles Emperor of Ethiopia (1936) and King of Albania (1939).\n\nWorld War II\n\nItaly entered World War II having previously formed an alliance with Germany.
