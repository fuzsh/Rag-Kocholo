        "text": "Executive Councillor James Tien Pei-chun yesterday said he would clarify his declaration of interests after questions were raised on whether he had flouted rules covering cabinet ministers.\n\nThe Liberal Party chairman told the South China Morning Post he was in the process of stating which of his firms held properties and where they were.\n\nMr Tien had listed 43 companies in which he has shares, according to declarations of interest of top officials made public on Monday. But unlike his colleagues, he did not state whether the firms owned any properties.\n\nHe listed nothing in the property section of his declaration, although one of his companies holds a house in Barker Road.\n\n'I'd better err on the side of safety,' Mr Tien said yesterday, adding he had sought advice from the Exco secretariat on his declarations after questions earlier this week about his holdings. He said he would list all the properties his companies owned.\n\nOn Tuesday, he insisted that he had not omitted anything from his list. He said 'it was a fact' that he did not hold any properties in his own name, but he confirmed that his Barker Road residence was owned by a company that he holds. He said he had made the same declaration as a legislator since the early 1990s and had never run into problems.\n\nThe Democratic Alliance for Betterment of Hong Kong vice-chairman, Ip Kwok-him, who is chairman of a subcommittee set up to scrutinise the ministerial system, has said that while Mr Tien had nothing wrong, his declaration of interests may be misleading.\n\nUnder the rules, cabinet members should disclose properties held in their names, as well as those held by companies or other bodies if the member actually owns the companies, or has a beneficial interest in them. It is, however, not necessary to provide detailed addresses of the properties.\n\nLast night, a spokeswoman for the Exco secretariat said: 'All the bureau heads have acted in accordance with the criteria when declaring their interests. There is no question of them declaring more than required or acting superfluously.'"
