        "text": "Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien Puk-sun accused the MTR Corporation today of making poor decisions about bonuses for two of its former senior executives, saying they paid one too much, and ‘unfairly’ slashed payments to another, RTHK reported.\n\nThe railway revealed in its annual report yesterday that former projects director Philco Wong Nai-keung was given HK$400,000 in performance-related bonuses last year – down by 75 percent from what he pocketed in 2017.\n\nRetired chief executive Lincoln Leong Kwok-kuen got HK$700,000 – an almost 85 percent cut from the previous year.\n\nTien, who once served as chairman of the KCRC, said Wong deserved most of the blame over an ongoing construction scandal at the Hung Hom station of the troubled Sha Tin-to-Central Link.\n\nThe construction has been plagued by allegations of substandard work and missing documents, and Wong had quit last August after the government demanded heads to roll over the scandal.\n\nTien said given that Wong had only worked for seven months last year, and he seems to “know nothing” about what his subordinates were doing, he should have received no bonus at all.\n\nBut the lawmaker said cuting Leong’s bonus appears to be a political decision.\n\n“The recent scandal has nothing to do with operation or financial mismanagement. It has everything to do with… the Sha Tin-to-Central link,” he said.\n\n“I think it’s unfair to hold the CEO accountable in terms of slashing his bonus even more than the projects director. I think the decision on the CEO’s package reduction is probably a very political one,” Tien added."
