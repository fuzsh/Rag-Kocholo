        "meta_description": "Before police in riot gear fired rounds of tear gas at unarmed protesters on September 28, few could have expected that the siege of the government headquarters would turn the scripted Occupy Central (zhanling zhonghuan 佔領中環) into Hong Kong’s biggest and most unprecedented pro-democracy movement amidst its electoral reforms. In the next two‑and-a-half months, protesters of what became the Umbrella Movement (yusan yundong 雨傘運動) would occupy major roads in the city’s busiest districts, set up t...",

        "text": "From Occupy Central to the Umbrella Movement\n\n6However, two spontaneous events turned the scripted movement into an improvised mass protest that surpassed imagination. The first was the attempt to “recapture Civic Square” (chongduo gongmin guangchang 重奪公民廣場), the government office’s forecourt, which was blocked off by fences after the anti-national education movement (fanguojiao yundong 反國教運動) was staged in 2012. On the night of 26 September, a group of students climbed over the metal fences and stormed the empty forecourt, claiming that the space belonged to the public. The students were swiftly surrounded and arrested by the police, but the move dramatically backfired. The next day, thousands of angry protesters swamped the government headquarters shouting for the release of the arrested student leaders along with slogans for genuine universal suffrage. The unexpected mobilisation around the government offices motivated OCLP leaders to launch the movement ahead of its proposed schedule, and also at a different location – Admiralty instead of Central.\n\n8What became of the original Occupy Central movement was an improvised 79-day occupation of Admiralty, Causeway Bay, and Mong Kok, jointly led by the Hong Kong Federation of Students, Scholarism, and OCLP. Each occupied district developed its own characteristics: Admiralty for its distinct middle-class character with strong student and civic group involvement, Mong Kok for its grassroots and triad involvement, and Causeway Bay for its popularity with tourists. All of them became self-sufficient communities that protesters referred to as “villages” (cun 村), filled with art installation and makeshift structures such as camps, study areas, and supply stations, in which protesters pressed on for a genuine universal suffrage. Nevertheless, although the movement amplified protesters’ democratic yearnings and will likely give rise to a more politically active populace, it has raised at least two issues that will continue to be controversial and divisive, especially in light of the absence of any concessions from the Hong Kong government or Beijing.\n\nTwo conceptions of the rule of law\n\n23 Michael Davis, “Occupy protests breaking law, but not undermining Hong Kong’s rule of law,” SCMP, 7 (...)\n\nIt is important here to distinguish between breaking the law and undermining the rule of law. The non-violent protesters have clearly broken the law by not complying with the Public Order Ordinance and, further, by not clearing those areas covered by court orders. Both are purposeful law-breaking in furtherance of a non-violent civil disobedience campaign. We should bear in mind that civil disobedience by definition involves breaking the law in support of a higher ideal that is the aim of the civil disobedience campaign.\n\n14Davis put forward the view that governments are more likely to harm the rule of law:\n\n24 Ibid.\n\nBy putting the Standing Committee above the law and redefining basic human rights guarantees in an unrecognisable manner, the State Council and the Standing Committee have put Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy and rule of law in jeopardy. The failure of the local government to guard Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy and its seemingly complicit role in the Standing Committee’s decision implicates it as well.\n\n17This brings out two conceptions of the rule of law at odds with each other. For critics of the Occupy movement, rule of law is closer to rule by law. Under such a conception, the law must be obeyed under all circumstances, and a breach of the legal code will harm the rule of law. For supporters, the rule of law is more than just the absolute obedience to law. Rather, the law can be challenged through civil disobedience, that is, by breaking unjust laws while bearing the legal consequences. Nevertheless, these conflicting views eventually came to an abrupt end as the police cleared the last protest site in Causeway Bay on 15 December. Chief Executive C.Y. Leung declared the “illegal occupation” over and urged Hong Kong to pursue “democracy with the rule of law” – but the debate on the legality of the Occupy protest and the rule of law remained unresolved.\n\nMainland-Hong Kong constitutional relations\n\nConclusion\n\n24Despite the uncertain impact of the Occupy movement, the 79-day occupation has significantly transformed Hong Kong politics. Not only will the Hong Kong populace – especially the younger generation – become more politically active, they will also adopt novel, and more radical, means of protest to reiterate demands for universal suffrage and to push for greater autonomy. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the Umbrella Movement did not resolve the problems that contributed to its emergence in the first place; on many levels, as is shown by this article through the debate on the rule of law and Hong Kong’s constitutional relations with China, the movement has deepened the social rift, leaving the city with a more fragmented and divided society and less room for compromise over disagreements. In combination, these factors will likely give rise to more complex and confrontational state-society relations in the post-Occupy era.\n\n25“It’s just the beginning,” read a large yellow banner hung by protesters hours before the Admiralty protest camps were cleared. Indeed, the beginning of an uncertain future as well."
