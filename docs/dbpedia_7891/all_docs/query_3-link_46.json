        "text": "In recent months, the capacity of roasted beans processed at our factory has always been about 50 tons per month to supply the domestic market and a small amount for export in the high-end segment. However, at present, as more and more distributors inside and outside the region know about VCU, the number of orders from the factory is getting larger and larger. To meet the growing market demand, today VCU installed an additional roasting machine with a capacity of 60kg per batch with hot-air technology, increasing the monthly roasting capacity of beans to 100 tons in just 8 hours. per day for roasting and this number can be increased if we extend the work to another 8 hours. Increasing market demand is also the time when coffee prices in Vietnam should return to a stable level so that individuals or businesses can more easily operate to contribute to Vietnam's economy. It is easy to see that during the time of high coffee prices, the number of Vietnamese coffee exports to the world is extremely small. Although there is value growth, it decreases in quantity. Realizing that the demand for coffee in countries in the region is increasing and the requirements for the quality of coffee beans are increasing, we confidently provide coffee processing services to customers in demanding markets in the world. Recently, VCU's Fine Robusta coffee beans have always achieved high results at coffee festivals. This is also what we have always followed since the first days of participating in this manufacturing industry. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to get in touch with me to discuss more knowledge about coffee.\n\n😱 Get ready for your morning coffee to become a lot more expensive! Coffee comes in two broad varieties: Robusta and Arabica (and, for me, tastes best when blended). Robusta prices have been rising dramatically in the past as Vietnam indicated a 20% drop in production this year due to inclement weather and other more profitable fruits crowding out coffee. This shortfall was higher than what was expected by markets and, as a result, prices rose ~35% this year already. No surprise that substitution effects are now driving up the price of the Arabica variety which started moving more meaningfully recently and appears to be following the trajectory of Robusta. If this trend continues, coffee prices for the end user are bound to rise substantially over the next months. Load up that 🚚 with your favourite beans... #coffee\n\nThe sum of so many parts right now is putting upward pressure on coffee prices in Australia and this makes future trends for coffee extremely difficult to predict. The common question we are asked by roasters today is when will price stability and availability return to “normal” levels? … This is the new normal. This uncertainty is creating extremely challenging conditions for roasters and exposing the limits of the two predictable responses to cost increases: pricing and procurement. Both have their limits and if they are pushed to extremes the result is slimmer margins, decreased sales volumes, or both. I have always believed when the environment gets tough, creativity thrives. It demands us to go beyond conventional commercial levers to find solutions to our problems. We can lament the bad news of higher costs, $6 lattes, and so on, or tackle the problem by reevaluating our purpose in the market. Why do we exist, why are we roasting coffee, what purpose is it serving, and what experience is it giving the consumer? If we are telling customers to get comfortable paying more for coffee, we have to deliver an experience to match. This is an effort that starts at the farm and ends, all the way through to the barista. I am happy to pay more if the experience is good and the beverage is just as good but now is not the time to increase prices and drop the quality as the only mechanism to tackle the current situation. https://lnkd.in/ePbPzQZ3\n\nIn the dynamic world of coffee trading, recent closures have presented intriguing figures for July: New York's Arabica coffee at $184.00 USD per 100 pounds and London's Robusta coffee at $3264.00 USD per ton. With a ton equating to 1,000 kilos, and each kilo at 2.2045 pounds, the price comparison when converted to pounds tells a compelling story. For Arabica, the cost is $1.84 USD per pound, while Robusta sits at $1.48 USD per pound. This places the difference at 36 cents per pound, narrowing the gap between these two varieties. Such a scenario beckons a closer look at market dynamics, especially considering the historical pricing trends between Arabica and Robusta coffees. Hypothesis: The narrowing price gap suggests that lower-grade Arabica may soon see increased demand among roasters traditionally favoring Robusta. This shift could be driven by the quest for cost-effectiveness without significantly compromising on quality, especially as the difference hits a historical low. This analysis is further visualized in the accompanying graph, courtesy of StoneX Group Inc. and Albert Scalla, whose insights have been invaluable in understanding these trends. As the coffee market continues to evolve, keeping an eye on these developments will be crucial for stakeholders across the value chain. The potential shift in roaster preferences could have far-reaching implications for producers, traders, and consumers alike.\n\nMy report is still valid Price of coffee is perfectly like its tastes Why coffee price has been up at harvest time? First deal: coffee crop 2022-2023 was too poor and shorted, just June, all stock was out at all (clients took all grades of coffee….). 4 months from June until early Nov 2023, almost peoples in Coffee business could not do anything because no stock at all, and average vollume per month for coffee exporting is 125.000 mts (total volume shorted is 500.000 mts) This shortage is very dangerous because all parties in coffee business already signed contracts “sell-buy, from roasters, distributors, importers, exporters, local collectors, ….all are stucked at very low price about 1800 usd/mt until 2000 usd/mt, and could not know how to do because NO STOCK AT ALL in Market. After that they had discussed together then try to delay the shipments until Nov 2023 – harvest time of coffee Deal 2: until Sept – Oct, price of coffee was very high, many peoples thought that it is top prices, then many peoples again play other game “SELL one more Huge volume of coffee for Nov-Dec shipment”and hope that price could be down again and can average the lost of first deal, price was about 2200-2400 usd/mt However, when harvest time of coffee arrived, price of coffee was not down as expectation, then the delievery for first deal was not happened again, even for 2nd deal, All people has been so scary, but it still has on other option to support them that “”Heldging” on London and Newyork coffee platform, all parties have came to these Platform to buy and cover coffee, it makes price of coffee on these platform more active and up futher, => it makes local market up again > all parties have came to these Platform to buy and cover coffee again => a vicious cycle that repeats itself over and over again untill 90% of volume shorted delivery only. But the delievery of all short coffee is too difficult because it is huge volume about over 100.000 mts and it has risky for defaults, if possible it makes at least 2 months until feb, so the room for rising is more advantage Can say that in the past platforms makes farmers poorer but now they make others in big trouble\n\nPrice of coffee is perfectly like its tastes Why coffee price has been up at harvest time?

Carton-packed coffee is valued for its low price and convenience but has storage issues. Bottled coffee is favored for its ease of drink and storage. If prices rise, 43.5% would continue drinking coffee, 26.3% would reduce their intake, and 3.9% would switch to alternatives. Additionally, 32.2% are interested in trying alternative coffees, such as soybean, dandelion, and brown rice coffee.
