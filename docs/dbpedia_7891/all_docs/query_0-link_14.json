        "text": "HONG KONG — A Hong Kong lawmaker who broke ranks with his pro-Beijing allies by calling last week for the resignation of the city’s top official faces expulsion from a prestigious Chinese government advisory panel as punishment for his disloyalty, his brother said Tuesday.\n\nThe lawmaker, James Tien, the leader of the Liberal Party, is set to be expelled from the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference for not supporting its resolutions, which include backing Hong Kong’s government, Mr. Tien’s brother, Michael, said in a telephone interview.\n\nThe body’s standing committee will meet Wednesday to vote on the issue, said Michael Tien, also a Hong Kong lawmaker.\n\n“The oath made when being appointed is that they would vow to uphold all the resolutions made by the standing committee of the C.P.P.C.C.,” said Michael Tien, a delegate to China’s legislature, the National People’s Congress. “So they considered him as not honoring his oath.”\n\nThe swift response is a signal that Beijing backs Leung Chun-ying, Hong Kong’s chief executive, even as public support for him dwindles during student-led pro-democracy protests. Mr. Leung’s handling of the demonstrations, which have occupied busy avenues of the city, has been heavily criticized by democracy advocates, many of whom are calling for his resignation.\n\nJames Tien echoed that sentiment on Friday, saying in a radio interview that Mr. Leung’s leadership had been poor. It was the first time a prominent member of the pro-business establishment had called for Mr. Leung to quit.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
