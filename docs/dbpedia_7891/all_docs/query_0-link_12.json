        "text": "In fact, Tien, 64, feels buoyant about vying for a Legislative Council seat next year in the New Territories East, where his party is likely to go head to head with one of the incumbents - his elder brother, James Tien Pei-chun.\n\n\"Based on what people have told us and the party's image, we are absolutely qualified to win a seat there,\" he said. \"It [all] depends on whether we can find a presentable candidate.\"\n\nBoth brothers are directly elected lawmakers serving geographical constituencies. Michael Tien said he agreed with the public perception that his legislative colleagues who were elected to represent trades and industries, with a far smaller electoral mandate, generally lacked political sensitivity, but he doubted they would change.\n\nLegco's 30 trade-based lawmakers were voted into the 70-member legislature in 2012 by just 241,000 people, voting on behalf of their professions, accounting for about 7 per cent of the city's electorate.\n\nTien suggested, however, the imbalance was not to blame.\n\n\"These voters are more concerned about issues in their sectors than politics… That is why many criticise functional-constituency lawmakers for blindly [backing the government].\"\n\nTo improve governance, \"we need to minimise negative attitudes towards functional-constituency lawmakers … but they would, absolutely, not [change]\".\n\nThe relevance of trade-based Legco seats is once again in the spotlight, after 31 pro-establishment lawmakers left the chamber ahead of a vote on the government's political reform proposal on June 18 in a farcical attempt to force a suspension and buy time for their ally, Lau Wong-fat, to reach the venue.\n\nNew People's Party chairwoman Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee later called for a review of functional constituencies as \"some lawmakers have become less alert in their work because they can get re-elected easily\".\n\nShe was referring to key players in the debacle, Lau, Jeffrey Lam Kin-fung and Ip Kwok-him - all of whom were returned uncontested to trade seats in 2012.\n\nTien dismissed a pan-democratic suggestion voters upset by the vote farce could \"punish\" Beijing-loyalist parties.\n\n\"Voters in the district council [polls in November] do not care about politics … and for the Legco election, we are fortunate it will take place a year later.\"\n\nRather, he suggested, the pan-democrats ought to be worried, because their supporters could be dismayed by their defeat of the reform package.\n\nA combination of these factors meant the New People's Party was in a position to win more seats, especially in the New Territories East, he said.\n\nCommentators believe if the party contests that constituency next year, an intense fight will break out with James Tien's Liberal Party as both groups court middle-ground voters.\n\nMichael Tien rebutted suggestions the Liberals were less conservative and thus more appealing to voters. \"The Liberals … are 'naughty boys' who are good at political tactics, but the New People's Party is franker and [values] more teamwork.\n\n\"We also have a lot of communication [with Beijing] … If anything is unacceptable to me, I would risk anything to talk to Beijing behind closed doors.\"\n\nTrue to the \"naughty\" label it has earned from friends and foes alike, the Liberal Party will continue to prioritise the views of Hongkongers and Beijing - even if that means irking its pro-establishment allies, including Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying.\n\nThat is the tone the Liberals' heavyweight, James Tien Pei-chun, has set for his party, defiant against Leung even in the aftermath of his sacking from the nation's top advisory body.\n\n\"What residents think is most important,\" Tien, 68, said. \"If [my Legco colleagues] are not happy with it, that's their problem.\"\n\nThe Liberals might be in the same camp as his younger brother Michael Tien Puk-sun's New People's Party, but James Tien did not think it was a better choice for middle-ground voters.\n\nIn fact, it was questionable if the New People's Party was any better than other pro-establishment parties as long as its chairwoman, Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee, stayed on the government's top policymaking body, the Executive Council, James Tien said.\n\n\"If Ip quit Exco and dared to criticise the government, I would be afraid of them, because then we would be tapping the same [voter base],\" he said.\n\nTien, the Liberals' honorary chairman, is not one to shy away from straight talking. In October, he urged Leung - who beat former Liberal Henry Tang Ying-yen to the top job in 2012 - to consider stepping down at the height of the Occupy sit-ins, and promptly lost his Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference seat.\n\nLast month, Tien uploaded a picture of a pig to his Facebook page, hours after 31 of his Beijing loyalist allies walked out of the Legco chamber in the mistaken belief their move would delay a vote on electoral reform.\n\nThe image was a dig at lawmakers Jeffrey Lam Kin-fung and Ip Kwok-him for being \"stupid\" in initiating the walkout, which Tien and his four other Liberal legislators did not take part in.\n\nMichael Tien, a former Liberal, later said the pig appeared to have been an idea from young Liberals, whom he wished would do \"more constructive things\".\n\nHis elder brother dismissed suggestions that such jokes would make cooperation with pro-establishment colleagues difficult.\n\nThe Liberals valued \"the country first on all important issues\", such as supporting every political reform, James Tien said. \"[Secondly] there are our functional constituencies and residents… Our lowest priority is the Hong Kong government and C. Y.\"\n\nThe Liberals now have five Legco seats, comprising Tien's directly elected membership and four in functional constituencies.\n\nTien said his party would seek support from middle-ground voters who were disappointed by either the pan-democrats, who had been criticised over Occupy, or the Beijing loyalists, seen as \"blindly pro-government\".\n\nHe believed middle-ground voters were growing in numbers, both among the electorate that picked directly elected legislators and among the 233,000 people who would choose trade-based representatives during next year's Legco poll.\n\n\"The world [of functional constituencies] is changing, from voters who are concerned only about their sectors' interests … to those who value political ideals.\"\n\nFor these reasons, apart from mulling another term for himself, Tien said the Liberals would also try to win extra trade seats.\n\nAnd in the coming battle, they might just eye the commercial-sector seat occupied by former Liberal, and walkout initiator, Jeffrey Lam.\n\nThis article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Bickering brothers: head to head"
