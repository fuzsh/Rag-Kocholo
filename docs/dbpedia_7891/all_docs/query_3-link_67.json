        "text": "​Hand of Death [IMDB] [HKMDB]\n\nHong Kong, 1976\n\nDirected by John Woo\n\nStarring Dorian Tan, James Tien, Jackie Chan\n\nThe third of four martial arts films John Woo directed during the 1970s, Hand of Death represents a unique gathering of Hong Kong action cinema icons. As well as being made by the man who would become the most acclaimed action director in the world, it also features “brothers” Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao in supporting roles. Even James Tien, known for his appearances in the Bruce Lee films The Big Boss (1971) and Fist of Fury (1972), shows up as the villain of the piece.​\n\nLittle-seen due to its fairly poor availability in the west, Hand of Death is an intriguing early film for Woo. Significantly, it represents a meeting of the styles associated with two of Hong Kong's most notable studios. Woo made the film for Golden Harvest, and benefited from their opportunities for casting and outdoor shooting. However, in many ways Hand of Death retains the approach the director had learned while working under Chang Cheh for Shaw Brothers during the early 1970s.\n\n​While Woo's two previous martial arts projects had been relatively contemporary, the story here concerns one of the most familiar and commonly retold episodes of Chinese martial arts lore: the betrayal of the Shaolin temple. In this case the betrayer is the malevolent Shih Shao Feng, who spends the following ten years acting as a well-protected warlord for the Manchus. A scattered fragment of Shaolin, selects their most promising disciple to assassinate Shih before he can upend their plans to sow rebellion against the Manchu overlords.\n\nThat disciple, Yun Fei, is played not by any of the big names in the cast but by “Dorian” Tan Tao-liang. Tan has faded into obscurity now but appeared in a few dozen martial arts films in the late '70s.While not the most charismatic screen presence, Tan displays the superb kicking skills which earned him the nickname “Flash Legs.” In true Woo style, Yun Fei must ally himself with others to succeed: first a vengeful woodcutter who once trained at Shaolin (Jackie Chan) and later a dejected master swordsman (Paul Chang). Jackie looks very young indeed but his flair for combat and physical comedy is already well-developed. Also in 1976, he would win his first major starring role in Lo Wei's New Fist of Fury. For his part, Sammo Hung plays the comically bucktoothed Manchu enforcer Lord Du, while Yuen Biao is relegated mostly to stunts."
