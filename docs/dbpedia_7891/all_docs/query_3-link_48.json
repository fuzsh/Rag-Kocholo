Tien also voiced his opposition to Leung’s re-election in an interview with the Economic Journal.\n\n“Just because he got enough votes and has [the support of the] pro-establishment and loyalists doesn’t mean he can disregard society,” Tien said.\n\nHe said that Leung’s tough governance of Hong Kong has led to growing grievances within society, resulting in the Mong Kok unrest.\n\nTien added that Leung is tarnishing the image of the Chinese government among Hong Kong people, and that conflicts would be exacerbated if he is re-elected.\n\nHe also said that, due to Leung’s personality, the Chief Executive was unwilling to compromise on policy proposals, leading to pan-democratic filibustering.\n\n“Do you think that pro-establishment camp really supports Leung? If so, 35 of them sitting [in LegCo] would mean there can be no filibustering,” said the lawmaker, who holds one of the 70 seats in the legislature.\n\nHe also voiced his support for Finance Secretary John Tsang Chun-wah to become the next Chief Executive in 2017, while dismissing “dark horses” Antony Leung Kam-chung and Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee as not being sufficiently all-rounded."
