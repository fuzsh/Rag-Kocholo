        "text": "Bruce Lees first screen movie was a phenomenal success globally that would set him on to the path of Cinematic glory until his untimely death in 1973. The Big Boss directed by Lo Wei for Golden Harvest film productions under the production head, Raymond Chow and starred Lee, who had struck a deal with Chow to star in several productions after his spell in America, trying to become a name in Hollywood. The charismatic and agile Lee was a natural in the lead, which was originally going to be played by James Tien, but instead re-positioned with Lee in mind. Chow’s instinct and Bruces’ superb performance in The Big Boss made Lee a superstar overnight and the film itself was one of the most profitable film debuts in Hong Kong cinema at the time. Director Lo Wei was originally an actor, starring in many films in China before coming to Hong Kong and beginning a career as a director. The film also starred Maria Yi, James Tien, Tony Liu and Nora Miao and Han Ying-Chieh as the Big Boss of the title.\n\nThe plot centres on Cheng Chao (Bruce Lee), who is sent from Hong Kong to Thailand to work with his uncle and a new ‘family’ of Chinese immigrants working at a local ice factory. The extended family including Hsiu Chen (James Tien) take Cheng Chao under their wing and introduce him to the to the manager and to start work there. The factory is run by Thais with the manager being Chinese and the owner, The Big Boss in question, who is also Chinese. The racism from both the Thai locals and the bosses is obvious and the storyline does emphasis this enough that the audience gets the idea. It is n to long that we discover the ice factory is a front for a herion smuggling operation which is all the more apparent as two of the ‘family’ suddenly disappear without an explanation when they discover the truth about their work. While Hsiu Chen tries to find out where his friends have gone, he too is disposed and it turns to Cheng Chao to hopefully find out what has happened to his missing friends. Que much martial arts mayhem as Cheng Chao dispatches man after man in his quest to finally stop The Big Boss, but not without tragic consequences for Cheng Chao.\n\nThe Big Boss has, over the years, had several cuts, edited and extended editions and at least five re-titles in various territories, so historically this film has had quite a lot of history surrounding which cuts and editions are definitive. Historically, the infamous ‘saw in the head scene’ from Cheng Chaos second encounter with the Thai thugs in the factory was cut from then initial Hong Kong print and only stills survive of that scene. Many ‘fans’ online have tried to re-create this scene, but officially the film footage is lost and as mentioned, stills still exist. Rumours also existed of a longer version of The Big Boss being held b y a private collector in the UK, which was only shown at a London based Martial Arts film festival in 1979 and then promptly ‘disappearing’ again never to see the light of day. Until now, well sort of, @ArrowFilms in conjunction with Fortune Films, the holders of all of Bruce Lees Golden Harvest film catalogue have had access to the original Hong Kong print released in 1971, with around 10 minutes of scenes cut from prints released around the rest of the world, though this print was further cut in the Hong Kong territories this version in the boxed set is the most definitive version I have seen and does add to the storyline more, but maybe not what martial arts fans might expect.\n\nThe additional scenes consist of interactions with Cheng Chao adoptive family over a game of majohong, James Tien extended fight scene with five Thai thugs early on in the first act, which is actually pretty good, but there may have ben a conscience decision to lessen Tiens martial arts scenes to emphasis Lees. There are additional scenes between the factory manager and two of Chaos friends before they are killed, and the most memorable, an extended scene where Chaos is in a quandary as to what to do after he has killed the Thai thugs and The Big Boss’ son and finding his ‘family’ massacred. Chao is in despair over his mother, who is in her seventies, that if he choose the path of revenge, she will be alone, Chao has to dec die what he must do. These additional scenes reinforce the family in Hong Kong Cinema and makes the revenge element less cold and calculation, it does have repercussions. To me this adds more dramatic effect to the story, which I appreciated. There is also additional scenes in the Thai brothel before Chao goes on his final revenge attack and also explains how he had a brown bag of food once he reaches the Big Boss’ house.\n\nSomething I also enjoyed about The Mandarin Cut is the soundtrack by Wang Fu-ling is so different from any I have heard in relation to The Big Boss. The score has a menacing feel to it, it is as if there is a lead up to something not so good which is about to come. It fits perfectly with the film and this makes watching the movie all the more interesting and enjoyable.\n\nNow, o the grumbles, well @ArrowFilms sold their impressive Bruce Lee at Golden Harvest based set as the only place to see The Mandarin Cut. Upon watching the @ArrowFilms composite version of the film, the five line disclaimer sums up this particular version of the film, the extra scenes have been edited into the 4K restoration print, making it an un even viewing experience, the editing of the senes into the 4KL print is good, it is the failure to colour grade or remove the burnt in subtitles on the additional scenes is annoying. It is not the first time this has happened, the 2010 release of @HammerFilms Dracula (1958) had the same excuse for a definitive cut, with additional scenes from Japan, edited in, and not graded at all, with the same disclaimer used. As a curio it is cool, as a definitive print, no, and he same can be said for The Mandarin Cut. A silver lining though @ArrowFilms have also added The Mandarin Cut as a non-restored version, with the burnt on subtitles, original soundtrack and no crystal clear to not so clear imagery and I enjoyed that even more, I grew up with VHS prints so this was not a horrible experience for me at all."
