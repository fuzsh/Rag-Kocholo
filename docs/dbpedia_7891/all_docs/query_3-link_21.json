        "meta_description": "Thuy Tien literally means \"Water Fairy\" or \"Water Goddess\" in Vietnamese. The name originated from from an ancient myth of a water fairy who reincarnated into a beautiful woman _______and so forth(not sure about the rest because there are different versions of the story)Many poems have been been written to celebrate the beauty of water fairy. One of the famous ones was written by a Chinese scholar named Cao Zhi:\"Luo Shen Fu\"\"Gazing upon her from a distance;Bright as the sunOver rosy morning clouds.Step nearer, look more closely,She shimmers like a lotusAbove the waves.Neither thick-set nor frail,Neither tall nor shortHer shoulders seem scripted,Her waist narrowAs if bound.The graceful curve of her long neckReveals the white flesh of her throat.There is no need for perfume here,No need for leaden powder.\"Although the above poem by Cao Zhi is named Luo Shen Fu, it is widely believed that Cao Zhi wrote this poem in memory of another woman of exceptional beauty, Empress Zhen, who was believed to be the reincarnation of the water fairy.Thuy Tien translated into Chinese is : shui xian hua (水仙花) which can be translated as water spirit flower. The botanical designation is Narcissus tazetta v. chinensis, or Ruen.Special topiary carving techniques can be used to form leaves and flowers into fanciful shapes. The flower is an important element in the Chinese lunar new year celebration, and is sold at flower markets before the Chinese New Year. It is believed to be good luck to have the flower bloom on the first day of the Chinese lunar new year spring festival.",
