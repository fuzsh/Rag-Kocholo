Ronald Charles "Ron" Marlenee (born August 8, 1935) is a Republican politician who served in the United States House of Representatives from the U.S. state of Montana from January 3, 1977 to January 3, 1993. He was born in Scobey, Montana. With the 1990 Census, Montana lost one of its two seats in the House of Representatives.

A statewide showdown occurred between the states' two representatives, Marlenee and Democrat Pat Williams.

In the House elections of 1992, Williams defeated Marlenee to become Montana's sole congressman.

The Montana representative hence has more constituents than any of the other 434 U.S.

House members. The state has more population than one average-sized House seat but not enough for two.
