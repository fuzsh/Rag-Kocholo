        "text": "Washington - The Department of the Interior's Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs Neal McCaleb has named Daniel J. DuBray, a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, as his Special Assistant for Communications - Indian Affairs.\n\n\"Dan will be a valuable asset to Indian Affairs with his extensive media and Capitol Hill experience, and his understanding of American Indian issues,\" McCaleb said.\n\nDuBray previously was communications director for Rep. Harold Rogers of Kentucky, chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation. He also has served as a senior advisor to former congressmen Ron Marlenee and Rick Hill. While on Marlenee's staff, he played a key role on the team that worked on legislation to authorize the National Indian Memorial at Montana's Little Bighorn Battlefield.\n\nDuBray has worked extensively in radio and television broadcasting, having produced, anchored and managed a variety of broadcast news and entertainment programs for KALL AM/FM and KSL-AM in Salt Lake City, and at KULR-TV and KBLB AM Newsradio in his hometown of Billings, Mont. From 1993 to 1996, he was executive director of the Billings Community Cable Corp. and its Community Seven Television. DuBray produced and moderated nationally televised federal candidate debates produced in partnership with the Billings Gazette.\n\nThe Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs administers the Bureau of Indian Affairs, a 177- year-old federal agency with about 10,000 employees that provides services to, carries out federal trust responsibilities for and promotes the self determination of the 559 federally recognized tribal governments and approximately 1.4 million American Indians and Alaska Natives."
