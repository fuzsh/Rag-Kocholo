Statistics Canada reported Monday that higher prices for food, shelter and clothing pushed the cost \"of living up a full 1.0 per cent between Sep- tenilier and October to an an¬ nual level of 8.8 per cenu^ Ou*etien told tlie (Tominons that he believed the $100 tax cut proposed for low* and mid¬ dle income families in his March mini-budget provides enough economic stimulus at this time. He defended his decision to delay*.a phase-out of the gov¬ ernment’s wage and price controls until April. “If we had not had controls .. . we would be in much worse shape than we are,” he said. “I am obviously' unhappy' about the rate of inflation this month.” (Thretien said, but he vontended labor was partly to blaipe because it refused to join government and business in a TJOlicy of voluntary re¬ straint. Prime Minister Trudpau said economic problems were based on lower productivity in the Canadian manufacturing sector than in the U.S. He -added, however, “Canadian productivity’ is closing the gap with American productivity, therefore we are on the right track, therefore • government jxjllcies must be coirect.” NDQ^ Leader Ed Broadbent. who called for new'measures to stimulate fhF economy^ said the rise~ in the price index cost a family with an income of Slo.OOO some $450 io , spending power!

Ferry Corp had decided to accept medU’- tor Oive Mclvee’s recom¬ mended settlement for the ■prolonged disyiute between the crown corywralion jmd the B.C. Ferry and Marine Work¬ ers Union. Davj^i said the anti-inflation guiddinea ^ttlement for the 2,600 uniori'Tnembers would I- kely necessitate a fare hike by spring. MTiile he wasn’t prepared to place a figure on the increase, he did say it wouldn’t boost the fares to the level in force before last sum- mewTP’s 20 per cent cut. That reduction was .the first since the controversial doubling of lares in June, 1976.

H«; jumped, up like a man possessed, grabbed the chair and threw it at me.’\" Snyman said it took five men and “considerable force to subdue Biko and that dur¬ ing the scuffle Biko “tell wnlh hi.s head against the wall.” “It must have been a tetri- ble blow because at that .stage five of us were on him.” Sny¬ man said.

He made the statement to. reporters Telephone possible listener OTTAWA (CP) — A Bell Canada report tabled Tues¬ day in the Commons says a telephone in the office of Pro¬ gressive Conservative Lead¬ er Joe Clark could 'Mn a so¬ phisticated way” have been used as an eavesdropping de¬ vice. But the report tabled by Speaker James Jerome ques¬ tions the findings reported earlier by a Toronto private detective firm alleging on Clark’s behalf that the tele¬ phone had been tampered with to become an electronic listening device. At one point the report says that a Bell Canada repair¬ man worked on the telephone just four days before the tam¬ pering allegations were raised Oct. 31 and ’’did not find the set to be defective as to service.” “We would observe ... that if the hook switch contact had been bent as claimed, the tel¬ ephone set would have been found by the user to be in a defective condition.” ’‘It is our view based on our tests that any telephone ac¬ cessing this telephone through the switched network could not use this telephony as an eavesdropping device,” the report says. “However, the subject telephone was in a condition that if accessed in a sophisticated way directly from cables associated with that telephone, it could have acted as an eavesdropping device.” after asking ^rime Minister Trudeau in the Commons If he knew of a file code named Operation Featherbed. The prime minister said he had never heard of the file. The operations also includ¬ ed surveillance and Informa¬ tion gathering of a senior member of the current feder¬ al cabinet, Cossitt said out¬ side the (Ammons. The MP from Leeds, per¬ sistent critic of Trudeau’s personal life, said he did not doubt his sources, although he had not personally seen or read the file. He said the operation was launched against gallery members who held extreme views, eithef on the left or right of the political spec¬ trum. (Cossitt said he knew the identity of the high-rank¬ ing cabinet member, but re¬ fused to tell the name. The MP said there was no apparent connection between the file on the media and the Information on the minister. But he said his sources, one of whom was in the RCMP, confirmed the files contained Information on the personal habits as well as political ac¬ tivities of the reporters. He said the operation went back to at least 1968, when the Trudeau government as¬ sumed power, and additions had been made to the files within the last two years. Cossitt first raised the issue in November, 1975, when he submitted a written question on the matter to then solicitor-general Warren All- mand. The reply by Allmand said the RCJMP did not release such information in the inter¬ ests of national security. Cossitt insisted his sources recently re-confirmed the ex¬ istence of Operation Feather¬ bed and, b^ause of new in¬ formation, he raised the mat¬ ter In the Commons. He said he would raise the matter with Solicitor-C^neral Francis Fox and that he was certain half a dozen cabinet ministers knew of the file. “Some of them may deny it officially, but unofficially they are aware of it,” he said. Cossitt said he would dis¬ close names of those involved once the Liberal government admitted it was aware of the operation.

Wednesday. Nov. 16, 197 Comment WEDNESDAY. NOVEMBER It, 1M7 A Touches of class PIERRE TRUDEAU’S shocking lack of grace in accepting the Speaker’s ruling on the Tory “buggitig” incident was quite properly brought into sharp focus by NDP leader Ed Broadbent’s sarcastic remark that the prime minister had flived up to his reputation for being a complete gentleman.” Mr. Trudeau s behavior does little to strengthen the view widely held in some quar¬ ters that the superior manners of our French fel- low-Canadlans does much to enhance the image of Canada at home and abroad by offsetting the often crass and uncultured conduct of some members of our Anglo-Canadian community. Oddly enough, a further blow to this once broadly accepted assumption was struck well and truly %y yet another well-known son of Quebec. Rene Levesque, only a few days pre¬ vious to the prime minister’s remarkable dis¬ play of poor taste. Once a close fri^d of Mr. Trudeau’s but now Premier of Quebec and an active enemy of federalism. Mr. Levesque demonstrated a boor ishness in the presence of Her Majesty the Queen of‘Canada w hich was both unprecedented and uncalled for. Whether the misbehavior of both these Canadian leaders was brought about by their personal disregard of our country’s historic link with the British Crown and the traditions of ^he British parliamentary system can only be guessed at. Nevertheless it should be noted that whatev¬ er lack of respect Premier Levesque displayed before the Queen in Canada was not repeated before the French dignitaries in France. At least he didn’t attempt to light his fag from the eternal flame burning over the tomb of the Unknow n Soldier under the .Arc de Triomphe. For which all Canadians shouldbe grateful. Who wins ■ when you quit.^ RECENTLY Eugene Kaellis said he would -resign from the board of Victoria General Hospi tal if trustees continued to move counter to the wishes of members of the hospital society. The difference of opinion, since patched up, involved the future of the existing downtown hospital after a new Victoria General has been built in View Royal. At a recent general mem¬ bership meeting a motion dealt with this but Kaellis argued the board was modifying that motion in taking a public positipn. The board at first said the old hospital should be used for some kind of health care, leaving open the option of caring for ill old people, called extended care. Kaellis said the membership was more spe cific. indicating the hospital should continue delivering the kind of care it is now delivering, called acute care. The difference in just these few words is fundamental. It is tlie difference between build¬ ing the View Royal hospital primarily as a replacement for the existing Victoria General and building it as an additional general hospital in the community while retaining the old hospital in the same business of providing acute care. The background here is the board in general and Kaellis in particular don’t like the present plan, dictated by the provincial government, to split the hospital on two sites during a two-phase construction period. Kaellis wants to lake a harder line than the majority of the board, who likely see the new hospital plan as a fait ac¬ compli. What troubles us is Kaellis’ threat to resign. At the hospital society’s annual meeting last April members elected Kaellis. a newcomer, to the board, in fact making, him their first choice of 10 candidates in an election which saw the board cha^uman and two other incum bents dumped. ^ Now the going is getting heavy and he talks of quitting. He would have scored a brief mo¬ ment of attention for his views if he had resigned but then his considerable talents would have been lost to the board. That’s hardly what his supporters had in mind last April. I Edward Carrigaa j ' . ’ . ...1 Pulp and paper: growth, at a crawl > Now that the problems of Canada's ^ metal mining industry have becoifie etched on the public consciousness through the extensive Inco layoffs, it would be as well to turn some attention to another Canadian resource industry whose immediate prospects are les.s than glowing, the pulp and paper Indus try. The most spectacular recent symp tom of ill-health was the decision of the Newfoundland government to close down its $200 million liner-board plant at Stephensville. The British Columbia government in 1973 was compelled to take over the Crown Zellerbach mill at Ocean Falls to prevent It being shut* down, while in October, Consolidated-Bathurst closed its mill at Cap de .Madeleine. Quebec Quebec Lan^s and Forest Minister. Yves Berube felt so moved by Consoli dated-Bathurst’s recitation of its prob lems with its Cap de Madeleine mill that he asked the paper unions to consider accepting pay reductions to keep such mills in operation. The B.C. pulp and paper Industry, with its 22 mills, is operating at only 75 per cent of capacity and Wyerhaeuser Canada Ltd. has shut down its Kam loops pulp mill for four weeks for a \"fall maintenance\" program which many ob- servers believe is inspired by high in ventorles of unsold product. One official of the B.C. pulp industry estimated that any major rise in the world pulp market is at least seven years away and his company, he says, has no immediate plans to increase pulp capacity. Investment in new capacity in the B.C. pulp and paper industry declined from $344 million in 1971 to $186 million- in 1975. as producers found their net return on capital inadequate to justify continued capital expenditure. The B.C experience of declining investmeni levels for new capacity is duplicated in other provinces. 'Hie stagnant world paper market is indicated by the decision of the Swedish paper industry in early October to re duce its price for pulp from $410 a ton to $350 a ton. The Scandinavian pulp Indus try has an unsold surplus estimated at two million tons. The Canadian industry is reported to be selling high-grade pulp at $300 a ton, well below the posted price of 1340 a ton and too low a level to earn a profit. The Canadian pulp and paper Indus try is beset by a relatively static world market for its products and less favor able conditions than its major rivals enjoy. Spokesmen for the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association have esti mated that world consumption of pulp and paper products in the next 15 years will increase by only 0.5 per cent a year, whereas in the past five years the aver age rate of growth in world consumption was five per cent a year. j Frank Lowe | ' Football economics — a case of more for less MONTREAL*^ As I am no economist, I will have to tell you this little tale — and let you decide what the moral might be. It began when I was brows- * ing through the sports pages. Almost cheek-by-jow’l were articles about the U.S. foot¬ ball extravaganza, the Super Bowl, and the upcoming Ca nadian football extravagan za, the Grey Cup. Suddenly, the difference in et^onomlcs in the two events struck home. The top ticket price for the Grey Cup here was to be $15. The top price for the Super Bowl ticket wUl be $10. As 1 said, I am in no posi¬ tion to draw conclusions from this. But as I considered those two prices. I began to think of the other factors in¬ volved. For instance, if you are a Canadian fan driving to the Grey Cup, each time you pull up at a service station you will pay more per gallon for ^ctly the same gas a U.S. fan will pay when he drives to the Super Bowl. ^ And don’t tr>' to tell me this rf price differential is because the U.S. gallon is smaller than the Canadian gallon. I have talked with too many Canadian travellers return¬ ing home from the U.S. not to realize that this is not the reason. The U.S.. which discovered the \"energy crisis,\" is still .selling gas cheaper than we are. If our Grey Cup-bound fan stops for a meal, he will prob¬ ably pay more than a Super Bowl-bound fan. In an equiv- flept place, that is. Then, of course, there is the Canadian fan who has to take a plane in order to get to his annual Grey Cup outing. If he cares to check, he will find that he is paying consider¬ ably more per air mile than his U.S. cousin. Also, his taxi fare from home to airport is much higher, on a mileage basis. For instance, have you com¬ pared recently what you pay to get to Mirabel — and don’t forget, after the frolic is over, you have to get home — as compared to what you pay to get from New York to JFK? If you live far enough away from the Grey Cup site to have to take a plane, you will probably have to lease yourr self a hotel room. I am willing to bet that Super Bowl hotel room rates — again compar¬ ing equivalent hotels ~ are lower than they are here. Just comparing New York and Montreal, I have found in recent years that I can Jive more reasonably in a first class New York hotel thJTi in Montreal. Then your football nut. re¬ gardless of which side of the border he might live on, has to eat. Again I am willing to bet that the Super Bowl ad¬ dict’s meal tab will be less than the Grey Cup fan’s. I don't think that I am re¬ vealing any secret when I mention that football fans, whatever tbeir nationality, do not live on bread alone. Apparently many of them like to enliven the occasion with a drink or two, or three. Even^in this area, the Cana¬ dian fan seems to be on the losing end. The bottle of booze he car¬ ries to his hotel room for \"hospitality” purposes not only costs, ounce per ounce, more than its U.S. opoosite number. It Is an inferior product as its proof content is considerably lower. For all this, what does the Canadian fan get? He gets to watch a group of athletes who, for the most part, couldn’t make it in the U.S. pro leagues! In other words, he is paying an infinitely higher price to watch an inferior exhibition. As I said. I am not an econ¬ omist so I do not feel qualified to point out any moral in aii this. But I might modestly suggest that those real econo¬ mists who tell us day after day that they are earnestly attempting to determine what is plaguing the Canadi¬ an business world might look at these two events, the Grey CdfTind the Super Bowl, and come to some conclusions. Could part of the reason for our business slow-down be because Canadians are charging too much for too little? The CPPA predicts that Canada’s newsprint capacity will grow by only 0.9 per cent a year from 1977 to 1979, less than one third of the average growth of 2.8 per cent a year in the peric^ 1956-76. Canadian pulp capacity between 1977 and 1979 is expected to grow by 1.6 per cent a year, whereas in the period 1956- 76. it grew by an average of four per cent a year. The Canadian pulp and paper indus¬ try faces ferocious foreign competition. About 20 years ago a process was dis¬ covered to make newsprint from south¬ ern pine and the centre of gravity of pulp and paper industry in Canada and the United States has been shifting steadily to the southern states. Southern pine grows to cutting size in 12 years. while it ukes Ci’nadian trees from M to 90 years to grow *o,a size at which they can be harvested. The U.S. newsprint Industl^ is pected to expand iU capacity in the l9n-79 period by 3.1 per cent, which is more than three times the rate of growth of the capacity of the Canadian industry. T.J. Bell, chairman of the Abitibi Paper Co. Ltd. says that the coels ofptf^ucing pulp and paper in the United States are only half of what they are in Ontario. -/The weight of evidence indicates that Canada’s pulp and paper industry Is becoming less competitive. The payroll costs of two forestry firms, MacMillan Bloedel Ltd. and B.C. Forest Products rose between 78 per cent and 87 per cent in the period 1970-1974, considerably more rapidly than tl» rise of 35 per cent to 45 per cent sustained by Weyer haeuser and Potlatch in their operations in neighboring U.S. states. Canadian forestry firms must pay much higher interest costs than their U.S. competitors and they often face higher cosU in insUilirig pollution con¬ trol equipment than do Arms in other nations whose governraenU are so in¬ tent on attracting industry that they routinely waive pollution control stan¬ dards. Abitibi Paper Co. Ltd. reports that it will spend $70 million between 1978 and 1984 on pollution abatement programs for its eight mills In Ontario. Brutality complaints against Ulster police BELFAST - The Royal Ul¬ ster Constabuiary, now bear¬ ing an increasing shase of the fight against the IRA in Northern Ireland, has re¬ ceived 215 complaints of po¬ lice brutality against sus¬ pects this year. The chief constable of the force says that no brutality is going on, but many lawyers, doctors and. privately, poli¬ cemen. are asking whether urban guerrillas can be law¬ fully punished without brutal¬ ity. The problem begins in get¬ ting a terrorist convicted in the courts: internment with¬ out trial was ended nearly two years ago. There are no witnesses willing to appear in terrorist cases; 80 per cent of police evidence comes* from confessions given to them by suspects in custody. A con¬ fession, therefore, is para¬ mount. But on the other side of the interrogation room is not an ordinary criminal, but a poli¬ tically-motivated terrorist who sees the policeman as an enemy in a war. In this eight- year-old war, 107 policemen have been killed and 3.000. over half the entire force, have been injured. The unusual nature of Northern Ireland’s legal pro¬ cess extends to the court room as well. There is no jury, as jurors are intimidat¬ ed; there is a judge who is jury as well. Over three-quarters of the cases turn on whether the confession, which is the po¬ lice evidence, was obtained . legally or illegally: if \"tor¬ ture, inhuman or degrading treatment*^ was used, then the judge must dismiss the case. This year only three cases have b^n dismissed on these grounds. Ninety four per cent of police charges result in a conviction. Allegations of ill-treatment have l^n made repeatedly by the political wings of ter¬ rorist organizations, both Protestant and Catholic. But thev received a new credibili¬ ty last month when the So¬ cial, Democratic and Labor Party. Ulster’s second big¬ gest and largely Catholic political party, called police brutality a \"public scandal.\" One party member, a Bel¬ fast doctor, described how patients of his had their wrists bent back, been beaten and kicked on the head, stom ach and testicles, been burqgd with cigarettes and been made to squat for hours at a time. The police doctors who ex¬ amine suspects before and after interrogation are also reported to be unhappy about police behavior. Nineteen so¬ licitors recently threatened to withdraw from court pro¬ ceedings unless ill treatment ended. Ulster’s leading news¬ paper and a national TV cur¬ rent affairs program have both called for an indepen¬ dent judicial inquiry. One lawyer said: \"You can have' Ihw or order in Northern Ire- /iand but not both,\" ' Yet it was only Just over a year ago that the European Commission on Human Rights- said in Strasbourg that there had been cases of \"inhuman treatment and tor¬ ture” in Northern Ireland. By MARK (TNEILL the LoMiMi Observer There were 12 victims, in 1971: all received large amounts of compensation money and Britain promised that the techniques — food and sleep deprivation, con¬ tinuous noise, and hooding suspects — would not be used again. The brutality alleged this year is less sophisti¬ cated. Ulster police chief Ren Newman stands firm in his denials; \"There’s no policy or toleration of brutality.\" No policeman has ever been con¬ victed of it. Critics say that this is because policemen will not give esidence against one anoUier and point out that it is the police who investigate themselves. Of the 215 com- plainu this year, only one has resulted in a prosecution, al¬ though some suspects have received compensation money for their treatment. To Newman’s credit Is the RUCs most successful year since the troubles began in 1969. Only 105 people dead, the lowest for seven years; only 234 explosions, the lowest for ei^t: nearly 900 terrorists behind bars, the highest ever. The arms haul to date is 432 guns, 3,551 pounds of explosives and 40, 785 rounds of ammunition. For the first tinM in eight years people talk of the trou¬ bles ending. To a population that has listened to terrorist enormities for so long, the allegations against the police seem of little importance, a small price to pay for ending the troubles. C Erma Bombeck 1 In the olden days BC (Before Canqpes), this column would never have been written, but since hors d'oeuvres. appetizers and those little before-dinner snacks have b^ame so chic, it’s an absolute necessity. There are some foods that do not diminish when you chew them ... they grow, and 1 suspect multiply. One of them is the anchovy. I have inadvertently found myself with an anchovy in my mouth which I have chewed on vigorously for three days and swallowed 137 times only to wake up in the 'middle of the night and realize 1 was still chewing it Anchovies are sneaky little devils and often disguise themselves as edible. They never look the same. Once in your mouth, however, they wrap themselves around your front tooth and refuse to let go. The late naturalist, Euell Gibbons, once wrote about eating a seaweed called Dulse. He said when this reddish weed was fresh from the tide pool it was tough and tasteless, giving the sensatioo of chewing on a salted rubber band. However, one rainy day when he craved some, he put a little in an open onion bag, dried it an hour in the automatic clothes d^r and it tasted wonderful. There is nothing you can do for an anchovy. You can salt it down, dry it out, pickle it, can it. sautee it and make a paste out of it. It still tastes like you’re eating bait. It’s baffling to me, but there are some people who do not find anchovies disgusting at all and I try to be tolerant. I have one friend, old Fish Breath, who invari¬ ably orders them on her pizza when she is in my presence. It’s all I can do to remember she is kind to her mother, tithes to the church and doesn’t litter our highways. As I c'Ircled a table full of appetizers the other night, it occurred to me that one of life’s greatest mysteries is. \"What’s in all those little globs and mounds of shredded food?\" It’s one of the few places where I throw pride to the wind and wear my glasses. As I bent over a crust of bread, shaped like a diamond and covered with bits of bacon, shredded shrimp, a glob of blue cheese and a toothpick holding an olive with an almond centre, 1 looked at my husband. He looked weird. His teeth weren’t meeting. He gasped only two words before he took leave; \"It’s liver? ” Unlike an anchovy, liver doesn’t grow or multiply. Liver is like malaria. Once you think it’s gone; the taste comes badk ... maybe not today or tomorrow ... but someday... copvrWM wn ritM enwrpnm tnc. Zbt BadliiZttUftfisf.

RICHARD BOWER PUBLISHER AND EDITOR-IN-CHIEF LLOYD BAKER ASSOCIATE EDITOR FRED BARNES managing EDITOR I r Colofilit Victor^, b;(^., Wediresday, Nor. le/ ivn S GORDE HUNTER one man's opinion THE CHANCE I hare boen completely mis- reading the public tenor in such things as respect shown certain groups and/or occupations, I wilJ ask my dear readers to accept or reject my own hypothe¬ sis on the subject. 1 bring this up because of recent published find¬ ings by a UCLA sociologist re the measuring of status. He rejects some of the old standbys like money, clothes, big automobiles, second homes and member¬ ship at the exclusive clubs. They no longer count. What does count, he says, are our occupations. Every kid (male) on my block wanted to be one of three things — a sur athlete, a fireman or a truck driver. Every girl wanted to be a nurse. All honorable occupations, but Pm afraid they receive rather low ranking today from this professor. Donald Treiman. Treiman, with obviously a lot of spare time at his disposal, says his findings are^ based on roughly 85 studies made since the end of the last war and covering 509 different occupations. Prestige rankings were set from 0 to 100. Right off the bat I have to Uke issue with the top end of his scale. His results show that university professors were tied with physicians with 78 points. I am not about to question the high IKiblic rating of physicians, in that most people do indeed look up to the medical profession, and certainly we put our very lives In their hands every day. We’d ruddy well better have a healthy respect for and empathy with our doctors. BUT 1 WILL QUESnO.N the high rating given university professors. Public comment reaching my ears would itieem to indicate the exact opposite. Their own students often knock thentfor being delinquent in their teaching approaches and for too many absences frbm the teaching forums. And the general pubjic holds them in something less than high esteem because of such things as paid sabbaticals and unwarranted job tenure. Many claim the whole university process is riddled with soft, leftist-leaning professors who teach everything from anarchy to sloth. U is not. of course, but there is enough evidence to suggest a top-place ranking for university professors ij something less than warrant¬ ed. ' Next In the professor’s ratings came lawyers with 71 points, dentists and heads of large business firms with 70, accountants with 68. business executives with 67 and high school teachers with 64. Lawyers with 71 points? Again. I’ve been getting the wrong vibes from the public. My information puts the law society well down the list. They stand accused of everv’thing from over charging to formulating laws in a legalistic mumbo-jumbo that leaves us in a state of unnecessary confusion. The only thing they’re not charged with today is ambulance chasing. Journalists came in with 57 points, a reasonably kigh rating that will be severely disputed by univesity professors andlawyers. Nurses are right up there with 54 points, secretaries with 53 and stewardesses with 50. But, dammit, he doesn’t even rate firemen, which is a kick in the head to youthful druthers, aiid present-day practitioners of this rather hazardous undertaking. And, in this respect. I have to think his whole treatise is full of buffalo chips in that my own investigations shows a very healthy public respect for all firemen. ATHLETES ARE NOT USTED in his findings, whi^ obviously means the good professor did not bother to check in with the younger set at all. Had he so done, he might have discovered that athletes rank at least as high as professors and lawyers. Truck drivers are well down the list with 33 points, which blows another youthful dream. Those who live off welfare were rated at 30 points, which put them ahead of taxi drivers, gas station attendants, janitors and laborers. Does this not suggest to you the guy has to have his marbles mixed? I mean, nobody, but nobody can possibly rate welfare recipients higher than those gainfully employed in any line of work. Policemen got a low 40 points, which leads me to another assumption that those queried in the studies are hypocrites, because in times of desperate assistance. I’ll wager they holler “copper” every time. Plumbers, among the richest members of our society today, got a low rating of 34. which leaves them behind automobile salesmen, TV repairmen and post office clerks. Actually, I can’t really get worked up about this status bit anyway, in that it is palpably phoney and u.sed only by the social-climbing set, the blue bloods and sociologi.sts presenting papers in an effort to justify the thou.sands of bucks they get for presenting papers. ^ Besides, who would you believe? A sociologist or a youngster on the street? The kids still like athletes, firemen, truck drivers and nurses. Er, kids, how about squeezing in stewardesses’’ To the editor t Unemployed not to blame Surely It Is bad enough Just being out of work. The unem¬ ployed shouldn’t have to bear the blame for unemployment too. This is what Trudeau and his government would have us believe, with all their talk of jobs going begging, and the unemployed not wanting work. At best, there are about 40,000 Jobs available across Canada. There are at least 1,000,000 people unemployed. Fill the 40,000 jobs tomorrow and you still have 960,000 out of work. Today’s unemployed are no more to blame for their lot than those who suffered simi¬ larly during the Great De¬ pression. Surprisingly, to listen to some ~ many who survived the depression — one can only conclude that this latest ‘Gospel According to Pierre’ is rapidly gaining converts. How easily people forget! It is nothing short of politi¬ cal irresponsibility for Tru¬ deau to attempt to convince people that the unemployed are the cause of unemploy¬ ment. DONALD F. GILL, Quebec Street. Victoria.

We were turned away. It seems a swim meet>wd been ar¬ ranged so the public was turned down. No announce¬ ments were made last week, no announcements were even evident today. As we walked away, feeling bitter over our treatment, an¬ other “regular” family from Metchosin met us on their way in. It is no wonder the Crystal Pool is attracting such a poor reputation.

Be¬ cause of tl^ wide interest shown by the public in endan¬ gered species, I believe it necessary to clarify some of the statements made in the two articles. Two subspecies of pere¬ grine falcon breed in B.C. The Anatum subspecies nest from the Coast mountains eastwards and is generally considered to be endangered. The Peale’s subspecies nests along the coast from southern Vancouver Island to Alaska (not just on the Queen Char¬ lotte Islands) and is not gen¬ erally considered to be en¬ dangered. ' The fish and wildlife branch has not, to my knowl¬ edge. received unconfirmed reports (other than from the author of the articles), that a “number of falcons were sto¬ len this spring from the (^ueen diarlotte Islands and« shipped to the Middle East.” Gn the contrary, we have good reason to believe that no poaching of falcons took place on the (^een Charlotte islands this year. It is true that the branch often hears reports of birds being ripped off, but in most cases, upon there is no sub^ the reports. C^trary to the statement in the second article, there have been no exceptions in the past four years to the policy of not harvesting pere¬ grine falcons. There have been a few exceptions to the policy of not exporting pere¬ grines from B.C., but only in one of the following circum stances: (1) the birds were the property of persons living elsewhere in Canada, but had been on loan to falconers liv¬ ing in B.C.; (2) the bird was acquired before the moratori¬ um on harvest and the fal¬ coner was taking up resi¬ dence in another prince; and. (3) the birds were being use6 on a government-sup- ported research project and were returned to B.C. at the conclusion of the project. All the above birds were acquired before the raori- torium on harvest, or were bred in captivity. Poaching is only a minor threat to the Peale’s pere¬ grine falcons in B.C., in com parison to the potential de¬ struction of its food supply (.small seabirds) from loss of nesting habitat, contamina tion by chemicals, or a major oil spill. — W.

THINK SCHOOL PROGRAM Ex-RCMP’s pride undiminished I am a former member of the RCMP. During my 14 years of ser vice. I experienced duty post mgs at an urban detachment, .a remote detachment, a subdivision headquarters, a division headquarters and at the headquarters of the force ill Ottawa. During the total of my senice 1 never had any cause whatsoever to consider that force as other than a collection of loyal, dedicated, conscientious, perceptive, in¬ telligent and compassionate men. 1 counted it then and 1 consider it now to be an honor and a privilege to serve with such men. Therefore. I am monumen¬ tally disturbed at the nature and. tenor of criticism cur¬ rently being levelled at the force. To some of (he Canadian public ingeneral.and to politi¬ cal hay makers and sensa¬ tional journalists in particu¬ lar, 1 say “clean-up your own acta.” How dare you discred¬ it. by inference, the whole of the best police force in the world! Your apprehended dangers spring not from these obedient ser\\ants, who are sworn to pursue their orders “faithfully, diligently and impartially, without fear, favor or affection of or towards any person.” Sharp¬ en your barbs and direct your shafts Inward for you are the appropriate Urgets of your own vinification! Did Canada not have capi¬ tal punishment for murder of peace officer (and certain others) as a law of the land? Do you honestly believe that some political hacks have the right to subvert or frustrate such laws with impunity? Where were your charges of malfeasance against the usurpers of such authority? Where, in the statutes of this great land, do we find lawful exclusion of certain individu¬ als from security investiga¬ tion? Or from the full force and effect of our “laws?” (I use quotation marks because Black’s definition of “law” states, “That which must be obeyed and followed by citi¬ zens, subject to sanctions or legal con.sequcnces” — and 1 realize that that interprets tion is not demonstrably ap¬ propriate in Canada.) Properly constituted police forces must, by the very na¬ ture of the object of Jjteir existence be given latitude in the performance of their duties. When <his latitude is taken to proven excess, by all means call Jhe perpetrators to account. But, in the name of justice you so vociferously se^, make sure you have the perp^ators and even then do not blindly ^mear and smirch the reputations of all the members of any police force. The RCMP may have .some members who are brutal, some who are dishonest, some who are incompetent and some who are over-zeal¬ ous. (And I am the last to deny the possibility that my peers might have included me in some of these cate gories.) But if the RCMP does have them they occur in nowhere near the proportions that those of similar beht occur in any other of the vari¬ ety of disparate organiza¬ tions in which I’ve worked, both tefore and since. And during my service in the RCMP those members who were inclined along such lines did not escape either notice or punishment. We. the citizens of Canada, are fortunate beyond our un¬ derstanding in the calibre of the organizations, men and women who enforce our laws. Faultless they are not. Supe¬ rior they most certainly are, by any criteria you care to impose. 4. ■* My pride in the RC:MP re¬ mains undiminished, i have only to look at those who at¬ tack them to know my pride IS justified.
