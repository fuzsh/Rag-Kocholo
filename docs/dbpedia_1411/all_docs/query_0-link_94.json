        "text": "The personnel papers have been flying this month, as the majority staff on the House Resources Committee has acquired 10 new faces for its stable of legislative talent.\n\nLongtime Rep. Richard Pombo (R-Calif.) aide and campaign manager Steve Ding becomes chief of staff for the committee.\n\nDing, who spent nine years as chief of staff in the Golden State Congressman’s personal office, earlier worked for then-state Sen. John Doolittle (R). He is a 1986 graduate of Chico State University.\n\nAfter a stint heading up the government relations department for Feld Entertainment, Todd Willens returns to the Hill as the panel’s senior policy director.\n\nA former legislative director for Pombo, Willens is an alumnus of the University of California at Los Angeles.\n\nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee staffer Dan Kish has returned to the House to serve as senior adviser on the committee. The onetime chief of staff of the Resources panel under then-Chairman Don Young (R-Alaska) has also served as the panel’s minority staff director.\n\nNew Chief Financial Officer Lisa Wallace arrives at the committee after eight years in the office of Rep. George Radanovich (R-Calif.), where she was administrative assistant.\n\nVince Sampson, former vice president for public affairs at the Association for Competitive Technology, becomes deputy chief counsel.\n\nHailing from Las Vegas, Sampson attended UCLA before going on to receive a master’s in labor and employment law from the Georgetown University Law Center. He holds a law degree from the Santa Clara University School of Law.\n\nCommunications Director Doug Heye has moved over from the press shop in Pombo’s personal office. A Tar Heel State native, Heye has also worked on the Senate campaigns of former North Carolina GOP Sens. Lauch Faircloth and Jesse Helms. He is a member of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s class of 1994.\n\nMatt Miller, recently executive director for the House Western Caucus and a former senior legislative assistant to both Pombo and then-Rep. Helen Chenoweth (R-Idaho), has become professional staff member.\n\nA native of Fresno, Calif., Miller received a 1996 bachelor’s from the University of California at Santa Barbara.\n\nFormer Radanovich spinner Brian Kennedy joins as press secretary.\n\nA veteran of two Radanovich re-election campaigns, Kennedy hails from New Jersey. He holds a 1998 bachelor’s from the College of the Holy Cross.\n\nIllinois native Tom Brierton also comes on board as professional staff member. A onetime staff director to the Government Reform subcommittee on the census, Brierton has also served as senior policy analyst and district representative to Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.).\n\nHe received a bachelor’s from Northern Illinois University in 1992.\n\nRounding out the lineup is Kurt Christensen, who, after a two-year hiatus, has rejoined the panel as professional staff member. Previously, Christensen was an aide to then-Rep. Ron Marlenee (R-Mont.) and worked for the Council on Environmental Quality in the Reagan administration.\n\nChristensen, who can list professional forester on his resume, earned a bachelor’s in forest management from West Virginia University in 1979."
