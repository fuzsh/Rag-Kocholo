        "text": "President Bush said today that flag burning was ''dead wrong,'' and lawmakers lined up on Capitol Hill to denounce the Supreme Court ruling that such acts of protest were a protected form of free speech.\n\nAt an appearance in New York today, Mr. Bush said he understood the ''legal basis'' for the Court's ruling on Wednesday, ''and as President of the United States I will see that the law of the land is fully supported.'' He added, ''But I have to give you my personal, emotional response - flag burning is wrong, dead wrong, and the flag of the United States is very, very special.'' His comments drew sustained applause.\n\nIn Washington, many members of the House and Senate vowed to press for a constitutional amendment to overturn the ruling. Such an amendment would need the votes of two-thirds of the House and Senate and the approval of 38 of the 50 state legislatures.\n\nIn the House of Representatives, Democrats and Republicans took turns at the microphone assailing the Court in ever more passionate terms. Representative Ron Marlenee, Republican of Montana, evoked the men portrayed in the Marine Corps War Memorial raising the flag over Iwo Jima and declared, ''Yesterday those six brave soldiers were symbolically shot in the back.'' Court 'Humiliated' the Flag\n\nRepresentative Doug Applegate, Democrat of Ohio, said the Court had ''humiliated'' the flag and demanded, ''Are they going to allow fornication in Times Square at high noon?''\n\nAt his regular news conference this morning, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said, ''Americans look on the burning of the American flag with abhorrence, and it is deeply offensive to virtually all Americans, and it will be a difficult matter for them to understand how it can be justified under any circumstances.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
