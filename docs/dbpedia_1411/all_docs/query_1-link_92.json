        "text": "Wilderness is always a hot topic in Montana … and ripe for lampooning.\n\nIn the 1980s, U.S. Rep. Ron Marlenee was the constant flat tire.\n\nMontana wilderness proposals have long been contentious issues. The passage of a bill resulting from these hearings resulted in a veto by President Reagan.\n\nWhen U.S. Rep. Pat Williams introduced a wilderness bill, Rep. Ron Marlenee was ready to gut it.\n\nSen. John Melcher had a hard time getting off the fence on Williams’s wilderness bill. Meanwhile, Sen. Baucus introduced his own proposal.\n\nAs Baucus, Williams and Melcher cooked up a wilderness bill, Marlenee sat ready to give it a hatchet job.\n\nSenators Baucus and Burns tried to get a wilderness bill passed in 1991. Rep. Marlenee worked to put the stops to it.\n\nLater in the 1990s, Sen. Conrad Burns blocked proposed wilderness legislation."
