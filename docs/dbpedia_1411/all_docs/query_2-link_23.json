Instead of looking to a sales tax, which would provide out-of-state corporations with tax breaks at the expense of Montanans, Jarvis suggested legislators look at true tax reform. That includes: A 5-mill levy on intangible property such as stocks and bonds, which would raise $65 million a year .\n\nA 4 percent business inventory tax, which would raise $8 million. Limiting to $20,000 the amount of federal taxes people can deduct on their state income taxes, which would raise $68 million. Jarvis said tax breaks granted by the Legislature during the 1980s have cut $256 million from the current 1992-93 budget. The average Montanan got a few dollars' savings from some of the breaks, but millions of dollars in savings were shipped out of state, he said.

Hedges received 28 votes. Republican Party members met in Scobey on Saturday to choose three nominees, whose names were put before the nine county commissioners from Sheridan, Daniels and Roosevelt counties. The votes were weighted, based on county population and the votes cast in each county for Nathe last November .\n\nBrenden, in a phone interview from Plentywood, said he was leaving Monday afternoon for Helena. The new responsibility is \"awesome in the sense that I am entering the last part of the ball game. Technically, it is halftime. This is a humbling experience and I will need all the help I can get to do the job.\" Brenden said he was unsure if he would receive Nathe's committee appointments. \"I don't know,\" he said .\n\n\"I have not spoken to either Van Valkenburg or Crippen. I plan to leave today.\" Sen. Fred Van Valkenburg is president of the Senate, while Sen. Bruce Crippen, R-Billings, is Senate minority leader. 9999 A service of The Senate District 10 becomes Senate District 45 .\n\nSince the new district excludes Daniels County where Brenden lives, he cannot run for that seat State law requires a lawmaker to live within his or her district if the boundary crosses county lines.

The Montana Legislature was in recess from Wednesday morning to Monday afternoon. Brenden was in agreement with how the budgeting process had operated in the first half of the session .\n\nThe joint appropriations subcommittees were working toward a $100 million reduction in spending, while $100 million in new tax revenue was yet to come forth to meet the estimated $215 million revenue shortfall for the coming biennium. \"Absolutely,\" Brenden responded. \"The people are demanding it. The Legislature is a reflection of the body politic.\" Brenden admitted to being a feisty political adversary. \"Yes, when it comes to protecting Montana's interest,\" he said .\n\n\"On the planning council, I did not want others taking Montana's water. It would have affected the (Columbia Falls) aluminum plant Or draining the reservoirs would have affected our fish and wildlife and our grain farmers, who ship wheat on the barges.\" Brenden frequently was in the minority on the NWPPC and was criticized for taking time off to plant crops and not taking part in the council's hearings. Brenden said that while he was party chairman \"it was my job to In an interview, Cisneros said he found \"a mentality\" when he took over HUD that employees would \"tell people why they hadn't complied with guidelines, instead of helping them fix what they need to fix.\" \"We're trying to find new ways to communicate with the communities in a spirit of helpfulness,\" he said. \"I think that difference in approach will make all the difference.\" In the pipeline is $11.5 billion for building more homes for low-income families and for long-term repair and HELENA (AP)-Republican John Brenden, a Scobey farmer appointed to the state Senate on Monday, will not be able to hold the seat beyond next year. Because the Senate vacancy occurred more than 85 days before the November 1994 general election, the seat will be up for grabs on that ballot .\n\nHowever, that election will be based on the new plan redrawing legislative districts, in which take on the other party, to get the backing, the tools to do that.\" He said being a senator \"was a different job. We must all try to solve the real problems we have.\" Brenden said he wanted to take a look at the sales tax bills being offered and the efforts to balance the budget. He promised to consult his constituents, Republican Gov. Marc Racicot's administration and other legislators. Brenden was bom and raised on a farm near Scobey, where his children now operate the farm .\n\nHe grad- renovation of public housing projects. About $2.5 billion is trapped at HUD by regulations governing the HOME Investment Partnership Program, designed to build more homes for low-income families. Another $6 billion is in the hands of local housing authorities, who have yet to spend it on public housing repair; an additional $3 billion, for the same purpose, is at HUD, waiting to be sent out. \"The whole system Just takes more time than it should. This is the longstanding complaint that we Settlement reached in age bias case Administration battles HUD bureaucracy WASHINGTON (AP) A $20 million settlement was reached in an age bias case on behalf of about 900 former McDonnell Douglas employees who lost jobs during company cutbacks, federal officials said Monday .\n\nThe settlement was filed Monday in federal court in St. Louis, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission announced. It covers older workers who were laid off or forced to retire between July 1990 and May 1991, when the aircraft manufacturer reduced its work force after the federal government canceled the A-12 aircraft program. EEOC contended that McDonnell Douglas laid off non-union workers who were 55 and older because of their age, a violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 .\n\nUnder the settlement, McDonnell Douglas admitted no wrongdoing. The settlement includes payments of $10 million, or about $9,500 each, to affected workers, pension enhancements of $10.1 million and 200 jobs, to be allocated among the workers, EEOC said. \"We understand that tough economic times require tough workforce reductions, but business must understand that age cannot be a factor determining these reductions,\" said EEOC Chairman Evan J. Kemp Jr. In a statement, McDonnell Douglas said it decided to settle the case because \"it was in everyone's best interest to resolve this matter and avoid the costly and time-consuming litigation that the complicated nature of this case would have involved.\" The 200 jobs, with a term of at least four years, would be at the McDonnell Douglas Technical Service Company .\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) More than $11 billion for low-income housing programs is trapped in a bureaucratic logjam so tight that even the Clinton administration is struggling to set the money free. Now members of Congress are asking, loudly, what's taking so long to put the money to use in cities that needed it yesterday. \"Just what, exactly, is the delay?\" Rep. Louis Stokes, D-Ohio, asked Housing Secretary Henry Cis-neros during a recent House appropriations hearing. ."
