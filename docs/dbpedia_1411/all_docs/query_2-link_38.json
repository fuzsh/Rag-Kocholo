And yet, although the land bears the mark of countless centuries, the history of its people is new. There are no ancient ruins here to attest to vanished civilizations. There are only the teepee rings of Indians, lost arrowheads and hammers, the marks of Indian travel on the prairie ground, the deserted and weatherbeaten shacks of homesteaders, to remind us of those who were here before. In the following pages we are trying to tell, in words and pictures, as much as limited space will enable us to tell of the history of the Homesteaders Golden Jubilee area, which generally is now Daniels County and some of the area sur- rounding, including part of Canada. This book is the combined effort of many people, who have done their best to present a colorful and accurate account of the days that used to be, and the days that are. - Since human memory is a variable and unreliable thing, and some errors are inevitably copied from previous historical accounts, this book will undoubted- ly have many errors. Much is not included that should be, and some things are possibly included that should not be. From the hundreds of pictures that were submitted we have tried to select those we thought would be of the greatest interest to the most people, and most representative of each community. Many could not be included because of in- adequate identification, poor reproductive quality, or because there simply was not room for even all of the good ones. To all of those people who submitted pictures and write-ups, whether they could be used or not, we give our profound thanks. They all helped give us a better understanding of life as it was in this area, and this information was used in compiling this history. Dedication As indicated on the cover, this book is dedicated to the pioneers and home- steaders—with particular respects to those who “stuck it out” and made these northeastern Montana prairies home country; who helped to establish institutions, raised families, nurtured faith in their heritage of freedom, and today still survive here—always willing to lend a hand, in the best spirit of those old days on these prairies when every abode was a hotel, restaurant and first aid station to the wayfarer. Published at Scobey, Montana, A.D., 1963 by the HOMESTEADERS GOLDEN JUBILEE ASSOCIATION Dorothy Rustebakke, Editorial Supervisor ge Af THE EARLIEST OF ALL This vast and inspiring prairie was once populated by one -of the largest, boldest, most picturesque, most individualistic and iron-willed of all of the northern Indian tribes—the Assini- boines (stone-boilers). The tribe received its name because of its practice of heating water by dropping heated stones into the pot. The Assiniboines, who were once lords and masters of the most prodigious realm on the American continent, are now con- siderably reduced both in numbers and holdings. Their once- huge domaine, extending from the Missouri River to the Saskat- chewan River in northern Canada, has now shrunk to small reservations. The number of people in the tribe has fallen from an estimated 28,099 in the early 1800's to less than 4,000 today. In Daniels County the history of Indian activity is quite re- cent. In many ,laces the stone teepee rings of the Assiniboines are plainly isible where the native sod has not been turned. Many hamn er heads, arrow heads, and other relics are still found. The In«.an trail across the county from the Yellowstone river to the Woody mountains-in Canada was used for decades. The deep travois and wagon wheel ruts can still be seen in parts of western Daniels County. The trail was much in use during the early homestead days, with Indians still following this route during the 1920’s. It was on this trail, near the present town of Scobey, that Chief Sitting Bull and his Sioux warriors surrendered to General Miles, and were taken to a reservation. Chief Sitting Bull and his warriors had moved to Canada fearing punishment after their successful battle against the 7th U. S. Cavalry under General Custer. In overcoming the difficulties of living and rearing their fami- lies in our rigorous northern climate the Assiniboines displayed a high sense of personal responsibility and initiative that mod- ern civilization could well note. Long before horses were introduced to the American con- tinent the Assiniboines used dogs as beasts of burden. Each family owned several, which were hitched to poles to form a travois. In this way belongings could be dragged about as the tribe followed the buffalo herds. Foot travel with dogs was slow, and contacts with other tribes were slight. When horses were acquired the Assiniboines aften engaged in pony raids on the Blackfoot and Gros Ventre tribes on the west and the Crows and Sioux of the south. In addition to bows and arrows, the Assiniboines carried spears and stone- headed clubs for close fighting. Most carried shields of painted buffalo hide, treated to become tough enough to turn aside an arrow and sometimes a bullet. These shields, which were thought to give their owners supernatural protection in battle, rested be- side the warriors in their graves. ; Before they had horses the Assiniboines hunted buffalo by calling them into a trap where they could be surrounded and killed, or by stampeding them over a cliff. After horses were procured the favorite method of hunting was to charge into a herd and ride alongside the stampeding animals, killing them with arrows. This required considerable skill. The introduction of fire arms was stimulated when, in 1829, Fort Union was established by the American Fur Company at the confluence of the Yellowstone and Missouri rivers. Order was maintained in the Assiniboine camp by a military society composed of warriors. The chief could express his wishes, but could not enforce them unless the society agreed. The principal gods were Sun and Thunder, regarded to be manifestations of the Great Spirit, ruler of everything. Both re- ceived worship in the sun dance festival. Funeral rites were quite elaborate, with the dead usually be- ing placed in the branches of a tree or on a scaffold. When the bodies would decay and fall the’ relatives would bury the bones. The smallpox epidemics of 1780 and 1837 almost exterminated the tribe, and were largely responsible for its reduction in num- bers. Because of their friendliness toward the whites, the Assini- boines are probably not as well known to historians as some other tribes. No troops have ever been needed against them. They committed fewer depredations against the whites in the fur trade, cattle ranching, and early homesteading periods’ than any other tribe. History should give this long neglected credit to the Assiniboines, the earliest residents of all. The First White Man “The level, fertile, open and exceedingly beautiful plains” of northeastern Montana, to use the words of Captain Clark of the Lewis and Clark expedition, were first viewed by white men in the year of 1805, when the expedition visited the area on its historic exploration trip. Captain Clark ascended several miles of what he termed to be a “bold and beautiful stream,” which is now known by the present name of Poplar River. This his- toric visit is entered on the official logged records of the expedi- tion on Friday, May 3, 1805. The northeastern Montana prairies were a paradise for wild life, according to the journals of the Lewis and Clark expedition. Vast herds of buffalo, elk, deer, antelope “Surrounded” the party according to Captain Lewis. The buffalo, particularly the bulls, were so tame that they would scarcely make way for the party to pass. The elk were also very tame. The largest elk and the largest grizzly bear of which the expedition made record were found in the area. The elk measured 5’3” from the tip of the hoof to the top of the front shoulder. The grizzly weighed be- tween five and six hundred pounds, was 311’ around the neck and 8'7” from the nose to the tip of the tail. In addition to these animals the expedition made account of many big horn sheep, brown bear, white bear, beaver, geese, swans, ducks, wolves, coyotes, and prairie rodents. | | | THE FUR TRADE Until well into the 19th century the fur trade was the prin- cipal business of this territory. As elsewhere in the United States, the trapper and trader preceded the cattleman and the frontier farmer. In 1829 the American Fur Company, under the powerful leadership of John Jacob Astor, established a trading post, Fort Union, on’ the Missouri at the mouth of the Yellowstone, river, This was a stockaded post with bastions, and was constructed to withstand attacks by strong war parties of Indians. This was the first white outpost in what is now Montana and was located approximately 85 miles southeast of Scobey. In 1833 the company had listed on its payroll at Fort Union 12 clerks and 129 men. Here the trades of tailer, gunsmith, blacksmith, tinner, cooper, carter, hunter and trapper were rep-' resented. Days OPEN The beef industry of Montana did not get going until about 1866, and the northern plains were at first ignored by the cat- tlemen because of the legendary bad winters. But with the In- dians restrained and the buffalo killed off (the last record of a buffalo kill in old Valley County was in 1885), the northern grassland began to look attractive to stockmen who needed a summer range. Stockmen from westetn Montana and from as far south as Texas began trailing cattle by the thousands to northeastern Montana to be “finished” before shipping. Cattlemen began to put pressure on Washington to open the Indian reserve, and in 1888 this was declared an unreserved pub- lic domaine. There were no provisions for selling or leasing the land. It was to be used, but not owned, by the ranchers. The brands of, several large ranches were soon to be found on the range. Some of northeastern Montana’s most respected, and also some of its most notorious residents came as cowboys and range bosses for the big cattle companies. By 1895 there was talk of irrigation and smaller farms north of the Missouri. But the area of what is now Daniels County At first most of fur hunting and trapping was done by white trappers. With the fall of beaver fur prices in the 1840’s the white trappers were no longer interested, and the trade was conducted mostly with the Assiniboine Indians. Each year the company sent out its Indian trade goods, stocking the stores with from fifteen to twenty thousand dollars worth of goods. The most popular items indicated in the Fort Union inventory in 1831 were awls, half axes, beads, hawk bells, blankets, combs, flannel shirts, pantaloons, kettles, lead, powder, gun worms, bar iron, rifle balls, gun flints, vermillion and coat buttons. Sugar and coffee also later became popular. Whiskey, although never authorized by law, was also a principal and lu- crative item of trade. The principal currency at the fort was buffalo robes. A robe was worth about $4. The price of coffee was $1 a pound. Brown sugar was the same. Calico was $1 a yard. An agent could real- ize 100 percent profit but the business expenses and hazards were immetise. The Indian trade at the post was conducted with much cere- mony. When a trading party approached the flag was hoisted and the cannon discharged to signal that trade was about to commence. Gifts were exchanged and the Indian guests were seated, fed and given drinks by the Company. This was followed by an exchange of oratory. After dispensing with the ceremonies trade began. When trading began only six or seven Indians were allowed in the store at any one time to prevent the situa- tion from getting out of hand. During the 1860’s much of the Indian trade came to be con- ducted at the army posts or by the authorized traders at the Indian agencies rather than the old trading posts. Fort Union was abandoned in 1867, and with the extermination of the buf- falo in the 1870’s and 1880’s the Indian fur trade disappeared entirely. —Compiled by Ben Shennum of the RANGE was a blank place on the map, bearing only the names of rivers and creeks, and the name Whiskey Buttes where the four buttes rise above the surrounding prairie. A few adventurous ranchers and land-seekers began to come into the area to settle. Among them were Canille Bonnabel, Tay- lor Green, the Tande family, Henry and Ole Shipstead, the Manternach family, the Joe Bonnes family, Bill Crone, Julian Erickson some of the Marlenees, Charles Woodley, Frank Hughes, Sr., and the colorful “Hominy” Thompson. The oldest white man born here (1904) and still lives here is Roger Von Kuster. They settled mostly along the Poplar river and it branches. Most of those on the Middle fork of this river raised cattle. Those on the west fork raised sheep. The settlers drove across the un- fenced range with horse and wagon to Poplar to buy their gro- ceries and supplies, to get their mail and to buy the lumber they needed to build their homes. Like later. settlers, they braved the dangers of severe win- ters and of prairie fires, and of outlaws. a THE EARLY OUTLAWS The existence of Fort Union, and later Fort Buford, created a need for horses. And the coming of settlers to northeastern Montana added to the need.’ This made horse ranching, and also horse rustling, a lucrative business. Some of the men who had come to Montana with the large herds of Texas cattle turned to horse rustkng, Unduobtedly some of them had been in trouble previously in the south or other areas. Drastic action of the vigilantes along the Missouri, and the Johnson County war of Wyoming, may also have contributed to making this the last outpost of the rustlers. JONES and NELSON “Red” Nelson was one of the early gang-leaders of the dis- trict. His name came from his flaming bushy beard and _ hair. He was known as a rustler and killer. In 1894 he freed two men from the Valley county jail at Glasgow, with some gun play. One of these men, by the name of Seffick, later became a mem- ber of the well known Dutch Henry gang. By the time Frank Jones, thought to be from Nevada, én- tered the picture Nelson already had a price on his head. The two men joined forces in 1899,-and carried on a busy rustling business in Montana, Saskatchewan and North Dakota. Later Nelson dropped out of the picture and another gang, known as the Jones Carlyle-Henry group, or the “Dutch” Henry Gang, was formed. DUTCH HENRY GANG Dutch Henry, who is still remembered by many of the old- timers, came to Montana with cattle trailed up from Texas. Early in his career he rode for a man called Dad Williams. It is said that he would get a bill of sale from Williams for 25 head of horses, then run off with a bunch more into the Dakotas or Canada and sell them. Finally Williams went broke. As many as 400 head of horses were stolen in one drive, hazed across the border into Canada, sold, restolen, and brought back to Mon- tana or the Dakotas to be resold. “Dutch” Henry, as his name indicates, was from Holland. His real name was Henry Jauch or Jeuch. He had two brothers, One of them, Chris, was a respectable rancher who would have nothing to do with his brothers’ illegal activities. The other, who was in the gang, was known as Coyote Pete. Among the other members of the gang were Duffy (a little ‘rishman), Tom Reed (who quit, and was later dragged to death by a horse), “Kid” Trailer, Frank Carlyle, Seffick, and Ernie Stines. Carlyle had been a Canadian Mounted Policeman before he turned to horse-stealing. He was also one of the gang leaders. Most of the local early settlers had no trouble with the out- laws, and on some occasions the rustlers were pursuaded to bring back horses they had stolen. Sometimes they “rustled up” nicat to present to homesteaders who had fed them. Many can recall having members of the outlaw gang stop for meals. They Were courteous to the women, and if they sought shelter and food at a homestead shack while the owner was away they left things as they found them. Named Town “Dutch Henry is credited with naming the town of Plenty- wood. According to the story he and his companions were camp- ing on a little creek. The cook was trying unsuccessfully to start a fire with damp buffalo chips. “Dutch” Henry suggested going two miles farther up the creek where there was “plenty wood.” The creek was thereafter called Plentywood creek, and when the town was established it took the name. Long after the other members of the gang had prices on their heads “Dutch” Henry was able to roam about in the open, and could go to town to buy supplies for the others. THE JONES SHOOTING Jones was an outlaw of the Jesse James type, being liberal and friendly with most people and leading a gang which oper- ated on a large scale only, never dealing in any petty thievery. The gang was known to have on hand as many as 600 or 700 head of stolen horses at one time, sometimes holding them for several months while the brands were healing and the herd was being enlarged. They they were trailed to North Dakota railroad shipping points. An intensive manhunt for Jones began shortly after: the Kid Curry gang, of which the law suspected the Jones gang was a branch, had staged a train holdup near the present site of Dod- son and made off with $40,000 or $50,000. In 1902 a group made up of Tom A, Davis, Bill Endersby, Elmer “Hominy” Thompson, Frank King and George LaPorte were deputized to round up the outlaws. King rode to Thompson’s shack near Whitetail to tell him the plans. The deputized ranchers were to make a circle around the outlaws while King was to ride to Canada to enlist the aid of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police, who would close in on the north and prevent them from crossing the border. Jones had seen King ride up to the Thompson abode, and climbed on the roof and heard every word. While King was en route to Canada Jones waylaid him and took him prisoner. The gang kept him for 14 days before releasing him. Many men were tempted by the big rewards. Jim Moore a barber and constable living at Culbertson, heard that Kid Trailer was at a dance near Redstone, and that there was a price of $800 on him. Moore made the capture. The dancers tried to pursuade him to allow Kid Trailer, who was the fiddler, stay to play for the dance, Mooré refused, and started out with sléigh and team for Glasgow. Jones, who was also at the dance, told the people that he would get some music for them. He overtook the constable and freed and took the constable’s fur overcoat and \\his horses. This later proved to be a fatal action. Two deputized possemen, looking for the reward money, posed as cowpunchers on the Si Merrill ranch in 1903, knowing that the outlaws had a hideout north of Scobey. After hunting cattle one stormy January day they stopped at the Tande ranch to spend the night. A short time later an- other rider came. Tande, knowing that the man was an out- law, tried to pursuade him to ridé on to the Timmons place, fearing there would be trouble. The outlaw, Frank Jones, stated that his horse was too tired to go on. The men spent the evening in quiet conversation, although Bird and Moran had recognized the fur coat and the horse Jones was riding as those stolen from Moore. The three men slept together on a large camp bed on the cabin floor—each with his hand on his gun. End of Jones Bird offered to make the flap-jacks for breakfast while the other men sat at the table. When Jones was off guard Bird grabbed up a .30-.30 rifle and ordered him to put up his hands. HOMESTEADERS GOLDEN JUBILEE AND DANIELS COUNTY FAIR Jones laid down his fork and suddenly threw himself over backward, drawing his gun as he fell. Bird shot him in the shoulder, with the bullet ranging down into his lungs, and Moran, who had his .45 under the table, shot with the bullet graz- ing Jones head. Jones was wrapped in bedding and covered with a big can- yas, and placed in a sleigh. The two deputies, accompanied by Andrew Tande, started for Poplar with the wounded man. On the way Jones told them reproachfully,“T knew right away who you fellows was, but I thought you'd give me a chance.” Jones died that afternoon at Give-Out Morgan spring, twenty niles. southeast of Scobey. The body was taken to Poplar. where George Robinson, now a Scobey resident, then working in a Poplar store, was called upon to identify the body of what the bounty-hunters had nus- takenly believed to be Carlyle. Ellen Scobey, daughter of Major C. R. A. Scobey after whom the town was named, insisted that the Indian police provide a clean shirt for Jones’ burial. Nearly a year after the Jones killing a big, red-headed man rode up to the Tande ranch and wanted to know thé details of the killing. After hearing the stery the man — Red Nelson, Jones’s one-time partner—disappeared again. Dutch Henry’s Fate? What happened to Dutch Henry is still not certain, as there are several reliable, but conflicting. accounts of how he met his death. The Mounties claim that he was killed in Canada—on two separate occasions. John A. Davis, who knew him well, positively identified the body of a murdered man found in a brush heap in Minnesota as “Dutch” Henry. He is also said to have been hanged in Mexico for his rustling activities, and his brother, Cris, is said to have believed this story. But it is also said that he married and lived peaceably until 1928 or 29, when he died in Stillwater, Minn., of a gunshot wound. “Kid” Trailer disappeared for a while but, it is said, later returned, reformed, and offered to pay for his past transgres- sions. PIGEON-TOED KID Back in the ranching days when the branding iron singed the hides of countless heads of stcok, men drifted into the country in search of unbranded horses and cattle, and as second choice took those which had brands that could readily be changed. One such man was the Pigeon-toed Kid, who operated his business by himself. He was despised by the other horse rust- lers because, unlike most of them, he was quarrelsome and cruel. He insisted on the burning the homes of his victims. The Kid stole some horses from Ole Shipstead. Schuyler “Sky” Small, sheriff of Valley County, took his two deputies, Sid Bennett and Hugh Calderwood, and went in search of him. George Baker, who lived at what was later the Wesley How- ard ranch, went to Glasgow to get some supplies for the Kid. Learning there was a reward out for the horse thief, he told the sheriff that there was to bea birthday party for the Pigeon- toed Kid at Bonnabell’s, and said he would ride ahead up to the house. If the Kid was there he would lead his horse to the post and tie it. If he was not there he would tie the horse in the barn. The officers watched with the aid of field glasses. Baker tied his horse in front of the house. Sid and Sky went inside. When the Kid saw Salderwood, whom he recognized, he went for his guns and Calderwood shot him. He died a few minutes later. TOM RYAN Another ouUdaw remembered by a few old-timers was Tom Ryan, who traveled about the country with a partner of the name of John Woodruff Tom Ryan, according to Ellis Hurst, an Outlook rancher who knew him, was a man who hated petty larceny. Empty mail bags laid around his cabin and he made no effort to hide them, If strangers approached the cabin Ryan met them with his guns on. He refused to hide, saying, “They're not going to find me hiding behind a bed or in the cellar.” Once Ryan came to the Hurst ranch to treat an injury he claimed to have received when his horse fell on him. Afterwards it was learned that the injury was a gunshot wound received in a bank robbery. He gave the money from this rebbery to a homesteader, ask- ing him to give it to some poor people. Mrs. Lon Desonia, whose home was a stopping-place for most travelers in the Redstone vicinity, declared that Ryan was the most gentleman-like man she ever knew. One time when she was chasing chickens he rode up and of- fered to fetch the chickens she wanted., She pointed out two, and he drew a pistol with each hand and shot the heads off of both of them at once. He also left a motherless colt with the Desonias for their unborn daughter (he was sure the child would be a girl). Mildred, the child, kept the horse for 29 years. We have no record of what finally happened to Tom Ryan. THE NORSE BROTHERS Nobody knows where the Norse brothers “hailed” from, but it’s no secret where they went. Where they went and why they went is the story. During the early days when Scobey was known as a “pretty rough” town, Ed Norse and his kid brother didn’t do much to improve the reputation of the booming and sprawling little city. Quite the contrary. It is said that it took Ed Norse to get the Scobey cemetrey started. No one has ever proved this one on him, but the first burial in the Scobey cemetery has been credited to him by people who were around the town at the time. A man met his death in 1916 by being shot on the main street of Scobey while passing from the saloons on the west side of the street to the pool hall on the east side. The gunplay didn’t happen in just the manner that the gunsmoke television western shows like to portray such incidents. No show-down in the mid- dle of the dusty street. In this case a shot rang out from between two of the saloons, and Scobey had the first candidate for its new cemetery. Ed Norse did not leave the Scobey territory immediately, but pursued his trade of rounding up horses and cattle. He did not own a ranch, however, and later drifted out of the Scobey terri- tory and went to North Dakota. There he shot and killed a man. This one they pinned on him, and he wound up his days as a “lifer” in the North Dakota State Penitentiary at Bismarck. That’s where the first Norse went. The Kid’s story is a lit- tle different. He also was self-employed in the cattle and horse- stealing business, doing pretty well in the territory west of Scobey. Like so many of the old-time badmen, there were those who would testify to his fairness and courtesy under most cir- cumstances. He was a chap of 21 years ,somewhat likeable in his own way. John Shennum, Sr., pioneer farmer of the Coal Creek com- munity, tells of counseling with the young outlaw, encouraging him to give up his thieving ways, and warning him that he would very likely get his neck straightened. For in those days little time was wasted in stringing up a horse thief. The Kid replied, “There is one thing that you can be sure of: they will never take me alive.” The Kid knew what he was talking about. Some time after this conversation the sheriff from Glasgow came looking for the Kid. The sheriff was riding one horse and leading another. He expected to find the Kid and bring him in. He found and arrested him in the true tradition of early day law enforcement. But the Kid had his own plans. At the first stop, when his hands were freed, he slipped a cyanide pill from his pocket into his mouth. They didn’t take him alive, but the sheriff did take him in—tied across the saddle. Nobody knows where the Norse brothers hailed from. But where they went is now history. ee FIRST FAMILIES The very first settlers in what is now Daniels County arrived about the turn of the century. They were ranchers, and in most cases they came because rangeland was becoming scarce in their previous locations. We do not have histories of all of the early families. Some left many years ago, and in other cases the living members MANTERNACH FAMILY It was a wild and lonesome country, full of antelopes and coyotes and dotted with the bones of the vanished buffalo, when John Manternach came from Velva, N. D., in 1900 to pick out a claim on Poplar Creek, three miles south of the present town of Scobey. He returned to Velva and brought his wife and 11 children back with him in the spring of 1901. He was also accompanied by the Joe Bonnes family of four. The trip across the prairie took eleven days. Two carloads of farm equipment and lumber were shipped to Poplar. The only others living on the Poplar Creek at that time were Bill Crone and Charlie Woodley. It was too late to plant a crop when they arrived, but John broke 20 acres for the next year’s crop and dug ditches for irri- gation. They built a house, which was first plastered with adobe and later with lime plaster. Wood was scarce and the coal mines had not yet started, so buffalo chips were used for fued. In 1902 John Manternach sowed 20 acres of oats to feed his 75 head of cattle and 50 head of horses. It was an open winter and the stock did well on the long prairie grass. In 1902 August Jevnager, Frank Marlenee and Henry and Ole Shipstead and the Tande family joined the small group of first settlers along the river. % el “| e io i The John Manternach family in 1901}.

We present in this chapter some of the information available on our first citizens who were here by 1905. For convenience of arrangement we are also including sketches of the husbands and wives of these settlers, even though the latter may have arrived at later dates. Tragedy struck the Manternach family in that year when young Henry was dragged to death by a broncho. As there was no cemetery he was buried on a hill on the Manternach ranch. Three Manternach children, Bill, Gertie and Oscar, attended a school located where the present Earl Norman farm is. Flor- ence Spafford, who later became Mrs, George Robinson, was the teacher. ; The winter of 1906-1907, one of the hardest winters ever known in this area, resulted in a loss of 300 head of cattle for the Manternachs because of scab, cold weather and a feed short- age. Only about 35 head were saved. Al Tande and Frank Manternach plowed snow on about two thousand acres so that the cattle could follow and eat the grass. According to the late Irrank Manternach there was snow from November 8 until June, and it stormed continually from November until April. In Meb- ruary alone, he claimed, it stormed 56 days! He also claimed that in the fall John Manternach went east to ship cattle, and baught three tons of barbed wire, which the hungry cattle ate before spring! One time, an assessor from Valley county came out to assess the Manternachs. He asked John how many cattle he had. John said 150. , “Mr. Manternach,” said the assessor, “You haven't given half your cattle. I’ll assess you for twice that many.’ “Go ahead,” agreed Mr. Manternach. “You didn’t get half of them then.” Both Mr. and Mrs. John Manternach died in 1918 while their sons Bill and Oscar were fighting in France in World War I. Of the 11 children born to the John Manternach family, only three are living today. They are Mrs. Gertie Hansen, Wolf Point; Mrs. Bill (Lizzie) Downing, Central Valley, Calif.; and Mrs. Augusta Jevnager, Billings, Mont. Two Manternach boys who spent their lives in Daniels County, and were well-known citizens,“were Frank, and Oscar or “Whoop”. Frank was 22 years old when he came with his father in 1901, and in 1905 he squatted on his own homestead. He hoped to be a rancher, but when the country began to fill up with settlers he turned to mixed farming instead. Frank married Esther Chelgren in 1915, and one of their three boys, Dale, is farming the home place. Frank died in 1950. Oscar, better known as “Whoop,” was also a well-known citizen of the community. He received his nickname in the 30’s, when he called many of the lively dances at the old Odd Fel- lows Hall in Scobey. While dancing :-he would stamp the floor vigorously and let out a “whoop-tee-do.” His widow, Bertha, is a Scobey resident. ” MANSFIELD DANIELS Mansfield Daniels, for whom this county was named, came from Iowa in 1896 to settle in Poplar. He became identified there with the government services as a carpenter, and his wife served as a government nurse at the Fort Peck agency. After making a trip north to the present site of Old Scobey in 1901 he conceived the idea of starting in the ranching busi- HOMESTEADERS GOLDEN Mansfield Daniels, the first community builder in what is now Scobey area. He painted on a broad canvas, but was heart- broken when the rails would not come down to the town he founded. ness. -He pursuaded his brother-in-law, Jake Timmons, to come from Towa as partner and manager in the new enterprise. He evidenced his faith in this area when in 1912 he built a beautfiul home on the west bank of the Poplar river at a cost of $20,000. Every bit of the material had to be freighted sixty miles overland from Poplar. The old mansion had waterworks, fix- tures for gas lighting, a ballroom, and a total of more than 20 well-finished rooms. He and Jake Timmons started a store at Old Scobey. He asked his friend and associate, Charles Robert Anderson Scobey, who was Indian Agent for the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, to obtain a post office for the fledgling town. He named the post office after Scobey. Originally prospects were entertained for the building of the railroad from Poplar to the location of Old Scobey. But the program was changed, and the town was moved. Daniels was known as a big-hearted frontiersman who was always willing to lend a hand to those in need. He died on April 15, 1919. Services were held in Old Scobey. When the county was formed it was named Daniels County in his memory. JACOB C, TIMMONS Jake Timmons of Iowa brought his wife and daughter Blanche to Old Scobey in 1901, to ranch in partnership with his brother-in-law, Mansfield Daniels. They later started a general store, and owned and operatec a blacksmith shop, rooming and boarding house, implement shop, livery barn, undertaking parlor and real estate business. Many years later settlers spent their first night in this county at the Timmons and Daniels Hotel. Seeing the need for water conservation, Daniels and Tim- mons dammed the Poplar river with twigs and brush, storing enough water to flood many acres of hay land. When it became apparent that East Scobey was actually to be the real town Jake Timmons was unfaltering in his efforts to build up the new place. He was secretary for the old Commer- cial Club and also was chairman of the board of county commis- sioners for Sheridan county before Daniels was created. Adele Timmons Daniels, first wife of Mansfield A. Daniels, and sister of Jake Timmons. She died in 1907. In 1909 Mr. Daniels married Mable Brooks. JUBILEE AND DANIELS COUNTY FAIR LOTTIE PARSHALL Lottie Parshall was one of the first citizens of Old Scobey, Born in Poplar of Indian and French parentage, she was or- phaned at an early age and raised by Mr. and Mrs. Mansfield Daniels. She also spent much time with Mrs. Daniels’ brother and his wife, Jake and Mrs. Timmons, who were then living in Towa. She came here with the Timmons family in 1902, and often stayed with them. She found life in Old Scobey busy and en- joyable. Other children in the area were the Manternachs, the Marlenees and the Tandes. Because her mother was an Assiniboine, Miss Parshall re- ceived land on the Fort Peck Reservation. She traded this for a farm southeast of Scobey. She was one of Scobey’s first telephone operators and also. worked for several years as a clerk in the post office. She still is a resident of Scobey. TANDE FAMILY Andrew and Helene Tande left their home in Minnesota to move by covered wagon to the Williston, N. D., area in 1890. When the influx of new settlers to that area made rangeland for their cattle scarce they moved with their family to the Sco- Five children of the Tande family that came to the Scobey area in 1902.

Albert is deceased. . bey vicinity in 1902, starting their ranch three and one-half miles northwest of Scobey. They lived in two tents until a house could be built. Later Andrew Tande also started a store and sold supplies to the new settlers. ; As was customary in the early days, the Tandes gave food and shelter to anybody who happened along. Sometimes their guests were well known outlaws, but no questions were ever asked and they were never molested. In 1903 the notorious outlaw Frank Jones was shot in the Tande kitchen by two deputy sheriffs while he was eating breakfast. An account of this shooting in the section on early- day outlaws. AL TANDE The late Al Tande hauled mail from Poplar to Scobey it: 1906, making one trip a week. He started a stage line in 1910, charging travelers $15 for the round trip, which took two days. He helped new settlers. locate claims, and with a four horse outfit he would plow a furrow around the squatter’s claim. This was the only method of surveying until Harry Gibbs was brought out to survey the claims in 1912. Al Tande claimed he had located as many as 75 settlers, many of them in the Ukranian community north of Scobey. HOMESTEADERS GOLDEN JUBILEE AND DANIELS COUNTY FAIR In 1914 he went to Tande (now known as Peerless), where he had the livery, hotel and blacksmith business. Jim Collins was his blacksmith. He moved back to the farm in 1919, and in 1920 estbalished a dance hall and swimming area, known for many years as Tande’s Beach. As a young man he was adept at riding, roping and shooting, and gained a reputation through roping coyotes (and at least on one occasion a wolf) on the open range. He married Miss Bertina Lien in 1910 at Glasgow, and to this union were born a son, Robert, now of Scobey, and three daughters, Mrs. Wilfred (Ruth) Nelson, Mrs. Beatrice Johnson, and Mrs, Ed (Lucille) Koser, all of Whitefish. Mirs. Tande also lives at Whitefish. MR, and MRS. CLAUDE TANDE Claude Lande still recalls helping his father bring his cattle to the Scobey area from their ranch near Williston in May, 1903. A May blizzard made it necessary for them to seek shelter in the breaks north of Culbertson, and several cattle were lost. Later he learned that the same blizzard had taken a heavy toll of sheep in this area. Another blizzard, in the winter of 1906-07, also caused a heavy loss of cattle. Joe Bonnes lost 100 head of sheep when they drifted over a cutbank south of the present Alvah Shaw place. He also recalls night-herding cattle, and trying to hold them during electric storms. Sometimes they stampeded and scattered all over the country. Mr. and Mrs. Claude Tande in 1962. He came in 1902. She came in 1908. They are still here. On Jan. 3, 1910, Claude Lande married Clara Nelson at Glas- gow, Mont. Clara was a homesteader-school teacher, who had come from Illinois with her family to take up homesteads on the other side of the Missouri river, south of Poplar. Her father, two sis- ters, and herself each filed claim on 160 acres and built their shacks on adjoining corners to be close together. Mr. Jevnager pursuaded her to leave her homestead to teach at the Bonnes school in 1908. This was held in a shack on the Bonnes place. Her pupils included Oscar and Gertrude Manter- nach, Ethel, Cecil and Leonard Marlenee, the Javenager girls, two Bonnes children. The next year she taught at the Hughes school, where her pupils were Clara Tande, the Colby children, Stella Hughes and Louise Davis. School was held during the summer months, and was dis- missed when the weather became too cold in the fall. Cow chips were used for fuel. Mr. and Mrs. Tande are the parents of two children, Ronald of Scobey and Mrs. Johu Berry of McLean, Virginia. 9 During the past year Mir. Tande has been spending much of his time at the Lutheran Retirement Tlome in Wolf Point. Mrs. ‘Vande lives in Scobey. MR. and MRS. J. M. (Mac) DRUMMOND Another member of the Tande family is Nora Drummond, Who was about 13 when the family moved to the Scobey area. School was a problem in those days, and Nora attended school in Poplar during the winter months, and at local schools during the summer. One school she attended was in the stone house once occupied by Charles Woodley. The walls of the house still stand at Old Scobey. Mrs. Woodley was the teacher. Later the Woodleys built a two-story house and they used the upstairs as a school and lived downstairs. This school was attended by the Manter- nachs, Marlenees. Bonneses, Blanche Timmons and Frank, Daisy and Dot Hughes. The children rode horseback to school. Another school was in a granery by the Hughes place. Later the Hughes school was built. Mrs. J. M. “Mac” Drummond remembers that her father had a hired man in North Dakota, known as “Kid” Traylor. One day it was discovered that the “Kid” had been stealing wine from her father’s cellar. “Tf vou don’t change your ways you are going to become an outlaw,” her mother warned him. - The prophesy came true, for soon afterwards “Kid” Traylor became a well-known member of the Dutch Henry gang. About 60 miles from Williston, on the trip to the new ranch, the parents had to leave the children at a cattle camp while they returned to Williston on business. pres ~ * ‘ Ps 4 * e wx 4 Maes Nora and Mac Drummond, also still here. She came in 1902 and Mac came in 1909. While the children were waiting a group of outlaws stopped at the camp to corral their horses. The girls cooked dinner for them and received high praise for their cooking. “The outlaws were always polite to women,” Mrs. Drummond says. They often stopped at the Tande ranch to corral their horses. : Dances were the chief amusement of the young people of the day. They were held at various homes—with the furniture car- ried out to make more room. People came from miles around and danced until daylight, when they ate breakfast and went home. Sometimes they danced at Albert Tande’s store, with the counters pushed against the wall. See First Airplane A trip to Medicine Lake on July 4, 1911, to see their first airplane, is remembered by Mrs. Drummond. The Mose Ting- leys, the Marlenees and others also went, all riding on a wagon reach, and camping along the way. HOMESTEADERS GOLDEN The airplane, which was little more than a bunch of bamboo sticks with a motor, belonged to a man known as “Lucky Bob\". It flew for about a quarter of a mile, about 100 feet high. On the plains it was odd enough at that time to see an auto— to say nothing of an airplane! In June, 1912, Nora Tande was married to Mac Drummond, who had come to this area in 1909. Mac Drummond was raised in North Dakota and Saskatchewan, and worked as a black- smith at Dundurn, Sask.. for three years before coming here. He homestcaded 15 miles northwest of Scobey on the Middle- fork, and moved to Scobey two years ago. In the early days he was known as a fiddler, and played for many dances. Once Mac came down with a severe case of smallpox. He was kept isolated in a tin bunkhouse on the Tande place, which was almost unbearably hot in the July sun. Nobody was allowed near him except Dr. Belljea, an old doctor from Williston who had taken out a homestead south of Flaxville, and a Mrs. Page, a homestead nurse, alsd from Williston, who took care of him. The doctor died a few years later, from infection, after per- forming an operation on himself. One time when Albert Tande had pneumonia, Mac Drum- mond rode to Plentywood to get the doctor. The doctor headed for Scobey in his Model T, and the roads were so muddy that Mac, on horseback, got back as soon as the doctor. MRS. OSCAR (Clara Tande) TORKELSON Mrs. Torkelson was the youngest of the Tande children, and was only a baby when the family came here. She recalls that gopher hunting was a favorite entertainment for the early-day children, and she still has a scar on her knee to prove that gophers were not the only things to get caught in the trap. The children had to work, too, and when her father put up hay on the site where Scobey now stands she and the other chil- dren had to tramp it down.

Benton, and who first homesteaded at Big Sandy. He took a homestead:on the Middlefork in 1904, and then moved farther up the river. In 1924 they moved to Big Sandy, going by wagon and trailing the cattle. Mrs. Tingley still lives at Big Sandy. 10 In 1901 Henry and Ole, who had saved about $2500 and had a horse apiece, bought a wagon, hitched up their horses, and headed for the rich and unsettled grasslands of northeastern Montana. They wound up just south of Whiskey Buttes (Four Buttes). They spent the winter there, but did not like the location, and moved to the West Fork of the Poplar river in the spring. The only other rancher on the West Fork was Taylor Green. The Shipsteads found the new location ideal for sheep raising as the grass was tall and there was plenty of range and water. They operated their sheep ranch for ten years. Then Ole sold out his interests and went into farming. Henry added cattle to his ranching and in 1945 sold out his sheep, continuing to raise cattle and grain until his death. When homesteaders came into the country, fencing up the range, it is said that Henry often gave a helping’ hand to the newcomers, hiring them to work on his ranch in preference to drifters. He also gave his herders orders ta keep his sheep off of the homesteaders’ property. Henry, over the years, became one of the wealthiest men in the county. In addition to extensive ranch holdings, he was at One time a stockholder in banks in Roosevelt and Valley counties, and in the Sherman Hotel in Wolf Point. He was the major contributor to the establishment of the Faith Lutheran Home in Wolf Point. He was a bachelor until his death. A brother, Ole, married and had a family of five children. Two sons, James and Milton, still live here and operate some The daughters, Eunice of the old Shipstead ranch properties. (at Nashua) and Gladys, ‘live elsewhere. HOMESTEADERS GOLDEN JUBILEE AND DANIELS COUNTY FAIR OSCAR SHIPSTEAD Oscar Shipstead, who still lives on his farm in the Silver Star conunuuity, came to work in the Fort Benton and Judith Basin areas of Montana in 1895. In 1903, at the suggestion of Henry and Ole, he struck out with team and wagon and some extra horses to join them on the West Fork. Hlenry and Ole had only three horses they could work in harness. Oscar had more horses, so he did the mowing, break- ing two or three horses on the mower. In 1904, homesick for his old range, Oscar sold his horses to his brothers and went back to the Judlith Basin. There he bought a bunch of horses froma sheep rancher who needed money and brought them back to Henry and Ole, and he decided to stay, too. “I was always after adventure and finding something new. Henry and Ole wanted to stay put and work,” he states. Oscar and Rosie Shipstead, still here. On one occasion he was fixing dinner for himself when a rider mounted on a heautiful white horse appeared. The man was Andy Duffy, an outlaw who had just acquired a bullet hole through the upper part of his leg in a brush with the Canadian Mounted Police. Oscar told Andy that he should make himself at home, but he had to make a trip and wouldn’t be home until the following day. The next day, when he returned, the outlaw was gone but Oscar's few valuables were still there, including a gold watch which hung plainly on the wall. He says that one of the most popular places for the outlaws was the “Hole in the Wall.” The excavation of that hangout can still be seen at the sight of Old Scobey. Almost any night one could find such characters as Dutch Henry, Pidgeon-Toed Kid, George Baker, and other tough ones there. He recalls a blizzard that came up while he was at the sheep camp. A man named George Baker, who was working for Tay- lor Green came to call for help. Oscar went out to assist an elderly sheepherder, who he found crouched in the snow with a buffalo robe wrapped around him. The herder used this method of stopping his sheep, along with his dog Oscar gave him his horse so he could go back to camp and rest. He spent the rest of the night in the sheep wagon and almost froze. The next day it was learned that another sheepherder, by the name of Conly, had been out with a band of sheep and had not returned, They searched all day without success. The next spring the missing herder was found, sitting beside the trail (he had taken the wrong one in the storm). There he had sat frozen all winter. ROSE (Sibbits) SHIPSTEAD In 1911 Oscar married Rose Sibbits, who was born at Wolf Point in 1895. Rose's father was a Sioux and her mother, who died four days after Rose's birth, was an Assiniboine. Rose was raised by her mother’s sister and her husband, Kittie and William Sibbits. William Sibbits, who was sub Indian Agent under Major Scobey, had come west in 1867 with the U. S. Cavalry. He participated in General Crook's first expedition against old chief Cochise. He came to Wolf Point vicinity in 1880 as a teamster with part of the government forces engaged in bringing old chief Sitting Bull to Poplar from the Woody Mountains in Can- 1] t ada, where the chief had fled after the Custer massacre. Many of the Indians froze to death during the march in bitterly cold weather. Rose can recall how her grandparents used to camp nearby, and she and her cousin, Minnie, would sleep there and listen to the stories their grandparents could tell. Mrs. Sibbits used to cook dinners. for the ranchers who came down from the Scobey area. Vhat is how Rosie met Oscar Shipstead, whom she married wheu she was 16. They had seven children, Doris, Eula, Elsie, Ralph, Leonard, David and Harold, nearly all of Whom still live here. Rosie was chosen to be queen tor the Homesteaders’ Golden Jubilee—a most fitting selection, and the honor going to a fine lady. ALBERT SHIPSTEAD Albert Shipstead first came out in 1904, at an early age, to visit his brothers, Henry and Ole. He like the country immedi- ately, and spent his time riding the saddle horses and hunting antelope. There were big herds of them at that time. He came out every summer, and in 1910 he came out to stay. He took out a homestead, and in 1925 was married to Alma Stege. Albert Shipstead has been shearing sheep as a side-line, and still practices this trade during the summer months. Albert Shipstead, still here, who came in 1904. MRS. ALBERT (Alma Stege) SHIPSTEAD As a former teacher and county superintendent, Mrs. Ship- stead is well known throughout the county. She first came to this area in 1916 to take out a homestead on the Fort Peck reservation, 33 miles from Scobey. She has taught in several county schools, and was County Superintendent of Schools from 1945 until 1953, and from 1959 until 1963, when she retired. The Shipsteads have one daughter, Mrs. Dorothy Hagen of Redstone. ELLEN (Shipstead) FROSLAN HAMANN Mrs. Hamann came in 1904, with her sister, Tilda, and her brother, Albert, to visit brothers Henry and Ole Shipstead. She recalls, on that first visit, that they were met in Poplar by Henry, who took them to the ranch by team and wagon. “There was a stream where we camped for dinner and rested the horses,” she recalls. “Henry pitched a tent for us and cooked a delicious meal over the campfire.” At the time of that first visit Hlenry and Ole were living in a dugout. The sisters slept in tents. Housekeeping chores were light, and the girls had time to ride horseback, pick berries, and visit the few neighbors. ; “T still have a picture in my mind of that country the way it looked then—so big, quiet and peaceful.” says Mrs, Hamann. “There were no highways, no fences, no plowed fields, and no dust blowing. It had a lonesome look, but the scenery was won- derful. I used to enjoy watching the long dark shadows on the hillsides in the late afternoons, and the white fleecy clouds that seemed to float so high. The first family they met in the area were the Bonneses, who has the post office where the Chet Murphy farm is now. Mary and Cassie McLeod were the first girls they met. HOMESTEADERS GOLDEN JUBILEE AND DANIELS COUNTY FAIR Mrs. Hamann enjoyed Montana so much that she decided to stav in the state. That fall she taught school south of Greai ‘Falls. Later she taught schools in Daniels County, and was the first teacher at the sod schoolhouse at Coal Creek, In 1913 Mrs. Hamann and two of her sisters homesteaded on land which later became part of the Henry Shipstead ranch.

JULIAN ERICKSON Julian Erickson was a lad of about 16 when he came from Velva, N. D., in 1902 with his brothers. Soon Julian was working for various ranchers in the vicinity. He recalls that, while hauling hay with Charles Woodley, they were startled by the sound of shots. They rode to the top of a hill and saw, on the flat below them, 15 or 20 Indian police from Poplar riding around and shooting. The Indians were in search of the Dutch Henry gang, and were pretending that they had the outlaws surrounded at a place called Stony Point. Not finding them, they decided to play at it. In the fall of 1903 a steam threshing machine set fire to the prairie grass and the resulting blaze burned a large area of rangeland, It burned 100 tons of hay and a barn at his brother’s farm, and jumped across creeks. He fought the fire most of the night, along with the Bonneses, the Tandes and the Manter- nachs. He can recall the late Oscar ‘‘Whoop” Manternach sit- ting ona cowhide that was being drug along to smother the fire, to hold it down. Mr. and Mrs. Julian Erickson on tneir farm in 1962. He came ‘out in 1902. She came in 1912. They still live on their place. 12 The fire destroyed much land, and the following winter (1903-4) was a tough one. The shortage of feed was disastrous to a band of 3,000 sheep being wintered there by Bill Shannon, who later built the Shannon Hotel in Glasgow. Only 300 of the 3,000 sheep survived the winter, and these were sold to Bonnes. Julian Erickson also worked for Henry and Ole Shipstead, then living in a dugout on the West Fork. The Shipstead brothers had frozen a quantity of cranberries in a small dugout behind the one in which they lived, and they enjoyed cranberries and eream as a special treat all winter. In 1912 Mr. Erickson and his new bride, the former Ellen Arthurs of Minot, N.D., set up a homestead 10 miles northeast of Scobey. That community was named the Julian community after him, as he helped his mother, who was postmistress. Mr. and Mrs, Erickson still live on their farm near their original homestead. Their son, Arthur Erickson, lives in Scobey, and his children all have had college educations. ALFRED and ARNE THOMAS LARSON Before setting in the Scobey area, Alfred and Arne Thomas Larson traveled to the area near Ubet, Montana, to work for sheep ranchers. Tom also served as a guide in the mountains near Livingston, and later worked for a time at Poplar. He and Alfred bought a shack on the Middlefork from a man school teacher, and in the spring of 1903 the two young men attempted to “improve” their claims. They found farming almost impos- sible. There were too many cattle at large. The XIT spread from Texas and the CK spread from Conrad were both using this region for summer pasture. But by digging irrigation ditches and breaking the required acreage they obtained water rights. Tom recalled a hideout built by the outlaws in a coulee about seven miles northwest of their place. To obtain lumber for the hideout, which was about 20x30, with logs on top and places to shoot through, the outlaws stole shacks of absent homesteaders. The Larsons saw the place in the spring after the outlaws had left. There had been a prairie fire and the outlaws had fought it and managed to save a patch of grass around their place. There were several carcasses of cattle with the CK (Con- rad Koors) brand. The outlaws had eaten the best portions and left the rest.. There were also dead horses among the cattle. The Larson brothers lived on bacon, prunes and beans bought at Poplar, and on ducks and jackrabbits. They washed their clothes by attaching them to a wire hung across the creek. The running water did the rest. In January, 1913 Al married Edith Luella Knudson, daughter of a homesteader who had come in 1910. .. mh Z OR eyo es eA & Mr. and Mrs. A. T.

With his “steamer” Al did custom work throughout the Ukranian settlement, and also broke the land where the airport now stands. , Al Larson died in 1940. He was the inventor of many farm implement devices, but never bothered to patent them. He pre- ferred just to‘make them work. Tom (A. T.) Larson died last winter. His widow, Alma, now lives in Scobey. Two sons, Kenneth and Harry live in Scobey, and their son Sylvester lives at Conrad. THE HUGHES FAMILY The Frank Hughes family came in 1904 because Mrs, Mellie Hughes was in poor health and it was hoped a change of cli- mate would be good for her. She was a cousin to Mrs. Mans- field Daniels and Jake Timmons. The climate was very bene- ficial, and Mrs. Hughes, Sr., is now 91 years old. The Hughes located two and a half miles north of the present town of Scobey. There were no fences, few farms, and the coun- try abounded in wild jack rabbits, swifts, coyotes, antelopes and ducks. Many outlaws passing through the district slept at the Hughes ranch with their guns for pillows. They asked Mrs. Hughes if she needed any meat, assuring her that they would rustle her some if she did. Frank Hughes, Jr., still here, recalls that an Indian outlaw, named Old Bloody Knife, apparently drunk, came through their place and met up with Frank Kief, who was driving two mules. Bloody Knife shot his luger into the air and the frightened mules broke loose and ran away. Bloody Knife chased them ‘but fell off his horse and lost his Luger in the tall grass. Three years later Lee Craig, working at the Hardenberg ranch, found this Luger while he was breaking sod with four head of horses and a walking plow. He picked up the gun and pulled the trig- ger—and it went off, almost shooting one of the horses. Another outlaw, Old Scarface, had breakfast with them one morning. Jake Davis was there, having just ridden in on a nice sorrel horse. Scarface looked at Jake’s horse and said, “Mr. Davis, how would you like to trade horses?” Jake said, “No, I don’t care to.” To which Scarface declared, ‘Well, I generally trade whether the other guy wants to or not.” Frank Hughes, Sr., and Jake Davis looked at each other, as if to vow that Scarface would never take that horse without a scrap. After breakfast the outlaw left without attempting to conclude his proposed “bargain.” Frank Hughes, Sr., was deputy sheriff under Jack Bennet in 1917; health in 1904. In 1920 he took an active part in the division of this county from Sheridan to Daniels, being chairman of the board of county commissioners at that time. T, A. Esval and Eugene LaRoche were the other members. Frank Hughes, Sr., died several years ago. His place is still operated by his son, Frank. MR, and MRS. JAKE DAVIS Jake Davis came to Old Scobey in 1904 and got a job herd- ing cattle for Daniels and Timmons. He was the first under- taker in Old Scobey, simply because there was nobody else to do the job. In 1919 he dammed up the Poplar river with a 70 foot dam, to make a recreation area known as Davis Beach. A dance hall was built there in 1922, and picnic grounds established. Canoe races and swimming events were held there for many years. Jake also started the first fur farm in the county in 1936. He had as many as 70 minks, and sold the pelts for $10 apiece. Some of Jake’s experiences in the early “undertaking” busi- ness are still remembered. One time a man who died suddenly at th old “Hole in the Wall” saloon in Old Scobey was placed in a box and left overnight on the hill near where he had died. The next morning body and coffin had disappeared. They were found in a coulee where the wind had sent them. The body was replaced in the coffin and buried. On another occasion a bereaved father gave the wrong measurements for a coffin for his son who was an accidental gunshot victim. The boy was buried with his feet sticking out of the end of the box. On April 10, 1912, Jake married Louise Butler, daughter of Mr, and Mrs. Lee Butler, who settled here in 1905. The wed- ding, which took place at the Lee Butler home where the TV tower is now, was performed by Justice of the Peace Sid Ben- nett. Mac Drummond and his violin furnished the music for the reception and dance after the wedding. This may have been the first wedding in the area. Louise Davis came from a pioneer family, he. grandparents having traveled to Oregon by wagon. When her parents came to Montana they settled on the “old Levang” place where the television tower now stands. Her father worked for Si Merrill for four or five years. She attended school in Poplar during the winter, and later attended a school near the Hughes place, and the Bonnes school. Mrs. Claude Tande was one of her teachers. Mrs. Davis’ father, Lee Butler, was driver for the Knapp- Crandel! store, driving an eight-horse team to Poplar and back regularly. Jake Davis died several years ago. Mrs. Davis lives in Scobey. Their son Tom Davis, is a well-known county farmer and member of the board of county commissioners. Their daugh- ter, Evelyn (Mrs. Bob) Hames lives in Seattle.

OR CARBERT 14 The Coal Creek community, 10 miles north of Peerless, re- ceived its name because of the coal deposits everywhere along the creek. Lhe name was later changed to Carbert because there Was another Coal Creek post office in the state. Ed Carroll built the first log cabin there in°1900. Soon set- tlers began to come in and became land squatters, as the land had not yet been surveyed for homesteading. They earned their livlihood by raising cattle, horses and sheep. Some of the earliest settlers were Dan Henderson, Bert Michels, Fatty Wilson, Sam Dodge, John Fuller, Jack Reed, Walter Reid and Otto Erstad. Soon the country began to fill up with people who came to be farmers instead of ranchers. This new migration included D. C. Knapp, George Crandell, Kilgore Crandell, J. V. Bennett, George Skerritt, Seraphin LaPierre, Jack and Tom Conboy, Al Daniels, Lex Lewis, Walt and Monty Golden, Harvey Wager, Lee McCann, Tom and Russell Lovel, Sam Richardson and family, A. B, Carter, Tom Lovel, the Huniberts, Oscar Halvor- son, Minnie Nelson, Joe and Fterbie Jacques, Tom Hughes, John Kemp, Dick McConnen, Oliver Ralston, John McCall. The Walter Reid family, which came in 1908, lived in a hill- side dugout, with a tarp hung over the entrance, When the weather became too cold they brought their horse in the dugout with them to help keep them warm, Later they built a house. Sam, Clint, Noel and Neil Richardson and Herb Jacque used a team and wagon with a walking plow snubbed behind to mark out their claims. .\\ red flag was tied to the rear wheel of the walking plow in such a way that the number of times the flag came up could be counted. The plow marked the land boundary and the flag measured the distance (numbcr cf flag revolutions times circumstance of the wheel). They started at the Canadian border, which had been surveyed, and counted from there, with Noel Richardson and Herby Jacques driving. When the Jand was officially surveyed the sections were found to be off only about 30 feet. A. B. Carter started a country store in 1915. Sam Dodge car- ried the mail from Scobey and was postmaster of Coal Creek. Neil - Richardson, Clayte Hodges and Bert Howe drove their The Sam Richardson family, photographed in Indiana in about 1900.

The Halversons also recall a prairie fire that burned the Coal Creek area while Oscar was in town. Mrs. Halverson and others managed to save their homes, but when Oscar came close to home the next day he could see only the blackened prairie because the tarpaper- covered shack did not stand out.

When the Dodge family reutrned to Arkan- sas in 1917 Harry Woodley became postmaster and Neil Rich- ardson was mail carrier. After A. B. Carters opened his store he took over the post office. It was while Carter had the post office that the name was changed from Coal Creek to Carbert by request of the postal de- partment, as there was already a Coal Creek in Montana. The store and postoffice changed hands several times, and in September, 1923, Noel Richardson took over the post office. In 1927 he also took over the store and continued to serve the com- munity until the 1940's. Faster modes of transportation left little need for a store, and mail was delivered by carrier from Scobey. Jim Wolfe had this route for many years. In 1915 the men of the community built a sod school house under the direction of Sam Richardson, who had learned sod construction while living in Nebraska. It was a structure 16’x24’ and seemed like a mansion to the settlers. For several years it was the scene of dances, elections, basket socials and community gatherings. Ellen Shipstead, now Mrs. Louie Hamann, was the first teacher. The grass around the school was so high that the youngsters would play run-sheep-run and hide any place in the grass and buffalo wallows. The first pupils were children from the Jacques, Richardson, Dodge, Henderson and Fuller families. The 1918 flu epidemic affected every family but the Lee Mc- Canns and Neil Richardsons, but there were only five deaths from flu at Coal Creek even though people seemed to be dying like flies all around. Many were extremely ill, but survived. Dr. Collinson made the long trip from Scobey to take care of some patients even though he had just recovered from the illness him- self — The homesteaders managed to survive the cold winters be- cause of the ample supply of coal in the community. The men would strip the dirt until they reached the coal underneath, and then every family would dig its own. In about 1924 the coal mine was set on fire by some men who were burning an accumulation of Russian thistles in order to get at the coal. They left the mine, not realizing the coal had caught fire. This mine burned underground for years. At times in the evening flames could be seen shooting up in the sky. When coal wasn’t available the homesteaders would gather cow chips instead. Community picnics, held at different homesteads, often in- cluded horse races, bucking broncs and horse quadrilles. Base- ball was also a favorite entertainment, and games were played with Scobey, Butte Creek and Canadian teams. Many Coal Creek homesteads are still being farmed by their original inhabitants, or by the decendants of the homesteaders. Compiled by Grace Daniels and other homesteaders.

Mr._and Mrs. Bareaz now own a custodial home for elderly people at Osage, lowa. The town of Whitetail was named after Whitetail Creek, which in turn was named after the white-tailed deer that in- habited this territory. This town has the distinction of being at the end of the Min- neapolis, St. Paul and Sault Saint Marie Railroad (commonly called the Soo Line). Probably the earliest settler of this area was Elmer “Hominy” Thompson, who came north trailing Texas cattle in the 90's, and for several years was almost the only settler in northeastern Montana between the Missouri river and the Canadian line. The first-white woman to set up housekeeping near White- tail was Mrs, Len Stagg. She was followed by Mrs. Jess Wiley, Mrs. Asa Dunn, and Mrs. Doc Dunn. Their husbands had come shortly before to pick out homesteads. The original town was south of the present railroad track. Gus Vahl and Esther Vahl Davidson (later Mrs. Emil “Swede” Johnson), started a store in a tent on Jess Wiley’s farm in the spring of 1912. Harry Brown had a pool hall, Emanuel States had a livery barn, Bill Endersby and Bill Hurst had saloons, Ted White had a hotel, and there was a cafe and drugstore. The first post office was in Doc Dunn’s home. The mail was carried by saddle horses and later by team from Redstone by Ida McArthur and Anna Wilkes. Other early carriers were Mrs. Mary Stagg, H. P. Kins, and her daughter, Henrietta (New). The first public school was started in 1914, and the early teachers were Lizzie Dirks and Emma Crone. A customs office was estbalished in 1915, and an immigration office in 1931. ; The coming the railroad caused new businesses to spring up. John Murray had the Monarch Lumber Yard, in which Gilbert Overland was employed. J. P.-Nelson also had a lumber yard; Peter Hanson, a store; Dan Colgan, a butcher shop; Faucett Bros., a garage. John Grendal owned a blacksmith shop; Schlechter Bros., a hardware store; Lee and Bakken, a bank; Hendrickson and Ted White, hotels. Gus Vahl had an imple- ment shop in connection with his store, and Irving Doer pub- lished the Courier. Later Otto Fiskim and Joe Haubrick bought Gus’s implement shop, and Joe still owned it when it burned. At one time there were five eating establishments in the town. Whitetail people still remember a nurse and midwife, Effie Duck, who lived with her parents about three miles east of White tail. She took care of the medical needs of the com- munity when no doctors were available. Claude Hanrahan hauling water i 1912, and brought his family in 1913.

He was one of the first ranchers north of the Missouri. The first baby in Whitetail was delivered by Doc Dunn, an osteopath. The baby was his daughter, Gertrude. The Whitetail Cemetery was started in 1915. There were many dances and social gatherings in the com-- munity. One of the highlights of the year was the Fourth of July celebration. At one of these, in 1915 or 16, the local citizens witnessed an unscheduled bit of Wild West action. An outlaw by the nanie of Rawleigh Bigley attempted to make a getaway by making his horse jump a fence. The horse balked and Bigley was fatally crushed between the horse and the fence. In May, 1926, Hans Heinrichson, proprietor of a hotel and restaurant at Whitetail, undertook, to pump his well dry in the hope he ceuld improve the quality of his water, which had been oily and murky and unfit to use in his restaurant since the well was dug. After pumping off a couple barrels of water, which kept getting darker, a heavy, black, oily substance filled the pail. About three quarters of a barrel was brought up before the oil became lighter and clearer. Soon every lot in Whitetail was sold, most of them to out- side purchasers. Oil stock, royalties, units and leases soared. The well was spudded in October, 1928. Nothing came of the venture, but hopes remain in the Whitetail community that a future oil well may be more successful. It was the well-known Brother Van Orsdel who called a meeting of Whitetail residents to explain why the county should be divided. A fire in Feb, 28, 1929, burned the post office and hotel. At one time Whitetail had the only factory in the county, the Truck Grain Blower Co., makers of a labor-saving power take-off truck grain blower. George and E. J. Schlechter, own- ers of the company, came to Whitetail in 1913 and started a hardware store. In 1919 they added farming as a side line, but in 1929 they sold the hardware store to Gus and Pete Kellas and increased their farming operations. Out of an old barrel and other scraps picked up around town, and with a hammer, hacksaw and a file for tools, the first truck grain blower took shape in 1930. In 1932 two blowers were sold in the community for experimental purposes. After several improvements a U. S. Patent was taken out on the invention and a temporary workshop was set up in the basement of Swede Johnson’s building to cope with the ever- increasing demand. In 1940 the brothers erected a modern con- crete and steel factory building with a lawn in front, shrubbery, and nice driveways. The grain blower was sold all over the United States and Canada. The invention of the portable auger power unit caused a sub- stantial decline in sales, although the grain blower still remains popular in Canada. The Schlechters made a substantial success as long as they were connected with the business. A few years after it changed hands and attempts were made to convert it to other products the factory became defunct. 18 Edna Wiley (Mrs. Paul Koste- nick), daughter of one of the Whitetail pioneer families who are still living in the area.

HOMESTEADERS GOLDEN JUBILEE AND DANIELS COUNTY FAIR In the 30’s the Whitetail Creek was dammed by the W.P.A to form a lake for recreational purposes. It has been used Rice then for swimming, boating, fishing and picnicking. An island in the middle of the lake is used for firework displays sponsored by the American Legion on the Fourth of July. The town of Whitetail diminished in the ’30’s, as many farmi- ers were driven out by drought and dust. But it is still a busy community. It boasts an American Legion post and auxiliary, a sports club, the Whitetail Community Home Demonstration Club, Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts, baseball teams, and the Christian Missionary Alliance church with its Mission Circle and Young People’s Group.

In 1915 Reu- ben Dutton was given an appointment to Whitetail, and a par- sonage was finished in May, 1916. The church building was later purchased by the Christian Missionary Alliance, and services are held regularly. WHITETAIL SPORTS CLUB The Whitetail Sports Club was organized in March, 1949, by a group of Whitetail residents who wished to incorporate all sports activities in the town into one organization.

Hagan, Sr., of Redstone, homestead resident for 53 years, recalls the following two incidents. “Earl Randall, prosperous homesteader still here, came along in August, 1911, and wanted to know if he’ could stay overnight, I told him there were three in my bed, but that I would make him a hay bed in the horse stall joining our bed in the oat bin. The bed bugs had driven me out of my 8’x16’ shack. He said that would be fine. “He had eaten some drouth green cucumbers in the cafe in Redstone and had a real case of cholera morbus (bellyache) and was in terrific pain. Dave and Joe McCann, sleeping with me, couldn’t go to sleep with his moaning. He got so bad he said, “Oh, Art, get up. I’m going to die!” And Dave McCann said, “die then so we can go to sleep.” That woke me up and I got him a hot brandy and took the belly ache out of him pronto.” “Another incident, in 1913 I shipped the first carload of wheat out of Redstone. I helped the dray man unload a carload of lumber to get the car for the wheat. I had the car doors and lumber to cooper it up and we went to supper. Another fellow with flax in wagons dumped a sack of flax in the car and thought that would hold the car for him. He started a big rumpus and socked me with a lumber board. A big wagon load of men came over from town and unloaded by wheat, and two men slept on the wheat pile overnight. I had the man pinched and it cost him $50.” The shack (Mary Huddleston’s” barn) placed on the track by “Hominy” Thompson to stop the train.

Her close neighbor was “'Hominy’’ Thompson, who once helped himself to her barn to block the Soo Line Railroad tracks. She can recall walking long distances through deep snowdrifts to the schools she taught, boarding at a home where the diet was potatoes and milk gravy, and undergoing many other hardships to re- ceive her salary of $60 a month.

Thompson, standing guard before a shack he put on the Soo Line Rail- road track near Whitetail in 1923 to prevent the train from crossing his land. He was not satisfied with the setttlement offered by the railroad for dis- rupting his irrigation system. This action resulted in a short prison sentence, for disrupting the mail service, and also caused him to lose his land be- cause of a mortgage purchased by the railroad company and foreclosed. Thmopson, who earned his nickname from living on noth- ing but hominy one winter when he was hard up, was at various times on either side of the law. He was probably the earliest resident of the area, having come in the 1890's with a trail herd from Texas. In the early 1900’s he sold some rustled horses for the Dutch Henry gang, but neglect- ed to return with the money. The gang destroyed his ma- chinery and personal belong- ings and threatened his life. Even after he had moved to Plentywood, where he died in 1949 at the age of 87, he re- fused to divulge much informa- tion about his early life. 21 JUBILEE AND DANIELS COUNTY FAIR THE AMERICAN LEGION Ancel Fassett Post No. 121 Post No. 121, organized in Whitetail in 1924, was named after Ancel Fassett, first member of the armed forces from that com- munity to be killed in action in France in World War I. It first consisted of World War I veterans of the Whitetail area, but in following years the membership comprised the addi- tional towns of Flaxville, Madoc, Navajo and Redstone, Mon- tana, and also Big Beaver and Buffalo Gap, Sask. Now the membership is scattered through other states and Saskatchewan, and includes veterans of World War II and the Korean con- flict. A Ladies Auxiliary Unit was organized a few years after the post was formed and has been active in community affairs. In early years the Post held Amature Hour Programs and other events to promote and finance school bands and drum and bugle corps in the communities. These were very popular. In recent years the main source of income has been raffles and pitch tournaments, with occasional dances and. card parties. Receipts have been é¢ar-marked for an extensive baseball pro- gram. American Legion Junior, Little League, and lately a Babe Ruth team are sponsored. In 1958 the Legion Team was. Dis- trict Champions and the Little League and Babe Ruth teams have had at least their share of the honors, Other programs sponsored by the Post are the American Legion school awards to outstanding eighth grade boys and girls of Redstone, Flaxville, Madoc, Rural Westby and White- tail. Post No. 121 is a charter post in the American Legion Boys” State and is proud of the delegates it has sponsored. The Flax: ville Commercial Club has also sponsored candidates the last two years. Off and on for many years a July Fourth fireworks display has been sponsored by the post. It began in town, and since then has been fired from an island in the Whitetail Reservoir. It is considered one of the best in this part of the counrty. The Post owns a hall in Whitetail that is available for all community activities. It has a set of colors and rifles which are used for Memorial Day services each year at the Redstone, Flax- ville, Orville or Whitetail cemetaries, as well as military funerals and other events. The Post has actively supported Legion policies and has had one member elected to the office of Department Vice Com- mander, and four of its members have held the office of District Commander, District No. 1 of Montana. In 1938 the Post Color guard was given the honor of being the Department Color Guard at the State Convention in Helena. In 1939 five mem- bers of the Post attended the National Convention of the Ameri- can Legion in Chicago and was cited for having the largest per- centage of membership at the Convention of all Posts from Montana that year. In 1960 Walter L. Holle received the first Life Membership Card conferred by Post 121. Three charter members of the Post, Carl Berger, James Kins (both of Whitetail) and Herb Myers of Scobey, are current members still residing in the area. Herb, always the first to pay his dues each year, has missed only one Memorial Day service since 1924. Membership for 1963 is 49. Albert P. French, Flaxville, is Post Commander and Gerald E.

D., to work for Billy Kraft, later staying ‘with Leo Yon Kuster. In 1911 he built a shack on his claim, getting married the following winter. He recalls waking up one June morning to find the bed cov- ered with snow, which had come in through the yet unshingled roof, ; He freighted lumber from Pop- lar to Old Scobey for Sid Ben- nett, who had a lumber yard. One time, with 15 other men, Shipstead, Ed Martinson, Frank and Bill Manternach, Ole J. they had stopped at a half-way place when a big storm came up.

HOMESTEADERS GOLDEN JUBILEE In 1917 a group of energetic young farmers in the “Police Creek” community, between Silver Star and Four Buttes, or- ganized a baseball club. Members of the team were James Rhodes, M. A. LaMotte, Robert Rhodes, Sherd Wilcoxon, Julius Lekvold, Earnest Gampp, Rex Rhodes, Ted Rustebakke, Elmer Olson. Many good games and a few good arguments took place on the baseball diamond near the Rex Rhodes farm. The official umpire was Jim Jenrose, who may be remem- bered as the owner of a large barn in the community where people flocked on Saturday nights to dance to the music of Oscar Shipstead, Albert Horind and Jim Penrose. Mrs. Alvah Shaw (Hazel Parkhurst) and her sister, Mrs. Keith Miller (Marjorie Parkhurst) out for a buggy ride in 1915. Carl Chelgren is accompanying them on horseback. Mrs. Shaw, pioneer school teacher and homesteader, came in 19,12 with her parents, Mr. and Mré. William Parkhurst. She and her husband now live on her father’s homestead, nine miles south of Scobey. Before there was a school house in the area she held classes in her home for the neighborhood children. Later she attended normal college at Dillon, and then taught in several county schools.* One day while she was teaching in the Bonnes school lightning struck and killed the horse she had ridden to school. AND DANIELS COUNTY FAIR Eddie Lund, who died in 1962, was one of the original ‘stock- holders of -the Grain Growers Oil Co. in Scobey, and served as president and director of the Farmers Elevator in Four Buttes for 33 years as well. He came ‘from North Dakota in 1913, trading a Reo car for squatters rights on a home- stead in the Silver Star com- munity. Silver Star Hall In January, 1925, a group of Silver Star area residents de- cided to build a community hall. A non-profit organization to sponsor and promote the build- ing was organized, $600 in pledges were made and later col- lected, and the name “Silver Star” was selected for the build- ing. In a short time 373 memberships at $5 each were sold, and Allie Olson donated one acre of land as a building site, and sold 10 acres of additional land to the corporation. The total cost of the hall was approximately $4,500.00. Throughout the years the hall has been used for dances, elections, political meetings, church services, and other events. The club has managed to keep itself in the black, although in recent years it has been nip and tuck. The hall has helped to hold the community together, and the residents of Silver Star are justly proud of this achievement. —Compiled by O. E. Susag.

She also had the care of a crippled child, Beatrice. She and her daughter, Beatrice, died in 1948 just six weeks apart. B. J. Lekvold, who is still farm- ing the homestead he picked out in 1913, recalls a trip he made to Medicine Lake for lumber with Peter Thorem and Allie Olson. They left Medicine Lake on July 3, and set up a tent that night for camp. The next morning, July 4, a hard rain prevented them from re- suming their journey. To celebrate the Fourth, they took their Cooking utensils and marched around their wagons as a band. Peter Thorem clim3- ed “up on a load of lumber to make a speech, and went, ‘Ten thousand years ago this was a howling wilderness. And it still is!’ ) HOMESTEADERS GOLDEN O. E.
