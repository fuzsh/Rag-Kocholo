        "text": "Voters in this state have no excuse for complaining that all politicians are alike. Ideological differences as vast as Montana's mountains and prairies make the race for its only seat in the House of Representatives a classic political contest.\n\nThe two opponents -- each a popular incumbent, one a liberal Democrat, one a conservative Republican -- disagree about almost everything.\n\nRepresentatives Ron Marlenee, the Republican, and Pat Williams, the Democrat, were forced into a face-off when the House was reapportioned after the 1990 census. Montana's population grew only 2 percent in the 1980's, much more slowly than the nation, so the state lost the second House seat it had had since 1913. Because the number of House seats has been fixed at 435 since the 1910 census, states with stagnant or falling populations lose representatives while growing states gain them. A Vast, Expensive Campaign\n\nNow Montana has the most populous Congressional district ever created, with 799,065 people, and the largest in area after Alaska's. The area's vastness has kept the two candidates campaigning nonstop by car, plane, helicopter and horseback.\n\nUnlike many other contests between incumbents, this race pits two veterans who have strong out-of-state allies. So Mr. Marlenee (pronounced MAR-li-nay) and Mr. Williams are both confident they can raise the $1 million each has said he plans to spend.\n\nWith two months to go, public and private polls show the race just about even, with each candidate running strongly in his former district: Mr. Marlenee in the agricultural east he has represented for 16 years; Mr. Williams in the mountainous west he has represented since 1979, from the union town of Butte to academic Missoula.
