        "text": "When Richard Nixon signed the Emergency Conservation Act of 1974, it seemed to make sense to just about everyone. It set a fuel-saving national speed limit of 55 miles per hour just as the country was beginnning to feel the effects of the Arab oil embargo. Federal officials later found that it also saved lives.\n\nBut as the threat of a prolonged energy pinch has been replaced by an oil glut - a survey last week showed that gasoline prices have fallen an average of 5 cents a gallon in the past year - enthusiasm for the limit has waned. Legislators in more than a score of states are trying to raise driving speeds by circumventing enforcement of the law.\n\nThe rebellion began west of the Mississippi, where there are more wide-open spaces and stretches of straight, flat, uncrowded highway. Last year, Nevada Gov. Robert F. List signed a law lowering the penalty for driving at speeds between 55 and 70 m.p.h to a $5 fine for ''energy wasting.'' Idaho, Arizona and Montana have similar laws; the Illinois Legislature is considering a measure under which driving 56 to 70 m.p.h. would no longer be a moving violation; and Utah now prevents insurance companies from penalizing drivers caught cruising up to 10 m.p.h. over the legal limit.\n\nIn other states, highway patrolmen are said to look the other way as heavy-footed offenders pass. Since 1975, when Congress made the temporary limit permanent, each successive session has seen a flurry of bills aimed at repealing it. None has come to a vote. Representative Ron Marlenee, a Montana Republican and persistent critic of the 55 m.p.h. law, calls it a flagrant example of Uncle Sam meddling in something best left to local authorities. As it stands, he says, the law makes no allowances for regional differences in highway safety. ''There's a lot of difference,'' Mr. Marlenee says ''between driving from one part of Philadelphia to another and driving from Two Dot to Big Timber, Montana.''\n\nThe states rights theme was also echoed in the 1980 Republican Party platform, which denounced the 55 m.p.h. limit. The Federal highway administrator, Raymond Barnhart, a former Texas highway commissioner, has characterized it as a ''stinking law.''\n\nThere is mounting evidence that many drivers agree. A recent Federal Highway Administration study showed that in North Dakota, for example, 70.7 percent of the drivers routinely break the speed limit. In Colorado, 64.1 percent do it; in Florida, 63.1 percent. Critics say that such an apparently unenforceable law is worse than no law at all, for it can breed contempt for the legal system. However loud the clamor for higher speed limits, those calling for change are outnumbered in Congress. The Reagan Administration has made it clear that regardless of the 1980 platform plank calling for it, repeal is not a major legislative priority, in part because it has no chance of passage. Nor are state legislatures likely to go too far in subverting it, for doing so could jeopardize badly needed Federal highway funds. A 1978 law requires states to see that 50 percent of their motorists comply with the law. Those states that do not are threatened with the loss of 5 percent of their Federal highway construction and repair money. The compliance requirement was to rise to 70 percent in 1983, but in a bow to Administration pressure last year, Congress froze it at 50 percent.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
