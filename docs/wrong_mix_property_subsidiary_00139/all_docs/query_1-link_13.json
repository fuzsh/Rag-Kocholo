Sun & Oracle virtualization (contd) • DSD has been around for several years and applies to the Sun’s enterprise class servers only. Oracle db is being used with it • Containers – Oracle db (non-RAC) is certified, RAC certification in progress • Each Oracle application has a separate stand on containers or LDoms certification and support. Details can be found on Oracle CEpedia • LDoms is Sun’s partitioning technology that is built into the firmware of the CMT processors ( UltraSPARC T1 and T2). Oracle db ( SI and RAC) has been tested and works well.Work is in progress to achieve formal certification from Oracle.\n\n33. Is a LDom hard or soft partition ? • Partitions created using Sun LDom’s technology meet the hard partition category as outlined by Oracle\n\n34. Virtualization : LDoms Vs LPARS Sun IBM System SPARC/CMT IBM eServer pSeries and iSeries LPAR (enhanced with Dynamic LPAR and Micro- Product Name Logical Domains - LDoms partitioning) Method of Para-virtualization (Hypervisor implemented in Para-virtualization (Hypervisor implemented in operation firmware) firmware) Partition Type Hard Hard N/A (require Hardware Management Console, Host OS Solaris 10 HMC) AIX (5.1-LPAR for POWER4; 5.2-DLPAR for Solaris 10, Solaris Express Developer Edition, Guest OS POWER4 & POWER5; 5.3 Micro-partitioning for Open Solaris, Linux, FreeBSD POWER5), Linux, i5/OS 1/10 of a processor and increments of 1/100th of a th Granularity CPU thread, up to 128 guests processor; up to 254 partitions Processor Partitioned at thread level, capped Partitioned at 1/10th processor level, capped resources Memory Separately assigned to partitions Separately assigned to partitions IO Direct-IO (not shared), or Virtual (shared) Direct-IO (not shared) or Virtual (shared) Virtual Devices Disk, Network, Console Disk, Network, Console IBM Director with Virtualization management Management CLI, XML, MIB, libvirt extensions\n\n35.

Business Case •Sun's CMT server product line offers the possibility to create upto 64 logical domains within one physical server – The Sun SPARC Enterprise Servers T5120 & T5220 •This will increase to 256 virtual domains in the future •Customers want to use Sun LDoms technology with their Oracle databases ( single and RAC) >Better utilization of resources >Hard partitioning •Customers want statement that Ldoms/Oracle combination is supported\n\n39. Customer demand •UBS •Lufthansa •PNC •Royal Bank of Scotland •Digica ( UK based outsourcing company) •Benetton •Nokia Siemens ( Ldoms with Sun cluster) •Unicredit\n\n40. Logical Domains • SPARC-CMT HW based virtualization built on top of sun4v Hypervisor • Partitioning capability > Create virtual machines each with LDom 1 LDom 2 LDom 3 LDom 4 sub-set of resources Solaris Solaris 10 Solaris 10 Solaris 10 > Protection & Isolation Express App using HW+FW App App App App • Delivered as components App App App App of Solaris, SPARC FW, App Zone Zone 1 Zone 2 and LDoms Manager App Hypervisor SPARC-CMT CPU Hardware CPU CPU CPU CPU Shared CPU, Memory, IO Mem Mem Mem Mem I/O\n\n41. Fundamentals •Hypervisor is part of machine FW running on bare metal •This is paravirtualization; Modified OS on top of sun4v hypervisor. Less overhead, better performance •Hypervisor & stable sun4v interface decouples new platforms from OS releases •Each VM appears as an entirely independent machine >It's own kernel, patches, tuning parameters >It's own user accounts, administrators >It's own IO: disk and network (IP addr, MAC ID)\n\n42. CPU & Memory •CPU and memory are “partitioned” by LDoms •SPARC-CMT hardware threads are expressed as virtual CPU's •Allocated to guests via the LDoms manager •Dynamic reconfiguration is supported (CPU today, IO and Memory in later release)\n\n43. Logical Domain Roles •Control domain - Creates and manages other logical domains and services by communicating with the hypervisor. >This is where the LDoms Manager application runs >Usually acting as a IO/Service domain also •IO/Service domain – Has direct ownership and access to IO devices and shares these with other logical domains in the form of virtual devices; also provides services, such as a virtual network switch or console to other logical domains. •Guest domain - Uses services from the IO/Service domain(s) and is managed by the control domain. This is where the users typically run their workloads\n\n44.

Solution: Oracle certification with LDoms •Discussion and scoping •What testing needs to be done to achieve certification >Oracle RAC + Ldoms >Oracle RAC + Ldoms + Sun Cluster •Number of nodes •IO domain Vs Guest domain •Test spec\n\n47. Next steps •Oracle database single instance and RAC now works within LDoms ( since Solaris 10 Update 5). Basic testing has been done at Sun. •Oracle RAC on IO domain will not completely satisfy customer requirements, hence a certification using guest domains should be targeted. •LDoms supports dynamic reconfig of CPU only, memory and storage cannot be changed. Testing needed in the areas of IO starvation per domain, Dynamic reconfig of CPU (Memory and storage cannot be dynamically reconfigured). •A two phase certification is planned 1) Static 2) Dynamic •A specific test plan needs to be designed for LDoms certification, based on current Ldoms feature set. Paul Tsien, Carol Colrain and Winston Huang will provide this to Sun. • After test plan is defined, Sun will conduct testing. A whitepaper will be generated from lessons learned during testing, which will be useful to joint customers trying to deploy these two technologies.\n\n48. Knowledge Management – CEpedia Oracle • Driving towards making Oracle CEpedia the place to go for all Oracle-Sun information • This will be the collaborative style cummunity driven knowledge mgmt portal • Currently it has over 50 articles providing key information • Lets build it up…need contribution from customer facing Sun Oracle architects • http://cepedia.sfbay/oracle - ( Sun internal portal)\n\n50. Oracle Opportunities & Challenges • Traction on CMT Platforms > DB, middleware and apps • Establish Solaris as a viable option on x64 with Oracle • Price/performance leadership on M-Series for DB • Get aligned on RAC • Storage side opportunities\n\n51. Summary of Work in Process • Benchmarks > Oracle TPC-H on M9000 > SAP-SD with Oracle on Maramba > SPECjappserver on Maramba / Batoka > Oracle TPC-H on Maramba / Batoka • Performance > TPC-E scaling and optimizations on SPARC/x64 > Niagara crypto > Amber Road > 512 threads scaling > Optimizations based on customer escalations\n\n52. Oracle DB : TPC-H • M9000 > Working on optimising Oracle db 11g on M9000 > At the Sun/Oracle meeting there were 7 outstanding performance issues. Now reduced to issues on 2 queries > With 11g's new query result cache enabled > Throughput running 64 streams (default 7) is 48% better than 10g > Composite metric is 17% better than 10g > Issues: Q9 performance stability, refresh, load times > Currently waiting for REP Storage refresh • VF(Victoria Falls) Platform > Scoping activity in progress\n\n53.
