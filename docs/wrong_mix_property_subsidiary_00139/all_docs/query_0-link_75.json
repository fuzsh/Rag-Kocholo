        "text": "Today Sandeep pinged me asking for clarification about a DB patch I had recommended. Step 5 in section 3.3.2 of the readme of Oct2007 CPU DB (9.2.0.8) patch 6395038 reads like this:\n\nThis step is required only if your database contains an Identity Management Metadata Repository. If you are not sure whether you need to perform this step, you can you can enter the following query (a non-null result means you should perform the step):\n\nSQL> select USERNAME from dba_users where upper(USERNAME) like '%ODS%';\n\nThis returns the result WEBMETHODS in our environment.\n\nAs we all know WEBMETHODS has nothing to do with OID or Identity Management Metadata. The Oracle Internet Directory runs on an Oracle database and creates two database users: ODS and ODSCOMMON. ODS is the schema owner that contains all of the database objects (tables, views, objects, etc.) used for OID functionality and directory storage. When the OID needs to login to the database, it uses the ODS database account which has a default password of ODS. You should secure this database user account before putting the LDAP directory into production.\n\nSo the correct query should be:\n\nselect username from dba_users where upper(username) in ('ODS','ODSCOMMON');\n\nI logged an SR to get this corrected. Oracle was quick in response:\n\nISSUE CLARIFICATION\n\n====================\n\nReadme for PATCH 6395038 SECTION 3.3.2 POINT 5 includes a very unreliable\n\nmethod for testing for the presence of OID. The test is to perform the query:\n\nselect USERNAME from dba_users where upper(USERNAME) like '%ODS%';\n\nFor this customer they have a schema named WEBMETHODS which causes the test\n\nto incorrectly identify the instance as one that contains OID.\n\n.\n\nISSUE VERIFICATION\n\n===================\n\nVerified\n\n.\n\nCAUSE DETERMINATION\n\n====================\n\nUnclear logic\n\nCAUSE JUSTIFICATION\n\n====================\n\nUnclear logic\n\n.\n\nPROPOSED SOLUTION(S)\n\n======================\n\nModify the query to be:\n\nselect USERNAME from dba_users where upper(USERNAME) like 'ODS';\n\nPROPOSED SOLUTION JUSTIFICATION(S)\n\n====================================\n\nREASON: Any instance which contains OID will have the 'ODS' schema\n\nspecifically. Older versions of OID also included the ODS_COMMON schema,\n\nhowever even in these cases the ODS schema was always present.\n\n.\n\nSOLUTION / ACTION PLAN\n\n=======================\n\nAs we are specifically looking for the schema's ODS or ODS_COMMON schemas, we can ignore any result other than these.\n\n.\n\nKNOWLEDGE CONTENT\n\n=================\n\nPlatform / Port Specific? = NO\n\nCreated a new note: TBC\n\nCreated Doc Bug : Bug: 6531776\n\n26-OCT-07 23:50:15 GMT\n\nVikram,\n\nDocumentation bug 6531776 and Metalink Note: 464734.1 have been created for this issue. It may take a few days for the note to be reviewed and become\n\navailable.\n\nFor clarity, the workaround is to ignore any value returned other than the 2 specific values of 'ODS' and 'ODS_COMMON'.\n\nEddie\n\n26-OCT-07 23:51:55 GMT\n\n.\n\nUPDATE\n\n=======\n\nHi Vikram,\n\nI am inactivating this Service Request, as I believe I have provided you with the solution to your issue. If this is not the case, please update the Service Request within the next two weeks and I will be glad\n\nto assist you further. Otherwise, no update is necessary and after two weeks, th\n\ne Service Request will automatically close.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nEddie\n\nGlobal Customer Services\n\n27-OCT-07 00:49:02 GMT\n\nHi Eddie,\n\nThanks for the quick response. However I have two points:\n\n1. The OID schemas are ODS and ODSCOMMON. You have mentioned the schema name as ODS_COMMON which is again incorrect.\n\n2. Metalink Note 464734.1 which you mention is not visible to me. Maybe you have\n\nclassified as internal only.\n\n- Vikram\n\n29-OCT-07 15:55:04 GMT\n\nVikram,\n\nODS_COMMON is indeed correct, however it is a LEGACY OID schema and not present with the later versions of OID. As I mentioned the note will be review\n\ned before becoming available to you.\n\nEddie\n\n29-OCT-07 15:55:19 GMT\n\nI get zero hits when I query for ODS_COMMON on metalink or google. However I get a lot of hits when I query for ODSCOMMON. Was ODSCOMMON schema called ODS_COMMON in previous versions. If yes, then it is very strange that ODS_COMMON doesn't return anything.\n\n- Vikram\n\nUTF8 and AL32UTF8 are encodings of the Unicode character set and include all the characters in all modern languages. UTF8 and AL32UTF8 allow Oracle Applications to be run from one database instance using any combination of supported languages. The advantage of AL32UTF8 over UTF8 is in the handling of supplementary characters, which are increasingly used in certain languages. AL16UTF16 is the current default database character set for Oracle databases 10g and 11g and Oracle E-Business Suite R12.\n\nIf you happen to create a fresh Apps Production instance, be sure to select the characterset as AL16UTF16, if all the clients and servers connecting to your instance are 9i and above. This is because 8i databases have trouble connecting to AL32UTF8 databases as per metalink note 237593.1\n\nCaution:\n\nAL32UTF8 is the Oracle Database character set that is appropriate for XMLType data. It is equivalent to the IANA registered standard UTF-8 encoding, which supports all valid XML characters.\n\nDo not confuse Oracle Database database character set UTF8 (no hyphen) with database character set AL32UTF8 or with character encoding UTF-8. Database character set UTF8 has been superseded by AL32UTF8. Do not use UTF8 for XML data. UTF8 supports only Unicode version 3.1 and earlier; it does not support all valid XML characters. AL32UTF8 has no such limitation.\n\nUsing database character set UTF8 for XML data could cause a fatal error or affect security negatively. If a character that is not supported by the database character set appears in an input-document element name, a replacement character (usually a question mark) is substituted for it. This will terminate parsing and raise an exception.\n\nHere's a good post on Luo Donghua's oracle and unix blog : How to graphically add a printer in Solaris 8\n\nIf you've got a network printer...\n\nFrom your Solaris system, do this (assumes printer IP is 192.168.1.99):\n\n# lpadmin -p hp3200m -s 192.168.1.99 -I any\n\nType the following to set the default printer (assuming the printer is hp3200m):\n\n# lpadmin -d hp3200m\n\nYou need to be sure that print services are started (/usr/lib/lpsched or the equivalent command using Service Management Facility [SMF] in the Solaris 10 OS)."
