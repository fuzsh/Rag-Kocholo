Status: Withdrawn

Reason: Read the Spec Lead's explanation of the withdrawal.

JCP version in use: 2.1

Java Specification Participation Agreement version in use: 1.0

Description:

This JSR will specify the set of APIs common across the JAIN SPA JSRs. This will provide consistency by reducing duplication of common interfaces and classes among these JSRs.

Section 2: Request

2.1 Please describe the proposed Specification:

The JAIN initiative brings service portability, convergence, and secure network access to telephony and data networks. The JAIN APIs are targeted at appliation developers within network equipment vendors, independent software vendors (ISVs), system integrators, and service providers.

There are currently twenty one different JAIN JSRs which are in the Java Community Process. As a result of tight collaboration among the members of the JAIN initiative, these JSRs have a consistent architecture and they share common design patterns. As a result, they have common base interfaces and classes, such as data types and exception definitions.

This specification will document and specify these common base interfaces and classes to avoid duplication of these interfaces and classes in each of the above JAIN JSRs and to maintain consistency of these interfaces and classes across these JSRs.

2.2 What is the target Java platform? (i.e., desktop, server, personal, embedded, card, etc.)

The target platform for this JSR (and the JAIN JSRs) is Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition and the Java 2 Standard Edition.

2.3 What need of the Java community will be addressed by the proposed specification?

This specification will address the need to provide standardization conventions allowing interoperability of JAIN components and reducing the cost of their integration in an end-to-end JAIN solution.

2.4 Why isn't this need met by existing specifications?

Currently, no existing J2EE or J2SE specification provides a standard Common JAIN API. Existing JAIN APIs need a common JSR to capture these common interfaces and classes to avoid duplication of classes and code in each JAIN API and maintain consistency across the JAIN APIs.

2.5 Please give a short description of the underlying technology or technologies:

The JAIN APIs, including the JAIN Common APIs will be based on standard J2EE and J2SE services, including the JavaBean event model.

2.6 Is there a proposed package name for the API Specification? (i.e., javapi.something, org.something, etc.)

The API will have one or several packages and the prefix for all packages will be "javax.jain".

2.7 Does the proposed specification have any dependencies on specific operating systems, CPUs, or I/O devices that you know of?

The specification has no dependency on operating systems, CPUs, or I/O devices.

2.8 Are there any security issues that cannot be addressed by the current security model?

None

2.9 Are there any internationalization or localization issues?

None

2.10 Are there any existing specifications that might be rendered obsolete, deprecated, or in need of revision as a result of this work?

Once this JSR reaches final release, the JAIN Final release related APIs will be updated to reference the common JAIN JSR. Newer JAIN JSRs will depend on this JSR for common base interfaces and classes.

2.11 Please describe the anticipated schedule for the development of this specification.

Expected submission date: 08/07

Community draft submitted by 09/28

Community review closed 10/26

Public draft submitted by 11/02

Public review closed 12/02

Proposed Final draft submitted 12/07

Final release 01/11.

2.12 Please describe the anticipated working model for the Expert Group working on developing this specification.

The anticipated working model is via email and conference calls, with readouts and discussions occuring and the necessary JAIN Community meetings.
