At a previous awards ceremony on Saturday, August 23, the following awards for Outstanding Achievement in Engineering Development were announced: Engineering Plaque to:

The Charles F. Jenkins Lifetime Achievement Award to Dr. Woo Paik for the invention of the digital video compression technology adopted by the HDTV Grand Alliance, his leadership in the development of DigiCipher, the digital compression technology that is the basis for DTV broadcasting, and his leadership in the development of Video Cipher, the de facto standard for distribution of scrambled cable channels over satellite.

The Philo T. Farnsworth Corporate Achievement Award to Evertz Technologies Limited, which is the recognized industry leader in the design, manufacture and marketing of video and audio infrastructure equipment for the production, post production, broadcast and internet protocol television.

� Emmy Award to the Joint Video Team Standards Committee (JVT) for the development of the High Profile for H.264 / MPEG-4 AVC. The High Profile enables high definition images in the H.264 video coding system used today to deliver HD video over satellite and cable TV as well as Blu-ray Disc. The JVT is a standardization team comprised of members from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).

� Emmy Award to Glenn Sanders and Howard Stark of Zaxcom, Inc., for the Deva Location Sound Recorder. Since its introduction in 1996, this device has revolutionized the entire process of location sound recording for television and has set the standard for how audio is recorded in the non-linear age.

� Engineering Plaque to Scott Leva for the Precision Stunt Air Bag Stunt falls broken by conventional air bags are dangerous, because if the stuntperson hits the bag off center, he/she risks being bounced off or sliding off onto the ground, causing serious death or injury. The Precision Stunt Air Bag is engineered to safely roll the jumper into the bag rather than bounce or let him/her slide off the bag.

� Engineering Plaque to Sebastian Cramer and Andreas Dasser for the Skater Dolly Product Family (P+S Technik GmbH) The Skater is an extremely compact and lightweight dolly and, uniquely, the only one to merge a basic camera head and a small lightweight dolly into one single unit.

� Engineering Plaque to Craige Bandy and Ed Bandy for the 360 Overhead Jib (Tricam Video Productions Company) Unlike the conventional floor-mounted 360 jibs, this device is mounted above the action and enables 360 degree moves around a subject with the camera facing toward the center or facing out.

� Engineering Plaque to Georg Dole, Swen Gerards, Jan Huewel and Daniel Schaefer for Pandoras Box (Coolux Media Systems) A complete real-time compositing media server each with a 4K workspace in dual channels of 2K HD/SD outputs for on-air and pre- and postproduction. Emmys in 28 other categories will be presented at the 2008 Primetime Emmy Awards telecast on Sunday, September 21, 2008, 8:00 p.m. - conclusion, ET/PT over the ABC Television Network at the NOKIA Theatre L.A. LIVE.
