        "text": "For many actors, producers and screenwriters, an Emmy Award represents the peak of achievement in their field. Within the glamorous world of television the Emmys are considered the most illustrious prize, the zenith of a career’s work.\n\nOn Monday evening we will learn the winners of the 75th Emmy Awards, a delayed ceremony from 2023 that was postponed due to the writers’ strike. Winners will write their names into the history books and pick up the iconic gong, but there is no financial reward on offer.\n\nThere is no prize money for winning an Emmy, although the prestige of a win can certainly help boost the recipient’s earning going forwards.\n\nHow much is an Emmy Award worth?\n\nThe only physical prize on offer on Monday evening will be the iconic Emmy statue, which is handed out to every winner. The dazzling golden trophy may look extremely valuable but iN material terms it is fairly modest.\n\nMuch of the 128-ounce trophy is largely made up of copper and nickel, dipped in liquid gold. CNBC estimates that they cost between $300 and $400 to manufacture. If the Emmy Award was made of solid gold, each trophy would cost more than $150,000 to produce.\n\nBut for would-be collectors the real value of an Emmy Award comes from the story attached to it. The awards won by legendary stars have often fetched a five-figure sum at auction."
