Endelman (“De-Lovely”) nabbed the rights from co-creator John Whitney after striking up a friendship with his daughter, Fiona. In addition to Endelman, who is writing the music, the creative team will consist of other Los Angeles-based Brits including producer Adam Matalon, who is writing the book, and singer-songwriter Matt Goss, who will be the lyricist.\n\nHedge fund founder Reagan Silber is producing the musical, which will hold workshops in Los Angeles in November, and London in January. Other financial partners will become involved as the project develops.\n\n“Other than technology, there’s very little difference between what is happening in the world today and what was going on then,” said Stephen Endelman of the show, which will use the classic “Upstairs Downstairs” characters to tell an original story set in 1911-12. “We’re still fighting; we still have a class system. I’m interested in exploring the genesis.”\n\nThe Ultimate U.S. “Celebrity Big Brother” Wish List\n\nThe recent announcement of the first-ever U.S. edition of “Celebrity Big Brother,” slated for a condensed run in the winter of 2018 on CBS, has led many “Big Brother” fans to ponder and suggest the stars they’d like to see in the house.

But admitting to these wrongdoings from yesteryear, something the mainstream media and the average American were once oblivious to, does not come without its ongoing – and surprising – present day controversy.\n\nExecutive produced by former daytime talk show host Montel Williams and actor Dean Cain, and directed by David Lee George, “Architects of Denial” tackles the organized mass murder of an estimated 1.5 million Christian citizens, most of them Armenian, by the Ottoman Empire during World War I (between 1915 and 1923), and the resistance by the Turkish government, the successor of the Ottoman Empire, and other authoritative bodies (including the United States) to admit this did indeed occur.

To listen, click here\n\nNEW PROGRAM ANNOUNCEMENTS\n\nCBS to Develop Media Drama From Dr. Mehmet Oz\n\nCBS has put into development an untitled drama, described as a hybrid of medicine and spirituality, based on Dr. Harley Rotbart’s book “Miracles We Have Seen: America’s Leading Physicians Share Stories They Can’t Forget.” The proposed series is from Joby Harold & Tory Tunnell’s Safehouse Pictures; daytime talk show Dr Mehmet Oz and his wife, producer Lisa Oz; Sony Pictures Television Studios; and CBS Television Studios.\n\nWritten by Grant Thompson (“McFarland, USA”), the drama will follow two surgeons, one who is grounded in hard data, and the other who pursues a dual mission of faith and science.\n\nVice and CBS Interactive Team Up for Tech Series “Dear Future”\n\nVice Media’s Motherboard and CBS Interactive’s CNET will be jointly producing “Dear Future,” a series focusing on technology topics incuding space travel, the ethics of genome editing, internet freedom, the future of virtual reality, robotics, artificial intelligence and the future of transportation. “Dear Future” will run on both CBSI’s CNET and Vice’s Motherboard tech sites, as well as their respective mobile and social platforms — designed to incorporate CNET’s reach with Motherboard’s established tech presence\n\n“As the world’s number one consumer tech media brand, our global audience looks to us to discover the unique stories that demonstrate how today’s technology will inform our future,” said Mark Larkin, Senior Vice President and General Manager of CNet. “This partnership enables us to combine the editorial expertise of CNET and Motherboard to produce new and unique content that showcases the possible.”\n\nFinancial terms were not disclosed.\n\nNetflix Acquires “Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond” Documentary\n\nNetflix has acquired worldwide rights to “Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond,”director Chris Smith’s deep dive into actor Jim Carrey’s time spent portraying famed and complicated comedian Andy Kaufman. Using approximately 100 hours of footage shot on the set of “Man on the Moon” documenting Carrey’s transformation into Kaufman for four months. The VICE Documentary Films production premiered at the 2017 Venice Film Festival and is produced by Spike Jonze, and VICE Films’ Danny Gabai and Brendan Fitzgerald.\n\nThe logline: In 1999 Milos Forman cast Jim Carrey to play cult comedian Andy Kaufman in his biopic “Man on the Moon.” What followed was a bizarre and emotional film production. Surrounded by Kaufman’s friends and family on set, Carrey thoroughly “became” Andy and, alternately, Tony Clifton, Kaufman’s obnoxious lounge singer alter ego. Much like Kaufman’s comedy, Carrey’s acting took on a performance art quality during the film. He never broke character on set, the cast and the crew referred to him as either ‘Andy’ or ‘Tony’ depending on who he was embodying (he had created complete and separate identities for each).\n\nJim Carrey earned critical acclaim and a Golden Globe for the performance.\n\nNEWS OF NOTE\n\nSinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. and CBS Announce Affiliation Agreement Renewals\n\nCBS Corporation and Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. have announced a multi-year deal that renews three station affiliation agreements that were set to expire at the end of 2018.

The owned stations are KGAN in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, KGBT in Harlingen, Texas and WGME in Portland, Maine, and the station to which Sinclair provides services is WTVH in Syracuse, N.Y.

Summers will present the film in person, coupled with an array of singular events, during a coast-to-coast preview screening tour revolving around the 31st anniversary of “Double Dare” next month.\n\nReflecting on his career, the “On Your Marc” tour will showcase an array of live events in each city, including performances by local bands, Q&As with special guests, celebrity hosts, and interactive “Double Dare” type games .\n\nThe scoop: In “In On Your Marc,” the Indiana native looks back on his ups and downs, as he powers through the nerve-racking production and opening night of “Everything In Its Place: The Life & Slimes of Marc Summers,” his one-man show, co-written by Broadway stars Alex Brightman (Tony-nominated lead in “School of Rock: The Musical”) and composer Drew Gasparini.

Created by Ben Newmark, Dan Newmark and Connor Pritchard, “Let’s Get Physical” centers on slacker Joe Force who makes a reluctant comeback in the fitness industry after his dad, Colonel Tom Force, a.k.a. “The Godfather of Aerobics,” unexpectedly passes away and wills his son the broken-down family gym.

To listen, click here\n\nNEW PROGRAM ANNOUNCEMENTS\n\nABC Orders Pilot for “Greatest American Hero” Reboot\n\nPotentially next in the endless stream of TV show revivals is a new version of “The Greatest American Hero” on ABC, which originally aired on the network from 1981-83. ABC has given a pilot commitment to the proposed single camera half-hour, which this time will center on Meera, a 30-year-old Indian-American woman from Cleveland who dons a superhero suit to protect the planet after being entrusted by some aliens.\n\nThe reboot is being written and produced by Rachna Fruchbom, who co-produced “Fresh off the Boat” and some wrote some episodes of “Parks and Recreation.” Tawnia McKiernan is set to direct.\n\nThe original show followed a substitute school teacher, Ralph Hinkley (William Katt) who is given an alien space suit that gives him superpowers like invisibility and super strength. However, because he loses the instruction guide, he ends up having to figure out how the suit works by making mistakes, and teams up with an FBI agent played by Robert Culp to solve crimes. Most memorable from the show, perhaps, was the hit theme song, “Believe it Or Not,” sung by Joey Scarbury.\n\nNetflix Greenlights “The Green Beret’s Guide to Surviving the Apocalypse”\n\nNetflix has given a straight-to-series order to a hybrid of non-scripted action and comedy called “The Green Beret’s Guide to Surviving the Apocalypse,” which is described as an anthology series that combines humor and usable survival skills. Each episode will chronicle its own contained apocalypse that the show’s hero somehow manages to survive.\n\n“The Green Beret’s Guide to Surviving the Apocalypse” is written, produced by and starring two military veterans, Shawn Vance, a former United States Special forces Green Beret, and Daril Fanin, a former combat army medic.

Peter Berg, Matt Goldberg and Brandon Carroll of Film 45 are also executive are producing.\n\nSERIES RENEWALS AND CANCELLATIONS\n\nShowtime Renews “I’m Dying Up Here” for Season 2\n\nShowtime has picked-up comedy “I’m Dying Up Here” for a second season, with an order for 10 new episodes. Debuting on June 4, 2017, “I’m Dying Up here” explores L.A.’s famed ’70s stand-up comedy scene. Season one starred Oscar winner Melissa Leo (“The Fighter,” “Treme”), Ari Graynor (“Bad Teacher”), Michael Angarano (“The Knick”), Clark Duke (“Hot Tub Time Machine”), Andrew Santino (“Mixology”), Erik Griffin (“Workaholics”), RJ Cyler (“Power Rangers”), Al Madrigal (“The Daily Show”) and Jake Lacy (“Obvious Child”) as part of a large ensemble cast. Created and executive produced by Dave Flebotte and executive produced by Jim Carrey, Michael Aguilar and Christina Wayne.\n\nThe series will go back into production in the fall.\n\nThe logline: “I’m Dying Up Here” delves into the inspired, damaged and complicated psyches of those who stand alone in front of an audience “dying” for fame, fortune and, with any luck, a shot on Johnny Carson. This fictional group of competitive but close-knit comedians is mentored by “Goldie” (Leo), a brassy comedy club owner who rules over her business with an iron fist, but nurtures her comedians with tough love. The series takes viewers behind the curtain of the comedy scene that birthed the careers of legends such as Richard Pryor, Robin Williams and David Letterman, showing there’s truly no such thing as an easy laugh.\n\nAmazon Cancels “The Last Tycoon”\n\nAmazon has opted against a second of F. Scott Fitzgerald drama “The Last Tycoon.” Debuting on June 16, “The Last Tycoon” starred Kelsey Grammer, Matt Bomer, and Jennifer Beals, and followed the power struggle between Bomer’s wunderkind studio executive Monroe Stahr and his boss, Grammer’s studio head Pat Brady, in 1930s Hollywood. Nine episodes in total aired and the now series finale was on July 28.\n\nJust a few days earlier, Amazon Studios scrapped plans for a second season of\n\nanother Fitzgerald drama, “Z: The Beginning of Everything,” starring Christina Ricci.\n\nThese cancellations follow the axing of several other shows that lasted only one season at Amazon Studios, including “Good Girls Revolt” and “Mad Dogs.”\n\nNEWS OF NOTE\n\n“Stranger Things” and “Westworld” Top Creative Arts Emmy Awards\n\nNetflix’s “Stranger Things,” HBO’s “Westworld” and NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” led the winner’s list at the Creative Arts Emmy Awards this past weekend, each with five wins.

Chances of a fourth season for “Zoo” is highly unlikely. And “Battle of the Network Stars” on ABC remained out of the competitive loop at a fourth-place 1.6/ 3 in the 9 p.m. hour.\n\nFor the half-hour household overnight breakdown for Thursday, August 24, click here\n\n—–\n\nLive + Same Day Ratings\n\nMonday 8/21/17: Click here\n\nTuesday 8/22/17: Click here\n\nWednesday 8/23/17: Click here\n\nSource: Nielsen Media Research\n\nNEWS OF NOTE\n\n“America’s Funniest Home Videos” on ABC Moves Back One Hour\n\nAfter over two decades anchoring ABC’s Sunday night primetime line-up at 7 p.m. ET, the network will move veteran “America’s Funniest Home Videos, hosted by Alfonso Ribeiro,” in the Sunday 8 p.m. hour.

He was 91.\n\nBorn Joseph Levitch on March 16, 1926 in Newark, New Jersey, Lewis changed his name from Joey Lewis to Jerry Lewis to avoid confusion with comedian Joe E. Lewis and boxing champion Joe Louis. His first live TV appearance with Dean Martin was on the debut of CBS variety series “Toast of the Town” on June 20, 1948 (which was later retitled “The Ed Sullivan Show”). The duo headlined 17 films together including “My Friend Irma” (1949), “That’s My Boy” (1951), “The Caddy” (1953), “The Stooge” (1954) and “Artists and Models” (1955); and they co-hosted NBC’s “The Colgate Comedy Hour” from 1950 to 1955.\n\nAfter the partnership ended on July 24, 1956, Lewis began performing regularly at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas, which led to a special on NBC in 1957, performances in night clubs across the county, appearances on game show “What’s My Line?,” movies like “The Sad Sack” (1957), “The Geisha Boy” (1958) and “Don’t Give Up the Ship” (1959), and a comic book series. Following aforementioned “The Bellboy” in 1960 came theatrical comedies like “The Ladies Man” (1961), “The Errand Boy” (1961), “The Nutty Professor” (1963), ‘The Patsy” (1964) and “The Disorderly Orderly” (1964).\n\nLewis also headlined two self-titled primetime variety series: the first on ABC in 1963 and the second for NBC from 1967 to 1969.\n\nLater films on Lewis’ resume included “The Family Jewels” (1965), which he also directed and co-wrote, “Boeing Being” (1965), “Three on a Couch” (1966) , “Way…Way Out” (1966), “The Big Mouth” (1967) and “Hook, Line & Sinker” (1969).\n\nLewis also taught a film directing class at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles for a number of years, and his students included Steven Spielberg and George Lucas.\n\nAfter an on-screen absence of 11 years, Lewis returned to film in “Hardly Working” in 1981, followed by Martin Scorsese’s “The King of Comedy” in 1983. He also made a pair of films in France in 1984, “The Defective Detective” and “How Did You Get In? We Didn’t See You Leave,” and he failed at an attempt at a syndicated talk show for Metromedia, also in 1984, which lasted for just five episodes. Later television appearances included five episodes of CBS drama “Wiseguy” and NBC sitcom “Mad About You.”\n\nLewis made his Broadway debut, as a replacement cast member playing the devil in a revival of “Damn Yankees.”\n\nLewis , of course, was also known for his efforts as national chairman of the Muscular Dystrophy Association. He devoted more than a half-century to fighting the neuromuscular disease, hosting an annual Labor Day telethon — and raising nearly $2.5 billion — from 1955 until he was ousted before the 2011 telecast. Lewis was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize in 1977 for his efforts.\n\nLewis also appeared in such films as “Cookie” (1989), “Arizona Dream” (1993), “Funny Bones” (1995) and “Max Rose” (2016), and he played opposite Nicolas Cage and Elijah Wood in “The Trust” in 2016. He also performed a cameo as himself in Billy Crystal’s “Mr. Saturday Night” in 1992 and guest-starred on a 2006 episode of “Law & Order: SVU.”\n\nWhen Lewis was 18, he met singer Patti Palmer, and they wed 10 days later. During their marriage, which lasted from 1944 to 1982, they had five sons and adopted another child. His youngest, Joseph, became a drug addict and committed suicide in 2009 at age 45.\n\nLewis married his second wife, SanDee Pitnick, in 1983. They adopted a daughter, Danielle.\n\nViola Davis and Julius Tennon to Executive Produce: “EIF Presents: XQ Super School Live”\n\nOscar winner Viola Davis and Julius Tennon will executive-produce “EIF Presents: XQ Super School Live,” a special one-hour telecast event which will invite the public to help rethink the future of American high schools. The telecast, which will combine live musical, comedy and documentary segments to bring to life the past, present and future of the American high school system, will air live from Los Angeles on ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox on Friday, Sept. 8 at 8 p.m. ET.\n\nDonald and Melania Trump to Skip “The Kennedy Center Honors”\n\nPresident Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump will not attend the annual Kennedy Center Honors in December, the White House announced Saturdaymorning, after two of the honorees, legendary television writer and producer Norman Lear and dancer and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade, said they would boycott the White House reception if Trump was present.\n\n“The President and First Lady have decided not to participate in this year’s activities to allow the honorees to celebrate without any political distraction,” a statement from the White House read.\n\nLear previously publicly said he would skip the White House reception in protest over the administration’s proposal to cut funding for the arts.\n\nAnother honoree, musician and record producer Lionel Richie, said on NBC’s “Today” show last week that he was unsure whether he would go. Also being honored are singer and songwriter Gloria Estefan and hip-hop artist and actor LL Cool J.\n\nHistorically, this will be only the fourth time in the event’s 40 years that a president will miss it. President Bill Clinton skipped in 1994 because he was headed to Budapest, Hungary, President George H.W. Bush missed 1989 because of a summit in Malta, and Jimmy Carter skipped in 1979 because of the Iran hostage crisis.\n\nThe 40th annual telecast of “The Kennedy Center Honors” will air on CBS on Sunday, December 3rd.\n\nTV Tuesday Podcast\n\nThe Programming Insider’s Douglas Insider reviews upcoming military dramas “The Brave” on NBC and “Valor” on The CW.
