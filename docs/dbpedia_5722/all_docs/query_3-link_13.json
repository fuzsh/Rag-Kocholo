Read our privacy policy\n\nThe 75th Primetime Emmy Awards aired on Monday (15 January) following a four-month delay, with the best talent in television gathering in Los Angeles for a shimmering ceremony.\n\nThe annual celebration of the year’s most brilliant TV shows took place half a year after nominations were announced back in July.\n\nThe ceremony was originally scheduled for September but was pushed back due to the Hollywood writer and actor strikes that brought the industry to a standstill last year. As such, these awards honoured shows that aired between 1 June 2022 and 31 May 2023, meaning it felt a bit like deja vu.\n\nThe show with the most nominations was Succession, the fourth and final season of which aired on HBO last year. The drama took home six awards. Fellow HBO dramas The Last of Us and The White Lotus were also heavily nominated, but failed to compete in terms of wins on the night.\n\nNetflix’s limited series Beef and Hulu’s comedy The Bear also saw a raft of big wins at the ceremony.\n\nYou can find a full list of all the winners here.\n\nThe Bear stars share lengthy on-stage kiss after Emmys win\n\nEbon Moss-Bachrach planted a huge kiss on Matty Matheson’s lips after The Bear won Best Comedy Series.\n\n“I just want to thank restaurants as a whole, hospitality as a whole,” TV chef-turned-actor Matheson began on stage. But before he could finish, Moss-Bachrach – who plays Cousin Richie on the show – grabbed Mattheson by the sides of his head and pulled him in for a lengthy smooch, causing shocked reactions from their cast mates and cheers from the audience.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Bear stars share surprising, lengthy on-stage kiss after Emmys win\n\n‘The Bear’ won a total of six awards at the 75th Primetime Emmys\n\nTom Murray16 January 2024 08:59\n\nAyo Edebiri says she dreamed of dental insurance growing up, not awards\n\nTom Murray16 January 2024 08:28\n\nEmmys host Anthony Anderson gives verdict on Jo Koy\n\nThe day of the Emmys, host Anthony Anderson weighed in on Jo Koy’s controversial performance at last week’s Golden Globes.\n\nIn the days since Koy’s widely-panned hosting job, the 52-year-old stand-up comedian has apologised for throwing his writers under the bus during his monologue.\n\nReacting to the outcry, Anderson told Fox News: “Everyone’s entitled to their opinion. There’s going to be criticism.”\n\nRead more:\n\nEmmys host Anthony Anderson on Jo Koy at Golden Globes: ‘You can’t please everyone’\n\n‘Black-ish’ star commented: ‘Everyone’s entitled to their opinion’\n\nTom Murray16 January 2024 07:59\n\nWhy wasn’t The Morning Show nominated for any Emmys?\n\nMany fans of The Morning Show were wondering why the Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston-fronted series received a grand total of zero nominations at the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards.\n\nFear not, Apple TV’s duo have not been snubbed by voters – the show is simply ineligible this time around.\n\nThese Emmys are a postponed version of the 2023 ceremony, which was delayed due to the Hollywood strikes. As such, tonight’s awards honour shows that aired between 1 June 2022 and 31 May 2023. The Morning Show’s recent third season, which aired from 13 September to 8 November 2023, won’t be eligible until next time around.\n\nTom Murray16 January 2024 07:20\n\nVideo: Laverne Cox mispronounces Hannah Waddingham’s name on Emmys red carpet\n\nTom Murray16 January 2024 06:49\n\nAubrey Plaza’s yellow dress sparks memes\n\nWhile posing outside of the Peacock Theater, Plaza turned heads with her look: a yellow dress with a giant sewing needle poked through the square-cut top. She paired the floor-length gown, which was designed by Loewe, with silver earrings and rings, while she wore her hair in a half-ponytail.\n\nOn X, formerly known as Twitter, Plaza’s outfit divided viewers, with many reacting with memes about the front of the dress resembling a Post-it note.\n\nFind the best reactions here:\n\nAubrey Plaza’s yellow dress at 2024 Emmys sparks hilarious memes\n\nActor was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series award for her role in ‘The White Lotus’\n\nTom Murray16 January 2024 06:18\n\nAll the best looks from the 2024 Emmy Awards\n\nHollywood’s favourite faces walked the red carpet outside Los Angeles’ Peacock Theater in gowns and tuxedoes that didn’t fail to turn heads.\n\nWe learned that red won’t be going anywhere this season, as it proved to be a favourite among attendees, with Grey’s Anatomy alum Katherine Heigl, Abbott Elementary’s Janelle James, and Daisy Jones and The Six’s Camila Morrone all stunning in simple, yet elegant red gowns. Old Hollywood glamour was also on display on the red carpet, with many stars arriving in their best satin skirts, feathered dresses, and silver or gold statement necklaces.\n\nFind all the best looks here:\n\nEmmy Awards 2024: The best-dressed celebrities on this year’s red carpet\n\nThe star-studded event is taking place at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles\n\nTom Murray16 January 2024 05:50\n\nVideo: Pedro Pascal’s joke about Kieran Culkin censored by Emmys broadcast\n\nTom Murray16 January 2024 05:19\n\nEmmys 2024 sees Succession, Beef and The Bear share the vast majority of spoils\n\n“It might be remembered as a three-way battle, but there was no real battle about it,” writes Louis Chilton. “HBO’s universally acclaimed drama Succession ended the night as the most prolific victor, winning a total of six awards in the drama categories, including Best Series, Best Actor (for Kieran Culkin), Best Actress (for Sarah Snook) and Best Supporting Actor (for Matthew Macfadyen).\n\n“The comedy strand, meanwhile, was dominated by FX’s knife-edge culinary comedy The Bear, with Jeremy Allen White, Ayo Edebiri and Ebon Moss-Bachrach taking home three of the four acting prizes. And in the limited series field, it was Netflix’s tit-for-tat thriller Beef that won the night, garnering five wins.”\n\nFind The Independent’s full wrap story from this year’s Emmys here:\n\nTom Murray16 January 2024 05:14\n\nKieran Culkin asks wife for more kids\n\nThe Succession star, who won the award for Best Actor in a Drama Series for his performance as the mischievous, foul-mouthed Roman Roy, used his speech to tell his wife Jazz Charton: “Thank you for sharing your life with me and giving me two amazing kids... I want more. You said ‘maybe’, if I win! I love you so much.”\n\nIn response, Charton could be seen covering her face with her hands in a mixture of joy and shock.\n\nCulkin, 41, and Charton, 35, share two children together: Kinsey Sioux and Wilder Wolf.\n\nRead more:\n\nKieran Culkin asks wife for more kids as he accepts Best Actor prize at 2024 Emmys\n\nActor beat co-stars Brian Cox and Jeremy Strong to win the award\n\nTom Murray16 January 2024 04:19"
