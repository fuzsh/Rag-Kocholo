        "text": "Variety Awards Circuit section is the home for all awards news and related content throughout the year, featuring the following: the official predictions for the upcoming Oscars, Emmys, Grammys and Tony Awards ceremonies, curated by Variety senior awards editor Clayton Davis. The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\nVisit the prediction pages for the respective ceremonies via the links below:\n\nOSCARS | EMMYS | GRAMMYS | TONYS\n\n2024 Emmy Predictions:\n\nOutstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or TV Movie\n\nWeekly Commentary (Updated: July 11, 2024): Jon Hamm (“Fargo”) and Andrew Scott (“Ripley”) seem to be the frontrunners in the race, with Richard Gadd (“Baby Reindeer”) offering the potential to spoil. However, who joins them remains to be seen, as Matt Bomer could be a packaged deal with his “Fellow Travelers” supporting frontrunner Jonathan Bailey. Still, David Oyelowo, Tom Hollander, Jeff Daniels and Ewan McGregor have ardent fans who could push anyone out. Even Austin Butler, who had “The Bikeriders” open in theaters during Emmy voting, could get a boost for “Masters of the Air.”\n\n_______________\n\nBig names like Andrew Scott (“Ripley”), Jon Hamm (“Fargo”) and Jeff Daniels (“A Man in Full”) are among the 70 names in the race, paired with those from TV movies such as Tony Shalhoub (“Monk’s Last Case: A Monk Movie”) and Nicholas Galitzine with two bids for “Red, White and Royal Blue” and the limited series “Mary & George.” The past two years saw 97 and 64. Unfortunately, this has made the race even more competitive because only five actors will make the lineup.\n\nWhile Scott and Hamm sit comfortably at the top of the list, Matt Bomer (“Fellow Travelers”) and Richard Gadd (“Baby Reindeer”) are sure to make some headway, with the possibility of either Jeff Daniels (“A Man in Full”) and David Oyelowo (“Lawmen: Bass Reeves”) slipping through.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine there won’t be at least one jaw-dropper from any of the Primetime lineups (does anyone remember “Emily in Paris” making it in the comedy series race in 2021?). Even though “The Idol” and the performance of Abel Tesfaye, a.k.a. The Weeknd, was panned by critics and audiences, you can never count out strange tastes from voters of the Actors Peer Group. What if…?\n\nNominations-round voting is open from June 13 and closes on June 24 at 10:00 p.m. PT. Voting for peer group-specific top ten round panels (if applicable) takes place between June 28 and July 8. The Emmy nominations will be announced on July 17. The Creative Arts and Governors Gala ceremonies will occur over two nights on Sept. 7-8. The 76th Primetime Emmy Awards will air on ABC on Sunday, Sept. 15."
