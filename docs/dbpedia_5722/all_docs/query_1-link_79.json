        "text": "Deceased November 29, 1993\n\nView alumni profile (log in required)\n\nRead obituary\n\nIn Memory\n\nBill Johnson died on Nov. 29, 1993, at his home in Manhattan. His companion, William Hibsher, who was with him at his death, said he died of complications from AIDS.\n\nBill will be remembered as brilliant, compassionate and self-effacing. “He was always the smartest person in any room but never flaunted his brilliance.” “He was kind, funny, caring and unfailingly decent.” “He was not a man of the grand gesture but of the constructive act.” “He was somebody you could always turn to. If there were something you needed to sort out, you could call him and he’d be there for you, with all his tremendous intellect and compassion.” “There was never a trace of arrogance about him.”\n\nBill was born in Brooklyn and raised in Teaneck, N.J. While at Amherst, after many trips back and forth to Barnard in his old Volvo, he married his high school sweetheart, “two of the smartest kids at Teaneck High School. They lived in an apartment off campus.\n\nHe seemed to sail through Amherst with effortless brilliance, becoming an independent studies scholar in economics. His desk was usually totally empty, except for a neat little list of tasks.\n\nFollowing Amherst, Bill was offered a Woodrow Wilson Scholarship but chose to go to Yale Law School where he graduated in 1973 to begin a distinguished career in international tax law. He began his law practice in San Francisco and later founded the Los Angeles firm of Gelles, Singer and Johnson, before returning to New York in 1983 where he joined the firm of Wesley & Schneider. At the time of his death, he was a member of Brobeck Dale & Dorr International.\n\nThroughout his career, Bill represented U.S. and international corporations, financiers and members of royal families. He was also attorney for and a trustee of the Harry Packard Collection Charitable Trust. He helped conceive of the Packard Trust’s sale and gift of Japanese art works to the Metropolitan Museum in 1976. He was so young (and looked younger) and modest, and the transaction so large and complex, that the Met privately checked with Yale to verify that Bill was indeed who he said he was. The resulting deal was, at that time, the Met’s largest acquisition, and the works acquired form the bulk of the museum’s Japanese galleries today.\n\nBut his skills were more than technical. He was the member the firm would turn to if there were a delicate division to make, because they knew he would be clear-headed and fair. “Let Billy do it.” He became a friend to clients. An associate helping refer clients near the end of Bill’s life commented on how many said they loved him.\n\nBill provided various pro bono services for numerous lesbian and gay institutions. In 1983, he helped found the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center in New York with characteristic efficiency. For months, the Center had been trying to attain a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status with the help of a large law firm, working pro bono and earning every penny of their fee. Bill was very busy at the time—he’d just relocated to New York, was working at a new law firm and had commenced sharing a home with Bill Hibsher. But within two weeks, the Center’s tax-exempt status was a reality, and 10 years later, the Center is an invaluable part of New York’s gay and lesbian community. He also performed legal services for the Community Research Initiative, the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, the Hotrick-Martin Institute and others.\n\nIn 1987, as Bill and Bill contemplated their desire for a shared legacy of their lives, they established—and named, with characteristic disregard for the pompous and the solemn—the Bills Foundation. The Foundation has provided charitable grants to numerous civil rights, social service and AIDS research organizations whose missions reflect the world as the Bills feel it should be.\n\nIn 1988, TWA’s frequent flyer program denied Bill Hibsher a ticket as Bill Johnson’s partner. He filed a lawsuit and won. The settlement was TWA permitting members to share their mileage awards to travel with members of their “nontraditional” families was subsequently adopted by most U.S. carriers.\n\nIn spite of Bill’s natural reserve, and his tendency to deflect attention from himself, he lived his life as an openly gay man, and dedicated himself to helping those close to him—friends, business associates and his family—grow to understand and appreciate that this was one aspect of the man they loved. That Bill Hibsher has been embraced wholly as a member of Bill’s family is a testament to them and a testament to Bill Johnson.\n\nBill was “half of a perfect couple.” They loved each other with a depth that few of us ever see or experience. The Bills were collectively bigger than the sum of their parts. They created joy around them just be being together—their palpable affection and mutual respect, their loyalty and devotion to friends. They had a second home in East Taghkanic, N.Y., where they spent many magical weekends with friends.\n\nIn addition to Bill Hibsher, Bill is survived by his mother, Estelle Johnson Silverman, and his sister, Susan Azaria Kanrich.\n\nServices were held on Dec. 1, 1993, which was World AIDS Day, at the Riverside Chapel in New York. Over 500 people came to pay their respects, perhaps one measure of the enormous effect of Bill’s life and the magnitude of our loss."
