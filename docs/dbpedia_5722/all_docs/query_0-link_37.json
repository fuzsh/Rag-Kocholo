        "text": "Film Composer of the Year\n\nReflecting yet another impressive year of film music, the category Film Composer of the Year honours five composers for their body of work over the past year. Most notable is Swedish composer Ludwig Göransson, who recently won an Oscar for his score for Christopher Nolan’s historical thriller Oppenheimer. After two previous nominations, Oppenheimer marks a new opportunity for Göransson to take home a WSAward. Joining him in the list of nominees is Jerskin Fendrix, known for his collaborations with Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos. The British singer-songwriter made his film music debut with his score for the director’s Poor Things, which earned him not only an Oscar-nomination, but also the Georges Delerue Award during Film Fest Gent’s 50th anniversary edition. His second, more challenging score for Lanthimos’ Kinds of Kindness is also included in this nomination. Winner of more than fifteen WSA-awards, Hans Zimmer returns with another nomination. The German composer and producer was guest of honour at the WSA’s first film music concert in 2000, which was the first-ever live performance of his film scores. He returns with two epic soundtracks: his scores for sci-fi blockbuster Dune: Part Two and for the AI-themed action film The Creator. Scoring her first ever WSA nomination is Laura Karpman, composer of the Oscar-nominated comedy American Fiction and co-founder of the Alliance for Women Film Composers. Considered within the nomination - in addition to American Fiction - are her scores for The Marvels and the critically acclaimed biopic Rock Hudson: All That Heaven Allowed. British composer Anthony Willis closes the list with his symphonic and electronic score for the provoking period drama Saltburn. After his 2022 Discovery Award-nomination for Promising Young Woman, he now has the chance to win one of WSA’s most prestigious awards.\n\nTelevision Composer of the Year\n\nThe nominees in the category Television Composer of the Year prove that the golden age of television is far from over. Nearly all the contenders for this award, which celebrates a composer’s body of work of the past year, have proven their craftsmanship by collecting multiple WSA nominations. Martin Phipps, however, has earned his very first nomination. After taking over from Lorne Balfe and Rupert Gregson-Williams in 2019, the British composer has scored all following seasons of The Crown and is now nominated for his remarkable score for the sixth and final season. His colleague and longtime co-composer, Natalie Holt is now nominated for the third time. Known for her work for Marvel Studios, she once again manages to shape the Marvel Cinematic Universe with her compelling soundtrack for Loki S02. Evoking a whole other universe, Nick Chuba, Atticus Ross and Leopold Ross are nominated for their score for the Japanese samurai series Shōgun. Their attempt to fuse western and Japanese musical styles was challenging but rewarding, and has led to a fourth nomination for Atticus Ross. Leaving high expectations after winning this award in 2021, Carlos Rafael Rivera returns with three new scores. His nominations include his scores for crime series Griselda and Monsieur Spade and his Emmy-nominated score for Lessons in Chemistry. After scoring five seasons of Fargo, the American composer Jeff Russo is now nominated for his score for the fifth season of this Hulu thriller series. Also part of this nomination is his musically rich score for the crime series Ripley, an adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s well-known novel. Lastly, the WSAcademy recognized multi-award winning composer James Newton Howard. Translating the trauma of the second World War to a compelling soundtrack, his score for All the Light We Cannot See is stellar in its own right.\n\nBest Original Song\n\nHighlighting no less than seven songs, the category Best Original Song celebrates “the power of music to make other people smile”, as 2023 winners Thomas Mizer and Curtis Moore declared at last year’s award ceremony. With three nominations, Barbie runs the competition. Pop phenomenon Dua Lipa is nominated for the upbeat “Dance The Night”, written together with Mark Ronson, Andrew Wyatt and Caroline Ailin. With the sorrowful “What Was I Made For?” Billie Eilish and Finneas O'Connell have a new chance at taking home the award, after their 2022 win. And, thirdly, Andrew Wyatt and Mark Ronson are nominated for the iconic “I'm Just Ken”, performed by Ryan Gosling. Also featured in this category is Scott George’s “Wahzhazhe (A Song for My People)”, used in the final scene of Killers of the Flower Moon. The song’s recent Oscar nomination is considered a turning point in film music history, because it was written and performed by members of the Osage Nation, the American-Indian tribe that figures in the film. With “Road to Freedom” rock icon Lenny Kravitz makes a different but equally important political statement. Featuring in the Netflix series Rustin, this song makes a case for equal rights in a divided American society. Singer-songwriter Jon Batiste is nominated for ‘It Never Went Away’, written together with Dan Wilson for American Symphony, a biographical documentary about Batiste’s booming career and moving life story. Dedicated to his wife’s courageous struggle with leukaemia, the song is a declaration of unceasing love. Lastly, The WSAcademy nominated the catchy musical number “You’ve Never Had Chocolate Like This”, written by Neil Hannon, Paul King, Simon Farnaby for Wonka, the 2023 prequel of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."
