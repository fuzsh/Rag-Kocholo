First given out in 1949, the award was originally referred to as simply the \"Emmy Awards\" until the first Daytime Emmy Award ceremony was held in 1974 and the word \"prime time\" was added to distinguish between the two.\n\nThe Primetime Emmy Awards generally air every September, on the Sunday before the official start of the fall television season. Since 1995, the Emmys have been broadcast in rotation among the four major networks (ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC), each network taking turns to air the ceremony every four years. The ceremony is typically moved to late-August if it is broadcast by NBC (such as in 2006, 2010, and 2014), so that it does not conflict with NBC's commitment to broadcasting Sunday-night NFL games (due to another conflict, this time with the MTV Video Music Awards, the 2014 ceremony was also shifted to a Monday).[1] The 2018 ceremony, broadcast by NBC, was moved back to September and aired on a Monday.\n\nThey are considered television's equivalent to the Academy Awards (film), Grammy Awards (music), and Tony Awards (theater). The awards are divided into three categories: Primetime Emmy Awards, Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, and Primetime Engineering Emmy Awards.\n\nRules[]\n\nAmong the Primetime Emmy Award rules, a show must originally air on American television during the eligibility period between June 1 and May 31 of any given year. In order to be considered a national primetime show, the program must air between 6:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m., and to at least 50 percent of the country. A show that enters into the Primetime Emmy Awards cannot also be entered into the Daytime Emmy Awards or any other national Emmy competition. For shows in syndication, whose air times vary between media markets, they can either be entered in the Daytime or Primetime Emmy Awards (provided they still reach the 50 percent national reach), but not in both. For game shows that reach the 50 percent threshold, they can be entered into the Daytime Emmy Awards if they normally air before 8 p.m (including the former \"access hour\" from 7:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.); otherwise, they are only eligible for the Primetime Emmy Awards. For web television programs, they must be available for downloading or streaming to more than 50 percent of the country, and like shows in syndication they can only enter in one of the national Emmy competitions.\n\nShows that are offered for pre-sale to consumers, whether on home video devices or via the Web, are ineligible if the pre-sale period starts more than 7 days before the show's initial airing. Also, a show that receives what the Academy calls a \"general theatrical release\" before its first airing (either via television or the Internet) is ineligible. The definition of this phrase excludes limited releases for the specific purpose of award qualification, such as screenings at film festivals or the one-week releases in Los Angeles (and, for documentaries, New York City as well) required for Oscar eligibility.[2]\n\nEntries must be submitted by the end of April, even if a show is not scheduled to originally air until the following month when the eligibility period ends in May. Most award categories also require entries to include DVDs or tape masters of the show. For most series categories, any six episodes that originally aired during the eligibility period must be submitted (programs that were cancelled before airing their sixth episode are thus ineligible). For most individual achievement categories, only one episode is required to be submitted; if an episode is a two-parter, both parts may be included on the submitted DVD.\n\nBallots to select the nominations are sent to Academy members in June. For most categories, members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories. All members can however vote for nominations in the best program categories. The final voting poll to determine the winners is held in August, and is done by judging panels. In June, the Academy solicits volunteers among its active members to serve on these panels. All active members may serve on the program panels; otherwise they are restricted to those categories within their own branch.\n\nCategories[]\n\nPrimetime Emmy Awards[]\n\nThe Primetime Emmy Award is awarded in the following categories:\n\nPage Template:Col-float/styles.css has no content.\n\nPage Template:Col-float/styles.css has no content.\n\nPrimetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards[]\n\nThe Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards are awarded in the following categories (some of which separately recognize work based on whether a single-camera or multi-camera setup was used):\n\nPage Template:Col-float/styles.css has no content.\n\nPage Template:Col-float/styles.css has no content.\n\nPrimetime Emmy Engineering Awards[]\n\nThe Primetime Engineering Emmy Awards are given specifically for outstanding achievement in engineering. They are presented to an individual, company, or organization for engineering developments so significant an improvement on existing methods or so innovative in nature that they materially affect the transmission, recording, or reception of television. The award, which is television's highest engineering honor, is determined by a jury of highly qualified, experienced engineers in the television industry.\n\nPage Template:Div col/styles.css has no content.\n\nRetired categories[]\n\nA number of awards have been retired throughout the years, including some that have been replaced by similar award categories in the Daytime Emmy Awards, Sports Emmy Awards, and other areas of recognition:\n\nPage Template:Div col/styles.css has no content.\n\n† Replaced by a similar category in the Sports Emmy Awards\n\n‡ Replaced by a similar category in the Daytime Emmy Awards\n\nRecords[]\n\nOverall wins for a performer, program, etc.[]\n\nMost wins for a network in a single year\n\nCBS – 44 (1974) [3][4]\n\nMost wins for a series in a single year\n\nGame of Thrones – 12 (2015–2016, 2019) [5][6][7]\n\nMost wins for a Comedy Series in single year\n\nSchitt's Creek – 9 (2020) [8]\n\nMost wins for a Television Program\n\nSaturday Night Live – 84 [9]\n\nMost wins for a Comedy Series\n\nFrasier – 37 [10]\n\nMost wins for a Drama Series\n\nGame of Thrones – 59 [5][7][11]\n\nMost wins for a Limited Series\n\nJohn Adams – 13 [12]\n\nMost wins for a single episode\n\n\"Boardwalk Empire\" (Boardwalk Empire) – 6 (2011) [13][14]\n\n\"Battle of the Bastards\" (Game of Thrones) – 6 (2016) [5][14]\n\nMost wins for a Television Movie\n\nBehind the Candelabra and Eleanor and Franklin – 11 [15][16]\n\nMost wins for an Animated Program\n\nThe Simpsons – 34 [17]\n\nMost wins for a Variety, Music, or Comedy Special\n\nThe Kennedy Center Honors – 15 [18]\n\nMost wins for a Variety, Music, or Comedy Series\n\nSaturday Night Live – 84 [9]\n\nMost wins for a Reality-Competition Program\n\nDancing with the Stars – 17 [19]\n\nMost wins for acting in a Comedy Series\n\nThe Mary Tyler Moore Show – 16 [20]\n\nMost wins for acting in a Drama Series\n\nBreaking Bad, The Sopranos, and The West Wing – 9 [21][22][23]\n\nMost wins for acting in a Limited Series\n\nAngels in America – 4 [24]\n\nMost wins for acting in a Television Movie\n\nThe Glass Menagerie – 4 [25]\n\nMost wins for an online-streaming original program\n\nThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel – 20[26]\n\nMost wins for an Animated Program in a single year\n\nThe Simpsons – 6 (1992) [17]\n\nMost wins for a performer for the same role in the same series\n\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus as Selina Meyer for Veep – 6 (2012–2017) [27][28]\n\nMost wins for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Competition Program\n\nRuPaul Charles for RuPaul's Drag Race – 5 (2016–2020)\n\nMost wins for Outstanding Drama Series\n\nHill Street Blues – 4 (1981–1984) [29]\n\nL.A.
