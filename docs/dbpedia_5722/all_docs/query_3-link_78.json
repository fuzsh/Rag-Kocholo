        "text": "The 2024 Emmy Awards are coming fast; it’s another year of celebrating the excellence in television comedy. This year’s nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series feature a few familiar faces as well as a few first-time nominees.\n\nLionel ‘L-Boy’ Boyce\n\nNominated for: The Bear\n\nPrevious Nominations: N/A\n\nHidden Gem: The Jellies! (2015, 2017-2019)\n\nBefore his acting career, Lionel Boyce was a member of Odd Future: a collective that also included names like Tyler, the Creator, Earl Sweatshirt, and The Internet’s Syd tha Kid. Although Odd Future was primarily known for their music, their creative endeavors spread into comedy. Apart from a short cameo in Jackass: Forever, Boyce also spearheaded Odd Future’s two series for Adult Swim: Loiter Squad, a short sketch comedy series, and The Jellies!\n\nWhere his previous work is edgy, subversive, and sometimes goofy Boyce’s turn as Chef Marcus in The Bear has consistently brought a necessary warmth to a show. This is his first Emmy nomination.\n\nPaul W. Downs\n\nNominated for: Hacks\n\nPrevious Nominations: Outstanding Comedy Series (2021 & 2022), Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series (2021, win) (2022)\n\nHidden Gem: Netflix Presents: The Characters (2016)\n\nPaul W. Downs’ career in comedy has largely been behind the scenes. He started in digital shorts with his creative partner/wife Lucia Aniello, who he’s worked with almost exclusively since. Prior to Hacks, his biggest acting role was on Broad City as Abbi’s boss-turned-partner Trey Parker. He’s largely worked in comedy writing.\n\nIn addition to co-creating, co-executive producing, and co-writing Hacks, Downs became a series regular in the show’s most recent season as Deborah and Ava’s perpetually stressed manager Jimmy LuSaque Jr. This is his first nomination for an acting Emmy. He’s previously been nominated twice for Outstanding Comedy Series and nominated twice for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, winning in 2021.\n\nEbon Moss-Bachrach\n\nNominated for: The Bear\n\nPrevious Nominations: Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series (2023, win)\n\nHidden Gem: NOS4A2 (2019-2020)\n\nEbon Moss-Bachrach is certainly having his moment right now. Between his casting in the upcoming Fantastic Four and his turns in Andor and No Hard Feelings. But, Bachrach has a twenty-five year long career in film and television, starting with small parts in various Law and Orders and films like The Royal Tenenbaums. His turn in the television adaptation of Joe Hill’s NOS4A2 showed his capability to play both a reprehensible scumbag and a loving father figure.\n\nAfter the cancellation of NOS4A2 in 2020 and a short turn in Andor, Bachararch joined the cast of The Bear as the beloved restaurant manager Richie. This role has already garnered him one Emmy nomination/win.\n\nPaul Rudd\n\nNominated for: Only Murders in the Building\n\nPrevious Nominations: N/A\n\nHidden Gem: The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2013)\n\nPaul Rudd has been a staple of Hollywood comedy for over two decades. He’s carved out a role as the usually smarmy, egotistical guy with a bit of heart in a ton of works produced and/or directed by Judd Apatow and as Ant-Man in various Marvel properties. He’s also had a fair share of non-dramatic roles, like his lovely understated performance as Mr. Anderson in The Perks of Being a Wallflower and as Tommy Doyle in the abysmal Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers.\n\nRudd’s work in Only Murders in the Building as Ben Glenroy is a much more mature, developed version of the character archetype that he’s known and loved for. This is Rudd’s first Emmy nomination.\n\nTyler James Williams\n\nNominated for: Abbot Elementary\n\nPrevious Nominations: Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series (2022 & 2023)\n\nHidden Gem: Harley Quinn: A Very Problematic Valentines Day Special (2023)\n\nTyler James Williams has been a consistent presence in television since he was a child. From recurring appearances on Saturday Night Live and Sesame Street to a starring role on Everybody Hates Chris, Williams’ early career was quite prolific. He’s remained a fixture on television with live action roles on The Walking Dead and various Disney Channel shows as well as voice acting like in the fantastic A Very Problematic Valentine’s Day Special.\n\nWilliams’ work on Abbot Elementary has made him a fan-favorite. Gregory Eddie’s layers of understated goofiness and genuine care for both his students and his fellow teachers has made him part of the heart of the show. This is Williams’ third Emmy nomination.\n\nBowen Yang\n\nNominated for: Saturday Night Live\n\nPrevious Nominations: Outstanding Writer for a Variety Series (2019), Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series (2022 & 2023)\n\nHidden Gem: Dicks: The Musical (2023)\n\nBowen Yang’s run on Saturday Night Live is nothing short of iconic. He’s the first Chinese-American and third gay male cast member as well as the first cast member nominated for a Primetime Emmy. Apart from his writing and acting work on SNL, including the ‘gayest sketch ever’ with Emma Stone in 2018, Yang has starred in a bunch of big queer comedies like Fire Island, Bros, and the film adaptation of Dicks: The Musical.\n\nYang’s work on SNL has injected a fun, new voice into the nearly fifty-year-old sketch comedy juggernaut. He’s previously been nominated once for his writing and twice for his acting."
