        "text": "Television’s biggest awards show normally takes place in mid-September, but due to the Hollywood writers and actors strikes, the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards—technically the “2023 Emmys”—are coming right in the middle of the 2024 awards season that saw the Golden Globes given out last week, the Critics Choice Awards last night, and Oscar nominees to be revealed next week.\n\nThe Television Academy unveiled the Emmy nominees last July, considering all programs that premiered nationally between June 1, 2022, and May 31, 2023. And based on the Academy voting schedule, many of tonight’s winners were actually decided back in August, which may result in an unusual—and possibly confusing—ceremony that recognizes work from seemingly dated shows.\n\nThe Primetime Emmy ceremony at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles began at 8:00 p.m. ET on Jan. 15, broadcast live on Fox and streaming on Hulu Tuesday.\n\nRead More: The Best and Worst Moments of This Year’s Emmy Awards\n\nWho won what?\n\nSuccession, HBO’s recently concluded show about power-grabbing and back-stabbing within a family-owned media conglomerate, and The Bear, FX/Hulu’s kitchen dramedy that was recognized for its first season despite already airing an acclaimed second season, came out as the night’s biggest winners, closely followed by Netflix’s road-rage inspired limited series Beef.\n\nHere are all the winners, in order of announcement:\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series: Ayo Edebiri, The Bear\n\nOutstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series: Quinta Brunson, Abbott Elementary\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series: Jennifer Coolidge, The White Lotus\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series: Matthew Macfadyen, Succession\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series: Ebon Moss-Bachrach, The Bear\n\nOutstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series: Jeremy Allen White, The Bear\n\nOutstanding Scripted Variety Series: Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie: Niecy Nash-Betts, Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story\n\nOutstanding Directing for a Comedy Series: Christopher Storer, The Bear\n\nOutstanding Writing for a Comedy Series: Christopher Storer, The Bear\n\nOutstanding Reality Competition Series: RuPaul’s Drag Race\n\nOutstanding Writing for a Variety Series: Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\n\nOutstanding Talk Series: The Daily Show With Trevor Noah\n\nOutstanding Directing for a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie: Lee Sung Jin, Beef\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie: Paul Walter Hauser, Black Bird\n\nOutstanding Writing for a Drama Series: Jesse Armstrong, Succession\n\nOutstanding Writing for a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie: Lee Sung Jin, Beef\n\nOutstanding Directing for a Drama Series: Mark Mylod, Succession\n\nOutstanding Variety Special (Live): Elton John Live: Farewell From Dodger Stadium\n\nOutstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie: Steven Yeun, Beef\n\nOutstanding Lead Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie: Ali Wong, Beef\n\nOutstanding Limited or Anthology Series: Beef\n\nGovernor’s Award: GLAAD\n\nOutstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series: Kieran Culkin, Succession\n\nOutstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series: Sarah Snook, Succession\n\nOutstanding Comedy Series: The Bear\n\nOutstanding Drama Series: Succession\n\nRead More: One Show Now Has the Unfortunate Honor of Losing the Most Emmys\n\nWho was the host?\n\nAnthony Anderson, the 53-year-old former actor and producer of ABC’s sitcom Black-ish, which ended its run in 2022, was on first-time hosting duty.\n\nBut even before taking the stage, Anderson’s selection has already been met with criticism—sexual assault allegations against him resurfaced online, followed by (unheeded) calls for him to be replaced. Anderson faced assault allegations, which he has denied, in 2004 of raping a 25-year-old extra on the set of one of his films, but the charges were later dropped. In 2018, another unspecified criminal complaint emerged, with Anderson “unequivocally disputing” the claim.\n\nAll eyes would be on Anderson, especially after the heavily criticized emceeing by Filipino-American stand-up comedian Jo Koy at the Golden Globes last week. Anderson, aware of the expectations and potential for controversy, told Fox News that “it’s a job that needs to be done” and “you can’t please everyone.” Meanwhile, he told the Associated Press that—given he is not a nominee for the first time in nearly a decade—he’s going in with less pressure: “I don’t have to sit there and wonder, am I going to win? Am I going to get it? What time are they going to get to this category? I just get to come up here and be myself.”\n\nIn a recent interview with People, Anderson said his mother, Doris Bowman, would be joining him at the show. “I can’t host the Emmys without having Mama Doris on the stage with me, so we’re finding some smart ways to incorporate her into the show,” he told the magazine.\n\nWho were the nominees?\n\nAt the top of the list was Succession, with 27 nominations for its final season, including one for Outstanding Drama Series and three nominations for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series—for the performances of Brian Cox, Kieran Culkin, and Jeremy Strong.\n\nThe Last of Us, HBO’s zombie apocalypse show adapted from a popular video game, was nominated in 24 award categories, including Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for star Bella Ramsey and Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for co-star Pedro Pascal. The show already racked up several awards at last week’s Creative Arts Emmys, with actors Nick Offerman and Storm Reid recognized for their guest performances in a drama series.\n\nHBO’s The White Lotus also had 23 Emmy nominations, already winning the Outstanding Casting for a Drama Series and Outstanding Music Composition for a Series (Original Dramatic Score) awards at the Creative Arts Emmys last week.\n\nApple TV+’s soccer sitcom Ted Lasso followed, nominated in 21 categories and already winning for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics last week."
