        "text": "When former Kennebunk resident Harold Burbank heard that his old friend William Johnson had come dangerously close to death in a skiing accident, he called Johnson's mother to see what he could do to help.\n\nThe answer he got was simple and to the point: anything.\n\nWhen the XIX Olympic Winter Games opened in Salt Lake City earlier this month, Johnson was one of the athletes handing the torch on to the U.S. Hockey Team who took the gold in 1980.\n\nHe was recognized at a ceremony preceding the alpine skiing events, supplied with tickets for friends and family and with a USOC escort for the games. Burbank was right there with him.\n\nTwo months before the 1984 XIV Winter Olympic Games were held in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, Johnson seemed an unlikely candidate to win the country's first gold medal in alpine skiing.\n\nBut win he did, and 17 years later he was on his way to an Olympic comeback at the age of 40, ranking number 12 in the U.S. at the Nor-Am level. On March 22, 2001 at Big Mountain, Montana Johnson's skis came off and he went through three protective fences. He was, Burbank said, clinically dead for a while.\n\nBurbank, who captained three ski teams while a student at Kennebunk High School, had trained with Johnson back in 1975 and 1976 in the mountains of Oregon. He was forerunner for Johnson - Burbank skied down the mountain first to make sure the course was safe enough for the skiers in training.\n\nJohnson \"was rising through the ranks much more quickly than I was,\" said Burbank, who had left Maine which had no ski racing academy for the mountains of Oregon and a longer snow season.\n\nAfter a year's training from September to the middle of May and a second year of drought, Burbank returned to Maine and to school.\n\n\"We lost touch for the next 25 years. Bill [Johnson] went on to become famous and then in 2001, he announced a comeback and got ranked as 12th in the U.S. at the Nor-Am level at the age of 40,\" Burbank said.\n\nThen Johnson wiped out on his skis and the doctors said he'd never be able to walk again. Brain injuries left him unable to speak and he had to undergo extensive speech therapy and physical/occupational therapy, relearning basic skills from scratch.\n\nThe first thing Burbank, now an attorney with the District Attorney's office in Bridgeport, Conn., did was to file a disability claim for his friend. Then he went a step further and, wanting to get his friend Bill in touch with friends from his Olympic glory days, Burbank started lobbying to get Johnson involved in the Olympic ceremonies in Salt Lake.\n\nAnd he called on everybody from President George W. Bush, his father the former president, to Jacques Rogge, president of the International Olympic Committee and former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, chairman of the USOC ethics commission.\n\nBurbank had been head [and only] groundskeeper at Walker's Point during his four years at KHS so he gave it a shot. He actually did get a response to his fax from the president in the form of a letter of regret.\n\nMitchell sent Burbank a letter saying that he would see what he could do for the former Olympian and then Burbank heard that the USOC wanted to see Johnson featured during the XIX Winter Games.\n\nBurbank and his mother were flown to Salt Lake and presented with free tickets, a USOC escort, and then on the opening night of the games, Burbank and fellow 1984 gold medalist Phillip Mahre handed the Olympic torch on its way to its final destination, the Olympic flame.\n\nTold by the doctors that he might never walk again, the former Olympian started racing on skis again last weekend. His prognosis is good, Burbank said, and his vocabulary and articulation are that of a strong high school student. It takes him a little longer to understand questions and he is dealing with a loss of memory from the time of his accident and back six years.\n\nA divorced father of two, Johnson has no memory of the divorce and doesn't understand it. Doctors won't be able to assess the severity of his brain injury for another month or so. But if his biggest deficit is his memory loss, his biggest asset, Burbank said, is his sense of humor which he never lost.\n\nAlthough some would say that he could count his friend and former skiing buddy Harold Burbank among his greatest assets. Burbank is now selling Bill Johnson Olympic gold T-shirts for $20 with all proceeds going to the Bill Johnson Foundation which Burbank started with others to help Johnson with his recovery.\n\nVisa International also offers the shirts on-line through its catalogue and Visa partnered up with the U.S. Olympic Alumni Association to raise money for Johnson at a silent auction held during the Olympics in Utah.\n\nBurbank can be contacted at 84 North Mountain Road, Canton, CT 06019 or by email at hburbankii@att.net.\n\nNina Heiser can be reached at nheiser@seacoastonline.com."
