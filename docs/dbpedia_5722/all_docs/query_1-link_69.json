        "text": "Jeffrey Brian Kettle, 67, of Monroe, WI passed away peacefully surrounded by his children on Friday, August 2nd, 2024 after a courageous battle with cancer. He was born on July 23rd, 1957 in Janesville, WI to David and Charlene (Disch) Kettle. He grew up in Orfordville, WI, San Diego, CA, and Brodhead, WI, where he graduated from high school in 1975. On August 20, 1978, he married his former wife, Laurie Jean Fowler, and together they had two children, Derek and Erin.\n\nJeff worked at Pick-n-Save in Monroe, Warner Electric in South Beloit, and delivered newspapers for the Janesville Gazette before his early retirement.\n\nJeff enjoyed civil war history, often taking his children to reenactments when they were young. He enjoyed exercising and spent time hiking, biking, cross country skiing, snowshoeing, and golfing throughout the years. He enjoyed watching sports as well, and was a fan of the Green Bay Packers and Wisconsin Badgers. He was an avid sci-fi fan, often watching episodes of the X-Files and the Twilight Zone on repeat. He loved old Westerns and any show that was paranormal related. He also loved listening to talk radio, often enjoying Sunday afternoons listening to NPR. Music was a big part of his life, and some favorite bands included Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Jethro Tull, the Eagles, and Emerson Lake and Palmer. Jeff had a dark, dry sense of humor and could make anyone laugh. He passed many of these traits onto his children and grandchildren.\n\nThroughout his illness, he cited how much his family meant to him and kept him going. He was excited to see his grandchildren grow and succeed in their interests.\n\nHe is survived by his children, Derek (Andrea) Kettle, and Erin (Garrett Fisher) Kettle; grandchildren, Claire Kettle, Natalie Kettle, and Henry Fisher; brother, James Kettle; sisters Jeanne (Dennis) Socwell, Jill Riese, and Terri (Erin) Gilbertson; and many nieces, nephews, relatives, and friends.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents; the mother of his children, Laurie; brother, Jack Kettle; and sisters, Judy Heyerdahl and Janice Balch.\n\nD.L. Newcomer Funeral Home of Brodhead, WI is assisting the family with arrangements.\n\nFamily and friends are invited to a celebration of life at a later date.\n\nIn accordance with Jeff's wishes, memorials will be directed to savings funds for his grandchildren.\n\nShine on you crazy diamond."
