        "text": "Awards Radar is pleased to exclusively debut a track from the Rock Hudson: All That Heaven Allowed score. Emmy nominated for composer Laura Karpman, the documentary about the screen legend has its soundtrack being released tomorrow. So, this is a nice little preview. This is Karpman’s eighth Primetime Emmy nomination, having previously won the Emmy for the documentary series Why We Hate. She also this past year received her first Oscar nomination, becoming an Academy Award nominee in Best Original Score for American Fiction.\n\nThe track is called Dreamweaver and Karpman has the following to say about the work:\n\nBless Stephen Kijak for loving and wanting a thoughtful jazz score to tell Rock Hudson’s amazing life story in the HBO Film Rock Hudson: All That Heaven Allowed. The score for this documentary film is rich, complex and in most cases, pure jazz. Jazz is a multi-faceted musical language that brings welcomed dimension to this complex story, exploring Hollywood history, the queer closet and the onset of AIDS. I am proud and honored to have worked on this important film, and want to thank all my musicians, especially Elena Pinderhughes, who continues to be my good luck charm!\n\nFor those unaware, the documentary’s synopsis is as follows: “ROCK HUDSON: ALL THAT HEAVEN ALLOWED is an intimate portrait of actor Rock Hudson, one of Hollywood’s most celebrated leading men of the 1950’s and ‘60’s and an icon of Hollywood’s Golden Age, whose diagnosis and eventual death from AIDS in 1985 shocked the world, subsequently shifting the way the public perceived the AIDS pandemic. Born Roy Fitzgerald and renamed “Rock Hudson” by his agent, with his 6’5” frame, strong physique and chiseled good looks, Hudson was the embodiment of romantic masculinity and heterosexuality. The film explores the story of a man living a double life, one whose public persona was carefully manufactured by his handlers and orchestrated by the studio system, while fearing a potentially career-ending discovery that he was privately living as a gay man.”\n\nHere now is Laura Karpman’s track Dreamweaver from Rock Hudson: All That Heaven Allowed. Enjoy:"
