        "text": "With six awards each, the Roy clan of \"Succession\" and the found family of “The Bear” were the Emmys' biggest winners. The HBO family dramedy and FX comedy dominated the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards, including a best drama win for “Succession” and a best comedy win for “The Bear.”\n\nOr was the biggest winner really Elton John, who joined the ultra exclusive EGOT club with his win for outstanding variety special for \"Elton John: Farewell From Dodger Stadium\"? Either way, TV's biggest night came back in a big way Monday.\n\nAnother series that enjoyed Emmy gold is Netflix’s “Beef,” which earned five awards. The Lee Sung Jin-helmed miniseries, which won best limited/anthology series, earned stars Ali Wong and Steven Yeun awards for lead actress and lead actor in a limited series/TV movie.\n\n“Succession” and “The Last of Us,” HBO’s post-apocalyptic action-drama, were the top contenders this year, entering the show with 27 and 24 nominations, respectively. Neither “The Last of Us” nor fan-favorite \"Ted Lasso,\" which had 21 nods, took home any prizes during Monday's broadcast, though \"Last of Us\" nabbed two guest acting awards in last week's Creative Arts ceremonies.\n\nThis year’s Emmy Awards were postponed from Sept. 18, 2023 due to the dual writers and actors strikes. The pause marked the most significant delay of the Emmys since 2001.\n\nHere are the biggest winners of the night (in bold):\n\nBest drama series\n\n\"Andor\" (Disney+)\n\n\"Better Call Saul\" (AMC)\n\n\"House of the Dragon\" (HBO)\n\n\"The Crown\" (Apple TV+)\n\n\"The Last of Us\" (HBO)\n\n“The White Lotus” (HBO)\n\nWINNER: \"Succession\" (HBO)\n\n\"Yellowjackets\" (Showtime)\n\nBest comedy series\n\n\"Abbott Elementary\" (ABC)\n\n\"Barry\" (HBO)\n\n\"Only Murders in the Building\" (Hulu)\n\n\"Ted Lasso\" (Apple TV+)\n\nWINNER: \"The Bear” (FX)\n\n\"Jury Duty\" (Freevee)\n\n\"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" (Amazon)\n\n\"Wednesday\" (Netflix)\n\nLead actress, drama series\n\nBella Ramsey, \"The Last of Us\" (HBO)\n\nElisabeth Moss, “The Handmaid’s Tale” (Hulu)\n\nSharon Horgan, \"Bad Sisters\" (Apple TV+)\n\nMelanie Lynskey, \"Yellowjackets\" (Showtime)\n\nKeri Russell, \"The Diplomat\" (Netflix)\n\nWINNER: Sarah Snook, “Succession\" (HBO)\n\nLead actor, drama series\n\nJeff Bridges, \"The Old Man\" (FX)\n\nBob Odenkirk, \"Better Call Saul\" (AMC)\n\nBrian Cox, \"Succession\" (HBO)\n\nJeremy Strong, \"Succession\" (HBO)\n\nWINNER: Kieran Culkin, “Succession” (HBO)\n\nPedro Pascal, \"The Last of Us\" (HBO)\n\nBest limited/anthology series\n\nWINNER: \"Beef\" (Netflix)\n\n\"Daisy Jones and the Six\" (Amazon Prime)\n\n\"Fleishman is in Trouble\" (Hulu)\n\n“Dahmer − Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story” (Netflix)\n\n\"Obi-Wan Kenobi\" (Disney+)\n\nLead actress, limited series/TV movie\n\nWINNER: Ali Wong, \"Beef\" (Netflix)\n\nDominique Fishback, \"Swarm\" (Amazon Prime)\n\nJessica Chastain “George & Tammy” (Showtime)\n\nKathryn Hahn, \"Tiny Beautiful Things\" (Hulu)\n\nLizzy Caplan, \"Fleishman is in Trouble\" (FX)\n\nRiley Keough, “Daisy Jones & the Six” (Amazon Prime)\n\nLead actor, limited series/TV movie\n\nMichael Shannon, “George & Tammy” (Showtime)\n\nDaniel Radcliffe, \"Weird: The Al Yankovic Story\" (Roku Channel)\n\nEvan Peters, \"Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story\" (Netflix)\n\nKumail Nanjiani, \"Welcome to Chippendales\" (Hulu)\n\nWINNER: Steven Yeun, \"Beef\" (Netflix)\n\nTaron Egerton, “Black Bird” (Apple TV+)\n\nSupporting actor, limited or anthology series or TV movie\n\nJesse Plemons, “Love & Death” (HBO)\n\nJoseph Lee, \"Beef\" (Netflix)\n\nMurray Bartlett, \"Welcome to Chippendales\" (Hulu)\n\nWINNER: Paul Walter Hauser, “Black Bird” (Apple TV+)\n\nRay Liotta, “Black Bird” (Apple TV+)\n\nRichard Jenkins, “Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story” (Netflix)\n\nYoung Mazino, \"Beef\" (Netflix)\n\nVariety/talk series\n\n“Jimmy Kimmel Live!” (ABC)\n\n“Late Night With Seth Meyers” (NBC)\n\nWINNER: “The Daily Show With Trevor Noah” (Comedy Central)\n\n“The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” (CBS)\n\n“The Problem With Jon Stewart” (Apple TV+)\n\nCompetition program\n\nWINNER: “RuPaul's Drag Race” (VH1)\n\n“The Amazing Race” (CBS)\n\n\"Survivor\" (CBS)\n\n“The Voice” (NBC)\n\n“Top Chef” (Bravo)\n\nScripted variety series\n\n\"A Black Lady Sketch Show\" (HBO)\n\nWINNER: \"Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\" (HBO)\n\n\"Saturday Night Live\" (NBC)\n\nSupporting actress, limited/anthology series or TV movie\n\nAnnaleigh Ashford, \"Welcome to Chippendales\" (Hulu)\n\nCamila Morrone, \"Daisy Jones & The Six\" (Amazon Prime)\n\nClaire Danes, “Fleishman is in Trouble” (FX)\n\nJuliette Lewis, \"Welcome to Chippendales\" (Hulu)\n\nMaria Bello, “Beef” (Netflix)\n\nMerritt Wever, “Tiny Beautiful Things” (Hulu)\n\nWINNER: Niecy Nash-Betts, “Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story” (Netflix)\n\nSupporting actress, comedy series\n\nAlex Borstein, “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” (Amazon)\n\nWINNER: Ayo Edebiri, “The Bear” (FX)\n\nHannah Waddingham, “Ted Lasso” (Apple TV+)\n\nJanelle James, “Abbott Elementary” (ABC)\n\nJessica Williams, \"Shrinking\" (Apple TV+)\n\nJuno Temple, “Ted Lasso” (Apple TV+)\n\nSheryl Lee Ralph, “Abbott Elementary” (ABC)\n\nSupporting actor, comedy series\n\nAnthony Carrigan, “Barry” (HBO)\n\nBrett Goldstein, “Ted Lasso” (Apple TV+)\n\nWINNER: Ebon Moss-Bachrach, \"The Bear\" (FX)\n\nHenry Winkler, “Barry” (HBO)\n\nJames Marsden, \"Jury Duty\" (Freevee)\n\nPhil Dunster, “Ted Lasso” (Apple TV+)\n\nTyler James Williams, “Abbott Elementary” (ABC)\n\nSupporting actress, drama series\n\nAubrey Plaza, “The White Lotus” (HBO)\n\nElizabeth Debicki, “The Crown” (Netflix)\n\nJ.
