In addition, the Space Communicator Award was presented to ABC News Producer Gina Sunseri, and the Corona Award, which has only been awarded four times in the foundation's 37-year history, was presented to Gerald Griffin, former NASA Apollo Flight Director and former Johnson Space Center Director.\n\nRNASA Foundation Chairman Rodolfo González welcomed guests to the gala, saying, \"the RNASA Foundation recognizes achievements in space across the entire nation and across all sectors, and we are incredibly honored to have so many visitors here from around the country.\"\n\nThe Clear Brook High School JROTC Color Guard presented the colors, followed by Danny Myers, who sang the National Anthem. Reverend David Bridges, Executive Director of the Clear Creek Family Promise, provided the invocation.\n\nAfter dinner, the program kicked off with a year-in-review film by Space City Films. Kristin Fisher, CNN Space and Defense Correspondent, served as the emcee. In her opening remarks, Kristin said, \"make no mistake, the reason that I have the job that I have today is because of the hard work that all of you have done in the past 10 years to really propel the space industry to new heights... something that I find so remarkable and so inspiring in 2024.\"\n\nStellar Awards were presented to 29 individuals and 9 teams. The Stellar Award winners were announced by NASA Astronauts \"Woody\" Hoburg and Jasmin Moghbeli, who then presented them with engraved marble trophies. The Stellar Awards were presented in Early Career, Mid Career, Late Career, and Team categories.\n\nFreelancer writer Mark Carreau presented the Space Communicator Award to Gina Sunseri. He remarked, \"I consider the best reporters to be astronauts that explore the Earth, and I believe Gina is every bit of that. She's dedicated to understanding the technical and scientific subject matter as well as the personal challenges that are part of the space profession.\"\n\nSunseri said of her award, \"part of what I wanted to talk about tonight are the human stories that really catch people's attention... Pam Melroy gave me very bad news; she said chocolate tastes bad in space. I think that's fascinating, and I think our viewers really, really enjoy that kind of story.\"\n\nJohnson Space Center Director Vanessa Wyche presented the coveted Corona Award to Gerald Griffin. She reflected on Griffin's career, saying, \"Gerry's immense dedication and contribution to the space program shaped our agency's foundation and inspired generations to push the boundaries of what's possible... serving as an exemplary mentor and advocate for the future of space exploration.\"\n\nGriffin said of his award, \"when NASA was formed, it set off a bell with me that I wanted to get into that business... it immediately resonated in my mind. If there is a legacy from Apollo... it was the fact that we had done it. When we started, we didn't know we could do it, we thought we could, but we didn't know for sure. So when we started having this round of success, we finally got it in our mind we are going to do this. And if anything we've left for Artemis is that you can take this (doubt) out of the equation - it can be done.\"\n\nMike Coats, former Johnson Space Center Director, presented the prestigious National Space Trophy to Dr. Christopher Scolese. While introducing Scolese, Mike commented \"As the JSC Director, I had the good fortune to work with Chris for several years, and I have yet to see him raise his voice or show much frustration. Even when he was the Acting NASA Administrator he always kept his poise. Nowadays, a lot of people are asking 'where are the adults in the room?'... it gives me great pleasure to introduce one of those adults in the room.\"\n\nDuring his acceptance speech, Scolese remarked, \"In the past, I have been asked how I arrived at the many positions held over the years. I said that there was a book that was edited by the first recipient of the National Space Trophy - Max Faget. It was \"Manned Spacecraft: Engineering Design and Operation\"... it is a great book that explains the intricacies of design, orbital mechanics, how to deal with challenges, and more. While the technology it describes is dated, the principles are everlasting. I have worked with and continue to work with incredible people - all amazing, all willing to push the envelope, and all willing to help each other. I think what we really do is give people hope for the future. We show how technology can be used to improve the world, to expand the horizon of society, and to motivate people, especially young people, like Max Faget did, to do difficult things and strive for the stars.\"\n\nEileen Collins, astronaut and recipient of the RNASA 2006 National Space Trophy, presented an OMEGA Speedmaster watch to Scolese. Collins paid tribute to General Tom Stafford who presented the OMEGA Watch to the RNASA NST recipients for 22 years prior to his passing in 2024. Collins reflected on Stafford's legacy saying, \"General Stafford was an incredible human being - he was an explorer, he was a hero, he was a diplomat, he was a leader with integrity.\" She went on to point out facts about the Speedmaster watch, \"It holds two records - one is the distance record from Earth on Apollo 13 when it went as far as 249,000 miles from Earth, and the other is a speed record - 24,791mph on Apollo 10 which was commanded by General Stafford.\"\n\nA portrait of Scolese was on display at the gala and used as the cover of the souvenir program. The portrait will become part of the National Space Trophy display at Space Center Houston for one year.\n\nRNASA Chairman Rodolfo González concluded the evening by thanking the Foundation's corporate sponsors whose support and achievements made the event possible: Aegis Aerospace, Inc., Aerojet Rocketdyne, L3Harris, The Aerospace Corporation, All Points Logistics, ARES Corporation, ASRC Federal, Axiom Space, Barrios Technology, Bastion Technologies, Inc., Blue Origin, The Boeing Company, Booz Allen Hamilton, CACI International, Collins Aerospace, Deloitte, Draper, Jacobs, JES Tech, KBR, Leidos, Lockheed Martin, Logical Innovations, Inc., MORI Associates, Inc., MRI Technologies, Northrop Grumman, Oceaneering International, OMEGA, Paragon Space Development, Peraton, SAIC, SpaceX, TTTech North America, Inc., United Launch Alliance, V2X, and Vericon Technical Services.\n\nVisit http://www.rnasa.org/photos.html for images from the event.\n\nThe Rotary National Award for Space Achievement (RNASA) Foundation's black-tie Gala on April 26, 2024, was recorded live, in its entirety, by Space City Films and is accessible on the website's agenda page, www.rnasa.org/agenda.html.\n\nRead the press release as a PDF.\n\nPress Release\n\nRotary Gala Honors Heroes of Space\n\nRotary National Award for Space Achievement\n\nApril 5, 2024\n\nMedia Contact: Lindsey Cousins, Lindseyrc99@gmail.com\n\nThe Rotary National Award for Space Achievement (RNASA) Foundation will recognize members of the space industry at their annual space awards gala on Friday, April 26, 2024, at the Houston Hyatt Regency.\n\nThe RNASA Foundation was formed by the Space Center Rotary Club in 1985, to publicly recognize the unsung heroes of America's space program alongside the more well-known achievers.

Griffin will be the fourth recipient of the distinguished award in RNASA's 37-year history. The banquet honoring Griffin and other RNASA awards recipients will be held on April 26, 2024 at the Downtown Hyatt Regency in Houston, Texas.\n\nThe Corona Award was created to recognize the achievement of America's brightest space explorers. The award is presented only when the RNASA Foundation deems that exceptional merit and opportunity require it. The three previous honorees include Dr. Robert Gilruth in 1992, Captain John Young in 1997, and Walter Cronkite in 1999. Griffin was nominated for the award by former NASA Flight Director Eugene Kranz and Griffin Communications Group President Jeffrey Carr. In his nomination letter, Carr wrote, \"From the trenches of Gemini flight control to Apollo, Shuttle, classrooms and the halls of Congress, Gerry's legacy of service and leadership is unrivaled, and it is due time for this recognition with the Corona Award.\"\n\nGriffin joined NASA's Johnson Space Center in 1964 as a flight controller, specializing in guidance, navigation, and control systems for the Gemini and, later, the Apollo programs. In 1968, he was selected as Flight Director for Apollo 7, the first manned Apollo mission. He went on to serve on all nine manned missions to the moon, including the six lunar landings. Gerry served as Lead Flight Director for Apollo 12, 15, and 17. As Flight Director, he orchestrated a Mission Control team of flight controllers, engineers, and specialists who controlled the missions from liftoff to splashdown.\n\nGriffin said of his award, \"I am in good company with the three prior recipients of this prestigious award. All three are forever icons in the domain of human space exploration, and it is very humbling to be considered worthy of standing beside them in the aura of the Corona Award.\"\n\nAfter the Apollo program drew to a close in 1972, Gerry was summoned to NASA Headquarters, where he was appointed Assistant Administrator for Legislative Affairs. In this role, he led NASA's efforts with Congress to fund the agency's programs in aeronautics and space, especially the fledgling Space Shuttle Program. He was later named Deputy Associate Administrator for Space Operations, a role in which he was responsible for developing operations policies for the shuttle. In 1976, he transferred to the Dryden Flight Research Center in California as Deputy Director. There, he worked on a series of test flights that would provide key data for the shuttle's landing operations. He was then Deputy Director of the Kennedy Space Center from 1977 through the launch of the first Space Shuttle from Cape Canaveral on April 12, 1981. In 1982, he was named the third director of the Johnson Space Center. Gerry retired from NASA in 1986.\n\nSince 1986, he has served in a myriad of private industry roles, including CEO of the Greater Houston Chamber of Commerce, where he worked with local business leaders to create an expanded economy built on a foundation of aerospace, medicine, and biotechnology. In addition, he has served in numerous private sector leadership roles, including Managing Director of Korn/Ferry-Houston Office, Chairman of the Board of Comarco, Inc., Chairman of the Board of Golden Spike Company, and advisory board member for Aegis Aerospace.\n\nGerry continues to be a tireless advocate for the future of space exploration. He has made hundreds of speeches and appearances around the globe, promoting the past, present, and future of space. He injects clarity into a complex topic, thereby fueling enthusiasm for continued development. He is a true ambassador to the American space program.\n\nGriffin is the recipient of numerous honors, including the Space Pioneer Award, NASA's Distinguished Service Medal, NASA's Outstanding Leadership Medal, NASA's Exceptional Service Medal, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom for the Apollo XIII Mission Operations Team. He is a Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the American Astronomical Society, and the British Interplanetary Society. In addition, he is a member of Schreiner University's Board of Trustees, and is a former member of the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board appointed by Governor George W. Bush. Gerry holds a Bachelor of Sciences degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Texas A&M University and an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Houston-Clear Lake.\n\nThe RNASA Foundation invites members of the public and the aerospace community to attend the black-tie event on April 26, 2024, at the Houston Hyatt Regency, where Mr. Griffin will be presented with the Corona Award during the 36th annual RNASA Space Awards gala.

Her introduction to the space program began in 1996, when one of her earliest assignments was to cover astronaut Shannon Lucid - the only American woman to live aboard the Mir space station. Since then, Gina has produced or contributed to hundreds of articles and broadcast news segments covering Space Shuttle launches, spacewalks, commercial space flight, the International Space Station, five Mars missions, and the much anticipated Artemis II mission scheduled to launch in 2025.\n\nMark Carreau, Aviation Week & Space Technology Houston Correspondent, and 2006 Space Communicator Award recipient, nominated Sunseri saying, \"For over two decades, Gina Sunseri has set a high bar for outstanding coverage of our nation's space programs, educating millions of Americans through her thoughtful and expert productions for ABC News.â\" Veronica McGregor, Digital News and Media Manager for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and 2013 Space Communicator Award recipient, says \"Her deep understanding of the space program is evident in stories that often provide angles that other media miss. Her dedication to covering the space beat has benefitted the industry as well as ABC and millions of viewers.\"\n\nSunseri said of her award, \"Being in the same company as previous honorees is truly humbling. I have always tried to make the space program engaging for our viewers - and to share the curiosity, hard work, creativity, and passion of the people who fulfill our desire to explore. I am fascinated by the small stories-- the cat videos from space. The lost tomato. The astronaut who had spicy shrimp cocktail for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day of his mission. And of course, Suni Williams' cutting her ponytail in space for charity.\"\n\nFollowing the tragic loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia in 2003, Sunseri reported extensively on the seven astronauts lost aboard STS-107, as well as NASA's investigation of the disaster, and the safety measures that were initiated prior to the 2005 Return to Flight. She was an integral part of the ABC News team that went on to earn an Emmy Award for their investigation and report titled \"Columbia Final Mission\" which aired on \"Primetime Thursday\".\n\nWhen she's not chasing the next story or interviewing a new source, Gina enjoys travel, weather, music, and gardening. She is happily married to John Treadgold, a retired KPRC photographer, and is mom to two children.\n\nThe RNASA Space Communicator Award was created in 1997 in honor of KTRK, Houston Channel 13 space reporter and long-time RNASA Advisor Stephen Gauvain who was tragically killed in a car accident in 1996.
