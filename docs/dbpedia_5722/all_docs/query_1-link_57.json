        "text": "Reading Time: 2 minutes\n\nOne of two Democratic candidates vying for the 96th Assembly District will have the chance to flip the seat in November now that the district has been redrawn. But incumbent Rep. Loren Oldenburg, R-Viroqua, says he’s still the right candidate for the district, even though it’s now a likely Democratic seat after being a Republican stronghold for years.\n\nFormer La Crosse County Board chair Tara Johnson, D-La Crosse, and businessman Steve Campbell, D-Viroqua, are each confident they will be the one to beat Oldenburg and flip the district. Oldenburg has held office since being elected in 2018.\n\nThe 96th is a blend of both rural and urban communities, covering all of Vernon County and now the south side of the city of La Crosse. An analysis of past voting patterns suggests a 56-42 Democratic advantage. The Nov. 5 election will be a test of incumbency against new district lines, but the Aug. 13 primary will test which brand of Democrat can win over rural voters.\n\nCampbell owns an assisted living business for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities, and improving mental health systems is a focus of his campaign. He describes himself as a moderate, common-sense Democrat who knows rural voters.\n\n“Tara is not quiet about the fact that she’s a very progressive candidate, which I think works very well in La Crosse,” Campbell said. “I don’t know that that works very well in Vernon County with rural voters.”\n\nBut Johnson said the progressive versus moderate frame is not what she’s been hearing from constituents in the district. She pointed to her work on the county board with members from all sides of the political aisle.\n\n“I absolutely would defend my track record as a pragmatic leader who gets stuff done, and that means you work with everybody,” Johnson said. “I don’t have to move my personal values to the center to be an effective legislator.”\n\nBoth Democratic candidates agreed that funding for public education is a key issue for voters in the 96th. They each have concerns about private school voucher programs and the funding public schools are losing in the district.\n\nSafeguarding abortion access is another top-of-mind issue they’ve heard from Democratic voters, and Campbell admitted Johnson could have a leg up as people seem excited about voting more women into office. Johnson said women bring a unique set of eyes and ears to political office.\n\nJohnson has received a long list of endorsements, including Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski, State Sens. Brad Pfaff and Melissa Agard, and the La Crosse County sheriff.\n\nOldenburg is relying on name recognition from his 146-year-old family farm and his six-year incumbency to win. He said he’s no stranger to representing both sides of the aisle in the 96th. As a farmer, he also says he knows rural issues. After significant flooding along the Mississippi River last spring, Oldenburg sponsored a bill creating a pre-disaster flood resilience grant program that was signed into law by Gov. Tony Evers in April.\n\n“In the 96th, they want representation of people that are not extreme one way or the other,” Oldenburg said.\n\nLast year, Oldenburg and other Republicans sponsored an “Iowa-style” redistricting bill, which would have allowed the nonpartisan Legislative Reference Bureau to draw the new maps and submit them to the Republican-controlled Legislature for approval. The maps could have been rejected and redrawn until lawmakers approved the plan, which drew criticism from Democrats.\n\n“Loren Oldenburg may have been an okay fit for the old 96th, but this is not that 96th,” Johnson said. “This district has swung so dramatically.”\n\nRepublish our articles for free, online or in print, under a Creative Commons license."
