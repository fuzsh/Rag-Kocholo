        "text": "Tara Mobasher September 20th, 2020 - 3:14 PM\n\nNothing is stopping the Television Academy from honoring the best in television, especially not a pandemic or California wildfires. Jimmy Kimmel (Jimmy Kimmel Live!, The Boss Baby) will host the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards, which are slated to take place remotely from the Staples Center in Los Angeles where it will air on ABC at 5 pm PCT. The ceremony will also be available to stream on Hulu. Meanwhile, ABC’s streaming channel, ABC News Live, is airing a 90-minute pre-show, entitled Countdown to the Emmys, at 3:30 PCT. It is set to be hosted by Good Morning America Weekend co-anchors Eva Pilgrim and Whit Johnson as well as ABC News correspondent Janai Norman. While news of some Emmy winners have already been released, such as the Primetime Emmy Governors Award to Tyler Perry (Madea’s Witness Protection, Madea’s Family Reunion) and Outstanding Television Movie to Bad Education, most other winners are yet to be announced.\n\n3:50 pm: When asked about her first Emmy nomination in Netflix’s first series filmed primarily in Yiddish, Unorthodox, Shira Haas (The Zookeeper’s Wife) stated, “I’m very very excited for the ceremony to begin….It’s unbelievable. People want to see different cultures and languages and I think this show brought us another community and language…It connects us as people.” Regarding her co-stars, some of which she’s known for years, Haas excitedly reports that “We have a lot of jokes in between takes and we have such amazing chemistry… even though some materials and topics were a bit tough.” Haas also spoke on shaving her head for her role in Unorthodox, where she felt “scared and very excited,” describing it as “empowering and liberating.”\n\n4:03 pm: Addressing the newfound increase in diversity of Emmy nominees, with more minorities being represented in nominations than ever, journalist Kelly Carter discussed that racial disparities are still present: “We need to see more shows like Ramy but for other communities… We need to look at what’s been successful….These shows represent universal truths that everyone can relate to. Once people who have the power to make these shows happen understand that these shows are needed and wanted, then we move past it,” she continued, “It’s great to be invited to the show. But we really want to see people walk home with one of those shiny bobbles…We need to see more diverse winners collect the awards and walk away with big wins.”\n\n4:14 pm: On receiving her first Emmy nomination for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her role in The Good Place, D’Arcy Carden exclaimed, “It’s still shocking. I still can’t believe it,” still excited for her nomination, she said, “I think I’ll celebrate no matter what…I really do feel like the nomination was such an honor. Winning or not, I really do truly feel that I won.”\n\n4:17 pm: On the Emmy red carpet, Irish actor Paul Mescal (The Deceived) discusses his television debut with Hulu’s Normal People, a romance series that aired earlier this year for which he was nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series. He discusses his character, Connell Waldron on the red carpet: “[Connell] struggles with his identity in the world,” he said, “…He’s kind of obsessed with how people think of him and he’s constantly playing a game of chess with how he sits in society.”\n\n4:35 pm: Discussing one of the most talked about series of the year, The Mandalorian, star Pedro Pascal (Game of Thrones, Narcos) states, “It’s really great storytelling within a world that we already know and challenging that world with a bunch of originality, unexpected personality, and an edge.” He jokes that the Disney+ series is “setting the bar too high.” He states, “Not only is it challenging Star Wars, it’s challenging what can be done on TV… it’s too good and no one will ever be the same.”\n\n5:01 pm: 2020 Emmy host Kimmel kicked off the ceremony with joking about the pitfalls this year had to offer and television’s importance in our everyday lives now more than ever, “It’s been a year of division, injustice, disease, Zoom school, disaster, and death. We’ve been confined to our homes like prisoners in a dark and lonely tunnel. And what did we find in that dark and lonely tunnel? A friend. Our old pal television,” he continues to acknowledge that “The world may be terrible but TV has never been better. And tonight we are paying tribute to the great shows and the history making nominees.”\n\n5:12 pm: Jennifer Aniston (Friends) and Kimmel announced the winner for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series – after extinguishing a fire brought on by “burning off the germs” from the winner’s envelope – from nominees Christina Applegate (Dead To Me), Rachel Brosnahan (The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel), Issa Rae (Insecure), Tracee Ellis Ross (black-ish), Linda Cardellini (Dead to Me), and Catherine O’Hara (Schitt’s Creek), to be Catherine O’Hara for her role in Schitt’s Creek.

Accepting his Emmy, Levy joked “I guess it’s kind of ironical that the straightest role I’ve ever played lands me an Emmy for a comedy performance so now I seriously have to question just what I’ve been doing for 50 years.” He continued to thank his wife, production team, and co-stars, namely O’Hara, for their support. After losing the Emmy, Youssef took to Twitter to joke about the person in a hazmat suit, standing outside his home and rubbing an Emmy in his face.\n\n5:32 pm: Announcing the Emmy for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series, Tracee Ellis Ross stated the nominees: David West Read (Schitt’s Creek), Tony MacNamara (The Great), Daniel Levy (Schitt’s Creek), Michael Schur (The Good Place), Paul Simms (What We Do In The Shadows), Stefani Robinson (What We Do In The Shadows), and Sam Johnson and Chris Marcil (What We Do In The Shadows).

He gave his acceptance speech from home, explaining the significance of his series’ message: “Our story is about family, a man who’s living with his brother who’s living with mental illness. It’s a story that’s so common in the United States and the world today. It asks a big question: how are we going to deal, and honor, and take care of each other and our most vulnerable people?

In her quilt, she couldn’t imagine me actually building my own door and holding that door open for thousands of people.” He continues to thank his business and supporters, stating, “Thank you to all of the people who are celebrating and know the value of every patch, and every story, and every color that makes up this quilt that is our business, this quilt that is our lives, this quilt that is America.”\n\n7:20: Kimmel then announced the nominees for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series as Brian Cox (Succession), Jeremy Strong (Succession), Jason Bateman (Ozark), Sterling K.
