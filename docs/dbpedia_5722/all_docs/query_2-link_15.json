        "text": "Winning the 1984 Olympic men's downhill in Sarajevo made U.S.\n\nskier Bill Johnson famous. Telling everyone before the race that\n\nhe would win made him infamous. \"I don't even know why everyone\n\nelse is here,\" he said to reporters after his first training\n\nrun. \"Everyone else is here to fight for second place.\"\n\nAt that point Johnson was a 23-year-old from Van Nuys, Calif.,\n\nwho had won all of one World Cup downhill race. Sure, he was the\n\nfirst U.S. man to win one, and, yes, it was at the famous\n\nLauberhorn in Wengen, Switzerland, a few weeks before the Games.\n\nJohnson also had the best series of finishes in the five Olympic\n\ntraining runs. \"I knew the course and I knew the competition,\"\n\nhe says. \"I knew the Swiss coach who set the course, and he set\n\nit up for his skier, Peter Muller. Muller was a glider and I was\n\na glider. It was my destiny.\"\n\nStill, his peers were annoyed by his brashness and mortified\n\nwhen he made good. Austrian downhill great and 1976 gold medal\n\nwinner Franz Klammer called Johnson a \"nose picker.\" Johnson\n\nraised hackles even further when he told the press what the\n\nvictory meant to him. \"Millions,\" he said. \"We're talking\n\nmillions.\"\n\nGold might have been Johnson's destiny, but untold riches\n\nweren't. Although he won two more World Cup downhills after the\n\nOlympics and saw himself portrayed by Anthony Edwards in the\n\n1985 made-for-TV movie Going for Gold: The Bill Johnson Story,\n\nJohnson, always lackadaisical about his training, was done in by\n\ninjuries to his left knee and back. In the six seasons before he\n\nretired in '90, he had only five top-10 finishes.\n\nFive years ago Johnson founded the Jeep King of the Mountain\n\nSeries, which pitted a dozen top downhillers from the '70s, '80s\n\nand '90s, including himself, against each other. Johnson pulled\n\nout of the series in December, and lately he has considered\n\nplaying the stock market and a career in the construction\n\nbusiness. He lives in a gated community in San Diego with his\n\nwife, Gina, and their two sons, Nicholas, 5, and Tyler, 3.\n\nDespite everything that he said and everything that was said\n\nabout him, Johnson has no regrets. \"After 1984, I hung out and\n\nhad a good time on the circuit for six years,\" he says. \"I had\n\nmore fun than most people, and the guy who has the most fun\n\nwins, right?\"\n\n--Stephen Thomas\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: TONY TOMSIC [Cover of February 27, 1984 Sports Illustrated featuring Bill Johnson]\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: KIRK SCHLEA [Bill Johnson in swimming pool]"
