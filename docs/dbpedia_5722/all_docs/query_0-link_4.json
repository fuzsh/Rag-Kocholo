Kelly as a documentary rather than as an informational series, resulting in a review by the peer group of the guidelines defining the category\n\n00:55\n\nDr. John Leverence on the issue with guest actors and the rules around their eligibility for Emmy nominations and the effect of high-profile performers such as on these categories, and on the situation when Peter MacNicol was nominated in the guest actor category for Veep, but was ultimately deemed ineligible because he appeared in more than 50% of the total show, violating the Academy's rules for guest actors\n\n03:36\n\nDr. John Leverence on the issues surrounding the Emmys category of a supporting player in longform, the so-called \"Ellen Burstyn Rule\" (Ed. note: Dr. Leverence would like to note he misspoke here and meant Ellen Burstyn, not Ellen Barkin), which states that the actor appear on-screen in no less than 5% of total running time to qualify, and on how the Academy defines \"on-screen\"\n\n02:59\n\nDr. John Leverence on the importance of the rules of the Emmy Awards being transparent, on the difficulties in processing the nominations to check eligibility and how 75% of the Television Academy Awards staff's time is spent on checking eligibility in preparing the Emmy ballots, and on issues surrounding the eligibility of \"consulting producers\" and how award eligibility decisions are appealed, and on the limited number of eligible persons per category per show and an issue in 2019 with a show that had people who were both talent and producers but the producer credit was a vanity credit and did not qualify under the Academy guidelines, and on the basic principle that a person can only win one Emmy for doing one role on a show\n\n08:31\n\nDr. John Leverence on which Television Academy rules he personally lobbied to change after so many years administering the Emmys - such as giving the Engineering Awards their own awards show rather than being included in the Creative Arts Emmy Awards, and on drafting the argument for including casting as its own Emmy award category, and on how stunt coordination became an Emmy category\n\n02:46\n\nDr. John Leverence on the Televison Academy Rule of 14 - \"the lungs of the competition\" - where if in two consecutive years a category has fewer than 14 Emmy nominations, the Television Academy Board votes on whether to discontinue the category or merge it with another, such as the miniseries category\n\n01:39\n\nDr. John Leverence on the 2009 decision to expand the main Primetime Emmy award categories beyond five nominees, and the issues arising from too many awards and overlapping awards, and on an instance with apparent \"tiering\" where you had an award for lead actor in a drama series as well as overall best actor in a drama series and why that can be detrimental to the awards\n\n03:30\n\nDr. John Leverence on the issues arising from the same individual winning and Emmy in the same category every year, and on how Jean Stapleton declined to be nominated after winning lead actress in a comedy series (for All in the Family) multiple times\n\n01:46\n\nDr. John Leverence on serving as the executive producer on the Television Academy Creative Arts Awards, and on how the decisions were made around which awards would be awarded during the Primetime Emmy Awards, and which would be awarded during the Creative Arts Emmy Awards\n\n06:14\n\nDr. John Leverence on the \"wheel\" which established the Emmy Awards show as a pan-industry event by showcasing it on a different network each year on a revolving basis, and the lingering question of how this might work with different platforms in the future, and on how the networks are selected through the \"wheel\" process\n\n09:24\n\nDr. John Leverence on the platinum age of television and the impact of then-current quality of shows being produced and the importance of the Television Academy and the Emmy Awards in celebrating that excellence\n\n01:37\n\nDr. John Leverence on how and when the names of the winners get affixed to the actual Emmy statuette - since no one knows the names of the winners in advance, all the nominees' names are actually engraved on plates in advance then the non-winning plates are disposed of and the winners' names are affixed to the statuette\n\n02:01\n\nDr. John Leverence on the origin of and design of the Emmy statuette, designed by Louis McManus, and on the actual weight (about six pounds) and heft of the statuette, made out of compound metal by R.S. Owens\n\n03:39\n\nDr. John Leverence on the ballot and voting process for the Emmy Awards and how the accounting firm Ernst & Young is able to keep the names of the winners secret - the names of the Emmy winners are only first disclosed when the envelopes are opened live on the telecast\n\n03:15\n\nDr. John Leverence on Viola Davis winning an Emmy for Outstanding Actress in a Drama Series in 2015 (for How to Get Away with Murder) as the first Black actress to win in that category\n\n00:59\n\nDr. John Leverence on the single-most valuable asset of the Awards department and his role as the Administrator of the awards: to maintain the integrity of the Emmy, and on how the administration of the award does deal with certain housekeeping measures, but the real challenge is to deal with substantive issues which, if not properly handled, may result in a diminishment of the integrity of the award\n\n02:57\n\nDr. John Leverence on his advice to those who succeed him in the Emmy Awards department after his retirement: on protecting the integrity of the award as a sacred object\n\n01:48\n\nDr. John Leverence on an imposter, Barry Bremen, who accepted an Emmy that was intended for Betty Thomas (Hill Street Blues) and who had snuck into the 1985 awards by tricking Leverence into an extra ticket to the show\n\n02:39\n\nKen Levine\n\nView Interview\n\nKen Levine and David Isaacs on being nominated for an Emmy for the M*A*S*H episode, \"Point of View\"\n\n00:27\n\nKen Levine and David Isaacs on winning an Emmy for Cheers\n\n04:12\n\nBarry Levinson\n\nView Interview\n\nBarry Levinson on winning two Emmys for his work on The Carol Burnett Show\n\n00:28\n\nSteve Levitan\n\nView Interview\n\nSteve Levitan on winning multiple Emmys for Modern Family\n\n04:47\n\nJudith Light\n\nView Interview\n\nJudith Light on winning two Daytime Emmys for playing \"Karen Wolek\" on One Life to Live\n\n01:22\n\nHal Linden\n\nView Interview\n\nHal Linden on being nominated for and winning Emmys\n\n01:56\n\nWilliam Link\n\nView Interview\n\nWilliam Link on My Sweet Charlie for which he and Richard Levinson won an Emmy\n\n05:56\n\nArt Linkletter\n\nView Interview\n\nArt Linkletter on winning an Emmy in 1954 and on the tragic death of his daughter Diane Linkletter\n\n01:56\n\nDaniel Lipman\n\nView Interview\n\nRon Cowen and Daniel Lipman on winning an Emmy for their made-for-television movie An Early Frost\n\n01:07\n\nRon Cowen and Daniel Lipman on winning an Emmy for their made-for-television movie An Early Frost\n\n01:07\n\nCharles Lisanby\n\nView Interview\n\nCharles Lisanby on his multiple Emmy wins for production design\n\n01:15\n\nJohn J.
