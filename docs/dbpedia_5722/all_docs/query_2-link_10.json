        "text": "American politician (born 1954)\n\nWilliam Leslie Johnson (born November 10, 1954) is an American university administrator, businessman, and former politician who has served as president of Youngstown State University since 2024.[1] Previously, he was the U.S. representative for Ohio's 6th congressional district from 2011 until 2024. He is a member of the Republican Party.[2]\n\nBorn in Roseboro, North Carolina, Johnson entered the United States Air Force after graduating from high school in 1973. For his time in the military, he received numerous awards and distinctions, including the Meritorious Service Medal. Following his retirement in 1999 at the rank of lieutenant colonel, Johnson co-founded Johnson-Schley Management Group, an information technology consulting company, before leaving to form J2 Business Solutions, where he was a defense contractor to the U.S. military.\n\nIn the 2010 United States House of Representatives elections, Johnson defeated incumbent U.S. representative Charlie Wilson by a margin of 5%. He was reelected to the position six times. In November 2023, the Board of Trustees at Youngstown State University offered him the position of president. Johnson accepted and resigned from Congress in January 2024 to become the 10th president of the university.\n\nEarly life and business career\n\n[edit]\n\nWilliam Leslie Johnson was born on November 10, 1954, in Roseboro, North Carolina.[3] After graduating from S.D. Lee High School in Columbus, Mississippi, he entered the United States Air Force in 1973.[4] Johnson graduated summa cum laude from Troy University in 1979 and from Georgia Tech in 1984 with a master's degree.[5][6] During his tenure in the U.S. Air Force, Johnson was recognized as a Distinguished Graduate from the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps, Squadron Officers School, and Air Command & Staff College.[7] He retired as a Lieutenant Colonel after a military career of more than 26 years.[8]\n\nAfter his service in the military, he co-founded Johnson-Schley Management Group, an information technology (IT) consulting company that increased revenues by more than 200% in three years under his leadership. In 2003, he left the company to form J2 Business Solutions, where he provided executive-level IT support as a defense contractor to the U.S. military. From 2006 to 2010, he served as chief information officer of a global manufacturer of electronic components for the transportation industry.[2]\n\nU.S. House of Representatives\n\n[edit]\n\nElections\n\n[edit]\n\n2010\n\nIn May 2010, Johnson defeated two primary opponents to win the Republican nomination.[9] In the general election, he defeated incumbent Charlie Wilson, 50%–45%.[10] He began his term in the 112th United States Congress on January 3, 2011.\n\n2012\n\nIn November 2011, Wilson filed for a rematch in the newly redrawn 6th District, which had been made slightly friendlier to Republicans in redistricting.[11] Johnson defeated Wilson again in a heavily contested race, 53% to 47%, and began his second term in January 2013.[citation needed]\n\n2014\n\nIn 2014, Johnson faced Democratic nominee Jennifer Garrison, a former State Representative and lawyer from Marietta, Ohio.[12] Johnson defeated Garrison, 58% to 39%, with Green Party candidate Dennis Lambert taking 3%. He began his third term in January 2015.[citation needed]\n\n2016\n\nJohnson was reelected to a fourth term in the 2016 general election, defeating Democrat Michael Lorentz, the mayor of Belpre, Ohio, 71%–29%.[13]\n\n2018\n\nJohnson was reelected to a fifth term, defeating Democrat Shawna Roberts, of Barnesville, Ohio, 69%–30%.\n\nTenure\n\n[edit]\n\nOn January 7, 2021, Johnson objected to the certification of the 2020 U.S. presidential election results in Congress.[14]\n\nThe House passed Johnson's World War II Memorial Prayer Act, which would require the prayer President Franklin Roosevelt gave on D-Day to be placed on the World War II memorial.[15]\n\nThe House also passed Johnson's Stop the War on Coal Act, which would stop the creation of any new rules that threaten mining jobs.[15] Both pieces of legislation have been sent to the Senate for consideration. Johnson sponsored H.R. 4036, the Pass a Budget Now Act, which would cut legislators' pay if a budget is not passed by April 15 of each year.[16]\n\nResignation and move to Youngstown State University\n\n[edit]\n\nOn November 16, 2023, the Board of Trustees at Youngstown State University offered Johnson the position of president of the university, which Johnson accepted.[17] His appointment was met with protests over his record as an election denier, his support for Trump's so-called \"Muslim ban,\" and his opposition to LGBT rights, as well as the lack of transparency of the hiring process.[18] Johnson resigned from the House effective January 21, 2024, and assumed the presidency at Youngstown State the following day.[19][1]\n\nCommittee assignments\n\n[edit]\n\nCommittee on Energy and Commerce\n\nSubcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade\n\nSubcommittee on Environment and Economy\n\nSubcommittee on Oversight and Investigations\n\nCommittee on Science, Space and Technology\n\nSubcommittee on Space\n\nCaucus memberships\n\n[edit]\n\nCongressional Arts Caucus[20]\n\nCongressional Western Caucus[21]\n\nRepublican Study Committee[22]\n\nRepublican Main Street Partnership[23]\n\nRepublican Governance Group[24]\n\nProblem Solvers Caucus[25]\n\nCommunity Fire Safety Act of 2013 (H.R. 3588; 113th Congress) – Johnson introduced this bill into the House on November 21, 2013.[26] The bill would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from requiring that all new fire hydrants in the United States be lead-free beginning in 2014.[27]\n\nJohnson called the EPA's ruling \"absurd\" and said that \"it is unconscionable that the EPA has put our public safety at risk because during the hot summer months sometimes, somewhere kids may play in fire hydrant water.\"[28]\n\nPreventing Government Waste and Protecting Coal Mining Jobs in America (H.R. 2824; 113th Congress) – Johnson introduced this bill into the House on July 25, 2013.[29] If passed, the bill would have amended the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 to require state programs for regulation of surface coal mining to incorporate the necessary rule concerning excess spoil, coal mine waste, and buffers for perennial and intermittent streams published by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement on December 12, 2008.[30] Supporters of the bill argued that it would be good for jobs, save the government money, and improve U.S. energy production by preventing the Obama administration from introducing more coal regulations.[31] Opponents described it as a bill that would require \"OSM to implement the flawed 2008 Stream Buffer Zone rule and prevent the agency from improving that rule for a minimum of seven years\".[32]\n\nImproving Trauma Care Act of 2014 (H.R. 3548; 113th Congress) – Johnson introduced this bill into the House on November 20, 2013.[33] It would amend the Public Health Service Act, with respect to trauma care and research programs, to include in the definition of \"trauma\" an injury resulting from extrinsic agents other than mechanical force, including those that are thermal, electrical, chemical, or radioactive.[33]\n\nPolitical positions\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the presidency of Donald Trump, Johnson voted in line with Trump's stated position 96.8% of the time.[34] As of September 2021, Johnson had voted in line with President Joe Biden's stated position 13.9% of the time.[35]\n\nRace relations\n\n[edit]\n\nAs protesters called for the removal of statues deemed racist, Johnson authored an opinion piece for The Washington Examiner titled \"Our History Can Safeguard our Future\". In his piece, Johnson opposed the toppling of statues, writing, \"To really unify our country, we must pause and consider our history to provide context for our current national dialogue. We need to step out from behind our keyboards and learn more of the nuance of our shared heritage.\"[36]\n\nAbortion\n\n[edit]\n\nIn a candidates' questionnaire in 2010, Johnson wrote, \"I am pro-life, and I oppose abortion except in the case of rape, incest, and when the mother's life is in danger. Additionally, I support parental notification and a ban on partial birth abortions.\" During his 2010 and 2012 campaigns, Johnson was endorsed by the Ohio Right to Life PAC.[37]\n\nEnvironmental issues\n\n[edit]\n\nAt a 2016 House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing on Environmental Protection Agency regulations, Johnson called the agency \"un-American\" and accused it of \"draining the lifeblood out of our businesses\". His remarks prompted criticism from Democratic members of the committee.[38]\n\nJohnson was briefly criticized on an episode of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver for asking a Department of Energy representative about the financial return on investment regarding the Clean Future Act, which host John Oliver compared to asking about the financial return on investment of a fire department.[39]\n\nGun issues\n\n[edit]\n\nJohnson opposes further restrictions on gun ownership. The NRA Political Victory Fund endorsed him in 2012.[40]\n\nHealth care\n\n[edit]\n\nJohnson opposes the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and supports repealing it.[41][42]\n\nImmigration and refugees\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom the beginning,[43] Johnson supported President Donald Trump's 2017 executive order to impose a temporary ban on entry to the U.S. to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, characterizing it as necessary to prevent terrorist attacks.[44] After the federal courts struck down the initial executive order, Johnson supported a replacement executive order imposing a revised travel ban.[43]\n\nSame-sex marriage\n\n[edit]\n\nJohnson opposes the legalization of same-sex marriage, saying that it \"undermines the integrity of the American family\".[45]\n\nTrump administration\n\n[edit]\n\nOn December 18, 2019, Johnson held a moment of silence to remember Trump voters during House debates on articles of impeachment, saying, \"This is a sad day for America. This partisan impeachment sham seeks to disenfranchise 63 million American voters... So I want to use my time to call on this chamber, for members to rise and observe a moment of silent reflection, to give every member here the chance to pause for a moment and remember the voices of the 63 million American voters the Democrats today are wanting to silence.\"[46]\n\nIn April 2018, Johnson defended EPA head Scott Pruitt, who was embroiled in a number of investigations over ethics violations.[47] While Pruitt was being grilled, largely along party lines, during an April 2018 hearing about the ethics concerns, Johnson said, \"I think it's shameful today that this hearing has turned into a personal attack hearing and a shameful attempt to denigrate the work that's being done at the EPA and with this administration\". Public officials should have ethical standards \"beyond reproach ... but so should members of Congress\", he added.[47][48]\n\nIn December 2020, Johnson was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated Trump.[49] The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.[50][51][52]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nOn April 30, 1975, he married Wanda Florence Porter. They had three children together.[citation needed] Johnson is Protestant.[53][54]\n\nElectoral history\n\n[edit]\n\nElection results[55] Year Office Election Name Party Votes % Opponent Party Votes % Opponent Party Votes % Opponent Party Votes % 2010 U.S. House of Representatives General Bill Johnson Republican 103,170 50.19% Charlie Wilson Democratic 92,823 45.15% Richard Cadle Constitution 5,077 2.47% Martin Elsass Libertarian 4,505 2.19% 2012 U.S. House of Representatives General Bill Johnson Republican 164,536 53.25% Charlie Wilson Democratic 144,444 46.75% 2014 U.S. House of Representatives General Bill Johnson Republican 111,026 58.24% Jennifer Garrison Democratic 73,561 38.58% Dennis Lambert Green 6,065 3.18% 2016 U.S. House of Representatives General Bill Johnson Republican 213,975 70.68% Mike Lorentz Democratic 88,780 29.32% 2018 U.S. House of Representatives General Bill Johnson Republican 169,668 69.29% Shawna Roberts Democratic 75,196 30.71% 2020 U.S. House of Representatives General Bill Johnson Republican 249,130 74.41% Shawna Roberts Democratic 85,661 25.59% 2022 U.S. House of Representatives General Bill Johnson Republican 189,883 67.7% Louis Lyras Democratic 90,500 32.3%\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nCongressman Bill Johnson official U.S. House website\n\nBill Johnson campaign website\n\nBill Johnson at Curlie\n\nAppearances on C-SPAN\n\nBiography at the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\n\nLegislation sponsored at the Library of Congress\n\nProfile at Vote Smart"
