        "text": "One thing that never gets old is good music. What makes music \"good?\" When you hear it on the radio and you start singing in your car or you can remember where you were the first time you listened to a song!\n\nMusic has the power to give you joy, even if you're having a bad day. Now that's what \"good\" music can do! And that's exactly the kind of feel-good music you hear every time with the legendary Jeffrey Osborne. Nobody can sing a Love Ballad like him! Here's a flashback of the R&B singer performing his legendary 1976 classic on Soul Train.\n\nWhether Osborne was serenading the masses with his group L.T.D.(Love, Tenderness, and Devotion), making us fall Back In Love Again or ushering in a host of new classics to jam to when he went solo in 1980. He's had us soaring On The Wings Of Love music for more than five decades and still performs and sounds like the first year he stepped on stage at 76 years young. One thing is clear, music like his, crosses all age demographics and ethnic groups because everyone appreciates \"good\" music. A prime example is treasures like these,\n\nJeffrey Osborne- \"You Should Be Mine\":\n\nSouthwest Louisiana, on Saturday, August 17, 2024, you will get the unique experience of hearing Jeffrey Osborne live! Save the date, because he's coming back by popular demand to perform live at Delta Downs Racetrack, Hotel & Casino (2717 Delta Downs Dr.) in Vinton, LA. Showtime is at 7 pm and tickets are on sale now.\n\nAlmost a year to the day, he appeared live for the first time at Delta Downs in 2023 on August 19! If you missed it, you are probably aware that you missed one hell of a performance. The good news is your opportunity to see this music legend in Louisiana, has arrived once more. See you at the show!"
