        "text": "At her home in Gresham, Ore., DB Johnson reaches into her son\n\nBill's small duffel and pulls out a black pouch. It's a cheap\n\ncloth case for ski goggles, not a personal treasure. \"I don't\n\nlike to go through his stuff,\" she says, carefully loosening the\n\ndrawstring, \"but someone has to look after his affairs now. This\n\nis one of the things I found.\"\n\nShe hands over the gold medal Bill won in the 1984 Winter\n\nOlympics downhill. He was a brash, recalcitrant 23-year-old when\n\nhe shocked the world in Sarajevo by becoming the first American\n\nto win skiing's most coveted medal. \"He left it in his truck,\n\nunlocked, in that bag,\" his mother says. \"He likes it for show,\n\nbut somehow or other he doesn't cherish it. He's careless with\n\nit.\"\n\nFamily and friends know the 41-year-old Johnson has been careless\n\nwith many things since that Olympic victory. His marriage. His\n\nmoney. His reputation. His prospects. Recently divorced, broke\n\nand behind in his child-support payments, living out of an RV,\n\nJohnson was at rock bottom last summer when he decided to return\n\nto serious ski racing in hopes of making the U.S. team for the\n\n2002 Games. To some observers it seemed a quixotic attempt to\n\nrecapture lost glory, but to his many supporters it was an honest\n\nreturn to his roots. \"He was starting over with what he knew\n\nbest,\" says his ex-wife, Gina Johnson, 36, \"and he was in the\n\nbest shape I'd seen him in years, maybe ever.\"\n\n\"When I heard he wanted to make a comeback, my reaction was, he's\n\ngot the talent--anything's possible if he gets into bombproof\n\nshape,\" says his former coach, Erik Steinberg. \"But I told him\n\nthere's a reason people don't come back to downhill racing at 40.\n\nMark Spitz tries a comeback, and what's the worst that can happen\n\nto him? In our sport people can kill themselves.\"\n\nJohnson has never been good at listening to viewpoints that\n\ndiffer from his own. On March 22 he nearly did kill himself,\n\nsuffering a horrific fall in a practice run at the U.S. Alpine\n\nChampionships at Montana's Big Mountain resort. As of Monday he\n\nwas still in a coma at nearby Kalispell Regional Medical Center.\n\nJohnson crashed when he caught an edge at more than 50 mph and\n\nhurtled facefirst into the icy slope. He nearly bit through his\n\ntongue while tumbling through two safety nets. Medics at the\n\nscene kept him from suffocating in his own blood by forcing a\n\ntracheal tube down his throat, and he later underwent four hours\n\nof surgery to alleviate the pressure on his brain caused by\n\ninternal hemorrhaging. \"We were told he had a 25 percent chance\n\nof living when they first brought him in,\" says Gina, who was at\n\nher house in Sonoma, Calif., waiting for her and Bill's two boys,\n\nNicholas, 8, and Tyler, 7, to get home from baseball practice\n\nwhen she called the hospital for information on her ex-husband's\n\ncondition. \"I asked when I should bring the boys to see Bill, and\n\nthey said, 'Don't wait. Come now.'\"\n\nWhile doctors are hopeful Johnson will make what they call a\n\n\"meaningful recovery,\" they acknowledge it's difficult to predict\n\nwhat that will be. Friends and relatives are convinced that\n\nJohnson, who can open his eyes but does not respond to direction,\n\nis aware of their presence at some level when they visit him.\n\n\"He's like a newborn baby lying on his back, moving his arms and\n\nlegs around and not knowing why,\" says DB, to whom Bill hadn't\n\nspoken for more than a year before his crash in a dispute over\n\nmoney he felt she owed him. \"He doesn't have a pot to pee in,\"\n\nshe says sadly. \"The last time we spoke, he told me I was\n\nresponsible for all the bad things that had happened in his life:\n\nthe death of his first son, his divorce, his being broke. I guess\n\nhe needs a scapegoat. He's not man enough to take responsibility\n\nfor his misdeeds.\"\n\nJohnson's past includes more than a few misdeeds, among them his\n\narrest at 17 for stealing a car. Sharp-tongued and carrying a\n\nworld-class chip on his shoulder, Johnson was a loner who would\n\nfight at the drop of a hat. Twice he was removed from his youth\n\nski team in Oregon for fighting, and a few months before the '84\n\nOlympics he punched Andy Chambers, a teammate on the U.S. Ski\n\nTeam, in the jaw. \"He'd pick fights all the time during dry-land\n\ntraining when we were playing basketball or touch football,\"\n\nrecalls Steinberg, who also came to blows with Johnson a couple\n\nof times. \"It was his personality. He was always testing us,\n\nputting us in situations in which we had to come down on him like\n\na ton of bricks.\"\n\nAs recently as March 2000, Johnson got into a barroom skirmish in\n\nJackson Hole, Wyo., in which he allegedly punched a woman and bit\n\na man on the arm at the Mangy Moose saloon. After leaving the\n\nbar, according to the police report, Johnson was found walking\n\nalong a highway and was arrested for public intoxication and\n\ninterfering with an officer. He spent the night in jail. When he\n\nfailed to appear for his hearing last April, a warrant was issued\n\nfor his arrest. The warrant is still outstanding.\n\n\"Bill's always been a fighter,\" DB says. \"When he was eight, he\n\nwas expelled from his school in Boise for kicking the principal.\n\nHe got straight A's in class and straight F's on the playground.\n\nI used to tell him he needed to take a Dale Carnegie class, but\n\nhe didn't want to hear about it.\"\n\nBill's friends--and he has many--will tell you that beneath his\n\nabrasive exterior lives a sensitive man who was deeply scarred by\n\nthe separation of DB from his father, Wally, when Bill was 14.\n\n\"Like a lot of people who are strong and self-confident,\n\nunderneath maybe he wasn't that way,\" says Billy Kidd, the 1964\n\nOlympic silver medalist in the slalom.\n\n\"Bill was generous and loving,\" says Gina, who met Johnson in\n\n1986 and married him the next year. \"He had a hard childhood.\n\nWhen his family was splitting up, he was left alone a lot, and\n\nhis dad was a serious alcoholic. Bill had a hard time trusting\n\npeople.\"\n\nFinancially, that proved costly. After brazenly telling the world\n\nthat his gold medal meant \"millions, we're talking millions,\"\n\nJohnson had Wally, who'd been in the construction business, act\n\nas his manager. \"Wally saw dollar signs, and Bill wanted to take\n\ncare of him,\" DB says. \"He paid his father $3,000 a month to live\n\nin his house in Malibu and make deals for him. Lots of people\n\ncame to them with offers, but greed got in the way; they demanded\n\ntoo much, and the offers went away. By the time I got involved,\n\nit was a joke trying to get anyone to listen to me.\"\n\nDB took over as Bill's manager in 1986, but his skiing career was\n\nalready in a downward spiral. After winning three World Cup\n\ndownhills and the Olympic gold in '84, Johnson never won a medal\n\non the World Cup circuit again. He retired from the U.S. Ski Team\n\nin the spring of '90, and that fall his and Gina's first son,\n\nRyan, was born.\n\nThe plan was to move to Crested Butte, Colo., where Bill had\n\naccepted a job as a resort's ski ambassador for $35,000 a year\n\nand intended to build houses in partnership with Gina's father,\n\nDennis Ricci. However, a month before the move, tragedy struck.\n\nIn November 1991, while Gina was taking a shower, 13-month-old\n\nRyan drowned after falling into a hot tub at their house in Lake\n\nTahoe, Calif. A guest had used the tub and left the sliding door\n\nopen, and Bill didn't notice Ryan crawl outside. Ryan was kept on\n\nlife support for three weeks before Bill and Gina made the\n\ndecision to pull the plug.\n\nGiven what had happened, the move to Crested Butte was a welcome\n\nnew start. Both Nicholas and Tyler were born while the Johnsons\n\nwere living there, but Bill gradually grew disenchanted. \"He got\n\nhis contractor's license and got all excited about house\n\nbuilding,\" Gina says, \"but then he discovered, Wow, this is a lot\n\nof work. He grew restless. He wanted more.\"\n\nJohnson was competing half a dozen times a year in legends' races\n\nagainst the likes of Kidd and Stein Erickson, earning a minimum\n\nappearance fee of $7,500 per race, but he was frustrated by\n\nseveral aspects of the events, including the handicap system,\n\nwhich gave the older skiers significant time advantages. So he\n\nquit. \"We argued about that,\" Gina says. \"I wanted him to do it\n\nfor the income, but he didn't want to, and if Bill didn't want to\n\ndo something, he wouldn't do it. He didn't worry about things. I\n\nwanted a plan and stability. I wanted him to grow up. He'd say,\n\n'I don't want to grow up. It's no fun.'\"\n\nAfter his contract with the Crested Butte resort expired in 1995,\n\nJohnson, a two-handicap golfer, wanted to try to qualify for the\n\nPGA Tour. He sold the family's 3,400-square-foot trailside home,\n\nwhich he had built with his father-in-law, for $450,000 and\n\nbought a 37 1/2-foot RV. He and Gina loaded the kids and the dog,\n\nSiskiyou, an Alaskan malamute, into the RV and spent six months\n\ntraveling from golf course to golf course, mostly in California,\n\npracticing. \"Finally I put my foot down and told Bill I couldn't\n\nlive like that anymore,\" says Gina, who now supports herself as\n\nan orthodontist's assistant. \"I needed a house. He'd tell me I\n\nwasn't the girl he'd married. No. I wasn't 21 anymore, and I had\n\ntwo kids.\"\n\nThey bought a home in San Diego in July 1996, and Bill, an avid\n\ncomputer user, began day trading. Up one day, down the next: It\n\ndrove Gina crazy. \"I thought of it as gambling,\" she says. Bill\n\nwas still working on his golf game and occasionally skiing at\n\npro-am events and on the Legends circuit. \"At that point he'd\n\ngone through most of our money,\" Gina says. \"He hadn't worked in\n\ntwo years, and we had mortgage payments on the house and the RV.\n\nHe could have done television commentary. He could have coached,\n\nrun ski camps, done something with computers. But he wasn't\n\ncontent with the normal way of life. He liked to live out of a\n\nsuitcase. He didn't want that little check every week. He wanted\n\nthe big money.\"\n\nGina filed for legal separation in November 1998. \"He was in and\n\nout of the house for the next year and a half,\" she says. \"He\n\nthought I'd fall apart and want him back. I think he was in shock\n\nwhen I finally moved back home, to my uncle's farm in Sonoma.\"\n\nSoon after she left him, in December 1999, Bill went to a tattoo\n\nparty and had SKI TO DIE--which was how he inscribed his\n\nposters--tattooed above his right biceps. He drove the RV to Squaw\n\nValley, Calif., where he made money as a part-time electrician.\n\nAfter the divorce went through last August, however, he decided\n\nhe needed to go back to what he did best, what made him happiest.\n\nHe would shock the world again by qualifying for the Olympics and\n\nwinning a medal, and in so doing he would win back Gina and the\n\nboys. He told her she'd better be there when he crossed the\n\nfinish line.\n\nIf the dream was delusional, it was gilded by a purity of purpose\n\nthat wasn't lost on the skiing community. Johnson's comeback\n\nwasn't a joke. It was in many ways inspirational, especially to\n\nthe current generation of American racers, to whom Johnson is an\n\nicon. \"He was chasing a dream that he knew wasn't necessarily\n\ngoing to happen,\" says Chad Fleisher, a top U.S. downhiller. \"He\n\ndidn't seem bitter about it. He seemed happy to be there and to\n\nbe racing. That was cool.\"\n\nFor all his faults, Johnson commands a surprisingly fierce\n\nloyalty, even from those he has disappointed or hurt. That his\n\ncheckered story has touched people is apparent from the hundreds\n\nof letters and e-mails pouring into the hospital and from the\n\nstream of friends who've appeared at his bedside, telling him old\n\ntales of their high jinks, trying to spark a light of recognition\n\nin his eyes. \"I was sitting at his bedside, reading him all these\n\ne-mails, thinking, Come on, Bill, wake up,\" Gina says. \"We all\n\nlove you. Now grow up.\"\n\nA lot of people are praying he gets another chance.\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: TONY TOMSIC Last Run At 41, brash Bill Johnson thought he could regain his gold medal form from the Sarajevo Olympics (above) and win back his wife.
