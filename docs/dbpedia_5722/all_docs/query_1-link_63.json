        "text": "The Sustainable Opportunity Development Center, Inc (SOD Center) and the City of Salem LAUNCH INNOVATIVE NEW WEBSITE SERVICE DESIGNED TO SUPPORT LOCAL BUSINESS\n\nSOD Center website provides free market research and business intelligence to help small businesses\n\nSalem, OH, - The Sustainable Opportunity Development Center, Inc (SOD Center) is launching SizeUp Salem on its website today, making powerful market research and business intelligence available to local businesses to help them succeed.\n\nLocal businesses can now access industry-specific and hyperlocal information to help them grow and make smarter decisions using Big Data analysis.

With the launch of SizeUp on the SOD Center website, we are empowering our small businesses in Salem to be able to make more data-driven decisions to better operate, succeed, and grow,” said Mayor John Berlin, City of Salem.\n\nIn the USA, over 99% of all companies are small businesses and small businesses create the majority of all net new private sector jobs (Source: US Small Business Administration and US Bureau of Labor Statistics). From 1993 to 2015 small businesses created 425% more net new jobs than large companies (Source: US Bureau of Labor Statistics). In addition, locally-owned businesses create a larger economic impact on the local economy because more money spent with them is re-spent locally.

Robert Sebo, a member of the Commodores, nominated the SOD Training Center for this grant award.\n\nSince launching in November of 2018, The SOD Training Center has facilitated 75 courses and workshops supporting workforce development in the Salem region. Julie Needs, Executive Director of the SOD Center, commented that “The pandemic had a significant impact on our ability to provide training by shuttering our center for nearly 12 months. This generous award by the Ohio Commodores Foundation will support the revival of the SOD Training Centers efforts to meet the needs of local and regional employers by addressing important issues of workforce development such as, skills gap, employee retention, skills growth, company retention & growth, economic development, and a workforce pipeline for current and future industry in the region.”\n\nThis project will assist in developing and up-skilling a ready and able workforce to succeed and excel in careers with local and regional employers. Local and regional employers site workforce as a top challenge to growing their businesses. Providing dedicated specialized training that addresses the employers’ needs as well as the skills employees need to obtain and follow a career pathway is necessary for overall economic growth in the region. Needs stated “We are honored and grateful to be one of the 5 organizations selected by the Ohio Commodores Foundation to support workforce development in the State of Ohio.\n\nThe Association of Ohio Commodores awarded grants totaling $80,000 as the Association celebrated its 55th anniversary with this inaugural grant round during its 2021 Winter Meeting. Grants support training, professional development, and other community activities that create and develop a strong Ohio workforce.\n\nThe Association of Ohio Commodores Foundation Fund was established in partnership with the Foundation for Appalachian Ohio (FAO), a regional community foundation\n\nserving the 32 counties of Appalachian Ohio. FAO creates opportunities for Appalachian Ohio’s citizens and communities by inspiring and supporting philanthropy. For more information about FAO, visit www.AppalachianOhio.org.

New computer aided courses and classes are being scheduled.\n\nWhether it’s connecting businesses to necessary resources, or training Salem’s workforce for certification, The SOD Center has been invaluable to Salem’s economic development, especially during the pandemic. However, this influence can now reach even more with their brand new, state-of-the-art, computer lab. Originally built into the expansion grant from earlier this year, the new computer lab was prompted by Salem’s employers’ need for transportable technology. SOD’s executive director, Julie Needs, stated, “If a business has 10 employees to train on Office 365 by a certain deadline but only has 2 laptops, they can now schedule time with us here at the center. And those 10 employees can be certified at the same time, instead of possibly having to wait until the next quarter.” This new lab saves existing businesses time, which, in turn, saves them money. However, in addition to the obvious savings, the new computer lab now enables the SOD Center to service almost every aspect of Salem’s workforce.\n\nCollege can be intimidating on many levels, which could keep individuals from advancing their careers. This new computer lab addresses that concern by allowing SOD to reach those they may not have before. “Most of our training targeted the incumbent worker,” Needs stated. “But with the new computer lab, we can now offer our many training services to both the unemployed and underemployed.” Moreover, with this expansion, The SOD Center took a crucial step towards bridging the gap between the unemployed and the employed.\n\nThe SOD Training Center was established in 2018 as a training resource for area businesses. They are currently taking reservations for their next Microsoft Excel class, which will be held in the new computer lab on October 19, 2021, from 8:00 AM - 12:00 PM. To learn more about The SOD Center’s training and classes, you can visit https://sodcenter.com or contact Training Coordinator, Eva Slagle at 330-337-7669.\n\nThe Sustainable Opportunity Development Center, Inc. (The SOD Center) announces the expansion of The SOD Training Center.\n\nThe SOD Training Center offers a location in Salem, Ohio to help meet the training needs of area businesses. The expansion of services includes an Industrial Maintenance Readiness Program that will provide targeted entry level training in the Industrial Maintenance field. The training will include career readiness and technical training and placement with an employer. At the conclusion participants will acquire NIMS Credentials, OSHA 10- hour cards and entry level skills in Industrial Maintenance.\n\nThe SOD Center is a private not-for-profit 501c(3) economic development organization serving the City of Salem and surrounding areas. The SOD Center mission is facilitating growth to advance economic vitality and improve the quality of life for Salem residents.\n\nJulie Needs, Executive Director of The SOD Center, commented that “We are very excited for the opportunity and partnerships this expansion brings to local manufacturing with targeted skilled training for entry level positions to not only Salem, but also Columbiana county that will assist in workforce growth and development for our local businesses.”\n\nThe SOD Center will be partnering with the Mahoning Valley Manufacturers Coalition on this project. MVMC will assist with program design and coordination.\n\n“Collaboration among area workforce development agencies is often key to an efficiently run and successful program, and we believe the WorkAdvance model we bring to the partnership will help address the increasing demand for industrial maintenance workers in the region,” said Jessica Borza, MVMC executive director.\n\nMVMC was formed in September 2011 by a group of small- and medium-sized, locally-owned manufacturers in Trumbull, Mahoning and Columbiana Counties in Ohio solely for the purpose of “creating educational pathways to meet the needs of member companies for a skilled workforce.” The group is a grassroots effort led by industry with representation from public institutions of higher education, career and technical centers, county boards of education and public workforce systems.\n\nWith this expansion The SOD Training Center will also be adding a computer lab for computer-based learning courses or for use by those who may not have access to technology. The computer lab will aid the SOD Center in reaching and assisting under-represented populations as well as employers who may not have transportable technology for employees to attend computer courses.\n\nThe SOD Training Center will continue to offer courses and workshops to facilitate workforce development. With a focus on safety training, leadership development, workplace improvement, skills advancement and soft skills, Training Coordinator, Eva Slagle stated, “The SOD Training Center willcontinue to function as a facilitator, bringing professional trainers to our local community to offer cooperative training opportunities.”\n\nEmployers and participants interested in the Industrial Maintenance Readiness Program or the Computer Lab, please call the SOD Center at 330-337-7669.\n\nThe SOD Center looks forward to collaborating with MVMC, local businesses, workforce, and educators to expand workforce development for Salem and surrounding areas.\n\nThe SOD Training Center is located at 440 Pennsylvania Ave, Salem, OH within The SOD Center offices."
