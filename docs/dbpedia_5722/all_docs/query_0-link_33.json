        "text": "September 20, 2020\n\nby Carla Hay\n\nWith 11 prizes, HBO’s sci-fi/drama limited series “Watchmen” was the top winner at the 72nd annual Emmy Awards, which were presented September 20, 2020, in a virtual ceremony hosted by Jimmy Kimmel. ABC had the U.S. telecast. The winners accepted their prizes via video satellite links. Going into the ceremony, “Watchmen” was the leading contender, with 26 nominations. Among the Emmy Awards won by “Watchmen” were for Outstanding Limited Series; Best Actress in a Limited Series or Movie (for Regina King); Best Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie (for Yahya Abdul-Mateen II); and Best Writing for a Limited Series, Movie or Dramatic Special.\n\nPop TV’s “Schitt’s Creek” (whose series finale aired in April 2020) was also a big winner, by sweeping all seven of the major categories in the comedy categories: Outstanding Comedy Series; Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series (for Eugene Levy); Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series (for Catherine O’Hara); Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series (for Dan Levy); Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series (for Annie Murphy); Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series; and Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series. “Schitt’s Creek” was the first TV series to win all seven of these Emmy categories in the same year. “Schitt’s Creek” went into the ceremony with 15 nominations and ended up winning nine Emmys. The other two Emmys won by the show were for Outstanding Contemporary Costumes and Outstanding Casting for a Comedy Series.\n\nHBO’s “Succession” was another big winner at the ceremony, including victories in these categories: Outstanding Drama Series; Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series (for Jeremy Strong); Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series; and Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series. The total Emmy haul for “Succession” in 2020 was seven.\n\nZendaya won the prize for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, for HBO’s “Euphoria.” At 24 years old, she made Emmy history for being the youngest person to win in this Emmy category. Other actor winners included Mark Ruffalo (who played identical twins) for HBO’s “I Know This Much Is True” (Outstanding Lead Actor in Limited Series or Movie); Billy Crudup for Apple TV+’s “The Morning Show” (Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series); Julia Garner for Netflix’s “Ozark” (Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series); and Uzo Aduba for FX’s “Mrs. America” (Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie).\n\nPresenters included Jennifer Aniston, Tracee Ellis Ross, Zendaya, Jason Sudeikis, Randall Park, Anthony Anderson, Cynthia Erivo, Oprah Winfrey, Laverne Cox, Yara Shahidi and Sterling K. Brown. And in honor of everyday people during the pandemic, there were also several “non-famous” people as presenters, such as a school teacher, an astronaut, a mail deliverer, a farmer/shepherd, a truck driver, two doctors and a nurse. In a comedic segment, there was a mini-reunion of “Friends,” as Aniston, Courteney Cox and Lisa Kudrow did a sketch where they all pretended to be longtime roommates.\n\nAs previously announced, Tyler Perry and The Perry Foundation received the noncompetitive Governors Award for career achievement. H.E.R. performed “Nothing Compares 2 U” for the “In Memoriam” segment honoring prominent people who worked in television who passed away since the 2019 Primetime Emmy Awards.\n\nMany of the speeches and presentations (including acceptance speeches by Perry and “Schitt’s Creek” co-star Dan Levy) mentioned a need for more diversity and inclusion in television. There were special segments devoted to actresses/producers Issa Rae, America Ferrera and Lena Waithe sharing personal experiences about how they dealt with racism in the industry. Some of the ceremony’s winners (such as King, Ruffalo, Dan Levy and Garner) also urged people to vote in this U.S. election year.\n\nThe independent accounting firm of Ernst & Young LLP tallied the votes for the Primetime Emmy Awards, which are voted on by branches of the Television Academy of Arts and Sciences, with some special jury awards. The executive producers of 2020 Primetime Emmy Awards telecast were Kimmel, Guy Carrington, Reginald Hudlin, David Jammy and Ian Stewart. The show raised $2.8 million for the food charity No Kid Hungry, according to an announcement that Kimmel made at the end of the show.\n\nThe 2020 Creative Arts Emmy Awards were handed out in a five-part ceremony (hosted by Nicole Byer) on September 14, 15, 16, and 17 on Emmys.com and on September 19 on FXX.
