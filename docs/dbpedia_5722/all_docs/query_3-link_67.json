        "text": "Check back throughout the day to see more reactions from this year’s nominees!\n\n“Playing Tim Laughlin was the experience of a lifetime, and I will carry him with me always. For this experience to be recognized in this way, and alongside Matt, my ultimate co-pilot, is truly a dream and an honor (alt: beyond my wildest dreams).\n\nIt is not lost on me that this sort of recognition is rare. I’ve grown up savouring the minimal queer television and film on offer whilst battling problematic media and societal criticism of queer life. I have loved so many celebrated dramatic performances of gay characters but for Matt and I to be nominated together as gay actors feels like the sort of progress that would have made the world an easier place to grow up in. For that I am grateful and so unbelievably proud. Thank you to the TV Academy for this opportunity.\n\nI share this with Ron, Matt, Noah, Jelani, Allison, the entire Fellow Travelers family. And of course, with Tim and all the other angels who fought before us.”\n\n–Jonathan Bailey, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie nominee for Fellow Travelers“It was such a nice surprise when I heard this morning. I didn’t know today was the day of the nominations. I was making coffee when Simon came in to tell me. I am incredibly grateful and thrilled that Jonny and Ron’s beautiful work was recognized as well. The fact that two out actors in a love story were recognized in this way is profoundly moving to me.”\n\n–Matt Bomer, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie nominee for Fellow Travelers\n\n“I am so touched by this nomination. I wholeheartedly share the honor with the stellar cast of Under the Bridge, who brought such deep compassion and unmatched talent to telling Reena Virk’s story. Every beating heart on screen gave so much of themselves to honor her legacy, and I’d especially like to thank Vritika, Archie and Riley, I am so inspired by you all. Thank you to Quinn Shephard, Samir Mehta, Liz Tigelaar, Gina Gammell and Riley Keough for bringing this story to light and being champions of radical empathy. I’m forever grateful to have been brought along for the journey.”\n\n–Lily Gladstone, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie nominee for Under the Bridge\n\n“I am at a complete loss for words. This morning is such an emotional rollercoaster filled with tears of joy over this recognition of my work, and for my humanity as a trans Latina woman. Today is an affirmation of my existence and my journey as a working actor. It is a dream come true and I am so humbled and deeply grateful for this nomination. Most importantly, I am thankful to my peers for not only bestowing me with this nomination, but celebrating this groundbreaking moment for the Trans community at large.\n\nI extend my endless gratitude and congratulations to Richard Gadd, Jessica Gunning, and my entire Baby Reindeer family. This has been the ride of a lifetime, and I am so deeply moved to be sharing this with all of you.\n\nMil gracias y mucho amor a mi familia en México y San Antonio!”\n\n–Nava Mau, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie nominee for Baby Reindeer\n\n“I’m thrilled to be nominated for Baby Reindeer. Everyone involved in the series was performing to the highest level and I’m delighted that the whole show and my part in it has been recognised.”\n\n—Tom Goodman-Hill, Outstanding Supporting Actor In A Limited Or Anthology Series Or Movie nominee for Baby Reindeer\n\n“Amazing news like a breath of cool air as I’m slogging through this blazing NYC heat to do my matinee of “N/A” — about a 17 block hustle. Lucky, lucky me!”\n\n–Holland Taylor, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series nominee for The Morning Show\n\n“It warms my heart to see that misanthropy is finally being recognized as an art form.”\n\n–Larry David, Outstanding Comedy Series nominee for Curb Your Enthusiasm\n\n“This is a sad day for actors everywhere. See? Anyone can do it!”\n\n–Larry David, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series nominee for Curb Your Enthusiasm\n\n“I couldn’t be happier and I am so incredibly proud of us! #EmmyNoms”\n\n–Jean Smart, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series nominee for Hacks\n\n“Wow. Griselda was my first dramatic role ever, and it took us 15 years to bring her to life. I’m incredibly grateful to everyone who was a part of this series. I could have never done this without my director Andres Baiz, my costar Alberto Guerra, Eric Newman and the full creative team, my partner and producer Luis Balaguer, Ted Sarandos, Bela Bajaria, and their team at Netflix, and all the amazing cast and crew. I never dreamed that after “Modern Family” I would be able to work on something as special as “Griselda.” I’m honored to be recognized alongside Jodie, Brie, Juno, and Naomi, incredible women who gave us incredible TV this year. Thank you to the Television Academy for this incredible honor!”\n\n–Sofia Vergara, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie nominee for Griselda\n\n“I am very proud of the hard work and integrity of everyone involved in the making of The Crown. I particularly enjoyed revealing the many positive aspects of Prince Phillip’s character that were previously unknown to a global audience. It was a privilege to play him and it is a privilege to be nominated by my peers. Thank you.”\n\n–Jonathan Pryce, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series nominee for The Crown\n\n“Making Hacks with my loved ones is the most fulfilling creative experience of my life. I am deeply honored to share this nomination with every single cast and crew member who makes our show what it is! I am so humbled to be nominated alongside such powerful artists who I admire- I’m overflowing with gratitude and love!”\n\n–Hannah Einbinder, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series nominee for Hacks\n\n“I am trying to find the words, but this thank you just feels so big. Thank you to the Television Academy for recognizing the talent, drive and passion of our Lessons in Chemistry team. To see so many departments lifted up is the greatest feeling. I am honored to say that I witnessed the most amazing people do the most amazing things. I am humbled by the world Bonnie Garmus and Elizabeth Zott has opened my heart to. And I am thrilled beyond belief that we get this chance to toast and eat together one last time. I’m the happiest woman in the universe.”\n\n–Brie Larson, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie nominee for Lessons in Chemistry\n\n“I am so deeply honored to be nominated for an Emmy. It is difficult to put language to the abundance of emotion I feel right now but foremost in my mind is my deep gratitude. Gratitude to the Television Academy, the incredible Lessons in Chemistry cast and crew that I had the privilege to work alongside, and to every person who ever told me to keep going. Thank you.”\n\n–Aja Naomi King, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie nominee for Lessons in Chemistry\n\n“Thank you to the Television Academy for finally recognizing all my hard work on New Girl! Although I believe it’s a lock, I do see I’m nominated alongside Robert Downey Jr. who stole my role in Tropic Thunder. My fellow nominees and I won’t let this slide.\n\nThis is a great honor, and I couldn’t be more excited! Truly blessed to work with such a talented cast and crew! Special thank you Noah for the opportunity and trusting me to bring Witt Farr to life! Go Fargo!”\n\n–Lamorne Morris, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie nominee for Fargo\n\n“I am deeply honored to be nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for my role as Kashigi Yabushige in “Shōgun.” I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to FX, creators Justin Marks and Rachel Kondo, Hiroyuki Sanada, and the entire team for their unwavering support and vision. I am incredibly appreciative of the hard work and dedication of everyone involved in bringing this project to life. This recognition is a testament to our collective effort, and I am truly grateful.”\n\n–Tadanobu Asano, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series nominee for Shōgun\n\n“We are so honored. We share this with Jen, Courtenay, Julie, Sue, Brianna and all the wonderful people at Amazon who have been so supportive. Casey McQuiston wrote a joyful, wonderful book that captured the imagination of readers everywhere. We were honored to be trusted to turn it into a film and are so grateful to Matthew Lopez and our cast and crew, especially Nick Galitzine and Taylor Zakhar Perez, for this wonderful ride. Bringing hope and love into the world always feels worthwhile and we are most grateful to the fans for loving this film.”\n\n–Greg Berlanti & Sarah Schechter, producers of Outstanding Television Movie nominee, Red, White & Royal Blue\n\n“So thrilled to join the fabulous Morning Show team celebrating the 2024 Emmy nominations! The only thing more fun than playing a badass reporter bent on exposing the truth – is to play it with Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon and particularly proud of all amazing woman involved and powering this show! Bravo Mimi, Bravo Apple. Bravo all.”\n\n–Marcia Gay Harden, Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series nominee for The Morning Show\n\n“I’m so humbled and grateful to be included in this room of storytellers, in this category with these remarkable actors, in this stellar year of television.
