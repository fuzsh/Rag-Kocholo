        "text": "The biggest night in television is nearly upon us as the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards swiftly approach. The star-studded awards show, initially scheduled to take place in Los Angeles on Sept. 18, was postponed amid the dual writers and actors strikes.\n\nThis marks the most significant delay of the Emmys since 2001, when the show was put on hold for seven weeks following the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the related U.S. invasion of Afghanistan. (The Emmys carried on during the 2020 pandemic with a virtual show.)\n\nHere's what to know about the Emmys, which honor excellence in the TV industry, and the rest of the 2024 awards season.\n\nWhen are the Emmys?\n\nThe 75th Primetime Emmy Awards will be held Jan. 15 at 8 p.m. EST/5 PST.\n\nThe show will broadcast live from the Peacock Theater in downtown LA.\n\nWho's hosting the Emmys?\n\nActor and comedian Anthony Anderson will host the 75th Emmy Awards.\n\n\"With our industry's recent challenges behind us, we can get back to what we love − dressing up and honoring ourselves. And there's no better celebratory moment to bring the creative community together than the milestone 75th Emmy Awards,\" Anderson said in a statement.\n\nWhere to watch the Emmys?\n\nThe Emmy Awards will air on Fox. The show will be available to stream a day later on Hulu (Jan. 16).\n\nWhy are the Emmys so late this year?\n\nThe Primetime Emmy Awards are generally held every September.\n\nThe 75th Emmy Awards were scheduled to take place on Sept. 18, while the Creative Arts ceremonies were planned for Sept. 9 and 10.\n\nIn July 2023, USA TODAY confirmed that the awards show would be postponed to January because the writers and actors strikes largely put Hollywood on pause.\n\nIn August, it was officially announced the 2023 Emmy Awards would be pushed to early January. The Primetime Emmys would air on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, while the Creative Arts Emmy Awards would be held Jan. 6 and 7 (airing Jan. 13 at 8 p.m. EST on FXX).\n\nThese new dates align with Emmy history as the first awards ceremony took place on Jan. 25, 1949. They continued to be held in January or February throughout the early 1950s.\n\nTop Emmy Awards category nominees\n\nOutstanding drama series\n\n\"Andor\" (Disney+)\n\n\"Better Call Saul\" (AMC)\n\n\"House of the Dragon\" (HBO)\n\n\"The Crown\" (Apple TV+)\n\n\"The Last of Us\" (HBO)\n\n“The White Lotus” (HBO)\n\n\"Succession\" (HBO)\n\n\"Yellowjackets\" (Showtime)\n\nOutstanding comedy series\n\n\"Abbott Elementary\" (ABC)\n\n\"Barry\" (HBO)\n\n\"Only Murders in the Building\" (Hulu)\n\n\"Ted Lasso\" (Apple TV+)\n\n\"The Bear” (FX)\n\n\"Jury Duty\" (Freevee)\n\n\"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" (Amazon)\n\n\"Wednesday\" (Netflix)\n\nOutstanding limited/anthology series\n\n\"Beef\" (Netflix)\n\n\"Daisy Jones and the Six\" (Amazon Prime)\n\n\"Fleishman is in Trouble\" (Hulu)\n\n“Dahmer − Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story” (Netflix)\n\n\"Obi-Wan Kenobi\" (Disney+)\n\nOutstanding lead actress, drama series\n\nBella Ramsey, \"The Last of Us\" (HBO)\n\nElisabeth Moss, “The Handmaid’s Tale” (Hulu)\n\nSharon Horgan, \"Bad Sisters\" (Apple TV+)\n\nMelanie Lynskey, \"Yellowjackets\" (Showtime)\n\nKeri Russell, \"The Diplomat\" (Netflix)\n\nSarah Snook, “Succession\" (HBO)\n\nOutstanding lead actress, comedy series\n\nChristina Applegate, \"Dead to Me\" (Netflix)\n\nJenna Ortega, \"Wednesday\" (Netflix)\n\nNatasha Lyonne, \"Poker Face\" (Peacock)\n\nQuinta Brunson, \"Abbott Elementary\" (ABC)\n\nRachel Brosnahan, \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" (Amazon)\n\nOutstanding lead actor, drama series\n\nJeff Bridges, \"The Old Man\" (FX)\n\nBob Odenkirk, \"Better Call Saul\" (AMC)\n\nBrian Cox, \"Succession\" (HBO)\n\nJeremy Strong, \"Succession\" (HBO)\n\nKieran Culkin, “Succession” (HBO)\n\nPedro Pascal, \"The Last of Us\" (HBO)\n\nOutstanding lead actor, comedy series\n\nBill Hader, \"Barry\" (HBO)\n\nJason Sudeikis, \"Ted Lasso\" (Apple TV+)\n\nJeremy Allen White, \"The Bear\" (FX)\n\nMartin Short, \"Only Murders in the Building\" (Hulu)\n\nJason Segel, \"Shrinking\" (Apple TV+)\n\nSee the entire Emmy nomination list: Television Academy rewards 'The White Lotus,' 'Succession,' more\n\nWho has the most Emmy nominations?\n\n\"Succession\" leads this year's Emmy nominations with 27, including outstanding drama series and three nominations for lead actor in a drama series.\n\n\"The Last of Us\" earned 24 nominations, including lead actor and lead actress in a drama series for Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey, respectively.\n\n\"White Lotus\" trailed with 23 nominations, including five in supporting actress in a drama series.\n\n'White Lotus' Season 3 cast revealed: Parker Posey, Jason Isaacs and more\n\nWho's favored to win at the Emmys?\n\nThese shows and actors are most heavily favored, according to experts at awards site Gold Derby:\n\n\"Succession\" for outstanding drama series\n\n\"Ted Lasso\" and \"The Bear\" for outstanding comedy series\n\n\"Beef\" for outstanding limited/anthology series\n\nSarah Snook (\"Succession\") for outstanding lead actress in a drama series\n\nKieran Culkin (\"Succession\") for outstanding lead actor in a drama series\n\nQuinta Brunson (\"Abbott Elementary\") for outstanding lead actress in a comedy series\n\nJeremy Allen White (\"The Bear\") for outstanding lead actor in a comedy series\n\n75th Emmy Awards winners predictions: Our picks for who will (and should) win.\n\nAwards season 2024 schedule\n\nHere are other key dates for this year's awards season:"
