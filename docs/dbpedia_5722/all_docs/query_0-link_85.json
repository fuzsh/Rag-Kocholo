        "text": "BEST PICTURE\n\nLast year, the Best Picture race returned to having 10 nominees after a decade in which there were a variable number of slots determined by a relatively complex algorithm. This year’s Best Picture contenders can be batched into 5 groups. First, there are the absolute locks. Based on their performance in the awards season thus far, it would be an industry-rocking shock if any of the following 4 missed — Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert’s absurdist, genre-defying comedy-drama Everything Everywhere All At Once, Martin McDonagh’s Ireland-set black comedy The Banshees of Inisherin, Todd Field’s complex character study Tár, and Baz Luhrmann’s crowd-pleasing musical biopic Elvis. The second batch contains films that are considered “sure bets” but are in a slightly weaker position than the aforementioned 4. This group includes Steven Spielberg’s semi-autobiographical coming-of-age drama The Fabelmans, Joseph Kosinski’s box office-shattering action sequel Top Gun: Maverick, and James Cameron’s equally box office-shattering science fiction sequel Avatar: The Way of Water. I demoted all three from “lock” status after recent poor showings at the BAFTAs, but nevertheless expect them to get in here. The third category includes a pair of films that recently received a surge of support — Edward Berger’s World War I epic All Quiet on the Western Front and Darren Aronofsky’s intimate character study The Whale. The former’s astonishing showing at the BAFTAs and the latter’s inclusion in the PGA’s nominations along with its strong box office indicate a swell of support. The fourth category includes the films gunning for the 10th spot. The top contenders include Damien Chazelle’s divisive Old Hollywood epic Babylon, Sarah Polley’s searing drama Women Talking, Gina Prince-Bythewood’s historical action film The Woman King, S. S. Rajamouli’s Indian action epic RRR, Ruben Östlund’s dark comedy Triangle of Sadness, Rian Johnson’s murder mystery sequel Glass Onion, and Ryan Coogler’s Marvel sequel Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. I give the edge to Babylon because of its well-liked cast and crew, its likelihood to be nominated in numerous technical categories, and its Academy-friendly subject matter. The fifth category includes a slew of films that have a non-zero chance of making it in, but whose inclusion would be a major shock.\n\nEverything Everywhere All At Once\n\nThe Banshees of Inisherin\n\nTár\n\nElvis\n\nThe Fabelmans\n\nTop Gun: Maverick\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front\n\nThe Whale\n\nBabylon\n\nTriangle of Sadness\n\nWomen Talking\n\nThe Woman King\n\nRRR\n\nGlass Onion\n\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever\n\nAftersun\n\nDecision to Leave\n\nGuillermo Del Toro’s Pinocchio\n\nNope\n\nBEST DIRECTOR\n\nBased on the way awards season has played out so far, it seems clear that three slots will be taken by the directors of Everything Everywhere All At Once (Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert), The Banshees of Inisherin (Martin McDonagh), and Tár (Todd Field). It also seems likely that Baz Lurhmann will get his first-ever Best Director nomination for Elvis given the overall love for the film. (He was shockingly omitted in 2001 for his Best Picture-nominated classic Moulin Rouge.) A week ago, Steven Spielberg destined to be in the final 5, but the shocking under-performance of The Fabelmans at the BAFTAs made several folks wonder if he could be snubbed. I think he gets in and we will have a fairly predictable final five, but it’s worth noting that a disproportionate share of Oscar nomination shockers come in this category (e.g., the omission of presumed front-runners Ben Affleck and Kathryn Bigelow for 2012’s Argo and Zero Dark Thirty, respectively and the omission of Denis Villeneuve for Dune last year). So who could be the surprise 5th nominee? Well just about anybody, but the most likely candidate is James Cameron, who seems like a lock for Avatar: The Way of Water until you realize he missed key nominations at the DGA and BAFTA Awards and that there is a key precedent for his omission (i.e. Peter Jackson missing out on a nomination for the second Lord of the Rings film despite it showing up in Best Picture). Other strong contenders for the 5th slot include Joseph Kosinski (Top Gun: Maverick), Edward Berger (All Quiet on the Western Front), Sarah Polley, (Women Talking), Gina Prince-Bythewood (The Woman King), Park Chan-wook (Decision to Leave), Ruben Östlund (Triangle of Sadness), and S. S. Rajamouli (RRR). Unfortuantely, it seems likely that it will be an all-male lineup.\n\nDaniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, Everything Everywhere All At Once\n\nMartin McDonagh, The Banshees of Inisherin\n\nTodd Field, Tár\n\nBaz Lurhmann, Elvis\n\nSteven Spielberg, The Fabelmans\n\nJames Cameron, Avatar: The Way of Water\n\nJoseph Kosinski, Top Gun: Maverick\n\nEdward Berger, All Quiet on the Western Front\n\nSarah Polley, Women Talking\n\nGina Prince-Bythewood The Woman King\n\nS. S. Rajamouli, RRR\n\nPark Chan-wook, Decision to Leave\n\nRuben Östlund, Triangle of Sadness\n\nDarren Aronofsky, The Whale\n\nDamien Chazelle, Babylon\n\nBEST ACTRESS\n\nFew would disagree with the contention that this race is between never-nominated, Malaysian-born film legend Michelle Yeoh for Everything Everywhere All At Once and 7-time Oscar nominated Australian-born film legend Cate Blanchett for Tár. Neither has missed a nomination anywhere and both have won high-profile televised awards. The rest of the category is notably harder to predict. The only other actress who has been nominated at the “Big Four” awards (the Globes, Critics’ Choice, SAG, and BAFTAs) is 4-time nominee Viola Davis for The Woman King. Some are predicting that she will be omitted citing the apparent lack of enthusiasm for her film and the fact that nearly every year someone who was nominated in the “Big Four” gets head-scratchingly snubbed. But I think she makes it in for her history-making 5th nomination. (No other black actress has ever received more than 3 nominations.) Likely to join her is Danielle Deadwyler, whose searing turn as the grieving mother of a slain teen in Till had critics raving. So who gets the 5th spot? Conventional wisdom says Ana de Armas for her turn as Hollywood icon Marilyn Monroe in Blonde given her nominations at the Globes, SAG, and BAFTA, not to mention the Academy’s love of a biopic. Perhaps it is wishful thinking, but I suspect that the film’s immense controversy regarding its graphic, exploitative, and reckless storytelling will prevent her from getting in. Then there’s the curious case of Michelle Williams. The 4-time nominee seemed like a lock to win Best Supporting Actress for The Fabelmans early on in the season before the film’s backers curiously announced that they would push her in Best Actress. She was nominated at the Globes and Critics’ Choice, but then was snubbed by SAG and BAFTA. She could get omitted at the Oscars, she could show up here, or she could show up in Best Supporting Actress despite how the studio is pushing her. (Previous examples of surprise category switches by Oscar voters include Kate Winslet for The Reader, Keisha Castle-Hughes for Whale Rider, and LaKeith Stanfield for Judas and the Black Messiah). It seems almost assured that the final 5 will be comprised of some combination of these 6 women, but there are other contenders with a shot. These include Andrea Riseborough, who has received a groundswell of support from some very high-profile Academy members in recent weeks for her turn in the little-seen indie To Leslie.\n\nCate Blanchett, Tár\n\nMichelle Yeoh, Everything Everywhere All At Once\n\nDanielle Deadwyler, Till\n\nViola Davis, The Woman King\n\nMichelle Williams, The Fabelmans\n\nAna de Armas, Blonde\n\nAndrea Riseborough, To Leslie\n\nMargot Robbie, Babylon\n\nEmma Thompson, Good Luck To You, Leo Grande\n\nOlivia Colman, Empire of Light\n\nBEST ACTOR\n\nAs has often been the case in recent years, the Best Actor race is significantly more boring and less competitive than its female counterpart. We seem to have a trio of “locks” in the form of Brendan Fraser for his turn as a morbidly obese man attempting to reconnect with his daughter in the character study The Whale, Austin Butler’s turn as music icon Elvis Presley in Elvis, and Colin Farrell’s turn as a simple Irish farmer in The Banshees of Inisherin. The 4th spot seems likely to go to Bill Nighy for his turn as a man facing a fatal illness in Living. The 5th spot could go to, well, just about anyone it seems. For a while, many thought Tom Cruise would get his long-awaited 4th Oscar nomination for Top Gun: Maverick, but he has only shown up at the Critics’ Choice Awards so far, indicating a lack of support for an acting nomination for the mega-star. Other strong contenders include indie darlings Paul Mescal for Aftersun and Jeremy Pope for The Inspection. And with that last spot so wide open, we can’t count out SAG nominee Adam Sandler for The Hustle, BAFTA nominee Darryl McCormack for Good Luck To You, Leo Grande, and Golden Globe nominees Diego Calva for Babylon, Daniel Craig for Glass Onion, Raph Fiennes for The Menu, Hugh Jackman for The Son, and Adam Driver for White Noise. And then there’s Gabriel Labelle for The Fabelmans, Tom Hanks for surprise box office hit A Man Called Otto, and Felix Kammerer for All Quiet on the Western Front.\n\nAustin Butler, Elvis\n\nBrendan Fraser, The Whale\n\nColin Farrell, The Banshees of Inisherin\n\nBill Nighy, Living\n\nPaul Mescal, Aftersun\n\nTom Cruise, Top Gun: Maverick\n\nJeremy Pope, The Inspection\n\nRaph Fiennes, The Menu\n\nGabrielle Labelle, The Fabelmans\n\nFelix Kammerer, All Quiet on the Western Front\n\nTom Hanks, A Man Called Otto\n\nDiego Calva, Babylon\n\nDaniel Craig, Glass Onion\n\nHugh Jackman, The Son\n\nAdam Driver, White Noise\n\nDarryl McCormack, Good Luck To You, Leo Grande\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS\n\nThis is a category that is traditionally ripe for surprises (e.g., last year when presumed front-runner Caitríona Balfe was snubbed in favor of her presumed long-shot co-star Judi Dench for Belfast). Given how wildly stacked this category is with worthy nominees, it is very likely we will see a surprise here. So far, a trio of actresses has been nominated at the “Big Four” and thus seem likely to be nominated here. They are previous nominee Angela Bassett for her turn as a grieving queen in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Kerry Condon for her turn as Colin Farrell’s compassionate and level-headed sister in The Banshees of Inisherin, and Jamie Lee Curtis for her turn as a cold-hearted IRS auditor in Everything Everywhere All At Once. I would say that the first 2 are locked in but the 3rd is vulnerable given the fact that she has to contend against her co-star Stephanie Hsu, who gave a much more substantive and critically acclaimed performance. Of course, they could both get in — which is what I’m predicting. Equally likely as Hsu are Dolly De Leon for Triangle of Sadness and Hong Chau for The Whale. Hot on their heels are Janelle Monae for Glass Onion, Carey Mulligan for She Said, and Nina Hoss for Tár. Then there’s possibility that Michelle Williams is moved to supporting by a large swath of voters for The Fabelmans (which feels increasingly likely) or one of the spectacular members of the Women Talking ensemble (e.g., Jessie Buckley, Claire Foy) makes it in.\n\nKerry Condon, The Banshees of Inisherin\n\nAngela Bassett, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\n\nJamie Lee Curtis, Everything Everywhere All At Once\n\nStephanie Hsu, Everything Everywhere All At Once\n\nDolly De Leon, Triangle of Sadness\n\nHong Chau, The Whale\n\nMichelle Williams, The Fabelmans\n\nCarey Mulligan, She Said\n\nJanelle Monae, Glass Onion\n\nNina Hoss, Tár\n\nJessie Buckley, Women Talking\n\nClaire Foy, Women Talking\n\nKeke Palmer, Nope\n\nSadie Sink, The Whale\n\nLashana Lynch, The Woman King\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTOR\n\nThere is a trio of men who received nominations at the “Big Four” precursors— Ke Huy Quan for his turn as Michelle Yeoh’s kind-hearted husband in Everything Everywhere All At Once and Brendan Gleeson and Barry Keoghan for their roles as Colin Farrell’s friends-cum-adversaries in The Banshees of Inisherin. Conventional wisdom says that Eddie Redmayne should be a lock for The Good Nurse given that he was nominated at the Globes, SAG, and BAFTA. However, I suspect that he will be snubbed here given the tepid reception for his film overall. (Although, perhaps this is wishful thinking on my part, similarly to my prediction of an Ana de Armas omission in Best Actress.) I suspect that the final two slots will go to Paul Dano for his turn as the patriarch in The Fabelmans and — in a surprise inclusion — Ben Whishaw as the sole male member of the ensemble of Women Talking. But honestly, the fifth one could go to a number of different actors ranging from the perpetually superb Brian Tyree Henry (who deserved a nomination for If Beale Street Could Talk) to Hollywood veteran Judd Hirsch (who was previously nominated over 40 years ago for Ordinary People) to Hollywood A-lister Brad Pitt (who won this category 3 years ago for Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood).\n\nKe Huy Quan, Everything Everywhere All At Once\n\nBrenda Gleeson, The Banshees of Inisherin\n\nBarry Keoghan, The Banshees of Inisherin\n\nPaul Dano, The Fabelmans\n\nBen Whishaw, Women Talking\n\nEddie Redmayne, The Good Nurse\n\nJudd Hirsch, The Fabelmans\n\nAlbrecht Schuch, All Quiet on the Western Front\n\nBrian Tyree Henry, Causeway\n\nBrad Pitt, Babylon\n\nMicheal Ward, Empire of Light\n\nWoody Harrelson, Triangle of Sadness\n\nTom Hanks, Elvis\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY\n\nThe original screenplay category seems to have three locks in the form of Everything Everywhere All At Once, The Banshees of Inisherin, and Tár. It seems likely that they will be joined by The Fabelmans given that it got into this category at the BAFTAs even though it was snubbed in literally every other category. The 5th spot is a bit trickier though. Many are expecting that it will be Triangle of Sadness and I am putting my money there as well, but I think Elvis and Aftersun are being significantly underestimated.\n\nDaniel Kwan and Daniel Sheinert, Everything Everywhere All At Once\n\nMartin McDonagh, The Banshees of Inisherin\n\nTodd Field, Tár\n\nSteven Spielberg and Tony Kushner, The Fabelmans\n\nRuben Östlund, Triangle of Sadness\n\nBaz Luhrmann, Sam Bromell, Craig Pearce, Jeremy Doner, Elvis\n\nCharlotte Wells, Aftersun\n\nDamien Chazelle, Babylon\n\nJeong Seo-kyeong and Park Chan-wook, Decision to Leave\n\nSeth Reiss and Will Tracy, The Menu\n\nJordan Peele, Nope\n\nMaria Bello and Dana Stevens, The Woman King\n\nBilly Eichner and Nicholas Stoller, Bros\n\nBEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY\n\nIn contrast to the Original Screenplay category, this category is a bit of a wasteland. The most likely nominees are Women Talking, The Whale, and Glass Onion. I expect that they will be joined by some combination of the following 3 films — All Quiet on the Western Front, She Said, and Living. But honestly, there is not a single lock in this category, with each contender ripe for omission. Of the main 8 categories, this one seems the most likely to have some out-of-left-field inclusions."
