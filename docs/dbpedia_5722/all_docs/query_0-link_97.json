        "text": "Sonya Eddy’s Daytime Emmy win almost a year to the day that she passed away should have been a fitting, if bittersweet, end to her General Hospital career. Instead, sadly, it has given rise to discord, according to a report by TMZ.\n\nEddy’s Best Supporting Actress statuette was accepted on her behalf by friend and producing partner Tyler Ford. But her family wants the award, the website says, and is displeased that they were not informed ahead of time that she would be winning. To remedy the situation, the Eddys have written to the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences to register their upset and are hoping that Ford will give them the award.\n\nShould Ford comply with the family’s request, Eddy’s Emmy will go to her mother, who the article notes supported her throughout her career. At 84, Eddy’s mom is being treated for Alzheimer’s and dementia. It was disagreements over her care, TMZ states, that led to a rift between Epiphany’s much-missed portrayer and some of her relatives. Her estranged brother Robbie told the site that, shortly before Eddy died of an infection following non-emergency surgery, they were working to mend their fractured relationship.\n\nThe veteran actress had made her General Hospital debut in 2006 after appearing on almost every sitcom under the sun, from Married… With Children to Seinfeld. She’d also already played a nurse in such movies as Patch Adams and Inspector Gadget.\n\nWhile we wait to see how the Emmy matter is resolved, hopefully amicably, scroll through the below photo gallery to read why Eddy was so beloved by her General Hospital castmates and more."
