        "text": "The Kelly Clarkson Show won outstanding daytime talk series for the fourth consecutive year at the 2024 Daytime Emmys, which were held at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel in Los Angeles on Friday (June 7). Entertainment Tonight’s Kevin Frazier and Nischelle Turner co-hosted the show, which was broadcast on CBS.\n\nKelly Clarkson has won eight Daytime Emmys over the course of the first five seasons of her popular talk show (compared to three Grammys over a much longer period of time). Impressively, she has won at least one Emmy in each of the five seasons.\n\nIn accepting the award for outstanding daytime talk series, Clarkson gave special thanks to NBC for listening to her concerns when she proposed moving the show from Los Angeles to New York.\n\n“Thanks to NBC for believing in our show. …The fact that NBC, a huge company, took time and listened when I said ‘Hey, my life is not going super great. I don’t know if I can live here [in L.A.] anymore. I don’t know if I can do this.’ And they really wrapped their arms around us and they helped us move. And the move has been so great for not just me and my family but our whole show. It takes a lot of time and money and effort to do that. It is not unnoticed. I just want to say thank you for thinking of mental health as well as, you know, a product.”\n\nClarkson did not, however, win outstanding daytime talk series host, an award she had won the last four years running. The award went instead to Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos, the married stars of the syndicated Live With Kelly and Mark. It was a surprise win: Ripa and Consuelos didn’t even attend the show.\n\nThis was Ripa’s sixth win in that category. Only three other hosts have won six or more times in the history of the category, which dates to 1974. Phil Donahue leads with nine awards in the category, followed by Oprah Winfrey (seven) and Rosie O’Donnell (also six). What’s most impressive about Ripa’s track record in the category is that she has won alongside four different co-hosts. She and Regis Philbin won twice in the category. She and Michael Strahan also won twice. She and Ryan Seacrest won once.\n\nTV legend Dick Van Dyke won guest performance in a daytime drama series for his appearance on Days of our Lives. At 98, Van Dyke is the oldest Daytime Emmy winner in history. “If I had known I was going to live this long, I would have taken better care of myself,” Van Dyke joked in accepting the honor. Van Dyke, who was featured on the Mary Poppins soundtrack, which topped the Billboard 200 for 14 weeks in 1965, was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in 1995 and received the Kennedy Center Honors in 2020.\n\nEntertainment Tonight won outstanding entertainment news series for the fifth consecutive year.\n\nSelena + Chef: Home for the Holidays (Food Network), hosted by Selena Gomez, was nominated for outstanding culinary series. It lost to Be My Guest With Ina Garten, which was a first-time winner in the category.\n\nAmanda Kloots and Jerry O’Connell, Emmy-nominated co-hosts of The Talk, opened the show with a special-material version of Petula Clark’s classic “Downtown,” a No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1965. The rewrite was pretty corny, a throwback to the era when such material was a staple of variety and awards shows.\n\nThe In Memoriam segment included entertainment reporter Sam Rubin (KTLA, Los Angeles) and actor and host Louis Gossett Jr.\n\nIf it doesn’t seem like a full year has gone by since the last Daytime Emmys, you’re right. The 2023 Daytime Emmys were held on Dec. 15. They were delayed six full months because of last year’s strikes by the Writers Guild and SAG-AFTRA.\n\nThe Daytime Creative Arts & Lifestyle Emmy Awards were presented on Saturday, June 8. It was streamed live at 9 p.m. ET/6 p.m. PT at watch.TheEmmys.tv and via The Emmys apps for iOS, tvOS, Android, FireTV, and Roku.\n\nWinfrey was among the winners on Saturday’s show as an executive producer of Oprah and “The Color Purple” Journey on Max. It won for outstanding arts and popular culture program.\n\nThree months after winning his first Oscar for Oppenheimer, Robert Downey Jr. won his first Emmy (Daytime or Primetime) as an executive producer of Downey’s Dream Cars, which won in the lifestyle program category.\n\nThe Kelly Clarkson Show won two more Daytime Emmys on Saturday – lighting direction and outstanding live sound mixing and sound editing.\n\nThe 51st annual Daytime Emmy Awards was produced by NATAS and Associated Television International (ATI). Adam Sharp and Lisa Armstrong were executive producers from NATAS, while David McKenzie was executive producer from ATI.\n\nHere are the 2024 Daytime Emmy nominations in selected categories, with winners marked.
