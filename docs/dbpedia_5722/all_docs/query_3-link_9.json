        "text": "The Emmys celebrate excellence in the television industry and have become one of the most prestigious career achievements an actor can win, but how much do they earn for winning it?\n\nEstablished in 1949, these prestigious awards honor outstanding achievements in various categories, including drama, comedy, and reality programming.\n\nHeld annually, the Emmys showcase exceptional performances, writing, directing, and production in both primetime and daytime television. Some notable categories include Outstanding Drama Series, Outstanding Comedy Series, and various individual types such as Outstanding Lead Actor.\n\nThe ceremony attracts industry professionals and viewers alike, serving as a barometer for television excellence and over the years, the Emmys have evolved to reflect the changing landscape of television, recognizing diverse and innovative content that captivates audiences worldwide.\n\nHow much is the Emmy Award worth?\n\nFor winning an Emmy, an actor gets no prize money. Instead, recipients receive the Emmy statuette, which is a symbol of recognition for their outstanding contributions to the television industry.\n\nAn Emmy acknowledgment is considered a prestigious achievement within the entertainment community, which can contribute to increased opportunities and career advancement for those in the industry, but there is no direct monetary reward associated with receiving an Emmy.\n\nBut in terms of value, the statuettes cost approximately $400 according to People and over the course of one evening, the event runners will fork out $47,200 for 118 categories.\n\nWhere can I watch the 2023 Emmys... in 2024?\n\nDue to strikes, the Emmys were delayed by five months so now they will take place on January 15 from 20:00 ET/17:00 PT.\n\nThe event show can be watched live from Fox and can be viewed online with Hulu and will be hosted at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles, California.\n\nSuccession and The Last Of US are expected to dominate proceedings, accounting for a combined total of 51 nominations for the 75th annual Primetime Emmy Awards."
