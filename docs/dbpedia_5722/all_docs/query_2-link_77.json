        "text": "Although we live a continent away from Bethel Church in Redding, California, we feel an ongoing connection there. We have attended talks on the East coast when Bethel staff members have traveled out this way, and we benefit from their ongoing presentations on podcasts and YouTube.\n\nWe made a month-long pilgrimage to Redding in 2018 to check the church out in more detail. I tend to be somewhat skeptical (“Is this too good to be true?”), so I made a point while I was there to schmooze with lower-level staffers to try to get the inside scoop. I found a consistent picture of integrity and good-willed service at all levels. I wrote up my 2018 visit on this blog here: Prayer for Healing at Bethel Church.\n\nOne thing that Bethel is known for is a hopefulness about supernatural healing. Managing expectations for answers to prayers for healing is tricky. I do not claim to have found the perfect balance here. In most churches, when prayers are offered for someone’s healing, there is a (spoken or unspoken) caveat clause of, “If it be thy will.” That lowers expectations, which in turn mitigates disappointment when (as so often happens), the ailment simply runs its natural course. I think that is reasonable theology, and as a practical matter everyone, even the holiest saint, eventually dies of something; that seems to be just the way things are.\n\nThe problem that Bethel has with this approach is that when Jesus was on earth, he (as a general rule) healed everyone who came to him. There is no record of him telling, say, a leper, “I just don’t want to heal you”, or “Sorry, my power is running low today, I can’t heal that condition.” If Jesus perfectly represented the heart of God, the reasoning goes, then it must always be the case that God does (on some level) want to heal everyone who is prayed for in genuine faith. In support of this thinking, there are a number of passages in the gospels where Jesus makes extravagant claims about how his followers’ believing prayers will be answered. If a Bethel person prays for a healing which does not occur, the usual response is not, “I guess it was just God’s will for them to stay sick”, but “How can I grow in faith and godliness so that next time I pray for this type of ailment, it will get healed?”\n\nAccordingly, Bethel maintains a trademark culture of elevated expectations for miraculous healings. In my observation, this culture does seem to lead to a greater occurrence of physical recoveries. Skeptics will of course find fault with practically any reported miracles, so I don’t want to get distracted here with arguing over this; see my 2018 article (link above) for a more thorough discussion of these issues. My point here is that it is a common occurrence in the greater Bethel community to have reports of significant, unusual healings.\n\nA picture I took of Bill Johnson at the end of a meeting at Bethel church in 2018. Hundreds of people lined up to come to the front of the room for prayer, and he greeted and blessed each one.\n\nThus, it was a doubly bitter blow for emeritus senior pastor Bill Johnson and for Bethel to have his wife Beni die last week after a long battle with cancer. Losing a spouse is, of course, one of the most traumatic experiences a man or woman can ever have. To lose this widely known and loved woman, after untold hours of fervent prayer across the entire community, also calls into question the whole Bethel paradigm of the extravagant goodness of God and his will to always heal.\n\nI was impressed by the way Bill stepped up to speak to the church yesterday to share how he was handling his grief. He was obviously in pain, and broke down a few times, but he was vulnerable enough to disclose how he was processing it. I found his words to be inspiring, and I hope to catch some of his spirit to help me through the increasing trials I will face as I and my loved ones age and eventually start to fail physically and mentally.\n\nHere is a link to Bill’s talk in the Bethel church service for Sunday, July 17: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbUZk98T0l0\n\nFor those who don’t feel they have to time to go listen to a talk, I have transcribed the first section of his talk below. I hope this is of value to some readers.\n\nMY TRANSCRIPT OF FIRST SECTION OF BILL JOHNSON’S TALK AT BETHEL CHURCH SERVICE, JULY 17, 2022:\n\nIt’s so good to be here, such an incredible privilege to have such a large family… I’m just glad for the privilege to be with family and friends… I found out during the Covid thing that I was addicted to people and that addiction has only gotten worse…\n\nThe backslider in heart will always judge God by what he didn’t do.\n\nBut those who run with tenderness for who he is will always define him by what he has said, by what he has promised, by what he’s done. And to be as honest as I know how to be, I have seen too much of his kindness to think anything other than that he is absolutely good, always good.\n\nWe don’t get to choose stuff like, like “I don’t want to experience any pain”. That’s not an option we get as we do life.\n\nIn fact let’s be really honest, he says things like, “Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, in everything give thanks.” Those verses are completely useless unless you’re going to experience loss and disappointment. I mean, nobody needs to be taught to rejoice if everything works the way you want it to work. It’s pointless.\n\nSo, his nature is defined by promise and by his history, his testimony, and that’s what we build theology around. That’s who he is.\n\nBut what about loss? That’s the mystery that we have the privilege of carrying. The level of revelation that God gives you, it will always be equal to the measure of mystery you are willing to live with; and the inability to live with mystery is your resistance to childlikeness. It’s childlikeness that actually gives us access to dimensions and realms of the kingdom that you can’t get in any other way.\n\nThere’s certain things that he has hidden in the journey. For example, several years ago I discovered something about “In the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for you are with me,” and what I found was there is a measure of his presence that you can only find in the valley of the shadow of death.\n\nAnd we say we love presence, and we do – – we are people that gather to celebrate and honor who he is, and to thrive in the presence of the spirit of God, who is always with us, and there is no greater treasure than him and there never will be. Heaven itself is him.\n\nAnd yet there are aspects of his presence that you can only find in the valley of the shadow of death. It’s only in darkness, and darkness of soul in the trial of not knowing what’s going on\n\nand doing everything you know to do and having things not work out like you think they should. He is not a vending machine. I don’t get to put a quarter in and get out what I want.\n\nIt’s a relational journey, and I’ve experienced his kindness – – his kindness, his miracles at a level that I could never earn or deserve. And I just don’t have the right to reevaluate what he is like because I have experienced loss. It doesn’t work that way.\n\nIt just doesn’t work that way, it’s just everybody in the room has experienced this, so I don’t stand here as the only guy who is experiencing pain, I understand that – – I do life with you, we’ve wept together and laughed together, I get that.\n\nBut God gives us these opportunities, special opportunities to grow down, to become more childlike. It’s the simplicity of faith that just trusts him no matter what. It’s a simplicity of child likeness that just says, “You know what, he knows what’s happening and I don’t.” And I’m going to trust him. I’m going to trust him. I don’t want my “Why?” to come between me and God. I don’t want to critique God, he critiques me.\n\nNone of us would choose loss, pain, disappointment, any of this stuff. None of us would choose this for ourselves or for anyone else, not even our biggest enemy. You just wouldn’t do that. It’s not something that any of us would gravitate toward.\n\nAnd yet we don’t have options at times. So, what am I going to do? Is God my friend? Yeah, but he was my Lord before he was my friend. And my friendship with God can only go where his lordship has already been. I can’t go in a friendship with God where I haven’t gone in lordship.\n\nAnd one of the things that has been such a valuable thing for us through the years has been the realization that, I discovered this accidentally, when my dad died, you heard me share the story when he died – – I was faced with learning something I had never known at that level before and that was this: I’ve just experienced loss and the disappointment is huge, huge, the pain is annoying, it’s just…\n\nThe questions, the what ifs… but all that pain and the discomfort and the questions and all that stuff, I’ll never have any of that in heaven.\n\nI will be a worshiper for all of eternity, who will glorify him for all of eternity. I will bow before the lamb on the throne for all of eternity. I will declare his wonders, I will celebrate his greatness, his grace, his kindness, for all of eternity. But I will never get the chance to do it with pain. That’s only in this life. I want to give him the most priceless gift I can give him, and that is joy in the loss, that is celebration in pain, that is giving up my right to understand. He gives the peace that passes understanding, which means I have to give up my right to understand to enjoy the peace that he purposed to give.\n\n… Once you’ve tasted it, you never forget the taste of his kindness, and it puts everything else in perspective… It’s a privilege to just offer him celebration and praise. I know that sounds contradictory and to some it would sound forced, but to honor him as a healer when you just lost somebody you love through a disease… It’s not fake, it’s not hype… This is who he is.\n\n…“Well, why did this happen?” I don’t know. He doesn’t work for me. I work for him. He never owes me an explanation. None. He often gives them but he doesn’t owe me. I owe him every day of my life. I am indebted to him, and so [I have] the privilege of lifting hands and voice in the midst of tears… I remember my aunt, who is in heaven, Helen, I remember her saying once that laughter with tears is a beautiful rainbow… I don’t understand it, but I like it.\n\nSo I’m just gonna do it, I’m just gonna make sure I laugh while I’m crying my head off.\n\nTo grab your moments, there are certain moments in life that we never get them back again, and I never get a chance to steward that moment again. I get one crack at it… And to take the moment of greatest pain, of greatest loss or greatest confusion or whatever, and just grab it and determine I’m going to do the best I can to give him an offering that costs me – – I get one chance.\n\nI’m glad I haven’t had to go through this alone, it’s been wonderful to be surrounded by so many friends and family, hour after hour, day after day.\n\n… There are some aspects of the kingdom that you can only get through childlike trust… You can try to be as smart as you want, but you can only get it through childlike trust. And to do that you have to have mystery. There are certain things that just open up through childlike trust.\n\nI want to read the scripture to you… I want to share something that, at least for me, it’s a life-giving perspective on truth.\n\nMourning is biblical… The weeping kind of mourning… It’s not smart to avoid mourning when you have losses… When you have stuff going on inside, that you can’t manage well, mourning with family and friends in some way… Get before God and mourn well… Because there’s two options in the mourning: it can either take you to the comforter, into the presence of the Holy Spirit or it will take you into unbelief. There’s only two options.\n\nBlessed are those who mourn: Matthew five, verse four. “Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.”\n\nMourning can take me into presence, into experience that I don’t understand. And it’s important because most of the time when we experience loss or whatever, answers won’t fix the problem. Presence will.\n\nSuppose God shows up and he says this happened for this reason and this reason… Still I hurt, and it doesn’t fix anything. What I need is, I need him, I need to come so near that everything that’s out of sorts in me somehow finds its place and there’s peace in there. It doesn’t mean I have every question answered, it just means that I’m being inundated with the spirit of God who has promised to never ever leave me, and in that presence there is a comfort. It’s almost like I find my place – – I don’t know what’s going on, but I find my place in his presence.\n\n….[ transcript skips a few paragraphs regarding the eleven disciples who were so deep in despair after Jesus’ death that they rejected the hopeful reports of others who had encountered the risen Jesus ]…\n\nYou see, you’ve got a mourning that leads you to him, and a mourning that leads us to a resistance to the God who is actually speaking and reaching out to us, bringing us the gift of life and encouragement, strength in this journey that I’m in right now.\n\nI found language for this that I never knew, and it’s in first Thessalonians chapter 4, verse 13:\n\n“I do not want you to be ignorant brethren, concerning those who have fallen asleep, lest you sorrow as others who have no hope.” That word “sorrow “is grieving, morning, lamenting”… He says I don’t want you to mourn like those who have no hope, that gives us a clue.\n\nTypically mourning must be enhanced with hope or it will lead to unbelief. That’s it. That’s it, right there. There’s got to be something more than the hellish moment you’re in right now, there’s got be something on the other side.\n\nThis is such a critical part of kingdom reality that even Jesus endured the cross because of the hope, the joy that was set before him. There was hope on the other side, and because of that Jesus could endure the most horrific thing any person has ever endured, and it was for that."
