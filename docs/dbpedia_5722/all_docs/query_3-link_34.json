        "text": "The clock may have turned to 2024, but the 2023 Emmys are still on our brain, with the strike-delayed ceremony finally set to air January 15 on Fox. Hosted by Anthony Anderson, the ceremony will honor shows that might have aired a while ago—the eligibility window began in June 2022—but have had no trouble lingering in the cultural imagination. Just take the Golden Globes, where Succession, Beef, and The Bear—all nominees we expect to clean up at the Emmys—had a series of major victories.\n\nAnd speaking of expectations: We’ve predicted the winners in every category that will be announced during the Primetime Emmys, from the supporting-actor categories all the way up to the best drama series. (Many other Emmys, including in the guest-acting categories, have already been awarded at the Creative Arts Emmys.) Take a look at our predictions, fill out your ballot to make your own picks, and join us on January 15 to see how it all plays out.\n\nDrama Series\n\nAndor\n\nBetter Call Saul\n\nThe Crown\n\nHouse of the Dragon\n\nThe Last of Us\n\nWINNER: Succession\n\nThe White Lotus\n\nYellowjackets\n\nThe fourth and final season of HBO’s Succession is set to clean up at the Emmys, which will include taking home this top prize. It won this category for both its second and third seasons, beating out other big shows like Ozark, The Crown, Stranger Things, and Squid Game. We’d say the competition is even stronger this year, with the success of The White Lotus and The Last of Us as TV phenomena, and if Succession hadn’t delivered the knockout final season that it did, it would likely have been a race between those two other HBO shows. But the win for Succession seems inevitable at this point. This one is a lock. —Rebecca Ford\n\nActor in a Drama Series\n\nJeff Bridges, The Old Man\n\nBrian Cox, Succession\n\nWINNER: Kieran Culkin, Succession\n\nBob Odenkirk, Better Call Saul\n\nPedro Pascal, The Last of Us\n\nJeremy Strong, Succession\n\nThe Last of Us performed so well at last week’s Creative Arts Emmys—notably beating out Succession in a few key races, including guest acting—that it’s clear the HBO freshman is even stronger with the Television Academy than we thought. Does that mean Pedro Pascal has the heat behind him to take advantage of some Succession vote-splitting and pull off a major upset here? I wouldn’t rule it out, but just as likely is Succession hogging basically all of these ballots, since it’s occupying fully half of the nomination slots. Both Jeremy Strong and Kieran Culkin have a lot in their corner, the former with that searing finale turn (and a previous win to boot) and the latter having made the greater overall impression in the last season. Following the Golden Globes’ lead, we’ll predict another Roman Roy–esque winner’s speech is on the way. —David Canfield\n\nActress in a Drama Series\n\nSharon Horgan, Bad Sisters\n\nMelanie Lynskey, Yellowjackets\n\nElisabeth Moss, The Handmaid’s Tale\n\nBella Ramsey, The Last of Us\n\nKeri Russell, The Diplomat\n\nWINNER: Sarah Snook, Succession\n\nOne week after nabbing the Golden Globe, Snook will almost certainly take the stage once more amid Succession’s victory lap. Though this win now seems preordained, there was a time when it didn’t: Much like her costar Kieran Culkin, Snook took a big swing by switching from the supporting categories to lead in her show’s final season. It’s a gamble that’s bound to pay off, barring some sort of enormous upset. Hopefully, this time she’ll get some better questions in the pressroom. —Hillary Busis\n\nSupporting Actor in a Drama Series\n\nF. Murray Abraham, The White Lotus\n\nNicholas Braun, Succession\n\nMichael Imperioli, The White Lotus\n\nTheo James, The White Lotus\n\nWINNER: Matthew Macfadyen, Succession\n\nAlan Ruck, Succession\n\nWill Sharpe, The White Lotus\n\nAlexander Skarsgård, Succession\n\nWhat I’d really like to know: Who is HBO rooting for here? The blessing of having exceptional talent populating your prestige dramas makes this category an embarrassment of nomination riches. Macfadyen has the edge, including a recent Globe win, and deserves the acclaim and awards he’s received thus far for playing “the human grease stain” that is Tom Wambsgans. We would not be mad at a surprise win for Alexander Skarsgård however, for his standout scene-stealing—a notable feat among already established scene-stealing Succession regulars. And he did win his first Emmy while on another acclaimed HBO ensemble drama (Big Little Lies). —Kara Warner\n\nSupporting Actress in a Drama Series\n\nJ. Smith-Cameron, Succession\n\nWINNER: Jennifer Coolidge, The White Lotus\n\nElizabeth Debicki, The Crown\n\nMeghann Fahy, The White Lotus\n\nSabrina Impacciatore, The White Lotus\n\nAubrey Plaza, The White Lotus\n\nRhea Seehorn, Better Call Saul\n\nSimona Tabasco, The White Lotus\n\nYes, Elizabeth Debicki is fresh off a win for The Crown, but the sheer number of nominees for The White Lotus in this category should tell you how popular this show still was when Emmy voting was taking place over the summer. Given the category-shifting that’s happened for The White Lotus, this wouldn’t technically be a repeat win for Coolidge—she won supporting actress in a limited series last year—but it should feel like an appropriate farewell to Tanya all the same. —Katey Rich\n\nWriting for a Drama Series\n\nBeau Willimon, Andor (“One Way Out”)\n\nWINNER: Jesse Armstrong, Succession (“Connor’s Wedding”)\n\nGordon Smith, Better Call Saul (“Point and Shoot”)\n\nPeter Gould, Better Call Saul (“Saul Gone”)\n\nSharon Horgan, Dave Finkel, and Brett Baer, Bad Sisters (“The Prick”)\n\nCraig Mazin, The Last of Us (“Long, Long Time”)\n\nMike White, The White Lotus (“Arrivederci”)\n\nWere it any other year, The White Lotus, so beloved as an auteur-driven show, would probably walk off with the prize. But this year, there was probably no more ballyhooed episode of television than “Connor’s Wedding,” the hour in which family patriarch Logan Roy finally shuffled off this mortal coil, sending his children reeling while stuck on a boat for their dumb brother’s nuptials. The episode is a feat of acting and direction, to be sure, but it is nothing without its tense, crisp, torrent of stuttering, anguished, overlapping dialogue. The crown jewel of a great show’s final season, “Connor’s Wedding” ought to be the Academy’s parting gift to Armstrong. —Richard Lawson\n\nDirecting for a Drama Series\n\nBenjamin Caron, Andor (“Rix Road”)\n\nPeter Hoar, The Last of Us (“Long, Long Time”)\n\nWINNER: Mark Mylod, Succession (“Connor’s Wedding”)\n\nAndrij Parekh, Succession (“America Decides”)\n\nLorene Scafaria, Succession (“Living+”)\n\nDearbhla Walsh, Bad Sisters (“The Prick”)\n\nMike White, The White Lotus (“Arrivederci”)\n\nConventional wisdom might have you believe that Succession’s three nominated directors—Peter Hoar, Lorene Scarfaria, and Mark Mylod—might end up splitting the vote, paving the way for Mike White to win for his buzzy White Lotus season two finale, “Arrivederci.” But conventional wisdom need not apply here. Expect Mylod, who’s been nominated twice before in this category, to walk away with the Emmy for helming “Connor’s Wedding,” the most devastating and shocking episode from Succession’s acclaimed final season. The longtime Succession director also crafted the blistering series finale “With Open Eyes,” so Mylod winning for directing this perfect episode of television is also a way of rewarding him for sticking the landing. —Chris Murphy\n\nComedy Series\n\nAbbott Elementary\n\nBarry\n\nWINNER: The Bear\n\nJury Duty\n\nThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\n\nOnly Murders in the Building\n\nTed Lasso\n\nWednesday\n\nWe can’t ignore the fact that Ted Lasso has won this category for the past two years: The TV Academy loves that show. This third (and rumored final) season was nominated for an incredible 21 Emmys, more than it got for either of its first two seasons. Jury Duty would be an interesting and unexpected winner here as the dark horse, and Maisel won in 2018, so we guess we shouldn’t count it out. But The Bear, which is competing for its first season, has a unique advantage in that its very strong second season was airing over the summer, which means it was fresh in voters’ minds when they were casting ballots. Indeed, we have to assume some probably thought they were voting for the second season anyway. We’re betting the heat in the kitchen is enough to unseat the current title holder. —R.F.\n\nActor in a Comedy Series\n\nBill Hader, Barry\n\nJason Segel, Shrinking\n\nMartin Short, Only Murders in the Building\n\nJason Sudeikis, Ted Lasso\n\nWINNER: Jeremy Allen White, The Bear\n\nNearly two full years since The Bear premiered to critical acclaim and near-universal fanfare, and a week after its second season swept the Globes’ comedy categories, the Emmys are only now getting around to honoring this show’s first. That makes a win for Hollywood’s breakout leading man inevitable, even overdue by this point. Even emotional final seasons for previous category winners Hader and Sudeikis won’t stand a chance with Carmy in the kitchen —Savannah Walsh\n\nActress in a Comedy Series\n\nChristina Applegate, Dead to Me\n\nRachel Brosnahan, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\n\nQuinta Brunson, Abbott Elementary\n\nWINNER: Natasha Lyonne, Poker Face\n\nJenna Ortega, Wednesday\n\nFeels like any of these five could win here. Brunson came in as the front-runner, but Abbott Elementary lost a surprising amount of heat with voters in its second season. (Taraji P. Henson couldn’t even nab guest actress, where she was widely tipped to win.) Emmy winners Applegate and Brosnahan feel a bit outside of the buzz cycle, but have strong narratives backing them as they represent final seasons—in Applegate’s case, maybe of the last show she’ll ever star in, and in Brosnahan’s, of a show this voting body loved deeply. But I think the most intriguing candidates here are the newcomers, Ortega and Lyonne. The former is in the most popular show of the group, but the Academy may still be a bit too unfamiliar with her. And Lyonne is beloved, but on a show that wasn’t as widely embraced, assumedly because it aired on the lower-profile Peacock. Still, after Judith Light did win the guest-acting Emmy for Poker Face last week, we’ll go out on a limb and bet that enough saw Lyonne’s stellar work after all. —D.C.\n\nSupporting Actor in a Comedy Series\n\nAnthony Carrigan, Barry\n\nPhil Dunster, Ted Lasso\n\nBrett Goldstein, Ted Lasso\n\nJames Marsden, Jury Duty\n\nWINNER: Ebon Moss-Bachrach, The Bear\n\nTyler James Williams, Abbott Elementary\n\nHenry Winkler, Barry\n\nBrett Goldstein has won this category twice in a row, and it’s not impossible that there’s enough residual love for Ted Lasso to make it a threepeat, especially with Barry’s tremendous Anthony Carrigan and Henry Winkler potentially splitting their vote. But The Bear ought to dominate in many places thanks to the canny late-June premiere of its second season. And even though Moss-Bachrach is technically not nominated for his brilliant stand-alone second season episode, “Forks,” it ought to be fresh enough in voters’ minds to push him to victory. —K.R.\n\nSupporting Actress in a Comedy Series\n\nAlex Borstein, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\n\nWINNER: Ayo Edebiri, The Bear\n\nJanelle James, Abbott Elementary\n\nSheryl Lee Ralph, Abbott Elementary\n\nJuno Temple, Ted Lasso\n\nHannah Waddingham, Ted Lasso\n\nJessica Williams, Shrinking\n\nEmmy voters didn’t have the chance to see Ayo Edebiri’s delightful Golden Globes speech before making their selections in August, but it’s hard to imagine that they weren’t equally charmed by her breakout performance in season one of The Bear. It only helps that season two—featuring a spotlight episode for Edebiri’s Sydney—aired during the lead-up to the Emmys’ summer voting window. And while there’s certainly a lot of Emmys love for Abbott Elementary and Ted Lasso (2023 nominees Sheryl Lee Ralph and Hannah Waddingham won in 2022 and 2021, respectively), expect The Bear to continue to steamroll the competition here. —Natalie Jarvey\n\nWriting for a Comedy Series\n\nBill Hader, Barry (“Wow”)\n\nJohn Hoffman, Matteo Borghese, and Rob Turbovsky, Only Murders in the Building (“I Know Who Did It”)\n\nBrendan Hunt, Joe Kelly, and Jason Sudeikis, Ted Lasso (“So Long, Farewell”)\n\nWINNER: Christopher Storer, The Bear (“System”)\n\nMekki Leeper, Jury Duty (“Ineffective Assistance”)\n\nChris Kelly and Sarah Schneider, The Other Two (“Cary & Brooke Go to an AIDS Play”)\n\nIt would be peachy if The Other Two could eke out a win for this incredible moment from its final season—and a nicer note for the series to end on than the news that it was canceled amid HR complaints. But regardless of whether The Bear beats out Ted Lasso for comedy’s biggest prize, it seems destined to win hardware for its pilot—not the best installment of season one (that would be “Review,” another perfect episode), but one that nimbly sets up the premise and stakes of television’s latest prestige hit. Expect an acceptance speech that emphasizes the importance of good writing, for obvious reasons. —H.B.\n\nDirecting for a Comedy Series\n\nTim Burton, Wednesday (“Wednesday’s Child Is Full of Woe”)\n\nBill Hader, Barry (“Wow”)\n\nDeclan Lowney, Ted Lasso (“So Long, Farewell”)\n\nAmy Sherman-Palladino, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel (“Four Minutes”)\n\nWINNER: Christopher Storer, The Bear (“Review”)\n\nMary Lou Belli, The Ms. Pat Show (“Don’t Touch My Hair”)\n\nWhile there are some big names in this category, like Tim Burton and Bill Hader, it looks like the Emmy for best directing for a comedy series will likely be a two-horse race between an Academy darling and an upstart. Ted Lasso holds the distinction of being the reigning champion in both the comedy series and the directing categories, so director Declan Lowney might have a leg up for helming the show’s season three finale. But considering Ted Lasso’s widely maligned third season and the introduction of hot new “comedy” series The Bear, Christopher Storer should score a big win for directing “Review,” which captures the frenetic and anxiety-inducing chaotic energy that has become a hallmark of the series. —C.M.\n\nLimited Series\n\nWINNER: Beef\n\nDahmer—Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story\n\nDaisy Jones & the Six\n\nFleishman Is in Trouble\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi\n\nWho says Hollywood doesn’t reward original ideas anymore? Although two of these nominees are based on beloved novels, one exists in the Star Wars universe, and another chronicles one of the most notorious serial killers of all time, it is the lone show not based on preexisting material that will win here. Netflix’s hit dark comedy swept the Globes’ limited series categories last week, including wins for stars Steven Yeun and Ali Wong, and there’s no sign of that streak ending at the Emmys. The closest competitor would be Dahmer—Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, which is tied with Beef for most nominations in the limited series field at 13 apiece. But like last year’s winner in this category, The White Lotus, Beef is projected to win writing and directing honors in this field—making a path to victory clear, with no pissed-off drivers in sight. —S.W.\n\nActor in a Limited Series or TV Movie\n\nTaron Egerton, Black Bird\n\nKumail Nanjiani, Welcome to Chippendales\n\nEvan Peters, Dahmer—Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story\n\nDaniel Radcliffe, Weird: The Al Yankovic Story\n\nMichael Shannon, George & Tammy\n\nWINNER: Steven Yeun, Beef\n\nNetflix will have reason to celebrate in this category; the question is in what direction. For much of last year, the wind seemed to be blowing Peters’s way, his widely seen portrayal of Jeffrey Dahmer earning strong reviews and a Golden Globe for best actor. Then came the Beef wave. Emmy voters simply don’t spread the wealth when it comes to a show they really love, and Beef appears primed to run the table in the limited-series categories. So while Peters remains a popular pick, there’s no reason to expect that the Oscar-nominated Steven Yeun would be left out of that embrace for one of his richest performances to date. —D.C.\n\nActress in a Limited Series or TV Movie\n\nLizzy Caplan, Fleishman Is in Trouble\n\nJessica Chastain, George & Tammy\n\nDominique Fishback, Swarm\n\nKathryn Hahn, Tiny Beautiful Things\n\nRiley Keough, Daisy Jones & the Six\n\nWINNER: Ali Wong, Beef\n\nJust this past weekend, Wong became the first Asian American to ever win in the best actress in a limited series category at the Golden Globes, where Beef cleaned up with three awards. Starring opposite Steven Yeun, Wong delivers an intense performance in Netflix’s revenge series, proving her abilities go far beyond her signature stand-up. This category has other strong contenders, of course, including Jessica Chastain, who is often awards catnip; Lizzy Caplan for her work in Fleishman; and Dominique Fishback’s bold performance in Swarm. But Wong feels far out in front of the rest because of the universal praise that the series got when it was released. —R.F.\n\nSupporting Actor in a Limited Series or TV Movie\n\nMurray Bartlett, Welcome to Chippendales\n\nPaul Walter Hauser, Black Bird\n\nRichard Jenkins, Dahmer—Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story\n\nJoseph Lee, Beef\n\nRay Liotta, Black Bird\n\nWINNER: Young Mazino, Beef\n\nJesse Plemons, Love & Death\n\nYet another category that is packed with general excellence in performance and project. Murray Bartlett’s other nominated guest actor role, in The Last of Us, has more buzz than Chippendales as a whole, and although Ray Liotta’s posthumous nomination for Black Bird should be celebrated, the Television Academy has only awarded seven posthumous Emmys out of nearly 30 nominees. Regardless, Beef has the well-deserved edge and momentum, and Young Mazino’s portrayal of Paul, a hapless younger bro/himbo-with-a-heart, earned him bona fide breakout status and should also nab him the Emmy. —K.W.\n\nSupporting Actress in a Limited Series or TV Movie\n\nAnnaleigh Ashford, Welcome to Chippendales\n\nMaria Bello, Beef\n\nClaire Danes, Fleishman Is in Trouble\n\nJuliette Lewis, Welcome to Chippendales\n\nCamila Morrone, Daisy Jones & the Six\n\nWINNER: Niecy Nash-Betts, Dahmer—Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story\n\nMerritt Wever, Tiny Beautiful Things\n\nBeef has most of the other limited series or TV movie categories locked up, but supporting actress is where another project might eke out a win. The two likeliest candidates are Claire Danes, for her impressive and intense performance in FX’s Fleishman Is in Trouble, and Niecy Nash-Betts’s moving turn in Dahmer—Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story. Both are worthy winners for their scene-stealing work, but Nash-Betts—who won at the Critics Choice Television Awards last year—seems to have the edge. —N.J.\n\nWriting for a Limited Series or TV Movie\n\nWINNER: Lee Sung Jin, Beef (“The Birds Don’t Sing, They Screech in Pain”)\n\nJoel Kim Booster, Fire Island\n\nTaffy Brodesser-Akner, Fleishman Is in Trouble (“Me-Time”)\n\nPatrick Aison and Dan Trachtenberg, Prey\n\nJanine Nabers and Donald Glover, Swarm (“Stung”)\n\nEric Appel and “Weird Al” Yankovic, Weird: The Al Yankovic Story\n\nThe lingering oddities of the pandemic era mean that, unusually, two movies are in the mix here against the limited series that have dominated this category in recent years. But we still expect a limited series to win, even if Beef also seems likely to return for a second season and not be so limited after all. It was the freshest of all the nominees at the time of voting, and with strong acting contenders as well, Beef is poised for as big a night as it just had at the Golden Globes. —K.R.\n\nDirecting for a Limited Series\n\nParis Barclay, Dahmer—Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story (“Silenced”)\n\nCarl Franklin, Dahmer—Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story (“Bad Meat”)\n\nDan Trachtenberg, Prey\n\nValerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton, Fleishman Is in Trouble (“Me-Time”)\n\nJake Schreier, Beef (“The Great Fabricator”)\n\nWINNER: Lee Sung Jin, Beef (“Figures of Light”)\n\nThe winners for best limited series and directing have aligned all but twice in the last decade, making Beef a likely bet. But which of the nominated episodes—a tension-filled penultimate standoff in a wealthy woman’s compound, or the finale’s woodsy, cerebral meditation on the meaning of life—will triumph? Season bookends tend to do well in this category, as does recognition for a series creator, giving “Figures of Light” the edge. During his recent Globes acceptance speech for best limited series, Jin acknowledged the real-life road rage incident that inspired Beef, thanking his opposing driver. “Sir, I hope you honk and yell and inspire others for years to come,” he said. That enraged motorist—whoever he may be—should expect at least one more shout-out before awards season is through. —S.W.\n\nReality Competition Program\n\nThe Amazing Race\n\nWINNER: RuPaul’s Drag Race\n\nSurvivor\n\nTop Chef\n\nThe Voice\n\nIn a big surprise, last year’s Emmy for best reality competition series went to a freshman series, Lizzo’s Watch Out for the Big Grrrls—a competition to become Lizzo’s next backup dancer. In an even bigger surprise, Lizzo was sued by three of her own backup dancers for allegedly creating a hostile work environment after her unexpected Emmy win. (Lizzo has denied the allegations in the lawsuit.) As such, the Emmys are probably quite happy that there’s no threat of a repeat in this category, as the pop star’s competition series didn’t return for a sophomore season. So, after one crazy year, it’s back to your standard reality competition Emmy fare, with five classics logging their umpteenth nominations in the category. This year we think the Emmy will land back in loving arms of RuPaul Charles, who recently extended his streak as the most awarded host for a reality or competition program with his eighth consecutive Creative Arts Emmy win for hosting Drag Race. If you’re looking for an upset, keep an eye on Survivor, which had an impressively strong year for a series approaching its 50th season. But you can bet your bottom dollar that the statuette is coming back home to Mama Ru. —C.M.\n\nVariety Scripted Series\n\nA Black Lady Sketch Show\n\nWINNER: Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\n\nSaturday Night Live\n\nNo matter what happens in this category, a longtime winner will suddenly become a loser. Because of a change in rules, the list now includes Last Week Tonight With John Oliver, which used to compete in the talk-series category. Ridiculously, Last Week Tonight won the talk-series category for the past seven years, so we have to assume the rest of those nominated talk shows are pretty excited about this change. But Saturday Night Live has won this category for the past six years straight. So what happens? We’re guessing it goes to Oliver—but with all the chaos this shuffle has created, who knows? —R.F.\n\nTalk Series\n\nThe Daily Show With Trevor Noah\n\nJimmy Kimmel Live!\n\nLate Night With Seth Meyers\n\nWINNER: The Late Show With Stephen Colbert\n\nThe Problem With Jon Stewart\n\nWow, we actually have something to talk about here! With John Oliver booted to the other variety race in an overdue restructuring from the Television Academy, this race is wide-open, with none of these shows having ever taken home the award before. Accordingly, it feels foolish to rule anyone out. The safe bet has got to be the current statesman of late night, Stephen Colbert, a previous champ here for his Comedy Central satire The Colbert Report. But Meyers gained heat awfully quickly as a major player in the space, and Noah may intrigue enough voters as an option to reward on his last try. Still, Emmy voters love a safe bet. —D.C.\n\nListen to Vanity Fair’s Little Gold Men podcast now."
