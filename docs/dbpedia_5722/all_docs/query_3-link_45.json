        "text": "Netflix's \"The Crown\" was the big winner at Sunday's Primetime Emmy Awards, bringing home seven wins, the most of any show.\n\nThe success of that show helped push Netflix to the highest tally of all of the various networks and streaming services. It took home 10, trophies as \"The Queen's Gambit\" collected two awards, including outstanding limited series, and \"Halston\" earned one award.\n\nBetween premium cable channel HBO and streaming service HBO Max, the studio, owned by AT&T , took home nine awards. Its show \"Mare of Eastown\" garnered four wins, \"Last Week Tonight\" earned two, \"Hacks\" scored three and \"I May Destroy You\" secured one.\n\nApple TV+ earned four awards for \"Ted Lasso,\" ViacomCBS tallied two from \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" and a Stephen Colbert election special. Both NBC and Disney scored one award each.\n\nHost Cedric the Entertainer opened the night with a karaoke rendition of \"Just a Friend\" by Biz Markie, aided by Rita Wilson, LL Cool J and Lil Dicky.\n\nThe audience, which included about 500 nominees and guests, joined in, standing up, clapping and singing along. The energy level was contagious for the first hour of the show as \"Ted Lasso\" snagged two back-to-back acting awards, leading to emotional speeches from first-time winners Hannah Waddingham and Brett Goldstein.\n\nThis year's ceremony took place at L.A. Live's Event Deck instead of the Microsoft Theater, which has been home to the Emmys since 2008. The relocation was due to the Covid pandemic. Typically, attendees would have been seated in rows in a theater, but were able to congregate at small tables.\n\nWomen sweep Emmy drama and comedy directing categories\n\nFemale directors hit a milestone Sunday night, as \"The Crown's\" Jessica Hobbs and \"Hacks'\" Lucia Aniello won the awards for outstanding directing for a drama series and a comedy series, respectively.\n\nThis is the first time that women have swept both directing categories in the same year.\n\nGareth Cattermole | Getty Images\n\nHobbs' win for \"The Crown,\" marks only the fourth time in 67 years that the Emmy for outstanding directing of a drama series has gone to a woman.\n\n“Not a lot of women have won this award so I feel I’m standing on the shoulders of some really extraordinary people,” she said on stage accepting the award. “I’m very grateful for the path they led, and I particularly would like to pay tribute to my mom who at 77 is still directing.”\n\nHobbs is the daughter of director Aileen O’Sullivan.\n\nAniello, who is also the co-creator of \"Hacks,\" is the fifth woman to win the outstanding director award in the comedy category.\n\n—Sarah Whitten\n\nNetflix wins 10 awards, HBO 9 at 73rd Emmy Awards\n\nIt was a tight race between streaming service Netflix and the tag-team of HBO and HBO Max heading into the final award during the 73rd annual Primetime Emmy Awards ceremony Sunday night.\n\nNetflix ultimately took home the most wins with 10, while HBO tallied nine.\n\nTallying the Creative Arts Emmys and Sunday's Primetime Emmy Awards here's how the top studios fared:\n\nNetflix - 44\n\nHBO/HBO Max - 19\n\nDisney+ - 14\n\nAppleTV+ - 10\n\nNBC - 8\n\nVH1 - 6\n\n—Sarah Whitten\n\nConan O'Brien nearly steals the show with goofy outbursts\n\nConan O'Brien nearly stole the show with several laughter-inducing outbursts that got Twitter and the Emmy audience going crazy.\n\nWhen Chairman and CEO of the Television Academy Frank Scherma introduced the Governors Award with a speech on diversity and representation, O'Brien ushered a salute and continued to applaud even after the audience subsided.\n\nCelebrities and audiences alike took to Twitter to applaud O'Brien's goofiness, with some referring to the outbursts as sabotage.\n\nO'Brien also crashed Stephen Colbert's acceptance speech for an award for his live election-themed special.\n\nCliff Lipson | CBS | Getty Images\n\n\"Most of the people behind me really deserve this Emmy, right now,\" Colbert said, to which the audience chuckled.\n\nO'Brien did not win an award, though he was nominated for variety talk series for his late-night show, which came to an end in June after a 28-year run. John Oliver gave a nod to O'Brien during one of his two acceptance speeches.\n\n\"Like many of us in this room, I was kind of rooting for Conan, so this is bittersweet,\" he said, thanking O'Brien for inspiring comedy writers.\n\n—Samantha Subin\n\nOutstanding Limited or Anthology Series\n\nAnd the winner is...\"The Queen's Gambit\"\n\nRich Fury | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images\n\nAlso nominated:\n\n\"I May Destroy You\"\n\n\"Mare of Easttown\"\n\n\"The Underground Railroad\"\n\n\"WandaVision\"\n\nOutstanding Drama Series\n\nAnd the winner is...\"The Crown\"\n\nAlso nominated:\n\n\"The Boys\"\n\n\"Bridgerton\"\n\n\"The Handmaid's Tale\"\n\n\"Lovecraft Country\"\n\n\"The Mandalorian\"\n\n\"Pose\"\n\n\"This Is Us\"\n\nOutstanding Comedy Series\n\nAnd the winner is...\"Ted Lasso\"\n\nRich Fury | Getty Images\n\nAlso nominated:\n\n\"Black-ish\"\n\n\"Cobra Kai\"\n\n\"Emily in Paris\"\n\n\"Hacks\"\n\n\"The Flight Attendant\"\n\n\"The Kominsky Method\"\n\n\"Pen15″\n\nOutstanding Directing for a Variety Series\n\nAnd the winner is...Don Roy King, \"Saturday Night Live\"\n\nAlso nominated:\n\nChristopher Werner, \"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver\"\n\nAlexander J.

Allen also told the showrunners to shut the clock off so she could speak -- to which laughter erupted in the crowd.\n\nShe gave a nod to women in Texas and Afghanistan, and called on women worldwide to let the \"moment resonate.\"\n\n\"It is time for you to claim your power, claim your voice, say your song, tell your stories,\" she said.\n\n—Samantha Subin\n\nOutstanding Lead Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie\n\nAnd the winner is...Kate Winslet, \"Mare of Easttown\"\n\nRich Fury | Getty Images\n\nAlso nominated:\n\nMichaela Coel, \"I May Destroy You\"\n\nCynthia Erivo, \"Genius: Aretha\"\n\nElizabeth Olsen, \"WandaVision\"\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy, \"The Queen's Gambit\"\n\nRuPaul breaks record for the most Emmy wins by a person of color with 11\n\nJay L. Clendenin | Los Angeles Times | Getty Images\n\nRuPaul made history on Sunday, winning his 11th Emmy award, the most wins by a person of color. The record was previously held by cinematographer Donald A. Morgan.\n\n\"RuPaul's Drag Race\" took home the prize for outstanding competition program. It is the most-awarded reality competition show at the Emmys.\n\nThe Television Academy's chairman and CEO Frank Scherma celebrated the growth in diverse representation on TV during Sunday's telecast.\n\n\"It's so great to see that television and the stories that we tell are finally becoming a reflection of every part of our society,\" he said before announcing the recipient of the Governors Award.\n\n\"Voices of Black, Latinx, Asian American and Indigenous creators, along with the LGBTQIA+, neurodiverse and disabled communities are being heard by larger audiences than ever before,\" Scherma continued. \"These stories touch all of us as part of our shared human experience.\"\n\n—Sarah Whitten\n\nOutstanding Writing for a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie\n\nAnd the winner is...Michaela Coel, \"I May Destroy You\"\n\nAlso nominated:\n\nBrad Ingelsby, \"Mare of Easttown\"\n\nScott Frank, \"The Queen's Gambit\"\n\nChuck Hayward, Peter Cameron, \"WandaVision\"\n\nJac Schaeffer, \"WandaVision\"\n\nLaura Donney, \"WandaVision\"\n\nOutstanding Directing for a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie\n\nAnd the winner is...Scott Frank, \"The Queen's Gambit\"\n\nAlso nominated:\n\nThomas Kail, \"Hamilton\"\n\nSam Miller, Michaela Coel, \"I May Destroy You\"\n\nSam Miller, \"I May Destroy You\"\n\nCraig Zobel, \"Mare of Easttown\"\n\nBarry Jenkins, \"The Underground Railroad\"\n\nMatt Shakman, \"Wanda Vision\"\n\nOutstanding Competition Program\n\nAnd the winner is...\"RuPaul's Drag Race\"\n\nAlso nominated:\n\n\"The Amazing Race\"\n\n\"Nailed It!\"\n\n\"Top Chef\"\n\n\"The Voice\"\n\nOutstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series\n\nAnd the winner is...Jason Sudeikis, \"Ted Lasso\"\n\nRich Fury | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images\n\nAlso nominated:\n\nAnthony Anderson, \"Black-ish\"\n\nMichael Douglas, \"The Kominsky Method\"\n\nWilliam H.

Lorne Michaels also gave a nod to Macdonald after \"Saturday Night Live\" won for outstanding variety sketch series, who he called \"one of the best we ever had.\"\n\n\"No one was funnier in the last 20 years than Norm Macdonald on late-night comedy,\" Oliver said.\n\nOliver also gave a shout out to Conan O'Brien, who also was nominated for variety talk series.

Maxx .\n\nCedric also drew attention to black representation in the nominations, pointing out his friend Anthony Anderson, who received his seventh nomination for outstanding lead actor in a comedy series.

They said this was outdoors. It's not.\"\n\nThe Television Academy swapped venues due to the coronavirus and is being held at L.A. Live's Event deck, a space that offers indoor and outdoor locations for the production. The event is quite a bit smaller than previous years, with only around 500 guests attending the ceremony in Los Angeles, compared with several thousand in previous years.\n\nThe Academy tested all participants and required vaccinations for all attendees.\n\n\"They lied to us,\" Rogen joked. \"We are in a hermetically sealed tent right now. I would not have come to this. Why is there a roof? It's more important that we have three chandeliers than that we make sure we don't kill Eugene Levy tonight. That is what has been decided.\"\n\n—Sarah Whitten\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie\n\nAnd the winner is...Julianne Nicholson, \"Mare of Easttown\"\n\nRich Fury | Getty Images\n\nAlso nominated:\n\nPhillipa Soo, \"Hamilton\"\n\nRenee Elise Goldsberry, \"Hamilton\"\n\nJean Smart, \"Mare of Easttown\"\n\nMoses Ingram, \"The Queen's Gambit\"\n\nKathryn Hahn, \"WandaVision\"\n\nA bid to boost Emmys ratings after last year's low\n\nIn the last decade, Hollywood's top award shows have faced declining viewership.\n\nSo, are people becoming bored with big award ceremonies or are they just watching them differently?\n\nSome argue that the inundation of too many live award show ceremonies has saturated the market and made top-tier award shows like the Grammys, Emmys and Oscars less exciting to viewers.\n\nNot to mention, younger viewers, many of whom have cut cable, aren't as willing to sit through the traditional 16 to 20 minutes of commercials per hour that comes with a live TV telecast. Nielsen data doesn't include figures for viewers who opted to watch any of the major award shows on streaming platforms.\n\nThen there are also some who bemoan Hollywood, in particular, for using its award ceremonies to make political and social statements.\n\nLast April's Oscars ceremony was watched by the smallest audience the award show has ever received.\n\nAnd the same thing happened at last year's Emmy Awards. The show drew only 5.1 million total viewers, down 14% from last year's event, according to Nielsen.\n\n— Sarah Whitten\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series\n\nAnd the winner is...Brett Goldstein, \"Ted Lasso\"\n\nMatt Winkelmeyer | Getty Images\n\nAlso nominated:\n\nCarl Clemons-Hopkins, \"Hacks\"\n\nKenan Thompson, \"SNL\"\n\nBowen Yang, \"SNL\"\n\nBrendan Hunt, \"Ted Lasso\"\n\nNick Mohammed, \"Ted Lasso\"\n\nJeremy Swift, \"Ted Lasso\"\n\nPaul Reiser, \"The Kominsky Method\"\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series\n\nAnd the winner is...Hannah Waddingham, \"Ted Lasso\"\n\nMatt Winkelmeyer | Getty Images\n\nAlso nominated:\n\nHannah Einbinder, \"Hacks\"\n\nAidy Bryant, \"SNL\"\n\nKate McKinnon, \"SNL\"\n\nCecily Strong, \"SNL\"\n\nJuno Temple, \"Ted Lasso\"\n\nRosie Perez, \"The Flight Attendant\"\n\nElizabeth Olsen's red carpet look designed by older sisters Mary-Kate and Ashley\n\nElizabeth Olsen, who is nominated for her role as Wanda Maximoff in the Disney + series \"WandaVision,\" donned a white look on the Emmys' red carpet Sunday that was designed by her older sisters Mary-Kate and Ashley.\n\nThe twin actors launched their luxury fashion label called The Row in 2006.\n\nRich Fury | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images\n\n\"WandaVision\" was nominated for 23 Emmy awards across the Creative Arts and Primetime ceremonies. The Marvel show took home three wins during the Creative Arts Emmys last weekend including outstanding production design for a half-hour narrative program, outstanding fantasy/sci-fi costumes and best original music and lyrics for \"Agatha All Along.\"\n\nOlsen's co-star Paul Bettany is nominated for outstanding lead actor in a limited or anthology series or movie for his turn as Vision, while Kathryn Hahn is nominated for outstanding supporting actress for her portrayal of Agnes aka villain Agatha Harkness.\n\n—Sarah Whitten\n\nThe strange case of 'Hamilton' at the Emmys\n\nThere is no doubt that \"Hamilton,\" a Tony Award-winning spectacle, is a masterpiece. However, many were confused when the filmed production nabbed 12 Emmy nominations in July.\n\nDisney+, which streamed \"Hamilton,\" was permitted to categorize the project as a prerecorded variety special, which it did for the technical Emmy categories. However, because there is no longer a variety performer category, the Television Academy allowed Disney to submit its actors and actresses under the TV movie umbrella.\n\n\"Hamilton\" ultimately secured seven different acting nominations across the lead and supporting categories.\n\n—Sarah Whitten\n\nCedric the Entertainer faces declining Emmy viewership\n\nRich Fury | Getty Images\n\nCedric the Entertainer has been enlisted as this year's Emmy Awards' host. The stand-up comedian, who stars on \"The Neighborhood\" on CBS, has his work cut out for him.\n\nFor years, the award show has seen declining viewership, and this year's event, while in-person, boasts a pared back audience. The Television Academy plans to serve food and drink, and integrate musical performances, but attendees will sit at tables instead of typical rows.\n\n\"We want to do two things at once, make sure we have a safe environment for everyone who was attending the show, but also, let's get out of the kind of typical theater situation,\" executive producer Reggie Hudlin told Variety.\n\nCedric plans to take a laid back approach to the show. He recently told The New York Times he doesn't want the \"Oscars feel.\"\n\n—Samantha Subin\n\n75% of the nominees for best comedy are new to the category\n\nRich Fury | Getty Images\n\nThe Primetime Emmy Awards will feature 26 categories, including acting and writing and awards for comedies, dramas and talk shows. Shows are eligible for this year's ceremony if they were released between June 1, 2020 and May 31, 2021.\n\nAmong the closely watched categories will be the outstanding comedy, where a whopping 75% of the nominees are new to the category. The shows include \"Cobra Kai,\" \"Emily in Paris,\" \"Hacks,\" \"Pen15,\" \"Ted Lasso\" and \"The Flight Attendant.\"\n\nAdditionally, there were 44 first-time performer nominations across the lead, supporting, guest and short form categories. Among them is Bowen Yang, pictured here, who is nominated for best supporting actor in a comedy series. Yang's nomination is the first time a \"Saturday Night Live\" featured player was nominated for an Emmy.\n\n\"Television has provided a lifeline for so many around the globe this year, delivering a constant source of entertainment, information and inspiration during some of our most difficult days,\" said Frank Scherma, the academy's chairman and CEO when the nominations were announced in July.\n\n\"We are thrilled to honor the diversity of storytelling in television today by recognizing talented artists, programs, producers, directors and craftspeople throughout our industry and celebrating their commitment to this extraordinary medium.\"\n\n—Sarah Whitten\n\nNetflix dominated the Creative Arts Emmys with 34 wins\n\nFueled by \"The Queen's Gambit\" and \"The Crown,\" Netflix garnered 34 wins at the Creative Arts Emmy Awards last weekend.\n\nThe Creative Arts Emmy Awards are given out to behind-the-scenes personnel like production designers, video editors, cinematographers, casting directors and set decorators and are given out ahead of the primetime ceremony.\n\nDisney+ took home the second-most awards with 13 and HBO and HBO Max tallied 10.\n\nNetflix's \"The Queen's Gambit\" tallied nine wins while Disney+'s \"The Mandalorian\" and NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\" scored seven a piece.\n\nDisclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC. NBCUniversal owns NBC.\n\n—Sarah Whitten\n\nHow the Television Academy plans to pull off a socially distanced Emmys ceremony\n\nWith the coronavirus pandemic still raging, the Emmy Awards will once again break with tradition.\n\nSince 2008, the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles has been the go-to venue for the annual television awards, but this year the ceremony will take place at L.A. Live's Event Deck, a space that offers indoor and outdoor locations for the production.\n\nThis year's red carpet will be smaller than previous years with only around 500 guests attending the ceremony in Los Angeles, compared with several thousand in previous years.\n\nThe show will also feature several satellite events that the telecast will cut to when necessary. The cast and producers of the Netflix show \"The Crown\" are holding their own Emmy ceremony in London, much like the team behind \"Schitt's Creek\" did during last year's telecast. Other shows that will be video conferencing into the ceremony include \" Top Chef\" and \"Jimmy Kimmel Live.\"\n\nAttendees will follow strict Covid-19 protocols throughout the ceremony that mimic safety measures put in place on Hollywood sets. This includes testing all participants, requiring vaccinations and ensuring that everyone is wearing a mask when they are not on camera.\n\nThese mandates are similar to ones instituted at previous awards ceremonies in the last year.\n\n—Sarah Whitten\n\nHow to watch the 2021 Emmy Awards without cable\n\nThe 73rd Emmy Awards are set to kick off Sunday at 8 p.m. ET on CBS.\n\nFor those that wish to tune into the annual awards show, but don't have cable, there are plenty of options.\n\nThe ceremony will be available to stream on:\n\nHulu with Live TV\n\nYouTube TV\n\nAT&T TV\n\nFubo TV\n\nParamount+\n\n—Sarah Whitten"
