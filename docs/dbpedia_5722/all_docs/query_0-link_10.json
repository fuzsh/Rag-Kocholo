        "text": "UPDATE (June 4): Kelly Clarkson is set to present at the Daytime Emmy Awards on Friday, June 7, which means she will be on hand in the event she wins one or more awards for the fourth year in a row. The versatile performer did not attend last year’s Daytime Emmys, where she was a double winner.\n\nZooey Deschanel, star of What Am I Eating With Zooey Deschanel, and Jonathan Scott, star of Backed by the Bros., are also set to present. The daytime TV stars announced their engagement last August.\n\nOther presenters include Kristos Andrews, Lidia Bastianich, Lauralee Bell, Eric Braeden, Steve Burton, Derrick Campana, Kelly Clarkson, Stefan Dennis, Scott Evans, Jackée Harry, Amelia Heinle, Annie Jones, Star Jones, Christel Khalil, Jacqueline MacInnes Wood, Eric Martsolf, Kiara Liz Ortega, Danielle Pinnock, Melvin Robert, Lawrence Saint-Victor, Laura Wright, and Dr. Rae Wynn-Grant. In addition, The Talk hosts Amanda Kloots and Jerry O’Connell will make a special appearance.\n\nAs previously announced, Melody Thomas Scott and Edward J. Scott will receive lifetime achievement honors for their contributions to the world of daytime television.\n\nUPDATE (May 23): Entertainment Tonight’s Kevin Frazier and Nischelle Turner will return as hosts for the 2024 Daytime Emmy Awards, airing live on the East Coast on Friday, June 7 (8-10 p.m. ET/PT) on CBS. The two-hour show will also be available to stream live and on-demand on Paramount+.\n\nThis year marks the 18th time CBS has broadcast the Daytime Emmys, more than any other network. The show will broadcast live from the Westin Bonaventure Hotel in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nFrazier and Turner are nominated this year in the outstanding daytime personality – daily category, in addition to ET being nominated for outstanding entertainment news series. Frazier was named co-host of ET in September 2014, coinciding with the beginning of the show’s 34th season. Turner joined the show as a correspondent in 2014 and was named co-host in 2021.\n\nPREVIOUSLY (April 19): The nominations for the 2024 Daytime Emmys were announced on Friday (April 19). The Kelly Clarkson Show is out to defend its title as outstanding daytime talk series against four challengers – The Jennifer Hudson Show (which was also nominated in the category last year), Tamron Hall, The View and Turning the Tables with Robin Roberts.\n\nKelly Clarkson is also defending her title as outstanding daytime talk series host. Clarkson is squaring off against Tamron Hall (who was also nominated in the category last year), the hosts of The View and The Talk, and Mark Consuelos and Kelly Ripa from Live with Kelly and Mark. Ripa was nominated in this category last year with her former co-host, Ryan Seacrest. Consuelos, to whom Ripa is married, took Seacrest’s place on the show when the Busiest Man in Show Business decided to be just a little less busy. Jennifer Hudson and Robin Roberts weren’t nominated in this category this year.\n\nClarkson has won seven Daytime Emmys over the first four seasons of her popular talk show. Hudson has yet to win a Daytime Emmy for her talk show, though she did win one in 2021 for outstanding interactive media for a daytime program for Baba Yaga – on her way to becoming an EGOT.\n\nDrew Barrymore, who was nominated for both outstanding daytime talk series and outstanding daytime talk series host last year with The Drew Barrymore Show, wasn’t nominated in either category this year.\n\nSelena + Chef: Home for the Holidays (Food Network), hosted by Selena Gomez, is nominated for outstanding culinary series. It is competing with series headlined by such celebs as Ina Garten, Valerie Bertinelli and Zooey Deschanel.\n\nTV legend Dick Van Dyke, 98, is nominated for guest performance in a daytime drama series for his appearance on Days of our Lives on Peacock.\n\nIf it doesn’t seem like a full year has gone by since the last Daytime Emmys, you’re on to something. The 2023 Daytime Emmys were held on Dec. 15. They had been delayed six full months because of last year’s strikes by the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA.\n\nThe 51st Daytime Emmy Awards telecast will be presented live on Friday, June 7, at 8 p.m. ET (delayed PT) on CBS, and will available to stream live and on-demand on Paramount+. This will mark the 18th time CBS has broadcast the Daytime Emmys, which is more than any other network.\n\nThe Daytime Creative Arts & Lifestyle Emmy Awards will be presented the following night. It will stream live at 9 p.m. ET/6 p.m. PT on Saturday, June 8, at watch.TheEmmys.tv and via The Emmys apps for iOS, tvOS, Android, FireTV, and Roku.\n\nBoth ceremonies will take place at the Westin Bonaventure Los Angeles. Ticket sales will begin Wednesday, May 1. Lifetime achievement honorees, hosts, presenters, and silver and gold circle honorees will be announced at a later date.\n\nThe 51st Annual Daytime Emmy Awards is produced by NATAS and Associated Television International (ATI). Adam Sharp and Lisa Armstrong are executive producers from NATAS, while David McKenzie is executive producer from ATI.\n\nThe Daytime Emmy Awards have recognized outstanding achievement in television programming and crafts since 1974. In 2021, The National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (NATAS) and the Television Academy jointly announced plans to realign the Daytime and Primetime Emmy Awards to be organized by content genre, as opposed to program airtime.\n\nHere are the 2024 Daytime Emmy nominations in selected categories.
