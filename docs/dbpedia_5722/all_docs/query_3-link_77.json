        "text": "Wanna feel old? The 75th Primetime Emmy Awards are coming this September. Yes, the television industry’s premier honor is three-quarters of the way to the century mark. And to celebrate, the Television Academy revealed key art for the 2023 ceremony that includes a “75” in the Emmy logo to commemorate the occasion. Oh, and FOX, which is broadcasting this year’s ceremony announced the telecast will take place on Monday, September 18.\n\nREAD MORE: “Avatar: The Way of Water,” “Severance” and “The White Lotus” make AFI’s top 10 lists of 2022\n\nThis is the second year in a row the Emmys will take place on a Monday. FOX is pushing the Emmys off Sunday to protect its lucrative NFL game schedule which would be affected by a live ceremony beginning at 5 PM Pacific Time. Last year, NBC broadcast the 2022 Emmys on Monday, September 12 and it earned the lowest recorded ratings ever with just 5.92 million viewers. Almost a third of the viewership of the 2014 ceremony just eight years earlier.\n\nThis year’s date also conveniently avoids serious overlap with the Toronto International Film Festival. Last year’s ceremony was held on the first Monday of TIFF which caused a significant amount of scheduling conflicts for a number of nominees. Moreover, the new date means the Creative Art Emmy ceremonies will likely occur the weekend of Sept. 10-12. The 2023 Creative Arts occurred over Labor Day weekend which infuriated many members and nominees.\n\nIt’s unclear who FOX will select to host this year’s Emmys. The last time the network was responsible for the telecast it went host-less (a trend for all award shows at the time). In 2015, Andy Samberg, then the star of the network’s hit comedy series “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” emceed the event. Last year’s host was “Saturday Night Live’s” Kenan Thompson. A note to anyone at the Television Academy and FOX reading this, but a woman hasn’t hosted in any capacity since Jane Lynch in 2011 (also, coincidentally, a FOX year)."
