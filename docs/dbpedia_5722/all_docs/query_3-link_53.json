        "text": "The Times was honored with five News and Documentary Emmys this week, a recognition of the courageous and innovative work produced across News and Opinion.\n\n“How a U.S. Drone Strike Killed the Wrong Person” won two Emmys, one in the Outstanding Investigative News Coverage: Short Form category and the Best News Coverage: Short Form category. Using never-before-seen security camera footage, The Visual Investigations team was the first to dispute the military version of a U.S. drone strike against what it claimed was an ISIS suicide bomber. The team proved that the United States instead killed an innocent Afghan civilian and nine of his family members. This group of dogged journalists verified the footage with eyewitness accounts and satellite images to create a highly detailed and damning account of the day’s events. The video unit’s coverage forced the Pentagon to apologize — and cleared the family’s name.\n\n“The team worked relentlessly and quickly to zero-in on and assemble the visual evidence that dismantled the U.S. military’s version of events, even in the face of continuous pushback from the Pentagon,” said Mark Scheffler, editor of Visual Investigations. “In the wake of our story, officials admitted they had made a ‘catastrophic mistake.’ Setting the record straight is a true hallmark of this team, and this award is a great testament to their pursuit of accountability.”\n\nOpinion Video had two winners in the Outstanding News Analysis: Editorial and Opinion category: “Blue States, You’re the Problem,” which explored why states with Democratic majorities had hard-to-find affordable housing, acute disparities in education funding and increasing economic inequality; and “Greta Thunberg Has Given Up on Politicians,” featuring a call to action from Ms. Thunberg on climate change.\n\n“Moments like these cause me to pause and admire the talented journalists I work with in Opinion,” said Kathleen Kingsbury, Opinion editor. “These awards recognize the incredible efforts of the video team and their tireless push to publish compelling visual stories with a strong point of view. I’m so proud of them.”\n\nThe Times’s first nomination in the Outstanding Live Interview category led to a win, with honors for the DealBook Summit: One-on-One With Adam Neumann, in which Andrew Ross Sorkin spoke with Mr. Neumann, a founder of WeWork, in his first public interview since leaving the company.\n\n“The New York Times Presents,” a series of standalone documentary films that appears on FX and Hulu, received an Emmy for Outstanding Arts, Culture or Entertainment coverage for “Malfunction: The Dressing Down of Janet Jackson.” The film examined the racial and cultural currents that collided on the Super Bowl stage in 2004 when her breast was exposed, and explored how the incident impacted one of the most successful pop musicians in history.\n\n“This is a great tribute to the directing of Jodi Gomes, and reporting rigor of Rachel Abrams and Alan Light,” said Jason Stallman, executive producer of “The New York Times Presents.”\n\nAnd “Boeing’s Fatal Flaw,” an investigation by The Times and “Frontline,” won for Outstanding Business, Consumer or Economic Coverage. It looked at the commercial pressures, flawed design and failed oversight behind Boeing’s 737 Max jet and the crashes that killed 346 people."
