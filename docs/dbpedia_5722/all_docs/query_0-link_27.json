        "text": "The final season of Succession and the first season of The Bear dominated Monday night’s strike-postponed 75th Emmy Awards in Los Angeles, earning six wins each and dominating their categories.\n\nTed Lasso and The Crown ended the night without a single win, while Elton John completed the EGOT, becoming part of a select club of entertainers to win the Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony in their career.\n\nSeason 4 of HBO’s Succession won best drama series for the third time after last weekend’s Golden Globes triumph.\n\nThere were dramatic lead acting honours for Kieran Culkin and Sarah Snook and supporting dramatic actor Matthew Macfadyen (all three won Globes), as well as writing and directing recognition for showrunner Jesse Armstrong and Mark Mylod.\n\nFX show The Bear won best comedy after its Globe win, as well as lead comedy actor for Jeremy Allen White, supporting comedy acting honours for Ayo Edebidi and Ebon Moss-Bachrach, and writing and directing for Christopher Storer. Allen White and Edebidi also won Globes.\n\nMonday’s success for The Bear is the stuff of trivia night quizzes: the show was originally scheduled for September 18, 2023, and the qualifying period for submissions ran from June 30, 2022, to May 31, 2023. Four months after the twin Hollywood strikes forced Emmys organisers to postpone the ceremony to January 15, the show just won honours for its first season one week after it took three Golden Globes for the second.\n\nQuinta Brunson won lead comedy actress for ABC’s Abbott Elementary and Jennifer Coolidge took home her second consecutive supporting comedy actress award for HBO’s The White Lotus.\n\nNetflix’s Beef won five, taking best limited or anthology series or movie, lead acting awards for Steven Yeun and Ali Wong, and directing and writing prizes for Lee Sung Jin.\n\nSuccession started the night on a field-leading 27 nominations.\n\nThe 75th Emmy Awards took place at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles, hosted by Anthony Anderson.\n\nElton John won in the Outstanding Variety Special (Live) category for his 2022 Disney+ special Elton John Live: Farewell from Dodger Stadium.\n\nJohn has won two Oscars for best original song for Rocketman’s ‘[I’m Gonna] Love Me Again’ and The Lion King’s ‘Can You Feel The Love Tonight’, a Tony Award for best original score for Aida, and six Grammys.\n\nDrama, comedy nominees and winners\n\nWinners in bold.
