Nominations were announced July 22, 2002.[1] The ceremony was hosted by Conan O'Brien[2] and was broadcast on NBC. Two networks, FX and VH1, received their first major nominations this year. The program America: A Tribute to Heroes was simulcast on every major network and, therefore, is not designated with one below.\n\nAfter four nominations during its first seven seasons, Friends won Outstanding Comedy Series without a directing or a writing nomination. Everybody Loves Raymond led all comedies with nine major nominations and three major wins. Meanwhile, after eight consecutive nominations (including five consecutive wins for its first five seasons), Frasier was excluded from the Outstanding Comedy Series nomination for the first time. It would not be nominated for its final two seasons either.\n\nFor the third straight year, the drama field was conquered by The West Wing. In addition to winning its third consecutive trophy for Outstanding Drama Series, The West Wing achieved a milestone when it became the third series (all dramas) to gain nine acting nominations for its main cast members. This tied the mark set by Hill Street Blues in 1982 and later matched by L.A. Law in 1989. Game of Thrones would also match this in 2019. The West Wing also set a record with twelve total acting nominations when including the guest category, a category that existed for L.A. Law, but was not available for Hill Street Blues during its second season (1981–82) of nine acting nominations. Overall, The West Wing led all series in major nominations and wins with thirteen and four.\n\nIn addition, Stockard Channing joined an exclusive club of actors that have won two awards in one ceremony for different roles. Furthermore, Michael Chiklis became the second actor in a cable network series to win for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series (after James Gandolfini for The Sopranos in 2000 and 2001) for his performance as Vic Mackey in The Shield whilst becoming FX's first ever acting win.\n\nWhen Band of Brothers won Outstanding Miniseries, the audience gave a standing ovation to the miniseries' subjects: the soldiers of \"Easy\" Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division, as their surviving members were shown both in the auditorium and on the broadcast at the Los Angeles St. Regis Hotel. Co-creator and executive producer Steven Spielberg then invited Major Richard \"Dick\" Winters, their D-Day commanding officer who was played by Damian Lewis in the miniseries and attended the ceremony live, to speak.[3]\n\nWinners and nominees\n\n[edit]\n\nWinners are listed first and highlighted in bold:[4]\n\nPrograms\n\n[edit]\n\nPrograms\n\nFriends (NBC)\n\nCurb Your Enthusiasm (HBO)\n\nEverybody Loves Raymond (CBS)\n\nSex and the City (HBO)\n\nWill & Grace (NBC)\n\nThe West Wing (NBC)\n\n24 (Fox)\n\nCSI: Crime Scene Investigation (CBS)\n\nLaw & Order (NBC)\n\nSix Feet Under (HBO)\n\nLate Show with David Letterman (CBS)\n\nThe Daily Show with Jon Stewart (Comedy Central)\n\nPolitically Incorrect with Bill Maher (ABC)\n\nSaturday Night Live (NBC)\n\nThe Tonight Show with Jay Leno (NBC)\n\nAmerica: A Tribute to Heroes\n\n2002 Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony (NBC)\n\n74th Annual Academy Awards (ABC)\n\nCarol Burnett: Show Stoppers (CBS)\n\nCirque du Soleil: Alegria (Bravo)\n\nThe Concert for New York City (VH1)\n\nThe Gathering Storm (HBO)\n\nDinner with Friends (HBO)\n\nJames Dean (TNT)\n\nThe Laramie Project (HBO)\n\nPath to War (HBO)\n\nBand of Brothers (HBO)\n\nDinotopia (ABC)\n\nThe Mists of Avalon (TNT)\n\nShackleton (A&E)\n\nActing\n\n[edit]\n\nLead performances\n\n[edit]\n\nLead performances\n\nRay Romano – Everybody Loves Raymond as Ray Barone (CBS) (Episode: “The Breakup Tape”)\n\nKelsey Grammer – Frasier as Dr. Frasier Crane (NBC)\n\nMatt LeBlanc – Friends as Joey Tribbiani (NBC)\n\nBernie Mac – The Bernie Mac Show as Bernie McCullough (Fox)\n\nMatthew Perry – Friends as Chandler Bing (NBC)\n\nJennifer Aniston – Friends as Rachel Green (NBC)\n\nPatricia Heaton – Everybody Loves Raymond as Debra Barone (CBS) (Episode: “A Vote For Debra”)\n\nJane Kaczmarek – Malcolm in the Middle as Lois (Fox) (Episode: “Poker”)\n\nDebra Messing – Will & Grace as Grace Adler (NBC)\n\nSarah Jessica Parker – Sex and the City as Carrie Bradshaw (HBO)\n\nMichael Chiklis – The Shield as Vic Mackey (FX)\n\nMichael C.
