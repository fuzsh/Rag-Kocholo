        "text": "YOUNGSTOWN — U.S. Rep. Bill Johnson said he’s concentrating on developing strategies as the incoming president of Youngstown State University and not on the large amount of criticism over the controversial decision to hire him.\n\n“Quite honestly, I’m more focused on what I’m going to be doing at YSU than I am with the people that don’t like the decision,” Johnson, R-Marietta, said. “I’m not spending a lot of time worrying about that. I said I was going to have a listening ear, and I’ve spent a lot of time since the (Nov. 21 hiring) decision was made listening to a lot of groups on campus. I’m going to continue that effort.”\n\nThe outcry from faculty, staff, students, alumni and major donors against hiring Johnson has been heavy. Several donors have criticized the decision and are urging the YSU board of trustees to rescind the three-year contract with Johnson that’s already been signed. The objections have come because Johnson is a seven-term conservative congressman with no higher education experience.\n\nJohnson is to start March 15.\n\n“I expected there to be naysayers,” he said. “I don’t have a problem with that. I just wish they’d sit down and have a conversation with me.”\n\nJohnson said he hopes donors didn’t just give to YSU “because of an individual that happens to work there. I hope they change their minds, and I do hope that over time that they see I’m more than capable of leading a diverse organization, an institution like Youngstown State. I’m hoping that I’ll win many of them over. For those that don’t, I’m not going to look behind. I’m going to look ahead.”\n\nHe said there is “absolutely” nothing that will change his mind about taking the job.\n\n“I signed the contract,” Johnson said. “I’m going to be the president of Youngstown State University, and my intentions are to do exactly what I intend to do. I’m going to give 200% of my time and energy to making Youngstown State University the anchor university in northeast Ohio. I don’t have a quit bone. I wasn’t born with one of those.”\n\nBEST FOR YSU\n\nJohnson said his hiring is what’s best for YSU.\n\n“Absolutely or else I wouldn’t be taking the job,” he said.\n\nYSU trustees hired Johnson on an 8-1 vote Nov. 21 with Molly Seals being the lone “no” vote. This came after the trustees quickly called a Nov. 16 emergency meeting to vote to offer Johnson a contract to succeed Jim Tressel, who retired Feb. 1.\n\nThe process has faced much criticism as it was the first confidential search held by the university to hire a president. Requests for names and other information regarding those who applied have been denied by the university with officials saying those doesn’t exist.\n\nThe trustees refused to permit public comment at its Nov. 21 meeting but will allow it at its Thursday meeting.\n\nJohnson, who spent two days late last week on campus while skipping congressional votes, said he won’t attend the Thursday meeting because “I still have work to complete at the U.S. House.”\n\nDuring a Nov. 21 news conference after he was hired, Johnson said parents are reluctant to send their children to college because “they want to know they’re going to be educated, not indoctrinated.”\n\nJohnson also has been critical in the past about higher education’s “huge administrative overhead and salaries” and at times banning “conservatives for speaking on taxpayer-funded campuses.”\n\nThe “indoctrination” concern, Johnson said, is part of the reason universities have experienced enrollment declines. He said he didn’t know if that was occurring at YSU.\n\n“To educate students, we teach them how to think and not what to think,” Johnson said. “What to think is indoctrination.”\n\nACADEMIC INVOLVEMENT\n\nJohnson said, like every university president, he will be involved in YSU’s academic programs.\n\n“I’ll work in collaboration with the provost and the board of trustees,” he said.\n\nJohnson will become the highest-paid president in YSU history making a base annual salary of $410,000 under his three-year deal with numerous perks.\n\nAsked how long he wants to serve as YSU president, Johnson, 69, said: “I don’t even know what retirement looks like. I’ve got a lot left to go. Don’t look for me to hang out a retirement shingle any time soon. I’m not a job hopper. I don’t know how long I will be there, but my history will tell you I come in and do the work and stay until the work is done.”\n\nJohnson said he doesn’t “have targets in mind or positions I’m going to cut. Part of a president’s responsibility is to manage the fiscal health with the board of trustees. Every university has that concern and the skyrocketing costs of higher education is not a surprise to anyone.”\n\nJohnson said he plans to “cast a wider net” to stop YSU’s declining enrollment to the Mahoning Valley, the region, the state, the nation and to attract more international students.\n\n“How we’re going to do that is a work in progress,” he said. “I haven’t gotten to the job yet, but I’m putting together my thoughts on how we can do that.”\n\nWith more high school students moving to trades, Johnson wants to work with local trade organizations to promote YSU’s certificate program that allows students to get certified in a trade while earning college credits.\n\n“It doesn’t have to be a four-year degree,” he said.\n\nJOHNSON’S\n\nSTANCES\n\nJohnson has received criticism for his positions on a number of issues including those against abortions and gay marriages, and for questioning the 2020 presidential election results.\n\nOn Friday, Johnson said he is not an “election denier” and recognizes Democrat Joe Biden as the president, but still maintains there were irregularities committed in Pennsylvania by its secretary of state.\n\nJohnson said he has the right to his opinions, but he wants to continue to make YSU a place of inclusion.\n\nJohnson already has endorsed Donald Trump for president next year. While Johnson didn’t answer when asked if he would rescind the endorsement, he vowed not to campaign for any political candidates in 2024.\n\nJohnson plans to resign from Congress in February or early March with the YSU presidency starting March 15.\n\nThat would leave the 6th Congressional District without representation in the U.S. House for several months until a special election could be held with August expected to be the earliest time for it.\n\nBut Johnson said his staff will remain in place and handle constituent services after he leaves office.\n\nAs for the more than $1.3 million Johnson has in his campaign fund, he said, “I’ve got to get with the clerk of the House to see legally what I can and cannot do. The extent I can use that to help Youngstown State and the Mahoning Valley and the region (I’ll do), but I have political expenses to wrap up.”"
