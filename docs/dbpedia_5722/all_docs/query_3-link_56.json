Moving forward, the competitions will be organized solely by content genre as opposed to the current method, which separates programs based on program airtime.\n\nThe announcement, which follows the Academies’ recent collaboration on expanding the Children’s & Family Emmy Awards into a standalone franchise, represents a transition that allows the competitions to reflect consumers’ evolving viewing habits, reduce category overlap, and provide clarity on eligibility requirements.\n\n“NATAS and the Television Academy each pride ourselves on celebrating and honoring the best television has to offer, and with the evolution of our industry, it was critical to update our competitions to meet current trends in both content and viewing habits,” said Adam Sharp, President and CEO, NATAS. “These changes will allow each Academy to honor an undivided scope of achievement in our respective fields of television excellence.”\n\n“The realignment of these Emmy competitions represents the most significant collaboration between the Television Academy and NATAS since the two became separate entities in 1977,” said Maury McIntyre, President and COO, Television Academy. “We’re proud to be responsive to the needs of the creative community and the evolution of our industry, ensuring the Emmy Award remains the preeminent mark of excellence across all genres of television.”\n\nWhile further information by category will be forthcoming in the Daytime Emmys® Call for Entries, scheduled for release in January 2022, notable updates include:\n\nScripted dramas and comedies will enter the Television Academy-administered national competition, irrespective of airtime, with two exceptions which will enter NATAS’ national competitions: (1) Programming intended for ages 15 and under will be represented in the Children’s & Family competition; and (2) the Daytime Drama categories will remain in the Daytime competition and be redefined to include “any multi-camera, weekday daily serial, spin-off or reboot.”\n\nProgramming previously awarded in the Limited Drama categories of the Daytime competition will transition to the Primetime competition.\n\nTalk shows will be awarded in each competition, separated by format and style characteristics reflective of current programming in the daytime or late night space.\n\nThe Morning Show and Spanish-Language Morning Show categories will be retired from the Daytime competition, with such programming eligible instead in the NATAS-administered News & Documentary Emmys or the Daytime competition’s Talk Show categories, depending on show format.\n\nGame Show and Instructional & DIY programming categories will remain divided by airtime for the 2022 competitions, while the Academies look to a genre-based alignment for the 2023 competition year.\n\nAll other categories will be clarified such that content creators will submit to a single competition on the basis of submission genre, irrespective of airtime.\n\nThe Daytime, Primetime, and Children’s & Family judging periods will be spread out on non-conflicting timelines throughout the year to allow adequate time for submissions and judging.\n\nThe Television Academy and NATAS will also form a joint-Academy panel charged with making eligibility determinations between competitions and respective categories. Show producers who are unsure of the competition for which they are eligible or who are petitioning to switch contests will be encouraged to submit to the eligibility review panel prior to submission.\n\nAbout NATAS\n\nThe National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (NATAS) is a service organization dedicated to the advancement of the arts and sciences of television and the promotion of creative leadership for artistic, educational, and technical achievements within the television industry.
