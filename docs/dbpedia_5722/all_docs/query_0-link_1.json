        "text": "Reservation Dogs, The Gilded Age and The Traitors finally made the cut for the top categories, while Shōgun, The Bear and Abbott Elementary lived up to expectations that they would earn nominations for the 76th annual Emmy Awards, which were unveiled Wednesday morning.\n\nCheck out the full nominees list below.\n\nAnnounced this morning from the El Capitan theatre in Hollywood, the nominations also included shout-outs for Netflix’s addictive but controversial limited series Baby Reindeer, along with well-deserved noms for the fourth season of True Detective featuring Jodie Foster. The limited series race, in fact, is shaping up to be an exciting one, with Netflix’s Ripley competing against Reindeer along FX’s Fargo, Apple’s Lessons in Chemistry and HBO’s True Detective: Night Country.\n\nRELATED: Here Are The Actors Who Have Won The Most Emmys: Photo Gallery\n\nLate Night with Seth Meyers also earned a what-took-you-so-long nomination in Talk Series, while Amazon’s Fallout earned attaboys in Drama Series and Best Actor for Walton Goggins. And straight from the Better Late Than Never department, FX’s now-canceled Reservation Dogs earned its first nomination for Best Drama, as did star D’Pharoah Woon-A-Tai for playing Bear Smallhill.\n\nRELATED: Emmy Winners For Best Drama Since 1960: A Photo Gallery\n\nOverall, Shōgun led the nominations with 25, followed by The Bear at 23, Only Murders in the Building at 21 and True Detective: Night Country at 19. Other notable amounts include the 17 for Fallout, 11 for Baby Reindeer and six for The Gilded Age.\n\nRELATED: Emmy Winners For Best Comedy Since 1952\n\nDEADLINE RELATED VIDEO:\n\nRELATED: Deadline Launches Contenders Television Streaming Site\n\nIf it seems like the 75th Emmys just happened, it’s because they pretty much just did. The 2023 ceremony, after being delayed due to the impact of the Hollywood strikes, took place January 15 — right as the film awards season was ramping up. For this year, the Emmys return to their regular September slot: the 2024 Emmys ceremony is September 15 live on ABC. No host for that yet.\n\nRELATED: 76th Emmy Nominations: Deadline’s Full Coverage\n\nRELATED: 2024-25 Awards Season Calendar:Dates For Oscars, Emmys, Grammys, Guilds & More\n\nBelow is the list of nominees in the marquee Emmy categories, followed by the noms by program, the noms by platform and the complete list of 2024 noms.\n\nOutstanding Drama Series\n\nThe Crown\n\nFallout\n\nThe Gilded Age\n\nThe Morning Show\n\nMr. & Mrs. Smith\n\nShōgun\n\nSlow Horses\n\n3 Body Problem\n\nOutstanding Comedy Series\n\nAbbott Elementary\n\nThe Bear\n\nCurb Your Enthusiasm\n\nHacks\n\nOnly Murders in the Building\n\nPalm Royale\n\nReservation Dogs\n\nWhat We Do in the Shadows\n\nOutstanding Limited or Anthology Series\n\nBaby Reindeer\n\nFargo\n\nLessons In Chemistry\n\nRipley\n\nTrue Detective: Night Country\n\nOutstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series\n\nJennifer Aniston\n\nCarrie Coon\n\nMaya Erskine\n\nAnna Sawai\n\nImelda Staunton\n\nReese Witherspoon\n\nOutstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series\n\nIdris Elba\n\nDonald Glover\n\nWalton Goggins\n\nGary Oldman\n\nHiroyuki Sanada\n\nDominic West\n\nOutstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series\n\nQuinta Brunson\n\nAyo Edebiri\n\nSelena Gomez\n\nMaya Rudolph\n\nJean Smart\n\nKristen Wiig\n\nOutstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series\n\nMatt Berry\n\nLarry David\n\nSteve Martin\n\nMartin Short\n\nJeremy Allen White\n\nD’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai\n\nOutstanding Lead Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie\n\nJodie Foster\n\nBrie Larson\n\nJuno Temple\n\nSofia Vergara\n\nNaomi Watts\n\nOutstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie\n\nMatt Bomer\n\nRichard Gadd\n\nJon Hamm\n\nTom Hollander\n\nAndrew Scott\n\nOutstanding Talk Series\n\nThe Daily Show\n\nJimmy Kimmel Live!\n\nLate Night with Seth Meyers\n\nThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert\n\nOutstanding Reality Competition Program\n\nThe Amazing Race\n\nRuPaul’s Drag Race\n\nTop Chef\n\nThe Traitors\n\nThe Voice\n\nHere are the nominees by program and by platform, followed by the complete 2024 nominations list in alphabetical order by category:\n\nNOMINEES BY PROGRAM\n\n(2 or more)\n\nShōgun — 25\n\nThe Bear – 23\n\nOnly Murders in the Building – 21\n\nTrue Detective: Night Country – 19\n\nThe Crown – 18\n\nFallout – 17\n\nSaturday Night Live – 17\n\nHacks – 16\n\nThe Morning Show – 16\n\nMr. & Mrs. Smith – 16\n\nFargo – 15\n\nRipley – 13\n\nBaby Reindeer – 11\n\nPalm Royale – 11\n\nFeud: Capote vs. The Swans – 10\n\nLessons In Chemistry – 10\n\nAbbott Elementary – 9\n\nSlow Horses – 9\n\nJim Henson Idea Man – 8\n\nRuPaul’s Drag Race – 8\n\nWhat We Do In The Shadows – 8\n\nThe Oscars – 7\n\nThe Gilded Age – 6\n\nLast Week Tonight With John Oliver – 6\n\n3 Body Problem – 6\n\nWelcome To Wrexham – 6\n\nAhsoka – 5\n\nThe Amazing Race – 5\n\nBeckham – 5\n\nDancing With The Stars – 5\n\n66th Grammy Awards – 5\n\nThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert -5\n\nPlanet Earth III – 5\n\nSteve!
