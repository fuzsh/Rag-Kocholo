        "text": "Emmy Award, any of the annual presentations made for outstanding achievement in television in the United States. The name Emmy derives from Immy, a nickname for image orthicon, a camera tube used in television. The Emmy Award statuette consists of a winged woman, representing art, holding aloft an electron, representing science.\n\nThe Emmy Awards are made by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. Only members of the academy may vote for the awards, and members vote only within their own disciplineâ€”actors voting for actors, writers for writers, and so on. Categories in which awards are granted include dramatic series, comedy series, special drama, limited series, and variety, music, or comedy. Within each of these categories a best program is chosen; and in most categories the best actor and actress, supporting actor and actress, director, and writer are chosen. Awards are also given for special achievement, creative arts, and technical categories.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nThe Dating Game: Which Came First?\n\nThe National Academy was formed in 1946 and in 1949 presented the first Emmys. In that year six awards were made. Separate ceremonies evolved for news and documentaries in 1973, for daytime programming in 1974, for prime-time programming in 1977, and for sports in 1979."
