I had read many articles that told of the magnificent redwoods, but it was two papers by Robert Whittaker, “Vegetational History of the Pacific Coast States” and the “Central Significance of the Klamath Region and Vegetation of the Siskiyou Mountains, Oregon and California,” that really piqued my interest. The next summer, Dale A. Thornburgh introduced me to the Klamath Mountains and its rare conifers. It has been a treat to get to know these mountain ranges and their vegetation patterns. As a plant ecologist, my interests expanded well beyond conifers, but the question that I invariably ask is “Why does this area look that way?” Answers have come over the years, as I became acquainted with the land and its inhabitants. This book is my answer to why the region looks the way it does. Much of northwest California is far from where most people live. Even from Arcata, it seems as if “everthing” is at least three hours away, but making an extra effort is well worth the trip. To assist the reader to gain a better familiarity with these lands, I have highlighted many specific places in the book, especially in the national and state parks and wilderness areas. They are well worth visiting, as are the many other areas that I discuss. Maps issued by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management provide additional detail. Agency lands are open for you to enjoy, but heed the “No Trespassing” signs posted on private lands, especially in the ranch lands on the North Coast. These parcels may hide marijuana gardens; stay on the roads, and respect owner rights. Northwest California contains a great deal of open land to satisfy your wanderlust. Natural history books typically supply short descriptions of the common plants and animals found in the region, but I am breaking from that tradition. The descriptions would differ little from those in a Natural History of ix\n\nx\n\npreface\n\nCalifornia and the revised edition of Sierra Nevada Natural History. I have listed these and other useful books in the References and Selected Readings section. Plant names follow A Checklist of the Vascular Plants of Northwestern California that James P. Smith and I have been working on for nearly 40 years. The last edition is available at the Humboldt State University Herbarium Web site http://www.humboldt.edu/%7Eherb/. The list includes many recent nomenclatural and taxonomic changes from the current botanical literature, so my scientific names may differ from those in The Jepson Manual. Photographs in the book are mine. Thanks to Sherrie Navarro for the dust jacket photograph. I am especially grateful to R. Jane Cole and James P. Smith for their invaluable help with the drafts of the manuscript and their continuing support throughout the project. I have always appreciated my time with Dale A. Thornburgh and James P. Smith in the field. They have helped me, in their own, very different ways, in better understanding northwest California. I mention my many graduate students who worked on projects in northwest California. They opened my eyes in many ways over the years. They tested our ideas, sometimes with surprising results. It has been a pleasure to work with so many talented people over the years. The advice of friends and colleagues has greatly improved the book: John Bair (Trinity River restoration), Ronald A. Fritzsche (fish), Erik S. Jules (ecological history), Todd Keeler-Wolf, Timothy E. Lawlor (mammals), John Longshore (geology), Sharyn B. Marks (amphibians and reptiles), Paul F. Springer (birds), John D. Stuart (fire ecology), Dale A. Thornburgh (forest issues), and the staff of the University of California Press, especially Doris Kretschmer for helping launch the undertaking, Scott Norton for suggesting major improvements, and C. R. Crumly for seeing it to completion.\n\nPrologue The Green Prison\n\nJedediah Strong Smith was one of the famous mountain men who traveled the west in search of beaver in the decades before the California gold rush. In 1826, he reached the Mexican province that was to become California, and two years later, he traveled through northwest California on his second expedition. While in the Sacramento Valley, he and his party of 20 men and 300 horses and mules turned west off the Great Indian Trail near Red Bluff and headed for an inviting gap in the mountains. He reasoned that the mountains to the west held the river that would take them to Trinidad Bay. From there he planned to follow the coast north to the Columbia River. Trinidad Bay was a prominent feature on maps of Smith’s day, based on the landings of Bruno Heceta and Juan Francisco Bodega y Cadra in 1775. Jedediah Smith knew that trappers of the Hudson’s Bay Company were finding beaver and other furbearers in Oregon in the early 1800s. Would northwest California be next? Indeed, trappers entered the upper Klamath River watershed in 1826. The next year François Peyette led a small band of trappers downstream to the Yurok village of wecpes (Weitchpec), which will play an important role in the coming gold rush years. After leaving the Great Indian Trail, the Smith party left the deep grasslands of the Sacramento Valley and entered the eastern foothills of northwest California. They encountered woodlands and chaparral similar to that of the Sierra Nevada and to those they had encountered on leaving the Presidio of Monterey at the beginning of their trip (Map 1). (Today you can experience this part of the trip by driving State Route 36 west from Red Bluff to Platina.) The land they entered in the spring of 1828 was well populated. They used the trails of the Wintu, Tsnungwe, Hupa, Chilula, Yurok, and Tolowa peoples during the 72-day sojourn in the vastness of northwest California. xi\n\nxii\n\nprologue\n\nMap 1. The route of the Jedediah Smith party though northwest California in 1828 showing the Klamath Mountains and the North Coast in northwest California.\n\nThe party passed though summer settlements, villages of distinctive plank houses, meadows containing useful plants, and saw men fishing for spring Chinook. The ease of travel changed dramatically on April 17, 1828, when the men crossed the divide, near present-day Wildwood, between the Sacramento River and a river that Smith assumed ran to the sea at Trinidad Bay (Pierson B. Reading would name it the Trinity River in 1848). They were now in the Klamath Mountains, which Harrison Rogers described as a “maze of woods, ridges, gullies, cliffs, and ravines” in his journal. The party continued down a tributary of what Smith called “Indian Scalp River,” to Hayfork Valley, the land of the Nor-El-Muk Wintu. From\n\nprologue\n\nxiii\n\nhere, they followed Hayfork Creek north and west to the South Fork of the Trinity River at the village of xayiin-pom (Hyampom). Here extensive forests of stately pine and fir mixed with small patches of chaparral and grass, very different from the open oak woodlands east of the mountains. At Hyampom, the river turned north and proceeded quickly through a set of deep canyons of the Tsnungwe people, until the south fork met the main fork of the Trinity River near present-day Salyer. This area is roadless even today. Like the travelers of old, hikers today must use the South Fork Trail to climb steep slopes to ridges, only to drop into new drainages whose streams flow precipitously into the canyon below (Pl. 1). When the Smith party reached the main stem of the Trinity River, they looked down at the river almost 1,000 feet below. Fortunately, trails existed high on the shoulder above the canyons, allowing them to access Hoopa Valley, land of the Hupa. After turning west up Supply Creek, and going northwest toward the ridgeline, they entered a new world: the hills of the North Coast. At the summit of the coastal mountains, dense forests gave way to open woodlands of oaks and extensive prairies in the lands of the Chilula. The tall, rich grass offered abundant forage for the stock after the sparseness of the Trinity River lands. Slopes were gentler and the summits more rounded than were those on the first leg of the journey. Going north, they reached the Klamath River at the village of kime’L (Kanick or Kenick on today’s maps), home to the Yurok. Our travelers missed the important meeting of the Trinity River with the larger Klamath River at Weitchpec. At kime’L they were well north of Trinidad Bay but tantalizingly close to the ocean. Unfortunately, the land was impassable, so they headed southwest on ridges until they reached Gans Prairie. Imagine their joy when they got their first look at the Pacific Ocean. However, it was short-lived. Upon leaving Gans Prairie, the travelers experienced the world of the redwood forest. It would take an entire month to reach the coastal grasslands of the Tolowa only 40 miles to the north. While some redwood stands were open, others presented the Smith party with the greatest obstacles that they had met on their way to Oregon. Here the soils were deep and rich, and they supported massive trees—ones that, when they fall, take other trees with them, leaving jackstraws of massive logs over older piles of rot-resistant logs. Often the forest floor was such a tangled mass that the men could not see the ground. They scrambled over the logs, but the horses had to be led around them. The soft rock was eroded into an impermeable maze of smaller ridges, gullies, and ravines that were even harder to traverse than those of the Trinity River. Again, foiled in their attempt to reach the ocean, they retreated northeast to the Klamath River, crossing it at the Yurok village of pe¢kwan (Pecwan). Continuing north and west, they finally reached the coastline at\n\nxiv\n\nprologue\n\nthe villages of o¢men and o¢men hipu¢r at False Klamath Cove, only to have to scramble over more rough country covered with forests of massive trees before attaining the grassy terrace of the Tolowa around present-day Crescent City. At last, the Smith party had an easier coastal route as they made their way to Oregon. What interests me the most are observations made by Smith and his companions concerning the landscapes in the early 1800s, a time before the gold miners and others arrived. They suggest two very different worlds: the craggy lands of what we call the Klamath Mountains and the rolling hills of the North Coast. Could two landscapes be more different? While much of the answer lies in the geology and other environmental factors, the ecological history of the landscapes plays an equally important role. The early 1800s represent a divide between the old ways of the native peoples and those of the new settlers. Understanding the diverse influences that have affected the land since that settlement will also assist our interpreting the current landscapes of northwest California. NORTHWEST CALIFORNIA\n\nEarly geologists described the natural areas of North America as physiographic provinces. Charles Hunt in Physiography of the United States defined a province as “a distinctive structural framework giving rise to distinctive land forms expressing their structure and, for the most part, distinctive climates, vegetation, soils, water, and other resources.” C. Hart Merriam at the end of the 19th century used similar thinking in creating his famous life zone classification that many naturalists learned early in their study of nature. Robert Bailey updated this approach in his Ecosystem Geography. The sections of his Northern California Mountains Province—the Klamath Mountains, Northern California Coast Ranges, Cascades, and Sierra Nevada— are comparable to those of other geographers and geologists. I will follow in the footsteps of Bailey in using the Cascades and Central Valley Provinces as the eastern boundary of northwest California, but I break from convention by using the watershed boundaries of Stony Creek and Eel River as my southern limit. It is not geologically distinct or topographically dramatic, but instead it is ecologically and culturally important. Snow Mountain is the last of the high peaks of the North Coast Ranges, and the southern border represents the divide between the north-trending Eel River and the south-trending Russian River. It also separates the timberlands to the north from the towns and vineyards to the south. The Pacific Ocean and the California-Oregon border form the western and northern boundaries, respectively. Northwest California is an extremely complex part of the state, even by California standards. Its mountain ranges are spectacular, as are its plenti-\n\nprologue\n\nxv\n\nMap 2. Watersheds of northwest California.\n\nful rivers that twist and turn on their way to the Pacific Ocean or to the plains of Central Valley. Climates are foggy and maritime on the coast, sunny and continental inland. The region is one of the least populated parts of the state, and much of its natural heritage is still intact. People interested in its natural history must wade through a huge quantity of names, descriptions, maps, charts, and graphs before getting a feel for the place. It is worth the effort, for names are rich in heritage, mountain ranges are abundant in biota, rivers are filled with riches, and the land is amazing in detail. The names of the major towns and highways are easy\n\nxvi\n\nprologue\n\nto learn, as they are few: Crescent City, Eureka, Weaverville, Interstate 5, US 199 and State Route 299.\n\nThe Klamath Mountains Geologists recognize mountain ranges in northwest California and southwest Oregon, with their ancient Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks, as the Klamath Mountains. They contrast strongly with the neighboring younger, volcanic rocks of the Cascades (Map 2). The eastern boundary starts east of Interstate 5 and continues north from Redding to the volcanic rocks just south of Mount Shasta City. Farther north, the town of Yreka sits on the region’s eastern boundary; still farther north the line slides slightly to the east as the highway approaches Oregon. The North Yolla Bolly Mountains define the southern boundary, and the western boundary follows roughly the crest of South Fork Mountain and the westernmost ridges of the Siskiyou Mountains to the California-Oregon border. The Klamath Mountains encompass much of Shasta County, all of Trinity County, the western part of Siskiyou County, eastern Humboldt County, and much of Del Norte County. The North Coast The many rock types of the Franciscan and Great Valley formations distinguish the North Coast. The eastern boundary abuts the western ridges of the Siskiyou Mountains north of the Klamath River and South Fork Mountain to the south. South Fork Mountain at its southernmost point merges into the North Yolla Bolly Mountains. Here, the eastern boundary shifts to the base of the North Coast Ranges. The watershed divides of the Stony and Cache creeks and of the Eel and Russian rivers form a southern boundary, and I include the creeks west of the Eel River and south of the Mattole River watersheds north of Cape Vizcaino. The coastline to Oregon forms the western boundary. The northern boundary is also the California-Oregon border. The North Coast includes the coastline of Del Norte County; much of Humboldt and Mendocino counties west of the crest of the North Coast Ranges and Yolla Bolly Mountains; and Shasta, Tehama, Glenn, and Colusa counties to the east. While most of northwest California is sparsely populated, we might call Eureka and Crescent City the “metropolitan” areas on the coast. The larger Redding metropolitan area is just south and east of the boundary, with its western and northern suburbs spilling into both subregions of northwest California.\n\nThe Klamath Land of Mountains and Canyons\n\nThe Klamath Mountains are the home of one of the most exceptional temperate coniferous forest regions in the world. The area’s rich plant and animal life draws naturalists from all over the world. Outdoor enthusiasts enjoy its rugged mountains, its many lakes, its wildernesses, and its wild rivers. Geologists come here to refine the theory of plate tectonics. Yet, the Klamath Mountains are one of the least-known parts of the state. The region’s complex pattern of mountains and rivers creates a bewildering set of landscapes. Its mountains have a geological history similar to those of the ancient Appalachians in the East. Rocks laid in the distant past tell stories of ancient seas, of landmasses from throughout the world that have been added to North America, and of lofty mountain ranges that have worn down only to rise again. Pleistocene ice and now today’s events mold the area’s rivers and mountains. No wonder the area is confusing. The history of the Klamath Mountains begins 450 million years ago with rocks found today in the Trinity Mountains, the highest range in the region. Rock outcrops surrounding Mount Eddy (9,025 ft.) are the oldest and among the largest on the North American continent. These deep-sea basement rocks and associated sedimentary and volcanic rocks occupy the Sacramento and Klamath river watersheds, two of the three master rivers that flow through the Klamath Mountains. EARLY TIMES IN THE KLAMATH MOUNTAINS\n\nThe Klamath Mountains are internationally famous in geological circles. Here geologists began testing the new theory of plate tectonics in the 1960s, which suggests that hot molten rocks well up from the interior of the Earth at midocean spreading centers, where they form rigid tectonic 1\n\n2\n\nthe klamath\n\nplates of oceanic crust and upper mantle. As these rocks cool and crystallize, they form a characteristic sequence of rock types (peridotite, gabbro, sheeted dikes, and submarine basalt) on which sediments collect over time. This rock series makes up an ophiolite suite (or just ophiolite). It becomes part of the rigid plate that moves slowly from the spreading center and interacts with other plates. When two plates converge, one may descend below the other in a process called subduction (Fig. 1). It is a zone of great geological activity, as the lighter continental plate slips over the heavier oceanic plate. A deep ocean trench marks the point where they converge. Here a part of the ocean’s crust and its upper mantle may separate and become attached (accreted) to the continental plate, as the rest of the oceanic plate descends back into the mantle. The scraped rock assemblage makes up an accreted terrane or terrane (note the spelling). This process results in mountain building through associated earthquake activity, along with buckling, faulting, and folding of rocks at the plate boundary. Today’s earthquakes tell us that the process is still active along the coast of northwest California. Geologists studying the Klamath Mountains a century ago recognized four belts whose rock units had similar makeup. The belts are younger from east to west, and major faults separate them. Today’s geologists interpret the pattern as a set of plates and sutures. They also noticed that the belts were associated with granitic plutons (bodies of crystallized magma) younger than the surrounding rocks. We now know that the belts and fault systems represent a sequence of plate convergence and subduction events, called accretionary episodes, which added pieces of land to the western edge of North America during periods of mountain building. Plate tectonic theory also explains the associated granitic plutons. Granitic rocks—diorite, quartzdiorite, and granodiorite—commonly form the core of many of the world’s mountains. As a plate descends, the rocks are heated, and parts become molten magma. Some magma reaches the surface, creating a chain of active volcanoes. Some magma forced (intruded) into the overlying rocks and fractures forms dikes, plutons, and batholiths. Dikes are magma that solidified in fractures. Plutons are pools of molten rock that never made it through an overburden rock and crystallize in place as the mountain building continues. A batholith is a group of plutons of differing age and chemical makeup. Plutons exist throughout the Klamath Mountains (Table 1). Most of the sedimentary and volcanic rock types seen today in the Klamath Mountains are altered (metamorphosed). Past mountain-building processes heated the area’s rocks to high temperatures, put them under intense pressures, compressed them, subjected them to other stresses, and changed them when they met hot fluids. These processes altered the original rock texture and mineral content. Typically, rock minerals rearrange\n\nFigure 1. Plate tectonic setting for the West Coast.

The resulting slates (metamorphosed mudstones) and schists (metamorphosed sandstones) make up metasedimentary rocks (or just metasediments). Similarly altered volcanic rock types are metavolcanic rocks (or metavolcanics). For example, greenstone represents basalt altered under low temperature and pressure. There are other altered igneous rocks (Table 2). Crystallization of magma rich in magnesium iron silicates forms peridotite, the basement rock of every terrane.

WATERSHEDS OF THE KLAMATH MOUNTAINS\n\nThe headwaters of the Sacramento River commence on the slopes of Mount Eddy and at Cliff Lake in the Trinity Mountains, and as a set of springs on the lower slopes of Mount Shasta in the adjacent Cascades. Water flows from these sources into Siskiyou Lake and then down the canyon of the Sacramento River to Lake Shasta before entering the Sacramento Valley and finally San Francisco Bay. The headwaters of the Pit River, a major tributary of the Sacramento River, start far away on the shores of Goose Lake and in the Warner Mountains east of the Cascades. Water from these sources flows though the Pit River canyon that has cut through the lava flows of the Cascades, creating a water gap before entering Lake Shasta. The upper Sacramento lies east of the Klamath Mountains. The middle Sacramento includes the lands of streams that start or flow through the region. Those of the lower Sacramento are downstream from Lake Shasta. The Klamath River also has a long and circuitous route to the Pacific Ocean from its headwaters on the eastern slopes of the Cascades of southern Oregon. The stream flows from Upper Klamath Lake west through a water gap in Cascade lavas, entering the Klamath Mountains just west of Interstate 5 (I 5). The lands east and upstream from the highway make up the upper Klamath. The lands west and downstream are those of the middle Klamath, including those of the Scott, Salmon, and Trinity rivers. From the highway the stream travels west to Happy Camp, where it turns south until it reaches Weitchpec, where it flows through another water gap in the\n\nthe klamath\n\n7\n\nSiskiyou Mountains, takes a hard turn to the north, and enters the North Coast region. These western lands are those of the lower Klamath. The lands of the Smith River are quite separate from those of either the Klamath or the Sacramento. The headwaters start high on the western and eastern slopes of the Siskiyou Mountains of Oregon and California. The stream’s two major forks meet near the Klamath–North Coast boundary. The land of the last 17 miles to the mouth of the Smith River makes up the ecologically different lower Smith River watershed (Map 2). LANDS OF THE MIDDLE SACRAMENTO RIVER\n\nMount Shasta looms on the horizon when travelers drive north on I 5 toward Redding. The higher ridgeline to the west are the peaks of the Trinity Mountains, the divide between the Sacramento and Trinity rivers. To the southwest are the Yolla Bolly Mountains of the North Coast; to the east are the Cascade volcanoes of Lassen Peak and Burney Mountain. To the north are a set of “hills” that you scarcely notice; these are the lands of the middle Sacramento country (Map 3). Shasta Lake, more than any other feature, distinguishes this country. Shasta Dam, the hub of the Central Valley Project with its elaborate complex of dams and reservoirs, creates the 29,500-acre Lake Shasta with a shoreline of 365 miles at maximum storage—the largest reservoir in the state. The Sacramento River is only one of its various arms. The McCloud River arm, receiving water from the southern slopes of Mount Shasta, also flows into McCloud Lake, where an aqueduct system transfers about a third of its water to Indian Canyon Reservoir and then to the Pit River arm. Only two major highways, I 5 and State Route (SR) 299, traverse this 1.35-million acre watershed. The Southern Pacific Railroad and I 5 form an important corridor of interstate commerce, connecting the cities of California with those of Oregon and Washington. Most of the 171,000 people of Shasta County live near the interstate. Almost all reside in Redding (pop. 85,000), the hub of commerce in the northernmost part of the state. The only other towns in this country—Dunsmuir, Lakehead, and Shasta Lake City—are situated along the I 5 freeway. State Route 299 is the major eastwest highway connecting Redding with the coastal towns of Arcata and Eureka. The country’s rounded ridges and mountaintops are deeply forested. Steep slopes, half of them exceeding 15 percent, support well-lit woodlands and chaparral. Mining activities devastated much of the original forest cover. Pierson B. Reading discovered gold in 1848 on the banks of Readings Bar on the Trinity River, and prospectors discovered gold the next year in Sacramento’s Clear Creek near the community of French Gulch. The Deadwood–French Gulch mining district became one of the richest in the\n\n8\n\nthe klamath\n\nMap 3. Features of the middle Sacramento River country. The Klamath Region bulges east, and Mount Shasta to the north looks down on Redding at the crossroads of Interstate 5 and State Route 299.\n\nstate, but gold was not the only metal found in the Klamath Mountains. Copper mining became important in the late 1800s. They extracted cadmium, lead, limestone, sulfur, and zinc as well gold. Mine symbols dot maps of the Redding area, and with mines came smelters. Decades of emitting poisonous fumes from the region’s smelters denuded the local mountain slopes. By the early 1900s, erosion was extreme. Today the waters behind Shasta Dam cover many of these bare slopes. Chaparral blankets the slopes above lake level due to active restoration activities after World War II. A substantial scar of the Iron Mountain Mine comes into view west of Lake Shasta. This mine is a notorious toxic waste site. Its water (which has a pH of –1, the lowest reported in the world) flows into Lake Shasta. Lower-elevation streams surge through rugged, rocky canyons above Lake Shasta. Mountain slopes far away from the mining districts remain much as they were in the early 1800s. In the northerly parts of the Trinity Mountains, called the Eddies, we find mountain meadows and 30 subalpine lakes. Mount Eddy, the highest peak in northwest California, and\n\nthe klamath\n\n9\n\nCastle Crags (4,440 ft.), a granitic batholith of the Mesozoic Age, loom above the forested slopes. Shasta Bolly (6,209 ft.) and Bully Choop (6,970 ft.), near Whiskeytown Lake (named for the 1849 mining town of Whiskey Creek Diggings), stand well above the crest line in the southernmost extension of the Trinity Mountains. To the north, Grizzly Peak (6,250 ft.) stands well above the other, much lower peaks in the McCloud River, Pit River, and Squaw Creek watersheds. Lower mountain summits in the east are restricted to forested elevations, where logging has left its scars on many of the lower slopes. The middle Sacramento country experiences hot summers and rainy winters (Fig. 2). These lands do not lie in the rain shadow of the mountains to the west, since many winter storms move up the Sacramento Valley. Areas at higher elevations receive ample precipitation (60–100 in. annually), but the canyon lands receive only half that of the mountain slopes. Winter temperatures at lower elevations are mostly above freezing, and summer temperatures are very high. Only the highest peaks hold snow into the summer. Biological diversity comes in many forms. Lower-elevation conditions are sufficiently hot that it is best for visitors in the summer to spend their time at “The Lake.” Trips to see the low-elevation limestone areas are preferable in the spring or fall; summer is best focused on higher elevations. The lands are mainly those of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, and roads are mostly unpaved. Many privately owned sections exist in the watershed. Watch for signs along the roadsides that indicate ownership. Limestone areas offer something for everyone: high plant diversity, rare animals, interesting fossils, and caves (Pl. 2). Limestone exists in two different belts, each with its own character. McCloud limestone of the Permian Age is replete with corals, brachiopods, and other marine fossils. Hosselkus limestone of the Triassic Age has rich fossil assemblages of ammonites, brachiopods, corals, and ichthyosaurs. These animals lived in warm, shallow seas west of the continent. Outcrops of McCloud limestone are extensive along the McCloud arm of Lake Shasta. Here, Shasta Caverns offers a tour of lighted caves after a boat ride across the lake from I 5. Visitors arrive at the more natural Sawmel Cave after another boat ride. Signs along the trail interpret a Wintu legend concerning a woman slipping and falling into the cave. Arrange to pick up the key from Forest Service personnel before your trip. Impressive Dekkas Rock, an important religious site to the Wintu, is across the lake from the campground that shares its name. By traveling to the town of McCloud and then south past Lake Britton to Ah-di-na Campground, you can visit The Nature Conservancy’s McCloud River Preserve, the original source of rainbow trout eggs used to introduce rainbow trout to the rest of the world. The preserve allows catch-andrelease fishing. The McCloud River was a seasonal home for the Wintu to\n\nFigure 2. Diagrams of annual temperature and precipitation patterns in the Klamath Mountains.

A hike west from the campground will offer a taste of the Girard Ridge roadless area. A road trip on Forest Service (FS) Road 38N23 to Girard Outlook offers great views of Castle Crags and Mount Shasta; it is possible to spend the night in the outlook. The outrageous shrub diversity described along Low Pass Creek in the vegetation chapter exists in Devil’s Rock–Hosselkus Limestone Research Natural Area between the Squaw and Pit arms of Lake Shasta. Hosselkus limestone is famous for many things beyond its Triassic fossils. The most notable living plant is the Shasta snow-wreath, discovered in 1992. It is a member of a genus Neviusia that botanists previously considered restricted to the hills of Alabama. The limestone is also home to the Shasta salamander and Pleistocene Age fossils in cave deposits. Use Fenders Ferry Road (FS 27) to access the area, and stop at Potem Falls on the way. The Castle Crags point out the state park and several nearby areas of biological interest. Visitors know of its excellent rock for climbing and its aweinspiring views of Mount Shasta. Plant species growing in rock crevices exist nowhere else. The park abuts Castle Crag Wilderness with popular Castle Lake, an area that offers serpentine substrates with their own biological oddities. The serpentine substrates of the nearby Trinity Mountains also offer many high-elevation gems. South Fork Sacramento Road (FS 26) and Castle Creek Road (FS 27) supply quick access. In 1979, Todd Keeler-Wolf discovered an area around Cliff Lake with 11 conifer species, now designated as Cedar Basin Research Natural Area. Toad Lake, known for its rich serpentine flora, is accessible by the Pacific Crest Trail. LANDS OF THE MIDDLE KLAMATH RIVER\n\nInterstate 5 north of Mount Shasta first skirts the Greenhorn Mountains, the eastern boundary of the Klamath Mountains, as it cuts though the Shasta Valley, follows the Shasta River to the Klamath River, and then crosses the Siskiyou Mountains into Oregon (Map 4). The Klamath River west of I 5 picks up the waters from three of its major tributaries. The Scott River meets it at Hamburg downstream from the freeway. The Salmon River enters at the mining town of Somes Bar after the big bend south at Happy Camp, originally called Murderers Bar. The Trinity River, the largest of the three, and the Klamath River converge at Weitchpec. The lands of these three watersheds are described separately, but first let’s consider the immediate lands in the 1.3-million-acre area of the middle Klamath country (Pl. 3). While traveling west, the river moves through some 260 million years of geology. Cherts, conglomerates, limestones, sandstones, shales, schists, and serpentine substrates seen along the river represent parts of many different\n\n12\n\nthe klamath\n\nMap 4. Features of middle Klamath River country. State Route 95 follows the Klamath River from Interstate 5 to Weitchpec and its convergence with the Trinity River.\n\nterranes added to the western edge of North America over millions of years. Mesozoic Age intrusions of granitic rock add further to the lack of geologic order. The rocks get younger to the west, with Galice metasediments of Jurassic Age forming the western boundary of the Klamath Mountains. Not only did the terranes dock with the continent, but also in the process, they created the massive ancestral Klamath Mountains during Jurassic and Cretaceous times. Volcanoes, associated lava flows, and deep sediments covered plutonic intrusions of granites. Erosion removed hundreds of feet of material from these mountains over the next 100 million years, only for the area to experience another period of mountain building. Today’s Klamath Mountains are the result of an even more recent uplift.\n\nthe klamath\n\n13\n\nEach period of mountain building initiated a cycle of erosion. At first, streams had high gradients creating steep-sided canyons and V-shaped valleys with thin soils. As time passed, stream gradients lessened, slopes became gentler, and soils deepened. Erosion continued until the land had very low relief and was covered with thick, well-weathered soils; geologists call this stage a peneplain. If the area has a new period of mountain building, the cycle would begin again. Reaching peneplain stage depends on place and history. Usually areas do not reach the final stage; instead, long periods of erosion create subdued topography. Today the middle Klamath River gradually passes downward through scenes alternating between gorges, forested slopes (75 percent exceeding 15 percent slope), and small river terraces. Former mining towns such as Gottville, Seiad Valley, Happy Camp, Somes Bar, and Orleans occupy the larger terraces. Ridges and peaks crowd the river, including the even more precipitous walls at China Point and at the mouth of Bluff Creek, made famous by the sighting of Bigfoot in 1958, the local version of the Abominable Snowman, Sasquatch, or Yeti. We now know that Bigfoot was the hoax of Ray Wallace, the then-editor of a Eureka newspaper, the Times-Standard. Several mountain ranges tower above the river. The Siskiyou Mountains to the north include prominent Mount Ashland (7,500 ft.) in the northeast corner, Little Grayback (6,160 ft.) west of Happy Camp, and Berrill Peak (4,350 ft.) near Weitchpec. South of the Klamath River are the Scott Bar Mountains to the east of the Scott River’s confluence with the Klamath and the Marble Mountains to the west. The peaks of the Marble Mountains are highest to the east at Boulder Peak (8,300 ft.), gradually lowering to Marble Mountain (6,780 ft.), the namesake of the range. The mountain is conspicuous not for its height but for its white marble that contrasts strongly with the surrounding dark fir forests. Evidence of glaciation is extensive at higher elevations, and some 100 subalpine lakes dot the range. The climate is one of sunny summers and rainy winters (Fig. 2). High elevations of the Siskiyou and Marble mountains receive abundant precipitation (45–125 in.) annually, and they maintain deep snowpacks well into the summer. Low-elevation canyons receive only about a third the annual precipitation of the mountain slopes. At lower elevations, winter temperatures are mostly above freezing, with fleeting snow. Summers are hot. The landscape shows the effects of mining in the 1800s and of the more recent clear-cutting in the late 1900s supervised by the personnel of Klamath and Six Rivers national forests. Today travelers see a mosaic of young tree plantations mixed with the original forest. Several large, recent fires have occurred throughout this watershed. Biological areas of interest exist near the wilderness areas. Grayback Road (FS 48), from Happy Camp to O’Brien, cuts through the Siskiyou\n\n14\n\nthe klamath\n\nMountains between Siskiyou Wilderness to the west and Red Buttes Wilderness to the east. Marble Mountain Wilderness lies south of the river. Following SR 96 west along the scenic Klamath River from I 5 is the fastest way to arrive. National forest roads are numerous and unpaved. South of the Klamath River and Seiad Valley, FS 46N64 climbs to Lake Mountain Botanical Area, the northern extent of foxtail pine. Also noteworthy are the other peaks of the Marble Mountains to the south near Black Marble Castle (7,445 ft.) and the associated native limestone caves, best left to serious spelunkers. I celebrate the area’s awe-inspiring meadowlands in the vegetation chapter. It requires somewhat less work to see the delights of the western part of Marble Mountain Wilderness. The Wooley Creek batholith, with its erosive granitic soils, has dense fir forests with diverse, understory layers highlighted in Haypress Meadows and Bridge Creek research natural areas. Within Siskiyou Wilderness, the Forest Service formally recognizes special areas around Preston Peak (7,310 ft.) for their rich forests, meadows, and glacial features. Nearby are botanical geological and research natural areas with exquisite stands of Port Orford–cedar, rhododendron, and herbrich meadows. I would add Devil’s Punch Bowl and Youngs Valley to a list of enticing biological areas. Elk Hole Geological Area has the southernmost stand of Alaska yellow-cedar. Rock Creek Butte Research Natural Area, with its diverse forests with Brewer spruce, is accessed by the infamous GO Road (FS 115N01). During the 1980s, a dispute arose over the Forest Service building the 55-mile GO Road that would have connected Gasquet on the Smith River and Orleans on the Klamath River. The last miles of road would have crossed lands sacred to the Karuk, Tolowa, and Yurok as the road passed through the Siskiyou Mountains. The Forest Service saw building of the road as significant for the development of timber harvesting, recreation, maintenance, and fire control, but it interfered with the religious practices of native peoples. Years of controversy, including US Supreme Court decisions, international law, passing of the California Wilderness Act in 1984, and the creation of Smith River National Recreation Area in 1990, ended the debate. Today the last six miles are included in Siskiyou Wilderness, and religious practices are preserved. Interesting areas near Red Buttes Wilderness offer another look at the Siskiyou Mountains via Cook and Green Pass (see above), and the road to Seiad Valley-Cook and Green Pass Road (FS 48N20). House Creek Botanical Area presents a lovely riparian setting before hunting down the rare Baker cypress. The nearby Cook and Green Pass and White Mountain botanical areas, on the mountain crest, are famous for their flowery meadows and rock outcrops. A hike from the pass offers even richer high-elevation experiences.\n\nthe klamath\n\n15\n\nLANDS OF THE SCOTT RIVER\n\nA visit to Scott Valley, the largest in the region, seems like a taste of the Great Basin with its foothill ranchlands of juniper and sagebrush (Map 5). Scott Valley is a fast hop from Yreka and I 5 by way of SR 3 or GrazelleCallahan Road (Siskiyou Co. 2H01) through the modestly tall Greenhorn Mountains clothed in open stands of Jeffrey pine and oak (Pl. 4). A quick look at a map confirms that we are in the rain shadow of several mountain ranges between here and the Pacific Ocean. Indeed, climatic records tell us that this country has the most continental weather in the Klamath Mountains and the driest (overall 18–85 in. annually). While the eastern slopes of the Scott, Salmon, and Marble mountains receive abundant precipitation, Scott Bar Mountains, Scott Valley, and the surrounding foothills receive noticeably less. Winter temperatures are often below freezing with long-lasting snow; summer temperatures are moderate (Fig. 2). The northerly flowing Scott River in this 521,000-acre watershed begins in the Scott Mountains. Its east fork originates on the slopes of China Mountain (8,540 ft.), just north of Mount Eddy. Its south fork starts at South Fork Lakes near the convergence of the Scott and Salmon mountains and Trinity Alps. This ridge crest is the divide between the Scott and Trinity rivers. State Route 3 enters over Scott Mountain (6,830 ft.) via the route of the old California-Oregon stage. Travelers used this route to reach Oregon before the railroad was completed up the Sacramento River. The northern slopes are dotted with subalpine lakes and open forests. As with the adjacent Trinity Mountains, they contain serpentine substrates of the Trinity ophiolite. Mountainsides are moderately steep, with about half exceeding a 15 percent slope. China Peak, Kangaroo Lake, Scott Mountain, and Rock Creek botanical areas were established to protect the California pitcher plant and other high-elevation serpentine plants. Subalpine woodlands clothe the crest. These north-facing drainages present many glacial features, including a rock glacier on the north side of Cory Peak (7,700 ft.). The Salmon and Marble mountains form the western boundary of Scott Valley country. In contrast to the Scott Mountains, the Salmons are mainly granites of the Russian Peak batholith, and beautiful subalpine lakes are concentrated near Russian Peak (8,190 ft.) in the Russian Wilderness, which contains Duck Lakes Botanical Area and the adjacent Sugar Creek Research Natural Area. Wander the trails and old roads of the Duck Lake Creek and Horse Range Creek drainages to enjoy the rich concentration of 17 conifers described in the vegetation chapter. Only two roads connect the Scott Valley with the Salmon River lands to the west. Sawyers Bar Road (Co. Rd. 1C01) separates the Salmons and Marbles, although the ranges are continuously high. Marble Mountain Wilderness to the north contains montane and subalpine lakes, and meadows set\n\n16\n\nthe klamath\n\nMap 5. Features of the Scott River country.

The lands around Boulder Peak (8,300 ft.) are another area of serpentine substrates. The Scott Bar Mountains form the northeastern boundary of the watershed. They are a confusing mixture of Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks of many kinds, including serpentine substrates. Peaks, such as Deadwood Baldy Peak (6,045 ft.) and Indian Peak Baldy (5,695 ft.), are sufficiently low that these mountains show little effect of glaciation. The still-lower Greenhorn Moun-\n\nthe klamath\n\n17\n\ntains, with more bewildering Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks, represent the eastern boundary of the Scott Valley country. Duzel Rock (6,040 ft.), a noticeable capstone of limestone, is prominent on the eastern ridgeline. The community of Fort Jones, once a stop of the California-Oregon stage, was called Wheelock, Scottsburg, and Ottitewa before settling on today’s name. A local military fort operated from 1852 to 1857. Nearby Etna (originally Etna Mills) began as a gold mining town, but people also found gold in growing grain for the miners’ bread. Callahan, another stage stop and mining town, resides at the south end of the valley. CallahanCecilville Road (Co. Rd. 1C02) to the south also allows access to the Salmon River country. Agriculture greatly reshaped the valley bottom, and today the area is committed to alfalfa. Mountainsides are mostly part of the Klamath National Forest. Scattered parcels managed by the Bureau of Land Management exist among many old, privately owned mining claims in the Scott Bar and Greenhorn mountains. Miners discovered gold on the eastern flanks of these mountains in 1851. Dredging of the Scott River continued into the 1960s, giving it the dubious honor of being the last to be dredged in the state. The river ends at the convergence with the middle Klamath after surging through a scenic canyon north of the valley proper. Scott River Road (Co. Rd. 7C01) will take you through this canyon. LANDS OF THE SALMON RIVER\n\nThe Salmon River country, the heart of the Klamath Mountains, is the most rugged and isolated of the region’s watersheds (Map 6). Some 85 percent of the mountain slopes exceed a 15 percent slope in this 310,000-acre watershed. Getting there to enjoy its beauty takes some doing. Only three Siskiyou County roads traverse the country by closely following its canyons. North Fork Road (Co. Rd. 1C01) connects Etna in the Scott Valley with Sawyers Bar, and South Fork Road (Co. Rd. 1C02) to the south connects Callahan with Cecilville. Both streams flow through steep-walled canyons, especially on the South Fork (Pl. 5). Below their convergence, kayakers run the whitewater as cars creep along the one-lane road (Co. Rd. 2B01). Chiseled out of the canyon walls well above the rapids, this road connects the hamlet of Forks of Salmon with SR 96. The ancient bedrock in the country is similar to that of the middle Klamath River, but much of its geology is the result of events of the last two million years. Conditions during the Pleistocene and the Holocene were sufficiently cold that mountain valleys were filled with glaciers that alternated with warmer periods when the valleys were free of ice. The last glacial cycle ended about 150 years ago (Table 3).\n\n18\n\nthe klamath\n\nMap 6. Features of the Salmon River country. The Salmon River watershed in the Klamath Mountains lacks a state highway. State Route 96 passes to the west at the convergence of the Salmon and Klamath rivers at Somes Bar. The large subbasin in the north is Wooley Creek.\n\nToday hikers climb grand staircases on their way to the glacier-created landscapes of tarns and moraine-created lakes in Marble, Russian, and Trinity Alps wildernesses. Bedrock with polish and scratches and individual boulders left on glaciated surfaces suggest that the ice left only recently, but the southern slopes of many peaks show no evidence of ice. Peaks rise as much as 8,000 feet above the convergence of the Salmon River with the Klamath River. To the south, Salmon Peak (6,955 ft.) begins a ridge that includes Mary Blaine Mountain (6,750 ft.), Cesar Peak (8,920 ft.),\n\nthe klamath\n\n19\n\ntable 3.

Russian Peak to the east and English Peak (7,320 ft.) and Medicine Peak (8,835 ft.) to the west finish the crest around the drainage. The North Fork begins as lakes near English Peak, and the South Fork in the Caribou Lake Basin, with its famous lakes. Wooley Creek, President Herbert Hoover’s favorite steelhead stream, starts in the northeast part of the well inside Marble Mountain Wilderness at Man Eaten Lake. The watershed’s climate is one of sunny summers and rainy winters (35–85 in. annually). High elevations receive abundant precipitation and maintain deep snowpacks well into the summer. Low-elevation canyons receive less annual precipitation than the canyons of the middle Klamath River. At lower elevations, winter temperatures are mostly above freezing, with fleeting snow. Summers are hot. Impacts on the land are similar to those of the middle Klamath River, but the terrain is steeper. The effects of gold mining are especially evident in the Summerville Mining District near Cecilville. Recent fires have changed the country. Fires burned about half of the Salmon River country since the early 1900s and 30 percent since 1975. The 1977 Hog fire burned 50,000 acres, and the 1987 fires burned 90,900 acres in four separate areas.\n\n20\n\nthe klamath LANDS OF THE TRINITY RIVER\n\nThe Trinity River is the largest drainage in the Klamath Mountains (Map 7). It covers almost two million acres, about a third of the entire Klamath River system. Weaverville, the largest town in the region (pop. 3,554), sits in the center of the watershed. Trinity Lake, another massive reservoir of the Central Valley Project, and the smaller Lewiston Lake dominate the country and its economy. The Lewiston Power Plant diverts water from the Trinity River country through the Trinity Mountains to Clear Creek, where it fills Whiskeytown Lake, only to be transported to the Sacramento River. Trinity\n\nKLAMATH MOUNTAINS DURING THE GREAT ICE AGE\n\nThe Quaternary spans the last two million years, including the Pleistocene—the Great Ice Age—and the Holocene—the Anthropogene, the “Age of Man.” The climates during this period were generally colder than were those of the Tertiary. In the mountains of northwest California, this was the time of a series of cold periods with associated glacial advances called glaciations, glacial stages, or glacials. These glacials alternated with warmer periods of glacial retreat called interglacials, during which the land was more or less free of permanent ice. The last glacial ended about 150 years ago. The Pleistocene Until recently, geologists considered that the Pleistocene in North America involved 4 glacial cycles. Today they distinguish 11 or more before the Illinoian glacial, but they are not important in our discussion. A warm Sangamonian interglacial in the late Pleistocene began about 130,000 years ago and lasted about 55,000 years. The last glacial, the Wisconsin (Wisconsinan), began about 80,000 years ago and lasted until the Holocene. Glacial ice collected during the Wisconsin in the higher elevations, especially in the Marble Mountains, Trinity Alps, and Trinity Mountains. This ice moved down drainages abrading and quarrying rock, leaving behind the erosional features that distinguish these ranges today. Unlike the Sierra Nevada with its ice caps, glaciers in our mountains formed in the valley bottoms, mainly in north-tending drainages. The ridges and south-tending drainages had less ice or were ice-free. At times, however, ice spilled over ridges and coalesced with adjacent glaciers. Parts of ridges went unglaciated, and they protruded out of the ice as formations called nunataks. The Wisconsin glacial involved a series of ice-free times (interstadials), as well as ones of ice advance (stadials). The last major ice advance, the Late Wisconsin, occurred about 22,000 years ago. Since then, the climate has warmed in spurts with several reversals, during which the ice advanced and then retreated. During the interstadials, clay, silt, sand, gravel, and boulders (collectively called till), eroded from higher elevations, accumulated in mounds and ridges (moraines), as the ice melted. Boulder shape and surface characteristics in the till, and the extent of\n\nthe klamath\n\n21\n\nAlps Wilderness is the largest and the most visited in the region, but we still know the area as gold rush country. La Grange Mine, near Weaverville, was the largest hydraulic mine in the world. The California Historical Landmark No. 778 marks the mine site along SR 299. The western slopes of Oregon Mountain are still raw from 90 years of mining that ended in 1941. Today the mine’s tailings are a new source of wealth as rock aggregate is now used in construction and road building. Even though gold existed in all parts of the region, the Trinity River country was, in many ways, the focus of the area’s gold rush. Lindsay Applegate\n\nsoil development between the boulders, allow geologists to date the different morainal deposits. Newer glacial advances in the Klamath Mountains ended at higher elevations than did the older ones, so typically younger ice flowed over older till. Holocene Geologists delimit the Holocene by the time of rapid change from glacial conditions to warm ones in northern Europe that occurred some 10,000 years ago. In North America, including northwest California, the warming began earlier in the Pleistocene. It was stepwise set in character, with reversals to cold, arid conditions. The last cold period was the Younger Dryas, 12,800 to 11,600 years ago. Significant temperature increases followed, melting the last of the Pleistocene ice. Temperatures in the early Holocene continued to rise, peaking from 7,000 to 5,000 years ago, a time variously called the Altithermal, Hypsithermal, or Xerothermic, when summer temperatures in our mountains were hot and onshore winds brought dense summer fogs to the coast. Moreover, these fogs were more extensive than they are today. Temperatures moderated after the Hypsithermal. About 4,000 years ago, climates were less seasonal, temperatures cooled, the coast became less foggy, and ice again collected in our mountains. From 3,000 to 2,500 years ago, conditions were sufficiently cold to warrant the name Neoglacial. From 1,300 to 800 years ago, conditions were again warm and arid; this period is the Medieval Warm Period. In California, it was a time of drought; Europe enjoyed a marvelous climate. About 600 years ago, the climate again cooled, and northwest California entered the Little Ice Age. This glacial lasted until about 150 years ago. The small ice fields on the north slopes of the Salmon Mountains near Thompson Peak date from this time. Since 1850, the climate warmed until the 1940s, only to cool until the 1970s. Now the trend is upward. I have enjoyed checking out the “glacierets” in the Trinity Alps over the last 40 years. Today these permanent ice sheets exist behind well-defined moraines with very angular boulders, telling of their youth. During the drought of the late 1980s, these sheets were all but lost, only to expand to meet the moraines in 1996. Today the glacierets are again smaller.\n\n22\n\nthe klamath\n\nMap 7. Features of the Trinity River country. Trinity River country contains the four state routes. State Route 36 to the south passes south of Hayfork at the start of State Route 3, which extends north over South Mountain to Scott Valley. The north-tending State Route 96 starts at Willow Creek.\n\nfound it in 1849 at the head of Scott River, a year after Reading discovered gold on the banks of the Trinity River. Other strikes followed in 1850 on the Salmon River and in the eastern foothills of the Greenhorn Mountains near Yreka. Gold mining continues today. When driving along SR 299 between Junction City and Big Bar, look for the small, floating suction dredges that retrieve gold from deep gravels of the riverbed. There are continuing arguments over a proposed open-pit gold mine along Canyon Creek. State Route 3 north of Weaverville takes you to the gold diggings along Coffee Creek and the upper Trinity. Much of the effect from decades of mining activity is now covered by new forests and not evident when traveling through the country. A visit to historic Weaverville and the Joss House—The Temple of the Forest Beneath the Clouds, the oldest continuously used Chinese temple in\n\nthe klamath\n\n23\n\nCalifornia—will remind you better of the mining past. Most highways are twisty and follow the river canyons. State Routes 3, 299, and 96 encircle the spectacular Trinity Alps. State Route 3 continues north over the Scott Mountains to Scott Valley. State Route 96 follows the downstream reaches of the Trinity from Willow Creek to its convergence with the Klamath River at Weitchpec. Rafting many parts on the Trinity River is an increasingly popular way to savor the area. State Route 36 is the slowest of the region’s state highways. Locals drive it freely, but flatlanders (i.e., city slickers) find it narrow, even frightening. It traverses the lands of the Trinity’s south fork. The Scott and Trinity mountains meet just north of Mount Eddy, the headwaters of the Trinity River; the Trinity Alps occur to the west. The eastern ranges, referred to as “the Red Alps,” are part of the Trinity ophiolite (Pl. 6). Deadfall Basin Botanical Area and Mount Eddy, Preachers Meadow, and Stuart Fork research natural areas recognize the ecological interest of these serpentine-rich mountain ranges with their rare plants, rich woodlands, and chaparral. The central Trinity Alps contain several large granitic outcrops offering the hiker a “Sierra Nevada” experience, only at lower elevations (Pl. 7). Canyon Creek and Stuart Fork are among the most popular parts of the wilderness for backpacking. A day hike to Boulder Lake or Bear Lake can give you a taste of “the White Alps.” The lower terrain of the New River area takes the hiker into still another aspect of the wilderness, “the Green Alps,” the least-known part of the wilderness. Fir forests in North Trinity Mountain Research Natural Area occupy granitic soils in the westernmost part of the wilderness. Down at lower elevations, you can arrange tours of several Hupa village sites, dance grounds, and the remains of Fort Gaston at the Hoopa Tribal Museum in Hoopa. The Vista Point on SR 96 provides views of several restored traditional Hupa houses. Mountainsides in the Alps are comparable to other watersheds in the region, with two-thirds exceeding a 15 percent slope. They contain the most widespread montane and subalpine terrain in northwest California. Thompson Peak (9,000 ft.) is the tallest peak in the Alps. From here streams radiate like the spokes of a crude wheel. The mountain divides between the streams support myriad peaks. Fifty-five lakes are scattered at the headwaters of the major streams. The Trinity River has four forks and three other major streams. Coffee Creek, Swift Creek, and Stuart Fork enter Trinity Lake on the west. Canyon Creek and the North Fork enter after the river has made a sweeping bend west. The deep gorge beside Ironside Mountain (5,250 ft.) gets water from the New River and the South Fork. The New River has many tributaries, including the South Fork of the East Fork of New River. After the South Fork enters, the canyon widens to support the elevated terraces and streamside sandbars at Willow Creek and Hoopa Valley before\n\n24\n\nthe klamath\n\nthe river enters another gorge, eventually meeting the Klamath River at Weitchpec. The country of the Trinity River enjoys sunny summers and snowy winters. Its central ranges receive the highest precipitation (60–85 in. annually). The low-elevation canyons, where winter temperatures are mostly above freezing, snow is fleeting, and the summers are hot, receive about 80 percent of the precipitation of the higher terrain. Winter snow accumulates in the mountains and lasts well into summer. The Trinity Mountains on the east, the North Yolla Bolly Mountains on the south, and South Fork Mountain on the west surround the South Fork country. The South Fork starts on northern slopes of North Yolla Bolly (7,865 ft.), flowing west and north, and picks up water from Hayfork Creek at Hyampom Valley. From there it continues north through still another gorge at Hell’s Half-acre Creek before meeting the main stem near Salyer. Members of the Jedediah Smith party called this rugged terrain a “green prison” in 1828. It appears that Smith still may have picked the best way through these mountains. Mountainsides are generally gentler, with only half of them exceeding a 15 percent slope. This land is a mélange of rock types, including gabbro, chert, granitics, limestone, and sandstones called the Rattlesnake Terrane. Outcrops of serpentine substrates are scattered throughout the mélange. Western Azalea Botanical Area gives only a taste of the floristic richness of the area. This area has some 30 sensitive plants with intriguing names such as Dubakella Mountain buckwheat. Car trips off SR 36 on Shasta-Trinity National Forest roads to Dubakella Mountain (5,635 ft.) and Tedoc Mountain (5,250 ft.) give the plant lover a more complete look. We find Horse Mountain Botanical Area and Rough Ridge and Smokey Creek research natural areas on South Fork Mountain along the western boundary of the region. The mountain’s ridgeline extends from North Yolla Bolly Mountains in the south to Weitchpec. LANDS OF THE UPPER SMITH RIVER\n\nThe upper Smith River and the Smith River Recreation Area are all but the same entity (Map 8). Created in 1990 “to protect the area’s special scenic value, natural diversity, cultural and historical attributes, wilderness, wildlife, fisheries, and clean waters,” the area involves the largest nondammed river system in the nation. The Smith River’s waters return to their famous green soon after the winter storms. This is the quickestclearing stream of the state’s coastal rivers. Fishing on the Smith River is world-class. It provides habitat for Chinook and coho salmon as well as steelhead, rainbow, and cutthroat trout. The bedrock-carved streams flow through steep canyons that are perfect for whitewater rafting and kayaking.\n\nthe klamath\n\n25\n\nMap 8. Features of the upper Smith River country. The smaller North Fork includes much of the land of the Josephine ophiolite in California.\n\nCongress designated more than 300 miles as wild and scenic. The Smith River is in many ways the crown jewel of the National Wild and Scenic River System. The winters are among the rainiest in the state (65–125 in. annually). Winter temperatures at lower elevations are mostly above freezing, and snow is fleeting; winter snow accumulates in the mountains and lasts well into summer. Summer temperatures are moderate. As with the rest of the middle Klamath country, the mountainsides are steep: just over half have a more than 15 percent slope in this relatively small 362,000-acre watershed. Many slopes are unstable because of road building and forest harvesting; landscape scars from natural slides are common. Personnel of the Six Rivers National Forest supervised extensive clear-cutting during the 1970s and 1980s, but much of the rich biological heritage is still intact, even after the huge Biscuit Fire in 2002 that was the size of Rhode Island.\n\n26\n\nthe klamath\n\nThe Smith River’s north fork is a country of sparse vegetation, serpentine barrens, and extensive soggy fens (Pl. 8). This is the land of the Josephine ophiolite, which boasts the highest number of endemic vascular plants (70) of any outcrop of serpentine substrates on the continent. Serpentine barrens occupy gentle ridges where sheet erosion removes fine particles and where only scattered plants exist in the lag gravel. The federally listed McDonald’s rock cress and other rare plants grow in patches of fescue and scattered, dwarf Jeffrey pine trees. The fens of this area are famous for the insectivorous California pitcher plant (Darlingtonia californica). This species is almost completely restricted to areas with flowing water and serpentine substrates. The base of its leaf forms a vase to pool water, and the top of the leaf forms a “cobra head” replete with a “window” that lures unsuspecting insects inside. Once there, slippery walls and downward-pointing hairs force the insect to the waiting water. The rotting insects contain nitrogenous compounds (chemicals otherwise deficient in this habitat) that the plant uses. Growing with this remarkable plant is a diverse set of wet-adapted species, many associated with bog and fen conditions in Canada, including the insectivorous butterwort and sundew. Indeed, these areas are often called “Darlingtonia bogs,” but according to biologists who study bogs and fens in Europe and Canada, bogs are areas where rainwater collects as the result of a buildup of decaying plants, such as Sphagnum; they are nutrient deficient and acidic. In contrast, fens receive water from streams as well as from rainfall, and they contain fewer nutrients and are less acidic. We should consider these boggy areas as fens, but it is hard to break the habit of talking about them as Darlingtonia bogs. These delights can be enjoyed along US 199 at several spots near the community of Gasquet. Myrtle Creek Botanical Area and the Darlingtonia Trail offer a visit to a fen with California pitcher plants. The botanically famous Stoney Creek Trail is an excellent introduction to the serpentine plants of the Josephine ophiolite. Nearby Craig’s Creek Research Natural Area shows off woodlands of knobcone pine and western white pine. North Fork Smith River Botanical Area, including L. E. Horton Research Natural Area, is closed to vehicles other than on Weimer Road (Del Norte Co. Rd. 305). Low Divide is the site of Altaville, the center of copper mining between 1863 and 1865 that sported several saloons, hotels, a butcher shop, a blacksmith shop, general stores, mining offices, and housing. None of these buildings survive, and today the area shows little evidence of its mining period. Broad, flat ridges, such as Gasquet Mountain (2,425 ft.) and High Plateau (3,500 ft.), stand above rugged canyons. These mountains are peneplain surfaces from earlier periods of mountain building. They are areas of low relief and have very deep soils, with little faulting or tilting of\n\nthe klamath\n\n27\n\nthe old landmass. Mining companies seriously considered strip-mining the deep soils for chrome, cobalt, chromium, and nickel on Gasquet Mountain in the 1980s. Plans involved processing the soil in a coal-burning smelter with water from newly created reservoirs. The mines would destroy the mountaintops and dam, and contaminate the streams. Acid rain created by the local smelters would fall on the Siskiyou Mountains and other mountains to the east. Debate raged throughout the 1980s and ended with creation of Smith River National Recreation Area in 1990. Today the emphasis is on taking delight in the wild rivers and wild mountains. The high mountains offer still another look at rich conifer forests, montane meadows, and subalpine lakes in Siskiyou Wilderness. Bear Basin Butte Botanical Area just west of the Siskiyou crest is famous for having 16 conifer species. We find other enriched mixtures at lower elevations at nearby Broken Rib Mountain Botanical Area and at Rock Creek Butte Research Natural Area east of the Siskiyou crest. The views from Bear Basin Butte offer grand views of Preston Peak and the ocean. Look for the isolated piece of redwood forest along French Hill Road (FS 411) on the way to see the nearby lodgepole pine stands at Upper Coon Mountain. Glaciers occurred at the higher elevations of the Siskiyou Mountains, but much of the terrain remained free of ice.\n\nThe North Coast Land of Towering Trees\n\nThe North Coast offers another aspect of the most exceptional temperate coniferous forest region in the world. Naturalists know primarily of its majestic redwood forests, with the tallest trees in the world, and its incomparable coastline, but the region offers much more with its rich biota and scenery. As with the rest of northwest California, the North Coast is one of the least-known parts of the state. The North Coast’s patterns are as bewildering as those of the Klamath Mountains. Today’s landscapes are mainly the result of mountain building that began in the late Pleistocene. South of the Mendocino Triple Junction, the American and Pacific plates continue to slide past each other. This process compresses the lands east of the San Andreas Fault; geologists describe the resulting topography as structurally controlled. Streams drain canyons and narrow valleys that follow faults bounded by ridges that tend northwesterly. As the Klamath River enters the North Coast, it also turns northwest. Starting in the North Yolla Bolly Mountains, the Eel River’s middle fork flows south, only to turn north on its long course to the ocean. Compression has left only one large inland valley, Round Valley, in this geologically squeezed region. Climates add another layer of complexity to the area (Fig. 3). Lands east of the North Coast Ranges experience a classic rain shadow effect. Climates west of the mountains not only differ from those on the east side but also involve a decidedly maritime climate on the immediate coast and a more continental climate on the interior. The rain shadow on the east side causes the foothills to receive onefourth the precipitation of the montane elevations and 5 percent of that on the rainiest parts on the west side. Rains begin in late October and con28\n\nFigure 3. Diagrams of annual temperature and precipitation patterns in the North Coast. Data from the Western Climate Region of the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service.\n\n30\n\nthe north coast\n\ntinue until April. Snow is rare at low elevations. Summers are hot and sunny, with occasional late-summer thunderstorms. On the west side, annual precipitation in several areas approaches the state’s maximum. The interior climate has high daily and annual temperature extremes compared with the coast, and precipitation increases with elevation. The northwest-tending topography both hinders and helps the inland movement of maritime air masses. Streams, such as the Eel River, channel maritime air and fog inland. On the other hand, King Peak and associated ridges near the coastline block the air masses, causing them to lift, which creates areas with very high rainfall. The interior climatic pattern is similar to that of the eastern Klamath Mountains. Rains start in late October and continue until May. Snow occurs during the rainy season, but it is uncommon at lower elevations. January is typically the rainiest month. The snow starts at higher elevations in late October and continues until April. Winter storms are commonplace. Snow lingers in the mountains into late spring on the south-facing slopes and into the early summer on the north-facing slopes. Summers are warm and sunny, with rare late-summer thunderstorms. Autumn is clear and bright until the rains begin. The coastal pattern is one of moderate temperatures yearlong. May is sunny and windy before the summer fogs begin in June. Until September, many days begin with high clouds that burn off by noon or later in the afternoon; not seeing the sun for days is common. September is often the sunniest and warmest month of the year. Winter rains frequently begin in late October and continue until May. The mountain ranges of the North Coast are a southerly extension of South Fork Mountain, the western boundary of the Klamath Mountains. The North Yolla Bolly Mountains merge in the north with the South Yolla Bolly Mountains and, in turn, blend into the North Coast Ranges, which make up a continuous crest line south to Snow Mountain. Lands west of the mountain crest are mainly those of the Eel River. The smaller Bear and Mattole rivers drain the lands near Cape Mendocino, California’s westernmost landmass. The Mad River and several creeks to the south drain the hills and terraces surrounding Humboldt Bay. The topographically separate Redwood Creek and lower Klamath River drain directly into the ocean north of Humboldt Bay, as does the decidedly isolated lower Smith River near the California-Oregon border. LANDS OF THE EAST SIDE\n\nAppreciate the dramatic western skyline of the North Coast Ranges when traveling up the Sacramento Valley to Redding. Snow Mountain’s white\n\nthe north coast\n\n31\n\npeak (7,035 ft.) in the winter announces the beginning of a high mountain crest that merges in the north with the Yolla Bolly Mountains west of Red Bluff (Map 9). Waters of several major streams—Stony, Elder, Thomes, and Cottonwood creeks—tumble down steep slopes (40 percent exceed a 15 percent slope) through deeply incised canyons. The streams then travel through a set of interior valleys between the mountain crest and hogbacks to the east before reaching the lower Sacramento River. Mountainsides are rugged and well forested; subalpine woodlands exist on Mount Linn (8,090 ft.), the highest point in the North Coast. The ridgeline lowers a bit to the north until it reaches the peaks of the North Yolla Bolly Mountains in the Klamath Mountains. Mount Linn, situated on a ridge between Cottonwood and Elder creeks, is east of the crest. Cottonwood Creek flows down from the Yolla Bolly Mountains; Elder, Thomes, and Grindstone creeks drain the central North Coast Ranges, and Stony Creek begins on the southeast side of Snow Mountain. The climate and biota in the foothills have much in common with those of the Central Valley, the Sierra Nevada, and even southern California. Grasslands dotted with large oaks are fenced and lined with “No Trespassing” signs. Chaparral spreads over steep slopes; roadrunners scurry off. This country receives only 18 inches of rain annually, but higher elevations in this one-million-acre area are well watered. These mountains are part of Shasta-Trinity and Mendocino national forests, with sizable tracts of private land in the Elder Creek watershed. Roads are almost all dirt and dusty in the summer. Even SR 162, which connects Willows with US 101, is unpaved through the mountains. The low elevations are home to large ranches, hunting clubs, and parcels administered by the Bureau of Land Management. People have mainly forgotten these lands. They include the distant, western borderlands of Colusa, Glenn, Shasta, and Tehama counties, far from the county seats in the Sacramento Valley. The hamlets of Paskenta and Elk Creek are the only population centers of note. East Park and Stony Gorge reservoirs offer warm-water recreation. Motorcyclists hit foothill trails on the scattered parcels of federal land open to the public. Wilderness enthusiasts take the long, slow roads 35 miles east of Corning and I 5 east to hike the Ides Cove Loop Trail around Mount Lynn for a taste of Yolla Bolly–Middle Eel River Wilderness. Botanists focus on the serpentine treasures at low elevations on the Coast Range ophiolite, another expression of serpentine substrates in northwest California. A good example exists at Frenzel Creek Research Natural Area, a short drive west of the hamlet of Stonyford. Here McNab and Sargent cypress mingle with chaparral and barrens with scattered plants of Snow Mountain buckwheat, Kruckeberg’s jewel flower, and 10 more serpentine rarities.\n\n32\n\nthe north coast\n\nMap 9. Features of the east-side watersheds. The eastern face of the Yolla Bolly Mountains and Coast Ranges are topped by State Route 36 in the north and incomplete State Route 162 west of Willows. An unpaved Forest Service road connects the two portions of State Route 162.\n\nGeologists have much to study. Their descriptions of the North Coast Ranges focus mostly on the two sets of basement rocks, called the Great Valley sequence and Franciscan complex, laid down 65 to 200 million years ago in the Mesozoic Age. These basement rocks occur on opposite sides of the Coast Range Fault, the southern extension of the South Fork Mountain\n\nthe north coast\n\n33\n\nFault. Rocks of the Franciscan complex are west of the fault and extend to the Pacific Ocean. The younger rocks of the Great Valley sequence to the east are beds of mudstones, sandstones, and conglomerates. As sediments from the ancestral Klamath Mountains and Sierra Nevada accumulated from Late Jurassic and Cretaceous times on the outer edge of the developing continental shelf, they became unstable, and the watery mass rushed to ocean depths. Deep-sea fans of sediments in submarine canyons associated with large rivers developed in this way. Sediments on the ocean floor sorted with the finest particles settling last, forming characteristic series of less resistant shale and more resistant sandstones. Today these beds are faulted, folded, and upturned, and they generally trend northwest and incline to the east. Look for the characteristic fossilized clams of the genus Buchia in these beds. The highest and most massive parts of the North Coast, the South Yolla Bolly Mountains, are the most eroded and have the oldest rocks. Lands above 5,500 feet in the North Coast Ranges represent uplifted peneplain surfaces from earlier periods of mountain building. Glaciation was more extensive in the Yolla Bolly Mountains, but glaciers existed locally in their highest valleys and northerly slopes. Devils Basin Research Natural Area is near Paskenta, with excellent black oak forests, and Doll Basin Research Natural Area is near the crest under Buck Rock (6,550 ft.) and has attractive montane forests. A memorable trip to the Beegum Campground shows off an excellent chaparral near Platina, near where Jedediah Smith entered the Klamath Mountains. A trip to Anthony Peak (6,955 ft.) and its lookout will introduce you to one of the many peaks of the North Coast Ranges that supply you with other views. People visit Hull Peak (6,875 ft.) for its plants and good hang gliding. The roads to the trailheads in Snow Mountain and Yolla Bolly–Middle Eel wilderness areas are long and slow, but worth the trip. Popular hikes go up Soldier Ridge and to Hayes Delight on the Eel River. The trails from the Summit Springs trailhead to the peaks of Snow Mountain Wilderness offer dense forests, meadows, open ridges, and views. Deer hunters enjoy these wilderness areas after the heat of summer has cooled. Ecologists find a drive on SR 162 disconcerting. We see the walls of Grindstone Canyon to the north in chaparral, but what are those strange openings on the broad ridges? Grasslands do not belong in that setting (Pl. 9). A stop at the Grindstone Vista Point solves the problem. We learn that the people had created these openings in the chaparral half a century ago by clearing off the “brush” in type conversion projects. They chained, raked, burned the chaparral, and then planted the grasses. The resulting openings offered fire access, increased habitat for deer and quail, and created seasonal pasture for livestock. Today these areas contain Harding grass\n\n34\n\nthe north coast\n\nand other nonnative plants, including star-thistle. Chamise and wedgeleaf ceanothus are slowly reclaiming their own. LANDS OF THE EEL RIVER\n\nTravelers going north of Ukiah on US 101 ascend a steep, unstable section of highway that crests at Ridgeway Summit (1,845 ft.) before continuing on to Willits (Map 10). This crest represents the Russian River–Eel River divide, the southern boundary of the North Coast. Gone are the rows of grapevines; instead, miles of forests and prairies meet the traveler (Pl. 10). These are the lands of the Eel River. They continue almost to Eureka, passing through Laytonville, Garberville, Rio Dell, and, finally, Fortuna. North of Fortuna, an uplifted terrace called Table Bluff separates the Eel River watershed from that of Humboldt Bay. These low hills form a hardly noticeable northern boundary. The crest of the Yolla Bolly Mountains and North\n\nKLAMATH MOUNTAINS IN MORE RECENT TIMES\n\nThe Trinity Alps and Trinity Mountains are the eroded roots of ancient mountains that first rose to great heights in the Mesozoic. Today’s mountains at subalpine elevations contain extensive areas of basement rocks of peridotite and granite. In the Cretaceous, the region was a low landscape, and some areas were covered with marine sediments. Lands above sea level formed a series of offshore islands. Mountains again began to rise as the era ended, only to be eroded to a set of subdued hills in the early Paleogene. At this time, the Klamath and Sacramento rivers were broad, slow-moving streams. At the end of the Paleogene, the land began to rise once again to form still another mountain range. Times were warm, even subtropical in character, with little seasonal variation in temperature. The warmest times came at the end of the Eocene, just before an important drop in temperature during the Oligocene. Now the climates deteriorated in a complicated, stepwise way until the Early Miocene. The new climatic norm for the Neogene was a cooler, temperate one, with more seasonal variation in temperature and precipitation. Temperatures dropped steadily in the Pliocene, harbingering the great ice ages of the Pleistocene. In the late Neogene and into the early parts of the Pleistocene, the mountains were again generally low, and the western lands were near sea level. Still another cycle of mountain building began creating today’s topography. The remaining noneroded remnants of that subdued landscape were uplifted to their present heights as down-cutting rivers shaped new canyons. These eroded remnants of the earlier mountains offered the riches of the gold rush. Miners worked the gold-bearing stream deposits of the Cretaceous (Hornbrook Formation) and Oligocene (Weaverville Formation). The Hornbrook deposits account for the gold rush in the Greenhorn and Scott Bar mountains. The Weaverville deposits\n\nthe north coast\n\n35\n\nCoast Ranges forms the eastern boundary. The western boundary is a set of ridges separating the Eel River watershed from those of the Mattole and Bear rivers and the Pacific Ocean. The watershed is extensive, some 2.35 million acres. Exploring the Eel River country takes some doing. The towns of Willits, Garberville, and Fortuna occur along US 101 and Covelo on the paved portion of SR 162. The much smaller town of Bridgeville, made famous on eBay, straddles SR 36. Other roads are few and far apart considering the size of the drainage; most are unpaved. The Eel River has five sources. The main stem starts just north of Snow Mountain and flows northwest to its convergence with the Middle Fork, which starts in the Yolla Bolly Mountains. The combined stream continues down the main canyon of the Eel, picking up the North Fork and then the South Fork, whose headwaters dwell in the hills to the west of Laytonville at Cahto Peak (4,200 ft.), the rainiest part of the watershed. The western hills receive\n\nnear Weaverville, Hayfork, and Hyampom are associated with lake and stream sediments of a west-flowing river that no longer exists. This last mountain-building period and resulting erosion have rejuvenated the region’s streams. River terraces are 400 feet above Trinity River near Willow Creek. These raised terraces added to the area’s source of gold-bearing gravel, but most miners labored in the placer deposits associated with the modern stream gravels. Winter continues to shape the lands of the Klamath Mountains. The winter traveler becomes aware of not only the weather but also road conditions. Winter storms bring high water and, in some years, floods. Lands at higher elevations fill with deep snowpacks. Then there are the landslides. Mass wasting, the moving of soil and rock (debris) under the pull of gravity, is very much a part of life in the mountains. Geologists recognize flows, where debris moves as a fluid; slides, where it moves in mass; and falls, where it falls freely. Strong relief, especially with steep slopes, a thick overburden, bedrock with down-trending planes of weakness, and severe weather conditions encourage mass wasting. It also can be triggered by earthquakes and the undercutting of the slopes by rivers and road building. Rock fall is predictable throughout the region, occurring especially after the first autumn rains. Slides are common, especially on the Bigfoot Highway as it travels along the lower Trinity and Klamath rivers where the canyon walls involve highly sheared rock. Slides can be more than a nuisance by closing highways for hours or days. Some slides stop the flow of mighty rivers, even if for only a short time. The 985-feet-deep China Slide, along the Trinity River Highway just east of Burnt Ranch, choked the canyon in February 1890. The temporary lake was more than seven miles long. A century later, highway bypasses miss the unstable slopes east of Salyer on SR 299 and on the canyon of the Eel River’s south fork on US 101.\n\n36\n\nthe north coast\n\nMap 10. Features of Eel River country. Only State Routes 36 and 162 offer ways to get to higher lands of the Eel. Most county and Forest Service roads are unpaved.\n\n55 to 115 inches annually; the eastern hills, 35 to 85 inches. Downstream, the Van Duzen River joins the Eel before it enters the ocean. The headwaters of the North Fork and Van Duzen River start in the highlands associated with a western extension of South Fork Mountain called the Lassics. Lands surrounding the Eel River are spacious, with only 45 percent of the slopes exceeding 15 percent. Round Valley and the smaller Little, Eden, and Hettenpon valleys break up the intricate maze of ridges, summits, rocks, and low mountains that characterize the watershed. The rounded ridges\n\nthe north coast\n\n37\n\nhave moderately steep sides, and the canyons are narrow. The elongated ridges extend northwesterly, with their highest summits in the southeast. The watershed is more prone to landslides than any other area in the state. Experienced winter travelers ask, “Will we make it by the Confusion Hill slide?” The Eel River landscape is, to a great extent, the result of rock types of the Franciscan complex—dense mudstone called argillite, chert, metamorphosed basalt called greenstone, and a dark gray, fine-grained sandstone called graywacke. The beds of mudstone and graywacke, 0.5 to 10 feet thick, are the result of turbidity currents. The same process created the rocks of the Central Valley sequence. As sediments thicken, some become buried and subjected to high pressures at low temperatures, creating a distinctive metamorphic rock type called blueschist. Areas of blueschist are local in the regional matrix of mudstones and graywackes. Blueschist is notoriously unstable when soaked by winter rains, especially after we build roads through it. Large expanses of the Eel River and other North Coast watersheds have sheared and crushed fine-grained mudstones and shales that contain outcrops of resistant rocks of many different sizes, some of them quite large. The jumble is a product of two plates grinding and mixing rocks, creating a mélange (mixture) of continental slope and deep-ocean deposits, and pieces of continental crust and mantle, likened to ice cream containing various kinds of nuts. The weathered surface layers of highly sheared and crushed shales and mudstones (the “ice cream”) creep downslope with the help of gravity, especially when saturated with material from winter storms. Daily freeze-and-thaw cycles encourage creep when the material is wet. A more dramatic form of movement (earthflows) involves a flowing mass of debris that pulls away from the stationary upper slope, leaving a scarp. Creep and earthflows create hummocky terrain, from which the rock outcrops (the “nuts”) of blueschist, chert, greenstone, limestone, and serpentine fragments of the Coast Range ophiolite protrude from the mudstones and shales. The age and origin of the outcrop rocks found in the mélange are problematic, but some are much older than Jurassic, and they were transported great distances on the Pacific Plate. In geological parlance, they are “exotic rocks.” Common along SR 39 and US 101, these outcrops often receive distinctive names, such as Camel Rock. Geologists recognize three belts of Franciscan rocks, each with its own set of terranes separated by faults. The eastern belt is oldest and consists mainly of blueschist, graywacke, and schist. The central belt contains several kinds of mélange. The coastal belt, involving four different terranes, contains mainly beds of graywacke and shale. It also has the youngest rocks, including ones laid down as late as the Paleogene (the earlier part of the Tertiary including the Paleocene, Eocene, and Oligocene). Still-younger rocks exist near the coast.\n\n38\n\nthe north coast\n\nThe grandest watershed on the North Coast offers more than just geology. There are six venues here to give you a complete redwood experience. The largest, Humboldt Redwoods State Park, introduces visitors to the world of redwood forests. The first stop should be Rockefeller Forest and the alluvial terraces along Bull Creek. Here, more than elsewhere, the lofty trees create the feeling of a great cathedral. These properly world-famous giants contrast with the shorter trees on the slopes of nearby Grasshopper Peak (3,200 ft.). More intimate groves at Grizzly Creek Redwoods State Park, along the Van Duzen River, and at Admiral William Standley State Recreation Area, Richardson Grove State Park, and Smithe Redwoods State Reserve offer other facets of redwood landscape to enjoy. Private lands outside the parks are extensive. Large cattle ranches, small isolated parcels, and nonindustrial timberlands make up the interior. Ownership along the coast changes to the industrial timberlands of the Mendocino Redwood Company and Pacific Lumber Company. Terraces of the lower Eel River are committed to agriculture, especially dairying and ranching. Observe the common “No Trespassing” signs. Many of these interior parcels hide marijuana gardens. The owners intensively protect these properties; stay on the roads, and respect owner rights. Fortunately, unsigned portions of the watershed exist in a number of federally owned roadless areas. Several special management areas in Six Rivers National Forest occur in the North Fork portion of the watershed. Lassics Botanical Area is a montane island of 5,800-foot peaks and serpentine substrates in a “sea” of Franciscan sediments. Thomas Nelson’s studies draw botanists to visit the area for its 17 rare plants, including 3 found nowhere else. Soldier Research Natural Area, near Hettenshaw Valley, has excellent Oregon white oak woodlands. The small, privately landlocked North Fork Wilderness and the western portion of the sizable Yolla Bolly–Middle Eel Wilderness are nearby. Sanhedrin Mountain and Yuki proposed wilderness areas, involving both Mendocino National Forest and Bureau of Land Management lands, are south and northwest of Lake Pillsbury. Red Mountain, a patch of serpentine substrates near the community of Legget, is another hot spot of serpentine plants. It is managed jointly by the Bureau of Land Management, California Fish and Game, and private landowners. The federally listed McDonald rock cress, which also inhabits serpentine substrates in the upper Smith River country, grows here. Outstanding old-growth forest exists along the South Fork at the Heath and Marjorie Angelo Coast Range Reserve. Established in 1959, it was the first project by The Nature Conservancy in the state, and it became part of the University of California Natural Reserve System in 1994. The Bureau of Land Management’s contiguous Elder Creek Watershed Area of Critical Environmental Concern added acreage to the protected area. The reserve lands are open for public use.\n\nthe north coast\n\n39\n\nMap 11. Features of Mattole–Bear river country. County roads, mostly paved, lead to Petrolia or Shelter Cove.\n\nLANDS OF THE MATTOLE AND BEAR RIVERS\n\nThe country of the Mattole and Bear rivers includes the Lost Coast, the longest completely undeveloped shoreline in California (Map 11). The Lost Coast stretches for 90 miles from the mouth of the Mattole River in King Range Recreation Area to the southernmost part of Sinkyone Wilderness State Park. North of the Mattole River, the coastline has but a single county road, Mattole Road, that winds through ranches from Ferndale to Petrolia and on to Honeydew. Views shift back and forth among cattle grazing on the grassy hillsides, rocky headlands, sea stacks, and isolated beaches (Pl. 11). This road involves the famous Tour of the Unknown\n\n40\n\nthe north coast\n\nCoast, a very scenic century (a 100-mile bicycle ride) held annually in May. These lands are just east of the Mendocino Triple Junction. The lands of the Mattole and Bear rivers form a small (320,000-acre) but distinctive watershed west of the Eel River’s south fork. Bear Ridge (2,615 ft.) to the north, Gilham Butte (2,780 ft.), related knobs to the east, and Point Delgada to the south function as the watershed’s eastern boundary. Usal Creek and other smaller streams south of Point Delgada drain the headlands as far south as Cape Vizcaino. We might call Petrolia and Shelter Cove the towns of the area. Bear River begins on Bear Ridge and flows directly west to the ocean. Mattole River begins near Gilham Butte and on northern slopes of King Peak (4,090 ft.). Streams south of the peak drain westerly, directly into the\n\nMENDOCINO TRIPLE JUNCTION\n\nThe northern coast of California and its adjacent offshore lands experience more earthquakes each year than any other part of the state. People on the North Coast have lived through 60 damaging earthquakes in the last 150 years, which translates into one every 2.5 years. Geologists refer to the lands off Cape Mendocino where the North American, Pacific, and Gorda plates meet as the Mendocino Triple Junction (Figure 1). This geological feature formed 30 million years ago, far south in Baja California, when an ocean-spreading center in the Pacific plate collided with the continent’s edge. Since then, the San Andreas Fault has replaced this previous subduction zone boundary. As the San Andreas Fault grew, this point shifted to the northwest as the Pacific plate (to the west) passed the North American plate (to the east). During earthquakes the plates moved, grinding and abrading their edges, which created zones of intensely shattered rock. Rocks west of the San Andreas Fault are similar to those of the Sierra Nevada, but they originated near the latitude of Central America. Today these rocks exist as far north as Point Arena. From there to the Mendocino Triple Junction, where the San Andreas Fault ends, the rocks on both sides of the fault are Franciscan rock types. Understanding the geology of the North Coast also involves the effects of the Cascadia Subduction Zone. North of the Mendocino Triple Junction, the Gorda plate plunges under the North American plate into this subduction zone. The associated magmatic arc of Cascade volcanoes extends from Mount Lassen in northern California to Mount Meager in southern British Columbia. Many volcanoes have had active periods from the late Neogene and Quaternary. Mount Lassen erupted several times from 1914 to 1921. The eruption of Mount Saint Helens in 1980 was only the last of many events changing the landscape of the Pacific Northwest. The effect of these volcanoes was less dramatic on the lands of northwest California than on the lands to the east. Lava covered some easternmost rocks of the Eastern Trinity Terrane, but most of the ash went to the east with the prevailing westerlies. Earthquake activity associated with both the Cascadia Subduction Zone\n\nthe north coast\n\n41\n\nocean. King Peak crowns the highest seaside mountain range in the continental United States.
