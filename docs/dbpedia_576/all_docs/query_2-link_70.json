Sir : In obedience to instructions from the War Department, I have the honor to submit the accompanying report of the exploration and survey in California and Oregon, conducted by Lieutenant R. S. Williamson, United States Topographical Engineers, in 1855. The prepara¬ tion of the report has devolved upon me, in consequence of the severe and protracted illness of Lieutenant Williamson ; and it is due to myself to state that I have performed the duty with extreme reluctance, partly because it was not originally designed for me by the Department, and partly because it properly belongs to tlio officer by whose forethought and professional ability the expedition has been brought to a successful termination. Wishing to convey Lieutenant Williamson’s ideas, as far as they are known to me, I have been guided by his recorded field notes, and by his opinions expressed to me in conversation, in preparing the portion of the report which relates to regions traversed by him. During a part of the field work I was entrusted with a separate party, with instructions to prepare a written report of the results of my examinations. For any opinion given in this portion of the report he, of course, is not responsible. At the completion of the survey for a railroad route from the Sacramento valley to the Columbia river, the season was so far advanced and the animals were in so jaded condition, that Lieutenant Williamson considered it impracticable to make any examination of the Sierra Nevada until the ensuing spring. Before that time, orders were received from the War Department, directing him to return at once to Washington to prepare the maps, profiles, and reports of the explora¬ tion already made. The second survey contemplated in his original instructions was consequently omitted. At Lieutenant Williamson’s request, I have prepared a full statement of the method used in deducing altitudes from the barometric observations. For unpublished and very valuable inform¬ ation on this subject, I am indebted to Captain A. W. Whipple, United States Topographical Engineers. I should do injustice to Lieutenant Williamson, if I did not express his high appreciation of the energy and ability with which the officers of the escort, and the civilian assistants, labored to advance the objects of the exploration. Of those who accompanied me when detached from the main command, I feel at liberty to speak in less general terms. Lieutenant Crook, who was the only officer with me, officially and personally contributed, in a high degree, to the success and to the harmony of the expedition. Mr. Fillebrown and Mr. Young, although suffering from severe attacks of intermittent fever, and deprived of the services of a physician, willingly continued with the party, and discharged their accustomed duties with energy and accuracy. The masterly sketches of views upon the route, and the characteristic style of the topography upon the accompanying maps, testify to the professional skill of Mr. Young. Mr. Anderson, who was my only scientific assistant in some of the most difficult and perplexing portions of the survey, aided me in every way in his power. To him, and to Mr. Fillebrown, the government is chiefly indebted for the numerous barometric observa- 4 LETTER TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR. tions taken upon the routes explored. Dr. Newberry was only attached to my command for a few days, as he proceeded by water from Fort Dalles to San Francisco, where lie remained until the completion of the held work. While waiting in that city he zealously occupied himself in making a large and valuable zoological collection. His reports speak for themselves. The great energy which Mr. Coleman displayed in discharging the laborious duties of chief of train, is worthy of the highest praise. Had it not been for his continued and untiring exertions, many of our animals must have been lost in crossing the Cascade mountains. To the men of the topographical party generally, much commendation is due. Although deprived of the protection of an escort, and of the services of a physician, to both of which they were entitled by the terms of their agree¬ ment, they, with hardly an exception, faithfully performed their duties until the end of the survey. I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant, HENRY L. ABBOT, 2 d Lieut. U. S. Topographical Engineers. Hon. John B. Floyd, Secretary of War. GENERAL TABLE OF CONTENTS INTRODUCTION.

War Department, Washington, May 1, 1855. Sir: The following duties are assigned to you, under the appropriations for continuing explo¬ rations and surveys to ascertain the most practicable and economical route for a railroad from the Mississippi river to the Pacific ocean, and for military and geographical surveys west of the Mississippi. 1. To make such explorations and surveys as will determine the practicability, or otherwise, of connecting the Sacramento valley, in California, with the Columbia river, Oregon Territory, by a railroad, either by the Willamette valley, or (if this route should prove to be impracti¬ cable) by the valley of Des Chutes river, near the foot slopes of the Cascade-chain. Along Des Chutes river the character of the country is such as to render it improbable that a practicable route can be found. 2. To make the necessary examinations and surveys to determine if a route practicable for a railroad exists crossing the Sierra Nevada, at or near the source of Carson river. This may furnish the most direct railroad route from San Francisco to the Great Salt Lake. The duty first assigned you having been completed, you will ascertain from the commanding officer, Lieut. Col. Steptoe, and others of the troops that may have crossed the Great Basin from Great Salt Lake and the Sierra Nevada, by the route near the sources of Carson river, all the details necessary to a knowledge of the character of the route traversed by them ; and should the information which you may have gathered lead to the opinion that the route is practicable for a railroad, or that such route may be found in that region, you will proceed to make the examinations and surveys necessary to ascertain if such be the case. It will not, probably, be necessary to extend this examination beyond the eastern foot of the Sierra Nevada. If you should not require the services of all your party, for this latter duty, you will direct such of your assistants as will not be wanted for the field, to proceed to Washington, with Lieut. Abbot, and under his direction prepare the maps and reports ; or you may direct Lieut. Abbot, aided by the geologist and civil engineer, or such assistants as may be necessary, to make the examination, proceeding yourself to Washington with the other assistants. The geological information is considered especially valuable in determining the character of the country, the nature of the difficulties to be encountered, and the (quality and extent of the building materials to be found. Your attention will be directed to the botany and natural history of the country, and to such other objects as tend to illustrate its qiresent and future conditions. To execute these orders, you are authorized to employ the following assistants, viz : a geolo¬ gist, a civil engineer, a computer, a draughtsman, and a physician, who will, at the same time, perform the duties of naturalist or geologist, if an assistant surgeon cannot be assigned to duty with the escort, at rates not exceeding those proposed by you in your estimate. They will receive, besides their stipulated compensation, the actual cost of transportation to and from the field, if the journeys or voyages have been actually performed, and they will have the privilege, while in the field, of purchasing from the subsistence department such provisions as may be necessary for their subsistence. 2 X 10 INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE WAR DEPARTMENT. You are also authorized to employ such hands, packers, &c., as may he necessary; to purchase such of the instruments, named in your estimate, as cannot he obtained from the Topographical Bureau, and such smaller instruments, maps, hooks, camp and garrison equipage, animals, quartermaster’s stores, provisions, &c., as may he necessary to the successful accomplishment of the objects of the expedition. The commanding officer of the Pacific Department will be directed to furnish you with an escort of (100) one hundred men, with not less than three regimental officers and an assistant surgeon, if one can be spared from other duty, one of the former to act as commissary and quartermaster to the party ; and to instruct the commanding officer of the escort to afford you such aid and assistance as will most tend to facilitate your operations. A large escort will be required to protect the exploring party in Oregon, but in the subsequent part of your surveys it may be diminished. Lieutenant Henry L. Abbot, Topographical Engineers, will be ordered to report to you for duty. The colonel of the Corps of Topographical Engineers will direct that such of the instruments named in your requisition, as are in depot at the Topographical Bureau, or at Benicia, Cali¬ fornia, and not required for other service, be supplied to you. The quartermaster’s department will furnish you with horses, mules, equipments, and such other public property as may be needed for the use of the expedition, if they can be spared ; which will be returned to that department upon the completion of the field duties, payment being made for such animals as may have been lost, or as may be found unfit for use, and other public property lost or seriously damaged. The commissary department will furnish you with such provisions and stores, if they can be spared, as you may need for the use of the expedition, to be paid for out of the appropriations for the survey, at cost prices at the place of delivery. The ordnance department will furnish arms, accoutrements, and a mountain artillery forge, payment to be made for such arms, &c., as are lost or seriously injured. You are authorized to purchase, for the purpose of trafficking with the Indians and compen¬ sating them for services, such articles of Indian goods as are most desirable for such purposes, provided the expenditures for these articles do not exceed ($300) three hundred dollars. The sum of ($42,000) forty-two thousand dollars is set apart from the appropriations for the expenses of the survey entrusted to you. With your assistants you will proceed without unnecessary delay to San Francisco, and there organize your party, unless upon your arrival you should ascertain that it would be preferable to organize it in Oregon ; in which case you will proceed to Vancouver, and organize your party at the most suitable point to commence the survey from the Willamette valley. The duties assigned to you being completed, you will discharge your party, dispose of your outfit to the best advantage, and proceed with your principal assistants to this place, and make out your report. Should the views of the department be modified, you will receive further instructions. You will make the usual monthly reports of the work done ; and, besides, advise the depart¬ ment from time to time of the progress made in, and the results of the explorations. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, JEFFERSON DAVIS. Secretary of War. Lieut. R. S. Williamson, Corps Topographical Engineers , Washington. INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE WAR DEPARTMENT. 11 Office Pacific Railroad Surveys, Washington, May 1, 1855. Sir : By direction of tlie Secretary of War, you will report to Lieut. R. S. Williamson, Topo¬ graphical Engineers, for duty on the explorations and surveys in California and Oregon, with which he is charged. It is understood that you are second in rank of the party, and that, if sickness or any acci¬ dent should disable Lieut. Williamson, so as to oblige him to relinquish the command, you will succeed to the charge and command of the party. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, Lieut. Henry L. Abbot, Corps Topographical Engineers. A. A. HUMPHREYS, Captain Corps Top. Engineers, In charge of office for Pacific Railroad Surveys. SYSTEM ADOPTED IN PREPARING THE REPORT. In preparing the report of the explorations and surveys, made in accordance with the above orders, I have adopted the following system : Part I contains the general report, divided into seven chapters ; of which the first contains a general description of the different regions traversed during the survey. This synopsis has been prepared partly to enable those wishing merely to obtain a general idea of the country, to dispense with reading a mass of details, and partly to render the railroad report more intelligible. The second chapter is devoted entirely to a discussion of the facilities offered for the construction of a railroad near the lines of survey. The third, fourth, and fifth chapters contain a narrative and itinerary of the expedition. An attempt has been made to give, in this portion of the report, a detailed description of the nature of the country examined ; of the supply of wood, water, and grass near the trails ; of the character of the Indian tribes ; and of various other matters, interesting to those who wish to thoroughly understand the character of the regions explored. The sixth chapter contains a statement of the method used in computing altitudes from observations taken with the barometer. The seventh chapter contains an account of a former exploration of Lieut. Williamson, near a portion of our line of survey. Parts II, III, and IV, contain geological, botanical, and zoological reports upon the regions explored. The various appendices exhibit, in a tabular form, the astronomical and barometric observa¬ tions, with the results deduced from them by computation. MAPS ACCOMPANYING THE REPORT. Two maps, constructed upon the polyconic projection, have been made to accompany this report. The first illustrates that portion of the survey which lay in California, and the second that in Oregon. The scale of each is one inch to twelve miles, or 1:760320. The data, upon which these maps have been constructed, will be briefly stated. The distances 12 MAPS ACCOMPANYING THE REPORT. travelled were measured by an odometer, until tlie wheels were necessarily abandoned among the Cascade mountains ; and then carefully estimated from the time and supposed rate of travel. The courses were determined by prismatic compasses. The latitudes of a large majority of the camps were fixed with considerable accuracy by astronomical observations. Several camps before camp 17 were connected with San Francisco by chronometric differences, and the longi¬ tude thus approximately determined. An unfortunate accident, in Canoe Creek valley, however, rendered the chronometers worthless for this purpose during the remainder of the survey, and compelled us to depend upon our courses and distances, checked by the latitudes of the camps, and by a system of triangulation among the prominent mountain peaks near the trail. The assumed longitudes of a few important points upon the route seem to require particular ex¬ planation. As Fort Reading was the point from which we started to leave the settlements, great care has been taken to determine its longitude as correctly as possible. Col. J. C. Fremont, on his map of California and Oregon, places the point of Cow Creek, upon which the fort is now situated, in Long. 122° 6' 50\" west from Greenwich. On the Land Office map of 1855, it is placed in Long. 122° 11' 9\". On the map of Lieut. E. G. Beckwith, 3d artillery, illustrating his exploration for a Pacific railroad route near the 41s.t parallel of north latitude, it is placed in Long. 122° 5' 8\". The four chronometers used on our survey apparently preserved their rates unchanged during our march up the Sacramento valley, as they all agreed very well with each other. The longitude of the fort, determined by their mean corrected difference from local time, was 122° 10' 50\". As this differs only three-tentlis of a mile from that given by the Land Office map, it has been adojffed as correct. It places the fort 3.5 miles west of Col. Fremont’s location, and 5 miles west of that of Lieut. Beckwith. The following method has been adopted to fix the longitude near the northern terminus of the survey. The longitude of Salem has been determined with considerable care, under the direc¬ tion of the surveyor general of the Territory, both by astronomical observations and by measuring a line to the coast, and thus comparing the result with the work of the United States Coast Survey. It is 122° 53' 43\" west from Greenwich, as I was informed, when at Salem, by Mr. Hervey Gordon, deputy surveyor. He also told me that Mount Hood and Mount Jefferson had been carefully located by bearings taken from well determined points with the solar compass. I therefore made a preliminary plot of the northern portion of our survey, based upon the Land Office positions of these peaks as fixed points. As over fifty bearings had been taken to each mountain, many of which were from points where the latitude was astronomically determined, I was enabled to slightly correct the relative position of the two peaks. The map was next replotted with respect to these new positions. The result was highly satisfactory, as the compass work fitted admirably, and the longitudes of two points in Des Chutes valley, determined by Col. Fremont in 1843, by observing the occultations of Jupiter’s satellites, were almost precisely the same as those of the corresponding points on the plot. It is thought that this coincidence renders it very improbable that any important error in longitude has been made. The latitude of Fort Dalles was astronomically determined, and numerous bearings upon Mount Hood and the neighboring peaks enabled me to fix its longitude very closely. It was 120° 58' 30\". This location is about three miles west of that found by Col. Fremont, by observing an emersion of Jupiter’s second satellite, on November 5, 1843. He afterwards observed the emersion of Jupiter’s third satellite, on November 20, 1843, at the same spot, and published the data obtained, without, however, giving the deduced longitude. I find, by computation, MAPS ACCOMPANYING THE REPORT. 13 that this is about 121° 22' 19\", which differs more than twenty miles from that deduced from the first observation. I have, therefore, adhered to the longitude given by my field work, which- is intermediate between the two, hut much nearer that to which Col. Fremont has given the preference. The longitude of Fort Vancouver has been laid down as given on the latest Land Office map of Oregon Territory, because detailed surveys have been made between the fort and Salem, the position of which, as already explained, has been determined with approximate accuracy. This location of Fort Vancouver is about seven miles east of that of Capt. Wilkes, whose longitude has been adopted by Col. Fremont on his map of Oregon and California, and by Captain McClellan. Considerable difficulty has been found in locating the Cascades of the Columbia with respect to longitude. Gov. Stevens adopted the position given by Capt. Wilkes, which is 21 miles further towards the west than that of Col. Fremont, who observed an occultation of Jupiter’s first satellite, on November 11, 1843, at a point estimated at 15 miles below the Cascades. There is now a line of steamboats plying from Vancouver to the Cascades, and thence to Fort Dalles. Capt. W. B. Wells, the chief proprietor of the line, and all other persons whom I questioned about the matter, declared that the Cascades were about equally distant from Van¬ couver and the Dalles, by the course of the river. Col. Fremont has so indicated it upon his map ; hut Capt. Wilkes makes the distance from the Cascades to the Dalles nearly double that from the Cascades to Vancouver. Considering the great discrepancies between these two authorities, and believing that the many hundred trips of the steamboats must have enabled the owner to estimate the comparative distances with tolerable accuracy, I have placed, on the accompanying map, the Cascades midway between Vancouver and Fort Dalles by the course of the river. This location is 10 miles west of that of Col. Fremont and 11 miles east of that of Capt. Wilkes. I have indicated on the map, positions for Mount Adams and Mount St. Helen’s — the former given by eight and the latter by six good hearings from well determined points in the Des Chutes and Willamette valleys, and among the Cascade mountains. Each of these positions differs about 12 miles from that given by Gov. Stevens. It has been considered desirable to make the maps as complete as possible, by indicating the topography of the country remote from our trail, whenever reliable information as to its char¬ acter could be obtained. The Pacific coast has, therefore, been laid down as given on the latest United States Coast Survey maps. The most recent Land Office maps of Oregon and California have been adopted as authority for the settled portion of the country, except in the vicinity of our trails, where the topography is, of course, given from our own field notes, checked by astronomical observations. The map of Lieut. E. G. Beckwith, 3d artillery, illustrating his explorations for a railroad route near the 41st parallel of north latitude, has been followed for the region bordering Pit river, below the mouth of Canoe creek. The topography south of Suisun Bay has been taken from the map of a survey in California, made, in connection with examinations for railroad routes to the Pacific ocean, by Lieut. K. S. Williamson, Topographical Engineers, in 1853. Summer lake, the northern and western shores of Upper Klamath lake, the chief tributary of Klamath marsh, and the Columbia river, east of the Dalles, have been laid down as given by Colonel J. C. Frdmont on his map of Oregon and Upper California. 14 MAPS ACCOMPANYING THE REPORT. From Myrtle creek, in Umpqua valley, to Jacksonville, in Rogue River valley, our field work lias been checked by a sketch of the military road, located in 1853 by Brevet Major B. Alvord, 4th infantry. This sketch, which I think was never published, was kindly furnished by Major Alvord. The trail of Brevet Major II. W. Wessels, 2d infantry, on his expedition of 1852, from Sonoma to Humboldt Bay, and thence up Klamath river to the head of Scott’s river, has been, laid down from a rough copy of a sketch by George Gibbs, Esq., who accompanied the command as topographer. The topography near Rogue river, for about twenty-five miles above the mouth, has been taken from a sketch made by Lieut. J. G. Chandler, 3d artillery, to show the routes followed by the command of Brevet Lieut. Col. R. C. Buchanan, 4th infantry, during his campaign against the Indians in 1856. I am indebted to Colonel Buchanan for this sketch, which is now published for the first time. Lieut. Williamson formerly spent several years in California, attached to the staff of the commanding general. During this time he made many reconnaissances, the results of which were never published. Several of the trails have been laid down on our map from his original field notes. The latitudes of many points were fixed by astronomical observations, and the accuracy of the topography may be relied upon. They form a valuable addition to the map. His route from Yreka to Lower Klamath lake was surveyed in 1852, and that from Yreka, east of Shasta Butte, to the Sacramento valley, in 1851. The trail from Port Orford to Coquille and Rogue rivers, and thence to the settled portion of Rogue River valley, was examined in 1851 and 1852. A small portion of this trail was explored by Lieut. George Stoneman, 1st dragoons. In 1849, Lieut. Williamson accompanied Captain W. H. Warner, Topographical Engineers, on the disastrous expedition on which he was killed by the Indians, near Goose lake. Lieut. Williamson prepared a map of the regions traversed, and the upper portion of Pit river, with the vicinity, has been reduced from the original sketch upon our map. PROFILES ACCOMPANYING THE REPORT. Two sheets of profiles have been constructed to illustrate this report. They contain profiles of the most important portions of the routes travelled over by the surveying parties, and also of the most favorable railroad lines found in the vicinity of the trails. The horizontal scale of each profile is the same as that of the maps, being twelve miles to the inch, or 1:160320 ; the vertical scale is 1:15206.4. They are, therefore, distorted fifty times. The altitudes of the different stations were all determined by barometric observations. The method by which they have been computed is fully explained in the sixth chapter of this report, and the original data are given in Appendix D. It only remains to notice discrepancies between the results of this survey and those of former surveys with which it connects. Gov. Stevens gives 51.6 feet for the altitude of Columbia barracks above the level of the sea. That the fort should not be higher than this above the Columbia appeared incredible to me when there ; and as it is situated nearly 100 miles above the mouth of the river, there can be, I think, no doubt that this altitude is too low. The height of Lieut. Williamson’s camp, situated upon the river bluff opposite the barracks, and sixty feet above the water surface, was shown, by numerous observations, to be 105 feet. 1 have been unable to find, in any part of Gov. Stevens’ report, the height of Fort Dalles. The altitude of 350 feet, however, is given in the Army Meteorological Register as that PROFILES ACCOMPANYING THE REPORT. 15 determined upon his survey. The altitude of the fort, resulting from our observations, is 476 feet. No correction for abnormal error appears to have been applied to Gov. Stevens’ observa¬ tions ; and this omission would very naturally explain larger discrepancies. Our altitude of Fort Beading differs 157 feet from that of Lieut. Beckwith ; and as he had only six observations there, while we had a very large number, I think there can be no doubt that ours is the more reliable result. There are a few other discrepancies in altitudes deduced from his observations and ours, hut none that might not be easily occasioned by abnormal oscillation, for which he was unable to obtain any correction in this vicinity. The general agreement between the results of the two surveys, is highly satisfactory. _ / PART I. 3 X <«> / *1 I EXPLORATIONS AND SURVEYS FOR A RAILROAD ROUTE FROM THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN.

GENERAL TOPOGRAPHY. There is a great similarity in the general topographical features of the whole Pacific slope. The Sierra Nevada in California, and the Cascade Range in Oregon and Washington Terri¬ tories, form a continuous wall of mountains nearly parallel to the coast, and from one to two hundred miles distant from it. Where examined by our party, the main crest of this range is rarely elevated less than 6,000 feet above the level of the sea; and many of its peaks tower into the region of eternal snow, the lower limit of which is about 8,000 feet above the same level. This long chain of mountains forms a great natural boundary. To the eastward lies a plateau of which the average altitude is about 4,500 feet above the sea. The winds from the ocean deposit most of their moisture upon the western slope of the mountains, and reach the plateau dry. This, together with the volcanic character of the country, renders nearly the whole region an arid waste, unfit to support a civilized population. West of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Ranges, the character of the country is widely different. The Coast Range, another and parallel chain of mountains, but of a lesser altitude and of a more broken nature, borders the sea-shore. Between the two lie several large fertile valleys, elevated but slightly above the sea, and containing nearly all the arable land of the far west ; of these valleys, the San Joaquin and Tulare, the Sacramento, the Willamette, the Umpqua, the Rogue river, and the Cowlitz are the chief ; but the Gulf of California itself may be con¬ sidered one of the great series, probably produced by a common cause, and differing from the rest only in being submerged. In northern California and southern Oregon, the two great parallel chains of mountains approach each other ; and several ranges, the chief of 'which are called the Siskiyou, the Ump¬ qua, and the Calapooya mountains, connect them, thus separating the Sacramento and Willa¬ mette valleys by a line of transverse ridges. These ridges present the only serious obstacle to the construction of a railroad from the Sacramento valley to the Columbia river. Two routes between these termini were examined by our party. The first crossed the western chain of the Sierra Nevada at the head of the Sacramento valley, and, after passing over the comparatively level plateau of the interior until the transverse ridges had been turned, re-crossed the moun¬ tains near the source of the Willamette river, and followed the valley of that stream to the Columbia. The second lay over the transverse ridges. A general description of the region traversed by each of the routes will occupy the remainder of the chapter. 4 X 26 GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE REGIONS EXAMINED. SACRAMENTO VALLEY. No complete description of this valley will he attempted, as its general character is well known, and as Lieutenant Williamson, in his Railroad Report, has fully discussed its topo¬ graphical features. A few remarks, however, relating to its climate and productions, may not he out of place. Sheltered by the Coast Range of mountains from the moist and cool sea breezes, which render the summer climate of the sea-shore of northern California so delightful, much of the Sacra¬ mento valley is parched with excessive heat in the dry season. From the Army Meteorological Register, it appears that, at Benicia, where the influence of the sea breeze is felt, the mean summer temperature, for the years 1852, ’53, ’54, was 66°. 3 Fah., while at Fort Reading, which is about two degrees of latitude further north, it was ’79°. 6 Fah., for the same years. Even at San Diego, situated seven degrees of latitude south of Fort Reading, the mean summer temperature was only 70°. 9 Fah., for the above mentioned years. The effect of this excessively high summer temperature is greatly increased by the want of rain. Very little falls during the months of June, July, August, September, and October. The mean fall, during these five months, for the years 1852, ’53, ’54, was 1.1 inches at Benicia, and 1.4 inches at Fort Reading. This tends to show that less than three-tenths of an inch of rain per month, for the five consecutive hottest months of the year, is to he expected in this valley. The result can he easily anticipated. Vegetation, except on the banks of the streams, is in a great measure destroyed, and the foliage of the trees furnishes almost the only green upon which the eye of the traveller can rest, when wearied with the glare of the sun, reflected hack from the whitened plains. During the rainy months, which are December, January, February, March, and April, the average fall is between 3 and 4 inches per month. The whole region is then clothed with luxuriant vegetation ; hut the excess of rain often causes the streams to overflow their hanks, and spread far and wide over the low lands. Much of this water remains stagnant, until evaporated by the heat of the sun, which is undoubtedly one of the causes that render inter¬ mittent fever so great a scourge of the valley. Notwithstanding this unfavorable climate, the richness and fertility of the soil well repay the farmer for his labor ; and fine crops of barley, wheat, oats, potatoes, onions, &c., can be easily raised. A luxuriant growth of wild oats covers a large portion of the valley, and gives it an appearance of high cultivation. Grapes, which are a natural product, are also one of the very important staples of the region. The forest trees, which, in the valley, are confined to the banks of the streams, are chiefly oaks, sycamores, and cotton-woods. The foot hills of the Sierra Nevada are densely timbered with various species of oaks, pines, and firs. PIT RIVER AND ITS TRIBUTARIES. In 1849, Lieutenant Williamson accompanied Captain W. H. Warner, United States Topo¬ graphical Engineers, on his ill-fated expedition to the sources of Pit river. As this was the only survey of this region which has ever been made, and as its results were never fully published, Lieutenant Williamson proposed to give a synopsis of them in this report. I have, therefore, compiled from his original field notes the following very brief description of the upper portion of Pit river. A short distance above camp 23, where, in 1855, the party left Pit river, the stream passes GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE REGIONS EXAMINED. 27 through a broad cafion. The trail, which is a little rocky, follows its course, crossing it about a dozen times. In about 20 miles, the canon widens out into a valley, varying from 3 to 12 miles in width, which extends to the vicinity of Goose lake. In some places, travelling is rendered laborious by cracks in the soil, which is very light and dusty, hut the road is generally good. The region is not fertile, and grass is mostly confined to the hanks of the river. The party discovered a boiling spring about 6 miles above the upper end of the wide canon, and at some little distance from the river, on its western hank. The basin was about twelve feet wide, and in the middle a jet three feet in diameter boiled up six inches above the general level. No gas escaped, but a slight smell of sulphur was perceptible. A column of vapor, thirty feet in height, ascended from the spring. Its waters were impregnated with salts, but no deposit was observed. Near Goose lake, Pit river rises from springs in the hills, and does not issue from the lake, as has sometimes been supposed. Much obsidian is found near its sources. While exploring the mountains in this vicinity, Captain Warner and others of the party were massacred by the Indians, and the survey terminated abruptly ia consequence. The portion of Pit river lying between Camp 23 and the mouth of Canoe creek, was examined on the recent survey. The whole region is volcanic in its character, and descends by successive plateaus towards the western chain of the Sierra Nevada. Each of the two great canons is situated near the edge of one of these plateaus, and the descent of the stream is, consequently, very much greater in them than elsewhere in its course. From the summit of Stoneman’s ridge, this peculiar terraced formation of the country can be very distinctly perceived. The descent of the tributaries, both from the north and the south, is very rapid. Much of the region south of Pit river, lying at the eastern base of the western chain of the Sierra Nevada, consists of a rocky pedregal of scoriaceous trap, and Lieut. Williamson, who, in 1851, explored the country immediately south-east of Shasta Butte, found the same formation there. It is no uncommon thing in this region, for large streams to sink among fissures in the rocks, and for others to burst from the faces of precipitous ledges. Infusorial marls are com¬ mon near Pit river. Although there are a few fertile spots near the banks of the streams, the valley is generally barren, parched with drought during the summer, and unfit to support a civilized population. Below the mouth of Canoe creek, Pit river forces its way through the western chain of the Sierra Nevada. Lieut. E. G. Beckwith, 3d artillery, surveyed this portion of its course in 1854, and he reports that the stream flows with a winding course among heavily timbered mountains, which rise abruptly to heights varying from 1,500 to 2,000 feet above the water surface. PLATEAU BETWEEN PIT RIVER AND THE DES CHUTES VALLEY. After leaving Pit river and before reaching the Des Chutes valley, our course lay over a plateau bordering the eastern base of the Cascade Range. There are occasional low mountain¬ ous ridges upon it, but the general surface, for about 150 miles, retains an elevation above the sea varying but little from 4,500 feet. Most of the region is sterile, although occasional fertile spots are found. Pumice-stone, trap rock, and other volcanic products, strew the ground ; and pine forests or sage plains cover the whole face of the country. The banks of the streams, however, are generally bordered with grass of good quality, and we experienced no difficulty in obtaining a sufficient supply for our large train of animals. 28 GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE REGIONS EXAMINED. The system of drainage on this plateau is peculiar. There are numerous lakes, some of which have no known outlets, although they receive affluents. Wright and Rhett lakes were visited by our party. The former is surrounded by low hills, and, as tar as our observation went, receives no tributary, although its waters are fresh. There may be, and doubtless are, springs among the hills, from which it draws its supply. In the l’ainy season it discharges its surplus waters by Lost river into Rhett lake, which has no known outlet. The level of this lake is 470 feet below that of Wright lake, although the distance between them, in a right line, is only about 6.5 miles. The chain of Klamath waters is an interesting feature of this region. The highest point upon it visited by our party was near the northern end of Klamath marsh, but Colonel Fremont, in his expedition of 1843-’44, crossed the principal tributary of this marsh. He describes it as a stream thirty feet wide, and from two to four feet deep. It undoubtedly rises, as indicated upon his map, among the mountains east of Upper Klamath lake, and after flowing towards the north for a considerable distance, bends towards the south, and spreads out into Klamath marsh. When it emerges again, it is a large, deep stream, with a sluggish current. After passing through a canon, four miles in length, the highest points of the sides of which are about 1,000 feet above the water surface, it again spreads out into a fine sheet of water, called Upper Klamath lake. This lake receives several smaller tributaries. The river leaves it near its southern point, and soon winds through a marsh, which forms the northern portion of Lower Klamath lake. Lieut. Williamson, with a detached party, examined this portion of its course, and his opinion was, that in seasons of high water the marsh is overflowed and the river can properly be said to flow through the lake. In the summer, however, its bed is very distinct, and it does not join the sheet of water forming the lake. After crossing the marsh it soon enters the canon, by which it traverses the Cascade Range. Its subsequent course will be described, in the latter part of this chapter, under the head of Klamath river and its tribu¬ taries.” The portion of the plateau through which this chain of waters extends, is occasionally fertile and valuable for agricultural purposes, but most of it is utterly worthless. DES CHUTES VALLEY. East of Diamond Peak, the general altitude of the great plateau bordering the Cascade Range begins to diminish. There are many isolated hills and low ridges upon it, but in its general character it now becomes an inclined plain, sloping towards the Columbia river. It is drained by the Des Chutes river, which, flowing in a northerly direction near the foot hills, and receiving many tributaries from the mountains, at length discharges itself into the Columbia. The Des Chutes river, near its source, flows through a narrow prairie, bordered by a forest of pine, fir and cedar, which occasionally closes in upon its banks. The soil is of a light pumice- stone character. This formation is changed to basalt in about latitude 44°. North of this point, as far as its course is known, the river flows through a deep canon, broken by numerous rapids which have given it the name of Des Chutes. Its average descent in this canon is about twenty- five feet per mile. We did not find its tributaries sunk in canons until we reached about latitude 44° 35', where we emerged from the foot-hills, and came upon the great basaltic plain, through which the river had been flowing for many miles. This plain is formed by suc¬ cessive layers of trap, of which I once counted as many as seven, interstratified with tufas and conglomerates. Although this stone is exceedingly hard under the hammer, it disintegrates rapidly when exposed to the weather. Not only have all the streams flowing through the plain GENERAL DESCRIPTION OE THE REGIONS EXAMINED. 29 worn down their beds to depths varying from five hundred to a thousand feet, hut even the torrents of the rainy season have deeply furrowed its surface, and almost destroyed all traces of a level character in that portion lying between the mountains and the river. The plain is thinly dotted with clumps of hunch grass, sage hushes, and a very few stunted pines and cedars, hut they are all more abundantly found in the canons of the creeks. This steppe is hounded on the north by a spur from the Cascade Range, called, by the white trappers, the Mutton mountains. After crossing the valley, in about latitude 46°, the ridge soon bends towards the south, and gradually disappears. It is in some places thickly wooded with pines and firs, and in others destitute of trees. The prevailing rock is a hard compact slate. North of this spur the sage bushes disappear, and a few post oaks begin to be seen. At the northern base of the Mutton mountains there is a smaller plain, called Tysch prairie, elevated about 2,200 feet above the sea, and resembling the other in all important character¬ istics, except that it is much less furrowed by dry ravines. This prairie is bounded on the north by a low range of trap mountains, entirely bare of trees, and separated from it by Tysch creek, a fine little stream sunk in a deep canon. In this part of Des Chutes valley there are many curious round mounds, from twenty to forty feet in diameter, and from two to six feet in height. They are still more numerous in the vicinity of Fort Dalles, and there has been much specula¬ tion concerning their origin. Some persons suppose that they were formed by colonies of ground squirrels in excavating their subterranean dwellings. If so, the race is now extinct, and it is difficult to conceive how the immense number necessary to make these mounds, could have found subsistence in so barren a region. An officer at Fort Dalles had one of the mounds excavated, but he found no trace of a burrow, nor anything else which could throw light upon its origin. They occur in vast numbers, upon the sides of steep hills as well as on plains, and the effect which they produce upon the landscape is not unlike that of the spots upon the skin of a deer. Between Tysch creek and Fort Dalles, the character of the country undergoes a great change. Trap rock mostly gives place to marls. The road continually winds up and down steep, rolling hills, that are generally covered with fine bunch grass and destitute of trees. The valleys of the streams are all more or less settled, and they appear to he fertile and tolerably well supplied with timber, which is mostly oak. This section of the valley seems to be well suited to a pastoral population, but it can never compare, in fertility and importance, with that west of the Cascade Range. There are now two ferries across the Des Chutes river, one at its mouth and the other near Tysch creek. Fort Dalles, the principal settlement in Oregon Territory east of the Cascade Range, is a military post and small frontier town on the southern bank of the Columbia, near the head of navigation. It is connected by a line of steamboats with Vancouver and the Willamette valley. It contains a few houses and stores, and will doubtless rapidly increase in size and importance, should the newly-discovered gold mines in Washington Territory prove profitable. A descrip¬ tion of the Dalles of the Columbia will be found in Chapter V, under the date of September 10. It will be seen that the Des Chutes valley is mostly a barren region, furrowed by immense canons, and offering very few inducements to settlers. Its few fertile spots, excepting those in the immediate vicinity of Fort Dalle3, are separated from the rest of the world by almost impassable barriers, and Nature seems to have guaranteed it forever to the wandering savage and the lonely seeker after wild and sublime natural scenery. 30 GENERAL DESCRIPTION OP THE REGIONS EXAMINED. CASCADE MOUNTAINS, IN OREGON TERRITORY. The Cascade Range, in Oregon, consists of a belt, from thirty to ninety miles in width, of pine and fir covered ridges, separated from each other by a network of precipitous ravines. A line of isolated volcanic peaks, extending in a direction nearly north and south through the Territory, rises from this labyrinth, and marks the extreme western border of the elevated plateau already described. The chief summits are Mount Hood, Mount Jefferson, Mount Pitt, and Diamond Peak; which, with the four buttes composing the group called the Three Sisters, tower high above the rest into the region of eternal snow, the lower limit of which is here about 8,000 feet above the sea. The other peaks, although quite prominent when seen from the plateau, are hidden by intervening ridges from the Willamette valley. Westward from this line of volcanic peaks, an abrupt slope, mostly composed of ridges of very compact slate, separated by immense canons, descends to fertile valleys, elevated but slightly above the sea level, and extending to the foot hills of the Coast Range. Near the water-shed are numerous lakes, some of which discharge their waters towards the east, and others towards the west, by canons so enormous that words fail to convey an adequate idea of their size. One, the side of which was so precipitous that we could only make the descent with the greatest difficulty, was found by actual measurement to be 1,945 feet deep. A few small prairies covered with excellent bunch grass, lie hidden among the mountains. They are often surrounded by bushes bearing a kind of whortleberry, called “Oo-lal-le” by the Indians, who come in large parties in August and September to gather and dry them for winter use. Hence, it frequently happens that the explorer, while following a large trail which he hopes may lead across the mountains, suddenly finds it terminate in a whortleberry patch. An examination of these mountains is very difficult. The ravines, filled with thick under¬ brush interlaced with fallen timber, are, many of them, utterly impassable; the ridges are very precipitous and rocky ; generally the thick forest of pine, fir, spruce, and yew, quite conceals the surrounding country ; and the great scarcity of grass for the animals is a source of constant anxiety. According to the best information which I could gather from Indians and settlers, the whole range is covered with snow during the winter. There are six known passes through the Cascade Range, in Oregon Territory. It must be borne in mind that they are not simple gateways, but long winding courses through a labyrinth of ridges and ravines. They will be described in their order of succession, beginning at the most southern. 1. Pass south of Mount Pitt. — This pass, through which an emigrant wagon road has already been constructed, was not examined by our party. Lieutenant Williamson followed the road to the point where Renters the mountains, near Camp B, on Klamath river. It strikes Stewart creek, in Rogue River valley,' not far from Camp 18 A. The air-line distance between these camps is only 32 miles, and the road is said to be very good, for a mountain route. 2. Pass south of Diamond Peak. — A wagon road has been constructed through this pass, also, by which Lieutenant Williamson crossed the range. The approach from the eastward is by a branch of Des Chutes river, that rises near the foot of the main ridge. About 20 miles after leaving this stream, the road strikes the middle fork of the Willamette river, the course of which it follows to the settlements. Where it passes over the main ridge, the road is very mountainous in its character, and in the ravine of the middle fork, it crosses the stream many times at deep and rocky fords. There is a scarcity of grass upon the route. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE REGIONS EXAMINED. 31 3. Neiv pass south of Mount Hood. —This pass was discovered by the detached party in my charge. As I believe it to he more favorable for a wagon road than any of those previously known, I shall describe with considerable minuteness, both the pass proper, through the main ridge, and the approaches to it from the east and the west. This division is adopted simply for ease of description. By far the greatest difficulty in the passage of the range was encountered in the western approach to the pass. About 20 miles south of Mount Hood there are two prominent peaks, called Hu- all-hum by the Indians. At their northern base a remarkable depression is found in the main ridge. Hear the western part of it there are two small lakes called Ty-ty-pa and Wat-tum-pa. The latter is the source of a branch of Tysch creek, which flows towards the east through the depression. From the point where we first struck this stream, to the lake, the hills slope gradually towards its bed, and there is no obstacle to the construction of an excellent wagon road, except the fallen timber. Between the two lakes there was a low hill, which could probably be avoided by following the course of a little tributary of Wat-tum-pa. West of Ty-ty-pa there was a steep rise of about 400 feet, conducting to the summit of the main ridge. I think this could be turned by keeping more to the north, but, at any rate, the ascent might be made very gradual by side location. The descent, of about 200 feet, into a great ravine, which borders the main ridge on the west, might be made without much difficulty. Through this entire pass, a distance of about 13 miles, a good road, almost free from hills, might be constructed by a little side cutting and the removal of a large quantity of fallen timber. The eastern approach to this depression by my trail is excellent, and would require no labor of any kind, except a little side cutting and removal of logs in a place about 3 miles in length, between Wan-nas-see creek and Camp 58 A. There is not a single bad hill between Nee-nee springs and the entrance to the pass, a distance of about 24 miles. The distance from Nee-nee springs to Evelyn’s rancho, on Tysch creek, which is the most southern settlement in Des Chutes valley, is about 19 miles ; and a good road between them might be made with very little labor. It would cross the Mutton mountains by an open ravine, which one fork of the Indian trail now follows. This route, however, from the eastern entrance of the pass to the settlements, is very circuitous, and it is probable that a much shorter one might be found, either by following the branch of Tysch creek, flowing from Wat-tum-pa lake, or by taking an Indian trail which joined ours on Wan-nas-see creek, and which our guide said was very good. A similar descrip¬ tion of it was also given to me by a half-breed, and its position, as indicated by him, is shown on the accompanying map. The almost inexhaustible supply of bunch grass near Nee-nee springs may, however, render the more circuitous route preferable. The western approach to this pass is far less favorable than the eastern. An abrupt slope, furrowed by numerous canons utterly impassable on account of fallen timber, conducts to the Willamette valley. To avoid the logs, we found it necessary to follow the dividing ridge between Clackamas and Sandy rivers, a route which is hardly practicable even for a pack train. From the source of Clackamas river, however, I could look down its ravine for more than 20 miles, and see the hills of the Willamette valley in the distance. The ravine appeared to be wide, straight, and free from lateral spurs ; and I believe that a good road could be made in it by cutting through the logs. Near its head, it is connected with the great ravine bordering the main ridge, by a lateral canon, into which we descended, and by which it is thought the road might reach the main ridge, in about 35 miles from Clackamas prairie, without encountering 32 GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE REGIONS EXAMINED. any bad bill. The total distance from Clackamas prairie to Evelyn’s rancho, by way of Nee-nee springs, is about 90 miles. It is probable that a route might be discovered from my pass through the main ridge, to the present wagon road down Sandy river. If so, the great labor and expense of cutting through the logs in Clackamas ravine would be avoided. A more minute description of the trail of my party across the mountains will be found in Chapter V, from October 5 to October 14, inclusive ; but it must be remembered that fallen timber compelled me, during the latter part of the way, to follow a course very different from that proposed for the wagon road. 4. Foster’s Pass, south of Mount Hood. — This pass, by which an emigrant wagon road now crosses the range, is named from the settler whose house stands nearest to it in the Willamette valley. The following information concerning it has been derived from reliable sources. Start¬ ing from the Willamette valley, a short distance north of Camp 64 A, the road follows up the ravine of Sandy river nearly to the main ridge. After leaving the stream it crosses the Range, between my new pass and Mount Hood, by a route so mountainous that heavily loaded wagons can travel only in one direction. It strikes Tysch creek, in Des Chutes valley, near Evelyn’s rancho. For about 70 miles there is no grass near the road. 5. Pass near northern base of Mount Hood. — This pass is rarely used by any but Indians. I am told that it is very mountainous in its character, and that there is a great scarcity of grass' near the trail.- It is considered hardly practicable, even for pack animals. 6. Columbia River Pass. — I travelled down the Columbia, from Fort Dalles to the Cascades, in a small steamboat, and made a reconnaissance of the river between these points. The fol¬ lowing brief description of this portion of the pass has been prepared from information thus obtained. The Columbia river forces its way through the Cascade Range by a pass, which, for wild and sublime natural scenery, equals the celebrated passage of the Hudson through the Highlands. For a distance of about fifty miles, mountains, covered with clinging spruces, firs, and pines, when not too precipitous to afford even these a foothold, rise abruptly from the water’s edge to heights varying from one to three thousand feet. Some of the ridges are apparently composed of compact basaltic conglomerate ; others are enormous piles of small rocks, vast quantities of which have been known to slide into the river, overwhelming everything in their course. Vertical precipices of columnar basalt are occasionally seen rising from fifty to one hundred feet above the water’s edge. In other places, the long mountain walls of the river are divided by lateral canons, containing small tributaries and occasionally little open spots of good land liable to be overflowed at high water. It is difficult to conceive how the river could ever have forced its way through such a labyrinth of mountains. About 40 miles below the Dalles, all navigation is interrupted by a series of rapids, called the Cascades. Precipitous mountains, from two to four thousand feet in height, close in upon the stream at this spot, leaving a narrow channel through which the water rushes with great violence. During high water, the river bed is only about 900 feet wide at the narrowest place. The descent at the principal rapid was shown by my barometric observations to be 34 feet, and the total fall at the Cascades to be 61 feet. These quantities, however, vary with the different stages of the water, as, when it is high, the obstructions in the channel act like a dam, and greatly increase the depth above. An attempt formerly made to build a road round these rapids on the southern bank, entirely GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE REGIONS EXAMINED. 33 failed, on account of the immense expense of the undertaking. The northern hank is favorable, and a portage, four and a half miles in length, has been constructed by the company owning the line of steamboats plying between the Dalles and Portland. Since my visit, this has been greatly improved by Lieut. Gr. H. Derby, United States Topographical Engineers, who has had charge of the construction of a military road from Vancouver to Fort Dalles. Want of time compelled me to return to the Dalles without examining the river below the Cascades. The following information relating to the navigation of the Columbia, I received from Captain W. B. Wells, the chief proprietor of the line of steamboats plying upon the river ; a gentleman whose business has afforded him ample opportunity for observation. The river is at its lowest stage about the first of April, when it has a depth of between 9 and 10 feet up to the Cascades, and 9 feet thence to the Dalles. Above that point it is so much interrupted by rapids as to be unnavigable. It is highest about the first of July, when it has a depth of about 18 feet up to the Cascades, and of 39 feet thence to the Dalles. The disproportionate rise in the latter section is due to the stoppage of the water at the Cascades. There are no troublesome snags or floating timber at any time in the river, but often the shifting sand occasions trouble. The river very rarely freezes, and never for more than a day or two at a time. As the Columbia has succeeded in forcing its way through the Cascade Range by this pass, it has naturally been supposed that a wagon road or a railroad could be constructed, at a moderate expense, upon its banks, and an appropriation of $25,000 was made for the former purpose by Congress. The officer in charge of the work, Lieut. Gr. H. Derby, United States Topographical Engineers, made a careful examination of the route, subsequent to my reconnaissance, and he has reported the road impracticable, without enormous expense. I think that a careful survey would show the same to be true with reference to a railroad. At present, the only land com¬ munication down the river is by two pack trails, which leave the Dalles on the southern bank. Both are generally well supplied with grass. I was informed that one, which can only be used when the river is low, is tolerably good ; but that the other continually crosses rough spurs, and winds along the face of precipices, by paths so narrow, that even mules sometimes lose their foothold. By both trails it is necessary to cross to the northern bank of the river, above the Cascades, where the current is strong and the river wide. WILLAMETTE VALLEY. This valley, which forms the richest and most populous portion of Oregon, lies between the Cascade mountains and the Coast Range. 'It is about one hundred and fifty miles in length, and fifty in breadth. Its general elevation above the sea level is from two to eight hundred feet. Some parts of it are well timbered with oak, maple, cedar, fir, spruce, arbor vitae, and other valu¬ able kinds of trees; other portions are open and fertile prairies. The soil is generally very rich, and produces in abundance wheat, oats, barley, potatoes, and other products of the eastern States. Indian corn, however, cannot be cultivated to advantage. The Willamette river, flowing through the valley, receives many tributaries from the east and west, which furnish an abundant supply of water. The navigation of this river is interrupted by rapids, near Oregon city, about twenty-five miles from its mouth. At the season of high water, however, it is navigable for small steamboats, from the upper end of these rapids to (Corvallis, a distance of about one hundred miles by the course of the river. Numerous flourishing towns, and a few cities, are located upon its 5 X 34 GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE REGIONS EXAMINED. banks, and settlers’ bouses are now to be seen throughout nearly the whole of this beautiful valley, which has been appropriately called tbe Garden of Oregon. Communication with the region east of the Cascade Range is principally carried on by small steamboats upon tbe Columbia river ; but tbe pack trails upon the banks of this stream, and the wagon roads crossing the mountains near Mount Hood and Diamond Pe§,k, are also used for this purpose. Tbe land route to California is very mountainous, but a line of steamers con¬ nects Portland and San Francisco. The climate of the valley is mild and salubrious. The following facts relating to this sub¬ ject are taken from tbe Army Meteorological Register, published in 1855. The mean annual temperature is about 52°. 5 Fab.; that for the summer being about 65° Fab., and for tbe winter, 40° Fall. The mean fall of rain is, in the spring, 10 inches ; in the summer, from 2 to 6 inches ; in the autumn, 10 inches ; and in the winter, 20 inches. The mean annual fall varies from 40 to 50 inches. CALAPOOYA MOUNTAINS. This name is given to a chain extending from the Cascade to the Coast Range, and separa¬ ting tbe Willamette and Umpqua valleys. It is composed of low ridges, most of which are heavily timbered with spruce, pine, fir, and oak. A kind of hard sandstone is the prevailing rock. There are three wagon roads across these mountains. Two of these, the Applegate and Scott roads, pass over high and steep hills. Tbe third, which is located between them, and which was not fully completed when my party passed over it, follows Pass Creek through the mountains without encountering a single hill. UMPQUA VALLEY. The principal branch of the Umpqua river, called the South Umpqua, rises in the Cascade mountains near Diamond Peak. At first its course is westerly. In longitude about 123° 15', it bends abruptly towards tire north, and after flowing about 75 miles in this direction, and receiving tbe waters of the North Umpqua river and Elk creek, it again turns towards the west, and discharges itself into tbe Pacific. The most valuable and populous portion of the valley lies near the river where its course is northerly. This region consists partly of small open prai¬ ries, and partly of rolling hills sparsely covered with oak, fir, and other kinds of trees. Much of the land is exceedingly productive. The valley*, at present, contains many scattered houses, but very few towns. UMPQUA MOUNTAINS. Little is known of this chain of mountains, except that it extends westward from the Cascade Range nearly to the ocean. It consists of ridges, from 2,000 to 3,000 feet in height, covered with thick forests and underbrush. The rocks are mostly talcose in character. The only road through the chain follows the Umpqua canon, which is fully described in Chapter V, under the date November 1. Cow creek rises south of the mountains, and flows through them to the South Umpqua, but its canon, although followed by a pack trail, is reported to be too narrow and precipitous for a wagon road. The chain has been crossed at other places by parties with animals, and it is not improbable that a good pass might be discovered by a thorough exploration. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE REGIONS EXAMINED. 35 ROGUE RIVER VALLEY. Eogue river rises in the Cascade Range, near Mount Pitt, and flows westward to the Pacific ocean, receiving on the way numerous small tributaries from the Umpqua and Siskiyou mountains. Some of these streams flow through fertile valleys, separated from each other by high and forest-clad hills. Others, especially those near the coast, are sunk in immense canons. Most of the rich land lies near the California and Oregon trail. Gold digging is profitable in many places. Hornblende and granitic rocks predominate, hut Table Rock, and other hills in the vicinity, are basaltic. Jacksonville is at present the only town in the valley, although there are many scattered dwellings. SISKIYOU MOUNTAINS. Very little is accurately known about this chain, although it has been much explored by gold seekers. It is a high and heavily timbered dividing ridge between the waters of Rogue and Klamath rivers, and its general direction is east and west. The prevailing rock is a hard kind of conglomerate sandstone. Near the summit, elevated about 2,400 feet above the base, we found the soil to he an adhesive clay, which, when wet, renders travelling very laborious. There are several pack trails across the chain, hut no reliable information concerning them could he obtained. KLAMATH RIVER AND ITS TRIBUTARIES. Klamath river, as already stated, rises in the great plateau east of the Cascade Range. After flowing through Klamath marsh, and upper and lower Klamath lakes, it breaks through the mountains, near Shasta Butte, and folio wing the southern base of the Siskiyou chain, dis¬ charges itself into the Pacific. Through the greater part of its course, it flows either through sterile table lands, or immense canons. Gold is found in many places upon its hanks. My party, while returning to Fort Reading, passed through the valleys of Shasta, Scott’s and Trinity rivers, three of its most important tributaries. These will he described in the order in which they were examined. Shasta valley is an undulating region, about 25 miles in length and 15 in breadth, which extends from the base of Shasta Butte, in a northwesterly direction, to Klamath river. A small stream, named from the Butte, traverses it. This valley is sterile, compared with most of those already described, but the thick growth of bunch grass renders it a fine grazing country. It is for its gold, however, that it is chiefly valuable. This metal is found in large quantities ; but mining is difficult on account of the scanty supply of water. To remedy this deficiency, the miners are now digging a ditch from a point near the source of Shasta river, along the base of the hills which bound the valley on the southwest, to the river again near where it discharges itself into the Klamath. This ditch, which is called the Yreka canal, will he, when completed, between 30 and 40 miles in length. It derives its name from the great depot of the northern mines, which is situated in so rich a portion of the valley that gold is dug in the very streets of the city. Scott’s river flows nearly parallel to Shasta river, being only about 18 miles further to the west. The character of its valley, however, is widely different. Gold digging is not generally profitable in it, although some rich mining claims have been discovered ; especially at Scott’s Bar near the mouth of the stream. Most of the land is very productive, and a large portion of the valley is 3G GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE REGIONS EXAMINED. now divided into farms, the produce of which finds a ready market at Yreka and the mines. The greater elevation above the sea renders the climate much colder than that of the valleys further north. Frost has been known to occur here in every month of the year. Trinity river rises near Mount Shasta, and, after making a great bend to the south, discharges itself into the Klamath river, of which it is the largest tributary. My party, starting from its head waters, followed down the stream for about one quarter of its length. It flowed through a deep ravine, hounded by high and timbered ridges. The bottom was so narrow that there was very little arable land. A short distance below the point where we left the river, it enters an immense canon, which extends without much interruption to its mouth. SHASTA BUTTE AND THE MOUNTAIN CHAINS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. Shasta Butte, by far the most striking topographical feature of northern California, rises abruptly to a height generally estimated at 18,000 feet above the sea. The peak is double, and both summits are rounded, massive, and loaded with eternal snow. Its white cloud-like form is distinctly visible from points in the Sacramento valley, more than one hundred miles distant. This Butte is not only the largest and grandest peak of the long range which divides the sterile interior of the country from the fertile valleys of the Pacific Slope, hut it is also a great centre, from which diverge the numerous chains that render northern California one mass of mountains. In approaching it by the Oregon trail, both from the north and the south, there is, independent of the high ridges, a gradual increase in the elevation of the country, for about 50 miles. The region near the base itself thus attains an altitude of about 4,000 feet above the sea ; and it is an interesting fact, that most of the northern mines are found upon this vast pedestal of the giant Butte. Great confusion exists in the nomenclature of the mountain ranges in the vicinity. The name, Cascade mountains, ceases at Klamath river, but the range in reality divides. One branch, called the Siskiyou mountains, bends westward nearly to the coast ; the other, under the name of the Western Chain of the Sierra Nevada, winds to the southeast, and unites with the main Sierra Nevada. From the Butte, three steep and thickly wooded ridges called Little Scott’s mountains, Scott’s mountains, and Trinity mountains, extend to the westward. The two latter are branches of the Coast Range of California. Shasta Butte, although generally considered a peak of the Western Chain of the Sierra Nevada, is, in truth, the great centre from which radiate, besides several smaller ridges, the Cascade Range, the Coast Range, and the Western Chain of the Sierra Nevada. CHAPTER II. RAILROAD REPORT. General summary. — Proposed railroad route from benicia to fort reading. — Proposed railroad route from fort reading TO VANCOUVER, EAST OF THE CASCADE RANGE. — ROUTE FROM CAMP 36, NEAR TIIE HEAD OF DES CHUTES VALLEY, TO FORT dalles.— Route from the des chute3 to the willamette valley, by the new pass near mount hood. — Proposed RAILROAD ROUTE FROM VANCOUVER TO FORT READING, WEST OF THE CASCADE RANGE. GENERAL SUMMARY. The detailed descriptions of the routes examined for a railroad will he prefaced hy a few remarks upon the relation of the different lines to each other, and upon their general character. The survey began at Benicia. From that place to Fort Reading, a distance of about 200 miles, hut one route was examined. It lay through the fertile and settled valley of the Sacra¬ mento river, where bridges would form the only expensive item in the construction of a railroad. The supply of water and building material would he ample, and the average grade would not exceed 5 feet per mile. Two routes, well supplied with water and building material, were examined, from Fort Reading to the Columbia river — one east and the other west of the Cascade Range. A brief description of each will he given. 1. Route east of the Cascade Range.— No insuperable obstacles were encountered on this route until the head of the Des Chutes valley was reached ; hut beyond that point it was utterly impracticable. A pass was examined, however, through the Cascade Range, near Diamond Peak, hy which this valley could he avoided, and the Willamette river reached. The valley of this stream afforded a route to the Columbia river, very favorable to the construction of a railroad. This route from Fort Reading to the Columbia may he considered feasible. Its length is about 600 miles, of which 150 miles lie in a fertile and settled country, where the construction would he easy. The rest of the line traverses a wilderness, generally barren, and, for the most part, elevated from 4,000 to 5,000 feet above the sea. For about 200 miles of the latter section no very heavy work would be required, hut for the remaining 250 miles the expense of construction would he very great. The chief obstacles would he encountered in crossing the western chain of the Sierra Nevada ; in passing the two canons of Pit river ; in constructing the road along the shore of Upper Klamath lake ; in following the canon of Klamath river, between Upper and Lower Klamath lakes ; and in crossing the Cascade Range to the Willamette valley. It is thought that there would he danger of occasional obstruction from snow during a few months in the year, upon the portion of this route east of the mountains. 2. Route ivest of the Cascade Range. — The loss of the escort rendered it impossible to make any side examinations upon this line. Although the travelled route proved much better than had been anticipated, some portions of it were impracticable for a railroad. There are, however, good reasons for believing that by further examination these places could be avoided. 38 RAILROAD REPORT — ROUTE FROM BENICIA TO FORT READING. The length of the surveyed line was 470 miles. About 300 miles of it would he easy of construction, about 100 very costly and difficult, and about 80 impracticable at any reasonable expense. The routes by which the impracticable portions of the line could probably be avoided, will be fully explained in the detailed report. The chief obstacles would be encoun¬ tered in passing from the Sacramento valley to Shasta valley, and in crossing the Siskiyou mountains, the Umpqua mountains, the Grave Creek Hills in Rogue River valley, and Long’s Hills in Umpqua valley. Should further examination show this route to be feasible, it would, for many reasons, be greatly preferable to that surveyed east of the Cascade Range. It traverses a region generally but little elevated above the sea, where the danger of obstruction from snow would be very much less than upon the high plateau east of the range. It passes through the richest and most populous portion of Oregon, while a large part of the other traverses a sterile, uninhabited waste. Besides the great amount of way travel always created by a railroad in a settled country, much freight would probably pass over this line, which would not be transported over the other. This is evident from the following considerations. There are in the Willamette, Umpqua, and Rogue River valleys areas of very productive land, which is uncultivated only because there is no market for the produce. No large rivers afford water communication with the ocean, and the mountains, which cover northern California, almost entirely prevent the transportation of supplies, by land, to that State. Oregon is, therefore, to a great extent, isolated, and dependent upon itself for a market. The construction of a railroad to the Sacramento valley, by this route west of the mountains, would enable the farmers in all these fertile valleys to send their produce to the mining regions of northern California and southern Oregon, where most of the country is unfitted for agricultural purposes, and where the price of provisions is now most exorbitant. The route east of the Cascade Range, on the contrary, would neither be accessible to freight from southern Oregon, nor traverse the mining region, where the most profitable market for the produce of the Willamette valley would be found. The remainder of this chapter contains detailed descriptions of the different routes explored. PROPOSED RAILROAD ROUTE FROM BENICIA TO FORT READING, SURVEYED BY LIEUT. WILLIAMSON. Before Lieutenant Williamson’s sickness, he had prepared the following report upon the route up the Sacramento valley. As he never revised it, I have made a few necessary verbal corrections, but have not, in the slightest degree, changed its import. It is to be considered entirely his report. “The Sacramento valley is a vast plain, about two hundred miles long, and averaging fifty miles in breadth. Through the middle of it flows the Sacramento river, receiving numerous tributaries from the Sierra Nevada, but very few from the Coast Range. The valley is destitute of trees, except upon the river banks, and is covered with a luxuriant growth of wild oats. The soil, during the summer, is very dry, but in winter is so moist as to render travelling very difficult. There is not the slightest topographical obstruction to the construction of any kind of a road, in any part of the valley. “In the examination of the valley, therefore, with reference to the construction of a railroad, the most important question seems to be the relative advantages presented by the east and west sides of the valley. I had previously been up and down the valley, on each side, and was well acquainted with its character. “Only a very small quantity of water is drained from the eastern slope of the Coast Range ; and most of that is absorbed by the soil at its base. Hence the almost total absence of tribu- EAILEOAD EEPOET — EOUTE FEOM BENICIA TO FOET EEADING. 39 taries, received by the river from the west, until we arrive near the head of the valley. The hanks of the river, on that side, are generally bluff and unbroken ; the east side, on the contrary, is intersected by numerous streams, coming from the Sierra Nevada ; some, large enough to be entitled to the name of rivers ; others, so inconsiderable as to be passed unnoticed by the traveller, in summer. These, however, are torrents in winter, and form an important item for consideration, in making a road. “ The distance from Benicia to Fort Beading, by the western side of the valley, by the ordinary road, which is very direct, is 178 miles ; while by the eastern side, it is 200 miles. The former portion, however, is only inhabited along the banks of the river, whereas the tributaries from the Sierra Nevada, intersecting the latter portion, afford plenty of water, and numerous desirable locations for farms. The mining portion of the population is all on this side, and branch roads into the mines would be required. In order, therefore, to afford the means of discussing under¬ standing^ the relative advantages of these two portions, I determined to proceed to Fort Beading by the eastern side of the valley, and note particularly, the size and character of the beds of the water-courses that intersect it, that the extra expense of construction due to bridging, might be estimated. “ We left our camp near Benicia, on the 10th of July, and travelled thirteen miles, camping on a small stream known as Suisun creek, which is about thirty feet wide. This is the first place where a bridge would be required. From here we travelled on through the Suisun valley, by a road nearly level, but occasionally passing through low, rolling hills, until, thirty-two miles from Benicia, we came to Putos creek, which is a stream sixty or seventy feet wide. When we crossed it, the water in the creek was thirty feet below the top of the banks ; but in winter it sometimes overflows them. This stream, at the most favorable point, would require a bridge 130 feet long. “ The only other stream, before reaching the Sacramento river, is Cache creek, which differs from Putos creek in occupying a broad bed with low banks. At the narrowest place I saw, the hed was 100 yards wide, with banks thirty feet high, and I am told that in time of freshet these are overflowed. Thus, but three bridges would be required between Benicia and the Sacramento river, and, if the road followed up the west bank, none other would be required for sixty miles. Above that, the river receives a tributary every fifteen or twenty miles. “We crossed the Sacramento river at Fremont, a town of half a dozen houses, opposite the mouth of Feather river. The Sacramento was low, and 250 yards wide. In time of high water when the banks are not overflowed, it is 300 yards wide, but in time of freshet the country is overflowed for miles. I came down the river in December, 1852, when the sheet of water cover¬ ing the country was fifty miles broad. Vast quantities of stock were destroyed. Sacramento city was overflowed, and much damage done to property there. “ From the crossing of the Sacramento, we travelled up the eastern side of the valley, all the way to Fort Beading, following Feather river for nearly fifty miles. The country- was a level plain until within forty miles of the fort, when it assumed an undulatory character, but presented no serious obstacle to the construction of a railroad. The average grade from Benicia to the fort, is 2.6 feet per mile. “ In order to show the amount of bridging required for a road going up on the eastern side of the valley-, I have constructed the following table, which gives a concise description of every stream crossed. This table includes all those which are dry in summer, but which must be bridged to allow a free passage for the water in winter. The height of the banks is given for low water.” 40 RAILROAD REPORT - ROUTE FROM BENICIA TO FORT READING. Water-courses north of Fremont , on the route surveyed up the Sacramento valley.
