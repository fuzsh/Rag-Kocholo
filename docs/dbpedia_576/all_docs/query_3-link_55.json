The Forest Service and Bureau of Eand Management (BLM) (the Agencies) prepared this Draft SEIS to present the environmental consequences of undertaking different strategies for conserving rare and little known species that are associated with late-successional and old-growth forests within the range of the northern spotted owl. This Draft SEIS supplements the analyses contained in the Final SEIS (2000) for Amendment to the Survey and Manage, Protection Buffer, and other Mitigation Measures Standards and Guidelines, and the Final SEIS (1994) for Amendments to Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management Planning Documents Within the Range of the Northern Spotted Owl (the Northwest Forest Plan). The underlying need for this SEIS is to achieve the objectives originally established in the Northwest Forest Plan, to the extent those objectives are frustrated by the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines. The purposes of the SEIS are to: 1. Continue to provide for diversity of plant and animal communities in accordance with the National Forest Management Act and conserve rare and little known species that may be at risk of becoming listed under the Endangered Species Act. 2. Reduce the Agencies’ cost, time, and effort associated with rare and little known species conservation. 3. Restore the Agencies’ ability to achieve resource management objectives that were established under the Northwest Forest Plan. Three alternatives, including no action, are considered in detail in the Draft SEIS. The preferred alternative is Alternative 2 with mitigation. The preferred alternative would remove the Survey and Manage Mitigation Measure and the Agencies would rely on their existing Special Status Species Programs to conserve rare species. A decision to select one of the action alternatives would amend the management direction in all 28 Forest Service land and resource management plans and BLM resource management plans in the Northwest Forest Plan area. The Agencies are soliciting comments on the Draft SEIS. Comments will be accepted via hardcopy mail, facsimile, and the internet.

Therefore, no administrative review (appeal) through the Forest Service will be available on the Record of Decision under 36 CFR 217, and no administrative review (protest) through the Bureau of Land Management will be available on the Record of Decision under 43 CFR 1610.5-2. Because there is no administrative review of the decision, the Record of Decision will not be signed until 30 days after the Notice of Availability for the Final SEIS appears in the Federal Register (see 40 CFR 1506.10(b)). Abstract This Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement examines the environmental effects of a proposal by the Forest Service and BLM to eliminate or modify the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines of the Northwest Forest Plan. Alternatives considered in detail are: (1) Alternative 1, No-Action; (2) Alternative 2, an alternative that would amend agency land and resource management plans by removing the Survey and Manage mitigation measure; and, (3) Alternative 3, an alternative that would amend agency land and resource management plans by modifying the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines. The need for the proposal was generated by concerns that the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines are frustrating Forest Service and BFM efforts to accomplish resource management objectives of the Northwest Forest Plan. The 304 Survey and Manage species affected by this proposal were analyzed to determine the environmental consequences under the 3 alternatives. Analyses show that the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines and the Special Status Species Programs add protection and reduce risk to species. Recognizing there is much that remains unknown about many of the species, 141 species remain at high risk of extirpation under all alternatives due to factors beyond the control of the Forest Service and BFM. When compared to Alternative 1, there are 47 and 7 species that would be at high risk of extirpation under Alternatives 2 and 3, respectively. These species are not at high risk of extirpation under Alternative 1. The analysis also showed annual timber harvest would be 100 MMBF higher under Alternative 2 and 75 MMBF higher under Alternative 3 compared to Alternative 1, No-Action. Cost of the No-Action Alternative was projected to be $25.9 million annually for the next 10 years, dropping to $15.3 million annually thereafter. Short-term annual costs of Alternatives 2 and 3 were $7.5 million and $11.8 million, respectively. After 10 years, those annual costs fall to $7.1 million and $9.2 million, respectively. Alternatives 2 and 3 showed increases in annual employment and annual hazardous fuel treatment acreage relative to Alternative 1, No- Action. The preferred alternative is Alternative 2 with mitigation that eliminates the high risk of extirpation for 47 species mentioned above. It is preferred because it best meets the purpose and need. Specifically, Alternative 2 conserves rare and little known species, reduces cost and effort, and allows for achievement of healthy forests and timber outputs.

Currently, 304 species and 4 arthropod guilds are managed under the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines. A proposal to eliminate the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines was put forth as the “proposed action” and was made public on October 21, 2002, through a Notice of Intent published in the Eederal Register (67 ER 64601). The Notice of Intent provided preliminary information about the proposed action and invited public comment. The existing Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines were originally added to agency land and resource management plans as part of the 1994 Record of Decision for Amendments to Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management Planning Documents Within the Range of the Northern Spotted Owl (the Northwest Eorest Plan). The Northwest Forest Plan primarily takes a landscape approach to providing habitat for late-successional and old-growth forest related species on Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) (hereafter referred to as the Agencies) administrative units in western Washington and Oregon, and northwestern California. The Survey and Manage mitigation measure was added to the basic elements of the Northwest Forest Plan to provide additional certainty that the plan would provide for rare and little known species. In January 2001, the Agencies modified the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines by identifying needed management, clarifying language, eliminating inconsistent and redundant practices, and establishing an annual species review process. Those modifications were embodied in the January 2001 Record of Decision for Amendments to the Survey and Manage, Protection Buffer, and other Mitigation Measures Standards and Guidelines. Why is the Action Being Proposed? Agency managers and the public have raised concerns that the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines are frustrating the Agencies’ ability to meet the resource management goals and objectives as set forth in the Northwest Forest Plan. They assert that the costs of the Survey and Manage mitigation measure, both in dollars and time, are excessive. They also suggest that because 80 percent of federally managed lands within the Northwest Forest Plan area are allocated to Reserves, it is not necessary to manage substantially more land for late-successional and old- growth related species. The Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines require management of species sites within areas allocated to multiple use such as timber harvest or watershed restoration. Such management ean prevent timber sales and other activities such as habitat conservation and restoration from going forward. The underlying needs to which the Agencies are responding are healthy forest ecosystems and a sustainable supply of timber and other forest products, to the extent these are frustrated by the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines. What Would It Mean Not to Meet the Need? To answer this question, the No-Action Alternative (Alternative 1) was analyzed. Alternative 1 continues implementation of all current elements of the Northwest Forest Plan including the Survey and Manage mitigation measure, the underlying land and resource management plans, and relevant agency programs and policies. Alternative 1 is described in detail in Chapter 2. 1 Draft SEIS - To Remove or Modify the Survey and Manage Mitigation Measure Standards and Guidelines What Action is Proposed? The Agencies propose to amend 28 land and resource management plans within the range of the northern spotted owl to remove the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines. This proposal is referred to as the “proposed action” or Alternative 2. Under Alternative 2, the Agencies would rely on their existing Special Status Species Programs to conserve rare species. Alternative 2 is described in detail in Chapter 2. Are There Other Alternatives that Would Meet the Need? During the scoping phase for this project (October through December 2002) many comments were received both internally and externally. Commenters suggested various ideas for meeting the need, and many of these are addressed in Chapter 2 under “Alternatives Considered, but Eliminated from Detailed Study”. Several of these ideas were also incorporated into another alternative. Alternative 3. Alternative 3 would remove the uncommon species from the Survey and Manage mitigation measure while retaining rare species. Alternative 3 would also remove the requirement to conduct pre-disturbance surveys in forest stands that have not developed late- successional and old-growth characteristics. Alternative 3 is described in detail in Chapter 2. What are the Effects of the Alternatives? This section summarizes the environmental consequences of the three alternatives discussed in detail in Chapter 3&4. Survey and Manage Species The environmental consequences analysis in this SEIS affirms previous analyses in the Northwest Eorest Plan Pinal SEIS (1994) and the Survey and Manage Pinal SEIS (2000). Based on those analyses, the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines generally add protection to species and generally improve the outcomes for numbers, populations, and distribution. However, this is not true in all cases. In the Survey and Manage Pinal SEIS 2000, there were many species for which there was insufficient information to draw a conclusion. In addition, even with the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines, there was insufficient habitat to maintain stable, well- distributed populations for some species. In addition to examining numbers, populations, and distribution, the analysis in this SEIS examines the following question: Is there a high risk of species extirpation in the Northwest Eorest Plan area? There are 304 species and 4 arthropod guilds currently included in the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines. The results of the analysis indicate that some species are at high risk for extirpation and, for some other species, there is inadequate information to draw a conclusion under any alternative (USDA, USDI 2000a). Table S-1 displays the number of Survey and Manage species at high risk for extirpation and the number of species where there is inadequate information to draw a conclusion. There would be a substantial difference in the outcome regarding a high risk of extirpation in the Northwest Forest Plan area between Alternatives 1 and 2 for 47 species. This includes 1 lichen, 1 bryophyte, 3 mollusks, and 42 fungi species. For these species, there is not a high risk of extirpation under Alternative 1 while there is a high risk of extirpation under Alternative 2. Under Alternative 2, the Agencies’ Special Status Species Programs would not provide for these species to continue to exist in the Northwest Forest Plan area because the programs sometimes would not cover large or important parts of a species’ range. There would be a substantial difference in the outcome regarding a high risk of extirpation in the Northwest Forest Plan area between Alternatives 1 and 3 for seven fungi species. For these species there is not a high risk of extirpation under Alternative 1, while there is a high risk of Summary Table S-1.

Under Alternative 3, the Agencies’ Special Status Species Programs would not provide for these species to continue to exist in the Northwest Forest Plan area because the programs sometimes would not cover large or important parts of a species’ range. For some of the species, even though they would not be at high risk of extirpation range-wide in the Northwest Forest Plan area, they would be at high risk of extirpation in a portion of their range under Alternatives 2 and 3. For Alternative 2, this includes four lichens, one bryophyte, nine mollusks, one vascular plant, and the Oregon red tree vole. For Alternative 3, this includes one mollusk, one vascular plant, and the Oregon red tree vole. Species Mitigation Measures could be used to mitigate the adverse environmental impacts for species that would be at high risk of extirpation in all or a portion of the Northwest Forest Plan area under Alternatives 2 and 3, but not under Alternative 1. Mitigation for these effects could include management of known sites not protected by reserves or the Agencies’ Special Status Species Programs. In addition, mitigation for some of these species could include pre-project clearances. As a result of this mitigation, these species would not be at a high risk of extirpation. There are 141 species at high risk of extirpation in the Northwest Forest Plan area under all alternatives. These species are at high risk due to factors such as limited potential habitat and few populations on federally managed lands, potential for stochastic events, low number of individuals, limited distribution, and narrow ecological amplitudes. Since the high risk is not a result of federal actions, no alternative or mitigation could be proposed that would eliminate this risk (USDA, USDI 1994a and USDA, USDI 2000a). Timber Harvest The amount of late-successional forest projected for management of known sites reduces the acres of late-successional forest in the Matrix and Adaptive Management Areas available for harvest. The projected Probable Sale Quantity (PSQ) reductions shown below are from the current 805 million board foot (MMBF) baseline. Under Alternative 1, there would be a 130 MMBF reduction in PSQ due to management of known sites. Under Alternative 2, there would be a 30 MMBF reduction in PSQ due to management of known sites. Mitigation measures for 63 species, including management of known sites under Alternative 2, would reduce PSQ an additional 10 MMBF. Under Alternative 2 with mitigation, there would be a 40 MMBF reduction in PSQ. iii Draft SEIS - To Remove or Modify the Survey and Manage Mitigation Measure Standards and Guidelines Under Alternative 3, there would be a 55 MMBF reduction in PSQ due to management of known sites. Mitigation measures for 10 species, including management of known sites under Alternative 3, would reduce PSQ an additional 3 MMBF. Under Alternative 3 with mitigation, the reduction in PSQ would remain at 55 MMBF (due to rounding). Wildland and Prescribed Fire Under Alternative 1, the annual acres available for hazardous fuel treatments would be 134,100 acres. The cost per acre to manage for species would be $134. Under Alternative 2, the annual acres available for fuel treatments would be 158,200, an increase of 24,100 acres compared to Alternative 1. Fuel treatment costs to manage for species would be $39 per acre, a decrease of $95 compared with Alternative 1. Mitigation measures for 63 species under Alternative 2 would result in 1,700 fewer acres available for annual fuel treatments and an increase in $5 per acre to protect species compared to Alternative 2 without mitigation. Under Alternative 3, the annual acres available for fuel treatments would be 153,100, an increase of 19,400 acres compared to Alternative 1. Fuel treatment costs to manage for species would be $52 per acre, a decrease of $82 compared with Alternative 1. Mitigation measures for ten species under Alternative 3 would result in a negligible effect on acres available for annual fuel treatments and cost per acre to protect species compared to Alternative 3 without mitigation. Cost of Management Under Alternative 1, the Agencies’ short-term annual costs would be $25.9 million. Long-term annual costs (after 10 years) would decrease to $15.3 million. Under Alternative 2, the Agencies’ short-term annual costs would be $7.5 million. This would result in a short-term cost savings of $18.4 million per year compared to Alternative 1. The Agencies’ long-term annual costs would be $7.1 million. This would result in a long-term cost savings of $8.2 million per year compared to Alternative 1. The cost of possible mitigation under Alternative 2 would be $0.6 million dollars annually, mostly due to the need for additional clearance surveys. Under Alternative 3, the Agencies’ short-term annual costs would be $11.8 million. This would result in a short-term cost savings of $14.1 million per year compared to Alternative 1. The Agencies’ long-term annual costs would be $9.2 million. This would result in a long-term cost savings of $6.1 million per year compared to Alternative 1. The cost of possible mitigation under Alternative 3 would be negligible. Socioeconomics All alternatives have an adverse effect on PSQ that was not anticipated in the Northwest Forest Plan Final SEIS (see 2000 Survey and Manage Final SEIS, p. 429). The full harvest level under the Northwest Eorest Plan is currently 805 MMBE which would support 7,309 timber-related jobs. Under Alternative 1, the timber-related employment decrease from full Northwest Forest Plan harvest level would be 1,180. Survey-related employment would provide an additional 533 jobs. This would result in a net decrease of 647 jobs compared to projected employment under the Northwest Forest Plan. Under Alternative 2, the timber-related employment decrease from full Northwest Forest Plan harvest level would be 272 jobs. Survey-related employment would provide an additional 154 jobs. This would result in a net decrease of 118 jobs. Possible mitigation under this alternative would result in a net decrease of 196 jobs when considering both timber and survey-related jobs. IV Summary Under Alternative 3, the timber-related employment decrease from full Northwest Forest Plan harvest level would be 499 jobs. Survey-related employment would provide an additional 242 jobs. This would result in a net decrease of 257 jobs compared to projected employment under the Northwest Forest Plan. Possible mitigation under this alternative would result in negligible effects on employment levels. Other Resources For the other resources, including the aquatic ecosystem, late-successional forest ecosystem, air quality, water quality, soil productivity, late-successional mammals (excluding red tree vole), late- successional birds (excluding great gray owl), threatened and endangered species, and species associated with early-successional forest, the alternatives would either have relatively minor effects or would not change the analysis or outcomes developed in the Northwest Forest Plan Final SEIS and implemented through its Record of Decision (USDA, USDI 1994b). Table S-2 displays a brief summary of the environmental consequences of the alternatives. Table S-2. Summary of environmental consequences of the alternatives.

V Draft SEIS - To Remove or Modify the Survey and Manage Mitigation Measure Standards and Guidelines What Factors Will be Used in Making the Decision Between Alternatives? The Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Interior will jointly decide which alternative best meets the underlying need for this proposal. In making the decision, they will also weigh how well each of the alternatives meets the following purposes: 1. Provide for diversity of plant and animal communities in accordance with the National Forest Management Act and conserve rare and little known species that may be at risk of becoming listed under the Endangered Species Act. It has been longstanding policy in both the Forest Service and BLM to avoid taking actions that would lead to the listing of species under the Endangered Species Act. In addition, the Forest Service has regulations that require it “to provide for diversity of plant and animal communities based on the suitability and capability of the specific land area” (16 USC 1604(g)(3)(B). 2. Reduce the Agencies’ cost, time, and effort associated with rare and little known species conservation. Pre-disturbance surveys, strategic surveys, and other elements of the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines are expensive and use a disproportionate share of available agency funding. Required pre-disturbance surveys can delay projects for 2 years and draw valuable personnel and resources away from other conservation efforts. 3. Restore the Agencies’ ability to achieve resource management objectives that were established under the Northwest Forest Plan. Some Survey and Manage species are so numerous that the acreage needed to protect them far exceeds that projected in previous analyses. As a result, some project areas become dotted with dozens of known sites, severely reducing project size or making the entire project infeasible. This problem has limited the Agencies’ ability to restore forest health including thinning in Late-Successional Reserves and Riparian Reserves, and fuel treatments to reduce the threat of catastrophic wildfire to watersheds and communities at risk. This problem has also contributed to the Agencies’ inability to achieve consistent levels of timber outputs and meet the timber harvest objectives in the Northwest Forest Plan. What Monitoring is Necessary that is Not Included in the Proposed Action or Alternatives? Monitoring will continue in accordance with existing monitoring requirements for the Northwest Forest Plan and for the land and resource management plans for each of the Forest Service and BLM administrative units within the Northwest Forest Plan area. No new monitoring requirements are proposed under any of the alternatives. Which Alternative is Preferred? Based on consideration of the environmental consequences. Alternative 2, with mitigation as described in Chapter 3&4, was found to best meet the purpose and need, and is the preferred alternative. VI Chapter 1 - Purpose and Need Chapter 1 - Purpose and Need Introduction This chapter specifies the purpose and need to which the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) (the Agencies) are responding in developing the proposed action and alternatives assessed in this Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS). The Agencies propose to amend 28 land and resource management plans within the range of the northern spotted owl to remove the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines. This includes land and resource management plans of the Eorest Service and resource management plans of the BLM (collectively referred to as land and resource management plans) in the Pacific Northwest and northern California (Eigure 1-1). The existing Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines were added to land and resource management plans as part of the 1994 Record of Decision for Amendments to Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management Planning Documents Within the Range of the Northern Spotted Owl (aka the Northwest Forest Plan). The Northwest Forest Plan was later modified by the January 2001 Record of Decision for Amendments to the Survey and Manage, Protection Buffer, and other Mitigation Measures Standards and Guidelines. Although the 1994 and 2001 Records of Decision actually amended 28 land and resource management plans, the overall resource management strategy was and is continued to be called the Northwest Forest Plan. The Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines currently provide procedures and requirements for the management of 304 rare and/or little-known species (and 4 arthropod guilds) within the Northwest Forest Plan area. Species include fungi, lichens, vascular plants, arthropods, mollusks, bryophytes, and vertebrates. The Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines include species that are closely associated with late-successional or old-growth forests and for which other elements of the Northwest Forest Plan (such as reserves or other standards and guidelines) do not provide a reasonable assurance of persistence. Background information about the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines can be found in Chapter 2. The Need Impacts of the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines have been much greater than the minor impacts anticipated when the mitigation measure was added to the SEIS for the Northwest Eorest Plan in 1994 (see Reasons for the Purpose and Need section later in this chapter). As a result, they are frustrating the achievement of the stated needs of the Northwest Eorest Plan “. . . protect the long-term health of our forests, our wildlife and our waterways . . .”, “Where sound management policies can preserve the health of forest land, [timber] sales should go forward”, and “. . . produce a predictable and sustainable level of timber sales and nontimber resources that will not degrade or destroy the environment.” (USDA, USDI 1994a, p. 1-4 and USDA, USDI 1994b, p. 3.) The Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines are frustrating the Agencies’ ability to protect the long-term health of forests, wildlife, and waterways because they substantially restrict forest health treatments, such as fuels reduction, and Late-Successional Reserve and Riparian Reserve thinning. They are also preventing many timber sales that were predicted under the Northwest Eorest Plan from being implemented. The underlying needs to which the Agencies are responding are healthy forest ecosystems and a sustainable supply of timber and other forest products, to the extent these are frustrated by the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines. 1 Draft SEIS - To Remove or Modify' the Survey and Manage Mitigation Measure Standards and Guidelines Figure 1-1.

Secretary of Agriculture, et ah. Civil No. 01-6378-AA (D. Oregon, hling December 24, 2001)). The settlement agreement requires the Agencies to examine, in an SEIS, an alternative “that replaces the Survey and Manage mitigation requirements with existing Forest Service and BLM special status species programs to achieve the goals of the Northwest Forest Plan through a more streamlined process...” A purpose is to comply with the terms of the Settlement Agreement by considering, in detail, an alternative that eliminates the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines. Other elements of the Northwest Forest Plan and the Agencies’ existing Special Status Species Programs would be relied on to provide for species viability and diversity while achieving other objectives of the Northwest Forest Plan. Conserve Rare and Little Known Species It has been longstanding policy in both the Forest Service and BLM to avoid taking actions that would lead to the listing of species under the Endangered Species Act. Policies to this effect are found in U.S. Department of Agriculture Regulation 9500-4, Forest Service Manual 2670.32, and BLM Manual 6840.22. These policies share two principles: assist in the recovery of threatened and endangered species and implement management practices to ensure that species do not become threatened or endangered because of federal actions. In addition, the Forest Service has regulations that require it “to provide for diversity of plant and animal communities based on the suitability and capability of the specific land area” (16 U.S.C. 1604(g)(3)(B)). The National Forest Management Act (NFMA) implementing regulations for the Forest Service at 36 CFR 219.19 (1982) require that “Fish and wildlife habitat shall be managed to maintain viable populations of existing native and desired non-native vertebrate species in the planning area.” A purpose is to continue to provide for diversity of plant and animal communities in accordance with the National Forest Management Act and conserve rare and little known species that may be at risk of becoming listed under the Endangered Species Act. Reduce Cost and Effort Agency funding is important to accomplishing overall management objectives. Pre-disturbance surveys, strategic surveys, and other elements of the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines are expensive and use a disproportionate share of available agency funding. The annual cost of the Survey and Manage Program is estimated to be over $25 million. Required pre-disturbance surveys can delay projects for 2 years and draw valuable personnel and resources away from other conservation efforts. Some Survey and Manage processes including the annual species review, developing and approving management recommendations, and project exceptions are complex and time consuming, leading to substantial delays and stalled projects. These problems limit the Agencies’ ability to meet policy objectives and divert money from other work including watershed restoration projects, fuel reduction projects, timber management projects, and projects designed to improve habitat for threatened, endangered, and other species. 3 Draft SEIS - To Remove or Modify' the Survey and Manage Mitigation Measure Standards and Guidelines A purpose is to reduce the Agencies’ cost, time, and effort associated with rare and little known species conservation. Healthy Forests and Timber Outputs Some Survey and Manage species are so numerous or widespread that the acreage needed to protect them far exceeds that projected in previous analyses. As a result, some project areas become dotted with dozens of known sites, severely reducing project size or making the entire project infeasible. This problem has limited the Agencies’ ability to restore forest health including thinning in Late-Successional Reserves and Riparian Reserves, and fuel treatments to reduce the threat of catastrophic wildfire to watersheds and communities at risk. This problem has also contributed to the Agencies’ inability to achieve predictable and sustainable levels of timber outputs as predicted in the Northwest Forest Plan. A purpose is to restore the Agencies’ ability to achieve resource management goals that were established under the Northwest Forest Plan. Reasons for the Purpose and Need 1. Effects of Survey and Manage were underestimated. The Survey and Manage Final SEIS in 2000 stated: ‘A 6 MMBF reduction in PSQ [probable sale quantity] was made for 1993 known sites, but the possibility of future sites was summarized as: ‘... other modifications made to Alternative 9 add to the uncertainty of the PSQ calculations. These changes include the requirement to survey and manage future sites of some late-successional forest associated species,...’ (USDA, USDl 1994a, page 3&4-167.) The Northwest Forest Plan SEIS made no PSQ adjustment for Survey and Manage sites that would be identified in the future. It was assumed that occurrences of these species would be rare and effects on lands available for harvest would be minimalT (USDA, USDI 2000a.) The Survey and Manage Final SEIS 2000 estimated that Probable Sale Quantity (PSQ) would be reduced by 51 million board feet (MMBF) per year due to implementation of the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines, and notes proportionate limitations on habitat restoration, prescribed fire, and other forest management activities. With further implementation experience and new information gained over the last 2 years, effects of the Survey and Manage mitigation measure are estimated to be more than twice that projected in the 2000 Final SEIS (Chapter 3&4, Timber Harvest section). Catastrophic wildfire continues to pose risks to many communities with more than 7 million acres burned nationally in 2002. The Biscuit fire in southwest Oregon and northwest California consumed nearly 500,000 acres alone. Efforts to reduce catastrophic wildfire risk are projected to fall short of annual goals by 20 percent due to conflicts with the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines (Chapter 3&4 Wildland and Prescribed Fire section). Identifying a single, mid- slope site for a Survey and Manage species can prevent fuel treatment in an entire prescribed burning unit. The Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines have clearly not had the relatively minor effects originally predicted. Many of the Survey and Manage species are so numerous that the required avoidance substantially constrains other forest management activities including fuel reduction treatments, watershed and late-successional forest restoration, and timber harvests. Pre-disturbance (clearance) surveys are required for 69 Survey and Manage species prior to undertaking habitat-disturbing activities. When a species is located during surveys, a “known site” is established and managed. Management usually includes a buffer ranging from 1/4 to 10 4 Chapter 1 - Purpose and Need acres in size. For one species, 600 acres are managed for each site found. For another, so many sites are found in project areas that whole projects are cancelled. This has reduced silvicultural treatments designed to enhance old-growth development in Late-Successional Reserves and prevented the implementation of fuel treatments in areas at high risk of catastrophic wildfire. Currently, the Agencies manage more than 26,000 acres of known sites, typically to the exclusion of other forest management activities, regardless of the number of known sites nearby. 2. Survey and Manage is costly and time consuming. The Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines drain agency resources and impact project implementation. Annual cost is projected to be more than $25 million, while requirements for pre-disturbance surveys can extend project planning 1 to 2 additional years, delaying needed restoration or other work. Sixty-nine Survey and Manage species require pre-disturbance surveys and few habitat-disturbing activities are exempt. These factors reduce the Agencies’ ability to complete restoration work, develop or expand recreation sites, prepare timber sales, or otherwise respond to management needs. The various Survey and Manage administrative processes and procedures, originally intended to provide consistency of implementation, have turned out to be so costly and time consuming that little of the intended implementation flexibility can actually be used. Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines generally require retention of all known sites regardless of local situations or resource objectives. For example, fuel reduction projects reintroducing fire at the landscape scale have become nearly impossible because of the requirement to protect sites even when the species occupying the site naturally occurs in fire-adapted ecosystems. In some ways, protection measures for Survey and Manage species are more restrictive than those for federally listed threatened or endangered species. The Endangered Species Act includes provisions for authorizing incidental “take” when there is no jeopardy to the continued existence of the species. Take is authorized by regulatory agencies based on reasonable assumptions and consideration of conflicting resource management objectives. However, getting authorization to impact a Survey and Manage species requires a complicated review and approval process that can delay or stifle projects long after incidental take was authorized for threatened or endangered species in the same project area. The amendments to the Survey and Manage mitigation measure in the 2001 Record of Decision significantly reduced costs and conflicts when compared with what the Agencies would have experienced under full implementation of the original 1994 Northwest Forest Plan Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines. However, even as amended, the complexity and cost of the Survey and Manage mitigation measure is disproportionately reducing agency resources that would otherwise be available for implementation of other elements of the Northwest Forest Plan. 3. Species protections under the Northwest Forest Plan may have exceeded legal requirements causing other programs and activities to suffer. The Forest Service’ NFMA implementing regulation at 36 CFR 219.19 (1982) requires that “Fish and wildlife habitat shall be managed to maintain viable populations of existing native and desired non-native vertebrate species in the planning area.” The FEMAT, in crafting the ten alternatives considered in the 1994 SEIS was instructed to “include alternatives that range from a medium to a very high probability of ensuring the viability of species” (USDA et al. 1993, p. II-5). In addition, the Survey and Manage mitigation measure was added well after the ten alternatives were developed and analyzed. The screens that identified species to be included in the Survey and Manage mitigation measure did “not represent a judgment about what is required by the National Forest Management Act or the Endangered Species Act” (USDA, USDI 1994a, p. J2-2); therefore, inclusion in Survey and Manage does not mean species viability is dependent upon this mitigation measure. The BLM planning regulations, issued under the Eederal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) (43 U.S.C.1701), have no diversity or viability requirements. They only require multiple use. Similarly, the Oregon and California Railroad and Coos Bay Wagon Road Grant Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1181a) contains no provisions for species diversity or viability. Yet, under Option 9, BLM administered lands were given the same species viability protections as National Forest 5 Draft SEIS - To Remove or Modify the Survey and Manage Mitigation Measure Standards and Guidelines System lands (USDA et al. 1993, p. II-5). Extending the viability requirements to BLM lands may have exceeded BLM’s legal obligation for species protection. The Northwest Forest Plan states: “By its own terms, the [Forest Service viability provision] regulation applies only to vertebrate species. Nonetheless, consistent with the statutory goals of providing for diversity of plant and animal communities and the long-term health of federal forests, as well as the agencies’ conservation policies, our decision satisfies a similar standard with respect to non-vertebrate species to the extent practicable” (USDA, USDI 1994b, p. 44). Again, legal requirements for species protection may have been exceeded. Finally, the “persistence objective” in the 2000 Survey and Manage Final SEIS, was defined not as a legal threshold, but as “providing for roughly the same likelihood of persistence as that which was provided by the Northwest Forest Plan as originally adopted in the 1994 ROD” (USDA, USDI 2000a, p. 42). However, both the 1994 Northwest Forest Plan Final SEIS and Record of Decision describe the achieved level as exceeding, and not required by, applicable laws and regulations (USDA, USDI 1994a, p. J2-2, and USDA, USDI 1994b, p. 44). Fegal requirements were exceeded, in part, because it was believed that costs associated with the Survey and Manage mitigation measure and conflicts with management objectives were low. In summary, while agencies are not prohibited from exceeding these laws, by doing so, species protection measures have unnecessarily constrained other programs and activities. 4. Special Status Species Programs should suffice. Rare and uncommon species in all other parts of the nation rely on the Agencies’ Special Status Species Programs to meet legal and policy requirements. These programs have successfully accomplished objectives similar to those of the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines with lower costs and fewer program conflicts. Proposed Action The Proposal The Agencies propose to amend 28 land and resource management plans within the range of the northern spotted owl to remove the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines. Separate from this proposal, the Agencies reviewed the 304 Survey and Manage species to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the Agencies’ existing Special Status Species Programs. It is anticipated that Survey and Manage species that are eligible for the Agencies’ Special Status Species Programs will be added to those programs if the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines are removed. The Agencies’ Special Status Species Programs seek to further the objectives of the Endangered Species Act by preventing future listings of species as threatened or endangered. Both programs require coordination with state agencies to achieve conservation goals of species identified by state governments (see Chapter 2 for description of Special Status Species Programs). The objectives of the Forest Service’ program also include compliance with NFMA regulations requiring diversity of plant and animal communities. Not all of the 304 rare or little known species (and 4 arthropod guilds) are eligible for the Agencies’ Special Status Species Programs. Tentatively, the Agencies determined 130 of the 304 Survey and Manage species are eligible for one or more of the programs. In making the tentative determination, the Agencies used global and state biodiversity database rankings from the Oregon Natural Heritage Program (ONHP) along with existing agency policy. ONHP rankings and criteria for inclusion in the Agencies’ Special Status Species Programs are not based solely on local abundance; they also consider habitat distribution, threats, global population levels, and other factors. None of the species affected by this proposal are currently listed as threatened or endangered or proposed for listing under the Endangered Species Act. The proposed action does 6 Chapter 1 - Purpose and Need not include any other changes to the Northwest Forest Plan. The proposed action is described in detail in Chapter 2. Decision to be Made The decision to be made is whether to select the proposed action or another alternative. The decision will be based on the degree to which the proposed action and alternatives meet the purpose and need. Specifically, alternatives will be evaluated on how well they conserve rare or little known species, reduce costs, and achieve the resource management objectives of the Northwest Forest Plan including healthy forests and timber outputs. While the settlement agreement provides an impetus to prepare this SEIS, it does not provide a basis for selecting an alternative. This SEIS is a supplement to the 2000 Survey and Manage Final SEIS, which was a supplement to the Northwest Eorest Plan Final SEIS. The Agencies have chosen to focus this proposal on problems associated with the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines. Separate from this action, the Agencies have recognized a need to “ ... make the Aquatic Conservation Strategy (ACS) in the [1994] Record of Decision consistent with the original intent of the report prepared by the Forest Ecosystem Management Assessment Team . . .” (67 ER 70575, November 25, 2002) and have chosen to do that in a separate SEIS. Scoping A Notice of Intent to prepare the SEIS was published in the Federal Register on October 21, 2002 (67 FR 64601). The Notice of Intent provided preliminary information about the proposed action and invited public comment. Concurrently, a scoping letter was mailed to more than 3,300 individuals and groups identified as potentially interested in the proposed action and analysis. The Agencies received more than 650 letters in response to the Notice of Intent and the scoping letter. Public comments contained a wide variety of suggestions for issues and alternatives. Alternative 3 was developed in response to scoping comments suggesting ways to cut costs and achieve resource objectives by making changes to the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines. Chapter 2 of this SEIS includes a discussion of other alternatives that were considered, but eliminated from detailed study and explains why they were eliminated. Many issues raised during scoping are relevant to this analysis and are addressed in Chapter 3&4. Other issues were raised that are not pertinent to this analysis. Eor example, some comments suggested ending all commercial logging everywhere in the Northwest while another was concerned about the inadequacies of city planning rules intended to protect the environment. These issues have not been considered further. Some comments suggested that all old-growth forests need to be protected and placed off-limits to logging. They suggested that protecting all remaining late-successional and old-growth forests on federally managed lands would meet the purpose and need. Protecting additional old- growth forests outside the Late-Successional and Riparian Reserves would be akin to changing land allocations by creating additional Late-Successional Reserves. Various levels of reserves, including one which protected all remaining old-growth stands, were a key element in designing the ten alternatives originally considered for the Northwest Forest Plan, the SEIS this SEIS supplements. Some comments suggested eliminating the Survey and Manage mitigation measure would lead to Survey and Manage species being listed as threatened or endangered. Others were concerned that eliminating the Survey and Manage mitigation measure could lead to loss of old-growth forests, unraveling of ecological systems, and loss of social values. Other commenters provided different viewpoints and suggested eliminating the Survey and Manage mitigation measure was needed so that fuel reduction, thinning, and other restoration treatments could proceed without further delays. 7 Draft SEIS - To Remove or Modify the Survey and Manage Mitigation Measure Standards and Guidelines Preferred Alternative Based on consideration of the environmental consequences. Alternative 2, with the mitigation described in Chapter 3&4, was found to best meet the purpose and need, and is the preferred alternative. Chapter 2 - The Alternatives Chapter 2 - The Alternatives Introduction This chapter presents three alternatives including the Proposed Action. Alternative 1 is the No-Action Alternative and would retain the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines. Under Alternative 2, the Proposed Action, the Agencies propose to amend 28 land and resource management plans within the range of the northern spotted owl by removing the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines. Alternative 3 was developed in response to comments received during scoping suggesting that the purpose and need would be better met by alternatives other than the proposed action. Alternative 3 is similar to the proposed action except the Agencies would amend 28 land and resource management plans by modifying the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines. These modifications include: (1) removing provisions for uncommon species; (2) eliminating the requirement to conduct pre-disturbance surveys in non- late-successional and non-old-growth forest stands; (3) changing the review process for excepting known sites from management; and, (4) changing the review process for excepting pre-disturbance survey requirements for Wildland Fire for Resource Benefits. All alternatives apply to lands administered by the Forest Service and BUM within the Northwest Forest Plan area. Alternatives 2 and 3 are hereafter referred to collectively as the action alternatives. The Northwest Forest Plan, adopted in 1994 and amended in 2001, amended land and resource management plans on all administrative units of the Forest Service and BUM in western Washington, western Oregon, and northwestern California. The Northwest Forest Plan provides substantial direction for managing habitat for late-successional and old-growth forest related species within the range of the northern spotted owl. The Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines proposed for removal in the Proposed Action were added to the Northwest Forest Plan as a mitigation measure for species that were rare or about which little was known. References to the Northwest Forest Plan in this SEIS are intended as references to those portions of individual land and resource management plans that were amended by the 1994 and/or 2001 Records of Decision. The land and resource management plans are those for each of the Forest Service and BUM administrative units in the Pacific Northwest and northwestern California within the range of the northern spotted owl (Figure 1-1). Background for Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines The Northwest Forest Plan In the late 1980’s and early 1990’s, conflicts between protecting late-successional and old-growth forest related species habitats and providing a predictable and sustainable level of timber harvest and other forest management activities brought many Forest Service and BLM forest m.anagement activities to an impasse. At a 1-day forest conference in April 1993, then President Clinton directed the Agencies to prepare a plan that would balance an appropriate level of protection for wildlife, forest health, and waterways, with the human and economic dimensions dependent on timber sales. 9 Draft SEIS - To Remove or Modify the Survey and Manage Mitigation Measure Standards and Guidelines The Northwest Forest Plan resulting from this charge was adopted in April 1994, and applies to Forest Service and BLM-administered lands in western Washington, western Oregon, and northwestern California. The Northwest Forest Plan has the dual purpose of providing for management of habitat for late-successional and old-growth forest related species while providing for a predictable and sustainable level of timber harvest. The Northwest Forest Plan primarily takes a landscape approach to managing species associated with late-successional and old-growth forests. Of the 24.5 million federally-managed acres within the Northwest Forest Plan area, almost 20 million acres either provide for old-growth and late- successional forest conditions under designation of Congressionally Reserved Areas, or they are managed for such conditions in Late-Successional Reserves, Managed Late-Successional Areas, Administratively Withdrawn Areas, or Riparian Reserves. The remaining 4.5 million acres are allocated to Matrix or Adaptive Management Areas where the bulk of timber outputs are produced. The Northwest Forest Plan was based on the Forest Ecosystem Management Assessment Team (FEMAT) report. The FEMAT was chartered in April 1993 by former President Clinton to write a scientifically based plan for “protecting the long-term health of our forests, our wildlife, and our waterways. ..in balance with...a predictable and sustainable level of timber sales and non- timber resources...” within the range of the northern spotted owl (USDA, USDI 1994a, p. 1-4). In addition to a no-action option, the FEMAT developed nine options for meeting this charge. The nine options served as the basis for the alternatives presented in the Northwest Forest Plan Final SEIS (USDA, USDI 1994a). The Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines The FEMAT assembled panels of experts to assess the likelihood of meeting various population stability and distribution outcomes for 1,120 species for 7 of their 10 options, including Option 9, the basis for the Northwest Forest Plan (USDA et al. 1993, pp. IV-40 through IV-49, IV-77, and IV-185). The panels used an outcome-based scale to assess the likelihood that habitat would support populations of these species. Although the majority of these species, including the northern spotted owl and all other threatened or endangered species, rated well, the panels could not confidently say that Option 9 would provide for stabilized, well-distributed populations for 100 years across federally managed lands for some of the lichens, bryophytes, fungi, arthropods, mollusks, and other species. FEMAT (USDA et al. 1993, p. 11-34) reported: “ftflie lack of information on the species and their responses to habitat manipulations coupled with the large proportion that are inherently rare and/or locally endemic and likely sensitive to habitat disturbance gave the expert panels and our Team little confidence to predict many species/groups would find habitat well distributed within the range of the northern spotted owl for the next 100 years. These results are troubling. ” Option 9 was identified as the preferred alternative in the Northwest Forest Plan Draft SEIS published for public comment in July 1993. In this option, approximately 80 percent of the federally managed lands in the Northwest Forest Plan area were allocated to reserves. Late in the analysis process, in response to concerns about the above species, the SEIS team formed a scientist-staffed “Additional Species Analysis Team” to reconsider these species and suggest mitigation measures (USDA, USDI 1994a, Appendix J2). This team selected species for additional analysis based on: (1) species ratings in the FEMAT report; (2) expected changes in Alternative 9 after the Northwest Forest Plan Draft SEIS; (3) cumulative effects on species; and, (4) additional species-specific criteria (USDA, USDI 1994a, pp. J2-2 through J2-3). Through this screening process, the team identified 486 species and 4 arthropod guilds for additional analysis. Following their analysis, the team described 23 possible mitigation measures to reduce species concerns. None of these mitigation measures, including the eight eventually adopted, resolved the issues of persistence or extirpation for most of these species, and overall species ratings were 10 Chapter! - The Alternatives not recalculated. Although these mitigation measures reduced the likelihood species would be disturbed by management activities, they are only a part of the overall strategy of the Northwest Forest Plan to meet species management objectives. The Northwest Forest Plan network of reserves and other designated areas, along with many other standards and guidelines, work together to provide habitat and protect species. The Survey and Manage mitigation measure was among the eight mitigation measures adopted, from the additional species analysis, in the final version of the Northwest Forest Plan (USDA, USDI 1994b, pp. C-4 through C-6 and Table C-3). Species were assigned to the Survey and Manage mitigation measure to increase the likelihood of a stable, well-distributed population of the species across federally managed lands or to decrease the likelihood of their extirpation on federally managed lands in the Northwest Forest Plan area. The late addition of the Survey and Manage mitigation measure to the Northwest Forest Plan SEIS precluded a detailed effects analysis. For example, the Survey and Manage mitigation measure was predicted to have a “relatively minor” effect on maintaining a functional and interconnected late-successional forest ecosystem. Other effects were “likely to improve at least slightly” when compared to effects without the eight mitigation measures (USDA, USDI 1994a, p. 3&4-39). Similarly, except for a 6 million board foot (MMBF) reduction in Probable Sale Quantity (PSQ) to reflect management of Survey and Manage sites known at that time, the Northwest Forest Plan Final SEIS did not quantify socioeconomic effects of these mitigation measures, noting only that these measures “... add to the uncertainty of PSQ calculations” (USDA, USDI 1994a, p. 3&4-267). The Final SEIS provided only a rough estimate for some species, and no estimate at all for others, of the overall acreage involved in managing known sites for Survey and Manage species (USDA, USDI 1994a, p. J2-40 and others). The Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines were developed for 23 bryophytes (mosses and liverworts), 234 fungi, 81 lichens, 58 mollusks (snails and slugs), 5 amphibians (salamanders), 17 vascular plants (plants with stems), 1 mammal (red tree vole), and 4 arthropod guilds (insects and related species). Species were assigned to one or more of the following four categories; (1) manage known sites where species are located; (2) survey prior to potential habitat-disturbing activities; (3) conduct extensive surveys; and, (4) conduct general regional surveys to find additional locations and learn more about the species and its habitat. The Agencies have made changes to the Survey and Manage mitigation measure since it was first adopted in 1994. Changes were made in species assignments in 1995 and 1996, primarily to correct errors in the original category assignments. The Agencies also changed the implementation date for pre-disturbance surveys for 32 species in Eebruary 1999, and again for 7 of these same species in Eebruary 2000. The 2000 Survey and Manage SEIS By 1998, the Agencies had sufficient experience implementing the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines to conclude the requirements were not clear, efficient, or practicable. An SEIS to assess alternative ways to correct these problems was begun in November 1998. The SEIS considered alternatives with an objective of continuing to provide the same level of protection intended by the 1994 Record of Decision. In January 2001, the Agencies issued a Record of Decision, based on the Survey and Manage Final SEIS 2000, which amended the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines to: (1) clarify required management; (2) remove unnecessary and duplicative or conflicting requirements; (3) add a process for changing species between categories; and, (4) add a process for adding or removing species from Survey and Manage, based on new information. Species would be removed when they fail to meet the three basic criteria for Survey and Manage: (1) does the species have suitable habitat in the Northwest Forest Plan area? (2) is the species associated with late-successional or old-growth forest? and, (3) does the reserve system and other standards and guidelines provide for a reasonable assurance of species persistence? The Survey and Manage Final SEIS 2000, Record of Decision, and Standards and Guidelines are on the internet at http://www.or.blm.gov/nwfpnepa/. Draft SEIS - To Remove or Modify the Sitrvey and Manage Mitigation Measure Standards and Guidelines The 2001 Record of Decision led to removal of 72 (of more than 400) species from Survey and Manage in all or part of their range. An additional 21 species were removed in June 2002 under the annual species review process established in the 2001 Record of Decision, and 8 more species were removed in March 2003. For those species removed because they were not associated with late-successional or old-growth forests, their known sites continue to be managed until the Agencies decide whether to add them to the Special Status Species Programs. There are currently 304 species and 4 arthropod guilds included in the Survey and Manage mitigation measure with management requirements for each species based on characteristics of relative rarity and whether they can be reasonably located and identified during site-specific field surveys. For 69 species. Survey and Manage requires site-specific “pre-disturbance” surveys prior to most management activities. In addition, “strategic” surveys are required for all Survey and Manage species to learn more about the species and its habitat. Strategic surveys gather needed information on species for which pre-disturbance surveys are not practical. Information gathered through strategic surveys provides the basis for making species management decisions. When surveys locate a species, a “known site” is established and is managed. These sites normally range from 1/4 to 10 acres in size. To date there are nearly 40,000 records of species sightings and known sites. However, for about two-thirds of the species, each has been found on fewer than 20 sites. Only 9 species have been found on more than 200 sites. The current Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines are summarized under Alternative 1 (No-Action) later in this chapter. The current Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines, Sections I through VIII and XII are included in Appendix 1. The Lawsuit and Settlement Agreement On December 26, 2001, the Douglas Timber Operators, Inc., an Oregon corporation, and American Forest Resource Council, an Oregon Corporation, filed a complaint against the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Interior in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon (Douglas Timber Operators, et al. v. Secretary of Agriculture, et al.. Civil No. 01-6378-AA (D. Oregon). The complaint alleged that the January 2001 amendment to the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines “...transferred more than 81,000 acres of timber-producing NWFP forest land into permanent reserves, resulting in a 7% reduction on the regional timber volume permitted under the NWFP - a loss of 51 million board feet (MMBF) of timber sales per year in perpetuity” and “added uncertainty.” The complaint also alleged that the 2001 Survey and Manage amendment is “. . .in violation of substantive and procedural requirements of the Oregon and California and Coos Bay Wagon Road Grant Lands Act (O&C Act), 43 U.S.C. § 1181a, the National Forest Management Act (NFMA), 16 U.S.C. §§ 1600, et seq., the Multiple-Use Sustained- Yield (MUSY) Act of 1960, 16 U.S.C § 528-531, and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA), 43 U.S.C. §§ 1701, et seq.” The Association of O&C Counties intervened on behalf of plaintiffs and filed an Intervenor’s Complaint substantially similar to the Douglas Timber Operators, et al., amended complaint. The Secretaries filed an answer denying all allegations. On September 30, 2002, “to avoid further costly litigation, and without admission of any liability or wrongdoing by either party,” the parties signed a Settlement Agreement. They agreed the BLM and Forest Service would supplement the Survey and Manage Final SEIS 2000 by “considering an alternative that replaces the Survey and Manage mitigation requirements with existing Forest Service and BLM special status species programs to achieve the goals of the Northwest Forest Plan through a more streamlined process.” Douglas Timber Operators, Inc., and American Forest Resource Council agreed to stay their complaint until July 28, 2003, or the issuance of the Record of Decision, whichever comes first, and agreed to dismiss their previous complaint and seek no reimbursement for related legal fees when the Record of Decision is issued. Preparing this SEIS and the associated Record of Decision will fully meet the Secretaries’ commitment under the Settlement Agreement. 12 Chapter! - The Alternatives This Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations for implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) direct that agencies supplement an environmental impact statement: if the agency makes substantial changes in the proposed action that are relevant to environmental concerns; or if there are significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts” (40 CFR 1502.9(c)(l)(i) and (ii)). In this case, the Settlement Agreement directs the agencies to consider . .an alternative that replaces the Survey and Manage mitigation measure with existing Eorest Service and BLM special status species programs.” This constitutes a significant new circumstance that warrants preparation of a supplemental environmental impact statement. Because the proposal is not an action separate and distinct from the Northwest Eorest Plan and the land and resource management plans of the Agencies, a new EIS is not warranted. Therefore, it is appropriate to analyze the effects of this proposal in an SEIS to the Pinal SEIS for Amendment to the Survey and Manage, Protection Buffer, and other Mitigation Measures Standards and Guidelines; the Northwest Eorest Plan Final SEIS; and the Final EISs for the BLM and Forest Service land and resource management plans referenced in the Northwest Forest Plan or prepared subsequent to it. The analysis in this SEIS relies heavily on the analysis in the Northwest Forest Plan Final SEIS and the Final SEIS for Amendment to the Survey and Manage, Protection Buffer, and other Mitigation Measures Standards and Guidelines, and, to a lesser extent, on the EISs prepared for the land and resource management plans of the Agencies. Such data and analyses are incorporated in this SEIS by reference (per 40 CFR 1502.21) to the extent they continue to be relevant to, and are not superseded by, the contents of this SEIS. As described above and in more detail later in this chapter, selecting one of the action alternatives would result in amending the Agencies’ land and resource management plans that either incorporate or were amended by the 1994 and 2001 Records of Decision. Changing Standards and Guidelines The Northwest Forest Plan Standards and Guidelines specify that “decisions to change ...[these] standards and guidelines will be made only through the adoption, revision, or amendment of these documents following appropriate public participation, NEPA procedures, and coordination with the Regional Interagency Executive Committee” and “the amendments will be reviewed by the Regional Interagency Executive Committee to assure consistency with the objectives of these standards and guidelines” (USDA, USDI 1994b, p. E-18). The alternative proposed for selection for this SEIS will be submitted to the Regional Interagency Executive Committee (RIEC) for review prior to finalizing the Record of Decision. The Planning Area The planning area for this SEIS is the federally administered land within the Northwest Forest Plan area, which corresponds to the range of the northern spotted owl as defined in 1994 (see Figure 1-1). These lands are located in western Washington, western Oregon, and northwestern California. 13 Draft SEIS - To Remove or Modify the Surx'ey and Manage Mitigation Measure Standards and Guidelines Although all federal lands within the Northwest Forest Plan area are included in the analysis and are considered to contribute habitat for late-successional and old-growth forest related species, including species affected by Survey and Manage, the management direction addressed in this SEIS applies only to those lands managed by the Forest Service, BLM, and 5,400 acres managed by the Coquille Tribe. No management direction is included here for other federally managed lands, other Native American trust lands, or state and private lands. However, cumulative impacts from expected management activities on these other lands, as appropriate, were considered as part of the effects analysis in this SEIS. Relationship of Alternatives to Existing Management Plans If one of the action alternatives is selected, the direction established by the Record of Decision for this SEIS will remove all or part of the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines in all land and resource management plans for Forest Service and BLM administrative units within the Northwest Forest Plan area. The Coquille Indian Tribe currently manages approximately 5,400 acres of forest lands (Coquille Forest) under the same standards and guidelines as the adjacent federal land management agency (Coos Bay District, BLM). By amending the land and resource management plans for the BLM Coos Bay District, the action alternatives would, in effect, also remove all or part of the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines from 5,400 acres of tribal trust lands owned by the Coquille Indian Tribe. The Coquille Tribe is in a unique situation because it is the only tribe in the Northwest Forest Plan area that must comply with Northwest Forest Plan Standards and Guidelines. Bureau of Land Management Adoption of one of the action alternatives would be consistent with 43 CFR 1610.5-5 and would amend the resource management plans for the Coos Bay, Eugene, Medford, Roseburg, and Salem districts in Oregon; the Klamath Falls Resource Area of the Lakeview District, also in Oregon; and the Areata, Redding, and Ukiah field offices in California. The King Range National Conservation Area Management Plan in the Areata Field Office would also be amended. Because the action alternatives would modify only a small portion of each of these resource management plans, plan revisions would not be necessary (43 CFR 1610.5-6). When a decision is made to prepare an environmental impact statement, the amending process follows the same procedure required for preparation and approval of the plan (43 CFR 1610); consideration is limited to that portion of the plan being considered for amendment. The BLM resource management planning process includes nine steps. The planning steps that pertain to this SEIS include issue identification, data collection, formulation of alternatives, estimation of effects, selection of the preferred alternative, and selection of the proposed plan amendment. If several plans are being amended simultaneously, a single environmental impact statement may be prepared to cover all amendments (43 CFR 1610.5-5). Forest Service Adoption of one of the action alternatives would result in amendment of the National Forest land and resource management plans for the Gifford Pinchot, Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie, Okanogan, Olympic, and Wenatchee National Forests in Washington and the Deschutes, Mt. Hood, Rogue River, Siskiyou, Siuslaw, Umpqua, Willamette, and Winema National Forests in Oregon, in Region 14 Chapter 2 - The Alternatives 6; and the Klamath, Lassen, Mendocino, Modoc, Shasta-Trinity, and Six Rivers National Forests in California in Region 5. If an amendment to a Forest Plan results in “a significant change in the plan,” the NFMA and its 1982 implementing regulations under which this SEIS is prepared, require that the amendment process follow the procedures used in the initial development of the plan. If the proposed change in the plan is not significant, public notification and completion of the NEPA procedures are still required (16 USC 1604 (f)(4) and 36 CER 219.10(f)). Determining whether a plan amendment is a significant change uses different criteria than those used in evaluating significance in the NEPA process. For the NFMA requirement, the Forest Service Manual (FSM 1922.51 and .52) provides specific direction. FSM 1922.51 - Changes to the Forest Plan that are Not SignificanT. Changes to the forest plan that are not significant can result from: 1. Actions that do not significan tly alter the multiple-use goals and objectives for the long- term land and resource management. The actions proposed in these alternatives would not alter the objectives and the multiple-use goals of the land and resource management plans as amended by the Northwest Forest Plan. The purpose of the action alternatives is to facilitate the achievement of those goals and objectives. The action alternatives will continue to provide species protection in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, while making more Agency resources available for other forest management priorities, and simplifying processes so needed management actions can move forward more expeditiously. The underlying need to which the action alternatives are responding is the need for achievement of the objectives originally established for the Northwest Forest Plan, to the extent these objectives are frustrated by the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines. 2. Adjustments of management area boundaries or management prescriptions resulting from further on-site analysis when the adjustments do not cause significant changes in the multiple-use goals and objectives for long-term land and resource management. The action alternatives would change management on a portion of sites occupied by rare and uncommon species. The action alternatives would not reduce species protection below legally required levels or increase timber harvest beyond levels identified in the Northwest Forest Plan Final SEIS. The action alternatives would reduce costs and improve the Forest Service’ ability to conduct forest management activities at a level described in the land and resource management plans. Selection of one of the action alternatives would enable the Forest Service to better meet the long-term goals and objectives currently identified in land and resource management plans. 3. Minor changes in standards and guidelines. The action alternatives would remove all or part of a mitigation measure added during preparation of the Northwest Forest Plan Final SEIS. The action alternatives would not significantly change any key elements of the underlying strategy or standards and guidelines. Removal of all or part the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines would be a relatively minor change because; (1) the Northwest Forest Plan is an ecosystem-based approach that relies primarily on a system of reserves and standards and guidelines to accomplish its primary objectives; (2) the underlying land and resource management plans also provide habitat for the affected species; and, (3) Survey and Manage species that qualify would probably be given Sensitive Species status. The effects discussion in Chapter 3&4 helps quantify the change within the context of the Northwest Forest Plan. 15 Draft SEIS - To Remove or Modify the Survey and Manage Mitigation Measure Standards and Guidelines 4. Opportunities for additional management practices that will contribute to achievement of the management prescription. The action alternatives are specifically designed to better and more efficiently meet the underlying needs identified in the Northwest Forest Plan Final SEIS. FSM 1922.52 - Changes to the Forest Plan that are Significant. The following examples are indicative of circumstances that may cause a significant change to a forest plan. 1. Changes that would significantly alter the long-term relationship between levels of multiple-use goods and services originally projected (36 CFR 219.10(e)). The changes proposed by the action alternatives would help achieve, not alter, the relationship between the levels of multiple-use goods and services originally projected. Species currently included in the Survey and Manage mitigation measure will continue to receive protection as required to meet all applicable laws and regulations. 2. Changes that may have an important effect on the entire forest plan or affect land and resources throughout a large portion of the planning area during the planning period. The changes proposed would remove all or part of a mitigation measure added late in the preparation of the Northwest Forest Plan. The action alternatives do not change land allocations or other elements of the Northwest Forest Plan. There will be a reduction in the area managed as known species sites; however, no other Northwest Forest Plan resource objective is dependent upon those sites. There is predicted to be an increase in timber harvest from current levels; but the current levels are well below the predictions originally displayed in the Northwest Forest Plan Final SEIS. The purpose of the proposal is to achieve levels of timber harvest that were expected when the Northwest Forest Plan was established in 1994. Thus, the action alternatives will help achieve (and not change) the multiple-use goals and objectives set forth in the Northwest Forest Plan Record of Decision. The Alternatives Overview The following section describes the alternatives in detail. Under Alternative 1, the No-Action Alternative, implementation of all current elements of the Northwest Forest Plan would continue including the Survey and Manage mitigation measure, the underlying land and resource management plans, and relevant agency programs and policies. Under Alternative 2, the Proposed Action, the Agencies propose to amend 28 land and resource management plans within the range of the northern spotted owl to remove the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines. Under Alternative 3, the Agencies would amend 28 land and resource management plans to modify the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines by: (1) removing provisions for uncommon species; (2) eliminating the requirement to conduct pre-disturbance surveys in non-late-successional and non-old-growth forest stands; (3) changing the review process for excepting known sites from management; and, (4) changing the review process for excepting pre-disturbance survey requirements for Wildland Fire for Resource Benefits. Separate from this proposal, the Agencies reviewed the 304 Survey and Manage species to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the Agencies’ existing Special Status Species Programs. It is anticipated that Survey and Manage species that are eligible for the Agencies’ Special Status Species Programs will be added to those programs if the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines are removed. Under Alternative 2, 130 of the 304 Survey and Manage species plus 4 arthropod guilds would be eligible for inclusion in one or more of the Agencies’ existing Special 16 Chapter 2 - The Alternatives Status Species Programs. Under Alternative 3, 26 Survey and Manage species plus 4 arthropod guilds would be removed from the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines and 9 would be eligible for inclusion in one or more of the Agencies’ existing Special Status Species Programs. The Agencies update their Special Status Species lists on a regular schedule, when state heritage programs publish new rankings, or when other information indicates a need. Both Forest Service regions delayed or deferred inclusion of additional species in their Sensitive Species programs because the species were already included in the Survey and Manage mitigation measure. With the proposed removal of the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines under the Proposed Action, and with new information about Survey and Manage species as a result of recent pre- disturbance and strategic surveys, the Agencies requested updated rankings from state heritage programs. From this and other species information, each agency determined what additional species should be added to the Special Status Species Programs in the absence of the Survey and Manage mitigation measure. The Agencies believe this is consistent with the Settlement Agreement language requiring “. . .considering an alternative that replaces the Survey and Manage mitigation requirements with existing Forest Service and BUM special status species programs to achieve the goals of the Northwest Forest Plan through a more streamlined process.” The BUM’S Special Status Species program and the Forest Service’ Sensitive Species program are referred to collectively in this SEIS as the Agencies’ Special Status Species Programs. Elements Common to All Alternatives Special Status Species Programs All alternatives include the Agencies’ Special Status Species Programs. In general, these programs seek to further the objectives of the Endangered Species Act by preventing future listings of species as threatened or endangered. They are described in detail under Alternative 2 (Proposed Action). There are also several assumptions regarding these programs that are shared by all alternatives. 1. Any Survey and Manage species the Agencies have determined eligible for their Special Status Species Programs may be added to those programs at the discretion of the Agency. 2. For analysis purposes, it is assumed any species removed from Survey and Manage will be added to Agency Special Status Species Programs for which it is eligible (see Table 2-8). 3. Within the Northwest Forest Plan area, where species have been included in both Survey and Manage and an Agencies’ Special Status Species Program, the species has been managed primarily under the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines. This is because the Survey and Manage Standards and Guidelines generally meet or exceed the requirements of the Special Status Species Programs. It is assumed this policy will continue for species that become listed in both programs under any alternative selected. 4. Species that were previously removed from Survey and Manage because they were determined not to be closely associated with late-successional or old-growth forests, will continue to have their known sites managed until the Agencies’ have determined whether to add them to their Special Status Species Programs. Legal Requirements All alternatives meet all legal and regulatory requirements of the FLPMA, NFMA, and Endangered Species Act (ESA). Aside from the Survey and Manage mitigation measure, all alternatives retain all other elements of the Northwest Eorest Plan. The alternatives include the standards and guidelines of the underlying land and resource management plans for the individual BLM and Eorest Service administrative units. 17 Draft SEIS - To Re?nove or Modify the Survey and Manage Mitigation Measure Standards and Guidelines Endangered Species Act Consultation To conform to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the BLM and Forest Service will prepare a Biological Assessment for the Final SEIS, and consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and/or National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries) to the extent required by the ESA.
