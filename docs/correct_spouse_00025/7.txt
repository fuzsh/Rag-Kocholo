Sonia Agarwal, estranged wife of Tamil director Selvaraghavan, is alive and has not committed suicide, contrary to rumors. The actress who has filed for divorce against her director husband is simply taking some time off and is staying with her parents. The couple married in 2006 after Sonia debuted into Tamil cinema with Selvaraghavan’s film, Kadhal Kondaen, has sought for divorce with mutual consent. This is after rumors of Selvaraghavan’s newfound relationship with Andrea (while working on his latest film, Aayirathil Oruvan) sprang up.
