At last the marriage relation between versatile Director Selvaraghavan and sexy actress Sonia Agarwal is getting broken with a divorce on 12th of this month. This three years old married couple has filed for ‘divorce by mutual consent’ in August last year at the family court in Egmore in Chennai. When close relatives and friends from both the sides have tried to patch up the issue, there was no much use as their relation further deteriorated.

To surprise, Sonia Agarwal was initially reluctant to go for a divorce and tried to cope up with time but unfortunately they have headed no where and divorce seems to be the only option left. Selvaraghavan will pay a huge amount as alimony to Sonia Agarwal for breaking the marriage bond which he hasn’t disclosed to media. ‘It is too personal and I would like to keep quiet on this issue and I believe silence is golden,’ said Selvaraghavan.

Finally, the latest buzz is that Selvaraghavan is in love with one of the cute actress who is very short in age compared to this versatile director and one could see both of them getting remarried very soon. This cute actress has even acted in one of his movies and looking for few more in his direction. Now guess…who is that bubbly colorful babe?
