It seems director Selvaraghavan and Sonia Agarwal have finally decided to enter wedlock. The latter introduced by Selva in Kadhal Kondein was romantically linked with the director.

Though a section of the press had carried reports about the two getting married, the two often denied them. Meanwhile, Sonia Agarwal had reportedly not accepted any new offers for she was preparing herself for the wedding.

Finally, Selvaraghavan broke his silence on Thursday. The director, taking part in a function organized to mark the D-Cinema release of his latest offing Pudhupettai, said he would marry Sonia Agarwal this October. He said, ‘after the wedding, I would direct a movie featuring

Vijay in the lead role’.

It may be recalled that Dhanush (Selvaraghavan’s brother) had married Aishwarya Rajinikanth, daughter of Rajinikanth, last year.
