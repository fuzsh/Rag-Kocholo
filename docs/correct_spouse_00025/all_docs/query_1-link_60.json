        "text": "Sonia Agarwal was on top when she quit acting to settle down with director Selvaraghavan, but she has decided to return to the big screen with an aptly titled \"Oru Nadigaiyin Vaakkumoolam' after her divorce and she is very happy about it.\n\nSonia Agarwal attracted the audience with her charms and surprised many with her well-toned figure recently at the audio launch function of her forthcoming Tamil movie 'Oru Nadigaiyin Vaakkumoolam'. Well, this lead to speculations which claimed that she took short cuts to reduce her excessive weight by undergoing liposuction.\n\nReacting to this, Sonia Agarwal has said that there is no need for her to trim down the fat. The actress says that she has been putting her best efforts to get into a good shape and the rumours on undergoing liposuction are baseless. Indeed, she has hired a special trainer to instruct on her workouts and diet, which has benefited her a lot.\n\nSonia Agarwal has started her second innings on a right note. The actress has signed a couple of interesting project including 'Oru Nadigaiyin Vaakkumoolam', which is a heroine-oriented film. In her other movie 'Matha Pitha Guru' she will be seen in triple roles."
