        "text": "Chennai: “I want to do films that have a good storyline. Quality matters the most for me,” says actress Sonia Agarwal.\n\nThanimai starring Sonia Agarwal hit the screens recently. She played a Lankan refugee Yazhini in it and her performance was widely acclaimed.\n\nSpeaking to News Today, she says, “It is a happy sight that young filmmakers are coming up with movies that have a say for heroines.” Busy acting in small screen and cinema, she says, “I take things as it comes.”\n\nExcerpts from her interview:\n\nQ: Tell us about Thanimai?\n\nA: It is a performance-oriented film. It is about the problems faced by a Lankan refugee who comes to Chennai and the problems that she encounters. It is a heroine-centric movie. Thankfully, my performance is widely acclaimed. I liked the story very much.\n\nQ: Your jouney from Kadhal Konden till Thanimai?\n\nA: I still remember the first day of the shoot of Kadhal Konden. I was new to Chennai and I hardly know anyone here. But I had faith in Selvaraghavan. I just did what Selvaraghavan, Dhanush and others in the team asked me to do on screen. Eventually it came out good. Having acted in films like Kadhal Konden and 7G Rainbow Colony, I became confident and took the challenge to do any kind of role.\n\nQ: How did you celebrate your first success in cinema?\n\nA: It is still fresh in my mind, When Kadhal Konden completed 50 days in theatres, my producer called me to visit cinema halls for celebrations. I remember audience recognising me and calling me Dhivya Dhivya. It was a pleasant moment.\n\nQ: Are your choosy these days?\n\nA: Of course yes. I want to do films that have a good storyline. Quality matters the most for me.\n\nQ: Thiruttu Payale was a huge hit in your career. How was it to be part of the film?\n\nA: It was again a different story. All credits to the team for coming up with a different film. I shot several scenes in Australia. I still remember my shooting days for Thiruttu Payalae. It is no doubt a movie to reckon with in my career.\n\nQ: Do you miss Selvaraghavan?\n\nA: I won’t say no. We knew each other for over 10 years. Unfortunately our marriage did not work. I like his innocence a lot."
