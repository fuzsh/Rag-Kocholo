Sonia starred in Selvaraghavan's big hit Kadhal Kondein opposite Dhanush.Â She went on to act in Selvaraghavan's next two films and eventually got married to him and quit films.\n\nHer new TV show, Naanal, will be produced by Khushboo, for Kalaignar TV. Khushboo has written the story as well.\n\nRobert Rajasekar -- the man who directed blockbusters like Chinna Poovae Mella Pesu, Palaivana Cholai and Manasukkul Mathapoo -- will make his debut as a TV show director.\n\nSonia will play Radhika, who is like a naanal (creeper) -- no adversity can destroy her or her spirit. Even after losing her husband, she successfully withstands many a storm that blows into her life, and helps people so that she can live a happy and peaceful life."
