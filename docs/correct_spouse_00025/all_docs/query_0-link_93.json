        "text": "Biography:\n\nSonia Agarwal is an Indian actress who has primarily worked in Tamil cinema and a few Telugu, Malayalam, and Kannada films. She gained recognition for her notable performances in movies like Kaadhal Kondein (2003), 7G Rainbow Colony (2004), and Pudhupettai (2006).\n\nKaadhal Kondein, featuring her former brother-in-law Dhanush, was a tremendous success. Sonia received widespread acclaim for her portrayal of Divya in the film, which brought her into the spotlight and earned her the ITFA Best New Actress Award at the International Tamil Film Awards in 2004. She appeared alongside Silambarasan in Kovil and Vijay in Madhurey. Following her roles in the films Oru Kalluriyin Kathai and Oru Naal Oru Kanavu in 2005, both of which did not perform well at the box office, she secured roles in Thiruttu Payale and Pudhupettai. Thiruttu Payale, directed by Susi Ganesan, was a highly successful film, while Pudhupettai, another Selvaraghavan film, received critical acclaim.\n\nSonia Agarwal was born in Chandigarh, and her mother tongue is Punjabi. She married Selvaraghavan, a director in Tamil cinema, in December 2006. After her marriage, she quit acting but later returned to the industry. The couple divorced in 2010.\n\nDuring her school days, Sonia was offered to act in a serial on Zee TV. She debuted with the 2002 Telugu movie Nee Premakai, where she played a small role. She then acted in a Kannada film called Chandu opposite Sudeep.\n\nAfter her divorce, Sonia returned, playing a supporting role in the multi-starrer Vaanam. Subsequently, she quickly signed up for four projects, three in Tamil and one in Malayalam. Her subsequent releases included Sadhurangam, opposite Srikanth again, in 2011 and Oru Nadigayin Vakku Moolam in early 2012. However, her films Poi Sollathedi and Achchamenndi did not fare well at the box office. In 2018, she signed up for four Malayalam films."
