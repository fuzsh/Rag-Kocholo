Other films include Kovil and Madhurey, opposite Silambarasan and Vijay, respectively, Oru Kalluriyan Kathai and Oru Naal Oru Kanavu in 2005. After the failure of her two films in 2005, she played a role in Thiruttu Payale directed by Susi Ganesan, which became a major hit. While that film came to her success, another film called Pudhupettai, did only moderately well in the theatres, which is also her most recent film, even after three years of its release. Her next film, Karu Pazhaniappan, is still remaining to be released.\n\nAfter her divorce, she has said to be seen in a Telugu movie, Upendra, as a widow.
