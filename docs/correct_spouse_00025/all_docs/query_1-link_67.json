        "text": "Among movie buffs, Dhanush’s 2006 film Pudhupettai has a cult following. In the film, Dhanush plays North Chennai student Kokki Kumar, who grows up to become a criminal.\n\nSonia Agarwal and Sneha were the leading ladies in this Tamil movie. Following its theatrical release, Pudhupettai’s box office performance fell short of trade commentators’ forecasts. But even then, the movie developed a respectable cult following and fans have yearned for a sequel over the years. Yuvan Shankar Raja’s soundtrack for the film was positively reviewed. Dhanush’s brother Selvaraghavan directed Pudupettai.\n\nNow, it looks like the demand for a Pudupettai sequel has finally caught the attention of filmmaker and actor Selvaraghavan as he has now hinted towards Pudhupettai 2.\n\nOn Wednesday, Selvaraghavan posted a candid selfie of himself on X (formerly Twitter) with the caption, “Hopefully Pudhupettai 2 should happen this year.” This is all that there was to the post on X and he teased his fans with the possibility of a sequel without divulging any extra information at all.\n\nNo information about the cast and crew was divulged and it is not known whether Dhanush will star in the sequel or not. It is also not known whether pre-production of the film has already started or not. Fans will have to wait for a more transparent announcement from Selvaraghavan or any other member of the cast.\n\nDhanush is currently filming for his film with Sekhar Kammula, and he has a packed lineup as he already announced a film each with directors Mari Selvaraj and Arun Matheswaran. He is also in talks for the lead role in music composer Ilaiayaraja’s biopic.\n\nOn the other hand, Selvaraghavan declared a sequel to the 2010 film Aayirathil Oruvan three years ago, and he is now filming for the sequel to 7G Rainbow Colony. So, if the Pudhupettai sequel is in the pipeline as well, it looks like the director will be immersed in back-to-back sequels."
