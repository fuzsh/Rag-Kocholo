        "text": "Selvaraghavan burst onto the Tamil film scene with a bang with Kaadal Kondein. The film, which had his younger brother Dhanush and Sonia Agarwal in the lead, was a huge success. So was his next film 7G Rainbow Colony with Sonia Agarwal and Arvind Krishna in the lead. His third film Pudupettai also had Dhanush and Sonia Agarwal in the lead along with Sneha.\n\nHe fell for his leading lady Sonia Agarwal and married her but the marriage didn't last long.\n\nHaving made five films in seven years, Selvaraghavan is considered one of the brightest young film-makers in Tamil."
