        "text": "Question: Some of the journalists have seen you traveling with Selvaraghavan in a car around the city. But you refuse to accept that you are in love with him?\n\nSonia Agarwal: If I travel with a person in a car, does it mean that I am in love with him? Yes, I love him. I see him as my teacher, philosopher and guide and not as you all think. I want to tell you one thing frankly, if I am in love with Selvaragavan and going to marry him, neither my parents nor his family would object it. Then why should I hide these facts from you?\n\nQuestion: Then why do lot of magazines and various newspapers gossip about you?\n\nSonia Agarwal: Whoever meets me in person, they talk with me well, but write all nonsense which I can't tolerate. Through this interview I request all of you to criticize me to the core about my acting in films, but please donâ€™t spoil my privacy.\n\nQuestion: Sometimes you appear as if you have some personal worries?\n\nSonia Agarwal: I don't want to say or talk anything personal. My aim in life is to entrench myself in the Tamil cine field as a heroine.\n\nQuestion: Are you acting in other language films?\n\nSonia Agarwal: It all depends on the reputation that a film producing company has in the field. Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam are the same to me. I was cheated twice by film companies. They settled my account with a meager advance. Some production companies did not pay the money for hotel where I stayed then.\n\nQuestion: Who is your role model?\n\nSonia Agarwal: My role model is Madhuri Dixit. In tamil I like Jothika, Meena and Simran.\n\nQuestion: Who are your favorite heroes?\n\nSonia Agarwal: I am a fan of Vijay. Other heroes whom I like are Simbhu and Srikanth."
