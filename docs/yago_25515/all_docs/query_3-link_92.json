        "text": "Here is a delightful, easygoing Amaro. It was created in 1885 by Stanislao Cobianchi as an homage to the country of Montenegro and its Princess Elena of Montenegro (who would marry the future king of Italy). It's not a very bitter Amaro, for that try Elisir Novasalus. But if you want a delicious, relaxing digestif, Amaro Montenegro should totally be your jam. Spicy clove and citrus are well integrated with vanilla to balance out this delightful Italian classic.\n\n- JGM"
