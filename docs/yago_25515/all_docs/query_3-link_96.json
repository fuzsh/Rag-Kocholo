The amaro was first produced by Stanislao Cobianchi in 1885 and was originally called Elisir Lungavita. In 1896, it was renamed Amaro Montenegro, after Princess Elena of Montenegro who married Crown Prince Victor Emmanuel, the future King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy .\n\nIt's bitter and herbaceous, spicy and floral, chocolate and caramel, fresh and balsamic, vanilla and red fruits, and warm and tropical.\n\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\n\nBe the first to get exclusive offers and the latest news on our products directly to your inbox."
