        "text": "Definition and Variety.\n\nAmaro, the Italian word for “bitter,” refers to a category of herbal liqueurs known as Amari. While various bitters exist globally, Amaro is distinctively Italian, crafted from a base alcohol infused with an array of botanicals such as herbs, roots, flowers, and spices. The flavor profiles of Amari are diverse, ranging from bitter to sweet, and herbal to floral, influenced by the specific botanicals used. This diversity ensures a wide array of styles catering to different personal preferences.\n\nAmaro Montenegro’s Legacy\n\nAmaro’s origins trace back to ancient Greek and Roman times when it was primarily an herb-infused wine. By the 1800s, the use of distilled alcohol replaced wine in Amaro production. Both monasteries and families produced Amaro, often consumed for its perceived medicinal properties. These traditional recipes have been meticulously passed down through generations.\n\nFor over 135 years, Amaro Montenegro has epitomized perfect balance. The brand was established in Bologna by Stanislao Cobianchi in 1885. Stanislao, who was born in 1862, defied his family’s wish for him to join the priesthood, choosing instead a path of adventure. His travels exposed him to a vast array of exotic botanicals, inspiring him to create exceptional elixirs and liqueurs upon his return to Italy.\n\nAfter years of experimentation, Stanislao founded the Cobianchi Stanislao Steam Distillery. His creation, originally named Elisir Lungavita, was later renamed Amaro Montenegro in honor of Princess Elena of Montenegro’s marriage to Prince Victor Emmanuel III, who would become the King of Italy. This renaming celebrated the princess’s beauty and the momentous occasion.\n\nCraftsmanship and Ingredients.\n\nAmaro Montenegro is crafted using 40 botanicals, including spices, dried fruits, roots, seeds, bark, citrus peel, rhizomes, flowers, and wood species from around the globe. Of these, only 13 botanicals are publicly known, and the original recipe has remained unchanged since 1885. Matteo Bonoli, our Master Herbalist, continues Stanislao’s legacy by sourcing and selecting the finest ingredients, maintaining rigorous standards of quality.\n\nProduction Process\n\nThe production involves three critical stages: boiling, maceration, and distillation. First, selected botanicals are finely ground and boiled to extract their flavors. The maceration process involves soaking other botanicals in a solution of water and beet sugar alcohol, conducted in tanks of varying sizes to achieve desired aromas. This stage can take between 20 to 30 days. For distillation, a specific maceration is processed in 1000-liter copper pot stills, where the alcohol vapor, enriched with distinct aromas, is condensed into a high-quality spirit.\n\nThe resulting 12 essences are meticulously blended to create the six notes of Amaro Montenegro: Warm & Tropical, Bitter & Herbaceous, Spicy & Floral, Sweet & Roasted, and Fresh & Balsamic. The final and most crucial stage involves adding the Premio, a secret micro-distillation of five rare botanicals, known only to the Master Herbalist and a select few. The Premio is so potent and powerful, that for every 15,000 liters of Amaro Montenegro only 1 liter of Premio is required. Premio means “prize” in Italian, and without the Premio, we do not have Amaro Montenegro."
