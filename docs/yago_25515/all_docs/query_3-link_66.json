        "text": "According to the royal family's old website, royalmontenegro.com, as of 2004 there were 21 male Petrovitch-Njegosh's in two other branches of the family, an heirless head of the house can nominate one these as his successor. Alternatively the website says they could appoint a custodian of the Crown or abolish the salic law.\n\nRoyal House of Montenegro\n\n.\n\nThe question is not if there are any male descendants, but what is the actual relation of the Montenegran royals to their own society and culture?\n\nFirst of all, this was a monarchy that started as a 'vladika' principality; which means a semi-theocrasy.. No one argues that it should become the same again, but I see in the wiki profiles of the members of the royal house that they all have zero reference to their confession -are they Orthodox to begin with?\n\nAlso, the videos of the 'heir', other than being in hideous english, don't portray any awareness or relation to the culture, the country and the main issues it faces. What would they add to the orientation and identity of Montenegro if they were to assume royal office again? What do they stand for in terms of values, at the end of the day? Shouldn't someone among them talk about these?\n\nForgive me -and correct me- if I'm wrong, but I see in the members of this family nothing but another group of international jet-setters that just discovered they have a former royal title to use in indulging in their international pr...\n\nAnd they're going nowhere\n\nWas King Nicholas of Montenegro politically ambitious for his daughters to make good matches and marry well?\n\nAt first, no.\n\nThe King (then Prince) had 9 daughters. Their \"royal keeping\" for unmarried daughters was very expensive for a poor state of Montenegro and they were \"too valuable\" to marry them off to someone who was a Montenegrin subject as, in that case, his family would \"rise above others\" and on the other hand, Princesses were \"not too valuable\" to marry someone from other royal families, as they had neither wealth nor blood ties with anyone.\n\nAs they were, at first, destined not to be married, he wanted to build the monastery just for them in an island on Skadar lake, where they would live. He often said:\"Ohhh, poor me, what shall I do with all these daughters...\"\n\nBut, through time, things changed. They were all sent to Russia, Smolny Institute, as protégés of the Russian Emperor to be educated there.\n\nWhen his first daughter Zorka married Prince Peter, future King of Serbia, King Nicholas thought otherwise.\n\nOnce a foreign diplomat asked him: \"What can you export from this poor country anyway?\" to which he replied, \"You underestimate my daughters.\"\n\nHe realized that his daughters were sought through Europe, just because they were tall, dark and had no blood ties to any royal family...This meant that by marrying them, other royal families would straighten their bloodlines ruined by huge amount intermarriages.\n\nThe best example is Princess Elena of Montenegro. Prince Vittorio Emanuele of Savoy was the son of first cousins (King Umberto and Queen Margherita were son and daughter of Savoy brothers) and because of that he was only 153cm tall. A marriage with some sickly European Princess who was also a result of intermarriage was out of question and they spotted Princess Elena of Montenegro, who was dark and 180cm tall and who would straighten the Royal bloodline, as Vittorio Emanuele's first cousin and potential heir, Duke of Aosta, was a healthy man, 193cm tall. That's why they chose an insignificant Princess who brought them back \"health\".\n\nThe same was with Grand Duke Peter of Russia, who was a sickly child. His parents wanted a healthy bride and they have chosen Princess Milica of Montenegro, who later became Grand Duchess of Russia. When the marriage occurred it was now her advantage that she was a Princess from an Orthodox, brotherly Slavic country, healthy, tall, dark and wasn't a product of an intermarriage.\n\nThe rest of the sisters followed. So, their disadvantage at first became their advantage at last."
