        "text": "The history of Montenegro and Serbia was an inspiration to Nikola Tesla\n\nMontenegro is a mountainous Balkan country of rough beauty, located on the Adriatic coast, across from Italy. Montenegrins are Serbian people. The history of Montenegro, is the history of the wars and battles, fought against foreign domination. Montenegro is the only Balkan country that stood free and independent throughout centuries, resisting constant foreign invasions.\n\nOutstanding leaders of Crnojevic and Petrovic dynasties govern Montenegro throughout centuries. Montenegro formed part of the medieval Serbian Kingdom. After 1355 the Kingdom began to collapse, and Montenegro became a independent state. Crnojevic dynasty ruled Montenegro until 1516. Eastern Orthodox Bishops of Petrovic dynasty ruled until 1851. That year, Montenegrins Ruler Danilo I took the title of prince. Montenegro became a kingdom in 1910. Through marriages of his daughters with European dynasties King Nikola of Montenegro was called, \"The Father in law of Europe.\" Elena, Queen of Italy, was King Nikola's daughter.\n\nThe culture history of Montenegro was influenced by Venezia, its Italian neighbor across the Adriatic sea. The first printing press in Montenegro was brought from Venezia, less than a decade after Johannes Gutenberg discovered printing press in Germany during the mid-1400's. The first printed book by south Slavs so called \"Octoih\" was printed in Montenegro in the printing press called \"OBOD\".\n\nAbove: The first printed book by south Slavs so called \"Octoih\" was printed in Montenegro in the printing press called \"OBOD\".\n\nNikola Tesla holding a gas-filled phosphor-coated light bulb which was illuminated without wires by an electromagnetic field from the \"Tesla Coil\".\n\nAbove: The Order of Danilo given to Nikola Tesla by King Nikola of Monetegro in 1895.\n\nAbove: The Diploma of the Order of Danilo in Cyrillic.\n\nNikola Tesla called his friend Robert Underwood Johnson, \"Luka Filipov\" and Madame Johnson, \"Miss Filipov\". Luka Filipov was a Serbian Montenegrin hero from the \"Battle on Vucji Do\" in Montenegro, 1876 between Montenegrins and Turks. Luka Filipov captured in the \"Battle on Vucji Do\" the Turkish commander Osman Pasa and brought him to the Montenegrin King Nikola Petrovic. Above his heroism in the \"Battle on Vucji Do\" the famous Serbian poet Zmaj Jovan Jovanovic wrote a poem called \"Luka Filipov\". Nikola Tesla translated the poem from Serbian to English and the poem was published in Century Magazine.\n\nAbove: Picture from famous Serbian artist Petar Lubarda, of the Battle of Vucji Do in 1876. This battle was between the Montenegrins and Turks, in Vucji Do\n\n(translation: \"Valley of Wolves\") where the outnumbered Montenegrin Army defeated the larger Turkish Army. After this battle, Montenegro was recognized as an independent state by the Congress of Berlin in 1878.\n\nDuring the Battle of Vucji Do, Luka Filipov, Montenegrin hero, captured the Turkish Commander Osman Pasha and brought him alive to King Nikola of Montenegro. Serbian poet, Jovan Jovanovic Zmaj, wrote the poem \"Luka Filipov\" which Nikola Tesla translated into English. The poem was published in Century Magazine.\n\nAbove: Serbian poet, Jovan Jovanovic Zmaj, wrote the poem \"Luka Filipov\".\n\nAbove: Place where the Moraca River and Ribnica River met in Podgorica, Montenegro.
