        "meta_description": "Amaro Montenegro is a traditional amaro distilled in Bologna, Italy. It is made from a secret blend of 40 botanicals including vanilla, orange peels and eucalyptus. The amaro was first produced by Stanislao Cobianchi in 1885 and was originally called Elisir Lungavita. In 1896, it was renamed Amaro Montenegro, after Princess Elena of Montenegro who married Crown Prince Victor Emmanuel, the future King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy. Its production takes place in the factory of San Lazzaro di Savena (Province of Bologna) of Montenegro Srl.Cobianchi travelled from continent to continent collecting 40 rinds, woods, seeds, rhizomes, flowers, fruits, citrus peels, roots, stems and leaves.Amaro Montenegro is the result of a process that has been passed down through generations, unchanged since 1885. The Master Herbalist oversees the entire production process, just as Cobianchi once did.Aroma: Earthy, woodsy, baking spices along with warming spices.Taste: Medium sweetness with medium intensity that isn't cloying. Delicate citrus notes and baking spices finishing with a very pleasant mild bitterness carrying along to a dry finish.",
