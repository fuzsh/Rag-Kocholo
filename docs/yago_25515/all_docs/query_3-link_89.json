        "text": "‚ÄòAm I in paradise or on the moon?‚Äô George Bernard Shaw famously quipped from the top of Mount Lovƒáen in Montenegro. Adriatic sea stretches to the horizon to its west and on a clear day you can see Italy; to the south is Skadar Lake, beyond it ‚Äì the dark, mysterious hills of Albania; in the north is Bay of Kotor, Europe‚Äôs southernmost fjord‚Ä¶\n\nTo get to Kotor Fjord from the historical capital, Cetinje, once the only way lead through the mountains, up the steep, narrow and oddly curved road‚Ä¶ When you look at it from the top of the mountain ‚Äì a capital letter M is clearly seen, it seems to be engraved into the landscape by the road‚Ä¶ The legend is that French architect commissioned to oversee the construction in this way declared his love for beautiful Montenegrin Queen Milena ‚Äì and had ran away from the country for his life! Whether the story is true we can not know, but Montenegrin women are known for their beauty ‚Äì King Nikola and Queen Milena‚Äôs daughters had married into the most influential European dynasties and our King will be nick-named ‚Äúthe father in law of Europe‚Äù!\n\nElena of Montenegro (born Princess Jelena Petroviƒá-Njego≈° of Montenegro) was wife of Victor Emmanuel III and Queen of Italy from 1900 until 1946; by Italians she was named ‚ÄúLa Bella Elena‚Äù ‚Äì beautiful Elena.\n\nTwo of our other princesses, with keen interest in the occult, Milica and Anastasia, had married into Romanov dynasty and it was them who later on introduced mysterious Rasputin to the Russian Court.\n\nIf you read serious historical sources ‚Äì you‚Äôll learn of False Tsar Stephen the Little; for my thesis i studied carefully archives of Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the diplomatic correspondence exchanged between two courts ‚Äì Montenegrins were fully aware that their ruler had a false identity; but did they care? Not the least ‚Äì he was a great ruler and that was the only thing that mattered; where he came from and who he was in reality ‚Äì nobody knows until today.\n\nThe longest war in history , Montenegrin ‚Äì Japanese war, lasted from 1905 ‚Äì 2006; when Russia declared war to Japan, the teeny kingdom sided with its ally and also proclaimed war to the Country of the Raising Sun! Albeit the answer was never received ‚Äì Montenegrin gesture was not merely symbolical ‚Äì the best warriors chosen from the most reputable of the tribes, along with Russians went to war, fought bravely, won victories and received medals! Again, all of it is documented in the archives of Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs where the names of these people who fought against Samurai and the awards they received are meticulously listed!\n\nThen super powers got busy with their own business and it‚Äôs only in 2006, when high representative of Japanese Government traveled to Montenegro to recognize our regained independence ‚Äì that the truce was signed!\n\nMontenegro is one of the oldest countries in Europe ‚Äì Principality Doclea, the great-grand mother of Montenegro, was formed in 9th century; it shall have a turbulent personal history, like many outstandingly beautiful and rebellious princesses did ‚Ä¶ In 1042 it shall run away from what once was considered her home ‚Äì the mighty Byzantine empire, in 1421, it shall get kidnapped by a Serbian Despotate; princess by birthright would renounce its nobility by joining the working class family of Yugoslav people and shall remain quite happy in its new home, as long as her inborn sense of human dignity was not jeopardized and her honorable name brought down to dirt. That‚Äôs when the princess decided it was the high time she hit the road and became a sovereign queen. (In 2006. Montenegro has regained its independence.)\n\nIn an earlier essay, Death by chocolate, i‚Äôve written on Montenegrin cuisine.\n\nFavorite entr√©e is Njegushi cheese stored in oil ‚Äì let alone that goats and cows are fed freely on the nearest valley on herbs and grass typical of this region, the cheese is later smoked at home and the village of Njegushi is unique for its blend of sea-air with the air from the mountains; two climates intersecting in that very spot give the food a taste that‚Äôs impossible to second.\n\nAfter the cheese is imbued with this unique aroma ‚Äì it‚Äôs stored in olive oil and that‚Äôs a story unto itself, because the oil is hand made by monks in the monasteries on the coast; at the end you get a a small piece of cheese that‚Äôs threaded with history of this magical kingdom of Black Mountains. The cheese, it seems, is served mostly to go along with the story of our rulers, Petrovic Njegos dynasty, and their tribe of Njegusi; the monks, while making the oil ‚Äì read prayers and these prayers give you the strength of a tiny rebellious nation, which resisted its numerous oppressors for centuries and never in its history was enslaved.\n\nAs you would be snacking on the cheese, you would get served Montenegrin brandy ‚Äì Prvijenac, which is made by unique technologies and in limited quantities; it comes in numbered bottles, like a part of a collection ‚Äì which basically it is.\n\nThere is that joke ‚Äì the proverbial Russian, American and Montenegrin argued whose beverage is the best and , as expected, without having agreed ‚Äì they decided to conduct an experiment; a group of mice got treated to Whiskey, Vodka and Prvijenac respectively and the effects were observed and recorded.\n\nThe mouse who had Whiskey started walking around nonchalantly, with a seductive aura of a western-movie actor, he demanded his own Colt to protect the mice maidens and after a while rode into the sunset.\n\nThe mouse who had Vodka started quoting Russian Classics and despairing over the current state of the world‚Äôs affairs, lady mice were admiring him while silently wiping off tears with tiny handkerchiefs and praying that this hero wins the duel against the usual bad guy.\n\nThe mouse who drank of Prvijenac just stood there.\n\nAfter some time, he stood on his back paws and yelled out in a human voice, carrying the menace of vengeance high and low: Ladies, back to the hole, you have no business here! Where is the bloody cat?! I‚Äôll do it away with my bare hands! ‚ÄòNuff of this oppression! Come out, you villain, fight as a man!\n\nYou get an idea‚Ä¶\n\nHere you can see the gallery of pictures from Kotor Fjord, Scadar lake and other shots of the amazing Black Mountains.\n\nP.S. Just in case you are wondering what‚Äôs gotten into me to write on my country once again ‚Äì it‚Äôs that after bitching about FP in how NOT to get freshly pressed, EVER, i do think the guys behind Daily Prompt deserve cudos for coming up with today‚Äôs ‚ÄúLocal Flavor‚Äò. üòâ\n\n0.000000 0.000000\n\nLet me take you on a journey to the magical kingdom, hidden high up in the mountain wreaths of Balkan Peninsula; let me take you to Montenegro!\n\nMy country today celebrates its Statehood Day ‚Äì on July 13 1878 Berlin Congress recognized Montenegro as the twenty-seventh independent state in the world; on this day in 1941 Montenegrins sided with the partisan movement and raised against Nazi occupiers.\n\n‚ÄòAm I in paradise or on the moon?‚Äô George Bernard Shaw famously quipped from the top of Mt Lovƒáen; to its west ‚Äì Adriatic sea stretches to the horizon and on a clear day you can see Italy; to the south is Skadar Lake, beyond it ‚Äì the dark, mysterious hills of Albania; to the north is Kotor Fjord‚Ä¶\n\nTo arrive from historical capital Cetinje to Kotor Fjord ‚Äì once the only way was through the mountains, via a steep, narrow and somehow unusually curvy road‚Ä¶ When you look at it from the top of the mountain ‚Äì you clearly see a capital letter M which seems to be engraved into the landscape by the road ‚Äì the legend says that French architect commissioned to oversee the construction in this way declared his love for beautiful Montenegrin Queen Milena ‚Äì and had ran away from the country for his life! Whether the story is true we can not know, but Montenegrin women are indeed known for their beauty ‚Äì King Nikola and Queen Milena‚Äôs daughters had married into the most influential European dynasties and our King will be nick-named ‚Äúthe father in law of Europe‚Äù!\n\nElena of Montenegro (born Princess Jelena Petroviƒá-Njego≈° of Montenegro) was wife of Victor Emmanuel III and Queen of Italy from 1900 until 1946; by Italians she was named ‚ÄúLa Bella Elena‚Äù ‚Äì beautiful Elena.\n\nTwo of our other princesses, with keen interest in the occult, Milica and Anastasia, had married into Romanov dynasty and it was them who later on introduced mysterious Rasputin to the Russian Court.\n\nIt is difficult to speak realistically of this country ‚Äì not only because it immediately gets under your skin and you become overwhelmed by its beauty and allure ‚Äì but because traditionally here myth and history go hand in hand.\n\nIf you read serious historical sources ‚Äì you‚Äôll learn of False Tsar Stephen the Little; for my PhD thesis i studied carefully archives of Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the diplomatic correspondence exchanged between two courts ‚Äì Montenegrins were fully aware that their ruler had a false identity; but did they care? Not the least ‚Äì he was a great ruler and that was the only thing that mattered; where he came from and who he was in reality ‚Äì nobody knows until today.\n\nDo you know which was the longest war in history? Montenegrin ‚Äì Japanese war which lasted from 1905 ‚Äì 2006! When Russia declared war to Japan, the teeny kingdom sided with its ally and also proclaimed war to the Country of the Raising Sun! Albeit the answer was never received ‚Äì Montenegrin gesture was not merely symbolical ‚Äì the best warriors chosen from the most reputable of the tribes, along with Russians went to war, fought bravely, won victories and received medals! Again, all of it is documented in the archives of Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs where the names of these people who fought against Samurai and the awards they received are meticulously listed!\n\nThen super powers got busy with their own business ‚Äì and the war was almost forgotten‚Ä¶ Still, in Montenegro a story is told how group of TV journalists from Japan came to film the customs of these intriguing highlanders ‚Äì one elder in the village high up in the mountains, upon hearing which was their country of origin ‚Äì got his riffle and held everyone hostage until much later local police released them, but not without long negotiations with the old man!\n\nAnd it‚Äôs only in 2006, when High Representative of Japanese Government traveled to Montenegro to recognize our regained independence ‚Äì that the truce was signed!\n\nCircumstances were such that I returned to my country only when i was in my late twenties; for you, here is an excerpt from my memoir on how i imagined it, while growing up far, far away from it:\n\nI would wake up to the repetitive, dull noise of tennis balls bouncing off the paved court in the immediate vicinity ‚Äì it was placed just across the narrow chestnut alley from our house. It is the only noise i can recall in the Prague‚Äôs residential area where we lived, the cars had no business in our one-way street and the whole neighborhood had an aura of a creepily silence.\n\nThe lack of noise matched the reserved and distant attitude of the people i‚Äôd occasionally meet in the street ‚Äì albeit they were few; this was a residential area, historical villas were placed in a resigned distance from each other, like estranged spouses ‚Äì still vaguely familiar, as the houses were built in the same period and quite alike ‚Äì yet by choice alien to each other.\n\nI never knew who lived in other houses with flamboyantly decorated facades, residents would come and go by their big black cars and only by small silk flags with golden fringes i could guess which country they came from ‚Äì so far ‚Äì while looking through the rounded window of my room ‚Äì i had recognized French tricolor and red Turkish flag with its white crescent moon and a star.\n\nI‚Äôve seen many Turkish flags ‚Äì in centuries long, fierce battles with Turks, the highlander warrior tribes ‚Äì ancestors from father‚Äôs side of the family ‚Äì had seized numerous Ottoman army flags and had brought them to the capital of the small country high in mountain wreaths of Balkan Peninsula, the former Kingdom of Montenegro. I counted them, in the museum which used to be the court of our only king ‚Äì Nikola, they were forty four, forty four torn and soaked in blood flags seized in battles which small nation had won against the big and evil empire which wanted to enslave us, or so i was thought‚Ä¶ Prague, a coming of age story; Copyright¬©2012 Lena Ruth Stefanovic, All Rights Reserved\n\nThis essay was inspired by a great article Barbara Moor wrote for Llewellyn ‚Äì ‚ÄúVacation with the cards‚Äù: http://www.llewellyn.com/blog/2012/07/vacation-with-the-cards/comment-page-1/#comment-40587\n\nI hope all of you will one day come to visit Montenegro ‚Äì until then enjoy Tarot of the Black Mountain which genius artist Emily Carding devoted to this land and its people: http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/cards/black-mountain/\n\nThe Sun card is from amazing Tarot of Venice (G.
