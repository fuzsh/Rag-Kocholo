The inhabitants displayed the greatest enthusiasm, and throughout the day royal salutes were fired.\n\nThe bride wore the Montenegrin national costume and was everywhere affectionately welcomed. After returning to Prince Danilo’s [pictured above] palace, the pair appeared on the balcony and were greeted with acclamations by the populace. The town was tastefully decorated, and tonight most of the buildings were brilliantly illuminated and a torchlight procession marched through the streets."
