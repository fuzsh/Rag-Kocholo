        "text": "REFERENCE TITLE NAME BORN DIED TITLE NAME BORN DIED COMMENTS 40 King Nicholas I \"Nikola\" of Montenegro 1841 1921 Milena Vukotic 1847 1923 Montenegro was ruled by prince-bishops from 1515 until 1851 when Daniel I (1826-1860) established himself as secular ruler. Daniel's efforts to reform and modernise Montenegro led to his murder. Another source mentions Danilo was assassinated in August 1860 as he was boarding a ship at the port of Kotor (also called Cattaro) by Todor Kadic, from the Bjelopavlici tribe, the motive being over Danilo's mistreatment of Kadic's family.\n\nA Newspaper report mentions Danilo was seriously wounded on 11 August 1860 by a pistol shot and died two days later on 13 August from his injuries.\n\nNicholas succeeded his uncle Danilo I as Sovereign Prince of Montenegro on 13 August 1860. He became King of Montenegro on 28 August 1910, on the occasion of his Golden Jubilee, when the Kingdom of Montenegro was proclaimed and accorded International recognition as a Sovereign Kingdom. Montenegro was annexed to the new Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Yugoslavia) on 13 November 1918 but was not recognised by King Nicholas I and he was forced into exile.\n\nDeath report of King Nicholas I.\n\nDeath report of Queen Milena.\n\nA New York Times article dated 22 October 1921 reported Nicholas I's wife Queen Milena signed a Decree which had the effect of disbanding and no longer recognising the de jure Government of Montenegro.\n\nAn article following the death of King Nicholas I and titled A QUAINT KING - NICHOLAS OF MONTENEGRO.\n\nNicholas and some of his family had to flee Montenegro in 1916 when Austrian forces overun the country. In 1923 police in Cetinje discovered four big cases of jewels and several cases of archives belonging to the late King. 40.1 Princess Zorka of Montenegro 1864 1890 King Peter I of Serbia 1844 1921 See 7.5 - Peter became King of Serbia on 15 June 1903 following the murder of King Alexander I of Serbia (from the unrelated House of Obrenovich) and his wife Queen Drago in their palace during an army revolt. The Kingdom of Serbia was renamed the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in 1918.\n\nIs this how Peter came to marry Zorka?\n\nSome interesting observations after the wedding of Zorka and Peter.\n\nNot long after the death of Zorka there was an estrangement between her father Nicholas and her husband Peter over the dower of a million roubles which had been given to Zorka by Tsar Alexander III of all the Russias on her marriage to Peter in 1883.\n\nA brief report on the death of Zorka who died from Peritonitis in childbirth of her son Prince Andrej , Andrej also died the same day 40.2 Princess Militza of Montenegro 1866 1951 Grand Duke Peter of Russia 1864 1931 See 4.972 - Militza and her husband Peter in 1900 were most fortunate in surviving a train crash in which at least sixteen people died and sixty were injured. They had been attending the funeral of King Umberto I of Italy.\n\nA brief report on the marriage of Militza and Peter 40.3 Princess Anastasia \"Stana\" of Montenegro 1868 1935 Duke George of Leuchtenberg 1852 1912 See 18.277 - It was reported that the Czar of Russia had promulgated a ukase dissolving the marriage of the Duke of Leuchtenberg to Princess Anastasia, this created a sensation. 40.3 Princess Anastasia \"Stana\" of Montenegro 1868 1935 Grand Duke Nicholas of Russia 1856 1929 See 4.971 - An interesting account of Grand Duke Nicholas as a military commander. 40.4 Princess Marija \"Maritza\" of Montenegro 1869 1885 40.5 King Danilo II of Montenegro 1871 1939 Duchess Auguste Jutta of Mecklenburg-Strelitz 1880 1946 See 24.8212 - Wrestling, an unusual sport in which Duchess Auguste Jutta participated.\n\nDanilo abdicated on 7 March in 1921 in favour of his nephew Michael only one week after succeeding his father as King of Montenegro 40.6 Princess Jelena \"Elena\" of Montenegro 1873 1952 King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy 1869 1947 See 8.121 - Victor Emmanuel became unpopular because of his long association with Benito Mussolini and abdicated on 9 May 1946 in favour of his son Umberto. He died in exile in Egypt.\n\nA report on the wedding of Jelena \"Elena\" and Victor Emmanuel (at the time of marriage in 1896 he was Prince of Naples).\n\nEmperor Nicholas II, gave Elena a dower of 1.000,000 roubles (about £163,000) and diamonds to the value of 2,000,000 francs (£80,000) in 1896 on her approaching marriage to Victor Emmanuel.\n\nSome \"Reminiscences of the Beautiful Elena of Montenegro\" written shortly after her husband Victor Emmanuel succeeded his father as King of Italy 40.7 Princess Anna of Montenegro 1874 1971 Prince Franz Josef \"Franzjos\" of Battenberg 1861 1924 See 5.145 40.8 Princess Sophia of Montenegro 1876 1876 40.9 Prince Mirko of Montenegro (Grand Duke of Grahovo and Zetà) 1879 1918 Natalija Constantinovic 1882 1950 Natalija was a second cousin to King Alexander of Serbia (House of Obrenovic) (1876-1903) who along with his wife Queen Draga were assassinated in Belgrade 10 Jun 1903. Natalija's paternal grandmother Anna Obrenovic (1821-1868) and King Alexander of Serbia's grandfather Milosh Obrenovic (1829-1861) were sister/brother.\n\nA short report on a duel between Mirko and his elder brother Danilo which arose when Mirko insulted his brothers wife Auguste Jutta.\n\nA report on the engagement of Mirko and Natalija and implications to the throne of Serbia. Apparently there was some thoughts that Mirko should be elected King of Serbia following the assassination of King Alexander.\n\nNatalija and Mirko were divorced in 1917. Natalija married secondly 9 January 1920 Count Gaston Errembault de Dudzeele in Eastbourne, England. 40.91 Prince Shchepac \"Stephan\" of Montenegro 1903 1908 40.92 Prince Stanislav of Montenegro 1905 1908 40.93 King Michael I of Montenegro 1908 1986 Geneviève Prigent 1919 1990 Michael succeeded his uncle Danilo as King of Montenegro (under the Co-Regency of his Grandmother, Milena, the Dowager Queen Consort and his Prime Minister (General Anto Gvozdenovic ). He became a prisoner in a Nazi concentration camp during World War II having refused to return to Montenegro as puppet King. 40.931 Crown Prince Nicholas \"Nikola\" II of Montenegro 1944 Francine Navarro 1950 2008 Nicholas succeeded his father, King Michael, as titular King of Montenegro (and uses the style Crown Prince Nikola II) on 24 March 1986.\n\nIt looks as if Crown Prince Nikola II has three grandchildren. 40.9311 Princess Altinaï of Montenegro 1977 Anton Martynov 1969 Informaton relating to Anton Martynov appears to be scant. I have taken his year of birth from this page 40.93111 Nikolai Martynov 2009 40.9312 Hereditary Prince Boris of Montenegro (Grand Duke of Grahovo and Zetà) 1980 Véronique Canas da Silva 1976 40.93121 Princess Milena of Montenegro 2008 40.93122 Princess Antonia of Montenegro 2013 40.94 Prince Paul of Montenegro (Prince of Raska) 1910 1933 40.95 Prince Emanuel of Montenegro 1912 1928 40.J Princess Xenia of Montenegro 1881 1960 It was reported in a 1903 newspaper article that Princess Xenia had jilted King Alexander I (1876-1903) (from the Obrenovich dynasty). Xenia was sent to Belgrade to meet her potential husband for the first time, she took one look at him and fled.\n\nThe same article mentioned she was engaged to the divorced Grand Duke Ernst Ludwig of Hesse and by Rhine, obviously this didn't materialise in their marriage.\n\nXenia was an avid photographer (login now required to access paid site) and one of the first if not first woman driver in the Balkans."
