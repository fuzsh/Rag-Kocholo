        "text": "Nicholas I (born October 7 [September 25, Old Style], 1841, Njeguši, Montenegro—died March 2, 1921, Antibes, France) was a prince (1860–1910) and then king (1910–18) of Montenegro, who transformed his small principality into a sovereign European nation.\n\nHeir presumptive to his uncle Danilo II, who was childless, Nicholas came to the throne in August 1860 after Danilo’s assassination. Educated abroad in Paris and Trieste, he was throughout his reign faced with the difficult task of popularizing Western ways. A strong prince and an outstanding leader, he fought the Turks in 1862 and again in 1876, when he conducted a brilliant campaign. At the Congress of Berlin (1878), Montenegro was doubled in size, with an outlet to the Adriatic, and recognized as a sovereign state. Alexander II of Russia, whose friendship with Nicholas dated back to a state visit to St. Petersburg in 1868, supplied him regularly with money and arms and at one point favoured his candidacy for the Serbian throne. A clever diplomat, Nicholas strengthened his dynastic connections through the marriages of his daughters: Elena married (1896) the future king of Italy, Victor Emmanuel III; Zorka married Peter Karadjordjević (1883) but died before he became king of Serbia; two other daughters married Russian grand dukes. In Balkan politics Nicholas conspired, sometimes with, and sometimes against, Serbian rulers, to create a South Slav state.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz"
