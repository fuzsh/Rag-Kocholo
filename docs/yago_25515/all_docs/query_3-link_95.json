The name \"Duklja\" derived from \"Dioclea\", a city whose ruins lie just outside present-day Podgorica and which governed the Roman province of the same name which included the territory of what is today the republic of Montenegro . Duklja, along with its neighbours Zahumlje (later known as Hercegovina) and Trebinje, absorbed the state of Serbia which disintegrated after the death of Prince Časlav in [960]. Little is known about Duklja in the late 10th century, but it must have been a state of some regional influence. Ivan Vladimir Knez of Duklja is recorded as entering an alliance with Emperor Basileios II in the late 990s, which was of sufficient significance in the regional politics of the day to provoke Samuil Tsar of the Bulgarians into attacking Duklja in 997. After a period of captivity in exile, Ivan Vladimir was restored as ruler in Duklja, presumably under Bulgarian vassalship. The reconstruction of the family of the early rulers of Duklja (see Chapter 1) is based almost entirely on the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, allegedly written in the 12th century (see below), although (if that dating is correct) presumably based on earlier sources which have since disappeared. It is not known how far this reconstruction is factually accurate.\n\nDuklja was conquered by Byzantium in the 1030s, but Dukljan revival was triggered by the restoration of Knez Vojislav and his conquest of most of neighbouring Zahumlje. Vojislav's son Mihailo received a royal crown from the Pope in 1077. King Mihailo died in [1081/82], but most of his numerous family of sons had been killed in battle during his lifetime. The Dukljan state started to disintegrate towards the end of the 11th century after King Konstantin Bodin was captured during a Byzantine offensive, and with the secession of Raka, Bosnia and Zahumlje from Dukljan control. There followed a series of short-lived rulers, sponsored either by Byzantium or Serbia. Duklja was divided administratively into upa (counties), the name of one of which, Zeta, came to be applied to the whole country from the 1080s.\n\nSerbia completed its conquest of Zeta by 1189 and Nemanja Grand upan of Serbia installed his older son Vukan as Grand Knez of Zeta in 1190 (see Chapter 2). Vukan was passed over in the Serbian succession in favour of his younger brother, and asserted Zetan independence from Serbia, which was recognised by the Pope and by Hungary. However, this period of autonomy terminated in 1216 when Stjepan Grand upan of Serbia regained control over Zeta. The territory remained under Serbian control until Serbia was annexed by the Ottomans in 1441, although some nobles enjoyed a certain degree of autonomy over different parts of the country during the 14th and early 15th centuries (see Chapter 3). The area formerly known as Zeta gradually became known as \"Crna Gora\" [Black Mountain = Montenegro] under the rule of the Crnojevići in the 15th century . During the 1440s, Stjepan Crnojević Djuraević achieved virtual autonomy in Montenegro and defeated three attempted invasions from Serbia, although he was eventually obliged to accept Venetian suzerainty over both upper and lower Zeta. The principality of Montenegro was finally suppressed by the Ottomans in 1496, when it became an Ottoman province.\n\nA major difficulty exists in the reconstruction of the families of early Slav rulers in the southern Balkans as most of the details, which have passed for primary source information, are based on what appear to be falsifications created in the 16th and 17th centuries. The problem has been analysed most recently by Solange Bujan . Her hypothesis is that the documents were produced in the following chronological order:\n\n·Li Annali della Nobilissima Republica di Ragusa, a late medieval text which survives only in an Italian translation .\n\n· the Regum Dalmatiæ et Croatiæ Gesta, written by Marko Marulić at Split in 1510 and published for the first time by Ivan Lučić in 1656 .\n\n· the Rè di Dalmatia et altri luoghi vicino dellIllirico dallanno del Signore 495, fina 1161, published in Italian by Mauro Orbini in 1601 in the second part of his Regno de gli Slavi, which, according to the author incorporated the text of an end-12th century manuscript in old slav, but which was elaborated based on Li Annali and the Regum Dalmatiæ.\n\n· the Presbyteri Diocleatis Regnum Slavorum, known in English as the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, also published by Ivan Lučić in 1656, which he states is a Latin version of the 12th century text on which Orbini´s Rè di Dalmatia was supposedly based .\n\nBujan´s conclusion is that the 12th century text never existed and that the so-called Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja is unauthentic and unreliable. Attention is drawn to the parts of the present document which are based only on this text and which should therefore be used with great caution.\n\nChapter 1. KNEZ (later KINGS) of DUKLJA\n\nLarge parts of this chapter are based only on the falsification known as the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, discussed in the Introduction to the present document. Only information which is shown below as corroborated in Byzantine sources or later charters can be considered reliable. It is possible that all the early generations of this family are fictional.\n\n1. [PREDIMIR (-bur church of St Peter, Serbia). upan of Trebinje. The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that \"King Predimir\" was buried in the \"church of St Peter in the episcopate of Rassa\" . m (after [969]) PRECHVALA, daughter of --- upan of Serbia & his wife ---. The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that \"the Zupan of Rassa fled to King Predimir along with his two sons Plenus and Radigrad and his daughter Prechvala\" who married the king , dated from the context to after [969], although this date is inconsistent with the chronology of later generations of this family. This highlights the unreliability of this source and the uncertainty about the accuracy of all the information on the earlier generations. Predimir & his wife had four children:]\n\na) [CHLARIMIR (-killed in battle ----). The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that \"King Predimir\" & his wife had four sons \"Chlarimir Boleslav Dragislav Svevlad\" among whom he divided his territories . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that the seven sons of Leghec, son of Kresimir, killed the sons and grandsons of \"King Predimir\" except for \"a son of Boleslav named Sylvester\" .]\n\nb) [BOLESLAV (-killed in battle ----). The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that \"King Predimir\" & his wife had four sons \"Chlarimir Boleslav Dragislav Svevlad\" among whom he divided his territories . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that the seven sons of Leghec, son of Kresimir, killed the sons and grandsons of \"King Predimir\" except for \"a son of Boleslav named Sylvester\" . m CASTRECA, daughter of ---. The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that, after the massacre of his uncles, \"a son of Boleslav named Sylvester\" fled with \"his mother Castreca to Lausium which is now called Ragusium\" . Boleslav & his wife had one child:]\n\ni) [SYLVESTER . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that the seven sons of Leghec, son of Kresimir, killed the sons and grandsons of \"King Predimir\" except for \"a son of Boleslav named Sylvester\" who fled with \"his mother Castreca to Lausium which is now called Ragusium\" but was restored to rule after the seven sons had all died . m ---. The name of Sylvester's wife is not known. Sylvester & his wife had one child:]\n\n(a) [TUGEMIR . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja names \"Tugemir\" as son of \"Sylvester\" & his wife . m ---. The name of Tugemir's wife is not known. Tugemir & his wife had one child:]\n\n(1) [CHVALIMIR . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja names \"Chvalimir\" as son of \"Tugemir\" & his wife .]\n\n- see below.\n\nc) [DRAGISLAV (-killed in battle ----). The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that \"King Predimir\" & his wife had four sons \"Chlarimir Boleslav Dragislav Svevlad\" among whom he divided his territories . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that the seven sons of Leghec, son of Kresimir, killed the sons and grandsons of \"King Predimir\" except for \"a son of Boleslav named Sylvester\" .]\n\nd) [SVEVLAD (-killed in battle ----). The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that \"King Predimir\" & his wife had four sons \"Chlarimir Boleslav Dragislav Svevlad\" among whom he divided his territories . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that the seven sons of Leghec, son of Kresimir, killed the sons and grandsons of \"King Predimir\" except for \"a son of Boleslav named Sylvester\" .]\n\n[CHVALIMIR, son of TUGIMIR upan & his wife --- . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja names \"Chvalimir\" as son of \"Tugemir\" & his wife .\n\nm ---. The name of Chvalimir's wife is not known.\n\nChvalimir & his wife had three children:]\n\n1. [PETRISLAV (-before 998, bur Krajina St Maria). The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja names \"Petrislav Dragimir Miroslav\" as the three sons of \"Chvalimir\" & his wife, specifying that Petrislav ruled in the region of Zeta and in Podgorica after the death of his youngest brother Miroslav . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that \"Petrislav\" was buried in the church of \"St Maria Krajina\" . Knez of Duklja and [part] Trebinje after 971. m ---. The name of Petrislav's wife is not known. Petrislav & his wife had one child:]\n\na)IVAN VLADIMIR (-murdered Prespa 22 May 1016, bur Krajina St Maria) . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja names \"Vladimir\" as son of \"Petrislav\" . Knez of Duklja and [part] Trebinje, in Krajina. Ivan Vladimir entered an alliance with Emperor Basileios II, provoking Samuil Tsar of the Bulgarians into attacking Duklja in 997 . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that Vladimir was sent into exile \"to the territory of Ohrid which is called Prespa\" by Tsar Samuil, but married the Tsar's daughter and restored in \"the land of his patrimonial kingdom and the whole of the territory of Dyrrachium\" . Cedrenus records that \"Bladimeri [qui] gener fuit Samuil\" ruled \"Trymalia et viciniores Serviæ partes\" and that he was deceived through the machinations of \"Davidi Bulgarorum archiepiscopi\" and murdered . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that \"Vladimir\" was lured to Prespa by Ivan Vladislav Tsar of the Bulgarians and beheaded \"22 May\", his widow burying him at \"Krajina church of St Maria\", referring to him afterwards as \"St Vladimir\" . m ([998]) [KOSARA], daughter of SAMUIL Tsar of the Bulgarians & his wife Agatha Chryselie. Her parentage and marriage are confirmed by Cedrenus who records that \"Bladimeri [qui] gener fuit Samuil\" ruled \"Trymalia et viciniores Serviæ partes\" . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records the marriage of \"Vladimir\" and \"Cossara\", daughter of Samuil Tsar of the Bulgarians , but it is likely that this source confuses her with Samuil´s daughter Miroslava as it recounts a story similar to that of Ashot Taronites falling in love with Miroslava while held captive by her father. According to Europäische Stammtafeln , she was [Kosara] Chryselie, daughter of Theodoros Chryselios Archon of Durazzo & his wife --- Kometopulotissa, whose sister married Tsar Samuil, but the primary source on which this is based has not yet been identified. It is likely that the name \"Kosara\" is in any case a deformation of \"Chryselie\" and that the name of Ivan Vladimir´s wife is in fact unknown.\n\n2. [DRAGOMIR (-murdered Kotor 1018) . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja names \"Petrislav Dragimir Miroslav\" as the three sons of \"Chvalimir\" & his wife, specifying that Dragomir ruled Trebinje and Chelma . He succeeded his nephew as DRAGOMIR Knez of Duklja and Trebinje (part), as the vassal of Byzantium. He was murdered by local citizens in Kotor, after which Duklja was probably placed under direct Byzantine rule . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that \"Dragomir the uncle of St Vladimir\" tried to seize the country after his nephew was killed but was himself murdered in a church . m firstly ---. The name of Dragomir's first wife is not known. m secondly --- [of Serbia], daughter of LJUTOMIR [of Serbia]. The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja names Dragomir's wife as \"the daughter of Lutomir the veliki zupan of Rassa\", recording that she returned to her homeland with her two daughters after her husband was killed but, finding that her father had died, travelled to Bosna with her mother to join her uncles . Dragomir & his first wife had one child:]\n\na) [VOJISLAV (-Prapatna [1043], bur Prapatna, St Andrew) . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja names \"Voislav\" as son of Dragomir by his first wife, recording that he \"obtained the kingdom\" after his father was killed, fought the Greeks and obtained \"the land as far as Topliza\" . Europäische Stammtafeln conflates Vojislav and Dobroslav, who according to the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja were half-brothers.]\n\n- see below.\n\nDragomir & his [second] wife had three children:\n\nb) [daughter (-after 1018). The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that Dragomir's wife returned to her homeland with her two daughters after her husband was killed . same person as ? [TICHIASLAVA . She is shown as possible daughter of Dragomir, widow of Procul, and mother of Bella, in Europäische Stammtafeln , but the basis for this speculation is not known.] m PROCUL de Chasaliça [Cazasiza] Patriarch of Ragusa [Dubrovnik]. Tichiaslava & her husband had one child:]\n\ni) [BELLA . As noted above, Bella is shown in Europäische Stammtafeln as the daughter of Tichiaslava , but the primary source which confirms her parentage has not yet been identified. Nun.]\n\nc) [daughter (-after 1018). The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that Dragomir's wife returned to her homeland with her two daughters after her husband was killed .]\n\nd) [DOBROSLAV (posthumously 1018-). The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that Dragomir's wife gave birth to a son \"Dobroslav\" at \"Brusno\" while travelling to Bosnia, where he was brought up before being sent as an adolescent to \"Ragusium\" . Europäische Stammtafeln conflates Dobroslav and Vojislav, who according to the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja were half-brothers.]\n\n3. [MIROSLAV . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja names \"Petrislav Dragimir Miroslav\" as the three sons of \"Chvalimir\" & his wife, specifying that Miroslav ruled the territory of Podgorica and that he died in a storm while sailing through Balta .]\n\nVOJISLAV, son of [DRAGOMIR Knez of Duklja and part Trebinje & his [first] wife ---] (-[1043], bur Prapratna) . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja names \"Voislav\" as son of Dragomir and his first wife, recording that he \"obtained the kingdom\" after his father was killed, fought the Greeks and obtained \"the land as far as Topliza\" . Fine comments that the 12th century Chronicle is not an ideal source and could have invented such a relationship to provide continuity with the dynasty of Ivan Vladimir . Europäische Stammtafeln conflates Vojislav and Dobroslav, who according to the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja were half-brothers. Vojislav refused homage to Byzantium in [1034/36], was captured and sent to Constantinople, after which Duklja was administered by the strategos of Durazzo. Vojislav escaped from Byzantium and returned to Duklja, where he took refuge in the mountains with an ever-growing band of followers . He freed Duklja from Byzantine suzerainty, and established his capital at Shkodra (Scutari). After defeating Ljutovid Knez of Zahumlje and Trebinje, who led a Byzantine-inspired alliance which included Bosnia and Raka in 1042, Duklja annexed most of Zahumlje . Cedrenus records that \"princeps Serborum Stephanus qui et Boisthlabus\" was deposed, dated to [1040/42] from the context, and \"Theophilo Erotico\" installed to rule Serbia . Cedrenus records that \"Stephanus qui et Boisthlabus\" occupied \"Illyricos montes\" and defeated \"Michaele patricio Anastasii logothetæ filio, tum Dyrrachii præfecto\" who was sent by Emperor Konstantinos IX Monomachos, dated to after [1042] from the context . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that \"King Voislav\" reigned for 25 years, died in Prapatna, and was buried in the \"church of St Andrew\" . After his death, his territories were divided between his widow and his five sons.\n\nm ---, \"niece\" of SAMUIL Tsar of the Bulgarians, daughter of --- (-after [1055] ). The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that \"Voislav\" married \"the niece of emperor Samuel\" by whom he had five sons \"Goyslav, Michael, Saganec, Radoslav and Predimir\" . The word \"niece\", presumably translated from \"neptis\", could be interpreted either as niece or granddaughter. Europäische Stammtafeln, presumably on the basis that granddaughter is the appropriate translation, suggests that Vojislav's wife was --- of the Bulgarians, daughter of Gavriil Radomir Tsar of the Bulgarians & his second wife Irina ---. If this is correct, Vojislav's wife must have been born in [990/1000], which would place the birth of the couple's sons in [1015/25]. If \"niece\" is the correct translation, Vojislav's wife could have been the niece either of Tsar Samuil himself or of his wife. The latter possibility could account for the confusion relating to the wife of Vojislav's first cousin Ivan Vladimir, stated by Europäische Stammtafeln to be the niece of Tsar Samuil's wife (see above), assuming that there was also confusion in the primary sources between Ivan Vladimir and his cousin Vojislav. In this second case, the birth of the couple's sons could be placed much earlier. The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that \"the queen ruled the kingdom with her first born son Gojislav\" after the death of her husband, in a later passage recording her death after which her son Mihailo \"received the kingdom\" , which dates the event to after the death in battle of her eldest son Gojislav.\n\nVojislav & his wife had five children:\n\n1.GOJISLAV (before 1025-killed in battle [1054/55]). The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that \"Voislav\" married \"the niece of emperor Samuel\" by whom he had five sons (in order) \"Goyslav, Michael, Saganec, Radoslav and Predimir\", recording that \"Goyslav and Predimir his youngest brother received Tribunia and Grispuli\" on the death of their father . The Chronicle records that \"the queen ruled the kingdom with her first born son Gojislav\" after the death of her husband, but that Gojislav and his brother Predimir were murdered by \"men from Tribunia called Scrobiniesi [who] set up their leader Domanech as ruler\" .\n\n2.MIHAILO (before 1025-[1081/82], bur Monastery of St Sergius & St Bacchus) . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that \"Voislav\" married \"the niece of emperor Samuel\" by whom he had five sons (in order) \"Goyslav, Michael, Saganec, Radoslav and Predimir\", recording that Mihailo received \"Oblik, Prapatna and Cermeniza\" on the death of their father . Mihailo succeeded in [1046] as Knez of Duklja. Cedrenus records that \"Michaelas Stephani filius\" succeeded his father in \"Triballorum ac Serborum principatum\" and agreed a treaty with Emperor Konstantinos X Monomachos who awarded him \"protospathiariique honore\", dated to [1050] . After the death of his brother Gojislav in Trebinje, Mihailo defeated the rebel leader Domanek and installed his brother Saganek as Knez of Trebinje [1052/54] . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records the rebellion of \"men from Tribunia called Scrobiniesi [who] murdered Gojislav and his brother Predimir and set up their leader Domanech as ruler\", that the brothers \"Michael, Saganic and Radoslav\" marched on Trebinje, and that Radoslav killed Domanech and captured the \"region of Chelmena\" . The Chronicle records that, after the death of the queen, her son Mihailo \"received the kingdom\" , which dates the event to after the death in battle of his older brother Gojislav. He declared himself MIHAILO King of Duklja. Skylitzes names \"Bulgariæ princeps Michaelem\" and \"suo filio Constantino, cui Bodino cognomen erat\", dated to [1073/75] . He sought an alliance with the Papacy aiming to establish a separate archbishopric in Duklja, and received a crown from the Pope in 1077 . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that King Mihailo died after reigning for 35 years and that he was buried in the monastery of \"the Martyrs Saints Sergius and Bacchus\" . m firstly ---. The name and origin of Mihailo's first wife are not known. m secondly (after [1056]) ---, a Greek. The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records Mihailo's second marriage (after his accession) to \"a Greek woman a relative of the emperor\" and names \"Dobroslav, Petrislav, Nicephorus, Theodorus\" as their four sons . Fine says that Byzantine sources do not mention Mihailo's second marriage, but comments that Emperor Konstantinos IX Monomachos (died 1055) ruled Byzantium at the time and suggests that he was the emperor to whom Mihailo's second wife was related . However, the phrase \"relative of the emperor\" may have been used to indicate that the king's new bride was from a Byzantine noble family, many of whom were distantly related to one or other of the emperors (see BYZANTINE NOBILITY). Fine also says that Mihailo's eldest son by his second marriage was about 25 years old when he succeeded as king of Duklja . If this is correct, it would indicate that the marriage took place much later than 1055. King Mihailo & his first wife had eight children:\n\na)VLADIMIR (-killed in battle before [1081/82]). The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja names (in order) \"Vladimir, Priaslav, Sergius, Deria, Gabriel, Miroslav and Bodin\" as the seven sons of Mihailo and records that Mihailo took the zupania of Zeta from his brother Radoslav and gave it to his son Vladimir after succeeding as king . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that \"Bodin who [afterwards] ruled the whole kingdom [and] Vladimir with their brothers marched into Rassa and annexed it\" . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that all of Bodin's brothers died in battle during the lifetime of their father . m ---. The name of Vladimir's wife is not known. Vladimir & his wife had one child:\n\ni)VLADIMIR (-Skadar [1114]) . The primary source which confirms his parentage has not yet been identified. He was elected to succeed his cousin Kočapar as VLADIMIR King of Duklja. He was poisoned by Queen Jakvinta. m --- of Raka, daughter of VUKAN Grand upan of Raka [Serbia] & his wife ---. The primary source which confirms her parentage and marriage has not yet been identified. This marriage was arranged to seal a peace treaty between Duklja and Serbia . King Vladimir & his wife had one child:\n\n(a)MIHAILO . The primary source which confirms his parentage has not yet been identified. He was accused of plotting with the Byzantines, imprisoned by Djordje King of Duklja and blinded on his orders in [1131] .\n\nb)PRIASLAV (-killed in battle before [1081/82]). The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja names (in order) \"Vladimir, Priaslav, Sergius, Deria, Gabriel, Miroslav and Bodin\" as the seven sons of Mihailo . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that all of Bodin's brothers died in battle during the lifetime of their father .\n\nc)SERGIUS (-killed in battle before [1081/82]). The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja names (in order) \"Vladimir, Priaslav, Sergius, Deria, Gabriel, Miroslav and Bodin\" as the seven sons of Mihailo . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that all of Bodin's brothers died in battle during the lifetime of their father .\n\nd)DERIA (-killed in battle before [1081/82]). The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja names (in order) \"Vladimir, Priaslav, Sergius, Deria, Gabriel, Miroslav and Bodin\" as the seven sons of Mihailo . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that all of Bodin's brothers died in battle during the lifetime of their father .\n\ne)GABRIEL (-killed in battle before [1081/82]). The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja names (in order) \"Vladimir, Priaslav, Sergius, Deria, Gabriel, Miroslav and Bodin\" as the seven sons of Mihailo . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that all of Bodin's brothers died in battle during the lifetime of their father .\n\nf)MIROSLAV (-killed in battle before [1081/82]). The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja names (in order) \"Vladimir, Priaslav, Sergius, Deria, Gabriel, Miroslav and Bodin\" as the seven sons of Mihailo . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that all of Bodin's brothers died in battle during the lifetime of their father .\n\ng)BODIN (-[1101/08]) . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja names (in order) \"Vladimir, Priaslav, Sergius, Deria, Gabriel, Miroslav and Bodin\" as the seven sons of Mihailo . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that \"Bodin who [afterwards] ruled the whole kingdom [and] Vladimir with their brothers marched into Rassa and annexed it\" and \"captured the whole of Bulgaria which King Michael gave to his son Bodin to rule as a province\" . In 1072, his father sent him to lead troops to join the rebellion of George Vojteh against the Byzantines in Macedonia. On his way, he was crowned PETAR Tsar of the Bulgarians at Prizren in late 1072. Skylitzes names \"Bulgariæ princeps Michaelem\" and \"suo filio Constantino, cui Bodino cognomen erat\", dated to [1073/75] . The rebellion was crushed by Byzantium, Bodin was defeated south of Skopje, captured and banished to Asia Minor where he remained until ransomed in [1078] . The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja records that Bodin declared himself emperor which triggered an invasion from Byzantium, during which Bodin was captured and sent to Antioch in exile . He succeeded his father in [1081/82] as KONSTANTIN BODIN King of Duklja. He helped in the Byzantine defence of Durazzo against the attack by the Normans in 1081, although his last minute neutrality contributed to the Normans' successful conquest of the town . The Alexeiad records that \"Monomachatos won the friendship of Bodin and Michaelas exarchs of Dalmatia\" in the war against Robert \"Guiscard\" Duke of Apulia . He recaptured Raka, presumably after a revolt following the death of his father . Konstantin's support for Pope Urban II against anti-Pope Clement III in 1089 was rewarded by the bishopric of Bar being raised to the status of an archbishopric, with an area of jurisdiction which included Serbia, Bosnia and Trebinje . During a major Byzantine offensive against Duklja in [1089/91], Konstantin was taken prisoner. Civil war broke out, Raka, Bosnia and Zahumlje seceding from Dukljan control . Orderic Vitalis records that the \"Serbian prince Bodin\" received the crusading armies of Adhemar Bishop of Le Puy and Raymond de Toulouse after passing \"through Dalmatia\" on their journey eastwards in [1096/97] . \"Bodino rege\" donated the church of St Martin de Zonchetto to the monastery of St Benedict by charter dated 1100 . m (Apr 1081 ) JACINTA Argyre, daughter of --- (-Constantinople after 1115). The primary source which confirms her origin and marriage has not yet been identified. She was the daughter of the leader of the pro-Norman party in Bari, Apulia . She ordered the capture of her husband's first cousin Branislav in [1093/95], anxious to safeguard the rights of her children over Branislav's family in case her husband died. Fine suggests that it is likely that these events took place during King Konstantin's imprisonment by the Byzantines . She poisoned Vladimir King of Duklja in [1114], and installed her son Djordje as king in his place. \"Georgius rex cum matre mea domina Jaquinta regina et Gerdo consobrino meo\" confirmed donations to the church of St Martin made by \"patres nostri\" by charter dated Aug 1115 . When King Djordje was deposed in [1118], Jakvinta was arrested and sent to Constantinople where she died . King Konstantin Bodin & his wife had five childen (the primary sources which confirm their parentage have not yet been identified):\n\ni)MIHAILO .\n\nii)DJORDJE (-Constantinople 1131). He succeeded in [1114] as DJORDJE King of Duklja.
