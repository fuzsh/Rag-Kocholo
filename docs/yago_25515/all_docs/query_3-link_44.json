        "text": "On 8 January 1873 Elena of Montenegro was born. To celebrate the 150th anniversary of the second queen of Italy, Golden Rose of Christianity, the Coordinamento Sabaudo is organising at the Palazzina di Caccia of Stupinigi the first exhibition dedicated to the queen who faced both world wars alongside her husband Vittorio Emanuele.\n\nFrom 4 March to 30 April 2023, all the pieces from private collections, normally not visible to the public, will be on display: photographs, books, a collection of postcards from 1896 to 1920, vintage glasses, plates, cutlery, calendars with images of the king and queen, war and photo albums, historical cameras, heraldic wedding prints and the series of three paintings depicting Queen Elena made using three different techniques to depict the art of the past with the cyanotype technique.\n\nThe fifth daughter of the 12 children of the founder of the Kingdom of Montenegro, Nikita I Mirko Petrović-Njegoš, and Milena Vukotić, Queen Consort, Elena was intelligent and headstrong, spoke fluent French, Russian, Serbian and modern Greek, and wrote poetry under the pseudonym ‘Blue Butterfly’.\n\nAfter meeting Prince Vittorio Emanuele at La Fenice theatre in Venice, and following a second meeting at the coronation of Tsar Nicholas II, the engagement was formalised in Montenegro. The wedding was celebrated on 24 October 1896 in Rome, in civil form at the Quirinale and in religious form at the Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli. Elena, originally of the Orthodox faith, converted to Catholicism.\n\nPassionate about hunting and photography, she also applied herself to medical studies, which earned her an honorary degree. She financed several studies for polio, Parkinson’s disease, cancer and childhood encephalitis. On 7 March 1937, she was awarded the ‘Golden Rose of Christianity’ by Pope Pius XI.\n\nElena became queen in 1900 following the regicide of her father-in-law and, during her reign, had to face both world wars alongside her husband. In an attempt to avoid a second conflict, on 27 November 1939 she proposed the ‘Peace of Ladies‘ to the six queens of the still neutral countries.\n\nOn 9 May 1946, following the abdication of Vittorio Emanuele III, the consorts went into exile in Alexandria, Egypt, where they were hosted by King Faruk. There Vittorio Emanuele died on 28 December 1947, and was provisionally buried in the church of Santa Caterina. Elena, discovered to be suffering from cancer, moved to Montpellier in 1949 and died there on 28 November 1952.\n\nI would say that I could not have found a better occasion to return to Piedmont and visit the Palazzina di Caccia of Stupinigi!\n\nAdmission to the exhibition is included in the ticket price.
