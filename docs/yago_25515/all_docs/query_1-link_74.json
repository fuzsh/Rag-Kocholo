        "text": "The first Blue Flag in 2018 was raised today by the State Secretary from the Ministry of Sustainable Development and Tourism, Damir Davidovic, on the Kamenovo beach in Budva, which is a long-time recipient of this prestigious ecological acknowledgment.\n\nThe Legend of Tre Sorele is a story about three sisters who gave all the love of this world to one man, never living a day of love for whom they have devoted their whole life. Tre Sorele is also the best preserved Gothic-style palace in Boka Bay.\n\nJune 06, 2018 - The meeting in Ohrid is devoted to the common and similar policies and challenges of Macedonia and Montenegro when it comes to applying the Decision of the UNESCO Committee related to Ohrid and Kotor.\n\nJune 6, 2018 - For years, Montenegro has been reputed as a country for relaxation. Sunbathing at the remote beaches, hiking between wild pomegranate thickets or solitary meditating at our stunning mountain lakes â€“ that is no longer the only way to spend your holidays here. The many entertainment activities, especially in the high season, have rapidly grown over the last years, and TMN is here to guide you through the vibrant summer in Montenegro.\n\nAfter 14 independent productions, the Tivat Culture Center also appears as a co-producer on the theater projects of significant artists, such as the \"Jami distrikt\" show, awarded with seven prizes at the most significant regional theatre competition - festival Sterijino pozorje finished two days ago in Novi Sad. As one of the most important regional theatre centers, Tivat can be proud that its Culture Center's productions and co-productions, although we are not talking about 'real theatre', played 83 times in Montenegro and abroad, which makes this small production center one of the most successful in the ex-Yu region. With its 19 awards so far, the Jami distrikt will be played twice within this year's edition of Purgatorije, launched with the title \"Summer Center - Purgatorije 2018\".\n\nThe grand concert of the Montenegrin Symphony Orchestra, under the conductor rod of maestro Grigory Krasko, will be held in Kotor on St. Tryphon's Day, Thursday, June 7th at 20.00 with the works of Bizet, Puccini, Rossini, Strauss, and others."
