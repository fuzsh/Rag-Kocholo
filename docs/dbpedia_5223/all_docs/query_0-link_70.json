According to an independent analysis by the Political Ec<strong>on</strong>omy Research Institute and the Center for American Progress, President Obama’s plan would create more than 1.7 milli<strong>on</strong> jobs. That’s because clean energy sources like wind and solar power create two to three times more jobs than old, dirty sources of energy like coal. Now is the time to put these soluti<strong>on</strong>s to work. Below is a petiti<strong>on</strong> signed by your c<strong>on</strong>stituents. The petiti<strong>on</strong> statement reads as follows: <str<strong>on</strong>g>With</str<strong>on</strong>g> so many still hurting, C<strong>on</strong>gress needs to act now and pass President Obama's clean energy jobs plan. We will gladly provide you with electr<strong>on</strong>ic data access to resp<strong>on</strong>d to signers at your request, and we thank you for your c<strong>on</strong>siderati<strong>on</strong>.
