He held 311 warrants, made out in the name of Lancaster County citizens, but assigned by them to him, and these warrants, each good for 250 acres of land or more, he caused to be located by his agent, James CUNNINGHAM, who was also the surveyor of what is known as CUNNINGHAMï¿½s District of the Depreciation Lands.* These warrants were located several years before Butler County was organized. The warrants for the tracts of land on which it was destined that a thriving village should arise, passed into the possession of John and Samuel J. CUNNINGHAM,** and land adjoining upon the north became by settlerï¿½s right the property of Robert Graham, who located in 1797 where the residence of Mr. DAUGHERTY now stands.\n\n*See Chapter III on Land Title and Survey.\n\n**The warrants for these tracts had been taken out in the names of John TRESSLER and Andrew REICHERT, and by them assigned to Morris. The patent to the TRESSLER tract was not received by Samuel J. CUNNINGHAM until May 13, 1805. It sets forth that it was granted on consideration of moneys paid by John TRESSLER into the Receiver Generalï¿½s office, at the granting of the warrant, and the sum of $158 paid by Samuel J. CUNNINGHAM, and also, in said Samuel J. CUNNINGHAM having made it appear that he made or caused to be made, an actual settlement, and continued residence agreeable to Section 9, of the law of 1792, on a tract of land called ï¿½Butlerï¿½.\n\nWhen Butler County was erected by act of March 12, 1800, it was provided that the place for holding courts should be fixed at any place distant not more than four miles from the center of the county. The CUNNINGHAMs doubtless were aware a considerable time previous to March 12, 1800, where the boundaries of the county would be established, and anticipated as a matter of course that the seat of justice would be located approximately in the center of the county. They owned the most available site for a town within the prescribed radius of four miles from the geographical center, and profited by their shrewdness or good fortune in having secured it.\n\nOther locations were proposed, and their owners urged their real or imagined advantages upon the com- [p.147]missioners appointed to examine them. One of the Commissioners, under date of June 7, 1802, writes of the lands proposed by the CUNNINGHAMs for a county seat as follows: ï¿½The situation is beautiful, being on an eminence, which descend in all directions; the land scarce of timber, but sufficiently dry, and large bodies of meadow ground near the seat. This site will have the advantages of the creek, with sundry good springs of water and coal banks near, limestone and freestone quarries partly adjoining the site. The ridges all pointing into the little valley, will be convenient for roads from every direction.ï¿½\n\nOne commissioner at least was favorably impressed. The impression which was made by the dayï¿½s observation was doubtless strengthened by an eveningï¿½s conversation. The commissioner from whose diary we have quoted, writes further: ï¿½We parted that evening, Messrs. WEAVER, HAMILTON and LANE lodging at the mill house, Mr. Morton and myself returning with Mr. Robert CUNNINGHAM to the Salt Lick place, where that young man keeps bachelorï¿½s hall in a nice cabin building.ï¿½ All of the commissioners were that night the guests of the CUNNINGHAMs, the mill house where three of them lodged being the home of some of the members of the family, probably of John and Samuel, by whom the mill itself had been built about two years previous. The CUNNINGHAMs and Robert GRAHAM proposed to lay out in town lots 300 acres of land, five acres of which should be devoted to the use of the county of Butler should their location be made the seat of justice. That they gained the object of their desire was first made known to the general public when the Legislature, upon the 8th of March, 1803, passed an act, of which the following are the important sections:\n\nSection 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, in General Assembly met and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the same, that John MCBRIDE, Esq., William ELLIOTT, Esq., and John DAVID, be and hereby are appointed Trustees for the county of Butler, and the said Trustees, or a majority of them, are hereby authorized and required to survey, or cause to be surveyed, 300 acres of land situate on the north side of Connoquenessing Creek, near Samuel CUNNINGHAMï¿½s mill, agreeably to a description given of the situation and boundary thereof expressed in the grant and obligation of Samuel CUNNINGHAM, John CUNNINGHAM and Robert GRAHAM, made by them to the Governor for the use of the county of Butler, and the said Trustees are hereby authorized and required to lay out a convenient lot or lots of land within the said 300 acres not exceeding five acres, whereon the public buildings shall be erected for the use of the county of Butler, and the surplus or residue of said 300 acres of land, which shall remain after the sites for the public buildings are set apart and determined, shall be laid out for a town, with suitable town lots, at the discretion of the Trustees, with necessary reservations for a quarry, streets, lanes, alleys and roads or highways; provided, however, that no outlots shall exceed five acres, and the town hereby directed to be laid out shall be called Butler.\n\nSection 2. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that it shall be the duty of the said Trustees, or a majority of them, to sell by public auction the said town lots and outlots at such times as they may judge most advantageous to the county, which sale shall be held at the said CUNNINGHAM Mill, in the said county, previous to which the said Trustees shall advertise the same three times at least in one or more newspapers published in Pittsburgh, Greensburg, and Washington one month before the day appointed for such sale; provided, that before the said commissioners proceed to the discharge of the duties herein enjoined and required, they shall demand and receive from the aforesaid Samuel CUNNINGHAM, John CUNNINGHAM and Robert GRAHAM sufficient deeds in fee simple of the above described 300 acres of land in trust for the use of the said county of Butler, agreeably to the grant thereof heretofore made to the Governor for the use of the county of Butler by the said Samuel CUNNINGHAM, John CUNNINGHAM and Robert GRAHAM, and shall procure the same to be recorded in the office for recording of deeds in Allegheny County, and when the said Trustees shall have so done they shall have authority, and it shall be their duty, to make out and grant sufficient deeds in fee-simple for the town and outlots by them sold in pursuance of this act.\n\nIn August, 1803, the village was duly laid out, the plat containing seventy-six acres and seventy-nine perches. This was deeded to William ELLIOTT, John DAVID and John MCBRIDE, as Trustees for the county, and the sales of the lots were made through them at a public auction. David DOUGAL purchased Lot No. 1, on the northwest corner of Main street and the Diamond, paying for it the sum of $100, which was the highest price paid for any lot in the village. Others sold for prices ranging from $90 down to $10.\n\nAs the town was to be the seat of justice, people were sanguine in their expectations of business. The lots were readily sold, and the pioneer villagers entered upon the humble beginnings of what were to be as a rule successful careers. There was promise of prosperity for almost every one, except John CUNNINGHAM, one of the founders of the town. His financial affairs became involved,* and he was doubtless hurried to the grave by the disappointments he met with. He died in 1805, and was buried in the little plat of ground which he and his brother had set apart for a cemetery. Now no man knows his grave.\n\n*John CUNNINGHAM was in all probability extensively engaged in business elsewhere than in the embryo village of Butler. His share in the 300 acres set apart for the town was 70 acres. When he became financially embarrassed, soon after the town was laid out, judgments were laid upon his property by creditors living in Philadelphia, and it became necessary, in order to give perfect title, to have a deed of release for the property included in the town site. Such a deed was made. It recites that the release was granted in consideration of the fact that John CUNNINGHAM had other lands adjoining the town, which were bounded by judgments, which his creditors had obtained, and that those lands were so materially increased in value by the location of the county seat, as to make them ample security.\n\nThis deed of release was executed in favor of John CUNNINGHAM by his creditors, Simon GRATZ and Heyman GRATZ, trading under the firm name of SIMON & Heyman GRATZ; William WISTAR, John PRICE and John WISTAR, trading under the name of WISTAR, Price & WISTAR; John WISTAR, in his private right; Joseph KARRICK and Joshua PERCIVAL, trading under the name of KARRICK & PERCIVAL, and Thomas RYERSON, all of [p. 148]Philadelphia, and is the first recorded instrument in the Recorderï¿½s office in Butler. The deed was executed in Philadelphia on the 5th of October, 1803, and recorded on the 23rd of January, 1804.\n\nA number of the men who bought lots immediately begun erecting log cabins upon them. To James THOMPSON, a sturdy blacksmith, belongs the credit of building the first, located near the Diamond; William YOUNG built the second, William NEYMAN the third, Abraham BRINKER the fourth and Jacob FUNK the fifth, on the lot now occupied by Jacob ZEIGLER. Other houses, all of very primitive character, were built soon after by John EMFREY, George POWERS, Stephen CRAWFORD and John POTTS. The latter built originally where Dr. LINNï¿½sï¿½ drug store now is, but two or three years later erected a substantial hewed log house upon the opposite side of the street, which is still doing service as a dwelling, although the logs are hidden by a facing of boards. This house, the oldest in town, adjoins the store of H. C. HEINEMAN, and is owned by him.\n\nThe men named in the foregoing lines were the first settlers within the original limits of Butler. John NEGLEY had settled in 1800 south of the creek, opposite the CUNNINGHAM mill (now the WALTER Mill), the CUNNINGHAMs had lived in the vicinity since 1797 and so also had Robert GRAHAM and family. His was probably the first family which had a residence within the present borough limits, but his house was outside of the original plat. Robert GRAHAMï¿½s son William, who made his advent in November or December, 1803, was the first child born. The first female child was Sarah, daughter of John and Jane POTTS, who was born in March, 1805. She is still living in Butler, the widow of Squire Robert CARNAHAN.\n\nThe winter of 1803-4 was a dreary one. The only means of communication with the outer world was by means of a bridle path leading straight over the hills to Pittsburgh. Henry M. BRACKENRIDGE, son of Judge H. H. BRACKENRIDGE, of Pittsburgh, was appointed clerk to William Ayres, Esq., the first Prothonotary of Butler County, and passed the winter in the new outpost of civilization. In his ï¿½Recollections of the Westï¿½ he says: ï¿½On my arrival at Butler there were a few log houses just raised, but not sufficiently completed to be occupied. It was not long before there were two taverns, a store and a blacksmith shop; it was then a town. The country around was a howling wilderness, with the exception of a few scattered settlements, as far removed from each other as the kraals in the neighborhood of the Cape of Good Hope.ï¿½\n\nIn the spring of 1804, the population was increased, improvements were made, public business commenced and some of the institutions of civilized life were established. The first session of the court was held in February,* and soon afterward a school was organized and a series of religious meetings inaugurated. At the February term, licenses were issued to William AYRES and James THOMPSON permitting them to keep taverns, and in May four others - John MOSER, Robert GRAHAM, George BOWERS and William BROWN were added to the list of backwoods bonifaces. The first merchant was, in all probability, John POTTS, who continued in business until his death in 1838, except when representing his constituents in the General Assembly; closely following POTTS in opening stores in the new village were David DOUGAL, William PURVIANCE, Samuel HILL and Walter LOWRIE.\n\n*See Chapter VII. Civil History.\n\nIn the summer of 1804, occurred the first social and festive assemblage of the people. The occasion was the celebration of the 4th of July. It was held at the Federal spring, near the Connoquenessing. ï¿½A long table, say 100 feet, well supplied with the best the country afforded, accommodated the eating and drinking part of the occasion. After dinner, William AYRES was appointed President and John MCCANDLESS (then Sheriff) Vice President. Patriotic toasts, general and volunteer, suited to the occasion, were read by the President, at the head of the table, and repeated by the Vice President, at the foot. Then followed the drink, the huzzas and firing of musketry, and music of drum and fife playing, playing the old Revolutionary tunes of ï¿½Yankee Doodleï¿½ and ï¿½Hail Columbia.ï¿½ï¿½*\n\n*Centennial address by Gen. John M. PURVIANCE.\n\nIt is related that on this occasion one of the toasts caused much amusement. Mr. AYRES proposed a ï¿½healthï¿½ to Thomas MCKEAN, coupling with his name the sentiment ï¿½energy and wisdom.ï¿½ MCCANDLESS, who was a little deaf, and possibly of the opposite political party, rose at the foot of the table and in a sonorous voice announced ï¿½Thomas MCKEAN-injured by whisky,ï¿½ and so the toast was drunk.\n\nPassing down the years, we find that in 1828, just a quarter century from the time Butler was settled, many material improvements had been made. The population had largely increased, and numbered between four and five hundred. The borough had been incorporated. About five years prior to the time of which we write, the citizens had begun to build brick dwellings, and there were now twenty-one in the town. The whole number of dwellings was about seventy. There were two newspapers printed here at that time; two physicians attended to the needs of the sick; seven resident lawyers practiced in the court; seven taverns were open for the entertainment of the way-farer and the stranger, and fourteen stores displayed varieties of merchandise to the people, which they [p. 149] could obtain in exchange for bear skins, deer skins, cranberries, honey, beeswax or cash. The principal merchants at this period were John GILCHRIST, John DUFFY, Samuel JOHNSON, William HAGGERTY, Adam FUNK, Maurice and John BREDIN, Clark MCPHERRIN, A. and J. BRINKER, John SULLIVAN and Walter LOWRIE.\n\nAt the end of the first quarter century the number of taxable inhabitants was ninety-seven, and their names as follows: William AYRES, David ALBRIGHT, Maurice BREDIN, John BREDIN, Jacob BRINKER, William BEATTY, Abraham BRINKER, William BRION, Joseph BRAND, Joseph BEATMENT, Robert Elliott BROWN, Daniel CATNEY, O.

Washington SMITH, Joseph STERRAT, Lewis TUCKER, James THOMPSON, John THOMPSON, John WELSH, George WOLFE.\n\nPrior to the close of the first twenty-five years of Butlerï¿½s existence, two notable events had occurred-- the visit of Gen. LAFAYETTE in 1824, and the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of American independence, in 1826.\n\nLAFAYETTEï¿½S VISIT TO BUTLER\n\nAn account of the memorable incident in the history of Butler we copy from the columns of the Sentinel of June 4, 1825: ï¿½On Wednesday last June 1, Gen. LAFAYETTE, on his way from Pittsburgh to Erie, passed through this borough. On the evening preceding, a meeting of the citizens was held at the court house, and preparations made for receiving and accommodating him in a suitable and respectable manner. A committee of six was appointed, of whom two were to go out and meet him and escort him into town; two to prepare the necessary accommodations for his entertainment while here, and two to accompany him as far as Mercer. On Wednesday morning, two triumphal arches were erected, one at each end of the town, decorated with laurel and other evergreens, and on the summits of which were hoisted the American flags. From the center of each arch was suspended a tablet with ï¿½Welcome LAFAYETTEï¿½ in large and legible letters, and encircled with wreaths of flowers and roses. When it was ascertained that the General was near, the citizens of the borough, with a numerous concourse of people from the surrounding vicinity, who had been assembled to get a sight of the Nationï¿½s guest, formed in regular order and marched to the southern extremity of the town; there arranging themselves in single file on each side of the road, they awaited his approach, and saluted him as he passed, after which they turned in and marched in regular procession after the carriage up the main street to the public square, where the General alighted at Mr. MECHLINGï¿½s inn, where a sumptuous entertainment was prepared for his accommodation. After dinner, he walked out among the people, and was introduced to all indiscriminately, who requested that honor.\n\nï¿½The General appeared highly pleased during the short time he remained, and being introduced to some old Revolutionary soldiers who had shared the toils and perils of the Brandywine battle with him, it is said that he distinctly recollected their features, and conversed familiarly upon subjects that transpired at that battle. On taking his leave, he bid them an affectionate adieu, and exclaimed, ï¿½Farewell, my friends; this is the last time you will see me.ï¿½ He stayed but a short time, but it is presumed that during his stay he shook hands with not less than 400 people. About four oï¿½clock he departed, carrying with him the good wishes of the multitude, and was escorted by the committee of arrangements. He arrived at Mercer about 1 oï¿½clock next morning.\n\nFIFTIETH CELEBRATION OF THE 4TH OF JULY---1826\n\nThe fiftieth anniversary of American independence(1826) was celebrated with unusual splendor and enthusiasm in Butler and several other boroughs in the county.\n\nThe principal orator of the day at the Butler celebration were John BREDIN, Esq., and S. A. GILMORE.\n\nThe Butler Light Infantry, commanded by Capt. R. LEMMON, after giving an exhibition parade, together with a number of citizens, partook of a dinner at Daniel COLLï¿½s. Moses SULLIVAN, Esq., was appointed President of the Day and John GILMORE Vice President.\n\n[p. 150]\n\nThe cloth being removed, the Declaration of Independence was read by Dr. H. C. DE WOLF, following which John BREDIN, Esq., delivered an oration. After the regular programme of toasts had been drunk (including WASHINGTON, FRANKLIN and GREENE, the grand Pennsylvania Canal, the President of the United States, the Governor of Pennsylvania, the Greeks, the South American and Mexican Republics and Gen. BOLIVAR), volunteer toasts were offered by Mr. John WELSH, Mr. James LAPPIN, of Pittsburgh, Mr. Robert CRISWELL, John GILCHRIST, Esq., Mr. Henry MCGEE, by Mr. P. MCKENNA, of Pittsburgh, Mr. John GILLILAND, Maurice BREDIN, Esq., A. S. T. MOUNTAIN, Esq., Dr. DE WOLF, Mr. William STEWART, Mr. Joseph STERRETT, Mr. John REED and others.\n\nThe rifle company commanded by Capt. William BEATTY had a similar dinner and celebration, after parade, at Mr. NEYMANï¿½s tavern, Capt. BEATTY acting as President and Dr. George LINN as Vice President. The Declaration of Independence was read by Mr. S. C. GILMORE, who also delivered an oration. Among those present were Maj. William GIBSON, Eli SKERR, John DUFFY, Matthew HANNAH, John ALEXANDER, Robert W. STEWART, George MECHLING, Campbell E. PURVIANCE, David SCOTT, Samuel MCCULLOUGH, Hugh L. WEST, Charles MCGINNIS, James POTTS, Alexander W. GALBRAITH, Christian MECHLING, Samuel WILLIAMS.*\n\n*Fifty years later, July 4 1876, the Centennial Anniversary of Independence was very differently celebrated in Butler. So recent an event, it is not necessary to dwell upon at length; but, for the benefit of posterity, we will say that the day was fittingly observed, as it was in almost every town and hamlet in the land, in conformity with a wise suggestion of President Grant, urging that upon that day the history of all localities should be reviewed by essayists or orators fitted for that duty. In Butler, Gen. John N. P PURVIANCE was the orator of the day, and he delivered an address which was a brief, accurate and eloquent resume of the history of the county. The meeting was held in the court house in the afternoon, and was presided over by J.G. CAMPBELL. Rev. William WHITE opened the exercises with prayer; Jacob ZEIGLER read the Declaration of Independence, and Gen. PURVIANCE then delivered his address. A poem was read by Leander WISE, and the benediction pronounced by Rev. MCILYAR. An outside greeted by the firing of cannon, and the evening closed with fireworks, and an illumination of the town.\n\nGROWTH OF THE TOWN\n\nBefore passing to the corporate history of the borough and the detailed accounts of its religious and educational institutions, its business and manufacturing interests, it may not be amiss to make a brief statement of its growth. In 1830, the borough had but 580 population. This was increased to 861 in 1840; to 1,148, in 1850; to 1,399, in 1860; to 1,935, in 1870, and to 3,163 in 1880. It will be noted that the growth was quite slow and even until 1870, when it became known that the Butler Branch Railroad was to be built, the population increased more rapidly, and business interests were materially enhanced. The completion of that road, in 1871, was the most important event in the recent history of Butler, and as such --as the habringer of increased prosperity--was enthusiastically celebrated.* The oil development in the northeastern part of the county, which, in 1872 and 1873, was pushed toward Butler as far as Greece City, and Millerstown also had a tendency to enliven the town and swell the number of its people. Many substantial buildings were erected, both business blocks and dwellings, and as the town developed new needs, they were met by men of enterprise. Thus the gas works were established, chiefly through Mr. John A. GOETZ, and the water works through a company, of which J. L. PURVIS, Charles DUFFY and H. C. HEINEMAN were the principal officers.\n\n*See Chapter VI on Internal Improvements.\n\nCORPORATE HISTORY\n\nButler was incorporated as a borough* by an act entitled, ï¿½An act to erect the town of Milton, in the county of Northumberland and the town of Butler, in the county of Butler, into boroughs,ï¿½ which was read February 6, 1817, and passed February 26. The charter was issued May 2, 1817, by Gov. Simon SNYDER, and signed by Nathaniel B. BOILEAU, Secretary.\n\n*The borough was re-incorporated under act of April 3, 1851, by order of the Court of Quarter Sessions issued January 15, 1853.\n\nThe sections of the act relating to Butler are as follows:\n\nSection 16. An be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that the town of Butler, in the County of Butler, shall be and the same is hereby erected into a borough, which shall be called the ï¿½Borough of Butler,ï¿½ and contained within thï¿½ following metes and bounds: The original plat or draft of the town of Butler, beginning at a black oak on the bank of the mill dam; thence north 78 degrees west 7 perches; thence south 52 degrees west 8 perches; thence south 11 degrees west 7 perches south, 3 degrees east 10 perches south, 36 degrees east 8 perches south 73 degrees west 11 perches north 10 degrees west 14 perches north, 10 degrees east 14 perches north 40 degrees west 12 perches west 16 perches south 59 degrees, west 23 perches; thence south 11 degrees west 13 perches south 25 degrees east 5 perches south 20 degrees west 14 perches; thence south 18 perches; thence south 52 degrees west 26 perches south 41 degrees west 6 perches south 61 degrees west 13 1/2 perches south 57 degrees west 7 1/2 perches to a hickory; thence leaving the dam north 77 degrees west 9 perches; thence 57 degrees west 59 perches to two hickories on the bank of the creek; thence north 15 degrees west 40 perches north 3 degrees west 152 perches and five-tenths; thence north 87 degrees east 173 perches, and thence south 3 degrees east 133 perches and two-tenths to the place of beginning.\n\nSection 17 of the act provided that the inhabitant of the borough entitled to vote for members of the General Assembly having resided in the borough at least six months preceding the election, should, ï¿½on the Friday immediately preceding the third Saturday of March next,\" have power to cast their votes between the hours of 1 and 5 in the afternoon, for one Chief Burgess, one assistant Burgess and seven citizens to be a Town Council; also one High Constable.\n\nThe first election of borough officers was held May 30, 1817, at the house of Adam Funk, but most of the subsequent elections for a long term of years were held in Jacob MECHLINGï¿½s.\n\n[p. 151]\n\nWe subjoin a list of the Burgesses and members of the Council from 1817 to 1882 inclusive, and a list of Justices of the Peace from 1840 to the present:\n\n1817 - Chief Burgess, William AYRES; Assistant Burgess, John GILMORE; Council, William CAMPBELL, Joshua POTTS, George MILLER, Hugh MCKEE, David DOUGAL, James STEPHENSON, Jacob MECHLING.\n\n1818 - Chief Burgess, William AYRES; Assistant Burgess, John GILMORE; Council, Peter PETERSON, John GILCHRIST, James STEVENSON, John EMPICH, William CAMPBELL, George MILLER.\n\n1819 - Chief Burgess, William AYRES; Assistant Burgess, John GILMORE; Council, Jacob MECHLING.

We find that the Council considered plans for fire protection February 19,1825, and appointed John POTTS, Jacob MECHLING, Maurice BREDIN, William BEATTY, Abraham MAXWELL and William HAGGERTY to obtain subscriptions for buying fire apparatus. At the same meeting, John GILMORE, John BREDIN and Robert SCOTT were appointed as a committee to draft a constitution for a fire company.\n\nA fire engine was bought by the Council from the Allegheny Fire Company in 1827, for $400. An engine house was built the following year.\n\nMANUFACTURING\n\nThe oldest manufacturing site in the borough limits is that of the WALTER Mill. Allusion has been made in this chapter to the grist-mill built by the CUNNINGHAMs in 1802. It stood where the WALTER Mill now does. The CUNNINGHAMs sold it in 1806 to John NEGLEY. Mr. NEGLEY carried on business here until 1833, building a new mill to take the place of the original primitive log structure, swept away by a flood and adding a woolen mill. Robert MCNAIR & Bros. were his successors. While they owned the mill, in 1842, it was destroyed by fire. They rebuilt the flouring mill, and it afterward became the property of William BEATTY, who leased or sold it to John MCCARNES. MCCARNES in turn sold it to Jacob WALTER, who sold to John C. GROHMAN, and he in turn transferred the property to Jacob BOOS, from whom the present owner, George WALTER, obtained it.\n\nJohn NEGLEY, mentioned as having bought the CUNNINGHAM Mill, in 1806, started a cabinet shop about the same time, which was the first cabinet ship in Butler.\n\nAnother early mechanical industry was the carding machine brought to the vicinity of the borough, in 1812, by John GILMORE.\n\nJulius KLINGLER began the milling business in 1867, establishing a small custom mill. this was carried on uninterruptedly and without material enlargement until 1880. In that year, Mr. KLINGLER expended about $15,000 in improvements, the result of [p.154]which is well known to his fellow citizens. He has now one of the finest flouring mills in the county, and produces by the gradual reduction, or roller-crushing process, known as the Hungarian patent, about 200 barrels of flour per day, for which a ready sale is found at the best prices, in various markets in Pennsylvania and Ohio.\n\nThe mill now owned by George REIBER was built by a Mr. MCCALL in 1842, transferred to the possession of CLYMER & MEYLERT soon after, and by them to Mr. REIBER in 1857. It is run by both steam and water power, and contains five ï¿½runs of stones,ï¿½ or sets of buhrs. The mill is occupied most of the time with custom work.\n\nThe largest mechanical industry is Butler is the PURVIS Planing Mill. This was started in 1864 by S. G. PURVIS, who carried it on until his death, in 1879, since which time the business has been conducted by his sons, J. L. and L. O. PURVIS, under the firm name of S. G. PURVIS & Co. Until 1879, the patronage of the mill was principally from the surrounding country, but since then the proprietors have been engaged extensively in the manufacture of sash, doors and blinds, which find a market in Pittsburgh and vicinity. The PURVIS Planing Mill employs about fifty men, and annually uses up about three million feet of lumber.\n\nThe oldest manufacturing enterprise carried on continuously by one man is the tannery owned by C. ROESSING, and established by him in 1832. The largest part of the leather which he turns out is used for the manufacture of harness and is disposed of in the home market as well as others.\n\nThe Union Woolen Mills, owned by H. FULLERTON, have been in operation since 1842. The building was erected by William John AYRES, who entertained the project of manufacturing broadcloth. The manufactory was successively owned by William P. MACKEY, John H. THOMPSON and Mrs. William P. MACKEY, and bought by Mr. FULLERTON in 1861. He has since carried it on and produced flannels, blankets and yarns. Formerly, he manufactured cassimeres, but of late years has given little attention to that branch of the business. The mill is in good condition, contains valuable machinery, and is run by steam power.\n\nThe foundry owned by J. G. & W. CAMPBELL was started by John MCCARNES about 1840, and bought by them in 1847. At this establishment stoves are manufactured and a line of miscellaneous castings produced. Another foundry was started soon after that of the Messrs. CAMPBELL by A. CARNES and James T. MCJUNKIN. In 1859, it was bought by M. REIBER, Sr., and Julius KLINGLER. In 1862, the firm became REIBER & WECKBECKER. Mr. RENO took an interest in 1866, and in the following year Mr. RETZERT became the fourth partner. In 1868, the firm became EYTH, WECKBECKER & RETZERT, and in 1870, EYTH, FULLER & RODGERS. Soon after the year last mentioned, business was suspended.\n\nG. C. ROESSING began cabinet-making in 1847, and in 1860 bought out the carriage shop of THOMPSON Bros., established by them in 1857. He has since carried on the business of carriage-making very successfully.\n\nJohn LAWALL began carriage-making in 1848, and carried on the business until his death, in 1877. Since that time the manufacture has been in the hands of his sons, who conduct it under the firm name of J. LAWALL & Bro. They have enlarged their facilities from time to time, and now do a large business.\n\nThe production of whisky was for a number of years quite an important industry. In 1857, a distillery was started on SULLIVANï¿½s Run, which was, in 1867, removed to George REIBERï¿½s flouring mill. This was the property of George, Jacob and Martin REIBER, and they conducted business under the firm name of Jacob REIBER & Co. The distillery was run about five years after the removal to REIBERï¿½s Mill. Another distillery was carried on from 1869 to 1878, near the depot. This was started by Jacob ZIMMERMAN and subsequently carried on by HARVEY & Co.\n\nThe establishment of the lass works of D. THOMSON & Son, in the autumn of 1882, has been an important addition to the manufacturing interests of Butler. The cost of the works was about $10,000, a portion of which amount was subscribed by a number of liberal and enterprising citizens.\n\nMERCANTILE BUSINESS\n\nThe early merchants and some of their successors have been mentioned in the beginning of this chapter. The oldest merchants now in business are J. G. and W. CAMPBELL, the successors of their father, William Campbell; Charles DUFFY, the successor of his father, Peter DUFFY, and Louis STEIN, who has been in business since 1840.\n\nThe following is a directory of the present business houses of Butler:\n\nDry good-Charles DUFFY, Louis STEIN & Son, REIBER & RALSTON, D.

(James CAMPBELL, Judge James BREDIN, S. M. LANE, Dr. Isaiah MCJUNKIN and A. N. MEYLART). Judge BREDIN was the managing banker, and Isaac J. CUMMINGS was the Clerk, or Cashier. In 1855, the business of the bank was turned over to Mr. CUMMINGS, and he carried it on from that time until the organization of the First National Bank, in 1864.\n\nThe articles of association of the First National Bank of Butler were formed January 27, 1864, under and in accordance with the act of February 25, 1863, :to provide a national currency secured by a pledge of the United States stocks, and to provide for the circulation and redemption thereof.ï¿½ The capital stock was fixed at $50,000. The original stockholders were James CAMPBELL, John BERG, H. J. KLINGLER, John M. THOMPSON, James BREDIN, John N. PURVIANCE, Lewis STEIN, Charles MCCANDLESS, Isaac J. CUMMINGS Thomas STEHLE, Jacob ZIEGLER, John PURVIANCE, Mary A. REED, Charles DUFFY, William CAMPBELL, Michael ZIMMERMAN, Ebenezer MCJUNKIN, R. C. MCABOY, John A.

Mr. CUMMINGS, the Cashier, was succeeded by Edwin LYON, who in turn gave place to John BERG, Jr., who was followed by Alexander MITCHELL. The bank was opened in the building now owned by Thomas STEHLE, and, in 1875, was removed to the handsome three-story building on the southwest corner of Main and Jefferson streets, built by the stockholders the year previous. The First National Bank failed July 18, 1879. Henry C. CULLOM was appointed Receiver, and served in that capacity about six months, being succeeded by John N., PURVIANCE, who received his appointment January 15, 1880.\n\nThe Butler Savings Bank came into existence in 1868, the articles of association being signed January 29, and the first election of officers taking place on February 3. Following is s list of the first stockholders: William CAMPBELL, Theodore HUSELTON, J. C. REDICK, W. O. BRECKINRIDGE, Milton HENRY, George REIBER, James A. NEGLEY, Eugene FERRERO, William DICK, J. B.

At a subsequent meeting, the following gentlemen were chosen as Directors: James BREDIN, William CAMPBELL, H. Julius KLINGER, William VOGELEY and John M. THOMPSON,. In July, 1871, a charter was obtained from the State, and the manner of conducting the bank under went some slight changes. Upon October 30, 1871, Judge BREDIN was succeeded as President by John M. THOMPSON. The resignation of the latter was a accepted, and William CAMPBELL, Sr., elected President, February 21, 1877. Mr. CAMPBELL was succeeded by J. W. IRWIN in January, 1880. The first Cashier, Mr. LYON, was succeeded by William CAMP- [p.156]BELL, Jr., February 6, 1871. The present officers are: President, J. W. IRWIN; Cashier, William CAMPBELL, Jr., and E. W. VOGELEY, Teller, the latter having occupied his position since 1875. Under these officers the Butler Savings Bank is popularly and prosperously conducted, doing a large general banking business.\n\nJohn BERG & Co. established their private banking business in 1870.\n\nPrivate banks were opened in Butler and Greece City in April, 1873, by a company of which J. W. IRWIN, Jacob STAMBAUGH and S. A. WOOD were the principal stockholders. Capt. J. E. RAY was Cashier of the Butler bank. The Greece City bank was soon merged with the Butler institution, and this in turn was closed, in 1875, by Mr. IRWIN, who bought into the Butler Savings Bank.\n\nPOST OFFICE\n\nFollowing is the succession of Butler Postmasters: William YOUNG, John POTTS, William GIBSON, Jacob MECHLING, Jr., John GILCHRIST, David A.

ROBINSON.\n\nRELIGIOUS HISTORY\n\nPresbyterian Church,-- The Presbyterian Church is the oldest organized religious society in Butler. It came into organic being in the year 1813, and comprised the congregations at THORNï¿½s Tent, Harmony, Salt Spring and portions of Muddy Creek. THORNï¿½s Tent was the first preaching place in this immediate neighborhood. The pioneer of Presbyterianism in Butler County was the Rev. John MCPHERRIN,* who settled here in 1805, having accepted calls from the congregations of Concord and Muddy Creek. The records are not clear in regard to this period of his pastoral labors. In 1806, he is reported as pastor of Concord, Muddy Creek and Harmony, and, in 1809, as pastor of Concord and Harmony. He was installed as pastor of the Butler Church by the Presbytery of Erie, April 7, 1813. This church was then connected with the church of Concord. Mr. MCPHERRIN remained as pastor of the united charge until the relation was severed by his death, which occurred on the 10th of February, 1822. His successor was Rev. John COULTER, who was ordained and installed September 10, 1823, and continued as pastor for nine or ten years. Rev. Loyal YOUNG** began his labors on the first Sunday of July, 1833, and was ordained and installed pastor by the Presbytery of Allegheny December 4 of the same year. His pastorate closed in April, 1868, and he was succeeded by Rev. (Prof.) W. I. BRUGH, who was installed November 2, 1869. He resigned his charge in April, 1871. Rev. C. H. MCCLELLAN was installed in January and resigned in June, 1878. Rev. W. T. WILEY was called in January, 1879, entered upon his labors the first Sunday in March, was installed on the 24th of June, 1879, and resigned on the 31st of December, 1881. His successor, the present pastor, Rev. W. E. OLLER, was called in the summer of 1882.\n\n*A biographical sketch of the Rev. John MCPHERRIN, the first Presbyterian preacher of Butler, appears elsewhere in this work. See index of names.\n\n**A biography of the Rev. Loyal YOUNG appears in this volume. The history of the church as here given is largely taken from the ï¿½Quarter-Century Sermonï¿½ delivered by Mr. YOUNG, January 2, 1859.\n\nThe first Ruling Elders, elected in 1813, were John NEYMAN, Alexander HAMILTON and Robert GRAHAM. Those subsequently elected have been James MCCURDY and Malachi RICHARDSON, in 1833; Robert THORN, William MCJUNKIN and Jonathan PLUMMER, in 1834; Hon. Walter LOWRIE, in 1836; David MCILVAIN and Thomas WALSH, in 1839; Henry M. BOYD and William CAMPBELL, Sr., in 1841; William MAXWELL, James MITCHELL and John CAMPBELL, in 1849; Dr. R. L. MCCURDY, Samuel MARTIN and Thomas H. BRACKEN in 1858; George A. BLACK, in 1875; W. D. BRANDON, J. C. REDICK, James D. ANDERSON and James STEVENSON, in 1877. The present Ruling Elders are William CAMPBELL, Sr., James MITCHELL, William S. BOYD, W. D. BRANDON, J. C. REDICK and James STEVENSON.\n\nThe first church edifice erected in Butler was that in which the Presbyterian congregation worshipped. It was a small stone building standing on the ground occupied by the present large and commodious brick structure, and was built in 1815. The first movement toward erecting the old stone church was made in 1814. A subscription paper was circulated and subscriptions received varying from $1 to $50. To insure the success of the enterprise, the Rev. John MCPHERRIN and twelve others entered into an obligation, December 12, 1814, agreeing ï¿½to pay an equal share of whatever might be lacking, to the Trustees of Butler congregation for building a meeting-house.: The names subscribed in addition to Rev. MCPHERRINï¿½s, were those of William NEYMAN, James MCCURDY, John NEYMAN, John GILMORE, Alexander HAMILTON, David MCJUNKIN, Robert THORN, William BEATTY, Robert SCOTT, Andrew SPEER, John MCQUISTION and James MARTIN. The first Trustees were John NEYMAN, John POTTS and William CAMPBELL. They selected the site for the building, and purchased just one-half of the present church lot from Alexander SCOTT for the small sum of $20. The stone church cost $1,500. John NEYMAN was the contractor.\n\nThe church was chartered in 1823. At that time the Trustees were Walter LOWRIE, John Leslie MAXWELL, John GILMORE, Robert SCOTT, William CAMPBELL and John SHERIDAN.\n\nA second house of worship was built in 1833 at a [p.157]cost of about $3,200, and a third in 1862, at a cost of about $7,000. In 1875, what may be called the fourth house of worship of this church was built at a cost of over $16,000. The greater part of the old building was left standing and formed a part of the new.\n\nThe growth of the society has been fully as rapid and large as the frequent rebuilding would indicate. Not quite half of a century since (in 1834), the church had 105 members. During the period from that year until 1859 there were received, on examination, 317 members, or an average of nearly thirteen per year. During the same time there were received, on certificate, 182 members, making in all 499. The years 1836,1843, 1851, 1853, 1858, and 1865. In the first year mentioned, twenty-six, members were received; in 1843, twenty-four; in 1851, twenty-six; in 1853, twenty-two; in 1858, fifty-six, and in 1865, thirty-nine. The present number of members is about two hundred and seventy-five.\n\nThe Presbyterian Church of Butler has sent out many men eminent and useful in the cause of religion. Hon. Walter LOWRIE for many years Secretary of the American Board of Foreign Missions and the leading spirit in the work of building it up, went out from this church in 1835, relinquishing, to accept the position, the office of Secretary of the United States Senate. While the Rev. John COULTER was pastor, Dr. SCOTT, who afterward became President of Washington College, was received into the church on examination. Seven ministers have gone forth from the church who were born and baptized here--six of them Presbyterian and one a Methodist. They were Alexander S. THORN, Alexander B. MAXWELL, Loyal Y. GRAHAM, William O. CAMPBELL, Alonzo LINN and Josiah MCPHERRIN (of the Presbyterian ministry) and Robert CUNNINGHAM (of the Methodist.). Three other young men who became ministers--J. Fulton BOYD, Samuel M. ANDERSON and Matthew L. ANDERSON---while students, were converted here and received into the church. Rev. John C. LOWRIE. D. D., Rev. Walter M. LOWRIE, the martyred missionary, and Rev. Reuben P. LOWRIE, who went to China, had their birth and baptism here.\n\nUnited Presbyterian Church, -- The date of the organization of the Associate Reformed Church in Butler is not known. It must have been organized several years before the arrival of its first pastor, the Rev. Isaiah NIBLOCK, in 1819. As far back as 1808, the Rev. Matthew HENDERSON was appointed to preach a day in Butler. In 1810, application was made for supply of sermon and an ordained minister to baptize the children. In February, 1811, application was made for the moderation of a call from the united congregations of Butler and Deer Creek. A call was made out for Rev. James MCCONNELL, but it was not prosecuted by the Butler Branch, and, in March, the society presented a petition praying ï¿½the dissolution of their connection with Deer Creek and the establishment of a connection with Slippery Rock, and for a member to moderate in a call.ï¿½ The petition was granted and a call was moderated for Mr. George BUCHANAN, at Butler, in the following month, but was declined by him. A call was extended in 1815, to Rev. Robert REED, then settled at Erie, but the people were again disappointed and continued dependent upon supplies--among whom were Revs. Matthew HENDERSON, John RIDDLE, David PROUDFIT, Mungo DICK, Joseph KERR, Moses KERR, MCELROY and others. At length, however, they had a settled pastor. In the minutes of the Presbytery, the following note occurs: ï¿½Mr. Isaiah NIBLOCK,* a licentiate from the Presbytery of Managhan (late Burgher), Ireland, presented credentials on the credit of which he was received as a probationer under the direction of the Presbytery.ï¿½ The original is in the possession of his son, the Rev. John NIBLOCK, and is dated April 23, 1819.\n\n*A biographical sketch of the Rev. Isaiah NIBLOCK for more than forty-five years pastor of the United Presbyterian Church, appears elsewhere in the volume.\n\nMr. NIBLOCK was ordained and installed November 17, 1819, there being present on that occasion, Matthew HENDERSON, John RIDDELL, Mungo DICK, James MCCONNELL, Joseph KERR, Moses KERR, George BUCHANAN, Mr. CRAIG and Allen D. CAMPBELL. The Rev. NIBLOCKï¿½S pastorate continued from 1819 until a short time prior to his death, which occurred June 29, 1864, a period of forty-six years. After his death, the church had supplies. The Rev. John GAILEY, was called, accepted and ordained April 24, 1866. He served six years. Rev. George M. MCCORMICK was installed as pastor October 22, 1872, and served about one year. The present pastor, Rev. R. G. FURGUSON, was called in April, 1874, commenced his labors the 1st of July and was installed January 18, 1875. The first Elders of whose installation there is any record, were Thomas DODDS and Hugh MCKEE. The date was 1812. Next in order of time came John POTTS, Robert LEMMON, Benjamin Wallace and James CRISWELL, but the dates of their installation are not known. In 1834, William JAMISON, Robert MCNAIR, William BORLAND and George MILLER were elected, and, in 1842, Thomas G. BERRY, Samuel G. PURVIS, John L. BARTLY, David LOGAN and Isaac BREWSTER.\n\nThe society had no church building for five or six years after Mr. NIBLOCK began his ministry, services being held in the old court house and in the ravine below the North Cemetery, near a spring. Hugh MCKEE obtained permission, and members of the congregation hauled logs to the spot, and, placing them [p.158]upon blocks, made rude seats or pews. In 1824, a deed was given by Robert CAMPBELL and wife to John POTTS in trust for the Associate Reformed Church of Butler, for Lot 138, of which the church now stands. The sum paid for it was $50. In 1825, John POTTS, Benjamin WALLACE, James ALLISON, John DODDS, Robert LEMMON and Hugh MCKEE, Trustees of the church made a contract with the BRYSON Brothers for the erection of a house of worship. the brick work was commenced in June. The building was duly completed and remained without alteration or improvement until 1867, when a vestibule of fourteen feet was added on MCKEAN street, and the gallery was taken down. In 1871, an extension of tweet feet was made at he east end of the church. In the first improvement, about $4,000 was expended and in the second, $3,000. Various lesser improvements have been made from time to time.\n\nThe Sabbath school in connection with this church has existed since 1823. It was originally a union school, Episcopalians and Presbyterians joining with the Associate Reformed people. The officers, elected in the spring of 1824, were: President, William AYRES; Secretary, Jacob MECHLING; Superintendents, Hugh MCKEE, John GILMORE, Joseph MCQUISTION, Maurice BREDIN, John POTTS and Robert LEMMON. The school was re-organized in 1829, with John POTTS as President, and, in 1831, became a denominational school, with Hugh MCKEE as President.\n\nButler Methodist Episcopal Church.-- The first society or class of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Butler was organized as nearly as can be ascertained about the year 1825. Among her first members were Andrew SPROUT and wife, Mr. DOBBS and wife, Bennett DOBBS and wife, David ALBRIGHT and wife, Mrs. PATTERSON, Mrs. John NEGLEY, Elijah BURKHART, and Caleb BROWN, the first class leader.\n\nIn 1826, Rev. John CHANDLER was appointed as preacher in charge of Butler Circuit, at which time Rev. William SWARZIE appears to have been Presiding Elder. In 1827, Caleb BROWN, the class leader of Butler society, and son of Robert BROWN, Esq., of old Middlesex Township, by the vote and recommendation of the Butler society, was licensed as an exhorter; and in the fall of the same year was placed in charge of Meadville Circuit as a supply in place of Rev. J. LEACH, whose health had failed.\n\nThe records for the Butler Circuit for the year 1828-29-30 cannot be found. From 1831 to and including 1882, the following statement, as nearly as can be ascertained, gives the names of the preachers in charge of Butler Circuit and of Butler appointment and station. The conference years do not date from the beginning of the years, but takes in of includes parts of two years:\n\n1831-32, James GILMORE; 1832-33-34, William CARROL and Harvey BRADSHAW; 1834-35, Abner JACKSON and Lewis JANNEY; 1835-36, Abner JACKSON, E.

TURNER; 1882, Homer J. SMITH.\n\nThe first church edifice of the society in Butler, a plain substantial brick building of one story, was erected, as nearly as can be as ascertained, about the year 1827, in the southwest part of the town, on Lot No. 57, purchased of John NEGLEY, Sr.; consideration $125; deed executed July 12, 1837, to William STEWART, Esq., Andrew SPROUT, Henry CARSNER, James MCNAIR, John WAGLEY, Joshua J. SEDWICK, Andrew CARNS, John HOWE and James MILLER, Trustees.\n\nJanuary 26, 1833, James MCNAIR and William STEWART were class leaders.\n\nApril 24, 1841, the membership was reported as seventy-nine. Butler Sunday school in 1842 consisted of seven teachers, fifty scholars and had 306 volumes in the library. In 1843, the Butler Circuit was composed of eighteen appointments, with a total membership of 522.\n\nFrom the organization of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Butler in 1825 or 1826, it was one of the regular appointments of Butler Circuit up to August 9, 1851, when by a vote of the Quarterly Conference it was set off as a station, having sixty-two members, with Rev. Alfred G. WILLIAMS as preacher in charge, George C. BOESSING, John MILLINGER, Daniel MOSER and William DERRIMORE were elected Stewards. It [p.159]remained a station for only one year, when it was again united with Butler Circuit.\n\nDuring the prevalence of a terrible storm on the 19th day of April, 1856, a considerable portion of the brick wall of the church were blown down, the repairing of which cost about $1,000.\n\nDecember 15,1860, articles of incorporation were duly granted the Butler society by the Court of Common Pleas of Butler County. In 1865, Butler Circuit was composed of four appointments, viz., Butler, Brownsdale, Petersville and the Temple. W. H. TIBBLES was preacher in charge.\n\nIn the spring of 1867, Butler appointment was set off as a circuit, with Rev. J. D. LEGGER as preacher in charge; James MCNAIR, local Deacon; Thomas HUSELTON, S. R. DIEFFINBACHER, C. E. ANDERSON, S. E. W. THOMPSON and Jesse M. JONES, as stewards, and S. R. DIEFFINBACHER and C. E. ANDERSON, as Class Leaders.\n\nNovember 5, 1868, the church decided to erect a new house of worship, and Theodore HUSELTON, Rev. J. D. LEGGET and C. E. ANDERSON were appointed a committee to select a suitable site. April 1, 1873, a deed to the present ground occupied by the church was procured at an expense of $3,500. April 4, 1873, the old church property was disposed of for $2,500.\n\nThe new church building (brick) was completed in the spring of 1874, costing in round numbers $16,000--furnishings, $2,000. Total value of church property, $20,000. A this writing (1882), the church has a membership of 250 and a flourishing Sunday school of 300 scholars. Pastorï¿½s salary, $1,200.\n\nSt. Peterï¿½s Church.-- The Protestant Episcopal Church of Butler called St. Peterï¿½s Church, was organized in the year A.D. 1824.\n\nThe first minister was the Rev. Robert AYRES, and the membership at that time consisted of but few families. When the first meeting was held to organize and take steps toward the erection of a church building, the members present in the court house were Hon. John GILMORE, Hon. John BREDIN, Maurice BREDIN, Esq., John B. MCGLAUGHIN, James BREDIN, Benjamin WALLACE, Moses HANLIN, Samuel R. WILLIAMS, Campbell E. PURVIANCE, Samuel A. PURVIANCE, William DIXON, Samuel A. GILMORE, John N. PURVIANCE, Mrs. John GILMORE, Mrs. Ann ANDERSON, Mrs. John PURVIANCE, Mrs. James BREDIN, Miss Susan BREDIN, Mrs. Hugh MCGLAUGHIN, Mrs. Thomas COLLINS and others. The Right Rev. John M. HOPKINS, then Rector of Trinity Church, Pittsburgh, Penn., and afterward Bishop of the diocese of Vermont, presided. The first matter of consideration after divine services was the procuring of a suitable lot of ground. Judge BREDIN, then a practicing attorney, generously proposed to and did donate a lot suitable in size and location on Jefferson street, it being the lot upon which the church building was erected, and is now at this writing (1882) the building in which the congregation has worshipped ever since. Subscriptions were next in order, and Bishop HOPKINS headed the list by a very liberal donation, in that day, of $100, and all others present followed by contributions as they felt able, the amount then subscribed being about $1,000. this sum and a free lot of ground was deemed sufficient to justify commencement of a church building. Accordingly, the same was soon after put under contract to Robert BROWN, of Kittanning, and is the same church building now in use, though considerably enlarged and beautified. Prior to the erection of the building of the church, divine services were held in the court house, the Rev. Robert AYRES officiating as rector. The first pastor of the new church was the Rev. M. P. BONNELL. He commenced to officiate in 1824, holding services for a time in the court house, and continued about three years. He was succeeded by the Rev. William G. HILTON, who continued to officiate as rector about six years, when he resigned. the Rev. Thomas CRUMPTON took charge and continued for six months; then the Rev. William WHITE, D. D., began his duties in the year A. D. 1837, and continued to officiate for a period of forty years, up to 1877, when upon his resignation, or soon to succeed him on the 8th of January, 1878; he resigned on the 13th of April, 1880, to take effect on the 1st of June the next, when, after an interregnum of a few months, a call was extended to the Rev. Edmund BURKE, of Carthage, N. Y., who accepted and commenced his duties as rector on the 1st of December, 1880, and is now, 1882, the minister of St. Peterï¿½s Church.\n\nThe church services are well attended, and the communicants number, according to the last report of the rector on the 10th of May, 1882, to the Annual Diocesan Convention, 118 communicant members. Present rector and officers: Rector, Rev. Edmund BURKE; Vestrymen, E. MCJUNKIN, Jacob ZIEGLER, William MECHLING, John N. PURVIANCE, Thomas LINDSAY, James BREDIN and Dr. S.R. DIEFFENBACHER; Senior Warden, John N. PURVIANCE; Junior Warden, Jacob ZIEGLER; Secretary, John N. PURVIANCE; Treasurer, E. MCJUNKIN: Superintendent of Sunday school, P. S. BANCROFT; Collector, William MECHLING; Sexton, W. E. HENRY.\n\nIt may be noted that prior to the organization of the church, the Rev. Jackson KEMPER, afterward Bishop, visited Butler in the year 1818, as agent for the society for the advancement of Christianity in Pennsylvania, and held divine services in that year in the parlor of the late Hon. John GILMORE; a number of children were then baptized by him.\n\n[p.160]\n\nIt may also be noted that the church was greatly aided in its early struggles by the help of the Rev. John M. HOPKINS, afterward Bishop of Vermont, then rector of Trinity Church, Pittsburgh, whose efforts contributed largely to the establishment of the church in Western Pennsylvania.\n\nSt. Markï¿½s Evangelical Lutheran Church.*-- Official records of ministerial acts among German Lutherans of this place date from A. D. 1813. The first entry in the ï¿½church bookï¿½ is the baptism of Samuel BERNHARD, son of Philip and Mary Margaret BERNHARD, August 29, 1813, by Rev. Jacob SCHNEE. This reverend gentleman continued his missionary visits, preaching occasionally in a carpenterï¿½s shop, to the end of 1817, baptizing in the meanwhile the following persons: Elizabeth, Solomon and Samuel PFLUEGER, MAGDALENA, Henry, Abraham and Margaret BRINKER, Anna and Jacob BRAUM, Joshua H. CARRE, Michael ANDRE, Samuel and Thomas MECHLING, Susan, Robert, Abraham and Sarah OSSENBACHER, William and Anna M. HENRY, Frank and Elizabeth WORMKESSEL, Abraham and Martin MCCANDLESS, Sarah STEP, Franklin BASH, Daniel SHANER, George KOENIG, Margaret BUECHLE, Anna M. SLATER and Mary BARKSTRASSER.\n\n*By Rev. E. CRONENWETT.\n\nIn November, 1821, Bishop J. C. G. SCHWEIZERBARTH, a scholarly divine, somewhat eccentric, hailing from Stuttgart, Germany, then licensed, took charge of the interests of Lutheranism in this vicinity, attending for a series of years from his headquarters at Zelienople, to eleven stations in Butler and adjoining counties. It is said that he invariably wore a clerical robe in all his ministerial perambulations. He preached every four weeks in the old court house, whilst for communion services, he availed himself of the courtesy of the U. P. Church. He records that when he came he found but six members. On June 3, he first administered communion to the congregation, having the day previous confirmed his first class of catechumens and effected a preliminary organization. The officials chosen were Jacob MECHLING, John MCCULLOUGH and John HANDSCHUH. In addition to these, those first communicants were: Joseph MOSER, Henry YOUNG, Isaac YEDDER, Jacob BAHT, Henry STEINMANN, A. BUECHLE, Mrs. Elizabeth SHANER, M. MCCULLOUGH, Magdalen HANDSCHUH, Catharine MOSER, Louise BRINKER, Anna YOUNG, Mary YEDDER, Elizabeth TRAUSU, Elizabeth BESCHT, and Miss Helen HANDSCHUH. Together with the catechumens: ï¿½Jacob SHANER, Philip GRUB, Peter PFLUEGER, David and Abraham HANDSCHUH, Catharine GRUB, Elizabeth BRAUN, Sarah BAHT, Mary BUECHLE, Elizabeth HANDSCHUH, Elizabeth MCCULLOUGH and MAGDALENA YOUNG.\n\nTen years later, steps were taken to draft a permanent constitution, to secure a charter and build a church. The application to the Legislature of Pennsylvania for an act of incorporation, was signed, November 25, 1837, by the following council: G. SCHWEIZERBARTH, pastor; Jacob MECHLING, Jacob SHANER, Jacob WALTER, Isaac YEDDER, Peter NICKLAS, John SORBER, David HANDSCHUH,, Dr. Carl EICHHOLTZ, John DULL, John OESTERLING, Michael ZIMMERMANN.\n\nThe charter was officially endorsed by David R. PORTER, on April 13, 1841. According to this document, the foregoing council, or their successors in office, are constituted a corporate and body politic in law and in fact, to have continuance forever by the name, style and title, ï¿½The Ministers, Trustees, Elders and Deacons of the German Evangelical Lutheran Congregation of St. Marcus Church in Butler.ï¿½ Meanwhile, the corner-stone to a brick church structure, 40x60x22, with a basement of eight feet for school purposes, the whole surmounted by a belfry, was laid on the corner of Wayne and McKean streets, Butler, July 8, 1840. It was dedicated September 26, 1841, by the Revs. J. C. G. SCHWEIZERBARTH, D. ROTHACKER and H. MELSHEIMER, respectively the President, Secretary and Treasurer of the ï¿½Eastern District of the Evangelical Lutheran Joint Synod of Ohio and other States,ï¿½ at its sixth convention, then being held in Butler. The legend on the inscription stone of that building runs thus:\n\nT E M P L U M\n\nE v L U T H E R A N U M\n\nSr MARCO\n\nI N S C R I P T U M\n\nCAD. MDCCCXL.\n\nIn the cost of the building, some $4,0000, the members, then numbering 200 communicants, had overestimated their financial strength, and the church council got themselves individually into sore straits. To redeem their personal property from attachment, as well as to save the church from the hammer, they severally, after exhausting their own resources, made pilgrimages elsewhere for aid. The aggregate result tided the congregation over the sorest need, and the church was saved. In 1847, a small organ was bought, and subsequently a congregational burial-ground secured. [Ed. Note: Peter Duffy bio sketch facing page 160 is at the end of this chapter.]\n\nOriginally the congregation had among its membership a sprinkling of American born. Some of these, together with others, were, through Rev. G. BASSLER, of Zelienople, January 16, 1843, organized into an English Lutheran congregation, and for a few years held services in the German church. This drew off the English element, and in consequence St. Markï¿½s congregation remained purely German. bishop J. C. G. SCHWEIZERBARTHï¿½S pastoral relation with the congregation continued till April, 1849, a period [p.161]of nearly twenty-eight years. During the latter part of this time, Rev. Frederick ILLIGER was called, who, however, after a brief activity of but several months, departed this life in Butler, March 23, 1848. He rests on the burial-ground of the congregation.\n\nRev. William A. FETTER then became the first permanent resident pastor, April 8, 1849, remaining in office till the summer of 1863, when he removed to another part of his charge, Millerstown, this county. He died July 10, 1865, aged fifty-nine years, eight months and twenty-two days, and was buried in the North Cemetery of this place.\n\nDuring an interval of several months, the congregation was temporarily supplied by Rev. J. M. WOLF and others, till in January, 1864, it secured the services of Rev. G. F. H. MEISER, of Galion, Ohio. During his pastorate a comfortable parsonage on Wayne street, and a large pipe organ were procured. Through his instrumentality, the congregation, in accordance with the confessional position of the ï¿½ Evangelical Lutheran Joint Synod of Ohio,ï¿½ placed itself on record on the subject of ï¿½Secret societies,ï¿½ taking special exception to the doctrinal bearings of their semi-religious phrases.\n\nIn January, 1869, Rev. C. H. W. LUEBKERT, of Loudonville, Ohio, succeeded Rev. G. T. H. MEISER, who resigned at a call from Youngstown, Ohio. During his pastorate, the question as to the legal right of the congregation to excommunicate members, because of affiliation with secret orders, was carried into court. The court below found the expulsion of the plaintiffs void, and protected them from further discipline for the same cause. The Supreme Court rescinded the second clause, but sustained the first, on the ground of want of jurisdiction. In keeping with the general polity of the Lutheran Church, the congregation had acted in the matter as collective body, whilst the charter required action by the church council, as such. this had been overlooked. Action by this legal judicatory of the congregation would have been final.\n\nOn the removal of Rev. C. H. W. LUCLEKERT, November, 1876, to Washington, D.C., St. Markï¿½s congregation extended a call to Rev. E. CRONENWETT, then at Delawre, Ohio, which was accepted in January, 1877. In the matter of congregational school, the congregation had suffered disheartening experience. The congregation engaged the services of Mr. J. H. WULLER, teacher of music in Butler, for choir and organ, and the pastors themselves often personally attended to a summer term of instruction. Mr. WULLER finally, in 1876, resigned his post at the organ. In February, 1877, Prof. J. M. HELFRICH, formerly of Carthage College, Illinois, was called to fill the vacancy, and entered into hearty co-operation with the pastor, both in church and school. The prosperity of the congregation as to its future development, called for a timely introduction of the English language in the public services, and this was accordingly done on Sunday evenings, with gratifying results. A new era dawned upon the congregation. A no inconsiderable debt had gradually been accumulating, and in addition to its removal, the time-worn church needed extensive renovation. The debt was speedily canceled, and then the members made bold to utter preference for a new church in a more desirable locality. Accordingly, in the spring of 1878, a spacious lot was secured for this purpose, on the corner of Washington and Jefferson streets, for the sum of $3,000.\n\nIn the midst of general hopefulness and preparation for building, the congregation was called upon to morn the death of Prof. J. M. HELFRICH. He was called away, after brief but fatal illness, on June 26, 1878, at the age of twenty-six years ten months and twenty-two days. His remains were interred at Carrollton, Ohio. His sister, Miss Mary E. HELFRICH, afterward succeeded him as organist of St. Markï¿½s.\n\nThe corner-stone to the new church edifice was laid August 15, 1878. The speakers on the occasion were: Revs. G. CRONENWETT, of Woodville, Ohio; G. F. H. MEISER, and Prof. M. LOY, of Columbus, Ohio, the latter in English. According to Lutheran custom, various documents were deposited in the corner-stone.\n\nThe dedication of the church took place on September 7, 1879. Rev. G. F. H,. MEISER delivered the farewell address at the old church, and Revs. G. CRONENWETT, H. A. FELDMANN, of Canton, Ohio, and J. L. TRANGER, of Petersburg, Ohio, spoke in the new, the latter in English. The pastor led the dedicatory formula. In style of architecture, the building is somewhat mediaeval Gothic, with corner tower and strong buttresses. The material is brick, and with stone trimmings. Exterior dimensions: Fifty-eight feet across the front; across the body of the church, fifty feet; extreme length, one hundred feet. The basement story, for lecture and schoolrooms, is twelve feet high; the auditorium above has a height of eighteen feet at the sides and thirty-four feet in the middle angle, exposing to view the ceiling timbers. Its interior dimensions, including the gallery, and arched altar recess, are 47x88 feet. The architect was D. I. KUHN, of Hulton Station, Allegheny County, Penn. The contractors and builders, H. BAUER & Bro., members of the congregation. The inscription stone of the old church has been preserved as a relic, and is inserted in the inner front of the new. the cost of the entire property, site, structure, sheds, fencing, pavements, etc., amounting to some $18,000, has all bee successfully met.\n\n[p. 162]\n\nDuring the past half century, St. Markï¿½s congregation, in addition to the usual loss of members by death, removal, etc., suffered several more extensive drains through branch organization of its membership. Out of it grew, in some measure, the English Lutheran Church of Butler; then, largely, the so-called ï¿½Whiteï¿½ Church, some four miles west of this place; next, an effort at an ï¿½Evangelicalï¿½ Church in town, which turned out German Reformed, and then became extinct; and lastly, at the close of 1876, the German Lutheran Church of Summit Township, some four miles east. The territory of the congregation still extends in its extreme limits from five to seven miles in all directions from Butler. It number 450 communicants or differently stated, 100 subscribing members. Its German Sabbath school attendance in the morning averages eighty-five children, and its German-English summer school, sixty.\n\nDuring these threescore and nine years, the pastors of St. Markï¿½s, as such, baptized 1,626 persons, mostly infants and children; confirmed 897 members; married 273 couples, and buried 371 persons.\n\nThe present council of the congregation consists of E. CRONENWETT, pastor; Gottlieb HEROLD, Capt. J. G. RIPPUS, Peter OESTERLING, Frederick BAUER, Elders; William SIEBERT, Treasurer; Frederick HENNINGER, Secretary; John KREDEL, Matthias KECK, Deacons; H. Julius KLINGER, Jacob KECK, Esq., J. C. GROHMANN, Trustees.\n\nEnglish Evangelical Lutheran Church.-- The first meeting in Butler of those favorable to the organization of an English Lutheran Church was held in the German Church of the same denomination, upon January16, 1843, Jacob MECHLING being Secretary, and the Rev. Gobtlieb BASSLER, Treasurer. A church constitution was adopted for the guidance of the organization, and at a subsequent meeting the first church council was elected, consisting of Jacob WALTER, Sr., and John NEGLEY, Sr., Elders, and John DULL, Jr., and Daniel KREIDLER, Deacons. John NEGLEY subsequently resigned, and John MCCULLOUGH was chosen in his place. The officers were installed February 11, 1843. The Rev. Mr. BASSLER served as pastor, and upon June 18, conducted the first sacramental services. About thirty persons had signed the constitution, thus identifying themselves with the new organization, and the number was increased at the first communion service by the reception of fourteen new members. The labors of Rev. BASSLER covered a period of about eleven years, from 1843-1854, with a brief interregnum. The society spent some time negotiating with the German Lutherans for the joint use of their church, but no arrangement was effected and the question of building was then agitated. A house was erected in 1849-50, upon a lot donated by Michael EMRICK, which for twenty-seven years served the congregation as a place of worship. During the period of the Rev. BASSLERï¿½S ministry, the ordinance of baptism was administered to fifty children and upward of seventy adults. Among the adult baptisms there was that of an Indian, who had bee convicted of a most brutal murder, a mother and several children being the victims. The Indian was none other than Samuel MOHAWK, who was confined in jail in Butler waiting the execution of the capital sentence, and who had been converted by Mr. BASSLER. The baptism was solemnized at the prison on February 28, 1844. It was while Rev. BASSLER was pastor of the church, about a year after its organization, that the Pittsburgh Synod was organized, and it was in Butler that the preliminary conference was held for the purpose of making arrangements for the organization of the Synod. The place of meeting was in a little building on Washington street, which had originally been the jail, but which was at that time a private dwelling. Those who followed the Rev. BASSLER as pastors of the church were: Rev. A. H. WATERS, from June, 1855, to April, 1861; Rev. J. H. Fritz, from April, 1861, to October, 1869; Rev. L. H. GESHWIND, from August, 1870, to May, 1874, and the present minister, Rev. J. Q. WATERS, since July, 1875. Early in the spring of 1876, negotiations were entered into for the purchase of the property of the WITHERSPOON University, now owned and occupied by the church. The changes and improvements made cost about $1,700, and the total cost of remodeling and purchase was about $7,700.\n\nGerman Catholic Church.-- The first Roman Catholic house of worship was a stone chapel, which stood upon a hill in the eastern part of the borough, where is now the Catholic burying ground. It was built in 1822, the ground being donated for the purpose. The building committee consisted of John DUFFY, Norbet FOLTZ and William HAGGERTY, the last named being also the contractor. The church was known by the name of St. Peterï¿½s. Prior to the construction of the house of worship, in the year 1821, Rev. Charles FERRY came to the village and organized the congregation, which consisted originally of English (or Irish) Catholics. His pastorate continued until 1826, when he was succeeded by Rev. P. P. Oï¿½NEIL. In 1835, Rev P. RAFFERTY assumed the charge. Since this time the succession of priests has been as follows: Revs. Joseph CODY, John MITCHELL, Joseph CREEDEN. The present church, known as the German Catholic, was built in 1849.\n\nSt. Paulï¿½s English Catholic Church.-- This neat, though unpretentious church edifice, stands fronting on MCKEAN street, in one of the prettiest locations in the borough. Its erection was begun in April, 1866, [p.163] and in the month of February, in the following year, it was dedicated by Bishop Domence, of Pittsburgh, assisted by a large number of the diocesan clergy. A great number of the citizens of the borough were also present at the ceremonies.\n\nThe original members of this church were among the first Catholic settlers of the county and before the present church was built, worshipped in St. Peterï¿½s, or, as it is now called, the German Catholic Church, which they in no small degree helped by their contributions to erect. A strong tide of German Catholic immigration to this place set in, and in a few years after the original members of St. Peterï¿½s found themselves largely outnumbered by the German element. It was not long before a priest of their own (the latterï¿½s) nationality was placed in charge of the church, and ultimately it came about that nearly all the services were conducted in the German language. English services were held only at long intervals. Urged by this condition of things, the English-speaking members determined to build a church for themselves, in which they could have the Gospel preached in the vernacular. The initiative in this good work was taken by Mr. Peter DUFFY. He not only contributed largely to the erection of the church, but gave the building of it his personal supervision. The other members likewise contributed according to their means. The membership of St. Paulï¿½s, although at first small, has been annually increasing. The first priest who assumed the pastoral charge of the parish, was the Rev. Stephen M. A. BARRETT, a native of Pittsburgh and graduate of the Propaganda College in Rome. He came here in February, 1867, when the church was dedicated, and remained about one year. He was succeeded by Rev. Daniel DEVLIN, also a native of Pittsburgh, whose pastorate was also of short duration, as within thirteen months, by illness to resign, and died soon after. The next priest whom we find in charge was the Rev. Joseph COFFEY, who came here in October, 1868, and left in the month of December in the same year. The next pastor was the Rev. James NOLAN, who began his labors in January, 1869, and was transferred in June of the same year to McKeesport. He was succeeded by Rev. Francis J. Oï¿½SHEA, who took charge of the parish in June, 1869, and continued pastor until March, 1872. He had for successor Rev. Francis MCCARTHY, whose appointment seems to have been but temporary, as he remained only three months. The next in succession was Rev. Columba MCSWEENEY. He became pastor in July, 1872, and remained in that relation till November, 1876, when he was compelled to resign all active duties, owing to great physical infirmities. He was immediately succeeded as missionary rector by the present incumbent, Rev. William Ambrose NOLAN, who assumed the pastoral charge on the 10th of November, 1876, and has continued in that office until the present time. During his administration, many and costly improvements have been made and the membership largely increased. He continues to discharge the duties of his exalted office with zeal and acceptance.\n\nThe first baptism administered in St. Paulï¿½s Church was that of William John VINROE, on the 17th of February, 1867. The first marriage solemnized in the same church was that of Augustine JACKMAN and Frances Sophia VINROE, on the 26th of February, 1867. In looking over the registry of deaths, the first death in the parish is recorded to have occurred on the 10th of August, 1867. On account of its quaintness, we give a literal translation in English of the original Latin entry:\n\nï¿½On this day, 10th August, 1867, John MILLER, infant son of Hugh MILLER and of his wife, Ha"
