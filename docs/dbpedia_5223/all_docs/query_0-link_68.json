        "text": "Indigenous Student Conscripts and the Foundation of the US University ABSTR ACT Taking Indigenous sovereignty as at once axiomatic and constitutively strategic, this article argues that it is necessary to expand the chronology and disrupt the geographic certitude through which the history and present of US higher education and its internationalization are conventionally understood. Colleges and universities in the British colonies and what became the United States, including Harvard, William & Mary, and Dartmouth, were founded and funded with the intention that they would function as a vital technology through which the nation-state and white Christian culture would reproduce and secure themselves, their possessions, and their futures. This project was to be accomplished through the assimilation and at times incorporation of people, often youth, from polities understood as fundamentally other from that of their instructors and benefactors. Assessments of the extent to which such projects were effectuated vary, but it is well established that contemporary universities and colleges are conceptually and financially rooted in colonial educational projects that targeted Indigenous students for incorporation and assimilation. In an era when many of these same institutions are making substantial, if inadequate, efforts to contend with their historical origins, it is necessary to move beyond acknowledgment of these histories and contend, instead, with how such projects materially and epistemologically underwrite the basic functions of the most well-resourced and prestigious higher education institutions of the present.\n\nThe Standing Rock Sioux’s ongoing efforts to halt the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline through their lands have brought national attention to an issue that many would prefer to ignore: the past and present of U.S. settler colonization. Although colonial logics remain largely unexamined in the study of higher education, there is not one contemporary campus issue that isn’t significantly shaped by it: sexual assault; persistently Eurocentric curricula; institutional symbols; enrolment and graduation rates of Indigenous students; the normative white male-ness that orients many theories of student development; the de facto closure of the American Indian studies program at UIUC and the chronic underfunding of other Indigenous studies programs and of tribal colleges and universities; and, of course, the land itself upon which all of our institutions sit. According to Rowe and Tuck (2016), “Settler colonialism is about the pursuit of land, not just labor or resources. Settler colonialism is a persistent societal structure, not just an historical event or origin story for a nation-state. Settler colonialism has meant genocide of Indigenous peoples, the reconfiguring of Indigenous land into settler property. In the United States and other slave estates, it has also meant the theft of people from their homelands (in Africa) to become property of settlers to labor on stolen land.” In this sense, settler colonization, alongside slavery and its afterlife, is not ancillary to but rather constitutive of the ongoing material structure and ordering logics of both the U.S. nation- state and global capitalism. Institutions of U.S. higher education have also been implicated in these harmful systems since their very beginnings. As Wilder (2013) describes in Ebony and Ivy, “American colleges were not innocent or passive beneficiaries of conquest and colonial slavery. The European invasion of the Americas and the modern slave trade pulled peoples throughout the Atlantic world into each others’ lives, and colleges were among the colonial institutions that braided their histories and rendered their fates dependent and antagonistic” (p. 11). Yet, overall the field of higher education has yet to have a sustained conversation about the centrality of colonialism in the foundations of our scholarship and practice. In her book, Transit of Empire: Indigenous Critiques of Colonialism, Jodi Byrd (2011) asks, “How might the terms of current academic and political debates change if the responsibilities of that very real lived condition of colonialism were prioritized as a condition of possibility?” (p. xx). I suggest that it is time for those of us in the field of higher education to ask ourselves this question, and the many that follow from it.\n\nThis article reviews the educational policies of Spain and England in their most emblematic colonies, Mexico and India, respectively, and compares them to those of the United States. Mexico and India share one important historical feature: both were colonies in which the native population greatly outnumbered European colonists and in which native cooperation was crucial to the colonial enterprise. In both cases, the European powers felt compelled to educate members of the native elites to conduct the business of empire for them. In contrast, the United States was a \"white colony,\" in which Europeans displaced the local populations, which were relatively small and consisted mostly of bands and tribes, as opposed to the states and empires found in Mexico and India. Thus, Europeans carried out the work of the colonies themselves or with the help of slaves imported from Africa, instead of relying on the indigenous population. After gaining independence from England, the United States developed an empire of its own, acquiring an immense amount of territory, mostly from the old Spanish Empire, which had controlled roughly half of the present land mass of the continental United States. In addition, the United States obtained sovereignty over other strategically important territories such as Alaska, Hawaii and various Pacific islands, and it unofficially controlled much of Latin America, which came to be considered its \"backyard.\" This enormous expansion of its territory and areas of influence transformed the United States into a world power and created new colonial populations, such as Native Alaskans, Native Hawaiians and Hispanics. The United States has always been reluctant to see itself as an empire, a political construct seemingly in conflict with its self-image as a defender of freedom. After all, the country is a democracy that established itself in opposition, first to the old British Empire, and then, to the old Spanish Empire, and its national myths glorify this opposition. Many Americans consider colonial conquest incompatible with the values of self-rule and self-representation that underpin the American republic. Thus, the country has a tendency to ignore its own record of colonial acquisition. This article reviews some key moments in the history of universities in the United States, with a view toward understanding the connection between education and empire. At present, the number of non-white people in the United States is increasing at such speed that some states are already majority-minority, that is, they have more people of color than whites, and the entire country is expected to become majority-minority in a few decades. Acknowledging the colonial history that transformed the country into a multicultural superpower would help revitalize its democratic ideals and create a higher level of inclusiveness, without which it will be difficult for its higher education system to meet the complex needs of the 21 st century. Keywords: Colonial universities, ethnic minorities and higher education If, as the saying goes, knowledge is power, the reverse is also true: power needs knowledge to establish and perpetuate itself. 1 That is why every major transformation in the economy, from the development of agriculture to the information age, has resulted in educational changes. It is also why all empires have educational policies, whether implicit or explicit, concerning their colonial subjects. This includes the United States, a modern empire that historically has been reluctant to acknowledge its status as such, a status conflicting with its self-image as the world's first secular democracy-the foremost defender of freedom. Nevertheless, in the process of becoming a superpower, the United States has gained dominion over other peoples. Like other empires, it has had different educational policies over time in response to changing circumstances. At the beginning, the tendency was to deny education to subjugated groups, such as black slaves, who often were not allowed to learn how to read or 1 We are grateful to John Douglass, who read the first draft of this article and offered helpful comments."
