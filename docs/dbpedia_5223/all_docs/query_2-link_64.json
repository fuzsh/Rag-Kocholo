        "text": "Recent research in various Moroccan areas allowed an update and a revision of the Moroccan Ephemeroptera checklist. In this case, 54 species are now listed, belonging to 10 families and 26 genera. The distribution of all studied species is discussed, as well as their biogeographical affinities. Moroccan Mayflies are characterized by a clear dominance of Mediterranean elements with a strong rate of endemism (33.4%).\n\nEuropean Pepper Moth or Southern European Marsh Pyralid Duponchelia fovealis (Zeller) (Insecta: Lepidoptera: Crambidae) (EENY508/IN910) Researchers are monitoring this notable greenhouse pest in northern Europe and Canada for the cut flower, vegetable and aquatic plant industries. Its native range is southern Europe, the eastern Mediterranean region, the Canary Islands, Syria and Algeria, but it has expanded its range to include other parts of Africa and the Middle East, northwest India, Europe, Canada and the United States. Recent survey detected adults in pheromone traps in 20 of the 26 Florida counties surveyed. This 11-page fact sheet was written by Stephanie D. Stocks and Amanda Hodges and published by the UF Department of Entomology and Nematology, December 2011. http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/in910\n\nAlong with some studies on soil fauna in various Sicilian sites, both agricultural lands and typical Mediterranean habitats, particular attention was paid to the Collembolan. Specific identification allowed to assess the occurrence in Sicily of 39 species not previously recorded, belonging to 10 families: Hypogastruridae (six species), Brachystomellidae (one species), Neanuridae (five species), Onychiuridae (three species), Tullbergiidae (seven species), Isotomidae (nine species), Entomobryidae (three species), Cyphoderidae (one species), Dicyrtomidae (one species), and Katiannidae (one species). Of these 39 species, 21 are new also for Italy. Furthermore, this is the first record of the genus Doutnatcia Rusek, 1974 for the fauna of Italy. The discovery of such a number of new species for Sicily (i.e. 35 % of those known) and Italy by sampling a limited number of habitats, shows that the knowledge relating to this group of arthropods in Sicily is still very scarce.
