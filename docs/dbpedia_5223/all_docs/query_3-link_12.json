        "text": "Jan 25, 2005 —\n\n1776: Philadelphia\n\nCall to arms empties York\n\nJames Smith of York signs the Declaration of Independence. Smith, one of the most prominent county residents of the 18th century, plays hometown host to several other signers arriving in York a year later as members of the Continental Congress. They find a town with few young men.\n\n\"York Town seems quite deserted.\" a diarist wrote in 1776, \"on account of the departure of all men under fifty years of age. Our young men had to leave for the army in Jersey.\" York's daily routine is at a standstill. \"All business and every occupation are prostrate, all shops are closed.\" the diarist wrote. \"How many prayers and tears will now be brought before the Lord, by parents for their children, by children for their parents, by wives for their husbands.\"\n\n1776: York County\n\nDobbin builds early school\n\nThe Rev. Alexander Dobbin builds a house that accommodates an early school. The school operated for 25 years in western York County, now Adams County. The structure today is known as the Dobbin House, a Gettysburg restaurant.\n\n1777: York County\n\nYork residents reject state oath\n\nCounty residents exchange their own oaths of anger toward several state-imposed oaths of allegiance designed to separate patriots from Tories. One oath renounces fidelity to the British king and pledges allegiance to Pennsylvania as an independent state. Those not adhering to the oath cannot vote, hold public office, or buy or sell real estate. York residents create a few choice words for the oath: \"impolitic, severe, cruel, unjust, breathing tyrany (sic) and injudicious.\" County residents, generally friendly to the patriot cause, believe the oath strengthens current officeholders and runs against the naturalization oath taken when they entered America. The General Assembly declines to enforce the oaths, and many in the county and in other rural areas ignore the pledge. The oaths, though, make county residents suspicious of those in power.\n\n1777: York\n\nPrinting press arrives in York\n\nThe first printing press west of the Susquehanna River, the Hall and Sellers press from Philadelphia, arrives in York. It starts turning in a building on the corner of West Market and North Beaver streets, on the future site of the county office building.\n\nHere, printers issue the Pennsylvania Gazette, government publications and about $10 million in currency while the Continental Congress meets in York.\n\n1777: York County\n\nNative suffers severe wound\n\nThe horrors of war come home to county residents when a British soldier stabs native son David Grier during the Battle of Brandywine. The bayonet enters Grier's side and penetrates upwards to the breastbone. Grier survives but can no longer fight. He returns to York, and the Continental Congress assigns him to the quartermaster's office, responsible for all military purchases. After the war, Grier, a lawyer, serves in the state General Assembly and as a delegate to the special convention that ratifies the U.S. Constitution. Grier never recovers from the war wound, his health begins to fail, and he dies in 1790 at the age of 49. \"Upwards of 25 years residence among us,\" a pastor said upon Grier's death, \"gave the citizens of this country generally an opportunity of knowing him; and we may safely say that the more he was known, the more he was respected. ...\"\n\n1777: York\n\nArticles sent for ratification\n\nJohn Hancock, Samuel Adams, Roger Sherman, John Witherspoon, Robert Morris, Richard Henry Lee and Francis Lightfoot Lee sign the Articles of Confederation, the forerunner to the U.S. Constitution. The Articles of Confederation, ratified by the states and in force in 1781, begin: \"TO ALL TO WHOM these Presents shall come, we the undersigned Delegates of the States affixed to our Names send greeting. \" Article I stated, \"The Stile of this confederacy shall be 'The United States of America.'\" The Articles gave Congress the right to raise an army and navy, wage war, fix standards of coinage and provide a postal service. The use of \"United States of America\" in a legal document, giving the central government authority over the states, gives impetus to the claim that York County was the first capital of the United States. Some dispute this status, noting that the country's name first appeared on the Declaration of Independence signed in Philadelphia in 1776. Further, they argue the Articles did not become binding until the last state, Maryland, ratified the document in 1781. The American government has met in York and eight other places: Philadelphia (four times); Baltimore; Lancaster; Princeton, N.J.; Annapolis, Md.; Trenton, N.J.; New York City and Washington, D.C. A convention met in Philadelphia in 1787 to draft the U.S. Constitution, successor to the Articles of Confederation. 1777-1778\n\nBritish try patriot souls\n\nThe delegates to the Continental Congress, arriving in York in late September 1777, do not look like the modern image of our Founding Fathers with neat three-cornered hats and powdered wigs. This mud-splattered and chilled band of patriots straggle into town after the redcoats pushed them and the Continental Army out of Philadelphia.\n\nYork County seems like the end of the earth to the likes of statesmen John Hancock and Samuel Adams because this frontier is, indeed, the end of significant civilization. Pamphleteer Thomas Paine is there with the patriots, telling about these times that are trying the souls of America's founders and the troops shivering in the Valley Forge snow.\n\nBut these troubling times become less troubled with each passing day. A messenger arrives telling of a patriot victory against British General Burgoyne in the Battle of Saratoga. In response, Congress declares a national day of prayer and thanksgiving, one of eight designated during the war.\n\nCongress, meeting daily in the Colonial Courthouse in York's Centre Square, votes that the Articles of Confederation should be sent to the governments of all 13 Colonies. The articles provide a plan to loosely knit a central government from the independent Colonies.\n\nLater, the Conway Cabal, a plan to remove General George Washington as head of Continental forces, becomes frayed in York. General Marquis de Lafayette's toast to George Washington helps reverse sentiment against the commander-in-chief. Lafayette's opinion weighs heavily because he represents the potential ally of France.\n\nNext, news reaches Congress that Louis XVI, the king of France, signed a treaty of alliance with the United States. It is now the United States and France against the British.\n\nSomeone starts ringing the bell in the courthouse. The people of York rejoice alongside the delegates.\n\nFinally, news reaches York on June 20, 1778, that the British have evacuated Philadelphia. Delegates prepare for a return to Philadelphia. Years later, a historian notes that the succession of positive events during Congress's nine months in York give the opening lines from Shakespeare's King Richard III a certain curious propriety: \"Now is the winter of our discontent/made glorious summer by this sun of York.\" These nine months of success make an indelible mark on the hearts and minds of county residents. Today, we frame historical images of our county heritage with wood from the Colonial Courthouse.\n\n1777-78: York\n\nGates fails to oust Washington\n\nGen. Horatio Gates, president of the Board of War, resides in the present-day Gates House on York's West Market Street. While here, Gen. Gates plays a key part in the Conway Cabal, an attempt to overthrow a beleaguered Gen. George Washington, wintering in Valley Forge, as commander in chief of revolutionary forces. Gates would try to be the new commander. The revolutionary government is also courting the support of France, represented in the colonies by Marquis de LaFayette. During a dinner at the Gates House, Lafayette rises and proposes a toast to Washington. Gates and others involved in the cabal are forced to honor the toast. \"He thought that they blushed.\" a historian wrote, \"but then, candlelight casts a ruddy glow on the faces of old politicians.\" The gesture helped the cabal to lose its fizzle. Washington remains commander of revolutionary forces through the end of the war. Gates provides one more bit of color before he departs York. He blames 20-year-old Col. James Wilkinson for the conspiracy. Wilkinson challenges Gates to a duel behind St. John's Episcopal Church. There, the unarmed Gates tells Wilkinson that he can't \"injure his own child.\" \"But, like the Cabal itself.\" a historian said, \"there was much talk and no action.\"\n\n1777-1778: York\n\nJohn Adams criticizes York\n\nJohn Adams, the future U.S. president, detracts from York County's tourism efforts. When in York with the Continental Congress, he caustically writes: \"The People are chiefly Germans, who have (church) Schools in their own Language, as well as Prayers, Psalms, and Sermons so that Multitudes are born, grow up and die here, without learning the English.\" Another visitor observes that, \"this York Town is a vile quarter. The (dirt) streets and its Dutch inhabitants are happily assimilated.\" Good thing Adams does not stay for more than a day in Lancaster on his way to York. York fares much better than its sister town, according to one witness.\n\n\"... (B)ut in walking about, I saw the Courthouse and few churches, which are very neat brick buildings, and I remarked the houses were much better built, and with more regularity than at Lancaster; of the two, though York is considerably less than the other, I should give it the preference for a place of residence.\" Later visitors joined Adams in criticizing York. In 1794, a visitor from France notes that the Codorus and the common (Penn Park) were pluses, but \"the place is not pleasant, although the streets are wide and well laid out, not paved nor lighted, but a sidewalk in front of the new houses. The courthouse, placed in the middle of the square, ridiculously shuts off the view of the whole of the 2 main streets.\" Another visitor from France in 1802 is more complimentary, noting that the houses were not as \"straggling as many others and were made of brick.\" He is not as flattering about the M'Logan Inn, 15 miles from York on the Carlisle Pike: \"There are always several beds in the rooms where you sleep: seldom do you meet with clean sheets. Fortunate is the traveler who arrives on the day they happen to be changed....\"\n\n1778: York\n\nLivingston dies in York\n\nPhilip Livingston of New York, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, dies in York while serving in the Continental Congress. His grave is in York's Prospect Hill Cemetery, moved there from York's German Reformed Church cemetery.\n\nA plaque honoring his original burial plot resided for years in the Woolworth store on West Market Street, built on the former church's site in the 20th century. It was moved to Zion United Church of Christ, successor to the original church, in 1997. Today Bob Livingston of Louisiana, Speaker of the U.S. House, comes from a long line of American politicians and patriots, which includes Philip.\n\n1778: York County\n\nMrs. Washington visits Hanover\n\nMartha Washington, wife of the commander in chief, passes through York. She is on her way from winter quarters in Valley Forge to her home in Mount Vernon, Va. She does not stay in York reportedly because of a cold reception from Elizabeth Gates, wife of Gen. Horatio Gates, a rich British-born citizen. Gen. Gates coveted the commander's position. Martha Washington, the future first lady, proceeds to Hanover, where she is warmly received.\n\n1779: York County\n\nMany join in Revolution\n\nThe county strongly supports the Revolutionary War in its early years. Col. Thomas Hartley observes after that the York area \"has armed first in Pennsylvania and has furnished more men for the war and lost a greater number of men in it than any other district on the continent of the same number individuals.\" In 1775, 3,349 militiamen are from the county. In 1778, the count of militiamen comes to 4,621 out of a county population of 25,000.\n\n1780: York County\n\nMoney not worth much\n\nThrifty county residents lose interest in money. Actually, the value of paper money is so low during these Revolutionary War years that residents prefer to barter. Residents believe that an entrepreneurial class is becoming rich by monopolizing commodities during the war years. Local leaders form a price-regulating board targeting, according to James Smith, \"a set of (local) extortionists, forestallers, engrossers, and depreciators of our currency who, like a swarm of locusts from a bottomless pit, threaten to obscure our political horizon and eat up every plant of liberty.\" The state attracts blame for economic conditions. Disenchanted county residents do not volunteer as readily for military services toward the end of the Revolutionary War.\n\n1781: York County\n\nStrange days for circuit riders\n\nThe frequent circuit riders passing through the county put up with rain, sleet, hail, lame horses -- and superstitious residents. Freeborn Garrettson, one of the pioneer American Methodist preachers, loses his way when heading toward East Berlin. He hears terrible groans from a woman who claims she sold her three children to the devil. The woman's husband tells Garrettson that his wife has been carrying a razor in her dress and has vowed to kill her children before the devil can take them. Garrettson invites the woman to a worship service the next day. By the end of the meeting, the woman is apparently calm. Later, the preacher learns that the woman has become \"a blessed, pious woman\" and her children are saved from an ill fate. Garrettson also ministers to a disturbed James Worley and his wife, Abigail, of York. The Worleys fall under conviction after hearing Garrettson preach and commence to rid themselves of their possessions. They start burning clothes, blankets, furniture and even money. Neighbors plead with the Worleys to stop and devise a plan to guarantee that they do so. A neighbor climbs onto the roof, stops up the chimney and the Worleys emerge. Garrettson returns and finds the Worleys in bad shape. He exhorts from the Bible and prays with them. Garrettson notes that the Worleys are restored physically and spiritually: \"In the end, it was for good; many were astonished and brought to serious consideration.\" 1781-83: Springettsbury Township\n\nCamp Security is misnamed\n\nCounty militia guard Camp Security, a prisoner-of-war stockade for British troops from the commands of Burgoyne, Cornwallis and others. Col. James Wood builds the stockade on Daniel Brubaker's land, about a mile south of Route 462 in future Springettsbury Township. Actually, the prisoners build the huts, and soldiers likely handle the important task of constructing the stockade. The soldiers drive 15-foot-long wooden posts, sharpened at each end, into the ground. Prisoners suffer the normal maladies of prisoners of war -- disease and food and clothing shortages. And numerous escapes by British prisoners suggest something else about the prison: Camp Security is not secure.\n\n1781: York\n\nMutiny leads to executions\n\nRevolutionary War Gen. \"Mad Anthony\" Wayne experiences an unsettling stay in York while awaiting orders to join Gen. Lafayette in the Yorktown campaign. Some county residents decline to part with goods and services because they consider the currency worthless and urge Wayne's men to ignore orders until they are compensated. A band of mutineers refuses to leave town and are arrested. A court martial sentences seven to be shot by a firing squad. \"Whether by design or accident, the particular friends and messmates of the culprits were their executioners,\" Wayne wrote, \"and while the tears rolled down their cheeks in showers, they silently and faithfully obeyed their orders without a moment's hesitation.\"\n\n1782: York County\n\nPreacher sees fertile ground\n\nAfter his second county visit, circuit rider Francis Asbury observes that the area will become fertile religious ground. \"I see God will work among the Menonists, Dunkers, Presbyterians, Lutherians (sic), Episcopalians, Dutch, English, no matter; the cause belongs to God.\" The Methodist bishop, head of his denomination in America, makes 12 visits to the county, the last coming in 1816. Asbury would preach anywhere and everywhere. But, surprisingly, he declines to speak during a 1789 visit, stating that he has \"no desire to speak.\" He passes through and preaches, instead, in Carlisle.\n\n1783: Hellam Township\n\nSome freed, others unlucky\n\nA county tax list details that Hellam Township, the county's first municipality, contains 16,037 acres of inhabited land, 101 dwellings, 86 barns, eight mills, seven slaves, 345 males and 320 female adults. Pennsylvania becomes the first state to outlaw slavery in 1780, but those born before that date remain enslaved. The last slave in the county, owned by the Forney family of Hanover, reportedly died in 1841.\n\n1784: York County\n\nIce flood causes havoc\n\nThe \"ice flood,\" the first of several dangerous Codorus Creek risings, damages property in its path. Water and ice rise to what one historian calls \"an extraordinary height\" before it subsides. The water damages buildings, but none are destroyed. Two years later, rain and high winds cause water to rise about 4 feet above the 1784 level. Both floods destroy all bridges over the Codorus.\n\n1784: Southern Pennsylvania\n\nApathy is nothing new\n\nVoter apathy has been an American political tradition from the beginning. Col. Thomas Hartley writes about Lancaster and York politics during a tour of the southern part of the state: \"A good many people of this county are now assembled here. ... If Lancaster and York should carry proper men at the next election, we may do well. Exertions are not wanting at York, and we are not idle at Lancaster.\" Hartley lamented the apparent apathy of area residents toward public and political life. \"In Republics, every man ought to think,\" he said. \"Time may put us right, but we are at present in the infancy of thought.\"\n\n1785: Columbia\n\nWoman earns wide respect\n\nSusanna Wright, who lived her adult life near the Lancaster Ferry landing that bore her family name, dies at the age of 88. (Some sources list 1784.) Susanna, daughter of Columbia and Wrightsville founder John Wright, displayed multiple talents. She mediated legal disputes, dispensed home remedies, farmed, tended an orchard, grew native and European plants in her garden, wrote poetry and essays, and owned an extensive multi-language library. She corresponded regularly with Benjamin Franklin and his wife, Deborah. \"An astute businesswoman, she presided over the growing domain of her family, which ultimately spread across the Susquehanna to a landing on the west bank that became Wrightsville,\" a writer noted. Her family included: John Wright Jr., her brother, who operated a tavern and inn in Wrightsville for many years. John Jr.'s daughter Susanna, and her husband, Dr. John Houston, owned land absorbed into Wrightsville. John Houston was a renowned Revolutionary War surgeon. Patience Wright, another daughter of John Wright Jr., married Revolutionary War Gen. James Ewing. The Ewings resided on Wright land in Hellam Township. Henry Howard Houston, an extended family member educated at Wrightsville schools, made a fortune in Western gold mines, Pennsylvania's oil fields and railroad interests, including several years as a director of the Pennsylvania Railroad. As for Susanna Wright, Dr. Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, once wrote of \"the famous Suzey Wright, a lady who has been celebrated above half a century for her wit, good sense and valuable improvement of mind.\"\n\n1785: York\n\nMoney shifts from landowners\n\nAn upper economic class emerges in the York area. Despite owning less land than before the Revolutionary War, an upper class feeding off mercantile interests, war heroics and public employment becomes visible. Pioneer families subdivided their land among their heirs or sold off property during the war years. With a growing merchant class, in-town property is worth more than large rural acreage. John Hay, an attorney, tops the upper strata with an assessed worth of about 1,270 pounds. James Smith and Henry Miller, Revolutionary War leaders, and Thomas Hartley, congressman, rank near the top. Between 1785 and 1790, the likes of Hay and Smith maintain or increase their wealth and are gradually joined by a handful of other townsmen, a historian observed. By 1790, the amount of land someone owned was no longer the primary indicator of wealth.\n\n1786: Manchester\n\nInsurrection starts over cow\n\nCounty residents show an early aversion to taxes by staging an insurrection over a cow. A tax collector detains Jacob Bixler's cow because the animal's owner refuses to pay an excise. On the day the cow is up for tax sale, a group of 100 armed men marches into York from Manchester. The entire town of York assembles to meet the rioters with weapons of their own. It was Godfrey King and the Manchester crowd versus such notables as Henry Miller, John Hay, John Edie and William Bailey. The two sides clash, but the invaders soon disperse. They later appear before the court and pay fines. \"It was in fact a cow-insurrection,\" a historian later wrote. \"It brought Manchester and York into a fond and loving union.\"\n\n1787: York\n\nAcademy starts proud history\n\nThe York Academy grows from a school connected to St. John's Episcopal Church. The Rev. John Andrews, earlier pastor of St. John's church, opens the school in the 1770s, and the new academy maintains its affiliation with the church until 1799. It becomes known as York County Academy after it receives a state charter and financial support. The academy entered into a teaching agreement with York Collegiate Institute in 1929, and the combination of schools formed York Junior College in 1941, eventually becoming York College of Pennsylvania in 1968. Academy graduates become county, state and national leaders. Thaddeus Stevens, who taught at the school in 1815-16, went on to fame as a voice for public education and against slavery. Edgar Fahs Smith became a noted student and teacher and, still later, provost of the University of Pennsylvania. (A middle school in the York City School District is named after Smith.) Smith was preceded in his provost's post by another scholar with academy connections. After leaving the county, John Andrews moved to Philadelphia where he gained a reputation as one of America's most capable classical scholars and ultimately the provost's position at Penn. \"(H)e shed light and interest upon almost every subject of discussion or conversation.\" a student said, \"by his general learning, by choice quotations from the ancient classics, or by instructive or amusing anecdotes, of which he had a large store treasured up in his memory.\"\n\n1787: York\n\nYork becomes first borough\n\nYork incorporates as the county's first borough, becoming part of a patchwork of small-scale municipal governments that bring elected officials close to the people -- an advantage touted to this day. Some present-day geographers believe the county's 72 independent municipal and township governments and 16 school systems foster uncontrolled sprawl, fiscal disparities and greater racial and economic segregation. Henry Miller, Revolutionary War veteran and holder of several public offices, serves as York's first chief burgess or mayor.\n\n1787: York\n\nLocal paper starts printing\n\nMatthias Bartgis and T. Roberts publish the Pennsylvania Chronicle and York Weekly Advertiser, the first newspaper printed in York since the Pennsylvania Gazette left town with the Continental Congress. The newspaper departs to Harrisburg after about two years of operation. James and John Edie and Henry Wilcocks start another paper in 1789 and name it the Pennsylvania Herald and York General Advertiser. The English-language newspaper is the only York newspaper until the German-language York Gazette begins publication in 1796.\n\n1788: York\n\nTown considered for U.S. capital\n\nIt could have been Wrightsville, D.C., or York, D.C. Congress considers the two county towns as a potential U.S. capital. At one point, U.S. Sen. William Maclay of Pennsylvania pushes for York, and Robert Morris, the state's other senator, backs Germantown, near Philadelphia. A York committee surveyed a 10-mile area around York and found: 12 public buildings, including schools and churches; 412 private dwelling houses; 2,884 inhabitants; 46 trades; 476 tradesmen; 23 stores; 18 taverns or inns; 15 boarding houses (or apartment houses); 13 merchant mills; 10 sawmills; two oil mills; two fulling mills; one iron forge; and four hemp mills. The senators' disagreement contributes to the selection of future Washington, D.C., as the site. \"An inland situation will certainly be more desirable,\" Congressman Thomas Hartley from York County argues to his colleagues in 1789. \"...I would venture to recommend the Borough of York.Ó The process shows the geographical and political importance of the Keystone State in 18th-century America.\n\n1788-89: East Berlin\n\nStudebaker builds wagons\n\nPeter Studebaker and his namesake son are listed on tax lists as wagon makers in Huntingdon Township, then part of York County. John Studebaker continued his family's line of work from 1830 to about 1836 by making Conestoga-type wagons in a shop near Heidlersburg. He then moves his family west in three wagons, including one of his own large covered wagons to the Midwest. There, he and his sons build the prairie schooners that became popular on the western plains. The Studebaker company later became a key player in the U.S. automotive industry.\n\n1789: Hanover\n\nClergyman an insect expert\n\nThe Rev. Frederick Valentine Melsheimer is qualified to tell his parishioners about the birds and the bees -- in detail and with great accuracy. The German-born pastor serves several Hanover-area congregations from 1789 to 1814. But he's known today for his interest in natural history, particularly in the field of entomology, the study of insects. He publishes a major work on the insects of Pennsylvania in 1806, a pioneering book on the subject. \"He was not a mere collector but paid considerable attention to food habit and mode of occurrence...,\" a biography states. His sons carried on his entomological interests. One son, Frederick Ernst Melsheimer, also practiced medicine in Davidsburg for decades in the 19th century. The physician became president of the American Entomological Society in 1853 and sold his collection, which included his father's work, to a Harvard University museum. The Rev. Daniel Ziegler, a minister in Kreutz Creek and York and also an avid entomologist, was a friend of Dr. Melsheimer. He added his considerable collection of insects to the Melsheimer cache. The combined collections covered 80 years of work and filled 41 wooden boxes. The collection contained 5,302 species with 14,774 specimens. Dr. Melsheimer also developed interests in astronomy and mounted a telescope in front of his Davidsburg house, where he entertained friends with views of the sun, moon and stars.\n\n1789: Peach Bottom Township\n\nRoss starts political career\n\nJames Ross, a county native, is named to the convention framing a new state constitution, one of many political positions he would hold or seek. Ross was born in 1762 in Peach Bottom Township and educated at a school connected with the Slate Ridge Presbyterian Church. Ross moves to western Pennsylvania where he spends the rest of his life, gaining prominence as one of the most able attorneys and Federalist political figures of his era. After his state constitution work, he is elected to the U.S. Senate for a term and one half and makes three unsuccessful bids for governor of Pennsylvania. York County backs its native son in his first unsuccessful gubernatorial bid in 1799. Ross wins the county by nearly 700 votes over anti-Federalist Thomas McKean. Ross loses his last bid in 1808 in an election that causes one historian to suggest that \"common people in Pennsylvania had abandoned their deferential attitude toward the rich and wellborn, and had themselves assumed the task of governing.\""
