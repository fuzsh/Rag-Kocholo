        "text": "The Staples High School field hockey team is one win away from a state championship.\n\nThe #2-seeded Wreckers dominated #3 Glastonbury yesterday, in the Class “L” (large schools) semifinal at Amity High.\n\nThe score was only 2-0 — on goals by Mary Stevens and Leah Larit — but the Westporters did not allow the Guardians any shots on goal.\n\nThe title match is this Saturday (November 18, Wethersfield High School, 11 a.m.). The Wreckers face #1-ranked Darien. The Blue Wave squeaked by Wilton, 3-2 in overtime, yesterday.\n\nDarien captured the first 2 meetings of the schools this year. They edged Staples 3-2 in overtime during the regular season, then took the FCIAC (league) championship 3-0 earlier this month.\n\nCoach Ian Tapsall’s girls are shooting for their 5th Connecticut crown. They won it all 4 years in a row, from 2016-19, but have not been back to the final since.\n\nStaples’ girls soccer team was denied a chance at their 3rd straight state championship. Seeded 3rd in “LL” (extra large schools), they fell 4-3 to their archrival, #2 St. Joseph, 4-3 at Fairfield Warde last night.\n\nThe Cadets — 2-time reigning champions in the “L” (large) division who moved up to “LL” this year, and who as a private school draw players from outside Trumbull — overcame a 2-goal deficit to win.\n\nStaples and St. Joseph tied 1-1 in the regular season — the only blemish on the Cadets’ 20-0-1 record. They took the FCIAC title over coach Barry Beattie’s Wreckers, with a nail-biting 2-1 win.\n\nUS youth national team player Natalie Chudowsky scored twice for Staples last night. Annabel Edwards added the other.\n\nThe 2023 Staples field hockey team.\n\n============================================\n\nYou may know Rex Fowler as the very talented founder of Aztec Two-Step, the folk-rock duo that, despite being “no hit wonders,” has enjoyed a devoted cult following for half a century.\n\nYou may also know Rex Fowler as a fellow Westporter. He and his wife, Dodie Pettit — an even longer resident — now comprise Aztec Two-Step 2.0.\n\nNow Rex has added another credit to his long list of achievements. “200 Cadillacs” — his new documentary featuring interviews with people who were recipients of Elvis Presley’s gift of choice (a shiny new car) will show tomorrow (Thursday, November 16, Sacred Heart Community Theatre, downtown Fairfield).\n\nA talkback with Rex — who wrote most of the music — follows the screening. It’s hosted by Susan Granger.\n\nReviewer Leonard Maltin wrote: “I like Elvis well enough, but I’m not a\n\ndevotee, and I never thought I’d find this film as compelling as I did.”\n\nTickets are just $15. Click here to order.\n\n==================================================\n\nIrwin Lebish has been a veterinarian for almost 70 years, and a member of the Westport Rotary Club for 23 years (president from 2011-’12).\n\nBut, he says, he has been playing piano “always. Area residents known him from many bands, and the Jazz Doctors trio.\n\nYesterday, he treated his fellow Rotarians to a jazz concert, with songs like “I’ll Remember April,” “Fried Pies,” “My Funny Valentine” and “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.’\n\nHe was accompanied by his son Scott on electric bass guitar.\n\nIrwin’s pre-holiday recitals are a Rotary tradition.\n\nIrwin and Scott Lebish.

Here’s one more “Westport … Naturally” foliage photo, from Longshore:\n\n(Photo/June Rose Whittaker)\n\n==================================================\n\nAnd finally … in honor of Rex Fowler’s Elvis-themed “200 Cadillacs” film (story above):\n\n(Elvis never gave “06880 a Cadillac. But our readers are welcome to contribute to this hyper-local blog. Please click here. Thank you — and viva Westport!)\n\nSmoke shops threatened to join nail salons as Westport’s most ubiquitous businesses.\n\nBut a Planning & Zoning Commission vote last night snuffed out more openings.\n\nAfter lengthy debate on the proliferation of the stores — which sell vaping and related products, and often include bright lighting — the board voted 5-2 on a text amendment to prohibit all future shops with more than 20% of the inventory or square footage devoted to smoking merchandise.\n\nDanielle Dobin, Michael Cammeyer, Neil Cohn, Paul Lebowitz and Jon Olefson were in favor of the regulation. Patrizia Zucaro and John Bolton were against it.\n\nIn addition, stores selling smoking- and vaping-related products below the 20% threshold must now secure a special permit via a special hearing. The regulation will prohibit “candy stores” from skirting the smoking rules.\n\nThe P&Z also voted to ban all neon-like signs and displays (including LED lights) that project outside stores.\n\nThe P&Z meeting was chair Danielle Dobin’s last. Earlier this month, she was elected to the Board of Finance.\n\nCurrent members — and attorney Eric Bernheim, who represented a client on a non-smoking matter — praised her for her service.\n\nThis morning, she told “06880” that she was proud to have accomplished the smoking-shop text amendment before leaving the P&Z.\n\nSavvy Smoker on Post Road East drew criticism last night, for its products, its exterior signage, and its bright interior displays.\n\n==================================================\n\n“06880” app users, and those who read our blog in an email, don’t see it.\n\nBut visitors to our website are always greeted with a “header” image of Westport.

Yet many people struggle with what to say when someone dies, making kids (and adults) feel different and alone.\n\nNovember is Children’s Grief Awareness Month. Doing its part, Westport-based non-profit Experience Camps offers concrete language tweaks everyone can use, to create a more grief-sensitive society.\n\nThey’re “flipping the script” — literally.

And both promise to be great matches.\n\nThe 2-time defending state champion girls soccer squad — ranked #3 in the CIAC “LL” (extra large schools) division — faces #2 St. Joseph at 6:30 p.m. tonight, at Fairfield Warde High.\n\nIt will be the third meeting of the year between the longtime rivals. In the regular season, they battled to a 1-1 draw. The Cadets eked out a 1-0 victory in the FCIAC (league) final.\n\nTwo hours earlier — 4:30 p.m., at Amity Regional in Woodbridge — the #2-ranked Wrecker field hockey team takes on #3 Glastonbury.\n\nThe timing is tight. But with a little luck, fans can catch at least part of each game.\n\nAnd with all their talent (and a little luck), both Staples teams will be victorious.\n\n================================================\n\nAmazon Fresh — the highly anticipated, high-tech grocery store that was supposed to replace Barnes & Noble near Little Barn, then turned into a half-finished, unopened “zombie store” — may soon sprout back to life.\n\nBisnow reports that Amazon is moving forward with expansion plans.\n\nStores will be redesigned, and add coffee and donuts. It’s a pivot away from what Bloomberg calls its “tech-heavy strategy” of the past.\n\nAmazon will redesign stores and add offerings like coffee and donuts, with an emphasis on these items instead of the tech-heavy strategy it employed in the past, according to Bloomberg.\n\n“We will have a good pipeline for next year,” Amazon Fresh worldwide vice president Claire Peters said. “What we won’t do is open stores aimlessly.”\n\nClick here for the full story.

ROAN Ventures can now apply for a site plan approval of its Hamlet at Saugatuck project.\n\nP&Z approval requires that 20% of the slips at any new marina be available for free public use, and that there be paddleboard and kayak tie-ups; design standards beyond those required for a typical special permit including maintaining the New England coastal village aesthetic reflected in the most recent renderings, and no extra height without significant public outdoor areas along the river.\n\nThe text amendment includes the rectangle between Riverside Avenue, Railroad Place, Franklin Street and Charles Street, plus land on Riverside Avenue, and the private parking lot above Luciano Park now used for boat storage.\n\nROAN envisions The Hamlet as an economic engine for residents and visitors, and a gateway to the rest of the town.

Annabel Edwards’ true hat trick — 3 straight goals — in just 6:36 at the start of the 2nd half broke open a 1-0 game yesterday. The blue-and-whites cruised to their 2nd consecutive state “LL” (extra large schools) title, and 3rd in their history, yesterday at Trinity Health Stadium in Hartford. The #3-seeded Westporters slammed #1-ranked Cheshire, 4-1.\n\nStaples finishes the season 12-6-4. The loss was the first for the Rams (21-1-1), who got their lone goal with 9 minutes remaining.\n\nEdwards’ selection as Most Valuable Player of the Match was a no-brainer.\n\nShe had plenty of help though. Natalie Chudowsky — who missed part of the season with US national U-15 team duty — scored the first goal. Her sister Evelyn assisted on 2 of Edwards’ strikes\n\nCoach Barry Beattie has built a dynasty. And it looks like it will continue: Edwards is just a sophomore. Evelyn Chudowsky is a junior. And Natalie Chudowsky is only a freshman.\n\nCongratulations to all of Staples’ newest state champs!\n\n=======================================================\n\nThe Staples girls were not the only soccer champions crowned yesterday.\n\nGreens Farms Academy captured the New England Preparatory School Athletic Council New championship yesterday in their division. The #7 Dragons handed #1-ranked Vermont Academy only their second loss of the season, in Lancaster, Massachusetts.\n\nThe match was tied 1-1 after overtime, and went to penalty kicks. Keeper Matt Maged saved 2 shots, clinching the win.\n\nIt was an equally dramatic season for coach Chris Mira’s GFA side. Ten games in, they were 4-6. They turned it around, finishing 11-7-2.\n\nMaged is one of 6 Westport players on the championship squad. Others are Jared Buckman, Aidan Spellacy, Aneesh Roy and Oscar Nelson. Andrew Salem is from Weston.\n\nCongratulations to all the Dragons!\n\n=======================================================\n\nThree ministers — an Episcopalian, a Methodist and a Congregationalist — walk into a high school auditorium to see a play about saving gamblers’ souls …\n\nNo, it’s not a joke. It happened Saturday night.\n\nJohn Betit (Christ & Holy Trinity), Heather Sinclair (United Methodist) and Alison Patton (Saugatuck Church) were all at the final performance of Staples Players’ (fantastic) production of “Guys & Dolls.”\n\nThey were not there to see whether the sisters at the Save a Soul Mission succeed. (Spoiler alert: They do.)\n\nThe pastors were there for personal — not professional — reasons. All 3 have at least 1 son or daughter in the show.\n\nAfter final bows, the clergy trio went on stage.

She was 32 years old.\n\nBorn on on Christmas Day in 1989, she grew up in Westport.\n\nShe sang in the Bedford Middle School choir, and was an altar server at Assumption Church. Throughout her life, Noelle kept her faith close to her heart. She also loved to cook.\n\nShe studied at Norwalk Community College, and planned to return to school.\n\nHer family says, “Noelle had a kind soul and a deeply loving heart. More than anything, she loved her daughters Isabella, 5, and Ella, 3. They were the lights and loves of her life. She loved her stepson, Jesus, and was proud of all he accomplished. Her family was the cornerstone of her life, but Noelle also cared for those who needed it. She gave freely of herself, of her time and energy, to help when help was needed. This generosity of spirit extend to animals. Noelle took in kittens that needed a home.”\n\nIn addition to her children Noelle is survived by her parents, David and Michellel her husband Jesus; sisters Denise and Nicole; brother Steven; nieces Michayla, Dianna, Marissa, Danniella and Briannal nephews Matthew, Tyler and Jace, and many aunts, uncles and cousins.\n\nA Mass of Christian burial is set for tomorrow (Tuesday November 22, 11 a.m., Assumption Church).\n\n=======================================================\n\nMud is as much a part of “Westport … Naturally” as anything else.\n\nJonathan Prager captured a lot of it, in this photo with an autumn sun.\n\n=======================================================\n\nAnd finally … Danny Kalb, a guitarist with the under-appreciated Blues Project band — died Saturday in Brooklyn. He was 80, and had battled cancer for 3 years.\n\nAs Mark Smollin notes in his book “The Real Rock & Roll High School,” the Blues Project first played in Westport in 1966. The setting was the Staples High School cafeteria — for the junior prom.\n\nA year later, they were booked for two 50-minute sets in the Staples auditorium. with an intermission. But when they were detained in New York — finishing up a recording session — promoter (and Staples student) Dick Sandhaus talked theier manager, Sid Bernstein (of early Beatles fame) into sending Richie Havens to open the show.\n\nAfter an hour, Havens was running out of material. So Bernstein had Jeremy Steig & the Satyrs drive up — at his own expense — to do a very long set until the Blues Project arrived.\n\nAt 11:30 the Blues Project finally took the stage. Half an hour later they were shut down, by a midnight curfew.

The Wreckers — ranked #3 in the “LL” (extra large schools) division — take on #1 Cheshire. Kickoff is 4 p.m. at Trinity Health (formerly Dillon) Stadium in Hartford.\n\nMeanwhile, you can see Staples’ future football stars in action.\n\nThe PAL 7th and 8th grade teams play for the Fairfield County Football League title tomorrow (Saturday) at Wilton High’s Fujitani Filed. Game times are 4 and 6 p.m.\n\n====================================================\n\nPeople working in the Gorham Island office building have many perks: easy parking. A quick walk to downtown shops and restaurants.\n\nAnd 2 bald eagles, hanging out in a tree overlooking the Saugatuck River.\n\nJill McGroarty sent along today’s “Westport … Naturally” photo.\n\nNow back to work Jill!\n\n======================================================\n\nAnd finally … on this day in 1493, Christopher Columbus first sighted the island now known as Puerto Rico.\n\n(Our December 3 Holiday Stroll is just one of “06880”‘s many community projects. Please click here to help support our work.)\n\nThe League of Women Voters welcomed Westport’s registrars of voters — Democrat Deb Greenberg and Republican Marie Signore — for post-election coffee yesterday, at VFW Post 399.\n\nThe registrars said that nearly 65% of eligible Westporters voted in last week’s election The statewide average was 57%.\n\nThey noted an increase in young voters, and hailed the efforts of Staples High School students — many of them not yet eligible to cast ballots — for their work at the polls.\n\n“We have amazing poll workers,” Greenberg said. “The first things we do after an election are thank them, and pay them.”\n\nConnecticut LWV president Laura Smith said that for registrars everywhere, Election Day is long, but satisfying and worthwhile.\n\nSmith also hailed the voting process in Connecticut. “It’s safe and secure,” she said. “There are so many checks and balances.”\n\nThough it may mean more work for registrars, there was praise that a ballot measure to allow the General Assembly to provide for early voting passed, by about a 60-40 margin.\n\nIf legislators approve, details like where exactly to vote, and for how long, would be ironed on. Connecticut is one of only 4 states — with Alabama, Mississippi and New Hampshire — to not provide early voting.\n\n=======================================================\n\nThe Westport Police have released arrest reports for November 9-16.\n\nSix people were detained in custody.\n\nOne had many counts: larceny, 1st degree; conspiracy to commit larceny; forgery; conspiracy to commit forgery; telephone fraud; conspiracy to commit telephone fraud; criminal impersonation; conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation; illegal use of credit card; conspiracy to commit illegal use of credit card; fraudulent use of automated teller machine; conspiracy to commit fraudulent use of automated teller machine; identity theft; conspiracy to commit identity theft. and failure to appear.\n\nAn accomplice was charged with larceny 4th degree; forgery; telephone fraud; illegal use of credit card; criminal impersonation; fraudulent use of automated teller machine; identity theft — and conspiracy to commit all those acts.\n\nThere was one arrest for identity theft; receipt of money, goods, services by illegal credit card use; larceny, 2nd degree; forgery, and criminal impersonation.\n\nOne person was arrested for possession of controlled substance (narcotics); drug paraphernalia; tampering with or fabricating physical evidence, and interfering with an officer/simple assault.\n\nOne person was charged with 2 counts of both larceny, 6th degree, and conspiracy to commit a crime.\n\nOne person was charged with violation of a restraining order (threatening).\n\nThe following citations were issued:\n\nTraveling unreasonably fast: 9 citations\n\nOperating an unregistered motor vehicle: 4\n\nStop signal violation: 2\n\nInsurance fails to meet minimum requirements: 2\n\nFailure to grant right of way; 1\n\nStop sign violation: 1\n\nFailure to obey control signal: 1\n\nFailure to keep plates readable: 1\n\nImproper passing: 1\n\nSimple trespass: 1\n\nPublic disturbance: 1\n\nBreach of peace: 1.\n\n=======================================================\n\nArline Gertzoff was a proud 1964 Staples High School graduate.

Built in 1806, the magnificent 7-bedroom home on 2.63 acres has been the site of a decades-long series of events, bringing together creative people from the worlds of music, art, dance, design, food and more.\n\nThe Post recounts some of Beechwood’s history too, from visits by Abraham Lincoln, George Washington and Frederick Law Olmsted (and possibly Buffalo Bill and Rock Hudson).\n\nClick here for the full New York Post story.

Staples was ranked 3rd in the state “LL” (extra large school) tournament. The Titans were 2nd.\n\nThis Saturday or Sunday (day and time TBD) at Trinity Health (formerly Dillon) Stadium in Hartford, coach Barry Beattie’s squad will face top-rated Cheshire. They edged Ridgefield 2-1 in the other semifinal.\n\nLast year the Wreckers and Ridgefield shared the title, after tying 0-0 through 80 minutes of regulation play, and 30 minutes of overtime.\n\nThis year, one team will definitely win. State tourney rules have been changed, adding penalty kicks to decide a winner instead of co-champions.\n\nIn other Staples sports news, sophomore Annam Olasewere broke 2 state records in the girls swimming state meet.\n\nHer 1:47.86 finish at 200 meters smashed a 17-year-old mark. Annam then busted her own record by .26 seconds in the 100 freestyle with a 49.88 time.\n\nOverall, the Wreckers finished 5th, with 431 points. Ridgefield won the team title, with 761.\n\n======================================================\n\nGreens Farms Academy’s new theater director Kellie Comer is getting ready for her first musical there.\n\nThe Upper School’s “The Lightning Thief” opens tonight (Thursday, 7:30 p.m.).

Click here to read more about the show, and its director.\n\n==================================================\n\nFitness studios are not often known for the art on their walls. But TAP Strength is not your average health-and-wellness spot.\n\nThe downtown space was filled last night for an art show. Miggs Burroughs, Bonnie Edelman and Alex Silver displayed their work.\n\nToday at TAP, it’s back to working out.\n\n=====================================================\n\nAlso last night: The Conservative Synagogue‘s Rabbi Jeremy Wiederhorn and his wife Riki were feted by the New York Board of Rabbis. The couple received a 2022 Humanitarian of the Year Award, at the Pierre Hotel.\n\nA former president of the board, Rabbi Wiederhorn’s most recent humanitarian effort was delivering clothing, food and other aid to Ukrainian refugees in Poland, in the early days of Ukraine’s war with Russia.\n\nThe rabbi and his wife were in good company last night. Former US Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer received the same Humanitarian of the Year honor.\n\n======================================================\n\nNeither Matt Murray nor I know what kind of bird this is.\n\nBut we’re sure “06880” readers can identify today’s “Westport … Naturally” image, taken on Hillspoint Road.\n\n======================================================\n\nAnd finally … in honor of today’s Great American Smokeout:\n\n(If you enjoy our daily Roundup, please consider contributing to “06880.” Click here to help.)\n\nThe Parks & Rec Department has held open houses on its Longshore Capital Improvement Plan. Residents weighed in — pro and con.\n\nNow there’s another way to provide feedback. They’ve posted a survey on the project website, along with all the concepts already presented. It’s open through November 9.\n\nClick here to take the survey. Be sure you have some time — it’s comprehensive.\n\nThe full project website is available at Stantec Longshore Club Park.\n\n======================================================\n\nA new, revised leaf blower ordinance got its first reading at last night’s Representative Town Meeting.\n\nBecause there are a number of changes from the original proposal — including the elimination of fines — there was no vote. After new committee hearings, the ordinance may be voted on in January.\n\nClick here to read the full proposal.\n\n====================================================\n\nActor/director/Weston resident Jim Naughton writes:\n\n“State Senator Will Haskell has told me that when he visited senior centers in several of the towns in his 26th District, he found that ‘Medical Aid in Dying’ was the bill they most wanted passed.\n\n“This did not surprise to me. When my wife Pamela, having battled pancreatic cancer for 4 years, got to the end of her journey, she said to me, ‘Jimmy, I don’t want to wake up anymore.’ If Connecticut had made it available to her then, she would have used it.\n\n“Also known as ‘Death With Dignity,’ the law has been adopted in 10 states and the District of Columbia. It came within one vote of making it out of the Connecticut Legislature’s Judiciary Committee last spring. A Gallup poll determined that 75% of Connecticut residents want it.\n\n“I urge our neighbors to know where the candidates stand on the issue before voting next week. It will be revisited in the next session.”\n\n======================================================\n\nEarth Animal cares about pets — and the humans who love them.\n\nFor the 15th straight year, they’re participating in the Mitten Project, for Connecticut Food Share. Last year, they raised over $40,000. This year — with increased need for help — the goal is $45,000.\n\nFroom now through December 31, people can buy “mittens” at the store (and others in the area).

A late Cardinal goal ruined Cami Kolek’s shutout bid.\n\nThe Wreckers — defending state and FCIAC champs — look to add another league title in tomorrow’s championship match against longtime rival St. Joseph (Thursday, November 3, 7 p.m., Wilton High School’s Kristine Lilly Field).\n\nThe Wreckers are ranked 3rd in the tourney. The Cadets are first. St. Joseph won the teams’ regular season match 2-1, less than 2 weeks ago.\n\n======================================================\n\nCongratulations too to the Staples field hockey team!\n\nThey also play for an FCIAC championship tomorrow (Thursday, 7 p.m., Brien McMahon High School).\n\nThe #3-seeded Wreckers topped #2 Wilton 3-1 last night. Their opponents tomorrow are top-rated Darien. Staples will seek to avenge a 3-0 loss to the Blue Wave earlier this year.\n\n=======================================================\n\nStacie Curran writes:\n\n“Without much fanfare, a new stop sign appeared at the intersection of Greens Farms Road and Bulkley Avenue South.\n\n“It seems that no one is observing it. Waze and other apps direct traffic this way when I-95 get congested- The morning (race car) commuters are in their zone, and blissfully unaware of this change.\n\n“Without some police presence (or the addition of a stop sign 🛑 to map-apps), this interaction is actually more dangerous now.”\n\n======================================================\n\nYesterday was the day after Halloween — November 1.\n\nTime to put up the Christmas lights!\n\nThis was the scene on Hillspoint Road. One homeowner — well, the landscaping crew — was already hard at work.\n\nYou’ll have an extra hour to see them twinkle soon. Daylight Savings ends on Sunday.\n\n======================================================\n\nMichael Chait has a large and well-deserved following for his original photographs, which he blends with aspects of paint technique. He is particularly fond of photographing Westport and New York City.\n\nHis work has been exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, Museum of Natural History and the permanent collection of the Brooklyn Museum.\n\nNow — just in time for the holidays — he’s got a new website. Click here to explore.\n\n=======================================================\n\nFolk and other music lovers know Voices Café — tucked inside Westport’s Unitarian Church — is a hidden gem.\n\nNow kids can enjoy it too.\n\nA special Voices youngsters’ event brings Dan and Claudia Zanes back to Westport this Saturday (November 5, 4 p.m.).

High on the list this time of year: the view from the river.\n\nRachel Halperin stopped long enough from her workout to snap today’s “Westport … Naturally” shot.\n\n=======================================================\n\nAnd finally … Happy 2nd Day of the Dead!\n\n======================================================= (On this Day of the Dead, help keep “06880” alive. Please click here to support your hyper-local blog.)\n\n=======================================================\n\nYesterday’s “06880” lead story yesterday celebrated the works of members of 4 Westport synagogues. They’ll be honored December 12 by the Federation for Jewish Philanthropy of Upper Fairfield County, as part of their annual “Mitzvah Heroes” celebration.\n\nBut there’s a 5th Westporter too — from Congregation Beth El in Norwalk.\n\nStephanie Gordon has been a shul leader since 2007. A lawyer professionally, she focuses her volunteerism in 2 areas: working toward “tikkun olam” (repairing the world), and improving her congregation\n\nCommittee work at Beth El includes Membership, vice president for Education and Fundraising, and the Board of Trustees and Executive Committee. But she’s hands-on too, from decorating the sukkah to greeting congregants on Shabbat.\n\nFor years Stephanie was part of Norwalk Open Doors’ shelter and kitchen crew. She then stepped up to lead. The pandemic notwithstanding, Stephanie continues to plan healthy menus, shops, recruits volunteers, and leads meal prep and service.\n\n======================================================\n\nThis winter could be one of the most expensive on record. That’s scary news for neighbors who already have trouble heating their homes.\n\nThe Westport Warm-Up Fund can help.\n\nThe initiative helps hundreds of Westporters with home heating expenses — thanks to others who donate.\n\nTax-deductible contributions can be made online (click here) or by mail: Westport Warm-Up Fund, Department of Human Services, Westport Town Hall, 110 Myrtle Avenue, Westport CT 06880.\n\nFor more information — or to request help — call 203-341-1050, or email humansrv@westportct.gov.\n\n=======================================================\n\nGaby Gonzalez — the state champion Staples High School girls soccer star — has been named to the All-New England team.\n\nNext fall, Gaby will play at Cornell University. It’s familiar territory: both her older sister Mia and father Jack played for the Big Red.\n\nCongratulations, Gaby!\n\n=======================================================\n\nHuman beings are not the only living things in Westport enjoying holiday decorations.\n\nChickens in this Hillspoint Road coop do too.\n\nThey also are happy that chicken is not a traditional Christmas meal.\n\n=======================================================\n\nLate-autumn Compo Beach reeds frame today’s “Westport … Naturally” feature:\n\n=======================================================\n\nAnd finally … on this day in 1988, Roy Orbison played his final concert. The country singer with an astonishing, angelic, operatic voice — who had a 2nd career with the Traveling Wilburys — died of heart failure 2 days later, at 52.\n\n======================================================\n\nDowntown is all about holiday shopping.\n\nBut it’s about helping others too.\n\nThis season, the Westport Downtown Association will install a dozen beautiful, colorful trees throughout the area.\n\nEach will be decorated by professional designers. Each will also be themed to a different local non-profit.\n\nThe organizations include Filling in the Blanks, Wakeman Town Farm, Westport Young Woman’s League, Westport Fire Department, Homes with Hope, Christ & Holy Trinity Church, Aware, CLASP Homes, Westport PAL, Westport Bookstore, and MoCA Westport.\n\nThe WDA asks residents to help fund trees, lights and decorations.

The Wreckers and Wilton battled through 80 minutes of excellent soccer, and 30 more of overtime, before both were declared Connecticut LL (extra large schools) winners.\n\nThe defensive battle was a worthy final, between teams that knew each other well. Staples shut out the Warriors 1-0 for the league crown, after beating them by the same score in the regular season.\n\nCongratulations to coach Barry Beattie and his staff, and a wonderful group of talented, tenacious athletes!\n\n=======================================================\n\nStaples is not coach Barry Beattie’s only championship team this fall. His Westport Soccer Association U-15 Blue squad also tied for their league title. Congratulations (again) to him, and of course to his players!\n\n=======================================================\n\nSpeaking (still) of sports: The Joggers Club hosts its first-ever Turkey Burn on Saturday (November 27, 8 a.m., Compo Beach).\n\nOn tap: 5K, 10K and 15K runs, along with hot coffee, treats, and finish line music. “Celebrate the holidays with your most festive running outfit,” they say.\n\nRegular Compo Beach runs are Saturdays at 8 a.m., and Wednesday nights at the Staples High School track (6:15 p.m.).\n\nClick here for more information, or follow on Instagram: @TheJoggersClub.ct.\n\n=======================================================\n\nStaples Players is back!\n\n“Grease” — their first full mainstage musical since the pandemic — played to 2 weeks of sold-out audiences. Choreography, music, sets, lighting — all were up to the award-winning high school troupe’s always high standards.\n\nCongratulations to directors David Roth and Kerry Long, the cast and crew. Stay tuned for news about the spring show!\n\n=======================================================\n\nGreens Farms is filled with “Westport … Naturally” photo opportunities. Here’s Ron Henkin’s submission.\n\n=======================================================\n\nAnd finally … we have a two-fer for today in history. On this date in 1877, Thomas Edison announced his invention of the phonograph …\n\n… while — somewhat related — on this day in 1959, disc jockey Alan Freed — who helped popularize the term “rock ‘n’ roll” — was fired from WABC radio in New York. He was alleged to have been part of the payola scandal."
