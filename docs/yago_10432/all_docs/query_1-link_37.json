THE W ESTERN STATES— ILLINOIS, ( 2 d a e t i c l e .) [We dow resume the publication of a series of papers, under the same general title prefixed to the present article, written expressly for the Merchants’ Maga­ zine, by T homas P rentice K ettell, Esq., of New York, now and for several years editor of the U. S. Economist, previously of the Democratic Renew, etc., whose ability, industry, and research, are fully evinced by these and other con­ tributions to the history of the finances of the United States. As we have here­ tofore stated, these articles contain the most comprehensive and reliable account of the debts, finances, and resources of the several States, that have ever been collected in a connected and convenient form, and are most valuable for reference, present and future. The first was of an introductory and general character, and related chiefly to the State debts of Europe and America, but also presented particular statistics of the debts of Great Britain, Prance, and the Federal Gov­ ernment of the United States. The second commenced the account of the in­ debted States respectively. For convenience of reference, we give the subjoined index to the series, showing the volumes, pages, etc., in which each previous number was published:— Nos. i State debts of Europe and America........... 2.

It will be noticed that the present article and the last in the above list are alike devoted to the State of Illinois. However, the paper now published chiefly consists of statistics of recent years, and hence not embraced in the preceding paper; and whatever portion of the history of the State is reproduced we deem desirable to a satisfactory view of the subject. We would also refer those who may wish to consult our other articles on State debts to the number of the Merchants' Magazine of May, 1857, Vol. xxxvii., pp. 531-517, in which we published the most recent financial accounts of seventeen States, with lists of references to all our previous articles in regard to those States. We shall hereafter publish a similar resume of the financial accounts of most of the States made up for the last fiscal year preceding January 1, 1858, with further lists of references.*— E d. M er. M ag.] T he great State of Illinois is one o f the most remarkable in the Union in regard to its financial history, since with great natural resources it has undergone the greatest vicissitudes. Under the influence o f over­ wrought credit it was brought to insolvency, from which it has vigorously recovered, until it has become one of the most prosperous, if not, in fact, the most prosperous, of the Union in respect of its finances. The soil o f the State is of the most fertile description, and its situation such as a glance at the map demonstrates to be the most favorable to commerce. It is, as it were, the counterpart of New York, since, like it, it abuts on the great lakes on one side, while on the other it is watered by the largest rivers. In size, Illinois ranks as one of the largest States of the Union, having an area of 55,410 square miles, or 35,462,389 acres. The general disposition of this land by the Federal Government has been as follows :— .................acres 1,001,795 9,060,330 48,989 2,560 311,484 1,833,413 590,915 2,595,000 20,317,903 Area.......................

In 1814, the sales of land under the General Government commenced, and they had been annually as follows, do.wn to the close of the last fiscal year:— ACRES LAND SOLD ANNUALLY IN ILLINOIS. ’1R14 1815.............. 1 8 1 6 ............. . . 18 17.............. 1818.............. 1819.............. 1820..............

The first sales were mostly on the streams and shores, and were but moderate in amount up to 1830, but were then largely developed under the speculations of succeeding years, until the great revulsion of 1837. The efforts then made at reviving the public works and the growing im ­ migration from Europe, sustained the demand for lands until nearly all those available in the hands o f the Federal Government were sold. In 1850, the government still held about 11,000,000 acres of superior lands, which were situated in the interior o f the State, but unavailable because not commanded by any water courses. A t that time it made a grant of 2.595.000 acres to the State of Illinois, to assist in building the Central Railroad. The State made over the grant to a company which under­ took and completed this work, the effect of which has been to enable the government to sell all its remaining lands in the State o f Illinois, and develop a high degree of prosperity in that region. The State of Illinois, as we have said, is bounded on the northeast by Lake Michigan, on the shore of which is situated the growing city of Chicago. A t one hundred miles distant, in a westerly direction, the Illinois River becomes navigable, and, draining a most fertile region, pours into the Mississippi above the Ohio River, forming an outlet for produce to the ocean via New Orleans. The State of New York, in 1822, conceived the plan of connecting Lake Erie, 350 miles, with the Hudson River by canal, and the situation of Illinois obviously prompted a similar undertaking. Hence, as early as 1823, a board o f commissioners was ap­ pointed to explore the route, and estimate the cost o f the Illinois and Michigan Canal, 100 miles long. At that time the population of the State was less than 100,000, mostlv without other connection with markets than via New Orleans; with so little resource, therefore, but little was done until the general speculative action in lands commenced in 1830. In 1829, Congres had granted 500,000 acres o f land in aid of the work, the whole cost of which was then estimated at $8,654,337. The work progressed, and there was realized from the land sales up to 1836, $1,395,911, at which time 270.000 acres remained on hand. A t that time, under the spur o f specu­ lation, which pervaded the whole Union, Illinois embarked largely in banks and internal improvements. It issued $3,000,000 o f bonds for the capital o f banks, the State Bank of Illinois and the Illinois Bank at Shawueetown. It also issued $10,250,000 of bonds for a grand railroad system, of which the Central Road was to divide the State longitudinally, 278 Debts and Finances o f the States o f the Union. and others, to cross the State east and west. The general speculation in lands received a new impulse from these loans and the prospect o f the expenditure which they would involve. The banks largely expanded their loans, mostly in discounts to produce speculators. The State ne­ gotiated its bonds at great disadvantage, mostly through the United States Bank, in exchange for its notes, and through agents, who failed in debt to it. The chief works undertaken by the State, were the canal, esti­ mated to cost $8,654,337; the Central Railroad, estimated to cost $3,500,000; the Southern Cross Road, estimated at $1,750,000; the Alton and Terre Haute Road, $1,250,000 ; the Northern Cross, $1,850,000; and the Warsaw and Bloomington Road, $1,050,000. The expenditure on these works, with the $2,000,000 subscription to the State Bank of Illinois, and $1,400,000 to the Illinois Bank o f Shawneetown, formed a State debt of $11,600,000, at the time the great revulsion overtook the commercial world, leaving the State in a deplorable condition. The population was than under 500,000; the public works were all stopped in an unfinished state; the annual expenditure upon them had been one source of prosperity to the people, aided by the operations o f the two great banks, whose movement had been as follow s:— Capital. 1835 1836 1837 1838 1839 ................................. ................................. ....................................... ....................................... ...................................... $228,789 1,904,550 2,371,840 5,179,200 5,435,050 Loans.

The government was without revenue, and the Governor, in his message, called attention to the fact, that there was not sufficient means at the command o f the executive to procure letters from the Post office, or hold evening sessions of the Legis­ lature. In July, 1841, the State o f Illinois stopped payment on the interest on her public debt. In that year the whole State revenue had been $103,065, and the expenses $179,807 ; for eight years the revenue had been $739,304, and the expenses $1,016,281— excess o f expenses $276,977. The State had emitted various species o f paper which had become much depreciated, and which, being receivable for public dues, deprived it of all available means. The amount of debt reported by the Governor was, in 1844, as follow s:— Canal debt, principal....................................................... “ interest............................................................... $4,741,788 1,148,581 ----------------------------------------- $5,890,364 Internal improvement, including bank deb t..................... 6,712,866 “ “ “ “ interest.. 1,837,151 ---------------------------------------8,550,011 Total debt......................................................... $14,440,381 The canal resources were as follow s:— Amount expended upon the canal, 1836 to 1844, $5,039,284. The canal property was valued as follow s:— 279 Illinois. 230,476 acres of canal land valued $10 per acre ................... 370 lots in Chicago...................................................... valued at 679 “ Lockport........................................................................ 914 “ Ottawa.......................................................................... 1,628 “ L a S a lle......................... 491 “ Joliet and Du Page.....................................................

When that should have been accomplished, to sell the lands necessarily enhanced in value by its operation, and pay— 1st. The prin­ cipal of that debt and interest until fully paid ; 2d.

When that payment shall have been completed the trust terminates. Without going here into the detail of the movement, we may state that it was success­ fully carried out, the work completed, and the lands gradually sold, pro­ ducing a result contained in the following extract from the report o f the trustees, January, 1858. The following table contains a classified schedule o f the entire amount received and expended by the Board of Trustees from the date of the trust in June, 1845, to November 30, 1857 :— Classification.

There remains unsold o f the lands 54,573 acres, and 965 town lots. Thus the estimated value o f the lands has been more than attained. The canal has been finished; the “ new loan” is paid off, principal and interest; interest on registered bonds and scrip paid up to the extent of $2,142,288, and $278,357 o f the principal dis­ charged. The mode o f selling the lands is one-fourth cash, and the balance in three equal annual instalments. There is due o f these instalments $252,195, and the trustees estimate that they will pay this year $350,000 on the principal of the registered bonds. This branch of the State debt has been thus disposed o.f. The financial evils which the State had suffered produced political action upon the State 280 Debts and Finances o f the States o f the Union. Constitution. Accordingly, a new Constitution o f tlie State, which was adopted by the people in 1848, the fifteenth article o f which provides that there shall he annually levied and collected a tax o f two mills, which tax so collected, shall, annually, on the first day of January of each year, be paid pro rata upon the principal of such o f the bonds of the State, other than canal bonds, which shall be presented on that day for the pur­ pose. In addition a tax of 1J- mills was levied to pay the interest on the public debt. The operation of the 2 mill tax has been very successful. In 1849, it reached $210,805; in 1850, $241,100 ; and in 1851,1275,637. In the last three years the amount of bonds presented, January 1st, and the amount paid from the 2 mill tax, has been as follows:— January, 1856 “ 1857 “ 1858 Bonds pres’d. Paid from 2 mill tax. $1,800,000 1,269,423 1,176,420 $480,000 623,000 629,480 Thus, the amount presented declines, while the fund increases. Many holders have manifested a disinclination to receive this dividend upon the principal. Some for the reason that it makes each bond fractional, and some because they believe the securities will be ultimately paid in full, with full interest, and that consequently they are a good investment, and they prefer to hold them for full payment at maturity. Thus, those two branches of debt have been provided for— the canal debt by the operation of that work, and the improvement debt by the operation of the 2 mill tax for principal, and the mill tax for interest. The State had, besides the canal lands, 252,000 acres, derived from the Federal Government for other purposes, and had also the Springfield and Meredosia Railroad in operation 56 miles. It had also the partly con­ structed Central Railroad, running from Cairo, the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi, north 50 miles to Centralia, where it forks, one branch running thence easterly to Chicago, and the other continuing north to Dunleitb, on the Mississippi. In this work the State had expended $3,000,000 for construction when it failed. The rich lauds in the interior o f the State were not readily purchased because they weie not accessible to market. The United States government held 11,000,000 acres in that region which had vainly sought buyers during 20 years. To make that land available the railroad was indispensable. The land districts of Illi­ nois, through which the Central Road runs, had all been surveyed and been under proclamation an average of 15 years, some o f the land 30 years— that is to say, in all that time any o f the land could have been entered at the government minimum price of $1 25 per acre. The fol­ lowing quantities in each district, within five miles o f the Central Road, were without buyers :— Kaskaskia, not sold, over 30 years on m arket................. acres Shawneetown, “ 30 years on market...........................

If the Federal Government could not sell it, how could the 281 Illinois. State sell it ? Squatters would not go into it because, even with the prospect of a pre-emption law in their favor, the lands were so secluded from market that there was but little prospectof meeting ultimate payments. The Federal Government had granted at different times to 13 Western and Southwestern States 12,061,000 acres of the land situated within their respective borders, for purposes of internal improvement; and as far as those lands were available, they have been sold and appropriated to important works. In pursuance of this general policy, the government granted to Alabama, to Michigan, and to Illinois, land equal to about 3,240 acres per mile, for tbe construction of the railroad through Illinois to Mobile. This grant was made to the States respectively. Our former article on the debt and finances o f Illinois embraced a synopsis of the act making this grant, which was approved September 30, 1850. See Merchants' Magazine, of December, 1852, vol. xxvii., pp. 665-6. It is very clear that if this land, which had so long been valueless, should become the means of selling the remainder, it would be well be­ stowed. The Government gave up one-half to make the other valuable. The State could not build the road itself. It had tried once, and failed. But it was of great importance to the State that the lands should pass into the hands of settlers and become taxable. Accordingly, the State passed, February 10th, 1851, a law, o f which a full synopsis was given in the Merchants' Magazine of December, 1852, vol. xxvii., pp. 666-7. On the 22d of March, 1851, the company, by its president, accepted the act. On the same day the Treasurer of the State of Illinois signed a receipt for $200,000 in specie. On the 24th of March the Governor exe­ cuted the deed of “ all the lands granted by the Goverment of the United States to the State of Illinois; also, the lot o f ground obtained by the State of Illinois within the city Cairo, for a depot; also, the right of way, grading, embankments, excavations, survey, work, materials, profiles, plates, and papers, in anywise appertaining to said railroad and branches.” On the day of the execution o f this deed, the company, by its presi­ dent, executed a deed of trust to Morris Ketehum, John Moore, and Samuel D. Lockwood, o f the above property, and in addition, the roads that may be built to secure the objects mentioned in section fifteen of the act of the State of Illinois. Congress having donated six sections, o f 640 acres each, on each side of the road,-it follows that the grant is 3,840 acres per mile. The final location of the road determined its length at 676 miles, consequently the aggregate grant is 2,505,800 acres. For that land, patents were issued from the Land-office to the company, and under the trust, these lands were appropriated, and classed, as follows, to secure construction bonds :— $ 6 ..................... 10..................... 15..................... 2 5 ..................... 82,406,000 12,000,000 4.500,n00 2,500,000 2,000,000 acres, to secure construction bonds...................... 250.000 “ in aid of interest fund, at $10..................... 845.000 “ contingent fund, at 10..................... $21,400,000 2,500,000 8,450,000 2,595,000 acres, average present value................................ $27,350,000 400.000 acres, inferior farm lands, at 1,200,000 “ good “ at 300.000 “ superior “ at 100.000 “ town sites, coal beds, &c., at The amount o f construction bonds issued, not over $17,000,000, and 282 Debts and Finances o f the States o f the Union. the works erected by their expenditure, are additional security for their payment. The 2,000,000 acres of land being devoted to the payment of the prin­ cipal of the bonds, the interest is secured by 250,000 acres set apart for that purpose, the net income o f the road, and the capital stock, since it was estimated that the 817,000,000 o f bonds would suffice to construct the road, and there remained 345,000 acres at the disposal of the company. The provisions of the charter were complied with, and on the finishing o f the first 50 miles o f road, the 8200,000 was returned to the company. The capital of the company was fixed at 817,000,000— 177,000 shares of $100 each ; on this was assessed the 8200,000 deposited with the State Treasurer. O f the whole number of shares there had been issued np to March, 1857, 140,347; on the most of which, 840 per share has been assessed. It was then proposed to increase the number of shares to 255,000, making the nominal capital 825,000,000. The new shares were distributed among the old stockholders. The unissued shares of the capital stock, 29,653, were held to cover optional rights to subscribe conferred upon takers of the free land loan. The bonds issued by the company, on security of the 2,000,000 acres and the road itself, were made payable in 1875; of the whole issue (817,000,000) 84,115,000 b e a r six per cent interest, and $12,885,000 bear seven per cent interest. The amount realized for these, was 814,798,944 ; the company retains 8026,500 on hand. On the expenditure of these bonds, the company made anew loan of 83,000,000 secured upon the unappropriated 345,000 acres, as above. These bonds issued at seventy, realized * 2,079,876 61.

On the purchase of the land, the buyer receives a contract for a deed, and pays two years’ interest on the amount at three per cent per annum cash. The principal is paid in four annual instalments. The first two years from the date of his contract, to each annual payment is added one year's interest in advance on the balance of payments. It is agreed, also, that at least one-tenth of the purchase shall be fenced and cultivated each year, so that one-half shall be improved when the last note is due. Thus, if 160 acres are purchased, at an average of 810, the whole pay­ ments in six years amount to $1,792. On the completion of the last payment, one-half the land being under cultivation, the buyer receives a full deed o f the land from the trustees, who are bound to appropriate the proceeds of payments, each year, to the cancelment of the bonds. The sales have been rapid up to January, 1857. They were as follows :— 283 Illinois. Total principal. Total acres sold. 659,136 09 acres coustruct'n.

It is to be observed that some $2,000,000 of bonds have been actually canceled from the cash payments— the first notes not having yet matured. This mode of selling lands, not only places the company in funds to make annual purchases of bonds, but by settling the lands it furnishes freight and traffic to the road. The lands of the company lie along its route 700 miles through one of the richest countries in the world. Its position, being soutli of Michigan and Wisconsin, insures to it a better and softer climate, of which the farmer feels practically the benefit, in shortening by a month the season for fod­ dering cattle, and in the security of the corn crops from those frosts, which, borne on the winds that sweep the lakes, so often ‘‘ kill o u t” the harvests of the Northern States. The broad and rich prairie lands afford advantages which the settlers in the wooded districts of other States do not appreciate, and which, indeed, are not brought out fully without the operation of internal works of improvement, which supply all that nature lias withheld. It is seldom that any spot of land contains all the gifts of Providence. It is there that she has spread, as a lawn, the richest lands, charged with more fuel and water than almost any other section. Her streams flow gently through the rich alluvion, and Mr. Charles Lyell states:— “ There is more good bituminous coal in Illinois than in England, and it is far more easily mined and laid out ready for transit than there.” There is an absence of timber, which has been considered by immigrants a drawback. Experience has, however, shown the contrary. Those who have settled the timbered lands o f Ohio and Pennsylvania, can testify to the weary life-time o f labor required to clear those tracts of stumps, and to wrench from the frowning forest the breadth o f a good farm for culti­ vation. From this it will be observed that timber is the great nuisance upon fresh land, beyond what is wanted for posts, rails, and buildings. Now, all the head waters of the Mississippi and the Missouri command limitless timber lands. From the falls of St. Anthony alone, more timber can be 284 Debts and Finances o f the States o f the Union. delivered than would supply an empire. That timber rafted to Cairo, will supply— over tne great Central Road, which, running north one hun­ dred and seventeen miles, then forks, and traverses the whole State in two lines, in a convenient form, all the wants of the farmer, far cheaper than they could cut it themselves, without leaving a stump in their way. The same railroad which brings their timber carries away their produce. Those lands owned by the company, and all selected from the best in the State for farming purposes, are equal, in extent, to the whole State o f Connecticut, and are hourly improving, in value, through the increasing population in a juvenile State, where the only land now in first hands, is that held by the company. Each new settler not only pays more than the face of the bonds on taking possession, but he commences an operation which insures to the road business for all future time. The inexhaustible supplies of coal not only insure to the company the cheapest fuel for working their engines, a number of which, driven by coal, being already in operation, but ensures an ample supply of fuel through the whole region. Under these circumstances, it is certain that one-half the com­ pany lands being sold for a sum equal to three-fourths the whole cost of the work, the remaining portion in view o f the daily enhancing value of land in that region, will amply meet the remaining acquirements. Thus, the cost of the road, as above, was $23,100,339. The sales o f lands to September 1st, 1857, were as follow s:— To January, 1857...................... January to September, 1857...

The great prosperity with which the State of Illinois has been endowed, from the operation o f the canal and the Central Railroad, has been enhanc­ ed by the other railroads in operation in the State, reacts reciprocally upon the works which had produced it, and at this moment the demand for land in that region is very active. The population of the interior has increased at a very rapid rate along the line of the railroads. Thus, that of the thirteen counties through which the Galena and Chicago Railroad runs due west, was as follows :— 1840, 46,992; in 1850, 178,417; in 1855, 297,974— that is to say, one-fourth o f the whole increase in the one hundred counties o f the State, during five years, was in these thirteen counties. The Central Railroad has been operating less than two years, yet the concentration of population upon its line is greater than the large one indicated above. If wo take six counties on the Chicago branch, in the heart of the State, we may ob­ serve the increase:— POPULATION OF SIX INTERNAL COUNTIES. 1X40. 1845. 1850.

Thus the population in those counties has more than doubled in the last five years, and has only within a short time had an outlet to market over the Central Railroad, and this outlet is all that is required. Fuel, brick, clay, and limestone, abound in all the region, and the railroad, as it were, puts those necessaries into circulation. It follows that land has rapidly risen in those counties. The progress o f the State, may, in some degree, be illustrated as follows :— Population. 1840........................... 1845........................... 18 50............. ............ 1855...........................

Although its old chartered banks went out of existence in the collapse of 1839—40, the state adopted a general banking law similar to that of the State of New York, under which its banking operation has progressed as follows:— No. b’ks.

The capital-is entirely invested in stocks, which are pledged with the State officer for circulating notes. These notes are loaned in various ways. The revenue o f the State o f Illinois being now abundant for all its wants, its lands in process o f rapid settlement, having a good provision o f railroads, and its debt diminishing under the operation o f adequate funds, its future is one o f bright promise, and the public works within its borders will partake in its growing prosperity. Art. 11.— MONEY AND BANKING* To F k e e m a n H unt , Editor o f the Merchants' Magazine : — D ear S ir :— It is sometimes refreshing and satisfactory, for the pioneer o f a reformatory movement, to look back and to count the steps that he has gained, in the slow, but onward progress of his cause. Most reforms move slowly at first, but if they are founded in truth, their final triumph is certain. It is now nearly five years since I had the honor to contribute an article, relating to this subject, to the Merchants' Magazine, but since that time it has been discussed from every point by many able and in­ telligent writers, so “ that he that runs may read.” It is true, none have advocated exactly the same doctrines as myself, but still progress has been made, in the acknowledgement, by more than one writer, of the important principle of depredation ; the marvel is, that its tendency and effect had never before been perceived. The currency is now no longer a mystery, but a matter that all may understand who will take the trouble to read the Merchants' Magazine. I have been led into these desultory remarks from a casual glance over your pages upon this subject, since I last wrote ; congratulating myself, as a party concerned in.the warfare, upon the per­ ceptible progress we have made. I must now attend to the subject, and shall endeavor to discuss some points which may have escaped the notice of others. The credit and banking system, within the last few years, has been spreading all over Europe— France, Russia, and Germany; and, in fact, every other country has been extending its trading and monetary institu­ tions. The late crisis has consequently been more extensive and severe than usual, and its circling wave may be longer before it reaches its final destination. England appears to have suffered as much, or more, than any other nation, notwithstanding the bank monopoly and the large amount of specie in her currency. The evil lies in the unlimited increase o f money, and can never be eradicated under the present system of cur­ rency. It matters little whether the increase be in gold or in paper. In the case o f England the limited amount o f paper in her currency did not save her from difficult}^ The deposit system, which like the issue of bank notes, operates to pile debt upon debt, with every new loan increasing prices, and, o f course, expelling the precious metals by depreciation; leaving nothing behind but a stupendous mass o f obligations that can * Previous articles will be found in vol. 29, page 577; vol. 81, page 188; vol. 83, page 541; vol. 34, page 185. M oney and Banking. 287 never be discharged, but at last topples down, overwhelming alike the reckless and prudent, the honest and dishonest, in one common ruin. .And yet, notwithstanding, it is said that some o f the English banks that have done an extensive business upon deposits are prosperous; but that remains to be seen. The Western Bank o f Scotland had only seven millions of deposits, and she has sunk to rise no more, and many others of less note will be found in the same category. Some of them had sus­ tained no run, but have fallen from their own insanity— the inconverti­ bility of their own and customers’ investments, or in other words, the im­ possibility of obtaining the same amount in cash for them, which had been paid in credit. Thus, the system defeats itself—swallows up prin­ ciple and interest, and causes just the same kind of evils as an unlimited issue of paper— stops the wheels o f honest industry, produces frauds, bubble companies, and accommodation paper, and every other meanness that combined selfishness and necessity can descend to. Therefore, whether we look at the banking system politically or morally we see nothing but ev il; even the small savings of the working classes are evaporated, if I may be allowed the term, and made into an engine o f general oppression. All deposits should be made for safe keeping, and should be paid fo r if necessary, but never re-issued, as no profits can be derived from deprecia­ tion. Therefore, there can be no doubt that money is but “ dead capital,” and the less society uses of it the better. O f course, like all other com­ modities there must be a convenient quantity, but when that is obtained its increase should not go beyond the rate of increase o f other capital— bank facilities and gold getting in an opulent and industrious country are only sources of derangement, debt, and poverty. Dr. Smith was perfectly correct when he said, “ the cheapness of gold and silver discourages both the agriculture and manufactures of Spain and Portugal,” but he did not very plainly show' the mode of operation. The Dr. admits depreciation of the precious metals in this instance, though he denies it in others, but thinks it was caused by their exportation being taxed or prohibited. In this he was evidently wrong, as he was in some other instances. Prohibi­ tion would no doubt make exportation difficult, and cause greater fluctua­ tion in prices, which is always a source of evil; but the true cause o f depreciation was the natural and necessary law of redundancy. \"Whenever this happens the article must depreciate in relative value, that is, measured by other things. Thus, Spain would do as we have done for the last nine years, she would sell her agricultural and manufacturing produce at the price of gold they would command in- other countries, while she would buy at the depreciated price whatever she imported. Therefore, the gold exported from Spain “ would be presented to the rest o f the world gratuitously,” and the maintainance o f the labor o f gold digging would rest as a tax, to be paid by the Spanish community. This state o f things, as has been intimated, is exactly what our statistics will prove that we have been doing for the last nine years. The price o f imports has in ­ creased nearly one hundred and fifty per cent, while the price of exports has increased less than one hundred and twenty-five, showing a balance of twenty-five per cent against us in the nine years, which either is, or has to be, paid in specie or bullion. But, sir, we have been seriously and deliberately told that the precious metals will not depreciate. In other words, “ it is nut possible for them to become superabundant,” “ that the melting-pot of the goldsmith, or subjection to the gold-beater’s hammer, I 288 M oney and Banking. is the ultimate destination o f the whole o f the vast products of Siberia, California, and Australia.” Now, from what we have said it will be per­ ceived that we cannot adopt this opinion, but we have other reasons be­ sides those already stated. W e have perceived that the faster money in­ creases the scarcer and dearer it becomes, with respect to its use as money. As a proof o f this, we may state, if such proof be required, that the jointstock banks have had a meeting in London since the panic, at which a resolution was passed to reduce the interest on deposits to six per cent. How high it has been is not exactly stated. What chance has “ the melting-pot and the gold-beater’s hammer” under these circumstances ? One thing is certain, that they have not had a relative chance according to the production of gold, either here or in England. Cortes and Pizarro would never have found such heaps of gold and silver ornaments which stimulated the avarice of the Spaniards in Mexico and Peru, if either country had had a currency of the precious metals. And yet it is said they were both in the most prosperous condition— abounding in wealth of all descriptions— the one with a consumable commodity for a currency, and the other without any. The development o f commerce had not pro­ duced this social evil o f a fixed standard o f value, which has always been a source of demoralization and oppression among European* nations. But to return. Mr Carey found it equally difficult to maintain the defunct doctrines of the balance o f trade and the principle o f protection, if he were to admit the general depreciation o f the precious metals, as Dr. Smith did to up­ hold his doctrine of the beneficial effects of the issues o f bank paper, if he had to make the same admission. The Dr. says upon this subject, “ the increase of paper money, it has been said, by augmenting the quantity, and consequently diminishing the value, of the whole currency, necessarily augments the money price o f commodities.” But he thought this was not the case, because when there was very little else than paper money in Scotland, the prices of provisions bore about the same proportion to those of England as before the multiplication of banking companies. But he admitted that when “ Mr. Hume published his Political Discourses, soon after the great multiplication o f paper money in Scotland, there was a very sensible rise in the price of provisions, owing probably,” as he said, “ to the badness o f the seasons, and not to the multiplication of paper money.” He also had to admit in another place, that if more money were forced into the channels o f circulation than was sufficient to keep prices at their natural level it must overflow, and “ would be sent abroad in order to seek that profitable employment which it could not find at home.” Dr. Smith, like Mr. Carey, seems to have forgotten, or not to have noticed, that the only way in which the surplus would be sent abroad was by in­ creasing the price of imports relatively more than the price of exports. To such straits are the learned sometimes driven to uphold a fallacious doc­ trine. But Mr. Carey, as I have intimated above, attempts to revive the old doctrine of protection as a remedy for present financial evils, but it has been so thoroughly exploded years ago that there is hardly sufficient excuse for saying a word upon the subject. W e will, however, sav in * The kings o f France and of England, from the time o f Edward I , were in the habit o f depreCiatinff the value of their coins, by alloy and otherwise. Henry V I I , following the example o f his predecessors, reduced his coin considerably, and enacted a law making it death to refuse it, and his son, Hom y VIII., improved upon his father’s policy. Money and Banking. 289 passings that if a tariff were enacted sufficiently high to stop the entrance for a time of foreign goods, the price o f those goods would inevitably rise high enough to pay the duty and the usual p rice; then the stream would flow over the dam-head as before, but consumption would diminish to the extent of the tax, as all taxes must be paid by the consumer; and the general rate of profit upon capital would decrease, while under ordinary circumstances we should import a certain quantity of the precious metals from other countries, sufficient to be employed in the difference of price caused by the increased tax. Therefore, the prices of our imports would be increased and the prices of our exports decreased, and the foreign merchant and manufacturer would obtain the same amount o f profit as before, lacking that of the decreased consumption; and that is the only way in which the foreigner would be affected. Under present circum­ stances we might retain some of the gold we shall export, instead of im­ porting the amount from any other source. Other moral evils might ac­ crue; but by no possibility could the protected country be benefited. The argument may be put into a nutshell— no country can gain by producing that for which other countries have superior facilities. And it is both useless and ridiculous to group mere contemporary facts together, having no necessary relation, and ringing changes continually upon the words value, utility, and price, as no three words can be more distinct in meaning. It will deceive no one having any pretentions to science. But to return to our subject. The charter o f the Bank o f France has lately been ex­ tended for another thirty years, its capital doubled, and other objection­ able privileges granted. Ten years ago it was not allowed to issue notes o f a less denomination than five hundred francs, but under the new charter this privilege extends as low as fifty francs, and I am not quite sure that it is not twenty-five. Louis Napoleon, like the British government, in the case of the Bank of England, pockets the proceeds, but like the Regent o f Royal Bank celebrity, he may awake some fine morning and find his money turned to rags—-finance will be found less plastic than politics. Foreseeing these difficulties, a French journalist lately proposed a banking alliance, to lessen, if possible, the intensity of any monetary crisis which might happen. He proposed that the leading banks o f Europe should begin by taking each other’s paper and advising upon financial difficulties, but it seems he did not offer the right hand of fellowship to the American banks. In this he was mean and uncharitable, and showed the narrowness of his views— otherwise the scheme was worthy o f John Law himself; but its explosion would certainly have rung the death knell of banking on that side the Atlantic. The national banks and some others of note may weaken the storm o f the present crisis, but how long they will escape the inevitable fate of all banks is only a question o f time. The Bank of France has been shinning along for the last two years, some­ times in a desperate condition, and she will hardly be more stable under her new responsibilities and privileges. But to come nearer home. Our banking system, notwithstanding all the care and ingenuity dis­ played in its construction by the currency doctors, has again arrived at the condition of confessed and absolute inconvertibility. Within the last ten years banks have doubled in number, and still vve see notices o f new applications for charters. Every means have been used to push out their paper and to obtain deposits to re-issue, until they had not five per cent of specie upon the average to meet their liabilities. Suspension, thereVOL. x x x v i i i .— n o . in . 19 290 M oney and Banking. fore, was the only remedy, and the people took it very kindly— as a mere matter of course— not only so, but vigilance committees in a great many instances, said to be voluntary, undertook to protect the banks from outside intruders, who might be so unreasonable as to expect them to pay specie for their notes. It is pretty well understoood that fifty per cent will never be realized upon Western debts, and what would have been the consequence if suspension had not taken place we can only imagine. Some public writers, however, have said, in comparison with England, that our banking system is the sounder o f the two, but this we cannot allow, for notwithstanding, England may have suffered more from failures at present, if we had been obliged to come down to specie prices, no doubt, but seventy-five per cent o f our debts must have remained unpaid, and what will yet be done in this respect must depend upon circumstances over which we can have no control— the operation o f the crisis in other countries. Therefore, under all circumstances suspension was the only means of comparative safety, as the banks and the community were both embarked in one boat; but are we to be doomed continually to stand upon the brink of a commercial volcano, the explosion of which at any moment may be occasioned by the failure of a bubble company, the loss of a ship, or the failure of a crop ? It is time that these questions were gravely considered. W e have more than doubled our currency within the last ten years, consequently our capital and business transactions have also nominally doubled! Dr. M’Cay, o f South Carolina College, in a very able article, in this Magazine, December, 1856, satisfactorily proved that prices up to that period had increased from thirty-five to forty per cent since we had been receiving supplies o f gold from California; but our currency increased considerably after that, and his calculation also was extremely moderate. And yet in the same number o f years, accord­ ing to the last census, our domestic products had only increased at the utmost possible calculation, twenty per cent. Thus, we have created within the last ten years a surplus currency o f eighty per cent, that is, eighty per cent beyond the probable increase of other capital. But other countries had also been engaged in the same profitless operation as our­ selves, and to the same extent, or the re-action must have come much earlier. Now, the question naturally arises, who has been benefited by this unnecessary addition to the currency, which must have made every individual poorer, excepting one class— the money makers. Yes, the bankers and .the gold-getters have pocketed the whole of this increase, abstracted from the rate of profit upon capital engaged in other pursuits. But lest this statement should not convey an adequate idea o f the magni­ tude of the evil, or of the amount o f taxation we have suffered, we will take the liberty of extending our observations a little further. The bank­ ing deposits have increased, within the time specified, at least one hun­ dred and fifty per cent, discounts and loans have also more than doubled, therefore, at a moderate calculation, we may say that the currency has increased four hundred millions of dollars. W e may talk of the Missis­ sippi Scheme and South Sea Bubble, but where shall we find another such gratuitous transfer of property? If the system could possibly continue the banks would absorb all the circulating capital o f the country, in fact, there seems to be no apparent reason why they should not, in time, swallow up the whole, except the necessary wages and taxes. W e have Spain for an example— there is only one alternative— annihilate the present monetary M oney and Banking. 291 system, or it will annihilate the State. W e have always been taught that natural debts were an unmitigated evil, and it has hitherto been the pride of the American system to eschew them ; but what difference is there whether the debt be a public one or a private one? W e have now about twelve hundred millions o f commercial debt, seven owing to the banks, and about four-and-a-half to foreigners, besides private debts incal­ culable. This is a national debt without a question, which will not be paid off for the present. It is a fallacy to assume that we have grown so extremely rich within the last few years as taxable statistics have made us, while the statistics of the census shows that production has compara­ tively decreased. If we only multiply by two for the next ten years, as we have done for the past, our riches will, o f course, increase in the same ratio, counted in paper dollars. Thus, the whole is a gigantic humbug, and yet no one is to blame. The people, in their ignorance, under blind political and economical leaders, have politely given the bankers and gGld-getters leave to pick their pockets, under the idea that they (them­ selves) should be benefited. The impetus given to the increase of money, by the discoveries of gold all over the world, has introduced a new era in finance, which must evoke new principles. The Bank of England has found herself checkmated by the joint-stock banks, notwithstanding her monopoly, and was only saved from suspension by the interference o f the government, and yet there seems to be no complaints of imprudence in her management. How long the manufacturers o f Great Britain will be enabled to compete with those of other countries under these new cir­ cumstances remains to be seen. There is one thing in their favor, how­ ever— other countries are smitten with the same virulent disease— that of money making. Joint-stock companies, as before stated, have been formed, and are forming, all over Europe, even in Turkey. The Em­ peror of France has decided to push gold-getting on the Senegal, so that he will not be behind his English neighbors in making money and sup­ porting the bank. The production o f gold fofr the last year is set down at two hundred millions of dollars, and, therefore, at a moderate calculation the amountof gold thrown upon the markets of the world for the next decade, will ex­ ceed two thousand millions. It has also been stated by a legislative com­ mittee in South Australia that the auriferous soils o f that region cannot be exhausted in two thousand years. What then will be the consequence of pursuing our present system with regard to money ? In passing further over these circumstances it is hardly necessary to say that the cause of the “ flight of the precious metals to the East,” about which we have lately heard such lugubrious lamentations, is sufficiently explained— money, like water, will find the level, and the more there is poured into the reservoir, the more it will spread over the surface, until the stream be stopped at its fountain. W e have now slightly reviewed some o f the causes of the crisis, and of the evils which a continuance in our present course will occasion, and have only to offer the remedy recommended in former articles; that is, to force the withdrawal o f bank notes gradually, abolish the standard o f value, and in the meantime, issue as many treasury notes as can be conveniently employed in the operation of government and the domestic exchanges. Under these circumstances the currency could never be increased beyond the rate of increase of other capital; and when the increased volume of commerce and taxation required an increase 292 Garblings: or Commercial Commodities Characterized. o f treasury notes, the government could reduce so much o f taxes and issue the required quantity of notes, which would be so much saved to the people. A ll governments could do the same, and adopt the dollar as a mere unit of accounts, without a fixed amount of gold or silver attached, and all trading transactions would then he balanced by gold and silver paid according to weight and price, the same as all other commodities. Banks would then be unnecessary. I remain, dear sir, yours truly, E. SUIXF.Y. Art. III.— GARBLINGS: OR, COMMERCIAL COMMODITIES CHARACTERIZED. NUM BER ALC O H O LIC V n .* j LIQUORS.

Mixtures.— According to the laws o f France, which country has paid more attention to this subject than all the world besides, a wine which re­ sults from the mixture o f other pure wine is not an adulteration. That good wine may result from the mixture o f a strong wine with weak ; one that is light with one that has more b od y ; one that is tart with one that is rich and sweet; one that is wanting in coloring matter with one that has too much, and so on. It was the primitive practice for manufacturers to mix the different va­ rieties of grapes and must before fermentation, in order to produce a par­ ticular quality of wine; and in the production of the best wines this practice still holds. It, however, requires a great degree of experience to successfully practice the process. The best unmixed wine made in the United States is made in the county of Los Angelos, California. The vine was introduced into that county about a century and a half ago, by cuttings from Madeira, and the flavor of the grape, and aroma o f the wine produced from it, are both maintained in the highest degree. It therefore requires no “ pure ju ic e ” of foreign production to give it an acceptable zest. Other species of grape also flourish there, and the soil, climate, and labor, all seem to combine to place it at the head o f our wine-growing districts. ♦For number i , see Merchants’ Magazine for July, 1857, (vol. xxxvii., pp. 19-23;) for number 1!., see same for August, (pp. 166-171;) for number iii., see same for September, (pp. 298-303;) for ■umber iv., see same for November, (pp. 542-654;) for number v., see same for January, 1858, (vol. xxxviii., pp. 48-50; for number vi., see same for February, (pp. 175-183.) Garblings: or, Commercial Commodities Characterized. 298 Other wines, made in the United States, generally have added to them certain proportions o f the qualities they are intended to represent. These may be considered pure mixed wines. Longworth, the great pioneer in American wine-making, has succeeded in producing wine o f undoubted purity, equal to some o f the finest foreign ; but, as a general thing, it has not the flavor o f the chief grape used in its production. Adulteration.— W ine is the product of grape juice only. To manufac­ ture, or to sell, or to offer for sale, any other substance under the name of wine, is an adulteration. But to such a pass has the adulteration o f liquor come in the United States, that, to mend the condition of deficient must, the addition of certain substances is advocated with the authority o f a State paper! In the Agricultural Report of the Patent-office for 18o6, we are informed that, “ sugar, water, brandy, lime, tar, sweet-scented sub­ stances, &c., may be introduced to advantage before fermentation, so as to incorporate well that which can never be done after it. That whenever strength is required in wine, the brandy should be put into the must be­ fore fermentation, with which it is incorporated and modified, the alcohol contained in it being always so chemically combined as to be harmless / ” Now, everybody knows that both grapes and must are subject to certain defects or diseases, which render them unfit for the production of potable wine, and no amount of correctives can make them capable o f producing it. To advocate, therefore, that the conditions of must, necessary for the production of pure wine, can be made up of materials derived from any other material than grape juice, either in its natural or fermented state, is a mischievous tendency to adulteration. The usual results o f defective grapes or must are— 1. Excessive astringency. This is occasioned by an abortive crop, or premature ripening of the grapes, from peculiarity of season. 2. Acidity, which depends upon the greenness of the grapes, or acetous fermentation o f the must or wine. 3. Ropiness or greasiness, which is owing to the deficiency o f tannin. 4. Mustiness, a condition usually derived from the cask, bottle, or cork. 5. Turned, or le poux, a disease by which wine loses its acidity, and changes to a dark color, and sometimes takes on a putrid fermentation. 6. Bitterness. This condition sometimes takes place without known cause, in wine made o f must possessing all the requisite qualities; in which case it usually ceases after a short time, and after a new fermenta­ tion the quality of the wine is re-established. I. Excess or absence of color, either of which may result from the same causes as astringency or acidity. Other changes of less moment may take place from a variety o f causes. Wine, in any of these conditions, is generally susceptible of the acetous fermentation, by which it can be converted into vinegar. The distribution o f wines made of diseased grapes, or from must o f bad quality, or wine in a diseased condition from whatever cause, whether “ correctives ” have been applied or not, is a vile disregard o f public health, and should be placed on the same footing as the distribution o f other stale and diseased provisions; and the advocacy o f their use is a reproach to the true state of agricultural progress in the United States. One of the prime objects o f the Patent-office reports should be the dis­ couragement of adulteration under whatever phase. But in the one above referred to, that which of all others it is most difficult to detect, is incul­ 294 Garblings : or, Commercial Commodities Characterized. cated and taught as a species of laudable ingenuity. It is the legitimate forerunner o f the “ Bordeaux Wine and Liquor Dealers’ Guide : a Treatise on the Manufacture and Adulteration o f Liquors, by a Practical Liquor Manufacturer,” lately “ published for the author” in N e w York, which purports to be the “ result o f many years' practice o f an entirely new sys­ tem of manufacturing and adulterating liquors!” Experienced adulteraters and counterfeiters generally base their opera­ tions upon certain known qualities which pertain to the substance to be imitated. • Water, alcohol, extractive matter, bitartrate o f potassa, and inorganic mineral salts, are essential principles to all wines. Whatever may be the other qualities, these principles at least must be present, and it is by vary­ ing their proportions, and adding other things, that the different varieties o f wine are counterfeited. It is by the variable proportions of the ele­ mentary principles that different qualities o f wine are distinguished, and as these principles are all miscible with, as well as constituents of, wine in every proportion, it is manifest that o f all substances added to wine, they are the most difficult of detection. Counterfeit wines.— For this purpose cider is generally used. Perry, which has similar properties, is sometimes substituted. According to the “ Wine and Liquor Dealers’ Guide,” cider, prepared as a basis for every variety of wine, consists of— cider, forty gallons; pure spirits, under proof, three gallons ; sugar or syrup, three pounds; and of crude tartar, half a pound. These should be well stirred together in a full cask, which should be left with the bung open, and exposed to the necessary degree of temperature to produce fermentation ; after which it is racked off, fined, &c., and kept for use. Thus prepared, and mixed with water, sugar, honey, tartaric acid, lemon juice, cream of tartar, almond oil, fresh grape juice, wine, alcohol, and yeast, it is used for imitating al­ most every variety o f wine in commerce. The finest imitation of Cham­ pagne is said to be made of equal parts of native Catawba and prepared cider, with a little water, lemon juice, sugar, and tartaric acid. Cham­ pagne is also extensively imitated by charging low-priced still wines with carbonic acid. This is done by machinery adapted to the purpose, similar to that used for charging soda water. The prestige of pure native wines, derived from the spotless name of Longworth, has lately received a severe check by the refusal o f certain wine merchants in Cincinnati to have their wines inspected. This cir­ cumstance is virtual acknowledgement of adulteration; and it is well known that the Cincinnati wine dealers are, to an equal extent, dealers in such crude materials as constitute a well-assorted stock, according to the “ Wine and Liquor Dealers’ Guide.” Alcohol.— The exact amount of alcohol in any given sample o f wine may be ascertained by evaporation into a receiver, and testing the fluid so collected by an alcoholometer, or by the specific-gravity bottle— the chief care in the use of these instruments being a due regard to temper­ ature, which should be 60° F. The quantity of alcohol by measure in different wines ranges from 23.83 to 6.66 per cent— port being about half as strong as Scotch whisky, and the weak red wines of France about as strong as Scotch ale.

These estimates are deduced from French analyses, and are considerably below those furnished by wines prepared for export, or those generally found in the English and American markets. English port, Madeira, and sherry contain from 21 to 26 per cent of alcohol, and claret from 13 to 17. Other wines for the English market are branched in a proportionate ratio. When brandy or alcohol is added to wine it remains in a free state— does not combine with the other ingredients. To obviate this, it is the custom of adulteraters to excite a new fermentation, in order, as it is supposed, to effect a thorough assimilation. This operation is called “ fretting in.” Various means have been instituted in order to ascertain whether wine contains other water, alcohol, extractive, bitartrate of potassa, and salts, than are natural to the grape; but, as already stated, owing to their va­ riable proportions, no degree of manipulation, however accurate, can, within certain limits, demonstrate whether these principles are natural to the grape or added by the hand of man. Evaporation, distillation, &c., may, demonstrate the quantity o f any one, or all of them, contained in a given sample, but some of them exist naturally in certain wines in more than four times the quantity that they do in others. It is, nevertheless, wholly impossible to so artificially combine any heterogeneous elements as to make the same substance as that of natural formation. Counterfeit wine having cider or perry for a basis, may be discovered by the quantity o f extract after evaporation. Pure wine contains from 18 to 28 per cent of extract, but cider or perry never less than 30 per cent, and from that up to 37 per cent. Alcohol obtained by the distillation of cider also differs from that of wine. In the former there is a peculiar etherial odor which is never present in the latter. The same may be discovered, by the odor disen­ gaged, in burning the extract. There is, however, independent of such means, an indubitable resource, 296 Garblings: or, Commercial Commodities Characterzed. in types o f comparison. By having types o f wine of known purity, any suspected sample purporting to be of the same variety, can always be tested. Types of wine for this purpose, should be procured with great care from the original producer, and, when practicable, of the same age and vintage as the suspected sample purports to be. Sugar and molasses.— The quantity o f saccharine matter in wine may be estimated by means o f a saccharometer— the name of a hydrometer, with a scale adapted to the proportion of saccharine matter contained in any solu­ tion. But first it is necessary to separate the extractive matter ; this may be done by adding a saturated solution o f the acetate o f lead, in the pro­ portion of one part to eight of the wine to be examined. This precipitates all the extractive except sugar. Then filter the supernatant fluid, and re­ move the lead from it, as directed, for that substance. The solution may now be tested by the saccharometer, or more certainly by evaporation, by means of which, the exact amount of sugar may be collected and weighed. Its quantity, however, is so variable, that within certain bounds, it is im­ possible to say whether it is natural or added, excepting by the type o f comparison. In some experiments in England to ascertain the percentage of sugar in different varieties o f wine procured there, Dr. Bence Jones found it to vary, as follows :— Paracrette............................................ Lamas.................................................. Tokay.................................................... Malmsey.............................................. P ort...................... Champagne.......................................... Madeira................................................ Sherry.................................................. 66 16 6 6 4 94 grains o f sugar to the ounce o f wine* 88 “ “ “ “ 74 “ “ “ “ to 66 “ “ “ “ to 34 “ “ “ “ to 28 “ “ “ “ to 20 “ “ “ to 18 In Claret, Burgundy, Rhenish, and Moselle, none could be detected. Cream o f tartar or tartrate o f potassa.— The presence o f cream of tartar is constant in every variety of pure wine ; the amount, however, is extremely variable. It is an addition to all imitations, and therefore the quantity present in any given sample, is of much moment, in order to compare with what is known to exist in a pure type. The best means of ascertaining the amount present is, to take 500 grains by measure o f the wine, evaporate to dryness, and ignite the residue; by this means the cream of tartar is converted into the carbonate of potassa, and the amount can be determined by the reaction o f dilute sulphuric acid of known strength. If, however, the sample has also been adulterated with the carbonates of lime, soda, or potassa, this test is fallacious. And in this event, the tartrate of potassa should be obtained in crystals from an aqueous solution. Tartaric acid.— According to Liebig, the Rhine-wines, when old, fre­ quently contain this acid in a free state. This, he says, is due to the custom of constantly adding new wine to the tun, in proportion as the old is drawn off. Its effects are to make the wine of more agreeable fla­ vor, though more injurious in use. It is therefore judicious to destroy this excess, in all cases, when it can be done without injury to the wine by mischievous means; and for this purpose, Liebig advises the use of pure neutral tartrate o f potash. But in very many wines the excess of tartaric acid is so great— doubtless made so by adulteration, in order to Garblings: or, Commercial Commodities Characterized. 29 1 improve the flavor— the quantity o f neutral tartrate required to neu­ tralize it, results in the formation of an excess of acetate of potash, which being soluble in wine, vitiates the taste. The remedy, therefore, only applies to a natural excess. In other cases, it is an additional adultera­ tion. The presence of free tartaric acid in wine may be tested by the addi­ tion of lime water or other alkaline solution, which throws down a white precipitate, which is very soluble in an excess of acid. Free tartaric acid may also be detected, by adding to a solution con­ taining it, twice as much of a solution of chloride of potassium, saturated at the temperature of 600 F. Stir the mixture with a glass rod for ten minutes, and bitartrate of potassa will be precipitated. If this test be applied to wine containing no excess of acid, it will take several hours to precipitate the natural bitartrate. The amount o f free tartaric acid contained in any sample of wine, may be estimated by the proportion of a test-alkaline solution, which is capa­ ble of saturating a given quantity o f the wine. And the whole amount of tartaric acid, both free and combined, may be ascertained, first by this process, and afterwards by decomposing the tartrates. In this way any variety of wine may be rendered available for comparison with a type. Tannin.— This is one o f the most important of the elementary con­ stituents of wine, and absolutely essential to its preservation. Hence it is a common addition to diseased wines and imitations. To ascertain the exact amount in wine, M. Faure has discovered the following simple means, viz.:— that one hundred grains of a solution o f gellatin added to an equal quantity of a watery solution of tannin, is capa­ ble of precipitating one grain o f tannin. To apply this experiment to wine, it is only necessary to have due regard to its specific gravity. The quan­ tity obtained should be compared with that o f the type. By imitators, kino, log-wood, rhatany, alum, and oak bark, are some­ times added in order to give the properties due to tannin. Coloring matter.— The additions to wine, for this purpose, are mostly limited to particular varieties. In the Oporto Company’s district, the most common substance used, is jerupiga. This is a compound made o f unfermented must, brandy, elder-berries, and brown sugar. Poke-berries, red poppies, privet-berries, myrtle-berries, log-wood, Bra­ zil-wood, and India-wood, are the common ingredients added to different varieties of wine, in order to produce a desired shade of color. By adding a solution of alum and carbonate of potash to wine, if there is a precipitate o f blue, violet, or rose color, artificial coloring may be suspected. A solution of potash added to wine, colored with red poppies, produces a greenish-brown precipitate; privet-berries, produces a violet-brown pre­ cipitate; myrtle-berries, produces a greyish-blue precipitate; elder berries, produces a violet precipitate; Brazil-wood, produces a violet-grey pre­ cipitate ; India-wood, produces a rose-colored precipitate. Poke-berry juice cannot be detected by this test. The coloring matter produced by poke-berries so nearly corresponds to that of the natural color of wine, that it is extremely difficult to detect it, by any other means, than by its constitutional effects on those who have been so unfortunate as to make much use of wine containing it. It is violently acrid in its effects, producing headache, purging, and great pros­ 298 Garblings: or, Commercial Commodities Characterized. tration o f strength ; and if long continued or taken in large quantity, it is an acro-narcotic poison— producing severe vomiting and purging, with great stupefaction. Lead. This substance is added in the form o f litharge, and svgar o f lead, for the purpose o f correcting acidity and giving sweetness. But besides these, it has sometimes found its way into wine by the use of utensils, in the process of manufacture, bottling, &c. Wines containing much of it are generally of light color, and have a sweetish styptic taste. The habitual use o f wine containing lead, though in very small quan­ tity, produces dyspepsia, excessive lassitude, and melancholly. If persisted in, succeeding this condition frequent fits of colic occur, which are often very obstinate, and sometimes fatal. Next, apoplexy, with or without a peculiar kind of palsy particularly affecting the balls o f the thumbs and the loss of power to extend the fingers, which persists unto death, unless the poison is discontinued. In an English treatise on wine-making, pub­ lished in 1733, to hinder wine from turning sour, it is recommended to “ pu t a pound o f melted lead into the cask and stop it close.\" And 11to soften gray wine, put a little vinegar wherein litharge has been well steeped, and boil some honey to draw out the wax. Strain it through a cloth, and put a quart of it into a tierce of wine, and this will mend it.” In Paris, the practice was also so common, that in 1775 an epidemic of lead colic was attributed to wine adulterated with litharge. And in 1837, there was an epidemic o f lead colic among the soldiers at Compiegne, in consequence of the use of wine, which had been sweetened with acetate of lead. In 1853, there was a circumscribed epidemic of lead colic in Paris, which was ascertained to be due to cider clarified with sugar of lead. The easiest way of detecting the presence of lead, is to acidulate a portion of the wine to be examined with muriatic acid, and then pass a current of sulphuretted hydrogen gas through it. If lead be present, there will be a dark-colored precipitate o f sulphuret of lead. Copper. This substance is also introduced sometimes in the process of manufacture; but at others, by the addition o f water or alcohol, which contain some salt of this metal in solution. It is a powerful irritant poison to the human system. Producing at first irritation and inflammation of the lining membrane of the stomach and bowels, ultimately followed by lethargy, convulsions, and death. To discover it in wine, it is necessary to evaporate a certain quantity, and incinerate the residue. Treat the ashes with nitric or nitro-muriatic acid, filter and evaporate. Dissolve the residue o f this in distilled water and test as follows:— Ferrocyanide of potassium produces a brown pre­ cipitate ; carbonate of potassa a pale-blue precipitate ; sulphurreted hydro­ gen, a black precipitate, and the arsenite of potassa a grass-green. Zinc sometimes finds its way into wine by the use o f vessels composed of it. It is a less active poison than lead or copper, but it may be sus­ pected, when wine seems to have the effect of constipating the bowels. For its detection proceed in the same manner as for copper— using as tests, ammonia or potassa, which produce white precipitates. Alum is a frequent adulteration for various purposes. To fix the color, to clarify, to impart keeping qualities for exportation, to give a styptio taste, &c. On adding chloride of barium or the nitrate o f barytes to a wine con­ Garblings : or, Commercial Commodities Characterized. 299 taining alum, there is an instantaneous white precipitate, which is insoluble in nitric or nitro-muriatic acid. Sulphate o f iron, or copperas, is added to wine for the same purpose as alum, and it may be precipitated by the same means. Its presence is in­ dicated by a blue color on the addition o f ferrocyanide of potassium. Carbonates o f potassa, soda, and lime, are common additions for the correction of acidity. The saturation of the excessive acidity of wines by these substances converts them into acetates. To demonstrate their pres­ ence, it is necessary to evaporate the suspected wine to dryness, but with as low a temperature as possible, in order that all the acetic acid may be evolved without decomposing the new ly formed acetates. By treating the residue with sulphuric acid the acetate is decomposed, and the acetic acid set free— it may be collected in a retort. To ascertain which of the corbonates have been employed, dissolve a part o f the extract in distilled water, filter through charcoal so as to deprive it of coloring matter, and add reactives. The acetate of lime is discovered by adding oxalate of ammonia, in a precipitate of oxalate o f lime. If this is not formed, the other acetates may be discovered by again evaporating to dryness, and treating with alcohol, which dissolves the acetates. Alcohol, containing the acetate of lime in solution, on being diluted with water, by tbe addi­ tion o f oxalate of ammonia, throws down a white precipitate of oxalate of ammonia. But the acetates of soda and potash cannot be absolutely determined without crystalization. On slowly evaporating a colorless solution containing the acetate of potash, irregular lamellated crystals, of a white satiny appearance, are formed. These are o f a strong acid saline taste, and very deliquescent. The acetate of soda is more easily crystalized ; the form of the crystals being complicated in striated needles and oblique rhombic prisms, vari­ ously modified. It is of a cooling, saline, bitterish taste. It is evident that for the detection of this adulteration, a large quantity of the suspected wine is necessary for the experiment. Sulphate o f lime, or plaster o f Paris. The presence of this substance in wine, has given rise to the appellation o f the plasterage o f wines. It is due to “ a new method of clarifying wines,” as first published in L’Encyclopedie des arts et matiers mecaniques, tom viii., p. 628, 1817. In later editions of this work, the article is expunged. But in 1839, the same process was again published by one Serane, in Montpelier, as a new invention, for which he obtained a patent. In 1854, the prefect of the Department of the Pyrenees-Orientales, stated that the practice was general in that department, excepting in wines which were preserved for domestic use. The same was the case in Herault. When plaster o f Paris is added to wine, it is partially decomposed, by which sulphate of potassa is formed, and held in solution, and tartrate of lime precipitated. It is, therefore, the sulphate o f potassa, which is taken into the system by the use of xvines clarified with sulphate o f lime. The court of Montpelier has decided, that the practice followed and known in the south o f France under the name o f “ Le Plastrage des wins,” does not constitute the crime of falsification of drinks and of mixtures prejudicial to health, in the sense o f the laws of 1851 and 1855. But notwithstanding this decision, an individual has been condemned by the Tribunal Saint-Affrique, for having sold wine thus treated ! The sulphate of potash is comparatively an insoluble salt, requiring six­ 300 Garblings: or , Commercial Commodities Characterized. teen parts by weight of cold, and five o f hot water, for its solution. Its constitutional effects, in considerable quantity, are permanently laxative, but in the quantity supposed to be taken in wine, which has been clarified with sulphate of lime, there are no traceable effects, which can be said of no other substance used for the same purpose. Sulphuric acid has in some cases been added to wine for the purpose o f re-establishing that which has turned, to mask flatness, or to give sharp­ ness. Owing to the salts o f wine, sulphuric acid thus added does not remain free, but unites with them to form sulphate o f potassu. To detect it, therefore, it is necessary to have recourse to such reactives as pertain to this latter substance. Such are the chief counterfeits and adulterations, which at present con­ stitute the wines o f commerce C onstitutional E ffects. In all ages among civilized people, there has existed a remarkable inclination to the use o f wine, while its abuse has been coevally condemned. The variable proportion o f the constituent principles of wine, apparently indicate a want of, uniformity in its constitutional effects. In pure wine, however, there is no individuality o f action of any one of its constituent principles, because each element is so modified in its character by com­ bination with all the rest, that the effect on the constitution is attributable to the wine integrally, and not to any excess o f any particular principle. Hence the constitutional effects of pure wine may be considered in the aggregate, independent o f such action as shows a preponderance of some particular principle ; this latter condition being generally an evidence of impurity. In all wines alcohol is the predominant principle, yet unless it is free—• that which is added in adulteration— its character is so modified by com­ bination as to exercise a very different power on the system from what it does when not subject to any such influence. It has already been shown that some o f the strongest wines contain about half as much alcohol as whisky; in other words, that a pint of Madeira or Port is, in alcohol, equal to half a pint o f whisky or gin. Yet everybody knows that they differ much more than this in their effects on the human system. The stimulant qualities of wine are not only less powerful than an equivalent proportion o f alcohol in any other form, but they are much slower of production, and o f much longer duration. Considering this property, and what has already been said o f the extractive and other con­ stituent principles o f wine, the result o f its habitual use can be easily com­ prehended, v iz, supernutrition or plethora, which is ordinarily the intro­ duction to the usual diseases of wine bibbers— apoplexy, gout, gravel, and dropsy. So insidious are the constitutional effects o f wine drinking that most writers on the subject excuse it on the ground of an artificial state o f the sys­ tem, which either produces a necessity for persisting in its use, or inures the system to any ill-effects from continued indulgence. This apology for wine drinking has slain its thousands, while the propagators of it have failed to apply those principles of nutrition which are apparent to the merest tyro in the laws of health. The first effects manifest in excessive nutrition display an exuberance of health, hence the mistake that the most perfect health is compatible G arllings: or, Commercial Commodities Characterized. SOI with the moderate indulgence in, or habitual use of, wine. But when the supply of nutritive material is habitually abundant, and the functions of the system are stimulated, the usual effect is increase of bulk, especially bo if the habits of exercise are not such as to create an amount o f excre­ tion proportionate to the inordinate supply o f nutrition. If the excess of supply be only slight or casual, with a proportionate degree of physical exertion, the self-adjusting powers of nature may he equal to the irregularity, and prevent the transition o f healthy into diseased action. But if the excess be great or habitual, the organic functions are over-taxed, and their conservative powers necessarily languish. This con­ dition is succeeded by such irregularities as display the worst effects of wine drinking, by the development of incurable diseases, which have had their foundation in “ perfect health.” It is obvious, therefore, that the exuberance o f health evinced by the florid countenance and fatness of the wine-bibber, are the suspicious evidences of a constitution taxed to the very highest decree o f forbear­ ance, which must, in course of time, become relaxed and sink even below the normal standard of resistance. In this vitiated state of the system, constitutional predispositions to disease, both hereditary and acquired, that might otherwise have lain dormant, are frequently roused into the most speedy fatality. That there are some constitutions which appear to be unaffected by the habitual use of wine is no less true than that of any other habit tolerated by the natural powers of endurance. But, as stated in a previous chapter, such habits only serve to demonstrate the capabilities of the human con­ stitution, and are in no event admisable evidence o f natural adaptation. Under circumstances of extraordinary fatigue and exposure, and in cer­ tain diseased states o f the system, the tonic effects of wine remarkably display the action here attributed to it. But for healthy persons under ordinary circumstances, observation, experience, and pathology, all go to show that the powers of the human constitution are uniformly weakened by the habitual use o f wine. For occasional use, or adaptation to certain states o f the system when wine m aybe deemed advisable or salutary, it is important to bear in mind some of the differences in the numerous varieties which have been described. In the healthy, they are all least injurious when associated with regular habits o f out-door exercise, and most hurtful to the sedentary and the indolent, and the strong wines more injurious than the weak ones. Sweet wines contain the most extractive, on which account they gen­ erally disagree with dyspeptics, while the amount of sugar they contain renders them injurious for persons afflicted with urinary diseases. Red wines also contain a good deal of extractive, which, together with the coloring matter, renders them obnoxious to dyspeptics, and others who have delicate stomachs. Acid wanes promote gout and rheumatism, especially so if they have been preceded by the strong wines. Sparkling wines more quickly intoxicate than others of the same rela­ tive strength. This is owing to the presence o f carbonic acid and the volatile state of the alcohol. They are very apt to bring on a fit o f the gout in persons who are subject to it, and they usually produce indiges­ tion. Burgundy wines are more heady than other wines, and they produce 302 Coinage o f the Various Countries o f the World. a more powerful impression on the nervous system, on which account they have been supposed to possess some unknown acrid principle. Bordeaux wines are the converse of the Burgundy. They are the least intoxicating of all wines. In other qualities, however, they are very ir­ regular, sometimes astringent, sometimes laxative, depending upon the mixture which constitutes them. Rhenish wines and Moselle are, in intoxicating effects, similar to Bor­ deaux, but they frequently contain acid. When pure they are better adapted to certain feverish states of the system than any other. Of strong wines, “ port” abounds in alcohol and astringency, and its habitual use is of all wines most apt to produce gout. It is heavy and indigestible. Sherry is strongly alcoholic, but its non-acidity renders it preferable to all others where a strong wine is indicated. Madeira chiefly differs from sherry in oftentimes being acid, when otherwise, its effects are the same as sherry. Old wines are generally preferable to new, first, because they contain less alcohol; and secondly, because by age they cease to hold in solution bitartrate of potassa, coloring, and extractive matters. In brief, they contain less o f the most injurious principles. It must be evident from the foregoing that the degree of injury to the constitution from the use o f wine depends, in a great measure, upon the quality as well as the quantity used, and also upon constitutional predis­ position to disease. Generally speaking, however, the first deviations from a healthy standard take place so gradually as to be scarcely perceptable, and when disease is discovered it is apt to be ascribed to “ constitu­ tional” indisposition. To relieve this, the cravings o f a habit which has now become really constitutional, are interpreted as beneficial, and the accustomed stimulus assumes to be so too, because it appeases the appetite. But preternatural excitement has been kept up so long that the natural powers of the system are now beginning to decline, and unbearable de­ pression takes the place of normal strength. The organic functions lose their harmony, and now that the disease is incurable, it is ac­ knowledged. It is in this way that those who have accustomed them­ selves to the use of wine suffer when they leave it off. As, therefore, persons in perfect health can receive no possible benefit from its use, the insidious advances of a possibly dangerous disease— habitual wine drink­ ing— are best resisted when wine is wholly excluded. Art. V.— COINAGE OF THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES OF THE AV0RL1). [The Act of Congress, approved February 21,1857, provided that the Annual Report of the Director of the Mint of the United States, should thereafter present the operations of the mint during the fiscal year of the government, (ending June 30th, of each year,) instead of during the calendar year, as had previously been done. The present article consists of a condensation of a part of the report for 1857, (as published in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury on the finances,) which presents accounts of the recent coinage of the different countries of the world, and which were collected by the Director of the Mint, J ames R oss S nowben, under a provision of the act above mentioned, as stated in the first paragraph following.— E d .

A strict compliance with the law would require but a brief report, as but few foreign coins are now “ known to our commerce,” the course of trade leading the precious metals, especially gold, from the shores of the United States, and scarcely any comes from abroad, except what may be found in the hands o f emigrants and travelers.
