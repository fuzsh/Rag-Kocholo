In the first part, the essential electrical and optical models inherent to LED modeling are reviewed. The second part of the work describes a methodology to improve the efficiency of the simulation procedure by using the concept of process compact models (PCMs). The last part demonstrates the capabilities of PCMs using an example of a blue InGaN LED. In particular, a parameter screening is performed to find the most important parameters, an optimization task incorporating the robustness of the design is carried out, and finally the impact of manufacturing tolerances on yield is investigated. It is indicated how the concept of PCMs can contribute to an efficient design for manufacturing DFM-aware development.\n\nA 3D TCAD simulation of a thermoelectric module configured for thermoelectric power generation, cooling and heating\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGould, C. A.; Shammas, N. Y. A.; Grainger, S.; Taylor, I.; Simpson, K.\n\n2012-06-01\n\nThis paper documents the 3D modeling and simulation of a three couple thermoelectric module using the Synopsys Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) semiconductor simulation software. Simulation results are presented for thermoelectric power generation, cooling and heating, and successfully demonstrate the basic thermoelectric principles. The 3D TCAD simulation model of a three couple thermoelectric module can be used in the future to evaluate different thermoelectric materials, device structures, and improve the efficiency and performance of thermoelectric modules.\n\nMeasurements and TCAD simulation of novel ATLAS planar pixel detector structures for the HL-LHC upgrade\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNellist, C.; Dinu, N.; Gkougkousis, E.; Lounis, A.\n\n2015-06-01\n\nThe LHC accelerator complex will be upgraded between 2020-2022, to the High-Luminosity-LHC, to considerably increase statistics for the various physics analyses. To operate under these challenging new conditions, and maintain excellent performance in track reconstruction and vertex location, the ATLAS pixel detector must be substantially upgraded and a full replacement is expected. Processing techniques for novel pixel designs are optimised through characterisation of test structures in a clean room and also through simulations with Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD). A method to study non-perpendicular tracks through a pixel device is discussed. Comparison of TCAD simulations with Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) measurements to investigate the doping profile of structures and validate the simulation process is also presented.\n\nTCAD simulation for alpha-particle spectroscopy using SIC Schottky diode.\n\nPubMed\n\nDas, Achintya; Duttagupta, Siddhartha P\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThere is a growing requirement of alpha spectroscopy in the fields context of environmental radioactive contamination, nuclear waste management, site decommissioning and decontamination. Although silicon-based alpha-particle detection technology is mature, high leakage current, low displacement threshold and radiation hardness limits the operation of the detector in harsh environments. Silicon carbide (SiC) is considered to be excellent material for radiation detection application due to its high band gap, high displacement threshold and high thermal conductivity. In this report, an alpha-particle-induced electron-hole pair generation model for a reverse-biased n-type SiC Schottky diode has been proposed and verified using technology computer aided design (TCAD) simulations. First, the forward-biased I-V characteristics were studied to determine the diode ideality factor and compared with published experimental data. The ideality factor was found to be in the range of 1.4-1.7 for a corresponding temperature range of 300-500 K. Next, the energy-dependent, alpha-particle-induced EHP generation model parameters were optimised using transport of ions in matter (TRIM) simulation. Finally, the transient pulses generated due to alpha-particle bombardment were analysed for (1) different diode temperatures (300-500 K), (2) different incident alpha-particle energies (1-5 MeV), (3) different reverse bias voltages of the 4H-SiC-based Schottky diode (-50 to -250 V) and (4) different angles of incidence of the alpha particle (0Â°-70Â°).The above model can be extended to other (wide band-gap semiconductor) device technologies useful for radiation-sensing application.

Using this simulation method, we conduct electrostatic simulations of SiNW biosensors with a more realistic target charge model where the target is described as a charged cube, randomly located across the nanowire surface, and analyze the Coulomb effect on the SiNW FET according to the position and distribution of the target charges. The simulation results show the considerable variation in the SiNW current according to the bound target positions, and also the dependence of conductance modulation on the polarity of target charges. This simulation method and the results can be utilized for analysis of the properties and behavior of the biosensor device, such as the sensing limit or the sensing resolution.\n\nDynamic mesh for TCAD modeling with ECORCE\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMichez, A.; Boch, J.; Touboul, A.; SaignÃ©, F.\n\n2016-08-01\n\nMesh generation for TCAD modeling is challenging. Because densities of carriers can change by several orders of magnitude in thin areas, a significant change of the solution can be observed for two very similar meshes. The mesh must be defined at best to minimize this change. To address this issue, a criterion based on polynomial interpolation on adjacent nodes is proposed that adjusts accurately the mesh to the gradients of Degrees of Freedom. Furthermore, a dynamic mesh that follows changes of DF in DC and transient mode is a powerful tool for TCAD users. But, in transient modeling, adding nodes to a mesh induces oscillations in the solution that appears as spikes at the current collected at the contacts. This paper proposes two schemes that solve this problem. Examples show that using these techniques, the dynamic mesh generator of the TCAD tool ECORCE handle semiconductors devices in DC and transient mode.\n\nDesign and spectrum calculation of 4H-SiC thermal neutron detectors using FLUKA and TCAD\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHuang, Haili; Tang, Xiaoyan; Guo, Hui; Zhang, Yimen; Zhang, Yimeng; Zhang, Yuming\n\n2016-10-01\n\nSiC is a promising material for neutron detection in a harsh environment due to its wide band gap, high displacement threshold energy and high thermal conductivity. To increase the detection efficiency of SiC, a converter such as 6LiF or 10B is introduced. In this paper, pulse-height spectra of a PIN diode with a 6LiF conversion layer exposed to thermal neutrons (0.026 eV) are calculated using TCAD and Monte Carlo simulations. First, the conversion efficiency of a thermal neutron with respect to the thickness of 6LiF was calculated by using a FLUKA code, and a maximal efficiency of approximately 5% was achieved. Next, the energy distributions of both 3H and Î± induced by the 6LiF reaction according to different ranges of emission angle are analyzed. Subsequently, transient pulses generated by the bombardment of single 3H or Î±-particles are calculated. Finally, pulse height spectra are obtained with a detector efficiency of 4.53%. Comparisons of the simulated result with the experimental data are also presented, and the calculated spectrum shows an acceptable similarity to the experimental data. This work would be useful for radiation-sensing applications, especially for SiC detector design.\n\nSimulation of SRAM SEU Sensitivity at Reduced Operating Temperatures\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSanathanamurthy, S.; Ramachandran, V.; Alles, M. L.; Reed, R. A.; Massengill, L. W.; Raman, A.; Turowski, M.; Mantooth, A.; Woods, B.; Barlow, M.;\n\n2009-01-01\n\nA new NanoTCAD-to-Spectre interface is applied to perform mixed-mode SEU simulations of an SRAM cell. Results using newly calibrated TCAD cold temperature substrate mobility models, and BSIM3 compact models extracted explicitly for the cold temperature designs, indicate a 33% reduction in SEU threshold for the range of temperatures simulated.\n\nThe Future of Electronic Device Design: Device and Process Simulation Find Intelligence on the World Wide Web\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBiegel, Bryan A.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nWe are on the path to meet the major challenges ahead for TCAD (technology computer aided design). The emerging computational grid will ultimately solve the challenge of limited computational power. The Modular TCAD Framework will solve the TCAD software challenge once TCAD software developers realize that there is no other way to meet industry's needs. The modular TCAD framework (MTF) also provides the ideal platform for solving the TCAD model challenge by rapid implementation of models in a partial differential solver.\n\nHafnium transistor process design for neural interfacing.\n\nPubMed\n\nParent, David W; Basham, Eric J\n\n2009-01-01\n\nA design methodology is presented that uses 1-D process simulations of Metal Insulator Semiconductor (MIS) structures to design the threshold voltage of hafnium oxide based transistors used for neural recording. The methodology is comprised of 1-D analytical equations for threshold voltage specification, and doping profiles, and 1-D MIS Technical Computer Aided Design (TCAD) to design a process to implement a specific threshold voltage, which minimized simulation time. The process was then verified with a 2-D process/electrical TCAD simulation. Hafnium oxide films (HfO) were grown and characterized for dielectric constant and fixed oxide charge for various annealing temperatures, two important design variables in threshold voltage design.\n\nHafnium transistor design for neural interfacing.\n\nPubMed\n\nParent, David W; Basham, Eric J\n\n2008-01-01\n\nA design methodology is presented that uses the EKV model and the g(m)/I(D) biasing technique to design hafnium oxide field effect transistors that are suitable for neural recording circuitry. The DC gain of a common source amplifier is correlated to the structural properties of a Field Effect Transistor (FET) and a Metal Insulator Semiconductor (MIS) capacitor. This approach allows a transistor designer to use a design flow that starts with simple and intuitive 1-D equations for gain that can be verified in 1-D MIS capacitor TCAD simulations, before final TCAD process verification of transistor properties. The DC gain of a common source amplifier is optimized by using fast 1-D simulations and using slower, complex 2-D simulations only for verification. The 1-D equations are used to show that the increased dielectric constant of hafnium oxide allows a higher DC gain for a given oxide thickness. An additional benefit is that the MIS capacitor can be employed to test additional performance parameters important to an open gate transistor such as dielectric stability and ionic penetration.\n\nDesign, modeling and simulation of MEMS-based silicon Microneedles\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAmin, F.; Ahmed, S.\n\n2013-06-01\n\nThe advancement in semiconductor process engineering and nano-scale fabrication technology has made it convenient to transport specific biological fluid into or out of human skin with minimum discomfort. Fluid transdermal delivery systems such as Microneedle arrays are one such emerging and exciting Micro-Electro Mechanical System (MEMS) application which could lead to a total painless fluid delivery into skin with controllability and desirable yield. In this study, we aimed to revisit the problem with modeling, design and simulations carried out for MEMS based silicon hollow out of plane microneedle arrays for biomedical applications particularly for transdermal drug delivery. An approximate 200 Î¼m length of microneedle with 40 Î¼m diameter of lumen has been successfully shown formed by isotropic and anisotropic etching techniques using MEMS Pro design tool. These microneedles are arranged in size of 2 Ã 4 matrix array with center to center spacing of 750 Î¼m. Furthermore, comparisons for fluid flow characteristics through these microneedle channels have been modeled with and without the contribution of the gravitational forces using mathematical models derived from Bernoulli Equation. Physical Process simulations have also been performed on TCAD SILVACO to optimize the design of these microneedles aligned with the standard Si-Fabrication lines.\n\nPredictive process simulation of cryogenic implants for leading edge transistor design\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGossmann, Hans-Joachim; Zographos, Nikolas; Park, Hugh\n\n2012-11-06\n\nTwo cryogenic implant TCAD-modules have been developed: (i) A continuum-based compact model targeted towards a TCAD production environment calibrated against an extensive data-set for all common dopants. Ion-specific calibration parameters related to damage generation and dynamic annealing were used and resulted in excellent fits to the calibration data-set. (ii) A Kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) model including the full time dependence of ion-exposure that a particular spot on the wafer experiences, as well as the resulting temperature vs. time profile of this spot. It was calibrated by adjusting damage generation and dynamic annealing parameters. The kMC simulations clearly demonstrate the importancemoreÂ Â» of the time-structure of the beam for the amorphization process: Assuming an average dose-rate does not capture all of the physics and may lead to incorrect conclusions. The model enables optimization of the amorphization process through tool parameters such as scan speed or beam height.Â«Â less\n\nDevice and circuit analysis of a sub 20 nm double gate MOSFET with gate stack using a look-up-table-based approach\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChakraborty, S.; Dasgupta, A.; Das, R.; Kar, M.; Kundu, A.; Sarkar, C. K.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nIn this paper, we explore the possibility of mapping devices designed in TCAD environment to its modeled version developed in cadence virtuoso environment using a look-up table (LUT) approach. Circuit simulation of newly designed devices in TCAD environment is a very slow and tedious process involving complex scripting. Hence, the LUT based modeling approach has been proposed as a faster and easier alternative in cadence environment. The LUTs are prepared by extracting data from the device characteristics obtained from device simulation in TCAD. A comparative study is shown between the TCAD simulation and the LUT-based alternative to showcase the accuracy of modeled devices. Finally the look-up table approach is used to evaluate the performance of circuits implemented using 14 nm nMOSFET.\n\nOptimum Design Rules for CMOS Hall Sensors\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCrescentini, Marco; Biondi, Michele; Romani, Aldo; Tartagni, Marco; Sangiorgi, Enrico\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis manuscript analyzes the effects of design parameters, such as aspect ratio, doping concentration and bias, on the performance of a general CMOS Hall sensor, with insight on current-related sensitivity, power consumption, and bandwidth. The article focuses on rectangular-shaped Hall probes since this is the most general geometry leading to shape-independent results. The devices are analyzed by means of 3D-TCAD simulations embedding galvanomagnetic transport model, which takes into account the Lorentz force acting on carriers due to a magnetic field. Simulation results define a set of trade-offs and design rules that can be used by electronic designers to conceive their own Hall probes.

This work elaborates a new Technology-Computer-Aided-Design (TCAD) tool for nanoelectronics modelling, which uses a sp3d5sâ tight-binding approach to describe multi-million atomic structures, and simulate electronic structures with high performance computing (HPC), including atomic effects such as alloy and dopant disorders. Being named as Quantum simulation tool for Advanced Nanoscale Devices (Q-AND), the tool shows nice scalability on traditional multi-core HPC clusters implying the strong capability of large-scale electronic structure simulations, particularly with remarkable performance enhancement on latest clusters of Intel Xeon PhiTM coprocessors. A review of the recent modelling study conducted to understand an experimental work of highly phosphorus-doped silicon nanowires, is presented to demonstrate the utility of Q-AND. Having been developed via Intel Parallel Computing Center project, Q-AND will be open to public to establish a sound framework of nanoelectronics modelling with advanced HPC clusters of a many-core base. With details of the development methodology and exemplary study of dopant electronics, this work will present a practical guideline for TCAD development to researchers in the field of computational nanoelectronics.\n\nSimulation and measurement of total ionizing dose radiation induced image lag increase in pinned photodiode CMOS image sensors\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, Jing; Chen, Wei; Wang, Zujun; Xue, Yuanyuan; Yao, Zhibin; He, Baoping; Ma, Wuying; Jin, Junshan; Sheng, Jiangkun; Dong, Guantao\n\n2017-06-01\n\nThis paper presents an investigation of total ionizing dose (TID) induced image lag sources in pinned photodiodes (PPD) CMOS image sensors based on radiation experiments and TCAD simulation. The radiation experiments have been carried out at the Cobalt -60 gamma-ray source. The experimental results show the image lag degradation is more and more serious with increasing TID. Combining with the TCAD simulation results, we can confirm that the junction of PPD and transfer gate (TG) is an important region forming image lag during irradiation. These simulations demonstrate that TID can generate a potential pocket leading to incomplete transfer.\n\n2D dark-count-rate modeling of PureB single-photon avalanche diodes in a TCAD environment\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKneÅ¾eviÄ, Tihomir; Nanver, Lis K.; Suligoj, Tomislav\n\n2018-02-01\n\nPureB silicon photodiodes have nm-shallow p+n junctions with which photons/electrons with penetration-depths of a few nanometer can be detected. PureB Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) were fabricated and analysed by 2D numerical modeling as an extension to TCAD software. The very shallow p+ -anode has high perimeter curvature that enhances the electric field. In SPADs, noise is quantified by the dark count rate (DCR) that is a measure for the number of false counts triggered by unwanted processes in the non-illuminated device. Just like for desired events, the probability a dark count increases with increasing electric field and the perimeter conditions are critical. In this work, the DCR was studied by two 2D methods of analysis: the \"quasi-2D\" (Q-2D) method where vertical 1D cross-sections were assumed for calculating the electron/hole avalanche-probabilities, and the \"ionization-integral 2D\" (II-2D) method where crosssections were placed where the maximum ionization-integrals were calculated. The Q-2D method gave satisfactory results in structures where the peripheral regions had a small contribution to the DCR, such as in devices with conventional deepjunction guard rings (GRs). Otherwise, the II-2D method proved to be much more precise. The results show that the DCR simulation methods are useful for optimizing the compromise between fill-factor and p-/n-doping profile design in SPAD devices. For the experimentally investigated PureB SPADs, excellent agreement of the measured and simulated DCR was achieved. This shows that although an implicit GR is attractively compact, the very shallow pn-junction gives a risk of having such a low breakdown voltage at the perimeter that the DCR of the device may be negatively impacted.\n\nDesign and simulation of nanoscale double-gate TFET/tunnel CNTFET\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBala, Shashi; Khosla, Mamta\n\n2018-04-01\n\nA double-gate tunnel field-effect transistor (DG tunnel FET) has been designed and investigated for various channel materials such as silicon (Si), gallium arsenide (GaAs), alminium gallium arsenide (Al x Ga1âx As) and CNT using a nano ViDES Device and TCAD SILVACO ATLAS simulator. The proposed devices are compared on the basis of inverse subthreshold slope (SS), I ON/I OFF current ratio and leakage current. Using Si as the channel material limits the property to reduce leakage current with scaling of channel, whereas the Al x Ga1âx As based DG tunnel FET provides a better I ON/I OFF current ratio (2.51 Ã 106) as compared to other devices keeping the leakage current within permissible limits. The performed silmulation of the CNT based channel in the double-gate tunnel field-effect transistor using the nano ViDES shows better performace for a sub-threshold slope of 29.4 mV/dec as the channel is scaled down. The proposed work shows the potential of the CNT channel based DG tunnel FET as a futuristic device for better switching and high retention time, which makes it suitable for memory based circuits.\n\nTechnology CAD for integrated circuit fabrication technology development and technology transfer\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSaha, Samar\n\n2003-07-01\n\nIn this paper systematic simulation-based methodologies for integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing technology development and technology transfer are presented. In technology development, technology computer-aided design (TCAD) tools are used to optimize the device and process parameters to develop a new generation of IC manufacturing technology by reverse engineering from the target product specifications. While in technology transfer to manufacturing co-location, TCAD is used for process centering with respect to high-volume manufacturing equipment of the target manufacturing equipment of the target manufacturing facility. A quantitative model is developed to demonstrate the potential benefits of the simulation-based methodology in reducing the cycle time and cost of typical technology development and technology transfer projects over the traditional practices. The strategy for predictive simulation to improve the effectiveness of a TCAD-based project, is also discussed.\n\nProgram scheme using common source lines in channel stacked NAND flash memory with layer selection by multilevel operation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKim, Do-Bin; Kwon, Dae Woong; Kim, Seunghyun; Lee, Sang-Ho; Park, Byung-Gook\n\n2018-02-01\n\nTo obtain high channel boosting potential and reduce a program disturbance in channel stacked NAND flash memory with layer selection by multilevel (LSM) operation, a new program scheme using boosted common source line (CSL) is proposed. The proposed scheme can be achieved by applying proper bias to each layer through its own CSL. Technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulations are performed to verify the validity of the new method in LSM. Through TCAD simulation, it is revealed that the program disturbance characteristics is effectively improved by the proposed scheme.\n\nNumerical simulations: Toward the design of 27.6% efficient four-terminal semi-transparent perovskite/SiC passivated rear contact silicon tandem solar cell\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPandey, Rahul; Chaujar, Rishu\n\n2016-12-01\n\nIn this work, a novel four-terminal perovskite/SiC-based rear contact silicon tandem solar cell device has been proposed and simulated to achieve 27.6% power conversion efficiency (PCE) under single AM1.5 illumination. 20.9% efficient semitransparent perovskite top subcell has been used for perovskite/silicon tandem architecture. The tandem structure of perovskite-silicon solar cells is a promising method to achieve efficient solar energy conversion at low cost. In the four-terminal tandem configuration, the cells are connected independently and hence avoids the need for current matching between top and bottom subcell, thus giving greater design flexibility. The simulation analysis shows, PCE of 27.6% and 22.4% with 300 Î¼m and 10 Î¼m thick rear contact Si bottom subcell, respectively. This is a substantial improvement comparing to transparent perovskite solar cell and c-Si solar cell operated individually. The impact of perovskite layer thickness, monomolecular, bimolecular, and trimolecular recombination have also been obtained on the performance of perovskite top subcell. Reported PCEs of 27.6% and 22.4% are 1.25 times and 1.42 times higher as compared to experimentally available efficiencies of 22.1% and 15.7% in 300 Î¼m and 10 Î¼m thick stand-alone silicon solar cell devices, respectively. The presence of SiC significantly suppressed the interface recombination in bottom silicon subcell. Detailed realistic technology computer aided design (TCAD) analysis has been performed to predict the behaviour of the device.\n\nSimulations of Operation Dynamics of Different Type GaN Particle Sensors\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGaubas, Eugenijus; Ceponis, Tomas; Kalesinskas, Vidas; Pavlov, Jevgenij; Vysniauskas, Juozas\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe operation dynamics of the capacitor-type and PIN diode type detectors based on GaN have been simulated using the dynamic and drift-diffusion models. The drift-diffusion current simulations have been implemented by employing the software package Synopsys TCAD Sentaurus. The monopolar and bipolar drift regimes have been analyzed by using dynamic models based on the Shockley-Ramo theorem. The carrier multiplication processes determined by impact ionization have been considered in order to compensate carrier lifetime reduction due to introduction of radiation defects into GaN detector material.

Thirty models of posterior-teeth-single-crown preparations were collected, and STL data of these preparations was collected by Denmark 3Shape scanner. Three copings were made for each preparation, the one designed and manufactured using commercial CAD/CAM system (3Shape CAD software and Wieland T1 CAM equipment) was assigned into control group T0, the one designed and manufactured using domestic CAD software (developed by Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology and Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics) and Wieland T1 CAM equipment was assigned into experimental group TCAD for design accuracy evaluation, and the one designed and manufactured using 3Shape CAD software and domestic CAM equipment (developed by Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, Tsinghua University and ShanDong XinHua Incorporated Company of medical apparatus and instruments) was assigned into experimental group TCAM for manufacture accuracy evaluation. Finally, the marginal fitness were compared and evaluated by using 3D & Profile measurement microscope laser. The marginal fitness of TCAD was 27.98 (19.10, 46.57) Âµm in buccal, 32.67 (20.65, 50.82) Âµm in lingual, 27.38 (22.53, 52.61) Âµm in mesial, 29.50 (22.68, 53.65) Âµm in distal; of TCAM was 21.69 (15.87, 30.21) Âµm in buccal, 18.51 (13.50, 22.51) Âµm in lingual, 19.15 (15.42, 26.89) Âµm in mesial, 22.77 (18.58, 32.15) Âµm in distal; and there were no statistical differences compared with T0 [20.16 (17.16, 48.00) Âµm in buccal, 21.51 (17.05, 28.31) Âµm in lingual, 23.54 (17.89, 30.04) Âµm in mesial and 23.94 (17.93, 28.19) Âµm in distal] except lingual data of TCAD. The design and machining precision of this domestic CAD/CAM system is at the same level of those comparable foreign products.\n\nPolycrystalline CVD diamond device level modeling for particle detection applications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMorozzi, A.; Passeri, D.; Kanxheri, K.; Servoli, L.; Lagomarsino, S.; Sciortino, S.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nDiamond is a promising material whose excellent physical properties foster its use for radiation detection applications, in particular in those hostile operating environments where the silicon-based detectors behavior is limited due to the high radiation fluence. Within this framework, the application of Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) simulation tools is highly envisaged for the study, the optimization and the predictive analysis of sensing devices. Since the novelty of using diamond in electronics, this material is not included in the library of commercial, state-of-the-art TCAD software tools. In this work, we propose the development, the application and the validation of numerical models to simulate the electrical behavior of polycrystalline (pc)CVD diamond conceived for diamond sensors for particle detection. The model focuses on the characterization of a physically-based pcCVD diamond bandgap taking into account deep-level defects acting as recombination centers and/or trap states. While a definite picture of the polycrystalline diamond band-gap is still debated, the effect of the main parameters (e.g. trap densities, capture cross-sections, etc.) can be deeply investigated thanks to the simulated approach. The charge collection efficiency due to Î² -particle irradiation of diamond materials provided by different vendors and with different electrode configurations has been selected as figure of merit for the model validation. The good agreement between measurements and simulation findings, keeping the traps density as the only one fitting parameter, assesses the suitability of the TCAD modeling approach as a predictive tool for the design and the optimization of diamond-based radiation detectors.\n\nNumerical simulation of offset-drain amorphous oxide-based thin-film transistors\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJeong, Jaewook\n\n2016-11-01\n\nIn this study, we analyzed the electrical characteristics of amorphous indium-gallium-zinc-oxide (a-IGZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs) with an offset-drain structure by technology computer aided design (TCAD) simulation. When operating in a linear region, an enhancement-type TFT shows poor field-effect mobility because most conduction electrons are trapped in acceptor-like defects in an offset region when the offset length (L off) exceeds 0.5 Âµm, whereas a depletion-type TFT shows superior field-effect mobility owing to the high free electron density in the offset region compared with the trapped electron density. When operating in the saturation region, both types of TFTs show good field-effect mobility comparable to that of a reference TFT with a large gate overlap. The underlying physics of the depletion and enhancement types of offset-drain TFTs are systematically analyzed.\n\nSingle-Event Transient Response of Comparator Pre-Amplifiers in a Complementary SiGe Technology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIldefonso, Adrian; Lourenco, Nelson E.; Fleetwood, Zachary E.; Wachter, Mason T.; Tzintzarov, George N.; Cardoso, Adilson S.; Roche, Nicolas J.-H.; Khachatrian, Ani; McMorrow, Dale; Buchner, Stephen P.; Warner, Jeffrey H.; Paki, Pauline; Kaynak, Mehmet; Tillack, Bernd; Cressler, John D.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe single-event transient (SET) response of the pre-amplification stage of two latched comparators designed using either npn or pnp silicon-germanium heterojunction bipolar transistors (SiGe HBTs) is investigated via two-photon absorption (TPA) carrier injection and mixed-mode TCAD simulations. Experimental data and TCAD simulations showed an improved SET response for the pnp comparator circuit. 2-D raster scans revealed that the devices in the pnp circuit exhibit a reduction in sensitive area of up to 80% compared to their npn counterparts. In addition, by sweeping the input voltage, the sensitive operating region with respect to SETs was determined. By establishing a figure-of-merit, relating the transient peaks and input voltage polarities, the pnp device was determined to have a 21.4% improved response with respect to input voltage. This study has shown that using pnp devices is an effective way to mitigate SETs, and could enable further radiation-hardening-by-design techniques.\n\nDevelopment of n+-in-p planar pixel sensors for extremely high radiation environments, designed to retain high efficiency after irradiation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nUnno, Y.; Kamada, S.; Yamamura, K.; Ikegami, Y.; Nakamura, K.; Takubo, Y.; Takashima, R.; Tojo, J.; Kono, T.; Hanagaki, K.; Yajima, K.; Yamauchi, Y.; Hirose, M.; Homma, Y.; Jinnouchi, O.; Kimura, K.; Motohashi, K.; Sato, S.; Sawai, H.; Todome, K.; Yamaguchi, D.; Hara, K.; Sato, Kz.; Sato, Kj.; Hagihara, M.; Iwabuchi, S.\n\n2016-09-01\n\nWe have developed n+-in-p pixel sensors to obtain highly radiation tolerant sensors for extremely high radiation environments such as those found at the high-luminosity LHC. We have designed novel pixel structures to eliminate the sources of efficiency loss under the bias rails after irradiation by removing the bias rail out of the boundary region and routing the bias resistors inside the area of the pixel electrodes. After irradiation by protons with the fluence of approximately 3 Ã1015neq /cm2, the pixel structure with the polysilicon bias resistor and the bias rails removed far away from the boundary shows an efficiency loss of < 0.5 % per pixel at the boundary region, which is as efficient as the pixel structure without a biasing structure. The pixel structure with the bias rails at the boundary and the widened p-stop's underneath the bias rail also exhibits an improved loss of approximately 1% per pixel at the boundary region. We have elucidated the physical mechanisms behind the efficiency loss under the bias rail with TCAD simulations. The efficiency loss is due to the interplay of the bias rail acting as a charge collecting electrode with the region of low electric field in the silicon near the surface at the boundary. The region acts as a \"shield\" for the electrode. After irradiation, the strong applied electric field nearly eliminates the region. The TCAD simulations have shown that wide p-stop and large Si-SiO2 interface charge (inversion layer, specifically) act to shield the weighting potential. The pixel sensor of the old design irradiated by Î³-rays at 2.4 MGy is confirmed to exhibit only a slight efficiency loss at the boundary.\n\nDesign consideration of high voltage Ga2O3 vertical Schottky barrier diode with field plate\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChoi, J.-H.; Cho, C.-H.; Cha, H.-Y.\n\n2018-06-01\n\nGallium oxide (Ga2O3) based vertical Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) were designed for high voltage switching applications. Since p-type Ga2O3 epitaxy growth or p-type ion implantation technique has not been developed yet, a field plate structure was employed in this study to maximize the breakdown voltage by suppressing the electric field at the anode edge. TCAD simulation was used for the physical analysis of Ga2O3 SBDs from which it was found that careful attention must be paid to the insulator under the field plate. Due to the extremely high breakdown field property of Ga2O3, an insulator with both high permittivity and high breakdown field must be used for the field plate formation.\n\nSimulator design for advanced ISDN satellite design and experiments\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPepin, Gerald R.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThis simulation design task completion report documents the simulation techniques associated with the network models of both the Interim Service ISDN (integrated services digital network) Satellite (ISIS) and the Full Service ISDN Satellite (FSIS) architectures. The ISIS network model design represents satellite systems like the Advanced Communication Technology Satellite (ACTS) orbiting switch. The FSIS architecture, the ultimate aim of this element of the Satellite Communications Applications Research (SCAR) program, moves all control and switching functions on-board the next generation ISDN communication satellite. The technical and operational parameters for the advanced ISDN communications satellite design will be obtained from the simulation of ISIS and FSIS engineering software models for their major subsystems. Discrete events simulation experiments will be performed with these models using various traffic scenarios, design parameters and operational procedures. The data from these simulations will be used to determine the engineering parameters for the advanced ISDN communications satellite.\n\nCo-integration of nano-scale vertical- and horizontal-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors for low power CMOS technology.\n\nPubMed\n\nSun, Min-Chul; Kim, Garam; Kim, Sang Wan; Kim, Hyun Woo; Kim, Hyungjin; Lee, Jong-Ho; Shin, Hyungcheol; Park, Byung-Gook\n\n2012-07-01\n\nIn order to extend the conventional low power Si CMOS technology beyond the 20-nm node without SOI substrates, we propose a novel co-integration scheme to build horizontal- and vertical-channel MOSFETs together and verify the idea using TCAD simulations. From the fabrication viewpoint, it is highlighted that this scheme provides additional vertical devices with good scalability by adding a few steps to the conventional CMOS process flow for fin formation. In addition, the benefits of the co-integrated vertical devices are investigated using a TCAD device simulation. From this study, it is confirmed that the vertical device shows improved off-current control and a larger drive current when the body dimension is less than 20 nm, due to the electric field coupling effect at the double-gated channel. Finally, the benefits from the circuit design viewpoint, such as the larger midpoint gain and beta and lower power consumption, are confirmed by the mixed-mode circuit simulation study.\n\nDesign and modeling of an SJ infrared solar cell approaching upper limit of theoretical efficiency\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSahoo, G. S.; Mishra, G. P.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nRecent trends of photovoltaics account for the conversion efficiency limit making them more cost effective. To achieve this we have to leave the golden era of silicon cell and make a path towards III-V compound semiconductor groups to take advantages like bandgap engineering by alloying these compounds. In this work we have used a low bandgap GaSb material and designed a single junction (SJ) cell with a conversion efficiency of 32.98%. SILVACO ATLAS TCAD simulator has been used to simulate the proposed model using both Ray Tracing and Transfer Matrix Method (under 1 sun and 1000 sun of AM1.5G spectrum). A detailed analyses of photogeneration rate, spectral response, potential developed, external quantum efficiency (EQE), internal quantum efficiency (IQE), short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF) and conversion efficiency (Î·) are discussed. The obtained results are compared with previously reported SJ solar cell reports.\n\nProcess simulation during the design process makes the difference: process simulations applied to a traditional design.\n\nPubMed\n\nTraversari, Roberto; Goedhart, Rien; Schraagen, Jan Maarten\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe objective is evaluation of a traditionally designed operating room using simulation of various surgical workflows. A literature search showed that there is no evidence for an optimal operating room layout regarding the position and size of an ultraclean ventilation (UCV) canopy with a separate preparation room for laying out instruments and in which patients are induced in the operating room itself. Neither was literature found reporting on process simulation being used for this application. Many technical guidelines and designs have mainly evolved over time, and there is no evidence on whether the proposed measures are also effective for the optimization of the layout for workflows. The study was conducted by applying observational techniques to simulated typical surgical procedures. Process simulations which included complete surgical teams and equipment required for the intervention were carried out for four typical interventions. Four observers used a form to record conflicts with the clean area boundaries and the height of the supply bridge. Preferences for particular layouts were discussed with the surgical team after each simulated procedure. We established that a clean area measuring 3 Ã 3 m and a supply bridge height of 2.05 m was satisfactory for most situations, provided a movable operation table is used. The only cases in which conflicts with the supply bridge were observed were during the use of a surgical robot (Da Vinci) and a surgical microscope. During multiple trauma interventions, bottlenecks regarding the dimensions of the clean area will probably arise. The process simulation of four typical interventions has led to significantly different operating room layouts than were arrived at through the traditional design process.

K.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nEfficient layouts have been an active area of research to accommodate the greater number of devices fabricated on a given chip area. In this work a new layout of CMOS circuit is proposed, with an aim to improve its electrical performance and reduce the chip area consumed. The study shows that the design of CMOS circuit and SRAM cells comprising tapered body reduced source fully depleted silicon on insulator (TBRS FD-SOI)-based n- and p-type MOS devices. The proposed TBRS FD-SOI n- and p-MOSFET exhibits lower sub-threshold slope and higher Ion to Ioff ratio when compared with FD-SOI MOSFET and FinFET technology. Other parameters like power dissipation, delay time and signal-to-noise margin of CMOS inverter circuits show improvement when compared with available inverter designs. The above device design is used in 6-T SRAM cell so as to see the effect of proposed layout on high density integrated circuits (ICs). The SNM obtained from the proposed SRAM cell is 565 mV which is much better than any other SRAM cell designed at 50 nm gate length MOS device. The Sentaurus TCAD device simulator is used to design the proposed MOS structure.\n\nRigorous ILT optimization for advanced patterning and design-process co-optimization\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSelinidis, Kosta; Kuechler, Bernd; Cai, Howard; Braam, Kyle; Hoppe, Wolfgang; Domnenko, Vitaly; Poonawala, Amyn; Xiao, Guangming\n\n2018-03-01\n\nDespite the large difficulties involved in extending 193i multiple patterning and the slow ramp of EUV lithography to full manufacturing readiness, the pace of development for new technology node variations has been accelerating. Multiple new variations of new and existing technology nodes have been introduced for a range of device applications; each variation with at least a few new process integration methods, layout constructs and/or design rules. This had led to a strong increase in the demand for predictive technology tools which can be used to quickly guide important patterning and design co-optimization decisions. In this paper, we introduce a novel hybrid predictive patterning method combining two patterning technologies which have each individually been widely used for process tuning, mask correction and process-design cooptimization. These technologies are rigorous lithography simulation and inverse lithography technology (ILT). Rigorous lithography simulation has been extensively used for process development/tuning, lithography tool user setup, photoresist hot-spot detection, photoresist-etch interaction analysis, lithography-TCAD interactions/sensitivities, source optimization and basic lithography design rule exploration. ILT has been extensively used in a range of lithographic areas including logic hot-spot fixing, memory layout correction, dense memory cell optimization, assist feature (AF) optimization, source optimization, complex patterning design rules and design-technology co-optimization (DTCO). The combined optimization capability of these two technologies will therefore have a wide range of useful applications. We investigate the benefits of the new functionality for a few of these advanced applications including correction for photoresist top loss and resist scumming hotspots.\n\n3D detectors with high space and time resolution\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLoi, A.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nFor future high luminosity LHC experiments it will be important to develop new detector systems with increased space and time resolution and also better radiation hardness in order to operate in high luminosity environment. A possible technology which could give such performances is 3D silicon detectors. This work explores the possibility of a pixel geometry by designing and simulating different solutions, using Sentaurus Tecnology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) as design and simulation tool, and analysing their performances. A key factor during the selection was the generated electric field and the carrier velocity inside the active area of the pixel.\n\nA Physics-Based Engineering Methodology for Calculating Soft Error Rates of Bulk CMOS and SiGe Heterojunction Bipolar Transistor Integrated Circuits\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFulkerson, David E.\n\n2010-02-01\n\nThis paper describes a new methodology for characterizing the electrical behavior and soft error rate (SER) of CMOS and SiGe HBT integrated circuits that are struck by ions. A typical engineering design problem is to calculate the SER of a critical path that commonly includes several circuits such as an input buffer, several logic gates, logic storage, clock tree circuitry, and an output buffer. Using multiple 3D TCAD simulations to solve this problem is too costly and time-consuming for general engineering use. The new and simple methodology handles the problem with ease by simple SPICE simulations. The methodology accurately predicts the measured threshold linear energy transfer (LET) of a bulk CMOS SRAM. It solves for circuit currents and voltage spikes that are close to those predicted by expensive 3D TCAD simulations. It accurately predicts the measured event cross-section vs. LET curve of an experimental SiGe HBT flip-flop. The experimental cross section vs. frequency behavior and other subtle effects are also accurately predicted.\n\nSimulation and Spacecraft Design: Engineering Mars Landings.\n\nPubMed\n\nConway, Erik M\n\n2015-10-01\n\nA key issue in history of technology that has received little attention is the use of simulation in engineering design. This article explores the use of both mechanical and numerical simulation in the design of the Mars atmospheric entry phases of the Viking and Mars Pathfinder missions to argue that engineers used both kinds of simulation to develop knowledge of their designs' likely behavior in the poorly known environment of Mars. Each kind of simulation could be used as a warrant of the other's fidelity, in an iterative process of knowledge construction.\n\nDesign of object-oriented distributed simulation classes\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSchoeffler, James D.

The project is called NPSS, an acronym for 'Numerical Propulsion Simulation System'. NPSS is a flexible object-oriented simulation of aircraft engines requiring high computing speed. It is desirable to run the simulation on a distributed computer system with multiple processors executing portions of the simulation in parallel. The purpose of this research was to investigate object-oriented structures such that individual objects could be distributed. The set of classes used in the simulation must be designed to facilitate parallel computation. Since the portions of the simulation carried out in parallel are not independent of one another, there is the need for communication among the parallel executing processors which in turn implies need for their synchronization. Communication and synchronization can lead to decreased throughput as parallel processors wait for data or synchronization signals from other processors. As a result of this research, the following have been accomplished. The design and implementation of a set of simulation classes which result in a distributed simulation control program have been completed.

A key component in these simulated reactors is the thermal simulator, designed to closely mimic the form and function of a nuclear fuel pin using electric heating. Continuing effort has been made to design simple, robust, inexpensive thermal simulators that closely match the steady-state and transient performance of a nuclear fuel pin. A series of these simulators have been designed, developed, fabricated and tested individually and in a number of simulated reactor systems at the EFF-TF. The purpose of the thermal simulators developed under the Fission Surface Power (FSP) task is to ensure that non-nuclear testing can be performed at sufficiently high fidelity to allow a cost-effective qualification and acceptance strategy to be used. Prototype thermal simulator design is founded on the baseline Fission Surface Power reactor design. Recent efforts have been focused on the design, fabrication and test of a prototype thermal simulator appropriate for use in the Technology Demonstration Unit (TDU). While designing the thermal simulators described in this paper, effort were made to improve the axial power profile matching of the thermal simulators. Simultaneously, a search was conducted for graphite materials with higher resistivities than had been employed in the past. The combination of these two efforts resulted in the creation of thermal simulators with power capacities of 2300-3300 W per unit. Six of these elements were installed in a simulated core and tested in the alkali metal-cooled Fission Surface Power Primary Test Circuit (FSP-PTC) at a variety of liquid metal flow rates and temperatures. This paper documents the design of the thermal simulators, test program, and test results.\n\nAn accurate behavioral model for single-photon avalanche diode statistical performance simulation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nXu, Yue; Zhao, Tingchen; Li, Ding\n\n2018-01-01\n\nAn accurate behavioral model is presented to simulate important statistical performance of single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs), such as dark count and after-pulsing noise. The derived simulation model takes into account all important generation mechanisms of the two kinds of noise. For the first time, thermal agitation, trap-assisted tunneling and band-to-band tunneling mechanisms are simultaneously incorporated in the simulation model to evaluate dark count behavior of SPADs fabricated in deep sub-micron CMOS technology. Meanwhile, a complete carrier trapping and de-trapping process is considered in afterpulsing model and a simple analytical expression is derived to estimate after-pulsing probability. In particular, the key model parameters of avalanche triggering probability and electric field dependence of excess bias voltage are extracted from Geiger-mode TCAD simulation and this behavioral simulation model doesn't include any empirical parameters. The developed SPAD model is implemented in Verilog-A behavioral hardware description language and successfully operated on commercial Cadence Spectre simulator, showing good universality and compatibility. The model simulation results are in a good accordance with the test data, validating high simulation accuracy.\n\nTelecom Link--A Competitive Simulated Design Exercise.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nFreeman, J.; Allen, J.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nTelecom link is a structured design exercise concerned with building a telecommunications link between London and Amsterdam.

The goal is to enable a style of design with simulations that feels as-direct-as-possible so users can concentrate on creative design tasks. The approach integrates forward design via direct manipulation of simulation inputs (e.g., geometric properties, applied forces) in the same visual space with inverse design via âtuggingâ and reshaping simulation outputs (e.g., scalar fields from finite element analysis (FEA) or computational fluid dynamics (CFD)). The interface includes algorithms for interpreting the intent of usersâ drag operations relative to parameterized models, morphing arbitrary scalar fields output from FEA and CFD simulations, and in-place interactive ensemble visualization. The inverse design strategy can be extended to use multi-touch input in combination with an as-rigid-as-possible shape manipulation to support rich visual queries. The potential of this new design approach is confirmed via two applications: medical device engineering of a vacuum-assisted biopsy device and visual effects design using a physically based flame simulation.

In a 3DOSED, the trench electrode can be etched all the way through the detector thickness, totally eliminating the low electric field region existed in the conventional 3D-Trench-Electrode detector. Full 3D technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulations have been done on this novel silicon detector structure. Through comparing of the simulation results of the detector, we can obtain the best design of the 3SOSED. In addition, simulation results show that, as compared to the conventional 3D detector, the proposed 3DOSED can improve not only detector charge collection efficiency but also its radiation hardness with regard to solving the trapping problem in the detector bulk. What is more, it has been shown that detector full depletion voltage is also slightly reduced, which can improve the utility aspects of the detector. When compared to the conventional 3D detector, we find that the proposed novel 3DOSED structure has better electric potential and electric field distributions, and better electrical properties such as detector full depletion voltage. In 3DOSED array, each pixel cell is isolated from each other by highly doped trenches, but also electrically and physically connected with each other through the remaining silicon bulk between broken electrodes.\n\nDesign-Based Comparison of Spine Surgery Simulators: Optimizing Educational Features of Surgical Simulators.\n\nPubMed\n\nRyu, Won Hyung A; Mostafa, Ahmed E; Dharampal, Navjit; Sharlin, Ehud; Kopp, Gail; Jacobs, W Bradley; Hurlbert, R John; Chan, Sonny; Sutherland, Garnette R\n\n2017-10-01\n\nSimulation-based education has made its entry into surgical residency training, particularly as an adjunct to hands-on clinical experience. However, one of the ongoing challenges to wide adoption is the capacity of simulators to incorporate educational features required for effective learning. The aim of this study was to identify strengths and limitations of spine simulators to characterize design elements that are essential in enhancing resident education. We performed a mixed qualitative and quantitative cohort study with a focused survey and interviews of stakeholders in spine surgery pertaining to their experiences on 3 spine simulators. Ten participants were recruited spanning all levels of training and expertise until qualitative analysis reached saturation of themes. Participants were asked to perform lumbar pedicle screw insertion on 3 simulators. Afterward, a 10-item survey was administrated and a focused interview was conducted to explore topics pertaining to the design features of the simulators. Overall impressions of the simulators were positive with regards to their educational benefit, but our qualitative analysis revealed differing strengths and limitations. Main design strengths of the computer-based simulators were incorporation of procedural guidance and provision of performance feedback. The synthetic model excelled in achieving more realistic haptic feedback and incorporating use of actual surgical tools. Stakeholders from trainees to experts acknowledge the growing role of simulation-based education in spine surgery. However, different simulation modalities have varying design elements that augment learning in distinct ways. Characterization of these design characteristics will allow for standardization of simulation curricula in spinal surgery, optimizing educational benefit. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

A recently proposed EHB TFET exploits a bias-induced band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) across the electron-hole bilayer by an electric field from the top and bottom gates. This is in contrast to conventional planar p(+)-p(-)-n TFETs, which utilize BTBT across the source-to-channel junction. We applied III-V compound semiconductor materials to the EHB TFETs in order to enhance the current drivability and switching performance. Devices based on various compound semiconductor materials have been designed and analyzed in terms of their primary DC characteristics. In addition, the operational principles were validated by close examination of the electron concentrations and energy-band diagrams under various operation conditions. The simulation results of the optimally designed In0.533Ga0.47As EHB TFET show outstanding performance, with an on-state current (Ion) of 249.5 Î¼A/Î¼m, subthreshold swing (S) of 11.4 mV/dec, and threshold voltage (Vth) of 50 mV at VDS = 0.5 V. Based on the DC-optimized InGaAs EHB TFET, the CMOS inverter circuit was simulated in views of static and dynamic behaviors of the p-channel device with exchanges between top and bottom gates or between source and drain electrodes maintaining the device structure.\n\nDesign and simulation of a gyroklystron amplifier\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nChauhan, M.

In addition, a practicalmoreÂ Â» problem of misalignment of the RF cavities with drift tubes within the tube has been also investigated and its effect on device performance studied. The analytical and simulation results confirmed the validity of the gyroklystron device design. The PIC simulation results of the present gyroklystron produced a stable RF output power of â¼218âkW for 0% velocity spread at 35âGHz, with â¼45âdB gain, 37% efficiency, and a bandwidth of 0.3% for a 70âkV, 8.2âA gyrating electron beam. The simulated values of RF output power have been found in agreement with the nonlinear analysis results within â¼5%. Further, the PIC simulation has been extended to study a practical problem of misalignment of the cavities axis and drift tube axis of the gyroklystron amplifier and found that the RF output power is more sensitive to misalignments in comparison to the device bandwidth. The present paper, gyroklystron device design, nonlinear analysis, and 3D PIC simulation using commercially available code had been systematically described would be of use to the high-power gyro-amplifier tube designers and research scientists.Â«Â less\n\nFlexible Multi-Body Spacecraft Simulator: Design, Construction, and Experiments\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2017-12-01\n\nBODY SPACECRAFT SIMULATOR: DESIGN , CONSTRUCTION, AND EXPERIMENTS by Adam L.

There is a need to develop new possibilities for learning this crucial competence area. In addition, educators need to be future oriented; they need to be able to design and adopt new pedagogical innovations. The purpose of the study is to describe the development process and to generate principles for the design of nursing simulation games. A design-based research methodology is applied in this study. Iterative cycles of analysis, design, development, testing and refinement were conducted via collaboration among researchers, educators, students, and game designers. The study facilitated the generation of reusable design principles for simulation games to guide future designers when designing and developing simulation games for learning clinical reasoning. This study makes a major contribution to research on simulation game development in the field of nursing education. The results of this study provide important insights into the significance of involving nurse educators in the design and development process of educational simulation games for the purpose of nursing education.

The approach considers 2-D mixed boundary conditions and multi-zone techniques to provide an exact analytical solution to 2-D Poisson's equation. The Fourier coefficients are calculated correctly to derive the potential equations that are further used to model the channel current and subthreshold slope of the device. The threshold voltage roll-off is computed from parallel shifts of Ids-Vgs curves between the long channel and short-channel devices. It is observed that the green's function approach of solving 2-D Poisson's equation in both oxide and silicon region can accurately predict channel potential, subthreshold current (Isub), threshold voltage (Vt) roll-off and subthreshold slope (SS) of both long & short channel devices designed with different doping concentrations and higher as well as lower tsi/tox ratio. All the analytical model results are verified through comparisons with TCAD Sentaurus simulation results. It is observed that the model matches quite well with TCAD device simulations.\n\nNREL: News - Solar Decathlon Design Presentation and Simulation Results\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nAnnounced Design Presentation and Simulation Results Announced Monday, September 30, 2002 took first place in the Design Presentation and Simulation Contest at the Solar Village on the National Tech in third.

A previously developed simulation is modified to include models of the DC drive motors, the motor driver circuits and their transmissions. The application of this simulation to the design and development of the robot is discussed. The mechanisms thought to be responsible for the leg coordination of the walking stick insect were previously applied to control the straight-line locomotion of a robot. We generalized these rules for a robot walking on a plane. This biologically-inspired control strategy is used to control the robot in simulation.

The simulator mimics the qualitative behavior and data couplings occurring among the subsystems of a complex engineering system. It eliminates the engineering analyses in the subsystems by replacing them with judiciously chosen analytical functions. With the cost of analysis eliminated, the simulator is used for experimentation with a large variety of candidate algorithms for multilevel design optimization to choose the best ones for the actual application. Thus, the simulator serves as a development tool for multilevel design optimization strategy.

Although much success on this front has been achieved, design success rates remain low, an ever-present reminder of our limited understanding of the relationship between amino acid sequences and the structures they adopt. In addition to experimental techniques and rational design strategies, computational methods have been employed to aid in the design and engineering of proteins. Molecular dynamics (MD) is one such method that simulates the motions of proteins according to classical dynamics. Here, we review how insights into protein dynamics derived from MD simulations have influenced the design of proteins. One of the greatest strengths of MD is its capacity to reveal information beyond what is available in the static structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank. In this regard simulations can be used to directly guide protein design by providing atomistic details of the dynamic molecular interactions contributing to protein stability and function. MD simulations can also be used as a virtual screening tool to rank, select, identify, and assess potential designs. MD is uniquely poised to inform protein design efforts where the application requires realistic models of protein dynamics and atomic level descriptions of the relationship between dynamics and function. Here, we review cases where MD simulations was used to modulate protein stability and protein function by providing information regarding the conformation(s), conformational transitions, interactions, and dynamics that govern stability and function. In addition, we discuss cases where conformations from protein folding/unfolding simulations have been exploited for protein design, yielding novel outcomes that could not be obtained from static structures.\n\nInsights from molecular dynamics simulations for computational protein design\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChilders, Matthew Carter; Daggett, Valerie\n\n2017-01-01\n\nA grand challenge in the field of structural biology is to design and engineer proteins that exhibit targeted functions.

Brahms was originally conceived as a business process design tool that simulates work practices, including social systems of work. We describe our modeling and simulation method for mission operations work systems design, based on a research case study in which we used Brahms to design mission operations for a proposed discovery mission to the Moon. We then describe the results of an actual method application project-the Brahms Mars Exploration Rover. Space mission operations are similar to operations of traditional organizations; we show that the application of Brahms for space mission operations design is relevant and transferable to other types of business processes in organizations.\n\nLearning Reverse Engineering and Simulation with Design Visualization\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHemsworth, Paul J.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe Design Visualization (DV) group supports work at the Kennedy Space Center by utilizing metrology data with Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models and simulations to provide accurate visual representations that aid in decision-making.

Government with the community can utilize and optimize this technology to increase the electrification ratio up to 100% in all corners of Indonesia. Because of its modular and practical nature, making this technology easy to apply. One of the latest imported products that have started to be offered and sold in Indonesia but not yet widely used for solar power generation is the kind of smartflower. Before using the product, it is of course very important and immediately to undertake an in-depth study of the utilization, use, maintenance, repair, component supply and fabrication. The best way to know the above is through a review of the design and simulation. To meet this need, this paper presents a solar-smartflower design and then simulated using the facilities available in the solidwork program. Solid simulation express is a tool that serves to create power simulation of a design part modelling. With the simulation is very helpful at all to reduce errors in making design. Accurate or not a design created is also influenced by several other factors such as material objects, the silent part of the part, and the load given. The simulation is static simulation and body battery drop test, and based on the results of this simulation is known that the design results have been very satisfactory.\n\nPermittivity and temperature effects on rectification performance of self-switching diodes with different geometrical structures using two-dimensional device simulator\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZakaria, N. F.; Kasjoo, S. R.; Zailan, Z.; Isa, M. M.; Taking, S.; Arshad, M. K. M.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nCharacterization on an InGaAs-based self-switching diode (SSD) using technology computer aided design (TCAD) aimed for optimizing the electrical rectification performance of the device is reported. The rectifying performance is mainly contributed by a parameter known as the curvature coefficient which is derived from the current-voltage (I-V) behavior of the device. As such, the curvature coefficient of SSD was analyzed in this work, not only by varying the device's geometrical structure, but also by implementing different dielectric relative permittivity of the device's trenches, ranging from 1.0 to 10. Furthermore, the simulations were performed under temperature range of 300-600 K. The results showed that increased temperature degraded the SSD's rectifying performance due to increased reverse current which can deteriorate the nonlinearity of the device's I-V characteristic. Moreover, an improved curvature coefficient can be achieved using silicon dioxide (â¼3.9) as the SSD trenches. The cut-off frequency of SSD with zero-bias curvature coefficient of â¼30 V-1 attained in this work was approximately 80 GHz, operating at unbiased condition. The results obtained can assist the design of SSD to efficiently operate as rectifiers at microwave and terahertz frequencies.\n\nSpinning Rocket Simulator Turntable Design\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMiles, Robert W.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nContained herein is the research and data acquired from the Turntable Design portion of the Spinning Rocket Simulator (SRS) project. The SRS Project studies and eliminates the effect of coning on thrust-propelled spacecraft. This design and construction of the turntable adds a structural support for the SRS model and two degrees of freedom. The two degrees of freedom, radial and circumferential, will help develop a simulated thrust force perpendicular to the plane of the spacecraft model while undergoing an unstable coning motion. The Turntable consists of a ten-foot linear track mounted to a sprocket and press-fit to a thrust bearing. A two-inch high column grounded by a Triangular Baseplate supports this bearing and houses the slip rings and pressurized, air-line swivel. The thrust bearing allows the entire system to rotate under the moment applied through the chain-driven sprocket producing a circumferential degree of freedom. The radial degree of freedom is given to the model through the helically threaded linear track. This track allows the Model Support and Counter Balance to simultaneously reposition according to the coning motion of the Model. Two design factors that hinder the linear track are bending and twist due to torsion. A Standard Aluminum \"C\" channel significantly reduces these two deflections. Safety considerations dictate the design of all the components involved in this project.\n\nSimulation, Design Abstraction, and SystemC\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nHarcourt, Ed\n\n2007-01-01\n\nSystemC is a system-level design and simulation language based on C++.

At present, DREO has a 1 m EMP simulator for testing computer terminal size equipment. To develop the R and D capability for testing larger objects, such as a helicopter, a much bigger threat level facility is required. This report concerns the design of a bounded wave EMP simulator suitable for testing large size equipment. Different types of simulators are described and their pros and cons are discussed. A bounded wave parallel plate type simulator is chosen for it's efficiency and the least environmental impact. Detailed designs are given for 6 m and 10 m parallel plate type wire grid simulators. Electromagnetic fields inside and outside the simulators are computed. Preliminary specifications for a pulse generator required for the simulator are also given. Finally, the electromagnetic fields radiated from the simulator are computed and discussed.\n\nSimulation of planar single-gate Si tunnel FET with average subthreshold swing of less than 60 mV/decade for 0.3 V operation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKukita, Kentaro; Uechi, Tadayoshi; Shimokawa, Junji; Goto, Masakazu; Yokota, Yoshinori; Kawanaka, Shigeru; Tanamoto, Tetsufumi; Tanimoto, Hiroyoshi; Takagi, Shinichi\n\n2018-04-01\n\nPlanar single-gate (SG) silicon (Si) tunnel field effect transistors (TFETs) are attracting interest for ultra-low voltage operation and CMOS applications. For the achievement of subthreshold swing (S.S.) less than thermal limit of Si MOSFETs (S.S. = 60 mV/decade at 300 K), previous studies have proposed the formation of a pocket region, which needs very difficult implantation process. In this work, a planar SG Si TFET without pocket was proposed by using the technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulations. An average S.S. of less than 60 mV/decade for 0.3 V (= V gs = V ds) operation was obtained. It is found that both low average S.S.

A.; Ivezic, Z.; Jones, L.; LSST Collaboration\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe LSST Project has developed an operations simulator to investigate how best to observe the sky to achieve its multiple science goals. The simulator has a sophisticated model of the telescope and dome to properly constrain potential observing cadences. This model has also proven useful for investigating various engineering issues ranging from sizing of slew motors, to design of cryogen lines to the camera. The simulator is capable of balancing cadence goals from multiple science programs, and attempts to minimize time spent slewing as it carries out these goals. The operations simulator has been used to demonstrate a 'universal' cadence which delivers the science requirements for a deep cosmology survey, a Near Earth Object Survey and good sampling in the time domain. We will present the results of simulating 10 years of LSST operations using realistic seeing distributions, historical weather data, scheduled engineering downtime and current telescope and camera parameters. These simulations demonstrate the capability of the LSST to deliver a 25,000 square degree survey probing the time domain including 20,000 square degrees for a uniform deep, wide, fast survey, while effectively surveying for NEOs over the same area. We will also present our plans for future development of the simulator--better global minimization of slew time and eventual transition to a scheduler for the real LSST.\n\nComputer Simulation For Design Of TWT's\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBartos, Karen F.; Fite, E.
