Our Japanese group visited the Prime Minister of Bhutan, Mr. Jigme Thinley at Tashichho Dzong where they have the highest ranked Buddhist temple in their country.

We introduced him to the mission of The World Peace Prayer Society and gave him a desk top Peace Pole as our gift from our heart.

Mr. Thinley informed us that after the largest earthquake occurrence in Japan, this past March; the VIPs in their government and embassies in their country gave a memorial ceremony for the victims of Japan. I was so moved to hear that.

Peace Pole Dedication at Schools in Paolo City-BHUTAN

We also visited Lango Elementary School and Lango Junior High School in Paolo City and gave them an 8 foot tall Peace Pole as our gift.

The Principal of the school had great consciousness for Peace and understood our purpose very well.

We enjoyed World Peace Flag Ceremonies with students after Peace Pole dedication ceremony in each school.

The students are so pure and their smiles are so bright!!

May Peace Prevail on Earth.
