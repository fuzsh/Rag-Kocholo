        "text": "Voting system Majority: Single member plurality system (\"first past the post\")\n\nElections are held in two rounds. In the \"primary round\" (first round), Bhutanese vote for the political party of their choice. In the \"general election\" (second round), the two political parties that obtain the highest number of votes in the primary round field their candidates.\n\nVacancies arising between general elections are filled through by elections.\n\nVoting is not compulsory. Voter requirements - Bhutanese citizenship, including through naturalization\n\n- Age: at least 18 years old on election day\n\n- Residence in the constituency at least one year prior to election\n\nQualified voters who are on diplomatic assignments, working in Bhutanese Embassies, on special duty abroad, their spouses and dependants, civil servants, students and those serving in the armed forces, officials on election duty and voters specifically permitted by the Election Commission in consultation with the government can vote through postal ballots.\n\nDisqualifications:\n\n- Persons of unsound mind and stands so declared by a competent court\n\n- Persons disqualified from voting under the Election Act or any other law in force in Bhutan. Eligibility - Bhutanese citizenship\n\n- Age: minimum of 25 years and maximum of 65 years at the time of registration\n\n- Registration in the constituency concerned\n\n- University degree\n\n- Members of political parties\n\nIneligibilities:\n\n- Members of the Royal Family\n\n- Serving members of the armed forces\n\n- Serving civil servants\n\n- Clergymen\n\n- Persons registered under Religious Organizations Act\n\n- Serving executives and members of the Electoral Commission\n\n- Persons married to non-Bhutanese nationals\n\n- Conviction for crime, bribery, or electoral offence\n\n- Persons who are mentally unfit or specifically barred from voting under the laws of the country. Timing and scope of renewal Mr. Tshering Tobgay's People's Democratic Party (PDP) won an absolute majority, taking 32 of the National Assembly's 47 seats, whereas it had only won two seats in the 2008 elections. Although it was leading after the primary round (see note), Prime Minister Jigme Thinley's Druk Phuensum Tshogpa (DPT) saw its share fall from 45 to 15 seats.\n\nThe 2013 election was the second election in the history of parliamentary democracy in Bhutan. Initially five parties, including three new parties, were registered for the elections. However, only four parties contested the primary round as one party did not fulfill the criteria of furnishing a list of all 47 candidates to the Election Commission of Bhutan.\n\nOn 28 July, the new government, which comprised the first-ever woman minister in Bhutan, was formed with Mr. Tshering Tobgay (PDP) as the Prime Minister. The 2013 elections were declared as being free and fair by international election observers.\n\nNote:\n\nFour parties contested the primary round in May 2013, in which the ruling DPT won 44.52 per cent of the votes against the PDP's 32.53 per cent. Only the two leading parties in the primary elections contest the second (general) round of elections to the National Assembly."
