        "meta_description": "Gross National Happiness: Jigme Thinley — Interview with Jigme Thinley, the first democratically elected prime minister of Bhutan. While in office the Thinley government was dedicated to Gross National Happiness (GNH), an idea that was born in the early 1970s when Bhutan's fourth King, an absolute monarch, drew international attention by commenting that \"gross national happiness\" was more important than gross national product. His government steadfastly pursued that objective for the next three decades. Thinley's tenure as prime minister was characterized by his thoughtful engagement with the modern world\"”an engagement that brought improvements in areas like health and education, while preserving Bhutan's ancient culture and protecting its magnificent environment.",
