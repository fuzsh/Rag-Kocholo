        "text": "Track your acceleration to Net Positive Hospitality, with the Sustainable Hospitality Alliance's new Progress Tracker. The Tracker has been developed in #collaboration with EY, as a response to the lack of #consistency and #harmonisation among #sustainability frameworks across the sector, which is increasingly significant. Through the development of this new tracking tool and the digital Pathway, we aim to reduce complexity and unite the multitude of existing and emerging #sustainabilityframeworks and align with #regulations and initiatives, serving as a #baseline for further #developments and #standardisation. By joining our collective journey to #NetPositiveHospitality and using this new tool to further understand and benchmark their progress, #hospitalitycompanies can demonstrate the action they are taking to accelerate towards a more #sustainable future â€“ attracting new #customers and #investors, as well as differentiating themselves from the competition. Access the tool within the digital Pathway to #NetPositiveHospitality: https://lnkd.in/e3vQXtw3 #NetPositive #SustainabilityProgres #SustainabilityReporting #SustainabilityMeasurement\n\nDear network, These past few weeks have been a blast for me. I defended my thesis in which I explored the perceptions and contributions of tourists towards the enhancement of well-being of local communities in the Netherlands and I was awarded with a grade of 8,50. In this way, I finished my studies and received my Bachelor's diploma in International Tourism Management at Breda University of Applied Sciences. I want to thank my supervisor Jelena FarkiÄ‡ for helping me throughout the process and for being an amazing teacher and person. I would also like to express my gratitude to Mr. Paul Rogers from Planet Happiness for allowing me to research this interesting topic. My time at BUas meant a lot of work, but it also meant immersing into the tourism industry, creating a network, making friendships and having fun. I also had the opportunity to do two internships and work with amazing people. One of my internships was in Malta, where I worked in HR for Corinthia hotel. There, I saw \"the backstage\" action and learned how crucial it is for the success of a company to maintain the happiness and well-being of its employees. I want to thank Darren Darmanin, Francesca Pilocane and Lacey Meli for all they taught me and for being amazing people. My minor in Sustainability, Social Responsibility and Professional identity led me to my second internship at Green Destinations. There, I helped among others, organizing a global leaders meeting, where sustainable practices were shared and future plans were discussed. It was very interesting to see how countries' representatives strive for a better, more resilient tourism industry. Thank you Patricia Marull for all you taught me and for all the help afterwards. Thank you Albert Salman and Hugo de Jong for the interesting discussions and support. Last but not least, I want to thank my family, my boyfriend and my friends for all the support they showed me throughout all these years. My journey at BUas will continue in September, when I will start my Master in Tourism Destination Management. I am really excited to learn more and form new connections. Cheers to the future! ðŸ¥‚ðŸŽ‰"
