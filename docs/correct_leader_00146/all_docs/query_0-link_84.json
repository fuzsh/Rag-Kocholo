From 1983 to 2006 Bhutan was one of the priority countries of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). At present the SDC's work in Bhutan is focussing on good governance projects aimed at helping the country in its transition to a democratic state. A sum of some 8 million francs has been budgeted for the period 2008-2013. The SDC's projects include in particular setting up a judicial system (training for judges and administrative staff) and a committee for fighting corruption, as well as a decentralisation programme.\n\nIn view of the fact that respect for human rights is closely linked to the introduction of democracy, Mrs Calmy-Rey expressed her pleasure that the death penalty had been abolished in Bhutan in 2004. This Himalayan kingdom is one of the first countries in Asia to join the group of nations that have abolished capital punishment. The situation of minorities and refugees was also addressed.\n\nDuring their talks, Mrs Calmy-Rey and Mr Thinley also discussed the environment and the consequences of climate change in mountain areas. For the past 20 years Switzerland has been helping to fund the ICIMOD (International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development), based in Kathmandu (Nepal), which monitors sustainable development in mountain areas in eight countries within the Himalayas region, including Bhutan. A budget of CHF 5 million has been earmarked by the Confederation to support this institute for the period 2008-2012.\n\nFollowing his meeting with Mrs Calmy-Rey, the Bhutanese Prime Minister met with Swiss President Doris Leuthard for a courtesy visit. A courtesy visit was also planned with the President of the National Council Pascale Bruderer Wyss.\n\nAfter his talks with Mrs Calmy-Rey, the Bhutanese Prime Minister met Federal Councillor Moritz Leuenberger in Zurich on Sunday, Mr Jigme Thinley took this opportunity to present the concept that his country has drawn up, entitled \"Gross National Happiness\", an indicator that goes beyond the economic figures that determine gross national product and encompasses additional aspects such as the promotion of culture and protection of the environment.\n\nSource: FDFA, October 2010\n\ntop\n\nOfficial working visit by the Foreign Minister of Bhutan to Switzerland\n\n03 February 2006\n\nThe official programme included a working meeting in Von Wattenwyl-Haus and a luncheon. Among the topics of discussion were bilateral relations as well as current international and regional political issues.\n\nSwitzerland and Bhutan have maintained diplomatic relations since 1985. In the context of its co-operation with Bhutan, Switzerland supports several development projects there, in particular in the areas of education and culture as well as rural infrastructure. This year, Switzerland's budget for development co-operation in Bhutan amounts to CHF 7.3 million.\n\nSource: FDFA 2006\n\nInformation on Bhutan\n\nSwitzerland (english) Schweiz (german)\n\nBhutan Tourism Topics Bhutan Visitor Information Religion in Bhutan People in Bhutan Culture in Bhutan Motor Biking Tshechu Festivals Trekkings\n\nBhutan Information on natural hazards Bhutan's Glacial Lakes Climate Change\n\nAbout\n\nBumthang About\n\nLhuentse and Mongar About\n\nTrashigang About\n\nGasa-Laya-Lingzhi-Lunana About\n\nThimphu About\n\nTrongsa and Zhemgang About\n\nParo and Haa About\n\nWangduephodrang About\n\nPunakha About\n\nTrashiyangtse-Yangtse About\n\nSouthern Bhutan\n\nPhoto Galleries\n\nDzongs and Monasteries in Bhutan East-West-Highway by motorbike Dochula - Druk Wangyal Khangzang Chhortens\n\nBhutan Photo Galleries\n\nVideos\n\nVideos: Rafting, Tshechu, Motor Biking, Roads ...\n\nLinks\n\nExternal links"
