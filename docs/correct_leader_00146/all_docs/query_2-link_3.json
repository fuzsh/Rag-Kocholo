        "text": "National Assembly elections were held in Bhutan for the first time on 24 March 2008.[1] Two parties were registered by the Election Commission of Bhutan to contest the elections; Druk Phuensum Tshogpa, led by Jigme Y. Thinley, which was formed by the merger of the Bhutan People's United Party and All People's Party,[2] and the People's Democratic Party (PDP). A third political party, the Bhutan National Party (BNP),[3] had its application for the registration refused.\n\nThe elections for the 47 seats of the National Assembly were planned to be held in two rounds: In the first round, voters would have voted for a party. The two parties with the largest share of the national vote would then have been able to field candidates in the 47 constituencies.[4] However, as only two parties had successfully registered for the election, the election was held in one round.[1]\n\nThe Electoral Commission first experimented with elections with a mock election at the Paro College of Education. This involved the college's faculty and students as candidates and voters. The first round was conducted on 8 September 2006, and the second round was conducted on 9 September. 620 voters in 2 polling stations voted for one of six 'dummy' political parties using Electronic Voting Machines.[5]\n\nIn the first round, turnout was 96%, and it was 87% in the second round. The two parties which proceeded to the second round were the Bhutan Forward Party, and the Druk Unity Party.\n\nPartyPrimary roundGeneral roundVotes%Votes%Bhutan Forward24541.3929554.43Druk Unity9315.7124745.57National Freedom7612.84Druk Socialist Party7512.67Bhutan Democratic Party6210.47Druk Yarphel Party416.93Total592100.00542100.00Registered voters/turnout620–620–Source: ECB\n\nOn 21 April 2007 a mock election was held to prepare the population of Bhutan for the imminent change to democracy. These elections were held in all 47 National Assembly constituencies and at 869 polling stations with around 1,000 voters at each one of them.[6] The parties \"contesting\" the election were the Druk Blue Party, the Druk Green Party, the Druk Red Party and the Druk Yellow Party (with Druk being Dzongkha for \"thunder dragon\"). Each \"party\" represented certain values as their \"party manifesto\": yellow for traditional values, red for industrial development, blue for fairness and accountability, and green for the environment. The two parties winning the most votes were to proceed to a run-off election scheduled for 28 May.[7]\n\nElection observers were present from the United Nations and from India.[8]\n\nThe results of the first round saw the Druk Yellow Party receive a plurality of the vote.[9][10][5] The Druk Yellow and Druk Red parties proceeded to the second, or general, round. These two parties put up randomly chosen high school students as candidates in the 47 constituencies in the second round on 28 May 2007. The Druk Yellow Party swept the vote and won 46 of the 47 constituencies, with the Druk Red Party winning the Bartsham-Shongphu constituency.[11] Turnout in the second round was 66%.[12]\n\n246,146 people had registered to vote, though it is considered likely that a total of 400,000 would have been eligible to register as voters.[13][5]\n\nPartyPrimary roundGeneral roundSeatsVotes%Votes%Druk Yellow Party56,53144.75161,98674.9646Druk Red Party25,54220.2254,11725.041Druk Blue Party25,50820.190Druk Green Party18,75714.850Total126,338100.00216,103100.0047Registered voters/turnout246,146–246,146–Source: ECB\n\nThe election procedure began with the submission of the letters of intent, lists of candidates, copies of election manifestos and audited financial statements by the two political parties contesting the elections to the election commission followed by the release of the party manifestos by them on 22 January 2008.[14]\n\nFrom 31 January to 7 February 2008 both political parties submitted the nomination papers for their candidates for the 47 constituencies. The candidates, whose nominations were accepted, started campaigning in their constituencies from 7 February. The election campaign ended at 9:00 on 22 March. The last date for receiving the postal ballots was 18 February. The elections were held on 24 March from 09:00 to 17:00 followed by the counting of ballots on the same day. The results were declared on 25 March.[14]\n\nAll eligible voters were allowed to register with the election commission until 20 February 2008 for the inclusion of their names in the voters list which was updated to include those eligible voters who were eighteen years old on or before 1 January 2008. The final electoral roll was published on 5 March 2008.[14]\n\nThere were few differences between the platforms of the two parties and both pledged to follow the king's guidelines of \"pursuing Gross National Happiness\". Both party leaders had also previously served in governments.[15]\n\nVoter turnout reached nearly 80% by the time the polls closed, and the Bhutan Peace and Prosperity Party reportedly won 44 seats, with the People's Democratic Party winning only three seats (Phuentsholing in Chhukha, Goenkhatoe-Laya in Gasa and Sombeykha in Haa). The PDP's leader, Sangay Ngedup, who was also the ruling king's uncle, lost his own constituency by 380 votes. However, due to a mistake in tallying the votes in Phuntsholing,[16] the DPT had actually won 45 seats and the PDP only 2.[17]\n\nThe DPT's large-scale victory may have been due to it being perceived as the more royalist of the two parties.[18]\n\nPartyVotes%SeatsDruk Phuensum Tshogpa169,49067.0445People's Democratic Party83,32232.962Total252,812100.0047Registered voters/turnout318,465–Source: EU Observation Mission\n\nThe two PDP members who were elected refused to take up their seats and resigned their mandates, claiming that the civil servants informally campaigned for the DPT and influenced the result.[19][20]\n\nThe DPT officially approved its leader as candidate for Prime Minister on 5 April 2008.[21] He took office on 9 April.[22]"
