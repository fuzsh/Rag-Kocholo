        "text": "Lyonpo Jigme Yoser Thinley (Dzongkha: འཇིགས་མེད་འོད་ཟེར་འཕྲིན་ལས་; Wylie: 'Jigs-med 'Od-zer 'Phrin-las) (born 9 September 1952) is a Bhutanese politician who was Prime Minister of Bhutan from 20 July 1998 to 9 July 1999, 30 August 2003 to 18 August 2004 and 9 April 2008 to 28 April 2013.\n\nBiography\n\nThinley was born in Bumthang and joined the civil service in 1976 upon receiving a graduate degree from The Pennsylvania State University. He received an undergraduate degree from St. Stephen's College, Delhi.\n\nIn February 1987, Thinley was awarded the title of Dasho and the Red Scarf, and in 1990, under the zonal system, he became administrator of the Eastern Zone. He then became secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs in 1992 before being appointed as Deputy Minister of Home Affairs in January 1994, at which time he was also awarded the Orange Scarf. Later in 1994, he was appointed as Bhutan's Permanent Representative to the United Nations office and other international organizations in Geneva.\n\nPrior to the beginning of Bhutanese democracy, he was Prime Minister twice, from 20 July 1998, to 9 July 1999, and from 30 August 2003, to 20 August 2004. During this period, chairmanship of the council was based on rotation once per year, with the order of rotation decided by the number of votes secured during the time of election to the council. Jigme was also the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Bhutan from 1998 until 2003 and subsequently served as Minister of Home and Cultural Affairs.\n\nIn March 2008, he stood as leader of the political party Druk Phuensum Tshogpa in Bhutan's first democratic election. His party won 45 of the 47 seats in the National Assembly of Bhutan, which enabled Jigme Thinley to become Bhutan's first ever elected Prime Minister. He took office on 9 April.\n\nThinley blamed the global economic crisis of 2008–2009 on \"insatiable human greed\" and stressed the need to instead focus on the Bhutanese notion of gross national happiness. His government works to base its policies on gross national happiness rather than purely economic considerations.\n\nIn July 2009, Thinley became a member of the SNV Netherlands Development Organisation's International Advisory Board.\n\nPersonal life\n\nHis son Palden married Princess Ashi Kesang Choden Wangchuck on 11 November 2008.\n\nHis wife Aum Rinsy Dem died in Bangkok on 28 November 2018.\n\nHe has honorary doctorates from KIIT University and University of Louvain (UCLouvain).\n\nHonours\n\nHe has honorary doctorates from KIIT University and University of Louvain (UCLouvain).\n\nOn 2 June 1999, Thinley was awarded the Druk Thuksey and Silver Jubilee medals.
