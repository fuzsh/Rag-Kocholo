I was so moved to hear that.\n\nPeace Pole Dedication at Schools in Paolo City-BHUTAN\n\nWe also visited Lango Elementary School and Lango Junior High School in Paolo City and gave them an 8 foot tall Peace Pole as our gift.\n\nThe Principal of the school had great consciousness for Peace and understood our purpose very well.\n\nWe enjoyed World Peace Flag Ceremonies with students after Peace Pole dedication ceremony in each school.\n\nThe students are so pure and their smiles are so bright!!\n\nMay Peace Prevail on Earth.\n\nSeki Kato"
