        "text": "Introduction\n\nBackground\n\nAfter Britainâs victory in the 1865 Duar War, Britain and Bhutan signed the Treaty of Sinchulu, under which Bhutan would receive an annual subsidy in exchange for ceding land to British India. Ugyen WANGCHUCK -- who had served as the de facto ruler of an increasingly unified Bhutan and had improved relations with the British toward the end of the 19th century -- was named king in 1907. Three years later, a treaty was signed whereby the British agreed not to interfere in Bhutanese internal affairs, and Bhutan allowed Britain to direct its foreign affairs. Bhutan negotiated a similar arrangement with independent India in 1949. The Indo-Bhutanese Treaty of Friendship returned to Bhutan a small piece of the territory annexed by the British, formalized the annual subsidies the country received, and defined India's responsibilities in defense and foreign relations. Under a succession of modernizing monarchs beginning in the 1950s, Bhutan joined the UN in 1971 and slowly continued its engagement beyond its borders.\n\nIn 2005, King Jigme Singye WANGCHUCK unveiled the draft of Bhutan's first constitution -- which introduced major democratic reforms -- and held a national referendum for its approval. The King abdicated the throne in 2006 in favor of his son, Jigme Khesar Namgyel WANGCHUCK. In 2007, India and Bhutan renegotiated their treaty, eliminating the clause that stated that Bhutan would be \"guided by\" India in conducting its foreign policy, although Thimphu continues to coordinate closely with New Delhi. In 2008, Bhutan held its first parliamentary election in accordance with the constitution. Bhutan experienced a peaceful turnover of power following a parliamentary election in 2013, which resulted in the defeat of the incumbent party. In 2018, the incumbent party again lost the parliamentary election. In 2024, of the more than 100,000 ethnic Nepali -- predominantly Lhotshampa -- refugees who fled or were forced out of Bhutan in the 1990s, about 6,500 remain displaced in Nepal.\n\nTip\n\nVisit the Definitions and Notes page to view a description of each topic.\n\nDefinitions and Notes\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nSouthern Asia, between China and India\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n27 30 N, 90 30 E\n\nMap references\n\nAsia\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 38,394 sq km\n\nland: 38,394 sq km\n\nwater: 0 sq km\n\ncomparison ranking : total 136\n\nArea - comparative\n\nslightly larger than Maryland; about one-half the size of Indiana\n\nArea comparison map :\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 1,136 km\n\nborder countries (2): China 477 km; India 659 km\n\nCoastline\n\n0 km (landlocked)\n\nMaritime claims\n\nnone (landlocked)\n\nClimate\n\nvaries; tropical in southern plains; cool winters and hot summers in central valleys; severe winters and cool summers in Himalayas\n\nTerrain\n\nmostly mountainous with some fertile valleys and savanna\n\nElevation\n\nhighest point: Gangkar Puensum 7,570 m\n\nlowest point: Drangeme Chhu 97 m\n\nmean elevation: 2,220 m\n\nNatural resources\n\ntimber, hydropower, gypsum, calcium carbonate\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 13.6% (2018 est.)\n\narable land: 2.6% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent crops: 0.3% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent pasture: 10.7% (2018 est.)\n\nforest: 85.5% (2018 est.)\n\nother: 0.9% (2018 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n320 sq km (2012)\n\nNatural hazards\n\nviolent storms from the Himalayas are the source of the country's Bhutanese name, which translates as Land of the Thunder Dragon; frequent landslides during the rainy season\n\nGeography - note\n\nlandlocked; strategic location between China and India; controls several key Himalayan mountain passes\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\ntotal: 884,546\n\nmale: 457,665\n\nfemale: 426,881 (2024 est.)\n\ncomparison rankings : female 165; male 163; total 165\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Bhutanese (singular and plural)\n\nadjective: Bhutanese\n\nEthnic groups\n\nNgalop (also known as Bhote) 50%, ethnic Nepali 35% (predominantly Lhotshampas), indigenous or migrant tribes 15%\n\nLanguages\n\nSharchopkha 28%, Dzongkha (official) 24%, Lhotshamkha 22%, other 26% (includes foreign languages) (2005 est.)\n\nReligions\n\nLamaistic Buddhist 75.3%, Indian- and Nepali-influenced Hinduism 22.1%, other 2.6% (2005 est.)\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 23.1% (male 104,771/female 99,981)\n\n15-64 years: 70.2% (male 322,497/female 298,324)\n\n65 years and over: 6.7% (2024 est.)

that, and its mountainous terrain, left the country far back in the field in terms of teledensity as well as access to the Internet; over the last decade, the country has undergone a significant transformation due to the opening of its borders, liberalization of its telecom sector, and the active support from the government towards increased competition in the mobile, broadband, and ISP segments; the relatively widespread availability of the mobile platform has caused an explosion in mobile broadband subscriber numbers, growing from zero to over 100% penetration in just ten years (between 2010 and 2019).; the onset of the Covid-19 crisis in 2020 caused the subscription rates to drop back a little; growth is projected to return in 2022 (along with the broader mobile market) as the overall economy recovers; the government opens up more to foreign investment, trade, and tourism; and network expansion continues â the recent (December 2021) launch of 5G services by both of the countryâs mobile operators being particularly noteworthy (2022)\n\ndomestic: approximately 3 to 100 fixed-line and 100 mobile cellular subscriptions per 100 people (2021)\n\ninternational: country code - 975; international telephone and telegraph service via landline and microwave relay through India; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat\n\nInternet country code\n\n.bt\n\nInternet users\n\ntotal: 670,800 (2021 est.)\n\npercent of population: 86% (2021 est.)\n\ncomparison ranking : total 162\n\nMilitary and Security\n\nMilitary and security forces\n\nRoyal Bhutan Army (includes Royal Bodyguard and an air wing); National Militia\n\nMinistry of Home and Cultural Affairs: Royal Bhutan Police (2023)\n\nMilitary and security service personnel strengths\n\nestimated 8,000 active personnel (2023)\n\nMilitary equipment inventories and acquisitions\n\nIndia has provided most of the Royal Bhutan Army's equipment (2023)\n\nMilitary service age and obligation\n\n18 years of age for voluntary military service for men and women; no conscription; militia training is compulsory for males aged 20-25, over a 3-year periodÂ (2023)\n\nnote: in 2021, the Royal Bhutan Army graduated from a year-long training course the first batch of 150 women to be allowed to serve in combat roles; previously, women were allowed to serve in medical and other non-combat roles\n\nMilitary deployments\n\n190 Central African Republic (MINUSCA) (2024)\n\nMilitary - note\n\nthe Army is responsible for external threats but also has some internal security functions such as conducting counterinsurgency operations, guarding forests, and providing security for prominent persons; Bhutan relies on India for military training, arms supplies, and the countryâs air defense (2023)\n\nSpace\n\nSpace agency/agencies\n\nannounced in 2018 that it intends to establish a space agency, but has not yet done so; has a Division of Telecom and Space (DoTS) under the GovTech Agency (2024)\n\nSpace program overview\n\nhas a small, recently established program focused on acquiring satellites and developing the capabilities to manufacture satellites; cooperates with India and the US (2024)\n\nnote: further details about the key activities, programs, and milestones of the countryâs space program, as well as government spending estimates on the space sector, appear in Appendix S"
