Summary

Instructions provided describe how to identify which folder stored in the registry under HKEY_USERS is associated with each user profile on the computer.

Note: The Security Identifier (SID) is a unique name (an alphanumeric character string) that is assigned by a Windows Domain controller during the login process that is used to identify a user.

This procedure enables administrators to make modifications to specific user profiles located in HKEY_USERS, mimicking those found in HKEY_CURRENT_USER when that user is logged in.
