        "text": "Heart Word Cards\n\nUFLI Foundations lessons include introduction and review of irregular words using the “heart word” approach in Step 7: Irregular Words. The heart word cards can be printed to use for review of previously taught words or for display in the classroom as an easy reference for your students. The notes sections of the Step 7 lesson slides that display each heart word include an explanation for the coding used. Please note that some pronunciations vary based on regional accent or dialect, and you may need to adjust the slides to align with your local pronunciation.\n\nHeart Word Cards\n\nSound Wall Cards\n\nThe Sound Wall materials provided here align with the UFLI Foundations lessons. Included in the UFLI Sound Wall set are the following:\n\nphoneme cards with mouth pictures to represent the articulatory gesture associated with each phoneme,\n\nlabels for the sound wall displays, including the place and manner of articulation for consonants, and\n\ngrapheme cards that can be added to the sound wall one at a time, as the grapheme-phoneme correspondences are taught.\n\nWe have also provided printable version of the Individual Sound wall charts. You may choose to glue them into a file folder for each student or print them front/back to laminate. These may also be enlarged and printed as posters if your classroom space does not allow for the full UFLI Sound Wall displays.\n\nSound Wall Materials\n\nIndividual Sound Wall: Consonants\n\nIndividual Sound Wall: Vowels\n\nGrapheme Cards\n\nThe printable grapheme cards may be used for general review of grapheme-phoneme correspondences. They may also be used as an alternative to Visual Drill slides in Step 2: Visual Drill or the Virtual Blending Board in Step 4: Blending Drill, especially for small-group or one-on-one implementation of the lessons.\n\nGrapheme Cards – Small (3.6”x4.24”)\n\nGrapheme Cards – Medium (4.25”x5.5”)\n\nGrapheme Cards – Large (5.5”x8.5”)\n\nGrapheme Cards – Extra Large (8.5”x11”)\n\nWord Work Mat\n\nThe Word Work Mat can be used in Step 6: Word Work, or any time students need to use manipulative letters for encoding and decoding practice. The Word Work Mat can be used by the teacher, the students, or both, to practice reading and spelling words.\n\nDownload the Printable Word Work Mat\n\nAccess the Digital Word Work Mat\n\nPrintable Alphabet Tiles and Mat\n\nThe Printable Alphabet Tiles and Mat are designed to be sent home along with the Home Support Guide. Families can use these paper tiles as manipulative letters for home practice with word work. Printing them on card stock makes them easier to use.\n\nPrintable Alphabet Tiles and Mat\n\nThe materials on this site are freely available for anyone to use, adapt, and share (with attribution), but no one is permitted to sell either the original materials, any adaptation of it, or lesson plans that reproduce any part of it.
