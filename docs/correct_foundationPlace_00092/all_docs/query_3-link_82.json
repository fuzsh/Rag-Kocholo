        "text": "Supporting community-led efforts to promote economic and community growth through investments in local leaders and catalytic development projects.\n\nIndividuals and families succeed when they live in strong, supportive, and vibrant communities. Yet many of Chicago's Black and Brown neighborhoods have experienced decades of systemic disinvestment. Pritzker Traubert Foundation is committed to helping neighborhoods thrive through investments in local leaders and catalytic, community-led development projects.\n\nOur flagship initiative, Chicago Prize, is founded on the belief that community leaders are best positioned to create catalytic change in their communities but often lack access to the resources and other support needed to execute those community plans. Since 2019, the Chicago Prize has invested almost $30 million across multiple South and West Side community areas.\n\nLearn more about the Chicago Prize and how we’ve leveraged more than $100 million in additional investment.\n\nThe Obama Presidential Center, located in Chicago’s historic Jackson Park, will commemorate the presidency of Barack Obama. In addition to empowering and connecting people from around the country and the world, the Obama Presidential Center will also be a boon to the local economy. Pritzker Traubert Foundation’s capital grant supports the building of the Center in addition to assisting the Obama Youth Jobs Corps."
