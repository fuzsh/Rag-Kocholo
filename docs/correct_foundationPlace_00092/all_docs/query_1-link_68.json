        "text": "Updated on Feb. 13, 2024\n\nSAN MARINO, Calif.—The Huntington Library, Art Museum, and Botanical Gardens will produce a major exhibition and companion book on the California-based Black artist Sargent Claude Johnson (1888–1967), whose powerful works—masks, portrait busts, and figural sculptures created in the 1920s and 1930s—have become emblems of the Harlem Renaissance. This will be the first exhibition devoted to Johnson in over 25 years.\n\nJohnson dedicated his artistic practice to sensitive, ennobling portrayals of people of color. Though best known as a sculptor, he worked expertly in a wide variety of media, including ceramic, clay, oil, enamel, stone, terracotta, and wood. On view from Feb. 17 through May 20, 2024, the exhibition of 43 works represents the full breadth of Johnson’s career and draws from The Huntington’s important collection of works by the artist as well as key loans from institutional and private collections, some not seen publicly in decades. On view will be The Huntington’s Head of a Boy (ca. 1928) and monumental carved redwood Organ Screen (1933–34), which was created for the auditorium of the California School for the Blind in Berkeley, California. In this exhibition, the screen—which had been out of public view from 1980 to 2011, when The Huntington acquired it—will be reunited with the other parts of Johnson’s California School for the Blind commission for the first time in over four decades.\n\n“Johnson’s work speaks volumes about the fragility of our shared cultural heritage and the critical role that institutions like The Huntington play in safeguarding this heritage for future generations,” said Christina Nielsen, Hannah and Russel Kully Director of The Huntington’s Art Museum. “With this exhibition, we are making the full range of his work accessible to the artists, researchers, and audiences of today. It is an enormous pleasure to present Johnson’s work and the accompanying book of essays, which offer rich new insights into the life and work of this important artist.”\n\n“Sargent Claude Johnson” is curated by Dennis Carr, The Huntington’s Virginia Steele Scott Chief Curator of American Art, with Jacqueline Francis (California College of the Arts) and John P. Bowles (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill).\n\nAbout Sargent Claude Johnson\n\nSargent Claude Johnson was born in Boston in 1888 to Eliza Jackson, a woman of African and Cherokee heritage, and Anderson Johnson, a Swedish American. A multiracial artist who identified as Black, Sargent Claude Johnson was orphaned at a young age and sent to live briefly with his uncle William Tecumseh Sherman Jackson, an educator in Washington, D.C., and aunt May Howard Jackson, a sculptor who was known for her naturalistic bronze and clay busts of Black people.\n\nAround 1915, Johnson moved to San Francisco and studied art at the A.W. Best School of Art and the California School of Fine Arts (later the San Francisco Art Institute). He quickly established his reputation as an important sculptor, winning a series of awards in juried exhibitions, including multiple awards at the annual exhibitions hosted by the San Francisco Art Association (SFAA). In 1931, he won first place in sculpture at the SFAA for his portrait bust Chester (1931). His work also gained national recognition in touring exhibitions of African American artists’ work that were organized by the Harmon Foundation in New York.\n\nJohnson drew from a range of international influences, including traditional and contemporary arts of Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. He traveled to Japan and Mexico, where he met with Mexican modernist artists and learned traditional pottery techniques from Indigenous artists. Johnson was among the earliest of a generation of African American artists to travel to Mexico.\n\nExhibition Layout and Visitor Experience\n\n“Sargent Claude Johnson” is organized into six sections: Johnson’s role in the Black Renaissance, featuring sculptures and masks that he made early in his career (1920s–30s); portraits of children (1920s–30s); Johnson’s California School for the Blind commission (1933–37); contributions to the federal Works Project Administration in California (1930s–40s); pieces inspired by Johnson’s travels to Latin America (1940s); and works made during a period of material experimentation (1950s–60s). In collaboration with the California School for the Blind, select wall text will be in English Braille; gallery guides in Braille will also be available. The exhibition graphics and identity are designed in partnership with Polymode, an LGBTQ+ and minority-owned graphic design studio based in California and North Carolina.\n\nArtist of the Black Renaissance (1920s–30s)\n\nThe first gallery in the exhibition features a selection of Johnson’s most popular and widely renowned sculptural works, which he made early in his career (1920s–30s). These include the free-standing sculpture Forever Free (1933), a 36-inch-tall figure made of painted plaster over linen and wood that represents a mother with two children tucked beneath her arms. She stands erect and looks upward, conveying pride, hope, and love for her children, who are protected under her long arms. The gallery also displays a group of hand-hammered copper masks inspired by traditional African masks. Guided by his friend and writer Alain Locke, a leader of the Harlem Renaissance and author of the book The New Negro (1925), Johnson was profoundly influenced by African sculpture. Given the historical and social context in which he created these works, Johnson also felt it was vital to celebrate Black women and mothers, who were often stereotyped in negative and racist ways.\n\nPortraits of Children\n\nJohnson’s sculptural portraits of children were modeled after those who lived in his multiracial, middle-class neighborhood in Berkeley. Perhaps his best-known work, the terracotta Chester (1931) is joined by the stylized Head of a Boy (ca. 1928) in glazed terracotta. Both busts present realistic, individualized features and simultaneously display the hallmarks of modernist abstraction. Elizabeth Gee (1927), whose green, crackled glaze derives from celadon-style Chinese ceramics, is a portrait of his daughter’s Chinese American playmate, whose family lived a block from the Johnsons.\n\nCalifornia School for the Blind Commission\n\nIn 1933, Johnson received a government commission to design a large sculptural installation to adorn the auditorium of the California School for the Blind in Berkeley. Once completed, the installation featured a gilded redwood relief of children, animals, and birds in a woodland setting covering the organ, carved lunettes above the arched windows, and a monumental proscenium over the stage where students performed. The work was removed around 1980, after the school moved to a new campus and the University of California, Berkeley, renovated the building. In the exhibition, the principal components of Johnson’s commission—now owned by The Huntington, the California School for the Blind, the African American Museum and Library at Oakland, and UC Berkeley—will be reunited and displayed publicly for the first time in over four decades. Organ music and other interactive elements will help bring the installation to life in the galleries, and visitors will be able to interact with a 3D-printed replica of a panel depicting Louis Braille that Johnson had carved for the school.\n\nWorks Project Administration (WPA) Era\n\nFollowing the California School for the Blind project, Johnson received further governmental commissions and became one of the few African American supervisors in the WPA nationwide. His largest work was a 185-foot-long mural (1942) that he made for the George Washington High School football field in San Francisco. A panoramic video of the mural, Athletics, will take up an entire gallery wall, providing visitors with a sense of the work’s scale and setting. Johnson’s maquette for the project, made in 1941, will be on loan from George Washington High School.\n\nLatin American Influences (1940s) and Material Experimentation (1950s–60s)\n\nThe exhibition’s last galleries feature work from the 1940s through the 1960s. Johnson’s art from this period shows the influence of his travels to Mexico, where he studied ancient and modern art, traveled to archaeological sites, and met with contemporary artists. He was especially impacted by the work of Diego Rivera, whose large-scale murals from the early 1930s and 1940s included Pan American Unity (1940), a famous mural painted for the Golden Gate International Exposition that Johnson would have seen in San Francisco.\n\nA selection of pieces from the 1950s and ’60s, a period during which Johnson began to experiment with such industrial materials as fired enamel, will be on view, in addition to a touchable display of the materials he used. Although he worked extensively in enamel for large public artworks and was one of the few African American enamel practitioners, he has not been recognized in histories of American enamelwork. Made just a year before his death, Johnson’s enamel Self Portrait (1966) is characterized by masklike facial features, abstracted shapes, and bright colors in a depiction of the artist as his younger self.\n\nPublic Programs\n\nAn array of public programs and a scholarly conference will complement the exhibition. Upcoming programs include:\n\nShaping Black Modernisms: Art, Culture, and Community in California\n\nFri., Feb. 23, 8:30 a.m.–4 p.m. | Sat., Feb. 24, 9 a.m.–4 p.m.\n\nGeneral: $25 (long-term fellows and students free) | Optional lunch: $20 (each day)\n\nConference registration includes free entrance to the grounds and galleries.\n\nThis two-day conference celebrates Black creativity in California’s past, present, and future with talks by academics and artists, performances of music from the archives by Black composers Harold Bruce Forsythe and William Grant Still, and tours of the exhibition. Topics in the conference address Black artists in the Bay Area—centered on the life and work of Sargent Claude Johnson—and in Southern California, especially the Black artistic community that developed in Pasadena, as well as California’s key position along the Pacific Rim. To purchase tickets and view the full conference schedule, visit huntington.org/black-modernisms.\n\nSecond Sundays: Sargent Claude Johnson and the WPA\n\nSun., March 10, 11 a.m.–2 p.m.\n\nFree with general admission\n\nCelebrate the legacy of Sargent Claude Johnson and the WPA through artmaking, musical performances, and in-gallery talks at this free event for visitors of all ages.
