        "text": "Given your screenshot, you seem to have set up your project with Instant App support. With instant apps, you split your project into multiple \"feature\" modules that the end user can \"instantly\" load up. All of these modules share \"base\" code, which is where all the shared / base / common logic lives.\n\nRecently I've updated the android studio, when I create a new project I noticed a folder called base and it cause me problems in gradle.\n\nWhat does \"it cause me problems in gradle\" mean?\n\nHow can I remove it safely?\n\nDo you actually want instant apps support? If not, I'd say start over and create a brand new project that explicitly does not have instant apps support."
