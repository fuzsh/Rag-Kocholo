We are focused in Thurston County, but we interact with communities throughout the Salish Sea.\n\nThe Native Plant Salvage Foundation is a non-profit, 501(c) (3) charitable organization, founded in 2000 to help raise funds for the work of the Native Plant Salvage Project, which is a program of WSU Extension Thurston County, started in 1994. Our joint work is entirely supported by local contributions, grants and contract work.\n\nThe Foundation is guided by a volunteer board of directors and supported by a small but mighty crew of volunteers, supporters, educators and community partners. Our work is also supported by AmeriCorps members from the Washington Service Corps.\n\nThrough field projects and educational activities we work to restore vegetation, re-create habitat, and preserve existing flora.\n\nWhat We Do\n\nAs our name implies, we organize “salvages” during the winter months at sites that are soon to be developed. However, our program areas expand far beyond our winter salvages. At the Native Plant Salvage Foundation Nursery (aka the Holding Beds) we propagate plants and store salvaged plants for use in future revegetation and green stormwater projects.\n\nOur work encompasses:\n\nEnvironmental restoration\n\nPlant salvages\n\nPlant identification training\n\nEducation programs for groups, schools, or whoever is curious\n\nCreating proactive community partnerships\n\nSustainable landscaping/naturescaping\n\nGreen Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI)/Low-Impact Development (LID)\n\nCheck out our Learning resources and Volunteer opportunities, or contact us to learn more.\n\n“Our education, training and advocacy work give citizens a direct, hands-on opportunity to do something to improve water quality, conserve natural resources, reduce pesticide use, and influence people’s appreciation of the natural world.”\n\n— Longtime supporter Lydia Beth\n\nSign up for emails to learn about seasonal goings on, plant sales, and volunteer opportunities.\n\nFirst Name\n\nLast Name\n\nEmail Address\n\nThank you!"
