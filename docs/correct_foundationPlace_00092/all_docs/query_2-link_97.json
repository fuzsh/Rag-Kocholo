        "text": "With WSL2 you're working in a virtual machine â€“ the entire Linux environment is a VM running on Hyper-V, with a .vhdx image storing its Ext4-formatted disk (including all of the files at /home).\n\nThe image is located in some subdirectory of ~\\AppData\\Local\\Packages, depending on which distribution you have installed (each of them is a separate \"app\"). See How to manage WSL disk space for more details.\n\nNote that while you can attach a .vhdx directly in Windows, it still won't understand the Ext4 filesystem.\n\nFor WSL1, the Linux filesystem was stored as individual files in a rootfs directory (at the same location under AppData). However, the files are not meant to be accessed directly as they have hidden attributes storing the Linux-specific metadata (e.g. Linux file permissions); directly editing the files could lose the extended attributes.\n\nNot sure if this helps your case. In my WSL1 instance the Linux folders are listed in a new \"Linux\" section of Windows Explorer. Clicking on the different installation instance names to explore or try dir with UNC path something like:\n\ndir \\\\wsl.localhost\\Ubuntu-20.04\\home\\youruserid\n\nIn explorer, just find the folder you want and \"Copy Path\" will provide the UNC path to same which you can paste into a Windows command prompt."
