Then find the PSR autoload. For instance, for Laravel/framework:\n\n{ \"name\" : \"laravel/framework\", ....... ....... \"autoload\": { \"classmap\": [ \"src/Illuminate/Queue/IlluminateQueueClosure.php\" ], \"files\": [ \"src/Illuminate/Foundation/helpers.php\", \"src/Illuminate/Support/helpers.php\" ], \"psr-4\": { \"Illuminate\\\\\": \"src/Illuminate/\" } } }\n\nSince there are a lot of packages in vendor folder, refer the name of the package in the composer.lock. For example, Illuminate is under laravel/framework packages. Then, look for vendor/laravel/framework\n\nThen you know, Illuminate is mapped to vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate\n\nanswered Jul 12, 2016 at 3:07\n\ngeckobgeckob\n\n7,98055 gold badges3131 silver badges4040 bronze badges"
