Today, the land has been beautifully transformed into a dynamic terrain with rolling berms, stunning vistas and naturally harmonious transitions.\n\nThe routing features dramatic elevation changes – up to 40 feet on certain holes – mature trees and natural areas, meandering lakes and flowing streams. There are 75 acres of prairie grass flowing naturally throughout the layout.\n\nEach of the spectacular par 3’s face a different point on the compass. The par 5’s are big and bold yet contain ample driving zones and generous bailout regions. The par 4’s range from short and sweet to long and tough. Many elements of a superb Fazio design are here and offer a challenge in many forms, from the classic perched greens undercut by bunkers to the awesome peninsula greens menaced by water.\n\nThe finishing 18th hole is one of the most picturesque on the course with two water features and strategically placed bunkers that demand accurate tacking from one safe area to the next. Walking off the 18th green will leave a lasting impression of a spectacular test of skill in an environment that offers an array of memorable golf holes.\n\nHOMES OF HOPE:\n\nOften, the best chance of a successful outcome for a patient with pancreatic cancer is to travel to a hospital far from home. Travel costs add up quickly, especially when patients consider lodging, transportation, and food. Patients who need housing for extended cancer treatments may need to spend several hundred to several thousand dollars, depending on their length of stay.\n\nHomes of Hope aims to ease the financial burden of housing, provide better access to the nation’s top cancer hospitals, and provide a “home away from home” to families during their most difficult days.\n\nTHANK YOU TO OUR SPONSORS\n\nView Event →\n\n2023 Fulton Market Summer Kick-Off Presented by The Associate Board\n\nJoin the Associate Board of the Reaumond Foundation as we kick off summer on one of Fulton Market’s coolest rooftops.
