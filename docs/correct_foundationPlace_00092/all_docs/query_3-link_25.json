        "text": "The Pfeiffer family may have started it all, but countless others contributed during the past century in building Western Home Communities to what it is today: a thriving, non-profit organization that carries out its mission to assertively create fulfilling lifestyles for those we serve, their families and our employees.\n\nEveryone who supports this mission, in large and small ways, plays a part in the organization’s financial strength, growth and longevity.\n\nAt Western Home Foundation, we’re thankful to work with donors who bring creative ideas. Their personal passions collide with capacity, and suddenly – a memorial fund turns into a new amenity, a building project is funded, cutting-edge care is delivered, or an employee realizes an education dream.\n\nIn this healthcare challenging world, the Western Home Foundation needs your support more than ever. Thank you for giving to the Western Home Foundation, We look forward to continuing our mission of creating fulfilling lifestyles for those we serve for many years to come.\n\nContact Jerry Harris or Susan Steffy to discuss how you can support the Western Home Foundation with memorials, scholarships, amenities, naming gifts, charitable gift annuities, estate gifts and more.\n\nWestern Home Foundation\n\n5307 Caraway Lane\n\nCedar Falls, Iowa 50613\n\n(319) 222-2022\n\nThe Western Old People’s Home of the Evangelical Association opened in September of 1912 in Cedar Falls, IA. It was so named because it was westernmost retirement home for that religious denomination in the United States. A gift of land and $20,000 for construction from the Pfeiffer family made it possible for the Evangelical Association to build a home for aging church members. Matriarch Barbara Pfeiffer had been a long-time member of the Cedar Falls Church, and supporting the cause struck the family as a fitting tribute to her life and legacy.\n\nIn the next 12 years, the home opened its doors to seniors of other faith backgrounds and increased its ability to care for seniors.\n\nThe Western Home Foundation was established in 2000 and is dedicated to the stewardship of funds intended to improve the quality of life for residents and expand opportunities for employees.\n\nSince 1911, many more families have joined the list of those investing in the lives of those who live and work at Western Home Communities. Their names like Pfeiffer, have cemented a place in the story of WHC: Martin, Stanard, Nation, Thuesen, Jorgensen, Deery & Grosse.\n\nTheir gifts helped fund each new vision form innovative ways to serve older adults, from smaller environments that create home for people with dementia to large gathering places that foster well-being – socially. Physically and emotionally.\n\n“The household model of care where residents have privacy and dignity is very important. Having your own room is important for rest and confidential conversations. We’re put on earth to do good things, and this is a good thing.”\n\nMarlene Deery – Windridge resident\n\nWorking at Western Home Communities gives employees a unique perspective on life. They learn from the wisdom and experiences of an older generation because they have time to develop relationships with them. Many employees say its more than a job – it’s a calling that fills them deep with purpose.\n\nThe work can also be demanding and even emotional as employees watch people, they’ve grown to love, face unexpected health challenges and tough transitions. It’s not unusual to see an employee visiting a resident when they are off the clock, just to brighten their day.\n\nThe Employee Appreciation Fund lets grateful residents and families show their support. The fund is used to recognize employee teams throughout the year with surprises such as pizza parties, food trucks, gift cards and many logo’d items.\n\n\"Part of my giving stems from the awesome care my mother-in-law received when she lived at Nation Cottage. Those employees went above and beyond. They treated her with the utmost respect and, I believe, extended her life. Now, as a villa resident, I find that employees always talk to me, even when I don’t know who they are! They all work hard and I love living here.\"\n\nSteve Armbrecht - Villa Resident"
