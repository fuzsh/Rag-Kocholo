        "text": "The Four Way Community Foundation cultivates philanthropy and nonprofit success in greater Josephine County so that our residents can thrive in perpetuity.\n\nWith customized gift language, we help donors give back to the local causes that most move their hearts. We make grants to groups doing the work of building community every day, and we mentor those groups as they become more successful.\n\nThe Four Way Community Foundation believes that people caring about each other is the key to meeting our shared aspirations. With transparency, integrity, and local control, we tie together generous donors and the hardworking that help build a stronger, more loving community.\n\nWe serve Josephine County and the western edge of Jackson County in the state of Oregon. The 123 line of longitude is our eastern border.\n\nOur history, our name\n\nThe Four Way Community Foundation is an independent nonprofit corporation. It was originally founded in 1975 by members of the Rotary Club of Grants Pass. Although there has been no formal association with Rotary for decades, the Foundation honors its origins and the high ethical standards it inherited and maintains by retaining its name, which derives from the Rotary “Four Way Test.”\n\nOf the things we think, say, or do:\n\nIs it the TRUTH?\n\nIs it FAIR to all concerned?\n\nWill it build GOODWILL and BETTER FRIENDSHIPS?\n\nWill it be BENEFICIAL to all concerned?\n\nIn its half century of operations, the Four Way Community Foundation has had on its board many well-known local people whose tireless devotion to greater Josephine County helped make possible many of the amenities and institutions we all love, including the Grants Pass Performing Arts Center, the Asante Family House, the Reinhart Volunteer Park, Caveman Court, and hundreds of smaller durable additions to the infrastructure of our parks, schools, nonprofit organizations, and public amenities."
