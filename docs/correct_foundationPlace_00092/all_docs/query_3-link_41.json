        "text": "When the IDADEE Children’s Home opened its doors in 2011, one year after the devastating earthquake in 2010, these were the first children to move in. A few of them, like Emanuella, were in such poor health that the caretakers didn’t think they would survive.\n\nDr. Wislyn reported Tuesday that CHIDA’s team has treated 5,904 people since the earthquake, with 81 of those being patients who come back every day to have their bandages changed by a doctor from the team. In addition to treating patients with minor wounds, the team continues to treat more urgent injuries such as deep cuts, broken bones, and respiratory issues due to dust from the rubble.\n\nIt’s been just over a week since a 7.2 magnitude earthquake hit southern Haiti. UNICEF now estimates that roughly 1.2 million people, including 540,000 children, have been impacted by the earthquake and tropical depression Grace, which brought heavy rain and substantial flooding to the region just days after the quake, further complicating the situation.\n\nBy now, you’re likely aware that a 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck Haiti on Saturday at 8:30 am, with its epicenter about 7.5 miles northeast of Sait-Louis-du-Sud, in the southwest part of the country.\n\nWe’re glad to report that our staff, friends, and families in Haiti are currently safe and continuing their work to address the needs of their communities. We are working on filling two shipping containers with food and medical supplies to provide immediate assistance to our partners in Haiti.\n\nOne of the things that became clear through Tami’s story is that being surrounded by a supportive community is incredibly important. Youth leaders play an important role in kids’ lives, and as the saying goes, “You can’t pour from an empty vessel.”\n\nThe IDADEE primary school closed its doors in March 2020 as the pandemic swept across the globe. The primary school reopened in September, and we’re thrilled to share that students are back in class, studying hard, and learning new things that will help them thrive in the future.\n\nIn the spirit of getting back to school, we wanted to share a little look into what the typical school day looks like at IDADEE!"
