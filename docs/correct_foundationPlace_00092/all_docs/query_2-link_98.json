        "text": "instead of being in the \"electronics arts folder\" my sims4 folder is in EA Games folder, and then when i click onto it, it just has things like \"_Installer\" and a bunch of random folders with numbers.\n\nim on PC, and its a second hand computer. my sims was working just fine but i went to download some CC and i couldn't the tray or mods folder because the sims4 folder wasn't laid out correctly or what i was used to\n\nI've deleted the sims like 7 different times, i downloaded it from steam, EA and origin but when with origin it just had the same situation as the EA folder, but it said \"Origin games\"\n\nI hope I'm not the only one with this issue?\n\n@Cosmos_M104 The game files install to default locations depending on the program you use to launch the installer. You can change the install directory to over ride the default. I install my game files to a data hard drive instead of the boot device which in my case is a ssd. The user game files for a pc are hard coded to the boot device (usually C)/users/(name of user used to log into Windows)/Documents/Electron Arts/The Sims 4. These files are not created until the game successfully starts the first time. This is hard coded into the game. This can be moved by using a Windows system tool. The game will still use that route but Windows will redirect it.You can manually tell the game installer to change the default installation directory. If you had installed the game prior to reinstall, the installer may detect the original install location and use it. Before reinstall you will need to move and/or delete the user files and use a registry cleaner. This should remove any traces of a prior install and the game installer should use the expected defaults. When The Sims 4 was released Origin was the DRM fro this game. That recently changed to the EA app. The EA app does not run under IOS (yet?). If and when EA figures this out mac users still need to use Origin. EA has pretty much stripped pc support from Origin. Steam installs the game to a different default location as you don't need the EA app to run the game under Steam but you need Steam to run the Steam version base game. To use EA DLC you have to link the Steam account to your EA account as the EA app is the DRM for the DLC. To make it easy EA offers The Sims 4 base game free to play under EA play."
