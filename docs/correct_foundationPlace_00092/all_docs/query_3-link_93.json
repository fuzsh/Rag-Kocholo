        "text": "Without a structured and organized knowledge base in place, the process of accessing relevant information becomes daunting and can hinder overall workflow efficiency. When you have complex and extensive knowledge bases, navigating through layers of information spread across various folders and subfolders can be time-consuming and inefficient. Employees may struggle to locate specific documents or resources quickly, decreasing productivity and increasing frustration.\n\nWith Freshservice Knowledge base, you can now address these challenges by nesting folders up to 10 levels deep. Create a well-organized and easily navigable knowledge base, enhancing the service desk experience for both agents and end-users. With the ability to nest folders to a greater depth, users can now access information quickly and efficiently, reducing search times and improving overall productivity. Categorize and subcategorize resources with ease, creating a streamlined navigation experience.\n\nHow to create nested folders\n\nManaging hierarchy:\n\nHere’s how you can organize content on the knowledge base now:\n\nCategory: This is a parent category that can contain folders, sub-folders, and articles. Visibility here is defined on a workspace level.\n\nFolder: This is the root folder that can hold both sub-folders (up to 10) and articles. This is the first folder created within a category. Visibility here is defined on an agent group level.\n\nSub-folders: These are folders nested within other folders. Visibility here is set by the root folder.\n\nCreating a new folder: You can create a new folder/sub-folder directly via “Add new” option and set the location as the category/folder you want to nest within.\n\nAlternatively, you can navigate to the category and the folder where you want to create a new folder. Click on Add New on the top right corner and create the folder.\n\nTo support the enhanced hierarchy, you can select the article location while creating a new article. Note: This is not supported while creating articles in non-primary languages.\n\nManaging visibility and other folder configurations: The sub-folders will have the same and other folder configurations as the root folder. So if you are trying to create a root Folder (folder whose parent is a category), you will be asked to add the folder settings like visibility and managed by. But if you are trying to create a sub-folder, you will be shown a message that the root folder defines the visibility and other configurations.\n\nFolder/Article view: The list view page is now enhanced to support the new hierarchy of folders. Here is what has changed:\n\nThe sub-folders and articles belonging to a folder will be available on the list view.\n\nWhen a user clicks on a category, they get a holistic view of all articles in the category on the left pane.\n\nWhen a user clicks on a folder, they get to view the folders and articles within the selected folder on the left pane.\n\nWithin a folder, folders are displayed on the top followed by articles. Articles can be moved to the top using sorting filters.\n\nOn the left pane, click on a category to see a list of all articles and folders in that category\n\nOn the left pane, click on a folder to see a list of articles and folders within that particular folder.\n\nManaging folders\n\nBulk operations are currently not allowed on folders. The “Select all” functionality can be used only for articles.\n\nYou can reorder folder arrangement by clicking on Reorder sub-folders from the menu on the top right corner of your parent folder display.\n\nArticles are always displayed only after folders. Hence folders need to be reordered separately from articles.\n\nIf a folder is deleted, all underlying folders and articles will be deleted.\n\nNote:\n\nThis is available only on the Pro and Enterprise plans\n\nThis feature is supported only on version 2 of the end user portal (and portals created by no code portal as it’s automatically created in version 2)\n\nIf any portal customizations are done on the solutions page in the requester portal, the folder layers might not be displayed. You will have to remove the customizations to view folder hierarchy\n\nExternal URL articles don’t support hierarchy currently. This will be supported after March 15th."
