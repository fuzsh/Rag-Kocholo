The board meets four times each year to review applications, award grants, and monitor the use of disbursed funds.\n\nSt. John’s Community Foundation was established by St. John’s Episcopal Church to help address the broad social issues facing the Stamford community.\n\nSince its inception in 1987, St. John’s Community Foundation has awarded over $6,000,000 in grants to more than one hundred organizations."
