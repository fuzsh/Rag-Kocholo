        "text": "The mission of the Active 20-30 Club of Phoenix and it’s non-profit foundation, the Children In Need Foundation, are to support Phoenix Area underprivileged youth and assist in ending their cycle of poverty. One of the ways we accomplish this goal is by supporting the dreams of students who wish become entrepreneurs through the Aspiring Youth Academy. The Academy was founded by past Presidents of the Phoenix 20-30 Club to operate the camp programs.\n\nThe Phoenix 20-30 Aspiring Youth Fund is a 501(c)(3) Qualifying Charitable Organization eligible to accept donations under the Arizona Charitable Tax Credit program. This tax credit program allows you to sponsor, at no cost to you, underprivileged youth participation in programs designed to teach them how to become successful entrepreneurs and business owners. These programs are a partnership between the Aspiring Youth Academy, Phoenix 20-30, Children In Need Foundation, Tonto Creek Camp and Arizona State University.\n\nThe cost to send a kid to camp is $400 per student and you can send a child (or two!) to camp for free by simply taking advantage of the Arizona Charitable Tax Credit. For more information on how the tax credit program allows you to sponsor kids at no cost to you or the education programs the tax credits support, please see the information below.\n\nYour donation will ensure that no qualified student is denied the opportunity to attend this camp because of their inability to pay. The camp program is a collaboration between the Aspiring Youth Academy, Phoenix 20-30, Tonto Creek Camp and Arizona State University Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation and teaches students the skills and steps required to turn a dream into a successful company.\n\nPlease donate to the Phoenix 20-30 Aspiring Youth Fund to directly support underprivileged youth attendance to this camp.\n\nThe Arizona Charitable Tax Credit (formerly known as the Working Poor Tax Credit) program was designed to allow you to directly support programs that serve Arizona low income families at a net zero cost to you. The money you give is money you would have otherwise sent to the Arizona Treasury in the form of state income tax.\n\nAny amount you donate (up to the limit) simply reduces the amount of taxes you owe, or increases your refund. The current limit is $421 for individuals or $841 for married couples filing joint returns. The video below provides an overview of how the tax credit program works along with some examples."
