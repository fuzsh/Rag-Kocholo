        "text": "anaheim. costa mesa. huntington beach. irvine. laguna beach. newport beach. orange. seal beach. south county. tustin.\n\nOrange County is a popular travel destination for people all over the world. I am so grateful to have been able to live in the OC for three years. Orange County’s 44 mile coast line is nothing short of jaw dropping views. With over 3 million residents and 34 cities, Orange County is the 6th largest county in America. When I used to think of the OC, I would think of fame and fortune. Yes, Orange County is incredibly expensive however, I am proud to have not only made it in Orange County but to have thoroughly enjoyed my time there. My husband and I loved living in Orange County and I know this will be a place we continue to visit the rest of our lives.\n\nThere are, however, some negatives about the county. With the population as great as it is, traffic can be really, really bad. When planning activities throughout the OC, plan ahead and factor in plenty of drive time. For example, I lived 5.5 miles away from my office and my commute was around 40 minutes one way! Orange County is a large county mileage wise, as well as the population, so consider spending one day in each city rather than driving from city to city in the same day. My best tips for avoiding traffic is to visit in Spring, Fall, or Winter. The Pacific ocean is usually only warm enough to swim in without a wetsuit in August - October. This is why the summertime gets really crowded. Unlike Florida where a lot of tourists visit in the winter, California’s highest tourist season is the summer. My favorite time to visit California is October, the weather is perfect and the water is still warm enough to get in! To avoid traffic, I also recommend leaving your house early in the morning (on a weekend). Not only can traffic be bad, but so can parking. There were countless times that we attempted to go somewhere and had to turn around due to no parking. When driving, make sure to avoid the toll roads if possible. Yes traffic is bad, but do you really want to pay $15 in tolls? Get up early and start your day, you will be thankful!\n\nI remember when we first moved to Orange County, I about fainted when I found out how expensive rent was. On top of expensive rent, I realized that I couldn’t get a margarita anywhere for less than $15! We quickly realized to offset the cost, to dine during happy hours! I highly recommend planning your evenings around happy hour time or to eat at home and just go out for a drink and appetizer rather than a full meal. I also recommend looking at Groupon for activities! We found several deals on Groupon that saved us a lot of money! Finally, in the summer, parking can be up to $25 a day at the beach. Depending on where you are, consider taking an Uber. This will save on parking and will save you the stress of navigating California’s hectic highways.\n\nOrange County is full of incredible beaches, beautiful hikes, dozens of breweries, and world class cuisine. Continue reading for a breakdown of my favorite places throughout the county.\n\nRestaurants:\n\nThe Packing District is a unique food hall full of dozens of small unique restaurants. Some of the establishments are grab and go while others, are full sit down service. The Packing District has many different cuisines, bars, dessert options you can only dream of, and even live music on the weekends.\n\nIn the nearby town of Yorba Linda, we love Tera Wood Fired Pizza. Tera has a large patio, craft pizza, and a long list of wines. What more could you ask for?\n\nBreweries:\n\nThe Anaheim Brewery has a large patio and is within walking distance of the Packing District. Also within walking distance is Unsung Brewing. Unsung has a cartoon theme and has craft paper and crayons all down the bar top. Such a clever idea! Nearby Tera Wood Fired Pizza is The Bruery Terreux. The Bruery has a few different locations across Orange County, each location serving different brews. The Terreux focuses on sours, my favorite! Brewery X is one of my favorite breweries in Orange County. Brewery X has a large, dog friendly patio with lawn games, food trucks, and a live music stage. Brewery X has delicious hard seltzers on tap. Nearby Brewery X is Noble Ale Works. I am still drooling over the Apple Pie brew. Another fun spot is Town Park. The brewery is very modernly decorated and has a great variety of brews.\n\nKarl Strauss is a brewery based out of San Diego but has locations all throughout Southern California. Karly Strauss has great food, a fun atmosphere, and really good beers! The location in Anaheim is one of my favorites because it’s right across from the Angels stadium! Right next door to Karl Strauss is Golden Road. This is my favorite brewery in Orange County. Golden Road is massive. There is a huge indoor space as well as a large, dog friendly, outdoor space. Golden Road has some of my favorite beers such as Mango Cart, Pineapple Cart, and Melon Cart. The brewery is so much fun to go to before an Angels game. Pro tip, don’t pay to park at Angel Stadium, rather, pay $10 to park at Golden Road and they will give you a $5 off coupon for a beer. Such a great deal on game day! Even if there isn’t a game going on, Golden Road is a great spot to hang out!\n\nActivities:\n\nAnaheim is home to both the Anaheim Ducks (Mighty Ducks, anyone?!) and the Los Angeles Angels. Both teams are a blast to watch live. Angels tickets are actually very affordable. I recommend sitting in the Captain Morgan section, but you can also buy nose bleed tickets and move lower, the games are not usually sold out. If you go to an Angels game, make sure to find the make your own hot dog stand on the first floor (think Chipotle but with hot dogs). Nothing better than a Mango Cart, gourmet hotdog, and views of the mountains overlooking the ball park.\n\nCosta Mesa is a hipster’s paradise. Ranging from trendy coffee shops to dive bars to gourmet cuisine, Costa Mesa is an up and coming city.\n\nRestaurants:\n\nIf you want the best donut in the world, stop at Sidecar Donuts! Sidecar makes their donuts fresh every hour so they are always warm. They have vegan and gluten free donuts. My favorite flavors are vanilla bean, huckleberry, and cinnamon crunch.\n\nEl Toro Bravo is my favorite, authentic taco shop. The tortillas are made in-house and the servings are huge! If you want authentic and cheap tacos, this is your spot! Another good lunch spot is Mendocino Farms (Southern California chain). Mendocino is a farm to table lunch spot with gourmet salads and sandwiches (GF and V friendly). The decorations are so unique, I love sitting on their patio.\n\nThe Camp and across the street, The Lab Anti-Mall, are unique shopping centers to walk through. I’ve never experienced such creative plazas before. The Den, located in The Lab is a fun and trendy brunch and lunch spot. Their patio and sangria is all I need on a Friday afternoon!\n\nIf you are feeling like splurging, look no further and dine at Vaca! Vaca has a unique set up and has Spanish styled tapas. The restaurant is dark, moody, and intimate. Their frozen gin and tonic is amazing! Within walking distance is The Water Grill, a beautiful seafood restaurant. If you don’t want to splurge on food, we have gone to The Water Grill for drinks and apps during Happy Hour and then Vaca for a frozen gin and tonic!\n\nBreweries:\n\nAlso at The Lab is Bootlegger’s Brewery and across the street behind The Camp, is the western themed Gunwhale Ales. Both breweries are dog friendly! Two of our favorite dive bars are in Costa Mesa: Wild Goose and Goat Hill Tavern. The Goose has crazy good deals during Happy Hour and Goat Hill has over 100 beers on tap!\n\nActivities:\n\nAcross the street from both Vaca and The Water Grill is South Coast Plaza. South Coast is the largest grossing mall in America and is the largest mall west of the Mississippi. South Coast is home to some of the most expensive stores I have seen as well as your typical department stores. South Coast is beautiful to walk around, especially at Christmas time.\n\nWhen we first moved to Orange County, we lived in Irvine for two years. Irvine is a family-friendly community (most establishments close early). If I were to raise a family in the OC, this is where I would want my kids to grow up. Irvine is clean and very well manicured. The streets are so nice you almost feel like you are on a movie set. Irvine is quickly growing and is an expensive place to live.\n\nRestaurants:\n\nOne of my favorite restaurants in all of Orange County is Habana, located at the Irvine Spectrum Center. Habana is a stylish Cuban and Latin-American restaurant with the most beautiful interior. You truly feel as if you were transported to a tropical setting! I recommend sitting on the smaller of the two patios and ordering a pitcher of sangria, the plantain chips and dip, and the ropa vieja. ChaCha’s at the Marketplace, has a unique open air concept and serves delicious latin inspired food. I recommend visiting for apps and margs or visiting on a Taco Tuesday!\n\nBreweries:\n\nLeft Coast Brewing and Distillery was Irvine’s first brewery! Irvine actually has really strict alcohol laws and does not even allow liquor stores in the whole town. Left Coast is also a smokehouse and a distillery. I highly recommend their blueberry cucumber mule. Hangar 24, based in Redlands, CA, recently opened a location in Irvine. Hanger has delicious beers and a great outdoor atmosphere. Their slogan is, “Adventures we share,” and I couldn’t love it more.\n\nIrvine is very strict on alcohol and quiet hours, however, Irvine is home to one nightclub, Hive & Honey. Hive is located on the rooftop of the Irvine Marriott at the Spectrum Center. Hive and Honey is an upscale bar with DJs on the weekends and gorgeous views. If you are at Hive at 9:30PM, you will be able to watch the Disneyland nightly fireworks show!\n\nActivities:\n\nThe Irvine Farmer’s Market is located at Mariners Church every Saturday morning. I highly recommend this Farmer’s Market, there is a ton of variety. Nearby Mariners Church is a short hike called Turtle Rock. We actually took our engagement photos on Turtle Rock Hill (1.6 miles RT).\n\nRestaurants:\n\nThe Cliff is my favorite restaurant in Laguna. I had walked past The Cliff half a dozen times before I realized the restaurant even existed. The Cliff is hidden behind some kiosk type beach shops and sits on a beautiful cliff overlooking the ocean. The Cliff is dog friendly and has live music on the weekends. I highly recommend the calamari appetizer and the shrimp pasta. A Southern California classic is Wahoo’s fish taco. Though there are dozens of locations across the region, the Laguna location is my favorite. The Wahoo’s in Laguna has a large, dog friendly patio with views of the beach. I recommend their fish taco, 1985 style with their homemade salsa and guacamole. The Harvest Restaurant at The Ranch, rated by National Geographic as a unique location of the world, is a unique property nestled between the canyons. Outside of Harvest is an outdoor patio and bar with fire pits and live music overlooking a golf course. Coyote Grill is an America-Mexican fare restaurant with ocean views. Coyote Grill is a local hotspot with a good Happy Hour. I love their chips and salsa and tacos!\n\nAnother Orange County staple is Banzai Bowl. I’ve had my fair share of acai bowls but I’ve never had one as good as Banzai. I recommend calling to place your order ahead of time as Banzai is always busy with long waits. Trust me, the wait is worth it and if you call ahead, you usually do not have to wait much at all. I recommend the Sharks Cove or Da Kine flavors. I love grabbing a coffee and California bagel (cream cheese, purple onion, tomato, and avocado) at Laguna Coffee Company and then walking down at the beach. Laguna Coffee is dog friendly, even inside. They also have gluten free and vegan breakfast options. The Koffee Klatch is also a good spot to grab coffee.\n\nOther great Laguna restaurants include GG’s Bistro (great mediterranean food on a patio), Carmelita’s (bean dip, ceviche, and margaritas), and Romeo Cucina (Italian that has classic dancing).\n\nBreweries:\n\nLaguna Beach Beer Company in the canyon is an open air concept tasting room. I love the location of this brewery right in the canyon. The brewery is surrounded by cliffs and has a relaxing and beach atmosphere mixed with the artistic vibes that Laguna has to offer. The Deck is a gorgeous spot to grab a cocktail and oysters. The Deck is right on the water! This is a perfect afternoon spot. I also recommend The Rooftop Lounge. The Rooftop has great views, delicious brunch, and an even better Happy Hour. I recommend the ceviche, the pomegranate martini, or any of their mojitos.\n\nActivities:\n\nThe Laguna Canyon Wilderness is full of beautiful hiking trails. I recommend Dartmoor trail (4.4 miles RT).\n\nWhere We Ate:\n\nCircle Hook, located in the beautiful Lido Village, has super fresh fish. Circle Hook is an order at the counter restaurant but the food quality is comparable to a five star restaurant. The fishing boat is docked right outside of the restaurant! I recommend the ceviche and calamari. Also in Lido Village is Nobu. If you are ready to splurge and have the best meal of your life, look no further and dine at Nobu.\n\nLocated in the village of Corona Del Mar, Rose Bakery Cafe was our go to Sunday breakfast spot. Don’t let the long line and over crowded patio scare you, the wait is worth it and the line goes pretty fast. Everything on the menu is so good!\n\nBaja Sharkeez (free chips and salsa!) and Cabo Cantina are both on the peninsula and are great spots to grab a quick margarita before hanging at the beach. Dory’s Deli is also on the peninsula and has fresh salads and sandwiches for lunch. A hidden gem on the peninsula is Il Farro. Il Farro is authentic Italian and is some of the best Italian I have had in California.\n\nActivities:\n\nNewport Beach has a long boardwalk connecting the Newport pier and the Balboa pier. The beach is long and wide and is the perfect beach to to spend the day. We like renting bikes (we usually rent from 20th Street Beach and Bikes) and riding along the boardwalk from Newport all the way to Huntington pier and back (12 miles, RT). If you aren’t feeling as adventurous, we like having a margarita at Sharkeez and then riding bikes to the end of the boardwalk and having a second margarita at Cabo Cantina!\n\nTustin has some of our favorite restaurants. I think many people don’t think twice when they see Tustin on a map, but I know we will always make time for some of our favorite Tustin places!\n\nWhere We Ate:\n\nCentro is my favorite pizza in all of Orange County. Centro is a winery, microbrewery, and pizzeria owned by a beautiful Sicilian family. The modern industrial interior is gorgeous and I’m drooling just thinking of the pizza. I recommend sitting on their patio and ordering either their Honey Wheat Ale or their sangria! Snooze, a western franchise, is our favorite brunch spot! The wait can be up to two hours long! Make sure to download the Yelp app and put your name in ahead of time. Once you check in at the restaurant, you will be way ahead in line! Snooze is an upbeat restaurant that plays hip hop music and serves the best bloody mary’s and pancakes around. Hopdoddy is another franchise but is worth the visit. Hopdoddy has great burgers! I recommend sitting at the bar so you have full service, otherwise, the rest of the restaurant is order at the counter.\n\nBreweries:\n\nTustin Brewing Company is another neighborhood spot that we visited regularly. The happy hour deals are great, and they too, have delicious pizza. Tustin Brewing is the perfect place to watch a game! Sit inside or outside, you will love your experience.\n\nActivities:\n\nWe had a blast learning how to rock climb at Sender One Climbing in Tustin (also found on Groupon).\n\nOverall, Orange County truly is a beautiful place to live and explore. There is adventure and relaxation in every turn. Something I love about Orange County is how close it is to so many other incredible places. Stay tuned for a post on my favorite day trips from Orange County!"
