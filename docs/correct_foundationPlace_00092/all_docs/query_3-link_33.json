        "text": "What We Fund\n\nSince its establishment in 1991, the V. Kann Rasmussen Foundation has made over 800 grants totalling approximately 155 million dollars. We believe our joint efforts have resulted in positive contributions to the environment—and will continue to impact the planet in salutary ways.\n\nThe urgency of dealing with unsustainable consumption, the climate crisis, and their consequential impacts to our natural systems are the overall themes for the V. Kann Rasmussen Foundation. The complexity surrounding the impacts of climate change and scaling of our collective mitigation efforts are primary concerns.\n\nWe work primarily on international-level issues. When they support international learning tools and resources for meaningful action, we engage with a few national and place-based local projects.\n\nWe favor projects that:\n\nconsider all life equally important\n\nuse a systems approach to address root causes and achieve change\n\ntake stock of and tell the truth about the scale, complexity, and urgency of dealing with environmental problems\n\nare based on original thinking, creative ideas, and experimentation\n\nalter power dynamics related to decision-making and influence\n\nhave international significance and perspective, even if they are locally based\n\nOur typical grantees are small or midsize organizations with demonstrated leadership in developing specialized strategies, communicating their vision, and effective project performance.\n\nApplications are by invitation only.\n\nIn the last few years, we have engaged with projects that fall within one of the following four themes:\n\nCultural Resilience and Global Leadership under the Conditions of Environmental Breakdown\n\nDevelopment of systems-level responses to ecological, economic, and social stresses/destabilization/collapse\n\nFurtherance of research related to our psychological and social capacities for dealing with serious climate change, tipping points, and the collapse of natural systems\n\nExploration of sociocultural transformations and strategic planning frameworks that can enhance mitigation under the conditions of environmental breakdown\n\nDevelopment of leadership tools and practices that can be widely and rapidly adopted under the conditions of environmental breakdown\n\nInfrastructure and Communications Support to the Climate Movement\n\nSupport of young advocates to become future movement leaders\n\nNetwork-building, coordination, and knowledge sharing across disciplines and movements\n\nTools to ensure the widest public communication and understanding of climate science\n\nPetrochemicals and Climate\n\nAnalysis of data and auditing of life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions originating from the production of petrochemicals and the manufacturing of products from them\n\nThe Need for Governance of Climate Geoengineering\n\nIn addition, the foundation has a number of ongoing multiyear grants that relate to the urgent need for governance and legal frameworks related to research and deployment of climate geoengineering.\n\nWhat We Do Not Fund\n\nThe V. Kann Rasmussen Foundation does not fund:"
