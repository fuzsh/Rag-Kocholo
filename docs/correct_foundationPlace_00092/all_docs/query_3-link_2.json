        "text": "A non-profit fund dedicated to bringing essential postpartum support, education, and community to families who do not have the resources or insurance coverage to meet these needs otherwise. Fourth Tri Foundation offers full spectrum assistance from prenatal education and movement classes to infant mental health and any other support related to hormone health and education. We will distribute funds to cover education and support services related to any topics that fall under the health and well-being of families.\n\nMake a donation.\n\nDonations will be allocated based on needs in the community and scholarship applicants. The Foundation committee will be helping direct and regulate how these funds are distributed amongst all of the various branches of care we cover. If you are inspired by a specific area of support, you can donate to a specific arm of the non-profit.\n\nA large part of postpartum wellness is centered around the community support of the birthing and new parents. Fourth Tri Foundation’s Gather arm will provide scholarships for those in need to spend time during the first year of postpartum at Fourth Tri, while also taking advantage of the associated education programs that we provide.\n\nThe care and support for new and birthing parents during the postpartum period is crucial, and that is why our Nurture arm of Fourth Tri Foundation exists. We provide perinatal mental health, pelvic floor, feeding, or any other support service that is essential for long- and short-term health. These are offered by experts on our team, but are normally add-on costs at Fourth Tri. Other services that we provide are access to high-quality and organic diapers, wipes, postpartum products, and nourishing food for parents and family.\n\nThe Willow fund will be focused around providing support for families experiencing Grief from Infant Loss, Stillbirth, and Fertility Issues. This will involve support groups and partnerships with Bereavement Specialists and Counselors.\n\nIn memory of Willow Sayig born on December 19, 2023 and lost on December 20, 2023.\n\nApply for a scholarship.\n\nWe are pleased to offer scholarships through the Gather Fund from the Fourth Tri Foundation. Fourth Tri is a space meticulously designed to meet the unique needs of mothers/birthing people and infants during their postpartum journey. As inclusivity is a core value of the Foundation, we are seeking applicants who may not otherwise be able to access our full-spectrum of services, from prenatal education and movement classes to infant mental health care.\n\nScholarships provide on-site access up to 12 hours at Fourth Tri Sanctuary, which can be booked in 2 hour blocks. Scholarship recipients will have access to all on-site support and activities. The Care Concierge and Doula Support staff are dedicated to making your experience at Fourth Tri as meaningful and beneficial as possible."
