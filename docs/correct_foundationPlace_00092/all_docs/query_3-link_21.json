        "text": "WHAT IF ALL BLACK WOMEN, MEN, BOYS, GIRLS, TRANS, AND NON BINARY PEOPLES ENJOYED OPTIMAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING IN A\n\nSOCIALLY JUST SOCIETY?\n\nWHAT WOULD OUR WORLD LOOK LIKE? HOW DIFFERENT WOULD IT BE?\n\nWhen slavery ended, no one sat down the freed former enslaved people’s for group therapy or individual therapy. The Therapy Fund Foundation recognizes the deep intergenerational wounds that have been passed down to Black Americans across generations up to present day. There is a vital need for immediate and affordable mental health supports in the Black community. Over the past few weeks, and for decades past, Black people have been sorely affected by explicit, implicit, and systemic racism that until recently has not been addressed. This community is aching for a way to heal. This fund is a place for people to tangibly put their outrage, sadness, shock, fear, anger and solidarity into action to actively support Black-led healing from the impacts of White supremacy through mental health supports for Black people.\n\nThe WA Therapy Fund is an approved 501(c)3 nonprofit charitable organization status.\n\n“Until there are systems in place ensuring those in need can receive free therapy and those who provide it are adequately compensated there will always be a place for the therapy fund!”\n\n- Founder -Ashley McGirt-Adair\n\nThe Therapy Fund Foundation was founded in an effort to eliminate barriers to Black healing. In direct response to the incessant police brutality and anti-Blackness the Therapy Fund Foundation was birthed. Therapy is expensive and insurance plans often offer low reimbursement rates for clinicians compiled with student loan debt and business costs. Capitalism and other oppressive systems can have profound impacts on our ability to cope and maintain healthy work/life balance, thus can even create and reinforce negative self-talk and messaging. This can contribute to depression, anxiety, and suicidality. Let’s alleviate this financial burden for our Black community.\n\nWHO WE SERVE: BLACK WOMEN AND GIRLS. BLACK MEN AND BOYS. BLACK TRANS, NON BINARY, AND ANYONE THROUGHOUT THE DIASPORA!\n\nWHAT WE DO : Eliminate barriers to healing by providing free mental health services, education, and advocacy! Learn more about the programs we provider HERE!\n\n“As a Black therapist I am constantly working to find creative ways to apply theory developed from and for White people on people of color. As much as I love and appreciate Sigmund Frued for his works I have to acknowledge that he only treated white wealthy jewish women. So on my quest to help heal those who look like me I sought out the works of other psychologist, social workers, and clinicians of color like that of Kenneth & Mammie Clark and even present day like Dr. Joy Degruy who coined Post traumatic slave syndrome, all the way to Dolores Constance McDowell, I call her grandmother. She had a masters in mathematics and science, she didn’t hold any degrees in psychology, but she was my first therapist. Her wisdom that carried the wisdom and therapeutic practices of my ancestors is the reason I stand before you today and the reason the Therapy Fund Foundation was created.” -Ashley McGirt- Adair"
