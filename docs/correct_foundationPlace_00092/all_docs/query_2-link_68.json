LOVELOUD offers hope to people, letting them know they’re not alone and encouraging acceptance in the home and community. It all begins with talking, sharing and showing the realities of what LGBTQ+ individuals face daily.\n\nLOVELOUD is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that produces a yearly charity concert that amplifies the voices of our LGBTQ+ friends and family and brings together a variety of communities through the power of music and the sharing of stories.\n\nLOVELOUD’s mission is to Ignite the vital conversation about what it means to unconditionally love, understand, support, accept and celebrate our LGBTQ+ friends and family. When you go to a LOVELOUD show the goal is for you to be loved, seen, and to foster connection.\n\nYou can learn more about the origins of LOVELOUD by watching our Emmy nominated, Hollywood Film Award, and GLAAD Media Award winning HBO documentary Believer.\n\nThe second LOVELOUD was held at the University of Utah’s Rice Eccles Stadium. and hosted an audience of 35,000+, and a online audience of over 7 million.

Governor of Utah Spencer Cox.\n\nThe profits from this show resulted in grant donations that were spread between local and national charities such as The Tegan and Sara Foundation, GLAAD, Equality Utah, Encircle, Mama Dragons and many more.\n\nIn 2022 the LOVELOUD festival made its long awaited return after a 2 year hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. LOVELOUD’s fourth festival was held at the Vivint Arena in Salt Lake City, Utah. There were 10,000 in attendance. Hosted by Kalen Allen the musical acts included Storyboards and Jakk Fynn, Silver Cup, Mat and Savanna, Parson, James, Neon Trees, morgxn, WILLOW, David Archuleta, local LGBTQ youth, Dan Reynolds of Imagine Dragons, and Anitta.
