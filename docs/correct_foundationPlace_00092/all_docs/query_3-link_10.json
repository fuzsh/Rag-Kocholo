        "text": "About Us\n\nOur mission is to improve lives through the power of literacy. We strive each and every day to advance our vital mission and realize Barbara Bush’s vision of literacy for all.\n\nOur Legacy\n\nThe Barbara Bush Houston Literacy Foundation is an important part of the living legacy of Barbara Bush and remains grateful for the many generous donors who contribute their time, talent, and treasure to benefiting the lives of others through literacy. Mrs. Bush’s vision of literacy for all continues to inspire us, and she shall forever remain a beacon of light for the countless individuals who live in the darkness of low literacy. It is through each of us her legacy shall live on and her vision of literacy for all become a reality.\n\n“If you help a person to read, then their opportunities in life will be endless.”\n\n— First Lady Barbara Bush\n\nOur Work\n\nWe advance our mission through a focus on five key imperatives: (1) increasing access to books in the home of low-income children; (2) expanding access to out-of-school-time educational programs and in-school reading interventions in high-need neighborhoods; (3) supporting parents as their child’s first and most important teachers through high-quality family literacy programs; (4) giving adults a second chance to gain the functional skills needed to fully engage in the workplace and participate society; and (5) engaging an army of volunteers in purposeful and meaningful service opportunities.\n\n“We champion the literacy cause across the Greater Houston community and have a proven track record of success in implementing research-based and innovative programs.”\n\n— Julie Finck, Ph.D., President & CEO\n\nOur Team\n\nEffective governance and strong leadership are at the heart of our organization. It is only by harnessing the collective talents and efforts of our Board of Directors and staff that we will continue to advance our mission, achieve results, and assure for the long-term sustainability of our programs and the organization’s vitality. We invite you to learn about the passionate, gifted people who are dedicated to difference making through literacy in our city and for all who call Houston “home.”\n\nJoin Our Team\n\n“We pride ourselves on fostering vibrant, cross-sector partnerships, as we fully recognize that the enormity of the literacy problem in our city is simply impossible to address alone.”\n\n— Neil Bush, Chairman & Co-Founder\n\nOur Literacy Partner Network\n\nSolving Houston’s pervasive literacy problem requires a comprehensive, unified approach involving all organizations who provide literacy services and resources. That is why our Literacy Partner Network is so important. We regularly convene literacy-focused organizations – school districts, library systems, nonprofits, and others – to provide thought leadership and professional development, a forum to share ideas and issues, and cultivate collaborations. We also have strong partnerships with literacy organizations to innovate new literacy programs or resources or expand existing literacy services or resources to reach more people in need.\n\nOur Corporate Partners\n\nWe have continued to witness the vital role companies can play as a driver to social change and are grateful to the many companies who are embracing literacy as a key priority in their corporate social responsibility efforts. Through employee engagement opportunities, commitment of pro bono expertise, program investments, and event sponsorships, our corporate partners have been a catalyst for our work in the community. In addition, our Corporate Advisory Council members commit time , talent, and thought leadership on our strategic direction, messaging, and programmatic implementation.\n\n“We are a nation of communities, a brilliant diversity spread like stars, like a thousand points of light in a broad and peaceful sky.”\n\n— President George H.W. Bush\n\nVolunteers change lives.\n\nJoin us in making a difference in the lives of children and adults through the power of literacy."
