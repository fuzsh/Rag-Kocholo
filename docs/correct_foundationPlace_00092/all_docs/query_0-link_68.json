        "text": "The levels are assigned according to how much information is voluntarily provided to GuideStar by the nonprofit about their organization.\n\nGuideStar gathers initial data from the IRS, which collects that data from all organizations throughout the country via tax forms. Nonprofits can then provide additional information to GuideStar to raise their profile level.\n\nFor instance, Bronze level requires basic information such as the mission statement, description of programs, and geographic region served.\n\nPlatinum requires the addition of further data and explanation of finances, goals and strategies, and progress and results (as determined by the nonprofit).\n\nThese are different categories of tax-exempt organizations that are listed in the tax code, primarily in the 501(c) section. In other words, these are the categories the IRS uses to determine the particular legal and tax status of any nonprofit.\n\nThe bulk of nonprofits are categorized as 501(c)(3) organizations, which are public charities and private foundations. For more on how the IRS defines “charitable purposes,” visit this page on the IRS website.\n\nFirst, as always, check your spelling when doing searches!\n\nBut second, it’s possible the organization you’re looking for is a subsidiary of a larger parent organization. If the subsidiary isn’t registered with the IRS – the primary source of data in this directory – as an independent nonprofit organization located in our area but instead operates under the legal tax status of a parent organization headquartered elsewhere, they won’t appear in this directory.\n\nThird, if the organization you’re looking for is a church or other religious organization, it’s possible they are not officially registered with the IRS.\n\nChurches and other religious organizations that meet the standards of other tax-exempt organizations automatically receive tax-exempt status without having to register with the IRS. This means churches don’t have the burdens of paperwork that other nonprofits do, but it also means the IRS doesn’t necessarily have publicly available data on these churches unless they decide themselves to register with the IRS.\n\nAs discussed in the question and answer above, if you can’t find an organization you’re looking for in our directory, try searching GuideStar’s national database."
