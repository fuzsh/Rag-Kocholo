If a dialog window appears telling you to restart your computer, do so.\n\nIf the component is available, make sure it is checked.\n\nShare a folder, drive, or printer\n\nOnce File and Printer Sharing are installed, to share a folder or drive:\n\nRight-click the folder or drive you want to share.\n\nSelect Properties, and then, on the Sharing tab, select Advanced Sharing.\n\nSelect Share this folder.\n\nIn the appropriate fields, type the name of the share (as it appears to other computers), the maximum number of simultaneous users, and any comments that should appear beside it.\n\nIf you would like to grant access to particular groups or individuals, select Permissions to add the appropriate groups or usernames.\n\nIf you are using NTFS, check the permissions in the Security tab to ensure that they are properly set to allow access to the share. Because Security settings override Share permissions, it is possible for people on the Permissions list to be denied access to the share because they either are not specified or are denied specifically in the Security list.\n\nNote:\n\nFAT32 does not provide the same level of security as NTFS; if you're using FAT32, you will not see the Security tab.\n\nSelect OK.\n\nTo share a printer:\n\nFrom the Control Panel, open Devices and Printers.\n\nRight-click the printer you want to share, and then select Printer Properties.\n\nOn the Sharing tab, check Share this Printer.\n\nUnder \"Share name\", select a shared name to identify the printer.\n\nSelect OK.\n\nAccess a shared folder or printer\n\nTo find and access a shared folder or printer:\n\nSearch for Network, and select to open it.\n\nSelect Search Active Directory at the top of the window; you may need to first select the Network tab on the upper left.\n\nFrom the drop-down menu next to \"Find:\", select either Printers or Shared Folders.\n\nYou can now enter search terms in the appropriate fields to modify the search; to start the search, select Find Now. To search for shared printers and folders that match any criteria, select Find Now without entering any search terms.\n\nYou will see a list of shared printers and folders that are available on the network. Double-click the item to which you want to connect.\n\nIf you know the exact name of the computer and the share, or the exact name of the printer, you can enter it directly:\n\nIn a search field, enter two backslashes, the name of the computer, another backslash, and the name of the share or printer; for example, if the name of the computer is bl-iub-threepio.ads.iu.edu and the name of the share is r2d2, enter:\n\n\\\\bl-iub-threepio.ads.iu.edu\\r2d2\n\nSelect OK."
