        "text": "A primary goal is cataloging the work that Leiter left behind, which comprises thousands of prints, slides, negatives, and paintings. The SLF is working toward completing a catalogue raisonné to be made available for study by students, curators, writers, and art professionals.\n\nLectures on Leiter’s life and work, and on archiving and general conservation techniques, are given by the foundation’s directors, in grade schools, high schools, colleges, universities, and other institutions. These lectures often accompany Leiter’s traveling exhibitions; recent talks have been held at the Photographers’ Gallery in London; FOMU in Antwerp, Belgium; Bunkamura in Tokyo; and the Itami City Museum of Art in Itami, Japan.\n\nIn 2018, the foundation began cataloging the tens of thousands of color slides in Leiter’s archive, with images dating as far back as 1948. Some of these discoveries have been shown as projections in the 2020 Japanese traveling exhibition Forever Saul Leiter, and in Aperture magazine’s spring 2021 “New York” issue.\n\nThe Saul Leiter Foundation is currently preparing to celebrate the centennial of Leiter’s birth in 2023."
