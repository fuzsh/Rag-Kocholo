        "text": "Mayor Acquanetta Warren opened the summit by welcoming the group to the City of Fontana and presenting a city proclamation for water safety, which highlighted the critical importance of ensuring that all communities, especially those that are underserved, are provided access to swim lessons, and safe waterplay. “We may not have beautiful beaches, but we have over 3000 water play options in our Region” said the Mayor as she recognized the Coalition for its efforts in bringing the summit to the Inland Empire and its dedication to educating water safety professionals about the vast array of water opportunities in this portion of the state.\n\nSummit attendees had the opportunity to hear from Keynote speaker Brenda Villa, four-time Olympian and San Bernardino Resident, who discussed her trailblazing water polo career and the critical importance of ensuring access to aquatic spaces and swim opportunities for all Californians. A featured panel discussion on drowning prevention context and action in the Inland Empire explored the complexities of the host region from multiple perspectives with panelists representing parks and recreation, public health, fire and rescue, inland open water lifeguarding and community foundations. Dr. Justin Sempsrott, a globally recognized expert in drowning resuscitation, also joined the event as the second Keynote speaker, discussing the evolution of drowning resuscitation with emphasis on emerging issues that the sector will address in the next decade, including the multifaceted effects of climate change and the emerging recognition of the mental health component of drowning and its prevention.\n\nThe Summit also featured a series of wide-ranging panel discussions with 24 different speakers representing all regions of the state and drowning prevention sectors. Topics included the progress and challenges of implementing the California Water Safety Strategy, the role of State government departments in drowning prevention, innovative ways to partner with schools and fund aquatic facilities and programming, the increasing complexities of flooding and water-related emergency preparedness in the state, and the growing trend of apnoeic fitness activities and crucial role of underwater hypoxic blackout education and prevention.\n\nFive breakout workshops were scheduled into the agenda. Attendees advanced important conversations on establishing certification and training standards for ocean lifeguards and forming sustainable partnerships with schools to promote drowning prevention education. Specific working sessions focused on concrete ways to advance access to inclusive aquatic spaces, elevating the public significance of drowning with strategic communications, and the implementation of the California Department of Public Health’s Pilot Drowning Data Program mandated by California Senate Bill 855.\n\nWhile the Summit largely focused on State-level drowning prevention strategies and activities, one specific session focused on local action. Attendees had the opportunity to learn from representatives of community water safety coalitions from other states, who shared experiences of success and failure and provided recommendations for those motivated to advance collaborative water safety initiatives in their community. Following the panel, participants from throughout the State of CA and leaders from AZ, HI, ID, FL, TX and Mexico broke into groups based on their county/region to discuss how collective action and partnership in their community could advance.\n\nAt the close of the 2024 California Water Safety Summit, we look forward to future collaborative activities at state and local levels before we assemble again in 2025, and highlight the following major takeaways from our time together in Fontana:\n\nMultisectoral collaboration is key – our efforts are better together.\n\nAccess and inclusion must continue to be central components of drowning prevention initiatives at all levels.\n\nData is critical and efforts to improve collection are improving.\n\nInnovative funding opportunities exist - the future financing of drowning prevention efforts including aquatic infrastructure and staffing requires creative and outside the box thinking.\n\nIn addition to prevention, our agenda must build resilience with enthusiastic promotion of safe aquatic activity.\n\nDrowning rescue and prevention work is evolving – we must be prepared for future challenges.\n\nAs we collectively work towards advancing key activities in the California Water Safety Strategy, increasing the operational capacity of the Coalition to support and help coordinate efforts is paramount.\n\n2024 Summit Location: Inland Empire\n\nThe California Water Safety Coalition was honored to hose the 2024 Summit in the City of Fontana. San Bernardino and Riverside Counties (The Inland Empire, or “IE”) are home to just over 4.5 million people and the region is predicted to grow twice as fast as the rest of Southern California in the next 25 years. While it doesn’t have a coastline, the Inland Empire is home to a diverse range of inland lakes and reservoirs (Big Bear Lake, Lake Perris, Silverwood Lake, Lake Elsinore, and the California side of Havasu, just to name a few), several river systems including the Santa Ana River and the California side of the Colorado River, and thousands of swimming pools including aquatic facilities, community centers, and residential backyard pools - there are over 40,000 pools in the Palm Springs city limits alone!\n\nWhile there are some similarities, the context for drowning is different in the IE compared to other parts of the state, and will be the topic of a Featured Panel Discussion at the Summit. Compared to the rest of California’s counties, drowning rates (fatal and non-fatal) of San Bernardino and Riverside County residents are 19% higher [Data from California Department of Public Health]. While the region does have higher rates, it also features some incredible drowning prevention programs and activities that the rest of the state can learn from, including the California’s most advanced and comprehensive county-level drowning data collection system."
