        "text": "The East Hampton Healthcare Foundation\n\nThe mission of the East Hampton Healthcare Foundation is to improve the quality\n\nand availability of healthcare for all citizens of the Town of East Hampton,\n\nincluding the uninsured and underinsured, with one standard of care for all.\n\nRead the East Hampton Healthcare Foundation History Book Attached\n\nIn 1997, a quality of life survey identified the poor quality and lack of available medical care in East Hampton as one of the most serious issues facing the community.\n\nIn order to address the need for improved healthcare, the East Hampton Healthcare Foundation was founded under the leadership of John R. Kennedy, Chairman, and Jerome J. DeCosse, Jr. MD, Ph.D. President. The Foundation’s initial phase, to conceptualize and build the 18,000 square-foot state-of-the-art East Hampton Healthcare Center at 200 Pantigo Place was completed in February 2002 concurrent with physician recruitment.\n\nIn 2002, the leadership baton was passed to Henry L. Murray, Chairman, and Gerard M. Turino, M.D., President. The Board of Trustees made up of local residents governs the EHHF. The Foundation receives no government funding and is funded entirely through contributions from the community. After 20 years of service by Mr. Murray and Dr. Turino, Gerald H. Cromack II, Chairman, and Peter M. Odell, MD, President, were elected by the Board of Trustees.\n\nThe second phase, the development of programs, began concurrently with the establishment of the Center in 2002. Administration of the Center, the programs and the Foundation is under the direction of Sheila Rogers, who has worked with the Trustees since the inception of the Foundation.\n\nThe third phase, undertaken in 2007, was to assess the need and then construct East Hampton Urgent Care now managed and operated by Meeting House Lane Medical Associates, a division of Stony Brook Southampton Hospital. Click here for more information on East Hampton Urgent Care.\n\nPhase four, the development of the Free-Standing Satellite East Hampton Emergency Department, was initiated in 2020 with a fundraising campaign. Now under construction at 400 Pantigo Place, East Hampton, with an anticipated opening in late fall of 2024, the facility will be a full freestanding emergency department, which in 70% of cases will be ‘treat’ and release’ patients, young and old. There will be fast track, pediatric, OBGYN, cardiac, resuscitation, bariatric patient rooms, full imaging including CT scan, MRI, Ultra Sound, X‐Ray, and a testing lab and pharmacy onsite. Stony Brook Medicine, board-certified Emergency Medicine physicians will staff it and an onsite ambulance will be ready 24/7 for transport to Stony Brook Southampton Hospital or Stony Brook University Hospital when needed."
