        "text": "OUR ROOTS RUN DEEP.\n\nThe Ash Grove Charitable Foundation makes grants annually to support the work of public charities with tax exempt status under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code in the geographical markets that we serve.\n\nAs one of the largest cement companies in the United States and one of the oldest still in operation, Ash Grove plays an important part in the foundation and infrastructure of our country. And with plants from coast to coast, being a good neighbor in the communities in which we live and serve is a priority and part of our DNA.\n\nAsh Grove territory is a lot of ground to cover. We believe in active participation to improve the existing and future quality of life in the communities we serve. This participation includes financial support to charitable activities. We aren’t just focused on building highways and buildings – we are also helping to build better communities.\n\nWe're honored to be part of the communities in which our employees live and work. In 2023, the Ash Grove Charitable Foundation donated approximately $735,000 to over 100 qualifying charities.\n\nFor more information or to apply for a grant from the Ash Grove Charitable Foundation, please click here.\n\nNote: the link above will bring you to a third party website, owned and operated by an independent party over which Ash Grove has no control (\"3rd Party Website\"), and is provided by Ash Grove for the express purpose of administering applications for Ash Grove Charitable Foundation grants.
