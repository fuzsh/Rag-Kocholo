        "text": "Imagine receiving a dreaded diagnosis of cancer. Now imagine on top of that diagnosis, being too sick to work or not being able to work a full schedule and provide for your family due to limited resources or having no support system in the area at all or becoming newly single because your husband or significant other leaves when hearing the diagnosis because this isn’t what they signed up for—it is happening more and more. Or imagine that you can’t go to your treatments or appointments because you don’t have the money for gas? That is when the Helene Foundation steps in. The Helene Foundation does not have a financial requirement. Our only requirement is the mother must be in active cancer treatment at a Triangle area treatment facility, and there must be children under the age of 18 years old living in the home. We can aid these families through services, so that the lives of the children continue with as much normalcy as possible. These families are struggling. Often, these families are a single mother trying her best to provide for her family. Her added worry over trying to cover the additional expenses or loss of income only adds to her stress level which impacts her overall health. Added stress impacts mothers and families in the best of times, but onto top of a cancer diagnosis, it is immeasurable! There have been many times that a mother tells us she is so grateful for our assistance because now she doesn’t have to choose between putting food on the table or going to her treatments and appointments. The first time you hear those words it takes your breath away."
