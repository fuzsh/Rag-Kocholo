        "text": "“I served in the Army. We were the first combat brigade into Iraq and the last to pull out. When I got medically retired, I never thought in a million years I would be homeless. I was living on the railroad tracks and the way people treated me… they treated me like I was a criminal… it really hurt. It was tough. Everybody has a story.\n\nYou have to take the time to listen to it.”\n\n— Patricia, Illumination Foundation Client\n\nPatricia, Brenda, & Jeremiah\n\nPatricia first came to Illumination Foundation with her mother, Brenda, and her one-year-old son, Jeremiah. Patricia was working full time when she lost her pension due to an error made by the VA, but her income alone was not enough to pay for the apartment, and they soon became homeless."
