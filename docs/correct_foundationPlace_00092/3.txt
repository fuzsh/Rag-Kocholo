COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP

As part Huntington Beach, Pacific City is a neighborhood hub that stives to connect with our community in a meaningful way. We welcome local organizations, host charitable events, and maintain an active schedule of family-friendly events and promote community involvement year-round.

We see the greater community as a partner, and our team as a driver of relationships. And itâ€™s all formed around the idea of creating a sense of place driven by our retailers and the community.

If you are interested in a community partnership with Pacific City, please contact info@pacificcity.com for more information on opportunities.
