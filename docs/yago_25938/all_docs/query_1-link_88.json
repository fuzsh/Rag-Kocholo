        "text": "One of the women who I have always admired is Marisa Wayne. I’ve known her for many years and always respected how she has been able to use her name and talent to inspire others to give back. Marisa is the daughter of actor John Wayne, an American legend and icon who passed away in 1979 from stomach cancer when she was thirteen. Marisa and her family have gone on to start a foundation in his name to battle cancer, the John Wayne Cancer Foundation, and she also utilizes the spin studio she co-founded, Grit Cycle, to give back to charities with regular Karma rides that raise money for various organizations and their upcoming Gritty Up Benefit that gives back to the John Wayne Cancer Foundation.\n\nWe sat down recently with Marisa, her mother Pilar, brother Ethan and daughter Carmela at their foundation offices in Newport Beach to learn a little more.\n\nIntroducing Marisa Wayne…\n\nWhat does “The Art of Being Female” mean to you in terms of health and in terms of family/legacy?\n\nIt definitely takes some juggling to try to balance out all the responsibilities that come with being a mother, daughter, businesswoman and John Wayne Cancer Foundation spokeswoman. There is a lot of guilt when I can’t be at a game because I have to work or if I go to the game, then I feel guilty for not being at work.\n\nI think the “art” is not being too hard on yourself when you are spread thin. It’s not selfish if you need an hour to yourself to take a spin or yoga class or just go to lunch once in a while with your friends. You need to prioritize your physical and mental health in order to take care of everyone else. It’s so much easier said than done but it’s important. I have clients who tell me the 45 minutes in the saddle room is their therapy. That’s the time where they can lose themselves in the music and ride side by side with others who support and inspire them. It’s so important to find whatever gives you that time to refresh and recharge and take care of yourself.\n\nYour father was John Wayne and you were raised mostly in Newport Beach, CA. Can you tell us a little bit about what it was like growing up with your father being a beloved actor, national icon and symbol of courage and honor?\n\nAt the time, he was just my dad. I knew he was a famous actor but we were so removed from the “Hollywood” scene because we lived in Newport, which was fairly sleepy and quiet back then. He was a great dad, very attentive, kind and affectionate. He had a fantastic sense of humor and was always playful. It wasn’t until well after he passed that I truly understood his legacy, how beloved he was and still is not only in the USA but around the world. What’s it like for me?\n\nTwofold: 1.) Pretty damn cool. I am so proud of my dad and the work my family does in his name. With the support of so many and the hard work of dedicated doctors trained at the John Wayne Cancer Institute, we are making a difference in patients lives and coming closer to finding better treatments and hopefully, one day, a cure.\n\nAnd 2.) It’s a huge responsibility for my siblings and I to uphold his legacy. He used to tell me that my actions would reflect on him and that by doing something stupid, it could possibly damage all his hard work over the last 40+ years! We all do stupid stuff and make mistakes and he knew that, so he also said, “Learn from it and move forward. No use dwelling on the past or things you can’t change.” Even though he died when I was 13 years old, I have tried to live up to his expectations. I’m fairly certain wherever he is, he looking down and pretty darn proud of us. Obviously, he left an impression and was quite influential in the short time we had together.\n\nI thought it was really interesting that your father grew up in LA and attended USC on a football scholarship until he was injured ( body surfing in Newport Beach), and then started working on films after leaving school. I never knew that about him! If he hadn’t been injured he may never have gone into the movie industry and completed over 170 films in his career. Did you ever consider pursuing acting?\n\nI did. I moved to LA after high school and started working as a page at ABC studios and took acting lessons. It wasn’t for me. I did have a lot of fun doing dinner theatre in Texas with my brother, Patrick, but I didn’t last long in LA and moved to Steamboat Springs, CO after a couple of years to continue my education and discover my passion for health & wellness.\n\nI grew up watching John Wayne movies. There is something so all-American and patriotic about them, and watching them reminds me of when I was younger. I recently watched the sequel to True Grit, Rooster Cogburn again, and it is one of my favorites. He and Katharine Hepburn were amazing together and I loved their banter. If you could choose a favorite movie of his, which would it be and why?\n\nThat was a good one! He and Katherine Hepburn had great respect for one another and he really enjoyed working with her on that film. My favorite is The Quiet Man, set in Ireland. It’s difficult to explain why it’s my favorite but I just love the characters and the love story. He was so handsome and Maureen O’Hara was strong and feisty and was just a perfect leading lady for him. They had amazing chemistry and it really was perfect in this film.\n\nHow often were you able to go on set with him – you must have met some pretty amazing actors of that generation. Who was your favorite?\n\nI love The Shootist too, although it’s difficult to watch him die in the end. I spent a lot of time with him on that set and have fond memories of meeting Ron Howard, Jimmy Stewart and Lauren Bacall. He was a huge fan of Ron Howard and wanted to work with him again, but never got the chance. I remember him telling me that he knew Ron Howard had a very bright future ahead, and he was right!\n\nHow did your mother influence you growing up? You mentioned she was quite a businesswoman herself, and you have shown the same characteristics! What kind of businesses was she involved in?\n\nMy mom was a huge influence. She was a very active working mom who was always absolutely passionate about whatever she was doing. She started me playing tennis very young and I am so grateful because it was the best foundation for starting a healthy, active life. When I was about 8 years old she told me she’d give me $100 if I could beat her 2 out of 3 sets in tennis. She knew how to motivate me! I worked so hard until finally one day, I did beat her and she paid up. I just presented the same offer to my daughter so we’ll see how long it takes until I have to shell out!\n\nShe also had an interior design business and a restaurant! She was always on the cutting edge of the newest diet, or health craze and even wrote 2 cookbooks. I love cooking too and use her recipes often.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite memories of things that you and your mother did together?\n\nShe had a house right on the water in Diamond Head, Oahu and we used to go to Hawaii quite often. I have great memories of our trips not only there, but we went to Hong Kong and China a few years ago too which was really cool. We’ve traveled around the country and always have a lot of fun in NYC. My mom and dad had an apartment there and she showed me a few of their favorite restaurants. Even now, we do like to have lunch with each other at least once or twice a month, usually at Fashion Island. Sometimes I’ll bring the kids along and she’ll sneak some money into their hands and they can run around and shop while we enjoy a nice long lunch.\n\nYour father beat lung cancer in 1964, and then battled stomach cancer and passed away in 1979. Your family and brother Ethan Wayne now run the John Wayne Cancer Foundation.The foundation’s mission is to “bring courage, strength and grit to the fight against cancer”. The foundation provides funds for programs that improve cancer patient care, including research, training oncologists, education, wellness and support. How did you and your family start the foundation in 1985?\n\nBefore my dad died, he said, “Kids, if my name is good for anything, please used it to help people beat cancer.” My brother Michael, started the Foundation in his name and now, over thirty years later we are still going strong and saving lives.\n\nIt was so nice to see you with your mom Pilar and brother Ethan in the foundation office, where you both put in time to help others. What are you most proud of that the foundation does?\n\nI’m extremely proud of the Surgical Oncology Fellowship program where we train doctors from around the world in their surgical specialty. After their fellowship at the John Wayne Cancer Institute, they go off to work around the world at different institutions. We have an ever-growing network of John Wayne surgeons out there making a difference in part due to funding from the John Wayne Cancer Foundation.\n\nThe most effective way to beat cancer is to prevent it. The John Wayne Cancer Foundation funds a program called “Block the Blaze” where we educate kids every summer to wear and reapply sunscreen, wear hats and check your skin for any suspicious looking moles. It’s a terrific program. Every summer we provide hats and sunscreen to thousands of junior lifeguards across the country.\n\nHow involved are you in the foundation-what kinds of things do you do?\n\nI am as active as I can be. If I’m needed at an event or conference, I am happy to go represent. As I answer these questions, I am returning from the American Society of Breast Surgeons meeting in Orlando, FL. I went with my niece, Anita Swift, who is President of the John Wayne Cancer Institute Auxiliary. We attended a few meetings on the future of breast cancer treatment and represented our family at a reception with about 20 John Wayne alumni fellows.\n\nYou are surrounded by research and doctors involved in finding a cure for cancer and cancer prevention. How far off do you think it is to finding a cure?\n\nWell, I think we are a ways off from finding a cure, but we are making tremendous strides in treatment and detection. Immunotherapy is now a common practice. Cancer cells sometimes are undetected by our immune systems. Certain immunotherapies can mark cancer cells so the immune system can find them and destroy them. Early detection is so important so make sure to get your check ups!\n\nHow important is diet and exercise in being preventing cancer?\n\nWell, a healthy lifestyle is not only important to prevent cancer and many other diseases. Unfortunately, even the healthiest among us, can receive a devastating diagnosis, but if you are strong and healthy, you will have a much better recovery. Take care of yourself mentally and physically and have the faith that you can get through anything. I see people do it all the time.\n\nI can imagine that cancer prevention is close to your heart. In addition to the gala The Associates for Breast Cancer Studies holds in Los Angeles that benefits the John Wayne Cancer Institute, you have started an amazing fundraiser every year with the business you co-own with Matt Bourne, Grit Cycle, a popular spin studio that frequently has rides benefitting various charities. The Gritty Up for the John Wayne Cancer event is held in honor of the John Wayne Cancer Foundation. You have come a long way and raised a lot of money thru the years. Last year you raised $300,000 and after this year will hopefully get to almost to $1,000,000 total. I’m so proud of you Marisa and your Grit Cycle team! How did you come up with this idea for the Gritty UP?\n\nThanks Chris! We knew before we opened that we wanted to give back and Matt knows how important the John Wayne Cancer Foundation is to me so we decided to have a 3 hour spin class where folks would go out and fundraise. At the time we had 40 bikes and I told Matt that I’d be thrilled if we could ask everyone to set a goal of $1000 per bike. Matt said he thought they could do more than that. He set the bar at $2500 per bike and don’t you know, he was right! We raised over $200K that first year and I would have been thrilled with just $40K. Matt has that ability to push you farther than you think you can go. He knows you can do it if you put in the work and that’s why he is such an inspirational instructor and partner.\n\nWhat is the most important advice you could give your daughter?\n\nBelieve in yourself and follow your heart. Be kind, grateful and respectful. Don’t be too hard on yourself and know that you are beautiful, loved and cherished by your mama!\n\nYou work really hard between Grit Cycle, and your John Wayne Cancer Foundation commitments. What do you like to do in your down time to relax?\n\nWhat’s that 😉 Lol!\n\nWe have known each other a really long time…probably more than 25 years which is so wild! We were just saying we need to resurrect the girls trips we used to go on to San Francisco, New York and Napa every year before all of us became embedded in motherhood and work! Those were some fun times where we could have some down time, drink wine and have some fun! How important are girlfriends to you, and what are your favorite things to do with them?\n\nI love my girlfriends!!! Seriously girl trips are the best and we totally need to get another one on the books!! But even if you don’t have 2 or 3 days to get away, just a meal or a glass of wine can make a huge difference at the end of the day."
