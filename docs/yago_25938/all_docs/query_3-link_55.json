        "text": "By Chuck Stinnett\n\nSteve Blackwell had been a fan of John Wayne since he was old enough to watch movies. Forty years ago, during a short stay in Southern California, he figured it was time to meet the movie star.\n\nBlackwell said he did it the easiest way he knew how. He knocked on Wayne’s front door.\n\nYears later, he would serve as a Henderson police officer. But in 1973, the Southern Indiana native was a 32-year-old sergeant and military policeman in the Marine Corps Forces Reserve. That summer, he was sent to Camp Pendleton near San Diego for two weeks of training. When he got some leave time one day, he headed north in his khaki Marine uniform to the affluent seaside enclave of Newport Beach, where John Wayne lived.\n\nUpon arrival, he did some clever detective work; he asked a passer-by if he knew where John Wayne lived. The man did; over on Bayshore Drive, “There were three palm trees, like this,” Blackwell said, holding up the middle three fingers on one hand in the shape of a “W.” Next door to those trees, at 2686 Bayshore Drive, was the home of the famous movie cowboy.\n\n“I knocked on the door,” he said, “and a little Filipino, I guess, in a white shirt and black bow tie and black pants answered the door. I said, ‘Does John Wayne live here?’ ”\n\nYes, the butler answered.\n\n“Can I see him?”\n\n“Is this Marine Corps business?”\n\n“No, I’m just a fan,” Blackwell said. “I just want to meet him and take a picture.”\n\nThe butler told him to wait there and disappeared inside the bayside mansion. He returned a few moments later: “He’ll see you. Come on in.”\n\nMeeting The Duke\n\nDown a corridor they walked, through the house and out to the backyard. There, Blackwell said, was The Duke.\n\n“He said, ‘Come in, sergeant,’ ” Blackwell said. “I said, ‘Damn, you’re John Wayne!’ We shook hands and had a drink” — a bourbon and water — “and talked for about four hours. He was a nice guy.”\n\nDuring the visit, he said, he met Wayne’s third wife, former Peruvian actress Pilar Pallete, as well as their children.\n\nHe asked Wayne which of his more than 175 films — of which Blackwell said he owns and has seen about 150 — was his favorite. It was the comedy Western “McLintock.”\n\nBlackwell asked Wayne how his longtime friend and frequent co-star, Maureen O’Hara, consented to the scene in that movie in which Wayne’s character accidentally knocks O’Hara’s character — long dress and all — down a long, muddy hill into a filthy puddle.\n\nWayne, he said, insisted that it was “solid makeup,” not mud (although O’Hara, in a later interview, insisted that it was bentonite, a form of clay used in drilling mud and for landfill liners. A better question might have been: What was it like for Wayne to spank her with a coal shovel in another scene?)\n\nThey talked about Jane Fonda, the anti-war activist who created a furor when she visited Hanoi in North Vietnam the previous year. Wayne, an ardent anti-communist, didn’t approve, although he reported that her father, Henry, was a fine man.\n\nAnd Blackwell admired Wayne’s World War II minesweeper-turned-yacht, Wild Goose, that was docked in the bay behind the mansion.\n\nHe remembers Wayne, not surprisingly, as a big man. “He was 6-4, 280 pounds,” he said. “His hand went all the way around mine.” In the driveway, Wayne had a Pontiac station wagon with a roof that had been custom-raised so he could sit comfortably in it with his hat on.\n\n“I went there four times in three years,” Blackwell said. “He said, ‘Anytime you want to come over when I’m home,’ ” do so.\n\n“He was extremely nice, to me anyway,” he said.\n\n“He liked policemen and he liked Marines” — and to be sure, Wayne played a Marine — in more than one film, — including “Flying Leathernecks” when Blackwell was about 10.\n\nSo it was probably a pleasure for Duke to hear him say: “You’re the reason I joined the Marine Corps.”\n\nWhen Blackwell got back to Camp Pendleton that night, his fellow Marines asked where he had been all day.\n\n“John Wayne’s house,” he replied.\n\nNaturally, they were skeptical. But when he responded with a challenge: “I’ll bet you (your) $1 to (my) $100 that I got a picture of him,” they backed down.\n\nToday, that color photograph (taken by Wayne’s adult son, Patrick, who appeared in nine movies with his father) has faded a bit, but still clearly shows John Wayne resting his left hand on the dark-eyed young Marine’s right shoulder.\n\n“That’s him,” Henderson County Sheriff Ed Brady, a former chief of police here, when shown the picture of Blackwell with Wayne.\n\nOther stars\n\n“I’ve seen a lot of movie stars,” but Blackwell said thinks more highly of Wayne than any of the rest.\n\nHe laid eyes on Clint Eastwood at a town board meeting in Carmel, Calif., though he didn’t speak with him.\n\nHe met Gary Burghoff, who played “Radar” O’Reilly in both the movie “MASH” and the TV series “M*A*S*H,” but found him to be a jerk.\n\nAnd while moonlighting as security for the production company during the filming of some scenes for the women’s baseball drama “A League of Their Own,” he met stars Tom Hanks, Gina Davis and Rosie O’Donnell as well as director Penny Marshall and found them all to “nice.” But don’t get him started on his encounters with Madonna, including her insisting that he instruct some neighbors sitting in their yard on Main Street to stop watching her. (He refused.)\n\nLooking back, Blackwell marvels at having a few hours with Wayne, primarily during that first visit.\n\n“I was nervous” approaching the front door that first time, he said.\n\n“I’m surprised like hell he would even see me,” Blackwell said. “He was a big man — probably the biggest in Hollywood.”\n\nDuring one of his last visits, he was stunned to see a bald Duke. When Blackwell mentioned the fine head of hair he had just a couple of years earlier, the actor explained that was “a wig” and that he had been bald for years.\n\n“I said, ‘It sure looked natural.’ And he said, ‘It ought to look natural — I paid $4,000 for it!’”\n\nAs for Blackwell’s own fame in Henderson, that’s easy for him to pinpoint: “Writing tickets” for speeders, especially near the Second Street overpass.\n\n“I was on a state and federal traffic grant” to work full-time enforcing traffic laws, Blackwell said.\n\n“The last three years I wrote 10,301 tickets,” he said. And he could have written even more.\n\n“If you were 65 and older and on Social Security, you didn’t get a ticket,” Blackwell said. “... I was an older cop and I realized it was tough for older people” to get by on a fixed income.\n\nWhen he pulled over a speeding senior, he told them: “I’ll let you go today. If I catch you tomorrow, you get two tickets ...\n\n“And when I’d catch teenagers, I would not give them a ticket. I’d call their parents. I had one kid tell me later, ‘Next time, just give me a ticket — my dad took my license away for two weeks!’”"
