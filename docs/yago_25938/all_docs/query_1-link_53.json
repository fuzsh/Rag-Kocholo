In 1953, Pallete came to Los Angeles to dub a film in English, when she ran into John Wayne for the second time.\n\nIn 1965, they moved to Newport Beach, California.\n\nShe rented a studio inside the Fernleaf Courtyard, in Corona Delegate March, California, where she would entertain her clients outdoors with coffee and finger sandwiches and found herself, one year later, with a full-time restaurant. Pallete has created among other works of art, a collection of still nature and beautiful ladies, belly dancers called \"Glamour Girls\", and group images from the Hollywood world.\n\nIn 1973, she and Wayne separated, and he died of stomach cancer on June 11, 1979. They were later divorced.\n\nIn 1998, Pallete married Jesse Upchurch, a travel company executive."
