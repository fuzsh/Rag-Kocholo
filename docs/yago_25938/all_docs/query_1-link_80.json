John remains a celebrated actor today, being inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers of the Nation Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in 1972.\n\nJohn Wayne\n\nBorn Marion Robert Morrison on May 26, 1907, the star became one of the biggest names during the Golden Age of Hollywood. Nicknamed 'The Duke' or 'Duke Wayne', John received his breakout role in John Ford's 1939 movie, Stagecoach. He starred in many successful films once his career took off, cementing himself as one of the most prominent actors of the time.\n\nWho was John Wayne's wife?\n\nJohn Wayne’s wives were Josephine Wayne, Esperanza Baur, and Pilar Palette. The actor and Josephine Wayne got married in 1933 and remained married until 1945. John was accused of having 'extramarital misadventures' with his Seven Sinners co-star Marlene Dietrich, which is believed to be the catalyst for their marriage's demise.\n\nJohn married Mexican actress Esperanza Baur in 1946, and the former couple divorced in 1954. John described their marriage as: 'shaking two volatile chemicals in a jar', with accusations from Esperanza of infidelity that led to counter-charges of unfaithfulness and violence.\n\nPilar Palette and John married in 1954, but issues plagued their marriage. The couple separated officially in 1973, and John 'dived deeper into work' before passing away from stomach cancer on June 11, 1979.\n\nHow long were John Wayne and Josephine married?\n\nThe former couple were married from 1933 to 1945. This marked 12 years of marriage, his second-longest marriage next to his one with Pilar.\n\nHow many children did John Wayne have with Josephine?\n\nJohn went on to have seven children. John Wayne’s children, whom he shares with his late former wife Josephine, include Mary Antonia Wayne LaCava, Melinda Wayne Munoz, Michael Wayne, and Patrick Wayne.\n\nJosephine Wayne’s children with John are the only ones she had. He had three more children with Pilar Palette: Ethan, Aissa, and Marisa.\n\nHow much is John Wayne's net worth?\n\nAccording to The New York Times, the actor left behind an estate valued at $6.85 million when he passed on, and none of it went to his third wife, Pilar. He and Pilar were separated in 1973 and remained separated when he passed on June 11, 1979. Josephine Wayne’s net worth remained unknown when she died.\n\nJosephine Wayne\n\nJosephine Wayne's name is commonly associated with one of the film's most widely recognised figures, John Wayne. Yet, considerably less is known about her life.\n\nHow old is Josephine Wayne?\n\nBorn on May 13, 1908, Josephine Wayne’s age was 95 at the time of her death on June 24, 2003.\n\nJosephine Wayne’s nationality\n\nJosephine was born and bred in Los Angeles, California, USA. This makes her an American national.\n\nJosephine Wayne’s ethnicity\n\nThe reclusive figure allegedly has a Spanish-American background. Her parents were reported to have Spanish ethnicity.\n\nJosephine Wayne’s spouse\n\nJosephine was married twice. Her first husband was Marion Robert Morrison, better known by his professional moniker, John Wayne. The couple wed in 1933, but it was not meant to last, and they got divorced in 1945.\n\nShe then met Cyril Nigg, whom she married in 1996. The couple got divorced in 1999, and it is not believed that she went on to remarry before her passing.\n\nJosephine Wayne’s cause of death\n\nJosephine Wayne died on June 24, 2003, in California, USA. She passed away from cancer, which she had been battling for some time.\n\nJosephine Wayne's life remains shrouded in mystery at times, with little known of her life following her divorce from John. She seemed content with living outside the public eye, separate from her highly-publicised former marriage.\n\nREAD ALSO: Ricky Schroder's children and wife: all about the actor's family\n\nBriefly.co.za wrote an article about American actor and filmmaker Ricky Schroder.
