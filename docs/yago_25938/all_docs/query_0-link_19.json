        "text": "SANTA ANA, Calif., June 20 (AP) —John Wayne left an estate worth $6.85 million, but none of it will be going to his third wife, Pilar, from whom the actor separated in 1973, according to a will filed yesterday.\n\nJohn S. Warren, Mr.. Wayne's lawyer, filed the 27‐page document in Orange County Superior Court. It says the actor's estate includes $1 million in real property, $5.75 million in personal property and $100,000 in income from his holdings.\n\nMr. Warren noted that although Pilar Wayne was not included in the actor's will, she was provided for In the separation agreement.\n\nMr. Wayne left $10,000 to Mary St. John, who was his secretary for many years, and $30,000 to Pat Stacy, his secretary at his death.\n\nProvision for Children\n\nThe actor left to each of his seven children the sum of $5,000 multiplied by the difference between age 21 and the child's age at Mr. Wayne's death. Under those terms, the eldest son, Michael, who is 44 years old, would receive $115,000.\n\nAll of Mr. Wayne's art objects paintings, sculptures and American Indian artifacts — will go to organizations that can provide his estate with tax deductions.\n\nThe remainder of Mr. Wayne's estate will be placed into trust accounts, one of which is to provide his first wife, Josephine, with monthly checks for $3,000. Upon her death, those funds will then be divided by the four children he had by her.\n\nHis second wife, Esperanza, died in the mid‐1950's\n\nMajor Land Holdings\n\nMr. Warren said Mr. Wayne's ranch in Arizona was included in the personal property because he owned it through stock in a corporation. Lewis Johnson, Wayne's ranch partner, is also a trustee of the estate.\n\nMr. Wayne's other major land holdings include his home on Newport Harbor and property on Puget Sound in Washington.\n\nHe also owned preferred stock in his movie production company, Batjac Productions Inc. Through his will, Mr. Wayne gave his holdings in the company to Michael, who has been a top official in Batjac for many years.\n\nMichael is the third named administrator of the estate, in addition to Mr. Warren and Mr. Johnson.\n\nSon-in-Law Is Excluded\n\nIn addition to Pilar, there was one other person excluded from the will, Mr. Warren said. Donald La Cava, the husband of Mr. Wayne's eldest daughter, Tony, will not get anything from the estate, and cannot collect his wife's portion upon her death.\n\nMr. Warren declined to say why Mr. Wayne specifically made this exclusion.\n\nA probate hearing has been scheduled for July 10, Mr. Warren said."
