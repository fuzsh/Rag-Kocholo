        "text": "John Wayne was married three times, and two of his marriages ended with divorce. All of John's wives were of Hispanic descent: Josephine Alicia Saenz, Esperanza Baur, and Pilar Pallete. Wayne's split with Esperanza Baur was the stormiest one: While under the influence of alcohol, Esperanza even attempted to shoot Wayne, as she was sure her husband had an affair with his co-star Gail Russell.\n\nJohn Wayne had four children with his first wife Josephine and three children with Pilar. Some of them entered the film industry, following their father's footsteps."
