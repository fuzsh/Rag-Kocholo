        "text": "Taking on a war drama, Wayne gave a strong performance in ‘Sands of Iwo Jima’ (1949), which garnered him his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. He also appeared in more two westerns by Ford now considered classics: ‘She Wore a Yellow Ribbon’ (1949) and ‘Rio Grande’ (1950) with Maureen O’Hara.\n\nWayne worked with O’Hara on several films, perhaps most notably ‘The Quiet Man’ (1952). Playing an American boxer with a bad reputation, his character moved to Ireland where he fell in love with a local woman (Maureen O’Hara). This film is considered Wayne’s most convincing leading romantic role by many critics.\n\nA well-known conservative and anticommunist, Wayne merged his personal beliefs and his professional life in 1952’s ‘Big Jim McLain’. He played an investigator working for the U.S. House Un-American Activities Committee, which worked to root out communists in all aspects of public life. Off screen, Wayne played a leading role in the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals and even served as its president for a time. The organization was a group of conservatives who wanted to stop communists from working in the film industry, and other members included Gary Cooper and Ronald Reagan.\n\nIn 1956, Wayne starred in another Ford western, ‘The Searchers’, and again showed some dramatic range as the morally questionable Civil War veteran Ethan Edwards. He soon after reteamed with Howard Hawks for ‘Rio Bravo’ (1959). Playing a local sheriff, Wayne’s character must face off against a powerful rancher and his henchmen who want to free his jailed brother. The unusual cast included Dean Martin and Angie Dickinson.\n\nWayne made his directorial debut with ‘The Alamo’ (1960). Starring in the film as Davy Crockett, he received decidedly mixed reviews for both his on- and off-screen efforts. Wayne received a much warmer reception for ‘The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance’ (1962) with Jimmy Stewart and Lee Marvin and directed by John Ford. Some other notable films from this period include ‘The Longest Day’ (1962) and ‘How the West Was Won’ (1962). Continuing to work steadily, Wayne refused to even let illness slow him down. He successfully battled lung cancer in 1964. To defeat the disease, Wayne had to have a lung and several ribs removed.\n\nIn the later part of the 60’s, Wayne had some great successes and failures. He co-starred with Robert Mitchum in ‘El Dorado’ (1967), which was well received. The next year, Wayne again mixed the professional and the political with the pro-Vietnam War film ‘The Green Berets’ (1968). He directed and produced as well as starred in the film, which was derided by critics for being heavy handed and clichéd. Viewed by many as a piece of propaganda, the film still did well at the box office.\n\nAround this time, Wayne continued to espouse his conservative political views. He support friend Ronald Reagan in his 1966 bid for governor of California as well as his 1970 re-election effort. In 1976, Wayne recorded radio advertisements for Reagan’s first attempt to become the Republican presidential candidate.\n\nWayne won his first Academy Award for Best Actor for ‘True Grit’ (1969). He played Rooster Cogburn, an eye-patching drunkard and lawman, who helps a young woman named Mattie (Kim Darby) track down her father’s killer. A young Glen Campbell joined the pair on their mission. Rounding out the cast, Robert Duvall and Dennis Hopper were among the bad guys the trio had to defeat. A later sequel with Katherine Hepburn, ‘Rooster Cogburn’ (1975), failed to attract critical acclaim or much of an audience.\n\nWayne portrayed an aging gunfighter dying of cancer in his final film, ‘The Shootist’ (1976), with Jimmy Stewart and Lauren Bacall. His character, John Bernard Books, hoped to spend his final days peacefully, but got involved one last gunfight. In 1978, life imitated art with Wayne being diagnosed with stomach cancer.\n\nWayne died on June 11 1979, in Los Angeles, California. He was survived by his seven children from two of his three marriages. During his marriage to Josephine Saenz from 1933 to 1945, the couple had four children, two daughters Antonia and Melinda and two sons Michael and Patrick. Both Michael and Patrick followed in their father’s footsteps Michael as a producer and Patrick as an actor. With his third wife, Pilar Palette, he had three more children, Ethan, Aissa, and Marisa. Ethan has worked as an actor over the years.\n\nShortly before his death, the U.S. Congress approved a congressional gold medal for Wayne. It was given to his family in 1980. In the same month as the Duke’s passing, the Orange County Airport was renamed after him. He was later featured on a postage stamp in 1990 and again in 2004 and was inducted into the California Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\nIn honor of his charitable work in the fight against cancer, Wayne’s children established the John Wayne Cancer Foundation in 1985. The organization provides support to numerous cancer-related programs and to the John Wayne Cancer Institute at Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, California.\n\nSource: Biography"
