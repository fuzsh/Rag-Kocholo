        "text": "John Wayne was born Marion Robert Morrison in 1907. He transcended his Iowa roots to become an American acting legend and the embodiment of Western masculinity.\n\nHis career, spanning over five decades and exceeding 170 films, cemented his place as a cinematic icon and influential figure.\n\nWhile athletic prowess secured Wayne a football scholarship to the University of Southern California, a bodysurfing injury dashed his dreams of professional play.\n\nHe transitioned to Hollywood, starting as a prop boy at Fox Film Corporation. His striking looks and rugged demeanor caught the eye of director John Ford, who gave him his first credited role in 1928’s “The Big Trail.”\n\nWayne’s breakout moment arrived in Ford’s 1939 Western “Stagecoach.” His portrayal of Ringo Starr, a morally ambiguous outlaw with a hero’s heart, established his enduring persona: the stoic cowboy navigating conflict and upholding a code of honor. This persona would be refined and reinterpreted throughout his career, captivating audiences for decades.\n\nWayne reigned supreme in Westerns, with classics like “Red River” (1948), “The Searchers” (1956), and “True Grit” (1969) showcasing his range and depth. He often portrayed flawed heroes, grappling with internal struggles and societal pressures while embodying American grit and self-reliance.\n\nBeyond Westerns, Wayne excelled in war films, portraying soldiers with unwavering patriotism and courage. Films like “The Sands of Iwo Jima” (1949) and “The Longest Day” (1962) solidified his image as a national hero, embodying American resilience and fighting spirit.\n\nHe passed away from stomach cancer in 1979.\n\nFamily Overview\n\nJohn Wayne came from Irish descent on both sides of his family.\n\nHis father’s side migrated to the United States of America in the 19th century when Robert Morrison crossed the Atlantic Ocean from Ireland. Once they arrived they moved west and settled in Ohio. His father’s family stayed in the Midwest until eventually moving to California.\n\nOn his mother’s side, his grandmother had migrated from Ireland but his grandfather had deep roots in the United States.\n\nHis mother’s surname was Brown and the Brown family had resided in the United States before the American Revolutionary War had taken place. They migrated from England during the Great Puritan Migration in the early 17th century. They settled in New England where he had ancestors that lived in Massachusetts Bay Colony and Connecticut Colony.\n\nJohn Wayne married three times and had seven children. Many of his children ventured into the movie industry while some kept to themselves.\n\nFamily Tree Chart\n\nParents:\n\nClyde Leonard Morrison (1884 – 1937) – He was a well-liked but unsuccessful pharmacist in Iowa, known for his generosity and good nature. To find a better climate for his asthma and better fortune for family finances, in 1914 he moved his family to Palmdale, California to homestead 80 acres owned by his father. The land turned out to be arid and unsuitable for farming, so two years later in 1916, they relocated to Glendale outside of Hollywood. He and his wife had three children.\n\nMary Alberta Brown (1885 – 1970) – She was the mother of two boys which included the man that became known as John Wayne. She was the daughter of Robert Emmet Brown and Margaret Moran. Both of her parents had Irish ancestors.\n\nSpouse:\n\nJosephine Alicia Saenz (1908 – 2003) – She was age 15 or 16 when she met John Wayne, an actor in college still named Marion Morrison, while at a beach party in Balboa, California. Their relationship met with considerable resistance from her Catholic family because he was a Presbyterian. After courting for seven years, Wayne’s financial status improved considerably due to his success at the box office, and he was able to convince her family to allow the marriage. The couple married on June 24, 1933, in a garden ceremony at actress Loretta Young’s home. They would have four children together but their marriage would not last. They divorced in 1945. She would live a long life and outlive John Wayne and some of her children.\n\nEsperanza Baur Diaz (1921 – 1961) – She was an actress and the second wife of John Wayne. Esperanza and John were married on January 17, 1946, in Long Beach, California. They separated in May 1952 and divorced on November 1, 1954. She passed away at the age of 40 from a heart attack. The couple did not have any children.\n\nPilar Pallete (1928 – living) – She was the third wife of John Wayne and would be his wife until his passing. The couple had three children together. She married again after her first husband.\n\nChildren:\n\n*There are four children of John Wayne still living. They are public figures but since they have not passed away I do not want to display their information.\n\nMichael Wayne (1934 – 2003) – He was the oldest son of John Wayne and his first wife. He directed many of his father’s films. In his personal life, he was a father and grandfather.\n\nMary Antonia Wayne (1936 – 2000) – She was born Mary Antonia Morrison in Los Angeles, California, she was the daughter of soon-to-be famous actor John Wayne and his first wife, Josephine Alicia Sáenz. Growing up in an acting family, she first appeared in “The Quiet Man” (1952) with her father, in an uncredited cameo appearance as a young teenage girl at the races, along with her brother and sister. She also appeared in an uncredited cameo role in her father’s film, “The Alamo” (1960). In 1956, she married Donald La Cava, with whom she would have eight children. She remained a mother and housewife. Very little is known about her as she lived most of her life as a private person.\n\nMelinda Ann Wayne (1940 – 2022) – She was the youngest child of John Wayne. She married and stayed out of the spotlight. She passed away in 2022.\n\nSiblings:\n\nRobert Emmett Morrison (1911 – 1970) – He and his family moved to Lancaster, California around 1914 where his parents tried their hand at farming. After trying to farm for two years the family moved to Glendale California where Robert and his brother Marion attended school. After graduating high school Robert was briefly employed as a lifeguard and then worked in the movie industry a job he landed after big brother Marion had become famous as the actor John Wayne. He married twice."
