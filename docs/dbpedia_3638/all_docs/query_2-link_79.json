        "text": "The Life and Times of Frances Bard, the Duchess of Cumberland\n\nRedux version of first 2.5 chapters\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe love story that saved the House of Stuarts\n\nFrances Bard, the Duchess of Cumberland since 1664, Electress of Palatinate since 1685 (1644-1708)\n\nPOD: In 1664, Prince Rupert of the Rhine, Duke of Cumberland and Earl of Holderness, enters the chambers of king Charles II with an unusual request – request to permit Rupert’s marriage with Lady Frances Bard, the youngest (and soon only) daughter of late Sir Henry Bard, 1st Viscount Bellomont.\n\nThe marriage was pretty scandalous since the bride was a daughter of Irish catholic, not to mention a daughter of mere Viscount. However, there was a precedent of an English prince of blood marrying a commoner – James, Duke of York married Anne Hyde, and thus Charles II has no legal way to discourage his cousin from marrying a commoner, since he had not discouraged his brother from doing the same thing.\n\nAs a wedding present Rupert gets the positions of Constable of Windsor Castle and the Ranger of the Great Park. The Byfield House coming with the second position becomes known as the Cumberland Lodge from now on, since it’s now an official countryside residence of the Duke and Duchess of Cumberland [1]\n\nCumberland Lodge view\n\nThe relations with Charles-Louis, Rupert’s elder brother and Elector Palatine, became rather strained due to this marriage, which is morganatic by Palatinate standards. However Charles-Louis, with his bigamous family life and the whole mess with Raugravine Marie Luise von Degenfeld is not the person to lecture his brother on marriage matters and quickly realizes this. So he merely congratulates Rupert on marriage, though warning him that Rupert’s children from such a marriage may not be able to inherit Palatinate.\n\nAt first English court thought that the Duke of Cumberland’s marriage was based on the same thing as Duke of York marriage – i.e. bride’s unexpected pregnancy. If so, they were deeply disappointed that the firstborn of Duke and Duchess of Cumberland was born only in January 1666 – a healthy baby boy named Dudley Rupert of Palatinate-Simmern , known since birth by courtesy title Earl of Holderness.\n\nDespite his mother being a Catholic, Rupert saw that his son was christened in Anglican Faith. The godfather of infant Earl of Holderness was just slightly less infant James Stuart, Duke of Cambridge. The godmother by proxy was Henriette-Anne, Duchess of Orleans, who Rupert courted for some time in 1659 before her departure to France.\n\nJames, Duke of Cambridge, wearing the regalia of Order of Garter\n\nAs a “reverse courtesy”, Rupert also was a godfather of Charles Stuart, Duke of Kendall, the second son of James of York [2].\n\nBoth young fathers, however, were soon deprived from the family pleasures and recalled to the battlefront. With two married family relations of his, one with heir and second with heir and a spare, Charles decided to allow both join the navy and participate in the Four Day Battle and St. James’ Day Battle [3] which ended in the total victory for British fleet.\n\nThe epidemics of bubonic plague in 1666-1667 was, however, a deep strike for the British royal family. Rupert and James were both recalled to accompany the King in London. Rupert, genuinely scared for well-being of his family, told pregnant Frances with infant Dudley to stay in Windsor and not in the plague-filled city. Frances asked the Duke of York for permission to send his older son, James, with them “so that young Dudley will have a playmate”. Despite King being adamant that the whole Royal Family stays in London during disaster days, he’s not a sadist and weeping beautiful women touch somewhat of a soft spot in his heart.\n\nThe Duke of Cambridge remains with the Duchess of Cumberland and young Earl of Holderness till the end of epidemics. The “miracle of House of Stuart” becomes even more evident when Rupert’s godson Charles of Kendall dies in May 1667 [4]. The Duchess of Cumberland will later be regarded by the English historians in the same way as the governess of Louis XV for saving main line of House of Bourbon from extinction. Ironically, a protestant line of Stuarts was saved by a Catholic Duchess of Cumberland.\n\nHowever, the Royal Family soon welcomes two new additions – Edgar, Duke of Kendall (“the second Duke of Kendall” or “the spare Duke” as the infant is called informally, to distinguish him from the late Charles of Kendall) born in September 1667 and Ruperta-Elisabeth of Cumberland, a second child of Rupert and Frances, born on December 16, 1667 – “a birthday present” for Rupert, as he jokes. The same year young Dudley Holderness receives his first “real” non-courtesy title as his uncle, 2nd Viscount, dies fighting the French at St. Kits. The title is recreated in Peerage of Ireland upgraded to the Earl of Bellomont. So the courtesy title of Earl of Holderness is pushed aside by the real” title of 1st Earl of Bellomont, as young Dudley Rupert of Palatinate-Simmern is now known at court.\n\nA military life for Rupert and James of York is however not all rosy and nice as the Second English-Dutch war ends in rather ugly stalemate following the Raid of Medway. That forced the signing of the Treaty of Breda ending the war as in OTL. Ironically, the victory of Dutch was Pyrric and it lead to the downfall of de Witt regime later on, as Treaty of Breda managed to piss off both Charles II and Louis XIV.\n\nIn 1670 Henriette, the Duchess of Orleans, dies of gastric ulcer perforation with frequent rumors about her being poisoned circulating in both French and English courts. Dudley Rupert of Palatinate-Simmern is now old enough to understand the death of his godmother which he mourns deeply. The same year, however, the Cumberland family welcomes new addition – a boy named Maurice in honor of Rupert’s late brother, healthy and “too damn loud” by his father’s account.\n\nIn 1671 the Duchess of York dies of cancer, two of her children – 3-years old Edgar of Kendall and 8-months old Catherine of York following her to the grave the same year. James of York is left with three surviving children – Mary, born in 1662, James, Duke of Cambridge, born in 1663 (for whom his father and uncle already began to search a suitable bride), and Anne, born in 1665. Unlike OTL, having a surviving healthy son puts him under no pressure to marry a fertile woman urgently, much less marry a niece of scandalous Duchess of Mazaren, so he discards this marriage idea (not to mention Mary of Modena is closer in age to James of Cambridge, for whom she’s also considered as a possible bride).\n\nIn the circle of his friends James jokes about marrying Anne, Duchess of Montpensier, “the smallpox-scarred hag” (though the Duke is no paragon of beauty at the moment) who is right now too busy weaseling out of marrying Philippe of Orleans and attempting to marry Lauzin. Ironically, both Charles II and Louis XIV find the joke funny enough to try it, or so it seems – Anne gets into real bad quarrel with the rest of Royal Family about Lauzin and is proposed a “loophole” with marriage to the Duke of York – a heir presumptive to the English throne is a good thing. However, the true aim is the way of strengthening the Treaty of Dover which was signed in 1670, by both tying the English and French royal family into the dynastic union and providing “a leg to stand” for the terms of Treaty of Dover, making Royal Family more independent from the Parliament.\n\nAnne de Montpensier, the Grand Mademoiselle, the second wife of the Duke of York since 1672\n\nIn 1672 at the start of Third English-Dutch War Anne de Montpensier reluctantly becomes a Duchess of York, Albany and Normandy. This marriage will allow her to become a Queen – considering Catherine of Braganza is barren and considering Duke of York outlives his brother, which is possible. As part of marriage contract she sells almost all her titles to the Crown in exchange to an enormous sum of 10 million livres (5 million as a lump sum and another 5 in the following 10 years) and annual pension payments from French crown to her and her husband. She is, however, allowed to keep the title of Duchesse de Montpensier and Sovereign Princess of Dombes, as well as County of Eu (being technically subsidiary title to Duchy of Normandy nominally held by her husband since 1660. Provided she fails to have heirs with Duke of York, all her titles, bar ones belonging to the Duchy of Normandy territory, so the worst case loss for the French crown is County of Eu (though Louis is sure that Eu, like Aubigny, another French fief belonging to Stuarts, can be managed one way or another). Dombes and Eu are among the most profitable properties of Anne, so she’s rather content with have both left to her.\n\nThe marriage is viewed as exile and even as practical joke pulled by two kings on their unfortunate relatives (though the best way to strengthen (legally) the Treaty of Dover, or at least its overt anti-Dutch part, is a dynastic marriage, and the only legible French princesses of Royal blood minus the greatest heiress of Europe are either a toddler (Madame Royale) or nieces to James of York (and Stuarts are no Habsburgs)). The Cavalier Parliament does not see any danger to Protestant succession in almost 45-years old princess, and thus never gets suspended unlike OTL. Lauzin, who served under the Duke of York in Flanders, follows his not-to-be wife to England to start one of the craziest love triangles (or quadrants?) of era. Considering that Lauzin was “the ugliest sex god ever”, and the official mistress of James of York, Arabella Churchill, was also rather plain woman, the family matters of the Yorks were worth a good comedy – the marriage was purely a business deal between two families (providing the independent from Parliament source of financing for English participation in anti-Dutch operation), and both Duke and Duchess of York kept “somebody on side”. It was this period when James FitzJames, the first Duke of Berwick was born, arguably the most well-known by-product of such strange family life.\n\nJokes and polyamory aside, the marriage to the Grande Mademoiselle now gives her two stepdaughters access to the large dowry, and Charles and James have found a suitable bride for James of Cambridge – Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark [5]. The Danes proved to be allies in the Second English-Dutch war (despite plunder in Bergen ending up as a failure) and the French court had nothing against this marriage serving to keep the Dutch at bay (no pun intended). James and Ulrika Eleonora were to be married in 1678 when the groom is 15 years old, the betrothal being held in 1673 (thus the English court beats Sweden to it). This marriage ensured the continuation of the Protestant line of Stuarts.\n\nUlrika Eleonora of Denmark and Norway, Duchess of Cambridge since 1678, Princess of Wales since 1685\n\nIn 1674 Louis-Henry of Simmern-Kaiserslautern dies, and von Simmern secundogeniture title, Duke of Simmern-Kaiserslautern , becomes vacant. Charles-Louis writes to Rupert, offering him to return and to pay the Imperial tax which will allow his marriage with Frances Bard to be recognized as legal in Holy Roman Empire. Rupert agrees to pay the tax from the incomes of Simmern-Kaiserslautern Duchy, but disagrees to return. Due to barren wife and legion of mistresses of Charles II and strange comedy of the second marriage of the Duke of York at least one prince of blood has to stay in England to give the example of a happily married man – that to be Rupert. However, Rupert agrees to send his second son, Maurice, to his uncle to be taught Palatinate laws and customs and serve as “spare presumptive”. Dudley stays in England with his mother (at this point Rupert still hopes that Wilhelmine Ernestine of Denmark carries a child to term, so he won’t have to return to dull Heidelberg, however he’s happy with Maurice getting a secundogeniture, since he doesn’t want his second son to end up like him – with long, prestigious, but empty title, and having a real thing in form of Imperial principality, even as tiny as Kaiserslautern, will be definitely good for the boy).\n\nCharles-Louis' daughter, Liselotte, as OTL, married Philippe of Orleans, thus creating the intricate network of marriage alliances between France, England, Palatinate and Denmark.\n\nWhat of Mary of Modena in TTL? In 1676 the 18 years-old Mary was married to the 15-years old Charles the Bewitched, as Mary’s mother planned. Those plans were assisted by Don Juan Jose of Austria , ambitious illegitimate half brother of young king, who saw in that pragmatic daughter of upstart Italian an opportunity in both seizing power from Dowager Queen-Regent Marianna, and a vital instrument for saving the glory of Spain as he sees it… the role which a princess of…well, bluer blood won’t be able to fulfill. The marriage with a girl of minor principality (D’Estes are ancient family, one of the most ancient ones in Europe, but their blue blood is quite diluted at this point) makes Louis XIV to move the Prime Minister of Spain quite up in his hate list for ruining the marriage plans for his daughter, Marie Therese of France, Madame Royale [6]. Juan Jose however is not going to sit around and wait for sickly inbred child to grow up and marry sickly inbred man – Spain needs an heir as soon as possible and for any price.\n\n[FONT=&quot]Notes:[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot][1] OTL it also became known as the Cumberland Lodge, but in honor of another Duke of Cumberland – son of George II of Hannover.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot][2] In OTL, the godfather of Charles Stuart was his elder brother James Stuart, Duke of Cambridge[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot][3] In OTL the Duke of York was recalled from the fleet after the Battle of Lowestoft and replaced by Rupert as the senior commander of the fleet, but here, when Rupert is also married and with a son, Charles decides that allowing them both take the risk would be more fair and favorable for English case, than either sending them both away or sending only Rupert to the front[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot][4] In OTL both Charles and James died in the epidemics outbreak[/FONT]\n\n[5][FONT=&quot] Yes, THAT Ulrika Eleonora, OTL mother of Charles XII of Sweden[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot][6] In that TL she gets slightly better genes and does not die of convulsions on March 1, 1672.

[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Chapter 2\n\nOn children of warming pans, generous stepmoms and how possible in-laws are sometimes scarier than Papists (if those in-laws are Dowager Queen of Sweden)[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\n“It began with Juana…it ends with Juana.” Marianna Habsburg, Dowager Queen of Spain[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The Queen of Spain is always a slave to etiquette. The list of persons allowed to touch her is incredibly small. However, as Don Juan Jose, who praised himself of being a pragmatic, put it, “if a King can’t touch his Queen, then somebody needs to do that, damn it!”. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]A mentally retarded young man with deformed testicles (“four of them and none working”) was never seriously regarded as somebody capable of having heirs, and no amounts of holy water and sacred oils could correct it…except for some special “sacred oils”. Don Juan has gained the friendship of young queen since she came to Madrid (being the driving force behind the marriage, actually), and soon explained to her the plan. They did not need to become full-fledged lovers – they only need one night stand with Don Juan serving as a king stand in. That won’t be even a cheat, as a father of the child is still a Habsburg and a brother of the king, and adultery with royal brothers is nothing new for Iberian Peninsula – the most recent example given by Portuguese royal family. Unlike Duke of Beja, however, Don Juan of Austria was illegitimate and cannot straightforwardly usurp his disabled brother’s throne along with his wife. Serving as the surrogate father for continuation of Habsburg line, while king is still young enough and the marriage is new enough for the sudden child of disabled king not to be suspicious, however, was another thing.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nDon Juan Jose of Austria\n\nMary of Modena\n\nCharles the Bewitched\n\nThe “surrogate parenthood” deal happens in 1679, when Juan of Austria manages to install himself as the Prime Minister. With some clever tricks, wine laced with a sleeping potion (miniscule quantity of opiates taken from court doctor) and the bedsheet “painted” with menstrual blood of a chambermaid Mary of Modena easily convinces the king that the child was sired by him. Juan of Austria, however, was not too fortunate to see his child live – he died the same year, most likely killed by poison.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]At the time Mary of Modena gave birth at the Royal Alcazar of Madrid to a healthy girl on January 6, 1680, the Queen Mother has returned to power. She most likely knew that the girl was technically a bastard, but since her father was still a Habsburg and a son of Philip IV, that was a more suitable thing that siring a daughter with random servant or courtier.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The girl was christened Maria Juana of Spain. The Infanta, quite obviously to be the last of Spanish Habsburgs, was to be the most eligible bride of the late 1690ies – early 1700ies. She was quickly nicknamed at the Spanish court “La Nueva Beltraneja” in honor of another Spanish princess of equally dubious parentage. But born out of wedlock or not, young Maria Juana was still a princess of Habsburg blood even by her biological father. The girl soon proves to be beautiful, with ravenous dark hair and striking black eyes, inherited both from her mother and her biological father. Her official father, the king, is kept ignorant of the adultery committed by Mary of Modena, and adores the little girl, naming her “my angel”.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]***[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Despite referring as “Comedic” by some, the life of Duke of York went better that one can expect (probably due to “live and let live” attitude between spouses – James tolerated Lauzin, and Anne tolerated Arabella). In 1673 there was even a report of pregnancy of the second Duchess, however it turned out to be unlikely (Anne was 46 by then).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In fact, Duchess of Montpensier did her best to serve as a good stepmother for children of James of York. Though childless, she had a ton of experience with her younger sisters (age difference being large enough so those can pass as her children). Anne adored her “new mum” who wasted no time spoiling the girls with luxurious jewelry and dresses, older children – Mary and James – were more wary of “Papist stepmom”, however they gradually warmed up to her, especially since Anne d’Orleans did not give a damn about religious upbringing of children. Also, not being too eager to convert them was one of the best ways to piss off her cousin, the Sun King. Anne was married to strengthen the Treaty of Dover (and her dowry was used to “launder” money received under the treaty, since the funds from dowry, unlike the pension from secret-but-not-so-secret treaty, could have been directed towards renovation of English fleet), however she did not come to the foreign kingdom to be mere marionette of her “dearest” cousin.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Another hobby apart from spoiling her stepdaughters rotten, undertaken by newly-married Duchess of York, was architectural renovation. While knowing she won’t be able to pass any of her French inheritance to her stepchildren, she enjoyed collecting English properties. Knowing that the Duchess of Cleveland has great issues with her gambling debts, and that as part of a King’s affection to her she was given the Nonsuch Palace which she does not know what to do with, Anne offers Barbara to sell her the palace. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nNonsuch Palace, the countryside residence of Duke of York since 1678[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The sentimental affection of Duchess of Montpensier to the Nonsuch Palace has simple reasons behind it – it was built by Henry VIII to rival Chateau de Chambord and thus reminds Anne of the Loire Valley palaces of her childhood. If she can’t bring her stepchildren to French grandeur, she can bring some of the French grandeur to her stepchildren.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]So, in 1673, while her husband is too busy at sea fighting the Dutch for the glory of Anne’s cousin and brother-in-law, the Duchess of York starts the grand renovation of “the Royal white elephant”. The renovation will be completed by 1678 and the Palace of Nonsuch has since became the favorite residence of the Yorks and saw the birth of first grandkid of the Duke of York in 1679 – a daughter of Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, christened Sophia.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Due to Duke of Cambridge being alive and well, Duke of York is allowed more active participation in the military campaign of 1672-1674. Ironically, it both improves and damages his reputation, as unlike in RT with Rupert, who plays second fiddle to James of York here, performing his duties in Admiralty, Jean d’Estrees cannot admit that he sabotages the military command of a husband of Granddaughter of France. It’s much easier to assume that he’s an incompetent idiot who failed to double check the semaphore signal.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Due to James being the senior at command at Schooneveld, Admiral D’Estrees cannot put all the blame on English side, since it would be blaming a relative of King of France both by blood and by marriage for being incompetent, and this is a big no-no at Versailles [1]. Thus D’Estrees is quietly removed from command, with Abraham Duquesne being appointed in his place (D’Estrees will somewhat recover from his disgrace in 1676 by taking Cayenne from the Dutch). Duke of York is also quietly phased out from senior commanding post on the frontlines back to Lord High Admiral chair, and Rupert of the Rhine is installed as commander instead. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The communication between Rupert and Duquesne is much better than between James of York and Jean D’Estrees, and the allied fleet manages to pull some great victories over the Dutch, one the most important being prevention of New York recapture by the Dutch[2]. However the attempt to recapture Suriname, seized to the Dutch under the treaty of Breda, fails.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Due to «the Great Money Laundering Plan » with the marriage of Duke of York, which allowed to legitimize the funds paid to the British government under the Treaty of Dover, the war is not so unpopular with Parliament and the King feels no pressing need to plead to Parliament (neither he needs . No successes of Allied fleet, however great they are, may compare to the Dutch propaganda basically spamming England with pamphlets on «Catholic fool and hag », as Duke and Duchess of York are called in those.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The money of the legalized French crown aid dragged the campaign a bit longer that OTL, ending it with separate peace in December 1674. The reason was William III, who until then managed to blame anything wrong with Dutch on Cornelius de Witt, openly allying with Leopold I of Holy Roman Empire. The way too rebellious nephew deserved spanking, but Leopold’s intervention meant that «spank the Dutch » deal turned into «just another war against Flanders » and thus was totally against English interest. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]TTL Treaty of Westminister ceded Suriname to Dutch on conditions on status quo of 1667, however, the outcome was slightly better with Britain being confirmed «herring rights » in North Sea, something they attempted to get back upon entering the war. The indemnities paid by Dutch were of the same amount as OTL – two million guldens. Until the end of the Dutch-French War Charles II will remain the mediator between two countries.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Unlike unsuccessful Duke of York, whose marriage to the French princess was thought as a cause of all this deal (the full content of the Treaty of Dover never became public TTL, however a «Pact to Aid Against the Dutch » was publicly recognized as a condition of second marriage of the Duke of York), Rupert has emerged from the war widely popular. The case of Duke of York quietly stepping down from position of Lord High Admiral in favor of Rupert was widely viewed as a case of him recognizing his cousin's growing popularity. Since the second marriage of Duke of York « brought nothing but herring to England » as a lampoon following the treaty of Westminister goes, there is a growing movement in Parliament in support of idea to marry young Earl of Bellomont to Mary or Anne Stuart, thus bringing him basically to the second or third place in the line of succession. And indeed, in 1677 the betrothal happens between Dudley and Anne Stuart. Due to Wilhelmine Ernestine of Denmark remaining barren after 7 years of marriage, the chances of Dudley Rupert of Palatinate Simmern, by courtesy Earl of Holderness, 1st Earl of Bellomont, are rising, and thus the marriage, which is to be consummated in 1682, has great chance to make Anne the Electress Palatine one day.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Mary still remains eligible bride. The marriage plan for Le Grande Dauphin failed, opposing, among others, by Mary’s stepmother, Duchess of York, who is of not very high opinion of Dauphin, though thinks he could highly benefit from the wife with brains. Two other prospective suitors, William III of Orange and Charles XI of Sweden, were already rejected – the first is because Charles won’t tolerate his nephew in the line of succession any closer than he already is, and the second is because the Duke of Cambridge is already engaged to Danish Princess and getting in between Sweden-Denmark eternal struggle is not the thing any sane ruler would wish. Also the rumors that the Swedish Queen Regent would rather die than have any other woman take precedence over her as Queen are rather persistent.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The important suitors are already taken, however. In 1678 William III quietly marries Juliana-Louise of East Frisia, a «domestic marriage» of no high advantage. After the evidence whorish behavior of proposed bride to Charles XI, Juliana of Hesse-Eschwege, the dominating mother of the king, Hedwid-Eleonore of Holstein-Gottorp, finds another ward from her reserves, her niece Marie Elisabeth of Hesse-Darmstadt [3] , whom Charles marries in 1675. And finally, the Dauphin of France marries Maria Anna of Bavaria to whom he is betrothed since the age of eight.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Marie Elisabeth of Hesse-Darmstadt, Queen of Sweden since 1675[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Regarding the issue of Catholic emancipation, Charles II chooses the most suitable moment for doing that, honoring (if only in words) this part of bargain with Louis XIV. In 1678, right after the lavish wedding of Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, he informs his “royal brother” secretly that such an act will be signed, once the Duke of Cambridge produces an heir. In 1680, when young Prince Charles of Cambridge, first grandnephew of Charles II, was born, Charles II solemnly declared the Royal Declaration of Indulgence “as a celebration of continued Stuart line of true Catholic and Apostolic Anglican Church”. With James of Cambridge having two children (Sophia of Cambridge born in 1679 and Charles of Cambridge born in 1680), both christened in Anglican Faith, the Declaration is reluctantly passed by the Parliament, with the idea that shall James of Cambridge stay true and avoid the conversion (as he did for 10 years already), they’ll have to put up with civil rights for Catholics for not too long. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]One minor butterfly resulting from departure of Anne d’Orleans in England is a new doctor of Orleans family, who is less adamant about bloodletting as a cure for everything. Thus Alexander Louis of Orleans, Duke of Valois (born in 1673), who OTL died of massive bloodletting in 1676, survives and remains one of the best marriage opinions of Europe. After the Spanish plans fiasco for Madame Royale he is considered a possible husband for her, however this plan is opposed by Alexander’s mother, who in her typical bluntly fashion informs the King that she doesn’t want her grandkids to look like Charles II of Spain, and thus the proposal is put aside for a time.[/FONT]\n\nNotes:\n\n[1][FONT=&quot] In OTL Rupert basically accused D’Estrees of sabotage, after which he was removed from command.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot][2]In OTL the Dutch briefly took back New York and captured the French Acadia.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot][3] OTL wife of Duke Henry of Saxe-Römhild[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Chapter 2.5[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\nThe Rising Star of the East\n\nIn 1676 Alexis Romanov, Tsar of Russia, dies, leaving six daughters and two sons from his first marriage to Maria Myloslavskaya, and two children from his second marriage to Natalya Kirillovna Naryshkina – Tsarevich Peter Alexeevich and Tsarevna Natalya Alexeevna.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nTsar Feodor III of Russia\n\nHis 15 years old son, Feodor, crowned as Feodor III of Russia, got excellent education. He was declared the heir in 1670 after his elder brother, Alexis, died suddenly. Both Alexis and Feodor were educated in Western manner since their father, the Tsar, hoped to see one of them as a candidate to Polish crown (Alexis was even suggested as a husband to a niece of Polish queen, Benedicta-Henriette of Palatinate-Simmern, but the plan felt through since it involved young Tsarevich converting to the Greek Catholic church and thus losing his rights to the Russian throne, or, shall the Poles be able to tolerate the king of Orthodox faith, Benedicta-Henriette converting into Orthodox Christianity for marriage to be valid in Russia – and then all of this was quickly forgotten once Alexis died) – Feodor spoke fluent Latin and Polish, and, despite being rather frail child in early years of his life (many feared that he’ll go the way of Alexis, with the remaining son of Tsar from first marriage, Ivan, being rather slow-witted boy who had problems with eyesight), became an accomplished horseman and archer (this was an accomplishment of his tutor, Prince Dolgorukov, one of the most renowned horse breeders among the Russian nobility of the era, whose hobbies highly influenced his ward’s hobbies). His rather daredevil riding habits almost cost him his life in the winter 1674, since had the servants not stopped the horse of the Tsarevich, he would have felt on the icy road under the carriage in which his sisters rode [1].[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Another hobby of young Tsar was music – he introduced Western way of musical notation into Russian culture, being an amateur composer himself. He also eschewed traditional ways of Russian dressing, wearing his hair in long locks (the Tatar custom of shaving the heads of young men was rather popular in Russia before that, but Feodor abolished that) and wearing Western (Polish-style) clothes in public.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Since Feodor was only 15, the joint government in the first year of his reign was performed by Artamon Matveev (minister of foreign affairs and a relative to Dowager Tsarina Natalya Naryshkina), Patriarch Ioakim and Tsar’s maternal cousin, Ivan Miloslavsky. However, Miloslavskiy and Matveev soon become bitter rivals and in 1677 Miloslavsky managed to have Matveev exiled, becoming the de-facto Prime Minister (however, while being the nominal head of 13 Prikazs (Departments) he was actually interested in intrigues more than in ruling).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Miloslavskiy advised Feodor to “kill the mama bear and her cubs” referring to Dowager Tsarina and her children – Peter and Natalia, worrying that the Naryshkins party headed by Dowager Tsarina (who did everything in her power to secure important posts in Russian government for her favorite brother Lev Naryshkin) will pose danger for position of his clan in Russian politics. However Feodor was angry at this proposal, since little Peter was his godson, and coldly reminded his cousin of this. He, however, agreed to “exile” Natalya Naryshkina and her kids from Moscow to the Preobrazhenskoye Palace, countryside residence of Russian Tsars. Here he frequently visited his godson, Tsarevich Peter, giving him presents such as toy guns or even miniature toy galleon with cannon that fired small cannonballs. Feodor encouraged military-bent hobbies of his little half-brother, saying that “Tsars must learn the art of war since young age”.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Due to Feodor being young, Miloslavskiy expected that he will not be experienced enough to rule, expecting young Tsar to entertain himself with music, poetry and riding while he, Ivan Miloslavsky, will take care of business of ruling the state. However, young Tsar soon proved himself far from the puppet, and soon showed the traits that later earn him the nickname “Feodor the Most Cunning” (Fyodor Khitreyshy).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1678 he performed the census of Russian population meant to regulate taxation, which was rather chaotic during the previous reign – Alexis Mikhailovich needing money to wage his decades-long wars with Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and imposing irregular taxes that caused a lot of riots. The new taxation system was somewhat stricter, yet it got rid of some obsolete taxes. He also reviewed the Code of Laws of 1649, written by his father, getting rid of some rather absurd types of corporal punishment, and increased the civil rights of widows. Feodor established the fixed term for which somebody can be held in detention awaiting trial (under previous Tsars, such detentions sometimes measured in decades).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He introduced the fixed business hours for all the departments of the Boyar Duma, regulating the number of those department and the time necessary to review the cases. The Tsar assigned The Chamber of Judgment (Raspravnaya Palata) which was to deal with the cases that Feodor felt were too dragged on by the Departments, and was presided by Feodor himself. While the reform of Duma and the departments system was to make the government more effective and centralized, it was also one of Feodor’s ways to say “f*ck you” to his cousin, who went to exile in 1680 after opposing Feodor’s marriage for love with Ukrainian noblewoman Agafia Grushetskaya, a highly educated woman (for Russian standards, however her upbringing was not unusual for Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth noblewomen – Agafia was fluent in Polish, Latin and French, and shared Feodor’s passion for music). The last strain for Tsar was Miloslavskiy trying to accuse Agafia and her family of being secret Catholics and of her and her mother being “women of inappropriate behavior”. Ivan Miloslavskiy could have considered himself lucky ending up as governor of Nizhny Novgorod after whole affair – a Tsar of less humanistic upbringing could have gone for execution.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Due to Tsar’s clothing habits, Western clothing becomes quite popular at Russian court. But the nobles still had to wear traditional clothing at formal court events, while wearing Western clothes in informal situations. So the reform that banned the traditional clothing from Russian court, making all the courtiers to wear Polish-style clothing at court, was highly pragmatic – the nobility would have to spend less on fancy clothing now that they don’t have to change between two sets. He also abolished the shameful custom to have soldiers that ran away from the battlefield wear female clothing as a sign of their cowardice. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Feodor’s wife, Agafia Grushetskaya, was the first Russian Tsarina to openly show with his husband in public, and the first to wear Polish headgear (revealing hair) and European-style dresses in public. Feodor’s sisters, as well as other ladies of the court, soon followed suit.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Feodor introduced new ways of entertainment to the court – him and his wife being present at concerts. However, court theater, flourishing in later years of the reign of Alexis Mikhailovich, was abandoned due to Agafia not liking such a form of entertainment. Another innovation of Tsar, dating from the beginning of his reign, was the introduction of “Page Corps” selected from the boys of “good families” who served as young Tsar’s company in his entertainments of early years. The uniform for those corps was invented by Tsar himself – white and rose coats decorated with pearls and precious furs. Tsar’s favorite Yazykov started his court service as a page boy of the Tsar back when Feodor was 16.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Feodor also introduced the new uniform for Palace Guards – red coats with white decorations and giant wings shamelessly plagiarized from Polish hussars. Given that the “winged” regiment was handpicked from the noblest men of the Muscovy and the looks were as important for serving there as the military prowess, the Palace Guards of Tsar were soon nicknamed “The Archangels”.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Feodor started massive rebuilding of Moscow, giving credits from state treasury to people who wanted to build stone houses – 10 thousands of those were build in Moscow in first six years of his reign. Faithful to his hobby – horse breeding – he decided to “get rid of fleabags of Russian peasantry” and established several breeding farms where the horses of draft breeds were to be bred and the stallions from those farms were to be bred (for small fee) with draft horses of peasants, thus improving the pedigree of those.[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\n[/FONT][FONT=&quot]The most notable reform of Feodor III, however, was the abolition in 1682, at the suggestion of Vasily Galytzine, the system of mestnichestvo, or \"place priority\", which had paralyzed the whole civil and military administration of Muscovy for generations. Henceforth all appointments to the civil and military services were to be determined by merit and the will of the sovereign, while pedigree (nobility) books were to be destroyed. He also attempted to standardize the ranks of civil and military services, issuing the List of Ranks where the military, court and diplomatic ranks were measured against each other, so that certain military rank gave access to the privileges of certain court position and vise versa. In addition to organizing military ranks, Feodor also established the organization of military districts and regulated the powers of governors of provinces, granting them fixing allowances but stopping them from holding fief-offices. [/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\n[/FONT][FONT=&quot]The Tsar, being keen analyst himself, has a great strategic mind, even if in somewhat frail body (he was not about individual military prowess, and later in life it will be his brother who will be one of the finest generals of Russia). His nickname “the Most Cunning” was earned by him in 1680, when Feodor, who did not want to drag on the war with Turkey, which was fought almost exclusively for the benefits of the Ukrainian vassals of Russia with no direct profit for Russia itself, secretly ordered to blow up the city of Chygyrin before seizing it to Turks – the city, a capital of Ukrainian Hetmanate, was a source of massive back and forth struggles between Turks and Russians with Ukrainians being the only ones to gain any profit from it. Feodor was more likely to see Chygyrin burn than to lose lives of Russian soldiers in pursue of the gains of the Ukrainians. With Chygyrin blown up Turks, while technically forcing Russian army to retreat from the Right Bank of Dnepr, gained nothing, and the Bakhchisaray Peace Treaty ended the war in 1681 on terms quite favorable for Russia, establishing its sovereignty over Left-Bank Ukraine (this treaty, however, will turn out to be more of a ceasefire, as it will be broken mere ten years after).[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\n[/FONT][FONT=&quot]Instead of wasting Russian lives in the wars from which only the Ukrainian Hetmanate will benefit, Feodor accepted the proposal of General Kosagov on building the circle of fortifications on the south border of Russian territories, protecting the fertile lands from attacks by Crimean Tatars.[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\n[/FONT][FONT=&quot]The only somewhat adventurous military campaign of the first decade of Feodor’s reign was the Amur War with China, ending in 1692 with Nerchinsk Treaty, granting Russia the left bank of Amur River. The Quing armies were logistically superior to Russians, however, this war was seen as the way to get rid of highly rebellious elements in Muscovy – namely, Feodor actively acquired the services of Don Cossacks and sent some undesirable military commanders away from Moscow – the ones found guilty of conspiring to kill Feodor and crown his mentally challenged brother Ivan with Miloslavsky as a regent for reliable puppet Tsar. Those additional resources allowed Russia to wage war with Manchu slightly better than OTL with definite decision on borders, unlike vague buffer. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]It was also a way to give Lev Naryshkin semi-important post of the governor of newly established province in the Far East (dubbed “Novorossia” – New Russia), removing him into honorable exile. Thus all the power-hungry relatives were removed from the capital (and importantly-sounding appointment with governor’s status was a way to please the Dowager Tsarina, whom Feodor tolerated only because he adored his half-siblings – Natalya was not a pleasant person). Lev was, apart from fortifying Amur region from Chinese, given the task to coordinate the mapping the Amur River – only upstream of Amur was known to Russians back then, and there were some rather crazy theories about its downstream, such as the Amur River being as big as the Amazon River (even Russian ambassador in China believed those rumors since the Manchy also knew little about Amur downstream). Novorossia was populated mostly by Cossacks and later also by the Old Believers who fled persecutions by the Tsar (more on this later). The town of Feodoropolis-on-Amur was founded in 1695 (in place of OTL Khabarovsk).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Lev Naryshkin, the first governor of Novorossia-on-Amur, founder of Feodoropolis-on-Amur[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]However, the Tsar was left the difficult inheritance in form of Raskol between Reformed Orthodox Church and the supporters of “Old Faith” (“starovery”, the Old Believers). Reformers were regarded as too “Greek” or almost “Catholic” (the ideologists of Reformist Church were frequently from Belarus and Ukraine, including the teacher of older children of Alexis Mikhailovich, Simeon Polotsky, who, as his surname states, was of Polotsk in Belarus, and their upbringing in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth had Basilian or even Jesuit roots), and the Tsar, who did not hide his Polish affections, was viewed by Old Faith supporters as somebody who will bring Catholics to power in Russia or even as a secret Catholic. The conflicts between young Tsar and the Old Faith supporters peaked when the spiritual leader of the Old Believers – Protopope Avvacum, ordered his followers to dirty the icons of Alexis Mikhailovich, placed in churches of Moscow in mourning of late Tsar, with tar. For Feodor that was more than heretical action – that was a family matter. The fate of Avvacum was sealed – he was burned at the stake in 1682. The same year Feodor ordered the founding of the first Russian higher education establishment – Slavonic-Greek-Latin Academy. The council of the Academy professors was, among other matters, to review the heresy cases. It was sometimes referred as the “Orthodox Inquisition” but it was the necessary measure, since the Tsar was not the one to seek compromises with “heretics” – even if he was to be dubbed a “Papist” or “Antichrist” by them for his deeds.[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\n[/FONT][FONT=&quot]The Academy itself was given a charter similar to the universities of Western Europe, signed by the Tsar himself. The academy was placed under the care of the Patriarch Prikaz. The curriculum was divided into several levels (\"schools\"), including Slavonic and Greek writing, seven liberal arts (septem artes liberales), and theology. Later, under influence of Ukrainian teachers, Latin was added to the curriculum. [/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\n[/FONT][FONT=&quot]The Academy was designed as university for young men of senior clergy and noble descent, however that was not only education reform attempted by Feodor. In 1682 he signed The Act of Vocational Schools where the orphan children of common descent were to learn the skills highly valuable at labor market from foreign specialists – becoming architects, engineers, jewelry designers etc. Two of such schools were opened in Moscow in 1685, with classes in them taught by craftsmen from Nemetskaya Sloboda (German Town – a district of Moscow populated by immigrants from Western Europe).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The family life of Tsar had its high and low points. In 1681 the court rejoiced at the birth of a heir, Tsarevich Ilya [2]. However, the same year Feodor had a quarrel with his sister, Sophia Alexeevna, who was now the head of Miloslavsky court party, and while supportive of her brother in early years of his reign, was found conspiring with his cousin. Another princess could have ended in monastery. However Feodor had other plans for Sophia, who is highly educated (she got the same education as Feodor and their late elder brother Alexis) and is fluent in Polish and Latin – the first dynastic marriage of Russian princess abroad since the times of Ivan the Terrible. Sophia is to marry Frederick Kettler, second son of Duke of Courland, on condition of her husband not forcing her to convert and allowing her to keep the staff of Orthodox priests. She is given substantial dowry and the marriage is to serve as the guarantee of Courland being a trading ally for Russia, with trade of Russian goods performed through the ports of Courland.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Due to improvement of relations with Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth being as desirable as difficult, Feodor has to settle for a vassal of Poland, gaining quite an ally, since Duke Jakob Kettler was interested in Russian resources and being “official dealer” for Russian goods, and Russia was interested in trade using Courland ports and in invitation of Courland specialists and craftsmen to work in Russia. So the marriage (being the last thing Duke Jakob authorized before his death) is quite beneficial for both countries and will play the important role in Baltic politics of the next decade.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\n[/FONT][FONT=&quot]Sophia Alexeevna of Russia, soon to be nicknamed a “Russian She-Bear” by her brother-in-law[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\n[/FONT][FONT=&quot]A Polonophile, Feodor was not against improvement of relations with Poland itself via marriages, however such a marriage bears the inherent risk of bride’s conversion, not to mention other complications of John Sobieski’s sons to be wed to Feodor’s sisters. The dowry of any Russian princess (there were two suitable Tsarevnas for young Jakub (James) Sobieski or Alexander Sobieski – Feodosia, born in 1662, and Natalya, born in 1673) also had to include Kiev, the return of which to Commonwealth was HIGHLY undesirable for Russia. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]However, the Eternal Peace with Poland in 1686 is signed to solve the Kiev issue and the issue of Orthodox Faith in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Tsar of Russia was to be assigned the title of Supreme Protector of Orthodox Christians of Commonwealth, Kiev was to belong to Russia permanently, along with provinces of Severia, Chernigov Principality and Left-Bank Ukraine, the Commonwealth received monetary compensation in amount of 146 thousand rubles, the Hetmanate territory with Cherkassy and Chygyrin was declared the neutral buffer zone, neither Russia nor Commonwealth wanting to claim this troublesome territory.[/FONT]\n\nRussia in exchange for that was to enter the war with Crimean Khanate, the vassal of Ottoman Empire, effectively joining the Holy League with Commonwealth, Venice and Austria. Not willing to deal with main Turkish forces, Russia, however, was happy to deal with Tatar problem, due to Tatars frequently attacking the newly built Izyum fortification circle. General Kosagov, prime Russian specialist in the matter of kicking Tatar ass, is assigned the de-facto commander in chief, de-jure commander in-chief being Prince Mikhail Dolgorukov [3], the tutor to Feodor, due to Kosagov not being noble enough for commander in-chief position (old court superstitions die hard). Feodor has to stay in Moscow – supervising the renovation of Izmaylovo Estate Park in image of Versailles Gardens, of which he heard a lot from ambassadors, and spending some quality time with his family – Tsesarevich-Successor Ilya is a sickly boy, reminding Feodor more of his brother Ivan, than of himself.\n\nNevertheless, Feodor attended a few parades and drills (taking his young half-brother Peter with him, who is now old enough to attend classes at the Academy) and was highly pleased by the weaponry and tactics of Russian army – hand grenades and prototype riffles (“pistchaly vintovannye” – “rifled-barrel flintlocks”) were already implemented by the Russians in war of 1676-1681, and new models of field artillery, made in image of the state-of-art Dutch artillery with assistance of the Courland specialists provided by Tsar’s in-laws (Courland was an important regional weapon trader under Duke Jakob), fill the Tsar’s heart with delight. Young Peter finds mock drills his favorite past-time and his brother allows him to keep his “Amusement Guard” at Preobrazhenskoye Estate, made of local boys of approximately Peter’s age. A present for Peter’s thirteenth birthday is a boat made in England for amusement sailing in the estate ponds – and the Tsar promises that if little Pete won’t skip classes at the Academy and will learn all the things a good prince needs to know, he’ll be soon sent to Courland to visit his sister on state visit and will be able to take ride on REAL warships.\n\nThe conclusion of Eternal Peace also cemented the position of Prince Vasily Galitzine as the Chancellor, minister of foreign affairs and de-facto head of government. His only fault is probably-way-too-romantic correspondence with Princess Sophia of Courland, but the letters are just letters, and Feodor considers any possible feelings between Galitzine and his sister to be platonic, not to mention that Sophia is obviously faithful to her husband, which is evident by birth of healthy daughter Maria in 1685.\n\nJohn Sobieski's wins in 1686-1687 are not limited by Russia joining the Holy League. The Electoral Prince of Brandenburg-Prussia, Ludwig, suddenly dies in 1684 from the bout of appendicitis, and thus his young widow, the greatest heiress of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Princess Ludwika Karolina Radziwiłł, is free to marry Jakub Sobieski [4]. Such marriage not only strengthens the relations of Sobieski and Radziwill magnate families (John’s sister is already married to a Radzivill), but makes Jakub a Prince of HRE juro uxoris with the title of Duke of Slutsk.\n\nLudwika Karolina Sobieska, nee Radzivill, suo jure Duchess of Slutsk, Biržai and Dubingiai, “The New Barbara Radzivill\"\n\nNotes:[1] In OTL it left him crippled for life\n\n[2] [FONT=&quot]Note: In OTL both Ilya and Agafia died[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot][3] In OTL he was killed in palace coup of 1682[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot][4] In OTL the appendicitis attack happened in 1688, with Austrian Court being interested to remarry Ludwika to Charles-Philip of Neuburg. Here, however, Philip is just a seventh son of minor Duke without electoral title (whose family's only claim to fame is their rabbit-like fertility), and Ludwika Karolina is free to marry Jakub.\n\n[/FONT]"
