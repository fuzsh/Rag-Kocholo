        "text": "This chapter focuses on one of Catalina Micaelas and Carlo Emanuele Is ten children: Margherita of Savoy-Gonzaga (1589-1655). Her father, the duke of Savoy, was pragmatic and smart: after conquering the marquisate of Saluzzo, he chose to focus his policies on Italian peninsula rather than on France and conceived strategic wedding for Margherita and her younger sister Isabella. When her father-in-law Vincenzo and her husband both died in 1612, Margherita ruled the duchies of Mantua and Monferrato as dukes widow and as mother of princess Maria, born in 1609. Cristina, who had married Vittorio Amedeo I in 1619, introduced some novelty as regards matters of courtesy and priorities and Margherita and her sisters Maria Apollonia and Francesca Caterina intended to leave your fathers state to show their dissension. Margherita of Savoy-Gonzaga died in Miranda de Ebro on June 25, 1655. Her last will is a personal political statement delineating the three facets of her life, as princess, consort, and sovereign."
