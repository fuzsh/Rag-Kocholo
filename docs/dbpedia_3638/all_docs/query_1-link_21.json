One could almost imagine this Cinderella saying to Flcnagan, “ O my .dear, dear bud, welcome home 1 ” Indeed, one wished she would, and even finish Margery Pinchwife’s accueil : “ Why dost thou look so fropish ? Who has nangered thee ? ” “ Nangered ? ” I can see Bud’s face as he repeats this. “ What’s ‘ nangered ’ ? ” How poor the modem songs are compared with those of fifty years ago I Vesta Tilley made it seem natural that Robinson Crusoe should exchange those Arctic furs appropriate to Juan Fernandez, or wherever it was, for the West End blue serge suit, double-breasted fancy waistcoat, straw hat, and whangee cane in which to tell the story of Percy and Gladys — Romeo and Juliet of the warehouse and shop — whose romance, embodied by other Percys and Gladyses, gilds with eternal summer the dingy Margate boarding-house. In the ’nineties singers of the tender passion did not drool — ^remember the lilt and riot of Marie Lloyd’s The Wedding Bells were ringing ” ? — and the Blues had not yet infected the ether with their megrims. As I write somebody turns the knob of my radio, and I hear an oily, scented male voice crooning : “ . . . like asparagus in season. And that is the reason You’d be so nice to come home to.” And I think again of Veita Tilley, and the greater charm, sophistica- tion, and sense of her ” Into a cookshop he goes dashinf^ ; Who should bnng his plate of hash in But the girl he had been mashing By the sad sea waves.” EGO 9 Jan. 8 At the Caf£ Royal to-night I met a Bloomsburyite who Thursday. started babbling about Jean-Paul Sartre and his philo- sophy of Existentialism. In the course of his babbling he let out that he had never heard of Fred Kamo. Whereupon I told him to keep quiet while I jotted down a General Knowledge Paper for a Youth Envisaging a Literary Career. And put Mooncalf through it, with astonishing results. He thought the earth’s diameter was 98,000 miles. Thought Lent was the period between Easter and Whitsun. Hadn’t heard of Euclid. Couldn't multiply a-f-6 by a-\\-b. Had never read a word of Milton, Tennyson, Keats. Couldn’t quote any line from Gray’s Elegy. Couldn’t fill in the blanks in “ From fairest — we desire increase. That thereby beauty’s — might never die.” Saw nothing wrong about “ The expensive spirit is a waste of shame. . . .” Hadn’t opened any book by Dickens or Thackeray. Had never heard of Sayers and Heenan, “ W. G.,” Fred Archer, John Roberts, Arthur Roberts, Harry Vardon. Didn’t know what school Tom Brown went to, or who was jts headmaster. » Thought Henry VIII had eight wives, but could mention only Lady Jane Grey. Had never heard of the Jameson Raid. Saw nothing wrong with “ hidjus,” the ‘‘ woom ” of Time, Volterre, Gerter, Walt Whiteman. Thought Grock was a patent medicine. Had no notion which Gilbert and Sullivan character wanted to make the punishment fit the crime. ” I hope not I ” said Mooncalf. And started to put the case for abolishing punishment in favour of rehabilitation through self-respect. Winding up with : “ The trouble with you old men is that you confuse forma- tive principles with factual knowledge. The object of education is to enable the individual to make original contribution to the whole. And you mix this up with spelling ! ” Jan. 4 The following speaks for itself : Friday. Ameshury Lodge George Road Guernsey Channel Isles 8rd January Dear Mr Agate, An austerely bound copy of Boswell’s Life of Johnson came into my possession several months ago in the most gratifying manner possible. You announced that you had a very limited number of copies, and would present them to those members of H.M. Forces who wrote and asked nicely ! From my mud-spattered outpost of Empire in the Fen country I EGO 9 wrote. When the little volume arrived I wrote again, to say thank you. Then — ^well, the attached poem finishes the melancholy tale. The poet, an Australian Air Gunner, shared my love of the absurd Doctor, and often yre read extracts by the light of the remote Norfolk moon. But the poet, like my copy of the book, is gone. He was blown to pieces over Germany during the last few weeks of the war. He was nineteen years old. Yours very sincerely, Penelope Phimp-Smith ON LOSING YOUR COPY OF “ DOCTOR JOHNSON ” Once, while I kissed yon, A little yellow book That clever hands had made. And fine-set print Endowed with august character. Tiring of the life it knew (Melancholy without stint), Spent in the shade Of dusty corners — drugged, by chance. By your new, exciting nearness. Rebellious did race Along the ledge, to dance. And topple down, in drunk distress. Into the brook. Perhaps there was a splash ! Protesting cry, And clutcliing of a cardboard throat As the water, rising high, Flowed o’er his well-thumbed coat, A gurgling and pedantic sigh As he sped To a sanded shelf. But I Then was kissing you, who, if the stars Had fallen in a shining heap Along the entire, moon -lit wall, Would not have heard them fall yourself 1 Would not have felt the pebbles start. For you were too close To my head and my heart To see the deep- Shaded doctor looking from his sleep (T>eruke a little twisted on his head). Nuiads used his silver-headed cane, Reed-garfanded, for a maypole, On the green river-bed. And, on a well-hosed knee, A pleading little fish-boy Cried for his watch-chain. R. A.

Not having read his verses, I say confidently No. Says he thinks he may be a better musician. I say, “ Play something.” And he plays half of the first movement of his first sonata. Not bad. Then something for a film — mixture of Addinsell and Rachmaninoff. Then Wood Echoes, which he thinks is a mSlange of Delius and Sibelius, and I tell him is Edward German edited by Norman O’Neill. When he has gone 1 find this on my desk : And you came to me late, Your cheeks smeared with the wet signatures of Spring, After a little loneliness and silken laughter Alone by night like a tired king. Jan. 6 This week’s letters : Sunday. 1 . Eastbourr^e Dear Mr Agate, Do you think you could stand living with a genious for long ? Of course my sister Connie may not be a genious but she acts like one which is worse. She has just writen a play and its going to be acted and she says she’s going to send it to you for you to judge. If she does please tell her its tripe (it is very probably tripe in any case), then perhaps she won’t be so awfull to talk to. She won’t let me see her play because she says it isnt fit for little boys. (I’m 15) In disgust F. Rubble 2. Remembering my dear Rebecca’s enchanting letter after Brother Mycroft had called her “ odious ” (Ego 2, p. 105), I have no hesitation in including part of the latest from my little Dublin friend, J. E. Jordan : Browsing in Ego 2, my back against the hard library shelves, my chest heaving with joy, I was delighted to see how much your nice Brother Mycroft dislikes that awful Rebecca West. The woman is intolerable. For me her one redeeming quality is her genuine love for you. God knows I’m no Virginia Woolf fan, but I infinitely prefer her “ meandering ” novels, which you find intoler- able and unreadable, to the gibberings and mouthings of la West. I grunted in satisfaction when I saw in your Jan. 2nd Taller article mention of Theodore de Banville and his foreseeing of the cinema. 10 EGO 9 I wondered when you were going to use that ; I was amazed that a man of your perspicacity had not noticed the startling common sense of Baring^s essay on “ Punch and Judy,” in which he quotes Theodore. But now you have used it, and I’m glad. Baring’s death shocked me. Only Shaw (ninety this year). Wells (eighty this year), Belloc (seventy-six this year), and you (sixty-nine this year) remain of my literary gods. Enough. I’m gibbering in a singularly Rebecca-ish manner. 8. From Reginald Moore, Editor of Modem Reading : If you find anything odiously intellectual in thii^ number of Modem Beading I promise to eat your page of the Express. A challenge is a challenge, and here is how, on Saturday, I propose to take up this one : Opening M.R. at an article entitled “ Henry Goes Honky- Tonk,” I find Henry Treece telling me : -* • 1. That the thrill of Boogie Woogie “ comes from the adventure of letting the hands ‘ taste ’ the white and black in sponta- neous rhythmic patterns.” 2. That Boogie means “ an America of smoke-laden below- stairs dives where a thug talks quietly out of the side of his mouth to a moll in a fur coat, and a third-rate pugilist argues in a Bowery voice with a wild-collared newspaperman whose mind is on selling more and more of the latest kind of cereal so that he can buy a faster car on a new instalment plan and so get an even snappier dame than the one in the corner in the fur coat.” 8. That this below-stairs music, this tuneless row, this animal frenzy, this natural expression of garage-hand or coloured cab- washer, “ states a proposition, an hypothesis, in terms almost as pure as a Bach fugue, or a Debussy Prelude. . . . That, then, is what Boogie means to me ; it can send me in a way I have never known before. No, not even from a Marlowe rant, or the first thrill of Pieter Breughel.” Bon appHit, Mr Moore 1 Jan. 7 Cutting from a provincial newspaper: ‘‘The quartets Monday, played ere t.’’ose of Cesar French in D major and Hugo Folf’s Italian Serenade.” Letter from a young highbrow asking whether I am aware that I base my prose on the principle of systole and diastole. Somewhat spoils the effect of this by calling Jock and me the Caster and Pollocks 11 EGO 9 of dramatic criticism. After which I am not surprised to hear that I am ** a jagua wollowing in its jungle.” Jan. 8 E. V. Lucas once said in praise of a man that ” he never Tuesday, let you know if he was tired.” I just can’t help showing when I am whacked. In the early autumn of 1857 Dickens wrote to Forster : Too late to say, put the curb on, and don’t rush at hills — the wrong man to say it to. I have now no relief but in action. I am become incapable of rest. I am quite confident I should rust, break, and die, if I spared myself. Much better to die, doing. What I am in that way, nature made me first, and my way of life has of late, alas ! eonfirmed. I must aceept the drawbaek — sinee it is one — with the powers I have ; and I must hold upon the tenure prescribed to me. Why do I quote this ? Because at the pantomime at the Cambridge last night I remember lighting a cigar as the eurtain went up. And then nothing more till it eame down at the end of the first half. And they told me that the Ganjou Brothers had been throwing Juanita about ! Jan. 10 Letter to an old friend : Thursday. Queen Alexandra Mansions Grape Street, W.C.2 Dear George Lyttelton, I sat up late last night re-reading Max’s And Even Now. In the very first essay, ‘‘ A Relic,” I thought I caught Max out in the sentence : “ A temper so violent as Mile Ang^lique’s must surely have brought its owner to the grave, long since.” Could Max be right, and Fowler, after all these years, wrong ? Can ‘ since ’ be used in the sense of * ago ’ ? Unlike Max to use a vulgarism in a book every sentence of which has been, to use Lear’s phrase, “ squinnied at.” Three o’clock in the morning found me looking for some classic example which would justify Max. I found it in Sir Philip Sidney : “ About two years since, it so fell out, that he was brought to a great lady’s house.” In the essay “ Quia Imperfectum ” I found a charming howler. Max, projecting a museum of uncompleted masterpieces — this to include Penelope’s web and the original designs for the Tower of Babel — suggests ” an early score of that one unfinished Symphony of Beethoven’s — I forget the number of it, but anyhow it is my favourite.” Why don't men of letters get somebody to check them when they write of things outside their range f 12 EGO 9 And then I really did catch him out. This was in the essay “ A Point to be Remembered,” the point being that the Very Eminent, desirous of making an impression on a greenhorn, should always make an entry' and never be entered upon : ” Let those of them who have been playgoers cast their minds baek to their experience of theatres. Can they recall a single play in which the principal actor was ‘ discovered ’ sitting or standing on the stage when the curtain rose ? No. The actor, by the very nature of his calling, does, must, study personal effect. No playwright would dare to dump down his principal actor at the outset of a play.** (Italics mine.) Whereupon I began to cast about for refutation of Max’s theory. Richard III : “ Now is the winter of our discontent.” Volpone : “ Good morning to the day, and next, my gold I ” Faustus : “ Settle thy studies, Faustus, and begin.” Manly, in The Plain Dealer : “ Tell not me, my good Lord Plausible, of your decorums, supercilious forms, and slavish ceremonies.” Valentine, in Love for Love, telling Jeremy to clear his books away. Sir John Brute, in The Provok'd Wife, saying, “ What cloying meat is love, when matrimony’s the sauce to it ! ” And what about Almcria, in Congreve’s The»Mourning Rnde-s-that play which, d’you remember, was th*e first cause of our coming together ? — with her “ Music has charms to soothe the savage breast ” ? Peer Gynt telling his mother he’s not lying ? Rebecca West telling the housekeeper to lay the table for supper ? And Alice telling Edgar, in Strindberg’s Dance of Death, that it would be decent to keep quiet about a silver wedding ? These are all I had thought of up till 4 a.m. Ever, James Agate P.S. 5 A.M. What about (Edipus Rex and Le Misanthrope ? Jan. 13 Peter Brook, the stage director, has an interesting letter Sunday. in to-day’s S.T. about his recent production of King John at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre : It was obvious from the first that the audience would miss the meaning, and thus the force, of the ivhole of the great soliloquy about “ Commodity ” because of the complete change of sense that this word has undergone. Yet, to substitutt j.nother word through- out would have been unpardonably irritating to those who knew the speech. Consequently we introduced an extra phrase on the first ■ .ipeai mce of the word to ‘ plant ’ its meaning : Th^t, smo 'fli-fac’d gentleman. Expediency, Or, as they say, tickling Commodity, Commodity, the bias of the world. . . . P. B. seems to be worried about the legitimacy of this. On the whole I am for rather than against, when strictly necessary. In the 18 EOO 9 Bastard’s speech there is no great poetry to be interfered with, and no familiar passage. But are we to have the emendation Thus conscience — meanir^ thereby consdovmessy Awareness — does make cowards of us all ? Season your admiration — since you starts And all your visage cries astonishment — With an attent ear, etc., etc. I strongly suspect that when Lady Macbeth told her husband he had ‘‘ broke the good meeting With most admired disorder ” she was not using ‘‘ admired ” in the modern sense. But I should boggle at some such elucidatory rewriting as : Lady M. You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting, With most admired disorder — going off The deep end at a silly^ peevish ghost Strongly suggests that Scotland's majesty Should get a hold on*s self. And I should certainly not ^.llow any Macbeth I directed to 0 enlarge thus-wise : Thou hast no speculation — naught to do With throwing sprat to catch your mackerel. Nor yet debating if to be or not. Nor e'en that perlustration Walkley loved. But used in purest sense of optic power. The opposite of nictitation, Ablepsy, amaurosis, and the like — Let me repeat : horrible shadow, know Thou hast no speculation in those eyes Which thou dost glare with. But enough of babble, as Gilbert’s Lady Jane remarked. Jan. 14 From Henry Treeee ; Monday. I see you have been naughty again. Nevertheless, I commend your assiduity in smacking me. I cannot believe that you don’t like Boogie. That would be like saying you won’t have a telephone in your house, or cannot stand Technicolor. Anyway, I shall say a bad thing about you in my next book. How 1 See Apocalypse, as though you or I cared. Henry Treece But it is in Mrs Osa Johnson’s Bride in the Solomons that I find the final word on Boogie-Woogie. It appears that if, in these islands, you want a native to bring you your saw you say, “ You ketchum one fellah saw belong me.” If the man is exceptionally stupid you have It Photo Huron Basil Carnet on “ Shall I take my mbltcK ? ” EGO 9 to explain to him that the saw is part of the hammer family. Where- fore you say, “ You ketchum one fellah, he brother belong hammer. You push him, he.go ; you pull him, he come.” Boogie-Woogie bears the same relation to music that the Solomon Islander’s gibberish bears to English. Jan. 15 ” Mais je vais vivre ! Ah 1 que je me sens bien 1 ” were Tuesday, the last words of Dumas’s heroine. Jan de Hartog’s young woman puts it the other way round : ” Let me die 1 I have all I want 1 ” This pair had two things in* common — consumption and a lover. Well, times change, as somebody remarked. One hundred — ^to be exact, ninety-eight — years ago union with the beloved was tlie be-all of existence ; to judge from Hartog’s Death of a Rat (Lyric, Hammersmith), union to-day is the end-all. But perhaps we should look not to the time-lapse, but to the characters for the explanation of so startling a volte-face. Poor Marguerite was, God bless us, a l^ng of naught, whereas Yolan is a distillation of pure spirit. As I sat in my stall I couldn’t help thinking of that Julia, spouse of Henry Wititterly, certified as ” all soul ” by Sir Tumley Snuifim, and for whose life that eminent physician would not give a pinch of snuff. Not that he did not do his medical best. “ I believe I may venture to say,” said Mr Wititterly, ” that Mrs Wititterly is the first person who took the new medicine which is supposed to have destroyed a family at Kensington Gravel Pits.” And Julia, in a faint voice, believed she was. If I had been one of the two doctors in de Hartog’s play I should have tried the stuff on Yolan. The pretentious creature was a Bachelor of Astronomy. In addition, she was a Galtonic visualiser, or possibly a Dunne’s-Theory-of-Time-ist (so clever a girl would not need to bother about a Dutch translation) who ‘‘ interpreted actual reality in terms of prognostic reality.” This enabled her to foretell the entry of Holland into the War three months later, and draw a picture of the elderly doctor dangling from a gibbet with blue tongut protruding between blue lips. Which brought us to the atom bomb. And finally to what every highbrow playwright with a gammonable management at his mercy wa. ;ts to talk about — ^the ultimate meaning of life and death. “ Life,” said Yolan, ” is expelled from matter at death, and returns as other matter at birth.” (Had she neve^ heard of Ibsen’s Button- Moulder ?) Like Julia Wititterly, Yolan “ formed an immens e variety of opinions on an immense variety of subjects.” Pamela Brown lovely, and not to be kept by boshist or fiapdoodler from EGO 9 pacing upon the mountains overhead, hiding her face amid authentic stars. Jan. 16 Letter to a columnist : Wednesday. Q,ueen Alexandra Mansions Grape Street, W.C.2 My dear Colleague, My justification for this letter, remonstrance, or what you will is that we are colleagues and I am persuaded that we have the same feeling for the memory of a great artist. But I cannot help thinking that you have traduced a great stage figure. Unwittingly, I am sure. Let me come to facts. You ask, “ What should we make of Sarah Bernhardt now ? Have we grown out of the particular form her genius took ? . . . Perhaps I am influenced by the horror which my only sight of her bred in me — ^this terrifying old woman with ];ier crimped hair, trying to play a boy of twenty.” So far I have nothing to say ; you are perfectly entitled to hold, and record, any impression you may have. What, in all courtesy, I will say to you is that you must not misrepresent facts. You say that you saw Sarah Bernhardt play L’Aiglon “ just before her last illness, from a bath- chair.” To which I can only say in my most Shakespearean manner. Columnist, as low as to thy heart, Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest. Or put it that thou misstatest and taradiddlest ! Thou didst not see Sarah play L’Aiglon from a bath-chair. In the absence of qualification this implies that Sarah had that contraption wheeled on to the field of Wagram and spouted from it. If you saw her in this piece after her operation it could only have been in the death scene, which she played on a sort of couch or camp bed. Verneuil is categorical about this : “ She adored L’Aiglon, and, being no longer able to perform it herself since her operation, she liked to see it come to life again in the persons of those who succeeded her.” ” L’Aiglon . . . which she played until she was sixty-nine.” “ . . . the death of L’Aiglon, a magnificent spectacle, but the epilogue of a play in six acts. When she played it alone her regrets became more poignant at having to renounce the rest of the part.” Sarah had an intense horror of the ridiculous. After the amputation of her leg she never appeared in any part which 16 EGO 9 necessitated movement. Les Caihidrales, the death scenes of Marguerite Gautier and the little Due de Reichstadt, Daniel, and those portions of one or two classical rdles in which she could declaim from a palanquin or litter — ^these, I think, were all. To suggest that she broke this self-imposed rule is unfair to a great artist’s sense of discretion. You also tell your readers that Sarah was relatively imknown and had made no particular stir until “ in one of those plays which Sardou turned out as rapidly as works our industrious Mr Rattigan ” she produced la voix d*or. But what are the facts ? The first piece of Sardpu in which Sarah played was Fidora (1882). Now let us glance at her career up to that point. She had appeared at the Com^die Franyaise in Hernani, Phkdre, Adrienne Lecoiwreur, Froufrou, La Dame awn CamMias, Le Sphinx, UFtrangh'e, La Princesse Georges, She had taken London by storm. (See La Comidie Franfaise d Londres, 1871-1879, edited by Georges d’Heylli ; Ollendorff, 1880.) She had completed her seven months’ tour of America, during which she gave 156 performances in 50 towns, the box-office takings amounting to 2,667,600 francs. ‘ She had been hailed by Sarcey as the possessor of “ a talent of the first order.” Victor Hugo had written verses to her. She had been painted by Parrot, Louise Abb6ma, Bastien-Lepage, and Walter Spindler. And here is some- thing which nails to the counter your fiction about the voix d'or. I quote from Sarcey’s article in the issue of Le Temps for November 11, 1872. The great French critic was commenting on Sarah’s d^but at the Comidie in Mademoiselle de Belle-Isle : “ Elle dit ses trois premiers actes avec un tremblement con- vulsif, et nous ne retrouv&mes la Sarah de Buy Bias que dans deux couplets qu’elle fila de sa voix enchanteresse avec une grace mer- veilleuse.” And yet you would have your readers believe that in 1882 Sarah had made no particular stir and the golden voice had not been heard. Fie upon you, my dear colleague ! What about an inch or two of sackcloth and a sprinkling of ashes ? Yours sincerely, James Agate Jan. 19 T’.ere was a fine gathering at the Sunday Times Saturday. luncheon to its editor, W. W. Hadley, in honour of his eightieth birthday.

Jan. 20 Fell in to-night with a Dr Freddy Renner, a native of Sunday. Hamburg and a distant connection of my old friends there. He talked to me at length of his recent experiences in Nuremberg, where he has been watching the trial. “ Most of the accused are listless and apathetic, like ghosts, or even dead men. Only Goering shows any liveliness, which he uses to curry favour with the Americans.” Among the other things I gathered were : 1. The Germans are wholly preoccupied with how to get food, cigarettes, chocolate. 2. In so far as they have a mind for anything else they have no guilt-consciousness. 3. They are indifferent to what happens to the war criminals. These are the men who misled the Fuehrer and let him down. 4. The average German knew nothing about the atrocities, and neither did Hitler. 5. The only hope for Germany is in another Fuehrer. 6. The German ideology is unchanged. War is war. “ The Americans are very happy in Nuremberg. Next time we shall be happy in New York.” The foregoing was given to me by Dr Renner as the essenee of over a thousand conversations.

I haven’t seen my employer for several days. Pressure of work unfortunately prevented him from noticing the pile of correspondence that was gradually collecting round him, and, alas ! he is now completely covered ! The housekeeper, the house- boy, and myseSf have been working like slaves to get the mass of letters cleared away. We work on the chain system. I type the replies as they hand up the letters. At our present rate it ought not to be long before we uncover Mr Agate, though the postman still mercilessly pours batches through the letter-box. At one time we thought of asking the Borough of Holborn to lend us a snow- plough, but we decided against it, as Mr Agate isn’t very strong. An occasional flurry and a few grunts deprofundis lead us to believe that he is still working. If you would care to write again in a short time I am sure my employer would be pleased to lecture. Indeed, I think I heard him say so just before he went down. Yours faithfully, John Booth-Palmer Secretary Jan. 25 Letter from Henry Treece : Friday. 55 Ferriby Road Barton upon-Humber Lines Dear J ^mes Vgate, Your Solomon Island hammer-and-saw argot is interesting, though not very relevant. I'lowever, it seems to me that the native ‘English has its uses. It carries a meaning between a brown man and a white one, which otherwise would not be possible. Boogie does approximately the same thing, though because of IB EOO 9 its formal restrictions that message must be a limited one, as I explained in my article. Nevertheless, it is a message that some people need, and which isn’t conveyed by Handel or Scriabin or Delius or Elgar. It is almost purely physical in its appeal, and produces a certain exhilaration, a musical drunkenness, which certain folk like. Now the pleasure of this exhilaration is intense and not to be ignored ; any more than one might ignore the pleasures produced by gin and bitters, a nice leg-glide, a beefsteak, or some of Tennyson. For all these pleasures are facets of that multiplicity which adds up to LIFE. I too know about * good * music ; but I am liberal enough to understand that there is more in music than can be got out of any one composer, or form, or period. Boogie, at its own level, supplies an emotional element of a specialised sort, which is absent in other forms of music. It is a primitive element, but an important one. It is perhaps foolish to pursue on paper an argument which depends largely on auditory sensations — and I must admit that you were remarkably good at selecting those passages from my article which didn’t come off because of that— .but I would ask you to listen tolerantly to the piano records of Albert Ammons, “ Lux ” Lewis, and Pete Johnson some time. I don’t imagine that you will ever like Boogie, but I feel sure that you will come to recognise in it a rhythmic and sometimes harmonic subtlety which puts it well above the cultural level of your Solomon Islander’s jargon. Yours sincerely, Henry Treece My reply : Queen Alexandra Mansions Grape Street, W.C.2 Dear Henry Treece, But we agree ! Many years ago George Moore described the reading of sloppy novels as “ an alternative form of bicycling.” I am perfectly prepared to regard Boogie-Woogie as an alternative form of sexual intercourse. But I will never call it music. Yours ever, James Aoate Jan. 27 Granville-Barker {Prefaces to Shakespeare, Fourth Series) Sunday. doubts whether Othello can be ranked with the major tragedies. Hamlet dies spiritually at peace ; Lear’s madness has been the means to his salvation ; by interpreting his life’s hell to us even Macbeth stirs us to some compassion. But what alchemy can bring the once noble Moor and the savage murderer into unity agjkjp ? 20 mt/n^ EGO 9 But suppose Shakespeare wasn’t bothering about unity ? Suppose he happened on Cinthio’s story and thought what a danmed good play it would make ? Why must he always write high-minded tragedies ? Why not a full-blooded drama, if he feels like it ? The Charles Morgans won’t be pleased — I remember how worried the Times critic was because Zola’s Laurent and Th^r^se hadn’t the nervous system of the Macbeths — ^but I don’t think that matters. Ivor Brown confessed on Sunday that the “ chop her into messes ” stuff sickened him — “ one should be braced, not sickened, by tragedy.” But why insist on tragedy ? Macbeth is a tragedy, and Richard III is a melodrama. I put Othello midway between — ^what the French call a drame. No, this isn’t a play for the Emersons, the Matthew Arnolds, or any critic who doesn’t understand temperament. It has never been a play for English actors, always with the exception of Kean. (Macready ? Too moral, too grave, too sublime.) The rest of ’em have all tended to make Othello behave like Mr Dombey apprised by Carker that Edith is extending her favours to Major Bagstock. The Moor’s spiritual home is not Portland Place, but all that tempera- mental zone south of Marseilles where volcanoes spout like whales and pastrycooks rip up their wives for an oeiUade. Jan. 29 Tuesday. Letter from Ivor Brown : The “ Observer ” 22 Tudor Street, E.C.4 Dear James, About Othello. If Shakespeare had written a play about a Sicilian pastrycook who knifed his women whenever he fancied another man’s paw upon them, well, all right. A Sicilian tragedian could roll about in this mud-and-blood, and nobody would com- plain. But Othello starts almost as a Noble Roman : he is a rational and admirable man : then, for utterly insufficient reason, he becomes ape and tiger. I don’t bebeve in him — and lago isn’t easy either. The result to me is sordid in a way that Shakespeare otherwise is not. Later on he could be (within the conditions of redeeming genius) silly, whimsical, grotesque — but not squalid ! If Othello is to be judged as a crime-story, then the villain should be a more nt»'ural 'xeature than the icy, diabolonian lago, and lago’s victim must be far less sensible at the start. If the excuse is Moorish Blood, then the vi.;e of the blood, must be manifest earlier instead of spilling over all at once. Yours, 1.

Three hours — three hours and a quarter, to be exact — at the West- minster to-night : Clifford Bax’s sentimental The Golden Eagle. All about Mary Queen of Scots. Clifford is obviously in love with an idealised Mary, who is about as interesting as a ^tapioca pudding. What I wanted to see was the Mary who looked like the flower, but was the serpent under it. Endowed with the brains of an Ugly Duchess. Resolute and remorseless schemer. Artist and virago, scholar and creature of appetite. The brilliantly clever woman who, at her trial, conducted her own defence. The defiant martyr who went to her execution in a bodice of crimson velvet and a petticoat of crimson satin. The obstreperous old girl who, on the scaffold, after the Dean of Peterborough had preached an interminable sermon at her, stood up to him in disputation and “ prayed in opposi- tion to him.” But then hardly anybody ever writes the play one wants on this subject. To-night’s company, headed by Claire Luce, did, I suppose, all they could with the milk-and-watery stuff. Not a glint of humour anywhere, except that every time David Horne came on I thought we were going to hear about that other Gunpowder Plot. Something to do with the hat and cloak, I suspect. Feh. 1 Second letter to my columnist : Friday. Q,ueen Alexandra Mansions Grape Street, W.C.2 My dear Colleague, Your apology, recantation, or what you will has roused most of the breed of Agates I My sister writes : “ Ce monsieur m'agace. He maintains in his second article that he saw Sarah play * only parts ’ of L'Aiglon from a sitting position. 22 EOO 0 That again is not true. He saw her play only one part — ^the death scene. Can’t you drive it into the dear fellow’s head that Sarah played no scene sitting down which before her operation she would have played standing up ? Then why does he say that ‘ most of her triumphs were scored in plays not always of the first (quality ’ ? Her greatest triumphs were in Racine, Hugo, Musset, Meilhac and Hal^vy, Dumas ^2$, Rostand, and Maeterlinck. She tried her hand at Shakespeare, Moli^re, Voltaire, Sudermann, Copp^e, Lemaitre, Mirbeau, Catulle Mend^s, and d’Annunzio. She played Fidora, Tosco, and the other Sardou pieces for the reason that our own Irving played The Bells — the financial reason. And, by the way, tell your friend from me that if he must instruct us about the French theatre, which we saw and he didn’t, he might at least get his accents right.” I have discharged the task laid upon me. But I warn you, my dear colleague, that if we have any more nonsense we shall let loose our Brother Mycroft, a javelin of rebuke in comparison with whom May and I are but paper darts. Ever, James Agate Feb. 2 Rummaging in a drawer to-day, I came across this. Saturday. It seems that I had asked Leo to help me out with a Toiler article, and the thing is supposed to be an extract from a highbrow novel I am recommending M.-6.-M. to film : Basil Bommery was, as usual, the last to arrive. Hot and dusty from his long journey, he eventailled himself with the icran painted by Boucher and given to his grandmother as a girl by Napoleon III. The circle, now complete, gathered round Professor Debuffer to hear something of his adventures in Central Africa. The Professor first produced a curious musical instrument, in shape a little like a helmet, with six strings on each side. This, he explained, was the Malanka-Cambamba, or Magic Harp of Angola, as it is called by the natives. He struck a few chords on this, chanting some verses in the Kapagongo dialect. Beckoning his audience to come nearer, the white-haired savant proceeded : “ When we arrived at Katapana we were received by six chiefs, each of whom offered us a putrescent coconut as an emblem of friendship. I produced my fiddle, Geoffrey Biddulph his viola, and together we played sonatas by Bach for two hours. This greatly <»xcited the chiefs: they danced, and one of the chiefs’ wives served us with Choroka-Choroka, a dish consisting of faded aspen-leaves braised in me glasses, and a delicacy, I was afterwards informed, normally proffered only to Royalty. A chief called Ovakuangar then played some tribal songs on the Machuculumbwe, a double-flute with twenty holes. This, explained Ovakuangar, 28 EOO 9 serves the dual purpose of being used as a musical instrument or a weapon in tribal disputes, since it is capable of discharging bullets at the rate of fifty per fifteen seconds. Dr Livingstone, I was told, had some difficulty in evading these missiles after reading the tribe of Chikumbalas lengthy extracts from Wordsworth’s Eorcumon. “ After this Sandra Lobilla and I played on our two bassoons, at which the chiefs were much delighted. They danced again and threw spears ecstatically at some of their women, who dodged them with practised eaypertise. One of the chiefs, I regret to say, threw a spear at me which nearly lodged in my rear. I protested against this, but the chief chief explained that it would be unthinkable, according: to the etiquette of his tribe, not to throw a spear at at least one guest in the course of the rejoicings. Next the chiefs ordered their soldiers to perform the Mkanyela, which is danced on one foot and one arm, each soldier balancing simultaneously a giant pineapple on his nose. The effect is enchanting, and reminds one of Gydnya Kosseloffsky in Rostopschin’s delightful ballet Night on the River Vodka. After the dance the chiefs invited us into their tent, which was decorated with the painted skulls of relatives, and served us with their own hand^ a huge dish of Bambocha, a fricassee made, so I was told, of the choicest Magagora lizards. “ We also drank the native brew, Chanuhongu, distilled from the gall-bladders of baby ichneumons. On parting the chiefs presented each of us with a skull containing stewed vipers to sustain us on our journey. Altogether a delightful visit, though Sonia Bodega found some difficulty with the native flies— or barotse, I think they are called — which are sometimes as much as two f^eet long and so powerful that they are capable of snatching up the local babies and carrying them off to the river.” Every one was greatly impressed by the Professor’s travel- story, and a nostalgic touch was added when the venerable lecturer threw himself face-downward on the thistles and murmured, in a voice choked with tears, ” Karaheitei Bazizuzu Olikaka, kaka, koko.” For some moments there was silence. And then, “ Quelle nuit ambrosienne ! ” sighed the Baronne de la Frfile-Derri^re. Feh. 5 In a delightful letter from 6. B. E. Noel, of the Red Tuesday. House, Lewes Road, East Grinstead : There is one man who for years went through the most ex- asperating experiences — ^not just occasionally, but at least twice nightly and at matinees. And never a word — ^not even a “ tut ” — did he utter, although subjected to the ribald laughter of the crowd. Yet he never did anything to improve his lot ; whenever I saw him his clothes appeared, like those of the Divine Sarah (Gamp — ^not Bernhardt), to be “ a shade more snuffy,” his hair more frowsy, and his boots, like those of the discredited Pecksniff, more dim and villainous. The poor man’s appearance would have startled any- 24 BOO 9 one but a farmer. Starting from the top was — ^not a hat — ^that came second on the list — ^the first was a hank of hair — “ if ’air you calls it ” — sticking through holes in the Wreck of the Hesperus which was his hat. Frowsy whiskers and stubble covered his face, about a six months’ growth. A football jersey and a great tattered moming-coat that might have been made for a seven-foot-high Herbert Campbell. The tails swept the grotmd behind, and the ragged sleeves almost did the same to the ground in front ; trousers like Chariot’s, only not so smart or well-fitting ; and the soles of his boots gaped from the uppers like the jaws of thirsty dogs. In this very unsuitable outfit the man endeavoured to mount a bicycle which was in an even worse condition than his wardrobe. Whereas his clothes at least hung together, his machine did not ; it seemed to disintegrate before one’s eyes whenever he tried to make the smallest adjustment. What struck me most about this man was his infinite patience rebus in arduis. If his sleeves caught once in his bicycle they caught a dozen times. They caught in the handlebars, the brake, the saddle, the pedals, the spokes, the step — everywhere ; and each time he carefully disentangled his rags — ^in case be tore them, I suppose — and started all over again like Carlyle. He had evidently neglected the care of his machine as much as his toilet, as no nuts were tight — in fact, when he was at last in the saddle the handlebars came out by the roots as soon as he sat back. He rode round and round on the bicycle, and each time he came round full circle there was something else missing, until at last there was nothing left but a sort of elemental cycle ; a monocycle now, just one wheel and pedals, and he was still riding it. But laugh I What an artist ! After the show I had been invited to the Vaudeville Club, where my friend the secretary asked if I’d like a game of billiards. He then introduced me to a very dapper little man, and I thought to myself how very neat he looked and how well turned out. He was clean-shaven, with hair newly trimmed. He wore a white stiff collar with what looked like a new navy blue suit and shoes obviously finished off with a bone. “ Sorry,” I said to the secretary, “ I did not quite get the name.” “ Sam Barton,” answered the secretary. “ You ^ow, the Tramp Cyclist ! ” Feb. 7 At Firth Shephard’s luncheon to-day sat between Mary Thursday.

I am comfortably tucked up last night with the second volume of A Shorter Ego, where I read about the War Office apologising to me for not having been able to race my address. So I fling the book into the fireplace, reach for Kingsmill’s Johnson without Boswell, and open it at : Cleanse the fiUl bosom of that perilous stuff Which weighs upon the heart. Why does H. K. make Johnson misquote ? Or are we to believe that Johnson accepted Pope’s wretched emendation ? This morning I open the Observer, and find Ivor writing about last week’s murder play at the Embassy, “ We are in no mood for watching the heart of our blood-boltered Mr Bowling melt in the presence of a pious miss.” But Shakespeare applies his adjective to his murderee and not to his murderer. To * bolter ’ is old provincial English, meaning to ‘ mat in 26 EOO 9 tufts * ; and it was Banquo’s hair which became matted, and not Macbeth’s. Talked about this to-night to the Sixty- three Club, which has something to do with the United Universities Club in Suffolk Street. Went on to compare the thoroughness of fifty years ago with the slip- shoddery of to-day. Was terribly tired when I began, but freshened up after a bit. Fd). 12 Speech at the Luncheon for the Reopening of the Curzon Tmsday. Cinema : Mr Chairman, Ladies, and Gentlemen : No young film critic has ever heard of Chadband. These clever young gentlemen will tell you all about Pudovkin’s “ Theoretical Postulates of Discontinuity ” 1 But they raise their eyebrows if you mention Joe Gargery or Harold Skimpole, and it is inconceivable that any of them should have heard of Chadband. Wherefore, for the benefit of these young intellectuals, should there be any present to-day, I shall explain that Chadband is a character in a novel by Charles Dickens. That he was a large, oily man with the idiosyn- crasy, or what non-highbrows call habit, of defining things by their opposites, and generally in the form of a question. “ My friends, what is peace ? Is it war ? No. Is it strife ? No.” One of the ways of describing the films at the Curzon Cinema, which has given us so many hours of delight and whose reopening we are celebrating to-day, is to say what in the past they were not like. I have been looking up my cutting-books to see what was being produced at other West End cinemas in the same week that the Curzon opened. I find that at the largest of them I saw one of New York’s Fovur Hundred, dressed in the height of fashion of 1934, explaining to her husband in a crater on Mount Vesuvius that she had always been faithful to him. “ I knew it,” he said. This was his dying utterance, and as the curtains drew together the rose-pink sirocco carried the words away. That was the kind of film which the Curzon did not present. Well, what kind did it present ? What did it lead off with ? It led off, I find, with a drama about Franz Schubert dying of mislaid spectacles and a broken heart. In a cornfield, which presently merged into a cathedral, with Martha Eggerth in full blast at the famous Ave Maria. Next there was a film about Beethoven, who contracted deafi>ess through listening to the voice of Nature in a thunderstorm. However, it didn’t really matter, because through- out the rest of the film that g,7eat actor Har^ Baur was busy com- posing the ” Moonlight Sonata,” and a deaf man can listen to moonlight as well as one whose hearing is perfect. I don’t think the Curzon is going to make those mistakes again. I don’t think it will show us Tschaikowsky hammering away at that 27 EOO 9 concerto, or our Mr Addinsell concocting that Warsaw rubbish. It is true that we are threatened with something about Berlioz and his Symphonie Fantastigue. But I feel that the French film of to-day fantasticates better than it did. It is announced that the Curzon will give us none but French films — in my humble opinion the best in the world. This being so, think of the lovely things we are not going to have. No Hollywood star or starlet. No British bread- and-butter Miss explaining to James Mason or Stewart Granger in a modem West Kensington accent that she is Defoe’s Moll Flanders. No cinema organist alternating Jerome Kern’s “ All the Things .You Are ” with Handel’s Largo. No. We look forward to films as sophisticated as the one we saw this morning. On behalf of the guests here to-day I thank this utterly delightful cinema, whose reopening makes us giddy with expectation, for this morning’s film. Let me assure the new management that whatever films it puts forward will receive the critics’ fascinated, rapt attention. Feb. 14 Wolfit will have to take comfort in the fact that a man Thursday. may be a very fine adtor and still not succeed as Othello. There was Irving, for example. Dutton Cook ended his notice of the 1876 performance : Mr Irving’s acting abounds in emotion and passion, with grateful intervals of desperate calm, as when Othello stands petrified and aghast at his own most miserable folly and crime, resembling, it must be confessed, as he folds round him his robe, one of the late Mr Fenimore Cooper’s Mohawk braves draped in his blanket. Shall say on Sunday what Henry Morley said about Fechter in the same r61e : “ Though he wins no laurels, he loses none.” After all, it was very clever of D. W. to arrange that, as the old Hungarian song so nearly said, more was not lost on Mohawk’s field. Fd). 18 Week-end at Brighton on my disgusting doctor’s orders. Monday. Find that my bedroom is on the fifth floor in an hotel without a lift. Asthma supervening, I crawl along the front at the rate of a hundred yards every quarter of an hour, having to stand in my tracks for two or three minutes at a time. As this is a bore to me and a nuisance to my friends, finally retire to hotel lounge, having slipped a lot of work in among my shirts. Wretchedly nervy the entire time, but am completely restored, or as much restored as I can expect to be, on getting into Victoria Station. 28 EGO 9 F^. 21 On the advice of my increasingly disgusting doctor Thursday. see a specialist, who asks if 1 can go to live in South Africa. I say I can’t and won’t, whereupon he recom- mends half a teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda after breakfast. All this takes up the entire morning. Which means that before I go to bed I must write my Sunday Times article about last night’s play, see to-night’s play, write about that, and then break the back of my Express stuff. Feh. 23 Scarlet Street, the new film at the Leicester Square Saturday. Theatre, has been banned in America. Presumably because it shows a gold-digger, her fancy boy, and an amorous old fool for what they are. Had the first been shown as the victim of a brutal stepfather, the second as Mr Decent-at-Heart anxious to retrace his steps and take the right turning, and the third as an old gentleman whose form of going gaga is being kind to little girls all would have been well. But since they are painted for what they are, and since the picture shows their alleged inevitable bad end, America, which includes Chicago, in its pudicity has banned it. A really immoral film would have shown the three in their true colours and living together in perfect amity. Which, of course, is what happens in real life. For myself I thought it a grand film, and when I got home re-read that section of Splendeurs et Mish'es which Balzac called “ A combien 1’ Amour revient aux Vieillards.” Feh. 24 A Shorter Ego was published during the week. Am Sunday. horrified to find that in the entry for February 8, 1919 I ask what Macbeth’s going hence has to do with Lady M. “ Macbeth’s ” should be “ Duncan’s,” of course. This figures in my comprehensive list of errata made some months ago. But too late for the short version, which was then binding. I suppose slips of the pen — I prefer to call them slips of the mind — are unavoidable. Only last week in ^■he S T.l alluded to “ an old Russian song,” knowing all the time that it is Hungarian. On Monday morning I received three postcards : “ Hungarian, darling I ” “ Hungarian, Mr Know- all 1 ” “ Hungarian, you bloody fool ! ” But the slips should be very rare. What I cannot understand is the columnist who gets every other French accent wrong and discourses of Victorian Sardou and Michael Arlan. Or the first-rate publisher who can pass pire de 20 BOO 9 famiUe. Or the admirable novelist who can quote from the old rhyme They drink the champagne she sends them, and not hear that there is a syllable missing. I shan’t be able to sleep until I have dropped the author a postcard : They drink the champagne what she sends them. Feb. 26 Rest-cure not going well. Rush to idiotic film about Tuesday, one of those young Americans who graduate at a univer- sity, study art in Paris, and return home with a vocabu- lary of words of one syllable : “ She looked good to me, and she smelled good to me.” The whole thing took place in a wallow of Techni-horror, a welter of swimming-pools, and a world of arrested mental development. Back to flat and prepare speech in honour of seventieth birthday of Harrap’s Chairman. Eat too little and drink too much, with result that speech goes well. To flat again, where I sit down to write a thousand words about this morning’s rubbish, but must break off to receive a deputation from the French Embassy, who want me to find a theatre for a young group of French players calling themselves “ L’ Atelier.” Get rid of deputation with maximum Agatian charm, finish article, and then in a snowstorm to Swiss Cottage, where I sit in a rotten temper through Sean O’Casey’s Bed Boses for Me. Now I just don’t believe in an Irish navvy who says, “ Time’s a perjured jade, an’ ever he moans a man must die.” But then I have enough wit left to realise that I am not supposed to believe in an actual navvy any more than in actual Dublin slatterns chanting in unison like a Greek chorus composed of Kathleen ni Houlihans. To cut it short, the trouble with to-night’s play is that the characters talk O’Casey’s poetry and not theirs. Arrive at the Caf6 Royal round about ten and find it closed, grab a bite somewhere else, and then home, where I sit up to some unthinkable hour struggling with a first draft for Sunday.

I agree that the epigram points to Shakespeare and, if you like, that there is nobody else who fills the bill. But surely what you should have written is “ Jonson described an assuming- bumptious dramatist — 'presumably Shakespeare, etc.” I am (a) disquieted, because now I don’t know how much you have faked — or taken for granted, which amounts to faking — ^in your Don Adriano’s Letter ; and (6) worried, because I am getting communications from eminent K.C.’s asking why I don’t make mincemeat of you. Exhibit B, Letter from Edward D. Johnson : You are right in thinking that I was referring to the epigram in Ben Jonson’s works published in 1616. I think it is clear that this epigram refers to Shaksper, as there is no one else who can possibly fill the bill. I agree that I should have written the paragraph as you suggest. With regard to Don Adriano’s Letter ; I set out the letter as it appears in the First Folio, together with a table showing all of the letters. It is impossible for this table to be faked, as anyone can check it over for himself. The signatures are clearly in the table, and cannot be the result of accident. If you care to send me the names and addresses of the eminent K.C.’s you mention I will send them a copy of Don Adriano’s Letter and ask them what they make of it. 82 EGO 9 I do not know if you have ever studied that great book the First Folio. If some day you could spare me one half-hour of your precious time I should like to show you the First Folio, and I am quite sure that*I could convince you that this was a production of Francis Bacon’s. Can you account for the fact that in the First Folio we get the following message : “ F Bacon all my writings I did place in the grave at Stratford of our actor Master Will Shaksper A grave on peril of a curse I will devise In the hollow ground under earth behind a grate of iron bars there will be found my books ” ? The curse on the grave was evidently placed there by F. B. to prevent the superstitious villagers from disturbing the grave' for a con- siderable period of time. It is, of course, impossible to get the grave opened, as the Shakespeare Trust would fight tooth and nail to prevent this, as they would be afraid that if the grave was opened it would probably mean the end of Shaksper, Stratford, and the Shakespeare Trust. Exhibit C, Second letter from J. A. to £. D. J. : I am enormously interested in what you tell me about the First Folio. I suppose the ‘ message * is one of those cryptogram things. Something of this sort ? Since ‘ William Shakespeare ’ contains eighteen letters the solver takes the eighteenth, thirty-sixth, and fifty-fourth letters, and so on, until he gets his ‘ message.’ If he finds that he wants a seventeenth letter instead of an eighteenth he just knocks the ‘ e ’ off the end of ‘ Shakespeare.’ Does he want the sixteenth letter ? Then he also deletes the ‘ e ’ in the middle. And so on with all the various ways of spelling ‘ Shakespeare.’ And then there’s ‘ William,’ or ‘ Will,’ or just ‘ W.’ Or the first name could be omitted altogether. And if the thing doesn’t come right that way the solver jettisons ‘ William Shakespeare ’ and starts again with ‘ Francis Bacon.’ It must be great fun. Now, my dear sir. Am I doing the Baconians an injustice or not ? Could you briefly give me an idea of how this ‘ message ’ is arrived at ? Exhibit D. Second letter from £. D. J., shortened : Francis Bacon inserted a number of ciphers in the First Folio of the ‘ Shakespeare ’ Plays, one of the most interesting being what may be termed a sixth-line './ord cipher. He chose the sixth lines because he never missed an opportunity of showing the numerical seal or count of the name Bacon, which is 88. When planning the lay-out of the First Folio he decided that each full column ■should contain 66 lines, as 66 is double 88, which represents his -name. Looking at the number six six, he thought it would be a c 88 EOO 9 good idea to insert cipher messages on the sixth line counting down and the sixth line counting up the columns, but as this would not give him sufficient scope he decided also to use the sixth lines counting up or down from the entrance or exit df a character, and also the sixth lines counting up or down from the beginning or end of a scene, and it will be found that this is the method that he adopted. He also used the reverse page numbers, and to show the reader that he is going to do this he numbered the last page in the First Folio, which should be 899, 998 — ^the reverse of 899. He also mis-paged certain of the pages to make pages bear the same number, either true or false. This sixth-line word cipher is an extraordinary piece of work, and the way in which he inserted words in lines which bear the same number counting from certain points on pages which bear or represent the same number, and then arranged for such words when joined together and inter- locked to form sentences to convey messages to the reader, and his ability to incorporate such words in the text so as to make sense with the rest of the text, is almost beyond human compre- hension. But the fact remains that he did so, taking a great delight (although it may appear childish) in juggling with letters, words, and numbers, to make them do exactly what he wished. Only a man with a mathematical brain and an infinite capacity for taking pains could have carried out such an arduous task. Johnson then gives seven lines from the First Folio, with the italicised words alleged to constitute the message : “ Heeres the challenge, reade it, I warrant theres ” “ Must we pursue and I have found a path to it ” “ Not stay for him to kill him, have I not at the place I did ” “ In all my writings. Go with me and see ” “ have the gift of a Grave ” “ Last night I heard they lay at Stony Stratford ” “ But beare it as our Roman actors do ” A message to the reader is at once seen formed out of the words at the beginning or end of these lines, with the exception of the last line, when the words to complete the message are found in the middle of this line, as follows : “ Here’s the challenge, read it — warrant there’s a path to it — I did place — all my writings in — our actor’s — Stratford Grave.” Exhibit E. Third letter from J. A. to E. D. J. : I am not surprised that the message given in yovir second letter doesn’t quite tally with the first. I don’t simpose you carry your First Folio about with you any more than 1 used to cart around my books on the Dreyfus case. Nor will I boggle at the assumption 84 EOO 9 that “ our actor ” means Shakespeare ; it couldn’t be anybody else. Or at the transpositions without which you would be defeated. But there is one thing I want to ask. When did F. B. place his writihgs in the ^ave ? Before, during, or after the funeral ? Is there any evidence that he was at the funeral ? Travelling in those days was a slow business. The news would have had to get from Stratford to London, and then F. B. would have to make his journey. (We know that the funeral took place within three days.) Is there any evidence as to the date at which the “ Cursed be he ” tablet, or whatever it is, was set up ? Did F. B., if he wasn’t at the funeral, break into the grave later and then set up the warning ? He talks about “ a grate of iron bars,” which is a cumbersome bit of furniture. Is it supposed that F. B. did all the tinkering unbeknown to the Church authorities ? Didn’t they question an old gentleman prowling around in the dead of night ? Or did F. B. declare his identity ? Then, in the spring of 1616, when Ellesmere, the Lord Chancellor, was danger- ously ill, wasn’t Bacon pretty busy trying to manoeuvre himself into the job ? Would he, in the circumstances, be likely to be wandering about the country prising open tombs ? If it wasn’t F. B., who was his deputy ? I don’t expect a complete answer to these questions, since this would probably take up too much of your time. What I should like is the general line of reply. And may I ask you to put established facts in black ink, and surmises in red ? Exhibit F. Third letter from E. D. J. : You ask me a number of questions which I cannot possibly answer, and which I should imagine no one else can either, after a lapse of 330 years. If any writings were placed in the grave it must have been some considerable time after the funeral, probably when the slab containing the curse was placed over the grave. So far as I know the first reference to the curse is in Malone (1790). F. B. in the cipher says that he erected the statue on the church wall. He must have obtained the permission of the Church authori- ties to do this, but how or when we shall never know. W. S. died in April 1616. It would take some time to produce both the curse tablet and the monument, and it seems quite likely that these were not placed in the chui - h foi several years after the death of W. S., and this would give F. B. plenty of time to collect the writings ready for interment at the time the cu..se tablet was .placed on the grave. There are, of course, no established and proven facts, and that is the trouble. The claim that F. B. wrote the plays dot s not depend on this cipher, but on the evidence contained in the First Folio, and that is the reason why I want to show you a number of very interesting things in this great book, quite apart from this cipher. 85 EOO 9 Exhibit G. Fourth and concluding letter from J. A. : I shall be delighted if next time you are in Town you will bring me the First Folio, if it’s portable, when I promise you I will look at it in a “ trifling ladylike, amateur manner ” that isn’t going to compromise me. 1 think you Baconians have got something. But not everything ; I just cannot believe that all these cryptograms and ciphers are flukes. My theory is that F. B., who was a frequenter of playhouses, fell in with young Shaksper from Strat- ford, an4 that the two put their heads together in a trifling and gentlemanlike manner that didn’t compromise either of them. What I will not believe is that Shaksper had enough knowledge of the polite world to produce the whole of the plays himself, or that the author of the essays, which read like the prospeetus of an insuranee company dealing in endowment polieies, had an ounee of poetry in his composition. But deeper into the subject I will not delve. It has for me the same faseination as the Dreyfus case, the Mystery of the Marie Celeste, and the Wallace ea^e. Or you might put it that while in respect of this question of total authorship I am a poor Shaksperite I am a hell of a bad Baeonian. I wind up with a note from my friend Arnold Taylor ; One might wish that W. S.’s dealings in malt and in his old age were otherwise, but not long ago it was discovered that the blame- less Titian, when in his nineties, indulged in some very shady speculations in timber, so William is at least in good company. I have a book Le Mystere Shakespearien, by Georges Counes, a Dijon professor. It sets out the theories of the various claimants to the authorship of the plays — ^Bacon, Oxford, Derby, and Rutland. He does not criticise them, but leaves them to eontradiet eaeh other. And his witty conelusion is “ II me semble que, comme Bacon disait que, si un peu de science ^loigne de Dieu, beaucoup de science y ram^ne, si une 4tude superficielle du probl^me Shakespearien 61oigne de Shakespeare, une longue 6tude y ram^ne.” To which I think we may safely say “ Amen.” March 2 Quiller-Couch, Maurice Baring, Logan Pearsall Smith — Saturday. I have regarded these three as a preserve of my own. In the sense that I was always dipping into Shake- speare's Workmanship, Punch and Judy, and On Beading Shakespeare, and alone of the dramatic critics quoted from them. Often. And now the last of this gracious trio has gone. I never met “ Q,” and was on the point of writing to tell him of many years of admiration when he died ; wherefore a few weeks later I persuaded the B.B.C. 86 EGO 9 to let me give a Sunday reading from the essay on The Tempest. I set this down for reasons similar to those which made Pearsall Smith think it lawful t 9 copy out De Quincey’s famous passage on the knocking at the gate in Macbeth : I conclude by asseverating that were a greater than Ariel to wing down from Heaven and stand and offer me to choose which, of all the books written in the world, should be mine, I should choose — not the Odyssey, not the JEneid, not the Divine Comedy, not Paradise Lost ; not Othello nor Hamlet nor Lear ; but this little matter of 2000 odd lines — The Tempest. “ What ? — ^rather than Othello or than Lear ? ” Yes : for I can just imagine a future age of men, in which their characterisation has passed into a curiosity, a pale thing of antiquity ; as I can barely imagine, yet can just imagine, a world in which the murder of Desdemona, the fate of Cordelia, will be considered ciuuously, as brute happenings proper to a time outlived ; and again, while I reverence the artist who in OtheUo or in Lear purges our passion, forcing us to weep for present human woe. The Tempest, as I see it, forces diviner tears, tears for sheer beauty ; with a royal sense of this world and how it passes away, with a catch at the heart of what is to come. And still the sense is royal : it is the majesty of art : we feel that we are greater than we know. So on the surge of our emotion, as on the surges ringing Prospero’s island, is blown a spray, a mist. Actually it dwells in our eyes, bedimming them : and as involun- tarily we would brush it away, there rides in it a rainbow ; and its colours are wisdom and charity, with forgiveness, tender ruth for all men and women growing older, and perennial trust in young love. Neither did I ever meet Logan Pearsall Smith, but am glad to think that I sent his On Reading Shakespeare to Maurice Baring, who did not know it, a few weeks before M. B. died. In the section called “ The Enigmas ” L. P. S., discussing the old question whether Shakespeare is better on the stage or in the study, and preferring the second, writes : How, I ask you, are stage-enthusiasts — I ask you, Granville- Barker, and you, too, Desmond MacCarthy, and you, Maurice Baring — g(''ng to answer Robertson, Charles Lamb, Hazlitt, Cole- ridge, Goethe and me ? It is really up to you to make a reply ; and such a reply to be valid shoul 1, 1 suggest, enumerate first of all the scenes in Shakespeare’s plays which are only effective upon the stage ; and secondly a record of concrete esthetic experiences, of the rendering of Shakespearean r^iles by great actors and actresses by which the imaginative impression of these rdles has been deepened and enriched. 87 EGO 9 The complete answer to this would need a book. But here, I think, is something out of the play of Hamlet. The Ghost has stalked away on the line Adieu, adieu, adieu! remember ipe.*^ Whereupon Hamlet, lying on the ground, has his “ O all you host of heaven ! ** Of all the Hamlets I have seen Wolfit is the first to go into his swoon lying on his back. He recovers, and apostrophises the first thing that meets his eyes — ^the stars. Since, in my knowledge, no other Hamlet has thought of this I doubt whether the notion has occurred to many readers. Then take that bit in King Lear where the stage direction reads, “ Enter Lear, fantastically dressed with wild flowers.” I And an enormous increase in pathos when I have the visual sense of the benign, summer-afternoon sunshine. And I certainly do not think that the scene in Antony and Cleopatra where the stage direction “ Music of hautboys as under the stage ” leads up to “ ’Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony loved, now leaves him,” is as effective to read as when you hear the music and see the soldiers who recognise it as a portent. I think that Pearsall Smith perceived a divided duty in this old allegiance. At one moment he writes : It certainly does sound preposterous for those who love Shake- speare’s drama to peer only tmough their spectacles at its text ; to shudder at seeing it acted, and to maintain that the fullness of its dramatic effect is thwarted and counteracted by the only means of securing that effect which ever, for a moment, occupied Shake- speare’s thoughts. At another : I persist in reading Shakespeare’s plays with my own intelli- gence, and in witnessing their performance in a theatre of my own imagination, lit as it is by the light of lamps far different from those which glared before the stage. But the book is balanced, sane, witty, and lovely everywhere. For myself I have a tripartite duty — to its author, to “ Q,” and to Maurice. March 8 There is this to be said for British films, that they never Sunday. descend to the level of Hollywood’s worst. One day last week I saw a picture in which a horse galloped up to John Wayne, who was throwing steers in a rodeo competition, to tell him that Jean Arthur wasn’t going to die of pneumonia. Or perhaps it was the horse that wasn’t going to die, and Jean who came cantering up with the news. Nothing as pitiful as that happened 88 EGO 9 at the British Film Festival, organised by the Daily Mail and held at the Leicester Square Theatre this afternoon. The occasion was mildly interesting because of the mild quality of the six films, bits of which were recited by ffesh-and-blood actors into a microphone. There were three resonant speeches by Eric Portman, Anton Wal- brook, and Robert Donat, but for the rest I couldn’t get up any kind of interest. The music struck me as being of a hopeless mediocrity, so many attempts to improve on Elgar and doing less well than Edward German. And why did they have to trot out that resounding piece of emptiness the Warsaw concerto ? This was all very well as background music to the film for which it was designed, since it wittily suggested that something in the concert line was going on. As I sat listening I watched my old friend Alec Whittaker tootling away as gravely as though it had been the New World symphony. Unless I dreamed, he kept his eyes closed throughout the entire proceedings, but opened them once to wink prodigiously in my direction. The object of the jamboree was the award of a trophy representing “ a nation-wide recognition of brilliance in acting and production, based on the judgment expressed voluntarily by the great British cinema-going public.” Meaning, I take it, the readers of a particular daily paper. But suppose the result of the Daily Mail plebiscite doesn’t agree with the recent Daily Eacpress plebiscite on the same subject ? And suppose the News Chronicle and the Daily Herald weigh in with more plebiscites ? In any case how much judgment has the great British cinema-going public ? Enough to choose between Mr A’s teeth and Mr B’s shoulders. Miss X’s ankle and Miss Y’s calf. Odd, by the way, that there was no mention of two films which made some stir at the time — Henry V and Ccesar and Cleopatra ! March 4 I see by the paper that Donald Wolfit has been talking Monday, to the Critics’ Circle. “ Dramatic critics must possess the faculty of keeping young in heart.” How old in heart, meaning how worn in mind, does D. W. think Shaw was when he put on the map of this country the greatest dramatist since Moli^re ? Aj-i put him wittily on the map ? But the first act of Rosmersholm had hardly begun on Monday night, when I recognised, with something like excitement, the true atmosphere of this most enthralling of all Ibsen’s works rising like an enchanted mist for the first time on an English stage. There were drawbacks, of course. The shabbiness of the scenery did not EOO 9 trouble me ; but the library of Pastor Rosmer got on my nerves a little. What on earth did he want, for instance, with SelVs World's Press ? D. W. went on to say that Shaw’s criticisms had been brilliant, but he did not think they should be imitated. I cannot think of a time when the London stage had more need of an imitator. Finally D. W. suggested that Clement Scott was a far better pattern for the health of our theatre than the new freeman of Dublin. Meaning, as all actors mean, that the function of the critic is not to dissuade people from seeing* twaddle, but to gloss over twaddle in order to pack the people in. Before I was told to take things easy I should have written a full-length letter to Wolfit telling him my views on what to me is nonsense and why I hold it to be nonsense. But such a letter would have taken me two hours, whereas this Diary entry has taken me ten minutes. Wherefore let it be put on record that to-day I made my first successful attempt to do less work. March 5 Symphonic Fantastique, at the Curzon, is a bad film Tuesday, because the material is not there to make a good one. Berlioz’s life falls into three categories. His music — there is not enough of it in this picture. His unending struggles, and the infinite boredom of the scribbling by which he had to keep himself alive. I return to my treadmill — ^journalism — once more, and oh ! the horror of it ! The misery of writing to order an article on nothing in particular — or on things that, as far as I was concerned, simply did not exist since they excited in me no feeling of any description whatsoever. The film merely hints at this. Last there’s the wit ; this film has none. What it does give is the marriage with Henriette Smithson, and the tedious second marriage with Marie Recio. Of Smithson there is very little to tell. When Charles Kean went over to Paris to play Hamlet she was his Ophelia, and a very bad one ; Hazlitt dismisses her in a sentence : “ Miss Smithson is tall ; and the French admire tall women.” About the second wife there is even less to be said. She was a fool who, to quote Grove, “ frequently imperilled the success of her husband’s work by insisting on the leading part in its performance.” To-day’s film showed her as one of those lambent imbeciles who desert an artist at his most need on the plea that it will be good for his art. But there were compensations. The nobility 40 EGO 9 of art, the power of music, and the compulsion of work — ^all these were recognised. There was no suggestion of commonness. Even so, there were things in Berlioz’s life which could have been done better. Paganini makes one entry after the failure of Benvenuto Cellini, when he comes to tell the composer that he has written a work of genius. After which he stalks away like the Ghost in Hamlet. How much more dramatic to have reproduced the scene from the Life. It was after a concert at which both the Sympkonie Fanlastique and Harold in Italy had been given : Paganini, with his little son, Achille, appeared at the orchestra door, gesticulating violently. Consumption of the throat, of which he afterwards died, prevented his speaking audibly, and Achille alone could interpret his wishes. He signed to the child, who climbed on a chair and put his ear close to his father’s mouth, then, turning to me, he said, “ Monsieur, my father orders me to tell you that never has he been so struck by music. He wishes to kneel and thank you.” Confused and embarrassed, I could not speak, but Pagknini seized my arm, hoarsely ejaculating, “ Yes ! Yes ! ” dragged me into the theatre, where several of my players still lingered — and there knelt and kissed my hand. Next day Berlioz tells us that he received a letter from the virtuoso enclosing a note for twenty thousand francs. Who would have expected a French film to miss this ? Good performance by Jean- Louis Barrault, and nice to see that the film company includes the composer’s name in its list of credits ! March 6 In a letter from George Lyttelton : Wednesday. By the way, Charles Fry on W. G. as compared with Ranji. How could he judge ? He never saw W. G. before the ’nineties. My father, who often played with the old man in the ’sixties and often saw him in the ’nineties, always said the young W. G. was much better than the old one, and he was no laudator temporis acti. Mainly because he was far quicker, which is not surprising, as he was at least six stone lighter. March 9 Last night’s Son^ of Norway, at the Palace, w;as a Saturday. fluttering horror. Sat up half the night demolishing it : Berlioz, who was punster 'as well as wit, wrote to Madame Ernst, “ On vous demande comment vous avez pass6 la nuit, jamais comment vous passez I’ennjiii.” Or one might ask, A quoi 41 EGO 9 rtveni lesjeunes fiUes as their eyes and ears drink in the enthralling story of how Chopin died of George Sand, and Schubert of mislaid spectacles ? To find their answer is easy. They ask why the whole of life should not be light opera, why young ladies should not for ever clasp to their bosoms bunches of myosotis presented by blushing cavaliers. But of what do old men dream as they watch the familiar witlessness unfold itself, the critics who could tell you the plot backwards before the curtain goes up, the carpers who think that sumptuosity and glitter should clothe something more than vacuity ? Archer’s recommendation was sleep. Did some of us, gazing at that handsome backcloth of alp and fiord, murmur something about “ night-dews on still waters between walls of shadowy granite, in a gleaming pass,” and ask ourselves whether the modern poet despises song or just can’t sing ? Or did we think of that sea in terms of Ibsen ? How Ellida came from it and little Eyolf fell into it. How the “ Indian Girl ” sailed over it. How Peer Gynt might have been drowned in it. How Captain Alving caroused and made lewd jokes by it. How Oswald Alving braved it when he went to Paris, unless, of course, he took the overland route via St Petersburg and Pskof. Did we add up the number of times anybody in the plays is allowed to eat or drink anything ? (Mrs Borkman, who hasn’t seen her sister for eight years, doesn’t offer her even a cup of tea.) Did we, in the mind’s eye, conjure up a vision of the Old Man glaring out of his hedge- hoggery of whisker in rapt disfavour at the I’m-to-be-Queen-of-the- May frolics and gambollings ? Did we, getting back to the matter in hand, cast about for reasons why a composer known to be third-rate — ‘ miniaturist ’ is a politer word — at the beginning of the evening should be rapidly declining to fifth-rate as the pro- ceedings drag on, and will be seventh-rate before the curtain finally falls ? Did we ask why, in the ball scene, six young women should take to dancing Solveig’s Song ? Or wonder whether six old women would make six teetotums out of the dying Ase ? Or make a bet with our neighbour on how long it would be before the waiters handing round the ices lifted up their voices and gave us yet another chunk of that Piano Concerto ? And so on. . . . March 11 The modern critical dislike of Richard Strauss is becoming Monday, farcical. Here is the Times music critic on the concert given yesterday by the Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam : Berlioz’s Symphonic Fantastique was chosen — mercifully in pre- ference to Em Heldenlehen — ^to show the capacity of the orchestra at its full strength. This opens up a charming field. Presently we shall be reading : 42 EGO 9 Elgar’s Cockaigne Overture was chosen — mercifully in prefer- ence to Till Eulenspiegel — ^to show the orchestra’s sense of wit. Or : Mozart’s The Marrieige of Figaro was chosen — ^mercifully in pre- ference to Bosenkavalier — to show the orchestra’s sense of period. Or even : Brahms’s Feldeinsamkeii was chosen — ^mercifully in preference to Morgen — ^to show the singer’s feeling for natural beauty. March 12 Falstaff was the cause that wit was in other men. Nobody Tuesday, can take it from me that I am the cause that people write me good letters. I just don’t believe that anybody in London received three better letters this morning than I did. Here they are : From a sergeant in the Pacific : JVJC123658 Sgt. G. McIntyre Legal H.Q. Morotai Force Moroiai Australian Military Forces Dear Mr Agate, This letter is written from the tropical island of Morotai — “ the Island of the Dead ” to the Indonesians. At present Japanese war criminals are being tried here for offences against us and our Allies. In a case before the court to-day the men had taken part in the execution of an airman whom they had captured on some island in the Banda Sea. There have been several similar cases, but a new element was introduced this morning. Kateyama, the accused, has given his evidence. He had been chosen to do this solemn service (the beheading) in honour of those condemned. “ In Japanese chivalry, we thought it an honour on behalf of the condemned, not to ourselves. It was my first experi- ence to carry out that solemn but dreadful execution,” was part of his plea. Kateyama speaks English, and claims to be a Christian — ^a Methodist. He has an Aunt Winnie in Japan. “ Aunt Winnie ” is an Englishwoman, born in London, and married since 1937 to “ Uncle Yamaguchi ” of Tokio. When she heard that Kateyama had been arr sted is a war criminal she wrote good-character refer- ences for him, expoimding at length his careful upbringing and expressing belief in his uaiocen.:e. She added, however, that if he had done wrong he was to be punished. Throughout his evidence he spoke of his “ Aunt Winnie ” or “ Auntie,” and much had been made of his good connections. 48 EOO 9 To-day is February 27, This morning Ego 7 arrived for me from Australia. Reading it before the afternoon sitting com- menced, I reached the entry for 27 February the pronounce- ment of Austin Melford, “ Close those eyes, Geoffrey — close them. Ah, yes, I’ve murdered him. What will his aunt in Japan say ? ” It was as a voice from another world, similar to those cases where guidance is sought by plunging a pin into an inspired writing, and extracting an enlightened text. I at once drew the attention of the Prosecutor (whom I am assisting) to the extra- ordinary circumstances. The Defending Officer was consulted, and the matter brought to the attention of the court. An exhausting discussion followed as to whether your script should be elevated to the status of an inspired pronouncement, or on the other hand, of equal significance, would it be reasonable to regard past pronounce- ments from inspired sources as no more than coincidental dipping into ‘ profane ’ writing ? Opinions were hotly expressed — sacred and profane — and it is now up to the court, in arriving at their verdict, to decide how much weight should be given to the incident — “ Karma or Coincidence ? ” The implications are far-reaching. In effect, there is the possi- bility that may arise of a general and legal (International Law) recognition of your Ego attaining to and containing (in your life- time) some mystical significance. It is a chain of unusual events — your London story 27 February the inclusion in Ego, the arrival on Morotai via Sydney on 27 February the execution trial with all its emphasis on his aunt in Japan, and the reading in the atap-roofed court hut at such a moment in all time. As a consistent and appreciative reader of the Egos and other books and essays by you, it gives me much pleasure to bring the facts before you. Yours sincerely. Grant McIntyre Later P.S. The court has just announced its verdict. Kateyama has been found guilty. G. McI. Still later P.P.S. The court has just sentenced Kateyama to death by shooting. Congratulations and salutations, Mr Agate, and does it make you feel elevated or frighteningly responsible ? G. McI. From St John’s Wood : Dear Mr Agate, Pursuing and enjoying yet another Ego, I am reminded that there once lived in this house an even greater Bernhardt-addict than yourself. She lived here most of her life, and died shortly before we came in 1914. 44 EOO 9 Miss X always dressed entirely in black, and never went out except when Sarah Bernhardt was in London. She then dressed in undiluted white and sallied forth in a carriage — often visiting the actress, who rethrned the visits to this house. Miss X had a box at the theatre, and attended every perform- ance of her goddess ; she also sent her one dozen red carnations, every day of the year to whatever part of the world Bernhardt might be in, from the florist in Finchley Road, at the top of this road. The ex-owner, the late Mr Amy, once told me that this order was worth £500 a year to him. When we came here the garden was full of busts of the Divine Sarah. We had a divine time throwing divine bricks at them, pieces of which still form indispensable parts of our somewhat-less- divine rockery. Creeping Jennie now grows over the noses you both admired so much ! With thanks for much enjoyable reading. I remain. Yours sincerely, Ronald T. Horley From C. B. Fi^ : 1. W. G. was very tall, and long and loose of limb, and when young a large-sized athlete. He was very keen and shrewd and kindly and domineering — except with squires and noblemen. He was rather sheep-faced, vacillating with females, but very fond of his wife. 2. In his time wickets were good on the county grounds but lively, and the danger was fast howling, and there were a lot of good fast bowlers. When a batsman went in (a top-notcher) he felt that if he could master the fast stuff the rest was easy, comparatively. 8. Now W. G. stood tall, and simply thumped fast bowling all over the place. He didn’t lunge. He just stood where he was and pressed it or leant against it. And he was a ve^ clever and safe late cutter, as he was well above even the high rising ball and cut with an almost straight bat rather like a slicing backstroke. He so outplayed all the other bats of his time ai the fast howling that this alone gave him indisputable and admired eminence. 4. He could play medium pace bowling on good wickets with a toothpick — ^with his huge reach, fine timing, and lambent eye. 5. Above all he was studiously correct, and he really did watch the ball — ai,e it up with his eyes. 6. He never liked good slow bowling as he did fast, and was rather doubtful at good leg-treaks. But he was a magnificent driver both off and on, and when young could jump out to clout the good length ball from the slower bowlers. 7. His body poise was correct for the main strokes, but he had 45 EOO 9 no nicety and beauty of poise, no facile adaptability as Ranji had ; nor had he the acrobatic quickness of Don Bradman. Ranji had, and the Don has, a much quicker and more facile power oi hand (usually called wrist) that gives acceleration of the stroke just before impact. 8. W. G. was a fine hitter on wet wickets, but not a specially good back player, and he could, or did, not hook — ^not free enough of foot. 9. W. G. was a tremendous batsman — ^a giant. But he was conventional, compared with Ranji and the Don. 10. ^nji’s virtues were (a) peculiar quickness, (6) lovely supple facile body-poise, (c) brains. 11. W. G. was Coeur-de-lion, Ranji was Saladin {cf. The Talisman). 12. W. G.’s fame was as the Champion All-rounder. He was the best change bowler of his time, and worth his place on this count alone in the England XI. That is usually forgotten. His vivid, giant, bearded personality was one reason he was regarded as the nonpareil. 13. The difficulty in these valuations is, in dealing with evidence, to distinguish scientific observation and sentiment. W. G. was a beloved national institution and his excellence sacrosanct. He was a terrific big fellow and a great sportsman. 14. By the way, he had immense stamina, and could go on batting at full pressure all day. 15. N.B. Through all his best seasons in England Ranji had asthma, and often did not sleep till 6 or 7 a.m. He was a marvel. C. B. March 13 Twelve years ago the play made out of James Laver’s Wednesday. Nymph Errant was a good entertainment. Or perhaps Cole Porter’s music and a cast containing Gertrude Lawrence, Norah Howard, Bruce Winston, Morton Selten, Austin Trevor, and my sister May tiurned it into good entertainment. To- night’s new version, which they call Evangeline, seemed to me vulgar tawdry, and silly beyond words. In the middle of the scene in which Evangeline (Frances Day) makes her bargain with the slave-dealer an odd thing happened. The stage disappeared, and in its place I beheld a vision, or succession of visions, constituting the new musical play to end all musical plays. First a ball in old Vienna. Brahms, minus his beard, resplendent in the uniform of the Budapest Guards, casts a countess from him, announcing that he is now all for music and the simple life. In the second act B. is wandering in the woods in search of some long-lost Hungarian dances. The third act happens in 46 EGO 0 a gipsy encampment, bounded on one side by Mohac’s Field and on the other by Wardour Street, the distant spire being that of St Mohac-in-the-Fields. To the thrumming of zithers peasants madly dance. Flagons circulate gaily, and copious draughts of yohimbine, penicillin, and M. and B. are consumed. Seated on a log in the fore- ground is the now fully bearded composer taking it all down in full score. As the curtain falls the Four Serious Songs are being crooned, swung, jazzed, and jived through floodlit loud-speakers. The vision then faded. And as I opened my eyes the Chief Eunuch was lowering Day through a manhole into the Bosphorus. March 14 Here’s a how-de-do. Here’s a state of things. May Thursday. is naturally anxious to see a reprint of her book on Sarah, and Bertie van Thai, who would like to oblige, can’t at the moment because he hasn’t the paper, wherefore he seeks my moral and advisory support. The result is a letter from May to me beginning, “ Dear Mr Jorkins,* I rang up Mr Spenlow yester- day. . . .” To which I have replied, “ Dear Agnes Wickfield, must you behave like Dora ? ” If there is a moral here it is : Never come between a sister and her publisher. May is a great if sometimes masterful dear, and I shall have my revenge by publishing a picture of her at the age of two, fondling a photographer’s stuffed seagull. March 15 Of all the reviews I have ever had of the longer or shorter Friday. Ego Frank Singleton, of the BoUon Evening News, has written the one which has given me the most pleasure : “ The English,” says Mr James Agate, ” instinctively admire any man who has no talent and is modest about it.” He himself presents them with the contrary problem ; and though he likes to be admired he makes no concessions to achieve that end. In succeeding volumes of his diary Ego he has told us of his extra- vagances, his debts, his stepping ponies, his friends, and above all the theatre and theatre world in which he is such an outstanding figure. Now he has himself made from this exuberant record A Shorter Ego, of which two volumes are published By doing so Mr Agate has achieved a book which may well fulfil for him that ‘‘ insane desire,” as he calls it, to perpetuate oneself. By contract- ing his diaiw s Mi Agate W achieved an improvement like I^caulay’s when, after his return from India, there began to be noticeable in the unbroken stream of his conversation ‘‘ flashes of silence.” It is no good criticising Mr Agate. You must take him as he so generously allows you to find him — on every page, in every EGO 9 paragraph, take him or leave him for other diversions and consola- tions in whose existence he will not believe. He offers incomparable entertainment, and it is a dull reader who cannot catch beneath the exuberance the muffled drums of life relentlessly advancing beyond laughter into the unknown. The self-professed egotist can recognise “ that timidity of which every man in his heart of hearts knows something.” The lover of life is conscious of death approach-"
