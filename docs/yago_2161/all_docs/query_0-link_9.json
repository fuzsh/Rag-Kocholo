        "text": "Name: Frederik III\n\nBirth: March 18, 1609, Haderslev, Schleswig.\n\nChild of: Christian IV and Anna Catherine of Brandenburg\n\nReign: 1648 - 1670\n\nMarriage: in 1643 to Sophie Amalie of Braunschweig-Lüneburg.\n\nChildren: Christian, Anna Sophia (m. Johan Georg 3. of Sachsen), Frederica Amalia (m. Christian Albrecht of Gottorp), Vilhelmine Ernestine (m. Karl of Pfalz), Frederick, Jørgen/George (m. Queen Anne of the UK) , Ulrika Eleonora (m. Carl XI of Sweden), Dorothea\n\nDeath: 19. February 1670\n\nThrone passed to: Christian V\n\nNotes:\n\nAs the second oldest son of Christian 4. he had a career in public administration in what is today's Germany, but then was part of Denmark, among other things, a publically elected administrator in Halberstadt. He also went on to get an education in theology, science and political science. After the 30 year war, he was instated as the Bishop of Bremen and later Verden. He was first considered heir to the throne after the chosen Prince Christian's death in 1647, and subsequently elected as the heir.\n\nIntroduced Absolute Monarchy to Denmark and Lex Regia (The King's law) was written.\n\nFounder of the Royal Library of Copenhagen\n\nI guess some of you were out shooting rockets last night.\n\nThen as now that can cause difficulties!\n\nDanmark i 1668: Mand straffet for at skyde nytåret ind | Videnskab.dk\n\nThis is a story from 1668 about a tailor in the garrison town of Helsingør (you know, the fortress of Kronborg), who wanted to shoot in the New Year in the morning of 1st January 1668.\n\nHe did that in a good time honored fashion by pointing a gun (my guess is a blunderbuss ) out the door and shoot. He was immediatly approached by soldiers who asked whether he was the one who fired the gun.\n\nThe man, Christen Simmensen, merrily admitted, - Happy New Year. Whereupon the soldiers grabbed him and dragged him through the streets so that he lost one of his slippers. He was then sat on a wooden-horse with two weights attached to both his legs for an hour and a half. - A most unpleasant and with guarantee an instantly sobering experience! (There is a picture of a wooden-horse in use, for those who are not familiar with the instrument).\n\nChristen Simmensen was furious! That was no way to treat a good citizen, who had always paid his taxes. He was merely, as was tradition, shooting in the new year and by the way honoring the king too, as he pointed out in his letter of complaint to Frederik III.\n\nFrederik III had become an absolute monarch just a few years before.\n\nThere is nothing on whether our tailor's complaint was dismissed or not.\n\nIt was most likely dismissed as this is the last example on record of private citizens litterally shooting in the new year in Denmark.\n\nI guess some of you were out shooting rockets last night.\n\nThen as now that can cause difficulties!\n\nDanmark i 1668: Mand straffet for at skyde nytåret ind | Videnskab.dk\n\nThis is a story from 1668 about a tailor in the garrison town of Helsingør (you know, the fortress of Kronborg), who wanted to shoot in the New Year in the morning of 1st January 1668.\n\nHe did that in a good time honored fashion by pointing a gun (my guess is a blunderbuss ) out the door and shoot.

I had the good luck to be present at the film's gala premiere during the Toronto International Film festival (a no brainer for this DRF fan! ) and enjoyed this insight into Danish history immensely. Although it is not given much chance of winning by the usual Hollywood watchers, who knows what might happen on Oscar night, as I can speak with some authority that Mads Mikkelson has an almost irresistable smile!\n\nI´ll give you that his smile is irresistable.\n\nI thought he was a tall man, but then I saw him at the local chinese take away Sunday afternoon and all the magic was gone and I realised how little (of height) he is\n\nDo you think he's so small? Because I've seen him \"in person\" too (he was with his family though, so I resisted going up to him, drooling like an idiot and saying incomprehensible things ) and being pretty tall myself (5'11\"), I don't reckon he's that tiny (but obviously smaller than myself in height). However, I'll give you that he looks waaaaaay taller in the movies which was a bit of a shock for me too. He's still so beautiful though"
