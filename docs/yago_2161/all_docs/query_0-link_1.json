        "text": "Frederik III was the King of Denmark-Norway from 1648; he was married to Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg in 1643 and father to Christian V. Frederik was a son of Christian IV and Anna Cathrine of Brandenburg, but he only became Successor to the Throne after the death of his brother, Christian, the Prince Elect, in 1647.\n\nAt his accession Frederik had to sign a strict charter that was intended to limit his powers. His position soon became stronger, not least because the powerful noblemen Hannibal Sehested and Corfitz Ulfeldt were removed from the Rigsråd (the Government). The disastrous wars with Sweden from 1657 to 1660 led to the loss of Scania, Halland and Blekinge. But the popularity of Frederik grew during the Siege of Copenhagen. While the nobility and the government fled, he stayed in the city with the legendary words: “I shall die in my nest”. He was, therefore, able to strengthen his position even further, and in 1660-1661 hereditary and absolutist monarchy was introduced in Denmark.\n\nFrederik III was very interested in theology and the natural sciences. His large collection of books became the core of the Royal Library. Both he and the Queen were interested in French culture, and Rosenborg, which was the Royal family’s favorite residence in Copenhagen, was modernised in the French style."
