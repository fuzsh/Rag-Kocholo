Her father had been crowned king on 23 November 1648, about five months before she was born.\n\nCareer\n\nShe was reportedly well known to be badly treated by Christian Albert, while the Danish royal family gave her all sorts of personal privileges and proofs of affection. Her visits to Sweden inspired great parties and festivities at the otherwise strict Swedish court, and were much appreciated. She became a widow in 1694.\n\nWith Christian Albert, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, she had four children:\n\nSophie Amalie (19 January 1670 – 27 February 1710), married on 7 July 1695 to Duke Augustus William of Brunswick-Lüneburg.\n\nNumber issue.
